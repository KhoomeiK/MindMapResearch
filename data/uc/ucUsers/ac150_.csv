ucla,fomd4bk,t3_g89blt,1587885748.0,"A LOT of the test questions were purposefully tricky for no fucking reason. I would have rather had to write an essay on everything I knew, because I thought I knew the info well but the tests just go out of their way to ""trick"" you which I don't understand at all. FYI I liked Pires a lot, I thought she was sweet. The tests just sucked ass and I didn't feel like they were ever a fair measure of knowledge."

ucla,fnilg07,t3_fzpo51,1586982042.0, I‚Äôm sO diSapPoinTed to call myself a Bruin riGht NoW. I thought coming to UCLA I was coming to a community. One that helps each other and doesn‚Äôt only care about yourself. But the disregard so many USAC MEMBERS have shown to POOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR DAMN JOBS DURING A PANDEMIC is DISGUSTING. You guys have ruined my university experience. The blatant idiocy on this usac board baffles me. Some of you are so selfish. You spend more money on \[unknown\] than the amount you are willing to give up to help transform the experience of black students and people that dont have any fuckin money.

""And go ahead support Orion, support white candidates. But when this school is having a race war, don‚Äôt come to usac for help. Please please vote for my friend Naomi for President. She is an absolute queen ...""

This is actually atrocious. What kind of mindset is this? Someone needs to answer for this.

ucla,fn1ycj3,t1_fn1a79w,1586573104.0,What the fuck is wrong with you. NO ONE here has anything close to that in their minds. Race war? Are you fr? You think it's cool to equate voting for a white candidate as leading to a race war? Really interesting to see what this Naomi person will say when this goes public more public.
