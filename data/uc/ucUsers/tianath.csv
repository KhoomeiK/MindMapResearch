ucla,fpdd11e,t3_gclqoi,1588524584.0,I can help you:) you can dm if you want
ucla,fpdcwls,t1_fpbd4ys,1588524514.0,Maybe but probably a lot less.
premed,fpbpyre,t3_gcg350,1588475821.0,I have my EMT and phlebotomist license. I would say EMT over CNA and phlebotomist. Phlebotomy is hard to find work in and drawing blog all day isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd call amazing clinical experience. I personally did it for fun and wanted to be an ER tech (EMT and phlebotomist certs needed) but turns out you need like 2-3 years experience mixed in both fields first so just ended up being something I did for fun. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend spending 2k on it though
ucla,fouvpzb,t1_forbr5k,1588091191.0,Online they have made it really hard so I‚Äôm not sure what the in person is lile. A lot of content a lot of memorization but I feel like the exams are probably easier (maybe) I think it‚Äôs different for every person.
ucla,fouups8,t3_g9e9qg,1588090715.0,i typed so quickly that some of my answers probably didn‚Äôt even make sense. Knowing them they probably wanted paragraphs and stuff like that. Horrible exam and the questions were way too deep given our time limit we didn‚Äôt even have time to think about them.
ucla,fopisp6,t1_fop5c9j,1587962596.0,you can do it! I just started shadowing and one of my research experiences this fall and I‚Äôm applying this cycle. So it is doable.
ucla,fooptpv,t1_foontzi,1587943919.0,Yes! Try to look at the bright side and look for things you can do. Medical schools will be more understanding this summer. Try to find a lab in fall that has openings and shadow from fall onto the time you apply and you should be fine!
ucla,foomykl,t1_fooljhl,1587942213.0,It can take anywhere from 8 weeks to like 6 months you have to look at specific programs. I took an 8 week course with 21 units and let me tell you that was killer but possible and I still got a 4.0 and passed. But I don‚Äôt recommend it I hated my life for 2 months. I‚Äôd just take it over summer.
ucla,fooklru,t1_fook0in,1587940835.0,I think the TAs in LS are just as dumb. They never know wtf they‚Äôre talking about and always say ummm for like 5 minutes before giving any remotely close answerü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ucla,fooki78,t1_fookd2v,1587940778.0,Also EMT hours look really good for clinical for your application.
ucla,fookhb8,t1_fookd2v,1587940764.0,I never worked as a scribe so I‚Äôm not sure but I hear it‚Äôs a pretty easy job to get. Also I would highly recommend doing an EMT job over the summer (it‚Äôs one of the best certs to have if you‚Äôre pre med) because it‚Äôs especially cheap right now with the online situation. Really good investment and very easy to get a job.
ucla,foojuy5,t1_foocvyt,1587940404.0,Okay I‚Äôll try I just really don‚Äôt like the LS LAs lol
ucla,foojtyu,t1_fooes90,1587940387.0,Or they respond with a question even tho you clearly have no idea what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm an LA and personally aspire to never be like an LS LAüòÇ
ucla,foojql3,t1_foobw45,1587940333.0,"I get that as a pre med! You can also scribe, there are lots of jobs out there are scribes and phlebotomy doesn‚Äôt provide as extensive clinical experience as like a CNA or EMT so I wouldn‚Äôt just set your heart on only phlebotomy. I would also try to volunteer or join like Care Extenders/shadow."
ucla,foo9mj9,t1_foo0p4a,1587935145.0,"I also found that a lot of the questions are like key word based. If it says ‚Äúonly‚Äù then it‚Äôs probably false, etc, which I don‚Äôt think really tests a persons understanding of the topics. My AP biology class was much harder in terms of content and exams but I felt like the exams really pushed me to think and apply everything I knew. With LS it‚Äôs like idek what exactly they‚Äôre asking because of the tricky and misleading wording."
ucla,foo9efa,t1_foo0p4a,1587935040.0,ahh maybe I‚Äôll start going to those. I studied a good amount for Chem and Math series but felt fine on the exams. With LS I felt like I did amazing after like 24 hours of studying the week prior and then did horrible on the exams. I think the content is easy but I truly believe the exams either click or they don‚Äôt for you and there isn‚Äôt much you can do if you just don‚Äôt understand the testing format.
ucla,foo96b0,t1_foo6ybv,1587934931.0,So with phlebotomist jobs it is hard! I too have my license and was going to pair that with my EMT to be an ER tech but you need like 200 draws. What I recommend is reaching out to the people you did an externship with and see if they have any spots open. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend applying at hospitals because you usually need like 1-2 years experience or a certain # of draws. I would apply to places like Quest and Lab Corp. Maybe even reach out to who you volunteer with and keep showing your interest in working there.
ucla,fonztmq,t3_g7oopn,1587929719.0,The TAs in the LS 7 series are the worst. I feel like they have no idea what they‚Äôre even talking about and they will often admit to lying to students about answers. Every chem TA I have had was pretty amazing especially Jessica in the 30 series.
ucla,fonzplv,t3_g7dyz9,1587929656.0,Are we sure Powell cat is a he? I coulda sworn it was a she.
ucla,fonz9wq,t1_fonpr45,1587929411.0,"I seriously don‚Äôt understand this. I got straight As in both math and the chem series. And I got a B+ in LS. I thought it was beyond impossible even though I had already self taught all the content for the MCAT. Biology itself can be tough but completely doable, this class, the structure, and the exams were impossible to do well in. I‚Äôd spend hours studying for these classes (completely forgetting about chem 30A/30B) and get Cs on the exams. I think chem 153A is even easier than the LS series."
ucla,fonyrso,t1_folofk6,1587929128.0,Idk why they haven‚Äôt changed it with all the hate it getsüòÇ
ucla,fonyqhs,t3_g85r0h,1587929108.0,The entire LS series
premed,fom1p2b,t1_fols2bg,1587875910.0,Yes I normally do that. But I just started a new type so let‚Äôs pray it goes well.
premed,foklnet,t1_fokl6oc,1587844379.0,Im doing everything in my power to not have my period on my test dateüòÇ
ucla,foklbw2,t3_g7o4sn,1587844205.0,If anyone needs tutoring for 30A/14C or 30B/14D you can dm me:)
ucla,fohv4yi,t1_foee0tw,1587773240.0,I haven‚Äôt gone to an advisor tbh. If you‚Äôre a freshman they give you the last pick of classes and seniors get first pick. You will be fine regardless bc people drop left and right. I have never had a quarter without all the classes i wanted (that being said you probably won‚Äôt get them right away and will have to eagerly wait someone to drop)
ucla,foh0ae3,t1_fog54l5,1587759042.0,"No curve. You should get a B, but with this online format lowering your other points I don‚Äôt know."
ucla,fog2q82,t1_foern01,1587747057.0,"i thought content wise chem is harder, but exam wise LS is like out of the blue and not enough resources to learn what they‚Äôre testing and you‚Äôre pretty much blind sided every time, but chem was always fair and straightforward (hard but fair)"
ucla,fog07ya,t1_foemzuj,1587745879.0,"The online format actually has gotten worse. Usually you can go to discussion and lecture and earn full participation easily. Now it‚Äôs becoming harder and harder to earn full credit and that is one of the biggest things that boosts your grade. I don‚Äôt think this course focuses on learning much but testing. I had already studied biology extensively for the MCAT so almost all of the content was review and I still couldn‚Äôt get much higher than a B- in every test, not to mention I‚Äôd walk out feeling like I did really well then get like a C. With that being said the other course work usually bounces your grade a little bit but this online format is kinda ruining it. I‚Äôd  take it anywhere else if I were you. Bc i will go down in my grave cursing LS7 series üòÇ"
ucla,foel8lx,t1_fo313o0,1587706787.0,Are you crazy LS is the worst serious at UCLA ü§Æ
ucla,foel5np,t3_g57epc,1587706723.0,"Do NOT take the 7 series here at All! It is the worst series offered at UCLA and does not prepare you for the BS tests. As someone who has gotten straight As almost every quarter, done well in any STEM class... this class was a different ball game, no matter the studying, the understanding of concepts, being able to apply concepts, etc this class either clicks or doesn‚Äôt."
ucla,foe0okg,t1_fo9ivwj,1587693740.0,You can pm me too! Finishing up my 3rd year and applying to MD this cycle! UCLA can seem super big and daunting for pre meds but it‚Äôs possible!
ucla,fny5n2f,t3_g3tlls,1587353998.0,Not at all! Usually you don‚Äôt get accepted into both! Keep your head up you just might get an acceptance next Friday or the next week!
ucla,fny59yy,t3_g4efvi,1587353746.0,"Just take the L, nothing in class prepares you for the midterm questions tbh. Some ppl get it some ppl don‚Äôt. Even as a super smart student it might just not click. Do all your other assignments and study what you can, but don‚Äôt be crushed if the midterms and finals don‚Äôt go the way you had hoped... you‚Äôll still get a B/A in the class."
ucla,fnpapfg,t1_fnp9qbm,1587142194.0,"Maybe look into all the online classes being available rn! It won‚Äôt show up on your transcript or give you units but if all you want to do is learn, I‚Äôm sure with the quarantine there are tons of online options rn for cheap(:"
ucla,fnpa3m7,t1_fnoindz,1587141890.0,Yay that‚Äôs good. If I wasn‚Äôt in my UD classes I‚Äôd totally do the same !
ucla,fnnw4t7,t3_g2rme6,1587103580.0,I would say you can take a couple P/NP like one a quarter and I would stick to just your major classes and do NOT take any pre med requirements P/NP bc you will be competing against ppl who took it for a letter grade and it could reflect poorly. They understand the situation so if you take one class P/NP for your major it likely won‚Äôt make a difference at all. (This is coming straight from talking to admissions counselors at top medical schools)
ucla,fnnvvdg,t3_g2vclr,1587103343.0,Careful about taking cc while you should be at UCLA they‚Äôre kinda stingy about that maybe call and ask around and play it off like you actually can‚Äôt return to LA for family or personal issues.
ucla,fn0t7qg,t1_fn0csvv,1586548280.0,I actually love studying! And I‚Äôm currently studying for the MCAT as well as having 20 units so I have a lot or work everyday. But I don‚Äôt mind.
ucla,fmwsnye,t3_fxhtav,1586452330.0,Hey! My MCAT got pushed back and I was supposed to take it in March. Currently have it scheduled for June. Some schools won‚Äôt penalize you whereas others are deciding to make no changes since the application is rolling basis (even tho we all know first come first served). But I‚Äôm here if you wanna y‚Äôall about it haha.
ucla,fmwrspn,t3_fxh2tk,1586451891.0,"Here‚Äôs my day to day life (when things aren‚Äôt quarantined) 
Wake up, make eggos and walk to school 8-9,
School 9-12,
study 12-2,
volunteer/workout/grab lunch 2-3 ,
study 3-6,
eat 6,
study till 10/11,
glass of wine/bar hoping/relax

I‚Äôm a third year psychology, pre med major. To give you reference. When I was doing GEs I didn‚Äôt spend as much time studying but now I consistently study 6-10 hours a day, except when I have research all day then I just give myself a break.

Also add in usual mental breakdowns where I kinda just say F it leave class and go cry myself to sleep for a couple hours. (I think that‚Äôs just a STEM thing tho, I could be wrong)"
ucla,fmwr6xm,t3_fxk0md,1586451586.0,It‚Äôs a scam. I get these too.
ucla,fmwr2rl,t3_fxiovp,1586451528.0,Omg wow
Mcat,fmwqr4g,t1_fmtqz0i,1586451366.0,Because looking at the predicted trend of COVID which decreases tremendously in June for the entire US. I will reschedule as needed if that trend isn‚Äôt unfolding but I didn‚Äôt want to schedule to July and then have tests resume randomly in May or June.
Mcat,fmt75wz,t1_fmqv7ll,1586367946.0,"There is no cycle in August 2020. If you apply August you most likely won‚Äôt get in. Either May 2020, or May 2021. You will need your mcat score way before August for the cycle. If you are applying 2021 don‚Äôt take the MCAT please. People who have been working all year to apply this cycle are struggling and we need all the seats we can get. I would suggest taking it over winter break if you want to be ahead of the game for the 2021 cycle."
Mcat,fmt6vth,t3_fwvc7n,1586367819.0,"AAMC should be the last thing to do, when you‚Äôre happy with your FL scores and pretty much done studying."
Mcat,fmt6n24,t3_fx2qng,1586367709.0,Still applying:) they will be more lenient this year.
Mcat,fmt6j8z,t3_fwy7e0,1586367661.0,"We will still be in quarantine in May, I would reschedule and check for a June date if possible. You don‚Äôt want to get screwed over with an August date in my opinion. I rescheduled bc I figured schools won‚Äôt be as heavily reviewing the first wave of applications and I‚Äôm still submitting it without my MCAT."
Mcat,fmt6c72,t3_fwtizp,1586367569.0,I basically have the same improvement! My goal is to score 510 consistently on FL before taking the MCAT since scores are deflated for Kaplan.
Mcat,fmt5pin,t1_fmt2jwo,1586367281.0,I was may 16th. Changed to June 19th. They will like 95% carry the quarantine into May.
ucla,fmrdfdc,t1_fmrd2de,1586320048.0,They can also visit the dorms but you have to put them on a guest pass or something.
ucla,fmrd90z,t1_fmo2li6,1586319906.0,I love on frat row next to ZBT who parties like everyday. I am a super light sleeper but let me tell you... I sleep like a baby and you definitely get used to it. The 2 min walk to campus = extra 15 min of sleeping in makes it worth the couple nights I get annoyed.
ucla,fmrd05h,t3_fwzlig,1586319717.0,Are you asking during quarantine or in general? For the most part UCLA is open to the public except libraries will require a Bruin card after a certain hour. The gym is also Bruin card access.
ucla,fmqdmhj,t3_flrxhi,1586297632.0,It doesn‚Äôt matter who the professors is. They all say the exact same thing. Be prepared to teach yourself basically everything and use class as review/discussion. Exams are nothing like Launchpad or clicker questions. Idek how I did well bc most of the time I was like wtf???? Worst series at UCLA
ucla,fmqb2tt,t3_fw31s3,1586296276.0,"Hey I transferred last year!

For orientation you will most definitely get screwed over in registering. They decide who enrolls first by choosing a number out of a bag... I got last place and ended up getting only random GEs, no pre requisites, no pre med classes. But don‚Äôt worry I was able to enroll in all the classes I wanted by week 0! 

It is definitely harder than community college but still doable. At JC I was used to getting straight As, in comparison I got one B my first quarter, and straight As last quarter, so it just takes time to adapt. I also recommend to sticking to 3 classes the first quarter especially if you‚Äôre taking 3 hard classes bc it will be a lot to adjust to especially with the quarter system. 

I think the professors are great, I just hate the standardized classes that we have here like LS  for example, because it is hard to actually learn from the professor and their knowledge and is based on learning independently. The LA, CLC, PLF, AAP programs are all great for students who need the extra help and worksheets. My main advice is seriously no procrastinating and keeping up with the work bc when I say it‚Äôs midterm season ALL quarter... I mean it.

Housing options, I have a couple transfer friends living in the dorms. They made good friends and enjoy it there. I prefer my own room so I live off campus which is great! I‚Äôd recommend applying for housing through UCLA as a backup, and looking for a cheaper place to stay and then using UCLA housing as a last resort if you can‚Äôt find an open/cheap place.

Somewhat possible to switch majors within your department. For example I switched from psychology to cognitive science but couldn‚Äôt switch to anything else. So it is per department/school, I would call.

I wish I was told not to take any 8ams or 9ams bc they‚Äôre impossible to go to, even tho I took 6/7ams at community college. Also wish I was told that Trade Joes > everything and saves so much money. Don‚Äôt buy a meal plan if you live off campus it‚Äôs like $12 a meal and I pay like $2-3 a meal in groceries. Budget! Don‚Äôt worry about using every resource available, figure out which ones work best for you otherwise you might be wasting time. If you want to join a frat (professional) say you‚Äôre a sophomore. 

Welcome to the family!"
ucla,fmp84rp,t1_fmo2fpd,1586276195.0,Since it‚Äôs actually the same trend for Italy (ratio wise since the population is less) then yes I actually do.
ucla,fmnrupq,t3_fw7vmo,1586233530.0,Me!
ucla,fmnr028,t3_fvszbd,1586232884.0,"For everyone reading this. Their argument is very well backed up. But they‚Äôre forgetting a couple things. First, we are actually seeing that almost 50% of the infected are asymptomatic (seem completely normal) AND we have a shortage of tests available meaning that our recorded cases is probably extremely deflated and the real case # could be almost double what is being recorded. This could mean that we will probably reach our peak earlier than expected and it will take us less time to recover if we stick to quarantine. Also keep in mind it only took China about 5 months to see a stop in exponential growth (and decline in cases) and about 8-12 weeks in quarantine. Considering their population is MUCH larger than ours if we stick to 8 week quarantine we should be able to resume in Fall and hopefully sooner. We will peak ‚ÄúApril 26th‚Äù and from there we will start to see a decline of cases per day. You can look at Italy‚Äôs trend to get a small idea of how we will be. With all this in mind, I highly doubt that this will continue past this year and there is a very low chance that it will push through into Fall. I believe we will be transitioning out of this around the end of June to beginning of July."
Mcat,fma7z8j,t3_fu0fyg,1585886185.0,Idk it‚Äôs kinda up to you. I personally reschedule from May 16th to June 19th because I figured even if I‚Äôm late schools will understand and I rather not get screwed over with an August test date. This whole thing really sucks but trying to take the opportunity to take care of my body and mental health. I‚Äôm determined to apply this cycle-.-
