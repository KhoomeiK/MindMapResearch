UCSD,fplc37v,t1_fpkupwa,1588710054.0,"I fill out capes religiously but UCSD admin has said that capes won't have much consequence this quarter. I think that's the right thing to do but it's still frustrating sometimes on our end. I'm sure that if we continue to have online classes fall quarter they'll use them for feedback though, but probably not to judge faculty on their performance"
UCSD,fpggpl9,t1_fpfl9wt,1588602356.0,"Wow ECE 111 sounds like the most specific class I've ever heard of, as a non-CS person I have no idea what that means even though I know about Bitcoin"
UCSD,fpgglme,t1_fpftacr,1588602293.0,"But I think it's usually restricted to people who have a research need right? Like you can only take it if you're already signed onto a scientific diving field work project, or maybe it's only prioritized for those people"
SanClemente,fpaqw6r,t3_gbzyx7,1588453833.0,"> James said he for one would not be giving in to the governor’s beach closure.

> “The reason why we’re here is because there’s a despot 450 miles from San Clemente, who’s ruling us like we’re subjects not like we’re citizens,” he said.

> “I’m a citizen, not a subject and this citizen will walk on the beach this weekend.”

Christ, you take away the fucking beach and these idiots think they live in North Korea. Blows my mind people can be this stupid and arrogant."
SSBM,fpacujv,t3_gc8pzc,1588445516.0,"It typically also doesn't work for all-star IIRC 

But I always use it for my emulator all-star attempts because there's no way in hell I'm going to do it without the c-stick"
UCSD,fos60jb,t3_g8nml3,1588024603.0,"I took a drawing class once, I don't think it even showed up on my transcript IIRC. I'm sure I did fine but I don't think it counts for your GPA or anything."
LudwigAhgren,fokhfci,t3_g7vwl7,1587842124.0,Thanks for the great content Lud. Been loving the monkeyball streams.
UCSD,fnqu44i,t3_g39jb7,1587172267.0,"Hanging out getting schwasted at my friend's place in Sixth and then skating all the way back to ERC at 1 in the morning 

Got confused when a couple girls walking the opposite direction were heading straight at me then I saw they were avoiding this *chungus* raccoon that was on the side of the trail 

I laughed cause of how tubby the raccoon was and then they started laughing too because they heard me 

I miss the trashpandas so much, maybe I should go to campus late one night just to find them"
UCSD,fnq10ym,t1_fnpyvmy,1587155648.0,Everyone does it but we try not to make it look obvious for the people on the other side

SSBM,fn4vgnu,t1_fn4gl8g,1586649852.0,Well in the Google doc it describes how he manipulated/sexually harrassed/raped a past girlfriend (most likely) and apparently also dated a 15 year old as a 28/29 year old.
Eyebleach,fn4lctl,t1_fn42ngb,1586643752.0,"That's where we found him on the first morning after adoption, then we figured out there's actually an opening on the side of the cabinet. We thought he climbed through and then closed the door behind himself somehow because we didn't find him for like ten minutes! But he hasn't crawled in there for a while although he still likes to spend a lot of time under my bed"
