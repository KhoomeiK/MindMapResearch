Mid-size classes that can fit 100 people into a 400 person classroom, maybe in person. Classes like labs and studios with specialized equipment, probably in person or move them to a later quarter if possible, when things might be better."

pelotoncycle,fovjv5n,t1_fovfkdg,1588102549.0,"So we got it maybe 1 week after shelter in place started and just days after they changed the delivery methods. So at first they said they'd bring it into the door of your unit. Then change it to inside the door of the building. So I was like oh hell, this is a damn bike, how will my wife and I be able to to find grip points to carry this thing up? So I just gave it a shot and once I was in motion it just kinda went.

But yeah, if you're a tiny human, no chance."
pelotoncycle,fovjjx2,t1_fovgjno,1588102397.0,By the time I got it up to the 3rd floor wheeling it into place was the hardest part. You have to tip it so far to get it on the wheels!
pelotoncycle,foveagz,t3_g9s6xl,1588099871.0,"Delivery Tip: If you have to carry it up stairs as I did, it's possible to do it by yourself. I'm a 30 y/o male who never does strength training (that is until I've subscribed to Peloton), to give you perspective. The unit without the screen is \~120 pounds. There's an opening just above the wheel that you can grab on to with one hand and hold the handlebar with the other to bring it up stairs. I was able to carry it up 3 flights of stairs in about 10 minutes (took a couple of breaks and didn't want to ding up the walls). But it was pretty smooth."
CollegeBasketball,fojx9r8,t1_fojv9ua,1587831253.0,Even when the “Self to the Spurs” business was happening this year people were trying to justify “we’ll maybe if Danny had the prestige of a Kansas to recruit to he could be successful.”

Edit: As assistant, sure. But this “Manning could take over for Self” business is garbage."

UniversityofKansas,fn21w6p,t1_fn1iz67,1586575676.0,I can’t imagine. We’d run the AC during the winter to counter the nonstop steam heat.

UniversityofKansas,fn1ie9e,t3_fyqdv7,1586562660.0,"Congrats! I also lived in Pearson (BA 2011) and was the Proctor for two years. Proctors are sort of the RA's for the building. I generally referred to myself a Housing Tool.

Anyway, yes, all scholarship halls have a communal kitchen and pantry. You can eat whatever you want, whenever you want, so long as the item isn't specifically for a meal that week. There's always snacks like mini frozen pizzas, microwavable Mac and cheese, granola bars, etc.

In the last couple years they also renovated the hall's guts. They redid the bathrooms and plumbing, and also replaced the steam heat and window AC units with central heating and air. You kids don't know how good you have it these days because that steam heat don't quit.

As for your friend, it doesn't mean he's declined per se, it just means they've moved on to other applications. They send them out in waves. If he ends up not getting in, tell him to call housing and ask to be put on the waitlist for the scholarship halls. People ultimately end up not coming over the summer, or they switch out, or at worst, people graduate in December and he can move over then.

Anyway, you'll love it. I lived there 4 years. If you have any questions about it reply and I'll help out."
BabyBumps,fmwxesn,t3_fxt3x6,1586454723.0,Yes! We did the same thing. We were initially doing baths in the kitchen sink with the bath lotus and couldn't figure out why sometimes the babe was fine and others not. Realized when we had just made dinner that either required the oven or boiling water or something it was better. After a month or so we switched to the more normal little baby bathtub and steamed up the bathroom before hand. After a bit we were able to back off steaming it up pre-bath because the small bath plus body heat with a closed door seemed to do fine for our very small bathroom.

Self may be .1 miles closer, but you have to walk back up the hill the other way. They're pretty much the same distance so don't let that sway you. It's a beautiful campus, be out and enjoy it."
