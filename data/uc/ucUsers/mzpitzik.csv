ucla,fpl6340,t1_fpkxivd,1588707022.0,"people run for office to compete on ideas. and i hear you on the laptop concern, but that’s just not what Brandon’s plan seeks to assist with.

it’s not millions of dollars that the candidate is trying to help with, it’s using extensive data that the candidate has presented to retool funds in a way that stops the misuse of fees in order to alleviate some of the rent burden for as many people as possible, which means maybe you’d have some extra money saved up from rent to use for laptop fixes.

We have chargers (albeit we need more sometimes) that you can take out at libraries, and we have ports all over campus in convenient locations.

What Brandon want’s to implement is inconvenient charging hubs like at the rosebowl, he wrote a lengthy letter in support of CUB so him and Emily lack no difference there, but one of them has intuitive plans to support student workers, and lower rent."

ucla,fpkvt5p,t1_fpkv99f,1588701907.0,"charging stations would be thoroughly expensive, appealing to a business is not a plan.

retooling mismanaged budgets and utilizing mutual aid networks to alleviate rent burdens is a plan."
ucla,fpkpa95,t1_fpj6vlw,1588698675.0,"Brandon’s plans do not actually reflect transparency, his office has been arguably the least transparent USAC space. He want’s to raise student fees, including his plans to implement charging stations, (he claims he will convince businesses to just give them to us, but has a plan to raise fees if that fails). Adding charging stations doesn’t meet any actual need in our community beyond being shiny. We have many charging ports already, this isn’t a role of an IVP and doesn’t address any core problems. His plans to reform USAC tend to come out of places of self interest rather than general concern for democracy or knowledge of legal precedent surrounding transparency and access."

the other group doesn’t like one specific fee, has platforms that literally violate the constitutional process and california law OH and everyone copy and pasted the others platforms. (CCI)"
