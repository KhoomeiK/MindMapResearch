FZ07,fpkhboh,t3_fyt4vw,1588694696.0,Any luck putting it on? Did you ever figure out what was the issue?
Yamaha,fpkc334,t1_fpf37g9,1588691950.0,You should be able to actuate the clutch cable above the clutch case :)
CR10,fpkbp4z,t3_gdxa87,1588691746.0,"I remember my first time printing PETG - it was awful.   


You can always try printing:

  
\- Hotter

\- Slower

\- Wider (more adhesion)

\- With minimal glue stick (some; the glue stick is just to prevent permanent adhesion/bonding of the PETG to the glass. it's counterintuitive)."
HondaRebel300,fphkacf,t3_gd6hg5,1588622769.0,"Sounds like everyone here really covered everything. One other thing might be height - I know there are a few taller riders here (5'10""+), but a lot of my taller friends really hated being on the Rebel because it was so uncomfortable. It was like a gorilla on a toy bike. One thing to consider if you're looking into them.   


Other than that its been a blast to ride. Haven't done much upgrades besides sliders. I've had mine for 2 years but already starting to move on, mostly due to the power and  I wanted something taller (I'm 5'6"" and I got tired of the couch). Like others said, it can struggle at highway speeds unless you do a sprocket change."
DMV,fpee3i7,t3_fu1o8f,1588545725.0,"Any luck with your registration? I'm in CA with a sinilar situation, although i filled out and paid all the transfer forms online."
FZ07,fpba04e,t1_fpb91fd,1588465316.0,"That's what I figured. Oh well, maybe I'll look into the prices and see how mucb it would cost to do, the bike has some sentimental value. Thanks for the info. 

I was thinking ""There's no way that they use a different dash for abs/non abs versions.... It would be chealer to just use the same one and remove the LED!"" Went outside to check, and sure enough theres no ABS indicator on the dash - Yamaha did a good job. I wonder if there's still a LED under the screen itself snd if they just swap that panel out while retaining the same parts for everything else."
FZ07,fpb8pvo,t1_fpb3nu6,1588464509.0,"That's what I've heard, but it seemed like it would be less difficult/expensive since theres already an abs version of the bike, no?"
NintendoSwitch,fp4t0k9,t1_fnwtwlp,1588306634.0,"Look into larger nozzles! I run most of my printers with a 0.8mm nozzle or larger, and the rest with either 0.4 or 0.25. They are essential for larger prints."
HondaRebel300,fozorqj,t3_gacni9,1588194236.0,"When I did my oil, I purchased the 'kit' on Amazon for the rebel. Came with filter, oil, and I think the crush washer. I was surprised that Amazon delivers oil - that's one route if you want to do that. Just be sure that there's a place to dispose of the oil after. 

I'm in an apartment in socal and take the bike to my dealer to do even basic stuff like oil changes - it's a pain to deal with here otherwise."
FZ07,foxjvqq,t3_fww8wb,1588146295.0,"Socal here, got a quote for around 500 for oil, sparkplugs and throttle body sync."
FZ07,foxj7zr,t1_foszpy2,1588145689.0,"Huh, cool feedback, thanks! I put off the mod because I figured it would be less safe if anything, but glad to hear the opposite.

Back in my cart it goes..."
FZ07,foxivfr,t1_fovt0wp,1588145381.0,"Same, but 4 inches for me and for 2 seconds.

Are we talking about the same thing?"
FZ07,foxiqw8,t3_g93ktc,1588145265.0,"I have the 2017 fz07 without abs. There's also the abs version that came out that year. In theory i should be able to add abs to my bike by going to somewhere like yamaha parts housr and picking up all the components.... Right?

I'm sure that's simplifying it a bit but I was curious if that was possible. I'm sure it's not cost effective but I also don't want to sell my bike for another"
FZ07,foxilde,t1_fosdsnq,1588145125.0,Do you have the high flow air filter? Those two mods wont help ad much if there's that bottleneck

Kawasaki,foslgti,t1_foslebk,1588033052.0,38624.27 km
Kawasaki,fosldwl,t1_fornlvj,1588033006.0,"Good to hear. Just picked up a FZ07 and was considering trading my rebel 500 in for a sport bike. The used one has 24000 miles (38600km) so I might definitely consider new for that price. There's only one dealer near me so that kind of jacks the price up a bit, but we'll see."
Kawasaki,fora80f,t1_foqqdtx,1588008804.0,How's the 07? I'm pretty conflicted between the new 650 (in white too!) and a used 07 650 from the dealership ($4K).
bikesgonewild,foiroqv,t3_g7jx1e,1587794844.0,Super cool. Really refreshing to see
FZ07,foe28ez,t1_focuaxv,1587694597.0,"You're better off getting any other used small displacement bike, like a used ninja 300 or sv650. Groms make normal bikes feel gigantic and you cam pick up some bad habits that don't transfer well to normal bikes."
FZ07,fo8m4p4,t3_g6ae3l,1587599258.0,"I'm in the same situation now minus the exhaust. I'm looking at shelling out around 900 for the akrapovic exhaust, plus 300? For an ecu tune. Take the one with exhaust for sure!!

Or, maybe you could bargain the other guy down using the other posting...."
bonehurtingjuice,fo536th,t1_fo51j5x,1587516521.0,no
motorcycles,fo26zyd,t3_g55g7b,1587451737.0,"I'm about to be in a similar boat! Picking up a fz07, coming from a rebel 500. Granted, both are much much smaller bikes than the fz10!"
3Dprinting,fo16tqi,t3_g51xch,1587426934.0,Love the cheesegrater design. I failed pretty spectacularly when trying to model something like that up in Fusion.

diycnc,fnamopu,t3_g0n22u,1586800147.0,"boltdepot if i need low quantities but a lot of different bolts, or mcmaster. Boltdepot has been a lot cheaper."
HondaRebel300,fn5h8ma,t1_fn5f5ex,1586664806.0,"No, that's the bit that doens't turn on. I'll check out the wire harness. What's the issue with it? Does it just come loose or something?"
UCSantaBarbara,fn59fct,t1_fn4lk1a,1586659135.0,"Accidentally posted the same question as the one you replied to, but yikes! Good luck! Granted, I didn't learn much from boiling tea to get the caffeine from it, but hopefully they implement some tuition changes because of the lack of reagents needed for those labs . . ."

HondaRebel300,fn55kfp,t3_fyshw2,1586656454.0,"I'm trying to sell my 500abs and the local dealership said theyd buy it back for around 3.4k. However they were upfront in saying that i could probably sell it direct for around 4.5-5k. With that said, maaaybe you can get lucky for the 500 but i dont think it will be for any less than  4.5k or so"
HondaRebel300,fn55ewl,t1_fmmyq4k,1586656349.0,I really want to get a different rear fender to get rid of the brick and turn dingles but most of the options just look too dim / too unnoticeable.

UCSantaBarbara,fmpu1ke,t1_fmmwole,1586287331.0,"Better than nothing!  


I'm not in touch with the school schedule now, but if you wanted to, it wouldn't hurt to try to reach out to your PI and talk about 199 units (assuming you don't get that already). Propose doing a research proposal based around the labs research or something along those lines, with supporting papers (obviously). Its an unusual time, so they may be up for it, and its the next closest thing to working in a lab. Similarly, it prepares you for when you get back..."
CR10,fmptqqs,t1_fmpsmnd,1586287174.0,"Lets just say that I've put off buying the whambam kit for WAY too long. Got one a month ago after owning the 10s pro for...i dont know, years now? and it is awesome. Not sure what took me so long, especially after having the one on the MK3S. Ended up buying several more for my other machines.   


Main downside now is that most of the whambam shipments are a bit delayed, but thats to be expected with the GLOBAL PANDEMIC going on."
3Dprinting,fmps9ef,t1_fmp7lwd,1586286403.0,"Completely agree. I quickly realized how expensive it was printing off face shield components (granted it was the prusa version which uses much more material). A little over 140 shields was close to 6 rolls of PETG. Factoring in the cost of electricity (CA), plastic film, elastic,  foam, and SHIPPING, it was just not sustainable to continue donations."
CR10,fmpckta,t3_fwmejq,1586278432.0,"Great work! I have to say, I put a BL touch on my cr10s pro and it is a night and day difference.  Would do it again in a heartbeat."
UCSantaBarbara,fmlv60l,t1_fmjuw2r,1586193813.0,"Hopefully. In the meantime, maybe the university will crack down on some of the labs having to come in...most of them are not 'essential.'"
UCSantaBarbara,fmjip5l,t1_fmjdj26,1586131102.0,I don't know and im guessing not since most undergrads and grad students arent considered 'essential'. There's a lot of associate scientists and researchers that are still working (as well as grad students) but i doubt they want to take on the added liability.
