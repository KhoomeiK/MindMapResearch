Biden doesn't do that *at all*. The only reason to vote Biden (**and it's a good one**) is to get Trump out. Biden winning doesn't help the movement. His austerity policies aren't going to *help* workers. Best case is he doesn't hurt people as much as Trump--that's *it* (and again, that's a good thing).

The piece wasn't written by Marx and isn't about revolution (way to just read the url). It was written by Hal Draper, an American socialist, in 1967 about the 1968 election and specifically addressing ""Lesser Evilism"" and is incredibly prescient given his conclusion on what ""lesser evil voting"" is going to do in 1968 and *where we're at today*:

>[W]e increasingly are getting this third type of case: the Lesser Evils who, as executors of the system, find themselves acting at every important juncture exactly like the Greater Evils, and sometimes worse. They are the product of the increasing convergence of liberalism and conservatism under conditions of bureaucratic capitalism. There never was an era when the policy of the Lesser Evil made less sense than now.

If you don't see how perfectly this encapsulates the Democratic party, then I'm not sure why you're posting in the DSA subreddit.

It seems as though you want to argue that *voting* is good--I'm not going to disagree. Voting is good. 

But ""Lesser Evil"" voting specifically is, at best, a *harm reduction* strategy, not a ""get what you want"" strategy. Every ""Lesser Evil"" candidate we've had has taken *our vote* and used it to *still do evil*. That's why it's called *lesser evil* and not *good*.

I'm **not** saying ""don't vote for Biden"" (not my place to tell people how to vote), I'm saying that this strategy *has to be seen for what it is*, not given some rose colored tint of ""lesser evil voting is why you can enjoy your lunch sitting next to a black kid in a *BLM* hat at a restaurant owned by a woman."""
dsa,fp4jxl7,t1_fp4fyw0,1588300686.0,"None of those things are the result of lesser-evil voting and most have no connection to ""the last 40 years of lesser evil voting.""

1. Women are rapidly *losing* their ability to have an abortion due to conservative judges being appointed by conservative politicians. So this seems like a poor example to choose, especially since Roe v Wade was decided in 1973, so that has nothing to do with the last 40 years except that abortion rights have been steadily curtailed over that time of Lesser Evil voting.

2. Black Lives Matter is a result of *police and random citizens murdering black people and facing no repercussions*.

3. Marriage equality is a result of agitation by the LGBTQ community and grassroots organizing, not ""lesser evil"" voting.

4. ""Lunch counters"" (i.e., desegregation) was accomplished by civil rights protests and unrest, not ""lesser evil"" voting. This was also nearly 60 years ago.

5. Women can be CEOs. This was also part of the Civil Rights Act, which was not ""lesser evil"" voting, but organizing and protests. Again, nearly 60 years ago.

Lesser evil voting can be cited for some reasons (like, we'll maybe have *less* kids in concentration camps with a Biden presidency), but these are bad examples and are really overstating the importance of electoralism and social change.

Edit, to be clear: I'm not telling people not to vote for Biden.

But this plane/train/automobile is already headed toward disaster. There is no choice in this election that helps. A Biden presidency will be *at best* an Obama 2.0 (I don't even believe that), whose free-market liberalism and abandonment of working people during the recession is why we have Trump.

Bernie's campaign was just a litmus test to see how the country will handle the upcoming challenges and it looks like we're going full fascist. All those years of propaganda did their job."

Nice to be part of the elite 5% of redditors. 

That said, a sub-20 minute 5k? Nah, not even close.

A sub-20 minute 5k means you're doing 6:45/mile. Definitely achievable with consistent work, but not a ""couch to 5k"" time for the vast vast majority of the population.

That's all I'm saying here.

I truly believe that the dems want to lose. They don't want to be given the keys to the car when it's already headed off a cliff. 

The party only wants to protect itself, not help people, and they are more interested in being ""the alternative"" than in having to actually do what it would take to solve this crisis.

Thank you. Too many people are too quick to forget how many corpses are on the US's hands due to Bush's adventurism.

Trump is awful, but he doesn't have the bodies that Bush has. I don't know Obama's body count either, so who knows where that falls, but I *do* know that we didn't get the ""Nobel Peace Prize"" president we were promised. 

And then it was followed up by Trump, almost as if voting for these liberal sycophants of capital exacerbate the negatives of the system and enable the right to gain more power.
