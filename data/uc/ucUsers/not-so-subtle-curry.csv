Totally agree with this gateway drugs comparison. For the longest time I only watched Gourmet Makes episodes. Then I began watching It's Alive - starting with the first one that had Claire in it. Seeing glimpses of the other chefs in these two shows lured me into watching the other content on the channel. Now I watch most of the BA videos. Gourmet Makes is still my favourite though :)

Also I'd like to add: I was introduced to Gourmet Makes through a video on the Try Guys channel in which they spoke about their favourite YouTubers. Eugene spoke highly of Claire and the show, so I knew I had to check it out. 

Wondering if there's anyone else on here who was introduced to BA through the Try Guys?"

But that has never come in the way of our relationship. I think this is largely due to the efforts she's put into ensuring our relationship never goes sour. She gave me a lot of room to grow and become my own person as I entered my teens. She was understanding of the fact that I was changing and was not her sweet and obedient little girl anymore. However, while she gave me my space, she also kept reassuring me that I could share anything with her without fearing judgement. She gave me the safe space to vent out when I felt like and without that I think I would've grown distant from my mother in my teen years. 

TL;DR: my mom gave me space to grow as an individual and gave me a judgement-free space to discuss literally anything I wanted to."

It's really hard to study with all the uncertainty in the world right now. I'm really hoping professors are easy with grading this quarter, otherwise I'm screwed."
