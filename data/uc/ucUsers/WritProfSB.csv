You’re looking for ways to have students get involved and participate. You know that learning happens way beyond just delivering information from the professor to one student, but in discussing ideas, thinking about things, engaging critically. I as the professor do not have all the answers, and there is a ton of value in interacting with how other people are working with the information, their experiences, the connections they make, etc.!

Try to use these assignments as chances to do that, not just to find long ways to type ‘I agree.’ Really think about what your peers are bringing to the table. Work with the ideas, extend them, question them. If you do it that way, I promise it’s a good way to help better understand the material. And also your professors will love that you’re actually engaging with the work and responding well."
