UCSC,fp048jf,t1_fozzjub,1588202185.0,Great thank you!
UCSC,fozksg9,t3_gagsma,1588192319.0,we are halfway through the quarter
UCSC,foowpeh,t3_g8mvds,1587948068.0,"Freshman here, pretty much hated dorms lol. They are way too expensive (even for a reg. triple) and is not worth it, in my opinion. If you go on the Facebook housing group, there are so many great deals in some pretty nice houses/apartments off campus close to ucsc. I found a job that I love off campus and I am really excited for when I live close to downtown and feel less restricted being secluded in the forest. Don't get me wrong, I love the campus a lot but it is not the most convenient for living."

innout,fohixqc,t1_fogeeaz,1587766732.0,"Obviously I‚Äôd rather earn my money, but since my in n out hours are cut so drastically, I literally can‚Äôt afford to work there and not be on unemployment"
innout,fohiptf,t1_fogl5wl,1587766649.0,"They don‚Äôt offer it though, I‚Äôm a temporary associate and I just come back on the schedule when I ask."
innout,fofviwd,t1_fofvdrv,1587743558.0,"Definitely, hopefully our DR will be open and I can get some normal hours again. I work at the 10th busiest store, have completely open availability and still struggling :/"
airpods,fnysg6b,t1_fnymiwr,1587373947.0,Lmaoo also I put ‚Äúpods‚Äù in the title not ‚Äúairpods‚Äù
UCSC,fny6cjq,t1_fny3jz6,1587354496.0,"Thanks for the suggestion! With my work being off campus, I‚Äôve made a lot of friends from there and I spend a lot of my time off campus with people. Im moving in with upper classmen who have a house at a decent rent (way cheaper than a dorm is monthly) and since I work almost full time and trying to graduate as debt free is possible, this is the best option for me :)"
UCSC,fny68xw,t1_fny5mju,1587354425.0,"I know what you mean, but I work at a big daycare off campus and most of my friends are from work and we have a great time. I spent like all of my time off campus this year and it was a struggle lol"
UCSC,fny21u0,t3_g4jith,1587351511.0,"I think this is such an interesting take, I'm a freshman and I am soo excited to live off campus next year. I hated feeling isolated and paying a ton of money to be in the middle of a forest far away from civilization"
airpods,fnvb5pw,t1_fnvb4gp,1587286695.0,Because I thought it was funny and this sub is the closest thing. They don‚Äôt have an AirPod knockoff sub yet :)
airpods,fnvb2rp,t1_fnvb26h,1587286607.0,Said ‚Äúpods‚Äù not airpods :)

DaveRamsey,fnlh9st,t1_fnlg26h,1587053528.0,"Ah yes, a $1,200 expected to last people for 10 weeks is gonna make the biggest of difference"
UCSC,fnjtx22,t1_fnjse53,1587006906.0,"Definitely, I personally wouldn‚Äôt want to do that but it really depends on the schedule and type of person somebody is"
Broadway,fnjts50,t1_fnjizux,1587006817.0,I completely agree.
UCSC,fnjs2fh,t1_fnicp7c,1587005679.0,"If my roommate is being vocal about drug use in the room to the point of getting caught, you know damn well I'm gonna ""act like a boomer about it"" because I'm not tryna get blamed for that shit"
UCSC,fnjrugq,t1_fnjksja,1587005534.0,"I mean, if you had class every day M-F (which you probably won't every quarter), that's about $280 a month, which is not even close to the costs of dorms/rent."
Broadway,fnhizxh,t1_fnhd74n,1586963296.0,"It appears to be the same comment, just edited."
Broadway,fngfq2h,t1_fngf3ds,1586930813.0,"Thank you, That means a lot. I messaged you and it would mean the world to me if you could look at it"
CollegeMajors,fng9qyu,t3_g1l0id,1586925910.0,"I think it's a great and growing industry, with the rise of social media and new journalism platforms. As long as you can utilize college to network with others and gain real-world experience, it is definitely a marketable major. It is also helpful if you can spend a summer in a big city (unless you live near one), since cities are where most communications/PR jobs are."
Broadway,fng4nib,t1_fng33mn,1586922226.0,I think because it‚Äôs a hobby. A lot of them do this stuff for fun anyway and they‚Äôre like might as well give it to someone I admire for them to appreciate
Broadway,fnfix8a,t1_fnfgsv7,1586908932.0,Are you sure fans just haven't bought them all already? People on instagram were talking about the items they bought.
Broadway,fnbxpqd,t3_g0ukdi,1586824408.0,I hope Sabrina can stay with Mean Girls for at least a little bit longer.
TheCircleUS,fnbwcu3,t3_g0noif,1586823627.0,"I thought it was lowkey hypocritical Shubham gave Sean so much shit for being a catfish, even though she came clean like a day later. And then when Seaburn exposes himself, Shubham is super cool with it. As much as Shubham claimed to hate social media, he sure was having a lot of fun with it and got super excited every time he was put in a group chat or got messaged lol"
UCSC,fmvt79s,t3_fxnt2h,1586429976.0,"Literally horrible,, could not be worst"
MeanGirlsMusical,fmumoh2,t3_fxipmv,1586394423.0,"I have broadway OBC on mega, would be down to trade for DC"
Broadway,fmuioaz,t3_fxh4ky,1586392167.0,Mean Girl confirmed Sabrina intends to return to the show when broadway reopens. They don‚Äôt have exact dates as of now.
santacruz,fmqxngc,t1_fmqwnqm,1586309295.0,I don‚Äôt believe so. I think current permit-holders receive an email when it does come out. I‚Äôm not getting one next year (I‚Äôll be eligible to park on campus) so I can PM you when I get it. Should be some time in May.
santacruz,fmq82gs,t1_fmphnrt,1586294623.0,"Correct, that‚Äôs for 2019-20. The 2020-21 application hasn‚Äôt come out yet."
santacruz,fmnwj21,t3_fwcpgr,1586237375.0,"Ignore what everyone is saying. I am a freshman and park at a church next to the base of campus. I like having a car and I find it worth it. I park at the Peace United Church of Christ UCSC lot for $600. The application comes out next month for next year's permit, so keep a lookout! I'm down to answer any questions you have."
UCSC,fmmjv6j,t3_fw5l5t,1586206595.0,Absolutely ridiculous. I‚Äôm so excited to live off campus next year.
UCSC,fmjycxg,t1_fmion80,1586140246.0,Isn‚Äôt that what a leave of absence is for
