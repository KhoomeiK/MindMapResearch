StarWars,fpihaej,t1_fpih3dd,1588640886.0,Good questions for another time.
StarWars,fpfqus0,t3_gd7cvk,1588580204.0,"Having watched rebels, I didn’t know what to feel.  I didn’t know what he who shall not be named actually felt, especially since we don’t know exactly when this scene takes place.

IMO it was much sadder seeing the clones become mindless stormtroopers & throwing away their lives just to kill a person who felt no ill will towards them. Jesse’s betrayal especially was heartbreaking seeing as just two episodes ago, Ahsoka saved him from Maul."

StarWars,fp8ypbs,t3_gc1h8c,1588407720.0,"I watched the first few seasons of TCW before watching the prequels & I loved them. Didn’t really get the hate for most of the characters, especially Anakin. He was adorable in the Phantom Menace & in Attack of the Clones it was pretty clear he was going through a developmental phase. Both seemed fairly consistent with his TCW portrayal.

The only movie that felt off to me was episode 3. The opening of the movie highlighting Anakin’s maturation seemed weird given how mature he was in TCW, the clones & Anakin betraying the Jedi made no sense to me since they were shown to be extremely tight in the show, and Grievous’s interactions with Obi wan didn’t seem right either. Out of all the Star Wars movies, this was the one I want retconned the most to help it for better w/ TCW.

For the most part, I like the show more than the movies, but I don’t think the show “fixed” the movies like most others believe. The plots of the movies are really easy to follow & most of the scenes stood well on their own. The characterization in the movies for the protagonist was also mostly easy to follow. TCW just adds a lot of meat to the foundation presented in episodes 1 & 2."
UCI,fp8n701,t3_gc0k1g,1588396893.0,Yeah I'm experiencing the same issue.
StarWars,fp6aeu8,t1_fp5svjm,1588348939.0,The Clone Wars being canceled in the first place was Disney’s own fault though.
StarWars,fp6a5ny,t1_fp570vq,1588348811.0,Didn’t long-time Star Wars fans say the exact same thing when the prequels came out?
StarWars,fp68va1,t3_gbg611,1588348167.0,"Honestly, I think the time to capitalize on the sequels with mainstream content is too late, especially since it ended on whimper (according to critics).

If the sequels are capitalized on, it would be with new characters loosely associated with the main heros. I may be in the minority, but the fact that the empire is in control of the galaxy in the OT and ST drastically limits storytelling potential for the main casts since they always have to be on the run from the empire. The Jedi being the dominating party in the prequel era allowed for a variety of storylines."
StarWars,fp57i72,t3_gbdcay,1588318999.0,"Wasn't a fan of the editing of the ROTS dialogue. Just sounds really jarring to hear Hayden Christensen's voice  along with Matt Lanter's voice.

Still episode was pretty fantastic overall, though the maul fight scenes were insanely brutal. Ironic that he did better than Ahsoka despite having no weapon."
FireEmblemHeroes,foe7u6w,t1_foah718,1587697793.0,What about Ingrid’s grandma?
UCI,fo94s7n,t3_g69d0l,1587610534.0,This is exactly the reason why I don’t pay attention to what’s happening in other classes.
StarWars,fo4iqnj,t3_g5bf7c,1587505156.0,"Disagree. In Revenge of the Sith, the intro portion is much more powerful as a continuation of the other two movies because it shows Anakin’s maturity much better. He still has fun here & there but isn’t naively innocent or irritably lashing out anymore. In TCW however, he is mature from the start of the series, diminishing the impact of the intro.

Some of Obiwan’s speeches also work better as a continuation of the movies, like his Chosen one speech at the end of the film, or his praise to Anakin (calling back to Qui gon in episode I).

IMO TCW works better as a continuation of the first two movies, since it heavily borrows & fleshes out concepts like the clones, the Jedi’s adventures during the Clone Wars, the Clones’ relationship w/ the Jedi, etc, However, it threads some iffy ground to connect with the third movie, like control chips, Anakin’s character (a bit too nice in TCW), etc. Not a knock against the show, but these are just the trappings of prequels / mid-quels (iirc TCW would followed a slightly different narrative than the movie to account for these issues but that went defunct when Disney initially bought Lucasfilm)."
StarWars,fny1lbk,t3_g4et94,1587351208.0,"I don’t think so, only because there isn’t as big of a transmedia push for the sequels as there were for the prequels.

The prequels has a ton of books, comics, TV Shows, and Games to flesh out its era and make people truly fall in love with the world. It helps that a lot of this stuff wasn’t needed to understand the movies, but it complemented them nicely & made some scenes more powerful.

The sequels have books & Comics, but barely any TV Shows or Video Games to work off of. Additionally, some reading is required to understand key plot points in the film."
StarWars,fnxzf6x,t3_g4jzh9,1587349757.0,"At the very least she should meet up w/ Luke. 

If she appears in the Mandalorian, she should die in an effort to protect some group from the empire (possibly baby yoda’s village). Her death doesn’t need to be grand; she just needs to be protecting & upholding her ideals like Luke in TLJ. She should fight & protect the people."

FireEmblemHeroes,fno3pma,t1_fnnwi6u,1587110921.0,The effectiveness is nothing new. It’s similar to Astra Blade.
FireEmblemHeroes,fno32de,t1_fnni7wb,1587110257.0,The fact that it’s on a 4 star focus unit should speak volumes.
FireEmblemHeroes,fmnriz5,t1_fmnnyeo,1586233280.0,"In this case, the +3 res seems very useful. Makes it easier for him to run ploys / sabatoge skills so he can double down on his role as a supportive unit."
FireEmblemHeroes,fmnc96w,t1_fmlh3l2,1586222813.0,"Renewal 3 or Mystic Boosts + lull Atk / res would be cool imo. Would give him stronger defensive builds. He’ll still be worse that Tharja, but it at least gives him something unique."
FireEmblemHeroes,fmkbn1u,t3_fvqx6z,1586149808.0,"Midori’s bow seems pretty OP for an inheritable weapon, especially on a fast archer with Noontime like Norne."
