BreadTube,fovxwis,t1_fovwdwb,1588109457.0,"You can add him on Facebook he's a super nice guy and recently got into some legal trouble due to driving under the influence, but he apologized for it."
BreadTube,fovxkcg,t1_fovwjx9,1588109284.0,"No he read Plato's republic and got interested in politics so he researched online and found a lot of evidence for him that he could be more free outside nk. You can research the liberty in North Korea advocacy fellows, he was one of them."
BreadTube,fovxaqf,t1_fovshw1,1588109148.0,"I just watched some of it and I think that this may be true for some, however many go to the United States instead of South Korea and a lot of women are stuck in the Chinese human trafficking market. 

I do think tragic things do happen in North Korea, however there may be some North Korean defectors that have been reeducated when they reach South Korea because they are required by law to. Those reeducation programs may be involved with what the video talks about and training defectors to further south Korean propaganda.

Basically I can only say that from who I have talked to personally they left because of lack of freedom and lack of economic prospects."
BreadTube,fovbbxi,t1_fov9afh,1588098465.0,"I work with liberty in North Korea and as a result I have a lot of guest speakers come that are from North Korea.

BreadTube,fov5ter,t1_fov3rg0,1588095856.0,"Yeah that's true your completely right. I just know they say a lot of bad stuff happened and they had to be careful not to do things like listen to radio or do certain things we in the west never think twice about.

Some have seen multiple generations get punished for one person breaking the law."
BreadTube,fov0g15,t3_g9n6cq,1588093367.0,"I've met a lot of North Korean refugees through my work and they are all super nice, but left for a reason. Some were high ranking and left because they found books about freedom and politics during their time abroad. North Koreans have cell phones with their own version of angry birds and the black market that is forming is a major reason food is distributed in an more equal way.

I'm not saying everything the us says about nk is right but there are are a lot of stuff that is."
