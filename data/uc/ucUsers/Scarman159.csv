Having to deal with all these issues early on will really darken your perspective on life. Also, sometimes it really isn't easy to find help that you need. 
But all is not lost. Part of the advantages of being young is not making the mistakes of those older than you, and having lots of time to still reshape the mind. Give some of the school resources a try for mental help, and in the meantime make yourself busy with your studies and hobbies. You may not have many options right now, but you can create your own oasis to feel normal again in your work or whatever you find as a safe space. If you can make it through the hard times, than you will be able to overcome everything life has to throw at you. I am sorry you ha e to go through this, your issues are real and will require the work to make it through them. Believe in that, and keep moving forward."
SuicideWatch,fpcgs5h,t3_gck538,1588500065.0,"One of my biggest dilemmas was the idea of when we die, we just start right back at the beginning of the story of our lives. An exact repeat, over and over, never ending. One of the few fears in life that keeps me from the edge."
SuicideWatch,fp5lhx2,t3_gbfgd1,1588333494.0,"Sometimes it really is like that, some people just stroke their own ego by pretending to relate and saying dumb shit like ""just get help lol"". It angers me how big the gap can be for lonely people and the rest of the world, all so damn joyful. But there are a lot of people who do go through the same lonliness, who do relate and do care. Fsr and few. 
There are many that feel the same way, like the world is lonely. And that is their reality, so its reasonable to be angry about. And thats the thing that keeps my lonely ass going: my searing hate and envy kinds drives me to keep moving forward with my goals in the hopes of one day being able to close the gap and say fuck you to all of their faces."

aftergifted,fp4ycrp,t3_gavej9,1588310699.0,"As a current undergrad, I have been fearing this for years. I do, however, feel like that reaching an education like master's means you probably are underselling yourself a lot here. Even if you don't know the fundamentals like the textbooks say, you have clearly shown an ability to think critically and reason through all the problems to reach such a level."
Paladins,fp4bsyk,t3_gaxwgs,1588295724.0,Damn that looks good

SuicideWatch,fotwcby,t3_g9bygm,1588068466.0,"I think about this a lot now since I will be finishing uni in a year. I am doing average, but the job market is so competitive and I am already falling behind so much... now with covid it seems like there won't be much to go find at all. Everyday it seems harder to find motivation to do anything knowing what a massive disappointment it will all lead up to. 
But I keep hanging on because I want my family to feel as if things will be okay. I hope that the lucky gamble that has been going my way won't stop, or else im boned."
college,fotv07l,t3_g9djcd,1588067097.0,"Youtube stats have never been reliable, but also it is important to note that students have a huge priority list right now and it might be that your class is just not the highest up. Some of them are probably going to binge watch them all, which is bad, and some are most likely spacing them out throughout the week. Im sure you are a great prof for caring for your students, and I hope you will have faith in them that they will recognize the responsibility of being ready for that exam :)"
Paladins,fotf438,t1_foteqf0,1588052104.0,"I had the same experience with OW, it took a long time for me to climb from silver to masters because I could not aim for shit. In Paladins I feel like I kill people around corners way more than I should lol but it is nice to have bigger hotboxes so there is more of a focus on positioning and ability usage."
Paladins,fosl7e3,t1_foskhrc,1588032903.0,"Totally agree, Overwatch has so many 1-shot abilities that make the game way faster and less fun to play. Although overwatch is way more polished than paladins, I absolutely love the design of paladin characters and their abilities. The game is slower, but it feels better that way"
Paladins,fosjfpt,t3_g993gl,1588031894.0,"After having 3 years into overwatch and 1 month in paladins, I can say that paladins definetely feels easier to play. OW has so many punishing decisions, especially in regards to team comp and strategy. OW also has wayyy more stuns and paladins has ways of dealing with them."
UCDavis,fosh68f,t3_g97ap3,1588030628.0,"Yea all my professors are doing well to make sure no one gets left behind with exams and assignments. I appreciate how well Davis professors and TAs are pulling through, and I am happy to be apart of a good school"
UCDavis,fopvg1f,t3_g8u484,1587973455.0,"Go to schedule builder on myucdavis. Go to either summer session 1 or 2, and it should display your pass time near the top of the page. Check soon since pass times are coming!"
aftergifted,fopsqor,t3_g8somf,1587970907.0,"Same issue here. From top of my class in HS to... barely making average at University. It ended up being a cycle of doing bad on an exam---> feeling awful and losing motivation---> not studying---> doing bad again. I wish I had some better advice apart from ""keep pushing forward"", but honestly we all gotta just keep chugging along until the gift comes back."
slaythespire,fli87ff,t3_fopce5,1585177202.0,Probably the most fun achievement to get in the game. I love the quick decisions and seeing it all come together fast
