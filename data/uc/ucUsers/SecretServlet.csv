but the LA race riots happened because \*one\* guy shot and killed an innocent little girl so African Americans looted and destroyed an \*entire community\* 

how does that prove Asians are racist?"
aznidentity,fpm7vc9,t1_fpkhpic,1588727356.0,"you should respond with:

""what about the LA race riots?""

""what about the fact that immigrants had \*nothing\* to do with slavery, segregation, etc., but African Americans still expect us to pay the price of racist white america?""

""what about how immigrants are treated in African American communities (including black immigrants)?""

""what about the racist portrayal of immigrants in African American media?""

""what about the fact that immigrants have done several outreach & charity events for African Americans, but every time only one of us does something bad, y'all wanna focus on that instead of all the good we do?""

so many African Americans I have met have the American supremacy complex where they think they are better than everyone else simply because they are American. They genuinely believe themselves to be the inventors of everything cultural used around the world and the saviors of other minorities. One African American girl even said the expression ""work twice as hard for half the reward"" comes from her community, even though variations of that have existed in multiple languages around the world! 

I think its American supremacy that makes them like that tbh. They believe they are superior to us because they have been in the US longer and that's why they say stuff like ""go back to your country"" to immigrants and their descendants, or anyone of Asian descent even if they've lived in the US for generations. 

I really wish they would stop behaving in such a tacky way and put in effort to educate themselves about issues around the world. Maybe then they'll realize the world doesn't revolve around the US and its problems."

FDS is the only community that I know of which focuses exclusively on women's empowerment in the dating world. Other communities are too focused on male pleasure and even condones abuse by teaching women to tolerate abusive behavior. FDS helps young women recognize the signs of an abusive relationship early AND protect themselves at all stages of a relationship while serving as a safe space for female survivors of abuse.

I was reading this amazing piece earlier on Twitter. I'll paraphrase:

when you've experience trauma (abuse, neglect, etc), you think love has to be earned. you choose toxic partners because you're used to them and healthy love makes you feel uncomfortable because its given too easily. you're used to begging for love, so you chase after people who make you do that.

in order to pick better partners, you need to break out of the toxic cycle and mentality that love has to be earned. in a healthy relationship, people express their emotions freely and openly. you don't have to walk on eggshells or earn their love. train your brain to feel comfortable with love so you can accept it when its given to you."

Also most immigrant groups clash with African Americans because they are dirt poor and move near black neighborhoods or own businesses there. So while white people have segregated themselves from others, immigrants and black folks frequently mix with each other. It's like the myth of ""black on black crime""- it only happens because you're more likely to be surrounded by one group than another.

Black Americans may be black, but they're also American. As such, they have the American savior complex, ego, ignorance of different cultures, and xenophobia.

In SJW circles black people are put on a pedestal but thats dangerous because when your entire community is stereotyped as being the ""savior"" of minorities it really inflates your ego while simultaneously making others scrutinize your every move.

The only way to stop this nonsense is to stop treating black people like they're everyone's saviors, and start acknowledging that all non whites are fucked (though in different ways, and some worse than others) in this country. There are good black people and bad black people, just like there are good Asians and bad Asians.
