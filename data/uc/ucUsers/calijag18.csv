We're currently still working on additional content to get more in depth into hands on EEG work, and looking forward to have that out soon:)"
UCDavis,fomf5v1,t3_g84sxq,1587887788.0,"I'd say the opposite for me. Literally have nothing else to do. No nights out, no chilling in the MU, no Mojito Night. All I do is workout, study, and occasional Amazon prime videos."
compmathneuro,fom5wff,t1_fok5xb0,1587879229.0,"Sounds a bit harsh but I don't doubt that it's likely true hahah. I do agree that superhuman AI will probably be created well before we fully understand the brain, but I also think that the pursuit of superhuman AI will likely need at least a few more major contributions/ inspirations from neuroscience before that happens. It might involve fundamental changes to how we approach the software/ algorithms (i.e. gradient descent) or the hardware (i.e. neuromorphic)."
compmathneuro,fom594p,t1_folgrwp,1587878694.0,Hi! Thanks for sharing this opportunity. Just checked out the site and it looks awesome. Will definitely apply
compmathneuro,fom4wt2,t1_fojylco,1587878416.0,">"" I’ve heard from those that have done it that the big companies (Google Brain, DeepMind, FAIR, Uber) that they are now a lot more skeptical of neuro backgrounds. I think a few years ago they thought that since big advances in neuro were propelled by cog neuroscientists (Hinton, Bengio, Hassabis) that neuro was worth investing in but I guess that’s not been the case and it’s better just to hire ML PhDs now ""

&#x200B;

Thanks for sharing this point. I have noticed that many of the scientists at DeepMind, OpenAI, etc come from neuroscience backgrounds from looking at their profiles, and I've been a bit unsure regarding how interchangeable the two degrees are in those types of contexts.

&#x200B;

It is possible that Computational Neuroscience might emerge as it's own industry with goals distinct from AI, like neural interface development, insilico brain models for diseases, etc. But not sure it that is something that will explode significantly in the near future."
compmathneuro,fom4fd4,t1_fokyv0h,1587878027.0,"Thanks for the insights! It's always cool to see people with very far removed backgrounds make into a field and do well. I had a professor who did civil engineering undergrad, masters in CS, and PhD in biomedical. I'd honestly like that type of a trajectory because I find myself super interested in two or three key topics (nanotechnology, AI/neuro, and biotech) that I think would all be nice to explore. Ofcourse this comes at an opportunity cost, and every hour I spend learning knowledge that I might not ever apply is an hour that I could be learning new skills or building something useful."

neurallace,foin31y,t1_foicgzm,1587790953.0,"Thanks for the response really glad you liked it!! Another site I very recently found out about that also has very comprehensive lists is  [https://www.neurotech.com/](https://www.neurotech.com/) .

As for signal processing, I want to say that any type of interface we build (including what neuralink is doing) will require some of the same ideas from signal processing. i.e. whatever BCI technology you're using, including some futuristic technology that's fully embedded in your brain, will require some sort of software to analyze time series data and make decision on that data. It likely won't be EEG or ECoG data, but some sort of electrical or imaging data

You have very good points about Humm (and also Halo by extension). Any device that claims to ""improve"" your brain should be very very seriously analyzed by third party researchers in double blind trials. I'm just as skeptical as you on whether they have what they claim they have, but at the same time, both companies are led by reputable neuroscience teams who I assume would not want to jeapordize their lifelong careers and reputations over a few minutes of fame, given that if they are indeed scammers, it wouldn't be too long before people and the government catch on and they go the way of Lumosity. So left them in the article, but with a healthy dose of skepticism. If they do indeed have what they claim, then I would very much like to have it!"
BCI,foekhci,t1_fo9pvs3,1587706179.0,"Thanks the feedback! Really appreciate your comments, and I'll be sure to add the part about BCI/BMI, as well as maybe some hyperlinks to cool projects that demonstrate EEG based control of a drone.  EEG technology is pretty amazing, and I didn't want it to come off as dismissing the progress that's being made.

To be honest, I really wanted to write that I believe EEG has huge potential to change how we control technology. EEG is what originally got me interested in the field of Neurotech, and I have multiple EEG headsets and have worked on a lot of cool EEG projects. I still think EEG has huge potential for control applications (i.e. imagine headphones that automatically start and stop music based on if you think pause or play). But I think when people initially learn about BCIs for the first time, they have this really grand vision that one day, perhaps everything can be controlled with EEGs (exactly the vision I had), and it's quite disappointing when you work with it for several months and see what the limitations are, and that any control application requiring more than 2 or 3 degrees of control is highly unlikely to ever make it out of the lab. So I tired to hit that point hard and prevent any unrealistic overoptimism, while still acknowledging that EEG plays a very important role and does have applications in wellness, meditation, and sleep technologies, as well as brain research. I could add that there are some limited forms of control applications that might very well be widely adapted (i.e. headphones with think to pause functionality), and there might be a huge market for them for all we know."

biotech,fo3372x,t1_fo2p3zd,1587479678.0,">will be given chances for advancement if you have an advanced degree (PhD, or less commonly Masters). I have seen companies pay for advanced training or degrees for exceptional employees, however that is almost never going to be a PhD (usually MBA or similar).

>Companies that are looking to hire someone to take on a technical project directly, or the management of work in a highly technical area, are going to want to see a PhD. It's not a guarantee of performance, but it is an indicator of knowledge-base. That is table-sta

Thank you sharing your response and experiences! With regards to management, what does the average day look like for someone who has a PhD and is in a management role? Atleast from what I know in software, when you move up the ranks, you can climb the technical ladder or the management ladder. Climbing up the technical ladder, you might end up as Chief Architect, and a PhD would certainly be beneficial for that. But climbing up management, while also requiring deep technical knowledge in many cases, might be easier with a M.S. in Computer Science and MBA instead of a PhD.

I was wondering if a similar dynamic exists in the companies you've worked at from your experience."
biotech,fo2ywcu,t1_fo2r501,1587477228.0,"I agree that work experience might be more valuable (possibly experientialy, and definitely financially). I'm a bit concerned that if I go into industry and work for a few years, and then decide that I want to go to grad school, it'll be difficult for me to find professors who are willing to let me join their research group as an assistant so that I can work with them and attain a letter of rec (as lack of letters are a big concern for me). As compared to now, where I feel that I have a few professors in mind who might be down to let me join their group as an assistant since I know them from class (but not nearly well enough to request a letter yet since I havent talked much or worked with them)"
biotech,fo2y5io,t1_fo2dm2m,1587476783.0,"Thanks for sharing your response! Very good point about the job market being dead, and if I had known of COVID a few years ago, I might have planned a bit differently haha

The idea is that if I can find reasons to commit to grad school right now (either PhD or Masters), then I can shift all my efforts to the application process. This would entail spending the next year or so working in a lab or two as an assistant (most likely minimum wage, possibly even for free). I'd hope to get some role that lets me do computational modeling or bioinformatics work. This would allow me to get the letters of rec from the professors I work with, as well as a solid year or so of research. Then I could apply starting next year, and perhaps start a program in 2022.

Alternatively, I could put the idea of grad school on the back burner for a few years, and exclusively focus on industry. In this case, and ideal position would be anything computational at a place like Genetech/23&Me/etc. In this case, I would probably end up reconsidering grad school if and when I hit the ""glass ceiling"""
biotech,fo2vvgm,t3_g5ar59,1587475330.0,"Thanks everyone, super incredible responses and I really appreciate the perspectives. I think one thing that's new about choosing what to do after college is that it has a massive impact on not just your career, but also the type of life you can live and what options (i.e. traveling, starting a family) you may or may not have over the next 10 - 15 years. A bit different from entering college, where everyone regardless of major was more or less in the same boat and had relatively similar lives and routines (even though the liberal arts ppl probably had more of a life than we did haha)"
omad,fngfpm8,t3_g1jgai,1586930803.0,"It might not help in weight loss, but any type of zero calorie liquid (especially coffee/ zero calorie energy drinks) help with keeping you feeling full and comfortable over the course of the day. Caffeine especially is good because it also speeds up metabolism and gets you in the zone for work outs and helps you focus even when you're hungry. Ofc caffeine is dehydrating so all the more need for more water"
omad,fngfetr,t1_fnavm0j,1586930543.0,A good technique to overcome this (which might one day literally save your life bc medication non adherence is a very real issue) is to place your vitamins next to your toothbrush
neurallace,fefiq8z,t1_fcwqmyt,1579057162.0,"Apologies for late reply, but according to the company, it's the first ""Brain Computer"" which is different from a BCI in that all the processing is done on the device itself. The distinction is meant to emphasize their focus on privacy, since no raw signals are to leave the device, unlike conventional interfaces which send off raw signals to be processed elsewhere."
