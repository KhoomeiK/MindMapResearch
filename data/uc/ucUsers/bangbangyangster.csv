berkeley,fowwri0,t1_fowqnf7,1588128822.0,"This exactly. And it's an 8am.

Also I heard canic had really insanely high bins bc of the easy af tests, but I'm thinking the tests will prob be more challenging now that they're not on their first semester teaching, which will make the bins more reasonable I hope?"

berkeley,fopdbxo,t3_g82qea,1587958648.0,"I lived one semester in each (Cal Housing fucked up and put me in temporary housing)

Pros/cons of coed:

-Coed floor was 1000000% more social. It was a little weird seeing dudes in the bathroom getting out of the shower but you honestly get used to it pretty quickly. Most of the floormates were friends or at least friendly enough to walk each other home or hang out. People celebrated birthdays, studied together, etc.

-It was pretty noisy and although I personally can study with noise, you might have to go to the Academic Center downstairs or to a library for quiet.

Pros/cons of single gender:

-No need to worry about toilet seats left up, dirtier bathrooms, etc. It's also very peaceful and quiet if you just need to unwind and have some alone time.

-Much less social. In fact, most of the people on my floor barely greeted each other, and people often don't even know their floormates' names. Kind of boring to be honest.

I'm obviously biased here - I would say unless you have religious reasons or a really strong social preference, go coed. It'll give you more of that traditional dorm experience, and most of the people I know who lived on single gender floors were either less social in general or spent all of their waking hours elsewhere, treating their dorms as nothing more than a place to sleep. Then again, it really depends on what you're looking for. There are many ways to socialize or explore, and the dorms can be your quiet safe haven if that's what you want."
berkeley,fop0emg,t3_g8pqve,1587950329.0,"I'm not a huge fan of frat parties either, but most clubs/groups hold smaller wet kickbacks that are wildly different from the stereotypical college party - that might be really fun for you! I also have a small friend group I hang out with to get food, explore SF/Oakland, smoke, etc. There are plenty of people like you who are outgoing but not huge partiers, so don't sweat it. As long as you're not a turtle and make an effort to meet people you'll be fine!"
berkeley,fooyeaz,t3_g8an1k,1587949099.0,"Edit: Gay guy friend who quit CS said lots of EECS dudes apparently act even more supremely awkward around gay guys

Current CS 61B gal here, and I relate so hard.  One time, I actually called out this one guy who literally said, ""But you got an A- in 61A."" And then he went on to insist that he wasn't being condescending, but rather that I have an inferiority complex that makes me feel insecure any time I have to ask a question--which is entirely untrue.

Unfortunately, my dad is an immature EECS Silicon Valley circlejerk sexist who acts and says basically the exact same things. And even when guys aren't condescending, they're so painfully socially inept that it's near impossible to meet study buddies through classes. In my EE16B discussion, there were like 2 girls, and during the first discussion section when a few guys sitting near me were trying to form a study group, I tried to join but they were so obviously uncomfortable that I just decided to spare them and leave them me.

Luckily, I met several gal CS majors in other non-CS clubs I joined who are cool to work with. Socially, though, none of my close friends at Cal are CS majors. (also @ the 'u got A- in 61B' guy I have an A in 61b now even without taking the final so suck my imaginary dick)"

Naruto,fnj3bh9,t1_fnj1p2p,1586991170.0,"Sasuke didn't exactly make his goal a secret. He pretty much laid it out starting from the first Team 7 meeting, and even if Sakura didn't know the full gory backstory, she knew enough to know that Sasuke's root motivation was revenge. Like Naruto, she also knew Sasuke personally and went through life-or-death situations with him before he defected. 

Sakura holding feelings for and trying to save Sasuke, like Naruto, is not at all like people who glorify shooters because she liked Sasuke DESPITE his flaws, whereas those people find shooters attractive BECAUSE of their horrendous acts. Those people don't know the shooters personally and find shooters attractive purely because they glorify shooters. Sakura, on the other hand, knew and liked Sasuke before his betrayal, and although you could argue she is stupid for still liking him, the same argument also applies to Naruto. Emotions are emotions. You can love someone even if they're total trash - it's not something you can control. The key, to reiterate, is that Sakura liked Sasuke despite his errors, not because of them (unlike the people who find shooters attractive)."
Naruto,fnigbbh,t1_fniaaj2,1586979504.0,"Then isn't it weird how so many people ride the Sakura hate bandwagon for liking a terrorist, yet those same people rarely ever shit on Sasuke, the terrorist himself? And a side note, insults like slut and thot are examples of language that continue to drive sexism that people use to oppress women for sexual expression. Could you argue that Sakura is stupid for liking Sasuke without acting like a sexist 14 year old boy who thinks calling women thots is okay?"
Naruto,fngxctw,t1_fngwijw,1586948428.0,"By your logic, if instant decision-making is required for someone to not be useless, then basically everyone is useless. Naruto let Sasuke bring his sword right up to his neck and didn't fight back, and Sai had to save him. Naruto continually tried to save Sasuke despite Sasuke trying to kill him even more times than Sasuke tried to kill Sakura. And obviously Sakura supports Naruto when Naruto supports her interests... They're on the same team,,,,, like no shit Sakura's going to support her interests - she and Naruto share the same interests. And Sasuke being dark from the beginning does not justify his actions. So many other characters went through just as much if not more shit (Itachi, Kakashi, Naruto, Gaara) and you don't see them doing all the dumb shit Sasuke did. I love Sasuke even though I still think he was an idiot for 99% of the series (his brother died to protect Konoha and his reaction was to try to attack Konoha????? He literally be attacking what Itachi died to save). Sakura has a lot of flaws like all the other characters, but she's absolutely not useless. Just because she could have been more useful doesn't mean she's useless."
Naruto,fngr69s,t1_fng9vh7,1586941904.0,"Rin died as a genin before she could grow... What do you expect from a genin lmao???

And how do you think the 4th shinobi war would've gone if Sakura hadn't healed literally everyone simultaneously? Do you also consider defeating sasori, an akatsuki member, useless?"
Naruto,fngr0d6,t1_fngiqi2,1586941733.0,"Really? Sure, immature young Sakura called naruto names and shit on him a lot, but when it really counts for life and death matters, she always supported him. She took time to mature, but after that she became awesome. Strongarmed freaking Tsunade into training her, and then became the best medic of her generation, saving thousands of lives in the 4th shinobi war and defeating a member of the akatsuki. If anything, Sasuke is more of a 'moron', is more inconsistent, and treats naruto even worse. He tried to kill Naruto even after they won the whole fucking war - like if that isn't dumb idk what is. 

If you think about it, Sakura earned all her power through virtuous methods and wasn't born gifted, whereas Sasuke and Naruto are basically the reincarnations of ninja Jesus, and Sasuke hurt so many people to obtain his power. Sakura is underrated and people need to stop shitting on her because she's not the same immature Sasuke fangirl she was in season 1."
Naruto,fngqndv,t1_fnghmiu,1586941359.0,"Rin held that fake academy graduation ceremony for obito after he missed the official graduation tho. So that's some character we see - Sakura, while kind at heart, certainly wasn't thoughtful or empathetic enough to do that for the vast majority of Naruto.

But in terms of power and contribution, Sakura literally surpassed Tsunade and reached sanin level - which basically would be kage level excluding OP kages like Naruto or Gaara. She literally was one of the major lifelines for the entire shinobi force during the 4th shinobi war. Think how many people would've died if not for her, and how skilled of a medic she is to be able to consistently concentrate chakra on one little point for years and years. And even before the major war battles, she beat sasori (though with chiyo's help), a member of the fucking akatsuki."
Naruto,fngqaw5,t1_fngm5ea,1586940996.0,"Agree with obito as Naruto then Sasuke, but I think kakashi evolved from Sasuke to something really unique - a big part of Naruto and obitos similarity is the underdog thing, and kakashi has never in his life ever been an underdog."
Naruto,fngq3ry,t1_fnfz2ac,1586940788.0,"Feels like Sasuke just set everything back again tho. Kakashi obviously travelled a better path than Orochimaru, but then Sasuke went and fucked things over by diverging to Sound instead of sticking with Konoha. Which, we get why he did it, but still. Kakashi went through a lot, yet he still didn't turn to evil for power."

berkeley,fmz1meg,t3_fri2r8,1586503001.0,"I did 54 last sem and am taking 16b right now, basically the 1st module circuits for 16b will take a lot of extra work if you don't do 16a and also haven't taken something like AP Phys C, but the math for the remaining 2 modules is much much easier. 54 does a much better job solidifying linalg/diffeq concepts than 16a.

Proof: scored half a stdev below median on first midterm covering circuits module, just scored 18/25 on 2nd midterm covering linalg (20 is a full score, not sure exactly how they're grading it yet but I obv did better on this one than the last)"
