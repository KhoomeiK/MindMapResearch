The other guy probably talked about how it's going to happen through zoom, but the Korean test is pretty simple in itself: you'll probably be given two prompts to choose from (easier, harder) and you'll have to respond in Korean. Then, the person will probably talk to you one-on-one, asking pretty basic questions to test your comprehension and speaking abilities. Good luck!"

Other than that, though, the newer buildings are closer to the market, orbach library, and the parking lots. Plus they have better elevators. All Glen Mor buildings kinda suck in that the fire alarms kill you slowly sometimes...

Lived in Building G for reference."
ucr,fp003jx,t3_gai7yq,1588199980.0,Applied two weeks-ish into February and signed my contract a month later :/
ucr,fokzw1d,t3_g7yk3k,1587852137.0,"I like to think AI was the best but obviously I have a bit of bias because I lived there and only there and also got lucky with good hallmates. Pentland is for people who  study more heavily, while AI and Lothian are more social and loud. I would go with AI over Lothian if I didn't have any experience because it's close to a lot of buildings that students will use and the gym is literally walking distance. Dundee is new so I genuinely have no clue about it. However, my recommendation is that you focus on good roommates before deciding on the dorm building. They make all the difference if I'm being honest."

tennis,fnte36m,t3_g3nnhf,1587239806.0,A player with the serve of Kyrgios and the speed of De Minaur would be a nightmare for any player tbh not to mention net game of Mahut whew
tennis,fnjfcs3,t3_g1wmr2,1586997833.0,"I think Dimitrov is pretty good, possibly underrated. He's really inconsistent imo and has his down moments a lot but after rewatching the 2019 USO and 2017 AO I've come to realize that the ATP tour is way more difficult than people think and he is insanely talented."
ucr,fmyt3m1,t3_fy8o2c,1586494943.0,AI or Lothian is cheaper than Pentland and more social
ucr,fmyt2ea,t1_fmyhd15,1586494915.0,I see. Hopefully music turns out to be easy haha

ucr,fm9rk44,t3_ftweax,1585874965.0,People who've been doing it have to had known that there would be consequences for doing something as stupid as this. They need to be dealt with harshly imo.
