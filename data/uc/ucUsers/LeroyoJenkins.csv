Some feedback:

* Avoid wavy lines: the section between Gdynia Stadion and Gdansk Osowa could be straight
* Make the station lines far, far more prominent, possibly using a white rounded rectangle with black border to mark the station, also, make the stations perpendicular to the lines
* Separate lines earlier: you could separate the red and green lines coming out of Gdynia from the main trunk before Gdynia Stadion, placing Gdynia Stadion on the ""diagonal"" line towards Gdansk Osowa
* On Gdansk, the Red and Orange lines should end on the left side of the station, because (1) they'll be next to the blue and purple, which also end there (so you have a bundle of through lines on one side and a bundle of terminal ones on the other)
* Even better, use a bigger rectangle for Gdansk and Gdyna, with lines leaving from both sides

It is more complicated than that.

Austria here represents two entities: the Kingdom of Austria (königlich) and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (kaiserlich), which overlap in some parts but aren't the same. The Austrian-Prussian struggle is mostly about the königlich part, not the kaiserlich part.

And it wasn't just a matter of power, it was a matter of who should be the leader of the German ""nation"" (as in, of all the German people).

> they don't quite come from nationalism empires wanting to expand and making excuses for that expansion doesn't correlate with nationalism

Again, you're confusing empires with nations. Manifest destiny wasn't about an American ""empire"" (as in, a state of many nations), but about white protestant europeans having a god-given right to the land of the US. Same with the annexation of Texas.

Similarly with the French ""natural borders"". None of these were about empires, but about peoples and nations, and about the right of a people to a land.

Funny enough, even Israel today openly practices Lebensraum.

> Wanting to recover something that was lost doesn't mean nationalism, pretty every country in the world was wanted to expand long before nationalism.

That's not what irredentism and revanchism are about. They're similar to gjakmarrja: an irrational, lose-lose situation that propagate conflicts in the name of a national ideology (from a national identity down to the basic unit of family blood).

Killing others has been human for as long as humans have existed, that doesn't mean it is good.

Don't you understand that even the concept of unification of a nation comes from Nationalism?

So does the idea that a country should contain a single nation, or that all of those of a single nation should be in the same country, or that people of one nation should only be ruled by people of that same nation. All of this comes from nationalism.

> Lebensraum was a excuse that Hitler had made for his expansion into the east and has nothing to do with the middle ages

Seriously, at least google it. The concept of Lebensraum is far older than Hitler, and is echoed in many other principles around the world, such as France's ""Natural Borders"", the American ""Manifest Destiny"" and so on, always tied to national identity and nationalism.

> Out all countries Austria and the Ottomans should be the less countries that would want nationalism, as that would divide their multi ethnic empires.

Again, quite the opposite. You see the same pattern when a power transitions from an empire (a state of many nations) to a single-nation country. Nationalism through the (late stage of the) young Turks led to the genocides in breakup of the Ottoman empire: to build the Turkish nation, they ""had"" to get rid of the Greeks, Armenians, etc. who were occupying their ""homeland"".

> Revenge is a normal human emotion or thought whatever not a nationalistic one.

It is part of nationalism as well, through Revanchism and Irredentism.

> Yeah,but was the reason to scramble for that land nationalism?

Lebensraum and self-determination, as well as the rise of the romantic ideal of a nation.

Nope. Religion was just one part of it. And what do you get when you mix religion with ethnicity with language and culture, and add a dash of self-determination with a table spoon of irredentism? Exactly: nationalism.
