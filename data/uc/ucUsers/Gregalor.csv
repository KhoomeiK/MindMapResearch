vinyl,fpkej27,t1_fpkc00u,1588693234.0,"It will still be higher fidelity than the CD because of the limitations of Redbook audio. And often the vinyl release gets a more dynamic mastering. Now, if it's vinyl vs 24 bit FLAC or DSD for stuff that was recorded digitally, that's a debate."
vinyl,fpkdt2d,t3_gdz1is,1588692856.0,I love how much weird random stuff is on vinyl.
vinyl,fpkaqgn,t1_fpk7nxm,1588691232.0,"Actually, that makes a lot of sense. This is one area where they really don’t make them like they used to. Money stretches much further with old gear."
vinyl,fpkafgs,t1_fpk9r94,1588691065.0,45 rpm LPs? A major inconvenience for a negligible increase in sound quality. And it ruins the flow of a lot of albums. What’s Going On was not designed for those interruptions.
vinyl,fpk7r1p,t1_fpk5g0h,1588689619.0,"Exactly. Saying that there's no difference because they sound ""fine"" on starter equipment isn't much of an argument. In actuality you're just used to everything sounding like a picture disc."

UCI,fpjrcta,t1_fpjmoj7,1588678734.0,"They’d understand if they had to drive about 2 hours each way just to go to class. That’s a huge chunk of the day for a 50 minute or 80 minute class. That’s like half the day away from my wife and my cat just because I had to take a quiz or something. I’m gonna just hang around campus? Hardly.
Every wants to be all down in the dumps about this quarter but some of us are finally getting to take our classes the way we always wanted."
UCI,fpjleu6,t1_fpjil0i,1588672908.0,What’s the problem? I’m having my best quarter ever.
vinyl,fpjeyid,t1_fpjddkz,1588666033.0,"I don't know the technical details, but that's what I've heard from someone involved with Mondo's video game soundtracks. Also that some colors are worse than others."
vinyl,fpjcpkh,t3_gdsk0n,1588663773.0,"Even colored vinyl is worse than plain old black, but picture discs are definitely the worst.

It's analogous to the crappy sheet cake from a grocery store that'll inket a photo on top, compared to a cake from a dedicated bakery."

VinylReleases,fpik2kn,t1_fphofhf,1588642538.0,"I recall that the score was pretty good, too. And the soundtrack CD had a CD-ROM portion that had some stuff on it if you put it in your computer."

vinyl,fp9lokw,t1_fp9ampe,1588429294.0,"See that changes things COMPLETELY.  $100,000 turntables aside, 200€ is actually rather low end and won't get you anything that sounds good."

vinyl,fp47vc9,t1_fp3z1vs,1588293450.0,"Yeah, it's particularly amusing when the lead vocals are in one speaker and the backing vocals in another, and they're doing a back-and-forth thing. You can get rid of the lead so the song is just a bunch of ""Yeah....... Yeah..... Yeahhhh"""

vinyl,fp3was2,t1_fp3i4tv,1588287000.0,"The early days of stereo mixes were not great. During mastering, most of the attention was spent on the single-channel mono mix and the stereo was more of a novel afterthought. They'd often put individual instruments or singers entirely into the left or right channel. Not what you'd call sophisticated. The Beatles in stereo are a prime example of stereo weirdness. If you play some Beatles in stereo and disconnect one of the speakers, you'll immediately notice that half the band is missing."
vinyl,foy1m21,t1_foxxavr,1588163024.0,"I get what you're saying, but this is after all a bit of a splurge (although to many in the vinyl world this would still be considered very much ""entry level"") and I don't intend to get carried away with upgrading (which is why I'm aiming for something that'll keep me happy for a long time). And it's not just for me, it's for the whole family and for visitors.

I already have one never-ending upgrade hole, anyway: PC gaming. Video cards and such. And believe me, those don't retain their resale value the way hifi equipment does. It plummets so fast that you might as well not even bother."
UCI,foy0r01,t1_foxy1e1,1588162349.0,"Given that the whole country went from no covid to the most cases by far in just 2-3 months, I don't see any other option for reopening BUT extremely slow. I'd rather not end up in the hospital whether it's overrun or not."
UCI,fotidrn,t1_forqshr,1588054854.0,"Some of us have had enough of staying inside for over a month, and these people are extending the amount of time that we have ahead (still a month or two even under the best of circumstances). We all want to resume being able to go out, but those who can’t restraint themselves are making it worse for those who are, even if it’s extremely taxing. We should just mind our own business? It IS my business, as it directly affects me."
UCI,fothsyz,t1_fos1hzi,1588054351.0,"They’re not necessarily committing suicide. They could be killing someone else instead. If hospitals get overwhelmed because everyone went to the beach last weekend and they have to make hard choices over who to treat, those who get a ventilator might be the ones who went to the beach and caused the problem in the first place while someone older who got it through plain bad luck at the grocery store gets wheeled out back to die.
It would be nice to just say “Let them do it and face the consequences,” but unfortunately it doesn’t work that way."

UCI,fo8l2og,t1_fo8jz8l,1587598656.0,"Typically I would agree, but many professors are simply being very lenient this quarter. It’s very possibly that the other test was a breeze."

Of course, if you expect an F, you’re not getting the credits in either case and P/NP will at least save your GPA."
