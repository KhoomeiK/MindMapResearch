But I ended up bailing at Red Flat to drop to South Fork. Snow conditions weren't giving me much confidence that the east side descent wasn't going to be half snow bank/half total melt. So my route was South Fork TH-> Forsee Creek TH->San B ridge via Johnson's Meadow-> San B (via the chute), then just rode that ridge until Red Flat."

socalhiking,fosid3m,t3_g910jt,1588031291.0,"I've backpacked Dough to Sespe twice and Piedra to Sespe four times, and literally just ran from the Dough Flat gate (2.4 miles before the trailhead) to Piedra this weekend as a keyswap, so I can get you pretty decent trail beta :).

Short answer: Piedra to Sespe is way, way, way, way, way easier and faster, for a few reasons.

1. The trail from Piedra to Sespe is about 14 miles, from Dough to Sespe is about 11 miles. I know that the map says there's a bigger difference, but it's really about the same.
2. Dough is... kind of a pain to get to. Getting from the start of Goodenough Road to the trailhead will take you about an hour.
3. Alder Creek trail is perfectly followable (great treadpath), but it's completely overgrown as soon as you leave the flat about 3 miles in and descend into the creek/river. Lots of spiky bushes, lots of poison oak, it's slow going. Once you get into the creek, it's light wading or poison oak to get down to Alder Creek camp, your choice. From Alder Creek to Coltrell Flat, it gets easier compared to what you just went through, but you have a climb bigger than anything you see on the Sespe side through spiky bushes to the top, and the trail down is kind of sketchy and goes through a couple poison oak overgrows. Plus the last stupid river crossing before Coltrell is just an annoying parting gift.

The trail out of Piedra is a highway compared to anything east of the Hot Springs. Trust me that, unless you're looking for an adventure, you want to go out from Piedra.

And if you're looking for an adventure, let me tell you about the Sespe Gorge ""trail"" down to Devil's Gate:)."

MotoLA,fo15ctf,t3_g53wj0,1587426075.0,"Heya, friendly neighborhood accident reconstructionist here. Welcome to LA! First off, you should probably disabuse yourself of the notion that freeways are safer than surface streets for motorcyclists. Surface streets have vehicles in closer proximity and, more importantly, more intersections, which is where multi-vehicle accidents are most prone to happen. So keep that in mind.

LA drivers aren't really much worse than anywhere else, to be honest, there's just a lot of them. And the more other drivers, the more likely an accident.

Honestly, if you're just going from MDR to Santa Monica, you might as well just take a bus or ride on the oceanfront walk, SM is one of the few places that's amenable to that sort of commute, and there's a few lines that go straight down Ocean or Lincoln.

So, if you really want to ride, feel free to ride, but there's not a way to eliminate the risk. You're going through some of the most congested city streets in the area."
