berkeley,fpazofb,t1_fpajrny,1588459060.0,Precisely the point - it's the fundamental problem. We want what we can't have.
berkeley,fpa6j4p,t1_fp9vpsb,1588441815.0,Unlike academics - there is no set road map for success in relationship or attaining a good sexual market value.
berkeley,fpa6edq,t1_fp9vpsb,1588441741.0,"The analogy is perfect. I'd rather not drive at all rather than ""settle"" for something. And if I don't want to settle, then I need to act on myself and improve - which I don't do because I feel like it will not help me anyways to get a ""Luxury Vehicle""."
berkeley,fp9urvs,t1_fp9chlh,1588434985.0,"The thing is - when you say 'an equal' - I don't want who is someone who is equal to me. It's human behavior to always overreach. Even right now - there is a girl (long distance right now) who is interested in me but I think I give some basic importance to physical features (I'm not fat. And I don't want someone who has an option to have a normal body but choose not to do the needful). 

What's even worse is that I don't want to be like one of the girls who have rejected me (my former crush who even called me a creep for just asking my her if we could hang out after school at graduation ceremony). So I haven't got the guts to even speak my mind with her."
SBU,fp9bx6h,t3_gc4t68,1588421740.0,Not choosing P/NC makes you slip your GPA.
berkeley,fp9bqxe,t1_fp9bbe3,1588421576.0,"No - I wouldn't do what he did.

Come to terms with it - yes. I have given up working on trying to meet a girl. I just know I'm destined to be unhappy and lonely and odd. 


Healthy - definitely not. I have plenty of sleepless nights and anxiety. I have nightmares where I see myself dying and no one attending my funeral. I don't even know if I want to get help, let alone how."

SBU,fp6yu98,t1_fp6yke0,1588360990.0,I want to add another point here - You might say women in tech is actually less. But they are still employed in a tech company and tech people have to work with non tech people. I do not know what constitutes non tech according to Google.

SBU,fp2mx3k,t1_fp1hscc,1588264493.0,"The reason for this is because men see a lot of women seem to come in through the diversity hiring instead of people from various different backgrounds and ethnicities. And the bar is significantly lowered during this process (I've been part of the process and I can attest to this) 

You do have to ask yourself how is it that women don't make up nearly the same percentage of workers in many other sectors of STEM as there are in CS Tech while schools and governments are trying to get more women in STEM?

Not all STEM jobs are CS Tech jobs."
berkeley,fp2lpl5,t1_foncyza,1588263909.0,"I'm a CS major and I've never hit on any of my lab partners despite my friends asking me to.

I never do it because I've accepted that no girl wants me no matter what I do to change.

I'm just plain ugly, unattractive, uninteresting. I don't want to get depressed after a girl shoots me down"
