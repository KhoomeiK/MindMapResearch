You have free movement and auto attack, but all abilities are on cool down. A lot of the strategy comes from using abilities that give debuffs that stack into status effects, like toppled or dizzy. Coming from someone who can’t get into turn based combat, I thought it was pretty darn fun."

Plus, I think him and Amanda’s home was destroyed by soldiers at that point, so Big Boss probably wanted to give him some sort of shelter.

EDIT: whoops, Amanda was Chico’s big sis, not Cecilia (she’s the bird lady)"
