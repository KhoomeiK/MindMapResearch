I wondered about the same thing about the Macrons before I started. So the usual supply days were Sunday night and Wednesday night, those were the hectic days unloading the truck of goods.

The craziest thing was the Macrons were never in the large truck shipments. We would get some ""specialty"" item deliveries, which had the more gourmet offerings. The Macrons were delivered in those deliveries, there wasn't any branding on the Macron packaging. The person who delivered it though said they handmade the Macrons themself. If I recall correctly the delivery person looked exactly like Khosla, but with a large mustache, large fake nose, and some circular glasses without any lenses in them."
