ADHD,fpmtavi,t1_fpmt5b0,1588741151.0,"very helpful tips!! thank you so much, I’ll definitely start doing them"
ADHD,fpmsiyb,t1_fpms619,1588740562.0,I didn’t even think about doing this! Thank you for the recommendation
ADHD,fpmsg81,t1_fpmry9g,1588740506.0,"I just got a new one (pcp). One problem I’m having with my insurance is that it’s Tri-care. And military hospitals and their mental health treatment from my experience has been awful. My first therapist told me “it is how it is” when I explained my abuse and frustration. Did NOT help with imposter syndrome. Sorry that’s off topic. But my point is on-base options suck and a lot of therapists don’t take tricare. But, I have an appointment with her tomorrow, so I’ll ask. 

For right now, I wanted to find one maybe online, since I move around so much."

 I accidentally stumbled across a local place that offers these services. Neurostimulation exposes your brain to unused neural pathways and gives it experience using those pathways. 

I had terrible anxiety, depression, and ADHD. 
I went to a place called Neurofield Neurotherapy (their website has so much information on how it works, and even breaks it down by disorder). We tackled one disorder at a time, starting with anxiety. For anxiety specifically, treatment consisted of me going in 3x a week and being hooked up to 2 electrodes kinda under my ears. The electrodes emitted a specific wave that would activate my parasympathetic system. It retrained my brain how to activate the system without conscious help from me. My anxiety is completely gone because my brain was trained how to function “normally”. (the parasympathetic nervous system is also known as the “rest and digest” system. helps with calm)

We almost finished treatment for depression and were about to start the ADHD protocol when COVID hit and I had to go back home to my parents (who don’t live around a neurotherapy center I trust). 3 months later, I still don’t have anxiety. I almost cried thinking about it because after 18 years of intense anxiety, it was lifted after being treated for 2 months. Like magic. They base treatments off of personal input and they take brain maps every 2 weeks to adjust treatment. Honestly I didn’t believe I had mental illness until she pointed out the indicators on my OWN brain map. 

I highly encourage you to look into it and do tons of research. The idea of it is wild, like modern day shock therapy. But it really works. I know my neurotherapist specifically has a 93% success rate. They even couple my neurostimulation with talk-therapy if needed.

I seriously was about to give up on life and then I found this. Now I can’t even believe it exists because it works so well. I recommend it to anyone I can because it WORKS and it works FAST and permanent."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4ux7p,t1_fp4uvyg,1588308033.0,yeah
UCSantaBarbara,fp4uui1,t1_fp4u2kw,1588307976.0,"3B was hard too. Things got more complex and then the strikes took away tutoring and the pandemic took away finals. I feel like because that happened I never really got a hold on how to understand math as a concept. 
Your advice is actually really helpful. Having someone else tell me that mental breaks are needed gets rid of some of the guilt I feel if I’m not constantly being academically productive."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4ucso,t1_fp4sy4b,1588307612.0,I’ll start watching!
UCSantaBarbara,fp4smj6,t1_fp4shso,1588306347.0,Do you mind sharing where you found the tutor?
UCSantaBarbara,fp4s058,t1_fp4rscv,1588305925.0,We have TAs. It’s math
UCSantaBarbara,fp4rt2h,t1_fp4rlme,1588305792.0,linear algebra. I’m usually best at STEM and math classes  but idk
UCSantaBarbara,fp4ra5d,t1_fp4r1y8,1588305436.0,"honestly, I’m doing fine in the rest of my classes now. It’s just this one class."
