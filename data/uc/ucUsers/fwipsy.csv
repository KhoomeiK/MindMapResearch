UCSC,fpm7t1v,t1_fpld7om,1588727319.0,"It's also so if you get an F it doesn't affect your GPA. Maybe some students want to take classes outside of their major ""for fun"" without worrying about it too much. (I think that was what it was originally intended for, but I'm not sure if anyone would actually do that...)"
UCSC,fphtrha,t1_fph21x6,1588627655.0,This is my guess. Also maybe shuffling around classes (e.g. breaking labs down into more labs with fewer people) and requiring all classes to offer online as an option.

UCSC,fnpppet,t3_g2azjo,1587149728.0,"I saw that article on HN, it was an interesting read. I totally expected it to be about toxic startup cultures and how stress changes people and stuff, then it turns out >!it's a neurodegenerative disease instead.!<"
UCSC,fnik8tf,t1_fnijhp4,1586981444.0,"That's true, but I still got the impression that it would have been more work than UCSC."
UCSC,fnig6ra,t3_g1tx5w,1586979443.0,"After I got in, I compared this school to Riverside and Merced, which were the only other schools I got into. I had a lot of transfer credit from De Anza and I noticed that in order to graduate in 2 quarters, I would have had to take 5 classes at once in Riverside or Merced, but I only have to take 3 classes at once here. This was partly because UCSC accepted a lot more credit, but I think the CSE curriculum here requires fewer courses for graduation to begin with as well. (Should verify.) Compared to De Anza courses, UCSC courses seem on average equally hard but with a lot of variation.

I can't really speak to opportunities. Personally, I was able to get an internship through an internship fair (now cancelled :(  ) If I were you, I'd look for statistics on that."
UCSC,fng4w9n,t3_g11mo7,1586922394.0,"I think we'll be back for fall quarter but it won't be completely back to normal. [https://news.yahoo.com/california-governor-eyes-lockdown-end-refuses-set-date-212127265.html](https://news.yahoo.com/california-governor-eyes-lockdown-end-refuses-set-date-212127265.html) CA Gov't looking at how to have things return to normal as much as possible while still being able to control the disease. It's easy to imagine ways this could be extended to UCSC to find a good compromise. I think there will be lots of stuff like reduced contact, frequent testing for everyone, and maybe contact tracing. Probably large lectures will be online, but labs will still be available, maybe with small lab groups and disinfecting equipment between use, idk."

The barbie jeep was like ""oh shit this is cool"" and then I thought they were going to do more neat out of the box shit like the treehouse but instead they just made like five more slightly different ones. And also advertising for addictive pay to win games and bs."
UCSC,fmv94u3,t1_fmus3wo,1586409483.0,"It's more in the spirit of the barbie jeep than the second one was. The first barbie jeep was great and then they just kept making bigger ones and it's like, what's the point? The point was to be tiny, and they missed it. IDK they were both cool."

UCSC,fm6pgwb,t1_fm5royb,1585799675.0,"This supports a stylus, it has Wacom EMR technology which definitely supports pressure sensitivity. It's definitely not a very powerful laptop, but it has really solid battery life (10+ hours) due to the low-power CPU. As a secondary note-taking machine, it should be perfectly adequate. $500 is way too much just for a drawing tablet.

Also, this isn't my listing. I'm not trying to advertise. I just think more people should consider buying used, especially for a secondary machine."
