askgaybros,fpjbxd8,t3_gdfoy6,1588663008.0,"Flash back to 2018. I had dated 10+ guys over the past two years, three of which turned into relationships that ended in various disappointing ways. I felt a bit disheartened that I couldn't keep a relationship going for more than a few months. I kept finding guys who wouldn't treat me with the same respect and courtesy that I gave them, and I was just so disappointed with my options. I primarily used Tinder to find dates since I didn't believe Grindr was the best place to find a romantic love interest in the long-term. After getting out of the worst relationship of them all, I turned back to Tinder and immediately matched with a really cute guy. I had swiped half-heartedly on his profile because I didn't expect a guy who was that good looking to match with me. But luckily we matched, and he started the conversation right away. We talked for hours in the app and he eventually asked for my number. Then we talked for hours after that and we even started talking over the phone for a bit.

After a week of talking and texting, we decided to meet up for a cute little coffee date at Starbucks. It was a rainy evening in January, but luckily it was pretty warm inside the Starbucks. We hugged at the door and got our orders put in, then we sat down to talk. I was surprised that he was even better looking in person, and I couldn't help but smile at him as he talked. He revealed to me that he had been struggling with alcoholism and drugs in his recent past and that he was part of a twelve step program. I assured him that I would not judge him for his past, and he went into great detail about all the mistakes he made and his dark history. Normally, this would have struck me as a red flag, but he seemed pretty genuine and stable. And there was something mysterious about him that piqued my interest. He also revealed that he only recently discovered his sexuality and wasn't out to his family. I told him that didn't phase me and that when the time comes he would have me to lean on if need be. We drank our coffees and then he took me to a grocery store to get a salad... which I thought was cute for some reason. He asked if I wanted to walk to his car and chat some more, so we huddled through the rain and sat in his beat-up toyota with the heater on. He looked at me with his beautiful blue eyes and asked if he could kiss me. So naturally we made out for like an hour haha. Then we parted ways and texted some more later in the evening.

He insisted on going to the beach with me for our second date, so I drove us there and we had a great time. I got to see him with his shirt off for the first time so I was internally screaming. Then we had a third date... and a fourth... and a fifth... until we eventually decided that we would be boyfriends. He asked me, to be clear. After that, I saw him literally every day and started bringing him over to my house to chill. A few months down the road, he wanted to come out of the closet, so I helped him come up with a good message to his parents and siblings. There was some initial blow-back from them, but half of his family was very receptive. We went on many trips together after that, and I fell deeper and deeper in love with him each day. He completed his twelve step program and really proved to me that he was living a much healthier lifestyle. A year later, we were still boyfriends, still madly in love, and he had started hinting to me that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and start a family. So I started to plan a proposal around the time of his birthday, but he caught on so I delayed it a few months. The following year we went on a ski trip and I proposed to him on a snowy trail overlooking the most beautiful frozen mountain landscape. And he said yes!

We have been together for almost two years now and we are currently planning our wedding. It's a very exciting time for us. Looking back, I realize that I got extremely lucky finding his profile on Tinder at the opportune moment. But I couldn't be happier that I found him."
