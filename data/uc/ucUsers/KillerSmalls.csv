Sephora,fpmgbcm,t3_ge5f3y,1588732456.0,What do you think of the Sol De Janerio spray? Is it spf?
UWMadison,fp854vq,t1_fp50esk,1588383764.0,"You make your allies where you can. There’s still cool men, and getting the right boss can really make or break things. Honestly, for me, it’s just that you have to work harder for longer to prove yourself. Imposter syndrome is something everyone gets. Aggressively seek out other female coworkers and make buds. It sounds corny, but it makes a world of a difference. Also, absolutely ditto everything /u/hobbular said."
UWMadison,fp4xfvx,t3_gbb98q,1588309970.0,"Graduated from UW 8 years ago. Female dev. Let me tell you, in the real world it doesn’t get better. It gets worse. On top of it, most of the guys are older than you which just adds another interesting later to the shit cake."
berkeley,fp4x7h1,t3_g8an1k,1588309783.0,"I found this thread because it got cross posted for where I went to college. Female software engineer, working for a few years now. Let me tell you, it doesn’t it get better.


The only hope I have is change is built brick my brick. It’s going to be a loooong time. More women are needed in the field to drown out the shitty."
The_Leftorium,fp39xmp,t1_fp2wztg,1588275647.0,"You know, there are nonrapists running."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fovao02,t1_foumff3,1588098153.0,Jesse Ventura was actually a pretty good gov in MN.
AustralianCattleDog,fogo72v,t1_foggz66,1587755041.0,That's so cute! I miss Chicago. I've got a Cattle Dog mix (with everything) who is barely over a year old. I can't wait till this pandemic is over so we can sign her up for some doggie sport and get her back in daycare once or twice a week!
AustralianCattleDog,fogfibo,t1_fofm43a,1587751919.0,"So cute. I'm originally from Chicago and wonder, how does a Cattle Dog do in the city? How do you get her energy out? This looks like Humboldt Park or a similarly densely populated neighborhood."
muacjdiscussion,fofurqq,t3_g7a116,1587743182.0,Please use different and secure passwords for each of your online accounts.  If someone managed you crack your ulta  account and you have the same login info for others you can be royally screwed.
OpenDogTraining,fobiwtt,t3_g6n6q6,1587660277.0,Robert Cabral. He's got a good youtube channel.
Pete_Buttigieg,fo4up66,t1_fo4rgx2,1587511578.0,He's objectively not. I expect a demoralizing general election.
Pete_Buttigieg,fo4qlcv,t3_g5i396,1587509315.0,Bernie supporter and lurker. God damn I wish it could have been Pete over Biden.
AsianBeauty,fnwhgz8,t1_fnvq00q,1587318459.0,"When I take baths I put the sheet mask packet in the hot bath for a minute so when I open it and put it on my face it’s warm. Feels so good.


Once I’m done w my sheetmasks, I won’t be buying anymore. They’re just pretty wasteful."
politics,fnmyj5y,t1_fnmxqup,1587080680.0,Ohio has handled this pretty well and they have a republican gov. This isn’t that black and white.
muacjdiscussion,fnlbj78,t3_g2cwdq,1587050611.0,"Such a high quality post. I would usually try to bundle my purchases into an annual or biannual online purchase at Nordstrom, or Bluemercury or Dermstora. Whatever had the best gift with purchase or hit up those 15% off sales. 

&#x200B;

It's nuts to see all these cosmetic companies having all these deep sales right now, so transparently a desperate cash grab to save their revenues. Now is really not the time to be taking advantage of these sales. I think just like millennial minimalism was trendy a few years ago in the wake of the recession, we will see something similar soon."
politics,fnav3tr,t1_fnas5ww,1586804346.0,"Reminder that Hillary 2016 moved left and lowered Medicare age to 50/55, and now Biden is offering us 60 as a Bernie concession. Hold his feet to the fire."
Coronavirus,flp0z7b,t1_flovwvx,1585349481.0,Nope. He's the one got that little bit in.
