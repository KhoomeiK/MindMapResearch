UCSD,fnyur1r,t3_g4ksu7,1587376420.0,"Is there an option at the end to write peer evaluations? When I did my CAT 3 group project, we were able to write evaluations for each other to let the TA know who did what. That way, if you do end up doing everything yourself, the TA would know."
sandiego,fnr9fua,t1_fnqyo9r,1587182615.0,HA I get this reference
UCSD,fnkkxcy,t3_g27t7v,1587031003.0,"I took both BIPN 134 and BIPN 100 with Cooke. I had a lot of fun in BIPN 134 and personally found the material to be easier (more intuitive) than BIPN 100 (Human Physiology I). His tests are mostly application rather than memorization though, like ""What would happen if...?""-type questions. What bio elective are you thinking of taking?"
UCSD,fmvicwh,t1_fmu6dcl,1586418042.0,Geez it's only week 2. Good luck!
UCSD,fmv5gic,t1_fmuwq7h,1586406586.0,"\^ Yup, you could knock out two birds with one stone. The class I took fulfilled requirements for my minor, DEI, and Sixth practicum."
UCSD,fmv5cp2,t3_fxiuy0,1586406504.0,"If they wouldn't do that for in-person lectures, then they shouldn't do that for online lectures."
UCSD,fmrkfio,t1_fmrdup9,1586325941.0,I'll send you a PM. I took it with Zhang.
UCSD,fmrdnha,t3_fwvsm3,1586320225.0,"I took CAT 125R last year and my TA suggested that we make something that can showcase our skills/talents. I want to teach science, so I made a Youtube video explaining a biology topic. Other ideas that she suggested were a video resume, website, or social media account."
UCSD,fmphu6r,t3_fwk7tg,1586281100.0,"Congrats on your acceptance! I’m a 4th year Physiology and Neuroscience major, so I’m not sure if I can answer your questions. But I just wanted to point out that the Neurobiology major only became available last year, so I’m not sure if there are any upperclassmen with that major."
gradadmissions,fmobxhn,t3_fvzcwg,1586253210.0,Oof I'm the worst. Ok I'm gonna do it tomorrow!
grandcanyon,fmkpqw4,t3_fvrmqv,1586163796.0,"I feel you. I started planning a trip to the Grand Canyon for late March, starting all the way back in November. I had booked the Airbnb, had a list of hikes I wanted to do, and then in March, things started to go completely downhill :(

It really sucks to have to cancel, but just think how great it would be to go on the trip and not have to worry about getting sick or things not being open and stuff like that."
