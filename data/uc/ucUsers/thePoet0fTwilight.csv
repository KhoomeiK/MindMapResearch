askmath,fo9wpdp,t1_fo9uv1t,1587633490.0,"I want the linear indepndence of the union and the components of the union to ensure disjointness of the the components. For ex - if we consider R^3, and the set A = {e_1, e_2} and B = {e_2, e_3}, where e_i are the standard basis vectors, defining A U B = {e_1, e_2, e_3}, A U B, A, and B are linearly independent sets, but A and B are not disjoint. But if we include repetitions, then we don't have sufficient premise for the claim and there's no reason why the claim should hold true, and it not doing so is alright. Thoughts?"

ucla,fo8isq2,t3_g5t9xj,1587597375.0,"As somebody who is taking Physics upper-divs currently, can confirm - there's gonna be practically no numbers, and they are pretty theoretical. The math can definitely get pretty intense - if you've taken the 1 series with Corbin, expect most upper divs to be of similar rigor, sometimes even on steroids (example: Putterman and VVV are known to be pretty tough, and trust me, Corbin will seem easy after them). Even though Math beyond 33B isn't a requirement, taking courses like Math 115A (Linear Algebra), Math/ Physics 132 (Complex Analysis) really help."
ucla,fo55xhi,t3_g5rc2d,1587518211.0,I had Prof. Hill for a Fiat Lux - seemed like a super duper sweet guy to me actually! Which class is this for?
ucla,fo518zo,t3_g5q5io,1587515348.0,"Don't know about Samueli, but from a close person's experience who had to meet academic counselling for her poor performance in a previous quarter, if they want to meet with you, you shouldn't just not make an appointment. They'll only help, if anything. I sincerely hope things get better with you, best of luck!, you can do it!"

ucla,fnwwi9a,t1_fnwuq1b,1587326824.0,"Sorry, but I don't see how studying is not practicing - I know he does more than enough sample problems in the class and in office hours and assigns hw (even though its easy, it still gives you some fluency with what each term means), and if you practice that much amd study his notes, how is any of it rote learning or not practicing? There is a thin line between the two - the two essentially go hand in hand, in whatever experience I've had so far."
ucla,fnwp19m,t3_g4cju0,1587322620.0,"Hey! I think I should chime in my two cents, having taken 1B and 1C with Corbin and having gotten A+s in them - despite popular opinion, Corbin isn't impossible. Of course he isn't ""god"" - it's a lower-div Physics class, after all, there has to be a limit to things. I would first like to acknowledge the fact that yes, he can be rude sometimes, but I also see where he's coming from - after having had extended conversations with him, he really appreciates it when students give in their best for trying to understand something and come up with sensible and logical questions. He doesn't entertain many questions in lecture because the man keeps 3-4 hours worth of office hours a week, you can ask him all you want there. He wants students to come with well-formed questions so he can give definite answers. And trust me, I've seen people ask absolutely non-sensical questions in office hours - they don't even know what they're asking. Why should he bother answering questions that they didn't put effort behind if he put so much effort behind teaching the material?

I'm not defending him or anything, I'm just trying to share my perspective as somebody who has been further down the line. About the teaching style - I agree with the fact that he is very thorough, but I don't see how that ""doesn't teach you Physics"". I don't think he ever said to memorize everything he taught you - he wants you to understand and be thorough. Heck, Physics is never about memorizing - if you understand things well enough, you will be able to produce results straight out of your head. If you really understand the logical path he took to introduce topics, you will remember the order in which he discussed things and why. I don't know how this is ""not learning Physics principles"", as you and u/LaserPigeons point out. Physics done at a higher level isn't qualitative - it's an essential blend of both intuitive and Mathematical reasoning, and this is a recurring theme that I've seen in the upper-divs I have taken, and I have more than benefited from the skills he taught in the class. And trust me, if you stick with it, when he gets to EM Waves and Special Relativity in 1C, you'll never have seen more beautiful Physics. 

And, on an ending note, of course the class isn't for people who hate Physics and just want to take it and pass, if that is the case, you would undoubtedly have a hard time and the ten weeks would be a soul-sucking experience. But even if you are an Engineer and your work will involve Physics (EE/ MechE, and Aero), the man has something (I would say quite a bit) of value to offer to you."

ucla,fmqfzif,t3_fwu3vy,1586298884.0,I feel sad. Take my upvote.

Physics,fmq9pz6,t1_fmq908t,1586295529.0,"The caption literally says deriving the center of gravity using net torque. Of course OP expects you to know what torque is. Moreover, if you had never heard of torque, you should probably be watching an intro video to rotational mechanics, not this. Moreover, I don't think lack of information should be called confusion."
Physics,fmgxyzz,t1_fmgxqy1,1586060895.0,No worries there!
