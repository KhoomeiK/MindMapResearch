berkeley,fp7st8a,t1_fp7ldfr,1588377057.0,"Honestly, I'm not too sure. Data Science is probably more widely applicable to many careers but media studies might help you out a lot specifically with regards to UX Design."
berkeley,fp7ibpd,t1_fp7hvpi,1588371161.0,"Well, Calc 2 is a prerequisite for many courses that one would probably want to take if they want a career in tech. When you say work in tech, do you have any specific career in mind?"
berkeley,fp411m2,t3_gb4jej,1588289590.0,"Branch out and find stuff that interests you. Invest your time into those things. Stay on top of your academics. Don't do activities just because you think they will look cool on your application. If you do things that you actually enjoy, that will shine through on your application and you will definitely have a better chance of being accepted than someone who comes across as disingenuous because they don't actually enjoy the things they do.

I remember when I was writing my PIQs (the essays that you write on your application), one of my essays was about a club that I was in. It wasn't a club that I particularly enjoyed, and I only wrote about it because I thought it would look ""good"" to the admissions committee. That essay was extremely dry and boring, because I just didn't have any passion for the topic. I switched the essay to be about my interest in astrophysics, something that I actually enjoy. The essay instantly became far better than my previous one, just by virtue of the fact that I was being genuine.

So, the ""secret formula"" is simply to have good academics and do things you like. Most of all, don't forget to have fun."

berkeley,fooeca3,t3_g8llsv,1587937446.0,"I would recommend doing CS 61A over the summer. Works very well in an all-online format, and it's nice to get a head start. You could probably do a general ed as well, depending on how comfortable you are with CS.

I'm also a CS major interested in physics (I'm eyeing a double major with astrophysics). I'd like to do the Physics 5 series but I feel it would be too much in addition to the CS techs I need to be taking. Plus, I hear that it doesn't really matter too much in the long term whether you take the 5 or 7 series. If you want to take a look, here's a thread I made a while ago asking for advice about choosing 5 series vs 7 series: https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f6y8xj/physics_7a_vs_physics_5a/."
berkeley,fonyhgy,t3_g8kf8h,1587928968.0,"This semester, Hilfinger shifted his grade bins upwards in order to match Hug's distribution. This was reverted in light of the COVID-19 crisis, but I expect he will do this going forwards in future semesters so that there is a negligible discrepancy between his and Hug's grade distribution.


Also, if you wanted Hilfinger, you would have to wait an entire year as Hug is teaching it for this entire academic year last I checked."
berkeley,fongi05,t1_fonflhb,1587919044.0,"Not neccesarily. The grade distribution itself was amazing for a Math 53 class. However, the tests were so easy that the grade bins were absolutely wack. I personally got 95 on MT2 and 89 on Mt1 and the final (clobbered), and that translated to a B+. I'm certain Canic will toughen up her exams this semester."

berkeley,foge66n,t3_g7azz4,1587751431.0,"I took it Fall 2019. It's not that bad, and the professors are cool. The only homework is weekly quizzes based on the assigned readings. But it's definitely a ton of rote memorization. I ended up P/NP'ing it because I wanted to focus on my other classes. If you want an easy A, I wouldn't choose this class. Also, there is required attendance enforced via clicker."

berkeley,fnz5n1h,t1_fny4wfp,1587386701.0,"I just started actually studying lol. The ""studying"" I did for my first midterm was absolutely trash. I just looked over the textbook a couple times. In the future, I made sure to actually devote a lot of time to doing and understanding exam-level problems. Past exams for classes generally easily available online, and you can basically use them as study guides."
berkeley,fnx9h51,t3_g4flws,1587334132.0,I basically came from the same situation as you. It's a rough transition but you will be fine. My wake up call was failing my first math midterm here. I fixed my shit real quick after that lol.

* Astron C10 (best professor at Cal teaches this class. Filippenko is filled with boundless passion and it shows in his teaching. 10/10 would reccomend.)

* COMPSCI 61A (You will appreciate CS after taking this class).

Least: MCB 55 (plagues and pandemics) - Professors were cool but bio isn't my cup of tea. Found it funny in a twisted way that I took this class the semester before a global pandemic."
