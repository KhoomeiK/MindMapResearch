vscode,foss492,t1_fos9tey,1588036906.0,I want VS Code to run assembly code and ideally display register values during debugging.
vscode,fospwvw,t1_fosoma4,1588035613.0,"It is x86 cpu's we are working with. I have that downloaded, but from what I understand that is only going to support syntax and instruction set error checking.

I am familiar with c++ config files for compilation and execution. However, I know that you don't compile assembly, it is translated to object code and then linked. Is it even possible to set VS code up to display various register values and to assemble assembly language programs?"
WildernessBackpacking,fo5azpn,t3_g5r8rz,1587521397.0,"This is actually Upper Maggie Lake in Golden Trout Wilderness (Sierra Nevada, CA). There is Middle and Lower Magie Lakes just down the slope. 

I didn't get a chance to peak Maggie Mountain so that is on the list for next time. The area is supremely gorgeous and has a very nice campsite for a semi-large group. 

Only 9 miles from the trailhead, this makes for a great 3 day trip with a 0-day in the middle to explore nearby peaks, swim, and fish.

On this trip, a bunch of us took mushrooms, hung in hammocks, and had a great time in the isolation and remoteness of the mountains."
WildernessBackpacking,fo5545w,t1_fo54v5o,1587517702.0,"You're the closest one so far, but south of Yosemite. Actually this is one of the most southern 'alpine' lakes of the Sierras."

classicwow,fmfelun,t1_fmepy6s,1586025627.0,We don’t know if corrupted ashbringer scaled or not. Additionally it does scale with weapon speed it just remains proportional. That’s why mcps are good. You get higher sp scaling from it being a 2 handed and then you half the weapon speed by the use but remain the higher scaling of the weapon speed.
