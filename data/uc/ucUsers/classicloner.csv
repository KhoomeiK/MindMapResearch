ucr,fpmh1hx,t1_fpmenmq,1588732903.0,"I think we both were misinterpreting what we were trying to convey. It's definitely hard to get your point across over the internet vs in person where you can also pick up on other ques such as body language and tone. Either way, I agree with everything you said. Thank you for fighting the stigma mate."

ucr,fphhacr,t3_gdhzgv,1588621263.0,"For those of you wondering about the student rec fees, this is what he said in the video at 8:28:

""The rec center fee does several things. One: It pays essentially the mortgage on the facilities that we have. And the students many, several years ago agreed to pay that to build these facilities. And the facilities have to be sustained, and we have to continue to pay the mortgage on those buildings. So part of that fee is is committed and we can't really refund it because it's already been spent."""

ucr,fpeiaqg,t1_fpehwpt,1588548086.0,"Yeah, I understand. Your intent with the comment wasn't coming from a malicious place, the way it was phrased just made it sound arrogant.

Edit: lmao I was being nice until I saw you edited your comment. It's really funny how you think I called you arrogant for doing well in your classes. No, that's completely fine, good fucking job with that. I was calling your comment arrogant because it made you seem selfish and made it seem as though you had a complete disregard to anyone other than yourself.

Edit pt 2: I'm not saying this to hurt your feelings. I was just answering the question you put at the bottom of the post."

You posted your questions after the quiz was already locked so them considering that cheating is honestly beyond me.  I personally don't think they'll do anything. As someone that also has GAD, I get what you're going through mentally. Everything will be fine in the end, trust me. Keep everything documented as someone else in the comments have stated. Screenshot when you sent the messages and also make sure to keep the copy of the email you sent to the TA."

ucr,fpa437f,t1_fpa30uf,1588440404.0,"We had multiple proctors breathing down our necks but that's about all they did. They didn't ask to show us our rooms or anything (but they did include that survey thing in our exam where we had to check off that we were alone and there were no open tabs). Honestly, I'm sure if you tell your professor, you should be fine. Your professor didn't write that survey thing where you had to guarantee all that stuff so they might not be that strict. It's definitely work a shot!"
ucr,fp8uvdj,t1_fp8o0be,1588403782.0,A lot of professors are including the same question set in their ilearn exams. I got the same exact question on my exam for bio.
ucr,fp54jel,t3_gbcv36,1588316063.0,There's no definitive answer as of now. I recommend not signing a lease until we hear something from Wilcox himself. I'm sure they'll keep us in the loop towards the end of summer so people can make accommodations.
ucr,fp4lvm9,t1_fp4ldam,1588301913.0,"Yes I'm against it. I'm taking prereq classes for graduate schools and many of them said that they won't accept p/f. Also many people are putting in a lot of effort to raise their gpa's so taking the grading system away will prevent them from doing so. But with that being said, that's just my stance on the issue. You're entitled to your own opinion and so am I :-). If anything, it should be made optional & that way, everyone will be happy"

ucr,fp37h1i,t1_fp35yzr,1588274423.0,"That's a valid thing to be concerned about 100%. If Fall quarter does proceed to be online, UCR will more than likely let us know in advance closer to when school starts so everyone can make accommodations"
ucr,fp34d0v,t3_gb1lhl,1588272872.0,"I'm very sorry to hear that you're going through that.

If you ever need to talk to someone or anything, feel free to pm me!"
ucr,fp33qjh,t1_fp33731,1588272568.0,"Exactly, no one really knows at the end of the day. We're barely starting May as of now and a lot of things can change in the span of a couple months. Better to be hopeful than stressed out for something that may or may not even happen"
trashy,fp31ztr,t1_fp2316w,1588271725.0,"That's literally the whole point of TikTok. You dub your videos over with whatever song (or audio to be more general) is available in the app and he specifically chose that one himself. This was even posted on his account and isn't the only video of him doing this.

Edit: Clarity"
ucr,fp2zzvx,t3_gb0tz0,1588270747.0,"Maybe a solid 50 percent. There's currently a lot of clinical trials going on and some are in phase 3 so it really depends on where that goes and how many cases there are towards the end of summer. Everything's in the air right now because we're still early on.

Edit: Also professors from other UC's that I know were told it's going to be online however, nothing's really definite as of now. They're ""planning"" on it but who knows. It's better to be hopeful as of now.

\- Changed it to 50% because of another comment that I agree with lmao"
trashy,fp1wky4,t1_fp1s106,1588249799.0,"lol Just because he's not singing it directly doesn't make it any less wrong. Imagine specifically picking this song and walking up to the clerk and playing it as a ""joke."" It's disgusting."

At the end of the day, as you said everyone's into all different types of things and that's perfectly fine as long as kids aren't involved!"

ucr,fo0i7jk,t3_g4zwct,1587413597.0,"It honestly depends on what you're good at. I can't weigh your choices for you directly since everything is subjective however, I can say that for me at least, I really love being a Bio major. I think Biology is super fun and interesting but, at the end of the day you might not like Bio. Same goes with psychology. Don't pick a major solely on what you heard people claim to be easy, pick a major that you're interested in. Your interests and how well you do most of the time align.  But with that being said, I did in fact hear people say psychology is easier but if you're premed, you're going to basically be taking the same classes as a Bio major for your requirements. Upper divisions is a different story ofc."
ucr,fo0cyjn,t3_g4z500,1587410620.0,"Honestly, it's really hard to say especially since we're still relatively in the early stages of how everything will pan out.

Just focus on this quarter and don't stress yourself out with hypotheticals. We'll all get through this!"

ucr,fnx6jwq,t3_g4fwp9,1587332468.0,"What's your major? 

Bio majors for example, usually take gen chem and bio together their first year, then they take ochem and upper divs their second year. Physics can be taken your second year if you're ok with the triple threat (taking upperdivs, ochem and physics) OR it can be taken your third / fourth year (preferebly second because physics is a pre-rec for some classes)."
ucr,fmmaj4w,t1_fmm8xvh,1586201798.0,"I agree with your point. It's a huge change and it's drastically affected people in different ways. I like to think that the administration is doing what's best for everyone but, I know that's not 100% the case especially when it comes to some of the tuition-  like being charged for a gym we can't even use. Either way, if the situation is super stressful for people, contacting their professor is the best option. Many professors are being more lenient this quarter and are more understanding with everything going on. I wish you the best this quarter!"
ucr,fmm72fh,t3_fw4m2y,1586199981.0,That would wreak havoc for a lot of people applying to graduate schools imo. I feel like some schools would certainly be understanding while others won't especially if the classes taken are one of their required courses to apply to that school.
