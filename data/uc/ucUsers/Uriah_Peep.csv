neoliberal,fox4ulm,t3_g9r7of,1588134107.0,Really enjoying it. It’s not a hardcore podcast in any way but it’s better than Hacks on Tap and that gets a way bigger audience.
AskReddit,fokidku,t3_g7ug3r,1587842625.0,"“At Broken Hill, in Australia, men had been mining lead and silver for thirty years; the refuse from the extraction of these metals lay in dumps like mountains about the mines.”

Pretty grim, I’d say."
nintendo,fokgosn,t1_fokghu2,1587841733.0,"Yeah.. we have started doing Animal Crossing and have a dedicated Slack channel for it, but it’s just not the same. We also used to do happy hour every month and that was a fun time that’s badly missed!"
nintendo,fokgh29,t1_fojyzcp,1587841620.0,Never thought about this.. it’s like having to wear part of your work uniform all the time!
nintendo,fokgf0u,t1_fojy82v,1587841591.0,Yeah it’s 85 degrees out today and I keep thinking how nice it’d be to hang out at the water. Or just go someplace where there’s AC...
nintendo,fokg9s9,t3_g7vuf0,1587841513.0,"I’m looking forward to seeing the employees that I supervise. We all work remotely now and as corny as it sounds, I’m looking forward to us all working in the same space again and being able to actually see each other again and have a real connection."
apple,foc9hs8,t1_fobzw8g,1587668682.0,"Apple laptops did not have a 1-2 hour max battery life. They were typically rated for 5-6 hours and that was realistic, even up to the highest-spec G4 PowerBooks."
VintageApple,fo9hvof,t1_fo84obh,1587619986.0,"Discontinued. =/

When'd you get yours?"
UCI,fo53pp9,t1_fo4aela,1587516841.0,"Bruh they gonna announce this by mid-May I bet, at the *latest*. If they announce we going online for fall people are gonna piiiissed if they don’t get enough notice"
VintageApple,fo37ekg,t1_fo10ndk,1587481936.0,"As soon as someone posted (maybe in this subreddit) a picture of how electronics in prisons use clear plastics I can’t unsee the comparison. It was extremely weird how my interest in this fell off a cliff after that.

Though I did see one on eBay where the pics showed the plastic looking super clear and it actually did look attractive again."
neoliberal,fnwd4yx,t1_fnuw8yv,1587316104.0,">	I'd rather have trump as president than a creepy guy with dementia

This doesn’t compute for me. It’s like saying “I’d rather have Obama as president than the first black president.” You’re describing the same person with both ends of your sentence."
lastimages,fnuwumm,t1_fnuvai5,1587273253.0,You’re also not saying you don’t believe it was an inside job.
Amd,fnuwgg5,t3_g3p39d,1587272945.0,Probably the best looking case interior I’ve seen in my life. I can only get so aroused OP.
gifs,fntnyu5,t1_fntnbry,1587245475.0,Yet another idiot on Reddit making themselves sound like an expert by lying and using concrete language.
NintendoSwitchDeals,fntmc5x,t1_fnt50zk,1587244539.0,You won’t. The real tragedy is that the last major game retailer that will ever exist is a company like GameStop.
IAmA,fnr6il3,t3_g3b4q2,1587180506.0,Gary! You were in Under Siege with Tommy Lee Jones. What was that like? Tell us a Seagal story!

PresidentialRaceMemes,fnaqiob,t1_fnabjdr,1586802048.0,When did this subreddit get taken over by Russian trolls? This used to be kind of a joyful fun place and now nothing here makes any sense at all.
UCI,fn1pyyh,t1_fn1ke1y,1586567419.0,Burds
UCI,fmse7ks,t1_fmrv4qc,1586353587.0,He clearly already has an email filter set up to get rid of the messages automatically. This just seems like complaining for the sake of it.
UCI,fmr36fs,t3_fwuq5l,1586312807.0,Then don’t. They’ll help other people.
Coronavirus,fmle58e,t1_fmkqr74,1586184590.0,So he’s like reddit comments but in the form of a single person.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fmkd19v,t1_fmjlqag,1586150993.0,"Me.

I like him. I wholeheartedly support him.

Now you can stop saying this."
