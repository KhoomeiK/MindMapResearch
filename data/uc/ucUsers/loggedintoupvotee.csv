leagueoflegends,fp57171,t1_fp55x1a,1588318519.0,"I believe it when people say he's toxic....I just don't think those clips are the same magnitude as the comments say. Maybe there's other stuff he did in-game?

Because you could argue his pressure stopped the enemy from pushing (someone had to answer him) and got him free xp/gold. Pro teams ALWAYS send a split at least temporarily when the other team is ahead (and is about to siege with baron). And the enemy weren't even able to threaten or get inhib...worth? 

I'm sure there's other griefing he did during the game as seen by his score. But those clips just show the rage without the proof."
leagueoflegends,fp56nne,t1_fp55zra,1588318134.0,"Solo is toxic but tbf the main clip and none of the 3 clips showed this. I believe you, but where's this crazy inting on the clips? I was expecting much more based on these comments..."
MrRobot,fp4hzk6,t1_fp3w8jh,1588299468.0,The other episodes were good TV. But 4.7 was a masterpiece with an insane but rewarding twist. I've never seen anything like it from the tone to the narrative structure. Probably my favorite episode of any show.
westworld,fosy2q4,t1_fos7mdu,1588040462.0,"Does HBO have any creative control over these projects? Didn't they essentially give GoT a blank check? Don't the directors/producers/writers or whatever create the story? Could be wrong but I feel like HBO, Netflix, etc just get the team together and distribute the material."
UCSD,fo64lls,t1_fo62mky,1587546299.0,"Sometimes professors bluff and say ""report yourself"" or we will do a full investigation/find proof from your peers that you did it. Same with clicker cheaters. Idk what happened with this one though."
freefolk,fo2df8x,t1_fo2aemw,1587458171.0,"Even if they have to have ""game of thrones"" battle as the finale, at least do the white walker plot justice rather than ending it in 1 fucking night."
dankmemes,fo2cm2u,t1_fo2a252,1587457313.0,"Gist, Giraffe, Gin, Gillette (if you count brands)...

Off the top of my head with a slight bit of thinking..."
TeamSolomid,fn8h59h,t1_fn8e6ao,1586741534.0,Yeah. Officially rooting for c9 rest of the split. Zven deserves that NA title.
freefolk,fmza8q4,t1_fmz0t8e,1586512613.0,"Plus the ""bad episodes"" weren't even close to the atrocities of 7 and 8 imo."
movies,fmtfjps,t1_fmtbpug,1586371858.0,"I agree. It was a decent movie with an interesting premise but very over-hyped. The themes were so heavy-handed and crude. No subtlety or suspension of disbelief, especially towards the end."
politics,fmsxg3c,t1_fmsx6wf,1586363513.0,"Biden was poised to win the nomination and was way ahead in the primary election points. It was only a matter of time. Bernie gets hyped up a ton on reddit and the young community but America as a whole think he's too radical and want a ""safer"" guy like Biden."
leagueoflegends,fmclrf2,t1_fmckct1,1585948116.0,G2 was running it down the last 15 minutes. And it almost fucking worked. One of the most insane games I've ever seen.
