Supplements,fnyrkmu,t1_fnyk1ut,1587372994.0,"Raw vegetable fibers are incredibly difficult for humans to digest. Our stomachs can't break them down well. This is made worse by the fact that western humans' digestive systems are already weakened by various things in our food, water, and environment. This is also why it is common to get bloating and indigestion from consuming raw vegetables.

The biggest reason for cooked is to soften up the vegetable fibers so that we can very easily absorb the minerals locked inside them. Minerals are needed greatly by humans today, I would go as far to say mineral deficiencies are the number one cause of poor human health. The increased mineral bioavailability achieved by cooking far outweighs minor losses in water soluble vitamins. There are also numerous antinutrients that are destroyed when cooking vegetables. Also, and the best part for many- they taste better and are easier to eat cooked."

Supplements,fnyf2mi,t1_fnyduhz,1587361203.0,"If your goal is the longest and healthiest life possible, I have a few more key nutrition recommendations that you may find helpful: cut out all added sugar from diet, eat plenty of steamed vegetables (organic if you can get them), eat at least SOME quality animal foods (doesn't have to be a lot even just one or two pastured eggs a day is huge), avoid soy, avoid gluten; gluten free whole grains are good in moderation. Spring water is best. Try to limit fruit to 1-2 servings since it is quite sugary, cooked vegetables are superior. 

I'm a student of Nutrition and these are the most important ones IMO. You will see massive benefits within a month from just removing sugar alone. Feel free to ask any questions at all about any of these and I can go into detail. Cheers!"
