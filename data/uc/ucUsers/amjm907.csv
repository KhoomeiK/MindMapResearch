InstacartShoppers,fpd5vpf,t3_gcrs5a,1588520481.0,"I’m a cashier at a grocery store and started doing instacart because 
1) essential work for non essential pay, everyone I know working at my store works at least 2 jobs. 
2) we are out here exposing ourselves anyways, if I’m a shopper that’s one fewer person that needs to be and expose themselves since I would be already. 
3) We’re good shoppers! We know how grocery stores work and have the customer service experience that makes us perfect for this job (there’s a reason when you first sign up they ask if you’ve worked in a grocery store/customer service) 

This guys arrogance is one thing, but everyone’s just trying to do what they gotta do right now."
InstacartShoppers,fop937q,t1_fop6vjx,1587955826.0,How long have you done instacart? You can’t see batch individual batch summaries until a weekly summary is available so if you haven’t completed a week yet it wouldn’t show
InstacartShoppers,foo5hbl,t1_foo5d96,1587932886.0,Lol I live like across the street from the CVS and the person was in the building right next door
InstacartShoppers,foo4u6u,t3_g8d9mu,1587932524.0,I never accept these orders until I did and was pleasantly surprised by [the results ](https://imgur.com/a/4XoKoEq)
ucla,fok2vwu,t1_foj75d8,1587834383.0,"Assignments: there are in class assignments that are basically participation points and helpful for learning and prepping for quizzes. There was an “about me” PowerPoint presentation (pretty easy and lowkey) and a group video project about a topic in deaf culture. 

HW: your only homework assignments are video journals. Basically you get questions and you film yourself signing the answers and upload that video. They’re always questions related to/using signs and vocab from that weeks lesson. 

Tests/quizzes: tests are broken up into two parts: written and interview. The written is basically you watch videos of people signing and answer written questions based on when they are signing to test your receptive skills. And then interviews would normally be you get with a partner in the class and you have a list of questions and you film yourselves asking and answering the questions to eachother, like basically a scripted scene. You can film as many tries as you like as long as it’s turned in within the time frame. These were tests/quizzes and then for your final and midterm there was a written part and then the presentations/video project are the other parts of the midterm/final grade respectively. 

I’m not sure if/how any of these formats change now that it’s online."
InstacartShoppers,fodl6b1,t1_fodkujf,1587686057.0,It’s the shoppers responsibility to cancel the batch then at which point I’m pretty sure the batch reappears in the queue of available batches for shoppers to select. Did they already checkout of the store? I would just be wary if they try to get you to cancel
InstacartShoppers,fodkjca,t3_g6xohb,1587685831.0,Did they give a reason why they can’t finish it?

ucla,fo1jkm6,t3_g4k5l2,1587434684.0,"I took ASL 8 last summer and loved it so much continued and am in ASL 6 now! Ben (the prof) is an amazing teacher and an even better human being. My experience will be quite different from people taking it this summer since it will be online for summer. M-F 9-3 seems like a lot but he always gave us two shorter breaks and an hour lunch break plus we ended class early most days and played a lot of games so it was really engaging and fun most of the time. By the second day the class is completely immersive so no speaking is allowed since Ben is deaf so it’s kind of you get with it and swim or sink behind. There’s a super helpful TA/interpreter but she doesn’t actually interpret for the class but has tutoring/office hours where you can ask questions and speak and discuss whatever (I found going very helpful and also fun bc you play more games haha). I really do feel like the intense, immersive experience (especially at the beginning of learning the language) really helped me learn it a lot better. Again, this summer’s experience will probably be v different but if you have more specific questions about summer or have questions about how we do online class now for ASL lmk!"

InstacartShoppers,fnf4yeo,t3_g1eope,1586901487.0,I’m so sorry it sounds like your shopper scammed you. Contact support and report them. As shoppers if we ever pay for products personally there is a process on our end to get reimbursement through instacart.
InstacartShoppers,fnf2xg1,t1_fnf2q2f,1586900432.0,I was especially suspicious because it was for Ralph’s haha. The Erewhon order was pretty believable
InstacartShoppers,fne2nan,t1_fne21by,1586881979.0,"To clarify, the person I delivered to is a charity fundraiser and she is the one with the masks and already had a bunch in her home that she was giving to people in need and she gave me one. I didn’t buy them at a store or for that delivery for her."
InstacartShoppers,fne1boi,t1_fne0vi1,1586881305.0,She actually did give me a couple of them when I gave her the delivery :)
