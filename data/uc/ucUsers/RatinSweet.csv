However, FPF was not too bad, classes were easy, and you can get your breadths out the way. The only bad thing is I don't think they offer a lot of major-related classes, and it costs like 3k more or something. If you are CS, I would avoid it lol because most of your friends take 61A in the fall and you'd be behind."
berkeley,fpdmi03,t1_fpaupw3,1588529916.0,">From what I’ve heard it is most likely going to be in person and online Will be an option. There is pretty much 0% chance that the entire semester will be cancelled.

This makes sense. Yesterday, schools across the country have insisted on opening for the fall, in states with worse responses than Cali. I think hybrid, discussions, lab, etc in person, makes absolutely the most sense. People our age group have a flu-like mortality rate. There are treatments coming out weekly. Antibody tests show a large portion already infected, lower death rates, etc.

Those who are vulnerable (actually, the biggest risk factor is being overweight, with being male a huge factor as well) or live with vulnerable people should choose the online option. I spend a lot of time on r/COVID19, but I'm not an expert at all, so don't take what I say seriously. Do take seriously when I tell you all to avoid r/Coronavirus like you avoid Anant Sahai."
berkeley,fpdlcif,t1_fpd18io,1588529258.0,"I actually enjoyed the project. I thought part 3 was actually the hardest, especially given the insane readings. Speed up is really not as complicated as people make it out to be. Most of the code can be copied from the labs (12 and 9 in particular). Then, it's just trial and error to see which approach is best.

On that note, I hate how we only get 3 submissions instead of 6. I know there's good reason, though I wish they had the performance test available to run locally instead of having to submit on grade scope.

You can always write your own script to measure speedup though, which shouldn't be terribly complicated."
berkeley,fpdl53n,t3_gcqs1f,1588529140.0,"I'd like to add on to isakgavin has said. mat mul really is the bottleneck, but to speed it up is actually just the same as some of the labs (lab12 particularly). Once you figured out how to ""alter' to matrix so that you can SIMD, just look at the labs for guidance.

Also, I didn't need to SIMD everything (in fact, I only used SIMD on one function), but I would highly recommend pragma-ing everything you can. I got perfect on performance, at least until they decide to change the AG.

1. The first wave was completely new. We had terrible projections (Imperial College, etc), the test kit debacle, hidden community spread over months, etc. Also, wearing masks was discouraged, not encouraged, which turned out to be really stupid.
2. The first wave already infected a lot of people, especially those who are most vulnerable. Spread in nursing homes have accounted for a huge percentage of deaths (I think in NJ, they're at least a 25% of the deaths, but like 1% of the total cases).
3. We have more treatments like plasma and more preventative measures like antibody testing, testing in general, and mask wearing."

* NYC has a significant black and latino population. Both are at higher risks of both types of diabetes (even if you're skinny), obesity, etc. There is a higher percentage of people with pre-existing conditions.
* Many people go in and out of NYC. If we look at the total people who've been in NYC but left (whether for a quick visit or longer stay), there may actually be 16,000,000 or so people who've been in NYC and contracted the virus in NYC.

2. Were immune to a disease for much longer than one year, sometimes forever. That’s why we only need some vaccines once in our lives. Some vaccines, like the flu shot, we need every year because the flu tends to mutate enough in a year so that our body isn’t actually immune to that newer version. There’s no evidence that coronavirus is mutating even close to the rate of the flu, so I feel like this is an disingenuous concern from you. 
3. Spanish flu may have come in three waves, but you literally have a sample size of 1. Ebola, SARS, MERS, swine flu, etc all had one big wave. Swine flu infected wayyy more people than covid and yet it didn’t come back. There’s an inverse relationship between the deadliness of a virus and it’s transmissibility. If something as transmissible as the swine flu only stuck around for one season, I’m confident covid will not come in three waves."
