AskReddit,fozq3gm,t1_fozfkpf,1588194898.0,"I feel like what makes it trash is that it should have been good. There‚Äôs an interesting story there, but the movie was bad. 
Also, when someone or many people hype it up so much, it pisses you off even more because you know it ain‚Äôt good."
AskReddit,fozpx7a,t1_foytw3r,1588194811.0,"SAME! I though I was going to love it, but it was a bad movie. I was very disappointed, I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life. It had so much good things going for it, from some of the acting and the idea itself, but the execution and ending were lackluster."

As soon as you can check your portal (when you have sent in your official transcripts to UCR after graduation) you will see all your cc classes and the requirements they cover online."

I used to get major anxiety over a bunch of things, but once you realize that thinking about it makes no difference, it gets better. 
Hope you‚Äôre doing well."

ucr,fnfsh7j,t3_g1gj5y,1586914521.0,"Yes, I spoke to customer service and ordered them more than two weeks ago. They‚Äôre usually very quick, but I understand why they‚Äôre taking long right now.

I feel you though. I was stressing today, and now, a weight has been lifted from me. I‚Äôm very happy that they did this."
ucr,fnfs7w8,t1_fnejhh7,1586914369.0,Yes. It will come soon enough :)
ucr,fnb6x61,t3_g0quqp,1586810277.0,"‚ÄúPaid parking is required 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when parking on campus with the exception of gold lots 26, 30, 32 and 50 which are free after 6:00 PM Monday-Friday and all day on the weekends.‚Äù

I just googled this and got the info from https://transportation.ucr.edu/frequently-asked-questions#when_are_parking_permits_required

So you probably won‚Äôt get parking at the dorms but you can park it for free during these times. Otherwise, I guess you‚Äôll need to buy a parking pass to leave it on campus during the day."
ucr,fnas853,t1_fnaiuz8,1586802904.0,"Just call the IRS customer service phone number and press all the numbers needed until they lead you to a representative. It takes a few tries but you‚Äôll figure it out. I don‚Äôt know the sequence of numbers you have to press, otherwise I would tell you. It sprays takes me calling at least 3 times until I figure it out."

I renewed my apartment contract before the rona happened, but I cancelled for Spring. So I left my things at my apartment like my bed and frame, and they asked us to turn in a liability waiver. They included it in the email telling us how to cancel our housing contract."
ucr,fmjzsgq,t3_fvq5lg,1586141169.0,"Not yet. I called and they said it‚Äôs taking a while for them to get through all of our cancellations.
Anyone else forgot to turn in the Liability waiver?"
