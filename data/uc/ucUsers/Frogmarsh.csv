FederalEmployees,fpczwit,t3_gck432,1588516791.0,"I like to think of it in terms of the military equivalent. https://www.federalpay.org/articles/civilian-to-military-rank

A GS-13 is equivalent to a major, a GS-14 is equivalent to a lieutenant colonel, and a GS-15 is equivalent to a colonel. SES positions are the generalship. There are many retiring majors in the military who have had a very gratifying career topping out at major. The number of colonels is a fraction of the number of majors; there just aren’t that many positions available. If the lack of money is a problem, then a turn to the private sector is in order. This is what drives many in the military to move on. Same for the civilian side."

KansasCityChiefs,fol4k8q,t3_g7zvwh,1587854757.0,"The selection of a running back in the first is flawed for many reasons. 

1) Edwards-Helaire is a good player but it was a reach for a position the Chiefs didn’t have a great need at (many of you will argue otherwise, and I get that). Most pundits had higher-rated running backs coming off the board first, but rarely in the first round. The Chiefs won the Super Bowl with an undrafted free agent who was arguably worthy of the Super Bowl MVP. Good running backs can be found throughout the draft; given that the game is largely a passing game now, why invest in a position that can be satisfied later in the draft?

2) Will Edwards-Helaire change the outcome of any game? It’s hard to see how. The Chiefs went 12-4 in the regular season; did they lose any game because of their running game?

3) He’ll also exit the game much, much earlier than other players selected around him because running backs don’t last (they play, on average, the fewest years of any position). With a first round choice, you’d like someone to last 10 or more years. It is hard to see Edwards-Helaire lasting that long, unless he’s the second coming of Darren Sproles. He was comp’ed by Reid and Veach to Brian Westbrook; Westbrook played 7 years.

4) Selecting an improvement to the offense, which is a top-5 offense without Edwards-Helaire, came at the expense of improving the defense, a defense with a number of holes.

After all is said and done, Edwards-Helaire will almost certainly perform well, but that performance won’t be enough to justify the selection at that place in the draft."
