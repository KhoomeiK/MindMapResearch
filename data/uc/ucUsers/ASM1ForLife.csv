berkeley,fommda4,t3_g8an1k,1587895532.0,"damn, I lowkey do point A with whoever I help with work, male or female. I used to tutor kids in high school so it may be a remainder of that, but usually I do it just to gauge where the person is at. and I guess I use a lot of positive reinforcement. if itâ€™s seen as condescending that makes me a little bit sad"

playboicarti,fofbq4j,t1_fof4kon,1587732119.0,Keyboards adapt to your typing style with something called LSTM. Itâ€™s basically an application of machine learning that stops autocorrecting things you donâ€™t want it to. So your LSTM is different from his.

playboicarti,fo6xedd,t3_g62omm,1587568504.0,"i think people thinking he was dropping the album monday was dumb. and the fact that he literally announced the album monday, after confirming friday something was coming on monday, is good enough. just sucks he hasn't said anything about a release date, but that's how he works i guess"

berkeley,fmxsn3z,t3_fy07bq,1586471088.0,"hi, this happened to me for the first HW assignment. i was working closely with someone (during lab section) who apparently had found a solution online for question 5 and was using said question as a solution, and during lab i tried to use it as a solution (it didn't work, and set off a red flag in their system i think.) if you were flagged, you probably did something similar, even if you don't realize it. reach out to them and try to tell them what you think happened. when i got a similar email, i thought that i was totally in the right, only to realize i was in the wrong later."
