GlobalOffensive,fpjfnn9,t3_gdgqh2,1588666743.0,Makes me wonder how players without orgs stay afloat. Or what kinds of jobs they’re doing full time. Some stream but I doubt that’s enough to get by
sanfrancisco,fpepzsq,t1_fpelmbl,1588552479.0,"don't mind the comment, thanks for your mod work. it's hard to keep on top of small details, no worries"
algorithms,fpci6ng,t3_gcj4y5,1588501436.0,"There are a bunch of channels on YouTube. If dropping some names is allowed, theres back to back swe, Kevin naughton jr., errichto, to name a few"

bayarea,fotnemz,t1_fotik73,1588059478.0,My university is in talks to make fall online and potentially even the whole school year so not sure about schools reopening
csgobetting,fosyk8l,t1_fosyi5n,1588040759.0,I don’t think it’s that clear cut. If ence gets train they can take it.
csgobetting,fosuqtp,t3_g974nu,1588038455.0,Anyone else feeling an ence +1.5
csgobetting,fossrxf,t1_fordo8n,1588037294.0,that doesn't exist anymore. the sites that take skins massively undervalue them. there's a reason i use that site. i dont play dota.
sanfrancisco,forsqel,t3_g96w1s,1588017853.0,At this rate I wouldn’t be surprised if this isn’t the last of the extensions :/
csgobetting,for0ie5,t1_fopcm7a,1588004057.0,5etop is ok with dota skins
college,foq08zs,t3_g8wemp,1587978259.0,Imo it depends what else you have. As you get older you generally want more RELEVANT job experience on there before stuff like major-unrelated clubs and positions. But if you don’t have professional experience and need things to fill up your resume by all means include your club position no matter what position you held
AskReddit,fonbzso,t3_g89hb4,1587916544.0,There’s always that one person
GlobalOffensive,fon643w,t1_fon58xb,1587913061.0,"Probably map pick, versus fnatic they played d2 and mirage which are less strat heavy than nuke and inferno so they got away with it"
UCI,folqpij,t3_g8669f,1587868242.0,Start learning python. There’s a bunch of resources online. You can look up old course sites for ICS-31 which is the intro course or try things like codecademy
justkiddingfilms,foj3hkn,t3_g6vbjx,1587806888.0,I think I’ve come to realize the majority of jk fans aren’t that smart. Sucks to say.
UCI,foizjkt,t3_g7olhy,1587802535.0,Pattis has been stellar as always. This is my third time taking one of his classes and in this case he really worked with the Mac users in his ics-7 class to find a solution for us to get the pc version of the excel software working.  I appreciate that the labs are fun and not just busy work. Ics-7 has been one of the bright spots of this whole online situation for me
GlobalOffensive,fogqhnz,t3_g7ejr0,1587755812.0,Kibaken -> tony black
UCI,fofy3xq,t3_g708o5,1587744840.0,This bums me out cuz I don’t feel like I’ve really maximized my time at UCI so far in my two years there and was really looking forward to turning that around in the fall with a new mindset since this is my last year. Damn.
sanfrancisco,fo7vux8,t1_fo7ve81,1587585428.0,Wouldn’t count on it happening
AskMen,fnd0lky,t3_g0uii1,1586854017.0,"It's just as physiological as it is mental. I remember not being able to sleep, and even when i was able to I'd wake up with a stomach ache and be unable to get out of bed. My whole day would be fixated around thinking about it and it just sucks. Whatever you're doing you can't get the thought of this person out of your head. Your mind is just racing 24/7 so the rest of your life is impacted and you turn to friends, drugs, or other vices to get your mind off things. Wouldn't wish it on anyone. But it's something most people go through unfortunately. It's good for character building."
UCI,fnc5guj,t3_g0vteh,1586829028.0,Haven’t come across that but it could be a case of your computer being overworked. Do you have a lot of stuff running at the same time? Check activity monitor; or install a external fan control application to help with cooling
UCI,fn2p6i0,t3_fyuf0t,1586597672.0,Hey I can see my window in the towers
college,fn2p29r,t3_fyyilc,1586597533.0,I’d probably say my ex girlfriend. Of course I can definitely contact her but I’m not going to since she’s with someone else now and I’d rather not know what she’s up to. I Imagine she’s doing well though.
GlobalOffensive,fmxu3nj,t3_fxwjzc,1586471894.0,Some pros used to do 1v1 awp/pistol/rifle matches for money or skins. iirc years ago pasha and Olof did stuff on stream for cash for fun
funny,fmr2pk7,t3_fwq7z6,1586312493.0,Does the excessive f bombing annoy anyone else too
UCI,fmohved,t3_fwh13o,1586259484.0,I’ve never felt so alone in my life. Don’t know how much longer I can deal with this tbh. Haven’t been able to sleep it just feels like never ending torture. I know it’s not the worst thing in the world but I’m going crazy cooped up in the house with no social interaction
AskMen,fmkji5v,t1_fmkj2c3,1586157094.0,I think deep down inside I’m afraid of initiating due to feelings of rejection when I did try to growing up. Any tips for overcoming that
