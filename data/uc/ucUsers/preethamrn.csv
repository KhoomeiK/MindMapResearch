PokemonSwordAndShield,fplqsby,t1_fpju3zq,1588717693.0,"Yeah. I'm thinking about it. I just need to figure out a good way to do it. Everything's already using git but I haven't pushed it to github yet.

The issue is that even if I made it open source, the biggest issue is adding the map/background image. Adding the new dens and Pokemon after that isn't that difficult. I could do it myself in a day and that's what I had planned. What I really need is someone who can do the art."
cscareerquestions,fp8huf0,t1_fp8fxig,1588392688.0,"You seem way too concerned with money. Money will come if you don't focus on it too much. If all you worry about is how to make a 500k+ salary, then you're probably never going to get there because your competition was focusing on becoming better programmers instead."
videos,fp4zeh0,t1_fp4qqjv,1588311557.0,A lot of YouTube drama is either pranks or personality attacks. This is more of trying to ruin someone's real life outside of YouTube because of something that happened on YouTube.
videos,fp4xro8,t1_fp4vdjk,1588310230.0,That sounds pretty funny. Why would someone ever upload something like that?
videos,fozwq1s,t1_foxr1nd,1588198222.0,Think about it this way. They're putting these names that can be found for free online in the record book. They're selling these record books for profit. The least they could do is try to reach out to the usernames.

Hackathons are nothing like that however so even if you have a good experience here, I'm not sure you'd enjoy a hackathon. The best reason to join is if you want to hang out with friends that you don't normally see, get a bunch of swag, and check out other cool projects. Competing isn't a fun experience."

ucla,fnxa3zo,t1_fnwppdm,1587334492.0,"I was going to type out a comment but you covered literally everything I wanted to say. I loved Corbin's classes because they rarely needed me to do calculations. I don't remember if we even brought calculators into the exam.

To add onto your last point, I think the best way to learn physics is by learning individual concepts really well. For example, if you learn about how to add up forces then you can now take a bunch of forces and apply them to an object and solve all kinds of problems.

To calculate how much something floats in a bucket, you could plug numbers into a single formula and memorize that, or you could memorize formulas for buoyant force and gravity. You have to remember more formulas but they will be applicable to many more situations like if the bucket was also spinning on a truck that's sliding down a slope with some friction.

Corbin's teaching style really nails that aspect of physics by giving us so many novel problems that it's impossible to just plug and chug numbers into a formula.

Side note: Anyone learning physics could check out hyperphysics. It does the same thing with teaching individual concepts really well but also connecting the dots between seemingly unrelated topics. It helped improve my mental model of physics a lot."

1. Freshman giving seniors interview prep advice.
2. Sophomores/Juniors giving advice about how to get an internship/full time job.
3. Seniors/New Grads explaining industry best practices as if they were working since Y2K.
4. Also everyone explaining how you should switch jobs at the first sight of adversity."

csMajors,fn8fscw,t1_fn8a2cl,1586740659.0,My comment was just a bit of banter. I was surprised you managed to write all that without using any punctuation. How was I supposed to know you were still using a Blackberry in 2020 which just happened to have a broken keyboard and no way to install a virtual keyboard?
csMajors,fn87srb,t1_fn819no,1586735734.0,It's hard to write object oriented code when you can't find the period key on your keyboard.
