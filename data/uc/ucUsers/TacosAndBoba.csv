Women are consistently assumed to be incompetent, even in their field of expertise, and have to work so much harder to prove that they are indeed capable, unlike their male counterparts that are automatically trusted."
berkeley,fopx4xx,t3_g8utt4,1587975110.0,Not really sure what kind of comparison you're looking for but the mechanical engineering department is a top ranked program and UCLAs is a lot lower. I'm sure they still both will offer great opportunities though.

The thing is women in stem are constantly belittled, overlooked, and presumed to be incompetent even when it's not necessarily intentional. Her complaining about this struggle is completely valid because sometimes it just gets too overwhelming to constantly feel like an outsider who is looked down upon. Her post doesn't hurt men in any way other than their ego. Whereas your post perpetuates the sexist biases that women have been trying so hard to overcome."

berkeley,foit2m8,t3_g7ndqr,1587796101.0,"My hot take: They are an excuse for people to join Greek life while pretending they are somehow going to help their career. When in reality they'll just end up wasting all their free time making gift baskets and trivia questions for the pledges and attending events they don't want to be at because it's required. All so they can be an active member and compete against their ""friends"" for meaningless officer positions so they can convince themselves that somehow makes them more accomplished. Better off making friends in a less toxic, less time consuming, and free environment like regular clubs and spending the rest of your time doing actually benefitial things like studying, research, and internships. 

I'm sure some people enjoy it, but everyone I've known was miserable and only stayed with it long enough so that they were allowed to put it on their resume until they eventually quit anyway."
berkeley,foikm2o,t3_g7k7hn,1587789031.0,"I wasn't working during my masters and I literally cannot imagine trying to do both.

berkeley,foh1fbx,t1_fogh8ld,1587759425.0,I can't imagine they'd care about what classes you choose to take outside of your major. They just wanna know you are capable in your field of research.

berkeley,fobpfxd,t1_fo9e248,1587662235.0,"Either way you're going to a top school and doing physics, it's going to be hard and it's going to be stressful. Unless you're really gonna pick somewhere that's not even comparable, then I doubt it's gonna make a huge difference. I don't mean to be harsh seems like time to just accept it? As someone that chose engineering I just accepted the fact that it was gonna be hard af and a lot of work, especially if I choose a top school. You still get to decide how much work you wanna put in depending on your goals and priorities.

Also it's not like people have done undergrad physics at both Berkeley and LA so it would be hard to really get a fair comparison that wouldn't be just speculation."
berkeley,foblru6,t1_fob2gvb,1587661122.0,"Yes generally at public schools you have to work harder they don't hold your hand and give you straight As. But I don't see how Berkeley and Dartmouth are even comparable for your situation. What you need to be concerned about is not just overall prestige but the quality of the program and department you're admitted to. The EECS department is literally top in the world often ranked #1 or at least top 3. They offer literally SO many resources. Whereas Dartmouth is ranked #56 in engineering and #43 for CS..... Rankings don't mean everything of course especially when comparing within the top 10, but Dartmouth isn't anywhere close so that's a no brainer to me.

As an engineer, I literally wouldn't consider going to a top ivy like Harvard or Yale because they're not good for engineering and that's what matters. Private schools definitely have more perks that's why it's so expensive and if you're out of state I'd definitely understand picking a private school over a public one... If it was more comparable for CS like Stanford, MIT, Cornell, Princeton, Caltech, etc. But that's just me so you do you."
berkeley,fo82qu2,t3_g642nz,1587588868.0,"I know a few people that chose schools only because it had the specific major they were super set on at the time, but they ended up changing majors to ones that they have at any school. They didn't like the school and ended up dropping to CC and transferring to a different school. So I think you should at least be sure you'd be happy at JH even if you ended up changing majors.

This would make me think it's better to go with the school you like better overall rather than just major but the problem is it's really hard to predict how you'll really feel about a school and if you'll be happy there. A lot of people have dream schools and they build up an idea of what it's like there and then the reality doesn't match up and they feel lost. So just because you feel like Berkeley is the place you wanna be, it's hard to really know."

berkeley,fnuvq8u,t1_fnqz3gf,1587272373.0,"I'm sure opinions vary but this is just mine.  I love the environment and general culture at Berkeley. There's a lot of very quirky characters and being different is a good thing. People seem much more open to show who they are, share opinions, and start discussion about tough topics. I just find that generally (obviously not always), people in Berkeley seem more down to earth and genuine than other places. Everyone is pretty hard-working and super passionate, but we still got that balance of being chill and having fun too. Overall, it's a big diverse school so you get to surround yourself with the type of people you like to be around.

Classes can be really hard and people will work really hard, but I don't think it's cutthroat. If you feel pressure, it's more because you're surrounded by so many talented and high-achieving people and you want to push yourself to succeed, but not because it's toxic or competitive. People are very willing to help each other out and work together and have a kind of ""we are all suffering together"" camaraderie. That's my experience anyway, I can imagine that there may be a few majors that feel more competitive like pre-med or business, but I can't speak on those so that's just speculation."
berkeley,fnn6m9v,t3_g2rvq7,1587085542.0,Seems normal. I'd personally avoid that Friday afternoon lab time slot if that's at all possible.
berkeley,fnmxdam,t1_fnmvccs,1587080010.0,"Yeah it took me a while to figure out as well. I'm not sure if you've done most of your required classes yet or not, but I'd focus on those, and consider which required classes you've enjoyed the most, and then take a related/more advanced class on that topic. 

This page on the ME website attempts to categorize all the classes that count as tech electives by topic:
https://me.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/technical-electives/"
berkeley,fnmsjmx,t1_fnmj63k,1587077336.0,"Oh I didn't realize they added a bunch of classes to count as QS. FINALLY! None of the controls classes used to count, so that's how I ended up in IEOR 165. It is definitely an easy A class and teaches you some useful topics like regularization, regression, maximum likelihood estimation, and hypothesis testing. But some of the other topics are less applicable. I wouldn't have even taken it with the current QS requirement, because I had already taken ME134.

I work in the space industry and the thing is, saying you want to work in defense/aerospace is extremely broad and there's a huge variety of jobs you can do. There are people doing controls or FEA, but also design, fluids, structural mechanics, manufacturing, testing, software, trajectory analysis, combustion, heat transfer, and the list goes on. Neither c180 nor 136 are super necessary to every aerospace job, you just have to figure out what type of work you want to do and take classes that will help you meet that goal. I don't see why you'd need 136 if you're not interested in controls, and if you are, then 134 is more essential imo. I am into dynamics and controls so I focused all my electives in either of those topics, or in some class that would give general supporting knowledge like probability, optimization, stats, signal processing, programming, etc. Do you know what field you might me interested in or what classes you've enjoyed or not enjoyed so far? That's what is going to determine what electives you choose."
berkeley,fngl0co,t3_g12izh,1586935630.0,"I would highly recommend taking 134 if you want to do controls.

Some other classes/topics to look into: probability, optimization, dynamics (me175), grad controls classes: me232, me233, me231ab, e231, me237, ee106a (personally thought it was a waste but you might enjoy more bc it's robotics).

Also, I've personally not found robotics companies to really hire controls people, they seem to just go for hardcore coders to do anything on the software side. But if you're more interested in academia then there's definitely tons of controls research in robotics.

Source: did 5th year master's focus on controls and am now controls engineer"
berkeley,fngj8tw,t3_fzoat6,1586933984.0,"From what I have heard c180 is much more focused on the math behind creating FEA tools rather than actually doing FEA analysis. So while it will give you a deeper understanding, it seems unnecessarily difficult and isn't actually as useful as you'd think. But of course I had no interest in FEA so could be interesting to someone else. Personally none of the QS requirement classes seemed interesting to me so I took IEOR 165 which is engineering statistics, which I'd say is mildly useful, but also the easiest engineering class I took so highly recommend lol (spring only tho. 

For design I took ME130 which was pretty easy but also kinda useless. Tho I think that's kinda true of all the design classes so just go with whatever spikes your fancy.

I haven't taken the other classes you mentioned, but I think it's important to decide what ME field you're interested in and what your goals are and take electives that will help you in that field. If you're interested in controls, I'd prioritize taking 134 over 136 if you haven't already taken that."
AskEngineers,fn504ac,t3_fzl4mt,1586652809.0,"1. UT Austin is literally ranked higher thank JH for engineering so idk why you'd act like it's not a good choice? It's already a great school and you'll be in a great spot for job hunting.

2. PEs are usually not required for EE or ME jobs. Some maybe but not the majority. At my school, no one ever even mentioned trying to get a PE. (I did ME)"
berkeley,fn3q4wo,t3_fyvs5n,1586625740.0,"1. You can definitely get close to your profs by going to office hours. This would be harder in intro general classes like math because a lot of people will go, but it's still enough to have the processor recognize you and know your name. But it's more important to know your ME profs anyway cuz they're the ones you'd want to know for research or grad school rec letters etc, and it's very easy all you have to do is go to office hours. Not every Prof is very helpful so sometimes it's better for the sake of the hw to go to gsi office hours, but it's certainly not hard to get an ME prof to know who you are.

2. ME has SO many internship and research opportunities. A lot of the career fairs are more eecs heavy because there's a lot of silicon valley companies, but there's also a whole ME career fair every year. An internship after freshman year is possible but not common or easy. Getting research will be much easier, and then maybe you can do an internship the following year. You can easily just email profs to ask about their research and meet up with them to see if you're interested in it and then ask if you can be in their lab. You may not get your first choice, but you can definitely get something, and then you can always change labs once you have more experience.

3. I feel like people are usually talking more about business clubs or pre-med or pre-law etc. Engineering clubs are not super competitive, they usually just want to make sure you actually are dedicated and won't just slack off. I believe some clubs like fsae only take a limited number of people because of this reason. But plenty of other engineering clubs, like CalSol solar car team will take anyone that wants to join. Of course not everyone will end up really participating a lot so it's still up to you to put in the work to stay involved.

I don't really know much about switching, but I can answer any other ME questions you have."
berkeley,fm6cqe8,t3_ftcsaa,1585791181.0,I don't think it's necessary. I had a lot of friends take 132 while they were in c85. I took 104 and 132 concurrently. Irl dynamics and controls go hand in hand but in 132 they pretty much just give you the dynamics so you don't have to solve that part yourself.
