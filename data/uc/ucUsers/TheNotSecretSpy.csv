It‚Äôs not ideal, but the flexibility of online classes has allowed me to explore multiple side projects in the area. And create a schedule for myself while doing 5 classes.

At the end of the day your experience will be what you make of it.  And anything you do throughout the crisis can be referenced to later as examples of dealing with hardship, and success in remote learning and self discipline."

UCSantaBarbara,fnfhhxw,t1_fnep5u5,1586908144.0,"Hi Everyone,

I hope you all had a good holiday weekend despite being at home and are getting into the groove of online learning. I'm definitely missing meeting all of you in person.  Thanks for the feedback you've given so far and feel free to sign up for office hours.

Here are some things to think about for this week:

1. WWI and the first paper I know some of you came to class late, but this week is an excellent time to wrap up any work from last week and dive into WWI.  Rather than ""test"" you on everything, my intention with the war and the first paper assignment on the war is for you all to get a taste of doing some research and following your own interests. I posted the paper assignment during week three on GS, and on the top of our GS page.  I also attached it here.  

We have a grad student in military history who is going to be available to you to help with your papers.  So we divided you guys into two groups...if your last name ends in A-L please email me with paper #1 questions.  If it ends in M-Z email Josh Rocha, who is just finishing a terrific dissertation on military spectacles (parades, etc...) in the first half of the twentieth century.  He also teaches military history so if that is of interest to you, feel free to email Josh.  HIs email is: joshua.rocha@bakersfieldcollege.edu.  

Next week, during this time, Tuesday the 21st at 9:30...I set up an optional zoom discussion meeting, in which we will start as a group to discuss any questions you have about WWI, the lectures, and your paper and then break up into groups to talk about reading and your paper research.  Each group will be led by one of our volunteer class facilitators...It should be fun, but is totally voluntary to attend.  I will though give each person 3 participation points for attending on Tuesday.  The link to join is posted during the week on Gauchospace.  I'll resend in an email next Monday.  I thought I was going to discuss the paper as part of lecture, but that got too long, so I just made the assignment very detailed and will answer other questions during this Zoom meeting and/or via forum posts or emails and office hours. 

Forum Posts: I have absolutely loved reading all your forum posts, which are making me feel connected to you all.  Of course, I can't answer all of your posts, but I am reading and will try to clear up problems in my responses to you guys or in further lectures. Please feel free to comment on others posts too...you get just as much credit for doing that as for posting, and also feel free to ask simple questions as well.  Nothing is too basic!  

Friday Night Movies.... I am also posting the movies as soon as I can for each week...feel free to watch anytime, write up a short ""review"" and upload to the spot on GS at the top of the page...If you have other ideas of movies or TV shows you would like to do, just check with me I'm open to any suggestions.

Thanks everyone!  I'm thinking of you all....

Best, 

Dr Rappaport"
