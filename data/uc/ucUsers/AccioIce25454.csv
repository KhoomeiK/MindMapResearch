nerdfighters,fpbvpef,t3_gcezhm,1588479960.0,I just noticed their diverging opinions on capitalizing video titles
AskReddit,fp8gx7l,t1_fp6zbd2,1588392006.0,"Unsure if I'm happy I finally got through the pack of awful, poorly-cut tp or terrified of having to find more again."
berkeley,fp85fyy,t1_fp7fm1s,1588383996.0,"I agree, I don't think it's fair to downvote you. Yes obviously we shouldn't cheat even know, but I feel like all these people congratulating this professor are people not worrying about rent/jobs/the literal lives of their loved ones. Come on, it's just a class. Can we try to be compassionate to people this semester?"
berkeley,fp857bo,t1_fp783nr,1588383815.0,"A good professor will make you feel prepared for the exam if you've put in the work, but I've definitely had classes where I felt like I didn't even know where the problems were coming from. I think it makes a difference for students considering cheating."
UpliftingNews,foux6ng,t1_fouqbzr,1588091864.0,How is the infection rate in the Bay Area part of whether or not California has a lockdown?
UpliftingNews,fouq0v2,t1_foup3xh,1588088489.0,"Unfortunately it's not enough to close down one city when you have ""yeah we can do whatever we want"" a car ride away.  But good job on changing the subject to deflect any criticism for talking about things you don't know anything about."
UpliftingNews,fouoy4t,t1_fouo6e8,1588087970.0,"Then maybe you should say LA, you're just like people who lump all of the states together when talking about the US. I'm in the Bay Area and we're taking it very seriously."
UpliftingNews,fouo2lq,t1_fot7z2o,1588087532.0,That's just not true. We're sheltering in place and you're only supposed to go out for necessary things. In my town it's currently illegal to go out without a mask.
AskReddit,fot1d4h,t1_forse9l,1588042477.0,Especially when I'm on a bike :( I realize people are trying to be nice but I have a stop sign and I just stopped. Now I'm trying to start again quickly and I'm not balanced. Just go please.
Cooking,foos8nl,t1_foo8c4c,1587945368.0,"I didn't know about acid and sugar, thank you!"
Cooking,foos41f,t1_foo6u3s,1587945289.0,Ahh coconut milk sounds like a really good choice. I don't think we have any at home right now but more noodles sounds like it would definitely help. Thank you!
Cooking,fooryvf,t1_foo7u7q,1587945203.0,"Thank you, that sounds delicious!"
Cooking,foorw7p,t1_foo8gde,1587945160.0,One dish!
berkeley,fo5raqi,t3_g5usj3,1587533262.0,"It seems like you have a lot of questions and I think you should talk to a Berkeley counselor to ensure you have all the facts you need. I do know that generally you need at least 6 units in the summer to qualify for financial aid, otherwise you pay per semester, not per class."
berkeley,fo5qxg2,t1_fo4wh9x,1587532953.0,"You'll have so many things to explore on campus here! But I really loved the BCC campus too, I just wish the classrooms had windows for some natural light."
berkeley,fo4u6ru,t1_fo3d8qd,1587511285.0,"Nice, I'm a last year transfer doing applied math! Lmk if you have any questions"
berkeley,fo4tymd,t1_fo3yyx4,1587511156.0,Hi! I technically transferred from BCC last year but I took a bunch of my classes at Laney!
TwoXChromosomes,fn85gpv,t3_fzyih1,1586734308.0,"I don't even think it needs to be said that there are plenty of dads out there that are worse for the kids than it would be to be raised by a single mom (and vice versa). OP, you've accomplished something many people never do, being satisfied with yourself and your life without needing someone else. It sounds like you're doing great!"
Fitness,fmtj2vx,t1_fmt7t03,1586373584.0,Thank you!
Fitness,fmt704w,t1_fms8khp,1586367873.0,"I'm sick rn, probably the plague but I'm young and lucky so no actual symptoms except for aches and extreme fatigue. Can't do anything beside yoga this week, big sigh. Hopefully next week will be better, congrats for beating it!"
lgbt,fmt4tcj,t3_fx6b1l,1586366876.0,"I'm so sorry. Recently I read this book I loved and the author was writing about her mother's death from when she was young and said it helped her to hear that ""it will never be okay that her mother died"". This really helped me deal with my dad's death so maybe it's good for you to hear it too. It'll never be okay that your fiancee died. But you will keep going and I know your fiancee would be proud of you for it."

berkeley,fmppt1u,t3_fwoywx,1586285147.0,"At first I wasn't sure but since L&S asked in their email that we leave everything on p/np if we can, I feel like I can actually learn again instead of stressing out all the time about homework and quizzes. I'm also sick this week (therefore in quarantine even though I don't have the major covid symptoms) and I would be so stressed out about the work I'm missing without p/np."
crochet,flygarf,t1_flxzckm,1585601616.0,"Afaik Antarctica, unlike the Arctic, actually has land underneath it. So when the ice melts it will still be there. Just greener."
