Haha yeah I guess it depends on the professor, but in some podcasts it’s hard to see the board/what they’re writing."
UCSD,foysol4,t3_gaamc9,1588178450.0,"This article makes it sound like school will mostly be back to normal in the fall, besides the fact that there are no triple rooms and completely online classes are a possibility for international students. Is that the message you guys got? 

I wonder if “online classes” means podcasts or zoom, because for me there’s a big difference."
UCSD,fnv6qdn,t3_g42lnc,1587282146.0,"Is it possible to take just one quarter off? I haven’t looked into it but it might be a good option if fall quarter is still online. 

I just kinda assumed UCSD doesn’t want you to do that because they want everyone to graduate in 4 years and all that."
