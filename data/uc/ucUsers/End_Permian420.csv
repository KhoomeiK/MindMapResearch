ucla,fo7o6p8,t1_fny1pc0,1587581679.0,"The environmental science department at UCLA is not the same as an Earth and Environmental science major at most schools. It's a sponge to absorb the students who are influenced by the mainstream to save the world or some sh\*t. The real science curriculum for earth and envi sci is in the EPS SCI department and/or the Atmospheric and Oceanic Science department. Basically, majoring in EPS or AOS can land you any environmental job with a BS, and you can continue to study w a masters or phd to get other Earth science or AOS jobs. With envi sci, you are trapped in the environment industry (the worst paying earth science industry that requires the least education).

&#x200B;

However, there's no way you can double major in econ and a physical science major unless you/re a savant. Might be possible with an ioes major or minor because it's simply easier."

ucla,fo79p06,t3_g5ymvx,1587574639.0,The EPSSCI department is the golden ticket. It's fun and the jobs pay well. More lowkey so easy to do research and the profs are very nice. Ex premed here.

martincabello,fmxaj7c,t1_fmxag03,1586461441.0,he’s not really trying to convince anyone of anything. He’s just documenting his thoughts on a digital platform.
martincabello,fmxa8xe,t3_fxyr70,1586461294.0,It’s cryptographic. It’s analogies. Using these words and symbols so that the general audience member can understand what he’s trying to say without him explaining the literal phenomena with real scientific jargon.
