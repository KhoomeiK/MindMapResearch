UCI,fohvm5g,t1_fohupvs,1587773506.0,"The thing is, the verification/documentation forms are for the next school year's financial aid.  
I recall the purpose for the CARES Act is to be used for students right now who qualified already for FAFSA in this school year. Unless they're trying to spread it to the incoming freshman students and not the graduating students?

Also, I heard that some students from other schools have already received their aid. 

  
The calculation on who gets what shouldn't be that difficult for us to wait till June then, right?"
