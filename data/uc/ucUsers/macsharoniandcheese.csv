So.
This isn't based on MY experience of Judaism, it's based on Torah and talmud.
Y h v h are literally not pronounced, not by choice, but because that's not how the language works. Yhvh is SPECIFICALLY chosen because there's NO pronunciation.

The punishment for those who ""try to pronounce"" this is a conceptual one, related to intent! 

Also my man I really need your christian self to stop trying to explain to me what my religion says.

Ignoring all of that, I'm a linguist. I heavily focused on this area of study. I'm a fluent Hebrew speaker, have read the Torah in it's original language and i'm answering your question.

 There is no pronunciation. Not in modern Hebrew, not in biblical Hebrew, not in arameic, not in phoenecian."

Judaism is RIFE with examples of going above and beyond in safeguarding and preventing breaking of laws.

But also keep arguing about it with a Jew. Sure. I'm gonna peace out."
etymology,fph69sk,t1_fph62rr,1588615708.0,"That's exactly what I was saying. When reading, you say Adonai, hashem, whatever when you see the letters yhvh, which holds the place of the /actual/ name whatever that may be."
etymology,fph5k8e,t1_fph4kn1,1588615351.0,"It's generally agreed upon in Judaism that yhvh is a placeholder, and that the name of god is something else entirely (as told by a witness to a Yom Kippur ceremony in the temple).

The point was that the cohenim (high priests) would pass the ""actual"" name to their sons, the next to be a high priest. Because there's no temple and no high priests, whatever that word was, is lost completely. Again, yhvh serving as a place holder."
etymology,fph410x,t1_fph3v9f,1588614579.0,There's literally not a pronunciation. The spelling was chosen specifically because there's no pronunciation.
etymology,fpgzd4k,t1_fpgwtu7,1588612220.0,"Not to mention, the 3 letters represented (in phoenecian and hebrew) are silent/place holders for vowels. The reason it's spelled this way is because in Hebrew you physically can't pronounce this - that's the point.

I should rephrase in terms of ""prohibited"" it's prohibited to attempt to quantify these letters in a pronounceable way. These letters are purposefully placed here to be unpronounceable"

Antisemitism in the Soviet Union commenced openly as a campaign against the ""rootless cosmopolitan""(a supposed euphemism for ""Jew""). In his speech titled ""On Several Reasons for the Lag in Soviet Dramaturgy"" at a plenary session of the board of the Soviet Writers' Union in December 1948, Alexander Fadeyev equated the cosmopolitans with the Jews. In this campaign against the ""rootless cosmopolitan"", many leading Jewish writers and artists were killed.Terms like ""rootless cosmopolitans"", ""bourgeois cosmopolitans"", and ""individuals devoid of nation or tribe"" (all of which were codewords for Jews) appeared in newspapers. The Soviet press accused the Jews of ""groveling before the West"", helping ""American imperialism"", ""slavish imitation of bourgeois culture"" and ""bourgeois aestheticism"". Victimization of Jews in the USSR at the hands of the Nazis was denied, Jewish scholars were removed from the sciences, and emigration rights were denied to Jews. The Stalinist antisemitic campaign ultimately culminated in the Doctors' plot in 1953. According to Patai and Patai, the Doctors' plot was ""clearly aimed at the total liquidation of Jewish cultural life"".Communist antisemitism under Stalin shared a common characteristic with Nazi and fascist antisemitism in its belief in ""Jewish world conspiracy""."

I was told by Dr after Dr that periods just hurt the way I hurt and to just get used to it. After literally 10 years someone actually LOOKED at the fucking blood tests and diagnosed my with PCOS within 30 seconds, asking how I didn't know.

migraine,fmxdlrf,t3_fxxusx,1586463011.0,"Very important to establish consistency in her life.
Her sleep schedule is important, and sleep hygiene is EXTRA important. No phones an hour before bed, going to bed at a normal hour, not eating within an hour of bedtime etc. She should basically never have a phone or computer in bed, preferably an hour without screens before bed. Best even out of her room. It seems extreme but it's easier to create this before she has the opportunity to use computers/phone/whatever in bed. Establishing this was hard fore, but helped a lot. (Honestly everyone should do this).

Sleep may or may not be a trigger, but in middle school (and more importantly high school) sleeping correctly is VITAL. 

Something I didn't do out of stubbornness and ego in high school was asking for accomodations (I viewed it like I was broken or not good enough if I needed them. this is BAD don't let her ever feel like that). Need a slightly darker room for exams? Sunglasses in class? Fragrance free room? Whatever. Fight for it. School is hard enough.

Believe when she says she's in pain - based on myself and other sufferers I know, this will RARELY be abused.

Someone else mentioned keeping a lookout for depression and anxiety (they often cause each other in a big ol circle).

Track triggers - look up all of the common ones and check them out. There's tons of different food triggers. Stress, too much or little sleep, dehydration, etc. Honestly, she needs to keep generally healthy
 Exercise and eating healthy is important.

None of this means she shouldn't have pizza or cake or whatever once in a while (like a normal kid). But once triggers are figured out, it's important to show that her choices effect her. (Eg let's say chocolate trigger - teach her to understand that she has a choice. Eat the chocolate knowing it might give her a migraine, or skip out on the chocolate).

Honestly, I have so so much to say about this, esp. as a recent college grad who's had to deal with this since about 9. School and pain are in my recent memory.

Reaching out to drs and even subs like this shows you're on the right track. You care to figure it out with her. Support is important
