BitcoinBeginners,foyu9rg,t3_gacnci,1588179285.0,">How does the ""system"" know where to deposit earned fees for a particular miner? 

Typically a bitcoin transaction involves inputs and outputs, inputs being previously ""unspent"" transactions that send coin to a person and outputs being where that coin goes.

The first transaction in a bitcoin block is given the right to not have any inputs, instead it is automatically credited the sum of the fees and the bitcoin block reward. The miner crafts this transaction to send fees and minted bitcoin (typically to themselves) however they want, but the amount spent in that transaction must be no greater than the sum of the fees of all transactions in that block + the block reward. This transaction is commonly called the coinbase (hence where the name of the company comes from).


>how does this work with pool mining?

Typically in a pool, all the bitcoin earned is sent to the pool manager, who will later distribute it. This system is somewhat based on trust but it ends up being easier this way, and if a pool manager tries to abuse their position that will cost them the entire pool, everyone will move to another pool.

A miner trying to mine in a pool cannot replace the coinbase with a transaction sending coin to themselves, a pool verifies the progress of miners by having each miner send them blocks they have tried to mine that don't quite fit the proof of work criteria needed by Bitcoin, but still represent work. If the block does not contain the coinbase sending the coin to the pool, it is not counted for the purposes of the pool.

It is possible to have the coinbase actually send coin to all the miners in the pool if mined, but this itself tends to eat up precious blockspace that would go to other fee paying transactions so its just easier to distribute afterwards."

Note timings are expressed in clock cycles. Faster ram often has higher numbers for those latency numbers and that does not mean it is worse since we care about absolute access time. Absolute times can be calculated by dividing by clock speed/2 (divides by 2 because DDR ram is advertised at twice it’s actual clock rate).

First number is the amount of time spend finding a particular column once you found the row, known as CAS latency.

Second number is the amount of time spent finding a row if you haven’t loaded any row yet.

Third number is the amount of time that is needed to “save” a row before you start loading other ones.

Fourth is the fastest you can open then close a row.

BitcoinBeginners,for8zbj,t3_g94s1y,1588008206.0,">the signature of course can not be tampered with


You would think but this isn’t true.

As it turns out if you have a valid ECDSA signature for some kind of data, you can create another valid signature for that data without knowing the private key. This typically isn’t a problem of course because at the end of the day the data is either signed or not, exploiting this requires a valid signature in the first place, but if you need your signature to not change for other purposes you run into issues. And this is how transaction malleability happens.

The second issue lies in the fact that scriptsig doesn't have its size limited and isn't signed. Inputs are used by attaching to the input a string of data (scriptsig) that satisfies the transaction script, the criteria to redeem coin, including the signatures needed. As long as the first part of the data in the scriptsig satisfies the transaction script, the rest is ignored (this is done because extensions of bitcoin may use this space). This is a space for malleability since all the scriptsigs are removed before signing the data (since scriptsig contains the signatures being made here), so if you append some random but valid garbage to the end of scriptsig, you change the transaction hash. Or it could be that modifying the data already present doesn't invalidate the scriptsig, its rare in practice but can happen.

>why is transaction malleability bad?

So transaction malleability essentially says you can’t guarantee that the hash of a transaction you send out will be the same by the time it hits the blockchain. When it hits the blockchain, the hash is of course fixed. Inputs are located using transaction hashes, if the transaction hash of an input changes you will need to craft a new transaction. Typically this isn’t a problem but there are applications where you need the transaction hash before it hits the blockchain, such as lightning, which works on a complicated scheme of incentives involving transactions that can be redeemed (published to the blockchain) but aren't. So we end up with issues."

[Survival probabilities of employers where unions barely won the election (e.g. by one

[Union workers make significantly more than non-union workers. - BLS](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2013/04/art2full.pdf)

Our economy is all about competitive pressure, typically this is competitive pressure from consumers or other businesses. The average worker typically has little in their toolbox to compete with businesses, hence why unions exist as the only real tool unskilled workers have, creating a competitive pressure on the business on behalf of the workers. It also is not in the union's interest to have a failing business and they understand that, they are not unreasonable. It is against the union's interests to create an unsustainable business. 

>community is the safety net

This also has problems. Don't get me wrong, community as a safety net isn't a bad thing, in fact its probably the one big thing I envy about small towns. Community will feed the hungry man fish if he stumbles on hard times. This is good. But community will have to keep feeding the hungry man fish because teaching the man to fish is a pretty high upfront cost which does eventually pay off for the community but its initial cost is too daunting that no one is going to do it. Education is the great leveler in our society and community isn't going to fund the colleges or trade schools needed to pull people out of poverty. In the end, feeding fish over a lifetime will cost more than the initial upfront cost of a good education."
GetMotivated,foa941r,t1_fo9snhy,1587642399.0,"> In most European countries this sort of education is free or heavily subsidised, it would never enter our minds to take a job for basic necessities of life like education and healthcare.

I don't know why people don't think its not like this in the US. There are thousands of community colleges all across the US that operate for either very cheap or free, state schools also end up being quite cheap or free depending on income, and even privates are generally not too bad when you realize posted tuition is designed to be a maximum to be subtracted from based on need, only upper class pays the full sticker price (Harvard’s tuition comes down to free if your parents make less than 200k for instance). There is a very good chance OP's guy would have gotten a near full ride without his father's help and even if not there is no reason you need to take much of your undergrad in an expensive 4 year university like Rutgers. 

People in the US complain about the price of expensive colleges yet for some reason are unwilling to go for cheap public options despite really offering the same education in both places. Its only skewed because **the US offers more choice**, the difference is that Europe's education culture largely only offers cheaper public options **that are not uncommon in the United States**, options where expensive research professors aren't the one's teaching introductory level classes like they are in the expensive US colleges, options where money isn't funneled into expensive football teams, research facilities are a separate system from the university system, etc. These kinds of colleges exist in the US, there is just an idiotic culture of them being ""bad colleges"" because expensive colleges have more brand name because American culture. Foreigners of course don’t understand this because all they hear about are the other universities. 

Universities that are actually more akin to US unis in Europe in their culture or structure end up costing roughly the same. Britain’s top public universities, Oxford and Cambridge, have tuition is roughly the same as any top American public university. Rutgers tuition before deduction? Cheaper than these.

The US gives you the choice to bankrupt yourself if you choose. But it’s far cry from any kind of obligation to do so."

Other things... less so. 

It’s only started to become a phenomenon in recent years to add additional processing to games that distinguish how the ear gets sound from other places like the front or back.

The specific thing that needs to be implemented is known as a [head related transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function). It’s not a difficult thing to implement, it involves doing a thing called Fourier processing which is common for a variety of reasons. Games like CS GO have it and the new unity engine might I believe. But I’m not fully certain. There are definitely games that do it though.

Valve spent a lot of time to upgrade their audio engine in CS GO. I can’t say I know if anyone has done any better than them.

explainlikeimfive,fo89iap,t3_g69ijc,1587592346.0,"Left and right sound location is not just volume FYI, it is also timing. Sound coming from the right has to travel a bit further than sound from the left, the brain understands this and is able to calculate direction as a result even if volume is the same.

Well your head ultimately has 2 listening devices, even those 5.1 stereo sounds won’t fix that limitation.

This is the kind of limitation your ear exists to fix.

The ears are most likely shaped the way they are to differentiate sound direction that is not left and right. Sound coming from the front or back will sound slightly differently due to the different bones/parts of the ear the sound has to hit to get into your ear. If we can make a sound engine in games to create this kind of sound processing artificially, then we can trick the brain into thinking sound is coming from the front of behind.


The best way to hear sounds coming from the front and back is still just to hear them from the side instead. Our left and right awareness is still a lot better than front or back, up and down is actually the worst of all (just because it’s not that important in the wild). But if we tilt or twist our heads, we can convert a front to back sound into a left and right sound, being able to get more information.

Of course you don’t physically tilt your head when playing a game. But your character model does.

There is also a lot of other deductive reasoning going on. If you hear footsteps sound muffled as in someone is stepping on the thing that is muffling them, you know they are probably above you. It sounds different. If you know the enemy is in front of you and not behind you, your intuition will assume they are in front when you hear sounds coming from the front of back."

explainlikeimfive,fo821b9,t3_g68chb,1587588507.0,"The people who produce that commodity are the initial sellers of futures. That one future then can be passed along to others by selling it.

Futures are largely something that exists to solve a 1900s problem. Farmers grow crops to sell on the market, they have to choose a crop then wait months before they can harvest it to sell on the market. What would happen is that say corn at the time was in high demand and as a result corn prices were really high. A farmer would see this and start growing corn, only to find out that prices crashed months later and the farmer actually ended up losing money.

Farmers were willing to pay a little less for their crops than current market prices to lock in a price months in advance once their crops would be grown. And Wall Street was willing to take on the risk for them. Thus futures were born.

Futures as a whole ended up having a stabilizing effect on the market, they were able to moderate commodity prices in most cases, with a few certain exceptions. But for crops for instance they have kept prices relatively stable compared to crops that don’t have futures, like onions because congress banned onion futures in 1958."

This is a common thing in war torn regions to happen. But even without the war, lost documents are really annoying to recover. 

If you want to do anything significant in life, you generally need to be able to prove your identity. In the example above, say you try to flee from your war as a refugee. You make it to the border of country Y, who is accepting refugees from X. They ask for your papers. You have none. But even in places without war, you try to do something like open a bank account in your name, apply for a job, etc, they are going to ask for proof that you are who you are and reject you if you have nothing. 

Instead of physically issuing these papers, there is no real reason they can't be issued digitally.
