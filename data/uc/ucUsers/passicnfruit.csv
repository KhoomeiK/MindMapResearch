Good luck with A&L and history though, oof."

relationship_advice,fo1nkn1,t3_g4ws1j,1587437229.0,"I think you’ve gotten enough feedback on the “dad kicking him out” side of this. If I may, I’d like to speak a little bit about your son’s position, with a brief personal anecdote.

I did really well throughout my public school education, and landed myself in one of the best universities in the world. I’ve done relatively well, and my parents have always thought of me as being a hard worker who can do anything I set my mind to.

The thing is, I have no dreams. I hate academia, and don’t want anything to do with it anymore. I’ll be graduating in less than a month with no hope of employment (not just bc of the pandemic, but bc I’m admittedly extremely underamibitious and weak-willed, though my parents don’t believe it, no matter how many times I tell them), having no job secured a year in advance, or a med/law/grad school admission, or anything like that, which many of my peers have. Seeing that I’ve wasted so much time, so much of my (aged) parents’ money (tens of thousands down the drain), a spot that some one more deserving could’ve had, I dread getting out of bed every day, and I can’t get anything done (which is self-reinforcing).

I wish I would’ve taken a year or two between high school and uni to figure out, even just a little bit more, who I was. I wish I would’ve maybe tried a semester or two of trade school, gotten an apprenticeship (not like I would’ve been ambitious enough to even try...), went to community college, something. Then I could at least say that I tried. But now I’m consumed with guilt and shame, and have virtually every day thought about ending it (but then my parents will really never get anything out of me). I really hate this blank me, and, though of course I don’t know your son at all, to force him out when he’s trying to make a good decision for himself (that I wish I’d made) and _needs your support_ to do it, man, that seems cruel.

So what if it’s (the “fly b*tch” mentality) made a few other people successful? Starting from the bottom and working their way up to the top? Those are just the success stories, and the ones you don’t hear are the ones that end poorly, in suicide or homelessness or continual poverty, +hating their parents for life. Let your son feel things out."

AskReddit,fny8hf1,t3_g4gayh,1587356035.0,"When asking this question, I have in mind things that, even when you're in the process of doing it, you know that they're wrong, but you make the conscious decision to do it anyway; for instance:

* throwing stuff out your car window
* racist/homophobic/etc stuff (assuming you know/have the intuition that it's wrong)
* mutilate live animals
* stealing packages
* pushing others
* cheating on a partner, particularly one that you still care about (so not a sh\*thead you just haven't dumped yet or sth)
* hurting someone else when it doesn't benefit you at all (except for maybe the laugh/entertainment)

So not even anything extreme, but just ... the things you think ""I shouldn't do this"" but you do anyway.

Been Sad lately and seeing a lot of news of people doing obviously horrible things (especially to innocents; I don't really care if someone trying to steal your bike gets smacked) has really exacerbated things. I don't really get it. :c"
TooAfraidToAsk,fny80cr,t1_fnxe7e5,1587355691.0,"Hm, can't say that I did? The main change that I noticed was the scent (sdfadsfdsf kinda tmi sorry haha) (/texture, but that's to be expected re: fertility), but mm, yeah, I don't think it there were any visual changes to the blood."
AskReddit,fny7nr7,t1_fns1u3z,1587355437.0,"oh oof, this one hurts... I had such a childhood where anything I found myself to bad at I quit immediately out of humiliation that there were people better than me (and the only thing I was good at was studying), and now I'm not good at anything at all and have crippling fear of failure that prevents me from even trying anything new ... :' really hate it"
EatCheapAndHealthy,fny6t1j,t3_g4jkmg,1587354828.0,"Maybe I'm just not a rice connoisseur or something (/I have really low standards) but rice cooked in a pot vs a rice cooker is really not that different? (Coming from a East Asian American household here, for context.) As a kid, we had a rice cooker, but also made it in the pot half the time, and I could not tell you the difference.

When I got to college and I cooked my rice in a pot, tho, all my Asian American friends were hella ??? ""we have a rice cooker, just use that"" but I don't think it makes better rice/is that much more convenient. The only reason I could see getting one is to mayyybe have one of those with a timer, so you have have hot rice ready as soon as you step in the door after work/class.

Granted, it sounds like your alternative is Minute rice, which I'm not familiar with... I've always just gotten 50lb bags that last a while."
AskReddit,fnxb294,t1_fnx9aq0,1587335036.0,"I’m thinking the kind of thing that you _know_ is wrong, but you make the conscious decision to do it anyway. Pushing another person out of the way, stealing (particularly from, say, a mom n pop shop sort of deal, small business where the owner feels it), littering, telling others to kill themselves, things that you know hurt others, and maybe don’t even benefit you at all."

TooAfraidToAsk,fnwzfxc,t1_fnwwrd9,1587328485.0,"I also used to get excruciating cramps (like red hot fire in my tummy or someone pressing their thumbs into an open wound) but I heard that the IUD/nexplanon can stop periods (technically, the pill too if you use it differently bc fsr manufacturers think people want to ? have periods ?), and I got mine last October (I don’t like sex so I got it solely for the period-stopping potential, so if it didn’t work, it’d be useless), and have had light bleeding now and then, but haven’t had a period this year. It’s been great and somewhat life-changing, to be honest. I believe it was 100% covered by my insurance, as well, if finances could be an issue for someone like this.
I don’t wanna like, say “you have to get it!!!” but really, it’s been a life changer and I just want to put it out there as an option.
edit: though ahem the insertion was potentially the worst pain in my life, but I took the medication wrong LOL so this is not a universal exp"
