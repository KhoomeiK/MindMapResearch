I think it sets a bad precedent. What was the U.N designed to do if not make decisions in these matters? It’s virtually worthless at that point.

I’m glad that the bombing occurred. The displacement that took place was nothing short of a war crime. It’s just questionable as to whether or not NATO should be able to ignore U.N. rules if NATO members are going to be members of the U.N.

Altogether, some ninety to 150 civilians died from cluster bomb use. The first confirmed incident was on April 10 (incident no. 14) and the last was on May 13 (incident no. 57).

The most serious incident involving civilian deaths and the use of cluster bombs occurred on May 7 in Nis (incident no. 48). The mid-day attack on Nis airfield, which is located inside the urban zone, killed fourteen civilians and injured twenty-eight. Cluster bomb submunitions fell in three widely separated areas: near the Pathology building of the Nis Medical Center in southeast Nis; in the town center near the Nis University Rector's Office, including the area of the central city market place, the bus station near the Nis Fortress, and the ""12 February"" Health Center; and near a car dealership and the ""Nis Express"" parking lot across the river from the fortress.

Who worked the fields before undocumented workers did? It was American citizens. But the reason why farm owners are major advocates for that increased labor coming from Latin America is because over time, people stopped doing those jobs. If you were to remove those laborers, there would be a shortage of labor in the agricultural sector of the economy. 

https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor/#employment

Sure, in the 50’s, there were more Americans working on farms. But there were also quadruple the number of jobs in agriculture than there are today. There’s a labor shortage for agriculture and immigrant labor fills in that gap for an industry that’s been declining decade over decade for a century.

I’m not lying. I never justified stealing SSN’s. I said that you can remove the incentive to steal SSN’s by giving undocumented laborers the right to work in the United States. I’m extremely against people stealing SSN’s, so I’m advocating a policy position that would reduce SS fraud. I want there to be less people having their identities stolen. Clearly and unequivocally.

I’m not jumbling any words around, and I’m not pulling out sources to hold on to my worldview. My worldview is based on empirical data and not just justifying my hunches to myself. 

I’ve provided you with ample data to justify my position without relying on hunches or on “liberal media.”

You falsely believed that DACA recipients and undocumented workers as a whole did not pay federal taxes was and based it on “why would you pay taxes in Japan if you illegally moved there?” After demonstrating why illegal immigrants would actually pay taxes, you conceded the point. The same reason why you were misinformed about that is the same reason why you’re wrong about immigrant labor. You don’t know any of the factual information (or refuse to believe it), and simple assume that what you think is “rational” is automatically true."
ucr,fpauxwh,t1_fpasetm,1588456233.0,"You’re making things up. People stealing SSN’s is a major issue. I never said that it was okay. It’s wrong. The best solution however is to provide those individuals with the ability to work here in the United States legally. Instead of spending a ton of money to prevent those workers who, as I’ve demonstrated earlier, have demonstrable value both in terms of overall GDP and tax revenue collected, you can save money and increase tax revenue by giving them work visas (which are rather difficult to get). I’d prefer citizenship, but I don’t think it would be possible to get bipartisan support for that initiative.

So I’ve provided government data and right leaning think tank data to demonstrate that what you’re saying is incorrect. This isn’t just “left wing lunacy.”

ucr,fp9sncq,t1_fp90e9p,1588433721.0,"It’s not some undocumented folk, the estimated number is 50-75 percent. The IRS estimates it at 6 million. The numbers are rough, but it’s hard to get perfect estimates because of the population we’re trying to measure this data from.

And if you gave all of the undocumented immigrants that were here work visas (of just granted them citizenship) then they would all have Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers. So they could all pay taxes or be convicted of tax fraud if they dodged taxes. The process currently to get a work visa is incredibly difficult. If you’re just worried about them evading taxes, why not just give them work visas or citizenship? They won’t have to steal or fabricate SSN’s. And DACA recipients don’t have to use fraudulent SSN’s because we literally give them the right to work. While I’m not sure what percentage of DACA recipients are included in that number, if they were boosting the number of immigrants that pay taxes, that’s just more evidence that we should be granting them the right to work.

And I’m not referring to the format of the article per se, I’m referring to the source that it’s from. Opinion pieces have no burden to be true because the opinions expressed are solely the opinion of the original author. Whereas congressional budget office reports have an obligation to report accurate information. Additionally, the CBO report is very well sourced, and even concedes that some studies in some states found that there is an economic burden, though the overwhelming majority found that in the long term, undocumented immigrants contribute more than they take from the system. Therefore, there’s no economic burden created by undocumented immigrants.

Is there another reason why you don’t want undocumented workers in the United States other than the perceived economic burden?"
ucr,fp8yvvc,t1_fp8ycxr,1588407917.0,"That is absolutely incorrect. Did you not read the above? The CBO and IRS both have corroborated that many undocumented workers are paying taxes as a result of using a fraudulent SSN to obtain a job.

And the burden you’re talking about is also false.

My second reply to you actually quoted the CBO article that stated that in the long run, undocumented and documented immigrants contribute more to the government than they take. Feel free to refer to my previous comment or read the CBO report.

Why believe an opinion piece from The Hill and not straight from the mouths of the IRS and the CBO?

And if you’re worried about them dodging taxes, why not give undocumented workers work visas and ensure that 100 percent of them are paying taxes?"
ucr,fp8xxw1,t1_fp8x862,1588406919.0,"I did answer your question. I said that 50 percent of all illegal immigrants pay Social Security taxes.

From the CBO article linked above:

“The extent to which this population pays taxes is also an important determinant of the fiscal impact of unauthorized immi- grants. Data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) suggest that some unauthorized immigrants use false or fraudulently obtained Social Security numbers (SSNs) to satisfy paperwork requirements during the hiring process and that employers use those numbers to withhold federal, state, and local income and payroll taxes for employees. Workers who do not qualify for SSNs can use Individual Tax Identification Numbers issued by the IRS to file tax returns, make payments, and apply for refunds. Although there are no reliable data on unauthorized immigrants’ rate of compliance with tax laws, the IRS estimates that about 6 million unauthorized immigrants file individual tax returns.

Other researchers estimate that between 50 percent and 75 percent of unauthorized income tax returns.”

So undocumented immigrants use fake SSN’s or Individual Tax Identification Numbers to pay federal and state taxes. And conservatively, it’s about half of all undocumented immigrants. Which would probably be higher if those immigrants were granted citizenship or given a work visa. That would also eliminate the need for undocumented immigrants to create fraudulent SSN’s. It makes perfect sense that someone who wants to be hired in the United States would have a SSN so those who come here illegally get fake SSN’s and must pay taxes that way. So if you’re deeply concerned about tax revenue, the best way to ensure that undocumented immigrants are paying their fair share is to give them the right to work here.

Anything else?"

Now you’re trying to refute literal data from the Congressional Budget Office by telling me to use “logic.” You’re making so many illogical assumptions based on nothing but your preconceived notion of what undocumented immigrant laborers actually do. 

So either the Congressional Budget Office is lying or you should change your opinion to match the present evidence. Facts do NOT care about your feelings. You’re not using logic. You just FEEL like if someone were to illegally immigrate to a country that they wouldn’t pay taxes when the article I linked you showed that half of all undocumented workers pay social security tax (as a part of FICA taxes).
