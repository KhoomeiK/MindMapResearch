However, I P/NPed _ because spending time on _ already made my mental health deteriorate” or something like that. Plus it’s one semester, will not have a big impact compared to the other 7 semesters"

However, note that greek life and related parties are currently going on a downward trend with all of the sexual assault cases and increasing hostility from campus/locals."
berkeley,fnj6goe,t1_fnj4h6v,1586992869.0,Are you talking about Ryan’s termination? I thought that didn’t count because he didn’t actually hack Ryan’s email but just spoofed it.
berkeley,fni9drd,t3_g1l49t,1586976195.0,I heard that 5th Years MS was much harder this sem. in that now 3.7+ GPA and a faculty sponsor no longer is a “guarantee”. Just happened this sem to a lot of candidates who had such qualifications.
csMajors,fni94cv,t3_g1tkd9,1586976069.0,If Emory gives you good aid go to Emory. Not because of the CS opportunities but because of the private school experience and the much better support system than the others overrides the “prestige” factor
learnmath,fn9epow,t1_fn9d7yc,1586770097.0,"Thanks for the explanations! Really helped a lot. Just to clarify things up:

For clarifying up the bijection part. That means that if Adam and Benin are friends (and no one else being friends), then that has a one-to-one correspondence to Chiang, Deshawn, Esther, and Fiona all being friends (and Adam and Benin are **not** friends)?

And in general, can we apply this ""look in a single perspective"" trick to any counting problem that has a similar ""undirected graph""-like form?"
berkeley,fmtey9z,t3_fwezfc,1586371578.0,"Project 2 was terrible in its length but shouldn’t be too hard to figure out. I think it also had to do that I did the entire project alone. But I would call it difficult based on the tens of hours on debugging alone for Proj. 2.

Project 1 was really fun and would do another project similar to such"
