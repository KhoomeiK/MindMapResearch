twicememes,fp04rhz,t3_gaaluy,1588202468.0,Man I really feel Jeongyeon on a personal level here. I moved to the U.S. at a young age from Myanmar and wasnâ€™t able to go back for about 7 years. I had went from 5th grade to graduating from high school during that time but couldnâ€™t go back to see my grandpa before he passed away during my junior year. I really wish he couldâ€™ve seen the person I had become. I was sad  about it for a long time but Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s proud of me just as Iâ€™m sure Jeongyeonâ€™s grandma is proud of her.
