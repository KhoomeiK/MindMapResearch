AskAnthropology,fndixrq,t1_fnd7833,1586871060.0,"It’s a question, not a statement. 

The scientific method begins with such questions. These questions form a hypothesis (from this... I’d say that the hypothesis is that a wealth of surviving material culture can be attributed to the culture of the European invaders)  

If OP looked into the history of surviving artifacts named they would learn about the historical processes (such as Mayan scribes learning to write in Latin script, making written versions of the originally oral Popol Vuh and secreting them away from the Spanish)which were  that allowed for the survival of some things and not others. Also OP might want to consider the differences in religion and Art at a state level vs. a tribal level of culture.

Thus the question or approach of inquiry changes.

Aha the genesis  of methodology! 

Questions aren’t antiscience. 

I’m quite over the line in the sand that purists and... pop sci as you call it have drawn. It really clogs up discourse.

True discussion is a great way to clear confusion and misunderstanding not appeals to authority."
