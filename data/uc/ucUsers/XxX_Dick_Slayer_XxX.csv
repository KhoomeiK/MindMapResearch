SubredditDrama,fpc3y6g,t1_fpc3o3j,1588486815.0,"Yes I agree it's laziness. It's also pressure and anxiety. I'm sure maybe some of those students worked hard but they saw a shortcut with a clear win. What they did was wrong and they deserved to get an institutional action on them. 

I've cheated before and it wasn't because I didn't study. I just didn't understand why it was important to be honest and the cost that comes along with thinking you can find an easier way."

It's all good man, I'll say it again. Let me know if you get it this time. 

You think that people will get sick anyway and because of that people should go out and get sick. That's some dumbass logic with no base in reality."

ucla,fo48lat,t3_g5j1i8,1587500058.0,"So a UCLA student is moving out and asks his friend to help him. They are driving all around the hill but because it's the end of the quarter they can't find any parking. So instead they have to park in a parking structure closer to campus. But even then they can't find any parking besides a reserved set of spaces for an event. They park there anyway and carry all the students belonging to the car with multiple trips. On one trip a parking inforcment student calls to them and says ""Hey you guys can't load here. USAC is gonna be here any moment for a meeting!"" The student replies ""Oh thank you but don't worry about it, My car is locked."

Wardy was a father of two, and a deacon at the St. Paul Tabernacle Baptist Church, always offering to pray for others, evangelizing on the street, and doing outreach work with his pastor.

medizzy,fnuj6uo,t1_fnui0l6,1587263366.0,"No, the neighbor farmer was sick of the cat going into his garden. He shot the cat and immediately regretted it and brought it into the clinic. The vet thought he must have missed because the cat was acting fine and didn't have any holes or blood. After the x-ray a small hole was found in the forhead. My sister works at the pet clinic and she took the photo. The owners were told and the farmer is really sorry if that counts for anything, he's paying for the healthcare. 

The cat was sent to a bigger university clinic and I was told he might live. I wouldn't bet on it but the  vet said she has seen worse."
