UCI,fpbzrlc,t3_gbao6z,1588483164.0,"Psych science professor here.  I don't use respondus but if I did - and if I saw a video of a student who was swearing about the questions - I would be laughing pretty hard - so, no worries.  Plus, there is no rule against swearing while taking a remotely-given exam in your own home.  

P.S. I""m sorry to hear that the exam was so hard, but I hope you did OK!  :)"

UCI,fpbz44x,t3_gcjcdv,1588482622.0,"Psych Science professor here.  I'm so sorry to hear that you are in such a tough situation right now.  Would you like me to connect you with one of the UCI Social Workers?  They may be able to provide you with some resources that can help.  If you would like a referral to a social worker, please email me at [joanne.zinger@uci.edu](mailto:joanne.zinger@uci.edu).  If you aren't looking for connection with resources but just some emotional/psychological support given your stressful situation, you may also want to consider making an appointment with the UCI Counseling Center:  [https://counseling.uci.edu/](https://counseling.uci.edu/)  \-  their services are free and confidential, and they are doing zoom appointments even though their physical office is closed."

UCI,fo21qgv,t1_fo0fnjs,1587447123.0,I love that your major is data science and your answer suggested that OP use data to help make their decision!  :)
