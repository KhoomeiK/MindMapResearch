IMO the fact that he confuses the heck of you is motivation to read notes before lecture and spend hours after reviewing notes as well to try and keep up. Like if you get to the point where you can listen to his lecture at normal speed and it makes sense, that's a great test to see if you understand the material. He's also hilarious and has the greatest sense of humor."
berkeley,fp3nbj5,t3_gb2dt7,1588282338.0,"If you choose UCLA, would you not be able to take CS/Data classes and learn CS/Data things if you wanted to? The actual classes you take is more important than the name of the degree you get; it's just a name indicating you took some classes in that department. I would not pick a college based on the name of the major you get as long as you are able to actually study what you want. Don't even worry about double majoring; just take the classes you are interested in and are useful to you, and then just see what major that will give you at the end. If that gives you a double major, so be it. From what I said, you can probably gather that I'm suggesting UCLA. I know it sucks to hear this, but ultimately choose what you think is right for you."
berkeley,fotjl9b,t3_g9avi4,1588055926.0,"Say that I'm being romantic or something, but I just wanted to note that it's important and fulfilling to focus on understand the material and learning in your classes. I agree with everything said above to improve exam scores, but make sure to take a step back from looking at your grades every once and a while and focus on the material itself. Keep in mind that for some classes (16B very noted), practice exams are less useful than just reviewing notes, discussion, homework, and simply just keeping up with the material.

Edit: Wanted to also mention that these two are not necessarily separate. Professor Rao often emphasizes that he supports having exams in his classes because the work students put into studying very often allows their knowledge of course content to mature very nicely."
berkeley,foq2sw3,t3_g8t5v8,1587980919.0,"170 + 162 will probably be lighter workload. I think people tend to forget that taking more ""easy"" classes is still usually harder than taking less ""hard"" classes. You don't want to constantly be in the position where remember you need to do another assignment for a class, because that starts to happen in 3+ tech semesters. It honestly depends on your interest/engagement in the courses, your study/project groups, and your background. That being said, 120 *is* a great class and I highly recommend. You may want to consider that if next semester is remote, it may be better to take your first choice because there is a less emphasized project/group work component that 162 has and will be harder to do remotely. 

My background for your context: I took 106A, 120, 170, and Math 110 all together, and did not have a fun time because I would constantly be remembering ""oh yeah I'm in this class and I have a homework due tomorrow fuck"" and thus never want to do 4 techs again. I did however find each class pretty fulfilling in its own way and am happy to talk about my experiences with them :)"
berkeley,focf12g,t3_g6kr61,1587670560.0,"Keep up with the class, go to lecture, discussion, don't cheat on the homework and do those honestly, no matter how long they are, and you should be good. Sounds simple but most of the class isn't doing all of these"
berkeley,fo8822m,t1_fo7v0ms,1587591586.0,"He definitely was not serious. The point of that image was to say if you take a 4 tech schedule, you will have a bad time and will almost surely have to sacrifice some aspect of healthy lifestyle. Sahai thinks pretty much no one should take 4 techs a semester, and doesn't really recommend 3 techs either."
berkeley,fo693z1,t1_fo5yqo9,1587551172.0,"I think it's a very vocal population, but necessarily the majority that does not like Sahai. If anything, I feel like he's gotten better and more approachable (or at least appears that way). Still, some quirks and strangeness that come with taking a class with him turn a lot of people off (self grades, long psets, Piazza rants, unwavering ideology about the necessity of 16A, 16B)."
berkeley,fo5kvti,t3_g5tplp,1587528167.0,"Hello, very happy to answer all and any questions about this! I'm a CS major, but my heart is in EE and as a result I've taken 120, 106A and am currently in 128, 106B and plan to take more controls/robotics/mechatronics related things down the road.

If you would list what courses you are interested in specifically, I can give more specific guidance, but I'll answer your questions in the general sense.

1/2. 16a/b aren't enforced prereqs for any EE upper divs, and you should be able to get by with your familiarity of circuits and lin alg. 16b honestly covers a lot of content that gets covered again by the upper divs, albeit at a faster pace, so you will definitely not suffer from not taking it.

3. Yeah! For upper div EE classes, try to give yourself familiarity with Python (although EE 128/ME 134 only uses Matlab) and some familiarity with the content they cover in 16a/b. This will set you up well to take a foundational class like EE 120 (although since you're ME I'm guessing you'll take ME 132 instead of this?). I'd say it's most important for you to go through 61A and 16B out of any lower division EECS. Seems like you got it covered for 61A, keep in mind that they also have a textbook http://composingprograms.com/. For 16B, you can access any offering of the course at 
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/[sp/fa][20/18/19/18/...]/ (select two letters for semester and two numbers for year, sp19 was my year and imo one of the better offerings) where notes should be available, although homework may only be publicly accessible for the most recent offering (sp20). Also for 16B, please look through Murat Arcak's reader http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/sp18/note/16Breader.pdf which provides a great, concise overview of the non-circuits stuff covered in these courses. Murat is a great man and this is really reflected by the quality of his notes :)

I also think it's worth reviewing some CS 70 stuff to build ""mathematical maturity"" as some EE upper divs (127, 126, 106) are pretty mathy. You can access any offering of the course at http://www.[fa/sp][20/19/18/...].eecs70.org/. However, going through the content at http://imt-decal.org/ would suffice as enough prep for more proof based math. I would just recommend looking through 70 course notes (which are pretty excellent!) if you have the time.

4. Upper div pre-reqs aren't really enforced. Don't worry about asking for instructor consent. I can't really speak for the general upper div EE course, but for Intro to Robotics, you do not have to have taken EE 120 (the listed upper div prereq). Ask anyone on course staff for that class, they will tell you that this prereq used to be relevant sometime in the past and they just haven't updated course information. The only prereqs are familiarity with Python and freshman linear algebra (54), although I would recommend some familiarity with proof based math. I can't really speak for the more hardware/circuits EE classes, but the only prereq structure I would probably consider is 120 -> 123, 128; 106A -> 106B. You're definitely fine to take 120, 106A, or 127, but I would highly consider taking CS 70 or Stat 134 before taking 126.

Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's something I said which doesn't make sense!"
berkeley,fo2ewzp,t3_g55gfw,1587459775.0,"Like someone said, the alternative is you don't confess and you risk strictly worse damage. I cannot imagine course staff going back on their word for something like this."
berkeley,fo0glj1,t3_g4zp6b,1587412762.0,"Recommended course plan is 61C and 70 together first semester Sophmore year, so yes this is realistic. It's not uncommon to see people doing 70 earlier with 16B and 61B. Depending on who is teaching these classes, the workload of this can be manageable to depressing. For me it was manageable."
berkeley,fnejq35,t3_g12izh,1586890596.0,Have you taken 106A/B? If you're interested in robotics these are pretty good.
berkeley,fnahcp4,t3_g0jjbj,1586797524.0,TBH I feel like I had the shallowest understanding of bounds and estimators when doing probability in 70.
berkeley,fn66cg4,t3_fzqudl,1586689173.0,"I took 70 and 16B the same semester so I had a lot of time to compare them lol. Test wise, 70 was harder, but it as also curved (although I know that's not the case this semester). Homework wise, 70 psets were shorter but each question took a long time to do, while 16B psets were loooong but each question wasn't bad TBH, but you could feel your understanding of the material get better. 16B is much more of an applied class than 70 I'd say (in terms of examples/concepts) and does have proofs, but the emphasis is much less proofs than 70. It is a very math heavy course though. The grading is usually generous, and you always have lab for a big grade bump too. 16B was my favorite class in lower division, which isn't common for many people to say, but there's a lot to appreciate in terms of the breadth of material covered and the passion of the instructors and course staff who teach. I would have to say 70 was a harder course overall, but I spent the same amount of time on both courses."
berkeley,fn4dmti,t1_fn2k0mg,1586639221.0,"Sahai never actually meant that, it was a kind of meme to tell people not to take 4 techs. When I was taking 16B with him, he told us 3 techs is too much for most people, and he would never recommend 4."
