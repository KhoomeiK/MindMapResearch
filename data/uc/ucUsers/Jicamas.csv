You wake up and leave home at 7, commute two hours to go 15 miles, arrive at work at 9, and then you leave work and it's the same story. You arrive home at 7pm, in which you have spent 12 hours of your day working/commuting. Assuming you need 8 hours of sleep, that leaves you with only a couple hours of free time. You do this five days a week.

AskReddit,fo46lz2,t3_g5cuo2,1587499079.0,"Oblivion. There is a glitch in the game where if you go to a specific NPC's house and give him money you can get unlimited gold by attacking him. All you have to do is hit him with a paralysis-poisoned dagger and open his inventory immediately after (but do not kill him), and the gold amount he has won't disappear. This means you can keep clicking the gold to your heart's content and easily get over a million in 20 minutes (or more if you play it longer). 

So it would go like this:

* get paralysis poison
* go to Dorian's house 
* Give him some money
* Hit him with a poisoned dagger
* Grab endless amounts of gold off of him
* Sell the gold in real life for millions of dollars

If you do consider one, however, and you haven't ridden before, then starting out on a supersport bike is a very bad idea. Take an MSF course and start out on a sub-500cc bike to get familiar and experience riding before you jump up to something that quick.

When they got to the ER the patient was almost room temperature. Needless to say that EMT got arrested and Ambulnz got sued by the patient's family. Don't know what happened after that. 

This is just one of many horror stories that I've heard about Ambulnz from people that used to work there (or whose company got taken over by them), but it's the one I'll never forget. If one of these rigs ever shows up to pick up my grandma, I'll take my chances and just drive her myself."

Nursing home failed to put up any precautions and no one told us about it. We didn't find out until we got back to station and one of the dispatchers told us. When my partner and I told management what happened they basically told me and my partner to fuck off. The next morning I called the manager and told him (among other things) that I quit. That was the last straw. 

Got my phlebotomy cert and worked as an ER Tech for a year before leaving the medical field altogether. I'm back in school now studying a new field much better suited for me and will be graduating in June. My partner, meanwhile, left the company a month after I did and is now in nursing school. 

My point with all of this is you gotta be happy, man. EMS is definitely not for everyone, and for people like us there are better things to work towards. Take away all the good things from your EMS days (what you learned, good days you had, etc.) and carry that with you wherever you go. You're gonna kick ass no matter what field you end up in.
