ucla,fphg31r,t1_fpea2j5,1588620661.0,"Congrats on your acceptance!

Depends what you are looking for in price, amenities, social environment, etc. A lot of transfers choose the transfer LLC which is pretty much just a building full of transfers. It‚Äôs in De Neve Holly (with some overflow in Gardenia) and the rooms are deluxe triples with communal bathrooms (there are a few doubles but not many). The deluxe rooms are larger than classics and they have air conditioning. The communal bathrooms and lounges on each floor generally mean there is more socializing between rooms, and it‚Äôs really nice to be surrounded by other transfers. I enjoyed my time living there although it was pretty loud at times and there was a clique on my floor that made a lot of people miserable. 

If you want something quiet and would prefer a bathroom attached to your room, some transfers choose plazas (with the option for a private bathroom or a bathroom shared between two rooms) but they are more expensive and some people say they are less social.

If you‚Äôre looking for the cheapest option, you can go for a classic triple, but most of the other residents will be freshman."

ucla,fpg75s2,t3_gd6bka,1588596119.0,"A few people in my classes have, one of my professors even gave a blanket two day extension because so many people asked for one, and then he continued giving out individual extensions if people had good reasons.

I would say try not to use the fact that you have multiple midterms as your reason. Be honest about your situation and the stressors you are facing, whether it be mental health, family issues, etc. Hopefully they will appreciate your honesty and be compassionate. I honestly don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôre expected to do anything beyond basic assignments right now to be completely honest, this shit is wild"
ucla,fpbswva,t3_gcjvnc,1588477898.0,"Nope, no libraries are open, and no buildings either. The study (just the study area not the food) is open for students who are still living on the hill only. The campus is crawling with people (who often aren‚Äôt practicing social distancing), it‚Äôs better to stay away if you can."
CoronavirusCA,fp618l0,t1_fp5zxcw,1588344142.0,"This is really helpful, thank you. I‚Äôm sorry you had to miss your trip to Japan, I really hope you can reschedule your trip in the not so distant future!

Thinking about telling stories to future generations is definitely helpful. I‚Äôm just afraid that I will look back on my college years and be sad that I missed out."
CoronavirusCA,fp5d66r,t3_gbdice,1588324946.0,"I don‚Äôt really know if this is the place, but does anyone have advice for coming to terms with missing out on my college experience? I‚Äôm a transfer student so I only have two years at my school, I just got here in the fall and I‚Äôm afraid this won‚Äôt end by next Spring and I will miss out on everything.

I‚Äôve been trying to stay hopeful but things seem more and more abysmal every day. I‚Äôve struggled a lot in my life but things were finally going so well, and now it feels like everything‚Äôs slipping through my fingers. I‚Äôm wondering how other people are coping with missing out on things and if they can pass on any wisdom."
ucla,fp5b3nx,t1_fp50bgs,1588322738.0,"One of the proctors said it's only open to people living on the hill right now, I think they are scanning bruin cards but not sure."
ucla,fp5aofd,t1_fp32fn0,1588322288.0,It really do be extra shitty for us rn :( Really nice just to commiserate though.
ucla,fp5amvg,t1_fp0atp5,1588322240.0,"Exactly, even missing out on one quarter is bad enough. Like you said, there are so many small things that really make the experience, just walking to class or sitting in the library to study."
ucla,fp5aiah,t1_fp03vcn,1588322105.0,It really just sucks :( I hope you still get to study abroad
ucla,fp5agsf,t1_fozz8zh,1588322061.0,Exactly... It's getting harder to hold out hope. I really told myself it would just be one quarter and I was okay with that. I just don't even know what I'll do if it drags on any longer. I'm sad as hell

Thanks for letting us know"
ucla,fp07wt7,t1_fozqjb8,1588204147.0,"I feel the same way. Everything was going so well, I finally felt happy and successful and well connected and now I‚Äôve just been completely alone in my dorm room for almost 6 weeks. I spent so many years feeling inadequate, watching the people from my high school go off to amazing schools and have the time of their lives, and this was finally my time. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been struggling too. Something that‚Äôs been helping me a bit is attending the virtual reslife events and Zoom meetings for some other campus orgs too. Makes me feel a little more connected to UCLA."
ucla,fp070tq,t1_fozgq8p,1588203678.0,"The uncertainty is absolutely the worst part. I‚Äôm trying not to obsess over the possibilities but everyone is saying different things and everything feels completely up in the air. If we knew what was going to happen I think it might be easier to accept it and deal with it, but it‚Äôs just a constant state of anxiety at this point


I hope they will let people defer, but I think they really need the tuition to stay afloat. For me I‚Äôm already 2 years older than most students and I can‚Äôt really put my education on hold any longer. Just sucks.

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been struggling too. CAPS lifted their session limit, that‚Äôs been helpful for me. There‚Äôs also some groups from the RISE center, reslife, etc that are kind of nice, makes me feel less alone."
ucla,fp06sw5,t1_fozmn67,1588203559.0,"Exactly. It feels like you finally made it and then it‚Äôs ripped out from under you without warning.

I‚Äôm still in the dorms so I just sit in the same room, day in and day out, completely alone except for the people on my screens. Definitely not what I dreamed about when I got that acceptance letter."
ucla,fp063kj,t1_fozgabb,1588203185.0,"Thanks, it really just sucks for everyone :( I think the uncertainty and helplessness is the worst part."
ucla,fp05o1b,t1_fozv42t,1588202953.0,"I really hope things change in the next 5 months. I think we are in a better position than schools on the semester system, especially since we don‚Äôt start until October this year."
ucla,fp059we,t1_fozwy4g,1588202741.0,"Next year is my 2nd year as a transfer, so yeah only 2 quarters of normalcy üòî 

I totally feel that, I can imagine how much it would hurt to work so hard and then to have your last quarter ripped out from under you :( I also didn‚Äôt go to my hs graduation and always dreamed of my college experience to make up for all of the things I missed in high school. This sucks big time. I hope y‚Äôall can still have a ceremony at some point."

ucla,fosehgf,t1_fophvwi,1588029131.0,"Definitely depends on the major. I‚Äôm a social science major and pretty much none of my classes are curved, everyone is very nice and collaborative, I‚Äôm always able to find study groups, shared google doc study guides, etc. Some of my friends in STEM have a harder time."
ucla,fonz56b,t1_folkspy,1587929339.0,"Does your acceptance say ‚Äúpre-communications major‚Äù? A lot of impacted majors admit transfers as pre-majors, and then as soon as you have taken the required class you can petition to officially declare the major. Definitely shoot an email to the person that the other commenter linked just to make sure!"
ucla,fonyigk,t1_fom99ak,1587928983.0,"[Here](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Academics/Academic-Counseling) is the info for all the counseling offices. What‚Äôs your major? If you‚Äôre in the College of Letters & Sciences, most people are assigned to College Academic Counseling (unless you‚Äôre part of AAP or College Honors). They‚Äôre offering drop in hours, 30 minute zoom or phone appointments, or you can message them through the UCLA message center. All that info is [here](https://cac.ucla.edu/connection/connecting-to-cac-02/). Each major also has departmental counselors that can help you more with which classes you should take, creating a graduation plan, etc. If you let me know your major I can help you find the counselors for that department! Good luck and congrats :)"
ucla,fomkzru,t1_folxvr8,1587893980.0,"I had this problem last year the day before the priority app was due and they weren‚Äôt able to get back to me before the deadline, but they easily fixed it afterwards. They should get back to you before the 3rd, they usually answer emails within 48 hours, even during Covid."
ucla,fomkrvf,t1_foi5mvx,1587893741.0,"I would say it really depends on the major and the rigor of your community college. I‚Äôm a social science major and I haven‚Äôt found it to be much more difficult, I‚Äôve definitely had to work harder and adjust my study habits but I‚Äôve been able to manage a 4.0 while still maintaining a solid social life. I also came from a CC on the quarter system and my classes there were fairly challenging so that helped with the transition. My transfer friends who are STEM majors or who came from CCs that weren‚Äôt as academically challenging had a harder time adjusting the first quarter, but most have adjusted well by now."
ucla,fomkgsx,t1_foihfqq,1587893408.0,"I personally chose UCLA over Berkeley, the difference in prestige isn‚Äôt big enough to offset other factors imo. Ultimately choose the school that you feel will be the best fit for you, what will help your education and career the most, and where you will be happiest. Time passes anyways; if Cal feels like the place for you, one semester won‚Äôt set your whole life back. You could use that extra semester to get some work or volunteer experience. It might even be a good thing considering fall might be online. But if you‚Äôre choosing Cal just based on what people have told you about prestige, I would try to put that aside and really make your decision based on what will be the best for you, your education, and your happiness."
ucla,fomk3cn,t1_foihghu,1587892998.0,"I would! It really felt like the school for me and I‚Äôm happy with my choice. The decision was pretty clear for me though, it was between here and Berkeley and I disliked everything about Cal and when I visited UCLA I absolutely loved it, so that made choosing easy. I like the atmosphere here, the weather is great, the campus is beautiful, the surrounding area is nice and Westwood is lowkey but still has stuff to do, Santa Monica is only 15 mins away. I really enjoy my classes and there‚Äôs lots of stuff to get involved in. The housing is nice and the food is so good. I think the best thing I did that has really helped me have a positive experience is putting myself out there, talking to people and getting involved in lots of clubs and organizations (it‚Äôs pretty typical to drop stuff and just keep the things you really like, which is what I did). 

Congrats and good luck with your decision!"
ucla,fomjhb7,t1_foixcoj,1587892330.0,"Congrats! I can answer a few of these.

2. At this point we don‚Äôt know if fall will be online or not, they haven‚Äôt said anything yet but I would prepare for the possibility just in case.
3. Transfers get one year of guaranteed housing, so if you sign up for housing you will get a spot, it just might not be the one you wanted. I was part of the transfer community in De Neve Holly and it was a good experience, the rooms are Deluxe Triples which are larger than classics and have air conditioning, and it was nice to be with other transfers. If by one room you mean a single room, they are pretty hard to come by. Most rooms in the dorms are triples, with some doubles and even fewer singles.
4. There are a lot of things I love! I really like how many opportunities there are. It can be overwhelming at first but it is really fun to get involved and try out new clubs, orgs, events, classes, etc. I‚Äôd recommend attending the virtual bruin day to see if there are things that interest you, going to the club day/giant activity fair in the fall, and looking online for other things you might be interested in. Don‚Äôt be afraid to drop things you don‚Äôt love or try out new things throughout the year. 

Congrats again and good luck!"
ucla,fomitnw,t1_foj3ke7,1587891619.0,"I was part of the transfer LLC, which is basically just a building full of transfers (De Neve Holly and overflows into Gardenia). There wasn‚Äôt really anything more to it other than being housed with other transfers, but it‚Äôs definitely nice to be with people who share your experience, are also new and looking to make friends, are a bit older than the freshman, etc. Unfortunately there was a group of people on my floor who made a lot of other people on the floor uncomfortable and folks ended up avoiding the lounge because of them, but besides that I enjoyed my experience and I made some good friends.

I wouldn‚Äôt say most people are part of an LLC, from what I understand most other LLCs are just a floor or two so that would be like 80-160 people or less."
ucla,fomi7m2,t1_fokh90r,1587890970.0,If you want to have your own room be prepared to shell out a lot of cash. If you want a single room in an apartment be prepared to pay at least $1500 a month unless you‚Äôre willing to live farther from campus. There are single rooms in the dorms but they are pretty hard to get from what I understand and they are also expensive. [This facebook group](https://m.facebook.com/#!/groups/415336998925847?tsid=0.6117334386156299&source=result) is probably the best way to find a room off campus but you could also try craigslist and other fb groups you might come across. Good luck!
ucla,fomhy8j,t1_fokx8o4,1587890695.0,"Unfortunately we don‚Äôt know when they will update us. A lot could change in a few months so I imagine they will wait a while longer before making the decision.

As for counselors, there are school counselors and departmental counselors. Most students in the College of Letters & Sciences are part of College Academic Counseling, unless you are part of the AAP or College Honors programs. You can find the list of counseling offices [here](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Academics/Academic-Counseling). Each major also has its own counselors which can help you more with planning specific classes and creating a graduation plan. [Here](https://economics.ucla.edu/undergraduate) is the econ department site with the option to schedule an appointment with a counselor. For my department you can meet with any counselor but I‚Äôm not sure how it works for econ.

Good luck and congrats!"
ucla,fomhcl5,t1_fomdzbv,1587890050.0,"I‚Äôm not OP but there is a building dedicated to transfers, De Neve Holly! It‚Äôs one of the themed ‚Äúliving learning communities‚Äù in the dorms. The rooms in the building are mostly deluxe triples, which are bigger than the classics and have air conditioning. There are communal bathrooms on each floor (which are really nice compared to the ones in the older buildings!) as well as study lounges. Transfers get one year of guaranteed housing so you will definitely get a spot somewhere, but if you want the best chance to get a room in Holly, you should select deluxe triple as your first choice on the housing application and when they ask if you would like to be in an LLC, select the transfer community. Some overflow transfers are placed in De Neve Gardenia which is Holly‚Äôs sister building, also very nice. Both buildings have a few doubles but not many. 

If you want a private bathroom (shared with 2 other people) or a shared bathroom (shared with 5 other people) you can choose a plaza, but those are more expensive and some people find it harder to make friends; at the same time, a lot of people don‚Äôt end up hanging out with the people on their floor after the first couple of months anyways so do what‚Äôs most comfortable to you. Good luck!"
