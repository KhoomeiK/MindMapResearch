UCSC,fpakvyf,t1_fpabtjv,1588450269.0,Did you apply through the regular CA state unemployment or is there like a university unemployment you apply through?
UCSC,fp677pm,t1_fp5zled,1588347325.0,Unfortunately you can’t enroll if there’s a hold on your account. So I have to sit on my hands until they fix it.
UCSC,fp58jqi,t3_gbdfyr,1588320057.0,Fuck the financial aid office has been giving me the run around for three weeks now and has a hold on my account. I’m worried I’m gonna miss the class I need since it only has ten spots left.
UCSC,fp3s2pj,t3_gb3mso,1588284775.0,What changed within it? Your portal should tell you how much you’re getting and where it’s coming from.
AmItheAsshole,fozocyr,t3_ga6zfw,1588194035.0,YTA. Your child deserves to choose if they want to follow your religion or not. Forcing your religion on her and making her change to another school that's focused on religion is a guaranteed way to make her reluctant to believe in it.  Also if you choose to go through her phone and track her you WILL teach her she can't trust you. Invading your child's privacy is a one-way ticket to them starting to hiding things from you and finding ways to get around rules.
harrypotter,foxoxc1,t1_fowu4uq,1588151124.0,You make good points. But the one thing I think is valid to get mad about is it kind of takes away from how tragic it is. Having a recently married couple in their early 20s die is a severely different impact emotionally then two people who look to be in their mid 30s. It’s easy to forget that the order of the Phoenix was just barely out of school instead of being settled down adults.
UCSC,fowi4at,t1_fow3c3m,1588120222.0,"Usually, in my experience it's easier to just go directly to the department I need help with instead of waiting for my college advisor and then waiting for whoever they send me to. For example, when I got ahold of them today they just sent me back to the financial aid office."
UCSC,fov1tld,t1_fov13gu,1588094009.0,"Okay, that was the information I was looking for. Didn’t expect anyone else on reddit to be able to help, but was hoping they could point me in the direction of another office who could. Thanks."
Twitch,forkv1c,t3_g8tjsh,1588013934.0,Honestly just roll with it and make some jokes about it next stream. One of the issues I find on twitch is people take themselves too seriously. Have fun with it.
UCSC,foghi18,t1_fofyxyy,1587752645.0,"How is it irrelevant? If that person chooses to they could start stalking you or worse. That’s a very real concern. 

How is posting a picture at all leading to trace back? Unless you have geotags on or there’s an obvious address or landmark in the photo it won’t give away your home address. Also most people don’t take photos right outside their house. Trust me I’m aware that you can have information found out. But finding someone’s exact address based off of their social media isnt always possible if they’re not an idiot. And even if someone was capable of finding my info by creeping through my social media and piecing it together, that doesn't mean I'm cool handing all my info over to a stranger in one second."
UCSC,fofv31u,t1_foftym0,1587743340.0,"You clearly don't understand the point I'm making. You are giving a specific random stranger, the person proctoring you, all your information in a single second. Even if that information is available online, it takes more than a second to get it. My main point wasn't about the company having it, but an unvetted stranger.

In the case of effort vs brains, it's the same thing here. People who are smart enough not to list their address online typically also make the effort to not post photos, videos, or text with that information. It's not a lot of effort to do those things. Sure, a lot of people may list the city they live in, but unless you live in a small town, it's uncommon that that is enough info to have your entire address."
UCSC,fofq28p,t1_fofownt,1587740782.0,"You're being incredibly obtuse dude. There's a huge difference between the general risk of smartphones and being forced to give a complete stranger access to your computer, what you look like, and all of the info on your ID.   


Also, yes I'll agree that most people aren't super strict about monitoring their information that's put online, but most people are smart enough to not throw out so much information that you could know their exact address."
UCSC,fofn8dq,t1_fofmcas,1587739302.0,Just because you don’t monitor your information doesn’t mean other people don’t.
UCSC,foe4exz,t1_fobo6mh,1587695807.0,"Another issue with this is that ProctorU doesn't have strict policies for who they hire. So you now have a potentially very untrustworthy stranger who has your full name, date of birth, and address."
AmItheAsshole,fodalyt,t1_focjrfg,1587682294.0,"I wasn't saying specifically that OP forced her, I was saying generally you can't force your partner to stop doing something you find unattractive. OP definitely guilted her though which is super shitty.  


Also, good job not responding to anything else I said."
AmItheAsshole,fodabmj,t1_focmdtx,1587682201.0,"Agree to disagree about the womens facial hair thing then.  


As far as discomfort about legs during sex, you realize women also have to feel men's hair during sex too right? So women not only deal with scratchy beards but men's scratchy leg hair, but men only have to deal with women leg hair. Also you realize women feel beards during oral right?   


We're not talking about jobs though, that's not relevant. With that being said though, jobs also require women to shave. We're talking about a partner's personal preference. I never said that all women have issues with facial hair. I said that if a man expects a woman to shave her legs literally every day then he should also be willing to shave every single day. Which a lot of men who expect shaved legs wouldn't be willing to also shave their face every day. My whole thing is that if you have an expectation of your partner then you should be willing to do the same."
AmItheAsshole,focft4x,t1_foceerj,1587670825.0,"I never said that was the issue with OPs post. My original statement was replying to the idea that men not keeping up hygiene is the same as women not shaving their legs. Which the issue with that is they’re not the shame. Women can have leg hair and be hygienic the same way men can. 

Also I never said that I get to decide what someone’s SO finds attractive. I simply said that weight gain is not an equivalence to shaved legs because weight gain has far more effects than shaved legs do. Someone is entirely allowed to find shaved legs unattractive but they shouldn’t be an asshole about it when they tell their partner. If OP has such an issue with it then he should breakup with his girlfriend and find someone who’s gonna be okay shaving their legs every single day. You’re allowed to be not be attracted to a change in your partners appearance but you can’t force them to stop it."
AmItheAsshole,focd8q6,t1_focad6o,1587669953.0,"No it’s not. Weight is a huge thing that affects your entire body appearance, your health, your physical capabilities. Shaved legs literally only change the way legs look and feel."
AmItheAsshole,focd03h,t1_focausj,1587669876.0,"You think women shave their facial hair because they want to? There’s numerous women who have really high growth on their face and wish they didn’t have to shave it, but they do because it’s so unacceptable by society. Women get shamed for even having peach fuzz. 

The beard itchy vs leg itchy comparison doesn’t work. Women have to feel beards every time they kiss their partner or their partner rubs their face against any inch of their skin. You don’t feel leg hair every time you kiss someone. The discomfort from beards is far more common then the discomfort by legs. Also fine if you wanna insist that leg hair and beards are equal then if a man expects shaved legs all the time he should be prepared to have no facial hair all the time."
AmItheAsshole,foc8ytx,t1_foc3tf6,1587668503.0,That’s still not the same comparison. I imagine a lot of people would think it was okay for him to stop being attracted to his girlfriend if she gained 200 pounds. There’s nothing wrong with him not being attracted to hairy legs but he can’t really have expectations for shaved legs if he wouldn’t be able to shave his own. The same way he can’t be upset if his girlfriend gains weight but be fine gaining weight himself. Also good luck finding a girlfriend if you’re not attracted to leg hair because that shit grows everyday and it’s hard to find someone who’s gonna be cool shaving every single day.
AmItheAsshole,foc3kgk,t1_foc2vqk,1587666709.0,I’d disagree. Shaved legs and armpits look just as good on men as they do on women.
AmItheAsshole,foc2mb7,t1_foc24om,1587666414.0,"Because I didn’t have anything to say about it? I’m just pointing out that your comparison for specific things isn’t a direct comparison.

I see you just ignored everything I said in response."
AmItheAsshole,fobyjqv,t1_fob9rq3,1587665119.0,Men’s beards aren’t equal to women’s legs and armpits. Men’s beards are equal to women’s facial hair. Women are expected to have no facial hair even though they naturally grow it as well.
AmItheAsshole,foby5xc,t1_fobovjd,1587664990.0,"Showering or brushing your teeth isn’t the same situation. Those things are actual hygiene related things, you can be clean with hair on your legs and armpits. The direct comparison would be a man shaving his armpits and legs. If it’s apparently unclean and women are supposed to shave their armpits and legs then why shouldn’t men have to as well?"
AmItheAsshole,fobxt8v,t1_fobmewh,1587664874.0,If hairy armpits and legs don’t look good then why shouldn’t he have to shave too? This isn’t a comparison to men wiping their asses or showering. Men have legs and armpits too. So if women should shave theirs then why shouldn’t  men?
dankmemes,fo96g0m,t1_fo8u721,1587611636.0,I've had to yell at people to back up every time I've gone to the store. People will walk side by side and take up the entire main aisle or when passing walk in the middle of the aisle while I'm shoving myself as close to the shelves as possible.
UCSC,fo6028a,t3_g5uptx,1587541505.0,So far in my experience you just have your webcam on but mic muted. Then the TAs and professor just observe. It basically makes sure you’re not having other people in the room help you and stuff.
todayilearned,fo168qe,t1_fo156d7,1587426593.0,"For sure beauty has changed widely. The majority of photos you see from popular Instagram or internet ""celebrities"" are incredibly photoshopped or have had a ton of work done. Many young women, even a lot of adult men and women, don't realize this either so they compare themselves to these looks that are almost impossible to obtain. I don't think there's anything wrong with having work done or even photoshopping to some degree, but the issue is with lying about it and pretending its all natural."

AmItheAsshole,fndpw8f,t1_fncujas,1586875223.0,"You’re right, I did forgot that it’s on the bottom of the bags too. But I’ve been eating there for years now so the fact that I didn’t notice the other two locations goes to show how it’s pretty subtle."
AmItheAsshole,fncoee3,t1_fnbri51,1586842157.0,"I mean In-n-Out has a single bible verse on the inside, bottom of the cup. It’s hard to find it if you’re not looking. It’s way different than having them scribbled all over the containers."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fmr8bkx,t3_fwvmeh,1586316280.0,"My favorite thing about this conspiracy theory is that 5G is apparently killing you with your cellphones and computers, but all these people are using their cell phones and computers to talk about it. I don't know about y'all, but if I legitimately thought something was killing me I'd probably do my best to never use it."
DeniedGirls,fmqgwp4,t1_fmqfh01,1586299383.0,"I’m aware of that and I’m not shaming or insulting anyone who has consensual coercion or stuff like that. The comment initially read as someone trying to figure out how to convince their girlfriend to finally do lesbian stuff when they’re not gay. Which that is bordering manipulation. If you’re finding ways to convince your partner to do something they’ve already said they’re not interested in for your own pleasure, bdsm or not, that’s fucked up."
DeniedGirls,fmqbvl9,t1_fmq9wmv,1586296707.0,"Oh okay i see. Glad to hear its more of “convincing” within play instead of someone pushing you. While it’s nice to do things for your partner and try to do things they’ll enjoy, please don’t feel like you have to do lesbian stuff just because he enjoys it. It’s great trying things, but it’s also important to make sure you’re okay with it and interested too. Guys often try to get their girlfriends to do gay stuff even if they’re not interested in women, but wouldn’t be willing to do the reverse for their girlfriends. Just make sure that no matter what you choose it’s a choice you’re comfortable with, someone ones desires don’t outweigh your own boundaries."
DeniedGirls,fmq9s0b,t1_fmq5tkp,1586295559.0,This sounds really gross and manipulative. You shouldn't have to coerce your partner into doing anything. If she doesn't want to do anything with another girl then you should drop it.
Tinder,fmq6pdh,t1_fmq6hi5,1586293884.0,"I am right by technicality and what you said is wrong. You've also ignored the fact that that data is over a month old though, so the percentage is way higher than 0.2% now, so I'm also just right in general. Educate yourself dude."
harrypotter,fmpsivg,t3_fwlduz,1586286540.0,"There's some fan theories that aren't far off from this. I've heard people say they think the sorting hat puts people in houses that will help them with what they're lacking. Hermoine's smart, but she wouldn't have gained much from Ravenclaw so she went to Gryffindor to build up her bravery. Neville has many Hufflepuff traits, but what he lacked was courage. Just a few examples. It's not a perfect theory for sure, but it is one I really enjoy. I think overall the sorting house puts people not that necessarily match the house best, but can excel the most there."
AreTheStraightsOK,fmpplv5,t3_fwhktw,1586285046.0,"Usually, when I see these types of jokes it's posted as satire and whoever's posting doesn't actually have any issues eating popsicles or bananas or whatever normally."

Tinder,fmmqnsz,t1_fmmq8pf,1586210233.0,Literally look at any single record of the deaths by ages and you'll see that's wrong. Please do everyone a favor and educate yourself about a very real pandemic affecting everyone instead of calling people bitches needlessly on reddit.
LifeProTips,fmmqi7k,t1_fmmpua3,1586210150.0,"I mean a lot of why people approach one sex over the other in regards to certain hobbies is largely due to stereotypical gender roles. All I was saying though is that yarn isn't inherently something women know about or something men are ignorant about. It's unnecessary to make it about men or women, when it simply comes down to one not knowing about something because it's not a hobby they pursue."
Tinder,fmmolpu,t1_fmmoc8v,1586209122.0,She's literally said she's on tinder to talk with people and then meet up with them when the lockdown is lifted. Which is what anyone on tinder should be doing. You're a moron if you're meeting up with people from tinder right now.
LifeProTips,fmmnp0o,t1_fmmim5v,1586208631.0,"Pretty sure that's not a men thing, just a people who don't buy yarn thing..."
Tinder,fmmncnq,t1_fmmml4t,1586208450.0,"It's relevant in the context of tinder though, especially since he talked about sex first. Honestly, if someone is that personally hurt by a random stranger telling them they wouldn't be able to give them an orgasm then they probably could work on their self-esteem. I'm pretty sure being physically attacked is worse than an offhand comment about how you're bad at sex, but agree to disagree I guess."
Tinder,fmmlwdt,t1_fmml286,1586207680.0,"So he needs a physical beating, but telling him he wouldn't be able to make someone cum is overboard?"

AmItheAsshole,fmkjn8l,t1_fmj59t4,1586157234.0,At first I was gonna say no assholes because I figured the parents couldn’t afford gifts for all the kids and knew OP would get gifts from the grandparents. And that is shitty but I grew up poor so I kinda understand. But that both of the sections you quoted showed that this was more than just a money issue. NTA for sure.
