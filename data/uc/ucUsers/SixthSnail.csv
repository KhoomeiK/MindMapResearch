UCSantaBarbara,focylkz,t3_g6smp2,1587677598.0,I’ve seen a few posts on this so far. I’m willing to bet you will all be alright since it appears many of you will be in the same position in not finishing. At least I’m hopeful for y’all.
UCSantaBarbara,focy1m0,t1_focxpil,1587677386.0,"Not that I disagree, but note that internships, especially at big 4 are like elementary school recess compared to actually working there full time. That said, I wasn’t a great auditor, but still it was easier than school for me. It depends on the person. I like tasks, not studying, so work is simple."
UCSantaBarbara,focxk1b,t3_g6snsd,1587677196.0,"136B was my worst class in my major when I was at UCSB and I still did fine with employment and overall major GPA. Few of my friends were in the same boat, and we weren’t even dealing with what you guys are dealing with right now. Keep your head up and knock out the next exam. Working in accounting and finance is significantly easier than Econ/accounting classes, trust me haha."
UCSantaBarbara,fo5v6jv,t1_fo54mrm,1587536738.0,My roommate at UCSB 5 years ago broke a shock body in his Mini Cooper on that road. I miss it. Hope all of you get back to UCSB soon. Enjoy it.
overlanding,fnsv0zg,t1_fnr9nbf,1587229325.0,"I just moved to Austin last year. Only place I’ve brought my Tacoma is hidden falls and I wasn’t too impressed. Just not my style with mostly rock crawling and such. Are there any other local areas to cruise around? I built my truck for CA and AZ desert runs so o don’t fit that well in the TX off road community haha.

Also amazing 5th gen man. I had a 2014 before this Tacoma and had it set up very similarly. I still miss that rig at times!"
CountryMusic,fm4iigc,t3_fsl69c,1585754793.0,"I’m looking to get to your Austin show on June 1. What is the policy of it needs to be rescheduled or cancelled again?

Also, your cover of “What are you listening to” is on repeat for my work from home time during this quarantine. Just awesome!"
