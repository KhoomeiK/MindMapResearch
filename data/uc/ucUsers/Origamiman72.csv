berkeley,fpkz6yn,t3_gds099,1588703577.0,"I would say get the 13"" but for me the fact that it's still on 8th gen chips in 2020 doesn't make it worth the price."

MatebookXPro,fpisp6v,t3_gahzct,1588647843.0,I assume this still doesn't work with the Samsung PM981 ssd's right?
MatebookXPro,fpisjyp,t1_fp2spfc,1588647750.0,The matebook uses an intel wifi chip which macOS does not support.
MatebookXPro,fpis4ck,t3_gbjnm0,1588647477.0,"Any of them work fine just choose which one you like the best. I've tried Manjaro, Arch, Ubuntu, Elementary, PopOS they all worked the same."
MatebookXPro,fpirz05,t3_gdf43k,1588647382.0,I use manjaro daily and it works well but stutters sometimes. Fingerprint doesn't work but the hardware is still great. Stutters a lot less on i3 but gnome doesn't run well at all for me.
airpods,fpb1p03,t1_fpb18ut,1588460251.0,"I have the pros, but I know a lot of people with the originals which is how I tried their fit. Personally after trying both I would recommend galaxy buds plus if you can't fit your budget to the pros (and potentially even if you can). The fit is much better and so is the sound and battery"

airpods,fp8k8jk,t1_fp8idi5,1588394511.0,They fit for some people and not for others. They fit for me but I'm more bothered by how the lack of seal affects sound quality

airpods,fp87yi2,t3_gbwfgk,1588385790.0,They're basically the same fit as the standard wired EarPods.

berkeley,fp2gx8g,t3_gaw3la,1588261564.0,In L&S you don't have a major when you get in so you can just apply to any major right now. I don't know about anything once you declare though
Android,fp00h8s,t3_ga1k9i,1588200182.0,OnePlus 6. Was somewhat disappointed by oxygenOS so I'm on a pixel rom and loving it.

berkeley,fos6y60,t3_g97621,1588025080.0,"Make sure you understand the spec thoroughly! There's a great post on Piazza showing the details of what's inside an actual .git folder and I would recommend reading that too. Utilize Piazza, it's very very active for gitlet and you'll get some great help. And the best thing you can do is just start -it can be intimidating and you might not know what you're doing at first, and that's ok. Things will fall into place as you go along and you can always revise as need be, but the best thing you can do right now is getting started."
berkeley,fo23bk8,t3_g55581,1587448440.0,"Try taking a look inside a .git folder, it can be a useful reference. Someone also made a really good Piazza thread outlining the structure of git on Piazza which I recommend going through. The Piazza is also super active for gitlet so I recommend checking that out too ;)

But ultimately the best thing you can do it start. The hardest part is just looking at that blank screen and things start to fall in place as you go along."
berkeley,fnyxkr4,t3_g4nnmu,1587379430.0,"next week, I'm doing well enough in 61b/70 and ""not well"" enough in 16b that I can basically focus exclusively on 16b (plus I need to know whether to PNP)

also, start gitlet early!!! it really helps a lot especially with 70 and 16b coming up"

berkeley,fnpxdtb,t1_fnmrq0p,1587153728.0,Hmm I'm not sure. The professor is Zvezdelina Stankova; do you know which she uses?
berkeley,fnpx4uj,t1_fnmgnrw,1587153598.0,"awesome, thank you!"
Android,fnpnu9g,t1_fnpm2j9,1587148783.0,"The bugs I've been experiencing have been pretty common on r/OnePlus, although I realize there is a degree of self selection as only people with bugs would go there. But I have been getting the *same* bugs as them, suggesting that there is something there. OxygenOs *still* also has delayed notifications on slack and other apps, so I'm probably going to install a custom rom soon since it's actually made a big impact on my University life through that. I agree that iPhones arent free from bugs, far from it; but my experience with OnePlus software hasn't been great. I do like OOS for being close to stock Android, I just wish op had spent more time making it stable.

But I do agree with your first paragraph. I still think that besides the display, op doesn't offer as much as an iPhone 11 and this is coming from someone who really dislikes iOS. If I were to recommend someone a phone right now at that price point, I just feel like there's better options than a op8"
Android,fnpjutx,t1_fnp85xk,1587146766.0,"I agree that wireless charging doesn't generally mean that much nor an IP rating, but once the price starts climbing it starts to mean something. The camera on the op8 is decent, but definitely not on the level of an iPhone 11 (which in the US is same price, besides storage). And while I generally do prefer Android to iOS, OOS doesn't come close to having the same level of support as ios; and from my personal experience (with a op6), after the op7 came out, the op6 support hasn't been great. OOS 10 has largely been a buggy mess, to the point where it's deterring me from buying a future OnePlus phone at all. iPhones don't generally have that problem."
Android,fnp5hit,t1_fnnobte,1587139562.0,"I disagree; my phone is also only ever on vibrate or silent, and I use the toggle all the time to switch between them. The toggle also turns off media volume in silent mode and it's so convenient to just switch to silent in my pocket when I do into class or something and know everything is muted."
Android,fnp56f2,t1_fnoehdp,1587139405.0,"it's the same price as an iPhone 11, which gets much better software support and a much much better camera; and it doesn't have wireless charging, or an IP eating, or all these ""largely gimmicky features"" that other phones at this price point do have"
Android,fnnfzf5,t1_fnnd7wq,1587091491.0,"I don't think the 7t is as good as you're making it out to be; the camera is still not that great, and imo the s20 is still overall a better phone. I say this as a OnePlus 6 owner."
berkeley,fnmzh9f,t1_fnmdd9y,1587081233.0,"it's nothing like 53/4; the first half of the class is basically just proofs, so having a good understanding of math helps a lot here. You don't need to know any previous mathematical concepts specifically, you just need to be able to *understand* math if that makes sense. The second half is probability though so statistics experience could be helpful."
berkeley,fnmcwtc,t1_fnmb9lo,1587069163.0,"I don't *have* to take a math class, but I haven't taken anything for my math major here yet (besides cs classes that double dip) but thank you! this makes me feel better about this :)"
berkeley,fnm3hkl,t1_fnkrytw,1587064443.0,Depends how comfortable you are with math; if you're good at understanding math intuitively 70 won't be much of a problem. If you're not I'd say keep your courseload lighter

berkeley,fn0bl7z,t3_fycnbp,1586538948.0,"Haven't taken 61c yet but I'm in 61b/70/16b so for me personally

Conceptual difficulty

16b > 61b >=70 > 16a

Workload (sahai 70)

70 >> 61b > 16a > 16b

Overall Difficulty:

16b > 16a > 61b = 70

This is coming from someone who's relatively comfortable with math so I like 70 (I was not comfortable with proofs before 70 though)"
berkeley,fmuahcp,t1_fmuacy2,1586387596.0,some idiots zoombombed hilfinger's 61b lecture and shouted profanity among other things.
berkeley,fmtglpk,t3_fx9ba6,1586372366.0,Personally I feel like the amount of circuits you learn in 16a would be hard to self-study; I'd say take 16a for sure.
