AskReddit,fpdmefl,t1_fpdk6vb,1588529858.0,"What level of wealth are you talking about. “200k-1m household income, parents can pay for college, no financial worries, easy fall-back if you’re broke” level wealth? Or “100m net worth, can buy out congressmen and school buildings” level wealth”? 

There aren’t enough people in the second category to be the “vast majority of medical students.” The former group is definitely over represented in medicine. That level of income gives you an advantage in that you don’t have to worry about money over your education, but you still need to actually be a good student. Most of these people also don’t have the connections to finesse their way in. It seems unfair to say that someone who aced their exams and worked their ass off for 10 years is only a doctor because their parents were upper middle class. Again, there’s nepotism and corruption in literally every career, but medicine is probably the closest thing to an objective profession because there’s a series of exams you have to clear. Aside from literal bribery, privilege can’t get you out of those. 

For what it’s worth, my dad grew up dirt poor in a third world country and is now a doctor here. Nearly half of his medical class is in the US or Canada (brain drain wooh). The only privilege most of these people had was being intelligent. (Which, tbf, is an enormous source of privilege that people tend to discount.)

(Also, I’m pretty sure the controversy you’re talking about is for undergrads?)"
AskReddit,fpdgm88,t1_fpdb33p,1588526597.0,"Getting into medical school is a fairly meritocratic process. I'm sure there are edge cases for the ridiculously wealthy / connected, but overwhelmingly doctors are doctors because they were good at taking tests. An upper middle class background usually helps with that, but you can't just finesse you way in unless you have an absolutely ridiculous level of connections. (And again, if you somehow bypassed the licensing exams, that would be illegal.)

It's also tough to describe, but ime it's not fair to say that doctors give zero shits if you live or die beyond their own malpractice lawsuits. It's more that they form a level of emotional separation between their jobs and their lives. (Imagine how miserable a psychiatrist or an oncologist, for example, would be if they didn't.) In most OR specialties, most people who die are very old and very sick anyways."

I can tell you from my parents' experience in the field that most doctors don't particularly care about the lives of their patients on an emotional level - and emotional attachment doesn't necessarily improve care. They're motivated by interest for the field and ambition more than empathy. Even if you start out with the most altruistic of motives, you tend to get a bit jaded over time."
AskReddit,fpd9loz,t1_fpcpxvg,1588522637.0,"I'm not sure I agree with you. Becoming a doctor in the US mostly relies on one skill - being exceptionally good at test-taking. To get into med school, you have to get a good GPA and a good MCAT score. To become licensed as a doctor, you have to pass the USMLE step 1-3. (And if you want to do something competitive like surgery, you have to *ace* that exam.) Maybe the very top 0.001% have some absurd loopholes that let them get around the licensing process (or maybe absurd connections to med school faculties, etc.), but for the most part being rich can't just get you into medical school.

Obviously, having a supportive environment from your parents, not having to work jobs during college, going to good schools when you were younger, etc etc. all help, but that's more ""upper middle class"" than rich. But medicine is probably one of the least nepotistic industries."

AskAnAmerican,fp58yu6,t1_fp40sb5,1588320493.0,"Well, my opinion is that the debate on gun control is two separate debates. 

1) a debate on the consequentialist impacts - does gun control lead to meaningful reductions in firearm mortality? I've read a lot of evidence both ways on the issue, and the empirical consensus seems to be, not really. again, there are 400 million guns in circulation - there's almost no way to prevent criminals from accessing the black market. *however*, given the US has more homicides than most comparable countries and far more gun homicides, we'd probably be safer if we never had a gun culture to begin with. again, that's a problem with no good solution.

2) is there an unalienable right to gun ownership that outweighs the potential benefits of gun control? This is a more philosophical matter that, at least for me, is harder to justify. ""the constitution says so"" is not a good argument. ""the government owns guns, so must the populace"" well they own tanks and nuclear weapons too. ""fend off autocratic dictatorship"" I think mass shootings by some psycho are a much more realistic threat, that sounds like more of a dystopian fantasy than anything else.

The thing with unalienable rights is it's very hard to craft policy around them. I understand the conservative position on ""common sense"" gun control because it's perfectly consistent with what an unalienable right is. We have a right to free speech. That means, with very, very few narrowly crafted exceptions, the government can't stop you from saying what you want. They can't say ""oh, you can practice this religion, but not that one"" or ""oh, you can say this, but after you wait a week and apply for a permit."" Clearly, people who view guns as a similarly important right take similar positions on background checks, waiting periods, and assault rifle bans. I think guns are simply too dangerous - and many Americans are simply too un-trustworthy - to treat guns with the same absolutism.

To be clear, I *don't* think the solution to our issues is banning guns. But I think most of the ""moderate"" arguments on guns implicitly assume that an unalienable right to gun ownership does not exist. If we can find a similar vein of ""moderate"" gun control policy that empirically reduces deaths, we should adopt it."

I think if you took an HYPSM student at sent them to Cal instead, there wouldn't be a huge difference in what they'd be able to achieve. The main exception would probably be if they're a weak student - HYPSM is a much better place to be below average than. However, the average student at HYPSM is significantly better than the average student at Cal, so chances are they wouldn't be below average here to begin with.

I think Cal as a school is more oriented toward top students than toward average ones. CS70 (our discrete math class) is a great example of this imo. The class much, much harder than the equivalent class at similarly selective public schools. The result is that average students usually don't really get the material at all (although the class is curved like crazy, so it ends up not mattering too much), and well-above-average students get a challenge similar to what they might've gotten at a school like MIT.

nba,fnsumpa,t1_fnsqyxn,1587229110.0,"0.4% of Santa Clara county would be 80k cases, which is 80x the current confirmed number. Hence, 40-80x the confirmed number of cases. Even 1% would be 10x confirmed.

I missed the part on the false positives. 1% false positive would be bad though, because that would mean around half the positives are false.

The key number isn't case counts (because those are highly variable and subject to testing), it's death counts. santa clara county has had just 73 deaths compared to nearly 9000 for NYC. The fact that NYC has 9000 deaths in a city of ~9 million means 0.1% is a lower bound on the IFR. If the rate was in the vicinity of 0.2-0.3%, that would mean 1/3 to 1/2 of NYC has been infected."

Don't give the admissions committee more credit than they deserve - tons of accomplished, bright, great people get rejected, and tons of dumb assholes get in. The fact that you could go from such a low low to where you are now (and you got into some UCs at least) says a lot about your resilience and your drive, and getting rejected from Cal doesn't take away from that in the slightest.

Also, on a side note, admits get the same ""update has been posted"" email as well."

If this is true (and the test doesn't have issues with false positives), this is actually great news - it means the mortality rate is much lower than believed, and it means places like NY have probably hit herd immunity."

The fact that UCLA draws more applicants and now has a marginally lower acceptance rate doesn’t change that.

The idea that biden and trump are two sides of the same coin is absolute lunacy - there is no valid argument to it. Their political platforms could not be more different. Biden is also now running well to the left of Obama.

I think a lot of Bernie-or-bust people are too obsessed with his ideological purity. Biden's platform has evolved over the years, while Bernie has mostly stuck to his guns for decades. But you have to think pragmatically. If everyone in congress did what Bernie did, you'd cede congress (and power) entirely to right-wingers, and you woudn't get anything done. (And indeed, Biden has gotten a lot more done for the middle class than Bernie has, even if his intentions are less pure.) Bernie's refusal to compromise is also why I think he'd be a terrible president. Don't let perfection be the enemy of good."

politics,fnespmz,t1_fnbh1ap,1586895174.0,"Responding kind of late here, but I think we might just disagree on the green new deal.

1) A ban on fracking is a horrible idea. Right now, we simply do not have the storage capacity or the infrastructure to switch to renewables entirely. What a ban on fracking does in the short-term is put more pressure on either coal (which produces far more emissions than natural gas/oil) or imported fossil fuels. Importing fossil fuels is bad because it makes us dependent on the middle east / russia. I don't personally see the harm in exporting fossil fuels - chances are those other countries were gonna buy them somewhere anyways, might as well be the ones to sell to them. Also, most of the environmental issues related to fracking (aside from just fossil fuel production) are related to how the waste water is disposed and other bad practices - regulations can fix those.

2) If we spend trillions upon trillions of dollars trying to replace our power infrastructure in 10 years, we'll bankrupt our country, and unless everyone else in the world does the same thing, we won't make a dent on climate change. It's just not a realistic plan. Technological advances in renewables have come very far in the past decade, and projections are that in 10-15 years we'll be at a point where it is cheaper to build new renewables than to maintain existing power plants. At that point (and boosted by some government spending on renewable research/innovation and moderate subsidies), we can switch entirely to renewables without bankrupting our country. I really don't think the additional 10-15 years Bernie's plan would save is worth it when the rest of the world is sure as fuck not going to do the same thing.

You have to realize that China is just now starting to curtail emissions, India's electricity production will increase tremendously, and the entire continent of Africa (for the most part) has yet to develop. Until renewables become cheap enough to compete without subsidies, we'll never see a global solution to climate change. Because climate change is a global issue and not a national one, a green new deal will not actually solve the problem."
