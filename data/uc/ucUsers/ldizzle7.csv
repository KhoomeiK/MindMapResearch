premed,fphmsty,t1_fphmgpf,1588624047.0,thanks! Tbh I feel mentally and physically prepared for the challenge of med school but I'm not sure how med schools will feel about me. It would be a nightmare to lose like $5000 for no acceptances. thanks for your advice and good luck on your app!
premed,fphmcnx,t1_fphm2kt,1588623816.0,I have \~100 hours in 2 specialties and about \~300 clinical volunteering hours. do you think that would be sufficient? I was supposed to get more but my health-related internship got canceled
premed,fphm380,t1_fphh1k0,1588623681.0,"thanks for the advice. do you think my volunteering experience is sufficient for schools with those sort of directives? I feel like its really minimal compared to lots of other people. I was supposed to get more clinical hours last quarter but that got canceled. I think this summer I will hopefully be doing some more non-clinical volunteering and will be working at a SOM lab, but I'll have already submitted my app by then"
premed,fphlnoh,t1_fphj7sz,1588623462.0,"I'm for sure not dead set on a T20! I'd be happy with low/mid-tier MD. DO would be fine too. 

I guess its just that most posts I see on here people have thousands of hours of volunteering (clinical and non-clinical) and thousands of hours of research, with spectacular GPAs and MCAT scores, and all sorts of other fascinating experiences that I wish I had. It's a little intimidating I guess. It makes me feel like I'm not truly ready to apply."
premed,fphkzjr,t1_fphjprr,1588623122.0,oof I forgot to mention that. I have \~100 hours in 2 specialties
premed,fphamxc,t1_fp047vx,1588617891.0,"I'm no expert but your application seems very competitive for DO schools and it seems like you might have a shot at a good number of low/mid-tier MD schools due to your excellent ECs and volunteering.

edit: actually on second thought, idk how the mid-tier MD schools would feel about your MCAT, but definitely competitive for DO"
premed,fph7vyh,t1_fpgqvt6,1588616522.0,thanks!
premed,fpgqqp2,t1_fpgh69p,1588607790.0,Hey actually I found out that even if you are taking prereqs you can just put “CC” for the grade and submit your transcripts as long as they show the class is in progress
premed,fpfofvf,t1_fpfo6wx,1588577789.0,thanks for the info
Gifts,fpdqrjw,t1_fpdoa3m,1588532340.0,I like that bottle idea! I think I’ll do that!
Gifts,fpd7puz,t1_fpciphj,1588521558.0,I am! I’ll definitely be drinking with her
Gifts,fpd7nxf,t1_fpci8mt,1588521527.0,Great idea!
Gifts,fpd7mho,t1_fpcfn38,1588521505.0,That’s such a great idea! She would love that
Gifts,fpcaz89,t3_gbvhom,1588493773.0,"This is tough since you can't physically see her. Maybe write a page or so sentimental letter talking about why you love her, or some of your favorite memories with her, and send some flowers?"
Gifts,fpcafuj,t1_fpc9pzz,1588493221.0,"Dang I'm sorry that your 21st was like that, you seem like a really nice person. I'm sure your next birthday will be better. And holy smokes all of those ideas are solid. I think I'm gonna do all of those tbh!"
GetMotivated,fpag5mr,t3_gc96uf,1588447479.0,I bet this dude is gonna end up donating more than half of that million bucks to the kids. Thats awesome.
Mcat,fpab5ka,t1_fpa9vnq,1588444516.0,"OH I see. Well thanks for your opinion. Let me refine my argument for you very briefly. There are only a limited number of spots and thousands of applicants. Not everyone can be a doctor because it’s not logistically possible.  Hence, the ability to take the MCAT and not get a bad score is a rite of passage into medicine. If there was no MCAT there would be thousands more applicants for an already highly limited number of seats. With what you’re saying, literally anyone that finishes college can apply to med school. The schools won’t have time to look at every undergrads application who said fuck it I’ll apply for shits and giggles. They might even increase the cost of sending in primary applications and secondary applications to deter people from applying on a whim because they don’t know what they want to do after college."
Mcat,fpa9pgg,t1_fpa9ild,1588443663.0,LOL good job using google. I’m pretty sure medicine has gotten a lot better since 1928.
Mcat,fpa9jlt,t1_fpa8ust,1588443568.0,How is the MCAT being mandatory irrational? Are you saying that it’s irrational in general or it’s irrational for it to be mandatory this cycle?
Mcat,fpa8lv6,t1_fpa882i,1588443018.0,Lol thanks for the essay. Good luck trying to weasel out of taking an admissions test for a professional school that everyone in the history of US medicine has had to take.
Mcat,fp9z9zw,t1_fp9l8hb,1588437637.0,"Dude, you’re not understanding the point. The mcat is an exam to get into medical school, it’s not made to make people suffer for no reason. And about making the reporting of the exam optional, do you really think med schools will give equal weight to applications without a score? It’s unlikely."
UCDavis,fp9xhvx,t3_gc8le0,1588436596.0,Sad reaccs only
Mcat,fp9x3lt,t1_fp9avqw,1588436364.0,I don’t see how the fuck you’re going to become a competent doctor without taking tests and studying many hours? Am I missing something?
Mcat,fp9vszt,t1_fp8tkts,1588435599.0,I like how you mentioned first gen/low income students and I say that am both of those things and get downvoted. Seems like there’s a lot of people here that just don’t want to take an exam
Mcat,fp9v9ci,t1_fp9avqw,1588435273.0,"Lmao so medicine should be easy and we should let all the cry babies in, got it"
ImM1AndThisIsDeep,fp92v61,t3_g8oi9h,1588412191.0,I may not be a medical student yet but what the fuck is this
Mcat,fp8v1ln,t1_fp8uirz,1588403951.0,"I see your point, and thanks for the information about the shelf exams. I can’t say I agree with you about how med school admissions should be done in an ideal world but that’s the beauty of discourse about these things, there are different opinions. I guess I kinda agree with everything you’re saying but I still think that an exam is important because that’s naturally how we are evaluated. I don’t think a good physician can become a good physician without acing a couple of exams here and there. The physician may have boundless empathy and all of those qualities that make a great physician, but the knowledge still has to be there. And not just the knowledge, but the ability to apply the knowledge in stressful situations."
premed,fp8ubz1,t1_fp8thwd,1588403257.0,Lol didn't even think about that but that is so true.
Mcat,fp8u4xy,t1_fp8tkts,1588403070.0,"Also, shouldn't a good physician be able to pass STEP? Or is that not necessarily true? Actually asking. And I'm definitely not saying that if you aren't capable of taking the MCAT that you automatically won't make a good physician, but there's a good chance that you don't have the focus that it takes to succeed in med school, from what I hear at least."
Mcat,fp8tzyo,t1_fp8tkts,1588402936.0,"I'm both of those things that you mentioned, so I am familiar with barriers. I just think that it is important to weed out individuals who are capable of studying and those who aren't. I literally have friends who I love to death but they can't study to save their lives, but they are premeds just like me that think they are going to med school with a subpar gpa and no will to study or do anything remotely productive."
premed,fp8ttfj,t1_fp8tfu0,1588402764.0,Lol my bad dude its been a long day of studying. I furiously typed this shit out when I saw someone advertising this petition. I didn't really proof read or anything so the wording is probably awk.
premed,fp8szpd,t1_fp8suaj,1588401986.0,"How am I being condescending? I'm confused by what part of my comment offended you. I was just saying that I thought I made my viewpoint clear. Also just want to add that I did include that in my post - its the second half of the title. And also I argued in my post that it would fuck over people that have already taken it, which wouldn't be the case if it wasn't being pulled from the cycle."
Mcat,fp8snts,t1_fp8shnj,1588401676.0,I see what you are saying but I would argue that it does matter. It weeds out the people that don't want it bad enough. If getting into med school was easier I think more people would try to go to med school and more people would probably graduate since society needs doctors regardless.
Mcat,fp8sfgy,t1_fp8s0yx,1588401461.0,"[http://chng.it/TjhrjYXFc9](http://chng.it/TjhrjYXFc9)

Its only got like 500 signatures so far but the fact that it even exists is ridiculous"
Mcat,fp8s1gx,t1_fp8rvgz,1588401097.0,"I'm wondering the same thing. Also, where do I sign up for my refund for Uworld, TBR and hundreds of hours spent studying last summer"
premed,fp8rwie,t1_fp8rqtw,1588400968.0,"I'm against this petition -  I thought I made that abundantly clear in my post and my comment to you. But no it wouldn't work that way, people want for no MCAT scores to be included in this cycle's applications."
Mcat,fp8rkdx,t1_fp8rcg8,1588400657.0,I'm heated about it.
Mcat,fp8rj21,t1_fp8r0r8,1588400623.0,Keep your head up and rise to the challenge. You can do this friend.
premed,fp8r79o,t1_fp8qw8m,1588400327.0,I agree.
premed,fp8qv20,t1_fp8qm00,1588400027.0,"Yes that's true. But would you rather have some people that have to apply a year later to medical school or a bunch of medical students who didn't have to take the MCAT? I know plenty of people who want to be doctors but don't have the will power to sit down and study for an 8 hour exam. I would be terrified if they were my surgeon. The situation sucks but that's life. I feel like it's irresponsible to just let everyone into medical school. Also, what about the people that have already taken the exam? We would be getting screwed over arguably worse if our scores aren't being reported."
Mcat,fp8qi0v,t1_fp8qf5f,1588399705.0,Sorry to hear that. I hope things work out!
Mcat,fp8opff,t1_fp8d2yx,1588398164.0,"Also, the MCAT is a rite of passage into the field of medicine. There is no way you are going to attend an accredited US medical school without taking it. I don't see how it would be possible to be admitted into a medical school without taking the medical college admissions test. It's sort of like saying we should let pilots skip their pilot school admissions test because of coronavirus."
Mcat,fp8ocb1,t1_fp8d2yx,1588397856.0,"I hate to burst your bubble but that's definitely not going to happen. Thousands of people already have MCAT scores for their applications. Thousands of people have studied hundreds of hours and have paid hundreds of dollars for the whole MCAT process. Personally, I will be furious if my score isn't included in my application."
madlads,fp6opte,t3_gbml3t,1588355963.0,Damnit I tried to wipe the hair off my screen
Mcat,fp6klgk,t3_gbk6ns,1588353946.0,More like that's the person that the MCAT turns you into. If I didn't have a mental breakdown thinking that I didn't know anything a week before the exam I'd like to think I would have scored higher.
premed,fp52zma,t1_fp4l69c,1588314647.0,"I think you should count it, it’s time you spent in order to help others, so why not?"
premed,fp431qe,t1_fp3rkyf,1588290702.0,Do you mind me asking what the rest of your stats were like?
premed,fp3r11l,t1_fp3pqgu,1588284232.0,"Dang, 6 years is impressive. Around 2014 I was barely graduating high school and doing dumb shit with my friends, so definitely no volunteering for me 6 years ago. Congrats on being admitted!"
premed,fp3pkqj,t1_fp3oxre,1588283490.0,"Some of them did and some didn’t. I’m sort of conflicted on what to do because I don’t want to inflate my hours but I also want to make sure I get credit for what I actually did. When I sat down and estimated my hours I did a pretty conservative estimation of everything, like the minimum number of hours I spent on that every week, but in reality I think it should be more tbh"
premed,fp3nq41,t1_fp3nimi,1588282549.0,Even if it’s like hours of driving to pick up clothing donations for example? I had to do multiple road trips across the greater Bay Area to pick up all sorts of donations for clothing and supply drives that my committee had planned and sometimes it took an entire day
premed,fp3msz7,t1_fp3mkcs,1588282077.0,Nice!
premed,fp3mhoa,t1_fp3lux7,1588281917.0,"I’m already done with mostly everything that will be on my app, unfortunately I didn’t keep track of hours for anything"
premed,fp3m0px,t1_fp3lkh0,1588281678.0,Do people include things such as driving and/or planning things for orgs if they have leadership positions? I haven’t been counting that stuff - did pretty much what you said for one of my activities for which I had a leadership position but I only considered like general meetings and board meetings. Other than that I had spent a good amount of time planning things and driving places for the org... so should I count that too?
premed,fp0w8q7,t1_fp0v6dj,1588218337.0,"Thank you for the reply and advice! I have some non clinical volunteering that I didn’t mention but it doesn’t feel very significant - volunteered for CALPIRG here and there, probably about 100 hours total. Also the tutoring I did for a genetics class was technically volunteering I think because I didn’t get paid. I’m just so worried that it won’t be enough because looking at the WAMC thread many people have higher GPAs than me and have thousands of hours of volunteering and working in medical setting, not to mention thousands of hours of research + posters and stuff. After scrolling through that thread I seriously feel like I have such a small chance of getting in anywhere."
premed,fp01o02,t1_fozzivc,1588200812.0,"Thanks, that’s exactly the type of thing I’m looking for!"

premed,fowrhbb,t1_fowqros,1588125589.0,"My reason for waiting would be to work on improving my application so that I don't waste a ton of money applying this cycle! :/ I've been seeing some post of people saying they had like a 526/4.0 gpa but only got like 1 acceptance or something ridiculous like that.

edit: not only that, but they also said they had a lot of research (like 3 pubs) and had plenty of volunteering/clinical hours"

UCDavis,fogstqt,t1_fogqder,1587756579.0,I was considering that but I didn’t feel like it would actually result in anything and I also don’t want to stir up a shitstorm. I decided to just quietly vent on Reddit!
