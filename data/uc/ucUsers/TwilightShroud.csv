UCSD,fnjzz1e,t3_g269wi,1587011123.0,"Imo the foreign language classes at UCSD are both easy and fun so I would recommend taking them (I’ve only taken JAPN and LTKO though, and for fun).  It also was easy to get an A in the classes, they’re pretty lenient on grading compared to stem classes."

OverwatchUniversity,fnaaw6j,t3_g0h0lj,1586794250.0,"Playing Dva and playing Rein feels so different when it comes to CC.  Like, as Dva, CC doesn't really matter too much.  You get booped/hooked/stunned, it's ok 4 second boosters makes you far less punishable.  Whereas for Rein i'm just hopping backwards praying I can make it out, being pushed all over the place."
UCSD,fn9be7w,t3_g0ddl3,1586766364.0,"I saw my Japanese TA (teaches MWF and is married) by Vons once, and he said “konnichiwa” to me, he was walking with his wife

I took a second for me to recognize my TA outside of UCSD, another second to realize he said hello, and a final second to figure out how to properly greet him back in Japanese (I was taking Korean class that quarter, hence more confusion)

He laughed it off, was surreal"
