You'll have to toggle through the different terms to find an unlocked syllabus. Do the same for sociology. But fr tho, chem 14A is okay. I almost got a C for the two years of chem I took in HS, and I did fine in this class."

ucla,foij06c,t1_foiip12,1587787833.0,They did! So part of is was to cover the rent that the transfer student center pays. They also had to factor in 25% of it going to financial aid and some for asucla (I forgot the specifics for this part). They had a better breakdown of the total sum but those are the only ones I remember now.
ucla,foi7bkz,t3_g7l1yp,1587780220.0,"I did! It was mainly the asucla co-undergraduate reps and one of the leaders of the cub referendum speaking. Here are the things I remember. 

* 25% of the funds will go back to financial aid to alleviate the financial burden on students who need it the most
* CUB will provide a space for a black resource center, building of a meditation space for Muslim students, and allow the transfer students to save their funding for programming. Some of the funds will go towards the BOD fund which can be used by all SOLE registered student orgs as a funding source. 
* ""Why do students have to bail out admin to pay for this?""
   * They mainly said that it's a unity thing, if all students come together and show monetary support for a cause, it will show admin the importance of the cause. 
* ""Why now, especially during a pandemic?""
   * This has been in the works for ages. Especially now, showing support for these student groups further shows their importance. 
* ""Why not use the other spaces? (they mentioned an engineering building as an example""
   * All of the other student spaces (transfer student center, LGBTQ student center) are all in a centralized location. It makes sense to keep everything together. One of the Muslim student association reps mentioned that they have tried hosting prayers in a north campus building, and wooden, and it's not a good environment for prayer. 
   * Also, a lot of other UCs have a separate black resource center. 
* ""Are the resources here not enough? What will these additional spaces do?""
   * It's not completely about the resources. Especially for black students, there are a lot of resources that exist, but there isn't a space to host them. Getting these spaces will allow a centralized location and hopefully draw in more black students. 
   * Black students also have the lowest retention rates among the other race at UCLA. Having a centralized location can help expand retention programs.

They ended by having other student orgs (Samahang, Vietnamese SU, Muslim SA) talk about their lack of space. It wasn't super juicy tbh. If you have any specific questions, lmk and it might jog my memory. I feel like they danced around a lot of questions but overall it was informative."
ucla,fohoh64,t1_foho3gw,1587769542.0,Oh so sorry! I'm not affiliated with any office/committee/candidate. I just wanted to spread the word about the Q&A. It popped up on my facebook feed today. I would be happy to take the post down if I need to!

ucla,fodrtm6,t1_fodqhxq,1587688935.0,"Thank you for your response! 

Gen rep 2 was advocating for a student who's email explained how the additional fee would impact her financially. In this case, she is a part of a marginalized community, one that cannot afford this additional cost. Shouldn't student government be supporting her, a member of a marginalized community?

My friends' parents have lost their jobs. They are now using their financial aid return to pay rent instead of using it to purchase class materials or for housing next year. They aren't in any place to pay $45 more. Aren't they also a marginalized community? Isn't it important to advocate for them as well? I 100% support the work that this referendum will accomplish, but not when we're in the midst of a pandemic."
ucla,fodq1um,t3_g6xqhm,1587687962.0,"Hi, thank you for all of the hard work you've done! I just wanted to ask your opinion on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/g5ihjv/the_cub_referendum_is_about_asucla_dont_let_them/) about the CUB referendum. It was kind of alarming to read through this and I felt really powerless, especially because certain members of USAC insinuated that saying no to the referendum would be racist.

I also wanted to ask if you had any remarks about the April 14th USAC meeting and how one of the members really went off on gen rep 2 for voicing his (very valid) concern. This member used condescending language when gen rep 2 was literally just doing his job (aka representing the voices of all students).

Thank you in advance!"
ucla,fo8wbmj,t3_g6d5gh,1587605201.0,"Bro your stats/EC are basically identical to mine lmao. It's AWESOME that you're taking the CNA course because I think that's really what got me in (my grades weren't so hot). The hospital volunteering is also a huge plus. You have a strong application so far. If you have the chance, I would try to retake the SAT. Only if you have the means tho (esp with covid and all that).

In your personal statement, make sure to stress your clinical experience and passion (talk about your leadership!). They wanna see someone who has drive and will dedicate themselves to serving others. Talk about your background and how it shaped you as a person. You got this!!

Feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions. There are a few nursing redditors who lurk this sub so I'm sure they can help as well. Good luck, and I hope to see you here soon!!"
ucla,fo3mfql,t1_fo2y63r,1587489349.0,"I get where you're coming from, but meditation is no longer as religious as we once thought. A lot of mental health groups (that are not associated with any religion/spirituality) still advocate for meditation as stress relief. The space would be called a ""meditation space"" to allow all students to use it, but I'm assuming that it would be ""reserved"" for prayer for Muslim bruins when they need it. Allowing all students to use it justifies asking all students to pay for it."

ucla,fnu23tj,t1_fnu0qez,1587253058.0,"Yeah, so you'll start off taking the chem 14 series (don't you take the chem 20 series), the life science 7 series (general biology), the life science 30 series (it's a math series, I recommend this one over the math 31 or math 3 series), and physics 5 series (physics for life science majors). In terms of difficulty of getting them I would rank them like this:

Physics 5 series: pretty hard to get, a lot of people have to ask their friends to hold spots for them. It's not fun. You'll probably take it as a second year, but most people do so dw!

Chem 14 series: getting 14A and 14B aren't too bad, but 14C and especially 14D is much harder. 

Life science 7 series: some people take 7a as a GE so there might be some more competition for that. 

Life science 30 series: I think most first years are able to take this bc there are so many options for math classes. 

Getting classes is kind of a bitch especially if you're premed, but it always works out. Just be flexible and don't worry if you don't get the schedule you originally wanted."
ucla,fntzwzy,t1_fnrsz6v,1587251813.0,"bro not me but my roommate is a music and English double major! I think she balances it really well. She is also able to hold a part-time job, be a part of the band, and get good grades. I freaking love her"
ucla,fntzq7w,t1_fnrypw4,1587251705.0,"what's your major? It might help to go through the sub and look for anything like ""can someone hold a spot in \_\_\_\_\_ class for me?"" bc that would indicate that it's pretty popular. You don't really know what's in demand until after you get here. The ones I know of are most writing II classes, most elementary language classes (esp Spanish), Scandanavian 50 (popular GE), chem 153a (biochem), physics 5 series, and chem 14c and d are in high demand. Again, it depends on your major"
ucla,fntzbpr,t1_fntjv0m,1587251492.0,"People tend to start looking in their winter quarter first year! Labs love to recruit first years so that they can train them and keep them for all four years. If you wait, no worries! You can also try fall quarter second year because all of the graduated seniors have opened up spots.

There are plenty of opportunities, it's just a matter of you emailing a butt-ton of professors (some of my friends emailed close to 30!) and only hearing back from 3-4. It's disheartening, but you gotta persevere! It's a pretty big time commitment, almost like a part-time job except you don't get paid lmao."

ucla,fnk0kz8,t1_fnjxjms,1587011580.0,"I heard somewhere that UCLA sends the most undergrads to med school so that's fun! But I've also heard that the UCLA med school doesn't accept as many of their own students so that kind of sucks. Quick pro/con 

Pros: 

\- hospital nearby and TONS for volunteering opportunities (also lots of student orgs have shadowing programs)

\- beautiful campus, social student body, tasty food, and good vibes

\- many research opportunities! Labs recruit first-years so they can keep them for all 4 years. It's hard to land a lab at first because you have to email a lot of professors and maybe 3-4 will get back to you, but there are plenty of labs available. You just have to put in the time

\- SO MANY STUDENT ORGS!! and premed resources too! You'll find tons of students who are also interested in a cause you're passionate about 

\-the premed community is large and pretty collaborative. People are supportive and you'll find a great community

&#x200B;

Cons

\- getting into student orgs can be competitive (esp for your first year!) You have to apply and interview, and you will usually get in starting your second year. That being said, once you're in, it's a pretty good thing to have on a resume. 

\- getting classes sometimes is tricky bc there are so many fucking premeds at UCLA ( I love them all tho!! those little bastards). You'll eventually get to take the class you need, but you might have to rearrange your schedule and have plenty of backups

\- it's a little harder to connect with professors for letters of rec. You just have to attend office hours and really make the attempt to connect. You'll find profs to write LOR, but it might take a little bit more effort.

\- the quarter system can be a bitch but I personally love it. You get used to it really fast

&#x200B;

I'm a UCLA student so obv I'm gonna tell you to attend UCLA because I fucking love this school. There's something very magical about UCLA. I still get butterflies when I think about how lucky I am to attend my dream school. Go with your heart lol. Go bruins!"
ucla,fni4gqo,t1_fni3mcs,1586973816.0,"Yeah but who wouldn't want to come here? It's freaking UCLA. Black students, just like everyone else, come to college with the idea that they'll find a community. As another redditor posted, black students specifically have been exposed to more racism than other students have. I am a POC, but I don't experience anything like what black students have.

I'm NOT supporting the CUB referendum. I think it's wrong that USAC would insinuate that students are racist for not supporting the CUB referendum. It's reasonable for black students to want a resource center and for muslim students to want a private space for prayer. USAC just needs to evaluate its budget and fund those projects with the money they already have."
ucla,fni2put,t3_g1wn4g,1586972975.0,"Okay hold the fuck up, I'm against the CUB referendum too but it's not ""playing the race card"" for black students to have a black student center. I'm an asian student and I'm not moaning and groaning that I don't have an asian student center because all of UCLA is a fucking asian student center lmao

Shutting down USAC is pointless. We just want more transparency and more efficient usage of funds. We don't need funds to be used for meditation spaces (taken from the referendum doc), we want it used toward better internet or free printing or whatever. Shutting down USAC means shutting down like 70% of the student orgs and cutting funding opportunities for the remaining 30%. It would also mean getting rid of a bunch of amazing resources that you definitely use."

You could apply to work as a care partner with the UCLA hospital, but I think they work like 12 hours shifts?

I only ever lived in a classic triple so I can talk about that one lol. Classic triples have three beds, one lofted and one bunk. The lofted bed has a closet and desk under the bed (they usually take those). They also take the drawers that are under the bottom bunk person's bed. The bottom bunk person and the person above them gets the two larger closets. 

Some people also do vlogs on their youtube channels which I found useful when I was first looking around! I'm assuming you're an incoming first-year, so I wanna let you know that you won't get a deluxe unless you room with an upperclassman/live on an LLC because they're super desirable."
