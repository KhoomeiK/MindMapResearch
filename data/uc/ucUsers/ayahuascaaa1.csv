I don't think I'm cut out for sorority life, and I'm not very much of a sorority girl....hope frat boys aren't only into them lol.

I only mentioned CS because my sister thinks that's the major that guarantees jobs after college and you'd be able to make money. I'm more of a humanities person so we'll see haha."
