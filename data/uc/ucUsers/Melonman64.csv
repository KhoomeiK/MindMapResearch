wine,fmmscov,t1_fmlt0xx,1586211142.0,"The latest news from the email sent out last week by Bonny Doon Vineyard is actually that he’s going to continue on as winemaker alongside Nicole Walsh, who has been helping him make wines at Bonny Doon since 2001 (she also has her own outfit, Ser Wines, which is pretty good too). I don’t think he sold his entire stake in BDV, just a majority interest in the company. I’m also not sure he’s been squeezed out, though it would be irresponsible for me to say more since it’s secondhand information."
