movies,fpfspws,t1_fpcyxfd,1588582102.0,"I literally remember being fucking SCARED of my favorite characters dying so much that I had to sort of distance myself mentally from all of them. This was about season 5 or so. Once they got to season 7 I almost couldn't believe my eyes at what people were doing to get out of dying. It was unbelievable they had let Arya cheat death even in Season 6 but everything else was very good so I let it pass.

But honestly let me tell you something that you might hate at first but hear me out

I honestly thought Dany and Jaime should have died right there on the field of fire (season 7 episode 4) with him stabbing her at the end of the charge and Drogon then burning Jaime to a crisp. (I should have you know Jaime is my favorite character so I don't sacrifice him lightly and it is purely for the betterment of the story) 

This moment would be the epitome of shocking and would also help serve to move the plot meaningfully along. It would leave the question of why follow Dany this whole time? Well it would be the same reason we followed Ned, Robb, Tywin, etc. to their subsequent deaths - a character suffering the consequences of their mistakes (in this case, ignoring her advisors and being too rash - something Dany has shown before). It leaves the moment of 'now what?' which we experienced all too often in the earlier seasons but not at all in the later ones. Dany wouldn't be completely useless - her role of bringing the dragons to Westeros would play a role in the battle against the white walkers and/or allow Jon to dispose Cersei (or whatever story you want to write for them, maybe Bran wargs one idk). Jaime would be now known as a Queenslayer and his legacy burned in history as a hero. Cersei goes crazy, etc. etc.

It just makes for a far more unpredictable, yet sensible, plot that truly reflects characters being punished for their decisions as was built up for the entire series. Even if you didn't like my storyline, substitute Jon or Cersei or Bran and you start getting back to what made GOT great"

I am contradicting this by saying, likely no, there won't be a drop that far because of how wealth has become generational in these parts of OC, with parents often selling homes and moving out of state (giving cash difference to children for downpayment on home), assisting with down payment outright, or paying for a college education that allows children to accumulate amount of money for downpayment. This isn't even considering the high demand for the location outside of people that already live here. If it did occur, as you've stated, a drop of that magnitude is going to take half a year at the very least to become apparent.

This is all considering 600k is affordable, which for the average Californian is definitely not the truth"

>A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell

>All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’ mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.	

>A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices—voices of men, women, and children—resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine."

BSG was incredibly liberal for its time - in the immediate post 9/11 patriotism fever was running high and the fact that BSG was willing to 

-make a male character female AND retain the negative traditionally 'masculine' traits

-create essentially a society that treats men and women as full equals

-show suicide bombings as a 'good thing' or rather, something that would be useful to characters we know and love

-pass commentary on torture, hive mind of the group, etc.

-create an allegory out of the cylons; treating those who we don't think to be human and that have wronged us - I mean come on does no one see the parallels?

The idea that BSG wasn't a part of the trend you say you hate is somewhat ironic considering it did exactly that in its time period - it just did it incredibly well. It did not escape criticism of the time either. There ARE shows out there today that do this well - Southland, Black Sails, Halt and Catch Fire, and even RDM's other show For All Mankind - they are just admittedly rare. For every one of these shows there are 20 other pieces of schlock that lack subtlety. For some genre's this is fine, for sci-fi it is *incredibly* difficult to walk the line of overdoing it as most sci fi is SUPPOSED to be social commentary to a degree.

HBO was the distributor of GOT but they were not in charge of the storytelling. That was the sole job of the writers, David Benioff and Dan Weiss, who effectively owned the whole operation as showrunners (i.e. it was written in their contract that they had full creative control). HBO was very open about their desire to have as many seasons as the showrunners wanted to tell the story, and they were willing to throw as much money at the show that was required to make that happen. GOT was a giant cash cow for the network, accounting for a large percentage of its subscriptions, and it was most definitely in their best interest to not limit the show in any way.

A result of this was that when David and Dan said they only wanted 1 more season at the end of season 6, HBO - who wanted 3-4 more seasons - negotiated them to meet in the middle at 2 more seasons of half length.

With the showrunners having complete control of the process, it is important to know that NO ONE had any idea of the content of the scripts until the scripts were completely finished. Only Bryan Cogman (another writer for a single episode), David, and Dan knew what were in the scripts. Unlike in other shows where you often get showrunners, writers, and producers spit-balling ideas amongst each other - HBO was essentially a dictatorship when it came to writing. No one knew the outcomes of the scripts until it came out onto their table, and there was no editing them (save for deleting or shifting scenes for production/editing reasons).

In essence, the leaks were most definitely not actual plans, as none of the 4chan leaks were able to account for any significant portion of the final script. It would have either been correct (at worse missing portions) or completely wrong."

Coronavirus,fouzv71,t1_fouysxm,1588093097.0,"Its about 100mg per day, or about 2/3rds of a bag of lays potato chips - extra salt intake can also be mediated by heavier water consumption. You'd have to check your dog food and account for that if you feed them anything extra. And if you are exercising your dog they will need more than the daily amount. But it's not inherently toxic to them compared to garlic or chocolate"

funny,fortnu1,t1_foqw5fm,1588018318.0,we use it in organic chemistry lab in certain tests - namely for nmr spectroscopy because it gives a reliably reference to compare to
Games,fopxfrz,t1_fopvmiy,1587975410.0,You are arguing against your own point though. That reasoning gives even more legitimacy to why and how someone would be tracking them down. For all we know the person  could be the very last of that Firefly group (who's motivations were as you've stated)
Games,fopv81h,t1_fopuu0c,1587973243.0,"Joel definitely didn't kill everyone in the compound trying to get Ellie out. The assisting physicians or nurses helping with the procedure (that Joel didn't kill) could have known who he was and then that's how the person found out.

I don't know how they found Joel - if the game does its job well it will explain that or give reasonable cause. 

But again, we haven't played it so we don't know"

Games,fopunxg,t1_fopugu9,1587972709.0,"You haven't even seen the game. You've read some plot points on the internet and then have seen a scene that shows AFTER Joel has already been captured.

They could have laid a trap, surprised him, or overwhelmed him - all of these would be realistic things to happen within the story. And you won't know what happened to him until you play it (assuming no more leaks). If it is stupid ill be the first one to grab the pitchfork with you"
Games,fopu93q,t1_fopqwlx,1587972319.0,"The last jedi is such shit though - the plot isn't logical at all and characters have terrible motivations. From what I'm seeing part 2 seems to all have characters with realistic motivations, it's just that the premise itself of the story is what is setting people off"
