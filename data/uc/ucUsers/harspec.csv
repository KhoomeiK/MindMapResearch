ucla,fowrbgq,t3_ga0j8c,1588125493.0,This is such a nice polite way of beating around the bush/saying lol there is big ass chance it’s gonna be online for the majority of students so don’t cry like a bitch but suck it up. And most students if given the opportunity are not gonna waste money on housing and obviously do the remote shit. Like cmon I ain’t commuting or living at UCLA just to enjoy 14CL in person.
ucla,foltui8,t1_folszk2,1587870340.0,Fuck the entire department. June Kuoch gosh if you had him as a TA for Asian Am 40 smh
ucla,fngac7u,t3_g1kaqp,1586926370.0,It’s the biggest joke ever. We literally get the data from the Ta’s. Labs are only 20 minutes. My TA just made it a social it’s super easy.
ucla,fl2y5ia,t3_fm7w6z,1584763056.0,"Bruh I live in Irvine and I’m back home now and man just don’t even do UCI. You will bust your balls, brain, everything, and still be bored here. And UCLA CS is UCLA lol cannot even be compared to UCI. Wanna be on a big ass campus formed like a circle no right? You would rather be in a beautiful campus with beautiful weather and people."
