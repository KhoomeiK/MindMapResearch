UCSD,fnwnwz6,t3_g3xpkk,1587322003.0,"Sorry to hear you can’t go back home. I can relate to the feeling of being depressed, it’s a less than ideal situation for most of us in some way. 
Scheduled zoom hangouts with my friends and regular exercise has been keeping me going. Sometimes I force myself to go outside even if I don’t feel like it. It helps to have something to look forward to throughout the week. Hope things start to look up, friend!"
