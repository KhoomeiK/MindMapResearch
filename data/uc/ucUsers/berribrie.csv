Because our 3 quarter production series (from what I've heard) is not great and you end up self-teaching more than the professor actually teaches. Most of the Film and Media studies program here has an emphasis on the studies aspect rather than production/screenwriting/etc. However, this is coming from someone who only minors in FMS, so I'm not required to take any courses related to production. You probably won't get too much feedback from FMS majors on this subreddit though. 

If you're looking for film production/directing, you might want to look at a program like CSU Northridge, Chapman, etc."

This is similar (but not quite as difficult) between UCs. People do transfer within the UC system and between CSUs and UCs but it's just a lot easier to transfer from a CC to a UC.

* Film and Media Studies (FMS) 85A: It's really cool class, you watch a film every week and learn about cinematography. There's usually 2 short ""essay"" projects (only 3-5 paragraphs) and 1 midterm + final (both have MC, short answer, 5 paragraph essay). I loved it so much I picked up a FMS minor after taking it (I'm a software engineering and business double major, so it's kinda of out my normal zone)
* English 10: Young Adult Fiction, you have to read a 1-2 YA novels for this class so I'd avoid this if you absolutely hate reading. The novels are usually pretty fun though and I've never had a bad experience with any of the English professors at this school.
* English 11: First Amendment Law and Literature, this class can be a little daunting because of the topic but the professor that teaches it (Brad Queen) is absolutely the most supportive and genuine professor I've ever had here. It's a rewarding experience because your greatly improve your analysis and argumentation skills in this class. There's 2 group essays, 1 final essay, and 1 8000 word journal (sounds daunting but it's graded on word count not quality of writing). You learn about current court cases, how to navigate legal journals/amicus curiae briefs, and your really broaden your understanding of the US Constitution (the First Amendment at least). I absolutely recommend this class and Professor Queen to anyone who even has the slightest curiosity about First Amendment topics (which are surprisingly broad covering topics like compelled speech, commercial speech, reproductive rights, etc).
* I'm not sure if it fulfills a GE but Drama 30A is an intro acting class taught by really great grad students in Claire Trevor. It's a great way to kinda ""break out"" of an introverted shell because the class <= 18 people and it's a super supportive environment. I would only recommend this if you're willing to go to an 8 AM twice a week because attendance is mandatory (skip 6 times and you've already failed the class)

Edit: As you can see, I have a little bias towards English classes. I know a lot of STEM majors don't share the same sentiment though because you write essays for these classes, so these are less essay-intensive courses:

* Classes I've never taken but heard are easy: Art 9A, any non-dance major Dance class, Philosophy 1"

It's way more feasible to transfer from a CC-->UC than a UC-->UC because UCs have to meet X quota of transfer acceptances per year from CCs. Usually it's not recommended to commit to a UC knowing you want to transfer to a different one.

There's also no guarantee that certain courses you take at UCR/UCSC will articulate to another UC which not only wastes your time but your money. 

While some CC courses won't articulate to a certain UC,  it still a cheaper option because I believe CC's are now tuition free for first-time students for two years."

But there's no predicting what's going to happen 5 months from now. 

I'd imagine the university is preparing for that scenario because it's better to plan for this farther in advance and not need it rather than scrambling last minute. But in the scenario that we have in-person fall (to any capacity), it makes me curious how dorming in the towers would work and if that housing option will be more limited than usual to keep up with social distancing precautions."
UCI,fo1w5xs,t3_g54wbg,1587442878.0,"You should try asking on the UCI FADA or class pages on Facebook. You probably won't be getting too many film and media majors replying here. 

I'm doing a minor in Film and Media studies but from my classmates our FMS program leans more towards the media STUDIES aspect than the actual production/editting/directing aspects. We have a 3 quarter production series, but I've heard the professors aren't the greatest and you have to self-teach alot. There's some screenwriting classes that are kind of in the same boat as the production series. We have a 2 yr long DigiFilm minor here too which is really cool (you have to apply for it though and they only take ~15 people a quarter). Check out UCI's catalogue of FMS major requirements to see the classes you'd be taking and if you're interested in them. Most of the classes are about the study of film rather than learning how to make it yourself if you get what I mean. 

Don't get me wrong, I love the subject thus the minor, but if you're really interested in directing/production/the actual making of a film you're probably better off at a school like CSU Northridge, Chapman, USC, etc You'll have better access to the resources you need plus it'll probably be easier to get actors/actresses for short film projects at places like Northridge."

It's much less stressful not having to constantly worry about money. Even if you're working a truly part-time job ( <= 20 hrs/wk), you'll probably still have money to spare after school/transportation expenses. 

You can spend more time exploring CS and doing side projects. Usually your classes at a CC are smaller too so you get more interaction with your professors (if that's something you're into) because our lower div ICS classes are usually 120-400 people/lecture. Just do well at CC and you should be able to transfer (and remember to get your IGETC to get out of GEs). You got into UCI once, you can definitely do it again. I had a friend who originally got into UCI for CS but decided to go to CC to save on money and now he's at Berkeley. There's times I wished I went to a CC first because I basically wasted a year of tuition here in a major I didn't like before switching to swe. 

You also mentioned that you got in SJSU (beautiful campus btw). UCI, SJSU, or CC are all equally viable options. Basically, just try to think out your finances/housing situation plus what you want out of college (academically, professionally, socially, etc).

Anteaters United (AU) is NOT Friends of Petr rebranded. No one on this slate has been recalled nor impeached. They are fierce and vocal ADVOCATES for the Womxn's Hub as you can [see here](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=624882361426574&id=100017144461737). One of the candidates on this slate represents the Womxn's Hub referenda and spoke on the referenda at the Senate Townhall during Week 2.  The senators that are rerunning on this slate opposed many of the ""controversial"" legislations proposed and passed by the current Senate.

The impeached president is running on the slate Re-Ignite, but the ""validity"" of the evidence for his impeachment is a subject of debate. I will not go into this because I don't have straight facts about it.

Fund the Clubs (FTC) and Anteaters for Anteaters (A4A, do not mistake this with AU) are basically, Friends of Petr rebranded. While the candidates on A4A never held ASUCI positions, their slate branched off of FTC before the deadline to create a slate. In the A4A presidential candidate's statement found here: [elections.uci.edu](https://elections.uci.edu), he explicitly says:

>Myself and my slate, **Fund The Clubs**, intends on giving these clubs and organizations the funding they need and deserve.

A4A is basically the same slate as FTC but for the executive positions (president and vice presidents) while FTC is for Senate seats. This is likely a method for the slate to increase their chances of getting voted for because it sounds similar to AU and to distance themselves from FTC which is trying to do damage control on their platform. Both of these slates are trying to push for the Constitution and cover it up with the $750K to clubs (which isn't entirely true you can see [this post for a breakdown on where this $750K comes from and where it's really going](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/g10n5k/vote_no_on_the_asuci_constitution/)).

Basically, I just don't think it's conducive to just shoot down input from an individual because of their political association without giving them adequate opportunity to articulate their reasoning. The late Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, the conservative and liberal champions of their generation, opposed each other greatly politically but were great friends outside of court. Justice Ginsburg said that this mutual respect with Scalia brought about an improvement in their civil intellectual debate. That being said, this isn't something I could say about the conduct of ASUCI recently.

This is student government, it's not running the country. Here is where it'd ideally be easier for people to engage in civil discourse and learn how to make compromises with each other. For example, the Senate should be discussing bills with each other more and be more open to additional discussion/revisions rather than hastily pushing unpolished governing documents. Another example is that there should be more compromise and collaborative effort between the branches of ASUCI to actually try to communicate with each other than trying to constantly pull the rug out from each other's feet. But then school politics is still politics so it'll just be a mess regardless. 

As for the ""line"", I have no tolerance for racial or gender-based bigotry, but I think I'll abstain from further trying to address where I draw a fine line because it's situational and well it would be a long-winded discussion that I don't think will be relevant to ASUCI elections.

>Sixty (60) percent to be **allocated to schools**, proportionally, by number of undergraduate students. School administrations shall allocate funds to respective school-affiliated Registered Campus Organizations

This is a huge inequity for smaller schools that could potentially be splitting funds of something like $1000 between multiple clubs. It will also be on the school admins to allocate those funds to students which is largely flawed because we want it going straight to student orgs (of course with a measure of accountability on how they will spend it). The proposed Constitution also only gives 40% to non-school affiliated orgs, but the number of non-school affiliated orgs outnumbers those affiliated with schools.

>Forty (40) percent to be allocated to non-school affiliated Registered Campus Organizations through the Executive, and as indicated in the Bylaws

For example, ICS only has 6 school-affiliated student orgs: ACM, Hack, ICSSC, MAISS, VGDC, and WICS. But there are so many more student orgs that also fall under the topic of ICS but are not school-affiliated such as AI, Applied ML, Blockchain, Cyber, DSC, and the list goes on. Dozens of ICS related student orgs will not be eligible to receive these funds via the school of ICS. 

This scenario will also be reflected in each of the other academic schools as well. Hundreds of student orgs will be splitting that 40% leaving many small/growing orgs with very little to no financial support.

The fact that this document will make SAG and appointed position is suspicious because SAG is supposed to be an IMPARTIAL and 3rd party entity with investigative authority.

X Sec. 2 ""*Authority and Powers*"" Subsection (l) ""\[The Elections Commissioner has the power\] *to call, and set dates for, special elections, subject to approval by the Senate.*"" Based on the previous. the Senate must pass legislation approving the dates and times for when I call for a Special Recall Election. As stated, I was in agreement students and made the recommendation that the Special Recall Election should take place concurrent with the ASUCI Spring 2020 Elections, and that is what was proposed in the [legislation](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/legislation/print/?legislation_number=R55-54). Until the Senate passes such legislation, I cannot begin the Special Recall Election and allow the undergraduate student body to vote on whether or not they would like to recall and replace those specific Senators. I am waiting for the Senate to allow the process to be completed, and once this is passed with a timeline, I will communicate the information for the Special Recall Election to the student body. 

In regards to your first and third points, this kinda says otherwise. Compliments of the Elections Commissioner"
UCI,fmy25nv,t3_fx2g0w,1586476527.0,"If you're interested in technology and business, you can consider switching into Business Information Management (BIM). It's a lot easier to get into than Bus Admin, but you take a lot of the same management classes in addition to some programming classes. I didn't have a hard time adding BIM onto my current major quite recently. This might be something you want to look into more if you want to explore the possibility. 

Check the UCI websites for the respective majors you're considering ([Paul Merage](https://merage.uci.edu/programs/undergraduate/index.html) and [social sciences](https://www.economics.uci.edu/undergrad/major/business.php)). But also look at this catalogue for classes these majors take and see what you want to take: [Bus Admin](http://catalogue.uci.edu/thepaulmerageschoolofbusiness/undergraduateprograms/#majorstext)  ,   [Bus Econ](http://catalogue.uci.edu/schoolofsocialsciences/departmentofeconomics/#majorstext)  ,  [BIM](http://catalogue.uci.edu/interdisciplinarystudies/businessinformationmanagement/)

And if you search this subreddit , there's a lot of posts comparing bus admin and bus econ. I considered adding bus econ to my swe major at first, but I ended up adding BIM instead because it catered more to my interests in management and I ended up not liking econ that much."
