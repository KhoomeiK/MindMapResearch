That being said, you can choose which Subreddit's to follow. I avoid a lot of world news and politics which I substitute with video game development and pictures of corgis."

You're not crazy, informed delivery stopped working for me a week or so ago, I've made 9 ebay purchases in the past two weeks, only 3 of them showed up in informed delivery.

With the packages that are missing. On Ebay I could click the tracking number from the order, and the package's tracking looks normal, picked up/scanned in/departed/out for delivery/delivered. as of today I've received all 9 packages those 6 were never acknowledged, same name/address info, even the same postage (Priority 2 day).

This hasn't really happened before, the occasional delay from label printed to magically teleportation across the country 3 days later, but at the very least those packages still showed up.

I also work in fulfillment for an online clothing retailer, I've noticed the that the tracking doesn't update in my goshippo interface, but if I manually go to the tracking number it'll show the updates.

So possibly some issue with the API integration? (I don't know if I'm using that correctly) So why the fuck won't their own first party tracking shit work.

It's frustrating because I may or may not have ordered some ""Dietary Supplements"" in the form of a strong prescription stimulant via discreet darknet marketplace at a high price.

So now I have no idea where the fuck my drugs are, whether or not they were actually sent, ect."

Aside from the toothbrush, toothpaste, and tampons nothing in these pictures are necessary for survival. Moisturizer might be the only one that comes close. My girlfriend gave up all the girly hair care products and went hard into video games/PC upgrades. 

Which poses the question. out of your essentials if you had to pick only one. food, clothing, and shelter already covered. Do you go with...

\-Toothbrush and Toothpaste (I know that's two things)

\-Tampons

\-or hair care products

less severe is the key phrase here.

What exactly is your argument? 

At the end of the day what the judge rules is what becomes the reality. No matter how much you disagree with it, no matter how much data and research you compile, no matter how right/wrong it is.

However, at this point I feel like we might be arguing about different points of the issue. 

And I apologize for calling you a crazy person, you've come to this dispute making an effort to educate me and I've rewarded you with name calling which is very low of me."
CoronavirusUS,fneq53q,t1_fne8les,1586893860.0,"Oh you're a crazy person. There's no way to have a proper discussion if you live in a world where you can't listen to reason.

Are you suggesting that people actively working in the medical field are not being exposed to the virus?

Somehow their professional medical education makes them immune to the coronavirus?

You're arguing about the wrong thing, I agree that it sucks the father is taking advantage of the situation, its a cheap move. However logic is in his favor."
CoronavirusUS,fncdn1n,t1_fnbmo04,1586834228.0,"Again, emotional. The fact is the father is offering to take his child to a safer environment.

Forcibly relocated? The kids not being sent to a concentration camp. If the parent operates on the logic of ""I want custody of my children I don't care if they are at risk"" then that parent shouldn't have custody of their child."
CoronavirusUS,fnb7te1,t1_fnaqq3k,1586810728.0,"100% Yes

All **PARENTS** exposed to a deadly virus on a daily basis should distance themselves from their children in any way possible. 

You're about to begin an emotionally fueled argument that prioritizes the **mother's feelings** over the **safety of her child**. Let the dad put his time in."

LosAngeles,fn84imu,t1_fn81a3w,1586733733.0,"I think what they are grossed out by is that **Person A** used a clean Clorox wipe to open the handle, then just left it there. So **Person B** has to come along, touch the germ infested Clorox wipe (That they have no idea what else it could have been used on) THEN dispose of it. So **Person A** is littering, exposing other people to their germs, all because they can't be bothered to throw it away themselves. 

Originally this picture didn't bother me as much, but typing all this out made me think about it more in depth, as a result I have a much stronger dislike for **Person A.**"
