Try this maybe?"
UCSD,fpa96e9,t3_gcaa40,1588443353.0,You're worrying too much. Remember everyone have their different comfort but if you're willing to take 8 units youre most likely fine. They're not too much harder than if you take it in the fall. You just show up to class more times a week.
sandiego,fp7cmu4,t1_fp79whw,1588368120.0,Oh no definitely. I manage a small store as well and I enforce the mask policy because I believe it is important. OP may be right but it doesnt make him any less of a prick.
sandiego,fp767k1,t1_fp71vqw,1588364790.0,Yes you are better than most people. Congrats
UCSD,fp4z3p8,t1_fp3h9ae,1588311309.0,Shhhhhh keep it down. Mathmaticians be lurking.
UCSD,fp31852,t1_fp13xkk,1588271352.0,Online lab is a waste of time honestly. The professor uploads the lab you can do at home. Every lab session i do is just people sitting there quietly doing their lab. No communication nothing.
EngineeringStudents,fohsfkc,t3_g7j9iv,1587771748.0,I've taken thermal and fluids in 5 wks together and vibrations the next five (my school has 2 summer sessions) and it was pretty doable. It really dependa on the rigor and how much time youre gonna devote to it.
EngineeringStudents,fo09y9n,t3_g4yj4y,1587408698.0,If youre gonna go through all this effort just study. But just post it via picture with no text so its near impossible to search up the question or tweak the wording. Or again have some integrity and take your test without chegg.
HongKong,fnr75v2,t1_fnr6j8c,1587180972.0,"You cant convince him. He's past the cutoff age for being ""open minded"", its a human psychology thing. Better to just be ok with his belief and not argue."
sandiego,fnqovxa,t1_fnqgf96,1587169013.0,Even if its not banned it doesnt seem like anyone is planning on getting a hitel or bnb anytime soon.
sandiego,fnjohiz,t1_fnjnrhx,1587003352.0,Thats smart didnt think about it that. I do hope you feel better. Feel free to PM me if you ever need to vent.
sandiego,fnjnd53,t1_fnjmzl1,1587002639.0,Not trying to offend you but have you been outside? Vitamin D helps a lot with depressing thoughts. Im not saying to wander the street but sitting in an isolated area in the sun might help.
sandiego,fnjmolp,t1_fnjky1b,1587002212.0,I dont think anything you do is gonna stop them. I dont think nonemergency number is going to do anything. The only thing you can really do is stay isolated from it. If it makes you feel any better the chance of anyone catching it from this small party is rather small.
sandiego,fn0pp5x,t1_fn0p6i5,1586546388.0,That sucks. Is it even legal to force you to give up your lunch break? Not that it seems to matter to them. If youre worried you should call out sick. Cant force you to go in if you were i think.
aerospace,fn0ou6p,t3_fym1vt,1586545923.0,The equation youre using is specifically for a pipe which is different from an airfoil. You need to use the one created for airfoils.
sandiego,fn0o0h1,t3_fym2we,1586545478.0,Im not going to car washes and i dont know why people would with all the rain but do you work at one of those automatic car washes? If so at least you dont actually come into contact with people other than your coworkers. Also is your job forcing you to go in? My place is only doing shifts based on a voluntary bases so that people can still earn money if they need to.
sandiego,fmyihj4,t3_fy65xe,1586486968.0,Depends on if you can prove it. Judging by crash alone youre at fault
mazda3,fmyi6v0,t1_fmyc9rt,1586486766.0,"if you can afford it, going for some nice headlights would be sick. If you're handy with diy when you take is apart to clean you can add angel/devil eyes inside.   A lot cheaper than buying premade ones. Sometimes a clean and detailing can make something look a hell of a lot better so thats always an option. By the way if you're gonna check out carid avoid the brand truparts. Their parts dont fit."
mazda3,fmy31qb,t3_fy2z4x,1586477059.0,Are you sure the scratches are inside and not outside the headights? If its scratches you can buff it out. Also is it fog or junk inside? I cant really tell from the picture but if it fogs up you just have a leak that you can fill with water proof sealant after you use a hair dryer to dry the inside. Else you can use some heat and remove the lens to clean the inside than put it back on with some epoxy and sealant.
UCSD,fmu0cs0,t1_fmtyljx,1586382238.0,Have you voiced your concerns to the professor about privacy? Proctoring seems to fall under the professors discretion. I doubt there is a department for exams proctorimg as its a new issue. You can contact the department in charge of the class but i strongly recommend you talk to the professor first. Going past the professor before thoroughly discussing it would put unfair stress on him or her who is also new to this system and is just trying to make the exam fair to everyone.
sandiego,fmtvzhd,t3_fxcvrl,1586379976.0,Get some arizonas. Do a switcharoo. And dont get to wasted.
UCSD,fmtv3m0,t3_fxc6mb,1586379528.0,I'll sell you a roll for $100
UCSD,fmtuw1d,t1_fmts0jg,1586379424.0,Honestly. Is there a way to send meeting creations to spam?
UCSD,fmtujps,t3_fxe4ju,1586379254.0,"Unpopular opinion but other than technology issues i dont think making students uncomfortable is anot a valid reason not to use video proctoring. Its a way to keep students honest about there exams and the truth is lots of students will take advantage of the system. If youre professor is monitoring you via video you should just suck it up. Yes it feels weird at first but you will get use to it. Its no diffeent than having a TA stare at you during exams. Of course if you have a nedical issue with it then it should fall under students with disability accomadations. Issues like getting disconnected is something professors most likely expect and if you dont have the technology to do it such as a webcam (which is all you really need, you could also download zoom on you phone and use it as a webcam) you should contact the professor and try to come to some sort of agreement."
EngineeringStudents,fmgm32d,t3_fv1qwt,1586052042.0,My school records all lectures so i dont have to follow the schedule. Saves me 3 hours of commuting a day. I can focus on 1 task at a time instead having to run to class in the middle of an assignment.
