Cuz you'd have to be pretty fucking stupid to think this isn't a copypasta right off the bat lol"
ucla,fpff54l,t1_fpff3vs,1588569425.0,And?

P.s. I canâ€™t wait to spend the $45 I saved on things I actually want to spend them on. Might buy a new yo yo ðŸ˜Ž ðŸª€"
ucla,fn22t0d,t1_fn1yr9h,1586576343.0,"> Look at comment vote totals and number of comments. It's way above average.

That's because it's such a heated, trending and contested topic. People salivate at drama, and it naturally draws more users to engage with posts. Average comments per thread are otherwise skewed downwards because most threads on any given day are, ""Hey those who took CS 35L, how's so and so TA?"" and naturally don't lend themselves to big threads or comment totals.

I remember the last time there was a USAC uprising on this sub, it was a couple of years ago, and the sub saw a spike in activity because people were opinionated on the topic. It's not out of the realm of possibility that the activity came from outside the sub. But I think it's more probable the topic itself piqued more interest and engendered more engagement from within the existing userbase. 

> That means a significant number of comments are coming from other subreddits or more likely, other platforms like Facebook groups. If any pro-USAC shills or brigades exist its obviously nothing compared to the opposite.

Not necessarily. I think the community here is large enough, 25k subcribers, to draw out users who normally lurk to post, given the trending topic. Again, a high trending and interesting topic, especially one where the entire community is insulted, will induce more activity on any subreddit. 

> Personally I am grateful for all of the students appreciating ridiculous levels of taxation and the worthlessness of self propagating bureaucracy, most of which exists to perpetuate itself. Next lesson some never seem to learn: municipal, state and federal government also operates this way at much larger scales.

Haha, I agree!!"
ucla,fn1wd28,t1_fn1w2iy,1586571697.0,That's not true. Ever since the COVID pandemic started there's been way more activity here.
