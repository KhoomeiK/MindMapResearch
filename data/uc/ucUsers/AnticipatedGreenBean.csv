It is true like you say that most of greek life doesn't have a mindset similar ours, and I knew that going into it haha. At the end of the day though dude, just do you. Whether it's going out every night or vibing on discord with your squad, so long as you're having fun and not hurting anyone, no one should really tell you how you spend your free time IMO"

Currently running for Social Sciences Senator for Step Up, so if I lose a vote that sucks, but ah well haha :) (Benjamin Amaya)

I understand your concern with Greek Life, and the potential issues that come from it, but not everyone who is apart of it has the stereotypical mindset of a ""frat bro"" or ""sorority sis"". I'm part of Phi Alpha Delta, the Pre-Law Fraternity for UCI, and it's IMO far from a stereotypical frat (we're labeled as a professional fraternity tbf, but we're still apart of Greek Life). Truth be told though I just joined wanting to meet new people, and to dive deeper into different aspects of law, and see if becoming an attorney was something I wanted to really pursue (long story short...it wasn't) 

However, I still associate with the fraternity constantly, as they are all good influences on me (whether socially or professionally) and it's a really fun experience. I'm far from someone who would be labeled as a party person. I like staying inside and playing video games a lot more (Smash Bros, ACNH, RoR2 and SMITE are my main games with my friends rn) and personally hate alcohol/any form of drugs now (I grew out of it), yet PAD still accepts me for who I am. Obviously you'll have your groups of friends you're more comfortable with, but that just comes with everything that has large groups of people. There's been controversial issues with Greek Life in the past, not just for UCI, but with it as a whole, and that isn't something I would say I support, but Greek Life is far from the stereotypes you (and I at one point) thought of them to be. 

Granted I may not be someone you're talking about, being as how you seem to be talking about more of the social greek houses, but I hope this still gives a little insight :)

Also in terms of funding for parties, I'm not sure where you're getting that info from. Trust, our dues prices for PAD really reflect it haha ($50 a quarter)"
