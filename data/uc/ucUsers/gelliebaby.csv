edit: As a senior Bio major, who finished my courses fast enough to have graduated two quarters ago, I can firmly assure you that you do not need to move this fast. I don’t know if you’re behind, if you switched in to the major late, or if you need to graduate early to save money. But if none of that applies to you, please take your time. Cramming classes is not good for your health and it will wreck your gpa in the long run."
UCSantaBarbara,fo8phd0,t1_fo7cs7t,1587601186.0,"Non-transfer here. I think academic life is just as competitive here as it is at any other UC. I have friends at UC Berkeley who literally have to apply to be accepted into recreational clubs. I think the UC system in general is just very overloaded, a lot of students and not enough resources."
UCSantaBarbara,fni6njc,t1_fnhsqp4,1586974881.0,"The basic answer is that is seems as though professors are assuming that we have more time on our hands because of the lock down. But I would like to share some other observations I’ve made.

For one, a lot of the work that is usually done in class or in section, is now expected to be completed on your own time. For example, quizzes and homework that are usually given in section are now taken online on your own time, but that doesn’t shorten the amount of time spent in section. In two of my classes, we are expected to watch the lecture on our own, and then use ZOOM as a second lecture.

Second, a lot of professors are not sticking to the time limit. I have lectures that are supposed to be only 50 minutes that are now consistently well over an hour long and in the long term this adds up. This is especially prevalent in prerecorded classes. In addition, think teachers assume we don’t have to travel to our next class so they have more time. Also, in a physical class people usually start to pack up at the end of class which is an auditory cue to professors that they have to wrap up.

Third, I think some teachers are assigning more homework/quizzes/participation points because they want to give exams less weight. Rather than change to class to p/np, they just try to make it easier to get good grades. However, rather than just redistributing the percentage, they also add more assignments.

Lastly, and maybe I’m the only one who thinks this...I think teachers have become even more obsessed and paranoid about their classes because they have nothing else to focus on. Even under normal circumstances, lot of professors tend to over-assign work because they forget that students have other classes. Professors usually only teach one or two classes a quarter but they spend a lot of time on research (I’m a STEM major idk I what humanities professors do). But now, labs and research programs are shut down and they spend even more of their time thinking about their classes.

All speculation of course. I’m not a professor so what do I know."

I was thinking about waiting a couple months for things to settle before asking this question, because I see how it must feel for the Asian minority to always be minimized or compared to other minorities even in the face of something that clearly has a larger effect on Asians."
