berkeley,fogebxx,t3_g749mo,1587751489.0,"What exactly is the fear that you have? 

I found the communal restrooms (I lived in Clark Kerr) to be just fine - it's a bit awkward at first to shuttle your shower things around, but there's plenty of privacy, and they get cleaned very frequently. Using the restroom in the middle of the night is no more of a challenge than using the restroom in your own home - you just need to remember your key (or else wake up some disgruntled roommates to let you back in). 

If you're living in a triple, you'll still be sharing the restroom with other people - and it's a toss up whether they're that clean. Like the other commenter mentioned, those in-suite restrooms are cleaned less frequently."

I have that same pokemon fabric and it's lived many lives - chalk bags, dice bags, bandanas, I thought about making a pillow case out of it but realized I'm an adult and probably shouldn't..."

berkeley,fmssldg,t1_fms32pz,1586361347.0,"no? why? 

if you're talking about the recommendation for every individual to wear a face covering while out, the preference is for the general public to still use something else - like making a mask out of a t-shirt - instead of a medical mask."
berkeley,fmm5lzt,t3_fw27j8,1586199218.0,"you can't control what other people do, unfortunately. what you can do is send them a bunch of articles that talk about the young people that die from 'rona. sometimes, it gets through to them that just because they're in their early 20's they're not indestructible. a 16 year old girl in Italy died from this virus a couple weeks ago, no preexisting health conditions."
