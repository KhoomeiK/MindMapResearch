berkeley,fopdu8o,t1_fop81fu,1587958992.0,I really appreciate the gesture. I'll definitely consider it.
berkeley,fop5hc5,t1_fop4i96,1587953511.0,"Inspiring words, thank you"
berkeley,fop44xx,t1_fop3ok4,1587952665.0,"Not really. Our timeline is kind of until tomorrow night. We're waiting to see if we get approved for a financial assistance program right now, and if it doesn't happen, we'll take her to our local vet tomorrow when they open and see if that price is manageable. If it isn't, we'll need to put her down."
berkeley,fop1qlj,t1_fop1cb0,1587951160.0,None that are open right now unfortunately. We brought her to an emergency clinic 30 minutes away after trying three get clinics in town that were all either closed or their emergency hours had been cut back because of the pandemic. The worst part is the time it took us to get to the emergency clinic is the reason she needs the surgery that we can't afford.
berkeley,fop0nhe,t1_fop08pg,1587950481.0,"Wow that seems like an amazing place. I'm back home a couple hours from the Bay Area, so that isn't an option but wow, thank you for your suggestion, I really appreciate it."
berkeley,foouq7s,t1_fooudwq,1587946873.0,"Fuck, I'm sorry. That's really shitty. It's nice to know we aren't alone though. We are trying to get financial aid with this stuff, but right now, nothing is clear. Thanks for your well wishes."
berkeley,foouhfp,t1_footyqa,1587946724.0,"We applied for care credit, but even if we get approved, we have no realistic means of getting it paid off since we don't have any disposable income pretty much at all as a family right now. Thank you for the advice and the love."
berkeley,foorbfw,t1_foopkv7,1587944806.0,"I appreciate the well wishes. We're figuring out what all we can do about this, but right now we're fighting against time and nothing seems to be a fast enough solution."
berkeley,foor4sy,t1_fooqqfw,1587944695.0,"I might do this, thank you."

hearthstone,fmuvytz,t1_fmuvnjp,1586400102.0,"HAHAHAHA yup, that's demon hunter! The deck is really good but will hopefully slow down with the nerfs.
To get to casual
 If you're on mobile, there's a ""casual"" button above the hero portrait when you're about to queue for a match to the left of the ranked symbol. Click that and you're good to go"
hearthstone,fmuvgax,t3_fxk56c,1586399777.0,"Yeah the game is crazy unstable right now, a new class just got released that's way too good, blizzard just nerfed them so it should be a little better but still could be hard, we just have to see if the nerfs were effective.

In addition, there was just a complete overhaul of the ranked system, and everyone started at bronze 10, so there may be people that are very good and experienced at the same ranking as you. This will even out relatively soon.

You've joined at a very turbulent time, but please don't let that deter you from playing and having fun!!

Aside from that, expect to have a hard time winning against well-constructed decks for a little bit if you're playing things like river crocolisk or chillwind yeti. It does take a little while to build up a collection, but it's definitely worth it!!! Keep at it, and I'd recommend checking out the tavern brawls and casual mode if you find yourself getting frustrated by ranked :)"
berkeley,fkbcn8l,t1_fkbc7p5,1584030520.0,Ohh haha I get it now!
