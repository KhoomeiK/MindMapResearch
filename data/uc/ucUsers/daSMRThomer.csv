stopdrinking,fpledno,t1_fple074,1588711211.0,"Thanks! I really didnâ€™t mean for the post to sound so depressing â€” he was one of the biggest encouragers of my sobriety, and his last words to me reflected that. Remembering him is a huge motivation to stay sober."
stopdrinking,fplduqd,t3_gdsjrj,1588710945.0,Not drinking today!
uofmn,fplbqtu,t3_ge1rqj,1588709878.0,"Is this your freshman dorm roommate or an apartment roommate? If itâ€™s for sharing a dorm room yeah Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s a slight issue but if itâ€™s just an apartment or house roomie it really doesnâ€™t matter, Iâ€™d actually recommend that you avoid living with friends or like-minded people in your 2nd-4th years. Theyâ€™re just people that youâ€™re sharing a space with to save money, not people you need to spend tons of time with."
uofmn,fpgnymr,t3_gczkil,1588606346.0,thank mr taylor
minnesotavikings,fpa6n5o,t3_gbxunf,1588441879.0,Explain to me how the aliasing on this changes when I click on it and then changes again when I zoom in and out
uofmn,foqzq7t,t3_g8u5bz,1588003667.0,The name of the university will pop on their resume more than the title of the degree. Go with UMN-TC.
sandiego,foqsxyk,t3_g91fcm,1588000253.0,"Yeah, Iâ€™m gonna go ahead and wait a week or two before I paddle out"

oddlysatisfying,fogby42,t3_g75xjn,1587750614.0,"Nerdy math fact: the dynamical model for this card motion is a hybrid system which admits a Zeno solution; that is to say, the cards will bounce infinite times but come to rest in a finite amount of time.

(Of course, the program discretizes the solution, and the cards go off the screen, so the analogy isnâ€™t quite perfect. But still a fun simple model with weird properties)"
chrisdelia,fobn3qg,t1_fobkn2z,1587661522.0,"Dillon barely said anything but when he did it killed. 2nd hour was great, I need to go back & watch the third which had Chapelle. I was sick of listening to the echo/awkward delay by then."
chrisdelia,fobitwy,t3_g6d6j3,1587660250.0,I randomly caught this live & the echo was so bad the entire time. I think it was bc Santino & Bobby were playing the volume out a speaker
chrisdelia,fobiouv,t1_fo9bvd7,1587660206.0,It was 3 hours and this lineup was the first hour
chrisdelia,fo3gbq5,t1_fo3anb3,1587486422.0,"Yeah but re: Bert, a LOT of people like the life-of-the-party type of guys. Hence his popularity. Lol"
chrisdelia,fo39m8g,t1_fo2zk05,1587483087.0,Tom is the best pure standup by far. Chris and Bert are just both funny podcast personalities who happen to make most of their money from standup
uofmn,fnt01n8,t3_g3pbex,1587232041.0,If it makes any of yall feel better I graduated in 2015 and only went to spring jam my first 3 years. I was over it by the time I was a senior. YMMV but it might just be unfounded FOMO for some of you
chrisdelia,fnszhmr,t3_g3qzch,1587231743.0,"Frankly this might as well be an /r/congratulationspodcast sub with the expectations people have around here for Chris and his standup. Yes, comedy is his main livelihood and is how most casual fans know of him, with podcasting being a side gig. Yes, big fans of him (the type of people who post on /r/chrisdelia) are likely more used to the casual persona he has on podcasts because thereâ€™s just a way bigger quantity of those than his standup. Both things can be true at the same time. This is probably actually true of most professional comedians/part-time podcasters these days."
chrisdelia,fnh93kz,t1_fngmao6,1586957738.0,"Yeah I was being generous but Joes standup is awful, lol"
timberwolves,fnevppf,t3_g17mnc,1586896746.0,RIP Jackie Towns. It wonâ€™t help but whatever: thoughts & prayers to Karl and the towns family.
chrisdelia,fneqenh,t1_fndxpop,1586893994.0,"Havenâ€™t watched it yet, but this is pretty true of most comedians and music artists. Youâ€™re used to their old shit, and they produced their old shit before they were big. Of course youâ€™ll be less inclined to like the new shit â€” itâ€™s different and theyâ€™re different.

Quick edit: Also, this sub is pretty much for his podcast, which is very different from his standup. Same with /r/joerogan, whose standup is way worse than his podcast, imo"

sandiego,fmq6qpx,t1_fmpyfjj,1586293905.0,"Oh, you can actually talk to your landlord instead of some leading office surrogate who will just parrot the directions they got from the company headquarters in New Jersey? Lucky duck!"
sandiego,fmq5z7w,t1_fmpzf98,1586293493.0,Holy shit no kidding. Iâ€™m glad some people have friendly mom & pop landlords whose names they know but there are just as many or more people living in complexes managed by faceless LLCs headquartered somewhere across the country. They donâ€™t give a fuck about economic conditions and will try to squeeze tenants for every penny they can get
barstoolsports,fm5jtd1,t1_fm4xtno,1585774277.0,Think youâ€™re underestimating how both Dave and Joe really can have a rapport with a variety of types of people. They both hate SJWs/easily offended people and are in comedy. I think theyâ€™d get along great.
