CasualConversation,fpljrm2,t3_ge6azz,1588713963.0,"I have had just above shoulder length hair for the past 6 years and it was my LOOK! I get really bored of my hair so I usually dye it. Ive done ginger, black, bright red, and during the first three weeks of quarantine I did green and It looked great... but two weeks ago I got the urge to straight up shave my hair off and I did. Now I have a buzz cut and I think I look like an egg. Bangs will grow out in a few weeks... lol my shaved head is going to take a year!"

Nice ad hominem attack. I get that a lot of people are mean to USAC people, but you literally are doing the exact thing you're accusing them of. A lot of UCLA students have very valid concerns about USAC."
ucla,fpfdot7,t3_gd4hhm,1588568240.0,Ugh this made me so mad.

ucla,fpe8x9j,t1_fpc0eon,1588542713.0,"Changing your schedule every ten weeks is pretty hard. The workload is accelerated and just when I feel like I’ve settled into a new class, it’s already halfway done. A new schedule means waking up at new times and finish classes at new times which in turn changes my work schedule, meal schedule, and workout schedule. If you’re not the type of person who cares about that sort of thing then you’re fine, but that’s why it’s hard for me and a lot of other people"

ThriftStoreHauls,fobr3nr,t1_foabjm5,1587662760.0,"It’s an old picture, I should have clarified"
ucla,fo9hsy8,t1_fo8qaal,1587619926.0,"It really depends on your personality. I came from a semester system and greatly preferred it over the quarter system. Having to choose classes three times a year is honestly stressful for me and just when I start to adjust to my new schedule, midterms are happening. There’s really nothing you can do about it though since that’s just the way the system is! I recommend really keeping up with a schedule and writing down when everything is due (laid out in the syllabus) otherwise things sneak up on you VERY quickly."

ucla,fnn1obm,t1_fnmlzpf,1587082523.0,Yep they were exactly the same. It was super weird. I was able to switch. If your roommate says “no I don’t wanna switch” then you can have your friend ask THEIR roommate to switch with you.
ucla,fnm0jo2,t3_g2j6zh,1587062971.0,I requested my best friend and she requested me and we DIDNT get put together. If that happens you have to ask your roommate to switch with your friend and they both have to email housing a form
