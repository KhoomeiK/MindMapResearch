berkeley,foooikf,t3_g8an1k,1587943137.0,"I could not f*king agree more girl. First of all it’s depressingly rare to find a guy who can actually explain stuff for shit and who cares enough to try to understand what it was like to learn something from the beginning. The cop out answers they give, like you said, are just an easy way for them to stay supportive and generally on good terms but it’s so shallow. It can be really really discouraging to just meet guy after guy like that, especially because there are just so many guys in computer science, but there are good people out there you can be friends with too. 

It was actually that utter annoyance over unhelpful teachers (in the people I met in lower divs, not a dig at the TAs) that I got really involved in teaching and course staffs. I also got involved in volunteer teaching communities, and there was just so much more compassion and thoughtfulness there that I could resonate with. OP I don’t know what your situation is at all, but there’s hope out there and I just wanted to lend my support like so many others on this sub and say I felt the same way- heck it made me really depressed during my college career to feel so isolated. 

But as a graduating senior, looking back I can say it’s not all bad. There are communities of people who care about you as a person, and there are friends in computer science you can make who won’t just be interested in you as a piece of meat. You can and will find them if you keep looking!"
berkeley,fo1ssyg,t3_g4zeoe,1587440682.0,Avishay is super super nice! He went out of his way to email me for a class I was auditing and is always receptive to questions. He definitely seems like one of those professors who cares about the quality of his teaching. I wasn’t personally a fan of umesh but he’s also got a good teaching style!
