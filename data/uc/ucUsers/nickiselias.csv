Family doesn't really get the situation going on for me right now, and that actually is healthy. I'm grateful I can afford them the attention and have the presence that keeps my house more stable... even though I had to drop to 8 units. I can only imagine how shitty it was for them when I wasn't here (not trying to stroke myself but they've been much happier and more cooperative since I've been here I can feel the energy has changed)

It might not be the worst thing in the world for you to switch to home. Maybe there is something for you to gain from this experience outside of academia. There might not be, but thats how its been for me."

UCSD,fobdpfx,t3_g6m1ej,1587658754.0,"Hey man I back you up (<- wish I could bold this), did the same myself. Now at 8 units I can afford to be distracted by my family from home, can encourage/ tutor my little sister who's in high school, and focus more freely and casually on the textbook I retained from the class. The prof even kept me on the google doc (quick shoutout to josh thanks again) so I have access to the lectures and can follow along even though I'm not in it.If it makes you feel better, last quarter failed my analysis class, never scored more than 8 points on a test (2 midterms and a final)  


Edit: you have not failed yet. Failure is defined by what you do with the time you now have. It's a different, generally suboptimal learning enviornment (for academia anyway). grow a plant, learn to cook something new, its just a different kind of class room"

UCSD,fm1p8nu,t1_flychqf,1585682535.0,"That's a good point, thank you for sharing. It makes me happy to hear your 'anecdata' (I'm going to steal this). My little sister is interested in going to school for literature (or something related).  Wealth has always equated to opportunity, and I think being born into opportunity is something that exists regardless of circumstances. Nevertheless, I agree that limiting the majors that qualify for student loans will only create more problems."
