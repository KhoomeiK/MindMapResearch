CITY/HS: Lancaster, Ca Quartz Hill High School

Hobbies: like to do a lot of things haha, I love playing basketball and tennis (casually), working out, singing (even tho I’m not good at it), love to cook, playing drums and guitar, playing video games with the boys, and I like to read, sleep and meditate because mental health ftw. 

Random: I watched the entirety of one piece last summer (I’m talking 900 episodes). Also I’m a huge thunder and lakers fan. Finally I’m vegetarian cause gotta save the planet and shit.

Anyone should HMU or dm me cause ya boy tryna make friends and not be lonely at cal. If y’all tryna play basketball, tennis, or just vibe and be friends in general let’s link!

It’s honesty just personal preference and if you want the vibe of UCLA. But based on what your priorities are, it seems like UCLA should be your number 4. Recruiters go to GaTech UIUC and Cal over UCLA for recruiting esp in the comp sci field from what I’ve read"
