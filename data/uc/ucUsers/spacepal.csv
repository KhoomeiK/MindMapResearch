AnimalCrossing,fopx4kd,t1_fopsusi,1587975100.0,Ohh yeah I have a neighborhood too! So theyâ€™re all on the west side of my island where the east side has more of my decorations and furnitures etc. The only one i see on the other side ever is punchy and he had crackhead energy so i see him in the weirdest places. like one time i saw him on the edge of my cliff in the back of my island
AnimalCrossing,foprzoc,t3_g4s39d,1587970227.0,how come my villagers only ever hang out on one side of the island? it would be cool to see them hang out in the little cafe and picnic area i made on the other side of the island
muacjdiscussion,foo0cyh,t1_fomnmn6,1587930018.0,i didnâ€™t know that! but thank you so much! so yeah theyâ€™re probably just trying to stay afloat :( iâ€™ve been seeing so many small businesses struggle to have people even remember they exist
muacjdiscussion,fomjnup,t1_fof8rob,1587892527.0,i usually mix this in with my foundation but what brush do you use to apply this as a highlighter?
muacjdiscussion,fomjk51,t3_g8aebp,1587892417.0,"i think sales are low for most businesses currently because most people donâ€™t want to spend money and save for emergencies instead. itâ€™s difficult to spend money on makeup when you donâ€™t know when the next time youâ€™ll get stable income again is. i think they are probably just trying to bring in more revenue. i canâ€™t speak for bigger corporations such as the balm but as a small business owner, i and my other small shop friends have also been doing longer sales trying to keep business alive"

muacjdiscussion,fncgxnx,t3_g0buz4,1586836484.0,I feel like Colourpop liquid lip products start to smell bad after like a year. Esp if they were used quite a bit for a while.
muacjdiscussion,fmn2qhz,t1_fmn1c4q,1586216970.0,Do you have another eyeliner you would recommend?
muacjdiscussion,fmmtby6,t3_fw12rx,1586211685.0,"I donâ€™t really ever buy backups for makeup unless a holy grail item I use daily or almost every day is being discontinued. For example, I have backups of Colourpop pressed powder shadow in the Libra because itâ€™s my everyday all over color shade. I also have backups of Colourpopâ€™s lip liner in Aquarius because that was discontinued. Other than that I donâ€™t really buy backups because usually Iâ€™ll find something new I like better by the time I run out of one of my favorites. I do usually buy the next product when the current one Iâ€™m using is close to finishing. Like when my setting spray is 80% done, Iâ€™ll order a new bottle if I want a replacement. No I donâ€™t really regret buying backups of discontinued items. 
Skincare, I usually keep an extra tub of an item for when it runs out. But if Im trying something new, I donâ€™t buy a backup until I know Iâ€™ll want another one forsure."

no. of individual blushes owned: 20

no. of blush palettes owned: 0

preference -  cream or powder: cream! 

preference - bright or subdued: in between! not too bright and not too subdued. if i had to choose one though itâ€™d be subdued

all time favorite/go-to: flower beauty blush bomb! 2/3 pinched and 1/3 bubbly mixed together makes my perfect color

current favorite: kylie flutter in love

favorite high end/luxury blush: jouer blush duo in adore

favorite drugstore: flower beauty blush bombs

best matte blush: kylie flutter in love

best shimmer: the shimmery side of jouerâ€™s blush duo in adore

best cream: flower beauty blush bombs

overrated: colourpop blush stix - super stiff and patchy for me. clings to my eczema patches

underrated: the mf blush bombs i never hear anyone talk about these

most used: jouer blush duo in adore & the blush bombs

least used: nars madly

worth the hype: clinique cheek pops. love the formula so much but the color selection isnâ€™t my favorite. i wish they would release blush pop as a single.

major disappointment: nars orgasm. was wayyy too glittery and the glitter just sat on my face. also, charlotte tilbury pillow talk. itâ€™s my favorite lipstick ever but the blush was too shimmery and was really brown for some reason.

top 5: 1 - kylie flutter in love, flower beauty blush bombs in pinched and bubbly, jouer blush duo in adore, clinique cheek pop in blush pop, and tarte paaarty

on your wishlist: i want a powder version of the color i make with the blush bombs. still looking but kylie flutter in love is the closest!"
