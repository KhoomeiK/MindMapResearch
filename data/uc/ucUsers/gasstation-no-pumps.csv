Students have often been working with the faculty member for all of junior year before starting the thesis project.

For STEM students, just about all the large first and second-year courses (physics, calculus, chemistry, biology, programming, …) are offered at community college and are already articulated, but they are offered at many different levels (I think UCSC has 4 or 5 different calculus series), so make sure you are taking the highest-level one if you want it to count for all majors.

Every GSI appointment needs to be approved by the Committee on Courses of Instruction,  who scrutinize the SETs turned in from when the grad student was a TA.  Those SETs for TAs do matter (CCI is always disappointed that the response rate is under 20%—biased samples tell us so little.)

UCSC,fny5rke,t3_g4kppb,1587354086.0,"I'm the BMEB undergrad director this year and next.  I'll try to answer all your questions, though BMEB undergrads may have different answers.

1. Calculus is essential for doing the heavy-duty statistics courses.  And if you choose the new curriculum, then you may want to do ODE in order to take full advantage of the new AM course in metabolic modeling.  Physics is not so important any more for BMEB.  You'll need biochem, but the general chem and o. chem that are prereqs to biochem are less important (unless you go into protein engineering, in which case some of the o. chem becomes important).  The main programming languages for BMEB majors are Python and either C or C++, though there is some programming in R or even (shudder) Perl in some research groups.  MATLAB is used for  metabolic modeling.
2. Sign up for the bmeb-ugrads mailing list [https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/#!forum/bmeb-ugrads](https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/#!forum/bmeb-ugrads)   
If you don't have a @ucsc.edu e-mail address yet, be sure to explain who you are, so that you can be added to the list.  Attend the BME weekly department research seminar (Thursdays at 11:40, Zoom links on the bmeb-ugrads list).  Look at web pages for faculty in the biomolecular engineering department, but also MCD bio and Electrical and Computer Engineering, as our students do research in many different labs.  Contact the faculty whose labs you are interested in by e-mail and ask if you can sit in on their lab group meetings—after showing that you have read some of the lab's papers and explaining that you are an incoming transfer student.  The BME department is **very** interested in promoting undergrad research.  
BMEB majors submitted 21 or 22 of the 27 submissions for Deans' and Chancellor's Awards in the School of Engineering this year, and BME faculty were supervising 4 of the 10 submissions in Physical and Biological Sciences.
3. Of the BSoE staff advisers, Monique Vairo and Greta Hull are the best for consulting about the BMEB major—the other advisers are often confused by the major and sometimes give less accurate advice.  After you have put together a plan for what courses will get you through to graduation, you definitely want to consult with them about whether it meets the requirements and is doable.  If you have questions about which options are the best for particular goals after your BS, talk with the undergrad directors or other faculty.
4. Look at [https://beng.soe.ucsc.edu/independent-study-and-capstone-courses](https://beng.soe.ucsc.edu/independent-study-and-capstone-courses) which was written for the old BENG major, but applies to BMEB as well.  Join the Bioinformatics Club."
