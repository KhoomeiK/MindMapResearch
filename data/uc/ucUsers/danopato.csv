Last I heard the Ardmore neighborhood association beat that back. They seem to be intensely opposed to any kind of increase in density or commercial use of land in Ardmore.

The Ardmore Terrace apartments between Queen and Cloverdale just evicted all their residents with the intention of tearing everything down and building a new mixed use complex.

There’s loads of room in Ardmore to [re]develop and improve walkability and services if only the money and the political will were there. I do wonder how the projects that are getting some momentum will do if the trends of the last couple weeks continue and we end up in a recession."
