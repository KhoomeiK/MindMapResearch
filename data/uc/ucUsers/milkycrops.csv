When I plug it in, the charging screen shows up saying the battery is drained and this will just blink until I unplug it. Apple online tech was useless. I never let it sustain damage, I've tried hard restarting it, and I've tried clearing the charging port of debris. I haven't had any issues with battery leakage or power levels prior to this. My online searches didn't help. Pls help me I'm desperate"
