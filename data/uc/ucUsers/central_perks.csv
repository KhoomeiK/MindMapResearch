sanfrancisco,fpmjauz,t1_fpm76e1,1588734312.0,"Dude I literally have private company RSUs. I don't pay taxes on them until after the IPO due to double trigger vesting. Airbnb uses a double trigger vesting system, which is not uncommon (if a company uses single trigger vesting, then yes, you'll be taxed immediately).

> Double trigger RSUs are not taxable to you until they have both vested AND the company has IPO’d (hence the name ‘double trigger’). These were designed to avoid causing you a tax bill before the shares could even be sold for cash. The exact specifics can vary by company, but often they’ll become taxable at the IPO date, with the FMV based on the IPO price. You’ll pay ordinary income tax rates on this amount, and your employer generally will withhold a portion of the shares to cover the tax. Any gain (or loss) occurring from the IPO date to when you eventually sell after the lockup period will be a capital gain. If you hold for 12 months, the capital gain will be considered long-term and subject to the preferential rates.

Normally, my company is designed for 4 days at the office, 1 day remote (Wednesdays) per week - very few people come in on Wednesdays so it's very embedded in the culture. I can work additional days from home basically as I want, which I do occasionally; if I wanted to do it super frequently, I could arrange it with my manager. Virtually all meetings can be done remotely thanks to teleconferencing gear in all conference rooms. I usually aim to work 10-6, but hours are totally flexible and no one is tracking, so I can come and go as I please.

ExperiencedDevs,fny2ihm,t1_fnxzhze,1587351825.0,My company has work from home Wednesdays (in addition to generally being able to wfh as wanted). I think this is roughly the ideal situation IMO. Most of the time I like to come to the office since it's easier to focus and I can get free food and coffee. If I'm tired or don't feel like going in or I have errands to run or I'm trying to fly out for a weekend on a Thursday night I can work from home as I want.

Cal is intense for sure, but 99% of the students I interacted with were chill and helpful. I've never experienced nor heard of anyone, like, attempting to sabotage other students."

Spoken like a true New Yorker."
berkeley,fnx0k19,t1_fnwy6cv,1587329113.0,"Flights are cheaper now in the USA (inflation adjusted) than they've ever been. But yeah, bag fees are the reason we should strip people of the freedom of enterprise. I'd much rather have shitty government provided service like Amtrak, run to lose money that is ultimately paid for by the tax payer.

Dividends and stock buybacks are such a  red herring argument. Airlines have had plenty of unprofitable years where investors got nothing. Most airlines have profit sharing agreements. Do you understand that profits are the money left over AFTER reinvestment into the business, paying staff, operational expenses, profit sharing with employees (eg the billions delta returned to employees through bonuses last year), etc?  Do you understand that millions of people have a financial stake in the airlines, either by holding stock directly or via funds in their 401ks and pensions?

As for the environment, that's what regulation is for, not nationalization. No one here is advocating laissez-faire capitalism, but there's a middle ground between that and full scale state socialism."
berkeley,fnwxmjl,t1_fnwigc5,1587327456.0,"The bailouts may include the government getting an equity stake in the airlines.

Fully nationalizing is a terrible idea IMO. Because I don't want my airlines run like Amtrak: poor service, losing money, and constantly subject to political whims."
berkeley,fnwwzwv,t1_fnvegri,1587327102.0,"I've been up this tree for a while but usually hold my tongue cause he's so revered at Berkeley. 

Everything I see from him is pretty biased. Whenever he comes up in an interview, article, op ed, or tweet, he has a clear and strong political slant. Which on its own is fine, he is (was?) a political figure and its ok to be political (though being basically dishonest like this tweet is IMO too far).

The issue to me is that so many people at Berkeley see him as a Professor and not as a political actor, so they take the things he says as the word of a relatively unbiased educator and not a comparatively biased political figure. I haven't taken his class but from what I hear it sounds like it has a political slant to it as well."
berkeley,fnwwf8e,t1_fnu5vz6,1587326779.0,"Came here to say this, the whole point of the bailout is that the funds are basically paying employee wages and they can't lay anyone off until October. They would've been laid off already without a bailout.

Tweet smells like bullshit to me."
AskReddit,fnv785b,t1_fnunz3s,1587282638.0,I mean it seems like a lot but the average college lecture is 1-1.5 hours and probably meets 2-3 times a week. Professors are giving the equivalent of that assignment weekly.
AskReddit,fnv753x,t1_fnujtw2,1587282553.0,Jesus christ that's a brutal assignment and brutal for the class that has to watch 45 hours of student presentations.
cscareerquestions,fnnc03y,t1_fnn1e95,1587088932.0,"True. 

There's also a difference between technical discussion subs (eg something focused on ios or Android or a language) and career advice subs. I could still use career advice. I'm trying to make the L4->L5 jump next. I'm debating moving to a new company, and am trying to decide what places allow me to continue growing technically, live where I want, make more money, etc. 

These are all things I could use advice from experienced devs on, but for the most part I don't get that kind of thing on this sub."
