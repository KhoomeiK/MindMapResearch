UCSC,fp8tvs6,t1_fp802nn,1588402826.0,"Transfer units are units that get transferred from one school to another. For example, in high school, you had to take certain classes to graduate right? Each school has different requirements, and if you move to another school, there's no point to take a class you already took, so those classes get transferred. The same goes for colleges/universities. These can be best answered by your school's advisors.

But don't worry too much about it. Try to enjoy what little time you have of your youth, because soon enough, you'll realize how much you'll miss being a teenager."

I know many people that can calculate a derivative using implicit differentiation, but can't change a tire on a car. I usually alway recommend people to take some time off of school if you feel burnt out, but in these times, there isn't really any options for you at the moment. But if this pandemic eases up, I highly recommend taking some time off from school. Sometimes, all we need is a month away from everything  to realize what we really want. We all need to take a step back to look at things from a different perspective.

Don't let bad grades bring you down. They're just some letters/numbers on a piece of paper. It's not a reflection of what kind of person you are. Developing a good character will get you a lot further in life than a good GPA."
