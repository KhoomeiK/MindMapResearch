UCSantaBarbara,fpirso6,t1_fpimxd0,1588647271.0,"Ok so I lived in the dorms this year so my pricing is a bit skewed, plus I got all my expenses covered from grants and loans so I might not be as accurate. I will say that I spent $14,391 on tuition and $15,111 on dorm housing (Manzi triple with 7 meals per week). I spent maybe like $20 a week at most on food if I wasn't eating in the dining commons and was really hungry. I never paid for any school stuff except notebooks and renting an iclicker (I cheaped out on all of that since I didn't need much more). I paid $34 for the RHA fee and I paid $300 for club dues on a sport club. It's kinda hard to give you a rough figure but from tuition + housing I was paying $29.5k which is a lot but it might be lower for you if you're living in an apartment. Note that school dorms are very expensive so if you lived off campus or on the school's apartments it'd be much less. If your award letter also gives you loans and you're ok with them then you'll probably be fine on the financial side."
UCSantaBarbara,fpfgx1u,t1_fpey9xn,1588570904.0,"Hey I was in that exact situation two years ago! SD is very cheap and home feeling, plus its a bigger city overall. But I've lived there my whole life, and bigger doesn't mean better. From my experience, I said ""Fuck it, experience is worth more than saving money"". Plus sd got really boring and tiring for me, and I didn't want to be recognized or have a reputation. It was the best decision I ever made; being far from home let me grow and experience way more than I could have if I stayed at home and gone to ucsd. The extra money I paid was well worth the fun and friends I've made here, and the city of SB lends itself so well to the college experience and is just different enough from sd to be fresh without it feeling foreign.

If you haven't made a choice so far and wanna question me I'm open to more questions! No pressure though."
StarWars,fpf40qy,t1_fpembm9,1588561258.0,:0 That’s great!
StarWars,fpf3ykz,t1_fpf28lt,1588561218.0,I love it! Season 7 has tons of great art-worthy shots.
StarWars,fpe0zp8,t1_fpdhxzp,1588538199.0,"I'm tearing up at watching the ending :( Beautiful way to end the series and i hope the good praise will get more casual Star Wars fans to give the show a chance. I also listened to the credits of ROTS as a celebration and it was very fitting. I'm glad it was short, it didn't need any more than what was shown."
StarWars,fpe026l,t1_fpdhs13,1588537667.0,I need a wallpaper of that and the final shot with the clone helmet. I'll put it side by side with Halo Reach's opening shot that mirrors it.
StarWars,fpa974x,t1_fpa2hx2,1588443365.0,Kanan: The Last Padawan   or something like that.
KingdomHearts,fp59yx9,t1_fp5950c,1588321536.0,"That's fair, usually i would do it to get out of the last attack on a combo to get a chance to recover quickly"
StarWars,fp581iw,t1_fp57yeq,1588319547.0,Which btw did we see Jesse die at any point? I vaguely remember him with Rex when they turn but nothing after.
KingdomHearts,fp57y80,t1_fp4kqsp,1588319453.0,Doesn't aerial recovery have i-frames? I usually use them in fights like Sephiroth or Marluxia when they combo me in the air.
KingdomHearts,fp57vy3,t1_fp4eqj1,1588319390.0,I did it at 60 but it was also my second playthrough on beginner so I could cheese it by gliding around until magic came back lol
StarWars,fp57pb7,t1_fp56kvj,1588319200.0,"""Wanna hear the new orders? Is on the same energy as Fallen Order's ""I heard we're getting new orders soon"" Makes me sad"
StarWars,fp57mho,t1_fp57hor,1588319118.0,Oh yeah you're right.
StarWars,fp5706h,t1_fp55xni,1588318491.0,Reminds me of those clones who were hunting down Kanan in the comics. They were able to get Bilaba but after hunting down Kanan they finally resisted enough to stop themselves.
JRPG,fp39mdx,t1_fp3696o,1588275491.0,"I have too many jrpgs already, I should finish those. But what if i wanna play all the other ones on sale? Maybe I'll buy them now just in case... And that's how my backlog became a backlog of franchises."
KingdomHearts,fp31qq5,t1_fp1jenw,1588271603.0,"I mean side games in the sense that they’re not the main, numbered games lol."
KingdomHearts,fozz0f5,t1_foyw9n8,1588199409.0,"My favorite part is how kh3 is the culmination of all the game mechanics from the previous games and side games, makes it feel like even though sora loses his powers every game he still learned skills each game. Plus they’re nice callbacks"
NoStupidQuestions,fovefk6,t1_foufdae,1588099938.0,"Damn I grew up the opposite, I lived in the same room as my two brothers for my entire life (still do when i come home from school). At school I also lived in a triple. Either way your advice is good, it helped me adjust to living with strangers."
comics,fotgkjp,t1_foscwn6,1588053303.0,"Nice, I subbed."
BikiniBottomTwitter,fornob5,t1_foreo3k,1588015312.0,"Wow another fellow socially awkward extrovert, I knew we were out there! I was hopi I wasn’t the only one"
BikiniBottomTwitter,fornk0l,t1_forja7t,1588015253.0,Yeah and I’m an extrovert who’s also very shy and socially awkward. But I do love hanging out with people and get more energetic from it.
CloneWarsMemes,fog6xjx,t1_fofbn09,1587748704.0,"Yeah they basically target anyone that looks like a Jedi to them, so anyone with a lightsaber including Vader before they knew about him. One of the comics even has an on-the-run Jedi turn some Purge Troopers (whom were originally Clones in the first batch) against the Inquisitors by literally Order 66'ing them as they were former Jedi."
StarWarsLeaks,fog2wc6,t1_foeyqi8,1587747130.0,I have no doubt about that but it’d still make for an interesting what if if Anakin lost.
StarWarsLeaks,foet2lt,t1_foese8r,1587713801.0,This would be a great place to have a new run of Star Wars Infinities where Anakin goes and is killed. It'd be about Maul vs Sidious maybe or even more chaotic power struggles.
StarWarsLeaks,foespnd,t1_foesjck,1587713452.0,"For real, it's sad seeing everyone else treating Maul like he's going insane (which he kinda is) for his predictions yet we all know he is right. Ahsoka can't believe that Anakin would fall, but you know... :(

These episodes just get better and better I'm on the edge of my seat."
todayilearned,fo4tn3q,t1_fo4i3l4,1587510981.0,"In SMT your usual random encounter has you fighting lesser gods. Late game has full on major deities running around for you to recruit or grind exp on. That’s why I love SMT, it takes the god killing trope on steroids."
StarWarsLeaks,fnt7wge,t1_fnrdt9u,1587236324.0,To be fair I think the scene was a parallel to rotj and that’s why they used the soundtrack. We’ll probably get to hear more rots later in the arc so it’s not a big deal anyways.
StarWarsLeaks,fno4a8k,t1_fno2pgc,1587111524.0,Yeah I can’t wait for the 7 season collection to come out. Or at least I hope it’s a thing.
StarWarsLeaks,fno2d18,t1_fno0nj6,1587109533.0,"Bro the music was on point. It felt like I was watching a movie. Now I'm starting to wish they made this arc a whole movie i want it all now.

I like the farewell between Ashoka and Anakin, it felt like Obi wan and Anakin's last conversation in ROTS. Plus it'll be interesting to hear if and how the death of Grievous will show an effect on the clones seeing as now the war is truly ending."
flashcarts,fnnvvi9,t1_fnnvqx5,1587103346.0,"It might be, but fortunately for me i found one of my old R4 clones lying around and got ysmenu working on it so i dont actually need the r4i 3ds gold plus. Hope you get a reply soon!"
flashcarts,fnnvo4n,t3_g2w2lx,1587103162.0,I also have this problem and I actually forgot I ordered from them since its been over a week since i did
KingdomHearts,fnm11cq,t1_fnl2rsa,1587063216.0,Personally I just wanna know what progress they've made...
starterpacks,fnepsx5,t1_fne7l08,1586893690.0,But then they hit you with the “Let’s go in reverse alphabetical order!” Which happened frequently in my elementary. Too bad I’m dead in the middle so it never mattered to me.
movies,fn7div5,t1_fn794e8,1586718195.0,“I’ll help you find the next one”
smashbros,fn1ch4f,t1_fmzm91c,1586559162.0,I’m hyped for that too but the main game I’m really excited for is SMT V which is all i care about. But that game will never get released because atlus forgot it from milking P5 (which isn’t a bad game anyways). smt v news when
JRPG,fmyw4je,t1_fmyrj8z,1586497592.0,Fortunately smt 4 is the main one that is difficult. The other megaten games are much easier to choose the endings.
Megaten,fly0cgr,t1_flx6b9z,1585593203.0,"If you've played SMT 3 those two are perfectly accessible. Just be warned that smt 4 is only extra difficult in the very beginning, then its much easier after."
