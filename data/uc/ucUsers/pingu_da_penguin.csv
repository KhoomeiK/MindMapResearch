UCSantaBarbara,fphuzvh,t3_gdiw9n,1588628299.0,"PSTAT 126 w Gross, this class was so straightforward and a great introduction to R. Great hw, great lecture slides, and Gross made me feel like me and my questions mattered. Made me change my major from actuarial to statistics and I wish Gross never left. 

PSTAT 115 w Franks, I wish franks taught every single stats class he was amazing in retrospect. Lecture slides were easy to follow, homework was tough, but the concepts were really cool. I never understood the hype about Bayesian estimates before but a 10 week class focused on it really changed my mind. 

PSTAT 131, all profs for this class are trash imo but the concepts within the course are extremely interesting. Machine learning is extremely important and there are soo many different methods involved to help create the best model, just wish I had a better lecturer for it who could have made me more passionate about the course while I was taking it.

Edit: lots of typos"
UCSantaBarbara,fphgfwg,t3_gdgypq,1588620842.0,"120B material showed up in nearly every upper div stats class I took after it in some way shape or form. However I did not do too hot in 120B, but you can teach yourself the material you need along the way in future classes, but obviously it’s best and easiest to master the material the first time around"

UCSantaBarbara,fpbt9js,t3_gca4a4,1588478149.0,"You should be fine! However someone mentioned it above, if you’re new to programming, two different languages at once might get a bit confusing. I’d be wary about using SAS syntax in python and vice versa. If you think you can clearly distinguish the two languages and not have a problem with this, then you should be perfect! 

Also, personally for me, between the two cs8 is more difficult, longer more difficult assignments, but that’s just me. So if you have to prioritize one I’d say choose cs8."

UCSantaBarbara,fp984kn,t1_fp917ch,1588417955.0,"^ This is the best way to describe the percentage you’re looking for. 

Also OP I’m sorry you’re dealing with the generalizations already. The second I committed all my “friends” in hs started talking mad shit on ucsb, the education I’d receive, said that I would become an alcoholic/drug addict (I literally never drank or partied ever before ucsb lmao), and also mentioned that I was “too much of a nerd to deserve to go to ucsb” lol. Although it’s bothersome comments and it feels like they’re trying to invalidate your education, your school, and college experience, don’t pay attention to it and focus on you. It’s petty comments for a reason I can’t really justify, but don’t let it effect you and your experience here. 

I hope you have a great 4 years at ucsb and iv. You made a great choice! Best of luck!!"
UCSantaBarbara,fp8sx21,t3_gbqhh3,1588401917.0,"I can only really speak on your proposed fall quarter classes. It will be doable but I’m not gonna lie I think it’s a bit much and it’ll cause you to struggle. Pstat 115 and 131 (I took both concurrently) give lengthy, difficult homeworks although you have approx 2 weeks to complete each assignment. I haven’t ever taken 160A but I’ve heard it also has long homework. Plus an Econ class, it’s gonna be tough. I took 16 units in fall (pstat 131, pstat 115, pstat 175, and another UD for my minor) and I was stretched pretty thin but I also had other responsibilities (work + president of an org). 

In short it’ll be doable, but it’s gonna be grueling, at least it was for me. Everyone’s different and I hope it’s easier for you and that you can handle it better than I did! Best of luck!"

UCSantaBarbara,fp1j3mc,t3_gajrty,1588237253.0,"Not necessary. You can learn as you go in 109. Someone else mentioned it, but there’s defo overlap between the two courses. Not worth taking both, you’d be wasting ur time imo"
UCSantaBarbara,fp04ub1,t3_gaeo5x,1588202510.0,"Although it’s not necessary, as others have said the course is designed to teach you the basics of python, I would recommend learning it. Idk how maybe I had shit luck when I took cs8 fall of my freshman year (fall 2016) but I felt like I was drowning. Prof kept saying “this is an elementary course” but would teach things as if we’ve seen it and expected us to be familiar with certain topics and syntax. It was very frustrating and I felt like I was surrounded by people who were far more advanced, I basically felt dumb af for 10 weeks straight. I would suggest learning some basics via code academy to help make it easier on yourself.

Edit: forgot to mention a huge reason I’m advocating to learn it over summer is because usually I would recommend relying on a TA for assistance, however mine were useless (ahain probs just bad luck). Also to be fair, i have never seen my cs8 profs name on gold to be teaching any cs course since I had him. I remember him being new so he might have just dipped after that  quarter.... after making me suffer for 10 weeks :)))"
AskWomen,fotsf6w,t3_g9gfo0,1588064459.0,"I’ve always had extremely thick hair and never had much issues with my hair because of it. However, after swimming 3+ hours daily for approx 2.5 years my hair got severely chlorine damaged and would fall out in clumps after showers. Now a few years later (in my early 20s, not a teen anymore) I started noticing my hair is falling more (not sure why). However both times, what helped me was doing hair masks before a shower w natural oils at home, this includes anything from olive oil (personally helps me the most with both hair growth and dry scalp), coconut oil (helps w dry scalp but not as much w hair growth for me), sometimes castor oil (I don’t use this one much, the scent it too intense for me, the first two don’t have a lingering scent after shower). However for whichever oil you use that works best for you and your scalp, the key is to keep it on as long as possible before a shower (30 min minimum), massage it thoroughly into scalp, and stay consistent with it! Hope this helps :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fomuvsh,t3_g8am0s,1587904585.0,"Math department is great! Lower div might give you grief as they over complicate sometimes (use CLAS services + math lab for help) and upper div classes are really good too (I haven’t taken many but the ones I did I really enjoyed, again take advantage of math lab if help is needed). However I will say, although this applies to a lot of departments and classes, the professor absolutely fucking matters. I cannot express how many times I have purposely not taken a course because the more difficult professors were teaching it (this applies to statistics department too). I also suggest as good as the department is, make a connection w profs, go to OH please I cannot stress this enough, I wish I did it more!! Pm for any other questions and I’ll offer any other advice if needed! Best of luck pal"
UCSantaBarbara,fo94lek,t1_fo940gt,1587610412.0,"I completely understand that concern. To my knowledge that is why a lot of my friends personally never even got tested, as they were uncomfortable with potentially using the “DSP benefits” when they felt as though they could and had been getting along fine in “regular classroom exam settings”. I can’t speak on it, but I guess to each their own. Whatever you’re comfortable with. 
However, I would suggest that if you got tested and passed (not sure if that’s the correct term here), please do not hesitate to utilize the opportunities the university is providing. Don’t think of it as taking advantage for academic gain, I’d suggest looking at it as making your struggles easier so you don’t have to “work a lot harder”."
UCSantaBarbara,fo8t12w,t3_g6am2i,1587603234.0,"Also a tutor here (math) and basically the application opens in spring. The application from what I remember requires a letter of rec, transcript, and filling in other information (such as how many hours you’d be willing to work per week and what classes you’ve done and are comfortable with teaching). If they like your application, you’re called in for an interview, where they ask a bunch of questions on how you’d handle being a tutor, what makes you think you’d be a good one, what you’d do if a student doesn’t understand. At the end you give a mini-lesson and they ask you questions as if they were students and you gotta be able to adjust your explanations. 

Overall the job is extremely rewarding. I wouldn’t change it for the world. My students are like my kids and for those that actually speak to me and treat me like a human and not a scary authority figure, we’re great pals! I would however advise tho please for yourself, find a balance between investing in your students/work and doing your own academics/life. Personally for me, my first quarter that fine line was v blurry and my academics suffered from it."
UCSantaBarbara,fo8ry93,t3_g6af4f,1587602599.0,"As a prior DSP proctor (I never had DSP services, just worked there) I know I can’t speak on how easy or difficult it is to get approved, but I will say the extended amount of time you get on an exam is worth it. I could feel the relief from students knowing they had more than just the 50 min or 75 min that a non-DSP student has. If you feel as though you need additional exam time (whether it’s bc you find bigger classroom settings are quick distractions or anxiety of testing rooms) I recommend applying. I believe you also get priority registration, which I’m sure would also help with anxiety."
UCSantaBarbara,fo8rfc0,t3_g6bsvw,1587602296.0,"Not gonna lie, I totally cried at this video. Can’t believe I completed my last on campus quarter without knowing it was my last time on campus. Hope all is well to my fellow gauchos. Please those of you who are continuing education at SB and can go back, appreciate the hell outta the campus and iv. Thank u"
UCSantaBarbara,fo60ofj,t3_g5th4v,1587542135.0,"I took 120A and 6A in Fall 2017 at the same time by complete coincidence (as in I did not plan to coordinate it this way) and literally it made no difference, We hit double integrals in 6A a few weeks before getting to them in 120A (double integrals are the only concept that these two courses overlap in) and if anything it just helped me get through the problem a bit quicker. However those who were ""struggling"" (120A was their first time seeing a double integral) were quick to learn it and move forward. 

So in short, 6A being taken alongside 120A as opposed to prior will not make 120A more difficult at all, if anything it helps keep double integrals super fresh in your mind. Best of luck!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnvabxe,t3_g43hvv,1587285835.0,"I can definitely relate. I went in spring 2019 out of desperation because I couldn't go back home to go to my usual optometrist and the irritation was growing to be unbearable (I was hesitant to go bc I don't have Gaucho health insurance but was in so much pain I just went to student health bc close af and needed a solution asap).  I've been to student health a few times for other issues and was I guess expecting a similar experience with kind staff and kind medical advice. Heather Nichols was sooo rude I was shocked. Barely looked at my eyes, was extremely condescending which was uncalled for and unnecessary. I don't remember much of what she said  (bc a year ago) but I do remember that I asked if I had an eye infection (both eyes were itchy and I couldn't put on my contacts anymore without ripping them off in 2 seconds) to which she responded ""uh yah duh"" and tbh i just shut the fuck up the rest of the visit and refrained from speaking unless spoken to. I was asked to come back 2 weeks later, which she was nicer, still an ass tho. Never went back. No need for that attitude and tone when you're already not feeling well on top of the stress of affording the visit + other health issues + school.
Edit: forgot to mention that she blatantly ignored my request for my eye drop prescription to be sent to cvs (where my insurance would cover) as opposed to student health pharmacy"

UCSantaBarbara,fmymxky,t3_fy2fe6,1586490121.0,"pstats dept is pretty notorious (at least from my experience and what I've heard from friends/peers/other redditors) to not offer much help. If we're drawing comparisons, stats dept has a fraction of the resources math dept has (math has math lab for both lower and upper div courses, CLAS, ta's, a bunch of online resources, etc) while stats just has a few lower div CLAS classes and ta's.

For 120B, I was able to follow lectures semi well (I had Bapat) but my TA/section was an absolute useless 50 minutes of my life for 10 weeks. What helped me in all honesty was doing as many practice problems from the book as possible and using Chegg and or Slader to see the steps. I know Chegg/Slader aren't good and I usually don't encourage it's use when I tutor people for math courses, but it helped me for 120B.

Unfortunately I can't offer much help w 160A as I haven't taken it, but I know everyone struggles w it. I've heard the book is useful??? but don't take my word on that.

What I recommend for both courses is finding people to work alongside. In all my stats courses, I found that study groups were extremely beneficial to my learning and retaining of information. See if others would be willing to join a study group and make a groupchat where you can exchange help and assistance understanding concepts and problems as needed.

Hope this helps, I wish I could say that stats dept stops screwing you at a certain point, but that would be a lie. Hope it gets better. Stay safe and healthy!"
