I think you‚Äôll thrive at UCLA and I hope you love it as much as me!! It‚Äôs such a fantastic environment and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. I understand the parent struggles, soooo many of my friends had issues with that. Pre-need or pre-law or pre-grad at UCLA are all amazing, and you‚Äôll succeed no matter what. Make the most of those four years! Hopefully fall quarter isn‚Äôt online (big oof) and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions about UCLA in general!"
ApplyingToCollege,fp3tfoc,t1_fp3qf0l,1588285480.0,"Of course! No problem at all.

1. No. In all honesty, data science at UCLA is so dang new that it really can‚Äôt compare to Berkeley‚Äôs. But that‚Äôs not to say that it would be bad. UCLA CS does have a good rep and Data Theory is becoming popular, so job opportunities will still be pretty good. 
2. I‚Äôve honestly never heard that about cog sci. I‚Äôm not a cog sci major but I will trust that you‚Äôve done your research lol. Most people here like cog sci because it‚Äôs flexible. It‚Äôll be enough to land you a job if you have the experience, and it‚Äôll be enough to land you a research op to get into grad school if you want.
3. Eh. CS rejections are hyped up a LOT. Basically, if you can get that GPA AND you do well in the pre-major classes, you have a good chance. That being said, it‚Äôs still not easy. A lot of people really really struggle to get to that point. Adjusting to college and quarter system in the first place is difficult, so a lot of people aren‚Äôt prepared for the work involved. 
4. For context, I‚Äôm a freshman! I was undeclared and looked into pretty much every major you could ever imagine with my counselor so that‚Äôs why I feel like I know a good amount about them lol. Internships are not hard to get. My roommate literally got one during first quarter and she‚Äôs in engineering. If you put yourself out there and try, you‚Äôll be rewarded. That‚Äôs easier said than done. First usually comes research positions, then internships. I don‚Äôt know much about job offers, but I know that sometimes internships will reach out and offer a job. I don‚Äôt have any details on that, and I don‚Äôt want to give you false information so I recommend that you look more into that.

Hope that helped!!"

ApplyingToCollege,fp3r05r,t3_gay0k1,1588284220.0,"My roommate turned down Berkeley regents for UCLA nothing. Nada. No financial aid at all. 

She doesn‚Äôt regret a thing.

You seem to be pretty focused on the academic reputation part. I agree that Berkeley has a longer history of academic ‚Äúprestige‚Äù which means it may seem better, but please keep in mind that there‚Äôs literally a one spot difference between these two UCs. They switch so often that it‚Äôs impossible to say one is better than the other (with the exception of certain majors). But no matter what, both are amazing schools. This difference is seriously not big enough to consider one prestigious and not the other.

This honestly reads to me that you want Berkeley more than UCLA, which is completely fine. Fit is a big deal. If you want Berkeley so much more, then maybe fit is more important than major difficulty.

Also, do you mind me asking what major you are? Berkeley definitely deals with grade deflation so I don‚Äôt doubt that it would be more rigorous there, but keep in mind that UCLA is not a walk in the park. Quarter system honestly makes up a lot of the difference for those who don‚Äôt like it. 

Don‚Äôt worry!! You‚Äôre going to thrive wherever you go as long as you put your mind to it and don‚Äôt let any regrets bother you. That‚Äôs the biggest thing: don‚Äôt let regret control you. Just throw that away the second you commit. There is no ‚Äúbut what if?‚Äù You can succeed equally at both schools as long as you can let go of that. No matter what, you‚Äôre gonna do great. If you do choose UCLA, feel free to ask any questions you might have! I‚Äôm a current student there."
ApplyingToCollege,fp3qnqh,t3_gb34lq,1588284045.0,"UCLA has a mASSIVE premed culture. If you want research opportunities there are literally thousands. However, it is definitely pretty competitive and the classes are difficult, to say the least. That being said, the opportunities to get experience with a hospital literally next to campus are endless. If you have any questions feel free to ask! People take so many different pre-mrs paths that there is no right choice. For some, UCLA is the best place for their premed dreams. For others, it‚Äôs too much. UCLA does have a reputation for premed which could help when applying for med school, but only if the school itself is a good fit and you feel you could thrive there."
ApplyingToCollege,fp3pgw3,t3_gb1yq7,1588283437.0,"Hey there! I go to UCLA so obviously I‚Äôm biased, but I wanted to weigh in!

1. Actually, UCLA does have a data science major!! It‚Äôs just super new (only 1 year old). It‚Äôs called Data Theory. Look into it if you‚Äôre interested! A few professors on the UCLA subreddit have weighed on this and talked about the major and its differences from the stats/cs/math of comp. majors. Also, you can apply undeclared. It‚Äôs not any harder to get in undeclared than any other major. Switching majors is also VERY easy (with exception of engineering school) 
2. The vibe is a big deal here. The difference between the atmospheres at UCLA and UC Berkeley is huge. That‚Äôs not to say one‚Äôs better than the other, but UC Berkeley is absolutely more competitive than UCLA. UCLA will challenge you, but it‚Äôs also very social and cooperative. You should really consider what you want in terms of fit for the school as well, because they‚Äôre very different. 
3. I‚Äôm actually double majoring in stats and psych! The reason people are saying that CS and psych as a double major would be death is because it‚Äôs kind of redundant. There‚Äôs no point. We have a major called cognitive science which combines psych and comp sci (you can choose how much of each) which will give you the almost the same experience with half the stress. You can still double in psych and cs, but it‚Äôs mostly the same classes as cog sci with double the workload. 
4. It is not impossible to switch into CS. It‚Äôs difficult because you need a 3.5+ GPA, but if you‚Äôre planning to go to grad school, that seems like it will be the goal anyways.
5. YOU DO NOT NEED A CAR. Actually, almost no one here has a car. Parking is horrible and everything you need can be reached through walking and public transport (which really isn‚Äôt bad at all). 
6. Like you pointed out, getting research ops are HELLA easy at LA. I‚Äôm in a lab and I have literally no prior experience whatsoever. 

I wish you luck in your decision!!! Whatever you choose, you‚Äôll make the best of it and have a great college experience. Both of these schools are wonderful and you should be so proud of yourself for getting in!!! If you have any questions, feel free to ask."

ucla,fnfzrqn,t3_g1hryf,1586919013.0,"Don‚Äôt recommend this. I‚Äôm fairly sure the music program is also very difficult to get into. Just apply to the college of letters and sciences if you‚Äôre unsure and then you have a better chance of getting classes you need to make the switch. Also I think you need to back up lmao, a 4.22 is not bad under any circumstances. I saw in your other comment that you think you‚Äôll be disadvantaged because of your race. The UC application doesn‚Äôt allow admission officers to see your ethnicity so don‚Äôt worry about that. A 4.22 is good and your SAT is good too. Taking the music school path is completely unnecessary unless you actually wanna stay in the music school. And I have to say it again: the school of music is HARD to get into. It is not easy."
ucla,fmrvvty,t1_fmqul9c,1586337383.0,"Major credits usually aren‚Äôt just counted through units! You have to take specific required courses. So the food cluster will not satisfy any of your major requirements. It will only satisfy your GE requirements (which everyone has to fulfill regardless of major). GE requirements can double up with major requirements. So if you take an environmental science major class, this can count as a science GE as well as a major course. This, most people take a cluster that is the opposite of their field (stem vs humanities) so they can get rid of GEs that won‚Äôt be covered by their major. So STEM majors usually take Humanities clusters and Humanities majors take STEM clusters. 

This isn‚Äôt set in stone. I personally switched my major and now I‚Äôm stem and I‚Äôm in the food cluster. I adored it, it was a really wonderful experience. I highly recommend (also the easiest A I‚Äôve ever had). So honestly this is up to you. It‚Äôs not like if you take a stem cluster you‚Äôll never have time to take your GEs, it just might save you some time in later years. 

As for difficulty in getting classes: they give each student two passes. First pass you enroll in 2 classes and second pass another 2 classes. This is based on your year. Then you are randomly assigned a time. I got some of the absolute worst times both quarters and I have to say that it sucked, but it wasn‚Äôt horrible. I got the classes I absolutely needed and I just fixed my plan a bit for the classes that I couldn‚Äôt get. You should be fine with your major classes, but some GE classes might be popular and those go fast."
