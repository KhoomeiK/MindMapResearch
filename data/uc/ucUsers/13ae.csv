cscareerquestions,fp1axrf,t1_fp18k5f,1588229590.0,"It's a job my guy. The point of a job is to make money, or at least maximize money made for the amount of work put in. And I guarantee you that there exists top tier companies that match whatever positive WLB, interesting work, etc that a 70k job can offer, with the only caveat being that the interviewee needs to be more driven when preparing for interviews and looking for a job. All on top of paying 2-5x the salary for the average engineer and much better all around benefits.

Suck the dude off all you want, but bragging about how one still has a job as others get laid off, is not a good look either.

Also, you're funny if you agree with the opinion that these 20 year olds who landed gigs at Lyft can't find another job elsewhere, or that the opinion that they are dumb money chasers for choosing to work at Lyft. Even if it is a recession. Did you take a peek at Microsoft and Tesla earnings today?

I'll take a jab at people who hold these types of misinformed and deluded opinions any day."

cscareerquestions,foz8uom,t3_ga8rag,1588186615.0,"Here's what I would do:

Create a schedule.

Every morning, spend 10 minutes looking over your resume and polishing where you can (it helps to get a fresh perspective), and then 20 minutes sending out resumes to smaller companies.

During the day, spend ~2 hours looking over concepts you aren't familiar with. This could be essential DS&A, or other concepts you might need to brush up on (concurrency, compilers, database concepts, networking concepts). 

Spend another ~3-4 hours doing leetcode. When you just start out expect it to be slow (maybe 5 questions a day) but as you do more and more you can start hitting around 10 a day. To be comfortable with FAANG, you'd probably want around 300-500 done, not to say that you have to do that much (depends on how well you internalize the concepts/patterns and a bit on luck).

If you want to work on a personal project in the evening to unwind, that could be fun too. Personally I find stuff like building a website or game fun since you can kinda play around with it, and it could be a good chance to pick up new frameworks or technologies you aren't familiar with.

Assuming you are efficient with your time in the next 2-4 months, you can become extremely prepared for top tier companies. It's a relatively small amount of effort for a large payout."

we did add an announcement and we did change the rules page. In fact, we dropped requirements twice iirc.

streetwear,foeywoa,t1_fod0nzd,1587719770.0,"To give you some context in terms of the discussions we had, not all mods ""stood by"" the position for higher quality content. We've had many discussions about it during that period of time, and what eventually won out was to just open up the front page and let it ride.

The whitelist, in retrospect, was a good idea in concept, but it simply couldn't be executed properly no matter what we did due to the nature of this sub's userbase. We were backlogged occasionally (usually do to splits between whether a person should be whitelisted or not), but the main issue is that even when we lowered whitelist standards, no one was submitting even a half decent application. 

On top of that, people with a certain knowledge of fashion either don't want to post here, or gravitate towards specific styles. It makes it really hard to promote diversity with a whitelist.

In our discussions, I personally pushed very hard for going back to megathreads like in the really old days, having other themed rotating megathreads, and reserving the front page for high effort content, discussion, inspo, and relevant news, but other mods and some of the more active users pushed back pretty heavily on that idea because they thought that it would completely kill the sub (they may still be right, but I still maintain this position). I eventually just caved with the mentality that opening up the floodgates and lowering the bar on quality would be my ""I told you so"" moment, and here we are.

That being said, we have been pretty lax in terms of moderation. Most of us have our own shit going on in our lives, especially since we're mostly in our early twenties, and the sub kinda runs itself since we don't have any standards to moderate on, other than removing unapproved advertising and removing spam and hate speech the best we can. I think we all hold the position that we used to love this sub, but now, even we don't browse much at all because it does very little for us.

If there are any users who would like to be more engaged with this sub, but simply don't like the way it is in it's current state, feel free to hit me, or some of the other more active mods, up to discuss."

as for moderation nowadays, we pretty much just remove hate speech and such as much as we can. once the bar has been lowered, it's been harder to make a distinction as what qualifies as acceptable content since the quality bar has been thrown out the window."

as for 70k in loans, yes, debt bad, and yes its possible to go to a great company from a state school, but its much harder to differentiate yourself when you come from a state school (even berkeley when compared to a school like cmu) and 70k in debt is not a lot for kids who potentially make 150-200k right out of school."

cscareerquestions,fmu0vo4,t1_fmsskwb,1586382504.0,"I'm not in a hardware team, but our hardware teams are some of the best in the field and our compensation reflects that. A lot of software teams work very closely with hardware, while others are a bit more distant, but generally, people are very ready to collaborate and help. In my opinion, the biggest issue we have for collaboration here is knowing who to contact, rather than actually figuring things out with other people. We have the support to work very closely to hardware (we get most if not all hardware we need on hand, there's labs at all our major campuses).

In terms of technical excellence, our hardware is top notch. Our software, compared to other FAANG, needs some work (imo). I think overall, the company is trying to transition into being more software focused since we are traditionally a hardware company, and new standards are being brought up to ensure technical excellence. I don't think you'll find a lack of engineering talent here, or room for personal growth, but on an objective scale, a company like Google or Facebook definitely has a stronger software engineering culture.

People do transfer internally, but that's very dependent on your manager and how supportive they are of you moving teams. Good managers will help you transition, even if you are high impact. I think the bottom line is that it's definitely possible, but it's situational and you shouldn't bet on it since it isn't the ""norm"". We don't have a cultural norm here where people generally move teams every 2-3 years like some other companies, unless there is a reorg.

Side projects/open source are allowed, but you need to run it through your manager and legal to avoid conflict of interest, etc. There's a process for this that they present to you while signing your offer/onboarding.

In terms of company wide diversity, I'd say it's pretty good (or at least as good as it gets in the SV without forced inclusion). It's obviously a bit more male dominated, but I haven't noticed any glaring imbalances between race and gender. Between the team I'm on and my team's sister team, we have 4 white people, 4 east asian, 4 indian, and 3 hispanic. The gender ratio is 9 men and 6 women. 

Culture is secretive as a byproduct of our products being secretive. There's a lot of bureaucracy and red tape because our unreleased products and software are all bound by NDA's. For every piece of hardware and software you come across, there will be a disclosure for you to sign. In terms of team dynamic/culture that is dependant on org/team. For example, my team has very flexible hours and a very chill vibe since 80% of my team is under the age of 30. We're pretty much only expected to get our work done, and be available for contact between 11AM-4PM (since this is when meetings happen). I have team members who come in between 11-12 every day and leave after dinner, and others (like me) who do more typical hours (come in between 9-10, leave between 5-6). 

Work life balance not only varies from team to team, but also depending on time of year. For many teams, WLB gets worse as we ramp up to our annual releases (i.e. yearly iPhone/Mac releases and OS updates) since people are scrambling to get features in and tested, but is extremely laid back right after major releases. There are a lot of workaholics here, but I don't think it's the general expectation to work insane hours (I've stayed back after 9PM a few times by choice to knock out some work I wanted to get done, and almost no one was in the office).

If you have an offer, the best way to get a comprehensive view is to ask the hiring manager/engineers who are interviewing you about the team's day to day, and have these policies made clear to you from the very start, since it does vary from team to team.

And for anyone wondering, yes, we (as a company, some teams don't have any open recs) are still hiring."

LivestreamFail,fmqrcgj,t1_fmmzxer,1586305401.0,"That's not comparable.

Forcing someone with gender dysmorphia to conform to your social norms is the same as telling a schizophrenic person to suck it up because they aren't acting ""normal"", which is very much a dick move."
cscareerquestions,fmpb3c6,t3_fwi9pq,1586277694.0,"You do ""own"" the company in a sense though, since most startups offer equity. if the company does well, your equity can blow up exponentially in value, which is what motivates people."
cscareerquestions,fmm6m2s,t1_fmm6b3u,1586199739.0,the average family in the bay area working in tech can save more than 40k a year lol. whats ur point?
cscareerquestions,fmm5sa6,t1_fmm5jo8,1586199308.0,"yeah, 40k a year as a 22 year old. how many 22 year olds do you know are trying to buy a house in the bay area? also, you can save and buy a house elsewhere later on down the line?"
cscareerquestions,fmm2cym,t1_fmm2aap,1586197497.0,"no one said that? you can afford a more expensive house making 500k a year. 

for example, a house that costs 1.5m with 20% down and a 30 year fixed rate at 3-4% apr would mean a 300k downpayment and 5-6k a month to pay the mortgage, which is completely doable when someone's making 500k a year."
