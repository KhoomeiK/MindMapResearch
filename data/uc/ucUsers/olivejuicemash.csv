Berkeley was my absolute dream school but my GPA was on the low end and Berkeley just never seemed like a realistic option for me. Plus, I had already been accepted to Davis through TAG, which was my plan all along.

I was fully ready to start at Davis, roommate and all! The decision felt a bit difficult, especially considering the fact that I had to wait an extra semester to start. But I'm so glad that I did. Cal is something else, and I am so proud to be here. You should DEFINITELY accept your admission, you won't get any other experience like you will at Berkeley!"

 Personally, I love it and I've really been missing the in person lectures since everything went online. You can PM me of you have any questions :) also, congratulations!! Go bears!"
berkeley,fnrg0pn,t3_g3g2dm,1587187839.0,"Hey! I was a Spring admit as well, this is my first semester. While it is somewhat frustrating to have to wait extra time to start, it's totally worth it! 

Hopefully you accept your admission :) Cal is amazing!"

NoStupidQuestions,fnbgwnu,t3_fov4uu,1586815327.0,"I filed my taxes for 2019,  but my parents haven't. My understanding is that the government will use their 2018 returns to check their eligibility. The problem is that 2019 was the first year that I wasn't listed as a dependent, so on my 2019 taxes I am an independent, but my parent's 2018 taxes say that I am a dependent. 

Is it more likely that I won't be eligible even though I filed my taxes?"

Teachers,fn5xdg5,t1_fn5uy2u,1586679274.0,Thank you for this!! I'll be sure to ask my advisor about this as well :) anything to be more marketable
Teachers,fn5xa4j,t1_fn5uto5,1586679177.0,"I believe my minor is just more theoretical, but I will ask my minor advisor for more clarification on that as well!"
Teachers,fn5p0p5,t1_fn5ox9m,1586671134.0,Awesome! Thanks for your help :)
Teachers,fn5oanm,t1_fn5nf0w,1586670499.0,"Thank you! :)

I actually didn't know about getting a MAT until now. Is this route better than doing a teacher preparation program while getting my bachelor's? I would prefer to start teaching after I graduate with my BA, but I'm not sure if that's realistic or not."
interestingasfuck,flzlizt,t1_flzl9xg,1585626636.0,It's real scary. I have several friends who are uninsured and they have no idea what to do if they get sick
