AskMen,fpm6fwe,t3_ge3zht,1588726523.0,Not taking no for an answer. It’s unattractive in both guys and girls. It is in my experience a little more common in girls though
AreTheStraightsOK,fpj1oas,t3_gdeunb,1588654139.0,Imagine trying to take a picture with a significant other but you can’t bc there’s a height difference and neither one will lean bc you’re too alpha

politics,fpe46ct,t1_fpe1qm5,1588539992.0,"I’m not trying to debate whether or not they are able to or even should safely exercise that right, I’m simply saying that they in fact have the right to put peoples health at risk, which is demonstrably true"

ucla,foyqxw6,t1_foxsw65,1588177539.0,So it’s every students job to help others? Even if you’re not going to benefit?
politics,fox8jra,t1_forvdl8,1588136779.0,Don’t you know how much courage it takes to come forward as a survivor? What does she gain from lying? Having her personal life examined and scrutinized? Educate yourself
SandersForPresident,fox83dy,t1_fovmwy2,1588136433.0,I mean I don’t think they’re canceling it SOLELY because of Biden being the only candidate. I know it’s kind of a secret but New York has a few sick people right now if you didn’t know
destinycirclejerk,fov0nux,t3_g9pixi,1588093470.0,That’s a really good point. A lot of people don’t talk about these types of issues. Another unpopular opinion I have is Eververse bad too
AmItheAsshole,foo0zt4,t3_g8itkv,1587930369.0,I’m gonna go NTA. You ran with what info you had with good intentions. It just turned out that Cole is super awkward socially and has weird fetishes
DestinyTheGame,fome24b,t3_g81mxa,1587886677.0,"What an absolutely dumb take. It’ll be just like what they did with Thunderbird, Arbalest, all seasonal exotics thus far, and charged with light mods where they’ll still be able to be obtained. 

What I’ll know is that OP is either lying or stupid lmao"

Conservative,fo9pbc4,t3_g6e12r,1587626509.0,"Who is working 70 hours a week and struggling to make ends meet? There’s a million reasons for that. Is it your rent is too much for you? Move. Did you have too many kids? There’s also some absolutely legitimate reasons like medical problems in your family, but those are much rarer than “I wanna work a minimum wage job in the heart of New York and be able to afford a penthouse”. Like Jesus it’s not hard and they act like it’s all the same

Also I hope a lot of people refuse to go back. I could use a job when things start to reopen"

AskMen,fnn2at9,t3_g2nj43,1587082893.0,"My advice would be to either notice your feminine mannerisms (I suspect you do have some idea why they are), or let go the idea of being “one of the boys”. BE YOURSELF. If you’re happier being yourself, then be yourself. If not, fix what you need to fix. Ask some close friends what thy think and I think the answer will become clearer. Good luck! I know it can be hard to figure things out"
