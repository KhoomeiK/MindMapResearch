This is most likely the work of someone from TPC. I can't fathom anyone else this stupid and brazen to pull off something like this."

ucsccola,fmz5taa,t1_fmxpvbk,1586507532.0,"The COLA grad students were asking for an annual salary equivalent to someone who works 40 hours/week, when they only work 20. Also no grad student I know has been paid for their hours in research, so why should UC students be given extra privileges? 
The problems with the COLA movement lies in how excessive the demands of the grad students were, and the way negotiations were made. Taking the undergrads' education hostage is by no means a civilized way to demand something that won't even alleviate the underlying problem. Had the Chancellor gave in to the demands, there will be more strikes within the next several years as the housing market continues to go up."
ucsccola,fmpbkib,t1_fmo36lg,1586277925.0,"Between the UC and the strikers that would be a couple million dollars 'no'. If the UC decides to dispute the unemployment claims, there will likely be legal fees and class action lawsuits involved. :p"
ucsccola,fmo6pox,t3_fwepc9,1586247411.0,"It seems like the ones who sent put the email are from the SUA, not the grad students themselves. I think there was someone in an earlier post (Jeremy?) who claimed that they were involved in the COLA strike and organizing meetings around it. Some of them may also be the more radical members of the strike."
ucsccola,fmnuyvq,t1_fmnsu9m,1586236038.0,Can we please see the rest of it?
ucsccola,fmniy0z,t3_fw81nq,1586227126.0,Is this from an email?
