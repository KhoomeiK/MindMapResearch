uofm,fply8u7,t3_ge7cb1,1588721794.0,It is basically the cumulative MHP/cumulative MSH. Look on your transcript. I am talking about the columns MHP and MSH.
uofm,fpcziqt,t1_fpcz16h,1588516547.0,"I understand what you mean. However, you are still getting the credits towards graduating, and faculty are working to teach courses. Therefore, no reduction in tuition is really justifiable from the university's standpoint. Really the only difference between online classes, and in-person classes is having to pay room/boars for dorms or rent for off-campus housing."
uofm,fpcymmd,t1_fpcxy2p,1588515968.0,Very broadly means there will be options for students to go on-campus or take online classes (either is offered). Insteas of just one option over the other. But Michigan could possibly do this differently?
uofm,fpbe99h,t1_fp700gw,1588468002.0,"I didn't take it, but heard it is basically rehashed eecs 280 stuff, but in java. Also heard it is a lot of work for a 2 credit course, but the autograder pretty much tells your grade, and there is extra credit for submitting early. As you can imagine, eecs 285 is an easy A, but a time sink, and pretty bad information-wise as it is a repeat of eecs 280 in a different language. But look at the course projects. I think one was a budget tracker and wheel fortune. If the course projects align with your interests (android app design and basic game design, then maybe the info from eecs 285 is more useful for you?)."

uofm,fp9di6n,t1_fp8e4v4,1588423153.0,"sugs is a masters+bachelor. Usually takes 5 years, but op can possibly get both in only 4 year if he/she can keep a 3.6 gpa with no gpa boosting classes."
berkeley,fp7b2we,t1_fp54d38,1588367292.0,"Glad to hear it. :) Also, I meant to criticize the lack of socializing towards the people you brought up in the op, not you. Sorry if my post sounded directed towards you."
uofm,fp747un,t3_gbo3po,1588363750.0,"This is basically a long-winded ""we are thinking about it"". If you are asking for my opinion, then hybrid is the way to go."
berkeley,fp4s1bo,t3_g8an1k,1588305947.0,"I don't go to uc, but I heard it is ultra competitive over there. Is this true, because I don't want to make any assumptions? I am not defending these types of people, but just thinking it may have something to do with the competitive atmosphere? I heard it is so bad at uc that people will rarely help one another out, so they can secure a higher gpa (which is absolutely ridiculous, imo). Like why go to college, if you don't want to meet new people? (I am not the most social guy, but I do enjoy meeting new people) And since CS is such a popular major nowadays, I would think that there would be a higher chance of people trying to set themselves apart from the pack by getting a higher gpa (guessing?). Btw, I am an ee not a cs major, but I have lots of friends that are cs majors and some (mixed responses) already say that people tend to not talk to one another. One guy even switched from cs to ce (not a big change I know, but still) during his junior year (so he would be a senior in cs if he continued right now) as cs major, and one reason was b/c he didn't like the people surrounding him. My point is that if this type of thing is happening at a less competitive school (the uni I go to) than at uc, then the competitive atmosphere at uc would only make matters worse (in terms of the things u listed)."
EngineeringStudents,fp26szz,t3_gat5dg,1588256297.0,Good luck!
uofm,fp067ah,t3_gak4uk,1588203239.0,"Having an understanding of trends on the periodic table, such as atomic size, electronegativity and formal charge is all the knowledge from chem 130 that kind of helped me in chem 210 when learning about good nucleophiles, but this may be more of a personal thing. However, these are things you can look up online, so no need to take a whole class for them. Plus, you will be reminded of these things in chem 210 (by remind I mean that you won't be taught in lecture, and will be expected to understand these things. But these are things you can ask in OH)"
uofm,fozqm1m,t1_fozqebb,1588195153.0,"Oh, good shit. lol"
uofm,fozpmf0,t3_gah1p6,1588194659.0,Loling because James Juett just posted something related to eecs 280 final exam cheating on here (satire).
uofm,fozp4fh,t1_foz9a7m,1588194412.0,"Definitely not impossible to graduate in 4 years. It all depends how you use your time, and what you want to do during your 4 years here. If you want time to go to parties and do side projects, then it would be better for u to get as many credits as possible in hs. He/she is right to warn u that eecs classes are time consuming, and difficult here, though. So do what you can, but don't feel bad if you can't maximize your ap credits."
uofm,fopdf4g,t3_g8a282,1587958709.0,"The only ""realistic"" school I would pick over uofm is Carnegie Mellon U (but even this is a close call b/c I didn't like the location or campus of cmu that much, and the engineering program at Michigan is just as good (other than cs, but not really my interest, anyway)). I say realistic schools b/c ivy's, mit,and Johns Hopkins were extreme reaches for me. I didn't even bother trying to apply to mit. Thinking back, I prob wouldn't have picked an ivy anyway cause the eng program at michigan is better than the ivy's. But I was a hs senior back then, so idk how I would've reacted if I got an offer from upenn or harvard, lol."

uofm,fnw8tt9,t1_fnw7tm7,1587313724.0,"One thing I would say though is you need to able to learn the concepts extremely quickly, but I guess that is a given for anyone taking spring/summer courses. You have half the amount of time to learn the same amount of info, as if you were to take it during the fall or winter."
uofm,fnw8emx,t1_fnp9g15,1587313489.0,"Ok, thanks. Would you agree that EECS 285 is too much work for 2 credits? I heard it is 4 projects (first one is easy though), one budget tracker, one qheel of fortune, and another tef ball, and in-class quizzes. And that it is basically rehashed eecs 280 information for Java."
uofm,fnw7qcf,t1_fnu0muw,1587313106.0,"Doable. Have taken both courses. Not at the same time though. But I took math 215 with physics 240 (harder than chem 210), which was difficult, but doable."
uofm,fnp49rw,t3_foehwb,1587138949.0,"Which flex tech is more useful? IOE 201 (Economic Decision Making; only first half of term) or EECS 285 (Java class; full term)? I heard 285 is a lot of work for a not too useful class, according to some friends that are cs majors. I am an EE major, btw. And only plan on taking eecs 280, as a program heavy class."
