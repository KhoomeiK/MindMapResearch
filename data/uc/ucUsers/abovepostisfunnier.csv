apple,focdxft,t1_focaqra,1587670182.0,A lot of people in this sub truly do not understand what the average phone user wants. So many of my friends still use their iPhone 6 because they’ve paid it off and it does everything they want it to do. Most people just aren’t overly concerned with having the absolute best phone they can have. And really if you’re browsing Facebook and Instagram and taking selfies how much power do you really need?

AnimalCrossing,fne2x88,t1_fndw0li,1586882116.0,"Well yeah you can buy extras but my point is you don’t need tickets to get a mysterious wallpaper or mysterious flooring. Not sure why I’m being downvoted for this. Like yes you can get a different set, but you don’t NEED to buy a ton of rugs to be able to get a wallpaper and flooring from Saharah. 

From IGN:
Mysterious Wallpaper - $3,000 Bells or 5 Tickets
Mysterious Flooring $3,000 Bells or 5 Tickets"

Coronavirus,fmxfavd,t1_fmxf53s,1586463916.0,"That’s fair, but just be aware that by offering food all the time that can actually make dogs less likely to eat, not more. 

I get that lol. My dogs are super weird too."
dogs,fmxedbs,t3_fxzfoj,1586463421.0,"Your dog has extreme behavioral issues. You either need to invest a LOT of time and money into extreme training, or put him down. I know that is a heartbreaking, horrible decision to have to make, and I will likely get downvoted to hell for it, but behavioral issues like this do not get solved without extreme measures. Some dogs, just like some people, are not capable of being rehabilitated. And rehoming the dog just puts others at danger.

At the very least, neuter him. It doesn’t always help, but it might. And you need to stop letting him walk anywhere near others. He is officially a dangerous dog, and you need to treat him like one. He cannot be around children or anyone who isn’t aware that he may bite."
Coronavirus,fmxdx7a,t1_fmxc7c5,1586463178.0,Are you free feeding? You should just offer meals twice a day. Free feeding causes obesity in dogs.

That literally came from the department head? Have you considered that maybe there was a plan change, as this information was from before we knew all of the courses would be virtual? “smh kid” Jesus get over yourself, indignant child."

JUSTNOMIL,fme4d7r,t3_fuanhx,1585988830.0,"Ugh I’m sorry but I really hope you take a step back and realize how gross it is to complain that your MIL won’t give you tons of money for a party and because of that you don’t have savings in a pandemic. This just reeks of privilege. If you can’t afford the wedding you’ve planned, that’s on you, not your MIL. You’re not entitled to her money for a party, and you should be cancelling this to save money and save lives. Go to the courthouse and get married. Ask yourself if you want a wedding or a marriage."
