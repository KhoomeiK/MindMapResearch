That way if they break the law we can hold them fully accountable and hit them with the wrath of the law like anyone else would be.

Maintenance not only would include taking care of the systems from wind corrosion but also making sure the panels are clean from dust so they can efficiently capture sunlight, and many other confounding factors. 

Also people wouldn‚Äôt lose power at night, solar panels store energy with that taken into account but the whole idea of all those solar panels being there is still very much impractical."
