AskReddit,fongodb,t3_g88ccd,1587919139.0,"I used to have this monkey doll that doubled as a photo holder ever since I was a kid.  My mom put it on my bookcase shelf and it was positioned facing the bed, so I could kind of always see it before I went to sleep. For whatever reason, it‚Äôs black eyes started to creep me out and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like I was being watched by those creepy little beady black eyes. I didn‚Äôt want to say anything because it is a cute photo of my dad and myself, but man that doll creeped me out constantly. It got to the point that I started to turn the doll around to face the wall before I went to bed. 

One night I was visiting home for winter break after my first semester in college. Freshman me was beat after finals and there was nothing more that I craved besides 12 hours of deep sleep. Of course, I turned the doll to face the wall as I had done in high school. I got into bed and for whatever reason I draped my arm across my eyes and fell asleep. In the middle of the night I woke up to what I thought was someone deliberately stroking the underside of my arm with one finger over and over. I thought it was my younger sister pulling a good prank on me (she‚Äôs done some stupid shit to wake me up to play games), and I was so mad because I hadn‚Äôt slept at all throughout finals season. I whipped my arm off my face and sat up and yelled her name asking why she‚Äôd woken me up when she knew I was sleeping. 

Then it donned on to me that that my room was still dark and lit faintly by the moonlight. I looked at my phone and it was 3AM on the dot. I guess college changes you, I was so fed up and stressed out that my reaction was to get mad. BUT, I noticed that the monkey doll was turned sideways. Nobody was in my room and I just went back to bed. 

Told my mom and threw that doll out the next day. Fuck that shit"

ucla,fnrrkak,t3_g3hvk5,1587198884.0,"If it‚Äôs within your means, I can not recommend purchasing an iPad for studying more. 

Like many others have stated, using the iPad to take notes has definitely changed the way I studied for the better.  The pros are that I only use it for work/school and everything is conveniently located in one work-only device that I won‚Äôt get distracted on. 

I personally use Notability which has been a great tool for me to import all of my lecture slides, write, draw, and import my weekly readings on. You can sync everything to your google drive so all your info is saved in multiple spaces, and you can set the iPad on night mode which essentially reduces blue light (think less eye strain).

ucla,fn0x16v,t1_fn0ufbf,1586550410.0,"From my perspective, I can only speculate (as I‚Äôve tried to distance myself from USAC proceedings since my time in it). However, I think that a large part of our lack of voter participation stems from this sort of...anti-USAC culture that seems to percolate throughout the student body. People seem to immediately write off USAC as a joke, yet complain and gossip about the ongoing scandals which don‚Äôt change much year to year. 

At the end of the day, I do believe that USAC can have the power to affect GOOD change for students on campus (eg voting to fight any hikes in tuition or payments that they try to sneak on us like this, and much more). 

Ultimately, it boils down to the need to recognize that we live in a bubble. Political engagement is very real and does happen at local levels. But it only happens when people care enough to vote. I remember in my APUSH class like 4 years ago, we discussed how the power of democracy start with people coming together to hold discussions and vote. Case in point: voting in elections and for regulations that affect our daily lives on campus. 

I think voting turnout will only change when people realize that there are those in office who do care about students, and we vote for good individuals to change the face of USAC/ political culture on campus, as well as hold them to a higher level of accountability. 

If we don‚Äôt do anything, then we are reflective of the greater political schemes going on right now in Washington. In the democratic process at any level, we are supposed to be voting for our representatives are we not? If we take no action and only the 8%(?) determine elections, by not voting, are we not electing our masters? People who make decisions for us that we may not like, may negatively affect us, and ultimately get away with their actions?  USAC has what, $2M that come from expensive student tuition? This money goes to our elected student offices in the form of stipends. You‚Äôre paying them, so why not pay for someone who‚Äôs going to invest in the Bruin community?

Anyways, I‚Äôm only as woke as the next undergrad lol, BUT if there‚Äôs one thing to take away: VOTING IS IMPORTANT. Please vote for the candidates you believe in, please vote for an accountable Election Board/Chair to keep candidates in check, please vote for an accountable Judicial Board. Your voice matters."
