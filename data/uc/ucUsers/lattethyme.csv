kagepro,fpkvim9,t3_gdww5k,1588701761.0,"i haven't been as into kagepro for years now, but i agree with the other comment about the anthologies! they're made by different artists, iirc sidu and wannyanpu did comics too. they're fun glimpses into how people interpret these characters you've gotten to know so well. idr the title, but my favorite anthology comic is haruka and takane going to a maid cafe at school. it's such a short, sweet story.

also back when i was full-blown fan i would watch a lot of fanmade amvs on youtube and nnd. [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCflDcgO3uA) is one of the ones i remember fondly."

UCSC,fp78d1e,t3_gbocv4,1588365896.0,"i didn't take this class during the summer, but like the other person said, you're given sections to work on each week with hw for each one, and every 2 weeks there's a quiz. there's no lecture you have to go to as it's all recorded. definitely pace yourself, i usually did 1 section and 1 hw a day and i'd be done in 2-3 days.

idk how they're going to do the midterm and final since i took it in-person, or if they'll have it at all, so i can't really say much about that. :("

UCSC,fowj2p8,t3_g9yja0,1588120758.0,i suggest watching trevtutor's discrete math series on youtube; sometimes it helps to get a second explanation on something. and if the textbook's book of proof there's a pdf of it online.
kpop,fov67cf,t3_g9or3g,1588096035.0,i love the choreography of this song SO MUCH. the part in the thumbnail where they roll her along conveyer belt-style amazed me when i first saw it. and the fact that this is just a pre-release...i can't wait to see what else she has in store.

i also love seungkwan silently watches over his members. while i was watching the going seventeen stream, especially the mbti episode, when dino walked into the room after the whole mannequin thing, i noticed that he was fixing dino's shirt. i've also seen him fix others' hair.

the way mingyu is six-foot-two and yet sits in the smallest way possible is so funny, lol. it's like he's aji or bobpul."

UCSC,fodh3yz,t3_g6x8kw,1587684615.0,rcc and crown aren't really that close to science hill compared to 9/10. i'd either go with 9/10 or maybe consider kresge. :) it's a five hike from there to science hill!
seventeen,foc0x5m,t3_g6re96,1587665889.0,"my absolute favorite that i have bookmarked on my laptop is woozi's solo vlive from 2018 where all he did was 1) talk about marvel movies, 2) brag about his high score in this one mobile game, and 3) spent the rest of the time listening and singing to anime ops/eds from when he was younger. the fact that he knows butter-fly made me really happy. he's just absolutely endearing.

my fave group ones are always the andromeda, especially when they play games that descend into absolute chaos. the calculator game is just too funny!"

UCSC,fnm99d3,t3_g2lzpw,1587067308.0,"the buses are pretty hit or miss depending on the time of day, but if you know different routes to take you can walk to classes. if we're able to be on campus next quarter, you could try and find the ones that work for you!

that said, rcc is on the pretty far side of things; you can def walk to science hill where most labs are, but it's not that easy imo. you could take the bus but again, it's unreliable unless you block out a time to wait and take them.

in general the college themes really just apply to the core class you take for one quarter and that's pretty much it."

UCSC,fn7yute,t3_g05y98,1586730403.0,"i think a part of it is coming into them as a freshman. it's your first year as a college student, you got three classes to worry about, how do you manage your time, stuff like that. it can get overwhelming, but after some time you figure out what works and what doesn't work for you.

i think it'd be good to have a strong hold on the basics going into 20/30. also start programming assignments early! you never know what bugs you'll run into. for the calc classes i did ace. i was taking the online ones so the program helped me stay on track with what i needed to know that week and the review session before the final helped a lot. if you can, take up to 2 major classes and then leave your third class as something easy; mine was taking japanese. sometimes you just need to take your mind off of coding.

once you get the hang of things, you'll get through them in no time. :)

edit: one more thing. google and youtube are your best friends. if you don't understand what's going on, find a yt vid or two on the topic; it helps to get a different explanation. if you run into errors copy+paste it into google. find stack overflow links with the problem. the answers are out there if you look for them."

UCSC,fn5g9se,t3_fzpgfp,1586664078.0,"kresge's under renovations so idk what they'll be doing about letting people in but from my experience, having an apartment is nice! you share a bathroom with like 6-8 other people but for me that's better than sharing it with an entire floor. having a kitchen is nice too, cooking can get tedious but i thought about it as getting used to living on my own.

the thing is that kresge is real old and it's really showing its age. you have to clean a lot more than just a regular dorm room, like the dining table the coffee table and all that. but having an apartment as a freshman is a pretty cool. :)"
UCSC,fn3ydl3,t3_fzbb7q,1586630356.0,"from my experience at least, my cs classes have been all over the place, mostly at the media theater. it'd be hard to pinpoint a place where it's easy to get to classes. but i'd go with the other comment in 9/10 too since it's a pretty central part, plus that has pretty good dining hall hrs (and not just bc i work there lol).

regardless, you can be social in any part of campus, i feel. no matter where they place you, as long as you put yourself out there, you'll find people"
