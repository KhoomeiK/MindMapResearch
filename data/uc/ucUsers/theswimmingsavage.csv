berkeley,fmxfwca,t3_fxyzi4,1586464230.0,"If paulin is teaching, take it. He's been the best professor ever. That said, I took AP Calc AB in high school and retook it my first semester here (Calc 1A). Some people recommend skipping around or taking at community college but only you can know your math skill. In addition, fall might be online so perhaps taking calc 1a in fall could be safer. Ultimately, up to you but i found playing it safe helps me out."

berkeley,fmsy7ws,t3_fx4zor,1586363862.0,I would say there’s not enough information. I can just as easily imagine a world where masks are mandatory on campus and gbc+dining have no contact food stuff like they did just before shelter in place.
worldnews,fmfzp9x,t1_fmcyy4c,1586038235.0,All I’m saying is you overestimate your leverage in regards to the government. They are the ones in charge of the world’s largest military after all.
