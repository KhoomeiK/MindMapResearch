I haven't gone through and sorted out my files in a while bc I'm busy enjoying it lol, but this has the unreleased and the sessions and demos. Enjoy. Lmk if you can think of anything I'm missing so I can get my hands on it.

PCOS,fo6wh01,t3_g60zo2,1587568016.0,"I use Xulane, which is a weekly patch with progestin and estrogen (3 weeks with 3 diff patches and then a week off where you get your period). In my experience, it's worked really well to reduce acne and hirsutism and to regulate my periods with minimal weight gain (maybe 5-10 lbs... even though none would be desirable). I used to get my periods *maybe* every 6 months but as soon as I started the patch it worked itself out until I stopped using it. My endocrinologist wanted me to use it as a 6 mo. booster to see if it would jumpstart a more regular cycle but it didn't do that despite it being reliable in regulating my period while I was on it. 

I will say that the patch is annoying if you plan on working out because if you get too sweaty then the patch might move a little in a certain direction and then your hair will get caught on the glue. It's also supposed to be skin-colored but I'm light brown so that doesn't help... but it's not like anyone but my boyfriend sees it anyway. Overall, the downsides aren't really that bad and I have no problems using it and have found it to be SUPER reliable.

I suppose it's also effective at being a contraceptive because I never got pregnant, but I wasn't really in it for that part of it and it's not like we don't use a condom anyway. 

9/10 would recommend \[only not 10/10 because weight gain is one of the things that cuts me deep, even if it's just 5 lbs, but that's a personal issue lol\]"

PCOS,fnnmluz,t1_fnna4k2,1587095978.0,"Yeah I'm going to approach it naturally from now on since I just finished my last 6 month booster course of birth control. The last course didn't work to regulate my period in the long run and I doubt this course will either. But I'm looking forward to not using it anymore. Let's get those gains and make the most of our condition.

Much love and take care. Wishing you all the best."

PCOS,fnl5aic,t3_g2dgy2,1587047266.0,I've been starting to suspect this bc I've worked out during diff periods of my life when I'm either on birth control to regulate my periods or just letting my testosterone run free and it's just not the same. On birth control I tire more easily and just generally can never get a good workout in or gain any muscle but when my testosterone is running freely I gain muscle super quickly and can trim down all my fat. It's crazy but it makes me hate BC even though it's doing a good thing for me.

TheWeeknd,fn2a5kr,t1_fn1usdn,1586582256.0,"I've seen the moon phase logo catch on more than I've seen the dice logo. The dice logo theory was in the more early stages of this chapter's release but ever since the merch came out I think the moon phase is the prevailing logo. It also looks WAY better and fits his current state way better than the dice imo. Someone just posted an image of it on here a couple days ago so look around for it... but I remember they had it in red and I prob would've put it in blue so it wasn't the same as Starboy.

Where are you getting it tatted and how big?! Sounds dope af. 
Just make sure to leave room for future albums. So get the piece done in a really open space if you can. Some guy posted his tat of this image before this chapter came out and he hadn't even left room for it or any others. smh"
ucla,fn29m8f,t1_fn1r8q9,1586581789.0,I'm actually in his Coldwar Central European Culture course (not one of the specific classes you were asking about) so I was just speaking on my experience so far with him as a professor.

ucla,fn0fpgd,t1_fmydd32,1586541095.0,"Yeah for sure! I think our midterm is to analyze a poem. So my thoughts are that the readings for his class are used as background info for what's going on in the world during whatever time period the class is on and practice analyzing works about the setting and topic. Just ask someone in the class for their notes on them. Prof's lectures breakdown the readings.

I'm not sure how ""required"" the readings are other than writing a paragraph on 1 of 3 questions he poses about them in the discussion forum.

That's the setup for our class (Coldwar Central European Culture). I guess you could technically get away with not reading."

I've already read 1 and a half books and a poem and Week 2 isn't even done. But the books are alright so I guess it's not that bad."
