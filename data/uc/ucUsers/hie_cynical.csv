UCDavis,fom3tvn,t3_g84sxq,1587877558.0,I feel horrible. Wasn’t even able to complete one of my timed midterms because I just didn’t know the information at all.
UCDavis,foigm78,t1_fof6mec,1587786175.0,Thank so much for your in-depth answer. It’s given me a lot of insight on what to expect.

At this point, I’m trying to use up my stash because of the environmental impact of sheet masks."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fnam5zj,t1_fnadp6e,1586799894.0,Yup this works. A lot of boba places offer basil seeds as a topping. It’s similar to chia seeds and it helps me when I want to drink boba with my friends without the added calories of the boba pearls themselves.

UCDavis,fmcimrx,t3_fub1xo,1585946394.0,"I live in Malcolm in Segundo. There is one small kitchenette per floor. Although it’s only an oven, microwave, and a stovetop, it’s really nice to have access to a kitchen at all. Some dorms in Tercero don’t have a kitchen, but you can always go to a nearby building to cook."
