ucla,fpivwe3,t1_fpittgc,1588649948.0,"You know what man, fair enough. I think this election in particular has been stupidly polarizing, and so its impossible for  people to not get real worked up when a paper that's meant to speak for the students en masse takes any one side or the other"

ucla,fphejex,t3_gdhuos,1588619878.0,"As the USAC President, are you allowed to blatantly try and sway a vote like this ON the election day? This seems like a really unprofessional thing to do, using your offical title and letterhead to try to guilt people into voting for this Referendum. Deadass, doesn't this violate some sort of bylaw?"
ucla,fpffb65,t3_gd4owa,1588569563.0,"As someone formally working for USAC, I can confidently say that some of them (perhaps even most) do not try all that hard at all, often run unopposed, and only want their stipend and something to throw on their resum√©"

It's pretty easy, you basically just listen to music all day and the exam is him just playing it over a speaker and you have to identify the artist in a multiple choice format. The exam was long as shit, though."

I also had a 3.55 transfer GPA, but for history. I can only assume that means my essays were pretty good, because my grades weren't spectacular

Edit: forgot to mention, but all the above makes me super tempted to view my file, but I've heard that its underwhelming and usually blank"

ucla,fn79q5g,t1_fn619lt,1586716048.0,"First of all, the quip about never leaving the dorm is in poor taste, for the circumstances we're in. Second, I have (had) an on-campus job and I did not make that much, and certainly did not have the other benefits they have. Third, I was a member of USAC and you simply went to the events, so I definitely know how much work they do. I'm not speculating, I'm telling you that the oversight is so laughably bad that many members did not know what they're were supposed to be doing, because they weren't assigned anything. God help you if you were an intern, because then you were passed around the various committees on a weekly rotating basis, and again, were often not given an assignment, and even if you were, it didn't matter because you only had a week to do anything. My committee once went 2 weeks without hearing from our Chair at all, and that isn't uncommon. We spent an entire quarter creating a 2 page brochure of clubs on campus -as instructed- only for it to be tossed to the wayside and never brought up again. But I watched them give 110% when it came time to plan for USAC Retreat with food and alcohol (illicitly) provided. You have a massively inflated sense of what USAC does, because they insist 24/7 that they're God's gift to students. It's better that you speak only about what you know, from whatever years you were here. Evidently, it's different now."
ucla,fn4k06b,t1_fn4ijv2,1586642945.0,"I consider $244 per week during the academic year / up to $10,000 for the year + 20% off at campus stores + first picks on parking permits to be pretty lavish dollar amounts for volunteers who do little else but beg for more money, maybe you don't. But I suppose you may be a USAC member, otherwise maybe you wouldnt be this wound up about it."
ucla,fn4i8il,t1_fn4hp7a,1586641919.0,"You're missing the point. USAC is decidedly not a business, and USAC officers not employees, but volunteer public servants. As such, they should not be getting such lavish stipends and benefits. It dilutes their purpose."
ucla,fn3skft,t1_fn2ucsl,1586627087.0,Are we talking about a business with employees or a student government with volunteer officials?
ucla,fn3sad1,t1_fn2qofi,1586626933.0,"Surely. USAC officers shouldn't be on the payroll at all. They're volunteers who decide their stipends aren't enough and raise them, seemingly each year. They should get nothing."
