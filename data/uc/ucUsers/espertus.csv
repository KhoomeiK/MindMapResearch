girlsgonewired,fpafnhn,t3_gbt6ze,1588447184.0,"I teach CS at a minority-serving women's college, Mills, a few miles away from UC Berkeley, and things are so different. Almost all of the faculty and student are womxn, we have ethnic diversity, students collaborate instead of competing, classes are small, we talk about the imposter syndrome and sexism, etc. Our top grads get jobs at the same places as UCB grads: Google, Twitter, Salesforce, etc. I feel very fortunate to teach somewhere that is explicitly feminist.

I know most of you have already been to college, but I'd encourage women looking for colleges to consider liberal arts colleges, especially women's colleges and minority-serving institutions."
berkeley,fpa6uxq,t3_g8an1k,1588442004.0,"I teach CS a few miles away at Mills College, a minority-serving women's college a few miles away, to let you know that things can be different and that UCB students can cross-register at Mills.

I know that people at research universities often look down on liberal arts colleges (I was ignorant about them when I was at MIT), but our faculty when to top universities (MIT, Princeton, UCB, etc.) and our grads get jobs with companies like Google, Twitter, Salesforce, Facebook, etc. What's different at Mills is:

* The faculty's primary focus is on teaching. We are professors because we want to teach and mentor undergraduates.
* Almost all of the CS faculty and students are women, transgender, nonbinary, or genderqueer.\*
* Our CS faculty are ethnically diverse (including Hispanic, African-American, Asian-American).
* We have small classes (usually 10-25 students) where it is safe to make mistakes.
* We talk openly about the imposter syndrome, sexism, etc., and how to deal with them.

\*Our undergraduate programs are nominally single-sex (nonbinary- and transgender-friendly), and our grad programs are coed. We have post-bacc and Master's programs specifically for people who got their undergraduate degree in something else and want to switch into other fields. At least one of our students came to Mills after getting an undergraduate degree in the humanities from UCB where she had been discouraged from studying science.

You seem to know that the problem is with the UCB EECS culture, not with you. Best wishes to you and others trying to make EECS a better place."
