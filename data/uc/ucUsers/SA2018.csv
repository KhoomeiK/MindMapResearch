UCSC,fp3w1lj,t3_gb29bn,1588286866.0,I would argue that Crown/Merrill are better than 9/10. Merrill has some of the newer dorms and the area is generally quieter than most other parts of campus. Many people there are study-oriented.

UCSC,fn932kl,t3_g0cv66,1586757777.0,"I can't answer much about the Crown dorms, but I would definitely recommend Crown or Merrill for you. Merrill is also very quiet and has dorms that were renovated in \~2015, so they are pretty good. If you put Crown and Merrill as top 2, you will likely get one of them. If you don't get either of those, you can't go wrong with College Nine or Ten as your third choice.

Cardiac Hill isn't bad. An advantage is that you get downhill walks to *every* class, and it's not too far away from classes in my opinion. I got used to walking up the hill very quickly as a freshman."

UCSC,fmuw0oq,t3_fxk1zg,1586400134.0,doable. CSE 12 and CSE 16 overlap on occasion which is nice
UCSC,fm6jt4z,t3_fteay4,1585795693.0,"That depends. What are your attitudes towards drugs and alcohol? Do you prefer a quiet, more introverted vibe or a more party-esque extroverted crowd, or somewhere in the middle? Are you someone who heavily prioritizes academics and studying over socializing? Would you rather have downhill walks to classes but have to walk home up a steep hill, or vice versa? How important is the proximity to the gym, or proximity to Science Hill for you? There are likely other factors I haven't mentioned.

Also, there is a lot of information relevant to your question already on this subreddit if you search for it."
