ShitPostCrusaders,fplytgh,t3_ge00sf,1588722117.0,"Incest because they both have a common ancestor that dates back to fairly recent in the grand scheme of things. If I found out I fucked a guy who was a direct descendent of my great great great great great great grandfather I‚Äôd probably have a panic attack. Scientifically, the distance may be great enough to not be considered incest but ethically it still is."

Lymphocytes do, but the body considers them ‚Äúinterlopers‚Äù and over rights them. Considering that a majority of DIO is Jonathan‚Äôs body, it‚Äôs also a majority of Jonathan‚Äôs DNA. That‚Äôs all his organs, tissues, and mussels that are compromised of thousands of cells each with nucleotides jam packed into one tiny nucleus."
