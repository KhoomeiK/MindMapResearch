UCSD,fpbreyv,t1_fpbrajo,1588476847.0,"No, I would be starting as a junior again, I took off Winter and Spring quarter."
UCSD,fpbpoyj,t1_fpboke0,1588475628.0,"Yes transferred to UCSD from community college, as for the reasons listed in my post I decided mid-November to apply to other CSU's and UC's."
UCSD,fpbogxh,t1_fpbnvua,1588474783.0,"I agree with your post completely. It's funny I actually came here with an optimistic attitude and unfortunately, that dwindled but that's why I wanted to make it clear that these are my experiences. I didn't want it to seem like I was comparing schools."
UCSD,fpbnfg7,t1_fpbn9fw,1588474076.0,Yes!
UCSD,fpbn057,t1_fpbm8wg,1588473791.0,Can you elaborate on what you mean by the timeline? Like the timeline of when I applied to the schools? If so I started applying to UC's and CSU's mid-November and private schools over winter break.
UCSD,fpbl37p,t1_fpbk3n7,1588472495.0,"I wasn't here to advertise; I stated in the first sentence that I made this as a response to the large number of dms I got asking these questions. I also never said that I thought other schools were ""much better"" if that's your perspective of the other schools, that's your inference not mine. I just hope to have better experiences at those schools I applied to."
UCSD,fpbjrox,t1_fpbj869,1588471622.0,"I completely understand why some people get mad though so I don't take it personally; it's good to have school spirit and take pride in what they've accomplished such as attending UCSD, but to neglect or deny the flaws an institution has for the sake of pride is silly. And thanks!"
UCSD,fpbjd1m,t1_fpbipvj,1588471358.0,":) Some pros: The math department was awesome, discovering food around the area was great, the beaches, and I met some chill friends. From what I heard the bio department offers a lot of opportunities for undergrads.

Yeah, I don't mind sharing an experience. I remember the first instance of racism was during Fall Y'all when I was walking down by Cafe V when a group of white kids were yelling at me to go back to Mexico and were sarcastically asking a bunch of racist questions with a Spanish accent."
UCSD,fpbfzxc,t1_fpbfx2v,1588469135.0,"Waitlisted at UCLA hahaha, but thanks!"
UCSD,fpbft2k,t1_fpbfn8o,1588469009.0,"I'm contemplating between USC, UCLA, UCB, and Cornell."
berkeley,foehczz,t1_foeh4mm,1587703805.0,Thanks! I will definitely look into it!
berkeley,foegtl1,t1_foegcoi,1587703423.0,"Fair point, I hope that'd be the case."
berkeley,foeg5nx,t1_foefvji,1587702953.0,"Sorry fixed my post, yeah, an unfair disadvantage to those doing in-person classes. Dang, I hope the university addresses this issue if they do go eventually go forward with the plan of offering courses online and in-person."
berkeley,foeeg1a,t1_fodxilh,1587701785.0,"Hi, I'm a recently accepted transfer for the Fall 2020 year! Did you take 61A at Berkeley or somewhere else? I have nothing to do this summer either and I'd love to take that course when I have a bunch of free time."
learnprogramming,fntqboh,t1_fntp6zs,1587246724.0,I've tried implementing that code into a method but nothing happens when I do.
learnprogramming,fntotf6,t1_fnto61c,1587245939.0,"Here's the entire code. I tried to modify it to what I believed would work in a method. Honestly, I'm not even thinking straight at this point I've been trying to figure this out for days now.

   Pane pane = new HBox(15); 

   Image image = new Image(""HelloMeme.jpg"");

   ImageView iv = new ImageView(image);

  pane.getChildren().add(iv);

   Scene scene = new Scene(pane, 550, 360);

   stage.setTitle(""Image View Pane App"");

  stage.setScene(scene);

  stage.show();"
learnprogramming,fntn2jm,t1_fntmsq8,1587244961.0,Well when I had that solely in the main method it would show the image so I figured it would do the same but I kept getting an error message. Then when I put it in the sysout statement it kept printing true.

berkeley,fnqpz9u,t3_g3dnp2,1587169687.0,Holy Crap! I just got accepted as a transfer student for Econ as well! CONGRATS!
learnprogramming,fn7o7lz,t1_fn7mo8n,1586724267.0,"Thanks, so what I'm understanding from this is that he wants me to turn the compareTo method into a method that returns an int. Ok, I understand he wants me to shift the burden of work but what to? And the part ""rely on enums compareTo results"" is still confusing."
UCSD,fn6aa04,t3_fzqi0x,1586693327.0,"Hey, I'm a bit late to the post but as someone that went to UCSD and is now transferring, I can chime in since lack of diversity is a big reason I left. First and foremost racism is a big issue at this school, and I don't mean blatant racism although I did experience two instances of that issue, but like you said micro-aggression. Both instances where students were being blatantly racist came from a group of white students. In terms of micro-aggression, the Asian student body tended to ""look down"" upon me is the best way I could describe it. White students just tend to make it obvious for the most part that they don't want to associate via their attitude; granted there are a lot of students so obviously not everyone is like this, I'm just sharing my experience. I'm not black btw but Hispanic which is also a minority here."
javahelp,fn4kjxb,t1_fn4jtkr,1586643269.0,"Thanks, I was confused because all the examples I was seeing online stated that they were void.

Edit: Apparently it's supposed to be a constructor not a void method."
javahelp,fn4e1ot,t1_fn4cj7c,1586639465.0,Thanks for the clarification!
javahelp,fn40t6w,t1_fn2owfa,1586631748.0,"Yeah, I'm a bit confused about the instructions as well word for word it says:

""In the case of this lab assignment, it could simply be a String object which is also a sequence of characters.

The class the lab asks you to implement, named Scrabble, is a container that has an instance variable of type String. The class also needs to implement the four methods required by the interface that are listed above.  When invoked the four methods operate on the String instance variable""."
javahelp,fn2bd1h,t1_fn2antz,1586583325.0,Ah yes ok thank you! That's what I was so confused about. Since the CharSequence interfce is already imported by default the assignment is just asking me to use its methods in the Scrabble class. Thanks for the reassurance!
javahelp,fn2abnb,t1_fn2950i,1586582404.0,"Thanks, you helped clear things a bit up. The one thing I'm still confused about is ""implementing the methods according to their definitions"". It was my understanding that you can only implement an interface. I'm familiar with those methods for example, I've used .length() to get the length of a string variable."
javahelp,fn2a0jw,t1_fn28vrq,1586582134.0,"Oh my god thank you! Ok, I don't know why the manual couldn't just specify that it's already imported by default. I'm familiar with those 4 methods I'm just not sure how to implement them. Right now my code looks like this:

public class Scrabble implements CharSequence {

}

but I get an error. So how am I supposed to implement four methods? Priorly I've used length() to get the length of a string variable for example but how do I implement that method into a class?"
CasualConversation,fmut59d,t1_fmursx7,1586398312.0,Nice! If it's any motivation I've already noticed a difference in my overall happiness after two weeks from doing the exercises! I already picked someone to talk to today but if you're willing to help me out another day that'd be awesome! :)
findfashion,ffffkwq,t1_ffeo6tt,1579882883.0,"Dang, they sold out. But thanks for finding it!"
