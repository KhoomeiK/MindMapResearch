Haven't tried the purito that the other commentor suggested but I've heard great things about it. Asian sunscreens ftw honestly"
SkincareAddiction,fphh2ft,t3_gdd9ht,1588621153.0,The Australian gold one (untinted) gives me the WORST whitecast. It's also hard to spread. I only use it under makeup or now that I'm quarantined with a lot of sun through my window.
ucla,fpd7kgp,t1_fpcfc4r,1588521472.0,Same boat. I saved some easy classes til this quarter for a grade boost and so my grades could look more like an upward trend. I'd be mad as hell if I had to take them all pass no pass. If you would've told me at the beginning of the quarter id be forced into p/np I wouldve talked to counselors to see if I could get my last requirement waived to graduate winter instead of spring. This quarter would be an utter waste of time if I had to do p/np

ucla,fp88hih,t3_gbreep,1588386156.0,"Honestly it's gonna be easier to sublease from someone than find someone to sublease for you if you sign and don't stay. I had a hard time finding a spring subletter even before school went online. You can try seeing if you could do a month to month lease or something shorter than a full year.

UCLA student legal services has a PDF suggesting what to do if you're signing a new lease on the notice of their website https://www.studentlegal.ucla.edu/"
ucla,fov9ujl,t1_fov79un,1588097768.0,My roommates were friends or mutual friends. My SO's were random but they were chill and imo guys aren't as bothered with an SO staying over as girls can be. I'd suggest finding them on a group page if you're really worried. Been a while since I filled out the housing preferences but I *think* there's a question that refers to guests. I mean UCLA doesn't/can't stop anyone from having overnight guests. Just make sure you're courteous with your roommates about it
ucla,fov6au1,t1_fov4lsz,1588096080.0,"We've always stayed over at each other's places, squishing into a twin sized bed lol. We were both in triples in dorms. Just let everyone know ahead of time that your SO is coming over. We had already talked to our roommates beforehand so they knew and were cool with it. Not sure what I would've done if roommates weren't cool with it but I went into roommate agreements being flexible with everything except price and ability to have overnight guests. If you want alone time in the room, definitely ask ahead of time so roommates can plan instead of getting kicked out."
ucla,foteq2e,t1_fotc317,1588051791.0,"I'm honestly not sure since I've never gone to the same college as my SO. I know that is true for some people while others still see each other every day. For me, I'd imagine I'd spend a few meals a week together."
ucla,fot91n1,t3_g9bmyj,1588047490.0,"My ex and current bf go to UCSD. With my ex, I saw him maybe 1-2 times a quarter because our schedules were so busy and neither of us had cars. With my current bf, I see him 1-2 times a month because our schedules work better and he has a car. What I will say is make sure you enjoy where you are. After the breakup with my ex I thought ""wow this is the first weekend in a while where I'm in LA and get to actually enjoy it"". With my ex, either of us would've gotten upset if the other wanted to blow off a weekend together to do something we wanted at our own college. With my current bf, we've blown each other off and been supportive and happier, definitely helps that we knew we'd be able to see each other a different weekend. It's sometimes hard to feel like you've had the full college experience if you're just trying to hold onto the ldr. 

I see you're trying to do a LA - SD LDR as well so here's what I posted  on the new bruin megathread: I don't live in SD but my roommates and SO do so we all go often. Join the facebook rideshare groups, it's the most convenient way. $15-20 a ride, usually pick up at the dorms and drop off at either UCSD or UTC corner bakery, sometimes willing to drop you off to your destination. I've also taken Flixbus from UCLA (also near dorms) and it takes multiple stops in SD including UTC and old town. My last resort way that I've taken 2-3 times is metrolink. I took the metro 720/20 to purple line to union station and took the metrolink from there to oceanside. Metrolink is the cheapest if you have someone to get you from oceanside. There's also amtrak from union station, it's more expensive but will take you to solano beach which is closer to UCSD. Flixbus takes the longest and came out to $15ish. FB rideshare page would be most recommended, fastest and most convenient. People tend to leave after 6pm on Fridays and offer rides back up Sunday nights."

ucla,foo115y,t3_g8jghg,1587930391.0,"Tues, Wed, Thurs at 6pm are the official practices. Distance runners usually meet on days off for easy runs but those are unofficial and can be done on your own. Saturdays, depending on the weather, are sometimes morning beach runs in Santa Monica. Saturdays also tend to be meet days (xc meets in fall and track meets in winter/spring) we don't host any meets but we attend meets with other colleges

You can email them at [uclaclubtrack@gmail.com](mailto:uclaclubtrack@gmail.com) if you have more questions, I can answer some (I was a jumper) but I'm not part of the club anymore. Their website doesn't seem to be updated since I updated it a few years back."

ucla,fnzrxq5,t1_fnu23tj,1587399692.0,"Everything this person said. Also, check bruinwalk.com for professor reviews. The better professor will almost always be in higher demand. 

Tip: Take the better professor over the better time. The inconvenience of an 8am or 5pm is worth a better professor."
ucla,fnzqo09,t1_fnybi63,1587399037.0,"DEM and AED are the premed frats. I'm not a part of it but I've had people from them in my classes. I hear they have a test bank (old midterms and tests) which definitely help in classes. It's also pretty nice that they basically always have a friend in the class so it helps if you're good at working in groups. That's just my observation. If you search either of them up, you can find their socials and reach out to them directly"
ucla,fnwbqzu,t1_fnw7w0c,1587315337.0,"Also PhySci but a year ahead of you. I got Cs in the first two core classes so I was on the border of getting kicked from the major. While getting good grades in PhySci is definitely doable (curves saved my dumbass), the amount of work you need to put in to get an A in PhySci versus psych is tremendously different. If gpa is their main concern, PhySci isn't the move.
Also their main bio things needed to be more micro bio things and physio is only being recommended (which they could get through PhySci 13) means they should look towards mimg and mcdb. OP won't get those courses in PhySci"

I'm not sure with Korean, but some language classes are hard to get into as a freshman. Maybe wait until next year so you can take it (hopefully your parents won't try to dictate what you take as an adult in college anymore)."

Edit: at least charge them enough to cover your deposit (in case they do something to the apartment to make you lose the deposit)"
ucla,fnbsmaw,t1_fnblafb,1586821511.0,"This. I got a refund from ucla before cause they messed something up.

ucla,fmu6293,t1_fmqihac,1586385255.0,"Not in a cluster but it's generally not recommended to take a cluster that is related to your major (so if you're a science major you'll want to avoid science clusters) since it won't really count for much.
I personally enjoyed being able to choose my GEs rather than taking a cluster because it allowed more variation in topics"
