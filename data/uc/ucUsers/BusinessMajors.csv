California_Politics,fpgpu8d,t1_fpgoet0,1588607328.0,"Isn't that what they do now? It seems like a trend since Obama days where they will dig up stuff and try to spin it negatively. It just became more clear after Trump VS Hillary campaign with the government letters, and sex ring, etc. There's the Joe Biden scandal right now too. It doesn't stray away too much from exactly what Trump did, but they'll grasp whatever they can and spin it badly."
csuf,fpgnrqc,t3_gd8rbx,1588606243.0,"I think it'll be in person only because every single school is saying they will follow what state law proposes and health guidelines etc etc... CSUF said the same. With protests and pressure from other states and Trump who wants to reopen it might just be the case. Also, depending on how bad the situation gets I THINK I heard somewhere that they planned for schools to reopen by August? Like K-12 schools. If  kids can go to school then us adult students would be no different. That's my prediction.

I hope it's online though."
csuf,fpf4kxi,t3_gd22gv,1588561639.0,"Usually when you make an argument/case you look at the opposing side too. I just want to bring up that the school gets more than 1/2 (I'm going to take a guess 75%-80%) of its funding from the state. Student tuition and fee's are less than 50% of the money they get. Refunding partial or even a bit of Spring tuition will not create drastic or even long term effects. It's just one semester because it was an uncontrollable change. At least for Summer and Fall students who sign up will know what they are getting into and paying for (even though I think prices should be reduced to accommodate, but this is a different topic). Also, like you said the school is getting around $20 million. Lets say they're giving students back a few hundred to a thousand dollars for Spring semester. From all this I hardly see any long term damages to infrastructure, projects, or faculties. I feel like the school is actually profiting if they keep the full tuition and the $20 million. We won't even know where that money will be placed or used. Back into the school or into their pockets? Million dollar questions.

The real damage will be caused if something happens to the school's payout from the state whether it be taxes, no one working in state office because covid-19, etc. That will cause massive layoffs, hiked up prices, etc. to make up for state funding issues."

No one wants to be locked in, but it's for the safety of you, your loved ones, and the people around you. Another month of waiting will not harm anyone. Reopening without actual strategic plans and protesting without protection will bring a lot more harm to businesses and people around you.

csuf,foz96f9,t1_foyshsu,1588186771.0,"I don't think it's the same. For your MD research paper, you are in control and have people who are willing/volunteer to gather information and do work for you. They are willing because of either a potential letter of recommendation, internships, resume building, possible name on the research paper, etc. On the contrary, in-class group projects some students literally do not care. They did not volunteer out of a passion to do this. Passing with a C is good for them and dragging others down is not their problem. Some even drop out within weeks of forming the group and never respond back and you're left doing their part of the work. Big difference in my opinion."
csuf,foz8jjz,t3_ga6cph,1588186467.0,"I really hate how group work is graded. It should be just your individual part. Group work doesn't teach you about teamwork or working as a team in the real world either. It just makes you more stressed and if you really have bad partners then you'll end up doing all the work yourself. If they really want teamwork then create a group exercise in class and apply critical thinking to it. In addition to group work, I also hate how some teachers still do assign seating like we're still in K-12."

csuf,fo914xl,t3_g6co86,1587608198.0,"I hope they think about people who live far away and have to travel long distances to attend school. If they do partial online and on-campus then students who are from afar will be royally screwed. Finding housing, moving, renovating, peers to share space with, airline tickets, shopping, etc. This takes months of planning beforehand to get straightened out and to do all that in the middle of the semester is TERRIBLE. Governor's orders can change on a whim especially if they decide to reopen and have to close soon after due to how bad it could get.

Many K-12 are closed for 2020. CSUF should take a firm stance on either opening or closing. I especially dislike the leash they are keeping on students. Aside from keeping everyone safe and healthy, they need to think about the struggles for students living afar. This is ridiculous."
