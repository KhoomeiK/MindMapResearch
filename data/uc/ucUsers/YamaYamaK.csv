summonerschool,fosp1pl,t1_fos13dt,1588035112.0,"In my point of view you have a few options:

1) stick to what you’re doing, except whenever the enemy jungler makes a play try to do something on the opposite side. For example if the enemy Lee Sin ganks top, look to do anything botside. Doesn’t necessarily have to be a gank, maybe go for a solo drake, maybe counterjungle a few camps. This makes sure you don’t fall too far behind of the enemy jungler in plays. Then, aim to outperform the enemy jungler in teamfights since you’re shyvana and the enemy picked a non-scaling ganking jungler.

2) switch to a ganking jungler, and aim to get your lanes ahead just as the enemy jungler is doing. In this scenario, check if you would win the 2v2 between you and your nearest laner and the opposing jungler and the nearest opposing laner. If you don’t, avoid that portion of the map unless the opponent is missing summs or something. If you do win the 2v2, play around that part of the map. When the the teamfights start happening, both you and the enemy jungler will be playing for utility unless you get an absurd lead.

And for the record, there is no elo where you can trust your laners to not feed, lane difference exists at every mmr."
summonerschool,foq584t,t1_foq4n6x,1587983448.0,"I don’t disagree here, an early game focused jungler is probably more intuitive for new players and also probably teaches the game better. I was just disagreeing with your claim that farming junglers are not viable in higher mmrs."
summonerschool,foq3z9v,t1_foq2y89,1587982154.0,"Karthus is definitely the poster child of farming junglers though lol and he’s notorious for being an S tier jungler for like a year now.

When someone says farming jungler, from personal experience they mean champions like Karthus, graves, master yi, shyvana, sometimes taliyah or kindred. Half of those picks do fine in high mmr, and the other half don’t, so I don’t think it’s fair to group them all up and say that farming junglers can’t keep up in high mmr. I actually think the jungle is in a pretty good spot right now in terms of class balance, no type of jungler is edging out others excessively like what we saw with scuttle meta."
summonerschool,foq2sef,t1_fopyq2j,1587980904.0,"This isn’t true, players near the top of the ladder play farming junglers too. Tarzaned has multiple accounts in high elo, using champions like Karthus and Graves a good portion of the time."
leagueoflegends,fopli1y,t1_fop6myv,1587964708.0,They would have to have the same passive name or else mages get to have 65% mpen lol
summonerschool,foo546g,t3_g8ky10,1587932680.0,"I recommend you check out some Shen OTP streamers, you’ll be surprised to learn that he can beat many of the champions you listed even after level 6.

Also this is a side note but the champions you listed would generally be classified as juggernauts, not bruisers."
summonerschool,fonzywx,t1_fonxy74,1587929800.0,"The main reason why easy champions are recommended is because it’s easier to tell when you make a mistake on them. For example, if you’re playing sylas and you get ganked and die, you have a harder time knowing if it was a mistake to stay there or not. This is because you have to consider so many different ways that you could’ve played the gank (which R to steal, which person to target, running or turning, whether it’s worth to W in before disengaging for the hp or not). On the other hand with champions like annie, it’s very cut and dry whether it was possible to survive the gank or if you should’ve not been there at all. It’s very hard to improve when you don’t even know what mistakes you’re making."
summonerschool,fony86k,t1_fonxyvv,1587928822.0,"I agree you can’t calculate the value of grasp vs other keystones, because they function differently in ways that are hard to compare. I just took issue with your use of argument from authority, especially authority that is tangential to the main point at hand."
leagueoflegends,fonwv5g,t1_fonwpqa,1587928052.0,"In that case, you can press zhonyas after he puts his fear tether on you, and he’ll end up wasting it and won’t have it up when you ult him"
leagueoflegends,fonu8sf,t1_fons5d5,1587926570.0,I would recommend building zhonyas if an enemy Nocturne gets fed
leagueoflegends,fontdf6,t3_g8j22e,1587926082.0,"Olaf outduels pretty much every champion in the game in the first few levels except maybe Warwick, I’ve never seen that matchup myself. Other champions you mentioned like Xin or Lee don’t have as much dueling power, but they also have better utility in gap closers"
summonerschool,fonrbyq,t1_fonqfqg,1587924949.0,"I agree, that would be a better point since the authority is more relevant to the topic at hand.

Appealing to authority really isn’t a good argument in the context of things that aren’t directly done in game though. What I mean is many high ranked players aren’t high ranked because they itemize better or because they make better runepages; they’re generally there because they have better mechanics and/or game sense. Recent situations with LS challenging what people have considered to be optimal for so long illustrate my point pretty well imo."
summonerschool,fonpg5x,t1_fon65d8,1587923911.0,"I mean if we’re going to use appeal to authority we should be looking at the builds of people at the top of the ladder as opposed to the builds from pros, since we’re playing in soloqueue.

Since top soloq players like Saber and others have argued for taking exhaust, it very well could be the best possible build (in soloqueue). It also goes without saying that ADC is a stronger role in coordinated play, and so it wouldn’t be that strange if players need to run different strategies to make up for the different circumstances in soloqueue. We also saw a bunch of ADCs take TP in pro play a while back, but it was never a dominant soloqueue strategy. It doesn’t seem to make sense to always use pro play as a reference to what’s good and what’s not in soloqueue"
KaynMains,foidz1t,t3_g7lwx7,1587784438.0,I like the idea from a gameplay standpoint but it’d be kind of weird if Rhaast is already at 75% but Kayn is still talking normally and looks as though he’s not already mostly corrupted. I feel like they’d have to get new models (similar to how Khazix’s model changes depending on the evolves) and new voicelines to really execute on this idea
XinZhaoMains,fo2v1co,t1_fo2uwga,1587474774.0,"The meta build atm is Warrior into Trinity if ahead, Cleaver if not, into tank items, so I think your build is pretty solid"
XinZhaoMains,fo2u9k0,t3_g5epia,1587474239.0,"Imagine an irelia that couldn’t reset her Q. That’s basically xin zhao, and in exchange he has high duelist potential. Since he’s a jungler and has poor clear speed, he will also be down in levels unless he pops off early game (which means you have to play for early game). This means that you can’t split since you’ll be outdueled 1v1 by a higher lvl opponent. he will largely play for the teamfight, but like I said before he’s an Irelia without the Q resets meaning he has problems getting on people and sticking to them. So, he ends up playing for his utility in teamfights for the most part, which isn’t his strong suit, so he isn’t very good mid-late game."
KaynMains,fnsb95s,t3_g3me87,1587217725.0,"In general, it’s better to build AD than full tank since you heal based off the damage that you deal for the most part. Try not to build too many armor items.

That being said, sometimes some enemies get fed and you need armor to not get bursted. Here’s when to buy which:

Tabi’s are the boots you should be going for in most situations, especially since Legend: Tenacity is easy to fit into Rhaast’s runepage.

Death’s Dance after the changes is good on Rhaast as a core item imo. Building it is good, especially when ahead.

Randuin’s are a good purchase when the enemy team has high attack speed/high crit. And the slow can come in handy.

GA can be an option if you’re very fed. BF sword, Chain vest, and stopwatch are all good components but the stats overall are low for an item of its price once it’s completed so I don’t recommend it in most games.

Deadman’s is only good if you have trouble approaching the enemy team, otherwise Randuin’s is generally better.

Thornmail is an alright item, but if you’re looking for grievous wounds Executioner’s is better because it’s cheaper than Bramble and you have a consistent way of applying it with your AoE physical damage.

Don’t buy Righteous Glory or Frozen Heart"
karthusmains,fmvrqjx,t3_fxnsy2,1586428376.0,"The best rhythm is 2 Q’s into 1 AA then repeat. Let’s say you’re starting at red buff. You should start with an early Q that hits as soon as the buff spawns, buffer an AA, then Q as soon as the AA leaves Karthus’s staff (you’ll have to practice this timing), kite back, then Q again, then buffer another AA then repeat this 2 Q’s and 1 AA pattern.
If you’re looking to shorten your clear time, make sure you’re holding your E for as long as possible without missing out on mana, do gromp + blue at once, and kite towards your next camp"
UCSD,fmsdale,t1_fmrelpu,1586353005.0,Why are you getting downvoted?
karthusmains,fm3qrf6,t3_fsw3aa,1585733457.0,"If being invaded is the main problem, try to start on the opposite side of the map as them. For example, if you’re blue team (bottom left of the map) and you know the opponent jungler will start at their blue, you can start at your own blue so that when both players are done clearing you end up on opposite sides of the map and you don’t have to run into the other jungler.

Another way to mitigate this problem is to practice your clear to do it faster. If you do it well you should be able to full clear in around 3 minutes, potentially faster with a good leash. If you’re done clearing before they come to invade, then there’s nothing for them to invade.

Don’t focus too much on farming though, since some people see the karthus pick and assume that no ganks will happen. Most lanes are gankable with the right setup, especially if your teammate happened to pick a champ with hard cc."
