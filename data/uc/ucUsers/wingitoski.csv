berkeley,fp8qny8,t1_fp8fm0p,1588399851.0,"Interesting question as it made me reflect on what I wrote. While my life style isn’t exactly like this, I just recount what I often see at Cal and the overall dynamics. As more of an introvert, I tried to steer the imagination to describe someone who is more extroverted but I think I overdid it so that it might not be relatable at all to some people. I think my intention is to paint a picture of social harmony and involvement, something that a lot of people, including myself, are deliberately seeking out for in this quarantine. I also wanted to include some details of what it’s like to just enjoy the campus on your own and how lonely but rewarding it could often be, but I wasn’t sure if that would be relatable, perhaps too cheesy haha"
