ucla,fnrkhff,t3_g3fsje,1587191837.0,Lol what about people with 40hr week office jobs who have been slowly dying in front of a computer screen all day for years.

ucla,fn8vxan,t1_fn69ucs,1586751681.0,"And your self centered view of the world also shows you dont as well. You are comparing $45 out of pocket when someone who works to support students, i.e. CAPs but they have to be fired because the free mental health services (and that's probably a $40-60k salary) The services provided to students at no cost or cheap dont even compare to what people pay for those services after graduation. I get your upset, (and I'm ignorant to how USAC operates), but i dont think anyones trying to steal from you, they're trying to come up with solutions to keep the university and all of its services available now and when students return to campus. If you havent checked, people are unemployed all across the nation and the university and decision makers are trying to keep the lights on. What is your solution to the massive amount of debt the university will be taking on? I know for sure the government is not going to bailout universities. If you have ideas, share them, instead of just criticizing the only one put forth so far."

ucla,fn5vmwr,t1_fn040e5,1586677484.0,The demand to provide more services is always increasing (when campus is open) and the risk of layoffs is very real right now for thousands of employees. The whole college system can topple pretty easily.
ucla,fn5vi81,t1_fn0hyfy,1586677350.0,"Comparing to other universities' fees, it's still less than other UC's (I think minus one). I'm not making the decision if its alot or a little, I'm just looking at what other UC's charge for fees and saying UCLA pays wayyyy less. Now when you're upset CAPS cant see you are UCLA, but you can as UCSD, you know why."
ucla,fn5vbqa,t1_fn0xfuj,1586677168.0,"You make some heavy assumptions. I paid for college on my own while having 2 kids and a part time job... so yes I know the struggle. You may be right, but do you own airpods? Do you have any luxury you dont need? How many times have you eaten out this year, rather than preparing a meal at home?  Let me tell you this, a college degree doesnt make the struggle disappear. I have a masters degree and work at UCLA and we struggle. Hows that for reality."
ucla,fmz9x6z,t3_fyaxfq,1586512231.0,"I do want to point out that there are thousands of full time people who serve the student population, with families. Everyone is struggling to adjust and try best to provide campus resources remotely. Recreation has been busy adding online content free of charge to students who would normally have to pay for fitpasses."
ucla,fmz9q3j,t3_fxy4rl,1586512002.0,"Just so everyone here understands, while not all student fees go toward campus service departments, minimum wage does raise AGAIN in a few months. Some student fees go toward supporting the student work force. Without any kind of balance, the system can topple. Less services equal less jobs, which then leads to greater financial need and difficulty for many. Think about the campus as a whole and not as just you. $45 more per year is not that much. PLUS I believe UCLA has the lowest student fees of all of the UC's. Want more mental health services, more gym space, more community outreach opportunities, funds are needed to support and assist these."
