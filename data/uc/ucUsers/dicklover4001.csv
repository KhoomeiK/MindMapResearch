UCSC,fp7sob8,t1_fp78d1e,1588376977.0,"Hmm yeah it‚Äôll be interesting to see how they do tests. I had a stats class last quarter and we did them online due to the strikes and COVID... but that class was very chill over all and was kinda an easy A anyway. I hope I don‚Äôt need ProctorU or anything for summer. 

Anyway, thanks for the info!"
UCSC,fp7sj39,t1_fp73mi5,1588376894.0,"This is so super helpful!! Thank you, this sounds a little scary but makes me feel way better about it overall. I appreciate it! :)"
UCSC,fp55drp,t3_gb7izm,1588316859.0,"I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre completely changing the system this year and there won‚Äôt be early group selection. Super unclear. Offices haven‚Äôt been especially helpful :/

Good luck, I hope we keep our housing guarantee"

Showerthoughts,fnweaqs,t1_fnvokaz,1587316737.0,"Personally mine flares up at certain times, usually about once a month. I use the Apple health app to track it, and some weeks I‚Äôll use my inhaler 6-10 times per day on average, other times I‚Äôll just need it once or twice a day, When you have time and things are less crazy def get it checked out because it could be a lot of things especially if it gets worse with anxiety, but also I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unusual to have to use it sometimes more than other times if it is just asthma. Also, make sure you‚Äôre living in as clean a space as you can... mine gets worse in a dusty room or whenever theres any kind of perfume or candle. I hope you feel better ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Showerthoughts,fnvavni,t1_fnu2sda,1587286402.0,Have you gotten checked for asthma? I lived with it for a long time before anyone even believed me and gave me an inhaler... makes life 1000000x better.

Also, they‚Äôre gonna ask who you want for roommates around May 1st, rn you basically just need to say which college you want and what room type. It doesn‚Äôt matter when you do it as long as it‚Äôs before the priority deadline ends (around the 20th)"

UCSC,fmpk33n,t1_fmpfgrg,1586282244.0,I also feel like no matter what it‚Äôs a little safer of a look if you leave it just a tiny tiny bit longer on the top than it is on the sides.
UCSC,fmmhtbq,t3_fw4k7p,1586205521.0,Do you get a refund from amazon if they return it to sender? Or can you just have them reship it?
UCSC,fmmhqb7,t3_fvzwpy,1586205479.0,"I only just got my refund yesterday. Yours should already be dispersed to the school (mine was actually all sent in in September and they process 1/3 of it per quarter), so they already have the money so you shouldn‚Äôt get charged even if it‚Äôs not showing up yet. As long as you have accepted enough financial aid/loans to cover the cost, you shouldn‚Äôt have fees. It‚Äôs just slow processing right now."
UCSC,fm3bsiv,t3_fskzr4,1585718403.0,My classes have been so amazing I feel so lucky that things are starting to look normal and I‚Äôm starting to have a schedule again. I love my teachers already they‚Äôve obviously put so much work in!!
