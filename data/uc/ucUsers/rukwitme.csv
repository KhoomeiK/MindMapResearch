Be blunt with him. Would it help to have a meeting with someone that could prevent him from being a fuck ass? 

Also, document everything. Send him an email saying that you are thankful to have worked with him, but that you'll be going to Davis for your studies.

Come to Davis! I was just admitted too!"
