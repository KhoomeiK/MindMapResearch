UCSD,fpbl1gl,t1_fpbkh4i,1588472462.0,I’m regretful OP experienced racism. Could be something to report to admin!
UCSD,fpbk3n7,t1_fpbjrox,1588471841.0,"It’s not denial for the sake of pride, it’s a matter of opinion. I could say your decision to advertise your transfer and how much better you think schools you haven’t attended are is pride itself. Wishing you the best of luck, and surely appreciate the subtweet."
UCSD,fpbhopf,t3_gcghg8,1588470251.0,"The salt stings!! Conveniently leaves out the pros for “space” while the post is a huge ramble regardless. It’s undergrad. As someone going to grad school this fall, we’re not talking about huge differences vis a vis quality or employment outcomes between the public universities you mention. I encourage most prospective undergrads to treat this post like the hill of salt it is, coming from an alumni & freshman admit. Also, you can have a social life, the city’s nothing short of amazing, Greek life’s chill and unique, but the Bistro’s sushi is whack."
