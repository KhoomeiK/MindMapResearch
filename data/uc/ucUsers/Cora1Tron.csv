UCSD,fpjhjuy,t3_gdlehb,1588668741.0,The time was definitely limited. I finished with only a few minutes to spare. Luckily the exam was fairly easy so there really was little need to review.
UCSD,fpb1u02,t3_gcbh2c,1588460333.0,Does anyone know how long it will take from the time it shows up in the acc to the time you get it via direct deposit.
UCSD,fovragf,t1_foss5on,1588106163.0,I did not. I even called and they were basically like “well you got accepted so idk what to tell you.”
UCSD,fosof4j,t3_g9bwhx,1588034744.0,"Welcome to UCSD. Sending out acceptance letters with information requiring an app that no longer exists is v much in UCSD style. I never even got a physical acceptance letter, just the email/portal one."
UCSD,fogtm1k,t3_g7c25q,1587756837.0,So basically what we’re learning is that CSE 100 staff are the ones who have been hoarding toilet paper?
UCSD,fmyxtk6,t1_fmyqxfi,1586499178.0,Oh that’s actually a good point. I am not their dependant
UCSD,fmy4uw8,t3_fy3uqi,1586478159.0,"They generally don’t ever come into buildings. As odd as it may seem, the raccoons understand their place in the UCSD community. It seems that having  lived around students their entire lives, they know they will be welcomed and sometimes fed if they are out in public, but likely quickly removed and attacked if they enter buildings. I lived in warren from Sept-March of 19-20 and even though the doors in Stewart hall never closed (they were broken) raccoons would walk up only to the trash cans outside and never go inside. They are docile animals and you have nothing to be afraid of. Goodluck :)"
UCSD,fm4zf3v,t1_fm4n0kx,1585763518.0,Cause everyone at this damn school has no legitimate social skills. Y’all need to be able to interact with other humans irl
