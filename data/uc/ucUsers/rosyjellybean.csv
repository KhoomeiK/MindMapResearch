Politicians in the South have been fucking their citizens over for almost a century if not longer. 

Hopefully more people vote or change how they vote based on everything that’s happening, but I’m skeptical."

UCDavis,fnbzcx6,t1_fnby3c5,1586825372.0,"For lower-division coursework, he'll probably be looking at 1-2 essays per class, anywhere between maybe 3-8 pages, and maybe short close-reading assignments, online discussion posts, and a decent amount of reading. Actual assignment requirements for length and workload will vary notably based on the professor (definitely recommend checking out ratemyprofessor whenever you register for a class, though some people may have an axe to grind) and the subject, e.g. some classes may have you reading the entirety of Paradise Lost (though I would highly recommend any of Tobias Menely's classes on it) while others may be short story based.

It will be a handy resource to him for next quarter and going forward to check out the [English department's courses and schedules](https://english.ucdavis.edu/courses-schedules) page. He'll be able to review past syllabi and requirements/workload as well as find upcoming courses offered during the year. It's great for planning out your quarters/years as not every English class is offered every quarter, some may only be offered once a year or every other year.

There's also [a courses page for the History department](https://history.ucdavis.edu/courses) which you may find helpful and interesting if you're curious about seeing some of the past course offerings and future ones as well."
UCDavis,fnbggw8,t3_g0el3b,1586815104.0,"Organizational studies specifically at Davis is supposed to be really great if you're interested in business/management. Even if you might change it, I'd recommend looking through their website more closely to see how it compares to SCU's program."
UCDavis,fnbg5f2,t3_g0cqyp,1586814945.0,"It's pretty fantastic. I entered as an English major and decided to double major with History in my second year. The unit requirements for a fair amount of the humanities/social sciences majors are reasonably low so it's very feasible to double major.

The workload is usually a couple/few papers for each class in place of traditional midterms (or there may be one midterm still) and written finals, sometimes take-home. Lots of reading. It's definitely very manageable if you're interested in the subject and enjoy reading. I don't know a ton about internships/opportunities within the department personally, though I'm sure there are some and there are many campus opportunities generally that may be of interest (e.g. the Global Learning Hub, our study abroad office hires peer advisors, writers, and such; we also have a lot of study abroad programs w/ good aid/scholarship opportunities and other global learning opportunities). All the faculty I've had in History so far have been incredible, some of the best professors I've had overall with really engaging material and lecture styles. 

Feel free to drop me a message if you have any other questions about History, study abroad, etc!"
UCDavis,fnbex2y,t1_fnb77u7,1586814320.0,"I'm taking 25 (20 of which are upper division) right now and it's manageable because my professors all have scaled down workloads and expectations for classes in light of the current situation.

I think it ultimately depends on the subject material, but I'd generally expect or at least hope that professors would adjust accordingly considering the last minuteness and chaos of it all. Instead, a lot of people are facing what seems like increased workloads and unnecessary busy work to enforce participation, most of which doesn't seem to be helping with learning which theoretically ought to be the point of it all. 

I think most of OPs complaints hit the wrong target, but I've seen and heard a lot of people struggling right now with more work than they would have normally in the respective classes, and that doesn't make any sense considering that it's a global crisis affecting hundreds of millions and all. I think having to do school from home exacerbates how it feels, but still."

news,fmtsoyf,t1_fmsuk7j,1586378334.0,"This country has done a pretty good job at making people feel like their votes don’t matter. Hats off to the people in charge, they’ve led people to believe they have zero power which perpetuates the shithole we’re in.

As a result, it upsets me when people act like the problem lies entirely in the youth vote. Often, people respond to this problem by attacking and criticizing us (visible in comments on this post alone), as if there’s not some kind of systematic reason behind why we aren’t politically engaged in the little time we’ve even been alive.

Neither of my parents have been active voters for the majority of their lives, and instilled within me the idea that voting doesn’t matter. But I voted anyways, and then convinced them why they should give a shit.

But a lot of young people haven’t necessarily found that moment of agency, if they’ll find it at all. Years of negative reinforcement makes it difficult to break out of, especially when a majority of young voters are poorly educated about the issues - no help from public education in most cases, which does an astonishingly bad job at teaching about US history and politics (and political history especially) - and have little broader context of recent times, while also often struggling to put themselves through school and dealing with the general hardships of being a living young person in an extremely chaotic and hyper-stimulating world. 

And yet people constantly blame us, as if tens of millions of middle-aged people also do not vote while the consistently higher voter turnout of old people are more likely to be retired and have had decades to figure their shit out.

In my experience, more negative reinforcement doesn’t really help fix the problem. It’s exhausting to be constantly blamed, and it tends to lead to further unwillingness to participate."

Coronavirus,fmpf5d9,t1_fmp65m0,1586279734.0,"Yep, so far what I’ve come to discover is administrators are the #1 cause of bureaucratic  and often immoral bullshit in working environments.

Especially in health care, administrators (at least here) often have no medical experience and are paid to keep making the hospitals and clinics the big bucks, so they constantly undermine patient care at almost every turn while waging battles on health care professionals trying to give patients quality care safely."

also maybe not every human on tinder wants to just meet up and fuck? i’m well aware that’s where most are coming from but not everyone is, and it’s well within their right to do so 

acting like she’s a bitch for not wanting to fuck him right off the bat, generally or in these circumstances, is maybe just a little bit of a red flag idk"

UCDavis,fmka9c5,t3_fv381q,1586148681.0,"I’m in the Honors program here at Davis and can affirm it’s very possible to apply and be admitted to our’s here as a freshman, especially if you’ve been admitted to a program at another school.

I can also affirm from working at the study abroad office and from going abroad myself that our programs are numerous and very easy to apply for and get aid for. All the work that Global Affairs does makes us the best UC and likely one of the best schools in the country for global learning opportunities, including study abroad and much, much more.

If you’re at all curious about either and you’ve got questions, feel free to drop me a message."
