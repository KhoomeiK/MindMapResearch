LifeAdvice,fpb2rsb,t3_gcf3kz,1588460897.0,I can see where your coming from. I think the first thing I would suggest is that you work on yourself. Instead of chasing people that you want to be friends with become the person they would be attracted to. Work on yourself and work on your self confidence. And also itâ€™s important to realize that some people might not like you as youâ€™d want them to and thatâ€™s not your fault and neither is it theirs. Also find things you like doing and youâ€™ll find people who you like as well. Itâ€™s hard with this whole quarantine thing but I hope you work through it.

LifeAdvice,fp0635i,t3_gag7n2,1588203178.0,"Find what motivated you then to keep doing things like that. If those motivations arenâ€™t there, then make yourself do something you think youâ€™d enjoy. Over time the progress you make will make you proud of yourself. Sometimes we get up in our heads too much. Hope this helps. :)"
