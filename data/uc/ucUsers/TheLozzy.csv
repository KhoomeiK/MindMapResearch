We still have issues with the department of course (trouble hiring profs), but I have overall enjoyed my experience here!"

UCDavis,fmm73m7,t1_fmm6q29,1586199998.0,"UCSD is well-renowned for its CS program. But honestly, all going to a better ranked CS school does is open more connections. For an industry like Computer Science, what matters more isn't the school one goes to, but rather how well someone can program and experience."
