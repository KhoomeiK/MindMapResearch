southkorea,fpab4c0,t3_gcamsf,1588444496.0,"South Koreans(South Korean nationals to be more exact) are not allowed to travel to North Korea let alone freely ""talk"" to North Koreans unless given authorizations. I say ""talk"" in quotes because the SK government asks that people report any contact with NK citizens. But there's nothing really stopping SK ppl from talking to NK people. If and when you do travel to NK, NK gov will have designated personnel to ""guide""(more like stalk and observe) you every moment of the day. You won't need a translator. They'll have someone with you every second of the day."

southkorea,fnyd6ve,t3_g4ic2i,1587359677.0,"Word on the street is that ESPN has approached KBO for broadcasting rights.

As a Korean, I am both excited and worried for the broadcasting of our baseball.

Our games are fun to watch in person--our cheering culture is awesome and very unique/active.

However, the quality of our games compared to US teams--not so good.

I am a Dodgers fan (been since 2006)  and when I watch KBO, I cry all the time.

I used it in Germiston last year (Apr-Aug, 2019) and it was OK.
Not game-worthy for sure because of ping and all but I was able to watch YouTube and Netflix fine.
Averaged 2~3mbps. Peaked at 4.x mbps once or twice."
