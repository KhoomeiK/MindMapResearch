I’m not a CPA but California doesn’t have a state tax reciprocity agreement so my understanding is that nonresident employees (i.e. telecommuters) would have their income withheld based on CA’s tax rates rather than their home state, assuming the work address is in CA. 

If I’m wrong though it would be cool. Wouldn’t mind moving out of the Bay and telecommuting myself

Edit: not headquartered but office location rather"
