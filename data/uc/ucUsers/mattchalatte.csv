UCSantaBarbara,fphhv8m,t1_fpgnfyx,1588621556.0,"yes thats true but for summer, everyone at each class standing's pass time starts a 9am, so the difference between #10 and #100 on the waitlist could be a only a few minutes"
UCSantaBarbara,fpblwev,t1_fpb82ne,1588473049.0,"Its things like this.. if I hadn't wasted time going through my notes to find the name of the ""phenomenon"" I would've had more time for other questions."

UCSantaBarbara,fpb1rze,t3_gceadb,1588460300.0,theres a groupme!
UCSantaBarbara,fpar08p,t1_fpaq7as,1588453899.0,idk what other justification there is besides a mistake in the wording of the question bc wtfff
UCSantaBarbara,fpakwp6,t3_gcbom0,1588450282.0,also why were there no extraction calculations
UCSantaBarbara,fpajwkc,t1_fpaiot1,1588449696.0,"If the quiz is only fifteen points then missing one question knocks your grade down more than it normally would, but that should reflect in the standard deviation. So being 20% below average is only missing like one additional question. We also only know the average for two graded quizzes so far so you never know with this one"
UCSantaBarbara,fpajooh,t1_fpaiprb,1588449567.0,"yess exactly, with lower averages theres more room to demonstrate knowledge"
UCSantaBarbara,fpagl92,t3_gcbv4g,1588447738.0,"Don't worry! thats what the curve is for, it'll help you more in the long run than having high averages. Theres no use in stressing until you know how the rest of your section did."
UCSantaBarbara,fp3v0ra,t3_gb46qz,1588286323.0,"i get the iclicker questions and book problems but some of the quiz questions seem to kind of come out of left field. each one also is worth so much, like missing a three-point question already puts you at an 80%"
UCSantaBarbara,fok6a0a,t3_g7p39z,1587836172.0,whats the point of doing that its not like that midterm was hard enough to weed anyone out
UCSantaBarbara,focr670,t3_g6uex0,1587674763.0,"i would take 109C in the summer because if you take 6al online, you might have a hard time in 6bl if you have to take it in person"
UCSantaBarbara,fo37vsd,t3_g5aqt8,1587482189.0,how low do the averages need to be in order for us to get a curve?
UCSantaBarbara,fnnzr8j,t1_fnnwpcd,1587106953.0,can we pleasee do this? the grading scheme made sense when everyone had a time limit but since we all get two weeks to do each lab it really is just going to come down to nitpicky things like that
UCSantaBarbara,fneqgzx,t3_g19gbh,1586894027.0,stem units hit different than regular units
UCSantaBarbara,fn99j3p,t3_g080q1,1586764301.0,i signed up for 6c over the summer (which im assuming will be online) since geller is teaching should i just wait for fall to take it with freund?
UCSantaBarbara,fn8y2dm,t3_g08j9m,1586753406.0,pm'ed you!
UCSantaBarbara,fn52hbr,t3_fzmu5d,1586654356.0,"im stressed about that lab, im worried itll be curved down since we all have so much time to do it"
UCSantaBarbara,fn4zlyl,t1_fn4s7nv,1586652479.0,on gauchospace it looks like the lowest quiz gets dropped so that should help
UCSantaBarbara,fn4umtz,t3_fzk5o2,1586649335.0,"its just hard to narrow down what we should know from gen chem/109A, like thats 4 quarters worth of material"
UCSantaBarbara,fn4fq0w,t1_fn4d7ji,1586640455.0,im sure that class is going to fill up REAL quick for summer since itll probably be online
UCSantaBarbara,fn4bjfs,t1_fn2czfv,1586637994.0,"i agree, freund did us a huge favor by making the class way easier than it normally is and people are taking it for granted"
UCSantaBarbara,fn4b980,t3_fzccd6,1586637828.0,"my biggest worry is that when we come back to campus, professors (especially for STEM majors) will make classes harder to ""weed out"" the people who got by this quarter and last quarter by cheating"
UCSantaBarbara,fn49s6b,t3_fzejge,1586636962.0,it would have been so hard to take this class as a senior three years removed from gen chem
UCSantaBarbara,fn1b275,t3_fyphc6,1586558360.0,this really sucks because the people who were sharing quiz answers ruined it for the people who used the groupme as a resource for general course questions. if more and more professors catch on they could make our quizzes harder or shorten the time limit
UCSantaBarbara,fmwqf4w,t3_fxpd55,1586451196.0,yes
UCSantaBarbara,fmu2d3h,t3_fxfeyr,1586383278.0,you gotta be really smart to balance the time commitment of partying AND being a top public school
UCSantaBarbara,fmtjuom,t1_fmtgbrm,1586373963.0,"if you dont understand how frustrating this is im sure you probably haven't had aue as a professor, let alone for an online class"
UCSantaBarbara,fmtbgir,t1_fmt3aa9,1586369939.0,i am so sorry i honestly dont even know what to tell you i had him for 109a and even though the content was easy the lack of structure was what made the class harder than it needed to be
UCSantaBarbara,fmszqo9,t3_fx8eyi,1586364553.0,yikes is this aue?
UCSantaBarbara,fmrj5ui,t3_fwygdn,1586324804.0,"shoutout to econ 10a, eemb 2 lab, and all the other classes that arent being offered this quarter"
UCSantaBarbara,fmp0sf1,t1_fmmll2o,1586272217.0,I dont know how I'm supposed to teach myself not only what is in the textbook/videos but ALSO all of this extra stuff that isnt in the book? How were any of us supposed to see this coming and confidently answer some of those questions?
UCSantaBarbara,fmp0hjr,t1_fmmwgad,1586272050.0,gainers quiz was definitely harder
UCSantaBarbara,fmnd0oi,t3_fwai3t,1586223294.0,"i feel like the information is everywhere, so much of it contradicts itself and its hard to tell how slides relate to one another"
UCSantaBarbara,fmn4xlo,t3_fw9o8p,1586218290.0,is geller for sure teaching summer? it says TBD on gold
UCSantaBarbara,fmmlmrj,t3_fw6lmx,1586207535.0,it sounds like lewis's quiz was easier even though both classes probably wont be curved
UCSantaBarbara,fmm8y3q,t3_fw3br8,1586200985.0,does anyone know if it fills up as quickly as it does during the regular school year? im assuming itll fill up faster than usual since itll probably be online
UCSantaBarbara,fm61ned,t3_ftav50,1585784418.0,"and the fact that the discussion sections are ""optional"" even though they really arent because were going to be tested on the articles were discussing"
