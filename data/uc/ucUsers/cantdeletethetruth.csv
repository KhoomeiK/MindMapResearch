ucsccola,foraerb,t1_for9z7x,1588008894.0,Exactly. I cannot imagine this level of selfishness and entitlement. Itâ€™s insane.
UCSC,for8wzi,t3_g94lc1,1588008175.0, Now they want to fight for a raise to 40k per year plus free tuition and health care. For working a temporary job for 20 hours a week while on their way to a PHD. Meanwhile our parents and millions more are getting laid off and rent will go down with everything else.
ucsccola,foe6e3w,t3_g5uhiz,1587696947.0,No to Saxon then.
ucsccola,fmyvit3,t3_fw5lgk,1586497055.0,You have to be a real idiot to do anything but keep/get your job back right now. The economy is tanking and these assholes think they have negotiating power.
UCSCuncensored,fmqekjm,t3_fwqvdm,1586298127.0,So true
UCSCuncensored,fmqe6bq,t1_fl4ycen,1586297919.0,Now that we are all screwed rent will go down . Your pay is plenty. If rents go down a lot maybe the University should lower your wages.
UCSC,fm5aw33,t3_ft2jg2,1585769534.0,Not even close
