Unfortunately, I have not used evernote for some time now and did not have 2fa. I had sensitive docs on there..."

Fallout,foet5d8,t3_g730lm,1587713874.0,"I agree. It just feels that despite doing so much in terms of quests and stuff, its hard to actually see and feel that your actions are impacting the world. Aside, from some changes in dialogue from some characters, I just never really felt it.  


The settlers are so one dimensional. Especially building the settlements, I was like dude ya'll have tvs, foods, beds, bars, etc but they all just carry along."
