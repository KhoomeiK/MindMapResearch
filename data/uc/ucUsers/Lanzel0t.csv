ucla,fnux62x,t1_fnt2cib,1587273512.0,"Hmm I don't remember. It's really gonna depend on how fast your college puts in grades and when your class sign up date is (although if you are taking the course/ finished it but don't have the grades back I feel like they'd still let you take the 32B).

That's something you should ask a counselor. If they still have new-student orientation, that would also be something to talk to your student counselor about (and to put in the pre-survey for orientation). Have your unofficial transcript to show that you're in the process of taking the class and make sure to tell your counselor/student counselor about your issue.

Sorry I can't help more :/"

ucla,fn58xsy,t1_fn1a79w,1586658797.0,"As a transfer student I think your use of the transfer community to justify more fees disgusting. You do realize that many transfer students may not want to pay $15 more for a resource center....oh wait, we already have one of those. This school's transfer resources was one of the reasons I decided to come here.

This message proves two things: 1) this person campaigning for Naomi is pandering to/ using student groups while 2) being ignorant of those same community's resources/challenges. USAC incompetence at it's finest."

unpopularopinion,fmxhr5y,t1_fmvl9uf,1586465221.0,"It's interesting how for we have the mentality that someone can't defend themselves for people we know, but not for well known figures. Sure most of their work is public, however shouldn't the same metric apply? Should we really be disrespecting/ talking shit about dead public figures if they can't defend themselves and clear up possible misunderstandings? 

I think you can argue that any person's life is public and effected others, so anybody should be able to debate/ criticize their choices whether they're alive or not because that dead person had an impact on other people. Maybe we can't get the full story, but we can't just never discuss the role their life had and the poor choices/negative impact they had."

unpopularopinion,fmta4zl,t1_fmrqt7y,1586369318.0," It doesn't really matter how big/small your country is because Pakistan will just target 110 of your largest cities and wipe out a big chunk of your industry/ population. You can obviously do the same to them. 
Also, because both your countries have about 60% of the population that's rural it would be difficult for either of you to wipe the other out."
unpopularopinion,fmrqem6,t1_fmrk3p9,1586331685.0,"But does Pakistan really *need* a feared military when they have even a small number of nukes? I mean sure it's nice to have a good military for a lot of reasons, but it's not like India can do anything major to Pakistan without provoking a nuclear response that would kill millions on both sides"

There's another post on the Reddit page that has a picture of the message someone got, but it only mentions moving people out of De Neve and Dykstra"
