pathofexile,fp1j8g7,t1_fp1ajpc,1588237383.0,I thought leveling has been easier than ever. Use hollow palm + astramentis + % dex string of servitude. Level with molten strike/infernal blow until act 3. Then just use consecrated path until act 10.

ApplyingToCollege,fnpr481,t1_fnodphw,1587150461.0,in the long run it doesn’t really make a difference if you’re 18 or 21. You’ll be in your career for 30+ years.

StarWars,fmmg13u,t1_fmmdgjk,1586204596.0,"High end customs have a lot more choices. Your Corsair probably had a limited amount of switches you could choose from. There’s hundreds of different switches out there.

The quality of manufacturing is significantly higher in the keyboards than compared to a Corsair. Such as the stabilizers. If you press your spacebar you’ll probably hear a rattling noise. And some pinging from the springs when you press your switches (very very faint, but is noticeable on cherry Mx switches).

Exclusivity is another thing. Most high end keyboards run in group buys, so there’s only a limited amount available. 

But for the major reason why it’s so expensive is the flex aspect and subjective aesthetics. The TGR Jane is considered to be “endgame”, the Rolls-Royce, and is one of the most expensive keyboards that you can buy (though OTD keyboards are more expensive). It’s like buying a car. A Toyota and a Lamborghini will get you from point a to point b, but the quality/exclusivity of the Lamborghini will make it worth astronomically more. 

There are very high quality custom keyboard kits for $300ish, so the $2000+ price tag of the Jane isn’t reflective of what a normal high end custom would cost."
StarWars,fmmbtah,t1_fmm247k,1586202456.0,Dude it’s a TGR Jane
StarWars,fmmbrsu,t1_fmlr7qs,1586202435.0,That’s a TGR Jane with GMK boba fett. You can get the keycaps set from novel keys for like $225. The keyboard on the other hand is part of a limited group buy and goes for $2000-$3000 after market.
StarWars,fmmbc7q,t1_fmm9ion,1586202215.0,You forgot a 0. That’s a TGR Jane. It’s $2000+.
