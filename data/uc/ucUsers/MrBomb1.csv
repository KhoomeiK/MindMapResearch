berkeley,fmvcbfn,t3_fwxe9k,1586412195.0,"I think Cornell is considered the bastard child of the rest of the Ivy League schools (not my personal opinion, just saw some stuff on the other Ivy meme pages). Anyway, even if you got into Harvard you're better off at Berkeley. People in industry know there's really only 4 schools you should care about in tech: Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, CMU (the 4 schools that are tied for first place in CS). To some extent, Cal Tech too. 

Berkeley CS doesn't necessarily teach anything that makes you automatically smarter. However, the professors / research / peers are will make you much stronger than anywhere.

Also about the GPA cap: it's hard enough that not everyone can get in, but at the same time it's not so difficult that people are shocked if you declare. I think the number of people who declare is something like 50% ish, which really isn't bad at all. 3.3 is something everyone worries about, but not prohibitively so. Anyway, we have a data science major now so you have a backup plan if CS doesn't work out."

berkeley,fmvbax4,t3_fx0mah,1586411310.0,"I left 5 pages blank on my CS 70 final, was sure I failed. Average ended up being like 40%-ish and I ended up doing something like +1.3 or +1.4 SD above the mean. You never know"
berkeley,fmqug7i,t3_fwpno1,1586307303.0,Can't speak to the timeline but yes teaching for 61A is generally very competitive (try going for upper divs--it'll be better for your resume too). In 2018 there were something like 150 applications and only \~6ish TA hires.

berkeley,fmqsu0m,t3_fwtasx,1586306303.0,"I did not take 54 with Sristava but I did take many of his exams to practice and did quite well in the class. One thing I think a lot of people overlook in math is the power of a cheat sheet (even if you're not allowed to use one on the exam, you should still make one while you're studying and then just don't look at it during the exam). There are a lot of theorems in linear algebra that connect to each other and it's hard to keep them all straight in your head. i.e., IMT has like 20+ different ""if and only if"" clauses, and then SVD / spectral theorem have like 6 or 7 important implications / geometric interpretations.  Memorization won't be enough alone, but being familiar with all those details will help a lot, esp for Sristava's crazy True / False questions."
berkeley,fmqs7eo,t3_fwrkid,1586305920.0,"College Writing 105 (meet once a week and write blog posts)

Math 10A and 10B (high school math for life science majors who can't count)

College Writing 110 (wrote 2 essays in the ENTIRE semester). This class was kind of hard to do well in at first, but I noticed that all the people in the class who were writing about being victims/minorities/oppressed\_women were getting straight A's and A+'s. So I started writing about how I'm oppressed in America too and I got an A.

Psych 1 (you can skip the final and still get an A+)

ESPM 162 (I skipped one of the major essay assignments because I didn't feel like writing it. Still passed the class and in fact would have gotten a B+ if I had done letter grade. No final, just take-home midterm that's EZPZ)

Bio 1A (they use the exact same bio textbook that a ton of high schools use for AP Bio and the exams are just an easier version of the SAT II test)

CS 10 and CS 88 (haven't actually taken these classes, but look at the course descriptions and you'll see)"

The Scheme project is actually accomplishing a pretty big feat (writing code that reads other code), but there is so much scaffolding and hints in the instructions that it's possible to complete the entire project without understanding it at all (which is what I inadvertently did). As someone who had no coding experience coming into college I thought Hog was a lot harder than Scheme"
berkeley,fmo5jqk,t1_fmo08zt,1586246168.0,dang was the last part that hard? I'm PNP'ing so I just did the easy parts and didn't even look at the last 1/3 of the exam.
berkeley,fmm6sj6,t1_fmh7l9s,1586199834.0,"Read the syllabus’ grading policy

How many points out of 300 do you need, using the percentages in the syllabus?
How many of those points are from HW/lab/participation?
How many points do you need after accounting for HW/lab/participation?
What do those points translate to in percentages given that exams are worth X points in the class?"
berkeley,fmm6oas,t1_fmil8av,1586199772.0,"Sadly, not at all. Research and work experience are a lot more important."
berkeley,fmkpejp,t3_fvqm1t,1586163406.0,"I had a Regents to UCLA and no regents to Berkeley. Even though I was/am premed, I knew that I wouldn’t grow very much if I just memorized bio facts from a textbook all 4 years. I wanted to be really strong at CS/physics/math and only Berkeley academics are strong enough for that. Hence Berkeley. I’ve never regretted turning down the UCLA regent’s, and I’ve grown a lot from all the CS courses I’ve taken here. 

Also even though US news puts UCLA on top, no one in the working (tech) world really believes that lol. Unix and Steve Wozniak and RAID and a ton of other major tech advancements came from Berkeley, whereas UCLA is mostly a bio/med school. Even then, Berkeley discovered like 5% of the periodic table so you might still have more clout as a Berkeley bioscience major. If you’re a humanities or business major, there’s probably not a huge difference between the 2. Humanities at Berkeley are pretty trash—I learned a lot more from my amazing high school teachers. Our business school is way overrated too"
berkeley,fmkow46,t3_fvufy5,1586162836.0,"I did 1.6 / 1.5 / 1.5 SD above on the 3 exams in that class (I got the top score on MT2 for 1AL too). At least for 1A, I didn’t think there was more to it other than making a Quizlet for each lecture and making a flash card for EVERY bullet point in the slides + figure captions. Went through each deck 3-4x before the exam. Dillin’s test required some math but iirc there were no crazy integrals or anything. It was just like 1/4 * 3/4–simple fractions and arithmetic that simplified nicely. Don’t worry he’s not going to suddenly make you integrate a wave function or smthg"
berkeley,fmko8bp,t1_fmj6xrc,1586162097.0,"If your MT1 + MT2 average is >= 74% and you get all the HW and lab points you can skip the final entirely and still get a pass lol

If you guess entirely on this exam, you’ll get a 29% (5% freebies + 6/30 correct on average by guessing). 29% scaled to 50 points is 12.5. This means that your MT1 and final exam scores together would need to add up to 61.5 course points. 61.5 / 150 is 41%. So no matter where you are, if you guess entirely on MT2, your MT1 and final scores just need to both be at least 41% which shouldn’t be too hard. Even if you only got 50% on MT1, you’d only need a 36.5% on the final to pass"
berkeley,fmg2tma,t1_fmeknvk,1586040071.0,Yeah bless the PNP policy. As long as your MT1 and MT2 scores average out to 74% you can skip the final and still pass lol
