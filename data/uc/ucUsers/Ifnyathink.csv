therapy,fpms8l7,t3_gedadz,1588740350.0,"It’s normal to be scared of therapy.  It’s a big deal to say out loud all the things that have been rattling around in your brain for many years.  It may feel like your problems will feel amplified if you share them with someone. But while this may be true, the relief you will likely feel from being able to talk about your problems will outweigh any intensity of the feelings.  And seriously, don’t worry about your therapist trying to judge you.  They have heard it ALL!!  It’s great that you’re ready to make some change and find relief from your suffering.  I think everyone should have a therapist because, well, life is hard for everyone... no matter how things may appear from where you’re standing.  You are not alone.  Be courageous.  Fight for yourself. Be your own biggest advocate as no one else can take this step for you.  Blessings to you. Always choose love."

If you feel like you’ve gotten from her services everything that you can, you’ll probably need to be the one to “end it.”  If you decided to do that, i suggest doing some other group activity (mindfulness/meditation, yoga, group therapy, etc) that encourages you to continue building relationships and working on being more aware of your habitual thinking so you can use what you learned in therapy to “call yourself in” when you’re behaving/thinking in ways that don’t serve you and support your intentions.

Your therapist has heard it all.  I wouldn’t be embarrassed or feel shame about your situation.  People struggle with mental illness and episodes much more than you may think.  Just pretend you are your own best friend.  How would you react if your best friend told you all the embarrassing/shameful things she had done?  Would you judge her and make her feel bad?

I got fed up with feeling that way and decided to stop listening to all that garbage (it really is - just there to hook you in and keep you coming back), and over time all of my symptoms disappeared.

In this modern culture, we are set up to fail. We don’t live in community the way we used to and so Many of us feel isolated, lonely, helpless. Sadly, this is becoming more the norm.  What I have learned about sadness is, it feeds on idleness.  When were quiet, alone, there it is. Ready to make us feel bad.  I used to try to push it away, stay busy and ignore it. But it was always there. So then I started to learn how to go into the sadness. I started meditating and being more still.  I let myself feel more. I cry more. I am a friend to myself and don’t shame me for being this way. This helps. I think these are really trying times for everyone right now, and some of us are just more attuned to the great sadness in this world.  Having said this, the most important thing to do is to talk to someone about it, Ideally a professional that you can have sessions with regularly.   I don’t know where you’re from but in my part of the world almost everyone I know has a therapist. It’s normal, natural, and very helpful. Other things you can do our work on improving your diet (reduce sugar is the biggest but eating “whole foods”), exercise - go for walks, do yoga, jog, and spend as much time in nature as possible.  These things are all hard and take work and some research to figure out what’s going to work for you but they are foundational in improving your mental health.  Improving your mental health is kind of like training for an athletic endurance competition, it takes effort and you also have to know when to rest and allow yourself to “just be.”  Don’t give up on yourself, be the best friend that you can be to yourself. I wish you all the best. You are worthy."
Coronavirus,fo5opwq,t1_fnmeky2,1587531127.0,"Text of article follows:

Despite reassurances from the federal government that they’ve worked to properly supply medical institutions with life-saving personal protective equipment (PPE), hospital administrators across the country have been forced to take extraordinary measures to avoid having their PPE purchases seized by federal agents for re-distribution.

In Illinois, Gov J.B Pritzker (D) reportedly arranged for secret private charter jet to import millions of masks and gloves from China in order to avoid the administration’s efforts to confiscate desperately needed PPE, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The invoices, which totaled $888,275, were listed as “aircraft charter flight to Shanghai, China for COVID-19 response.”

According to the report, a source with direct knowledge of Pritzker’s purchase said the order was kept under wraps because the administration “heard reports of Trump trying to take PPE in China and when it gets to the United States.”

“The supply chain has been likened to the Wild West, and once you have purchased supplies, ensuring they get to the state is another herculean feat,” Pritzker press secretary Jordan Abudayyeh told the Sun-Times. “These flights are carrying millions of masks and gloves our workers need. They’re scheduled to land in Illinois in the coming weeks and the state is working to ensure these much-needed supplies are protected and ready for distribution around the state.”

The federal government last month seized 3 million masks ordered by the state of Massachusetts, with similar reports popping up around the nation.

“Around the time that we had our 3 million masks that we had ordered through BJs confiscated in the port of New York, at that point it became pretty clear to us that using what I would describe as sort of a ‘traditional approach to this’ wasn’t going to work,” Gov. Charlie Baker (R) said earlier in April.

In a letter posted Friday to the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Andrew Artenstein, the chief physician executive of Baystate Health in Massachusetts, wrote about the measures his hospital took to ensure their shipment of PPE.

After paying five-times the normal price for a shipment of KN95 respirator masks from China, he and four others met a dealer at a small airport “in the mid-Atlantic region,” where they executed their plan.

“Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected,” Artenstein wrote:

Hours before our planned departure, we were told to expect only a quarter of our original order. We went anyway, since we desperately needed any supplies we could get. Upon arrival, we were jubilant to see pallets of KN95 respirators and face masks being unloaded. We opened several boxes, examined their contents, and hoped that this random sample would be representative of the entire shipment. Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system’s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE. Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. I remained nervous and worried on the long drive back, feelings that did not abate until midnight, when I received the call that the PPE shipment was secured at our warehouse.

When contacted about Artenstein’s story by BuzzFeed News, the FBI provided a statement saying that the agency has been investigating PPE hoarding and illegal PPE sales as part of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump.

“While the FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations, we want to assure the public the FBI remains committed to ensuring national security and pursuing violations of federal law, and vigilant in deterring, detecting, and investigating wrongdoing related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the statement said."
therapy,fo4dz7x,t3_g5n9c9,1587502707.0,"If not grades, what does interest you?  What do you care about? If nothing comes to mind, I think you have your starting point. You’ve got to find something to believe in, whether that is music, art, social justice, helping others who are truly suffering, or anything else.  You may be so desensitized that nothing peaks your interest at this point but keep trying at some thing no matter what. As you open your mind to new things you’re creating new pathways in your brain that will help you to care more, it’s a positive feedback cycle.  Maybe you’re just an old soul that has a hard time connecting with people your age because you see past all the fake bullshit. Start speaking your truth. Your parents are probably just fearful and have their own set of issues. They’re doing the best they can. If you can look at them with compassion and realize that many millions are in your shoes, it might be comforting.  This is a good time for you to start developing a better relationship with yourself you need to be your own best friend, your own support system. Your higher self needs to take care of your lower self while your lower self works to connect more with your higher self. If that makes any sense? If you can find something to put your creative energy into, even if the resulting product is dark and ugly, it’s an outlet you need right now.  The world is super fucked up right now. You’re just awake to it, that’s all. You are enough.  Lead with your heart.  Best wishes to you dear one."
therapy,fo211zp,t3_g58efz,1587446561.0,"So sorry you are suffering dear one.  You are not alone.  I “see” you. I feel your pain.  It’s good to reach out.  Yay for you being courageous enough to reach out here.  Have you looked into therapy? If you can afford it, please seek out a therapist that you can work with regularly.  There are several phases to moving towards your desires - to be less anxious, to rid yourself of the nervousness in talking to people, to making friends and to eventually dating.  It will take some time.  You’ll want to develop a plan, set goals and work towards them each and every day.  But there is light at the end of the tunnel!  Start with your foundation - you physical and mental health.  If you don’t exercise, start tomorrow.  Even if that’s just going around the block for a walk. Build up from there.  Yoga is very powerful medicine.  Try to spend as much time outside as possible.  Getting into nature and getting vitamin D from the sun will eventually start to enhance your mood.  Try meditating.  You just have to sit quietly and tell yourself “I am breathing in...and now I’m breathing out” do that for 2 minutes a day then build up to 5, then 10, and soon up to 20 minutes.  What you’re doing when you meditate is you are paying attention to yourself.  Yourself can really be neglected and over time yourself can disconnect from your body and that’s when you start to have anxiety and fear and social issues.  It’s because you’re not centering in your heart and being a friend to yourself.  Diet - this is a big one and most docs just want to put you on a bunch of meds and barely mention diet but essentially, you are what you eat so if you’re eating a bunch of junk then you’ll feel like junk, and therefore have more self consciousness.  Try eating as many “Whole Foods” as possible and chill out on sugar (if that applies).  All of these things are foundational. They are the building blocks that will prep you for a readiness of mind and body to then do the deeper work of self love that is necessary for you to feel worthy and develop a sense of belonging.  Then you HAVE to start putting yourself out there more.  Try, fail, try again, fail again, until you succeed.  Get involved in an organization where you can be of service in some way. There are so so many people in need right now. Maybe you could do grocery drop offs for the elderly or something like that?? This one is tricky with the pandemic but as soon as you can, get involved in something where you can help/volunteer/give to others in need.  This is so nourishing for the soul and helps us all connect with our humanity. Find a hobby.  You may need to try out a few things before you find something that clicks with you.  Just keep trying new things- even if you have to do them alone. Look, all this stuff is hard. I get it. But you have to retrain your brain.  You have to create new neuropathways that will reinforce a positive view of yourself. It’s like athletic training.  And you want to find a way to be your own best friend- your own side kick.  Go for a drive with the windows rolled down and the radio turned way up to your favorite song and sing at the top of your lungs.  Dance by yourself. If you start to have fun with yourself, others will be naturally drawn to you.  And if you are over 21, maybe do some research on plant medicine for treating depression and anxiety. A good dose of magic mushrooms can do wonders for someone dealing with low self esteem.  But do lots of research from credible sources before going down that route.  I wish you all the best and I can tell you will find your way simply by how you phrased your question. You’re so worthy of love and friendship."

therapy,fnm5zay,t3_g2i2sz,1587065683.0,"So sorry to hear. I’m sure that right now it feels like the world is closing in on you but I promise it will get better. And you are pretty much fighting for your life, so while it feels so so hard, the best thing to do is self-care. That includes therapy, but also eating healthier, exercising (walks, stretching), and doing therapeutic activities that support good mental health (art, writing, listening to music). Zoning out on movies and video games can help in the short term but it can also make you feel like shit if you do it too much. There’s a whole world inside your heart and head worth exploring right now, especially looking into why you have become a codependent person. I feel that the one thing we are meant to do here on earth is to really know ourselves deeply. But most of us turn away from ourselves and look for distraction and others for approval.  Take this time to feel deeply, write down your thoughts – as honestly as you can – and maybe try some meditation. Turning into the loneliness and despair, being a friend to yourself and holding your heart while you hurt, this is what you need for you.  Best wishes."
therapy,fnk3e95,t3_g27dpw,1587013798.0,"First off- if your dad and your girlfriend really are flirting then that sucks big time and they should not disrespect you like that.  Secondly, and this may be more the focus based on the way you phrased this post...Do you have a history of jealousy? Or is this a one-time occurrence? You didn’t allude much to the premise of the claim about them flirting but rather moved right in to how you feel bad for saying something.  Typically people with jealousy issues (of which I have a history myself) have some self esteem issues.  They become co-dependent on others who they seek for their approval/feelings of self worth.  They become clingy and obsessive.  The best thing to do is turn inward.  Work on yourself through therapy, meditation, excercise, yoga, plant medicine, etc.  Try to be happy for other people more- faking it until it becomes more real.  Imagine your girlfriend and your dad finding true love, or - if that feels too fucked up- a deep friendship that helps them both feel more whole. Send them both all the love you can. Forgive them for things that you’ve imagined they have done to you.  Picture yourself being their friend after having gone through these hard times together.  It sounds weird but basically you just need to realize that people you love may - or may not - fuck you over. If/when they do, it’s NEVER about you. It’s about them not loving themselves enough to be honest and kind with you.  But they’re not bad people and they don’t intend to hurt you.  They’re just falsely filling some emptiness within. If you can look at others that disappoint you with love and compassion, and realize they’re just humans who screw up, you can relax a bit more and just roll with the punches.  Doesn’t mean you can’t love them and give them your heart.  Maybe they won’t disappoint you too.  But certainly if you are acting suspicious and jealous then you’re signaling to people that you don’t think you are worthy of them being honest with you.  We teach people how to treat us.  Best of luck to you."

mentalhealth,fn20x6l,t3_fyv1yb,1586574963.0,"My mom had OCD and I helped break her of it when I was about 18. What I did was I took everything she cared about super seriously.  I took my shoes off before entering the house, did every dish that I made, basically cleaned up after myself and did everything she asked me to do for a few months.  And if she mentioned something that needed to be done or that she didn’t like me doing, I would immediately address it.  It was a pain in the ass but I basically gave her NO reason to be more OCD about or “at” me.  Then I took it to another level and started acting like her...and if she would do anything that -in the past she had gotten annoyed about me doing - I would call her out on it and act as upset as her as she would be towards me.  “A little taste of her own medicine” if you will.  She started to get worried about me being this way, and told me so.  I told her i was just trying to make her happy and didn’t want to upset her.  I told her that I get anxious worrying about pleasing her (which was true).  And that made her realize that she was becoming anxious stress case.  She chilled out a lot and actually I got a little more neurotic (not too much but enough to be less of a dirtbag and lazy arse).  She didn’t want me to become a neurotic mess so she realized she had to work on herself more.  Just start by doing more of what she asks and then gradually turn it up.  And let me know how it goes.
