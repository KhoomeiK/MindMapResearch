UCSantaBarbara,fp8yt02,t3_gbsxmu,1588407830.0,He was not aware. He said in discussion.
UCSantaBarbara,fomcej0,t1_fomc2xn,1587885052.0,Same! I remember working hard but not this hard! The school environment was really helpful for me.
UCSantaBarbara,fomcc4s,t3_g7zc51,1587884988.0,"I have the same problem. I tell myself “stop working tonight” and I do that but 30 minutes in and I feel like I’m falling behind, that everyone is ahead of me and so I go back to work. Being at UCSB was totally different. I had my friends there :("
UCSantaBarbara,folgetu,t1_folgaw3,1587861673.0,Hopefully not. I hope everything goes back to normal.
UCSantaBarbara,folfkds,t1_folfilw,1587861155.0,I now. I meant if as if you were taking it another time.
UCSantaBarbara,folcs8q,t1_folbar4,1587859479.0,"Now wait for 6BL if you are in 6AL. If it’s not online, you will be in lab for four hours lacking many of the skills you learned online. It will be more difficult for us to adapt."
UCSantaBarbara,folcj4s,t3_g7zc51,1587859327.0,Thank you!!
UCSantaBarbara,fokt6z0,t3_g7zc51,1587848479.0,Thank you so much for your thoughtful response. I will take into account what you said :)
UCSantaBarbara,fokqwhz,t1_fokjnin,1587847227.0,Thank you ❤️
UCSantaBarbara,fokqu6c,t1_fokiuuv,1587847194.0,Same tbh
UCSantaBarbara,fo29jdw,t3_g5a20x,1587454171.0,"Do the book problems. Mark those problems you got wrong the first time and redo them after you finish all of them. If you still don’t seem to understand the problem or concept, go to office hours. Also, CLAS is great for general chem. You don’t need to re do the problems more than 3x. That’s only going to annoying and you will probably end up memorizing them. Some professors like you to know the concept as they will often set up a question in such a way that you will not be expecting. Maybe do them 2 times but try to focus on the hard ones or the ones you don’t understand. After all, memorizing will only take you so far, especially in chem."
UCSantaBarbara,fnzslv3,t3_g4myfg,1587400034.0,"Yeah, there were some where I was like you could argue this."
UCSantaBarbara,fnzoj2b,t3_g4myfg,1587397938.0,"Yes, omg"
UCSantaBarbara,fnylny9,t3_g4myfg,1587367014.0,"Honestly, I don’t know could be relative hard or relative easy"
UCSantaBarbara,fnykhjb,t1_fnyk7bi,1587365911.0,Perhaps... maybe she’ll make the test harder because of it
UCSantaBarbara,fnyjl9z,t3_g4myfg,1587365106.0,"Definitely.... also, online classes just suck"
UCSantaBarbara,fnws4tu,t3_g46rhp,1587324374.0,"Regardless of how I study, it is hard to learn the material"
UCSantaBarbara,fnrysdz,t3_g3l6uv,1587206799.0,Lol. Don’t worry about joining one right now. First get here and then figure it out.
UCSantaBarbara,fni74or,t3_g1wmpf,1586975109.0,Prefer taking that test on Proctor U than waking up that early lol
UCSantaBarbara,fn4tgnj,t3_fzk5o2,1586648605.0,"I won’t say the material was easy. Most would consider it review from general chemistry and 109A. I feel like for his quizzes, we need to have a good understanding of the problems. It’s not enough to know how to do them. I also think it was unexpected. Let’s hope we did good! It’s also the first quiz so don’t worry! Everything will be fine"
UCSantaBarbara,fmjbm43,t1_fmj6abk,1586126998.0,I agree with this comment. Give him sometime to figure stuff out. It’s the first week. Don’t over stress.
