She just didnt like how sassy Petyr was being and does this big unnecessary flex to prove shes superior. Power isnt power. In her case, money is power. Baelish isnt cowed by that interaction, he just learns that the Queen is unstable and dangerous."
gameofthrones,fp870op,t1_fp4hael,1588385135.0,"Feast for Crows has a weaker plot than the first three books, but the prose and themes are absolutely on the same level. In the first three books, tons of shit happens. Twists and turns, battles, betrayals. Feast for Crows is a bunch of aftermath and is a slower book overall. Less interesting and surprising things happen, and often to characters we care less about. 

The thing that makes it a brilliant book to me is the examination of the common people. The highly creative and interesting culture of the Ironborn. The resurgence in the faith of the Seven. The consequences of war. You get way less of that in the first three books and a slower paced text is more suitable to it."

The real reason is much more simple and obvious. This whole idea was fresh to him in the 90s, now it's not. It's been almost 30 years since GRRM was the person who was inspired to write this fantasy epic, and during that time it's been made into a massive hit show and he has all the money he could ever want. I'm sure he cares about finishing it from a legacy perspective, but he probably doesn't care about it nearly the way he used to."

deadbydaylight,fo5la79,t1_fo5j2pp,1587528460.0,"This is a strategy. Theres a build for the killer Doctor that revolves around doing exactly that, because his area of effect abilities make it even easier to pull off. Most other killers arent able to effectively make it happen without taking significant risk (its safer to try to play normally and not let it get that close to endgame)."
