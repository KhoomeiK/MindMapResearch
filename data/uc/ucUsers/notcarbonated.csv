Dell,fpfcpja,t3_gcv2o7,1588567462.0,I've played Tales of Berseria and Ys VIII on my 7390 2-in-1 and both perform well at standard video settings. I get 60 fps or close to it when running the games at 720p resolution.
Dell,fpbsvcr,t3_gchzt5,1588477869.0,If you think you'd benefit from using the computer as a tablet then definitely go with the 2-in-1. I have this model and find that it works really well. No coil whine or significant quality control issues on mine.
Dell,fpaxkn6,t1_fpaxdrd,1588457802.0,"Yes, the ram is soldered on and can't be upgraded."
Dell,fpaq348,t3_gcc3y3,1588453354.0,I suggest to go with the quad-core with 16GB of RAM. With only 8GB you will quickly run into a bottleneck doing things like photo editing.
trackers,fpakdpo,t1_fpak247,1588449973.0,"Ahh, that make sense. Thx for the info"
trackers,fpakc3w,t1_fpak5v2,1588449947.0,That's true...
trackers,fpajrhc,t3_gccjz4,1588449612.0,"lmao do you mean to say ""Handbrake encode""?"
aww,fpahcsn,t1_fpa6kas,1588448192.0,Looks like there's a bug screen there. You can kind of see it in the light at the start of the video.
Evernote,fpa4qos,t1_fp9o7p6,1588440781.0,"Well Evernote already has some features for handwritting, such as the ""Ink Notes"". I use them regularly and they're *fine*, but I wish they would improve the search function and give you the option to draw on regular text notes. In other words, just improve the products they already have."
UCSC,fp6ts6m,t3_gbna8w,1588358459.0,"Do you have a screenshot of the error or evidence that the PDF was blank? Otherwise, if you remember the text of the error you might be able to find some documentation about it on the web. Any of this might be helpful if you go back to your professor or to others in the department."
Dell,fp115ky,t3_gad32q,1588221671.0,"I have the same model in the same specification and really enjoy it. Coming from a Macbook Retina 2013, which I still use as a backup.

Only problem is the occassional noise on the bluetooth audio. It doesn't get disconnected in the way that you described with yours, just cuts in-and-out like the signal is disrupted. I've gone through every set of drivers I could find, but still see the same problem :/"
Dell,fonk4z7,t3_g6d70y,1587921030.0,"I had the same issue and was able to fix it by downgrading to the 21.50.0.1 bluetooth driver on Dell's website. I also went into the ""Power Management"" tab of the Intel Wireless Bluetooth device in Device Manager and unchecke the box that allows the system to turn off the device to save power. But I'm pretty sure it was the driver that made the difference."
vinyl,foldx4a,t3_g80hn2,1587860159.0,Very nice collection! I only have Alien Lanes and Bee Thousand. Wish they would reissue Vampire on Titus and Propeller because I would buy them in a heartbeat.
Dell,foldbh3,t3_g82wdi,1587859800.0,"I am a student as well and have the 4k model. I get 6-7 hours while using the machine for light browsing, listening to music, and reading."
blackcats,fo1zd0h,t3_g538rc,1587445252.0,Those are some nice looking chompers
evangelion,fnp1zql,t1_fnp0yq1,1587137834.0,"Right, because I'm sure you've never done that before. Give me a break."
evangelion,fnovabf,t1_fnopbel,1587134270.0,"Do yourself a favor and don't watch the third rebuild. It's a disaster. It almost ruined Evangelion for me, and I'm a big fan of the franchise.

I'm planning to wait for reviews of this new movie before watching it. If it doesn't somehow redeem the 3rd one, I will sit it out."
aww,fnafm4d,t3_g0ix5j,1586796651.0,Is he missing his arms??
sphynx,fmlhgpy,t3_fvt3kv,1586186496.0,We've found our new May Queen
bayarea,fmjioo1,t3_fvmheg,1586131095.0,Really appreciate your work on these charts and the insights you provide. Please keep it up!
