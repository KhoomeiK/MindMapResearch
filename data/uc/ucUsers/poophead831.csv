UCSC,fpmlrku,t3_ge3pda,1588735899.0,I requested to be relocated to the apartments because I could not eat the same thing at the dining hall anymore.
UCSC,fpmln61,t3_ge8vk0,1588735821.0,I am down! I am fascinated by the turkeys!
curlyhair,fphvauh,t1_flggvj8,1588628462.0,What shampoo & conditioner do you recommend from NYM?
UCSC,fpdyt14,t3_gcjmrt,1588536953.0,I feel that way about the professor teaching my senior seminar. She‚Äôs a sweet lady but the class is so boring. I am starting to lose my mind.
SkincareAddiction,fp8pfxl,t1_fp8muop,1588398787.0,No. I haven‚Äôt. This would be my first time using an AHA. Do you have any tips or recommendations?
UCSC,fp1blif,t1_foynzu6,1588230176.0,Online gift cards are a good idea!
UCSC,fp1bixo,t3_gafv3q,1588230111.0,"I got some back during Spring Break at Costco. However, I did show up an hour before opening. It was worth it because I am set for a while and I don't have to stress about where I am gonna be getting toilet paper from."
Makeup,folzqrb,t1_foi0iud,1587874459.0,Oh LOL I have a stash of 50 and I love them all. They never disappoint. Some have dried up but Duraline does the trick.
BadMUAs,folzoau,t1_folyuwd,1587874408.0,"She DOES NOT OWN HER OWN makeup brand. Again. She does not own Midas Cosmetics. It is a makeup collaboration and you can have a makeup collaboration WITHOUT being a makeup artist. For example, Safiya Nygaard and Lele Pons. 

The subreddit is for PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTISTS. She is NOT a professional makeup artist. Do you understand that? Do you know what a PRO MUA is??? Have you ever heard her say the she is a professional? These things do NOT make her a makeup artist."
BadMUAs,folzdmy,t1_fojtrzl,1587874193.0,"Yes. She is a famous YouTuber and of course she is likely to get some criticism and some hate like any person who puts themselves on the internet. However, uploading her photo to this subreddit (that is intended for bad PRO MUA jobs) is not the way to go. She is...and I will say it again...a YOUTUBER. Not a makeup artist."
BadMUAs,folz2ei,t1_fogcrun,1587873969.0,"No. No it is not. She also does a lot of commentary and drama related content, but please go ahead and tell me how her entire career is makeup related because it is not üôÇ"
BadMUAs,folyxyq,t1_fojqws4,1587873883.0,YES. Thank you so much for saying this. This is what I was trying to say and I am getting attacked for it.
BadMUAs,folyppn,t1_foh6nlx,1587873719.0,"Get over myself? This is literally NOT about me. 

However, my understanding was that this subreddit was for people were ACTUAL MUA and NOT just makeup users. Even if this subreddit DOES include makeup wearers, this does not make HER a MUA. You need to learn the difference between a professional MUA and just someone who makes beauty related content. If I start uploading makeup related content, does that automatically make me a MUA? No, it doesn‚Äôt."
BadMUAs,fogtqd7,t1_fog7ti5,1587756876.0,That doesn't necessarily make her a MUA. Safiya Nygaard had a collab with Colourpop and she is not a MUA. Same thing with Lele Pons.
BadMUAs,fofyr4t,t1_fodzmfu,1587745160.0,"I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs trying to be a makeup artist necessarily. She has plenty of content that is not makeup related. 

I think we need to understand the difference between makeup enthusiasts and actual makeup artists. She is just a makeup enthusiast like a lot of us are."
BadMUAs,fofydt7,t3_g6vpua,1587744977.0,"I thought this subreddit was to critique people who are actual Makeup artists. People who are charging others for their services. She is in no way a makeup artist nor is she pretending to be. Yes, she has makeup related content but she is not claiming to me a professional makeup artist. 

Yes, her lipstick application could use some work but at what point is this subreddit just insulting people who could improve their makeup skills?"
Makeup,foer8wz,t1_fodtt4d,1587712041.0,Did you try Duraline?
Makeup,foer4hp,t3_g6xj8d,1587711925.0,"Probably the Colourpop Matte Filter Concealer. I hate it so much. I can‚Äôt get it to look good no matter what. I hear people use it as a foundation and not even then, does it look good. It‚Äôs splotchy and moves around when you blend it with a sponge. If you use a brush, it‚Äôs steaks. When I try to use it as foundation, my skin looks dry (and I don‚Äôt have dry skin) and the coverage is uneven. There‚Äôs literally no use for this product."
UCSC,foeet28,t1_fo97yek,1587702027.0,Yes. I am living with 3 other people. Everyone has their own room though.
UCSC,fo8oznx,t3_g680x9,1587600902.0,I got moved from the Porter res halls on Friday to the Porter apartments. It's been chill.
Makeup,fo56swf,t3_g5h44d,1587518753.0,Watch Robert Welsh on YT or Wayne Gods.
UCSC,fo0h99r,t3_g4zzuk,1587413106.0,I just moved into the Porter apartments too. I went to Target in Capitola and got one for about $60.
ColourPop,fnr5kcr,t3_g3c8bp,1587179829.0,Nah. This collection ain‚Äôt it. They are gonna have to try a lot harder to get people to buy during a pandemic.
ColourPop,fnr5eva,t3_g3aqw6,1587179724.0,This reminds me of Pixie cosmetics.
UCSC,fnr5avm,t1_fnpfkgr,1587179647.0,Yes. Greek life ain‚Äôt for me.
UCSC,fnpfaqk,t1_fnp3u1v,1587144494.0,"Yes & no. People are very friendly especially the first few weeks. However, there seems to be a bit of a ‚Äúclique‚Äù type of atmosphere going on here. It seems like you have to find your group of friends right off the bat because once the cliques form, it seems harder to join any other groups. That was my experience as well as other Redditors‚Äô experience. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôve met a bunch of people. A lot of them were really nice, friendly, and outgoing but I didn‚Äôt feel like I belonged in their group necessarily. I am also the type of person who is not gonna settle for a group of friends just because they don‚Äôt wanna be alone. It also helps if you are open to drinking and smoking. I am not really into that, so it made it a bit harder to connect with people.

I found that the majority of my friends I made because I had classes with them or I met them through an internship. Those are the people ai felt I connected with the most but usually wasn‚Äôt the people who lived in my building. The small conversations and interactions matter. This could mean talking to a classmate that sits next to you as you wait for class to start. Before you know it, y‚Äôall have each other‚Äôs contact info and stay a few minutes after class to talk about the class. Then, you might meet up to study together or go to the dining hall together. Little things like that.

I‚Äôve also found that my closest relationships were built slowly overtime. You don‚Äôt have to instantly click and be BFFs with someone within the first week.

I hope this helped. I just don‚Äôt want you to come in here thinking that you have to settle for people that you don‚Äôt vibe with and the reality is that sometimes, it gets pretty lonely but you just have to be authentic and if you click with someone, great! Just don‚Äôt force it either. Let the relationship develop naturally."
SkincareAddiction,fnp07qb,t1_fnoxrtf,1587136911.0,That‚Äôs good to hear. Thank you!
SkincareAddiction,fnnr7a3,t1_fmyesrg,1587099381.0,OMG I also have butt acne! I should try this product.
UCSC,fnngvc1,t3_g2ommq,1587092074.0,"Also, I feel like UCSC is pretty welcoming of transfer students especially if you live at the Transfer Community. It will be much easier for you to meet more friends."
UCSC,fnngr4c,t3_g2ommq,1587091998.0,"I went to community college for three years before coming here. If you have any specific questions, feel free to DM me."
UCSC,fnma4vz,t3_g2m3qm,1587067753.0,Sounds fun. When will this be taking place?
UCSC,fnijhy8,t1_fni7k35,1586981071.0,Same.
UCSC,fnijgck,t3_g1z0k5,1586981048.0,LOL bruh are they making out??
UCSC,fnfnz3b,t3_g1hh0d,1586911874.0,I am assuming you would get a new mailing address since they are planning to close RCC but you should email your mail room.
curlyhair,fnfemym,t3_g193ym,1586906594.0,"Wow! Great curls! Also, the lipstick color looks great on you!"
santacruz,fnfel7p,t1_fnf45xi,1586906568.0,"Actually, there have been lots of cases all over the world including in the US where people in their early 20s with NO underlying health conditions have died from COVID-19."
UCSC,fnf62ij,t3_g1dq02,1586902075.0,I am pretty bored too. I am not as frustrated as you are but yeah. It wouldn't hurt to switch up a  little bit.
UCSC,fndtmc3,t3_g117lv,1586877255.0,I do not recommend the Village...
lacqueristas,fndthic,t1_fnds4ej,1586877183.0,"Thank you! It‚Äôs a polish from Covergirl that I bought about 6 years ago and I just used it up.

I am looking for a dupe because it really is a beautiful color."
lacqueristas,fndtb40,t1_fncxmb3,1586877090.0,Thank you! ü•∞
UCSC,fnarehr,t3_g0dia5,1586802488.0,"Nope. No date. No nothing. But I have heard of a few individuals being moved already. Someone lived at Porter B and was moved to C9/C10 and and another person I know was living at the UTC and was moved to the C9/C10.

I am assuming soon?"
UCSC,fn5khhk,t1_fn5hllb,1586667335.0,Someone who works at the dining hall said that they are just gonna serve the same thing from now on. I am getting tired of it too.

UCSC,fn0du3s,t3_fy77yw,1586540120.0,"I think you can walk to get your food but I don‚Äôt think they want outsiders coming and going on hikes and I don‚Äôt think they want students in groups either. I am sure if you explain to them that you are going to pick up your food, they will let you off the hook."
UCSC,fn0dlwu,t3_fy9rjp,1586540001.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt risk it right now. Police are probably gonna be on it this weekend.

Last week, I went on a little hike and I saw a couple police officers on campus here and there just patrolling the place. They even went to the Greater Meadow which is way out there."
UCSC,fn0demi,t3_fyk2dy,1586539896.0,"I am no expert but I think you will just pay the difference. I live in a single and I have a 7-day meal plan and I would have to pay about $1,700 each quarter. I know people who live in triples with a similar family income and they don‚Äôt pay anything out of pocket but I think it really just depends on how much financial aid you get.

I hope this answers your questions."
BadMUAs,fn0d2g8,t1_fmz04du,1586539721.0,"It is. She must have a really good skin care routine. Tbh, if that was my skin I probably wouldn‚Äôt even wear foundation üòÅ"

UCSC,fmrn5ab,t3_fwvsb2,1586328465.0,"I literally eat it off whatever dish is clean and I see first. Sometimes, it‚Äôs a bowl. Sometimes, it‚Äôs a plate. It‚Äôs still going in and coming out the same way regardless of what you eat it out of."
UCSC,fmrn1xk,t3_fwwt3i,1586328375.0,I would.

UCSC,fmls8g9,t3_fw1h2m,1586192273.0,"Well, they are moving everyone from the UTC to the main campus. I am not sure but I think everyone from there is gonna be moved to apartments."
