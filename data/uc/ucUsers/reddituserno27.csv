Every year older I get, the further away I get from my parents and the more I realize that things that seemed unavoidable are actually choices that my parents and I made. And all the little things too, like picking what you eat and stuff. It’s sooo nice!

My apartment is lovely, my friends are good people, my politics and health are my own! Not to mention all the drugs and alcohol..."
