California,fpjcbg6,t1_fpj5m0r,1588663383.0,">California loves doing things it has no authority to do... Legalizing weed, not working with ICE, ignoring immigration laws and IIRC something with Gay Marriage.

Respectfully, it appears you have some very large misconceptions about basic law within the United States of America.

Long story short, nothing you listed are things California (or any state) has ""no authority to do"":

States can decriminalize and explicitly legalize Marijuana. They have no duty to carry out enforcement of federal drug laws.

In the same way, states have no responsibility to enforce federal immigration laws.

These are very clearly covered by the 10th amendment: states are under no obligation *to enforce* federal statutes. Look up the Wikipedia article for the 10th amendment and read the ""judicial interpretation"" section.

Marriage is a state responsibility. The federal government has no authority to dictate who can and who can't get married, any more than the Feds can dictate who gets a driver's license or opens a business.

AFAIK, thre has not been any federal law that declared that a state could not issue a marriage license to a gay couple.  The federal government passed the Defense of Marriage Act in the 90s, which prevented *the federal government* from recognizing gay marriage- not the states.   This was ruled unconstitutional in 2012, and from then on the Feds have to once again recognize whoever the states say is married.

Lastly, I want to emphasize something to you. States do not derive their authority from the federal government. In the USA, *States have inherent authority* within their borders. They are only restricted by specific *limitations* within the constitution (ie, the bill of rights, etc. Oh, and that wasn't even a limitation until after the Civil War. If anything, the federal government is the one that is authorized to do things). The constitution plainly says that whatever is NOT EXPLICITLY LISTED as a federal responsibility is the inherent authority of the states themselves."

We all engage in assumed and calculated risk when we get into a car. But that calculation does not include people who drive like this.

I don't care that the road appeared empty.  That's one more reckless assumption.  The passenger should not have pulled the brake- but as I said... people in terrified panic don't think clearly.  And IF that's what was happening with her, then I don't see how he doesn't assume all the blame for what happened.  But even if that wasn't the case, even if she didn't say a word and just pulled it... what are the chances that the driver got her consent to put her in this race?  Where was her calculated risk?

A family of 4 in California making the CA median of $72,000 pays *~$1100 less* in state and local taxes than a family of 4 making the KY median of $50,000.

So not only is their state bailed out by blue states, they bleed their own poor and middle class citizens dry (their state income tax is almost just a perfectly flat 5%, while California's is extremely progresive)."

10 years ago I thought we had a plumbing leak under our slab. I called my insurance *to ask if it was covered*.  The agent told me to file a claim to find out. I did so.

Turns out that it was not covered. (and thankfully, turned out to be nothing).

However, 3 years later I called another insurance company to get a quote and they told me they wouldn't even quote me because there had been a homeowner's claim. I could do nothing about it but wait until they stopped caring.

So I'd call your agent and find out if it's covered first. Don't file a claim until you know."

But that's it.  When they just report news, it's fucking slow, and there's never enough detail.  And most of the time they are filling the time with talking heads, who spew very little of anything important.  


And though I use Reddit for my main news sources, I have a specific news feed set up with several subs that I have found to be relatively objective, that tend to aggregate from reasonable news sources both left and right.  I won't pretend that I don't see a lot more Huff Post articles than Red State articles, but I do my best to ignore both of those.

The sad thing is that you're right that everyone here complains, but it's simply not true.

[The overall tax burden](https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-highest-lowest-tax-burden/20494/) in CA (total income, property, and excise taxes divided by income) is 11th in the US, at about 9.5%.  Not even the top 20%.

Only half the states are below 8.5%, a savings of 10% on that burden. And to get below 7.5%... You have 8 choices.

If you care about being informed, Google ""state income tax calculator"" and play around with the numbers. Compare CA to other states for 4-person household incomes up to 150k.  Look at what rhe median incomes are and how much people pay in other states like Kentucky, or Illinois, or Idaho, Ohio, Kansas.

For example, a family making $130k would pay almost $2k more in Kentucky.

Hows this... A family earning the median income in ky ($50k) pays $1200 MORE than a median family in CA ($72k).

We had a massive windfall last year, above the 1%-er mark. All normal income. We would have saved about $12k in most other states. Are we gonna pick up and leave over $12k?

Sure, if you make $2M it's a lot.  But is it in perspective? If you make $2M a year, are you gonna move out of the state, away from friends and family over the cost of a Model S? 

CA has a major housing issue we need to deal with. Most of our problems stem from that.

But high taxes in CA is a myth."

Now Mitch (whose state receives a NET of $9100 per person on federal spending) thinks it's OK to let states go bankrupt.
