Granted I‚Äôve only been playing like a week, so perhaps I‚Äôll become more jaded, but I like it because to me there‚Äôs no stress or rush to do things. I can make my island pretty, get villagers I think are cute, and do my little daily chores."
NoPoo,fp7oca4,t3_gbh1hy,1588374471.0,"Something that I‚Äôve noticed makes a huge difference is the way I wash my hair. I‚Äôm not no-poo, just low-poo, but I‚Äôve noticed that if I really take my time, flip my hair upside down, and scrub, my hair stays looking clean at least 3-4 days when before it used to look greasy the 2nd day. You mentioned CG, what kind of conditioner are you using? If it has silicones, then that could certainly be the reason it‚Äôs staying greasier. CG recommends a ‚Äúreset‚Äù wash with a sulfate-shampoo, then using co-wash or low-poo. The sulfates are the only thing that can wash out the silicones, which is why it‚Äôs recommended to do one last wash with a sulfate shampoo."
vegan,fp3qm3n,t1_fp3gx3n,1588284022.0,I actually preferred this over oatly! Tastes exactly like how I remember vanilla bean ice cream tasting
911FOX,fp194gw,t3_galxne,1588227996.0,"Would love to see a Buckley‚Äôs Begin, story of Buck and Maddie‚Äôs childhood/them with their parents. Agree with everyone saying more Josh, I love Josh and I love the extra time they‚Äôve given him recently! New character would be great, would love another female firefighter, and maybe a little more screentime for Linda (the other 911 operator) or Terry. Also I think it would be great to give a little bit more recognition to the firefighters who aren‚Äôt in the main cast. Not that they need to be bumped up so much, but just some acknowledgement that they‚Äôre there."
911FOX,fp18u2p,t1_fp0z9kg,1588227746.0,Yes to both! I love Josh
911FOX,foyq90a,t1_foxnaga,1588177177.0,"That‚Äôs true, I was a little confused when it actually happened."
zelda,foxl2gf,t3_ga4kv4,1588147394.0,god i never understand how people do these shots!! very impressive
brooklynninenine,foxkwue,t1_foxgstj,1588147250.0,"yes, she was pregnant when filming (she was also pregnant in season 3). she gave birth this february"
relationship_advice,foxkjxs,t3_ga55tb,1588146916.0,"order his favorite delivery? In terms of random extra love, I love hiding random love notes around the house for my boyfriend to find"
relationship_advice,foxkdjx,t3_ga56a9,1588146752.0,"It seems like you did something that hurt him, he called you out, and you apologized. If your relationship is great, it doesn't seem like this would cause you to break up. The only reason this kind of ""sudden"" break up happens is because it's not sudden and it's an issue that has been building for a while."
Breath_of_the_Wild,foxjxjw,t1_foxd9na,1588146340.0,That was the first one I saw!
Lore_Olympus,foxjw4f,t1_fox5y47,1588146304.0,Angela Bassett as Demeter is 100% on point!!
911FOX,foxjnsw,t1_fowq9ci,1588146094.0,yeah their break up wasn't impactful since we barely saw them together
911FOX,foxjjxs,t3_g9dkcf,1588145994.0,If they did that I'd be seriously shocked.
911FOX,foxjigj,t1_fotm7hq,1588145957.0,"I agree, it is kind of redundant. Season two definitely saw him moving on. Just because he didn't end up in a relationship that stuck doesn't mean he hasn't moved on."
911FOX,foxjbsj,t1_fosxxbi,1588145786.0,"ughhhh that's what I hope. Especially since I doubt Connie Britton would want to be back for season 4, I hope that he's able to talk to her and move on"
911FOX,foxj8jp,t3_ga21zk,1588145704.0,"I agree! Buck used to kind of annoy me, but over the past couple of seasons I've grown to like him much more. I think they really improved his relationships, gave him a sister and a best friend instead of just Abby"
911FOX,foxj4pl,t1_foujis5,1588145611.0,"I feel like after the reveal that he was a peeper/rapist it makes more sense, like he probably was spying on her for a while"
911FOX,foxj25c,t1_foskrfg,1588145547.0,literally I was like... why would you immediately assume pet? wife seems like a much more obvious guess
911FOX,foxj02v,t1_fosmjll,1588145495.0,agreed. I was so relieved when they replaced abby with maddie and just gave buck a sister instead of another weird love interest
911FOX,foxixvw,t1_fou25ds,1588145442.0,"I agree, I don't like their dynamic or chemistry"
911FOX,foxitlz,t1_foso2q8,1588145335.0,deeeefinitely a segue into Abby returning
911FOX,foxirz1,t1_fow3sw7,1588145292.0,yeah she does not need that kind of thing again
911FOX,foxip7w,t1_foso40n,1588145223.0,"Doesn't seem like they would have left him, more like he left them when he struck out as an adult? I remember from when Maddie was introduced that she didn't even want them to know where she was."
911FOX,foxili8,t1_fotma5d,1588145128.0,I feel like that was a set up for a future flashback?
911FOX,foxikpb,t1_fospypc,1588145108.0,agreed!!
911FOX,foxiix8,t1_fosy6fe,1588145062.0,"I feel like this would be a good version of the so-and-so begins episode, since the first few episodes of season 1 were Buck as a newbie, which many of the Begins episodes have been, and we've seen lots of flashbacks of Maddie's life with Doug, so I think it would be cool to do a joint thing for their family life."
UCSC,fotagzm,t3_g99cnv,1588048523.0,I agree! I like being able to talk about what our professor is lecturing about without being distracting
ShittyVeganFoodPorn,fopqfsu,t1_fop2n2z,1587968847.0,Knew it! Love those
911FOX,fome468,t3_g7sq89,1587886735.0,"This seems to be an unpopular opinion, but I actually love Maddie"
911FOX,fomdveu,t1_fom6e5b,1587886493.0,"Idk if they‚Äôre saying he is bi, they‚Äôre not doubling down on it, leaving it super vague. I agree with someone above saying they‚Äôre tightroping it. And they are DEFINITELY aware of the online shipping of them, it‚Äôs been mentioned in the show quite a few times. Like that episode with the social media streamer with the big coming out of her face, the comments popping up on her Instagram live were all about how cute they‚Äôd be as a couple."
911FOX,folbx4e,t1_folaw24,1587858966.0,Yeah not exactly a fair comparison. When Maddie was actually in danger Buck was losing his shit.
911FOX,folbt3f,t1_fol870a,1587858902.0,I agree with this! I just love their friendship and I think it‚Äôs good to show a platonic relationship like this where they love each other so much.
911FOX,fodvbp8,t3_fp9425,1587690811.0,"Okay I guess I'm totally in the minority here then lol, cause I prefer JLh in the show over Connie Britton. It's funny that you say JLH is bland cause that's what I thought about Britton lol. I also never really liked Buck and Abby as a couple though, so maybe that influences our different opinions. They felt awkward to me and I didn't see any chemistry, whereas I actually really liked how Maddie and Chimney were good friends at first and fell for each other. But I think it's cool how we can have such different opinions over the same show!"

UCSC,fmpp4db,t3_fwmxnf,1586284803.0, My brother asked me to cut his hair today... we‚Äôve reached desperate times
JUSTNOFAMILY,fm9rw76,t1_fm9mnws,1585875179.0,That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking. Nan probably understood what OP had to deal with and was trying to provide a loving family member to feel safe with.
