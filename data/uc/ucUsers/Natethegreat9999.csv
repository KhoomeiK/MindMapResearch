UCSC,fnyhm66,t1_fnyfy5i,1587363348.0,"It depends on the grading option you chose when you enrolled in the class. It will appear as any other UCSC class, except for a note about the host UC campus. I hope this helps!"
UCSC,fnyfm2a,t3_g4kby9,1587361642.0,It’ll show up as “external grading” until they input you Letter grade (unless you chose p/np). Once it’s over it’ll have a note attached with the host campus and course name.
