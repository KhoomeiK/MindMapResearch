exmormon,fpj7qkt,t3_gdquq5,1588659115.0,Seminary sucks! It’s an extra hour of brainwashing in the wee hours. The teachers try to say crazy stats or “I know someone who left the church and look how bad his life is” to get people to stay in the church. It’s brainwashing for sure!

Parental pressure is hard to deal with and often, we succumb to their pressure (I’ve done that so many times, by the way). My parents think I’m the worthiest and most spiritual child too, ironically. I know how you feel when stuff you have been looking forward for a long time gets canceled thanks to COVID-19 because I dealt with the same thing. Our futures will be getting better one day, even though 2020 has been hell so far. I’ve even almost killed myself earlier this year. With your situation, given decision day is now in the past, just stick with BYU for a semester because you committed there and it would be hard to convince your parents out of it initially, and then get the fuck out of there ASAP. You are 18, you can make choices yourself. I believe in you. Class of 2020 will be strong, and you will be strong too!

Even though my parents are not that strict about electronics usage, their Mormon desires are so bad and so forceful that I’ve even almost killed myself over this. TBM parents want you to conform to them, and if you don’t, they’ll treat you worse, not take you seriously, and spread info about you to your relatives and grandparents (who heavily favor my parents).   
Hang on! If you feel like running away, do so (it’s not really much of a punishment anyway if you live in CA, if it’s even enforced). You won’t have to be with parents for most of your life. When you can leave safely, LEAVE! I will support you.

Feel free to DM me if you need help! I will understand a lot of your problems since I’m very similar to you age wise (just a grade and a year older than you)."

Oh yeah, wanna talk about yo problems to others, well sorry, your friends won’t understand you because they don’t know sh\*t about the church (which to be honest is a blessing).
