AskEngineers,fnm4tcc,t3_g2fw84,1587065103.0,"There are very few women in my engineering classes and in my major in general. I think one of the big issues is that all the ""Women in STEM"" initiatives are just about Computer Science. Mentorship, coding camps, female hackathons etc. are all aimed at bringing women into CS. Another trend I've noticed among my peers is that a lot of women are afraid of or intimidated by math, which could be a big reason.
I think this is an issue that needs to be fixed at a root level where more young girls are encouraged to pursue math and science."

One of my friends thinks that not having IG means that girls will think I'm a serial killer. I think her point is flawed because even if you were to look through someone's IG, you wouldn't see the real person because IG is just the fake image of yourself that you want people to see."
