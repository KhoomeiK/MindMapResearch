explainlikeimfive,fow8sp6,t3_g9wfww,1588115131.0,"Sports were generally recorded on tape using television cameras (as opposed to filmed using film cameras). Old television cameras used a sort of inverted TV screen to capture images: a lens aimed light at light-sensitive phosphor screen that would become more conductive in places where light hit it, and stay less conductive in dark areas. An electron beam swept across this screen from the back, and when it hit dark spots it would take longer (gross simplification) to leak through the screen than in light spots. The amount of current that leaked through the screen was converted into brightness values, and from there it was encoded into a television signal that was then recorded on magnetic tape. When a bright object moves quickly across the screen (as often happens in sports footage), the phosphor screen takes some time to revert back to its non-conductive state. This lag causes the camera to record a streak of light behind the bright object.

This video has a good demonstration of the phenomenon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAb1qpXoXck"

The only way a a magnetic storage medium gets demagnetized is if it experiences a change in magnetic flux strong enough to overcome the coercivity of the magnetic substrate and realign the domains in the medium. Due to the effects of hysteresis, to reverse the polarity of a magnetization, you'll need to apply a field stronger than the one used to magnetize the domain in the first place. As the write head of the hard drive passes a (relatively) large magnetic field though a tiny area, this amounts to a large bias that the Earth's magnetic field has no chance of ever flipping."

With an HDD, you have to wait for the platter to spin the requested data under the read arm; with an SSD, you can read data as fast as transistors would allow it (read: fuckin' fast)"
explainlikeimfive,fo5fwhq,t1_fo5eu8n,1587524672.0,"So there are several levels of complexity to this problem. Starting with the very basic level, the binary that's stored on the chip is interpreted by the SSD controller. This is usually manufacturer-specific -- e.g. a Phison controller would store data differently than a Samsung controller and vice versa. Once the data is read by the controller, it interprets it into a common 'language' that both the controller and the computer know how to speak. Most SSD's and motherboards know how to speak SATA, but some really fast SSD's (and modern motherboards) know a more efficient language called NVMe. The computer and SSD controller speak to each other over a cable, and the data that the computer requested is shuffled from the SSD controller to the computer's memory (RAM). To even make a request from the SSD, the computer must know where the data is stored on the drive. The data structure that maps filenames -- ""image.jpg"", ""doc.pdf"" -- to their addresses on the disk is known as a filesystem. The way this data is stored differs between operating systems -- Apple computers use APFS, Windows PC's use NTFS, and Linux boxes use ext4. These structures are mutually unintelligible, which is why you sometimes can't read a Windows hard drive under Mac. Anyway, the computer   uses the filesystem to look up the memory address on the SSD where the requested file is stored, and asks the SSD to send over a given range of bytes."
explainlikeimfive,fo5e4bb,t1_fo5dv57,1587523464.0,"yep! That's why SSD's have a limited shelf life. I answered this a couple comments down, but the gist is that yes, charge does tend to dissipate and without power to maintain that charge, it eventually (in many years) will cause corruption."

It's incredibly difficult, in the world of data storage, to eat your cake and have it too."
explainlikeimfive,fo57n3o,t1_fo54qaq,1587519276.0,"The transistors on a silicon chip don't look the spindly three-legged components you're probably thinking of -- under a microscope, a chip looks like a maze of silicon layers. 

The breakthrough that allowed us to make chips this small was metal-oxide semiconductor technology: by mixing other substances into the surface of a silicon chip, we can drastically alter its electrical properties. By stacking different layers with different mix-ins, we can create circuits consisting of microscopic switches (transistors), one-way valves (diodes), flow restrictors (resistors) and storage tanks (capacitors). Think of it as Minecraft redstone circuitry, but on a tiny scale. We stack these layers on top of each other by a process called photolithography. In essence, we draw a circuit layer on a large piece of transparent glass, coat a silicon wafer with a light-sensitive compound, and shine light through the transparency, through a magnifying glass, and onto the wafer. The areas that are struck with light (where the transparency permits) lose their coating, while the areas that remain in the dark keep their coating. The wafers are sprayed with mix-in chemical, and washed in acid again. We're left with one layer of a microscopic pattern. We repeat this process to stack more layers and complete the circuit, after which the wafers are tested, cut into individual chips, and encased in plastic packages with pins sticking out. 

This process is nowhere near affordable. Towards the end of the 20th century, we have gotten good at profitably cranking out chips at large scales -- a very difficult endeavor! The other limiting factor in the photolithography process, even with a perfectly-manufactured focusing lens, is the limited resolution of visible light! We can't focus beams of light onto areas that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light itself, which limits the visible-light photolithography process to a feature size no less than a couple hundred nanometers. However, AMD is currently manufacturing processors with transistors 7 nanometers small! They accomplish this by using shorter and shorter wavelengths of light, in a process called extreme-ultraviolet photolithography. In a few years, we'll get down to the point where transistors are no bigger than a few tens of atoms across, and at that point we'll hit a roadblock. At those scales, quantum fuckery is afoot, and engineers need to compensate for quantum tunneling and leakage effects and all sorts of weird physics. When we get there, we'll need to start thinking about alternative ways of making our processors faster."

Unless you move the rare-earth magnet over the chips fast enough to cause a significant induced voltage, a magnetic field (especially a stationary one) poses no danger to the data stored in the SSD."
explainlikeimfive,fo4up4u,t1_fo4sh6v,1587511577.0,"SSD's are what's known as non-volatile memory, so they don't need any power to keep storing data (fun fact, that's where the NVM in NVMe comes from). Of course, nothing is perfect, so a tiny amount of charge escapes from charged memory cells with time. Over time, this can cause data corruption. Compared to a hard drive, where the magnetic domains on platters remain magnetized in perpetuity as long as there are no external magnetic fields, SSDs have a limited storage life. Most manufacturers promise that their SSDs will retain data for 10 years without power, but this figure decreases in warm environments. However, the mechanical parts of an HDD can seize up with years of disuse -- I'm working on restoring a 1981 IBM PC whose hard drive actuator bearings have all but jammed.

To successfully carry out the plan and reach the right orbit, the rocket must launch at exactly T-minus 0. The countdown allows mission control to formalize a schedule of pre-launch procedures (instead of saying ""fuel the rocket at 9:36, and launch at 10:06:"", it's easier to say ""fuel the rocket at T-minus 30 minutes""). The rocket can correct for small deviations from the plan, such as in the case of a non-critical engine failure, but in general a launch follows the 'script' down to the second."
explainlikeimfive,fo4mjg2,t3_g5nc9w,1587507135.0,"On a very basic level, an SSD is like a large plastic sheet covered with a grid of those bumps that you see on soda-cup lids. To write a file to the disk, you pop and unpop the bumps to represent the file in terms of 1s and 0s. To read from the disk, you run your finger across them and feel the pattern of popped and unpopped bumps. 

These bumps are called flash memory cells, and there can be billions or trillions of them packed in several tens of layers on a silicon chip. They consist of microscopic transistors and capacitors, and they're 'popped' and 'unpopped' by applying a positive or negative voltage across them, which either stores a tiny amount of electric charge or releases it. To check the state of one of these cells, you can measure the voltage across it to see whether there is charge stored in that cell. A controller chip on the SSD receives read and write commands from the host computer and applies the necessary voltages to the right rows and columns of cells to write and read blocks of several thousand cells, called 'pages'. The exact format of the data on the disk is entirely up to the controller and may not be consistent across different models of SSD's -- so long as the controller implements a common protocol (SATA or NVMe, for example), the computer doesn't care.

These cells aren't perfect, and repeatedly writing and erasing a cell causes it to wear out and lose its ability to store charge. When this happens, the controller can no longer read from those cells, causing data loss. To combat flash memory wear, an SSD controller is smart enough to spread out the reads and writes across the many billions of cells at its disposal. This process is known as 'wear-leveling'. Even with this algorithm in action, a disk has a limited amount of read-write cycles before the probability of a data loss incident becomes more than negligible. This quantity is usually expressed in write cycles, where one write cycle consists of using every cell on the disk once. Because of this, larger-capacity SSD's take longer to fail on average."
