Sure, the temporary disappearance of facial hair and forced draconian quarantining of immigrants happened as a response to disease, but the former is mostly [attributed to razor marketing](https://www.vox.com/2015/3/1/8123457/beard-history-chart) and the latter disappeared pretty quickly after the Immigration Act of 1924 (i.e. immigration of 'undesirable' ethnic groups was significantly stymied, leading to a reduction of fear-mongering based around race, and present-day immigrants don't have to go through quarantine anymore) and while it did have practical purpose, it was generally driven by fears of ethnic minorities being ""unclean"" and ""diseased,"" a double standard that was applied to Asian/Irish/Italian immigrants but was far more lax to anyone coming from the United Kingdom, France, even Mexico prior to the early 20th century. He attributes Hindustani nationalist separatism to disease but actual academic historical consensus almost never cites disease as a prime factor, instead pointing to racial discrimination and massacres and everything else that was happening under the Raj at the time. See the 1857 Indian Revolt which led to severe racial suppression of Indians across the subcontinent and left a lasting impact on British India that would lead to the genesis of an organized independence movement, yet had almost nothing to do with disease.

He cites Snowden who I'm sure is a qualified historian and professor and I haven't ever read any of his books, but I'm not sure any of this is a cause for long-term sociopolitical change as the dude in the video tries to portray it, as much as a slight influencer in world events. [Snowden himself](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-pandemics-change-history) cites change as an aspect of public policy making rather than the *raison d'etre* behind it:

>""Part of the reason that this was so violent and sanguinary was that people who were in command saw that the working classes were dangerous politically, but they were also very dangerous medically. They had the very possibility of unleashing disasters on the full of society. I think that was really a part of this metaphor of the dangerous classes, and I think that led to, say, the inhumanity of the slaughter of 1871 after the Paris Commune had been put down."" 

Medieval Europe definitely changed after the outbreak of the plague in a way that carried down to the modern age and sure, contemporary public health systems emerged out of the late 19th century response to disease, but far more diseases were endemic back then than they are now and it doesn't seem to have particularly emerged as a response to any single pandemic. This video simplifies things to a degree that crucial detail is lost and cites disease as the cause of numerous historical moments that have a multitudes of other reasons behind them."

DunderMifflin,fodmvul,t1_focopwl,1587686665.0,"Eh, that was Robert California's character but it doesn't invalidate the concept. Sir Ian McKellen said as much in his lecture he gave at the Oxford Union, that he's a gay man but that it's never as simple as being gay, that gay is a label attached to/taken up by himself by the culture context but not something that he necessarily identifies with even if he's attracted to men. Stephen Fry mirrors a lot of this in his talks, specifically pointing to the fact that Oscar Wilde, a gay icon, was happily and devotedly married to a wife with whom he had multiple kids with. Homosexual was an *ex post facto* label attached to him, not one that he carried with himself, and his natural romantic attraction and relationship to his wife was still an integral part of his self expression that may have not been accepted or possible within the present binary or homosexuality vs heterosexuality even if his primary attraction and sexual relations were with men. I'm bisexual but I don't attach any weight to my own self identification, it's a label that I carry with me because people don't respond well to ""I'm attracted to all sorts of sexes and gender identities"" unless it's put in a box. Personally, if I was given the choice (ie sexuality wasn't a hyperdefined aspect of our current social discourse) I wouldn't identify as bi, I don't feel an emotional connection to the label and I'm attracted to whoever I'm attracted to regardless of if I slap a bi or pan label on an inherent truth of who I am, who I would be regardless of those labels existing."

changemyview,fnz7f36,t1_fny32q6,1587387974.0,"We could own businesses and houses, we could and did fund and participate in massive merchant enterprises (the Dutch East India Company was significantly funded by Jews and was also one of the most successful private enterprises of the 16th and 17th century). We acquired generational wealth in a way that black Americans were never even given the opportunity to. When they were, when they created a Black Wall Street in Tulsa, riots broke out and a campaign of ethnic cleansing killed hundreds of the richest black people in America overnight, their wealth mysteriously disappeared. Blacks, shortly after slavery, were forced to move en mass from the South in one of the biggest migrations ever seen (the Great Migration), becoming immigrants in their own country and having to completely restart their lives due to constant harassment and destruction caused either by the Klu Klux Klan and the redneck lynchmobs who'd riot over the smallest and most superfluous accusations. When they got to places like Oakland, Detroit or Chicago, they couldn't get mortgages for homes, they weren't given loans to open businesses, instead they were hired as low wage physical labor and redlined into ghettos that saw no investment by either the state or private companies. There was no capital to open their own businesses and nobody from the white community would hire them to actually give them a job---the rare manufacturing job could sustain a family but it wouldn't support an entire community. They didn't have voting rights to vote in politicians who would help uplift them, instead politicians for decades actively sought to destroy the community in every way they could (see Nixon's Southern Strategy, see the admission of I believe his Chief of Staff a few decades after his presidency that the War on Drugs was specifically targeted to oppress black people and Latinos). Then the crack epidemic hit, in part caused by CIA funding of Central and Southern American rebel groups who made their bread and butter the cocaine trade that would make its way directly into the black community via crack. White people got significantly less time for powder than black people did for crack despite their significant similarities and few differences. Black men got thrown in prison for half a gram of weed or a small amount of crack, not atypical for any poor community but subjected more on them by racist judicial and law enforcement systems because of their skin color. When they got out they had nothing, they couldn't get a job because no one wants to hire a felon and they became more likely to commit crime or join gangs as a last resort because they acted as rudimentary if exploitative support systems in lieu of any other. They got thrown in prison again, and again, and their kids didn't have good role models growing up and joined in on it too since things like drugs and crime became normalized in their households. And so the cycle of generational poverty relentlessly continues cause even if they or their kids wanted to get a job, they couldn't because there aren't jobs in their community, and they can't move out cause they don't have the money, and they can't get the money cause they can't afford going to high school much less college, assuming colleges would even accept them as products of their underfunded and undeserved school curciulums that do nothing to prepare kids for even the basics needed by increasingly rigorous admission requirements.

When it's said that racism is systematic it's not an exaggeration, it's that every part of America is built to work against black people in a way that it's never been for Jews. We came over from Europe poor but very highly educated. As immigrants we had mutual aid societies that blacks were never able to form, and we had the benefits of the generational wealth of individuals in our community who sought to uplift all of us as a people. We had the benefits of a cohesive highly interconnected community that wasn't actively hindered by the American legal system of by overt obvious signs of our Jewishness like our skin color. We passed for white in most of American history. How both groups got to where they are now is of the utmost importance in understanding why they are the way they are, entirely irremovable from their current situations."

Legal laborers literally aren't doing the work, that's more of a myth than anything. Crops are rotting at massive profit losses to agribusiness because they don't have enough migrant labor. You can debate the ethics of migrant labor exploitation but really the answer is to provide them with labor protections and better working conditions, not fuck them over. Fwiw the hardest working people I've ever known working in the shittiest jobs were my coworkers who were the children of undocumented immigrants, or undocumented immigrants themselves, and I can say without a doubt that had we just had the legal staff that we had in those jobs that I worked, we would've been getting a lot less done."

Look at the shit Driscoll's been accused of: everything from sexually assaulting undocumented workers to forcing them to work in conditions dangerous to their health, to not giving them breaks on 12-14 hour shifts, to straight up paying them $3 an hour or not at all. They put up with it because they and their families need the money, that doesn't make it right or okay or exploit them and they're objectively in every way being actively exploited all the time."
