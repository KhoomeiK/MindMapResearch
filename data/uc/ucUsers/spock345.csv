UCSC,fox9dqf,t1_fouz4xu,1588137419.0,"We only get paid 20 hours a week even in BSOE. 20 hours max is UC policy. The difference is mostly felt during the summer when it is possible for grad students paid as researchers to get the full 40 hours or through internships. Although even for those 20 hours a week some other departments are paid a significant amount less than engineering for being a TA. Most paid students I know of in BSOE take home something around $2k a month. In other departments I have heard of amounts as low as $1.5-1.6k a month. The extra $400 a month does make a significant difference and I am still not quite sure why they paid so much less for similar TA work.

UCSC,fos8q9i,t1_fos5lz9,1588026018.0,"Yes, it is not a sure fire thing yet but I see the wind blowing in a way that won't really benefit the strikers or UC. The interesting thing here is that the union will likely get the final word in. The charges regarding the ULP have been filed. If those don't move then they can easily drum up the needed votes for a strike given the spread to other campuses and the relative minority of people in the union who vote on such things as they are often those who are more likely to strike. The union is the only group that has valid legal complaints against both other parties. The strikers engaged in unsanctioned activity and the university decided to bypass the union on employment matters. They landed themselves in an ideal situation to further their own goals by initially doing nothing.

The union also has an interest in pursuing a raise of some sort. Which would be a path to more money in dues."
UCSC,fos2yie,t1_form6du,1588023021.0,Not pointless per say. They won the backing of the union for a state wide strike. So really a lateral move. Trade one kind for another.
UCSC,fos2mb8,t1_foqyhge,1588022846.0,"Really they lost one kind of leverage and gained another. They lost holding grades hostage, which wasn't really a large percentage of grades at this point. For that to have worked they would have needed a majority to start with.

They have gained a statewide unfair labor practice strike with the backing of the union.

The admin probably would have made exceptions to grades vs pass/no pass rules."
UCSC,form64d,t1_forb50y,1588014572.0,"The strikers were fully aware of the consequences and it was discussed many times through their mailing lists (I lurked for a while). The proportion who could be said to have a lack of concern for undergraduates was rather small as well. Sadly those individuals were the most vocal and zealous when the strike was in its infancy. In retrospect I feel that in that zeal and push to act they overestimated their power to create change while minimizing the collateral damage. Also underestimating how long the fight would be.

If I may ask, where would we be if people didn't push the boundaries of what a person can do by thinking about what a person should be able to do? Is that not how old ideas and the status quo are challenged? Idealism has its place and but should not be held in a cage by the status quo.

I would add that teaching is not the only role undertaken by professor at a research institution. Arguably the primary role is research and producing other PhDs, not teaching undergraduates. This is why we have lecturers.

Finally, there is often a correlation between pay and how much incentive an employee has to care even if said employment is their passion."
UCSC,fori4vn,t3_g94lc1,1588012628.0,"They will still be students but now subject to paying tuition unless they are employed as a GSR through grant money or have a fellowship.

The confusing bit is that grad students are most often both employees and students. The line between the two roles in practice is often very blurry as the subject matter of your work and study is sometimes the same. The university likes to emphasize that the two roles are completely separate but then pursue student conduct charges for actions taken as an employee instead of going through the employee process (talking to the union). The reason is probably because UC doesn't like dealing with the union because they have lawyers. That issue is one of the reasons that we now have a unfair labor practice (ULP) strike looming that is run by the union.

I imagine now that we may be seeing a system wide ULP strike that the union's lawyers get involved on behalf of the fired students. This may just result in the terminations happening through the proper procedures. While the UC and union lawyers go at each other some will drop out, others will likely try to graduate with a masters instead of a PhD,  and those who can will fall back on grants, savings, or loans."
UCSC,forhjcp,t1_for8wzi,1588012336.0,"I am not disagreeing that the timing is definitely not the best and it makes sense that they don't want to lose momentum. But I think the effect on rent is going to be more up in the air. It isn't as simple as tourists don't come and the supply increases. The past weekend has shown tourists are still coming, landlords may have more incentive to just sell properties, many tech workers who drive up the prices are still lucratively employed, etc. Too many variables and possibilities are present to assume that prices will overall go down. There may be an increase in off campus demand if fall quarter is online and those without alternative housing decide to rent here."

UCSC,focg3ik,t1_fobo6mh,1587670916.0,"Actively selling or keeping user information of that sort beyond a certain amount of time would be a crime (at least in the EU and California). Although the terms of the laws regarding user data are still vague and it wouldn't be hard for a copy of the data to exist beyond its time to live and possibly be leaked. Google's policy for data deletion tells users to expect data to be scrubbed from their servers in six months. Also doing business with the UC brings FERPA into the mix. Most, usually smaller, companies don't try to skirt the rules regarding this stuff. Incidents like Cambridge Analytica are the exception. If they are selling that much info then they are playing with fire.

If they were to sell any information, it would likely be metadata about its users with any personally identifiable information stripped. For many uses the metadata is the more interesting part anyway.

What worries me most is that they have a combination of sensitive information and root access to machines. That is a dangerous combo and it would only take one malicious person to do a lot of damage.

If you have a solid S shaped bracket connecting the two pieces of the rod then you should be good. Make sure there is no flexing in the bracket. To prevent that you should have at least two attachment points for each half of the rod. If you have a welder and a vice it won't be hard to make a simple bracket out of some scrap steel.

We only got the GLT trim on the 200 series. In 1980 it was a B21 four cylinder and in 1981 onward it was a B21 turbo. In general American cars got a bigger versions of European engines. We never had the taxes on engine displacements here. Just emissions requirements that choked cars well into the 90s. Imagine a 5.7 liter V8 only making 170hp. At least Volvo was ahead of the curve on that tech and weren't as bad as American four cylinders (see the Chrysler K platform).

There is no reason not to put a 4 cylinder in that car because at the end of the day it is not all about power but whether or not the car is fun. Slow car fast is a great time. Although I would make sure it has the multi-port injection setup. Install some modern ECU and tune it right and you can make some decent torque out of larger 4 cylinder engines.

VolvoRWD,fnjb4s4,t1_fnj5g8l,1586995446.0,"Volvo did use a turbocharged and sometimes intercooled D24 engine in the 740 and 760 diesels. Although those are relatively hard to come by. The cars were still significantly slower than the gasoline turbo cars which at that point were almost at 200hp if you count the 740/940 Turbo+ kit (special electronic boost control). 

The blocks can handle much more boost than Volvo originally gave them (with exception of the 86-88 B230's, thinner piston rods) but I feel like they probably held back by designing for reliability first and the lower torque limits of their manual transmissions, especially the M47.

By the 90's the naturally aspirated B230FX and B230FB were outperforming the original turbo motor and it isn't too hard to exceed that on a stock NA motor with well tuned EFI and the right cam."
VolvoRWD,fnj2sqi,t1_fninx35,1586990894.0,"I think that is the prototype setup for the B21FT.

The only differences that aren't bolt on are the 7.5:1 compression ratio (larger piston dish, 8.5-9.3:1 for the NA cars) and holes for oil feed and return drilled into the block. They got different intake manifolds and an oil cooler. Head bolts and gaskets are the same and generally these motors don't need an upgrade until you are well above 250hp.

The first few years of the B21FT didn't have intercoolers. Which was the case with many early turbocharged engines. The Regal T-type, Saab 900, Ford 2.3 Lima, and Volvo 240 all adopted intercoolers around the mid 80s. Volvos from half way through '84 onward had them and they sold a kit to convert earlier cars.

The end user ultimately makes decisions about what app accesses what data and hardware devices through operating system functions like access control. So long as the user has this power, there is not stopping the threat. Even if you are able to effectively isolate each application in its own little world, there are ways to break that isolation whether it be through a memory enclave, container, or virtual machine.

It shouldn't matter if a device has problems, yet they inevitably do. Programmers try to follow all protocols, access controls, etc but inevitably make a mistake somewhere or have to compromise to meet design requirements.

You can convert the pre-86 240's and 260's with the coffin hood to quad round headlights easily. It all bolts up. You will need a flat hood to mount dual round headlights to a 240. Although finding a set of period European spec lights is probably easier."
