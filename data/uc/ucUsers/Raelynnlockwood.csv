UCSD,fnsafkj,t3_g2t2kn,1587217143.0,Please no. I’m already a prisoner on my own apartment and the only thing I have to pass time is class. I don’t think I can take it any longer nonono I want to see my friends and just live a normal life
MtF,fnkr1dm,t1_fnk6e4a,1587037376.0,Actually that’s a really good idea!! I think that would explain the sudden name change lol. My name change isn’t legal yet so I have time to decide definitely but the middle name idea ain’t a bad idea
MtF,fnjgbbe,t1_fnj9eco,1586998387.0,"There was a character from some movie I watched, and she was very beautiful and elegant and feminine. And I remembered wanting to become like her so badly, so I went with her name. It means “queen” and I didn’t feel like a queen at that time, but I wanted to feel like one. I felt like I picked the name at the time trying to ease a lot of dysphoria I felt"
