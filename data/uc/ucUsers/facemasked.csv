UCSantaBarbara,fpjcgni,t3_gdppj3,1588663526.0,"My friend graduated with an Econ/Accounting Degree, but gave up on finance. He took all the classes at CC for easy 4.0 and then took the TEAS scoring 97%. Applied to CSULB, San Diego State, and Sac State aBSN's and got accepted at SD State, rejected from CSULB, and waiting on Sac State. He actually interviewed twice at CSULB and his stats were way the average, but they rejected him twice probably because he had a man-bun (I'm not even kidding).

CSULB's BSN program is pretty competitive though and they grade you purely on a point system. Not sure the logistics of it for sure, but GPA is like 6 points and TEAS is split into two categories worth 2 each. They interview the top scores and then send out acceptances.

Do research at the institution and see which professors and classes are better/worse than others.

 DIY is definitely cheaper I think because formal postbacc programs are pretty expensive per unit in comparison and there's no real difference in how it looks on your app. As long as you get a 4.0 in the classes you do take, it'll boost your app. Go to your local 4 year and take classes there.

UCSantaBarbara,fp0odnw,t1_fp0h845,1588213396.0,"Being overweight and being obese are two completely different subjects. Being overweight in America is almost a norm especially compared to other 1st world countries, however, being obese in America is a much more serious outlier. My point is that obesity will be stigmatized no matter what facet of society you are in and to say that UCSB itself is immune to these biases would be the most ignorant statement to mislead OP. 

Implicit Association Tests have shown that obesity is negatively associated with many perceptions such as laziness, stupidity, lack of discipline, etc. Clearly unconscious biases will effect our perception of people who we have never seen before or talked to. This is the exact mechanism upon which discrimination takes place. 

Just because these negative connotations are associated with obesity does not mean obese people ACTUALLY display these characteristics, but it does mean that many people will feel this way. College students in general might be more mindful about these characteristics and refrain from outright displaying these biases, but at the end of the day that is just their front-stage behavior. To believe that UCSB students are more morally superior to the general populous would be confirmation bias. 

You don't have to be skinny to go here, but OP is asking about social life and their social life will be much harder because they are obese that's it.

UCSantaBarbara,fp0eav8,t3_gad7tb,1588207602.0,"Not sure why everyone is coddling you here, but the truth is it's harder to make friends when you are obese. Psychology has proven that people build steong first impressions based on looks and no matter how great of a person you are on the inside, they won't know that unless they interact with you and change their perceptions about you. Obesity is heavily stigmatized throughout society and UCSB is not an exception. 

I'm sure you will still be able to find great friends and have a great time as long as YOU have supreme confidence in yourself. The harsh reality is that the more overweight you are, the less attractive you are to society in general. I do not encourage body dysmorphia or any of that stuff, but losing weight and getting to a healthy body weight would do wonders for your confidence and social life at UCSB."

A midterm and a final I think, both take home essay style questions and one ""original"" research paper you plan with your TA.

csusm,fopvnl5,t3_g8huf8,1587973656.0,"This really depends on your profile. If you are a fresh grad and BIO MAJOR and you take the courses again at a community college it will be a **BIG red flag** because it will look like you are dodging higher education curriculum. If you are a non-trad humanities major or something along those lines it won't be looked at as suspiciously. This is straight from the mouths of many ADCOMs who review applications, which you can find if you do a quick google search. 

If you haven't taken any of these courses before and you work hard it's relatively easy to get a 4.0 in Biochem, Ochem 1&2, Genetics, Physiology whatever. I'm in the pre-med postbacc here and I've gotten an 4.0 in 40+ units, so it's definitely achievable. The averages in my classes were a B-, so there are a good amount of As given out.

IDK if you plan to take it through open enrollment or extended learning? The difference here is that through extended learning you are taking it with the post-bacc people, specifically the cohort behind me which is like ~20 people? A lot of the people in these programs specifically want to go into the medical field too so it might be competitive. The OCHEM teachers are good, the bio teachers are EH, but an A is achievable. 

If you are taking it with the undergrads, I believe all of my professors have told me that the undergrads tests are mainly multiple choice. OCHEM and Biochem in the post-bacc were almost exclusively free response. 

I'm a firm believer that the cream will rise to the top, so it shouldn't matter which part you take it in. If you want to get into medical school this debate between community college and CSUSM should be over MONEY and not over EASE. The gatekeeper is the MCAT because there are tons of people with 4.0 GPAs, but not many with a 515+. 


TLDR:

If you are an older non-trad with no science courses Palomar college is fine. 

If you are a ""reinventor"" low cGPA low sGPA with a biology related degree you have to take courses at a four year."

Mcat,fnrsa8n,t3_g3h8vt,1587199650.0,"The question asks how can you maximize energy so you should think joules instantly. Work is measured in joules and they give you the work equation. 

Disregarding everything else and just looking at the equation how will you make Wx the largest value you can? You want the change in vertical distance to be the highest delta Z and you want the angle to be the highest it can be. B and D should instantly be eliminated because they have small delta Z values. If you don't lift your legs very far off the ground your displacement in the Z axis is very small. If you lift high your displacement is a high Z value. Then it's between A and C. 

The passage states that theta is the angle of ground reaction forces with the vertical related to the angle at which the body is leaning forward. This means that an increase in the angle means the body is leaning forward more. As tan(theta) approaches 90 degrees it will constantly get larger, (tan 0=0, tan 45=1). To maximize Wx, you want to be leaning forward creating a higher angle than 0 degrees. The answer is C based on maximizing Wx."

Mcat,fnhcl79,t3_g1m474,1586959800.0,"1) Alpha carbons would only be more acidic in an anhydride scenario. This is a carbonyl attached to the ring probably has a pka of 20. The OH has a pka of 15 and thus is more reactive. In general, OH will always be deprotonated in most solutions. Look up a pKa table and memorize the relative values.

2) EWG increase acidity. EDG increase basicity. Therefore, amides make a compound LESS reactive, while esters make a compound MORE reactive. It does this by dispersing the charge via inductive and resonance effecrs. EDG/EWG charts are useful for this."

Mcat,fnbsnnh,t1_fnbra3k,1586821534.0,"Yep, that's right basically any reaction that involves a hydroxyl group will be mitigated like esterification (hydroxyl group does not exist anymore), but the new COMPLEX as a mesylate or tosylate will be a good leaving group in comparison as you can displace the ions of the oxygen.

This is due to the relative reactivity of carbonyls. I believe it goes acid chloride> acid anhydride> aldehyde>ketone> ester>amide. Thus, the ketone of the ring will become protected first (higher reactivity) before the ester para to it. Protecting groups with diols are good for these ring reactions, say you had an acid chloride and a ester para to eachother but you only wanted to reduce the ester. You would protect the MORE reactive group with the diols and then perform the reduction, afterwards deprotecting. Hope this helps!"
Mcat,fnbj0ih,t3_g0rq67,1586816387.0,"It makes it a protecting group in the same way diols can be used as protecting groups of carbonyls. In this sense, they stop the hydroxyl group from undergoing certain reactions such as oxidiation and deprotonation (leading to cyclization in some cases), which can be useful in situations where you would want to react a different part of the molecule. After the reaction takes place, heat is used to remove the protecting group and regenerate the hydroxyl. 

Mesyls/Tosyls will still be good leaving groups for simple nucleophilic addition in most cases, as the nucleophile will attack and displace the mesyl/tosyl."
