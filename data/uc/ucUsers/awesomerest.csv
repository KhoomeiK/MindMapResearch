I'll admit though, it was definitely derivative and the storyline was simplified (which I wish it wasn't so), but I really appreciated the cinematography, set design, and take on the near-future. I'm hoping season 4 gets back on the same level as s1/2."

His films have substance and you'd be blind to not see it. Yeah he's been influenced by Perfect Blue/Kon but that doesn't negate his interpretations and pacing of the tortured artist whether in The Wrestler or Black Swan.
