UCI,fowi9z0,t1_fowh113,1588120310.0,Yup that's what I think is gunna happen. We are probably going to have some in person lectures with social distancing. Students are gunna be encouraged to watch lectures online but have the option of going to lecture but will have to keep some social distancing. I see this happening unless in the Fall things get much worse or stay the same.
UCI,fol30ak,t1_foj88hg,1587853881.0,How is he teaching his class?
UCI,fo5woj3,t3_g5dgkh,1587538162.0,"GPA isn't bad. But over the summer or this quarter if you have the time, I would work on some side projects. If you lack work experience, personal projects are the perfect way to show off your skills. So for sure try to work on an interesting project that is a bit complex and have some visuals. A web app or app would be a great project."
LaptopDeals,fnt8e1q,t3_g0o308,1587236597.0,"* Budget: \~850
* Country: USA
* Screen size: 15 inches or less
* Touch Screen: Doesn't matter
* Screen Resolution: 1080
* Does battery life matter?: Somewhat, I would like for 5 - 7 hours of battery life
* What tasks will laptop be used for ( gaming, video editing, graphic designing, modelling, regular computing tasks, word processing etc) ?: School and light gaming. I'm majoring in Computer Science and I'm on my last year. So I would like a pretty decent computer that has fast loading times. As for gaming, I don't plan to play games at the highest settings or play the newest games on the market. Some games I plan to play are stuff like CSGO and other older games.
* Weight: \~5 pounds
* **Any other important details ?:** Would like some decent storage. 500 GB would be ideal. 1TB would possibly be overkill. A good keyboard would also be ideal. I really enjoy Lenovo Thinkpad's keyboard so something similar to that would be the best, but not a total deal breaker. Also at least 8GB of ram."

UCI,fn1crah,t3_fyk2pa,1586559325.0,They ain't gunna do shit. Irvine Company can care less if there's a pandemic going on. Unless they are required by law to lower costs or forgive breaking leases they are not going to do anything.
