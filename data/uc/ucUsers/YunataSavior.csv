1. The disease is FAR less severe than people think. See: the many dozen antibody tests coming out.

2. The economic impact of these excessive measures have created a ""time bomb"": once it explodes, we're *really* *screwed*.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a proud Democrat: I would be greatly disturbed if Trump gets to choose RBG's replacement, but we all need to face reality.

forsen,fnfmtrb,t1_fnfg3f1,1586911200.0,"Let's say that you are a rich farmer who owns a farm in the far countryside.

You: the Operating System, The farm: Your computer.

You own large tracts of land, a house, and lots of animals (computer resources: your disk, RAM, the CPU, the GPU, your network card/adapter, etc.) You also have a beautiful wife and a loving family forsenCD

You have full control over all of these resources (Ring 0 permissions), but you cannot farm alone. Thus, you hire farmers (Ring 3, or user applications) to til your land, harvest your crops, etc.

There are also administrative tasks (wages, human resources) that you alone do not want to handle yourself. Also, these tasks are handled on an as-needed basis, but they require people who have more privileges than a simple farmer (you don't want farmers setting their own wages, else they'll take all your money). These people can control wages, allocate/deallocate plots of land per farmer, and even outright fire farmers. However, they cannot burn down your farm, else you can just kill them outright.

These administrators are similar to Ring 1 and 2 processes: they run as privileged tasks, but they cannot fuck up your farm or do things that only you can do.

Now, it seems like you only need to hire people who exist at Ring 1 through Ring 3 privileges, right? Not according to Riot Games...

Now imagine: some random dude from a giant corporation (a corporation that has ties to the Communist Chinese government) comes to your farm and says ""Hey, want to plant some cool and new exciting crops? I'll let you do it, but give me Ring 0 permissions!"" You may think ""Sure, why not?""

But, now this random dude can do whatever the fuck he wants on your farm:

* Hire/Fire/Kill random administrators? Yup.

* Build/destroy houses? Yup.

* Allocate land all to himself and kick out all the other farmers? Yup.

* Fuck your wife? Yup.

* Usurp your ownership of the farm and take complete control? Yup.

In theory, this random person *shouldn't* harm your farm, and you can predetermine exactly what this person because they maintain a log of possible actions, and conditions for those actions (driver code).

**BUT:** if one of those instructions are ""Take a phone call from the outside and do whatever the other person tells you to do"", then you're *fucked* if some random dude phones in and says ""Kill him"".

**Why do we need to give some random dude so much power?**

The corporation this dude works for is paranoid that you'll just hire your brother (at Ring 0 permissions, whom you totally trust since he's your bro) to beat the shit out of the dude and have the random dude feed the corporation false information.

But... no.... You have to give a random dude, from a sketchy background, potentially full control of your farm if you want to til his special crop."

The more inner you are inside the city, the more laws you can enact for people in the city.

Usually, most people in the city are in the furthest ring from the center (user processes).

Your Operating System (OS) resides in the inner-most ring (the inside circle).

Those user-processes cannot affect your OS, but your OS can do whatever it wants. But you trust it, since it's the root of your computer. Think of your OS as a ""king"": very powerful, does whatever it wants.

However, Riot wants you to install a program, ""Vanguard"", that literally has the same power and control as your ""king"", just to play a fucking video game.

You're letting some jester come to the inner-most ring of your city. You put a lot of trust into that jester, then you say ""Do whatever you want to my city, jester""."
