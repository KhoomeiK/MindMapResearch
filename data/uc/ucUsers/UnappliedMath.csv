ucla,fom6nxq,t1_fojvyip,1587879862.0,Lol I was being facetious but I guess it wasn't too clear
ucla,fojvql3,t1_fojcpyv,1587830380.0,U didn't know Orion is racist?
ucla,fo5j67v,t1_fo4vcy5,1587526937.0,Why are you so helpful
ucla,fnjhh0e,t1_fnjcepq,1586999056.0,Yes I think you're right. I believe during the meeting that Orion was pushing for either such an accounting to be made available or have increased accessibility. Although I do not anticipate such an accounting to be very reassuring. It seems that either the benefits of being a USAC affiliate are too large or there are too many non-student support staff receiving full time wages and benefits.
ucla,fnh9kdg,t3_g1i25k,1586958029.0,One of the most expensive line items is administrative overhead. Just how big is the bureaucracy of USAC?
ucla,fnh87y4,t3_fypxpl,1586957179.0,"USAC Zoom meeting and password should be posted on myUCLA or CCLE. Then they have limited excuses for removing people. I think we all now know why they wanted to remove people during this past meeting.

Also, please vote in the next election! Vote against the fees referendum, vote for Orion, and vote for anyone who isn't in For the People!"
ucla,fnh2sx7,t1_fn3x09z,1586953326.0,"Did he receive the 8k?

Edit: switched the numbers in post"
ucla,fnh29bf,t1_fn2lsz8,1586952895.0,"No, no, no. I'm very sure that Robert Watson in fact spent 60k for him and everyone *except for* Orion to airbnb in San Diego. You must have misinterpreted something."
ucla,fnh1gak,t1_fngy2dg,1586952217.0,"I think you should make this into a post on this subreddit. Might earn you back all that karma you've been losing. If I understand correctly then, the only thing the council is voting on is whether to place the fee on the ballot, which all students will have an opportunity to vote against in around 18 days. Please verify.

ucla,fnh10mf,t1_fngwvqc,1586951845.0,Oh I think it's fine. You don't need to talk about professionalism. We all heard what we need to hear.
ucla,fngxmpd,t1_fngv7km,1586948699.0,"This document only contains the student union fees.

Who is the CUB? Council of Unelected Bureaucrats? Where can I find their FAQ?

And it seems you're missing the point, perhaps deliberately, that regardless of whether or not USAC handles collected fees, if the mechanism of a fee increase is a USAC vote, it seems apparent USAC has the power to prevent an increase in fees.

It really feels like most of USAC would like to claim the responsibility for the benefits of a fee increase without having the responsibility to increase the fees. And I really do insist that USAC can only claim both or neither."
ucla,fngt34h,t1_fngci7m,1586943932.0,He is completely incompetent
ucla,fkfno1p,t3_fi3p8n,1584138467.0,Tbh I haven't paid for spring housing yet and I have no intention of doing so unless a date for in-person classes is confirmed.
