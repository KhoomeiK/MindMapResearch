As for good things...I finally got my friend set up with New Horizons so we get to visit each other. Was a gigantic headache to figure out and now I have two copies of the game, but yay!"
UCSantaBarbara,fo8i7ji,t1_fo8hkf8,1587597049.0,Thank you!

Also, if you want the hat just HMU. I only have the blue tassel though, didn't get the yellow one and now I'm kicking myself for it :("
UCI,fo5k6x0,t1_fo5jrij,1587527658.0,That was definitely not what I had in mind when naming my island lol but thanks! :)
UCI,fo5jipa,t3_g5u1lh,1587527182.0,"My friend is (was) graduating this year but with COVID-19 there's no ceremony, so I made this for her to wear for the in-game ceremony I'm planning. I know it's really simple but I'm not very good at designing clothes in this game :(

I plan on making variations with leis during the weekend if I remember to!

Edit: Oh yeah, if anyone wants the hat just HMU. ~~I only have the blue variation though, should've bought the yellow one too :(~~ I have the blue and yellow tassel hats available for cataloguing! :)

Edit 2: [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/DwHM2Kl/) the design for those of you who don't have the Able Sisters unlocked yet (or if you don't have online). Feel free to change the colors!"

AnimalCrossing,fn599vr,t1_fn58xfc,1586659029.0,You have to wish on shooting stars for a chance at getting them the next day. Sometimes you'll get meteor showers on your island (Isabelle announces it the day of and they last from 7pm-4am). They'll wash up on your shore the next day (might take a few rounds for them to all wash up).
AnimalCrossing,fn55mts,t1_fn52cdq,1586656499.0,"I might just be used to the lack of community since I never interacted with other players prior to playing New Horizons (played New Leaf and Wild World solo), but even knowing that other people were doing amazing things with their towns I still had a lot of fun decorating my town and my home. My town/island may not be as perfectly planned/aesthetic/completed as others, but I like how it looks and that's what's important (to me). 

Seeing all the community pictures give me *ideas* for my own island, but I don't necessarily feel like my island's any worse than theirs since I started later. If I had started playing at the same time as launch-day players, I bet my island would look a lot messier because there's so many things players didn't know about at the beginning and starting later allows me to learn from their mistakes. 

I'm rambling now so I'll stop, but my point is: just because you're starting later than others doesn't mean the game's not worth playing. Since you're starting later, you have more resources at your disposal that can help you catch up with the early players (island planning, Bell farming, time traveling if you're into that, etc). This game is very much still in its infancy and there's a lot more events that are coming up, so I don't think starting 3 weeks later is a reason to not play a game you'll enjoy."
AnimalCrossing,fn54kdx,t1_fn52g51,1586655767.0,Next day. You get them all at the same time.

AnimalCrossing,fn51zhw,t1_fn51fon,1586654026.0,"Do you think you'll enjoy the game? I wouldn't worry about what others are doing. The whole point of the game is to play at your own pace anyway. I barely got the game last week and I'm having a blast, even though I'm weeks behind launch-day players."
