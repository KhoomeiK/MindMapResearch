Your I-94 should say D/S.

Transfer your I-20 to your grad school, and you’ll be fine

Edit: by transferring I20 I mean transfer your sevis number"

I ended up having it removed because I had acne on it (treated then gone) then started to have more and more periods on year 2. I had maybe 4 periods during the first year, it was a big deal for me to not have periods, so when I start to have one every month among other issues(soreness before periods) I got it removed. The removal process was.. kinda scary. The doctor was digging around for a solid 10 minutes and I got kinda worried, but apparently they consider that normal? Maybe she just didn’t want to scare me."
