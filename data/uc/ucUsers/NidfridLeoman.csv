UCI,fpibze9,t3_gdmc3u,1588637790.0,Does anyone know what they're actually gonna do for this? Are they gonna read off names or just have some speakers or something?

rocketry,fpe20w2,t3_gcx3ya,1588538786.0,"I am not entirely sure what you are asking here, so please clarify a bit. I think I might understand your question, and that is something along the lines of: What variables do you have control of and what are the trends at different temperatures, chamber pressures, etc. I'll try to answer that question.

So liquid oxygen is an oxidizer. If you are familiar with the combustion chemical equation, you require a fuel, typically a hydrocarbon, and an oxidizer to produce carbon dioxide and water. 

So, in a liquid engine, once you choose your propellants, you have control over the pressure that you combust them at and the ratio that you combust them at. 

Thrust is a function of the mass flow rate and the exit velocity. Higher efficiencies (Isp) are gained from higher exit velocities, which are directly related to the square root of combustion temperature over molecular weight of the propellant reaction gases. So, to get a higher exit velocity and higher efficiency, you want higher chamber temperatures and lower molecular weights.

So, when you control your chamber pressure and your mixture ratio, your combustion reaction for a given choice of fuel and oxidizer will burn at a given temperature. Typically burning more oxygen than fuel in relation to the stoichiometric ratio is ox-rich and produces a hotter burn, while fuel-rich produces a cooler burn. 

You control your chamber pressure based on the feed system of the engine, whether it be a pressure fed engine or an engine with turbopumps. You increase the pressure of your two propellants to set a desired chamber pressure, accounting for system pressure drops.

At that ratio you are mixing fuel and oxidizer, you put more total mass flow at the same ratio to produce more thrust.

If you want to see how these things are related, try out NASA CEA. You can choose what you want to combust, the pressure and ratio you combust them at, and see what the molecular weight, ratio of specific heats, temperature, etc. will be. 

Please note that the pressure ratio affects some of theses values, but for outlining these trends simply, I assumed that you are operating at a given ambient pressure and that the nozzle is perfectly expanded. (You set your exit pressure to exactly match the ambient pressure, which is another value that you can control)."
UCI,fowmn76,t3_g9zbnl,1588122795.0,Stay strong brother.
orangecounty,forwsdm,t3_g94awj,1588019880.0,So sad but that is the reality
UCI,foleao5,t3_g83ssh,1587860383.0,Definitely wherever you'll accumulate the least amount of debt. Both are great schools and you will have great job prospects from either.
UCI,foekc52,t3_g71slq,1587706060.0,Yea I gotta catch up. Midterms are coming
rocketry,fo83jqp,t1_fo83c9m,1587589274.0,No problem! :)
rocketry,fo837nf,t1_fo74ujl,1587589106.0,"I'm aware of flame arrestor arrests, I am not sure if that is the same thing you are referring to, but it stops a flame from propagating back into your fluid system. Basically it is like a check valve. I can't think of a reason you would need to use a flame arrestor. 

An example of a flame arrestor is if you're venting methane gas but don't want to release concentrated gaseous methane into the atmosphere, so you install a flame to burn off the methane, but you also don't want that going back into your system, so you install a flame arrestor."
rocketry,fo833wf,t1_fo75dsm,1587589053.0,"I would say it really depends on what your are trying to make. About the highest chamber pressure I would expect to see from an amateur is 1000 psi. But there is nothing wrong with choosing a 100 psi chamber pressure.

Higher chamber pressure gives more ability to do work, more ability to produce thrust, higher Isp, at the cost of heavier/pricier propellant tanks, valves, etc. So I don't know if there is a general psi range, it just depends on what sized engine you want to build and how much you are willing to spend.

With pressure-fed engines, your tank pressure has to be higher than your chamber pressure. You're going to be limited by the strength of your pressure vessel and the pressure rating of valves. Higher pressure rating valves will be more expensive.

The static pressure that you have your tanks at will not be equal to the pressure when your system is flowing with fluids (dynamic pressure). So you will experience losses from regulator droop, head loss from friction + valves + fittings, pressure drop across the injector, etc."
rocketry,fo830dd,t1_fo76vj6,1587589003.0,"Yes, one way valves (check valves) are very important to protect components from back flow. Brass or stainless steel can both work so long as you check material compatability with everything else in your system. So compatability with propellants and also compatability with the metals you will be using (you don't want corrosion from different metals in your plumbing touching). I am familiar with stainless steel."

betterCallSaul,fncp654,t3_g0x26i,1586842807.0,I am not okay.
UCI,fn7yohg,t3_fzvxqq,1586730299.0,"Yeah I go to sleep at 3-4am, get woken up at 8am by my family being noisy, can't fall back asleep again until 10am, then wake back up at 1pm to get up for the day. It is a viscious cycle, but I have made a schedule to get back on track. I basically will just go to sleep/wake up earlier by 30 minutes every 3 days. Hopefully I can stick to it."
