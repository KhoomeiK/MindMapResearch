self,fpe2kdo,t1_fpe2dp1,1588539089.0,Thank you for the insight I didn’t really think of it this way since I’m so prone to find fault in myself. Thanks again
Breath_of_the_Wild,fpboxu2,t3_gcdabt,1588475106.0,It’s me this post.. it me.. I did not even know I could use octoballoons until I joined this sub lmao
Breath_of_the_Wild,fp65571,t3_gbgubd,1588346254.0,Ey! Happy for ya! I still gotta beat it I never make it past the first break room so I got my work cut out for me loll.
orangecounty,foxfbbs,t3_g9zzko,1588142248.0,Thanks a lot for this. Tbh I feel like I might be at risk so this information really helps!
UCI,fosrq64,t3_g97nhk,1588036679.0,I feel the same. I have to work and it’s just excruciating seeing the amount of cars on the freeway after work. I know we gotta stay positive and also I don’t know everyone’s story but it’s difficult
Breath_of_the_Wild,foqshbs,t3_g8zgvl,1588000010.0,Literally forgot to take a photo of the bow of light. This just reminded me probably will redo it just to get it lmaoo
UCI,fojewg4,t1_foirntw,1587818907.0,Same here I’ve been in literal hell for all the things I have to juggle ie work and school. So having professors who have been extremely understanding is a god send
college,fohds7g,t3_g77txs,1587764268.0,I go to UCI and usually what one UC does the rest does as well and they haven’t said anything about it. Specifically UCI. I believe Berkeley might be speaking about the options but I don’t know about the rest
Advice,foft4a6,t3_g72pmy,1587742350.0,I never had this specific situation but I’m all aware of being shamed for even liking a man. I’m sorry I can’t offer up solutions since I’m looking for someway to leave as well. But I hope you can find it
self,fofsz7i,t3_g742bk,1587742280.0,"Honestly I think it’s great that you did this and I can’t image what fast food workers have to deal with. I’m essential too but I don’t work food. Customers in general are sometimes really cruel. And despite the situation they may act the same way so I really feel for them tbh. 

Customers at my work have been somewhat understanding but I’ve encountered people who’ve straight up ignored me when I couldn’t help them due to lack of employees"
AsianParentStories,fodsq2m,t3_g6qwq4,1587689421.0,"My mother used to say similar things. And she would actually look through my phone if I left it out when I was a kid. At that point, I didn’t discuss much of my problems with people nor did I engage in drinking or sex lol so I didn’t have much to hide but the idea that she just had to look irked me. So without telling her I put a passcode on my phone and laptops for the last decade or so. She would comment here and there about why I would lock my devices and honestly I’d just dismiss her comments and say that they mine so why does it matter. Eventually she learned that I didn’t care about what she said so she shut up indefinitely about it.

Same reasoning behind locking my door and turning off my location when they tried to track me. At first I was scared to tell the truth but when I had a chance I just honestly said it was creepy for them to track me.

At first it didn’t seem an issue but then my mother with all her hysterical and over controlling behavior would look at my location and freak out. I think I was in the vicinity of a planned parenthood in Santa Monica (they literally have that clinic so close to the shopping area/parking lot lol so I mean if inaccurate it’ll look like I’m there) and she kept obsessively calling me. It’s overwhelming and feels like I’m in an abusive relationship lol.

That’s what’s kind messed up about this ya know. Cause you hear the type of behaviors that your parents do in people who’ve described abusive relationships with their SO. But obviously I’ve encountered some people saying this is just normal “strict” parenting. It’s one thing to be vigilant but it’s another to be trying to control a person and invade their privacy.

It sucks to go through all this. And every time I read something on here like this I feel bad that a lot of people experienced the same things I have"
exmuslim,fodrwyd,t1_fodrdkr,1587688984.0,Ooh I forgot about turkey bacon. I’ll try that when I get the chance then! Idk I’ve been trying to get accustomed to pork this year. But idk when it comes to pepperoni and bacon I just can’t handle the taste. Sausage tasted just like the beef hotdogs I ate so probably why it was easier for me to eat.
exmuslim,fodknd6,t3_g6u8y3,1587685871.0,Tbh I’ve only grown accustomed to sausage which I love but bacon I cannot even manage to eat. Idk why but i just cannot even try to eat it even though I’d like to lmao..
depression,fodjsmt,t3_g6jgq0,1587685571.0,"Tbh I always questioned my emotions or even me having depression because I didn’t seem to mirror the symptoms entirely (ie not doing much/staying in bed). Probbaly overly dramatized portrayal but idk I had good days so I felt maybe I’m just dramatic.

My entire life I’ve been called overly dramatic or had my feelings invalidated. I was the youngest so my feelings and opinions didn’t matter and weren’t valid.

All in all I’m sorry you’re going through this. I can relate a lot and honestly I’m exhausted by it too"
UCI,fodhinz,t3_g6rl93,1587684760.0,I can relate to this. I’ve grown a lot more depressed because of all this. It’s literally unbearable and I have to work even MORE because there’s no employees and no money to hire employees. I’m not getting paid much either for all the hours I put in but I’ve tried to let that go since there’s no money lmfao. Honestly I have little motivation doing the assignments I do now. I considered dropping out but I live in a toxic household so I would delay whatever chance I have to leave. And now a holiday is coming up. And being non religious I have to do it anyways or I’ll be homeless since I’ve been threatened with being kicked out if I don’t practice religion lmfao. So I get it. I’m stuck in my own personal hell as well
college,fo5utwt,t3_g5o8hg,1587536410.0,"To be honest, I’m public health so obviously you would expect it to be used frequently... but in actuality no. I’ve had one discussion post on it but that was optional. And maybe the occasional mention in lecture as a “real life example” but tbh it wasn’t in every class really. Idk I feel like they haven’t talked as much about it in my case which is surprising since I’m in a healthcare related major

Idk I just experienced off hand comments about it. But I can imagine that professors may use this excessively to their advantage so students can understand whatever they’re teaching.. honestly sucks though and apologies fo the people who endure a lot of it as assignments and stuff. I barely watch the news since I’m tired of hearing negative stuff and to have that in class frequently, that really sucks guys :/"
exmuslim,fo5try6,t3_g5m0mf,1587535439.0,Fasting in general makes me nauseous and sick but obviously it’s not a chronic medical condition so I’m gonna be looped into it too. I had to drop a class due to mental health reasons lol man this upcoming month is gonna have the worst effect on my mental health
depressed,fo3kv2h,t3_g57f7n,1587488596.0,"I’m sorry you had to go through that OP. To be honest, I think my depression or just feeling sad more often than not started around your age or even earlier. I would tell my mother and she’d be dismissive same thing with my father.

Until a major life even happened (not a death but something that hurt my father) and he was consistently in a bad/depressed mood and turns out he himself had depression and well after a few years he’s still on medication.

To be honest, I don’t   forgive my parents for acting that way. They usually invalidate me on more than one occasion. Nowadays, the seem to understand after what my dad went through. However, forgiveness etc isn’t the point I’m trying to make.

I guess what I’m trying to explain is that some people will be pretty ignorant unless happens it to them. Furthermore, in general, I feel like adults are quick to be dismissive or maybe certain adults like yours and mine. It’s obvious that for awhile they devalued my opinion since I’m younger than them.

I learned to keep my mouth shut because obviously they were prone to consistently keep saying dismissive things to me and that hurt even worse. Now I’m afraid to even tell my health professional wondering if she’ll believe me. I know it’s difficult and family support is always needed but at the same time, try to rely on trusted sources or vent on here! Its better than dealing with dismissive individuals which really messed up my perception on things tbh"
Breath_of_the_Wild,fo2nobz,t3_g4v6d3,1587468994.0,"Bro I bought the expansions without even fully aware of the reviews of the game lol and I never have played a Zelda game before either. But it’s well worth it. I gotta admit I was kinda confused most of the time I guess mainly since I just bought my switch and I wasn’t paying attention to the story line but once I got into it again bc of break and this quarantine, it’s a really great game with so many interesting aspects. And I mean as illustrated on this thread, people are still discussing new stuff they find out from the game and idk for me just all the aspects of the game besides the main story line make it really enjoyable and you can really immerse yourself into it. Probably the first time in awhile that I’ve really been overly excited for a game lol

And eventually when I got the hang of my switch in general lol, the game itself does guide you in a lot of ways so it’s not too difficult to figure out the basics. That’s just my opinion though"
orangecounty,fo2887x,t3_g54f85,1587452890.0,"$1.99 damn I’m from the Midwest and that area in general is cheaper and these are the same prices I would see around 10 years ago in my area lmaoo.
Insane never thought I’d see these kinda prices ever again lol"
AsianParentStories,fnxcnn1,t3_g449kw,1587335953.0,"To be honest this is me me ALL ME. My friends and even an ex who are ASIAN are always like “well I have a good relationship with my mom etc” “I have this/we always hangout/ she listens to me” I cannot help but be bitter. And I honestly HATE how I get that way but it’s true and I’ll admit it. It’s so sad to see that and tbh I just get reminded of how crap my mom acts sometimes. And how I plan to keep my distance in the future. It just sucks that I will never be able to relate to these people. It sucks that even relaying my problems doesn’t even garner any understanding.

It just sucks. I don’t wanna be upset and bitter over something that trivial but it sucks when you’re constantly reminded how you’ll never have a good relationship with anyone in your family because how horrible they are"
CollegeRant,fnx9t89,t1_fnx9kcq,1587334322.0,"I gotta be honest I’m not sure what you’re talking about in relation to community college? (EDIT: scratch that I get whatcha mean lmfao my bad)

But I’ve just known being at my university specifically they make it harder on purpose so people have less opportunities to cheat. There have been a lot of instances of cheating 

And even at a community college if the professor gave me a take home similar measures were implemented tbh. Still had hard professors at a community college too. It just depends really some are more lenient some aren’t I don’t think it’s dependent on what college tbh. And I guess dependent on what the circumstances are"
CollegeRant,fnuwark,t1_fnuvsz4,1587272821.0,"Tbh my high school and even before I transferred to my university I was able to choose my partner or groups idk why that was the case but we always did equal work with no issue and I think there was only one instance where a group member didn’t do work. So this whole case is new to me tbh. And acting like everyone’s mom and asking alone just make me feel kinda guilty lol. 

Definitely not trying to push my ideas on anyone but it’s definitely frustrating to get nothing on everyone else’s end. But yeah you’re right it’s probably normal and pretty much super normal considering how my friends have similar situations lol"
CollegeRant,fnusgrt,t3_g40zdb,1587269896.0,Don’t be sorry for ranting man it’s ok. And I feel this. I may bomb my exams just because literally all of my professors are probably gonna make them extremely hard and short answer so believe me I don’t have much confidence either. I’m sorry this is all happening to you and I’m equally sorry that I can’t do anything but offer up my words in a mere comment. Hang in there man. I feel you really
CollegeRant,fnu3toe,t1_fnu3hp0,1587253995.0,Thank you. This honestly made me feel a bit better about my actions. All these tiny things honestly give me a bad feeling about how this is gonna go especially since this project is worth a big part of our grade
CollegeRant,fnu0uhi,t1_fntz4jt,1587252353.0,"That’s seriously some bullshit and I’m sorry that you had to deal with that. I don’t know if she’ll even be understanding she seemed nice but who knows.

Unfortunately I’m on the quarter system so this hell is gonna continue for me until June! Big yikes"
CollegeRant,fntkdnl,t1_fntj6w5,1587243411.0,"Honestly idk I’ve been scared to email but I did it anyways and explained how I’m worried since the only points we have lie in a big project and exams... like these are the only “Easy” points someone can get here. Who knows how well I’ll do with the exams... in her class they’re all short answer essays. And that’s all subjective too. I just hope she takes my email seriously idk what else to do. Cause even if I get a perfect score.. with the quizzes, like I said it’ll lower me probably by a letter grade even if SOMEHOW I did well on exams.

Furthermore I’ve seen other professors not help much at my school when it came to students who are suffering mental health wise due to all this but I took a chance and emailed her. Idk it seems ridiculous to get this worked up over 5 points but considering how we may not have any grades other than big projects and exams... I feel like I’m entitled to freak out"
CollegeRant,fnrq6q4,t1_fnrpu0g,1587197455.0,"It sucks cause she literally only opens the quiz Friday which is a day I work. Somehow we were busy today, I work at a place that’s essential but business is slowing a bit. Luckily i am glad it was super busy but one professor keeps assigning things almost every day so naturally I focused on getting that done. I literally do my best to work ahead and just because of all this piled on shit AND goddam  job which I have to work I forgot.

I’m sorry that you’re in a similar situation man like honestly I just I wanna say something as someone suggested since the only other grades in my class is a project and exams but who know what I’ll be told.

I hope things get better for you man. Bio is tough honestly not easy at all but I hope it all works out man. I sincerely mean it"
CollegeRant,fnroway,t1_fnroqfv,1587196150.0,"I have been considering it but idk it’s like 5 points so I don’t know if she’ll just look at the email and give me a semi harsh reply lol. It’s week 3 for me and the second week of having the quiz so forgetting makes sense since it’s early on but I just expect the whole”I’d have to do the same thing for everyone else since it wouldn’t be fair” statement as well.... ugh it’s like I either gotta face possible invalidation and embarrassment or just deal with a 0

EDIT: looked at the late policy as well and it looks like it would have to be an emergency excuse if I missed something so she’s bound to cite that as well but thank you for the reply. I honestly just came on here to complain since it seemed like a dead end lol"
DecidingToBeBetter,fnk6od8,t3_g1xlm5,1587016590.0,"Honestly the internet can be pretty toxic in general. Not only on reddit but in general people think since they’re behind a screen they can say whatever they want. Bottom line, it’s disturbing. It really is. And in general it is difficult to not take it personally even though the circumstance may be that person using personal insults is out of insecurity.

I remember being on tumblr years ago and people were so quick to be extremely rude and cruel. I was only a kid back then too so it was pretty awful to deal with

Anyhow I applaud your decision. Your mental health is much more important"
botw,fna3h9w,t1_fn9cp3x,1586790304.0,Makes sense tbh I was just taking into factor what’s going on now ie isolation and stuff it could delay either way. I’m patient haha I got nothing going on so I don’t mind waiting
botw,fn98xky,t3_g0bpz6,1586763663.0,"Tbh I bought the botw and the DLC before even really knowing what the game was like. And my dumbass has barely any experience w gaming but I gotta say the money spent on DLC is truly worth it considering how extensive it is. For me at least. Also as someone said, with all the stuff going on a sequel will probably take awhile"

self,fn2a235,t3_fyozmn,1586582171.0,"I’ve been talking about this same thing for weeks now and honestly you detailed it out perfectly. It’s so annoying. I completely understand the concept of wanting to spread positivity but exactly your points! It’s so easy for them to preach positivity when they don’t have to worry about possibly getting fired or if they got fired, how they’ll provide for themselves or family. Lmfao it is so evident that they are in this bubble  and are completely unaware. 

I totally don’t want to be cynical but damn it sure is tiring to see that bullshit CONSTANTLY spewed on tv. I don’t even watch tv anymore because I’m exhausted with seeing the stupid celebrity “I’m with you” commercials lmfao"
depression,fn28pjq,t3_fyptoo,1586581017.0,This has been me lately. Idk being in a constant rotation of essential worker part time and member of a toxic family the other half of my time makes life miserable. I can’t even talk to people tbh. I can’t manage to have a conversation at all
college,fn1ut4r,t3_fyl0ih,1586570622.0,This is BEYOND wildly inappropriate and childish and complete disregard of the anonymity of class reviews. I saw a similar circumstance with a TA recidivist poor reviews at UCLA. Jesus Christ people I mean what does it take to preserve professionalism..
AsianParentStories,fn0wxw0,t3_fyi5wc,1586550360.0,"I'm really sorry OP. My grandparents are similar in the way that they want to embarrass me lol. I remember as a kid my cousins were visiting from Dubai and they showed obvious favoritism towards them even taking my things and giving it to them. I don't really care tbh cause it's just stupid items but I mean just to show as an example they didn't respect me or my feelings at all. Furthermore, my so-called ""uncle"" (aunt's husband) made up stuff to get me into trouble...clearly lied to get me into trouble lol imagine doing that as an adult to a child.. pretty pathetic. Anyhow, that got me into trouble with grandparents too lol.

Honestly, the best thing you can do is try your best to not engage. In my family, I slowly realized that people really don't give a damn when it comes to what they say or do.

As a result, when my parents decided to move to California (Another side of the country from my hometown where my grandparents are), I leaped at the opportunity. My parents aren't stellar but not dealing with constant ridicule from grandparents is a consolation prize I'll take lol.

I know it's horrible but I don't bother calling them unless I'm forced to lol. I don't wish bad upon anyone but I really do not want my extended family in my life. They have caused enough damage.

So hopefully OP hang in there cause I knew if I said anything or left i'd be in huge trouble and that's not worth the mental Olympics I go through and you probably go through as well. And the day will come where you don't have to deal with anyone's bullshit"
