Edit: Greek life isn’t really that big here so you wouldn’t need to join a sorority to be socially involved"
UCSantaBarbara,foxapv8,t3_ga0zue,1588138463.0,Yes!
UCSantaBarbara,for8op1,t1_fopz8lt,1588008065.0,Omg I got blocked by her for calling her out
UCSantaBarbara,fmdw2xf,t3_fumtc3,1585979852.0,She’s saying people should be criticized for endangering the health of many by going out and not quarantining?
