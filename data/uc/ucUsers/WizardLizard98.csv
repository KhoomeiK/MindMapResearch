ucr,fo5srm5,t3_g5mmvt,1587534527.0,I know there are a lot of shitty advisors at ucr but I just want to mention Sara Cuny from CHASS is an angel!!! She literally called me personally to remind me to apply for early graduation and always helped me with all of my worries and concerns. I'm sorry you've experienced the opposite though :(
kardashians,fnyh62i,t3_g49dt4,1587362958.0,"It's so easy to notice that Larsa is only after attention and is basically trying to just be friends with the Kardashians for more fame. I was watching her in season 17 (I think?) and I wanted to cringe from how she behaves. There was a big scene where she really wanted to go to some guys mansion and party meanwhile her, Kourtney, and other girls are on a trip for Kourts birthday and it was CLEAR that the other girls were not too into idea but Larsa was just pushing it. Idk she seems like a try hard."
