UCSD,fpdk1uj,t3_gcghg8,1588528521.0,"Yea a lot of people on here say ""just join a club or frat, the school is what you make of it"", but the difference is at other schools like Berkeley and UCLA you don't even need a club or frat to make friends. Its significantly harder at UCSD to make friends for introverts. Clubs and greek life isnt for everyone but people may still wanna make friends."
UCSD,foiev9e,t3_g7lxcs,1587785024.0,Is dropping the class an option?
UCSD,fo5zlnv,t1_fo5s2cl,1587541036.0,"Wait somethings not making sense here. Why would we be in another lockdown in winter, if things are going back to normal after summer?"
UCSD,fmz93qg,t3_fy7hnu,1586511271.0,"What class was this for? Also is the meeting going to be on zoom? For advice I would just tell them the truth, unless you really think you have a case and can prove that you didn't cheat. Try to appeal the potential quarter suspension though."
UCSD,fmhd3yo,t3_fva7jz,1586075245.0,I dont understand. Why wouldnt u be able to dress like this?
