DestroyAllHumans,fpf867f,t1_fpf6luf,1588564126.0,"Yeah I see what you mean lol this game is basically the pilot episode of the series, it may not have all the shebang as 2 but I enjoyed the whole invasion theme and the way the story carried it out. We have different views on it yes but I feel either game has it's perks, at the end of the day we'll see the remake touch upon where the original didn't"

ucr,fpb9yk7,t3_gcfxvs,1588465288.0,"I took Spanish, but I assume the procedure goes on the same way. You get an email from whoever is proctoring the test, they give you a zoom link for the time you're scheduled to take the test. The proctor gives you info on the testing website and how to sign in etc, and with my experience, I had to stay in the zoom meeting to make sure we weren't cheating. The questions are based on how you answer them, so it adapts to your skill level in the language. Upon completion, you're met with a results page that also shows you what level of the foreign language you placed into. In the case you have a high score, the proctor will want you to do a follow-up interview as a failsafe so they know you weren't cheating. Eventually they email you letting you know the status of your placement. With me, I tested out and they told me it would end up on my degree audit that week. Good luck!"

However, if cash isn't much of an issue here (not sure how Xbox goes about dah1 and 2) then I'd still recommend them, they're great games. I enjoy the first mainly for it's story, and the sequel gives you more of a sense of exploration and power that wasn't there in the previous game with the additional new  maps, weapons, and abilities. Another bonus is they'll hold you over until late July lol"

I walk into the stall only to be bitch smacked in the face by the foul odor of shit and to see that this fucking kid smeared his shit all over the toilet seat.

I do see your point, like that one section of the final map before the last boss fight how there's one tyrant, you take him down and 2 more spawn in and you've got all kinds of demons on you, its a pain in the ass lol

DestroyAllHumans,fodc94y,t1_focjq5h,1587682868.0,"Funny that you mention the ion detonator, on the Cacodemon, there's a weak spot hit where you launch an explosive into its mouth, it swallows it and the explosion makes it falter from the inside, making it stunned for a glory kill. It's something I thought of that would be interesting to see.

Though with the remake giving you a dash ability, I feel like crypto could have a chance against the tyrant, Doom Slayer has a dash ability in Eternal, it pulls you out of situations, literally lol.

In terms of fire power, the saucer might be needed, which made me think of the saucer's quantum deconstructor being up to tier with the Doom's BFG 9000 to have an impact on something as big as the tyrant"
