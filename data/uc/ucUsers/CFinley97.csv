I love  ジャズマスターが鳴った後に . Unfortunately, it appears that they only have a few songs. I found both bands from Soundcloud - both bands had accounts. I like the indie music I find there, but it's hard to tell how popular the bands are. Do you use SoundCloud?"
AskRedditNSFW,fok72dw,t1_foj2po2,1587836602.0,"Can I just chime in and say I've kinda thought of it backwards? 

Gay being used more often as an indication of sexual preference, I've viewed it as an indication that one is sexually interested in men primarily. I come about it this way bc I've caught feelings for a guy before but the sexual stuff felt a bridge far at the time.

Admittedly this is where labels get problematic but wanted to chime in."
japanesemusic,fok5ayu,t3_g7uqu1,1587835673.0,"This is awesome!! There's nothing better than a good opportunity to discover new music. 

I wanted to ask, have you heard Kensei Ogata or ジャズマスターが鳴った後に? 

They seem to be two lesser known artists, but I'd be curious to hear your impression of their popularity and music."
AskReddit,fohjqmx,t1_foglph0,1587767114.0,"That's a really fair point and good larger question of ""where do you draw the line between body and constituent parts?"""
AskReddit,fohan2r,t1_foglmav,1587762794.0,"Thanks for the response! 

That makes it a lot more concrete. Other commenters mentioning nebulae really illuminates the possibilities. I wanted to ask, could you name some things that may ""obscure"" our view? Someone mentioned dark matter but aside from black holes, is there an open scientific question about certain things that may be limiting our view beyond time's limitations on light reaching us?"
AskReddit,fogkhl5,t1_fogj91e,1587753713.0,"Forgive my imperfect understanding - I've just started reading some physics textbooks during all this. 

The thing with singularities is that there's a large amount of matter in a relatively small area, and once we exceed Schwarzschild's specified limits, you get a singularity. 

Could it be possible that there are larger things than the largest we've observed but their dispersion is enough that it's not so dense to cause a singularity?"
steinsgate,fofe31c,t1_foely5w,1587733790.0,"I like to think so! At minimum, Mayuri and Suzuha are saved in the zero timeline while in the Steins;Gate timeline, they all get to live their happily ever after. 

Of course, if you wanna see what happens, you gotta watch the OVA and the movie :)))"
steinsgate,foekqwm,t1_foejeof,1587706393.0,"So I'm less than 100% clear on this, but I was poking around and found this excerpt from [this article](https://www.thecinemaholic.com/steins-gate-ending/):

>Okabe’s time machine continues to work, and he successfully takes Suzuha and Mayuri to 2036 to the Steins;Gate timeline. This is the same timeline where Okabe arrived at the end of the original Steins;Gate series.

Editing to elaborate:

So there's prob a lot better explanations on this sub and I'd recommend just starting there, but what I recall is there's essentially two ""real"" existing worldlines at the end of all this. 

Okabe from zero goes and recovers Mayuri and Suzuha, and takes them back to their future in the zero wordline, which needs to exist for the Steins;Gate line to reach its desired course (Okabe couldn't have the video message if it weren't for that). 

What happens beyond that is open to interpretation. Does he find a way to work around his need to leave that worldline? Does he go off and explore something else on his own? Does he necessarily bring Mayuri and Suzuha back? 

It's open-ended, at least from the anime ending. And I'll spoil that the movie doesn't address jt. 

So what do you think? (:

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
steinsgate,foeiyc3,t1_fo8ydv2,1587704991.0,"Sorry I haven't responded. I highly recommend the OVA, then the movie. 

Admittedly both are pretty fluffy - if you're looking for more of the intense sci-fi it's less present. But Iove watching them after a watch through of S;G or S;G 0."

steinsgate,fo80f9b,t3_g67i3e,1587587692.0,"Obvious spoilers below, not tagging bc the whole discussion is a spoiler  


IIRC  


1.) Okabe only ""hops"" worldlines when his consciousness alone is moved (e.g. the Phone Wave name TBA). In the final episode, they're using the time machine, which in the Steins;Gate universe, allows two people to occupy the same space and time at once because technically the ""duplicate"" person is just moving to a different time in the same worldline. The other thing worth noting is there's essentially two verging on three primary world lines in Steins;Gate: the Steins;Gate line, where the OG cast originally finished, the Alpha, where either Kurisu or Mayuri have to die (which is turned eventually into the Steins;Gate path), and the Zero worldline, which sits separately.   


&#x200B;

So you have the original Okabe of that point in time, then the one from Zero who has used the time machine.   


&#x200B;

2.) This one I'm fuzzier on, and there's other posts that explain better so I'd encourage you to poke around, but here's my best. Since the Okabe in that future is believed to have died (or let's say ""left"") in 2025, he can't stick around forever without causing a paradox of some variety. Simultaneously, you have the issue of Mayuri and Suzuha who are essentially teleported back to somewhere in ancient time, without any means of returning home. Okabe looks to kill two birds with one stone by going off and saving Mayuri and Suzuha. If he fails, he's already supposed to die, but if he succeeds, he can meet with them and potentially return them to their future on the Zero worldline. 

&#x200B;

The series is open-ended on what happens, but my understanding goes that he could have returned them to the time they came from in the Zero worldline, but he may have had to permanently left at somepoint thereafter.

It was so nice to have the gang back but with new adventures. I found myself back in all the same feels as before."
