Buffett in various interviews has recommended BRK.B to those in your position. The number of people who own less than 3 shares of BRK.A must be less than 100. Bc it makes no sense. Whereas there are near 100,000 owners of BRK.A who are millionaires.

Obv don't forget to turn off the lights bc the env is super important :)"
borrow,foedgec,t1_fodu0ok,1587701150.0,"Ok, I disagree with your definition of constant communication. On the day you contacted me, the due date, I responded, asking if I could pay you in one week on the 15th. You agreed.

One week later you sent me two messages: at 8:51 AM, PST, stating ""payment is due today"" and at 4:03 PM, PST, stating ""hi, still haven't heard from you.""

The following day I sent you the message: ""Sent the money to you. Used my bank, so may take couple days.. saves me 5 bucks. Hope that’s cool."" To which you responded: ""alrighty, thanks, i'll make the paid post once the check clears.""

This to any person - with any command of the English language whatsoever demonstrates acknowledgment and acceptance of my request. You could have said that you wanted the money immediately, and you'd have had it. I asked if it was ""cool"" with you and you said it was.

Similarly, you could have had the money on the 8th as was originally scheduled, but I asked for an extension. The exchange was as follows: ""Oh hi, I get paid later this week.. could I pay you on the 15th? Open to negotiate any additional compensation. Thanks."" Your response was: ""okay, I'll reach out to you next week!.""

This is what any person would consider ""constant communication."" This is why it was unreasonable for you to mark my payment ""Late."" When a borrower requests an extension, the lender has multiple options.

1. Decline, and demand payment right away - any payment not on that day is ""Late""
2. Grant the extension, but notify the borrower that the payment is ""Late"" (possibly request additional compensation)
3. Say  ""okay, I'll reach out to you next week!.""

While the third choice may seem facetious. It's quite impossible for someone to interpret such a response as anything but an ""extension with agreement."" If a third party would comment I'm certain their opinion would be exactly the same.

Obviously I was unaware that it is not common practice on this board to list just the amount lent. (not the amount returned with interest.)

Pretty sure I've just described how you acted unscrupulously. To be completely honest, I've borrowed and loaned out lots of money on different platforms and never has anyone acted in such a bizarre and irrational manner. You had many options when I requested a week extension, however, you voluntarily granted it. It's not possible to interpret that as anything but an extension.

What is unethical is not marking the payment as 140. It's being super creepy and skeevy and marking my payment ""late"" when no sane person could ever look at the convo and think that. Honestly, I thought you were a good person until today."
borrow,fodor5j,t1_fod5jxg,1587687305.0,"Considering that there was constant communication most people would not consider it such. However, the discussion I had with her/him was not that the “Late” status be changed. Rather, that the statement I responded 2 days late be corrected (spoiler alert: he/she didn’t) - I responded one day late. Secondly, I asked for the implication that I made her/him wait for the e-check - when in fact it was agreed that there would be no problem waiting. (If they wanted it immediately, sending it by credit card would have been fine)

Edit: I’d like to clarify again, because this lender is full of bs. I sent her/him a msg twice that I’d report her. Which I of course will. My only interest is making sure other ppl’s money is safe."
borrow,focvi70,t3_g6nunx,1587676433.0,"Edit: definitely would not borrow from again

Would not recommend this lender. After agreeing to a later date to repay her, in which she would receive the money on the 23rd. She immediately agrees. However, once she received the money she immediately began inventing a scenario in which my timely repayment would look otherwise.  The facts: I asked for a week extension, a day after that due date, I sent her an email - asking her whether it would be okay to use my bank which may take (up to 5 business days) longer. She agreed. Exactly 5 business days later she received the money. She is now claiming that I made this payment late. 

Further, she is claiming that she did not agree to my method of payment via bank. This is categorically false. I have the chat to verify this. 

I then did not threaten, but warned her that if she “is not truthful” I will report her. It would really be a disgusting thing for me to do, as a human being, to let someone who is so consistently lying  - continue as such without my personal comment. 

It’s your money and there are many other lenders."

Was obviously stating that the hospitals said THE VENTILATORS TESLA SENT were crucial, before they knew what type of ventilators Tesla sent. They are now not being used. 

Wow thanks for the medium article /s. The article does not do what you described. It doesn’t show the hospitals asking for BiPAP machines. All it does is thank Elon while utilizing all the literary skills of a 12 year old. It’s an opinion piece which has no facts. 

At no point did I say that BiPAP machines could not be modified and used for COVID. However, I said that none of the hospitals have the resources to do so. 

  • show me the email from the hospitals. 

  • Irrelevant, if the hospitals cannot use them. 

  • The hospitals do not have the resources and will not convert them. As I showed you in the prior email they are being used for people with “difficulty breathing” such as sleep apnea. Not those on invasive life supporting machines for COVID. 


He did send ventilators to hospitals that are being used to treat COVID patients. However, those ventilators are not being used to treat the patients they just happen to be in the same building as invasive ventilators which are saving lives.

I’m not bashing Tesla or Elon. They didn’t need to send anything. They did send thousands of n95 masks to hospitals in California. I’m just saying the vast majority of these ventilators, if not all, will not be used for COVID. 

I’m a huge fan of what Tesla and Elon does."
