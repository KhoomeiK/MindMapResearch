ucr,fp874fc,t3_gbrdqu,1588385209.0,I transferred from rcc with a 3.2 into bio. But if youre really worried about it then contact the ucr transfer advisor and let them know whats going on right now. Either ask if you can take it over summer or when you get to ucr. Everyone is struggling rn. Theres no need to feel bad rn.

ucr,fooq4xx,t3_g8a289,1587944103.0,"I have a good schedule. Im keeping up with my work. But i just dont feel like im retaining anything. Im not in the headspace. I was on the deans list last quarter as a bio major and now i can barely sit still through an hour lecture. Im worried about my family, im worried about my friends and school is just something that im moving through the motions with out of habit but it doesnt feel right rn. Your feelings are absolu valid"
ucr,focaxt5,t3_g6ljnu,1587669173.0,And for the love of god avoid the 91 at any time of daylight bc theres going to be traffic through corona both directions no matter what. That place is a black hole.
ucr,focabvb,t3_g6ry7n,1587668968.0,.. you can unmute yourself...
ucr,fmx2pdj,t3_fxaynd,1586457402.0,The friends that i have that have taken it say that its fine especially if its the only thing youre taking bc then thats the only think you have in your brain. And they said the grade scale was huge bc the pace was so fast. And a huge plus this summer is that its online whoch means you never actually have to GO to an o chem lab which FUCKING SUCK.  Ive already taken 8a and will be finishing the series over summer.
ucr,fmwzuex,t3_fxwdjg,1586455949.0,"There are a lot of variables here. 

Im a bio major who transferred to UCR from RCC ( the community college here). While i was at community i was working 1-2 jobs( anywhere from 8-35 hours a week, ive done it all üò©)and going to school full time (12-16 units, kill me) and im a BIO MAJOR. I had to work to pay my bills bc i wasnt getting finaid at the time bc my parents hadnt done their taxes for like 3 years. My parents finally got their shit together right as i was transferring to UCR luckily but I knew i wouldnt have been able to work and go to school now. Especially transitioning to the quarter system. I was so burnt out. I was ready to pull out personal loans to pay for school if i couldnt get my financial aid worked. 

My grades suffered working and going to school, my mental health suffered bc of stress and lack if sleep( i had to start going to therapy), i never had time for my friends, family, or myself, and i was working my ASS OFF and still BARELY making ends meet. Occasionally still asking my friends to spot me so my phone bill wouldnt get shut off or for some gas to get to work (keep the good friends close, youll know theyre good when they offer you these things without you asking)

I wouldnt work unless you had too. If youre not going to get enough fin aid to pay for your dorm you can always look at personal loans, especially if you only plan on staying in the dorms one year (note: i never stayed in the dorms so idk what all the hubbub is about. Sounds sticky and uncomfortable to me) 

But here are some thing to consider bc ultimately you have to decide whats best for you:

‚Ä¢Parking is going to suck whether you live on campus or commute so youre just going to have to live with that. 

‚Ä¢How far is your commute? Is it worth the traffic and the drive and fight for parking? 
( btw i commute and if you get there before 9am you can find parking pretty much anywhere, after that youre screwed)

‚Ä¢you can make friends regardless by attending clubs and chatting with people around in lecture. You dont need the dorms for that. (When I transferred i didnt know anyone and started attending club meetings and already had great friends a few weeks in that i still talk to and hang out with outside of school) 

‚Ä¢school is going to be exhausting and hard on its own and adding 25+ hours a week is ALOT so can you take that on? Have you worked a job before? Can you mentally and physically take that on? ( i hope youre stronger than me)

‚Ä¢are the dorm perks worth your tolls? Proximity to campus, friends,etc. 
(There are many days i wish i didnt have to commute bc it the traffic is so bad and after a 12 hour day i still have to drive my sorry ass home) 

‚Ä¢dont forget about food. Its super expensive on campus as well but it convenient and salty so its going to be hard to resist 


        This is just my experience and yours could be different. I worked and went to school for 3 & 1/2 years bc i HAD TO. The moment i didnt have to i dipped. Im happier. I havent had an anxiety attack in months. Im not depressed anymore. I sleep better and my my grades have shot through the roof!

Everyones fin aid is different, everyones home life is different, everyones values are different. I hope this helps you work through a few of the different variables. Sorry it was so long winded and congrats on your acceptance!"
ucr,fkvm68n,t3_fkxiet,1584572055.0,"I agree. Im finding it so hard to study with every thing going on right now. Were literally in a dystopian future. Ive done very well this quarter as a CNAS bio major, As and Bs on everything even in ochem but as im approaching my last 2 online, open note finals i cannot for the life of me focus. And i know that these finals are going to be harder than they would have been otherwise bc theyre open note with no way to proctor them. 

But havent i proven myself. I feel like these finals are going to bring my grades down a lot. Wish they were optional for people who needed grade boosts like one of my other professors did. Ive worked my ass off this quarter. Wish I could get some slack

Oh well this is just me complaining to feel better. No real grief theyre just doing their job i guess"
