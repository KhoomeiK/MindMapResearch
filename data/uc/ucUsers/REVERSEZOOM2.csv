# What's up with Reddit being such doomers

Like many, I have been keeping up with news on the coronavirus, which for the sake of my mental health I should probably not be doing. However, I noticed a huge trend when it comes to what makes it to the top page and what goes down in the comments. Redditors just seem to circlejerk around the worst-case scenario and make the most alarmist news hit the frontpage. It's like everyone here as a disaster fetish or something. I know the situation is dire and I am not trying to downplay that, but why is it that the common sentiment is that we are all gonna die, and that this ""will infect 70 percent of the world population"", ""The world is gonna end blah blah"". Genuinely curious.

A follow-up question since I'm a bit curious. Do we know about any of the long term effects of the virus in very mild cases, as in the person had a bad 3 days but got better or was pretty much asymptomatic? is there any clues that we can go off of?"
