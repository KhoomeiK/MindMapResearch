To me, it sounds like what you really need is a break. Just take a step back from this unhealthy cycle and do some things that you like to do - talk to family/friends, eat some nice food, watch your favorite movie, read a good book, whatever you're longing for. 

Once that is done, focus on constructing a good routine - sleeping/waking up at a good hour, eating well, exercising.

Then, re-evaluate what your number one goal is. Now create a realistic plan to achieve it. Then go ahead and try to execute that plan, modifying along the way."

But 162, 127, 16b sounds like a lot. If you're planning to do theory ML stuff, 16b/140 and 127 are important classes so I would do them properly."
berkeley,fmkqdt5,t1_fmjm1y7,1586164513.0,Also only op amp basics are in scope so I don't think the op amp design questions will be too rough!
berkeley,fmkq4a6,t3_fvusc4,1586164215.0,Good luck!

relationship_advice,fm06q3e,t3_fs0yrn,1585646908.0,"I think it's important to understand your husband's motivations before making any final decisions: why did he think it was better to hide this from you rather than just tell you about it? 

If he dodges the questions, then perhaps that's not a good sign. If he is upfront, honest and remorseful, then that's a good sign for trust to be rebuilt. Did he think he was doing something wrong? If not, why? This conversation needs to be had with a calm and rational mind without emotional upheaval. 

Secondly, I don't think that checking his phone behind his back, forcing him to call her so that you can listen in etc. are good things to do. This is a sign that you don't trust his word and that's already a sign of a problem. No relationship problems get resolved by snooping, ultimatums etc. in my opinion. 

Good luck!"
