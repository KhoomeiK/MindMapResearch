ecuador,fok7efd,t1_fojsl3f,1587836782.0,"People didn’t want to listen. That’s why the government had to increase the limitations until they reached a pretty early curfew and limited what cars can be out and driving. The government did mess up, but nothing like how other governments did. I’m not saying the government doesn’t deserve blame; they do. But also, people need to listen and follow new guidelines. I have lots of family and friends over there, who tell me directly how things have been. Can’t blame it all on the government!"

If people had a shred of will to become informed, it’s quite easy to do so nowadays. 

But yes, perhaps willful ignorance is by design."

ucr,fngedp7,t3_g1k6jz,1586929673.0,For any pre-meds out there: a lot of schools have announced they will accept pass/fail grades for classes taken during the pandemic. Take advantage of that if your dream schools are offering that!!
unpopularopinion,fnge6tp,t3_g1itcg,1586929511.0,"There’s this guy I know from college who became a doctor. 

He went to work for a medical mission, and it looked like he got some modeling job at the 3rd world country where he went from all the pics he posted. 

Now, I give it to him, he volunteered to help out in NY when he didn’t *have to*. He however did by announcing to the world thru Facebook with an “emotionally packed” post. And of course he got hundreds of people telling him how amazing he is, etc... 

In my eyes it would have been way more meaningful if he did the things he likes to do without whoring for attention. It’s tacky."

She has a son who lives in the same city, and he won’t give two shits about doing something like this for her. I know it’d mean the world to her. 

Thanks for being a decent human being ❤️"

StackAdvice,fn7egm5,t1_fn77kj8,1586718712.0,"Not OP but I am on Lexapro. I’m on 10mg though, however, I’m also very sensitive to substances. 

I’ve been on it for 2 months, and I’ve definitely noticed my libido is basically completely gone, and I take forever to orgasm, if I do orgasm. I’m a female btw. I’ve been having lower libido for some years now, but this has taken the little bit I had left away. In terms of orgasms, this is new to me. Even without being horny per se, if I’ve felt like masturbating, or if I’ve had a playmate, I had never in my life struggled to orgasm. It even feels like the area around my clit is “numb” when trying to pleasure myself, though the area isn’t actually numb. It just doesn’t respond to stimulation as it used to. 

I also get the emotional blunting, both towards positive and negative emotions. A month ago exactly I spent a night with someone that in the past would have gotten me all sorts of excited. Last month while I was happy to be there, it just felt like my emotions hit a wall and I couldn’t get past the just general enjoyment of the company I had, but there was no actual excitement or positive feelings I would have normally gotten. However this has come helpful given the ‘rona times and what I’m personally going through with my school having me do clinical rotations, where I’m likely being exposed to ‘rona. I can be a high anxiety person, I’m a bit hypochondriac as well, so I feel like if I wasn’t on the Lexapro, I’d be having a lot more stress. 

Do I consider myself to be a stoic now? Not quite. I’m highly aware that my emotions are being modulated by this drug. And to be honest, I can’t wait to be done with it, but that won’t be until the end of this year, or possible sometime next year. 

I just need to be able to go back to my beloved MJ without fear of a random drug test, and then I’ll work on getting off Lexapro."

It was believed they were safe [“Mr. Modly, the acting Navy secretary, defended the ship’s decision to have made a port call in Da Nang, Vietnam, despite the spread of the virus across Asia. He said that, at the time, coronavirus cases in Vietnam numbered fewer than 100 and were in the north of the country, around Hanoi.

Drinking water wasn't the best idea either lol... so I know what you mean OP, I know what you mean."
