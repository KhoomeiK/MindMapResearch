WTF,fowxmmf,t3_g9t6hf,1588129364.0,"July 2018 — A retaining wall gave away causing a landslide and leaving a building hanging on a cliff before it finally collapsed in Istanbul, Turkey’s Beyoglu district.

According to authorities, the collapse of the wall was a result of poor engineering and heavy rainfall. Police and fire department of Istanbul immediately evacuated the hazardous four-store building that lied on the top of the landslide along with 2 adjacent residential constructions.

The building finally collapsed after several hours while television crews broadcast live the dramatic incident. A large area was influenced as debris was spread.

Ahmet Misbah Demircan, Mayor of Beyoglu, told media that the building was constructed illegally in 1994. It did not have an occupancy permit or a construction license while problems with its foundation were reported. To this day, it is not clear why authorities did not address the issue.

Ryan has, I think, a good idea, but not the details to make it fair or passable.  The 2017 average household income of the top 5% of earners in the U.S. was $376,587, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 American Community Survey.

In a household with a married couple and two children over the minimum age (16?), that would be $96K per year.  The idea makes sense to me in theory, but not the details.

Not that Trump and his administration and Fox News and others didn't drop the ball. They did. But here's my unpopular opinion:  The World Health Organization did, too, and big time. WHO declared COVID-19 a ""Health Emergency of International Concern"" on January 30th.  They should have called it a pandemic then.  On that date, the disease had been identified in 19 countries with human-to-human transmission in four.  There were about 20,000 known cases.  One of WHO's descriptions of a pandemic was: ""The pandemic will be declared when the new virus sub-type has been shown to cause several outbreaks in at least one country, and to have spread to other countries, with consistent disease patterns indicating that serious morbidity and mortality is likely in at least one segment of the population."" WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic six weeks later on March 11th when there were more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries, and 4,291 deaths.

Following WHO's declaration of pandemic, President Trump addressed the nation from the Oval Office that same night and his (and Fox News') framing of the issue pivoted.

Had WHO made the declaration earlier, then at least some governments, media, and individuals would have recognized the gravity of the issue sooner.  Under their own guidelines, WHO could have done so, but they did not.  I believe that hesitance had negative consequences.  This does not absolve those who minimized a ""Health Emergency of International Concern"" -- that, too, is serious -- but ""pandemic"" forces the issue into sharper focus and makes it harder for anyone to dismiss the unfolding public health crisis."
