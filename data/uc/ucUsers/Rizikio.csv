That being said, I've found it to be a lot easier to get good grades in those courses without any curve.

I wouldn't worry too much. The reputation of Cal's grade deflation really comes from STEM courses. For most professors, if you produce A quality work you should get good grades."
berkeley,fphy6mq,t3_gd5ee7,1588629998.0,"Hmm... It really depends on the major. Some majors like CS curve heavily, especially in the upper division courses – to the effect that you don't even really need to do well on the exam, you just need to be better than 1SD of people. Other majors like Chem have classes where they don't curve at all even if half the class is failing.

What major are you intending?"
berkeley,fphxmrl,t3_gdjaee,1588629700.0,"All three of the people in my room put co-ed as their preferred option, and we still were put in a single gendered floor. In fact, on my floor, I was not aware of a single person who indicated a preference for a single gender floor.

The environment was fine, honestly only a little less social than other floors since most of us went to hang out elsewhere. You spend most of the time hanging out in rooms and common rooms anyway, so its more about the friends you make. I had a good group of guys on my floor I hung out with, and spent the rest of my time with friends on other floors.

Berkeley housing is a shitshow, and if you're lucky you will get your last pick. Otherwise it is out of your hands. Although Stern is an unlikely outcome – by sheer capacity, you're most likely going to get stuck in a triple in one of the units. 

If you're lucky not too many kids will return to campus next fall for coronavirus so you might get your picks."
QuantumComputing,fp58ukf,t1_fp58g45,1588320369.0,This is just a fundamental flaw of Google's organizational structure. Wouldn't be too surprised if the entire QC division is inexplicably defunded and shut down within 5 years.
QuantumComputing,fp502zw,t3_gb4jnz,1588312121.0,"This echoes what I heard from friends internally. Sounds like there was a definite split as he believed he knew best, and others disagreed. Seems both sides are happier now."
berkeley,fokp2xx,t3_g7zuc2,1587846246.0,"Anywhere between 3-6, including pass fail courses and decals. As a freshman I'd stick to 4 max for the first semester and if that's too light bump it up.

It's really less about the number of classes and more about how hard they are. Like any class with a lab is usually the workload of 2 classes, similar with the harder techs.

For example, I've had semesters where I only took 4 and it was unbearably tough. On the other hand I had a semester where I took like 7 classes at once but 3 of them were stuff I did in high school but didn't get college credit for so I was able to just show up to the midterms and virtually do nothing else for the course, and that was a relatively light semester."
berkeley,fokmvz8,t3_g7ghw3,1587845052.0,Consider appealing your decision. I have a few friends who were rejected before writing an appeal letter.

berkeley,fmz39pp,t3_fy4bkv,1586504731.0,"cs+math+econ

Surprisingly doable if you just never take fewer than 20 units. I could've finished a year early if I dropped the math major to a minor."
berkeley,fme3c3i,t3_fuih0a,1585987616.0,"I don't think you even need to take either class. If you're confident in your calculus, you can test out of it by passing the final at the end of the semester."
