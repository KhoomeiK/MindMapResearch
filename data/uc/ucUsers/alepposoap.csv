UCSD,fkzaf8g,t1_fkyx7ye,1584666430.0,lol not in mmw but id rather not pay for that shit. its not like youll get a hugely different experience with the non public articles. theres no reason a prof should make students pay extra for something thats not even necessary.  i had the same shit for phil 28 where the prof made us buy a calcopy book that differs from every year. luckily they had copies in the library but thats not even an option now. if u dont mind paying 70 bucks for a shitty book then im not gonna stop u
