berkeley,fmugtju,t3_fwzq9g,1586391131.0,Right now the class has all 80 of its seats reserved for IEOR majors. I’m in the same boat as you but it seems unlikely we’ll be able to take it :(
berkeley,fmj2pcv,t3_fv92tz,1586121829.0,"I’m in UGBA 88 right now and took Data 8 a year ago. Both courses are extremely easy relative to other CS/stat classes as far as I’m aware and are really fun as well imo. Opinions on Stat W21 are very mixed if you look up reviews online and in this sub, but I haven’t taken it so I can’t say for sure."
