REDDITORSINRECOVERY,foyv6i5,t1_foythwn,1588179766.0,"Thanks. Yeah you‚Äôre totally right! We had a really stern conversation about it. I said I do NOT want to date the type of person who does illegal activity with drugs whatsoever. I told him that from my perspective, it seems like he was trying to sabotage his recovery (& our relationship which is based in recovery).

I really just had to set up some new hardcore boundaries and if he doesn‚Äôt respect them well... you know what happens then. But I think he understands how upsetting/dangerous it was now that we‚Äôve talked more. I‚Äôm willing to leave though if it comes down to it! I love sobriety way too much, I‚Äôm so lucky to have it."

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fovrkno,t3_g9u9an,1588106302.0,You can do it üôåüèº
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fovrgkr,t1_fovqnhd,1588106246.0,"Thanks so much. Ultimately I told him I wanted to break up. He was very heart broken. He said he would never do it again, does not want to loose me, I‚Äôm his ‚Äúperson‚Äù. I slept on it. Told him the next day that if he ever did something like that again (works with drugs) I will be gone.

He ‚Äúonly‚Äù sent a Facebook message to one of his old friends but that‚Äôs enough to be a MAJOR red flag. If he wasn‚Äôt so invested in keeping the relationship, I probably would break up with him. 

Anyways thanks for the comment and support. One day at a time. He has 1 year sober and I‚Äôm coming up on two years to in June!!!!"

UCDavis,fmmjw3t,t1_fmmjnko,1586206609.0,Also to clarify... it was a hour and a half YouTube ‚Äúlab‚Äù prelab and post lab we had 24 hours to turn in. The labs were literally posted 24 hours ahead of time along with 3 hours of lecture. It‚Äôs not right :(
UCDavis,fmmjnko,t3_fw3tte,1586206484.0,"For real I have no quiet study space... it is so difficult to attend lectures at preset times when my housemates are chatting around having dinner (they do not chat quietly) and this morning there was construction in my apartment and I had to stay home through it.

I wish professors would be a little more forgiving about deadlines considering we have to figure so much. I had assignments due at midnight on Friday that were quite lengthy. 

I‚Äôve only had one professor who reminds us to keep our health (physical and mental) first - I‚Äôm so grateful for that one. The rest are barreling on as if we all have an at home office in Suburbia."
