UCSD,fpkybuc,t3_gcocw9,1588703152.0,"Hello, I double checked with our student accounts team to confirm this but no, we can't really see anything. The most we can see are the apps you sign into using your UCSD account, but no more specific info. As well, we don't care enough to even look, there's no reason to especially with around 38k students."
UCSD,fopqcm1,t3_g8tmdt,1587968766.0,"For the Zoom issue, one common thing I've seen is accounts that were signed up for using UCSD email addresses but not through UCSD's SSO system. If you aren't already, I would recommend logging into Zoom using ucsd.zoom.us (it may ask about switching accounts the first time, which I recommend) and using UCSD SSO to sign in, as there is potential that will solve the issue."
UCSD,foppzhg,t3_g8uxz8,1587968443.0,"Hmm it appears to be loading for me on two separate accounts. What sort of error is it giving, and is it on all pages? I'd recommend trying an incognito or private window and see if that helps, as that often resolves issues on the client side. Feel free to contact us at servicedesk@ucsd.edu for further assistance as well."
UCSD,foomyz7,t1_foi6pha,1587942219.0,"Hello! Can you please reach out to us at [servicedesk@ucsd.edu](mailto:servicedesk@ucsd.edu)? allthruucsd does not work through the browser version, as the browser version is only intended to be used with EasyConnect and only makes the single tab you are accessing use the VPN. I'd recommend using the downloaded VPN with 2stepsecured-allthruucsd as the group, as this will forward all network traffic through UCSD allowing you to access Kanopy. In my testing, that's solved any Kanopy issues. Info on the VPN can be found in the [Blink VPN documentation](https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/connections/off-campus/VPN/index.html)."
UCSD,foomlty,t3_g885it,1587942007.0,"A bit more serious of a response, but if you are having issues, please let us know at [servicedesk@ucsd.edu](mailto:servicedesk@ucsd.edu) and provide your location, MAC address, and when the issues occur. It really really helps us figure out where the issues are still occurring and what changes still need to be made."
UCSD,fo96qj0,t1_fo961b5,1587611832.0,"Perfect! I'll update once I hear back from the Messaging team with further details. As for the AD password reset question, it depends on a few factors but for students I believe it will let you reuse certain passwords, depending on its strength, however I am not certain on this."
UCSD,fo957fr,t3_g6eusd,1587610812.0,"I assume the password error is occurring on [spam.ucsd.edu](https://spam.ucsd.edu), not the VPN, correct? I tested accessing [spam.ucsd.edu](https://spam.ucsd.edu) while connected to the VPN using both of my AD accounts and had the same issue you were having, so I think something is acting up. I will take a look into why this is, but as a workaround for now you should be able to view your Spam Quarantine by searching for ""proofpoint"" in your inbox, finding the most recent email, and clicking ""Manage My Account"".  This should even work not on the VPN. Apologies for the inconvenience!"
UCSD,fo8yh3u,t3_g6c85o,1587606524.0,"Hello! 

The VPN upgrades were on the backend to handle the exponential increase in number of active users, no changes were made to the Anyconnect Client, which is a Cisco product. UCSD has been using Anyconnect for some time now, and has had very few issues with it. Anyconnect is perfectly safe to install provided you follow the installation instructions, and is used by many other universities and companies (a search for ""university Anyconnect"" can demonstrate this). I've personally installed Anyconnect many times and assisted dozens of people with very few issues ever arising, the majority of which are caused by uninstalling by deleting instead of using the uninstaller. If you have issues with malware or with the Anyconnect installation and usage, feel free to contact us at servicedesk@ucsd.edu or 858-246-4357 for assistance. 

Thanks!"
UCSD,fo25ho1,t3_g58o3b,1587450354.0,"Hello! It sounds like you may be trying to use the browser VPN (vpn.ucsd.edu) which only will connect if you choose 2stepsecured- EasyConnect, as any other group is simply a path to installing the desktop client. I would definitely recommend using the Anyconnect desktop client over the web based Easyconnect, as it's typically less confusing to use. To use allthruucsd, you'll need to open the Cisco Anyconnect Client (which it sounds like you already installed), enter vpn.ucsd.edu into the box, then sign in using 2stepsecured - allthruucsd as the group. More detailed instructions with screenshots can be found in [the VPN documentation on Blink](https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/connections/off-campus/VPN/index.html) for a variety of different devices. If you have any issues or questions, please let us know at servicedesk@ucsd.edu. Thanks!"
UCSD,fnubnve,t3_g3v8nm,1587258612.0,"Yep, you should be able to access them using the UCSD VPN. Here are some instructions from Blink on installation and setup, I'd recommend using the VPN Anyconnect Client method:  [https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/connections/off-campus/VPN/](https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/connections/off-campus/VPN/)

UCSD,fnu9aje,t3_g3xvw6,1587257197.0,"Unfortunately the Service Desk weekend hours are 12PM-3PM, however weekdays we're open from 7AM to 10PM. Since it sounds like a very standard first block, my recommendation is to run an antimalware scan on your computer (using whatever antivirus you have installed, but preferably Malwarebytes), then take a screenshot of the scan results and respond to the ticket with that. If you give us a call tomorrow between 12 and 3 we'll be able unblock the computer and get this settled real quick. Our apologies for the inconvenience."
UCSD,fnpdjao,t1_fnnt94w,1587143613.0,"Thanks for the ping!

While we are able to assist directly with all IT related issues, or at the very least direct it to the correct group, for questions such as Student Mail we defer back to the same information that is available online. As a result, for this sort of issue you will be in contact with the correct group more quickly by contacting Student Mail directly, as the most we can do is email them your question. Of course, if you do have any questions we are happy to assist, so please don't hesitate to reach out and we'll try our best to answer it ourselves or get it to someone who can. Thanks!"
UCSD,fnaxu0e,t3_g0l8gl,1586805725.0,"Looks like it may have been an issue with the Muir College Newsletter from our mailblast software. Please disregard, our apologies for the additional mail clutter."
UCSD,fn995fk,t3_g0d2bb,1586763892.0,"Taking a look at the submitted ticket, I see that our Datacomm team and the user are still working on the current issue. Our Datacomm team was able to resolve one issue that was causing many of the problems on the 8th in that ticket, which made the situation much better, and since then they've been in the troubleshooting phase on what appears to be a separate issue occurring. We apologize for the inconvenience but please be aware that this issue is currently under investigation and will hopefully be resolved soon."
UCSD,fn7r2nx,t1_fn7pydd,1586725912.0,"Oh, can you contact us again so we can get you another alias, if you would like a different one? Usernames that were deleted from prior to 2017 aren't stored as far as I know, so we aren't able to double check before reassigning them. We communicated what would happen to pre-2017 accounts, so hopefully it isn't an issue for most students from that time period who changed their accounts to use different emails. I apologize for this, but we've rectified our current systems so it won't happen to students after 2017 who keep their email."
UCSD,fn7bmyj,t1_fn78t8z,1586717135.0,"Actually, only people who left UCSD before 2017 would have their username reused ever. Even then, prior to 2017, you would still be given a new alumni forwarding email address upon graduation so you still had a UCSD email address. We switched over to keeping the same username post-graduation in 2017 though, so simply sign up for Alumni Email Forwarding for Life after graduation and you will be able to set your current UCSD email address up as an alias to a personal email account (allowing you to send and receive through it)."
UCSD,fn7baoh,t3_g01fln,1586716943.0,"Prior to 2017, students would receive a new email address for their [alumni.ucsd.edu](https://alumni.ucsd.edu) email address, allowing usernames to be reused, since PID was the real differentiator. All students after 2017 will keep their current username by getting Alumni Email Forwarding for Life set up, so current students shouldn't need to worry about their email being reused someday. However, this does mean some previous emails are still being reused. If you contact us at [servicedesk@ucsd.edu](mailto:servicedesk@ucsd.edu) and let us know that you have a reused username and would like an alias, we can get you an email alias which you can send and receive from while you're a student so that you can access Facebook groups and Amazon free trials. For the name issue, you may be able to contact Pearson and let them know the issue and see if they can change your name on their system."
UCSD,fmq2zjf,t1_fm9316h,1586291935.0," If you are having issues with the on-campus internet, would you mind reaching out to us at [servicedesk@ucsd.edu](mailto:servicedesk@ucsd.edu) with your username, your MAC address, and your location so we can take a look? It really helps to have information on the areas where you are experiencing issues so we can help assist. Thanks!"
UCSD,flyrq0z,t1_flw2gyi,1585607784.0,"It doesn't sound like that to me just because duo-registration should be accessible everywhere, unless a nation blocked it. Grad students (which I figure you are) sometimes get sent their account details by their department before ITS has finished setting it up, and this can cause weird problems. We'll be sure to take a look at the issue in your email, though, and figure out the issue."
