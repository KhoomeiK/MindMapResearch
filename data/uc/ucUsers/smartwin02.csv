There is Barrett specific programming that may help you stand out,  but you wouldn’t be the only premed honors students so I don’t know how helpful it would be.

So the question is ASU or UCI. 

I happened to go to both schools and was premed at ASU. It was a fun experience and each school has its perks. One of the biggest downsides is that ASU can get really expensive. UCI makes it hard to take a variety of classes or change your major (so if you ended up changing from premed, which a lot of people at ASU do) you don’t have the flexibility as an anteater. 

They’re two totally different atmospheres, but both have towns around them. ASU is a “dry” campus, but UCI isn’t (but I think they still manage to be drier than ASU). 

Both schools will get you into pre-med, but only one will allow you to say Barret the Honors College every time someone asks you where you live.
