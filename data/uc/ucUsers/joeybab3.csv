ninebot,fpijgbs,t1_fpijclm,1588642174.0,"Oh yeah duh sorry I forgot that‚Äôs like the first thing I should have checked haha. And yeh you definitely still need a physical lock, the electronic lock doesn‚Äôt stop someone from just picking it up lmao"
lasers,fpifyvp,t1_fphzm3e,1588640111.0,"I bought a bunch of 505nm diodes for below $100 a while back, so either those have gone up in price or they are also an option"
ninebot,fpie6sz,t1_fpi69rb,1588639071.0,"Buy a new dashboard and replace it.

Through the app, although it sounds like they may no longer support that because they want you to upgrade to the latest firmware instead.

The app is only necessary to upgrade firmware, Check mileage, and lock and unlock the scooter or hangs the color of the lights on the bottom if you have those."
ninebot,fphux7u,t3_gdhie1,1588628261.0,"1) You were probably given a clone dashboard then

2) lock the scooter and then try and move it to see what it does

3) they can‚Äôt turn it off but they can pair to it and if you don‚Äôt have the latest blue they can pair without you doing anything unless you have a password set

4) what?"
ElectricScooters,fp6ttcn,t1_fp6tqur,1588358474.0,You‚Äôve flashed the dashboard and esc?
ElectricScooters,fp6hw58,t1_fp5ld41,1588352622.0,If you‚Äôve successfully updated the firmware with the app then haven‚Äôt you successfully connected it?

UCSantaCruz,foshtv9,t3_g8uec7,1588030990.0,What‚Äôs your plan with the response data?
ninebot,fokt1zt,t3_g7y1jk,1587848405.0,You can replace the throttle hall sensor or the whole throttle to fix that assuming it didn‚Äôt just come unplugged. Did you try checking the connection of the cables to the dashboard?
opensource,foksiso,t1_fokrpro,1587848112.0,Press ctrl+shift+r to force reload and it should fix it
opensource,fok2qo1,t3_g7i5ho,1587834306.0,"Sounds like their certificate expired, I went there not and didn‚Äôt experience that so seems they‚Äôve fixed it."
ninebot,fok19gd,t1_fojrq3x,1587833491.0,"A flathead? I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that, security torx aren‚Äôt hard to find online or even in some hardware stores and his already look ready to strip should he attempt to use something that‚Äôs not intended to be used"
ElectricScooters,fog7rj4,t1_fog493h,1587749020.0,I‚Äôve driven 1000 miles on an es4 followed by almost 1000 on a max and while I never noticed the weight of the battery on the stem when I rode the es4 after going back to it a few times once I switched to the max I can definitely say you can feel it‚Äôs a bit heavier and affects the feeling of turning a bit more than I remembered.

ninebot,fo73ww2,t1_fo73nuk,1587571805.0,"This is correct, the property you‚Äôre thinking of is the start speed, but in general keep it at 1 or 2kmh so you don‚Äôt put too much strain on the motor"
ninebot,fo3pqes,t1_fo37tsf,1587490925.0,"7 comments on this post and yours is the only one that has any real helpful information for this guy lmao... 

To add, I‚Äôm assuming this is one of those ‚Äúbird es1-300‚Äù or whatever they called the model number but is essentially just a bird that they put a dashboard in. 

I‚Äôve seen probably 15 threads with this exact issue and people saying ‚Äúwell mine works so yours should too‚Äù... if the dashboard doesn‚Äôt work your two options are to buy a new one or attempt to stlink the one you have"

ninebot,fnejd12,t3_g17fx4,1586890413.0,The battery itself has 4 lights that pressing the button on the top a few times should activate to show the charge level. Do you know why firmware version your battery is on?
ninebot,fncfhot,t3_g0w4xs,1586835486.0,You can remove the regen brake using custom firmware but that puts you at even more risk to blow the ESC.
