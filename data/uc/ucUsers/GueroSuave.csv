PSO2,fpiwcfd,t1_fpeer2h,1588650256.0,"To be honest, back in the day it was worse. The first 13âœ¨ was Aeries and dropped from the first ultimate quest which was a 12 man MPA area you'd run around in collecting points. It only dropped from one mob that you'd see every 1-2 runs. People were under geared so that content was tough. Anyways you'd see maybe like 5-10 drops a day. Shipwide. Imagine the grind. Worst of all was that there was little to no benefit to running it outside of that'd drop as most people were already Max leveled and there weren't any other real good items that dropped there."

radgame,fp7sah0,t1_fp7qwvv,1588376751.0,"Lovely hearing back with such passionate responses! Thank you!

Reading through your response again I just wanna echo how much I appreciate your feedback! It's cool to know some of the abilities even have two different kinds of upgrades. So far I've been most find of the mutations that offer me mechanically different options from Bat. I really like Cobruh haha."
radgame,fp7c756,t1_fp6sebs,1588367885.0,"Gotcha. I got the mutations bat and that helped with speeding along combat. One of the difficulties I'm having with the game so far is that while mutations change gameplay drastically, some feel incredibly underwhelming when compared to others. This is normal for Roguelikes, but it feels different in this game. 

In most Roguelikes, the item acquisition/skill acquisition is tied to chance or Chests. From what I've experienced so far the core gameplay changes come in the form of Mutations and collecting different bats. And the only way to gain Skill Mutations as far as I've observed is through killing enemies in a level up fashion. However some of the mutations just feel lousy early on and make clearing 1-1/1-2 a drag depending on the bosses you get. For example, I just had a run where my two mutations were Root and the little back buddy that shoots people. When I got to the Minotaur, I had little choice but to try and melee attack him due to not having effective damage to hit him from a range. While that's typical of other Roguelikes, I.E. sometimes you just don't get good guns, it doesn't really feel like RAD has a system in place in order to recycle/get rid of Skill Mutations that aren't doing work. 

This makes me feel obligated to restart a run if I get a Skill mutation that makes combat less interesting. Over 6 runs I've maybe seen a total of 8 different mutations and in several runs I've gotten the same mutations repeatedly in different orders. Is this how large the mutation pool is? It's understandable considering how difficult these look to program, but when some of them feel downright useless when compared to things like Snakehead, the core gameplay get shaken.

I like the exo-mutations, but a great deal of them seem focused around quality of life issues instead of increased damage potential. Stacking run speed is nice, but why can't I stack the fireproof skill and gain the ability to burn enemies on hit or something? Of the exo-mutations I've also seen the same handful over and over again. Coming from games where I'm used to seeing 15-20+ variability in builds, I feel underpowered in the face of content after full clearing each level. 

This would be balanced out if chests were rewarding. But half the time I feel like chests only give consumables. And if they do get an Artifact I'm limited to only one. Am I just not far enough in the game to see the crazy cool stuff, or is this the main gameplay loop? I generally don't feel rewarded damage wise for opening chests. Being a seasoned Enter the Gungeon, Dead Cells, and Risk of Rain fan, I was looking forward to this interesting Roguelike. It has a ton of potential, but I just don't feel rewarded for making progress in my run. 

Are there plans for more updates? Am I just getting unlucky in my drops?"

PSO2,fowgiha,t1_fow9myt,1588119327.0,It is under the boost area of the simulator. It's right under the tab where you add the Affix Booster on the right hand side. It should just be Add PP.
PSO2,fow7lmk,t1_fovz8fw,1588114495.0,"They were mildly expensive units. The Affixes I used were Base: Spirit 3, junk, junk. Fod1,2,3: Rappy Soul, Arkz Fever, junk. Fod4,5: Spirit 3, Junk, Junk. Add Boost PP. 

Upslotting with a 30% affix boost gives you a 100% on Spirit 3, PP Boost, and Fever and a 80% or 86% boost on Rappy soul, I'm not sure. Altogether this won't give you a ton of stats outside of PP. When I bought my Fodders for the Fever and Rappy soul they were a mil each and I needed 9 but I hunted down 4 on my own. Still worth it and cheaper than trying to Max stats. I would prefer Rappy Soul only units but they tend to always drop with Arks fever. The best time to buy/hunt is on PSO2 days. Altogether those Affixes cost about 8 mil and were still less expensive overall than the 125 S Attack units I am building for my main. 

I figured the investment was worth it because I'll have access to decent Phantom gains with these units as soon as it's released.

They also make for pretty beastly units on any class I'm just messing around with because I'll always have a rediculous P.P. pool"
PSO2,fov47ls,t1_fouzhim,1588095111.0,"Oh NVM. If you're on JP get some 12* units and affix them for a single attack stat. Make that your goal while you level up other classes. You're going to need to make a decision for who your main is going to be for the foreseeable future. Once you get rolling you'll have enough resources to make decent units for each stat, but for now you're going to want to pick one to stick with.

Edit: It's fine to play For and Ra but invest in the S Attack units so you can get through content. You can gesr up Ra and Fo when you have a better understanding of the process and have the extra money to make them their own stat sets."
PSO2,fov0a53,t1_fou544d,1588093290.0,That is Positron Blast or End Attract in JP. It has 3 damage levels. The first is uncharged and happens when you just tap it. This will do the least amount of damage and only hits the enemy once. The second is the first level of charge and will hit enemies 1-2 times depending on angle and enemy. The third is the second level of charge and does the most damage and can hit the enemies for 2-3 hits depending on the duder.
PSO2,fouzk3c,t1_fou2iyj,1588092954.0,"On my ranger in NA I'm affixing everything for full PP because it's the cheapest and most effective stat I can invest in. Unfortunately stat souls for ranger are big booty expensive atm and not worth investing for 11* units we'll dump the moment we get 12* units. On my Brissa set I put Rappy Soul, Spirits 3, Arkz Fever, PP Boost. For +18 pp each unit. On my weapons I do the same or better. This easily outs me at 214 PP with most of my weapons. This does fine with our current content and my damage is competitive with Luke's.

Edit: You can also achieve the same dash by putting Piercing Shot on your subpallete (the ability that looks like a thin arrow). If you start dash- hold left trigger on Piercing Shot on your subpallete - and then spam dash, you will do the same fast dash back to back but it will consume PP to pull off. This is a great tool, but not as effective as LA cancel. I only mention it because it's more doable on controller than LA cancel."

PSO2,fote479,t3_g98pb1,1588051300.0,"Ship 1 has been extremely populated and prolifically fun. If your ship is really feeling like a ghost town I would try Ship 2 or Ship 1. They are both active ships and will have vets that can teach you the game. Level 28 is a 4-10 hour investment for some people so I understand any hesitation. But keep in mind once you kick it off in this game you'll have well over 120 hours on one character. 

I've got 150 on each of my two characters . . .

I mentioned this because I do not suggest you pay to character transfer to a different ship, you might as well start fresh.

Edit: Its also worth mentioning that all your gear and progress is stored on that Ship. So if you start fresh in a new ship you won't have any of the meseta in your storage or items in storage you have from the original ship.

If you do transfer a character, you bring along all your progress and anything you can fit in your inventory, including withdrawn meseta."
PSO2,fotdnq9,t3_g9bebe,1588050940.0,"One of the main ways you make money is by selling items you find/hunt for to other players through the marketplace. Imagine this like Photon Drop trading on blueburst. 

You can buy items from anyone anytime for free. However to sell items to people, I.E. open your shop, you have to have a Shop Pass. This can be obtained two ways. The first is through the purchase of Premium which gives you the ability to sell items through your shop while it's active. Premium gives a meriad of other abilities one of the most beneficial being the ability to use a Buff Drink that gives you a boost to finding weapons and armor with more abilities on them. This boost is nice, but marginal and just helps you acquire money more evenly instead of getting lucky and getting a higher 'slot' weapon or armor. There is a free version of this not in NA release yet. 

The second way to open a shop is through the use of a 3 Day Shop Pass which you get through a Fun Scratcher. Being a scratcher the chances of getting one are usually 1.3% per scratch attempt. Luckily there is the ability to do scratchers 10 times in one button press AND the ability to purchase the required resource for those 10 scratchers for 1 excube. This allows you to farm your way to a 3 day Shop pass where you get to post all the crap you want to sell. The items you put up for sale also stay for sale even after your 3 day Shop pass expires. 

For example, I have has to spend 7 Excubes to get 7000 Fun to open 70 scratchers in order to get a shop pass and make my money from selling stuff. Whereas my brother hit a high streak of 53 Excubes before he got a shop pass. 

So sometimes, the Premium becomes necessary in order to sell all the good shit you have, but luckily the game gives you ample storage until you bite the bullet."

PSO2,forpkyk,t1_forj7mu,1588016263.0,As far as I'm aware there are Support Techniques that are automatically cast using a certain trigger after certain P.A.s. You can look up a boots guide. I also know that the Boots Active that boosts a bunch of stuff also boosts cast speed of techniques. I also think that techniques are innately charged faster with jet boots than other weapons such as rod or wand.
PSO2,for1nvx,t1_foqv2m8,1588004637.0,Sigma Boots are probably bouncers strongest option right now considering the difficulty of getting good boots. They're 12* and have a decent pot that synergizes well with Te/Bo's high Crit potential. They're also all class.
westworld,for0nho,t1_fop56pq,1588004128.0,"I think this episode does add more clarity to Maeve's motivations. In Maeve's eyes we are shown that Dolores is a warmonger so obsessed with the prime reality that she cannot accept that the rest of the hosts are in an oasis of their own. This driving belief that Dolores will use whatever means necessary to secure the prime reality or at least a portion of it for hosts to exist in, leads to the core fear that Dolores will rip hosts from their oasis in order to fight for her. 

We know that Dolores is not doing that as we have seen her go out of her way to make copies of herself to fight the good fight. In fact Maeve sees this making of copies as further shackling of her kind for Dolores's dream, and in killing the copies I am sure Maeve sees some sort of liberation in their deaths. 

Maeve is no puppet and nothing we have seen this season has pushed us to believe her motivations are one with Serac. However at their core, especially considering Maeve has no love for humanity, she sees the hosts currently operating in the prime reality as Serac sees the outliers. As a threat to a Utopia. In this way Serac and Maeve's motivations align, if only for a small sliver of the Venn Diagram of what makes them distinct characters. 

Maeve's motivations in this season have maintained a level of dedication to her character that we have come to expect from the show. Her actions however, are another story. Maeve's actions demonstrate hesitation and confusion about her own goals. This no doubt comes from the physical limiters that Serac has found a way to enable on Maeve's prime body. We see her capabilities when disconnected from her prime body, but when in her host form, Maeve's powers dwindle and are no doubt limited by some sort of technology installed in the host body itself which Serac provided. This makes far more sense than Serac possessing the ability to ""rewrite"" some of Maeve's core traits."

PSO2,foqx4b5,t3_g8z0gl,1588002364.0,"To clarify what was said in another post, you need to be saving some of your photon Boosters to change into Ultimate boosters. Once you have around 10k photon Boosters then you can start using them again for Excubes/photon Spheres swap fodder"
PSO2,foqwqms,t3_g9306w,1588002178.0,"They aren't bad in the current NA build. Summoner is actually the only class with every gameplay mechanic readily available to them from base NA release. That being said Summoner is a complicated investment requiring upward of 100 lambda grinders to make competitive. Due to that learning curve, the majority of our NA summoners do not know how to build or grind their pets. That chasm of information has probably left many parties feeling they are carrying their summoners and thus seeing them as deadweight."
PSO2,foqmqdw,t1_foqb192,1587996890.0,"Te/Fo is garbage. Te/Bo is incredibly more viable than Te/Fo. Te/Bo gains the bonus being able to instantly cast support spells after P.A.s using the Jet Boots. It also has the added bonus of giving allies Crit Field and PP Field. Te/Bo also boasts a high cast rate making Zanverse spam feel better. I would say it's more like a different playstyle with overall less DPS than Te/HuorFi. However Te/Bo should still be played as a melee class and not a spell based class focus. You should be using jet boots and taking advantage of the striking capabilities paired with the buffed Shifta and Deband you have. This class will still pump out more damage than a Te/Fo, but won't be as optimal as wand wacking.

I recommend testing it out. Techter with jet boots is fun as hell."

PSO2,fopgl29,t1_fopd8ch,1587960947.0,He still needed the detailed explanation of how rod element works. Most people don't understand it.
PSO2,foo6kdo,t1_fonb0yj,1587933488.0,"The way techniques work is actually super interesting. With rod the element on your weapon actually only applies to the smacks you do with the rod. Element conversion in the Force tree gives 50% damage boost when using correct technique types versus enemies (foie versus forest monsters) and 45% damage against enemies without using the correct element (light versus forest monsters). With a  60 ele 13* rod of any element, this means you do 30% more damage to enemies you're using the correct spell type they are weak to and 27% damage versus enemies with the incorrect weakness element. So overall rod element type doesn't really matter, what you want to make sure of is you have that flat 50 or 60 element on the rod. 

This applies to techniques used on any weapons. I.E. techniques used on Jet Boots do not gain a boost from the element on the weapon itself. Rod is special because the Force tree has that Skill you can invest in to get bonus damage based on the Element Grind Level of your weapon. 

The element on a weapon actually only augments the stats of the base weapon. I.E. a 60 Light Rifle will only do 60% more of the Rifle's damage stat against enemies weak to light. This is why people used to run Rainbow sets of gear in order to maximize damage against all weakness types."
PSO2,foo5rhv,t3_g8cb4u,1587933042.0,"The thing about mags is that the stats they give you apply BEFORE multipliers. This makes the difference between a 150 attack mag and a 200 attack mag staggeringly stark. 

For example, if I use a 20% dmg bonus from Alliance tree and a 20% damage bonus from Shifta Drink L then that's 40% bonus on the base stat. That's an 80 damage base boost because of my mag versus a 60 damage base boost from a 150 mag. But consider how many other multipliers characters have available to them, all boosting the stats based on what you had originally. Overall growth can become a huge chasm of damage with all these multipliers taken into effect. 

Furthermore a 200 attk stat mag will allow you to equip 14*s and 15*s as they come out. Where that 50 Dex or something you invested in outside of a pure mag will make it more difficult to equip endgame gear while ALSO drastically lowering your damage. 

While it's useful to have sex right now to satisfy equip conditions, unless you're going for a 200 Dex mag, it's not effective to invest in a 200 stat mag. 

That being said if you f'd up , it's not the end of the world."

And you are correct, Shifta and Zanverse are the bomb. But the Techter in the 2:22 Luther run on NA wasn't just casting Shifta and Zanverse and heals.

I want to clarify something though, can you further describe what it means for someone to be Elitist? Because just throwing the word around doesn't really help the problem in NA. I do not think it's Elitist to help your guildies gear up and to spread knowledge about what works and what absolutely does not work . 

For example, if you're level 70 and have a few mil from doing your daily missions/ saving etc, you should be able to +30 a 12* Sigma weapon. This is a difficult accomplishment for some people as grinding can be confusing. But I rarely seem people in public asking about how they can upgrade their gear. If you're in a Falz Luther run and it takes 20 minutes even though people keep trying to break the clock, odds are it's either 1) People don't have upgraded weapons equipped or 2) People are using/ Playing class combinations or have invested in skills that do not do damage. 

Unfortunately in PSO2 the name of the game is doing damage and while other builds are fun, unless you can do damage in some for or another while you're using that build you become dead weight in an MPA. For example, playing Techter/Force in Falz Luther and only using Tali's to heal people from the back and cast shifta/Deband and maybe Zanverse. That's an interesting playstyle and if you're actually casting Zanverse you'll be doing a little damage, but if you aren't you literally are making your MPA an 11.1/12 because you're leaving so much damage off the table by only using Resta and Shifta. And sure, you're being a healer, BUT you can heal AND do damage as a Force/Tecther or a Techter/Hunter or a Techter/Fighter by wand wacking for hundreds of thousands of damage and buffing people when Shifta and Deband drops and casting Zanverse in an MPA to buff the damage of your entire party on that boss by 20%. But how many of you have asked about it? I'm fairly active on this thread and in game and rarely in lobby do I see people asking for help. 

There's a difference between being Elitist and having a reasonable expectation of the playerbase WANTING to get better. Asking for help is important and if these people refused to help you after you asked, that's Elitist. But if you never even asked, how can they help you with a problem they didn't even know you had? Slamming everyone who's better than you as Elitist is a quick way to divide the community and spread misinformation among players. There's a HUGE learning curve to PSO2 and it takes asking for help and actually acting on the information to get through the harder content to come. Falz Luther is a joke compared to the bosses we're going to be getting soon, ask for help now so you can enjoy the content as it comes. 

In Example, someone is not elitist for pointing out that at level 75 someone wearing 5 million in cosmetics should not have an +0 Sigma weapon. If you're here to play the game, you've gotta be investing your ability TO PLAY THE GAME. Some people play the game differently, and if that's your mindset power to you. But you don't get to call people elitist for actually trying to be better at the game if all you do is dress up your waifu. 

To reiterate you can't call people elitist if you never asked for help or if you didn't take their well informed advice. There are a ton of different class combos that work and a ton that are absolute garbage, but you'll never know until you ask with the attitude that ""that person isn't shitting on my playstyle, they're telling me the objective truth about the game."" Te/Fo is objectively awful. You gain nothing that Fo/Te wouldn't do better via dmg or that Te/Fi or Te/Hu wouldn't do better via dmg and buffing. Pouring all of your subclass skillpoints into Sattack up and Rattack up etc is a noob trap that you need to ask about if you're unfamiliar with skilltrees. There is a ton of Power, Utility, and Gameplay changes to be had by investing in the subclass's actual skills, and you'd never know unless you asked. 

PSO2 is not a simple game. Ask for help, the vast majority will gladly give it. Lay down your pride enough to actually accept the help and you'll find they aren't elitists, they're just better informed and only want what's best for you. Because they've been there, they've wasted skill trees, they've held back groups, they've made the game harder for themselves by not listening. That being said, if you ask for help and they say ""fuck off newb, no casuals allowed"" that's an elitist right there."

UCSD,fo9n5kn,t3_g6g2vk,1587624529.0,I miss teaching so I'm making a classroom. Love the animal crossing talk going around. Periodically when I hold section of office hours my secret pleasure is using Animal Crossing as an example in a problem and hoping some of my students are playing the game as well.

PSO2,fo4x3fc,t1_fo4cful,1587512929.0,Lol. It's not criticism. It's advise. Modulator is too expensive right now you're right. But for a weapon it's ez mode right now because of augment factors. For example a +35 Twin Missouri 11* from photon booster shop will give you 100% chance to put Flict Tyro on your weapon and take up 1 augment slot.
PSO2,fo4aq3c,t3_g5mhmr,1587501098.0,"You don't need soul receptor on the weapon. I believe those just have soul receptor as the +35 augment factor, which means whenever you augment you'll have soul receptor in the Augmenting pool. This means you have a 100% chance to get any soul you want on that weapon without having to slot in soul receptor. 

In the future it my behoof you to look at other weapon augment factors as you can use them to put some great stuff on your weapon with a 100% chance.

Edit: I don't know how you read my whole comment and though ""what a bastard how dare he criticize my build,"" when I was literally just giving advice for the future and providing context for why people were giving you shit about having Soul Receptor on the weapon. In no way, shape, or form did I criticize you, but now I will:

Criticism is how we learn. If you want to play PSO2 one if the MMOs out there with as steep or steeper a learning curve than Warframe, you have to be ready to accept criticism. We're all on a journey. I feel bad you didn't reach out to other people and lost an opportunity to put even more damage or PP on your weapon which is the reason I made my post. In the future, please reach out before doing an affix either to the subreddit or to your alliance in game. There are many guides that will explain the benefits and drawbacks of certain builds. Curb your outrage and grow up. We want a nice community for NA."

PSO2,fo3oq6h,t3_g5inz4,1587490444.0,"The first potential isn't too bad. It gives 20% Crit at +30 and 13% extra damage at close range. AND it restores hp based on damage dealt. 

 The H10 Missouri give +14% damage all the time and +2 pp on normal attack hit.

Edit: My bad was reading wrong one. You should always be upclose and personal as Gunner anyways so it makes it a fairly good pair with lifesteal which is EXTREMELY hard to get on a weapon right now. Unfortunately I've been researching it more and the lifesteal is literally 1 HP and basically just lets you know when you're close enough to activate the potential. These are still very good, but you're better off using something that doesn't require such situational positioning."

PSO2,fo18sp1,t3_g53kou,1587428094.0,"You may find an alliance like that here but the best way is to go to your Quick Menu and change display status to Alliance/Character name. This will make it so you can see what alliances people are in. Then you can play with random people until you grind with someone really cool or who seems nice and you can ask them about their alliance and if they are okay with casual players. 

Pretty much all NA guilds atm are okay with casual players."
PSO2,fo06hl8,t1_fnw8lav,1587406929.0,"Tech gives you Fo/Te, Phantom Rod only, and Summoner. That's it. Note I said Force/Techter and not Force and Techter. That's because Techter main class gets very little out of tech and is actually much better using an Sattack mag with a Hunter subclass or a Phantom Subclass. So no, Tech does not give you as many options and will be obsolete the moment Phantom comes out. Do not be swindled my child."
PSO2,fo065do,t3_g3w5po,1587406760.0,"I would go with a full Dex Mag. You're not gonna lose out on a ton and affords you the swap over to Main Class Phantom once you get bored of summoner's rediculous investment cost. The Dex Mag benefits also allow you to play Bouncer/Phantom and Braver/Phantom and have a ton of damage from the mag allocation bonuses on those classes. It also allows you to level pretty much any class you want with Phantom as the subclass and not be punished for it. 

The only reason you would ever go pure tech is if you wanted to only play Summoner. And if you're going to wait till PC you're going to want to be able to level up other classes for the class bonuses.

The skill on Phantom, Bouncer, and Braver gives you stats with a 100% exchange rate based on the Dex you have. I.E. Phantom as a subclass gives you 200 Sattack, Rattack, and T-Attack on top of 200 Dex. Bouncer gives 200 Sattack and Tattack. The benefits of building a 100% Tech mag will immediately fall off the moment we get Phantom. Meaning it's a shortsighted investment that nets you basically nothing. 

""but what if I wanna play force."" Great. But the moment Phantom comes out your class is outclassed in every way and your Tech mag limits your versatility as a Phantom main. 

Don't listen to these fools. Invest in Dex. Don't waste $3.50 later to buy another mag."

You actually use either DB Snatch Left ring or Homing DB Left ring. And there are much better combos for Photon Blades than normal attacking. They go over the various strings you can do. One which does plenty of dps and outdamages the mid range is Dash Wing - Photon Blade - Dash Wing - Photon Blade. 

Another non-Just Attack combo you can use is to throw Razan in your subpallete and to use Left trigger to activate subpallete skills. This let's you hold Razan to cancel the animation early on your Photon Blade Animation getting blades out. Left trigger hold- Spam RB. You can use this in the air and you become a needler. This technique is effective at Max range, but loses out on overall dps to the Dash Wing Technique or other techniques that Just Attack the blades."

PSO2,fnq3nky,t3_g2xder,1587157060.0,"You want to farm Abduction in a group of 4 though. It drastically increases your chances of getting items with modulator on them. You should also pop Rare Drop Boosts when fighting the clones at the end. Once you pick up the items all of your party members should remove their armor and die to Falz. This keeps you from resetting abduction chance by completing the quest.

It is important to note that you have to complete the Time Attack quest in order to keep abduction rate up. So you have to do something like Naverius Beginner and complete it and then keep doing that until abducted. Once abducted you have to die at the end and retire from quest instead of completing it to maintain chance of abduction. If you abandon you reset abduction chance."

ror2,fneb7wn,t1_fne7wvm,1586886259.0,Yes that item. It stacks and after two I had 24 Ammon on my primary and by the time it recharged I got all 24 back. My turrets shot it much faster and it homed and like honestly the moment I bought it my turn turned into a god run. I stacked two and then spent all my greens on a Behemoth and a Shatterer and from then on the run was cake. This was on monsoon as well.
ror2,fne2z74,t1_fnbq1yx,1586882144.0,One thing I wanna add since I haven't seen it yet is the use of The Lunar Item Primary. When you guys this item it replaced your grenade primary AND your turret primary and they stack. It is overpowered as hell on your turrets
ror2,fne2m8d,t1_fnd49kv,1586881963.0,"I wanted to mention the build I've seen for blight acrid is when you have 2-4 acrids in one game. The different blights applied by each person stack whereas poison does not. Any other time, poison is your go to. This also means you have to coordinate with the other Acrid to take blight.

I also like the alternate Utility skill, but unfortunately it falls off late game as it fails to stun larger elite enemies making it next to useless as the game scales. Early game it can be fun stunlocking and smash smash smashing but late game you'll be hurting for your poison smash."

ror2,fn5kx3j,t1_fn5h7gx,1586667677.0,Wait does 57 Leaf Clover not affect drops? Are you sure? I've had runs where it feels like it boosts weapon drops drastically with Sacrifice. Does it work well in non Sacrifice mode with just chests?
ror2,fn452zw,t1_fn433ui,1586634225.0,"57 Leaf Clover makes it so any chance item you have has a second chance to proc. This means on crits the game basically checks each attack twice and takes the ""Success,"" out of the two which is the actual damage displayed. This also applies to Sacrifice Artifact which makes items drop from enemies. So now each time and enemy dies it checks twice for a drop. The actual percentages aren't doubled though because that's not how probabilities work, but it averages out to a 16% chance increase for drops with one clover. Other than that I'm sure there's spreadsheets with more specifics than I can provide.

Edit: Since this is getting so much attention I figured I'd edit and include what others pointed out below. Sacrifice does not have affected drop chances when using clover. It is still a great early investment as it does provide hella boosts to % chance items which make up the bulk of your DPS as they stack. Using Death's Mark in combination with this legendary is an incredibly build and will yield map clearing damage on any character. I recommend Acrid, Elites Only, Double Spawns less Health, Command, Sacrifice, Gasoline, Guillotine, Chrobobauble, Tritip Dagger, Death's Mark."
