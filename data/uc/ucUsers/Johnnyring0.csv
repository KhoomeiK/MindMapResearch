Diablo,fpcdowq,t1_fpcda3x,1588496645.0,"Yeah my barb and wizard just made it thru GR 103 today in 10 minutes. 

WW barb, LOD Hydra wizard. Full ancient gear on both, barb has 2 primal weapons. 

Just not getting items for my other characters I’ve been trying to build and it’s difficult getting thru lower GR rifts without proper gear to unlock T16. The long haul grind of caldesannes for multiple items on each character is so daunting with 4-6 characters. Still fun though. Really rewarding defeating that next higher GR level each time."
Drugs,fpc2eo1,t1_fpc24o9,1588485431.0,Yeah that makes sense. I honestly don’t really know what the big concerns of banks are. I would assume illegal activity and it makes sense that money laundering certainly makes that list.
Drugs,fpc1spw,t1_fpc1euy,1588484897.0,"I understand that, my advice was intended to help OP get more information as to why the bank was looking into this in the first place. The goal would not to be caught playing dumb, but appear as actually dumb. 

Also, playing aloof in regards to buying bitcoin is not that far fetched. I’d venture to say most people don’t have a clue what bitcoins actually are, and a lot of people are oddly willing to buy things they have zero understanding about. 

Without knowing OP  is actually well informed enough to buy bitcoins and then use them to obtain drugs from the internet, buying bitcoins and being scammed out of them is fairly plausible. There are so many dumb people that lose money everyday on the internet, including people that buy stuff and have no clue what they bought, where it is, or where it went.

I’m confused though, is buying bitcoin something your bank views as automatically suspicious, and is it something your bank prefers its customers to avoid? 

I feel Bitcoin is becoming a much more widely accepted currency in a bunch of random marketplaces."

You are allowed to ask more questions from your bank. And if you don’t feel like answering them just act aloof. Say “uhh I need to double check and I’ll call you back” or whatever. 

Being dumb is not illegal, and being dumb with your own money is also not illegal. So you can play really really dumb, and not actually answer any questions and just keep asking more questions. 

Easy way out scenario if you have to answer is “yes I purchased bitcoins but I think I lost them on an online scam, can’t seem to locate the bitcoins. not sure what happened I don’t really know how bitcoins work or what they are” 

Even that is a lot of information to give but honestly just play dumb. I wouldn’t ignore them though. If you have expendable money for a lawyer then I’m sure that’s not a bad option but I do think on some level lawyering up does give off a guilty of wrong-doing vibes"
Diablo,fpbkadw,t1_fpbcvvc,1588471964.0,"Yeah probably. I go through so many resources upgrading rare items in the cube and reforging in the cube to get ancients.

Diablo,fpbam7w,t1_fpb0ozu,1588465702.0,"I suppose after I’ve completed the game itself 4 times the “end game” character building for leaderboard GR times is the only thing left to do. And to get there you’re required to complete pieces of the game over and over with tasks like bounties and rifts. 

I’m just complaining, no one is making me play video games. 

After so many hours of game play it would be nice to have slightly higher drop percentages but it is it what it is. I know there’s plenty of other people that love it just how it is. After all this is season 20 and the game is 10 years old this month so it’s definitely passed the test of time considering how many people still play and are interested."

AskReddit,fpak3s3,t1_fpad9nc,1588449813.0,"YouTube is very helpful these days. Someone has had the problem you have, and fixed it with a video. 

Basic start tools are great to always have on hand or in the trunk of you don’t live in a risky area. An OBDII reader for codes is a priceless tool. And you can then look up corresponding codes online for whenever you get  a check engine light (“CEL”). 

Basic ratchet with 8,10,12,14 sockets. Usually Japanese cars will use 10,12,14 size sockets for almost every bolt. 

Jack stand and a jack are incredibly helpful. Use safely. 

A big thing is regular maintenance also. Don’t wait until something breaks to put money into the car. Regular oil changes, spark plugs, air filter, coolant flush, etc is very important for the car to run correctly. These items are not meant to fail, then replace. They’re supposed to be replaced before the fail and your stranded on the road. 


It may seem expensive but owning a car generally sucks and is expensive and it only gets more expensive if you wait until something breaks to repair or do maintenance"

It’s important to take a mental break. I always found I was able to retain more when I took breaks despite the stress of thinking I’ll be wasting time and falling behind.

medicine,fn88ezm,t3_g00rzk,1586736104.0,"I believe there are many factors, but one of them undoubtedly is the massive increase in shipping efficiency and thus massive decrease is shipping times. Most hospitals can place an order in and receive everything the next morning, without fail. With shipping times so fast it’s much easier to order supplies day by day and keep stock lower and save money. 

Obviously that doesn’t work when a pandemic or other massive problem occurs, but that’s why hospitals I’ve worked at in CA have gradually kept less and less “back up stock” over the years.

Another factor that drives the motivation to keep less stock on hand is most medical supply companies over charge the shit out of supplies, place false or premature expiration dates on everything to push hospitals and surg centers to order more frequently because “date says expired” and we need this on the shelf. 

In addition they “update” a lot of stuff that goes on crash carts, defibs, ventilators, etc that don’t match up to past versions or machines with the newly sightly modified version. This prompts hospitals and surg centers to replace ALL older versions. Once again this is obviously for profit."

CoronavirusOC,fmtyruh,t1_fmqdj6v,1586381411.0,"Not all nurses are well compensated! That would be conjecture to assume all nurses are compensated well and also have amazing heath insurance. Most nurses have the option to pay for better health coverage compared to someone outside of the healthcare industry, but that is not always the case. I’m addition, if you do not work full time hours, or you are per diem staff, you often do not qualify for healthcare benefits from your employer!

Even with better options, premiums are still very expensive! Many people in their early 30’s that are relatively healthy do not opt in for the higher cost premiums that have zero deductible. There are many nurses and healthcare workers that still have to pay large out of pocket amounts (as high as $20,000 first for very low monthly premium) before insurance covers anything, especially a hospital visit. Spending a single day in the ICU can cost as much as $15,000. 

In addition, hospital staff do not receive any discounted medical services as an employee. 

(I used to be a CNA at a hospital in Southern California)


I believe the point of the article was to simply state the unfortunate result of being a front line worker against COVID-19. As a nurse (or other front line worker) the rate of exposure is higher than anywhere else, and even more so when hospitals are running out of PPE and instructing nursing staff to re-use or not change out PPE as often as it should be to prevent contamination."
