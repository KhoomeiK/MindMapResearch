TransferStudents,fopu69c,t1_foptlkn,1587972247.0,"If you aren’t sure what major you want yet, I would just go with Berkeley. It is an amazing school, and (assuming) you are in the College of Letters and Sciences, it’s really easy to try out a bunch of classes to figure out what is the right major for you. If you were to apply again as a transfer student in November, you would really need to know right now what you want to major in and start planning to make sure that you can meet all of the various requirements. And, like you said, you are not guaranteed to get into either LA or Berkeley if you apply again next year. CS has to be one of the most popular majors, and that also means it has one of the lowest acceptance rates at all of the UCs.

As far as online classes go, you will be taking them this fall no matter where you go. (Not confirmed yet of course, but I don’t see how in person classes would be possible already) At least you won’t have to pay for housing which cuts down on costs for the first semester a lot."

The 40 AP credits will help get you to the 60 semester unit requirement and possibly some of the GE requirements as well, but most of the APs won’t help with your major requirements. It can be very difficult to take all of the classes you need for your major in just 2 semesters (3 if you take classes this summer). Edit: for quarter system it’s 90 quarter units required, and you will have 3 quarters or 4 if you take classes this summer

>but I don’t want to miss out on an extra year of the opportunities that both of these schools offer

Btw, you would still be expected to graduate within 2 years if you come into a UC as a transfer student whether or not you spend only 1 year at the ccc, so you would only get 2 years at the UC no matter what if you choose the ccc transfer route. 

Other answers to things I read in your post: SAT scores are not considered for UC transfer admissions. You can put down stuff from high school as a 1 year transfer, but you might want to have a couple ECs from your year at the ccc as well. You could go to a UC and try to apply to transfer, but LA/Berkeley are both very very competitive (ccc students are giving priority which knocks down your chances already going in as a UC to UC applicant), and you would not have access to any of the resources given to transfer applicants at ccc’s. 

Feel free to ask me if you have any more questions."
ApplyingToCollege,foihz83,t3_g7mkeb,1587787106.0,"California has the best community college transfer system set up to make it easy to transfer into a UC/CSU. I believe if your family income is below a certain number, UCs have the blue and gold plan that will cover tuition, but other things like housing, food, books, etc all add up to make it pretty expensive. Going cc to UC/CSU effectively cuts the price of your degree in half which is a great option if you cannot afford 4 years at these colleges."

I would say that could actually give you a shot at having your appeal accepted if you play your cards right.

In any case, I don’t think that telling them you only applied to one college this cycle is going to change their mind; it is completely and solely your fault that you chose not to have a back up option. I would leave that off of the appeal if I were you. UC Berkeley is very competitive, and there are plenty of students with 4.0 GPAs who do not get accepted; when colleges do holistic admissions, you need to show them more than just grades."
