I think it's because I write the way I talk, and so I assume that when people write, I'm imagining them say it to me, and I can't imagine anyone saying an emphatic ""mhm"" without seeming sarcastic or uninterested. If it was an ""uhuh"" that'd be a different story"

OldSchoolCool,fpj726k,t1_fpiznwl,1588658512.0,"I don't know if you really have any sort of evidence for that... it kinda just sounds like projection

Edit: Oh wait, I think I worded that poorly. The grandfather had a family with a Japanese woman, and then afterwards, came back to the states. He had no way of contacting her, and so he had to move on and eventually married a woman in the states and a family with her. He didn't exactly ""cheat"" on her, so much as have a family that his other family wasn't aware of. 

Still bad, but it's not that he was married, and then used a woman in Japan, and then left her high and dry."

I remember reading a reddit post about how this person found out their grandfather had a secret Japanese wife and family from when he was stationed in Japan, but never mentioned to his family. All he had of her was an old photograph that they later found after he died.

There's something so strange and romantic about that thought-- that you're just a kid fighting in a war, falling in love with a girl you can't even speak to. And then, one day, you have to leave it all behind.

Edit: I think people may have misunderstood my usage of the word ""romantic"", I mean in a sad, dramatic, wistful sort of sense. Not ""oh how cute he abandoned his family"", more like ""wow, what a sad, yet dramatic and incredible story to tell"""

I'm not changing definitions, I'm just saying it's link to Spongebob is very weak, and is therefore a very weak meme, as opposed to the Stars Wars one. 

I didn't even mention humor or the definition of a meme, I'm just saying it's not much of a Spongebob meme because there is nothing in this meme that has any real tie to Spongebob. 

(Also, I disagree with the fallacy that if a lot of people like something, then it is of good quality. There's a good chance that it just appeals to the common denominator. Like pop music, or Netflix shows.)"

BikiniBottomTwitter,fph9cth,t1_fpgbkn2,1588617250.0,"I disagree, because it's just a surface level connection. 

If I changed those two faces to images of Kanye when he's smiling and when he's not smiling, and posted it on the Kanye subreddit, that doesn't make it a Kanye meme. It's just a meme that happens to have Kanye's face, but no other similarity. 

Look at this meme that's at the top of the sub right now:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/BikiniBottomTwitter/comments/gd9dde/you\_are\_a\_bold\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BikiniBottomTwitter/comments/gd9dde/you_are_a_bold_one/) 

This is a solid Spongebob meme-- it's re-contextualizing Star Wars with out-of-context Songebob characters. This couldn't be any other meme, because it's fundamentally linked to Spongebob. You can't replace it with faces of random people, because there's a deeper connection. That's what makes it Spongebob, and that's what makes it funny."

You and I know that you're right in this instance-- yes, we should treat everyone the same because God treats everyone the same. That makes total sense. *But,* it's also backed up by Jesus, saying that we should love our neighbors as ourselves, and love our enemies. 

Rather than spend time about the implications about how we should treat each other, I'd rather that we find verses that are *explicitly* about how we should treat other people.

Thankfully, the Bible is a very long book, so we don't have to stretch the words and sentences-- if you think there's an implication about X, then there's very likely a verse explicitly about X."
