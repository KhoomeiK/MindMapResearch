I think you're overestimating how much software you'll need for CS-related stuff and how much space most of it takes. It's not like code or compiled packages take up much space. Honestly, it'd be effort to TRY to fill up 256gbs with development related software."

Something I’m not a huge fan of is the massive cool flushing I need to do, which is annoying considering the machine isn’t plumbable. Using a group thermometer, if I’ve had the machine on for about an hour, I need to flush about 300ml through for it to be at a usable temperature; less than 30 minutes of warmup time though, and it’s not up to temp. 

I’d almost regret not getting a Profitec 300 for the PID and short warmup time if it weren’t for the steam power. As someone who makes almost only milk drinks it’s awesome. Also, imo the Rocket look much nicer in comparison, if that’s a factor. The 300 looks way too much like a regular appliance and not a 1.5k+ machine.

MachineLearning,fp1ketf,t1_fp1dxpu,1588238546.0,"u/Blackliquid's reply is correct. Deep learning is not a decision tree or sorting. Matrix multiplication is massively parallel, and that's really what all these models are. Millions (or billions) of parameters embedded in non-linear transformations minimizing some objective function to get a desired output for some datum, and remarkably generalizing to the space in-between.

I'm sure someone with more DL theory could give a much better explanation than that, but I'm personally in the very hand-wavy CV field where it's sufficient to first find a working architecture, then yada-yada about features and manifolds later :)"

Obviously doing computer vision is quite different than data science, but I also did some RL research, took your standard ML courses, had two ML & CV internships, etc.

So, those two disclaimers aside, here is what I've been telling EVERYONE who comes in as a freshman or sophomore wanting to do machine learning: **focus on your software fundamentals first**. There's two big reasons for this, the first very real right now, and the second which is more of a loose prediction based on the attitude of many professionals in the field right now.

Firstly, unless you're a PhD at Google Brain or a leader at another top team, you're going to be writing a lot of code. You're going to have to prototype your models, write scripts to organize data and visualize stuff, and often write some infrastructure code. You're not going to have a team of coders at your disposal to write your statistical models, and you're not always going to be able to just use basic library functions. If you think of something to do, you'll be writing it yourself.

Second, and this is more speculative, there are a massive number of new ML graduates being pumped out by every university. There's high demand because there's massive hype with VCs throwing money at every ""AI"" startup and every large company wanting to build ""AI"" teams. It's unclear if this trend in industry will continue. It's unclear how quickly this field will become saturated. It's not unclear that good programmers are needed now and will be needed in the future, and if the ML field becomes saturated, that ML experts who ALSO have great CS knowledge will be more competitive and desirable.

In a TL;DR, you'll need to write code no matter what unless you're a top PhD with a team of engineers / coders to write everything for you. ML field might soon be oversaturated, CS won't. Regardless of that, if you have great CS knowledge, you'll be more competitive than the next ML applicant who doesn't."
espresso,fp0b5sk,t1_fp02z2o,1588205901.0,"Thanks for the super detailed comment! Just wondering, where would you say the variation in roast quality comes from for you? It's pretty possible to get consistent espresso once your grind / tamp / distribution technique has been sorted out, so I'm curious as to what would make a roast ""bad"", or vary at all. 

The only parameter seems to be the temperature that you roast to, and I imagine this could be fixed to achieve consistent results. Is it mostly the variation from different beans? Are there other parameters than time / temperature that influences roast quality?"

The easiest thing I can think of that likely won’t work very well unless the test images are near template matches of your training images would be to just run a nearest neighbors classifier over features from any pre-trained architecture.

I am not, so I am curious if you have the time to answer. Intuitively, it seems like a good idea to reject out of distribution images rather that classify them incorrectly with high accuracy in medicine. This is the case in robotics, where we could then use this information to inform our reliance on each system. 

Why is this a bad idea in day to day medicine?"
MachineLearning,fotmld5,t1_fotlftb,1588058691.0,"I agree, commented the same thing. Not defending Google or anything, but the title implies that this was a failure on their part with their models. 

Figuring out what didn’t work with their logistics was the contribution of the paper / study itself, which is notably in CHI, not in CVPR as they try to improve on out of distribution failures or something."
MachineLearning,fotmajc,t3_g9gs5j,1588058407.0,"TL;DR Clickbait title, read the paper. 

I recommend reading the CHI paper that was submitted rather than the article. They raise interesting points that I’m surprised weren’t anticipated and addressed prior to the study, but I suppose finding these points was the purpose of the study. 

From an algorithmic standpoint, the model seemed fine. Rejecting low quality images with high uncertainty is good. From what I read, the main issue was the expectations of the system and the internet connectivity in these regions - for example, some nurses were frustrated that they couldn’t upload two different cropped pictures of the same eye and have the system stitch them together and infer, or that blurry images would be rejected. In one case of failure, the internet was offline for 2 hours straight. 

The title seems to imply that this was a failure of the model itself, which was not the case. This is more of a logistical issue which can be circumvented by 1.) better cameras and lighting controlled rooms and 2.) hardware on-site to immediately evaluate, only transferring meta data / model weights / samples with no time constraint. In many countries, this is not an issue, and where it is, I’m sure Google can shell out the few thousand per setup."
Coffee,fos3tq6,t1_fory8hz,1588023472.0,"For espresso, the absolute bare minimum you can go is a Sette 270 or any Eureka Mignon. Any lower and you'll be very disappointed with the shots you can pull.

Thankfully, out of all the equipment you could own, a burr grinder will be the most forgiving to get used. Most have very beefy motors and the steel burrs can be relatively cheaply replaced after 500-2000lbs of coffee, so basically never unless you're opening a shop.

Keep checking that Marketplace and expect to drop about the same as you've already spent. Considering you're grinding for both espresso and drip, I'd really recommend either a single dosing grinder (like the Niche Zero) or just getting two; you could probably get by with something like the Encore for drip."
espresso,fopu6pr,t1_foptjiv,1587972259.0,"Should also note for that for a budget machine, a manual lever machine (like the Flair or Cafelat) will be good as well. Both are very popular.

For single boilers, Gaggia Classic, Lelit Anna / Glenda / Victoria, and Rancilio Silvia (bit overpriced now, lots of newer machines with PID) are all classics. 

No matter what, don’t skimp on the grinder, as it’s far more important in lower budgets. Both a Linea Mini and a Lelit Anna will push 9 bars of fairly well controlled water through a portafilter, but variety in grind consistency is massive. Minumum is a Sette 270 / Eureka Mignon."

Also, if you ever get interested in it, you can install manual flow control mods on the R58. You couldn't do this with a group thermometer.

If you're plumbing, the flushing could be less of an issue. I would also probably recommend a better grinder, since you're in the 2k+ price point for a machine.

I left a [detailed comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/fz00ru/first_espresso_machine/fn4g48s/) explaining what you're trying to control.

Sette 270 is good, Niche Zero is great (especially for single dosing), and the Eureka Mignon Specialita is this subs ""new standard"" recommendation.

For a long time, the Sette 270 was the best starting option, but a [European distributor](https://www.espressocoffeeshop.com/Eureka-Mignon-Specialita) started selling the Specialita internationally for the same price as the Sette. Click the link, select 110 volt (ignore the USA option - that's there so American distributors don't get upset at them undercutting), and click ""ask for discount code"" - you don't need to ask, they have one there for you.

Also to note, if money is a concern look for a used grinder. Grinders last forever (especially in a home setting), so a second hand one can both save money and significantly upgrade your grinder. I've seen year old Eureka Atoms and Mazzer Minis for half price. 

**Edit:** It looks like they're out of stock of the 110v Specialitas. There's also the [Perfetto](https://www.espressocoffeeshop.com/coffee-grinders/coffee-grinders-eureka/eureka-coffee-grinders-home/Eureka-Mignon-Perfetto), which looks like it's in stock. You can google around for pros and cons compared to the Sette. Two biggest factors would be larger flat burrs (+) and more retention (-), although retention is minimal at <1g for both."
espresso,fn4g48s,t1_fn39wqx,1586640686.0,"I think anywhere you go on this sub a lot of people are going to be encouraging you to spend more money, but I'll try to justify it here. 

Without flow control / preinfusion, these are the parameters you'll control with your espresso: 

\- **Tamping:** Ideally your tamping is consistent and even, so there's not really much to change there once you have it down. 

\- **Dose and Ratio:** Your dose and ratio will be something like 17 - 20 grams in (of grounds) and 35 - 45 grams out (of espresso) - this will depend on your personal preference and bean type. 

\- **Temperature:** You don't have much control over temperature without a PID, but you can ""temp surf"" - when you hear the heating element turn on, your brew temp will be hotter, and the longer you wait until it turns on again, the cooler it'll be from its max. 

\- **Grind Size:** This will control a lot. This changes the flow rate, or how FAST you extract your 35 - 45 grams out. If it's too fine, you could choke your machine. If it's too course, you'll be getting a watery sour mess. With very small changes to your grind, you could go from extracting in 5  to 40 seconds. You want it to be in a tighter range around 25 seconds. How course you need to go to achieve that 25 seconds depends on subtle factors like humidity, bean type, bean roast, and bean staleness, and will generally need to change for every new bean you try. 

In summary, tamping, dose and ratio, and temperature are fairly constant. Once you've found something that works, you can stick with them. Grind size, however, needs to be variable for EACH bean AND the same bean as it grows staler. The Encore will have like 2 grind settings for espresso. This is nowhere near enough. 

If you read other posts, you'll find that many people say the grinder is as important or more important than the machine. If you get an Encore, you'll probably be fairly disappointed in what shots you can pull."

I can’t think of a case where holding up a phone would be simpler than just counting, but I’m not very creative."
SelfDrivingCars,fmvh3d8,t1_fms9ci6,1586416754.0,"These are issues with computer vision as a field right now. We’re definitely seeing a saturation in performance with deep learning, but there’s no alternative for the difficulty of the problem. 

Add some unexpected motion blur or any irregular patterns or textures poorly represented in the training data and it’s anyone’s best guess to what the predictions are - deep learning excels at capturing regularities in the training distribution, but irregularities are often the precise cases where there’s a danger. We’d need a significant breakthrough in the field before we have anything stable enough for wide use AVs. 

In terms of SOTA control, perception, and planning research we’re decade(s)+ away from autonomous cars. It’s not a problem that you can just throw money at."
espresso,fmlpnuo,t1_fmlni75,1586190921.0,"From what I’ve read from other posters, American distributors got upset since they were selling it for way below the MSRP in the states. So, they added a USA option that brought it into line with the distributors here. 

They are exactly identical, off the same assembly line, so just pick the 110v option. You can also search for a coupon code that should get you about 10% off."
espresso,fmkkwmp,t1_fmjfi1f,1586158527.0,"Just to note, the flow control kit from Profitec should be compatible with most E61s. Not sure if only Profitec / Bianca was mentioned because of flow profiling, but if so, you could attach the same kit to the Rocket R58 or other E61 DBs. 

I made a thread about it a while back (might’ve deleted it), but espressocoffeeshop has R58s for 2.2k including shipping + tax if you’re in the US."
espresso,fmkjp5j,t1_fmk639z,1586157289.0,"You’ve got to grind way finer if you’re pulling 35 grams in 5 seconds. You should be getting that much out in around 25 seconds, not 5, and that’s impossible to do with a blade grinder. Your grinds won’t be consistent or fine enough. 

Unfortunately, a burr grinder is pretty much non-negotiable. See if you can get one used for a few hundred, otherwise the Eureka Mignon Specialita is the new go-to entry level recommendation (although the Sette 270 is still quite popular). You can find the Eureka for about $425 from [espressocoffeeshop](https://www.espressocoffeeshop.com/Eureka-Mignon-Specialita) (ignore the USA option, just get 110v), and the Sette from any American distributor. There are cheaper burr grinders, but none for espresso; stuff like the Baratza Encore is really only pour-over / press capable. 

As someone who’s stuck with a blade grinder until my Eureka arrives, I understand the pain, but Moka is pretty much all you can do until you have the proper grinder."
espresso,fm6bza0,t3_ftbuyx,1585790713.0,"I found the stock tamper to be a bit small with the stock baskets. The 58.4 barista hustle tamper is better, and I believe both IMS and VST baskets are 58.5mm+, so a 58.5mm tamper would also be good.

Get water, I'm using Crystal Geyser from Olancha, there's a thread [here about what's best.](https://www.home-barista.com/water/best-bottled-water-for-espresso-machine-t51688.html)

Remove the sticker on the group! Also, if you haven't had an E61 before, prepare to burn yourself a decent amount when accidentally touching it while steaming or brewing. Get microfiber cloths and a group brush as the shower screen gets dirty quickly too."
