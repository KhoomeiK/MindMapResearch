UCI,fp69ks9,t3_gbao6z,1588348522.0,"I doubt whoever's grading the exams will even bother to look at the videos, especially if the class isn't tiny (so like more than 20 people).  If I were grading you, you'd get extra points for breaking the monotony."
UCI,fo9d9cn,t3_g5bdxy,1587616394.0,"If you have a general sense of who would be teaching it, you could email them and see when they're planning on offering the course next.  One way to predict when courses will be offered is to just look at the past several years (like 5 or 6) and see what was offered (and by whom).

The philosophy department in particular has already put together their tentative course list for 2020-2021, though it hasn't been placed anywhere super public yet that I can find; you could email the department manager and see if they'd send it to you.  Or else DM me and I can send you list."
UCI,fnfh8xh,t3_g1gebb,1586908005.0,"You can usually do this normally.  But depending on the meeting settings decided by the host, there may be no way to do this (or to copy any messages in the chat for that matter).  I'm pretty sure the relevant setting is the ""Prevent participants from saving chat"" feature."
UCI,fmbtbg1,t3_ftxmcv,1585932826.0,"I would definitely say living on campus is worth it.  Financially, the price you'll pay to live off campus will be almost twice as much as on campus (comparing 2bed 1bath shared b/w 2 people).  If you're worried about noise, I think it's generally pretty quiet; children playing around outside and the occasional dogs fighting at night are really the only disturbances.

I used to live in a 1bed 1bath by myself (though in San Diego) and I'd say that while it was nice not having to share a kitchen, ultimately having an apartmentmate isn't so bad, especially since I have my own room.  The housing workers are also super nice and, in general, respond quickly and effectively to your problems.  The only complaint I'd have would be parking, but parking is awful in most apartment complexes anyway.

The only reason I can think of for living off campus would be if you were living with a non-UCI student (and wanted to be closer to wherever they work) or wanted more of an immediate social life (since there's pretty much nothing in like a 5mi radius around UCI).  But otherwise I feel like the price difference is so great that it swamps out everything else.

Are you entering the MAT program if you're starting (with student teaching and all) in June?"
