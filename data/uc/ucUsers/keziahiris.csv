All of the guidelines for reopening were developed with the assumption that people were now educated on the importance and protocol of wearing PPE and would implement that knowledge in their practices. Going back to normal wasn’t an option, the best we could hope for to maintain some sanity was a careful, sanitized version of life 3 months ago, but with more PPE, physical space, and disinfectants. If all can manage that, then we can all get back to life, but if people ignore it we will continue to battle mass-outbreaks"

People want to help, but no one knows what you need more than you so figuring out how to get help isn’t always going to be easy. But know that there are a lot more people than you realize who want to see you succeed in your life, even many who’ve never met you but can relate to your story. Being first-gen, it can  be hard to see that in universities sometimes, but I promise it’s there."

Taking time to acknowledge and manage emotional and stressful burdens won’t take anything away from your accomplishments, but it will increase the likelihood that you achieve your goals. 

Talk to your professors, talk to counselors and campus resources about getting extensions, pass/fail options, mental health resources. The school invests in those resources for YOU. You don’t have to share more than you’re comfortable with, but asking for help when you need it is part of what it takes to be successful."

AskReddit,fp15z1q,t3_gaku4t,1588225345.0,"I see a lot of helpful “fun fact” sharing that spreads misinformation. Usually it’s not big stuff, but I’ll see people talk about history and throw around inaccuracies or misleading tidbits and it’s not usually in a context that seems worth the effort of fact-checking but over time I’m sure readers will hear things and eventually take them as given truths. Reddit is a fun place to shoot the shit, but it really isn’t a place to get information. Even on the Ask historians sub, which prides itself on this kind of stuff, I’ve seen things posted that would have been shut down in any academic setting. Good to remember reddit is fun for exposure to new concepts, but that we need to turn to more reputable sources to verify before we share anything we’ve picked up here"
AskReddit,foz8oue,t1_foyftrf,1588186537.0,"I don’t get it. I walked out of that film and turned to my friend going “Whoah, that was an absolute waste of my time on this Earth” and my friend had the exact opposite reaction. 

Come on, two years touring with a hit band playing fun music to save up starting capital for your dream club (which is a nostalgia driven, over-done boring concept anyway...) was too much of a hardship, so he quit to... what? Take out massive loans that he’ll spend years repaying? Her life is so hard, but she drives a nice Prius and has supportive family in another state. I’m supposed to feel sympathetic because their dream careers don’t happen overnight?

Also, Jazz is evolving and experimental at its core concept. A movie about a white guy “saving jazz”. Why???

I kinda liked the ending, showing they went their own ways and grew, but it wasn’t enough to salvage the rest of the film for me."

AskWomen,fopt7m7,t3_g8mlxd,1587971340.0,"Period became more irregular, but I realized that hormones had been playing a real number on my mood, making low spots much worse and definitely affecting my relationships. Hormones affect my mood monthly naturally, but off of them there is something more recognizable about what’s happening (like emotionally I feel bad, but in the back of my head there is a logical voice saying “don’t worry, it’s just that time of the month, don’t make any rash decisions for a day or two”), but on them the intense depression could hit more randomly and last longer and harder. 

After a year and a half of exploring the on/off cycles more in-depth (after years of being on it) I decided the mood swings weren’t worth it and just use condoms now. Non-hormonal IUDs are on my wishlist to explore"

Atlanta,fo6z365,t1_fo6pbpd,1587569368.0,"Businesses are being forced into more compromising situations. Even for a pandemic, closing a small business is a hard decision; just because employees are furloughed doesn’t mean all of the other costs of a business vanish. But, businesses could apply for emergency loans and at least keep workers furloughed. With the re-openings, officially there is no reason for them not to be operating, so their eligibility for emergency aid measures is gone, and they’re under pressure to bring back staff, even if it’s a health risk. But clients are unlikely to be back in numbers to support the additional costs, and they are risking COVID-19 exposure to their staff, clients, suppliers, and families. 

Making public health decisions is a heavy burden, and Kemp is deflecting that responsibility onto small business owners rather than on the state (which has the ability to assemble public health experts to make informed decisions, unlike small business owners.)"

Warren_ForPresident,fnn439o,t3_g28ti5,1587083974.0,"It was a “he said”/“she said” thing between Warren and Sanders hyped up by the media. No record of that conversation exists. Maybe Bernie said something trying to make a joke and it got taken wrong. But, I got to say whether it happened or not the fact that the immediate conclusion on many people’s part was to call her a liar felt sexist and unfair and I think she handled it really well trying to turn it into a conversation about sexism in politics, yet she was ironically drowned out by the people taking a man’s word over own with no proof...

But that’s a completely different issue than endorsing Biden right now and I don’t think it’s fair to conflate the two issues. 

Also, at this point Biden seems like a much better candidate than Trump, so endorsing a viable candidate over Trump seems like the right thing for failed democratic candidates to do right now..."
AskReddit,fniviva,t1_fniegnt,1586987100.0,I would also add that being “bitchy” is not an inane character trait; just because you indulge your worst self and do not make active attempts to respect and like other people does not mean that is a part of your character others have to accept.

AskWomen,fngbvkc,t3_g1emvh,1586927600.0,"Definitely. 
Even with shows I like I find myself rolling my eyes and losing interest. Sex is a part of life, but so often it feels like they make female characters one dimensional in order to be “sexy,” which is just boring. Unsurprisingly, I’ve found that the shows that often balance sexy characters of both genders well (giving them depth, personality, and the ability to be attractive in their own way without resorting to a stereotype) often have more female writers and more women involved behind the camera."
AskWomen,fngagb3,t1_fnejehp,1586926459.0,"The point is that you feel uncomfortable. Uncomfortable in your fascination with Nabokov’s mastery of language (that first page!), uncomfortable that you’re seeing the world through the eyes of this obvious sick fuck, uncomfortable that he is succeeding with his awful purpose, uncomfortable that the plot is slow and long and calculated (like long-term abuse). I don’t think it’s a book meant to be “enjoyed”, but it makes you sit back and wonder. There aren’t many books written from the first person narrative where the narrator is such a contemptible, vile person and the contrast between the disgusting nature of the character/ his actions and the flowery language is so weird to reconcile. It’s not pleasant to read, but left me in awe of Nabokov as a writer."

facepalm,fn8xf7q,t1_fn3kkub,1586752881.0,"Look, there are scam artists are all over the place, and there are plenty of homeless people that might tell a lie to get cash. But it’s still pretty presumptive to assume that every homeless person is lying to you only to get drugs. 

Giving to licensed nonprofits is great, and it’s ok to not want to give money to strangers in the street (there are plenty of good reasons not to feel comfortable with this besides not wanting to line an imaginary drug dealer’s pocket) But even if you’ve been burned before, it’s not ok to make blanket assumptions about a total stranger’s condition, circumstances, and motivation. 

I’ve met people masquerading as homeless people that were scam artists, and other actual homeless people that were just really, honestly down on their luck and in a bad situation. We can’t know a stranger’s whole story, and the world would be a lot worse if we always assumed the worst of everyone around us."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fn76ae7,t3_fzr724,1586714121.0,"A recipe that is fairly simple, but I get raving reviews on from friends is below:
Sweet potato and kale
1. Peel the sweet potato and cube. Toss the cubes with olive oil, salt, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and fresh herbs if you have them (I like rosemary best for this) spread on baking sheet and put in the oven until tender
2. Take kale and read into bite-size ish portions. Make a little bowlful of mixture containing mustard, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper. Rub the mix into the kale leaves (kale changes flavor when rubbed and its structure a little broken, losing some bitterness) 
3. Put kale on a different baking sheet and bake until just crispy ( keep an eye out, if goes from crispy to burnt fast) 
4. Toss together kale and sweet potatoes. Add a little Parmesan 

For added fun you can also add nuts ( pecans go well) or tahini drizzle"

AskWomen,fmgqvmi,t3_fuu6sw,1586055441.0,"I made a few “rules” for myself early on to make both shopping and assembling outfits easier. They are rules based on my body and my taste, so they aren’t going to be exactly right for anyone else, but they help me keep things polished with fairly minimal effort. Here are just some:

1. Black pants all day, every day. Lots of skinny black jeans. Black formal pants. Black pants that can be formal or informal. Only exceptions to the color black must be dark, and cannot be purchases unless I have identified at least 3 tops that I already own that I know will work
2. Color palette that looks good on me and makes me feel good
3. No floral prints
4. High quality cardigans (remember quality and price are not synonymous and thrift shops in nice areas are your friends)
5.  No white tops and definitely no white pants (hard to keep clean)
6. Buy clothes that fit and flatter YOUR body
7. A nice blazer or coat elevates the rest of your look
8. Choose shoes that help you love in a way that feels natural and powerful (if it pinches, is too clunky, makes you feel like you got elephant trunks, or you slide around too much, are you going to walk into an important meeting feeling your best?) 
9. Good clothing can be both practical and flattering. I love utility; good pockets, can be worn in layers, not high maintenance materials. Shoes that one can walk in for a while 
10. Jewelry compliments a look, but does not distract viewers"
