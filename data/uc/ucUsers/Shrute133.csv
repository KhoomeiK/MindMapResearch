The soundtrack and intro made my 10-year-old self feel genuine sadness for the first time ever watching a movie. It was the most bittersweet feeling to my soul when Carl realized Ellie never needed to see South America for all her dreams to come true because she was fulfilled by their life together already. It was like the most realistic and raw emotion I’d ever watched on television up till that point in my life. Still tugs at my heartstrings now too, 10 years later, but I haven’t cried for a movie in a while"

MakeupAddiction,fn1rv7c,t1_fn1qgdi,1586568658.0,Oh wow I’m rly excited to hear that it worked! How many bottles of the serum would u recommend? Their FAQ says 1 bottle lasts about 1-2 months. Also when can u stop applying the serum or do u still have to continue even after it’s grown?
MakeupAddiction,fn1o7pk,t3_fyd9cw,1586566288.0,"Does anyone have any experience with eyelash growth serums? I got an ad for a brand called ForLash which seems to have great reviews on their website, but idk how reliable those are. I’m wondering if they actually make your lashes grow thicker/longer"
femalehairadvice,fmvm35m,t3_fxhxhe,1586421989.0,I think darker would complement your skin tone better. Side note: you got some pearly whites there!!
