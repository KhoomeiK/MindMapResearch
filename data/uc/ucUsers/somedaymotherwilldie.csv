Edit: sorry I just reread your comment and it makes even less sense to me. Why is trump wondering if we could put “disinfectant “ (which I’ll be fair and not interpret as bleach) inside people a good thing?

Here’s an idea: if You say something and a lot of people think you’re serious, maybe you’re just not a good public speaker?

In the office of Presidency there's the assumption that your top priority is the USA, someone with ties to another country, say, lots of financial assets, poses a bit of a conflict of interest. 

>Are you sure? Wouldn't that president be beholden to the teachings of the Quran, which would put the Islamic nation above all others?

Are you sure? Was Obama/Trump/literally every president Beholden to the teachings of the Bible? which put the Christian faith above all other things? We have lots of US politicians who want the Christian faith to be more important in the US (these people denied Gays the right to marry becuase of the bible, protest abortion because of the Bible, and want to teach ""alternative science"" that says the world is 6000 years old), if these people are allowed to be politicians, why can't a muslim?

>That assumes he's aware of these interferences. Would you say Clinton/the Clintons had few to no vested interests with Russia?

I believe I'm in /r/asktrumpsupporters, I don't know much about the clintons, sorry. But how can you NOT be aware of your financial assets being tied up in an other country?

>And finally, again asserting Obama was a Muslim for the purposes of point/counterpoint isn't in itself racist, considering 1) Islam is a religion not a race and 2) as just stated, it was not meant in a demeaning manner, rather a comparison of logic

It's racist because the conspiracy that Obama being muslim only exists because Obama is black lol. No other president had their faith questioned like Obama (at least in the sense that they've been called Muslims when they're clearly christians), no other president has had conspiracies that they were born in a different continent. 

yes it was brought up to compare the two lines of reasoning, but he turned a line of reasoning about someone's loyalty into validating a racist conspiracy. Here's a better example of what I mean:

Person 1: Trump is bad because he golfs!

Person 2: Obama is bad because he golfs! Now do you see the fault in your logic?

That's what the OP was TRYING to do ^ Here's what he actually did:

Person 1: Trump is bad because he golfs!

Person 2: Obama is bad because he's muslim! Now do you see the fault in your logic?

Well, those two aren't really comparable, and Obama's not a muslim, so.... no?

Does that make sense?"

Judging someone on who they are *nationally* loyal to, however, is very different. A president who loves America and the Islamic faith has no conflict of interests. A president who has very vested ties into another state that is interfering with our elections *does * have conflict of interest. Does that make sense? (And I want To reiterate: Obama being a Muslim is not true, and comes from racists who want a reason to hate him, as if hating someone for being Muslim is even close to acceptable)"
betterCallSaul,fo5jldo,t3_g5r95m,1587527234.0,"I have a theory that Kim is more responsible for Jimmy being saul than Chuck is. A lot of viewers, myself included, have looked at Chuck as the reason for a lot of Jimmy's problems. I mean it this way:

Chuck has routinely spoken about how Jimmy ""can't help himself"", he treats Jimmy more as an addict who may start drinking again (""I know what this looks like but I'm not slippin' jimmy!""), and in many ways, Chuck acts as his sponsor. (Working under Chuck's surveillance, Jimmy takes care of his brother by delivering him stuff each day, works as a public defender, and is living a pretty clean lifestyle, albeit a bit of a shitty one) Kim, on the other hand, has not provided Jimmy a means to escape his addiction. Jimmy's willing to change his field of law to work with her, wants to do things right with her, but she prefers to be on her own and keep jimmy separate (not passing judgement on her decision to do that), but what is an addict going to do without a sponsor? Without a person to appeal to? They might just start drinking again. 

When Jimmy and Kim take down Chuck in Chicanery, she says ""I can't help but feel like we just hurt a sick person"" (or something to that extent), in my opinion, BCS's main season 6 theme will be that Kim had been hurting Jimmy the entire time, and NOT that Jimmy has been a drain on Kim's life. I don't think that Kim has done this out of malice or ill-intent, but she too has a craving for scams, schemes, and shadier things. As many have said, she's grown a taste for it, and Jimmy is her means of getting it. She's facilitating Jimmy's addiction for cheap laughs and thrills. She's willing to laugh off destroying someone's car with bowling balls because to her its not a big deal. How would Chuck have handled Jimmy throwing bowling balls? You might argue a lot of things about Chuck, but in my opinion a ""Big Brother"" figure who would yell and chew you out for doing something destructive is a lot better than a ""Best friend"" one who would laugh and egg you on to do it. IN fact, this has basically been a recurring episode plot on any family sitcom for decades (The younger sibling does something wrong and the brother forgives him at the end), except in this story, Chuck doesn't clean up Jimmy's mess at the end. 

And yes, Jimmy is very much responsible for his own actions. Any shit that Kim gets into with him is just as much his fault as hers, but think about it this way: If you knew your friend was addicted to drinking, and you let them drink and you got in a car wreck with them after drunk driving, who do you think deserves a bigger share of the blame? That's not a really easy question, different people might answer differently, depending on who they are, but I think this will be the big question BCS leaves us at the end. Who could Jimmy have been if he had better guidance? What if Chuck hadn't passed away? What if Kim had just said ""no!""? What if someone had just stopped him at one point? 

Final thing to consider: In a Season 4 ep pre-intro (I can't remember which, the one where saul collects oscar predictions) It's heavily implied saul becomes a lawyer for Kim, not Chuck. Look where all the troubles involving saul have come from: him being a lawyer. He might have been working harmlessly in the mail room his whole life if she hadn't been there with him"
SubredditDrama,fnxqs4e,t1_fnwq6yl,1587344386.0,"Howard is by ALL means a good guy.  You can argue he was in the wrong because he let a good person not get the chance he deserved, but remember:
1. His partner, and long time friend, did not want Jimmy
2. The dispute between Jimmy and Chuck is family business, I doubt Howard would feel it his place to step in between Chuck and Jimmy. He probably heard lots of stories about Jimmy (who, remember *did not have a good background*) from Chuck, and despite seeing a hardworking go getter, trusted chucks Judgement
3. Howard also didn't do anything that was really morally objectionable throughout the series, and when he did, expressed clear guilt and heartbreak over it. A (perfectly valid) dispute between him and Chuck? He gets insomnia and breaks down over it, undergoes months of therapy, and still has the graces to Forgive Jimmy for everything thats happened between them and offer him a Job.

One of the bigger themes of the show is that the way a situation is presented is not the entire story. Jimmy isn't a reliable narrator throughout most of the show, as seen by the revelation in Season 1 that Howard doesn't actually hate Jimmy, he's just doing by his friends wishes. Chuck is by all means respected and revered in the community, and its only through knowing his relationship with his brother that we understand truly who Chuck is, and his flaws, and strengths, as a person. Imagine just seeing Chuck in a show as everyone else sees him. A purely good force of Law in the world, who came down with a ""rare disorder"" (or, if you know the truth, is experiencing mental problems). Framed that way, Chuck appears to be a tragic character, Framed from Jimmy's point of view, we see Chuck as an insurmountable object in Jimmy's way, never able to gain his respect and trust, always judging, and even in death hanging over him and every action he takes. Chuck appears to be a bad guy in Jimmy's life, hell, even his letter he left jimmy can bring some (Kim) to tears as being a heartfelt letter of things he couldn't say to his brother, and some (Jimmy) to see it as nothing more than polite words soaked with contempt. You need to really analyze every facet, and the full context, of someones actions in this show to really understand a character and to judge them.

That's why I totally think Howard is a good guy, despite some of the negative framing the show has.

Yes I did just write a whole ass comment in defense of Howard, but damn Im hyped for the finale tomorrow"

AskTrumpSupporters,fntsiwb,t1_fnt7kxd,1587247824.0,"My issue with your comparison to Nazi Germany is that you're comparing the systematic efforts of a government to steal from, intimidate, and to **murder** millions of Innocent people to trivial restrictions on shopping for non-essential items that are designed with the intent to keep citizens alive and healthy.

You can argue that these policies are innapropriate, reach too far, etc etc. but to say that it is a step forward into Nazi Germany is like a doctor saying to you, ""I am not going to sign off on you climbing mount Everest, I think you may not have the respiratory function necessary to do so, sorry."" and you to say ""Wow, Doctor, I didn't realize you think I'm subhuman because of my ethnicity and you want to murder me, my family, and everyone I've associated with over the past year.""

You can argue the doctors wrong, but to compare him looking out for your health as him wanting to ethnically cleanse you is inappropriate and offensive, do you understand?

This must also be stated: the protection is (mostly) not for you, it is for the employees who work at the store. They are the ones working right now, you are not. They have every right to feel protected while doing ""essential"" business, which appears to be selling gardening equipment. I'm sure most of them would prefer to be at home, and not working to deliver people things they could live without, but since you are insisting on your right to purchase said equipment, the government should do its part to protect those who fufill your wishes.
