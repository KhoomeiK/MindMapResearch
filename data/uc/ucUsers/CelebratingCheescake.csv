u_CelebratingCheescake,fo2f7y0,t3_fg32yi,1587460118.0,"I‚Äôm behind on my school work and I miss being loved. I learned more about myself which fucking sucks to be honest. I‚Äôm sorry if I ever scared u away. I realized how much I lack. I wish I treated u better, I wish we were still together. But I don‚Äôt want to be hurt again. If only we could go back. I would have done a lot better. Would you too? 
I hate living like I‚Äôm the only one who messed up. I know you lied to me. I know u treated me wrong. But I always fall back and make an excuse for u. Why am I still in love w u. You are selfish and lazy. You‚Äôre grumpy and follow your emotions blindly. I hope you never read this."
BreakUps,fo26i3u,t3_g58if1,1587451281.0,"I can feel your pain and I‚Äôm so sorry. When my ex left me, it was when I needed her the most as well. When she broke up with me, I was so in shock that I didn‚Äôt feel the pain immediately. But ofc it came to me and now I‚Äôm hurting every day."
BreakUps,fnxhs3l,t3_g4h3mo,1587338902.0,I understand the jealousy. I was so mad when I found about what my ex was doing. I just tried not to check her social media and just forget about her. Ofc it‚Äôs hard and you fuck up all the time but time is the only thing that really helps you heal.
u_CelebratingCheescake,fnxhjc3,t3_fg32yi,1587338758.0,I miss you as a person. I also miss the relationship we had. One day I‚Äôll stop missing you and just miss the relationship. Then I hope that I can find someone who actually loves me.
