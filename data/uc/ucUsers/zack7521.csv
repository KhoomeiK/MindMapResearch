yep, means you just gotta work harder all the time. no way around it.

> lack of social life. I’m definitely a work hard - play hard person and want to enjoy my college experience.

Grad school is different. UChicago is fantastic for many things in math, many overlapping with CS. Berkeley is also fantastic in many areas of both CS and math. I'll say this as a math/CS major here: you're somewhat limited to a few areas of each. Berkeley is close to the best at them, but if you're not sure, you won't get to explore much.

If I had to make a strict judgment, I'd say go to UChicago if you're leaning on the math side, and here if you're on the CS side. You'll see a bit of ML, algos, security and all the mathy CS areas, but in math, there's a few areas with almost no representation here (to be fair, most of them aren't too CS heavy)."

There's this mathematical concept called the Condorcet condition which says if if most voters prefer candidate A to candidate B, then candidate A wins the election.

We don't have that in the US. If 30% of the population has preferences A>B>C, 30% B>A>C, and 40% C>B>A, then 60% of the population does not want C. So A and B both appeal to people more than C, yet lose to C.

The fact is that in the US, ideologically similar parties only hurt each other."
