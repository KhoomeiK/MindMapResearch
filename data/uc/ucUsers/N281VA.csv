Of course -- my firm has seen the same. 

Consider letting someone go on a Tuesday vs a Friday. The person let go on Tuesday leaves awkwardly in the middle of the week -- everyone knows he was fired. He further has to explain to family/friends/etc (usually on Wednesday) that he's now unemployed. Whether he says it or not, they'll all assume he was dinged. Letting someone go on a Tuesday inflicts all sorts of social harm to the person you're letting go, and that leads to resentment and a desire to ""hurt"" the company with an incident (lawsuit, public shaming, sabotaging, etc.). Of course we know that efforts to hurt the firm will be futile, but its better for everyone (employee, company) to avoid this.

The person you let go on a Friday will still be somewhat annoyed, but they dont have to deal with the stigma from family and friends (and often, themselves) of getting fired mid-week. They can simply tell others they left on Friday, and make up whatever story best suits them. Because they face far less social harm, they in turn have way less desire to ""harm"" the firm.

Basic advice -- always let people go with dignity. Do it on a Friday. Exceptions, perhaps, only for the most egregious conduct issues -- not ones pertaining to competence by ones pertaining to character.  Doing drugs at a client site? Out that day. But truly most performance-related issues can easily wait until Friday."

Don’t be frivolous, and you shouldn’t have issues!"
