westworld,fpn0on6,t1_fpmoviz,1588746763.0,Yeah.
InsecureHBO,fpn0mzc,t1_fpmv5e4,1588746725.0,"If you like my taste in TV, maybe watch You’re The Worst, too. It’s on Hulu and it’s my most favorite show."
sexandthecity,fpn0hpc,t1_fpmsapk,1588746606.0,She’s the absolute worst!
sexandthecity,fpmmjaj,t1_fplr615,1588736403.0,Or they’re shows about flawed people and people discuss those flaws?
sexandthecity,fpml41h,t1_fpljj7a,1588735479.0,That GoT finale tho...
sexandthecity,fpml0qv,t1_fpm8yfk,1588735421.0,"She was okay the first season, but the show pretty quickly got to be too much, along with Nancy."
sexandthecity,fpmku1y,t1_fpl5el7,1588735303.0,"I will say some of my favorite shows I hate some of the characters. Similar to SATC, I love Girls but hate Hannah."
ANTM,fpmja38,t3_geb3gj,1588734300.0,"Apparently the agency wanted an androgynous model (they usually have model archetypes they like having on hand, so they were trying to fill that one). If you look at Brittani/Britt’s post show work a lot of it is a lot more boyish than what she did on the show.

That being said, I like this cut on Brittani more than her dutchboy cut. They gave her a completely different style for the majority of her photo shoots anyway.

I like Molly’s but wish they hadn’t left the back so blunt. I like the long bang but wish they had cleaned the back up."
ANTM,fpm56bs,t3_ge7psi,1588725787.0,"The Nigel and April thing made me uncomfortable because he was married to a woman who looked exactly like her, it’s like a confirmation it was just misinterpreting his actions."
ANTM,fpm35kj,t3_ge7w1b,1588724606.0,"Did I think she got a bad edit? Yes. Do I think the other girls were a little unnecessarily mean to her? Also yes. That being said, yeah I thought she was unlikeable and a know it all, and she’s still super bitter over her loss. I also was super turned off with how she reacted to Melrose stepping on and ripping her dress. She didn’t mean to do it, accidents happen, it’s not like she was the designer or would be penalized for Cari’s mistake."
westworld,fpm0rpz,t1_fpm0die,1588723222.0,Same! I was about the age of her character when it came out. It blew me away that this movie I saw over a decade and a half ago had her in it and I never realized.
KUWTK,fplz5x9,t1_fplytdy,1588722313.0,"I saw that! All the encouraging messages followed by “things I tell my daughter.” I think she’s a great mom, I hate all the comments implying she’s not just because she’s the only one willing to share some of her parenting struggles."
KUWTK,fplx0ls,t3_ge6g5t,1588721103.0,Kourt is the only one I can stand to follow.
KUWTK,fplwys3,t1_fplrlm0,1588721074.0,"Nope no dirt there her stories are literally just more ads, it’s 100 skins posts, 20 KKW, and 20 perfume."
ANTM,fplvuba,t1_fplucku,1588720456.0,"Again, I don’t agree with the way they treated her, but you don’t think being selfish is a negative quality?"
westworld,fpltu1d,t1_fplqkez,1588719352.0,"Yup, I had the same reaction, like holy shit I had no idea but now that I think of it, obviously that was her."
westworld,fpln4rz,t1_fpllj7k,1588715733.0,No the movie Thirteen.
ANTM,fplf211,t1_fpl8z1y,1588711558.0,8 white girls is racial diversity to you?
westworld,fpleh1s,t1_fpldq5x,1588711259.0,Neat!
ANTM,fpl5ikb,t3_gdxgv0,1588706736.0,"To be fair, Bre and Nicole squashes their beef on the show."
ANTM,fpl3r3o,t1_fpkwahl,1588705838.0,"I don’t support the way the other girls treated her during the show, but I will say, if every other person in the house dislikes you, maybe there’s a kernel of truth in it."
ANTM,fpl39iw,t3_ge2y0y,1588705595.0,Why did you make me see this photo of Marvin.
ANTM,fpl364z,t3_ge33qn,1588705548.0,"Nope and Sarah from C4.

Edit I meant Noelle but I’m leaving it."
KUWTK,fpl30ci,t1_fpkl7lf,1588705468.0,"Sorry I go off of what they say on the show, “Christmas is just around the corner”, and don’t scour what they say on Twitter."
westworld,fpl2o2g,t1_fpkh5ct,1588705294.0,"Because if ERW gets injured, production on the show completely stops for however long it takes for her to heal and costs a lot more money."
westworld,fpl2evo,t1_fpkaetc,1588705169.0,"To be fair, it’s not her fault the fight choreography was terrible."
westworld,fpl1sr6,t1_fpkr3j6,1588704866.0,"AND AND she was in Thirteen! I had a friend tell me this recently, as I didn’t know, and I was like holy shit that was her, huh??"
ANTM,fpl0v9u,t3_ge155m,1588704405.0,This is absolutely fantastic! You’re very talented. What kind of camera do you use?
westworld,fpisiha,t1_fpiqwfn,1588647724.0,Original gangster.
KUWTK,fpir4h0,t1_fpipz2o,1588646852.0,I agree! That’s why she throws out little comments about her being the least exciting to look at. She’s insecure her 40 year old sister looks way better than her.
ANTM,fpiph5h,t3_gdowm2,1588645836.0,Justice for my girl Naima!!
ANTM,fpipc3h,t3_gdpb8d,1588645747.0,Excuse me Shei’s hair was phenom.
KUWTK,fpimn4v,t3_gdmjuo,1588644082.0,"I... don’t love the concept of this photo shoot, and this just makes it worse."
KUWTK,fpijy54,t1_fpih9hu,1588642464.0,"Pretty sure I’ve read Anna Wintour feels that way, can’t find a source tho."
KUWTK,fpi5bxv,t3_gdlavn,1588633967.0,"Yeah it’s pretty cringey. I’ve seen other people mention the same before, people are not fans of the baby voice. The candy video she does using it is awk."
KUWTK,fpi4xt1,t1_fpi2yly,1588633742.0,She dresses kinda tackily and is too c-list.
ANTM,fphfr8p,t1_fphdjg8,1588620494.0,She’s got that ramen noodle hair action going.
KUWTK,fphccpf,t1_fphc5s0,1588618753.0,That’s too bad to hear. It actually helps with my anxiety! But I’m borderline agoraphobic so if I could do everything from my house I would.
ANTM,fph78uh,t3_gdg8v3,1588616200.0,Love Leslie C6 but her walk was as useless as flashlight in the dark with no batteries.
KUWTK,fph63ha,t1_fph58xu,1588615619.0,Pretty sure Kourt is the exception to this. She was   very negatively affected by Kris cheating on their father.
KUWTK,fph4lzy,t1_fph3mky,1588614873.0,Are you not able to have telehealth appointments with your therapist?
AskReddit,fph3692,t1_fpeeu2z,1588614148.0,That’s also effectively the plot of Childhood’s End.
femalefashionadvice,fph1kk8,t1_fpele5b,1588613341.0,That dark eye is demon fodder.
ANTM,fph0ess,t1_fph04zq,1588612755.0,"I see. I’ve only ever seen the clip of her getting eliminated and Tyra talking about her body of SELF and she didn’t seem that bad, but I guess i need to watch the season itself."
ANTM,fpgzmcr,t1_fpgyyhd,1588612351.0,You’ve never heard anyone say Fatima was someone who should have won her cycle?
LateStageCapitalism,fpgzbsd,t1_fpgy3fs,1588612201.0,Golf is the most boring sport played by the most boring people.
ANTM,fpgyw88,t1_fpgm4zz,1588611975.0,"People say that about Fatima, for instance, all the time, despite having a so-so portfolio with a couple of standout shots."
ANTM,fpgyesa,t3_gddzcy,1588611726.0,Janice walked with “zip it bitch you’re dead in my book” so Shalynda could run with “shut up bitch you’re dead in my book.”
ANTM,fpgy6l7,t3_gdexnu,1588611612.0,"Love Wholahay, but she really made a big deal out of nothing. Why was she so bothered? Who cares if two random girls fight and then make up and then fight again a week later? It has nothing to do with you. Really wasn’t any of her business."
KUWTK,fpgvptj,t3_gd50a0,1588610363.0,"I feel like Kim is super competitive with Kourt. She’s constantly putting her down, whether it’s style or parenting or looks. Especially now that they’re getting older and Kourt looks the best out of all of them. You could tell from the episode where they all dressed up as each other, everyone else was light hearted but Kim’s just felt mean spirited. Kendall’s had a bit of meanness, too, I think ever since Kylie overshadowed her she feels some amount of competitiveness too."
KUWTK,fpgvew9,t1_fpgtxzu,1588610210.0,Lately I haven’t even seen the odd post. I thought maybe since the lockdown shed open up a bit more but it seems like she’s doubled down. The closest thing she’s posted that was actual content was her posting the videos where North crashes and that was almost a month ago.
KUWTK,fpgtt1b,t1_fpgmsrx,1588609386.0,"It’s ALL Kim posts anymore, it’s so bland. It makes her harping on Kourt for not sharing enough all the more frustrating."
ANTM,fpgtein,t1_fpf8gof,1588609175.0,Whaaat? Source?
ANTM,fpgt1tl,t1_fpgr7fm,1588608994.0,Whew that’s a spicy hot take.
ANTM,fpgsb6c,t1_fpf9qc1,1588608609.0,Perfect example: giving Kendall C15 Vivienne Wang for the designer photo shoot.
ANTM,fpgrx6e,t1_fpg79o3,1588608406.0,Jay’s Facebook page.
ANTM,fpgqw21,t1_fpg3hmn,1588607868.0,Maybe something like C4 Keenyah?
ANTM,fpgqr9z,t3_gd68n4,1588607799.0,"Unfortunately, Anya didn’t do much modeling after C10. But hopefully she’s happy and living her best life despite that!"
ANTM,fpgqic8,t3_gd72ad,1588607672.0,She was funny but obnoxious tbh.
ANTM,fpgp0sp,t1_fpg9olc,1588606908.0,"Michelle C4 was definitely the worst, especially once her roots started growing in."
ANTM,fpgl5ls,t1_fpgeal4,1588604840.0,"I’ve never seen C24, what was so bad about her?"
ANTM,fpfe8be,t1_fpfe10u,1588568675.0,"I’m sorry, do you mean Sharaun? Because she IS America’s Next Top Model."
sexandthecity,fpfe4kh,t3_gcz10s,1588568590.0,"I see Broad City, which is great, mentioned here, but I don’t see Girls. They’re less likable but it’s still good. Insecure is also a really great show about female relationships.

I also always look for a reason to plug my favorite show, even if it’s not super similar to SATC, but You’re the Worst is great."
sexandthecity,fpfdqi5,t1_fpeccpk,1588568279.0,I feel like Broad City or Girls is a more realistic look at NYC life.
ANTM,fpfaqy6,t1_fpfa8nq,1588565965.0,"We did it, Reddit. We cracked the case."
ANTM,fpfa0wp,t1_fpf9sga,1588565438.0,Alright. I’ve figured it out. It’s Whitney. We need Whitney to win a high fashion cycle of ANTM.
ANTM,fpf9vb9,t1_fpf9cvf,1588565323.0,"I really didn’t like Kayla’s either, but Ann’s might be my least favorite. It was truly ugly."
ANTM,fpf9pab,t1_fpf9eom,1588565203.0,"I’m sorry, are you talking about Kathy from C6?"
ANTM,fpf93nw,t1_fpf8qhf,1588564777.0,"Listen, we’re all talking about C4’s Noelle and we all know it."
ANTM,fpf90hg,t1_fpf8vu9,1588564716.0,"True, Jane is an example that looks kind of dated but still good."
ANTM,fpf8moo,t1_fpf85eh,1588564449.0,"Ah I figured it out, you’re talking about Bethany. Maybe they would stop focusing on her boobs in a high fashion cycle and start focusing on the talent."
ANTM,fpf7z4l,t1_fpf7ix1,1588563987.0,"Agreed. I was really disappointed with C15’s shoots, they mostly seemed like regular ANTM shoots, but C16’s were FIRE."
ANTM,fpf7wch,t1_fpf7hrp,1588563932.0,"No, I’m sure you actually meant Tahlia."
ANTM,fpf77yd,t1_fpf61wg,1588563461.0,Surely you mean C11 Hannah?
ANTM,fpf57ym,t3_gd3izz,1588562081.0,"I agree on C15, but you really thought the girls of C16 produced mediocre shots? I thought they were one of, if not the, best cast of the show."
westworld,fpey2f5,t1_fpew686,1588557425.0,There’s only three seasons.
westworld,fpespxf,t1_fpelfb9,1588554123.0,Remember when Gmail came out and offered 1 gig of data for FREE? It was a wild concept.
ANTM,fperh94,t1_fpefpbb,1588553377.0,"Naima, too, she looks great."
ANTM,fper9qf,t1_fpelv57,1588553251.0,"Came here to say this, Kelly Cutrone is a nobody lol. On another thread a while ago, someone mentioned that she was running shows on The Hills, too, to imply she was a big shot. Fashion looks way down on reality television, being on a show says literally nothing about your fashion credentials ."
KUWTK,fpekggw,t3_gd0pnb,1588549278.0,"You’re right about Kendall and Kourtney, but Kim gets fun of all the time."
KUWTK,fpeaznf,t3_gcxzvp,1588543911.0,"I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s not even someone they know very well, just a random fellow celebrity that makes them realize that they could get it too, not just us plebes. Kinda how everyone was posting tributes to Kobe after he passed. Everyone in Hollywood is kinda connected."
ANTM,fpeaoi9,t1_fpe6olt,1588543733.0,Michelle’s lack of ability to pronounce feminine was hilarious.
ANTM,fpeajnx,t3_gcwudy,1588543655.0,I’m... really surprised Rebecca is winning.
ANTM,fpeafj5,t3_gcx0gu,1588543589.0,"I love Ginselle’s shot, I think it’s massively  underrated."
westworld,fpe736l,t1_fpe2rm4,1588541663.0,Ugh this is too true.
westworld,fpe6fwr,t1_fpe1z0p,1588541295.0,"Idk, if there are some breakthroughs in quantum computing technology, we could see some crazy shit happen pretty fast. Sure, we don’t have flying cars, but if someone told you in the 90’s that most people would have a supercomputer with more processing power than the one that sent the first man to the moon in a compact case you can carry in your pocket, you wouldn’t have believed it."
madmen,fpe5wvq,t1_fpe0t4o,1588540990.0,"No offense, but this is one of the most highly acclaimed shows on TV, who are these people who are under appreciating it?"
ANTM,fpe5p7x,t1_fpe5bd0,1588540867.0,"Fair enough. I thought all the shots other than the CG weren’t bad tho, tbh, but agree to disagree."
KUWTK,fpe3146,t1_fpdahrn,1588539352.0,"I just watched it and there’s this one moment on the bike where it looks like they’re actually having sex, and he says a lyric about wanting to fuck you or something, it was super awk.

Also, this is the man that doesn’t want his wife to be too sexy, everybody!"
ANTM,fpe2ki9,t1_fpe2haa,1588539091.0,It’s true. MIA FAR-ROW from *Rose*mary’s *Baby*.
ANTM,fpe2co1,t1_fpe224n,1588538969.0,Well I’m gonna get my Mia farrow haircut today ON YOU.
ANTM,fpe267b,t1_fpdlck2,1588538870.0,"That’s wild, I thought she did great other than her walk and CG photo."
ANTM,fpdxypr,t3_gcwjw5,1588536472.0,C5 just for Bre’s sensuous reading followed by “I hate chocolate.”
KUWTK,fpduqy4,t1_fpcfzni,1588534635.0,"Holy shit! I love the shoes! And I love that the sleeve parts go all the way to the ground, it’s so dramatic. She really does have the best style."
ANTM,fpdsws3,t1_fpdrq2d,1588533572.0,"Yeah I got the photographer wrong, I fixed it. I dunno, maybe it was just the era but I just really hated it then and hate it now. Like I know people love Ann’s shot but I just can’t with her outfit."
ANTM,fpdsqjb,t1_fpds1b0,1588533471.0,"You’re totally right, I didn’t bother to double check. I remember Chelsea being super excited about Patrick Demarchelier."
KUWTK,fpdsh08,t1_fpd3dvm,1588533320.0,And then she started filling her top lip to counteract it and it just looks so weird to me.
ANTM,fpdrfrd,t3_gcm7g8,1588532724.0,"This was one of the shots of Ann I actually kind of liked, but the more I look at it, the less I like it. She seemed like a nice girl but I just do not get the hype."
ANTM,fpdr53w,t1_fpcazwc,1588532555.0,They had world class photographers and then used them for terrible photo shoots. Matthew Ralston’s horrible underwater mess. ~~Steven Miesel’s~~ Patrick Demarchelier Rodeo Drive shoot could have been okay but then they got the stylist from hell that was obviously mad at all the girls except maybe Chris and Kendall. Such a waste.
ANTM,fpdqq36,t1_fpcatql,1588532317.0,I know he tweeted some conspiracy nonsense about coronavirus recently.
