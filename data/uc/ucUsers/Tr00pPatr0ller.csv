As far as when, it just depends on where the ""red tide"" algae bloom is.  That's not predictable.  If you go during the day and see the red algae, then most likely it will be there at night.  Depends on tides and stuff.  Doesn't matter the time just as long as it's dark."

Dear  ,

As a campus, we take great pride in providing a wonderful student  housing experience for our students, and, under normal circumstances,  offering guarantees for this housing to a large percentage of our  student body. However, it is not possible for us to know at this time  whether the current public health crisis will allow us to maintain  normal operations in student housing and residential life when the fall  quarter begins. **Consequently, we are not offering a housing guarantee at this time.**

We are committed to having students on campus to the maximum extent  possible. But, it will be some time before we know more precisely how  many students we can safely accommodate in our housing units. Additional  information will be provided by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions  as we have more to report. For more information about this, as well as  other expected changes for fall 2020 as they are determined, please  visit [our FAQ page here](https://mx.technolutions.net/mps2/c/FAE/jM0HAA/t.315/QQAc43g-R2KJFb2K9g2w2g/h0/QcYjMniuu2fLKtrHRHnZcE45-2BJT1pUEgJBGaMWg9p7uIrbbP3fgV-2BL8OeHHkFI4G/sn3H).

If you submitted a statement of intent to register, we hope that you  will continue to be our partners in making your educational experience  the best it can be while helping to ensure your continued good health  and the health of our community. If this new information about the  housing guarantee causes you to reconsider your decision, please reach  out to us and we will work with you.

You can speak directly with a representative using the live chat feature on our website, [admissions.uci.edu](https://mx.technolutions.net/mps2/c/FAE/jM0HAA/t.315/QQAc43g-R2KJFb2K9g2w2g/h1/QcYjMniuu2fLKtrHRHnZcLPFe-2Bs4bAVI4ZjDXh-2F-2BYK4-3D/PgqN). Our staff is available Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. to answer questions directly.

The following link below is confusing as they are not clear as to WHO is eligible to take the exam and WHEN.  **This webpage was last updated in 2018**!!!  

 

**Who is eligible to can take the credit by exam?**

&#x200B;

* *This summer, only new ICS and CSE majors may take these exams.*  
 
* All other new students may take these exams beginning Fall quarter.  Non-ICS majors may only take these exams in their first year at UCI.  
 
* ICS majors may only take the ICS 31, ICS 45C, and ICS 45J credit by exams prior to matriculation.  
  
   * The credit by exam is intended for incoming student populations. The credit by exam is **not** intended for current students to bypass UCI requirements and/or restrictions.  .
