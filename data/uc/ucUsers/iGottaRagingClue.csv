Judaism,fpm1m05,t1_fpkbzuv,1588723708.0,I totally agree with you about that. I find the term Old testament not only theologically incorrect but insulting to Jews. I did that only out of habit/convention

LeftWithoutEdge,fpi09yh,t1_fn151nb,1588631142.0,So you prefer to act in a way that gets Trump re-elected. You like seeing Mike Pompeo and Steve Mnuchin continue to run things for another 4 years. Okay. Very “leftist” of you
LeftWithoutEdge,fpi05vc,t1_fn29t33,1588631080.0,Except on almost every single issue Biden is better than Trump. You’re saying you would rather have far right SCOTUS justices than moderates? That you would rather have a president who has never read a book in his life have access to the nuclear codes? Why can’t people do nuance.
LeftWithoutEdge,fpi00ev,t3_fyib4w,1588630995.0,"So, is this implicitly excusing people who refuse to engage in politics? Voting by mail has made it very easy, and if anything we should have more of a stigma around non-voters, not patronizingly excusing them because they’re “poor” or “uneducated”."
Physics,fphgcki,t1_fowi8j0,1588620795.0,Does this explain why you can have an infinite amount of bosons in the same quantum state though???
Physics,fphg609,t3_g9mvd2,1588620704.0,"I heard someone say on a podcast that as beauty quarks move through space, due to quantum mechanics they “oscillate between matter and anti-matter”.

surfing,fpaw8a1,t1_fpaddcy,1588457002.0,"Right, but the point is the risk is extremely low. Why would we take extreme measures to prevent transmission while other people are having house parties, etc? Like people worried about walking outside because they might pass someone who has it — thats just dumb. Japan & S Korea stopped it because they have actual isolation for sick people not household isolation, and they aren’t using this as a vacation to hang out with friends, there’s a strong social stigma. Yet their beaches and parks are open."
stupidpol,fpa7so7,t1_fp9zgtk,1588442548.0,"No, it’s a legit thing. I took a university course in ethnic studies and say what you want, but these people honestly believe it and they weren’t tricked into it by “the elite”. I see it as just a hysterical overreaction to a legitimately bad thing (racism, colonialism etc)"

stupidpol,fp6s966,t3_gbiczm,1588357714.0,"I think basically both sides are being fucking retarded. One, the establishment Democrat side because their whole “believe women” thing apparently exempts democrats; two, the people who immediately believe Tara Reade merely because they see establishment Dems being hypocritical and don’t like Biden. That’s even more stupid. “Believe women no matter what” is not how the justice system works, and it’s totally crazy to act like all accusations are true when there’s zero evidence. Especially with Tara Reade, who has a history of saying crazy shit and is ugly as hell. Let’s just use common sense. Do I like Biden? Fuck no, but to automatically believe this story just because the Dems are being hypocritical in dismissing it is itself being hypocritical."

I mean I understand why they closed down the beach but come on, let’s be real it’s practically impossible to get it either on the beach or in the water unless you’re a dumbass tourist who’s having a beach party — and the lifeguards could easily just crack down on that shit instead of banning beach access for everyone. You don’t have to be a trumptard to see that"
surfing,fos1tjc,t1_forrufc,1588022431.0,"No, but social stigma and localism is actually a good thing for the sport and keeps people safer in the long run. I lived near a heavily local/aggro break and I can tell you despite the tension the experience of surfing was much better because it wasn’t a free for all. The idea that everyone should just be nice and accepting isn’t nuanced"

Physics,fnpav6e,t3_g157cp,1587142274.0,"What does it mean for a state of a system/object to “couple” with a state of the environment in quantum mechanics? I remember studying, for instance, density matrices where you would look at such states, which if I recall live in a Hilbert space which is given by the Hilbert space of the system/object tensor-product the Hilbert space of the environment. 

This is a dumb question, but... what exactly does that even mean? What is a physical interpretation of a Hilbert space — is it like the set of all quantum possibilities? What does it mean to tensor-product two Hilbert spaces? In reality, if you’re looking at an object “coupling” to it’s environment, obviously the environment is the entire universe, right? Which seems to have an infinite amount of states. I just don’t even know how to think about how that relates to real life. 

I’ve looked at the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-testing example in a course, and it’s that I’m referring to. The bomb detonating & not detonating are the two states of the “environment”, but in a real life example what really is the environment and aren’t there wayyy more than two possible states?"
neoliberal,fnb1ifm,t1_fnaurbp,1586807580.0,"This is the default shitty take of 99% of people on here. Maybe it has more to do with fact that in '16, Obama was the sitting president while now Trump is. But yeah, chalk it up to sexism because you're a retard and your brain is broken."
neoliberal,fn1b6bf,t1_fn0o7m4,1586558423.0,"Why not steel-manning your opponents arguments instead of straw-manning them? My concerns about Biden (which are overridden by my hatred for Trump, i.e. I’ll still vote for Biden) are his role in mass incarceration as an anti-drug crusader in the 80s, his support of the Iraq war, his support of the bankruptcy bill (which Obama opposed), his opposition within the administration the Obama admin to the Bin Laden raid, his opposition to marijuana legalization and drug decriminalization, the list goes on."
