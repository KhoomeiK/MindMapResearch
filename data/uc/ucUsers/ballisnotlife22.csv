Probably would’ve been a lot more useful 20 years ago.."
ucla,fpht6ql,t1_fphqndv,1588627354.0,"We still technically benefit for one or two classes. But it’s obviously an initiative that disproportionately benefits north campus over south. 

Not even clear how much it benefits north campus since a lot of those classes have also phased out scantrons and bluebooks. 

I’ll be impressed when I see campus-wide free printing or something else that everyone will use regularly and easily."
ucla,fpfoslx,t3_gd6jon,1588578134.0,"They also talk a lot about getting free scantrons and blue books for students but idk the last time I or any STEM person I know has used one of those lol. Not to say it’s a bad thing, but definitely skewed towards north campus."
ucla,fpf59n8,t1_fpdihwj,1588562113.0,"Why should we have to *support ourselves* by constantly absorbing hikes in tuition? 

Everyone in USAC always talks about holding UCLA admin accountable, while simultaneously pushing us to avoid pressing admin on these issues and instead opting for the “next best thing we can get” by placing the burden on us and our already absurd tuition. 

Is that really advocating for the student body with admin?  “Ok fine u say we don’t have money so we’ll pay for it ourselves”

Make it make sense man."
