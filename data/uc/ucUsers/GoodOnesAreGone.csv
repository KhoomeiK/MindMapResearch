Troubled Times"
greenday,fpgy2nu,t3_gd22je,1588611557.0,It's good stuff. This collaboration is also what led to Iggy doing the narration for the Turn It Around documentary.
greenday,fovs7ku,t3_g9u5gq,1588106617.0,Yeah. There was discussion about this when the song came out 7.5 months ago.
UCI,fovauxm,t1_fotu0ea,1588098244.0,No. The lawyers will get paid and you'll get a coupon for a free side at Panda Express with a qualifying purchase.
greenday,fov4fpv,t3_g9jhz7,1588095214.0,"I wonder if Rancid's *Radio* should be included? Billie has writing credits on the song and played several live shows with the band.

Also *If There Was Ever a Time* by Armstrongs should definitely be on the playlist.  


Edit: nevermind... looks like both are on there. Didn't see them the first time."
greenday,foupnhd,t3_g9gczl,1588088311.0,"I'm thinking more Troubled Times here.

Also the second verse and pre-chorus of Back in the USA hit (not to mention the video):

*The saddest story ever told (bitter year)*  
*Is feeling safe in our suburban homes*  
*Like soldiers of an endless war (bitter year)*  
*And every church can have a liquor store*

*Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade*  
*Let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade*"
greenday,fnjkizt,t1_fniom4j,1587000892.0,"Same. I have tickets for Dodger Stadium on 25 July. Even though that's over 3 months away, I don't see mass gatherings being allowed by then. We'll be lucky if we can go sit and eat dinner at a restaurant. 

Everything with large gatherings for the rest of 2020 should just be postponed to 2021."
greenday,fnhkaew,t1_fngz3l0,1586963969.0,I've been trying to learn Brain Stew on acoustic as my first song on the guitar.
orangecounty,fn172zy,t1_fn15vc9,1586556086.0,"Also on Gigablast. No problems here even with all four of us (me, wife, and two kids) on zoom or skype or streaming video. 

I'm using the provided gateway because we have telephone."
greenday,fmp437d,t1_fmoycd3,1586274057.0,"They pushed back the Asian tour dates by a year. As much as I want to see them this year, it doesn't look like it's going to happen. So I'm hoping the NA dates get pushed a year too."
orangecounty,fmp3ptk,t3_fwgmvu,1586273855.0,"Kept the gardener on. He doesn't come into the house, and we don't even need to talk to him usually. We pay him via online bill pay (his choice) so there's really no contact. 

We've stopped having our housekeeper come, but that's really to protect her and us. We're still paying her though.  

If I wasn't working and getting paid, things might be different."
orangecounty,fmcrkjp,t1_fmcqqd8,1585951415.0,">last night: pain in my neck, eyes and a headache

dude... exact same for me last night. WTF."
