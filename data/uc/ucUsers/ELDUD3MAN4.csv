truegaming,fp4g09d,t1_fp3aifw,1588298238.0,The darkroot garden going down the narrow path down to the hydra. My gf made so much fun of me for falling off. I would agree there is some platforming to get hard to reach items that you can see from a distance.
truegaming,fp4fkwc,t1_fp421jj,1588297980.0,Totally forgot about Bloodstained. Can't believe this is so far down.

truegaming,fp4evbs,t1_fp4ep7y,1588297550.0,I would definitely play it again. I  have the remaster wish listed. Played it on 360 years ago

truegaming,fp2j81v,t3_gawmsn,1588262689.0,"I really enjoyed Shadow Complex. The 3d backgrounds and enemies took it to the next level for me. The different lighting and depth of the environments drew me in. It also made the outdoor environments seem more open. Enemies and bosses could also take advantage of the 3d aspect as well iirc.

I would like to see more games done like this.

Edit:
Other honorable mentions-

Dust: An Elysian Tale

Deadlight (maybe not exactly metroidvania)

Salt and Sanctuary (haven't played)

Blasphemous (haven't played)"

Scandalize-

Shock or horrify (someone) by a real or imagined violation of propriety or morality."
UCSC,fovohz2,t3_g9t4q5,1588104793.0,"In hindsight I really wish I had done that. I took a few classes ( intro to java in HS, intermediate java, intro to c++) but didn't minor. I am currently a software developer, but that took me several years to get into.

It really depends on what you see yourself doing. With just a Business Management Economics major I wasn't getting any good jobs/experience. Mostly customer service positions, got old real quick. I would say that startups like it if you can wear multiple hats, I feel that this is becoming more of a trend as well.

If you ever find yourself having to work/communicate with developers it will give you a big advantage. Knowing their terminology and the fundamental concepts is enough. You don't need to know language/syntax specifics but a basic understanding will gain you some respect.

I really enjoy my job now, but I definitely struggle more than some of my coworkers who studied CS in school."
BaseBuildingGames,fosq3uq,t1_fos3wgh,1588035725.0,I totally forgot the base building from xcom. I'll have to replay it
BaseBuildingGames,foqmlq8,t3_g91a8t,1587996818.0,"Subnautica maybe.

Although there is a previous disaster, the game starts with a new one for the player. You are living through your own disaster while simultaneously investigating the previous. Base building isn't the focus but there is a lot you can do.

Edit: Satisfactory might be worth looking at. I agree with the suggestion of The Forest."
eFreebies,fok7300,t3_g4nw03,1587836611.0,I installed but it won't launch. Get a splash screen and then nothing.... any help?

BaseBuildingGames,fobyugs,t3_g6r0xl,1587665217.0,Good call I have looked at it before and didn't realize it went FTP. Seems like other than jan 2020 there are more positive reviews than negative. And I did see the response from Dev that they will increase world size in last half of 2020. I will be adding it to my account.

Edit: tip if you want to clean the window use a very soft cloth, scratches easily. Also I would just use water and maybe a mild soap

Edit2: this [review](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R5z9-BeJkEQ) of it is pretty in depth."

sandiego,fnv2255,t1_fnuv8nc,1587277705.0,"They are just recovering from being overwhelmed. People will get sick and injured and die is a reality for them. And it is in everyone's best interest that we take care of them.

 ""That’s in large part because hospitals have been planning for a surge and canceled elective surgeries before the virus ramped up.""

“Because we’re not doing elective procedures that can be pushed back, it’s even quieter than usual.”

From your sources. When they finally tell everyone they can go back to normal the hospitals will have to deal with all the stuff that has been put off.(next statement is an opinion) I would say that some people have avoided going to the hospital for fear of contracting the virus.

I know the term ""essential"" is being thrown out a lot recently but the medical professionals are crucial to society. Keep the numbers down so that they can go help other areas with confidence knowing that people are following the guidelines set by our government and health officials.

No one has said stay inside forever. Unfortunately we have to try to wait until we can test everyone, find a consistent and effective treatment, or develop a vaccine. 

Yes bill payments are ongoing, that should be solved by means other than everyone going outside. Other countries have canceled mortgage payments.

""Everyone should be mingling"" This to me sounds like you are comparing this to the chickenpox. Are you saying that we should have chickenpox parties and expose each other purpose?

The death rate is 6% globally and more than 4% in the US its beyond a minor problem."

fasting,fnoxisq,t3_g2y9hy,1587135473.0,"There will be slumps I think. I started back in October and just last month there was an entire week that I felt I was extremely hungry. If I had to guess it might have to do with stress/sleep habits. If your sleep is consistent you will have an easier time. And just expect that there will be tough times, no one is perfect. 

Drink plenty of water, I bought a new insulated bottle that holds 32 ounces. Now I don't have to worry about getting up to fill it as much and I drink more because I am not afraid of running out. 

I am also still working from home so its easy for me to keep working and just eat when I am done. Consistent schedule is key."

sandiego,fmmoq3e,t1_fmlp50v,1586209185.0,"People not giving a fuck about things is always true. But compared to someone who already has to do this as part of their job, versus grocery store workers  who are probably already overworked and have to add all these measures on top of their normal workload. I'll take the food service worker, they don't have to deal with as much shitty people with takeout. I have had to hear someone vent about it since this all started. Me trying to think positive would hope that local restaurants as OP was trying help would have people working there for years maybe. People who might actually enjoy their jobs/boss, rather than fast food workers."
sandiego,fmmo3vr,t1_fmm5fyc,1586208854.0,"Stuff you buy from grocery stores is probably touched by just many people before it gets to you. Grocery stores are probably just as big a risk.

We're not talking about the economy, OP was just trying to get people to help out local restaurants. I wouldn't equate the two."
sandiego,fmk986d,t1_fmjznuh,1586147872.0,"I understand your concerns, I would just like to point out that the food industry is already pretty regulated when it comes to contamination. I know someone who works at a pharmacy and when they explain (vent) to me what they have to do now it just sounds like all the stuff I had to do when I worked in food service.

Drivers have started to wear masks and gloves as well. Restaurants have begun double bagging things. You can also ask for no contact, meaning they can leave it at your door and you can grab it once they are gone.

You have valid concerns, don't mean to downplay them at all. Stay safe"
