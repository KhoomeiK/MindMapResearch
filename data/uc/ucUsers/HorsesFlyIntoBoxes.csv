learnprogramming,fplyjq0,t1_fplts6q,1588721963.0,"What are you talking about? Systems programming languages largely follow this convention today. Even “modern” systems languages like rust are statically typed and require return type specification. Scripting languages and interpreted languages like python may not be statically typed and may not require return type declaration, but no one on their right mind is going to use an interpreted language like python to do systems development."
learnprogramming,fpky2ao,t3_gdwl5t,1588703022.0,"To add to this, the goal is in fact to have the cpu be used as much as possible. The concept is called cpu utilization, and it’s studied in os or real time task scheduling. The ideal would be for the cpu to always be doing some sort of task since that would be the most efficient way to schedule."

UCSantaBarbara,fou0yq4,t1_fotrvf1,1588072965.0,"I love Rudin and I'm glad we used it when I took 118ABC, but I loved it because I was always in the mathlab or the library with 2 or 3 other classmates working through problems on whiteboards together.

 If not the mathlab or library I'd be in south hall at my professor's or ta's office hours and sometimes someone not involved in the course (maybe a grad student or another faculty member) would see us working and help us out. There was a lot of collaboration, and the constant dialogue and thinking out loud really helped me learn while doing those tough problems (usually our homework problems were custom written since our professor knew answers to Rudin were all online).

I can't imagine learning through Rudin isolated at home in an online course having only taken math 8 (an introductory proofs course). That honestly sounds like hell."

I guess it boils down to what you are looking for in your software. Are you looking for tools to create music/sounds or are you looking for tools to make the actual plugins? For me I'd rather jump right into the instrumentation and the added bonus of DSP in reaktor is just that, an added bonus."
