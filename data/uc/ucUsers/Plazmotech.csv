godot,fpiis2i,t3_gdo5c0,1588641770.0,"I actually just took a little look at Godot's source. It looks like they have some `SyntaxHighlighter` class, but it's never used. In fact, it's an abstract class and is never concretely implemented, and the methods to set the highlighter are never used. There's then a fallback default highlighting option, which appears to be what the editor is using.

It shouldn't be too hard to expose the `SyntaxHighlighter` class and the methods for setting it within the `TextEdit` so that users can write concrete implementations. I can likely submit a PR to do this in the coming weeks.

I just don't know how that plays for GDScript since I mainly use C#. Is GDScript going to panic if it sees an abstract class? I don't know...

Additionally there are all sorts of util functions in there for checking if things are whitespace, etc. It would be very nice to expose those as well, and allow the `add_color_region` to accept some sort of enum for the delimiters that could allow this to be used.

It would actually be much cleaner if instead of calling `add_color_region` and `keyword` inside of `TextEdit`, that all of this functionality was delegated to a `SyntaxHighlighter`, which the default can be set to whatever the `TextEdit` is currently doing."

Is this really the case? If I call `TileMap.SetTile` in C# it's just some trickery that really does a string compare?

> If you're writing code that does a lot of work, then you'll want to rely on passing more information to the NativeScript code, letting it do batch work, and then getting the results rather than repeatedly making calls across the scripting API to do iterative work.

Yeah, I see what you mean. To be honest my application isn't demanding a lot. It wouldn't be slow even if I wrote the whole thing just in C#. But doing something like `obj.Call(""method"", param)` is just so ugly... I suppose I could write a C# wrapper for it that would do this behind the scenes so I don't have to look at it though :)

Actually that is what I might do, I need some Rust practice. The only downside is now I'm doubling my declarations which could cause bugs with me being an idiot and forgetting to update something.

**Edit** And I forgot to ask — If you are calling `GD.Load` for every object, isn't that a bit slow? It's effectively reloading the entire library for every object that ""inherits"" it, no? Would it be more ""idiomatic"" to create a singleton and have the C# class own the data, and simply pass it to GDNative for processing?"

godot,fp31f2p,t1_fp2zfmq,1588271446.0,"There are many ways to do this. Here's a couple:

1. **You could do it in code.** Use some circle nodes to draw your circles. In your process function, have them moving randomly. Loop through every circle, and then every circle within that. If they're close enough (and not the same circle), attach a line2d node that goes between them. You'll either need to delete all lines every frame, or keep track of them using some data structure to delete them when they become too far apart. Plus you'll have to update each line every frame to make sure its touching the circle.

2. **You could use a shader.** Make a color rect node the size of your ""effect"", and attach a shader to it. Pass into the shader the positions of the circles via a uniform. Godot shader language currently doesn't have arrays, so you can pass in the positions using a texture where each channel corresponds to a coordinate (r for x, g for y, maybe b for size, etc). Then define a signed distance function to draw a color inside the circle and no color outside (there are many tutorials for SDFs online — look it up). Finally, change your SDF to also draw a color if the fragment is within a certain distance of a line between two circles that are sufficiently close enough. To do this you would have to loop over every circle, then through every circle within that to compare the distance. If it's small enough, check the distance between the line and the fragment (this amount to a projection from the fragment vector to the line vector, checking if thats within the bounds of the line, if it is, subtract to get the distance vector). If small enough, draw a color."

I had no will to live or desire to die, nor did I know what either of those were. I didn’t even have language.

The whole time there was a presence. I wouldn’t say a god or even a being, certainly not the “machine elves” that people report. Just one sort of presence. I’m not religious or spiritual really, so I can only explain it with science - and to me, it made me realize that there is something much much deeper about the way consciousness works then we know, and much deeper than I’ve ever seen anyone discuss coherently. 

The impression that I got is that life is sort of a “game”. Some people who have these types of experience seem to come out of it thinking that they must get rid to their ego and that ego is somehow bad. I get the opposite impression - that the point of life *is* to embrace ego for a little while. To have experiences, to feel emotions, and to seek happiness.

Anyway a bit of a rambling there - to actually answer your question more fully, I think there’s no hard line on ego death. I’ve had trips on DMT (and LSD) where there’s partial ego death, but not totally. I can still look down and know I’m human. Most of my DMT trips are kind of like this, especially ones where I’ve not broken through. But there’s still definitely some detachment."

gamedev,foiyb6e,t1_foitsnl,1587801234.0,"I found the video very interesting! I loved powder game as a kid. I would be interested to see if you make more videos about cool performance related tricks we can do for this style of game. When I first saw Noita's trailer the first thing that popped into my head was *how in the hell did they do that??*

A couple things that pop into my head:

* Take a page from minecraft's book and don't store each tile as a struct. In any given chunk you're unlikely to have a huge variety of tiles. In fact, most of them will be pretty much the same one or two tiles. So store a dictionary of unique tiles, and for the tile map you can use a tiny array that can literally use 2 or 4 *bits* per tile. The number of bits per tile changes depending on the number of unique tiles in the chunk.

* Only update a chunk if the last frame update resulted in any changes in that chunk, or if in this update a pixel moved into or otherwise interacted with a pixel of this chunk (basically a dirty flag)

* Velocities probably don't need to be that fine. You can most likely use 2 bytes only for velocity if you quantize velocities to the nearest integer pixel value — which you are likely to do since with this style of game there should be at most one tile type per pixel. In fact you could use just 1 byte if you assume that a tile can't move more than ~~16~~ 8 pixels per frame (since you need to store sign too).

* Color does not need to be in the tile — you could just store the tile type in that dictionary I mentioned before and look up the color. If there are tile types that change color like fire that’s also easy: count this as a separate unique tile and in each unique tile in the dictionary you hold tile metadata like this.

* I'm not sure how to deal with lifetimes. You might just have to really keep those 4 bytes for the lifetime of each since it's very unique to each tile.

In total that'll bring your tile array down to like 10 bytes per tile or less - a bit stream of between 2-8 bits per tile (the unique tile index), a separate array for the velocities (where each velocity is only 2 bytes) and lifetimes (4 bytes). So youll have two arrays: one of between 65kB and 250kB (2-8 bits per tile) for the unique identifier, and one of 1.5MB for the velocities + lifetime. Then just a dictionary of the unique tile types in each chunk which wont occupy more than a few hundred bytes, which would store the tile IDs and any metadata (such as tile state) for each unique tile type.

With this you're looking at at most 3MB per chunk and then a full map of 4 screens of 1920*1080 would occupy less than 100MB."
gamedev,foisa16,t3_g7d23o,1587795380.0,Cool - but what about storage? You showed a particle struct that used a whopping 136 bytes per pixel. In a single 1920x1080 screen that’s already almost 300MB. Plus anything bigger would run slow as molasses without anything clever going on. In one regular sized game level you could be updating over 10 million pixels every frame...
