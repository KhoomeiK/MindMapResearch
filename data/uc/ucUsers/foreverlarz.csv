UCSantaBarbara,fnpgp9d,t1_fnog2q6,1587145198.0,"Or at least multiple choice questions administered online should not be used for high-stakes evaluation.

If the test is difficult enough, and it's a high-stakes exam, some students *will* cheat--perhaps by hiring someone else to take the entire exam on their behalf. When there's a will, there's often a way.

In my opinion, it all comes back to a careful balance in the design of the course, including wise use of technology and being especially generous with the grading curves. Maybe even give As for complete effort. But that effort might include watching 30 hours of lecture and answering intermittent MC question prompts, completing critical thinking assignments, and maybe group projects."
UCSantaBarbara,fnpfp15,t1_fnnm7bx,1587144694.0,"Excellent question.

Associated Students has the ability to take majority votes to impose fees on all students. From a welfare standpoint, it's unclear why all students should be required to pay for all services. This process seems political--the majority wants some service, and the service is cheaper if they make everyone pay for it.

For example, the Rec Cen could be run with individuals electing to pay for memberships. But their budget would be much smaller and somewhat less predictable. Off-campus alternatives would be better and more prevalent. One benefit of having everyone be a part of Rec Cen is that friends can more easily convince other friends to join them for activities, since they're paying for it anyway. This spillover seems like it would be a very small benefit, though."
UCSantaBarbara,fnpeflg,t3_g343gw,1587144065.0,"Yes, this is terrible.

Students should also keep in mind that *positive* comments on physical attractiveness or other irrelevant traits is also bad. For example, female TAs who get a lot of ""you're hot"" evals have their credibility undermined, feel degraded, and are put in a difficult position when asked to share their evals when on the job market."

UCSantaBarbara,fmun4fm,t1_fkcgmu1,1586394686.0,"Where did you gather this information? Nothing in either privacy policy references ""medical records.""

You capitalized ""CITIZENSHIP"" but took it out of its context, which is:

""Any other personal information displayed on your photo identification, such as your citizenship status, national origin, military status, or veteran status.""

Frankly, that seems pretty reasonable. They want to check your ID and keep a copy. So they're acknowledging what all your ID may show, including citizenship status.

\---

As far as I can tell, you're scaremongering. I'm a huge privacy advocate and am actively advocating UCSB academic departments to not use ProctorU. (I am a UCSB employee.) But any such discourse should be honest. By stretching the truth so thin, you're not going to help the cause.

\---

You wasted my time, as well as anyone else who reads your post. Also, before I did my own research and reading, I repeated some of the garbage you mis-quote to other people. So you made a liar out of me and anyone else who trusted your information."
