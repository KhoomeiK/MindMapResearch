UCSD,fnmft09,t1_fnmdoml,1587070651.0,Oh gotcha! Do you mind sharing what did you learn in Math 18? I heard that it's somewhat related to Math 20C?
UCSD,fnlh8ha,t1_fnkh6cw,1587053510.0,I see. Thank you for your advice!
UCSD,fnkeha6,t3_g2ae8c,1587024028.0,"Ah I see. Well, that's interesting that there was no curve for your 2B class considering how intense and  hard the class is. Btw, is it normal that all professor's name are Staff right now on Webreg? When will we be able to know who the prof is?"
UCSD,fnkdr2l,t1_fnkdh9j,1587023288.0,How many hours did you have to spend for 2B per week if you don't mind sharing? And did your prof give out a curve?
UCSD,fmtl9ke,t3_fx9i7l,1586374664.0,"Same. I had ton of assignments and due dates that I have to keep track of. Even though I didn't have to waste time on part-time job or walking from class to class, I felt like I'm even busier with the workload at home :/ I'm glad I'm not the only one feeling like this!"
UCSD,f6kn34f,t3_dqagex,1572915761.0,"For Math 20C, I'm considering either Um Ko Woon or Kitsela. Which professor would you recommend? How was your past experience with these 2 professors? Please help..."
