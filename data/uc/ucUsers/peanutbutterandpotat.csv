UCSC,fpglix4,t3_gdc8lq,1588605039.0,"I know a lot of current students who are planning on taking fall quarter off if it's made online.

I also know that this is becoming a serious problem at other UC's through people that I know who work there. There are so many claims for people who want to either defer enrollment or take a quarter off from school that schools are getting worried about losing income.

Because let's be honest here it doesn't make sense to blow literally tens of thousands of dollars for online schooling lmao."
UCSC,fp310re,t1_fp2t3bv,1588271251.0,Yeah I want to know what was written too.
UCSC,fp2r0xg,t3_gaodb2,1588266446.0,Those things scare me.
UCSC,fobto9c,t1_fobj44i,1587663545.0,"You could have a dozen students yeeting themselves off of building in every UC and the admins wouldn't care at all.

Admins most certainly won't care about this."

EDH,fnwo5iw,t3_g4cjwx,1587322133.0,"It's annoying. Basically renders any prior tutoring useless and it becomes hard to try to formulate a strategy against constant wheeling.

As some other people stated it's very deck dependent. In general if your deck tries to use a modicum of strategy, constant wheeling just obliterates any possibility of deploying good countermeasures without hurting your boardstate progression."
santacruz,fnwitpo,t3_g4bitb,1587319193.0,afaik closed until further notice.
UCSC,fnf4llc,t3_g1288p,1586901302.0,You know it's bad when there were [other](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/ee7626/my_honest_opinion_on_the_film_program_here/) posts pointing out the significant downsides to [this program](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/fkgws2/got_admitted_for_film_and_digital_media/fkv6gmv/) at UCSC.

so it looks like ""nytimes.com."" instead of ""nytimes.com"""
UCSC,fmu3w24,t3_fwxu09,1586384094.0,Just a tip: If the thermostat isn't working and it's too cold just go to home depot in capitola and buy a space heater. they're usually ~$20 and it'll heat up your room to be fairly nice and toasty. (get the electric one not the fuel ones)
EDH,fm5wcci,t3_ft9x69,1585781292.0,look into [[Axis of Mortality]]
