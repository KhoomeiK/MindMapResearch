But I know people in the marine sciences who are taking 4+ years to get a master's. There is no national standardization, and different fields and schools have different norms."

AnimalCrossing,fosihxj,t1_fori6zc,1588031366.0,"I started out buying all the color options of each clothing item. That stopped really fast, but I keep running into the issue where I'll buy a couple colors of pants or something and then the next day the matching shirts show up and I realise the shirts I like don't match the pants I bought. Ugh lol. 

I know I can look things up and stuff, but I really just don't want to do that while I'm playing the game most of the time."
Coronavirus,fos3jqw,t1_forfmqa,1588023326.0,That's a great option for people that have it. My wife and I live in a one bedroom apartment and it's challenging balancing me getting work done without relegating her to the bedroom. I can't imagine what it would have been like if we still lived in a studio.
Coronavirus,fos2t99,t1_foqzdv7,1588022945.0,"The physical distance helps with the mental compartmentalization for me. Working from home I tend to either never stop thinking about work or have a lot of trouble getting into the working mindset. 

My wife and I also live in a small one bedroom apartment. There is no space for two of us to work, or one of us to work while the other is not working. The space issue is something we could improve if we reorganized the apartment, but we'd need to buy another desk and a couple room dividers and stuff. These are not insurmountable issues, but they are common. 

The biggest issue that can't be fixed is somewhat specific to my job. I work in science, and a lot of our progress comes from easy access to talking to my colleagues. There's also the lab work that can't be done from home, but even the office stuff is much easier when my colleagues are around to bounce ideas off of."
modernwarfare,forsed7,t1_foqbvdw,1588017686.0,"Live grenades that haven't been thrown should just drop and go off imo. That lets the grenade thrower feel like they did something, but the grenade doesn't get thrown."

CODWarzone,fnfguhv,t1_fnex9lq,1586907790.0,That's kinda the joke...
CODWarzone,fnex3ut,t1_fnemsus,1586897471.0,"Honestly that was mostly just a joke about the excuses I tell myself. I'm in grad school, so I don't have much time to play and my friends are way better than I am. 

It's funny, in multiplayer I do way better alone than in a group with them because I get to play with people at my own skill level instead of just getting stomped all the time and picking up a few lucky kills here and there."
CODWarzone,fnehibm,t1_fnefzy2,1586889465.0,"You were the distraction that allowed your teammates to get those kills. Or you were scouting and found the enemy players for your teammates, you just happened to find them by dying lol."
AnimalCrossing,fnbs8yk,t1_fnbp7pn,1586821300.0,Good to know in the future. That's just not the norm in my friend group.
AnimalCrossing,fnbot53,t1_fnb5vl4,1586819402.0,That might just be a communication issue. I would never have thought that was a problem because I would not care if someone bought them. If it's still in my store by the time I let other people on my island then I didn't want it enough to buy it.
AnimalCrossing,fnbmj2q,t1_fnblwg8,1586818194.0,"Nope, nothing blocked. I walk up, dig my two holes and start hitting the rock. It sounds like I might be doing it too slowly. I'll try faster tomorrow and see what happens."

AnimalCrossing,fnbliqg,t1_fnbd12m,1586817669.0,I'll try that next time. Definitely not joy-con drift. I'm using a brand new switch lite.

AnimalCrossing,fnag18n,t1_fna7h0u,1586796863.0,"I must be doing the hole method wrong because I only ever get 7 hits. I might have gotten 8 once, but I don't remember what I did differently."

trailrunning,fn0zw2x,t1_fmyuern,1586552006.0,"Yes, it can in an issue in parts of California too. Most of time the snakes aren't going to bother you though, so it's something you should be aware of but not terribly stressed about. If you see a tiny one though, stay the fuck away. 

Running around the central coast of California I would run across snakes sunning themselves in the path on occasion. Never a rattlesnake though. I usually would either give them space or turn around and pick a different path that day. No sense bothering them. I would try do the same for deer and coyotes too, though I usually scared the deer before I even knew they were there. So I scare them, they bound off through the bushes and and startle me because I never saw them. 

The only time I found rattlesnakes was when I was out looking for reptiles with my ecology classes, or doing trail work and stuff with the BLM."
chemistry,fmz6308,t1_fmyao3x,1586507834.0,It's a hard line to balance. You want to keep the material accessible without oversimplifying. Education research had also shown that people learn the concepts better when you use terminology they are already familiar with. When people have to look up half the words you use to explain a concept they usually learn what a couple of the words mean and completely miss out on learning the concept.
UCSD,fmz5nsi,t1_fmy0zyf,1586507363.0,"Lab TA here, if you can avoid taking a lab online that is the best choice. No matter how good we get and doing online labs from a conceptual perspective, the hands on experience is so much richer and you miss out on learning the physical skills and troubleshooting that comes with lab science. 

Most of the labs are essentially becoming lecture classes with a lot of homework. Some labs are giving you random data and asking you to do the normal lab reports. Other labs are ditching the lab reports in favor of more worksheet style assignments. It kinda depends on how data driven the lab is."
UCSD,fmz59ia,t1_fmxfif1,1586506914.0,"Yeah, balancing an online exam format with an in-person format is very difficult. The professors I've TA'ed for don't like dealing with proctoring online exams, so they have to make an exam that can be open notes/open book (and realistically open internet) but still test what people have learned. It's easier to write exam questions when it is expected that people won't have access to other resources because the questions have to be self-contained. 

It's a really hard problem because you don't want to write an exam that is harder (though that is a frequent trap), but you want to write questions that require more thinking than flipping open the index of a textbook and finding the right page."
CODWarzone,fmz4nkt,t1_fmz3l1t,1586506244.0,"I wasn't playing that night, but my friends won their first few games of season 3 using just riot shields and the stealth perks. It's playing the game of picking the right spot sometimes getting lucky circles. I think that's one of the best things about this BR, there are plenty of different strategies that can work so it keeps the game fresh. And sometimes just fucking arrive having fun can actually lead to winning (they did not expect the riot shields to work the first time)."
CODWarzone,fmz4ber,t1_fmz3vw6,1586505870.0,"That happens sometimes, but most of the time we are either able to buy people back pretty quickly or we all died as a group."
AnimalCrossing,fmz3yrf,t1_fmyrrpd,1586505485.0,"Lol, I love his reactions to insects. I make him tell me about all of them!"
CODWarzone,fmz3ljf,t1_fmz2l2s,1586505086.0,"I think I would have more fun with it if the matches are a bit shorter. I played it twice and both games took the entire time. I know BR games can take a while too, but they don't feel like a guaranteed 30 minute game. My friends and I either do well or the match is over in 5-10 minutes. So yeah, put a 15 minute timer on and we would probably play it regularly.

Edit: I'm also in the not playing games very often group. I'm still working, so even with the extra free time from only partially commuting I still only get on CoD once or twice a week. I think that's part of why I like the faster games, I feel like I get more gaming for my time that way if that makes any sense lol."
CODWarzone,fmz31e6,t1_fmz2ph3,1586504482.0,"Yes! Quads is great. We have just enough people to do 4 corners, and have fun playing protect the president. It's less fun doing things like that in trios IMO."
CODWarzone,fmz2wp1,t1_fmyyu6f,1586504347.0,Yes! I used to love those huge games in the old battlefront. That was the best part of going to see my cousins in the summer!
ConsoleKSP,fmz2q0l,t1_fmy2h1d,1586504150.0,"I saw that video a couple weeks of Jeb getting picked up off minmus by grabbing a ladder dangling off a ship as it flew by. So it should be doable (but probably not by me any time soon, especially not on console)."
KerbalAcademy,fmz2ifh,t1_fmxth65,1586503924.0,"I'm on PS4 so maybe it's different, but I haven't found any specialized action groups. My controller buttons all seem to be already mapped to specific tasks so I end up using my curser a lot. Am I missing out on some shortcuts?"
UCSD,fmz2b4s,t3_fy1p8v,1586503709.0,"TA here, I'm perfectly comfortable using zoom, but when I'm staring at a screen full of black boxes and names I do start to wonder whether anyone can here me. Sometimes a little reassurance can help calm the nerves a lot.

labrats,fmz1uqo,t1_fmylg3y,1586503239.0,"Not everyone, lots of grad students are having to go in and film labs right now. I'm teaching o-chem online this quarter, and we were given about 3 days notice that we would be teaching the lab online. Even better, the chem department couldn't get their hands on cameras, so we are all required to use our personal equipment. I have a GoPro and a nice DSLR, so we are getting decent footage, but I know the analytical chemistry lab is being filmed on an older iPhone."
KerbalSpaceProgram,fmz185e,t1_fmymp50,1586502597.0,That is such a good idea. I need to put that on a post it lol.
ADHD,fmz0yqo,t1_fmywrkm,1586502328.0,"I suspect that was what doctor was implying. She was basically saying you aren't going to get those drugs here. Fortunately I had anticipated that and worked with my doc to get on a non-stimulent for those 6 months so I didn't have to worry about getting refills. Less effective medication, but good enough as a temporary fix."
ADHD,fmxuboj,t1_fmxodg0,1586472019.0,"It might have been a language issue, but when I was in France I had to get a medical exam for my long term visa and the doctor said they don't have ADHD there. Otherwise the system seemed to work pretty well lol. I was able to go to a random bus thing on campus for the required cheat x-ray, and it didn't take any phone calls to make the appointment for the physical."
CODWarzone,fmv077d,t1_fmt9jmx,1586402889.0,"I think there are plenty of us who are happy with quads, but we are all playing the game instead of posting on Reddit. That's just the nature of Reddit, complaints tend to rise to the top because unhappy people are way more vocal."

sandiego,fmngjrr,t1_fmndnuf,1586225557.0,"I have no idea. I know there have been concept ships built that demonstrate how green tech can be built into a ship, but afaik there are none in use. 

One part of it is that container ships burn heavy fuel oil that is essentially what is leftover after all the good stuff is distilled out of crude. It's the heavy stuff that is way too viscous to put into a gasoline or diesel burning engine. It's also super cheap because it's the leftover stuff that nobody else wants. If you search for bunker fuel or marine fuel oil you'll find plenty of information about it. This is the real reason shipping had such a high environmental load. Burning gas and diesel is way better than bunker oil."
