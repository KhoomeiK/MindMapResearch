That said, quality can vary a lot more based on what the artist/record label provides to tidal or Spotify, since at the end of the day these streaming services are simply a delivery method for what the artist is putting out. Not all tracks on Tidal are actually MQA since not all the artists use it, and some tracks on Tidal are demonstrably better because the file provided to Tidal was better mixed and mastered than the file they provided to Spotify"
BudgetAudiophile,fpft7k6,t1_fpfeo3u,1588582600.0,"I would run just the Sony subwoofer included with this system, bass gets difficult to dial in if you have 2 different subwoofers, it's much easier to integrate with your speakers properly with only 1 or 2x of the same subwoofer

You would need 2 additional speakers for 5.1 but you could probably get away with using ""satellite"" speakers from any brand you like for the channels behind you and save a little money over buying 2x full on bookshelf speakers. I'd check what kind of output options the Sony receiver uses before buying the rear channel speakers, some receivers will send signal and power to the rear channels and some only send signal to rear channels and the rears have to have their own amplification"

It's not a terrible package when looked at in a vacuum, but people who were excited about getting RE2 remake for RE3 were disappointed with the shift in focus"
Games,fouf66q,t1_fou9qie,1588082900.0,"There's also vending machines from companies that were introduced in Crisis Core. This is definitely part of the meta-universe of FF7, there's sooooo much that this game hints at in the background"
Games,fouet1s,t1_fou79o8,1588082692.0,"I think that's one thing I appreciate about Nomura and Square's 1st party games in general, they do not half-ass the weird shit. It doesn't always work great (KH3 plot), but they swing for the fences every time and that's admirable in its own way"
Games,fouearg,t1_fou290y,1588082410.0,"My dude, have you seen the endings to FF7, 8, 9 or 10? Time travel, multiple realities, artificial lifeforms, cosmic doom entities, and massive casts of characters banding together with the power of friendship is kind of Square's MO"
Games,foudueu,t1_foub9hw,1588082152.0,"That's the concern a lot of fans have, but I honestly think it's just the creators dangling the hope in front of us for 2 games just to make it hurt again when it has to happen. She has some pretty clear lines early on in the game that makes it sound like she knows what's going to happen and has accepted that part. Lots of ""let's make the most of the time we have together"" stuff"
Games,foud6ph,t1_fouaeb9,1588081771.0,"The whole conflict from Corel thru the end of the Golden Saucer is pretty central to the 2nd disc and introducing Cait Sith. Without Barret, the squad has no reason to go to the Golden Saucer and would likely have gotten to Junon much earlier without ever meeting Cait Sith, altering the timeline of them getting caught in the military parade and possibly leading to them never boarding the ship to Costa Del Sol. Meaning the Jenova cells on the cargo ship could possibly have wiped out a large amount of the shinra higher ups onboard the boat since our crew wasn't there to stop it. Without Rufus or Hojo alive, the events of the Ancient Crater play out differently or don't happen at all except for Cloud making his way there eventually, possibly without finding out about Zack, which would mean that Sephiroth wins."
Games,fouc6rh,t1_fou89ax,1588081178.0,"And then, we get the finale which overtly says the rest of the game series does not have to follow the existing script anymore."
49ers,fouayzg,t1_fosj04s,1588080430.0,"In some other interviews I saw Lynch say that Wes had been in contact with Jennings quite a bit to ""get to the bottom of who he really is"" and Lynch mentioned on the call with Jennings that Wes had been in touch with him. I think they definitely did their research on Jennings' issues and found a good kid who did some dumb stuff that he didn't really mean to do (as in, he had poor emotional outburst control) and wants to be a better person/football player"
49ers,fou9b4z,t1_fosvggl,1588079372.0,"I mean, at this stage it's pretty clear it wasn't about money or medical issues. Trent had bad blood with that front office and was trying to get off the team to somewhere of his choosing, going to Kyle Shanahan's team without even a 1-year extension or a raise of some sort is as blatant a middle finger as he could give without literally flipping Snyder the bird on snapchat"
