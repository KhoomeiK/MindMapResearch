I think I'll ultimately have to talk to someone about this in person, but the field I'm interested in is niche and no PhD wants to talk to some random guy in community college. It seems like the Applied Math major has a lot of the computational and mathematical classes missing in Physics, and I have no way of knowing if Physics courses will help me if I'm interested in.

I agree on your take that BME is a non-starter when it comes to majors. Many of my BME friends have said this as well.

My focus on mathematics seems like more of an agnostic way of strengthening my problem solving and modeling skills until I decide what route to go down. 

In the meantime I've been following a number of cutting edge research in the space, like the Memory Shape Probes to get further down into neural tissue by snaking along blood vessels (Dyugu Kuzum, UCSD), implants that can move further into tissue by crawling (Paul McEuen, Cornell), multimodal neural probes (Polina Anikeeva, MIT), stretchable, dissoluble electronics (John Rogers, Northwestern), and Neural Dust (Berkeley).
