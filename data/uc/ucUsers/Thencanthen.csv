ucla,fpcwgb3,t3_gck03j,1588514482.0,"As an international student currently at home, I have to say all my professors have been reasonably lenient and understanding this quarter. From giving 24 hour exams to arranging different office hours for students from different time zones, they have been trying hard and are very receptive to feedback. You have to keep in mind that this is a first time for all of us, including them. If you have actually come up with a better idea, speak it, I encourage if you. If not, we should be lenient on the professors too. 
I mean, it would be amazing to get a tuition refund, but I see why they can’t do that either."

I’m talking about acts of kindness, like giving food or a haircut or even a dignified conversation. I’m not really arguing about giving them money, and I’m not saying individual acts of charity should replace donating money to charities."
