UCSC,fpm37kr,t3_ge9hdg,1588724639.0,"It's not a huge deal as it's made out to be, if  you want drugs you'll find them. But if you abstain it's not like people are going to shove them down your throat. You'll be fine. I would suggest Cowell or Stevenson if you're outdoorsy and sporty since those colleges are closest to the recreational facilities and are social (I think)."
trees,fpkvllf,t3_gdvpkl,1588701802.0,Definitely in the evening once I take care of whatever I need to do throughout the day.
GalaxyS9,fpi9dr1,t1_fpgwy02,1588636287.0,Alternatively you could just turn off animations altogether and that might fix any issues with lag.
GalaxyS9,fpgv7ml,t3_gdeqj5,1588610109.0,"You can try reducing animations in advanced features -> reduce animations. In developer options you can also try reducing the animation scales. I turned off window for example, while changing the other two to 0.5x."
GalaxyS9,fp6l88u,t1_fp66rb7,1588354256.0,I don't think it matters but the XAA firmware would probably work best if you're not in the US.
GalaxyS9,fp64ent,t3_gbip88,1588345869.0,The U1 firmware is the unlocked firmware that is carrier-free.
GalaxyS9,foxm55x,t3_ga4lth,1588148405.0,Those builds are the US unlocked firmware (denoted by U1). I'm not exactly sure if you can download AT&T's firmware though (the one you want). Is there a reason you need to download it?
UCSC,fogxfqa,t3_g7cwt7,1587758076.0,"Doing alright, the only thing really in the way right now is this short assignment that's due this weekend and I'm not exactly sure where to begin. Other than that I've tried to keep up with classes and going outside every now and then."
GalaxyS9,fog1hi8,t3_g74oax,1587746490.0,"I've experienced the same thing recently, I think it started after updating to android 10."
UCSC,fnszsyl,t3_g3qitp,1587231911.0,"Nope, just wait until they adjust and remove those charges. I just got them removed this week after moving out a while back so they're still working on it."
GalaxyWatch,fnqq5pg,t3_g3ak8y,1587169798.0,"Mostly for the convenience at first. I thought I would regret buying mine but it's proven to be very useful. Easier notification access, fitness tracking, sleep tracking (I have sleeping problems so measuring it is very important) and the information that can be displayed such as calendar events, alarms and reminders."
UCSC,fnq63oi,t3_g3ambx,1587158392.0,"You can apply (it wouldn't hurt to). It's highly likely that you won't get your preference of the room type or community you want, but if fall is still going to be affected by the outbreak then there maybe could be more on-campus housing availability? This can also go for off campus if people aren't willing to sign leases and stuff and would rather stay home for the rest of the year."
UCSC,fnk6y6v,t3_g21gir,1587016827.0,Nice! I'm not at 9/10 or Crown/Merrill but I also got the pay added too! It's likely thanks to them.
GalaxyWatch,fnifpvb,t3_g1m954,1586979215.0,"Galaxy Watch Active2 (40mm, bluetooth)."
UCSC,fnbj00v,t3_g0soec,1586816380.0,Correct.
UCSC,fn0qt9k,t3_fym2dy,1586546988.0,"Kim Cardilla for PSYC 181! Taking it slow and is very clear on what we should know, she's an absolute gem."
GalaxyS9,fmxsio1,t3_fxoqqh,1586471018.0,Most likely an S20 or S20+ (not the ultra) or one of the S10 phones. I'm integrated well within Samsung's ecosystem so the best option is to stick with it.
samsung,fmta0dk,t1_fmt32sv,1586369258.0,You can try GSM arena.
lanadelrey,fmqhs7m,t3_fwjopq,1586299869.0,"Not ironically, but it was something that randomly happened one day and the rest is history."
UCSC,fm58qrd,t3_ft6eqf,1585768407.0,god fucking damn it...
