ucr,foxnisr,t1_foxltcz,1588149733.0,I think all apartments are on campus except for Stonehaven and International village
ucr,fox2u0r,t3_g9zh63,1588132743.0,"Its not worth it. I stayed there this school year and I had so many issues there, as well as the stonehaven resident community. 

Its important to note that stonehaven is actually an off campus apartment that has a binding contract with UCR. Meaning UCRhousing doesnâ€™t have control over the apartment and the issues I ran into.

For a week many residents and I didnâ€™t have running hot water and management did a poor job being transparent with maintenance issues. This happened during flu season, it was the most miserable experience especially since I was sick

The place molds so easily. Thereâ€™s no ventilation in the bathroom and mold likes to grow so easily even when I open the windows all the time after I shower.

For two quarters, there was no wifi connection. People and I consistently voiced our complaints to management and it didnâ€™t improve at all. Even after the proposed date the wifi is supposed to be fixed, it wasnâ€™t. I had to spend longer days on campus and sometimes go home very late, which is not safe for female students. Even UCR housing gave a student a router to use at Stonehaven but had to keep it a secret.

The complimentary furniture are nice and the rooms are big. 

I will never recommend that place though. Find somewhere else"

According to a Forbes article today, BostonU, Harvard, Cornell, Purdue, and Brown are still considering to reopen campus in fall with some various conditions. I could anticipate us reopening in fall tho"

ucr,fotuuho,t1_fotu1vc,1588066931.0,"Iâ€™ve started my upper division this year, theyâ€™ve been all easy so far. However it gets tricky when it comes to the STATS 160 series. Thank you, if you attend UCR iâ€™ll try my best to help you out in your stats endeavor"
ucr,fottldk,t3_g9jfcp,1588065656.0,"I am a second year statistics major. The stats community is pretty small but its annoyingly hard to get classes due to the limited courses per quarter

My statistics friends either all dropped and switched their major to a more popular major because of how difficult it is to register for stats courses. Or they transferred to other colleges that had a bigger stats community. 

I realized no matter how further deep I get to the end of college, I will always deal with being waitlisted or try another quarter. I tried 4 quarters to get into an intro stats class because its impacted due to the amount of bio students who also need it. 

I wish our college could reserve or prioritize seats for stats student for their courses and invest in more faculty/computer labs.

I find the coursework to be easy and pretty light so far."
