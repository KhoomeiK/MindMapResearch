I’m concerned that if Fauci leaves and we get stuck with idiots, so I’d prefer if after this cools off/if trump loses reelection that Fauci testifies then and can be more honest rather than lying to keep his job and help prevent a worse outbreak next time"

I kinda assumed he would have gotten them back when he got his wings back but idk"

GreenBayPackers,foljqiq,t1_fol2wjz,1587863721.0,"Haven’t heard the rumors, but I would doubt that they want to trade him unless it’s for a big haul. He’s a second or third year player if I remember correctly and seemed to play well with Kyler Murray, so they’ll probably keep him as there other outside guy along with Hopkins and try to maximize Murray’s rookie deal"

nba,fo5fyqo,t1_fo5fl0s,1587524714.0,Probably would have been pulled before he got close to missing this many threes

nextfuckinglevel,fntj570,t1_fntcrxy,1587242704.0,"The six foot rule is based off of actual studies people have done to determine how far particles would travel. Cystic fibrosis patients who have compromised immune systems are taught to follow this rule in order to avoid getting illnesses from other people. 


Here’s a link to CNN article someone copied and pasted about it: [why 6ft](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/24/social-distancing-means-standing-6-feet-apart-heres-what-that-actually-looks-like/amp/) 


Here’s a short paragraph from the article that I found: 
‘The “6 feet of distance” rule comes from studies of respiratory physiology, said Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.’

I’m sure there’s more sources out there, this is just what I found with a quick search"

nbadiscussion,fmpc23y,t3_fwj6tz,1586278167.0,"I’d argue that having your bench be lesser versions of all of your starters probably doesn’t have the most appeal because certain teams may be bad matchups for certain players/play styles. 

You want to be able to play differently or be able to adjust lineups so that you can minimize your weaknesses and exploit the other teams weaknesses more easily. 

For example, there was a playoff game that the Cavs played a few years ago against Indiana where they were down by a bunch, and the Cavs subbed out certain players in order to create a 5 out offense around LeBron. They were able to ride this lineup to a comeback win, and that was due in part to having bench players with a different play style than the starters, and who could attack/defend the Pacers differently"
