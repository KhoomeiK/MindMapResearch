Repsneakers,fpmxdg9,t1_fpmwvzu,1588744218.0,check the insole tag. fake production date of 2019. they're trying to replicate the 2020 batch
Repsneakers,fpmcpsq,t1_fpmcebu,1588730226.0,"looks like Lin's the first one to have these (judging off of RepSNKRS QCs). Even has the correct (non-ironed) donning strap shapes. Trapezoid has a little bit of a lower curve to it but this isn't me QC'ing, just rambling."
Repsneakers,fpmcebu,t3_ge3byk,1588730036.0,"uh oh. Looks like this is the new H12 batch. I gave them some of my critiques in the past and looks like they took them (as damaging as that might be). My DHGate pair (and almost every single rep pair up until now) had one horizontal top row affixing the rear donning strap to the shoe (the real has 2). This broke on my pair and I wanted to buy a new one, but wanted to wait until a better batch that fixed the stitch flaw. As you can see, the corner stitch swoosh flaw is fixed (former H12 issue), double donning stitch is there, and NIKE tongue tab sizing is correct (things i told them to fix). My guess is that they're making these in preparation for the upcoming 2020 restock (you can see the production date on the insole). These are so close to being perfect. Tongue weight needs to be a LITTLE heavier, and the heel  suede shouldn't be flush with the heel counter. But damn. Had no idea there were new batches. LCing is going to be hard now with the donning update."
PandaExpress,fpmapom,t3_geajwl,1588729034.0,I really want to get one but don't want to burden the workers / want to thank them accordingly. Do you guys allow tips on delivery? Does Panda handle delivery or is it subcontracted?

Newbalance,fpbn3ed,t1_fpbjem6,1588473854.0,Japan loves their classic 80's silhouettes. Def pick up a pair of 1300CLs if you can.
ExNoContact,fp6qg8t,t3_gbhlzs,1588356814.0,"Dude... I've been through two breakups in my life; one where i lurked and one where I stayed away the whole time. It's so much better to stay away from it. Viewing their accounts is like an addiction. Remember after the breakup when you'd wake up every morning hoping they'd text you? constantly checking your phone hoping they'd reach out? It's like that feeling but worse‚Äìyou're constantly waiting for them to reach out to you through a vauge post or some mention of a memory. You will become so much stronger if you hold yourself to it. You'll feel so proud of yourself when you realize that YOU are in control of your emotions and your wants, not the other way around. Best of luck, it really does get better."

AskLosAngeles,fo5ad4h,t1_fo58t4t,1587520994.0,"Good to hear an outside's perspective. I can definitely agree with the pink-box $1 donuts as a so-cal staple, and am definitely a fan of the many X for $X fast food deals out there."

AskLosAngeles,fo55rkv,t1_fo55ikd,1587518111.0,there are plenty of meals around that price. You can go to most niche family businesses and walk out spending less than $10. I used NY's $1 pizza as a starting point as you normally walk out spending $3 (2 slices and a drink). This is more for curiosity than anything
