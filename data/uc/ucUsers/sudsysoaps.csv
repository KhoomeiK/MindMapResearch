UCSD,fphmya5,t1_fphmka9,1588624124.0,It’s ANBI 136 Human Comparative Neuroanatomy. My Professor has mentioned the best way to study is to draw structures to better understand everything so maybe I should start trying to do that more
sandiego,fpbjgxz,t3_gcge6s,1588471428.0,"Super bad in La Jolla. Have to keep apartment windows closed because of how awful it is, which isn’t ideal when you don’t have AC and minimal air flow haha"
gradadmissions,fo9mht9,t1_fo9kldk,1587623939.0,Thank you so much! I really appreciate the feedback. I have one professor who I’m taking a second and third class with currently (did really well in the first I took with her) and she definitely knows me but I’ve been putting more of an effort in to participate more outside of what is expected. Guess I have to just bite the bullet haha thanks again!
UCSD,fo8y70m,t3_g6cq4q,1587606350.0,Hi! My boyfriend was in your shoes a few quarters back and he’s a Cog Sci major. He told me to tell you that really for the tests everything you need is in his books. If you read both the books and take advantage of the TAs materials you’ll be fine for the tests!
UCSD,fo5vv8j,t1_fo5vcyt,1587537384.0,"If it’s safe to have it in person/optional in person I would obviously prefer that. I didn’t have the best experience my first year here so I was hoping my last year (this coming fall) would make up for it. Obviously if science is pointing in the direction that it’s not smart to go to school, I wouldn’t but I really hope we can haha"
UCSD,fo4s9ep,t1_fo4puic,1587510228.0,"When asking for LOR, what’s the best way to approach it in the initial email (I only say email instead of in person because of the distance learning haha)"
UCSD,fo368vd,t1_fo2gbhi,1587481320.0,"Yes I totally feel you. Especially with distance learning currently, I am worried about making those relationships. My app is due in January so realistically I need to ask my LOR writers by late September which basically means I have through summer to figure that out. I feel like as a transfer I just got here and it was hard to adjust to the UC system and all of a sudden I’m expected to have everything together in three quarters if I want to apply to grad school right away haha"
UCSD,fo1xu2e,t1_fo1o972,1587444108.0,"Thank you so much, this made me feel a lot better about everything. So many people told me that my jobs wouldn’t be a good idea to ask a LOR from since they aren’t in higher education, but I’ve been at one job for four years and my supervisor knows me like the back of her hand haha. Again I appreciate your comment!!"
UCSD,fo1nluo,t1_fo1jf8m,1587437250.0,That’s a great idea! I definitely don’t mind taking some time off between undergrad and grad so I’ll definitely look into it! Thank you :)
UCSD,fo1nk3f,t1_fo1hbsc,1587437219.0,Thank you!! Yeah I feel like as a transfer student I have been here long enough so I have this dumb mental block where I tell myself they won’t be interested. I’ll definitely reach out to some professors!!
UCSD,fo1d2fu,t1_fo1cjd6,1587430664.0,That sounds great!! Thank you so much!
UCSD,fo0bw2n,t3_g4z0s2,1587409933.0,I’m stoked it’s week 4 because that means the quarter is flying by and it will all be over soon but at the same time I’m like it’s week 4 and I don’t even know what’s going on in my classes hahaha
UCSD,fnq3ywj,t1_fnq1vg3,1587157231.0,And that’s facts
UCSD,fnq1biv,t1_fnpdxa7,1587155805.0,Yeah that’s true. I just feel like exams would be sketch because ideally they’d probably want to give it at the same time online as kids in class are taking it to prevent cheating and sharing test info. And then that means they’d need TA’s monitoring the zoom test as well as TA’s monitoring the kids in person. But I totally get wanting to have the option of being able to go to campus
UCSD,fnp3usi,t1_fno8q0m,1587138742.0,The only issue I see with optional in person is how professors would then be expected to run the courses in person and online for the kids who choose to stay home. I just don’t think it would be feasible
UCSD,fnfz9oa,t3_g1d7u3,1586918699.0,"Hi! I took ANTH 102 as it’s a major requirement for me. The class was structured with one take home midterm essay, one take home final essay, and three short ~2 page article reviews for articles we read through the quarter. The article reviews were super easy points as long as you followed what they asked for and the midterm and final were fairly easy as well. The essays weren’t graded on if your opinion was correct, but graded on how well you supported it with what you learned in the course. I don’t think it’s a ton of work but you do need to take time on the midterm/final with figuring out your opinion and what you’re going to use to support it ahead of time. I got an 80 something on the midterm and 100 on the final and ended with an A so I definitely recommend the class (a plus is it’s super interesting and there was lots of fun primate videos you got to watch haha) Not sure whose teaching it over summer but if Professor Hrvoj-Mihic is teaching she’s awesome!"
UCSD,fn3qma3,t1_fn3nfex,1586626010.0,Yes thank you I forgot to mention that! I transferred in as STEM and moved to a Bio Anthro major (BA) so Marshall ended up working better for me once I switched majors. Definitely looking into the colleges before transferring is key
UCSD,fn3jg9i,t3_fz3isj,1586621966.0,"I transferred to UCSD from a SD CC. I did the IGETC and it saved me. The IGETC basically waived all GE’s except for the few whichever college you get into at UCSD will make you do. I recommend completing your IGETC and any lower division requirements in your major that will transfer to UCSD (you can find that on assist). I was accepted into Marshall and only had to complete two extra GE’s with my IGETC, a few friends who transferred to the same college without IGETC had to complete more. When applying make sure you see how many GE’s with an IGETC each college will require you to do, that’s how I ranked which colleges I wanted on the application. Ones with the least GE’s with IGETC certification were my top choices. Marshall and Muir have the easiest transfer GE requirements. Hope this helps!!"
UCSD,fma8cux,t1_fm9u8nc,1585886471.0,Every time a student asks a question with no webcam on I’d just be like “God? Is that you?”
