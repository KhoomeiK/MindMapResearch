I work in the admissions office, and I can tell you right now, that we will be letting in 100% of the people on the transfer waitlist. 

With corona hitting the university hard, we've been issued guidance to admit as many students in as possible for the fall. We will be cramming 3 people into what was considered a ""single"" room dorm back as recently as 2013. Rooms that were quads in 2015 will now have 7 people. We are expanding some of our most popular math classes to 500 students. There will be issues with capacity, yes, but we are going to let the whole goddamn list in. It's the right move for the university right now.

The President himself employed illegal immigrants in his own hotel properties. You think he's going to all of a sudden kick them out? Come on, you know that isn't happening. 

Raising the minimum wage solves every problem you mention. If wages rise to market value in the agriculture industry, Americans will be willing to start working in industries dominated by those here illegally. If illegal immigrants are no longer able to find those jobs as easily, it disincentives them coming to the United States to begin with. Not only all this, but it actually gives hardworking Americans a payraise -- in many parts of the country, doubling their wages. This has multiplier effects, as they are now going to spend those dollars in their local economies. 

To your last point, if the minimum wage increase means that Starbucks and field work pays the same, then yes, you're right, the food producers will have to raise their offer to the fair market value. That's how competition and capitalism works. You said it yourself -- ""let the companies raise wages until they get the workers they need"". You've proven my point exactly."
