I know someone who ran into the same problem 3 days into their ownership and were told the same thing by Tesla. They obviously returned the car and refunded. Do the same if it’s an option because you DO NOT want to deal with Tesla’s paint shop procedures..."

teslamotors,fmyk495,t1_fmyjqat,1586488097.0,I thought about that! It’d be great if that works but I’ve “heard” something about how you cannot use the documentation/info of a deceased person (ie. their driver’s license etc.) to initiate transfers of assets or money in my state?? I’m not sure if this is entirely true though.
cars,fl5255c,t1_fl504z2,1584826786.0,"I posted on r/teslamotors and on TMC too. 

r/teslamotors downvoted me to hell and back and didn’t give much of an insight but on TMC I had some constructive convos which basically concluded that I was quite screwed at least until the range drops even lower (to a point when a replacement is warranted by Tesla) because Tesla intentionally set the standard limit to degradation so high that any legal attempt to lemon law the car or force any other legal push would get shut down immediately. Suggestions as to what’s technically wrong with my battery ranged from a bad BMS to a bad pack or bad thermal management but can’t really do much about it at the moment."
