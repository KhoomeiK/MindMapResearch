It's not hard to believe either. Let's say the general mis-packaging rate is 2.5% at Amazon (they accidentally give you a different thing). Amazon certainly has a database of every customer that's ever ordered something, and even more minute details like how many orders they've placed successfully vs. how many have been returned (possibly fraudulently). You can imagine they have a program detecting once they've passed a certain combination of a low order success % and raw amount of occurrences (ex. you return/claim it was not delivered 11% of the time, and have done this 8 times), you're flagged and sent in via a report for a human to look at it, and decide how they want to legally proceed."

Yellowstone’s best features are the awesome tourist attractions like Grand Prismatic Spring, Upper Geyser Basin, and of course Hayden Valley/Lamar Valley for the wildlife, but they’re not “views” per se. On the other hand, Yellowstone Canyon is badass and provides epic views of the Yellowstone River and its waterfalls, but that’s about it for extraordinary views. Avalanche Peak is cool, I suppose, but Yosemite just has so fucking many."

socalhiking,fphf38u,t1_fph9frq,1588620157.0,"For sure. I’ll add for people reading this that the trailhead for this loop is accessed via paved roads

That said, the road to Mosaic Canyon is unpaved/2WD. The road to telescope peak is a rough 2WD until the Charcoal Kilns, and then 2 miles of very rough high clearance 4WD to the trailhead. My Forester made it without scraping, but I could see how after any precipitation, this road would be borderline impassable. Other cool places like Eureka Dunes, Racetrack Playa are accessed by upwards of 30-40 miles of grueling 4WD roads. Come prepared lol"
socalhiking,fph88fq,t3_gdgxov,1588616697.0,"It’s not quite SoCal, but it’s closer than you might think, about 4.5 hours away from LA without traffic. If you’ve never been to Death Valley, I think the complete loop of Golden a Canyon-Red Cathedral-Zabriskie Point-Gower Gulch (~7.5mi) is one of the 10 best day hikes in the state, period. Insane geological formations all along this loop, you can see the striped rolling badlands here with the Red Cathedral, some fluted red rocky walls that glow a darker red during sunset.

When Death Valley reopens and the temperatures aren’t insane (Nov-March), I highly recommend heading out there. If you’re willing to make a whole weekend out of it, some other nice hikes in the area are Mosaic Canyon, and if you can time it right (think late fall), Telescope Peak."

LosAngeles,fovll9n,t1_fovkegb,1588103384.0,"I lived in Denver long enough to experience that some Coloradans seem to have a massive unwarranted superiority complex about their state.

Coloradans think they have the best hiking/outdoors in the country, which as someone who has lived in both places, is absolutely false. The only extraordinary part of the state is in the southwest (San Juans, Gunnison) and within RMNP. California has a huge variety of amazing and unique hikes in coastal areas lioke Big Sur/Redwood NSP, Desert hikes in Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Mojave NP, and of course the Sierras. It's not even a contest, honestly. The skiing is probably better and definitely more accessible, but I-70 is such a fucking mess on the weekends that it doesn't really even matter."

LosAngeles,fovi68b,t1_fov9piw,1588101729.0,"I grew up in Minneapolis. We should at least be honest about the winters. 

The average high in Minneapolis in January is LITERALLY 23. My definition of ""really bad"" is when the high temperatures are in the single digits or negatives, in which case, yeah, it's typically about a week or so. But shit starts getting into the annoyingly cold realm for most people below \~25 degrees high temperatures, in which case there are MONTHS of that. Snow is typically covered on the ground from the beginning of December to mid March, and you're going to have to shovel A LOT. You're going to have to leave earlier for work A LOT and you will probably end up losing control of your car on an icy bridge once every winter.

Spring takes place from mid-March to early May. God damn it's gross. Muddy everywhere, probably a snowfall here or there. Just not a great time.

But summer, dude. The summers are incredibly humid, and the high temperatures that are usually in the 80s feel way hotter than that because of that humidity. It rains a lot in Minnesota. Not Seattle, but definitely more than average. Mosquitoes are a big thing due due to the high humidity and lakes everywhere. There's a lot of beaches though. If you like beaches, there's a ton of lake beaches in Minneapolis.

Fall in Minnesota is the GOAT though. I visit every fall to make sure I get to soak it in. Especially from like mid-September to Halloween? Beautiful. Temps in the 50's. If you can get up north to cabin country or the boundary waters? God damn, one of the most beautiful parts of the country."

One thing that seems a takeaway here is that the justification of most of this is that it is in direct violation of the stay-at-home order. Should the stay-at-home order be eased up as they are in Colorado and other states that aren't completely batshit like Georgia, they're likely to reopen parks.

The letters are disappointing but their model cited does not back up a closure date as far out as June 30th. The model specifically for California has the state well below the point of critical mass."

It was the greenest hike I can remember doing in Southern California. It usually provides views of Ojai, which are fine, but I thought it looked better in the shroud of the marine layer.

Also stuffin that area of Los Padres is the SoCal capital of ticks, so bring some permethrin.
