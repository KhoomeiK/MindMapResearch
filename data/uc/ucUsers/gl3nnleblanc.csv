berkeley,fpdxcp6,t1_fpdr63n,1588536124.0,"I feel like the main issue with the projects is the super short specs (at least for proj1-3) on top of how inactive much of the staff seems to be on piazza. I imagine there's significantly less staff for 61C than for 61B which is probably the reason for this, but it's also really frustrating when your question goes unanswered for 6+ days just to be responded with some vague unhelpful one-word answer. Most of the time I don't even understand what the spec is asking us to do :( and office hours are ridiculous; you have to commit to not making any progress for 2+ hrs if you're actually stuck on something and want to make sure you get help with it."
berkeley,fpdvzga,t3_gcqs1f,1588535342.0,O babi this is not what I want to hear as I'm just starting task 3
berkeley,foo0vyi,t3_g894a1,1587930312.0,Unpopular opinion: this is a genius move to force students to P/NP. I'm willing to bet this professor was strongly advocating for a forced P/NP this semester and is doing this as a way to force their students to do so despite the administration's decision.
berkeley,foc2t0t,t3_g6rwvu,1587666468.0,"Seems like it's probably time to start making plans for deferral. For people planning to do so, what will you try to do for your gap semester? Remote internship?"
berkeley,fo1478y,t3_g4zeoe,1587425402.0,"Professor Vazirani is a great lecturer; you can judge for yourself at https://webcast.berkeley.edu. Avishay Tal has a few lectures [at the Simon's Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfVgiNNPVpo) and [at the Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmisseepEys) on youtube. Anecdotally, every professor I've had that's been involved with the IAS has been pretty stellar."
berkeley,fnpatpc,t1_fnp87s5,1587142253.0,"Yeah it's pretty cool in that it's half and half physics / CS students. On the first day the professor said ""either you'll need to work hard while we build up the quantum theory or you'll need to work hard when we start looking at algorithms, but I can assure you you'll be adequately confused by a portion of this class"""
berkeley,fnp59rm,t3_g34cml,1587139451.0,CS C191 + Physics 137A is a pretty dope combo
worldnews,fnmpx1m,t3_g2oyy1,1587075921.0,"This is not at all an accurate title, It's up to the states to reopen."
berkeley,fncsgbi,t1_fnc6vbm,1586845717.0,"I actually enjoyed it for how much it focused on conceptual ideas rather than computation. I've only taken math 110 and 113 though, so my perception is probably skewed. I really liked his lectures and how much effort it seemed he put into them; his class has been the only time I've seen a physics/math professor successfully pull off prepared slides. Assuming you're referring to Fall '18, I think it only got cut short because of the fires but yeah we definitely covered less than a usual offering would (did we even officially do the SVD?)."
berkeley,fnbqgwf,t3_g0qees,1586820307.0,"Favorite:

Physics 137B with MÃ¼ller (absolute GOAT)

Math 110 with Shin (absolute GOAT)

Physics 191 with Whaley (content moreso than professor)

CS 61B with Hilfinger (hands down most I've learned in a single course)


Least favorite:

Stat 134 (content of an upper div math class taught in a plug and chug way)

CS 61C (Conflicted about this one. I only dislike the content. It feels like a jumbled mess of disjoint ideas, as if they took all the leftover stuff that should be in a CS intro series after 61A and 61B and threw it into one class. The course also feels weirdly unstreamlined in comparison with 61A/B. That said, learning how a computer works at every level is extremely rewarding, and as the semester wraps up I'm starting to enjoy the material again more and more.)"
berkeley,fmxrmik,t1_fmxqk1g,1586470527.0,"Yeah, you hit the nail on the head. There's a bit of the same in 5B, but to a lesser extent. 5C and upper divs are a lot more engaging. FWIW I haven't taken 139 but I'd argue physics 137A and 137B could be taken with just math 110, so doing applied math with a concentration in quantum is definitely an option if you do decide to switch."
berkeley,fmxpkua,t3_fxy4iw,1586469413.0,"Personally 5A has been the hardest class I've taken at Berkeley (although this was probably due to coming in without AP physics C experience due to a mediocre HS or any knowledge of vector calc / linear algebra). I'd say keep taking classes as if you're double majoring and wait till 5C to decide if you want to switch. I was in the exact same boat as you: I didn't enjoy 5A or 5B nearly as much as my math classes, but 5C is where the fun modern topics really start. Physics 105 and 110A will be a lot like 5A and 5B, but they're still much more interesting. Virtually all of the other upper divs (even 112) involve the cool modern physics that probably drew you to the major."
berkeley,fmm45xd,t3_fvtpsu,1586198454.0,Snacks!
berkeley,flvpnln,t3_frecny,1585529160.0,"The best way to build a solid foundation for quantum computing is probably to just major in CS and take relevant courses as electives, since the field is highly interdisciplinary and there isn't a one-to-one major that covers all the ground you'll probably need. That said, if you're set on double majoring then unless you're interested in the physical implementation (hardware side), I would recommend majoring in cs + applied math with a concentration in quantum mechanics. Courses that are relevant for quantum computing: Physics 137A/B; Physics 221A/B; Physics 112; Physics C191; EE 120; EE 126; EE 127; CS 170; Math 113; Math 110; Math 118; Math 221; Chem 120A. Doubling in applied math will give you more freedom in exploring these electives and will also probably provide an overall stronger foundation for QC than majoring in physics."
