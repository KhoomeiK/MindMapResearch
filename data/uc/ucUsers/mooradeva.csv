UCI,fpl0gw0,t3_ge37k1,1588704207.0,I’m curious. What happens at pippin?
UCI,fp90mng,t3_gc3450,1588409762.0,"Honestly, I don’t think it’s devolved into a political mess. Most of the posts here are simple questions where we ask each other for feedback about classes, different majors, general thought or advice posts etc. 

The influx of political opinions or posts is just the result that it was/ it is ASUCI election season and a lot have changes have happened. These posts are reactions to whatever’s happening in that context and in the UCI campus community. But it’s by no means dominating the conversations in this subreddit. Also, Is it not better that we’re talking about ASUCI politics (good or bad) and getting involved or at least made aware? Finally, if you want more posts like you used to see on this subreddit why not just post some yourself?"
UCI,fp0aekg,t1_fp0aala,1588205489.0,Oops you’re right. I misread it and thought my enrollment window was May 11 not they’d be available to see then. Thanks for catching my mistake.
UCI,fp08qq0,t3_gakplr,1588204596.0,"Check your webreg. It should have an option to see your enrollment window and if they don’t have fall enrollment posted yet check the academic calendar for when enrollment window changes are released.

Update: just checked mine and the fall enrollment window is posted so yours should be posted too."
UCI,fotgx9s,t3_g9hlfo,1588053594.0,"Yeah it’s possible. Just don’t forget keep in mind how your gonna get to campus when choosing your off campus apartment. For example, are you gonna be walking like you could at UTC, taking public transport or driving and parking at UCI."
UCI,fotabjj,t3_g9677w,1588048413.0,Do you mean a study group for a specific class?
UCI,fopchte,t3_g8slgl,1587958076.0,"Yes. I love people I’ve meet here, the interesting classes, beautiful campus, and how the experiences at UCI shaped my personality for the better."
UCI,fogwhma,t3_g71ezy,1587757761.0,"I watch non-mandatory lectures or lecture recordings even if I went to the live lecture. It’s helpful for me to have either or both options in my classes so that I can get consistent exposure to the concepts by just watching. Also, if the lecture is recorded, I find it helpful to take notes from the slides before hand and following along with lectures"

UCI,fo64iea,t3_g5vstz,1587546206.0,"For your first question, I think you’d be better off asking this in r/lawschooladmissions. There’s a lot of helpful posts there for the whole application process beyond GPA/LSAT and could give you a lot of the insight you’re looking for in the recent and past posts. 

Also, my understanding is that your undergrad school does matter to law schools but exactly how much it matters depends a lot on which law school your applying to and what kind of undergrad program you’re currently in.They look at the difficultly of your classes, the quality of education and how your grades compare to other students around you in the program. All three of those school are great in terms of quality but it really does comes down to making the most of your time there and would you enjoy the time you spent there. 

Overall, the law school application process is very individualized and can leave a lot of room to make up for any iffy scores through any job, internship, volunteering or leadership experience you do in undergrad but do still try your hardest to keep those up. I’d say getting a 3.8+ GPA is doable at UCI you just have to stay on top of it each quarter and the difficulty can vary by what major you’re in or what classes you take. 

Hope this helps and isn’t overwhelming. I remember being a first year and worried about how to start prepping for law school so you’re not alone. 

Also, here’s a link to a comment/thread within 
r/lawschooladmissions that I think will be pretty helpful for this question. Good luck!

UCI,fo404vg,t3_g5d15d,1587495915.0,Congrats! :)
UCI,fnymqln,t3_g4lmz3,1587368058.0,"I feel like part of that answer depends on what you want to do after college.

Care to give some context?"
UCI,fnkh0ld,t1_fnkg8zr,1587026722.0,"Hey and it’s no problem. No, we haven’t had any more Zoom meetings. She said she’s not really gonna have any more for the rest of the quarter because some people might not be able to make it. Also she said that if she does have another Zoom she’ll put out an announcement for it. 

Hope this helps and that you have a good night :)"
UCI,fng5ttt,t3_g1k8nb,1586923037.0,How cute
UCI,fnf1wtn,t1_fnernhi,1586899899.0,Yeah only 4 videos are there.
UCI,fncpel4,t1_fncpcnc,1586843001.0,Sure
UCI,fncpcxy,t1_fncofp8,1586842963.0,Idk why I like her as a professor. Had her for SE 10 too and she was good there too.
UCI,fncp9ve,t3_g0zey1,1586842891.0,I’m taking the class. What kinda questions do you have?
UCI,fmpq7no,t3_fwhmus,1586285354.0,"I can’t speak for all sororities but you should be fine to join as a fourth year especially if you join in Fall quarter. In my experience, it only starts to get iffy if you were to join spring quarter of your 4th year because the rush process takes about a quarter and the sorority might want you to get the full experience of being an active member that wouldn’t really work or would be really minimized by rushing/ joining in Spring. If you have a sorority in mind (either in Panhellenic or MGC), reach out to them through their social and I’m sure they’d be glad to help. :)"
UCI,fmg0khv,t3_fv1we8,1586038760.0,"There should be an abbreviation key for the restrictions at the bottom of the page. This is what I found from the bottom of the chem page:

“WL column entries like ""off(3)"" indicate the department turned off the course waitlist; this can prevent new students from adding the course if it is almost full. Students on the waitlist must be removed from the waitlist via WebReg during enrollment periods to allow maximum enrollment into the course.” 

Hope this helps and sorry if that’s the case for you."
