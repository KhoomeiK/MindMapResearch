TeachforAmerica,fpel84l,t1_fpe5j7o,1588549706.0,"I agree, I'm still in corps but almost every time I mention it to someone, I ALWAYS find at least one person in the group who is a TFA alum, they love to go ""Hey! I did TFA"" (HA) from recently an alum to several several years already. It's def pretty clutch/interesting"
TeachforAmerica,fp4dxs4,t1_fov3i3l,1588296989.0,"You might. I've heard it happen before for people with medical and other emergencies, but it would probably have to be for a good reason."
TeachforAmerica,fp4djhn,t3_g9d7db,1588296750.0,"You def should be placed there, I was early admit last year for this year's corps and was told to explain as much as possible in the special circumstances box and to make my top choice the only option for the top tier spot, and list all my other choices in the second and third tier. Don't be anxious!"
TeachforAmerica,fp4daal,t3_gb8aix,1588296599.0,"I'm really sorry to hear! You could email them about it, let them know the situation and if there's any support available. What about also asking for a region re-assignment? Somewhere closer?"
TeachforAmerica,fp1ffak,t3_gao92p,1588233695.0,"Yes, you definitely need to let your region staff know! It could cause issues if not addressed first. 

Edit: I guess it might depend on your region, but in CA they def let us know before getting our background checks done that people with anything expunged should let staff know to avoid credentialing blocks."
berkeley,fozetgf,t3_ga4voh,1588189462.0,I had a class there this semester... my last semester... :(
TeachforAmerica,foih43s,t1_fohzdpn,1587786508.0,Are you sure? Did you check the attachments at the bottom of the email? That's really weird. Try their onboarding website to see if they have a section for interviews?
TeachforAmerica,fohlxbu,t3_g7h4qf,1587768152.0,"Your regional placement’s literal job is to support you with this! They should have resources, videos, sheets/docs full to help you prepare for interviews with their partners. When they called you to say you have an interview coming up, did they say they’ll send you an email with prep resources?"
AskReddit,fo9qxvr,t3_g69kfu,1587628071.0,"A girl was getting eaten out by her bf in the back of the school. I asked the janitor to open the bathroom for me and he saw it to, telling them to pull their pants up. God. Lol"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fo1zapv,t3_g524qx,1587445207.0,A lot of people in this world should not be having kids. Shit like this is all too common.
berkeley,fn97cp5,t1_fn8x7lu,1586761999.0,"Under “enrollment” and then under “drops” it says that l&s will not penalize drops under 13 units however that is usually for them to not send you that “warning message” and it DOES say that if you are on federal financial aid, you should discuss this decision with the financial aid office. I doubt that federal regulations on unit requirements have changed, I would just play safe and keep the class. It’s p/np anyways, unless you actually need it for something and think you can do better another semester."
