Petioles,fpn05xs,t3_ge6yzy,1588746357.0,"Just be aware of how you’re using it. If it ever starts affecting you negatively, I’d say quit for a while. I noticed back in November I was using it to suppress my depression, and it was making me extremely anxious, so now I’m 5 months into a tolerance break.

Weed can be really beneficial. It definitely used to help me out with anxiety, figuring myself out, and looking at things from a new perspective. But sometimes it can inhibit you from growing rather than help you grow.

I think responsible cannabis use depends on your current mental state, and also how often you use it. Like I would say don’t get high all day every day. You should be able to attend work/school and shit like that sober."

Meditation,foz404l,t1_foxd887,1588184304.0,It really is. I’ve definitely found a lot of paradoxes in act of meditating. I honestly think those paradoxes are what makes it so difficult some times.
Meditation,foz3tiv,t1_fowuoat,1588184215.0,"Honestly, no. Just the classic focusing on your breath works for me. The more you do it and practice it, the better you get at controlling your thoughts during the day. Try focusing on your breath during some daily activities too, not just while you’re closing your eyes and actively meditating. Stopping day dreaming really takes a lot of effort; your mind will desperately try to wander into those same habits, but just try to always be aware of your thoughts. When they start popping up, be aware of it, and focus on your breath again."

Meditation,fovgml9,t1_fotdw6z,1588100983.0,The only “point” to meditating is grounding yourself in the present moment. That’s it. Expecting benefits means thinking about the future.
Meditation,fovfz87,t3_g9odc6,1588100670.0,"It’ll be hard, trust me. Coming from a fellow day dreamer, your mind wants so badly to keep running at 800 miles per hour. But just start meditating. It can be really simple at first, don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Just focus on your breath, and if your mind starts wandering, that’s okay. Focus on your breath again. After some time and practice, you might find yourself more able to let go of day dreams. A big key to this is becoming familiar with your thought patterns and having the self discipline to stop yourself from going down a thought rabbit hole when one presents itself. Good luck!"
Meditation,fovfb5w,t3_g9okc2,1588100351.0,"I used to meditate with a timer, but recently it’s just been too much of a hassle. I started meditating without one and honestly it works about the same, at least for me"
Meditation,fovf02g,t3_g9pa3w,1588100205.0,"Definitely takes time. Meditation is a practice that will get better the more you do it. All you need to do is focus on something in the present moment, like your breath. Your mind will wander, but just notice it and put your attention on the present again.

It *will* be hard at first and you’ll feel your mind pushing away from the present. It doesn’t want to die. It takes a lot of concentration and effort to make sure your attention is in the right place. When it comes down to it, it’s really a simple choice to keep your focus on something like your breath. But again, it’ll take time to get there. Just keep meditating for now."
Meditation,fovehk4,t3_g9pn9q,1588099964.0,"It can definitely be like that for a while. But you gotta let go of the sensation, because ironically, when you get excited about this feeling or start thinking about it, you’re thinking about the past and taking yourself out of the present moment. Just keep focusing on the present and you’ll be good :)"
Meditation,fove6zy,t3_g9rnua,1588099825.0,"Whenever I have noise come up during meditation, I try to focus my attention on the silence that underlies the sound. There’s silence that supports every sound in the world. It’s actually super relaxing. I like meditating in public just so I can do this sometimes."
spirituality,for7dk1,t3_g8ygrm,1588007427.0,"Exactly. I don’t think the point of this spirituality stuff is to label your ego as “wrong.” Rather, it’s to be able to observe it and let it do its thing. Nothing is “wrong” with that. You are living in a human body which is bound to come with thoughts and emotions. Don’t suppress that. Accept it, feel it, embrace it."
Petioles,fobp316,t3_g6h3ab,1587662125.0,"i started an extended t-break 5 months ago so my cravings are long gone. but the beginning is always the hardest because of those cravings. you just gotta get through it and then it keeps getting easier and easier. find new things to do that you can enjoy sober like reading, writing, exercising, meditating, etc.

i am a student though and have like 8 hours of classwork a day which definitely helps with the boredom. but if you find things to do instead of getting high its a lot easier."

antiMLM,fnzspfp,t1_fnyuhcg,1587400083.0,"it really is well disguised to look good. a lot of pyramid schemes have continuous investments that aren’t refundable, so you’re most likely bound to lose money. with monat, it’s just a one time investment where you get the products with a 30 day money back guarantee. so there really isn’t a ton to lose if you just wanna try it out. also it’s just such a big company, you’d think it’s legit. when i tried googling it, so many reviews were praising how great it is to work at the company. the products look great, the people seem empowering, it seems like an easy way to make money, etc. but the only way to do all this successfully is to exploit innocent girls and message random people that you haven’t talked to in years to sell them a product. even if it did work and was ethical, that’s just such an embarrassing thing to do and i would like to keep my dignity please lol"

antiMLM,fnsw8xj,t1_fnse4t4,1587229989.0,"ah okay that makes sense. but yeah, she also told me last night, and i quote (but paraphrase) “monat is an MLM [company]. it is a pyramid scheme but it’s different from others.”"
antiMLM,fnsvyqk,t1_fnsikg0,1587229838.0,"she said she made about $600. i can’t see how that’s possible, but she seemed gunuine. i just can’t believe anything she told me since her profit is based on convincing girls to join"
antiMLM,fnsvood,t1_fnsot5t,1587229687.0,i mean she told me she’s already made a profit. i believe she’s successfully recruited a lot of people already

antiMLM,fnrm81r,t1_fnrjxf3,1587193491.0,for sure. i definitely see that she’s a good person who truly believes in the good of the company. but she’s totally respecting my stance that it’s a scam for some people. she just joined last month so hopefully she’ll see the problems with it after a while

antiMLM,fnr76tg,t1_fnr5uhi,1587180990.0,"there’s definitely confirmation bias involved. but yeah, i was googling everything about the company and it was mostly all good reviews. i swear they pay someone to get the good reviews at the top of google searches. i didn’t back out until i found this sub. reddit’s a godsend. but yes, these girls really believe their company is different. i’m sure a lot of them don’t even know what harm they’re doing. it’s just a huge mess that people on top are totally aware of, and it’s so sad to see. the girls trying to recruit me apparently made profits quickly, but i know they recruited a lot of girls recently who probably won’t make any money."

antiMLM,fnr596t,t1_fnqudc1,1587179613.0,"i really was gonna be nice and just tell her i changed my mind without explaining why, but she asked.

so i told her “i looked more into MLMs and it seems like, yes, there’s a way to make a big profit, but that’s only if you work hard to recruit a lot of people and exploit girls who usually won’t end up making a lot of money. also i looked into monat’s products and saw that they can cause hair loss and i don’t really want to be a part of selling that.”

she literally responded with a 5 minute voice memo explaining how they’re different from other MLMs and the science behind how their hair products work.

i asked “can i just ask how much money you’ve made from sales vs recruiting others?”

she just told me how much she made overall without differenciating between sales commissions and money from recruitment.

i just told her that she seems nice but that i believe this company is an MLM well disguised as a friendly and empowering business.

i didn’t wanna be too bitchy but yeah it was still very satisfying lmao"
antiMLM,fnr4itc,t1_fnr1dhz,1587179108.0,"i was looking into the company and i trust reddit. i came across this sub by searching for monat in the search bar. i was kinda skeptical that it was a pyramid scheme disguised pretty well as a friendly, empowering business and this sub confirmed my suspicions. i was gonna try it out anyway, but i’m really glad i didn’t lol. i’m not stupid, i’ll always dig deep to find the best information on stuff like this"

Petioles,fnbcvcs,t1_fnallcx,1586813287.0,"the cravings might make it seem like you need to give in sometimes, but just know that it’s purely psychological and it will get better. the craving will pass. the longer you go, the easier the t-break gets. i haven’t had cravings in a long time. i still miss it sometimes, but it’s not like i feel the need to do it. and if you ever get cravings just do something to distract yourself like exercising or reading.

The intonation’s a little off in some places, and to hit higher notes I think you’re lowering your larynx. If that’s the effect you’re going for though, don’t mind me."
