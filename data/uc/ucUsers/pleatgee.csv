WatchPeopleDieInside,fpcfm89,t1_fpcetgt,1588498761.0,He’s so condescending and impolite. I feel bad for the people that have to deal with him
WatchPeopleDieInside,fpcfii6,t1_fpceted,1588498648.0,I mean what kind of context would justify that sort of nastiness?
WatchPeopleDieInside,fpcerc7,t3_gci17e,1588497815.0,That guy is so mean for no reason? I also find her boring bit like Mind your own business sir. It costs 0 dollars to stay in your lane and not spoil someone’s day?

WatchPeopleDieInside,foxrpbh,t1_foxb6jb,1588153940.0,Lol thank you for the insight. This helps actually
WatchPeopleDieInside,fox92al,t1_fox8zui,1588137173.0,I mean I wouldn’t say stupid. A little close minded maybe?
WatchPeopleDieInside,fox8xey,t1_fox7dcu,1588137071.0,Yeah I guess if she was super polite and pleasant the show wouldn’t be very entertaining.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fox8ufd,t1_fox6k84,1588137006.0,She just seemed subtly close-minded/mean when he said he used it. I guess her reaction shocked me when it seems like he’s hosting her in his house(?). I also didn’t like that she didn’t offer to clean up at all
WatchPeopleDieInside,fox8l35,t1_fox5jtl,1588136808.0,Yeah I think I’m def missing some context here

TwoXChromosomes,fn618ae,t1_fn3r0jq,1586683454.0,Could you explain what you mean? I’m not really familiar with the subject matter. Does the Mormon church has a history of domestic abuse scandals or something? Like the Catholic Church and sexual abuse?
Journaling,fmzafwv,t3_fxwlld,1586512846.0,"I like to read them to remember certain times of my life like certain boyfriends or girlfriends. I also kind of like reading them and cringing, because it means I’ve become a better person. That gives me hope."
