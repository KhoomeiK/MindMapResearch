StarWarsBattlefront,fpfkan9,t1_fpfjsuk,1588573873.0,after taking the Skywalker name she took Finn's ethnicity too
StarWarsBattlefront,fpc7ib0,t1_fpc69xt,1588490234.0,"Yeah it's clear they never play test their updates :( 

EA should be accountable for being incompetent like this; they're in the gaming industry and they can't even make polished, working games"
StarWarsBattlefront,fpc7es8,t1_fpc63p3,1588490140.0,"I really wanna keep playing but it's getting intolerable these days between crashing and balancing issues lmao. I play on US Virginia server, dm me if you wanna group sometime"
PrequelMemes,fpalnax,t3_gccsn4,1588450717.0,where's Jar Jar
StarWarsBattlefront,fp9plro,t1_fp9n6p6,1588431850.0,"Most people stay the majority of the match in my experience, I'm just making a meme about the fact that with how OP the dark side is, it's become more common (at least in my and my friends' experiences) to see people wreck as dark side then leave when they have to play light side, but obviously some people leave because they are done playing"
StarWarsBattlefront,fp9jt1x,t1_fp9inxd,1588427997.0,"The meme is in reference to people quitting between rounds on the same map, no matchmaking involved lol"
StarWarsBattlefront,fp606ha,t1_fp5yhfq,1588343552.0,"I've found that being a mile away doesn't help! Grievous closes the distance very fast using claw rush (or even thrust surge), and even if you manage a few shots at him crawling to you, the ability's damage reduction makes all your efforts useless

rip blaster heros"
dankmemes,fp5r5de,t1_fp5qylg,1588337949.0,yeeeeaah I'm still trying to figure out which sizes and resolutions reddit wants to compress and which it likes
StarWarsBattlefront,fp5i6em,t3_gbbyln,1588330272.0,"*tried* to play Han earlier... between the Vader focusing blasters with choke and the Grievous just running me over til I died, being a lightside blaster has never felt more impossible than now"
StarWarsBattlefront,foxv8bt,t1_foxv5mc,1588157432.0,yeah I can't find much other than co op these days :(
UCSD,folnl23,t1_folkqb7,1587866173.0,"You're welcome! 

That sounds terrible haha, but you got through it!"
UCSD,folnhao,t1_foleuxx,1587866107.0,you're welcome ðŸ˜Š
Humanoidencounters,foj5gg9,t3_g7c8u3,1587809130.0,"My friend and I both saw a faceless man just like you described! We were dicking around in an empty playground at night and noticed him sitting in a car across the road with the interior lights on.

Freaked us out so we quickly went home, didn't look back. No idea what it was, but we've had other paranormal experiences in the area so we were kinda used to just moving on lol"
StarWarsBattlefront,fn1uqs6,t1_fn1u02p,1586570578.0,"Yeah it seems like there's a new cheat every week. I wish dice would focus on quality over new content but so many of these issues have existed since launch, I think it's likely the game will be dead on pc very soon because of all this. Personally, the game is simply not enjoyable anymore :("
StarWarsBattlefront,fn1thkm,t1_fn1t46m,1586569726.0,"I'm on US Virginia and can only find about one or two active lobbies per game mode. My internet is fine, I've just noticed over the past few weeks that there's less people playing/more time spent waiting for minimum number of players and have seen many people in chat saying they're quitting the game due to hacking"
StarWarsBattlefront,fn1t5v9,t1_fn1sw3c,1586569511.0,Damn that's a shame. Unacceptable that dice allows cheaters to bully people off the pc platform and given them enough confidence to cheat on consoles as well
UCSD,fmrflm5,t1_fmretyk,1586321770.0,"Damn, that sounds rough :( I'm wishing you the best. Hopefully professors are more lenient this quarter given these crazy circumstances"
UCSD,fmox6n9,t1_fmov2j5,1586270257.0,"I definitely feel that lmao, I can already tell it's gonna be a rough quarter. It's Week 2 and I already feel so far behind"
gaming,fmi56xj,t1_fmi2kja,1586102657.0,"Just have fun with it! Imo the game itself isn't *super* challenging, and the stealth archer build is pretty op, but you should take the time to develop your own skillset and build up your character as you want. Try everything and use what you like! Skyrim's beauty is in how much freedom it gives the player."
