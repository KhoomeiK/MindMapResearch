UCSC,fozr0da,t3_ga9hr5,1588195351.0,"I’m curious, what does the graffiti say?"
NoStupidQuestions,foxr2qe,t3_g9nlna,1588153311.0,"I’m an introvert and I really like being alone. But I’ve also never had my own room! I had sisters growing up and a single room of my own is too expensive for me to rent. I actually have a hard time sleeping unless I’m sharing a room with someone..

Luckily, I’ll room with extroverts or people who don’t stay in their rooms (sometimes they’ll crash in the living room). If I ever see the bedroom empty, i usually just stay in there until it’s not. If I haven’t been able to get some time to myself, I’ll just put on some headphones and ignore people for a bit. Seems the same to me"
UCSC,fowtagz,t3_g88640,1588126681.0,Try asking in our Facebook group..a lot of our art students aren’t even on social media
UCSC,fows52k,t1_fowm7zn,1588125980.0,Hell if I know. I’m a graduating senior too and I’m not getting my photos taken...it’s better to be safe than sorry
UCSC,fovvho2,t3_g9rf8a,1588108236.0,Why risk it when you can take grad pictures some other time? Stay home and be considerate to others please

SFBayJobs,fom4gjc,t3_g84g2n,1587878053.0,Do you have any examples I can look at?
AskPhotography,folqv24,t3_g80lgq,1587868345.0,I’m not too sure what this has to do with the lockdown or how this is a story. Usually a photo essay even includes captions. The photos themselves have pretty good lighting though!
sanfrancisco,fol6yy0,t3_g7xfc6,1587856102.0,"I’d recommend going back to this location with a tripod and set up your camera for two exposures! I think this photo would be extra pretty if it wasn’t so dark. I understand that the darkness is framing the bridge, but imagine being able to see the beautiful trees!"
nintendo,fok8qhg,t3_g7vuf0,1587837498.0,I’m looking forward to getting my photography career started!
Lightroom,fohdtga,t1_foh49wt,1587764282.0,I’m pretty sure clarity isn’t any help here? I think you’d want your darks down for that weird gray haze. And clarity doesn’t help with the red/green emphasizing the photo has...

premiere,fo4mm67,t3_g5kp18,1587507176.0,Yo!! It’s that one church in a plaza in Spain! I’d recognize the scaffolding anywhere
UCSC,fnyqt14,t3_g4o3lp,1587372171.0,Remember to continue to self-quarantine!
UCSC,fny7d99,t1_fny1xlp,1587355230.0,"Op, the post you’re looking at is 5 weeks old. Probably safe to assume you should be checking your emails for updates instead"
UCSC,fny7bg3,t1_fny63sr,1587355195.0,"Op is probably referring to this one
