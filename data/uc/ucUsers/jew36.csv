ABCDesis,fpjk21s,t3_gdjurk,1588671444.0,"I'm a ""born-again"" Hindu I'd say. I gave up my religion for a few years because I thought being an atheist was cool(had no real philosophical backing). I don't do aarti and pooja and personally don't like that as it's time consuming and I never really understood it. However, I do enjoy Bhajans(hare ram hare ram is a banger and you can't convince me otherwise), I do enjoy the history and I would say I'm a spiritual and philosophical Hindu - I believe in karma, moksha, ahimsa, dvaita but in general don't believe in deities. 

I like to read Hindu epics, question what it means to be a Hindu, the future of Hinduism, and have a general love for the religion and its history. It is, after all, thousands of years old."

ABCDesis,fpjgdyc,t3_gdfsc8,1588667501.0,"I hate the term ""fob."" It's used to classify our community and is used as an insult. 

I moved here when I was seven. I have spent most of my life in the United States. I identify as both Indian and Indian American and I believe this gives me a unique perspective into my identity. This is one of the most xenophobic posts I have seen in a while. 

Let's not forget that a huge number of us are either immigrants or children of immigrants. Our community already deals with an insane amount of racism, and I don't at all support dividing up our community more than it has been. Let's not use a term to insult someone based on the **nation they were born in**. All it does is justify racism and xenophobia against a community who may not ""be American enough."" 

 I'm not sure what I would have done moving here if I didn't have a support system and Indian-Americans shunned me for being an immigrant. I think we should show each other mutual respect and not degrade each other on the birthplace and rather celebrate our Indic-ness. 

There's no purity test to being American, there's no overarching American identity. Let's just show each other love and respect in these trying times."

But the problem is, a very small minority of US workers work in STEM! These billion dollar companies need a reliable population to sustain themselves and this isn‚Äôt doing the US economy any good. The US generates 65k IT workers and India generates 360k. We supplant the USs need and Trumps move is stupid.
