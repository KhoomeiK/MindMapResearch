allamericanrejects,fntx2zj,t1_fnsujus,1587250257.0,hmm I guess you have a pretty interesting point there! never thought about it from a lyrics standpoint. i just think sonically the song sounds absolutely beautiful. and it makes me sad seeing when the world comes down put low on some people's list just because i love it so much haha. but for sure i think i'll make my own! how exactly did you make it?

sandyalexg,fnn03g1,t3_g2qhb7,1587081590.0,"i think maybe if your show got ""postponed"" then it won't be refunded automatically unless it was actually cancelled entirely, at least that's the impression i got"
