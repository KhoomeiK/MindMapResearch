tifu,fn8zx6s,t3_g0bz27,1586754968.0,"i understand what you’re going through. sometimes we can’t help but stop functioning and duck in cover, it’s in our biology. you just want to feel safe from all that’s going on. but i’m sure you don’t want to let this mishap alter the course of your life. contrary to common opinion, i think it’s best that you get the rest you need, find the motivation in yourself once more (sounds like you were on a roll) and get back into the cycle of things. 

this is possible mainly because of the pandemic and quarantine. people, your administrators, peers, family, and friends will be more than understanding, if you simply make it known that your crisis was caused in part due to the virus. this is a troubling time, and people are struggling. you should be able to accept the sympathy of those you need it from, and get back on top of things. 

that said, take your time, and only do what you want. however, i don’t want you to fall out of everything you’ve worked towards. don’t give up."
