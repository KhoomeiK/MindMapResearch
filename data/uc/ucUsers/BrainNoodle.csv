Her mom was so pissed at me.

Fast forward 6 years. I'm in my hometown, and I see her at church. Her mom says hi and says we have some catching up to do. We end up going out to dance, and spent a lot of time talking afterwards. I said we should srart writing letters, she says yes. I'm thrilled, thinking we're gonna rekindle feelings. 

In her first letter she tells me that she's actually engaged, and I should meet her fiancé.
