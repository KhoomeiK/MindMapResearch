The hotel in the picture (back/left) is 2129 Shattuck Ave. right beside BAMPFA. It's still under construction, and I used to live close to all the noise when I took CS 70. The building to the right is 432 Park Avenue in New York City, which I thought would fit Minecraft well given its design. Also, my Minecraft username is Sowm!
