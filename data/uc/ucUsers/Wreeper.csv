UCSantaBarbara,fn1a3of,t1_fn195gb,1586557813.0,"yea iâ€™m with ya, i get pissed enough when people waste time asking stupid questions or making jokes with the professor so iâ€™m sure that would be be annoying. plus if theyâ€™re recorded and posted she can for sure just go back and watch it lol think smarter not harder people smh"
UCSantaBarbara,fn18555,t3_fyps2g,1586556692.0,"if the questions are relevant it doesnâ€™t really matter whoâ€™s asking it, but if your prof said they prefer questions in section then yea maybe shoot the prof an email addressing it. but idk why they wouldnâ€™t just disable the chat/video if they were trying to save lecture solely for lecture, sounds like an easy fix by the prof"
