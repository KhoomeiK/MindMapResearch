espresso,fpmuk8m,t1_fpmu6nj,1588742126.0,"While stretching, the wand is just barely in the milk and you should be hearing the signature paper tearing sound. The milk usually won't be swirling here. The milk will increase in volume during this phase and you will have to lower the pitcher periodically as the milk rises. Next, you will plunge the wand a bit deeper in the milk and angle it so the milk is actively swirling around. Continue this until the milk is nice and hot."
espresso,fpmtwq5,t1_fpmpipq,1588741620.0,"I had this issue for the longest time and could not figure it out at all. I finally realized that I wasn't properly incorporating the air into the milk. After you stretch the milk for a bit, you need to make sure you get a nice vortex going until the milk is good and hot. The stretching helps add a lot of air to the top of the milk, and the vortex distributes it throughout. Now I can have 100% microfoam in my pitcher if I want."

DunkTank,fplyvaf,t3_ge05du,1588722146.0,"Yeah anytime Leah streams, tons of people ask about what happened to dunk tank and she doesn't acknowledge the questions at all. I'm sad that something big probably happened, and even though I know there will never be another episode, I would at least like to have some closure in the form of info."
StardewValley,fplrwu5,t1_fplrpbt,1588718301.0,"Penny = sadder, less mature Leah"
StardewValley,fplpu4v,t3_gdwp7x,1588717182.0,"There is too much Leah shit talk in this thread. She has never been anything but a loving wife, mother, and companion. She's always there in the morning to greet me with a hot cup of coffee to help me start my day off right. She doesn't ask for diamonds or prismatic shards to be happy, she just wants one of her favorite salads from the saloon. She a beautiful and pure soul, and I won't have anymore bashing on this thread. I'm sorry for all of you who have tricked yourself into believing that Penny and Abigail even come close."
GloriousTomBombadil,fphkufm,t3_gd2ctq,1588623049.0,"I love our Tom, but the amount of times I've had to explain why the eagles couldn't just take them to mordor is rediculous. Imagine if you also had to constantly explain who Tom is and what he couldn't be useful to the west in the war of the ring."

espresso,fo0x1bg,t1_fo0wyvh,1587421374.0,Great I'll try that out. Mine always end up a bit on the hot side and it doesn't seem quite right.
dankmemes,fo0wmhw,t3_g4zhw8,1587421151.0,Did we all forget that reaction memes were banned? Plus this is a dog shit repost in the first place.
espresso,fo0wgv6,t3_g50k2p,1587421065.0,How hot do you steam your milk? I've heard that cortados should be served a bit cooler as they're supposed to be immediately ready to drink.

UCSantaBarbara,fnxhwc3,t1_fnwpkm4,1587338971.0,"There are ways to separate your study area from your sleeping area that I have found very helpful. First, I make sure that when I wake up, I shower and get dressed as I would if I had to go to an in person lecture. It helps me get in the right mindset. Studies have also shown that doing something as simple as putting up a partition, even if it's a sheet hanging from the ceiling, can help you mentally separate your work space from your sleeping area. When you're in work mode, go fully into work mode. Put your phone away, and focus on the work. If you need to take a break, leave the work space instead of taking the break at your desk/table. Obviously, this is all personal but hopefully it get help you get some rest."
lotrmemes,fnpucxv,t1_fnpsnv8,1587152161.0,Ent sized sad :(
lotrmemes,fnprjs6,t1_fnpph9m,1587150689.0,"You are correct. It is most likely that the entwives were killed when Sauron's forces burned the brown lands (the place where the entwives tended crops). It's possible that some were enslaved or fled to the East, never to be seen again."
Silmarillionmemes,fnjktui,t1_fnjks5e,1587001076.0,"No problem, I really like thinking about the blue wizards lol"
Silmarillionmemes,fnjiq2i,t1_fnjfwc9,1586999798.0,"On page 385 of *The Peoples of Middle-earth, ""Last Writings""* Tolkien notes that Alatar and Pallando  'must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of East ... who would ... otherwise have ... outnumbered the West.'

So the Blue Wizards were still essential in the the fight against Sauron's control. Without them, when the forces of the East were summoned to march against the men of the West, they would been far greater in number. Of course, they still ultimately failed as it seems they became distracted and it is likely that became involved with cults that the people of the East formed around them because of their power. They helped a lot, but Tolkien says in no uncertain terms that the only one of the Istari to remain faithful to his task was Gandalf (I guess Manwe did something right). The Blue Wizards were also tasked with rooting out Saurons dwelling place during the Watchful Peace and failed."
yunggravy,fnie3e2,t1_fnidvg9,1586978438.0,Baby has so many slept on bangers. I still discover singles I've never heard from time to time
yunggravy,fnidian,t1_fnid6jx,1586978158.0,"Yeah I love Gravy, but I burned out a bit. It's good to take a break to listen to other stuff and then get back on the Gravy train"
yunggravy,fni53sx,t3_g1wbmw,1586974131.0,"Probably because he hasn't released anything in a while. A few months ago he was building a lot of hype for baby Gravy 2. They were releasing a bunch of singles and hyping up the album on social media. Right now it's just in a dip until Gravy starts teasing something new.

Plus Gravy isn't on tour anymore so that would contribute to a decline in listeners as well."
Silmarillionmemes,fni2xo9,t3_g1sbdk,1586973079.0,"While the blue wizards ultimately failed in their quest, Tolkien did say that they weakened the forces of the East considerably. If they had not successfully turned much of the East against Sauron's will, they surely would have overwhelmed the west as they were much greater in number, if not in quality. Of course they still strayed from their mission so.."
UCSantaBarbara,fngophu,t1_fngonuj,1586939335.0,Wait you haven't been tipping??
UCSantaBarbara,fngmzvx,t3_g1mfs3,1586937611.0,"I'll be tipping more than usual, so anywhere from 20-30% due to how much work some of them are putting in to make this quarter work. Of course, performance varies so I'll be determining the tip based on how much they work with the class to make this quarter reasonable."
espresso,fn9eztj,t1_fn9eukw,1586770410.0,So you shook the chocolate powder straight onto the Espresso and then poured your steamed milk? It looks fantastic. I'll have to try it.
