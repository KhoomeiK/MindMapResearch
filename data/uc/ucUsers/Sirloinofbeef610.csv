prelaw,fpdpvky,t3_gb08x9,1588531834.0,Yeah the whole online learning thing will make them more understanding of pass/no pass grades
santacruz,fpbsnqv,t3_gcbccf,1588477721.0,Absolutely incredible. Amazing work
lawschooladmissions,fpbkj1w,t3_gcf2d9,1588472123.0,Mind sharing your softs?
LSAT,fp6ojr4,t3_gbmdrz,1588355881.0,A tip I’ve been told is that if one question is taking extra long or feels really hard you can skip it entirely if it means getting to finish another 2 or 3 questions down the line that you wouldn’t have
lawschooladmissions,fp6nzup,t3_gb7dze,1588355615.0,I think the best way you can mitigate stuff like this is only asking advice/questions that would have a single objective answer and other things like decisions on where to go should be taken with a grain of salt
OutsideT14lawschools,fp15mih,t3_gaocmc,1588225066.0,Congrats on UCI!
lawschooladmissions,fowtt7y,t1_fovf86d,1588126998.0,I’m also curious

lawschooladmissions,fowtcmo,t3_g9y26t,1588126716.0,Congrats!
LSAT,fovm6ni,t1_fou0n1x,1588103668.0,I’ve seen a lot of people on the sub clarify that the more likely occurrence will be the most offering an alternative section for people who need it but that most people can still opt in to logic games.
UCSC,fovl2z3,t1_fovd6rk,1588103137.0,I took it with Paul Roth and loved it. He never curved it from what I remember lol.
UCSC,fotgkwi,t1_fotg3ii,1588053311.0,Take the Phil class intro to logic it’s not math but it fulfills the math requirement
UCSC,foswtes,t3_g9b2l8,1588039694.0,Partying is based mostly on organizations like clubs or sports and the groups you may or may not be in with. Greek life is kind of a joke due to restrictions from the university. Ur social life will also vary based on which residential college you become affiliated with. You can make it fun if you’re fun basically but also a lot of it is luck with who happens to be in ur building/floor on freshman year. We are by no means SDSU or UCSB but we’re also not UCSD or cal tech. We’re somewhere in between

lawschooladmissions,fooc9ao,t1_fooc0e9,1587936433.0,Thanks for taking the time! People typically go in house because it’s like less stressful/hours than big law it just pays less right?
lawschooladmissions,fooaxys,t1_fonjpzv,1587935780.0,"I’m unknowledgeable about how exactly the careers go outside of big law recruiting from the T14 directly would you mind explaining some things to me? Or if there’s a place I can read about this stuff?

When people talk about transitioning to in-house from big law is there a set process of transferring or recruitment there or does that just refer to people quitting big law and then applying to in house positions after? 
Also, what’s the typical path that follows a federal clerkship?"
lawschooladmissions,fo42k65,t1_fo42d7l,1587497109.0,I toured Berk Law a month or two back and remember the admissions guy saying they know if you applied to Berk undergrad lol and also that many of their admits are from Berk Undergrad I wouldn’t be surprised if they gave a slight edge to their own people
GodofWar,fo3xcqd,t1_fo31x0y,1587494544.0,How were you getting realm shifts so often? Was that with every successful dodge through a piece of equipment?
lawschooladmissions,fo1shfj,t3_g5715t,1587440465.0,Well done!
lawschooladmissions,fo1se5w,t3_g506dy,1587440404.0,Mind if I ask why you didn’t apply to Berk?
lawschooladmissions,fo0f3jw,t3_g4zcx3,1587411975.0,Look up USC law school class profile and it will show up. All schools are required by the ABA to release data on the GPA and LSAT of their applicants
UCSC,fnyiwfo,t1_fnyhm66,1587364491.0,Ah gotcha thank you !
UCSC,fnyfy5i,t1_fnyfm2a,1587361924.0,So like will my graduating transcript have a letter grade or no? Thanks for taking the time
LSAT,fnuvama,t3_g3r7nw,1587272033.0,Thank you!

Battlefield,fnn45f2,t3_g2ew5x,1587084011.0,fucking little birds god I’m getting back on tonight
lawschooladmissions,fnj1n6l,t3_g228wp,1586990280.0,Found in their admissions booklet/literature in their admissions office
lawschooladmissions,fnfb5yu,t1_fnfb3yn,1586904760.0,Well that’s too bad :’(
lawschooladmissions,fnfb0wk,t1_fneq0ay,1586904689.0,"Out of the loop, what makes NE so awful?"
UCSC,fnc74xy,t1_fnc6ute,1586830052.0,Basically yea lol. And they’re all hella short
UCSC,fnbyhhb,t1_fnbvtyg,1586824862.0,I could’ve slept in everyday but now I have to wake up around 7 lol
lawschooladmissions,fnbdf1a,t3_g0ox51,1586813562.0,Makes me so happy seeing everyone helping each other out like this
lawschooladmissions,fn1raq4,t1_fn1r6ex,1586568283.0,Thank you for the in depth answer!
lawschooladmissions,fn1ncn6,t1_fn0tk9z,1586565736.0,I was under the impression that scores were standardized to adjust for differences in difficulties between tests so like your raw score would translate differently to the 180 score depending on which LSAT you took? Isn’t 150 always supposed to be the average score/how could you have a greater number of people performing above average? I guess that would imply there were more people who took the LSAT who scored below 150 because that would balance it out?
LSAT,fn0ec4z,t1_fmz6via,1586540376.0,I’ve been told if you had to wager it’d probably be better to take it with logic games because they can be mastered to the point where you can only miss one or two everytime whereas we have no idea how difficult the new section will be
LSAT,fmygttq,t1_fmygozf,1586485840.0,That’s great advice thank you!
LSAT,fmyfu89,t1_fmyfnhu,1586485164.0,Thank you! Diagnostic was at 161 but I went over time on logic games. Those click the most to me so I think I should be able to rein that in to the time limit and then I can start fixing my other sections :)
LSAT,fmxxjv3,t1_fmxx59f,1586473852.0,So why is it best to take it without studying? Any studying you do you would retain and would carry over to the real thing...?
LSAT,fmuy99f,t1_fmtu7cx,1586401596.0,It was a logic game on the Analytical Reasoning section of the real LSAT on this one date that a large number of test takers thought was really hard
lawschooladmissions,fmuxskw,t1_fmux0ml,1586401290.0,Interesting insight! Thank you
lawschooladmissions,fmuvgsp,t3_fxk5ub,1586399786.0,"Also, possibility of taking testmasters live and doing 7Sage or another online course on the side?"
lawschooladmissions,fmudynw,t3_fxb6d0,1586389521.0,"New to the sub, mind explaining what HTE means to me?"
lawschooladmissions,fmm5tvv,t1_fmls5js,1586199332.0,If he retakes and scores worse does that make his application slightly weaker?
lawschooladmissions,fmh3bah,t3_fusgrh,1586065380.0,I think Harvard’s network/influence is extensive enough you’d be just fine finding a position in California
