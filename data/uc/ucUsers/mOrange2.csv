berkeley,fonfkcz,t1_fonefbo,1587918532.0,"It's not in their interest to send the most people to med school, they want to be able to send the best people towards med school. My older brother went to Berkeley went through all the bullshit, ended up with a decent 3.75 GPA (I know its fucking bullshit that med schools expect gpas above 3.8) and got into a pretty good med school. The nature of Berkeley isn't to sugarcoat anything. There will never be grade  inflation because the school knows a small amount of people will prevail and that's okay with them."

internetparents,fmynx4i,t1_fmxra8u,1586490840.0,"Well years later as a teenager I've been such a dick towards her. I've realized I've been harboring so much hatred, was it warranted? I guess at this point I'm realized my mistakes and was wondering if I need to forgive my mom and move on with life."

Advice,fmxndaj,t1_fmxlumx,1586468229.0,"I would probably have to speak to her with a therapist. Forgot to mention that the reason she stoped calling me a liar was because my former therapist scolded her into stopping. I guess with so much butting heads with my mom anything that I say at this point wouldn't register in a normal manner. There are still so many unresolved issues with me and her especially. Is it normal for a person to be borderline depressed then immediately be so angry at someone and then overnight be fine?? It's like a pattern I've noticed with her. She's fine during the weekdays when my dad is at work but then the weekend comes my dad is at home and she gets worked up about something stupid my dad did like idk waking up early and trying to get some work done on sat. Oh a classic case is if it's the weekend and my dad is at home he usually naps on the couch with the TV on with some generic action movie and my mom gets pissed that he doesn't pay attention to her or done anything fun in that day. She gets mad then goes to her room and mopes, gets more mad/sad, until Monday rolls around and as if nothing ever happened.

I'm so sorry for this rant, this has been my life until I went to college and I'm fucking back to this life again."
internetparents,fmxitvb,t1_fmwgdoh,1586465795.0,I mean I've been to 5 years of therapy but I stopped in the middle of my sophomore year of high school. Now I'm in my sophomore year of college a little older and much more mature. I was and still kind of am a dick against my mother but I realized the root of my issues. My own siblings said I was much nicer when I'm not home and I turn into an asshole at home. My thing now is do you forgive people who were like that?
