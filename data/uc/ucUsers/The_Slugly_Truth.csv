santacruz,foe9shs,t3_g6yj8j,1587698944.0,I never realized being appointed a county health officer made you so powerful.
santacruz,foe9icm,t1_fodzlvo,1587698786.0,Because their top priority has never been public safety.
UCSC,fo4df7t,t3_g58k43,1587502433.0,I'd say delay attending and take premed classes at CC.
GoldandBlack,fo429vy,t3_g5jh04,1587496968.0,"That would be what passes for ""science"".  Just like it has always been in lesser developed civilizations."
homeland,fo3tjqm,t1_fo307qv,1587492706.0,"You could probably go to BBC and look for ""Spooks""."
homeland,fo2q26h,t1_fo2e3sm,1587471076.0,Has Homeland ever portrayed bad guys as unintelligent idiots?
UCSC,fo04mx9,t1_fnsmefp,1587405999.0,"Your friend will probably just point out how in the email our Chancellor said the driver was confirmed as having it, but didn't say it was the direct cause of death.

He'll probably try to tell you that the language she used is typical because they are purposely trying to make people fearful.  Then he may try to make you believe that officials have been re-categorizing all sorts of deaths to be covid-19 deaths to increase the total and that there are financial incentives to do so.  He might even go so far as to show you multiple videos of government officials saying as much.

I mean, I don't know your friend personally, but he sounds like a real piece of work :("
homeland,fo039ds,t1_fnzhg0m,1587405315.0,"I don't really have an opinion on Gromov.  I can see why people would like him.  He's charming.  I think he's also loyal to Russia and most of all, to himself and his ambitions.

I just think that the showrunners want to show Russia as a bad guy given their political leanings.

In the end, all Saul actually needs to do is pull his asset out and have her talk to the president."
UCSC,fo020ct,t1_fnzhc9r,1587404689.0,"If you're not awkward and they make it awkward, it's on them.  Sometimes you'll have to take the lead as well.  I've found people (students in particular) are becoming less outgoing.
And unlike many of the undergrads, you're an adult, so your time here will be more of what you make of it."
UCSC,fnz5r4r,t3_g4lbmn,1587386785.0,Being older and wiser is actually a good thing.  Don't let anyone get you thinking otherwise.
westworld,fnyl1hs,t3_g4k5mn,1587366426.0,"It's basically The Matrix and the main characters have plot armor.  What did you expect?

I do agree that self-fellating fight scenes become more tedious as a result since there is a lack of real stakes or any sort of tension."
homeland,fnyffod,t1_fnw2gdg,1587361496.0,They will kill him because it's the final season and he's a Russian bad guy.
homeland,fnvrpzm,t1_fnvq9s8,1587302979.0,"Yevgeny got involved with Carrie, therefore he will get killed.  

My logic is sound."
UCSC,fnvpuic,t1_fnv4v69,1587301495.0,""" Who is not a useful or credible source of information for the public at this point?  So why fund a misinformation organization?""

Are you saying I shouldn't pay taxes?"
UCSC,fnvp1du,t3_g3v8cc,1587300831.0,I'm wondering how low housing prices will get.

UCSC,fnk0z27,t3_g26rp9,1587011876.0,"Plan for schools to be online until there is a ""vaccine"".

I'll probably quit UCSC and go to a foreign medical school for 1/10th the price."
UCSC,fnk076q,t1_fnfhux0,1587011290.0,What if I told you that you didn't have to be afraid anymore?  Would you behave differently?
UCSC,fnfb5kg,t3_fyu53b,1586904755.0,"Unfortunately, UCSC is not interested in gainz.

Unless you donated to the school, the suggestion generally falls into the low priority bin."
UCSC,fnfax6f,t3_fzooq1,1586904636.0,Because they can.
UCSC,fnfalqp,t3_g0ds1l,1586904475.0,I suggest fearless Slugs everywhere unite in Porter at midnight for a massive group hug and show of solidarity (in these strange and uncertain times).
UCSC,fnfa6t5,t3_g0ei2v,1586904255.0,"Only use FB if you have a specific need.  Like you're looking for housing or using the marketplace.

If you don't use it, social media tends to use you instead.  Like a regression to the mean over time."
UCSC,fnf7k5y,t3_g1d9sd,1586902862.0,"RIP.  If anyone knew him, please share good thoughts.

Students should also keep in mind that most, if not all deaths attributed to the common cold happen to people with underlying health conditions.  Stay healthy Slugs and take care of yourselves with or without a pandemic."
UCSC,fn1974q,t3_fyhvqk,1586557297.0,Was there ever any doubt?
UCSC,flcn4qg,t1_fkzcmdp,1585037736.0,Damn.  I always miss out on the name brand shit :(
