ucla,fotie0w,t3_g94p9l,1588054860.0,"I wanted to double major in music and econ and the process is like this for music performance: 

you audition one year, then if you get in you start the next year. you need to do four years of school with music. so if you audition year one, it will take 5 years to graduate. your studio classes (lessons) can only be taken one at a time and you need to take one every quarter. 

also ucla has a high ranked music program, so everyone is very good at their instrument.

i really wanted to get taught in performance, but the extra year isn’t worth it to me. instead, i joined an ensemble in the music school, which is great too. on top of that i take private lessons that i pay for, so i feel like i’m still getting a little bit of music education"

ucla,fn3q5e7,t3_fz8y71,1586625748.0,"i’m an international student too, my stats were similar to yours, but a little higher. your activities seem good too, although you need to distinguish yourself in your school (get awards, be the head of a club). 

international admission is real hard, our acceptance rate is only 8% so there’s no saying yes or no for sure. if you write some really good and compelling essays, you have a chance."

ucla,fn3ov0b,t3_fysuas,1586625019.0,i think that might mean it’s online but i’m not sure. email the prof just to be safe
ucla,flzvx6q,t3_fryvss,1585635272.0,"I had her for Econ 1 last quarter too, but I thought she was not that bad. Not an amazing lecturer, but she tries? She’s really willing to help outside of class, and the pacing of the class is slow, but I’m not sure if that’s because of her or Econ 1. 

The tests weren’t hard because of the content but they were worded really weirdly and were kind of confusing. 

I didn’t like her, but I didn’t mind her either"
