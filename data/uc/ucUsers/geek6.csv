It is every int'l student parents' dream. Frankly, there are some serious issues about limitations on H1B visas, even with a masters you might struggle to stay here. PhD may be a different story. I have int'l friends who have gotten full time jobs here though. Unsure what their futures are.

> But I'm curious about how UCD students are favored among the employers?

Many of my friends ended up working at big companies like Keysight, Intel, Raytheon and TI. Davis has a strong network and is in a great location.

> UCD is known for agricultural and environmental studies more in comparison w/ engineering

That's an outsider's perspective. Davis definitely has strong ag programs, but is a heavy STEM school with plenty of world-class researchers. In ECE, we have plenty of newly hired young up and coming faculty who are conducting some great interdisciplinary research. Specifically in Computer Engineering, we have researchers like John Owens.


> Higher academic reputation in the fields of engineering

> Slightly lower overall ranking

No. It only matters what the employers think about the school from past employees from that alma mater. The rankings don't correlate with the quality of the program and its graduates. UCSB and UCD are R1 institutions and they both are ABET accredited.

UCDavis,fo24cx0,t1_fo23frr,1587449338.0,"> publishing as an engineer is very rare?

I cannot say for other universities. At least at Davis, undergrads aren't publishing things left and right. I haven't met any EE who has published anything significant in my time here. In addition, publishing isn't part of the criteria to get into a good grad school. Grad schools don't expect undergrads to publish anyways - maybe if you're an MS student applying for PhD, their expectation will be higher. But certainly having a publication will improve your application significantly.

Furthermore, the grad admissions process is a crapshot. I'm not on a admissions committee, but I believe the letters of recs of equal importance to publishing. I have a friend who is at Stanford EE right now for his doctorate - no pubs but  doubled in ME+EE in 3.5 years. My other EE friend got into basically every prestigious university she applied to in Cali for a PhD without any pubs.

Imo, the most important thing as an undergrad is to:

1. Build a good knowledge foundation of the field you want to get into by doing well in your classes. If you want to get into the elite universities, you need to get really good grades - you must meet a certain GPA threshold.

2. Build a good relationship with one or more professors by conducting research and producing good results

Then if you get your name on a publication, good for you."

> I want to have grad school as an option (hopefully a school in the T20) 

I'm going to tell you first and foremost that grad school isn't about rankings. It's about how well reputed your professor is in their respective field. General rankings don't measure anything useful.

> and, to boost my chances of admission, want to make sure there are abundant opportunities at UC Davis to pursue research with professors even with competition against other undergrads

You should be able to find plenty of opportunities here. Not everyone wants to do research. A lot of EEs here are into ""engineering"" (i.e. building robots, design teams).

> I’m looking to get research published.

Publishing a great milestone to have. This may be easier in other fields like Biology. But imho, undergrads will find it difficult to grasp what is out there and generate novel ideas in EE. There is too much complex math. You may get lucky and get your name appended on a paper. First author undergrad papers in EE are not impossible, but rarely seen. However, this should not discourage you from trying. I am actually working towards publishing a paper as first author, but I have been sitting on this problem for a year and a half (and I'm a fifth year!).

> This is currently a deciding factor between me attending Davis and Cal Poly SLO.

SLO is a vocational school. If you truly want to do research, a UC is the place to be.

Fremont,fnwsett,t1_fnwpsll,1587324526.0,"> I think this may be the last week for MP access,  unfortunately.

I think so too, unless they close parking at Ohlone. I think that’s the most effective measure to keep the peak open and to reduce crowds. As a side note, police in the surrounding residential areas have already started giving citations for nonresidents parking in residential areas.

> I don't know how you would ride a MTB on this trail with the crowds

I usually go up there on the weekdays and ride indoors on the weekends. I wanted to see if it was still rideable on weekends. The weekdays are usually bearable. I only go through the singletrack twice (1x up, 1x down) and either go to the connecting trails to Monument Peak or do hill repeats from the end of the singletrack. I verbally signal when I approach hikers at least 15 ft away.

> Also, only about 2% of people were wearing masks

I went up yesterday afternoon around 4. I actually thought there were more % of hikers wearing masks than in the past. But since there are more hikers, there are more people without masks, which is a better metric for safety.

> random guy walked up to my face

That’s ridiculous. Unfortunately, I think they’re only going to pay attention when somebody in their family or a close friend gets it.

I also notice that there are always a lot of people who drive to the trailhead and park right by the Ohlone college sign or in the Ohlone college parking lot.

I had the same feeling too, but with my undergrad institution.

However, the more I was exposed to other universities, the more I realized that there are many things that a different university would offer compared to my undergrad university and I only found out because I applied and went to their visit day. These things were things that I couldn't attain through a simple google search.

> it's hard to find more programs that I can apply to besides that one

There will be institutions that do very similar research as I believe aging is a popular field. Read some papers, go to some conferences and find where great research is published. I would recommend applying to a variety. Some may offer visit days. I highly encourage you to attend them.

> I feel like I should have really good odds with all the stuff I mentioned

Nobody has good odds. It's unpredictable and mostly depends on how the admissions committee sees how well you fit AFTER you meet the minimum threshold requirements that they use to filter out the applicants that are unqualified.
