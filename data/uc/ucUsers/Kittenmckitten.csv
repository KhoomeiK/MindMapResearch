sex,fplnxqs,t1_fplhlmj,1588716163.0,Holy shit. Under three minutes? Damn I think the shortest I ever had was 10 minutes. I would be said if it was only 3 minutes. That is not enough.
relationships,fpln11h,t1_fplbx9d,1588715678.0,"I can definitely recommend the satisfyer over the magic wand. My clit is very very sensitive too and being fingered (on my clit) is too much for me already. I use the satisfyer on the lowest point and it gets me there. It is not too much whereas the magic wand just hurts me. Way to much sensation. 
Before sex toys I have always masturbated with my clothes on and using a balled up shirt to rub against my crotch. I lay on my stomach that way I have the pressure and the layer of clothes help me with the overstimulation."

sexover30,fpl0mxm,t3_gdy4be,1588704290.0,"We have a quick cuddle right after. About the time it takes him to get a bit soft. After that We both take turns to go to the bathroom. I go to pee (uti prevention) and he goes to discard the condom and clean up a bit. 
We cuddle afterwards. Unless it’s the start of the day then we eat. 

Unless we really messed up the sheets we don’t really go through the efforts to change the sheets. We usually put a towel down prior to sexy time so it’s easy clean up."

sex,fpb9zc5,t3_gcarbf,1588465301.0,"I may get downvoted for this but I don’t agree with you OP. I think it is shifty that girlfriend didn’t communicate with you about sex live. I also think it is bad of her to complain to mutual friends. However I think it is very normal for friends to talk about sex and I think it is good that she shared her concerns with them. She might have felt uncomfortable and just needed to talk to someone about it. She might just needed to hear that it so normal or not normal from her friends. 

Don’t tell your current girlfriend what she can or cannot share with her friends. Instead ask her ‘is there anything I can do to improve?’"
TwoXSex,fp9skr6,t3_gc0dzg,1588433677.0,"Same I get so spoiled! Sometimes I cum a lot during foreplay and then the piv sex part is a bit quick, so my boyfriend comes but I don’t. I tend to cum right before he does but sometimes the timing is slightly off so he has an orgasm and I am almost there. When that happens he always continues with his fingers or goes down on me or grabs toys. Only after I get mine (and I have already gotten mine during foreplay) he is satisfied.

 It’s so nice! Especially considering that most men before never really cared. I tend to come pretty quick and often but the intensity of my orgasms build as the frequency rises. So my first orgasm (unless it’s the result of tease and denial) is always my least favorite. It’s almost barely an orgasm. But guys are trained to go: foreplay until she cums once, now you unlocked the vagina level, stick your dick in her. Fuck her. If you can make her come again great, but if not you are not an asshole because you already did the minimum ‘unlock next level‘ orgasm. If you can make her cum once while fucking her now you are king and get to forget about her and go chase your own orgasm. 

Sex wasn’t really that satisfying for me before I met my boyfriend because everyone before always went for the minimum effort. And because my orgasms are so quick I had foreplay of 5 minutes max. Now with my boyfriend sex get elevated to ‘kinda alright, I did have 1 orgasm so I guess I shouldn’t complain’ to ‘to holy fuck how is this possible’ amazing level"
Parenting,fp9qgw3,t3_gbwxkj,1588432388.0,"When I was your daughters age I told my girlfriend (Same sex relationship) at the time to “drop dead” during a fight. I don’t know why I said it. I remember wanting to tell her fuck you and for some reason I thought that was worse to tell someone so I settled with drop dead. Which is ofcourse way worse to wish for someone’s demise. We made up afterwards. I didn’t mean it but I was just so angry and I had no nuanced thought to express myself and my anger. We made up, but our relationship never really flourished after it and ended about six months after that. I have also never gotten that vile with any other person after that. It’s like I needed to learn that you can’t just say everything without it having consequences. 

Yes it’s bad that your daughter said that, but teenagers say so much and don’t mean it. I am a little glad that the anger was directed at you, a safe person whose relationship is reparable. The alternative is that she learns the lesson of what to tell people and what not to say while being in a conflict with her friends of relationship and those things are a lot harder to repair."

TwoXSex,fp3ryrd,t1_fp1xotx,1588284718.0,God same. My boyfriend and I never get to sex because our stoner style is the opposite. I will fall asleep and before that I just get really slow and he gets super hyper and starts singing and dancing.
TwoXSex,fp1udxb,t3_gaogdl,1588248068.0,"Have him sit up. Like on a couch or something. I hated cowgirl because it simply didn’t feel good for me (my boyfriend is on the larger side too and it would just hurt me) but if the guy sits up and you straddle him omg. The feeling is amazing. Plus it is way more sensual, you can kiss more easily, feel his body against yours and you get to balance way easier by holding on to his schouders. I bounce up and down but I also move my hips like I am dancing but kinda like I am grinding my butt into his crotch type dancing."
TwoXSex,fp0lexg,t3_gajess,1588211627.0,"There is a subreddit that is called chickflixx (I think, might be more x’s) that is porn videos for women suggested by other women. I don’t think men are allowed to post or comment but you can for sure look to it and see what type of videos they suggest. 

I never really enjoyed porn but some of the stuff I found there was hot. Mainstream porn for me is boring since it just is the same stuff over and over again and it really focuses on things that the guy likes. And I am bisexual so I like looking at naked women, but still it’s too mechanical and fake. Whereas porn that girls tend to enjoy more is focused on a good chemistry between the people on the screen. It can still be rough or forced even but I like that the guy is there because he must have the woman now. 
Also for us having legitimately hot guys in screen is such a rarety but such a plus."

relationships,foysoo2,t1_foys0hl,1588178451.0,Well it’s not dangerous for me. And he isn’t lax about safety measures either he takes them very very serious.

relationships,fow0cix,t3_g9t8n3,1588110696.0,"Same. I don’t have any advice for you because I have been dealing with it for five years with no avail but SAME GIRL SAME. Even similar frequency wishes and the fact that if there is sex it’s amazing. That is kinda what makes it so unfair. It would be a far easier decision whether to keep going if the sex wasn’t so damn good or if it was completely none existing. Once a week is enough to not starve but not enough to feel fully satisfied. 

I have accepted it. Sometimes I get sex twice a week and I am so happy. We have a D/s dynamic and a free use rule so that in combination with our libido difference means he gets to decide when sex is happening. If he initiates sex happens if I initiates sex happens about 50% of the time (I learned to read the room well so I only initiate if I think I can him in the mood). I also just try to fill my own life with stuff I like to do outside of sex. So I love hot yoga, or cycling or recently I got into painting. Or things we can do together as a couple like dancing. We also do a lot of non sex intimacy stuff like naked cuddles or massages. 

And I bought a really good sex toy. I can recommend the womanizer or the satisfyer."
relationships,fovyulw,t3_g79ye3,1588109938.0,"Eugh I don’t want to be long distance anymore. 
My boyfriend (30s) and me (late 20s) have been dating for five years (really good happy relationship!) and we lived within different distances from each other in those past five years. A majority of the time we lived in the same city but the past year I lived first three hours (one way) away from him and now since 2 months we live in completely different countries (I moved back to Europe because of covid). 

And I am done with it now. I just want to be in the same room. Or at least in the same time zone. I feel single. 
We try to FaceTime but it’s never a good time. I think in the 8 weeks I am here we had one sexy conversation. He doesn’t like it. I send him a sexy picture and he drew a smiley face on my boob (?). 
He normally makes me laugh all the time but our conversation are getting a bit boring (because our life is super boring). 
I just feel disconnected from him.

sex,fou1dyn,t3_g9j6x6,1588073350.0,"Honestly it seems like our tips wouldn’t help because he doesn’t seem to care about giving you a good time so why would he change his actions?

However I guess there is a couple of things you can do. Try to talk to him in a non sexy stress free setting (like at or right after dinner) about screen time and how you want more quality time in your relationship. If the only thing your boyfriend does every night is watch Netflix until you fall asleep you have bigger problems than sex timing, I mean do you guys go on dates? Like a proper date where you go out dancing or to dinner or something? Obviously with the current world situation it’s different but normally? 
After you discuss screen time and are like hee we watch Netflix way too much tru to come up with evening activities you can do instead. Plan in one game night. One night where you cook together and get to try new foods that are complicated. Two nights where you can do something relaxing like Netflix or reading a book or gaming. Plan in sex three times a week. Tell him like tue/thu/Saturday I want you to clear out the evening. Then start those evenings off with a nice relaxing shower (you could even shower together) and have those evenings of intimacy. Maybe the first week it doesn’t even have to be sex. It could be things like intimacy like massages or just rubbing your body on his. No phones no computer no tv. Turn off the WiFi at the start of the evening. Take your time with things, maybe start of with a massage. If you want more oral maybe start 69 ing. that way he gets used to it and probably links it with pleasure. After he is comfortable with it start asking for it on regular bases like when you are under the shower together or when you are making out naked in bed. “God I am so horny I can’t wait to feel your tongue on my clit, mm I would just explode.” All the while while scooting your body down. 

You could also try to be more spontaneous during the day/morning. If his libido naturally peaks more in the morning give in to that once in a while. I promise you that if you shower everyday and you clean up down there with water and soap (not inside of your vagina only the outside with soap) you will not be nasty the next day. Pussies get moist. That’s pretty normal. If anything you can wake up early and go to the bathroom, pee, brush your teeth, put on some deodorant and have a quick wet wipe wash on your down belows. Not necessary but it might put you at ease."

It usually doesn’t lead to sex but that’s okay. I just need him to see that I care enough to try to look presentable once in awhile.

TwoXSex,forujmv,t3_g94nhw,1588018758.0,"I have a conversation with her about stds and whether she got tested lately. I would also ask her what type of protection she prefers and kinda go with her through what I do to stay safe. 
 I also make sure my hands and fingernails are clean (and trimmed short!). If I use any toys I boil them prior to use. I only use body safe share friendly material like silicon, glass or metal. With insertables like dildos I use a condom. I wouldn’t feel comfortable using her toy on myself unless she told me it’s body safe material and boiled. (Or spritzed with alcohol and cleaned properly if it is battery operated) 

I have heard from the std clinic I went to that std with girl and girl contact from oral or fingering is pretty low. You can transmit stuff ofcourse but your highest risk activities is sharing toys that aren’t clean in between.

I have personally never used a dental dam. No one that I went down on ever asked me if I could use one. It’s not really, at least in my circles, something that gets used often. It seems to be the thing that people say to use but in reality no one does. I don’t think that’s a specific queer thing either. I have also never heard of a guy going down on a girl and going, hold up where is the dental dam. However if a girl brought her dental dam or would feel more comfortable if I used them or she could use it on me I would be completely fine with it."

You tie a scarf loosely around a dildo. Then you make the other scarf go through that loop as well but on the opposite side of the knot. You strengthen the tie and you have two scarfs with 4 endings. You place it like a cross where every scarf has one ending horizontally and one vertically (so each of the scarfs ending is perpendicular to the other tail of the same scarf). Now you place a pillow in the middle of the cross and tie the ends of the scarfs together. Scarf a goed to b and versa virsa. Good luck"

I just meant to say I am not looking at it with rose colored glasses like yay baby is going to be the easiest most wonderful thing I have done because I know it’s not.

I know people (women) too that were in their early thirties ended long term relationship with their partner and within a year had a new boyfriend/house/baby. I think with these women (I don’t know about your friend but I know that was the situation with the women I know) is that their ex partner kept pushing the baby time line for years until the woman was like No. Need. Baby. Now. And then she found very quickly someone else who was on the same page as her.

TwoXSex,fobydrc,t1_fobx4tw,1587665061.0,"Oef I am sorry to hear that. It sounds like since you were doing the insertion you might have pushed too hard. Tears are very painful (I have gotten them before because of scratches during sex-fingernails being too long) but I usually feel better within two days. the stabbing pain in the urethra sounds like maybe a beginning of an infection? Make sure you keep your toys clean and that they are body safe that will reduce the risk of infections. And pee after inserting anything. 

I have had pain after obgyn appointments that lasted longer than a day but only because I actually had a couple of procedures done that needed healing (biopsy and stuff). A routine check up hurts me during, is sensitive after, but the next day I am fine. Take it easy for a while. Your body will heal itself pretty quickly (vaginas tend to heal up remarkably fast) but you got to give it some time to do so. So don’t try to insert anything until you’re pain free."

My calfs, my feet? I spend 1.5 hours giving this guy a head to toe massage. My hands were done. So now when we are laying in bed and he makes a sad wimper like his neck is sore normally I would ask him like he you want a back rub?

TwoXSex,fobgpxg,t1_fo9nfbb,1587659617.0,"So I found that doctors visits and sex don’t really correlate. I am 26 and had my fair share of sex partners and things up my hooha and no pain at all. Even my first time wasn’t painful because I was with someone who was very skilled and used lots of lube and foreplay. 
However my yearly gynecologist appointment hurts like a motherf*cker. I think I am just too nervous to completely relax and it hurts. I always ask for the smallest speculum, lots of lube and I found that it helps me if they don’t just shove it in but very carefully go back and forth until it’s in. Now it’s doable (and it helped tremendously that I found a good obgyn that I trust). 

Don’t worry about your first time based on this experience. It will not be the same."
TwoXSex,fobeauf,t1_foam1gc,1587658925.0,Dang momma you pushed out some large babies. You rock. Are you and your partner very tall people?
TwoXSex,foauskv,t1_foaswnx,1587652830.0,"Yeah just 1 and it stopped after I posted the edit but still. It was like a couple minutes after I posted it too. Like yay way to be vulnerable :/
Luckily not creepy nice women started responding after a while so I am happy now that I posted this."
TwoXSex,foaosea,t1_foanjjj,1587650108.0,I am so sorry to hear that:( that is my fear of postponing the pregnancy and as a result of it having fertility issues. Do you think you would have gotten pregnant easier if you were younger or do you think already had fertility issues buy only discovered them when trying to be pregnant?

UCSantaBarbara,foa4eob,t1_fo99fsg,1587639219.0,What kind of accommodations do you have for test anxiety? I got diagnosed with it as well (it’s pretty severe as I can’t sleep more than 2-3 hours a night for an entire week prior to finals and I take beta blockers before a test prescriped by a doctor) but I never thought of going to dsp for it since I already am part of dsp for a physical disability.
TwoXSex,foa2ikh,t3_g6ci1z,1587638059.0,"Howwww do you do a proper ass picture? I have been struggling with this for a month now. I either need a selfie stick or I guess extreme flexibility, and I have neither of those things"
sex,foa041j,t1_fo9ssqn,1587636190.0,"That’s super interesting. My boyfriend has that too while I am more of the slow simmering (except when I am almost right before my period. Then my body is like get all the seed now. Ah biology. ) 
But yeah it almost surprises me that sometimes he is so so horny and sometimes he is like sex huh what is that?"
sex,fo9zvzo,t1_fo8wamj,1587636010.0,How old are you? Because I feel like at one point it will decline because of hormonal chances. (Meno pause around your 50s)
sex,fo9sj71,t1_fo9kg23,1587629631.0,"I have been to the bathroom with many women as well and I have no clue which direction they wipe. In order for me to find that out I would have to probably kneel in front of them and stare at their hooha. A bit intrusive I would say. 

My friend did yell at me for sitting down a toilet seat once in a club. I was really drunk and wearing high heels so I wasn’t having the whole squat down and hover movement. My friend mid pee went ‘omg why are you sitting down all the way so gross. Get up now’. Instead of letting me pee (I had already done the crime of letting my bare butt touch the nasty seat) she decided I had to go squat and hover so she kept pulling on my arms until I finally complied. It was one of the most difficult pees I have ever completed."
sex,fo88ghs,t1_fo83kkz,1587591796.0,"Who writes from a second person perspective? Do you find it easier to write from perspective or do you not care? 

Do you mean you hate the first sentence of a story to start with “I ...’’ or do you just in general not like as a reader first person stories. 

I don’t mind them as a reader at all if they are written well."
sex,fo6jrr1,t1_fo6j0bj,1587560547.0,"Oh that’s funny. I feel like I have to introduce my characters physical characteristics way more in third person than in first person. 

Yeah I like realism too. I often read erotica written by man that is always like: “she took my ten inch thick cock with an ease that shocked me in her Virgin asshole.”

Like bro. There is no way your cock is 10 inches and on the very low chance that is actually is, it will not be anywhere near or in a virgin asshole. Especially ‘with an ease that shocked you’. 

Unless I am writing about cockworshipping I tend to not really describe the physical details of said penis. And if I do it’s a realistic size."

sex,fo6693l,t1_fo65x2y,1587548074.0,"Oh I definitely will:)
I was more just wondering why you prefer third person stories? Not arguing that there are first person stories that work well, but more curious why you as a reader like third person more? What is it about third person as opposed to 1st person that works for you? Is it the broader perspective or the idea that you can place yourself in multiple people easier? I am always interested to see what works for people reading the stories and what doesn’t."
sex,fo65j7y,t1_fo610hq,1587547294.0,I write erotica (not professionally!) and I am wondering why you say it had to be written from the third person? I have the hardest time writing from the third person and still being that up close with my character. 1st person allows me to really in depth write about all the feels.
TwoXSex,fo4u694,t3_g5d8tt,1587511277.0,Face down for sure.
UCSantaBarbara,fo2bs1t,t3_g5aqt8,1587456432.0,Yes same. I think the highest I have scored is like a 70. Which sucks.

I am sure everything else in the relationship is amazing and you and she sounds like good people, but has your sex life always been this cold?"
UCSantaBarbara,fo0qvd3,t3_g50ndv,1587418087.0,I think law calculates np as F but I don’t think others do. That’s kinda the whole point of p/np that it doesn’t bring your gpa down.
UCSantaBarbara,fo0imff,t1_fnzoi5f,1587413810.0,Same. I had a couple of questions that I wasn’t sure about and knew were very easily googlable so it took a lot of will power to keep the honor system in place but I ended up just guessing it (I couldn’t find it in my notes).
hardofhearing,fo05yw6,t3_g4wuap,1587406672.0,Saaame. I never really knew how much I used lipreading until everyone and their mother started to wear masks. My interactions right now are extremely limited to just smiling and nodding and half understanding the little interaction I do have with random people.
sex,fnzybrb,t1_fnylxg6,1587402865.0,"Honestly same. The first time
I tried I literally spent an entire evening floating on cloud nine. I came nine (!!) times in a row and squirted. Both new experiences for me. 
Now it will get me off maybe once but I need a higher level and sometimes it hurts, sometimes it plezant. It’s honestly kinda hit or miss. 
I think it’s the toy working less. Because PIV and fingers still get me off just fine."
sex,fnzwi8i,t3_g4u1og,1587401960.0,"Yes you probably have an hpv strain that causes warts. They will go away after time. The only thing you can do is check with your doctor to get it diagnosed and make sure you keep your immune system up. 
You should tell your gf to get a Pap smear done in case you also have the strain (you can have multiple strains at once) which causes cervical cell abnormalities which have a risk of developing into cancer (however it usually takes years to get at that point if ever and doctors can treat it really well when it is still in precancerous state)

Did you get gerdasil 9 when you were younger? Did she?

Edit: you can get them from sex but also any type of skin contact (however with genitals it is usually sex) condoms don’t always protect 100% of the time and most people will be tested positive (abnormal Pap smear) or get symptoms (genital warts) at least once in their lifetime. Your immune system usually clears it up pretty quickly."
sex,fnzvhgv,t1_fnzbhgi,1587401460.0,Yeah or like a 1. What a douche.
sex,fnzv6gx,t3_g4u1cq,1587401311.0,"My boyfriend always uses a condom with anal and vaginal sex so if he wants a blow job after he just removes the condom. Still kinda has that dirty taboo feeling to it without the risk. 

What I would never though even with a condom swap is anal to Vaginall. I sometimes see that in porn too and that just pisses me off. That is really high risk for UTI or PPD which the last one leaves untreated could lead to fertility Issues. Like hell no."
