berkeley,fp4mtws,t1_fp3qoon,1588302509.0,"agreed, but the protestors were much worse."
berkeley,foy0oru,t3_ga4dr1,1588162299.0,"3. not physics but pretty sure our physics is unparalleled, like the department is better than or on par with MIT / Caltech / Stanford AKA just the best profs in the world, on par MIT Nobel laureates, discovered exactly half of the 32 elements discovered in the last 100 years, basically made the atom bomb... (the profs that made it at least)"

berkeley,fosay3l,t1_fopvotz,1588027189.0,"Yeah you're right you did, I just remembered the general gist of all the top comments when I replied, that everyone was saying she's biased as President and not saying much else.

A little ridiculous the number of downvotes though"
berkeley,fopucfd,t1_fop0hbp,1587972408.0,"Every single attack is about her background and nothing else, isn't that ad hominem by definition? You take it into consideration that she doesn't have a background so that you can be more motivated to find weaknesses in her reasoning, but just saying that alone only casts doubt, it doesn't necessarily means she's wrong."

berkeley,fo4xm99,t1_fo3enqr,1587513223.0,"I think he would be considered a representative. Might as well say that the clerks at Sproul that could release student records ""are not the school"" so its okay"
berkeley,fo26hi0,t1_fo1919c,1587451266.0,yeah?
berkeley,fo1kmio,t1_fo1ap87,1587435349.0,"Yeah but he could just have the student's transcript show that information somehow

>However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR ยง 99.31): Other schools to which a student is transferring"

berkeley,fnx6qre,t1_fnwwzwv,1587332576.0,"The description of the class itself has a slant, but I tend to see most professors that teach things related to politics as politically biased. That said I felt like Reich was especially well-known so I kinda assumed he would be different"
berkeley,fnvegri,t1_fnu5vz6,1587290240.0,really? pretty saddening to see such a famous prof be that biased

I'm sure some of em aren't ""life smart"" like you say but not necessarily. If A2C is nothing but unreliable internet strangers then why do any of you use it for anything anyway?"

berkeley,fn53pgn,t3_fzn59t,1586655187.0,"General Rule:

If a very rigorous high school curriculum was mostly a breeze for you, anything up to 20 units is doable (but nearing it makes things stressful). 3 techs max (unless you want a challenge)

If a very rigorous curriculum was doable, then anything up to 15-16 units. 2 techs max

If it was hard, then anything up to 12-13 units. 1-2 techs"
