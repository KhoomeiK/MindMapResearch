assassinscreed,fpe2s32,t1_fpdbrpi,1588539208.0,"Glad we're on the same page. I remember people complaining about the immersion because we weren't killing ""historical figures"" in Syndicate. An issue the devs directly addressed by saying that the time period was too close to modern day where people might actually sue with the reason being, ""My great great grand relative should not have been portrayed as an evil tyrant part of a secret organization and murdered because of it"". For that reason they had us kill ""made up"" Templars that weren't actual people in history. Despite all that Syndicate still offered decent gameplay and stealth was much more preferable than melee combat, like how an Assassin *should be*."

assassinscreed,foj6b36,t1_foj3sk7,1587810103.0,"Mentioned in ACIII between Connor and Haytham, the latter argued that at one time, the Assassins had a much more sensible goal: peace. While *both* sides want peace, the Templars seek to gain it through control and obedience. Whether that be through political means or ancient artifacts. In contrast, the Assassin philosphy is that freedom is peace, so the two butt heads and the Assassin's goal shifted from peace, to protecting the freewill of humanity. To this end, it greatly surprised me that Machiavelli was an Assassin, as his view is essentially that of how Templars view humanity."
assassinscreed,foj61la,t3_g7q29z,1587809798.0,"Excerpts from Altaïr's Codex:

*""Do we bend the rules in service to a greater good? And if we do, what does it say of us? That we are liars? That we are frauds? That we are weak?""*

*""Robert de Sable may be dead, but his brotherhood survives. Though less conspicuous in appearance, I fear they remain a threat. Where once they proudly walked the streets – making for easier targets – now they retreat into the shadows. It grows difficult to track them. What wicked things will they weave in the darkness? Our work will be all the more complicated for it.""*

*""It's made me realize that our tactics, too, must change. It means an end to our fortresses. To our penchant for spectacular displays of public assassinations. We must weave our webs quietly. And we must do so differently than we have in the past.""*

*""Though I ask my brothers now to abandon their rituals, I do not ask that they abandon the creed. THIS is what makes us assassins. Not the removal of a finger. Not a false promise of paradise. Not the prohibition of poison. Our duty is to the people, not to custom. If we must sneak, we shall sneak. If we must use poison, we shall use poison. If our blades can be used without removing fingers, we shall not demand they be taken. And we shall not manipulate our initiates with lies and parlor tricks. We shall speak plainly and honestly. We shall be made anew...""*

From these excerpts I believe that Altaïr focused on dispersing and living among the people as the Templars have started to do the same since the Crusades. Now the Templars have accumulated power and are coming out of the wood work. The strong suit of the Assassins are to appear amongst the people. From Altaïr's perspective, he is clearly willing to match the enemy's moves (to that end I agree). Though fast forward with William Miles being the current Assassin Mentor, I doubt he has any grand plans to drag this conflict into the light. Though that was the idea with the Initiate program from ACU, to gain new recruits in mass to fight against the Templars. The nameless Abstergo employee you play from ACIV suggests the Assassins are already doing their own form of mass recruitment. While I do not believe in compromising the second tenant of the Creed, it would definitely be to the advantage of the Assassins to win the hearts of the people they are fighting to protect, much as Ezio and the Frye twins did."

""I just killed my dad but I'm still gonna kill you"" Weird flex but okay? This is one of the few cases I think didn't have a big pay off story wise.

I felt like I was Neo being told what the Matrix is for the first time by a much more evil Morpheus.

A big draw back with more modern AC games, as mentioned by Ubisoft themselves during development of Syndicate, they had to opt for ""no-name Templars"" as they were literally approaching time periods where people may say ""Hey! Assassination target XYZ was my distant relative! How dare you?!"" While that is an exaggeration of the issue, using historically accurate names now held much more weight than before, whereas there was more leeway with older historical figures (Medici, Pazzi, Borgia, Suliman, etc.). I still agree that these conditions should not take away from character development and writing, as most of the baddies literally joined up with Templars to live a luxurious life at the expense of others. In ACIII, this was clearly the case for Thomas Hickey, one of the few well written characters with those motivations *in my opinion*.

*""The Templars. Lee. The big man, Haytham. They 'as the money. They 'as the power. That's the reason I threw in with 'em. That's the ONLY reason. \[...\] They paid me so I said yes. Didn't bother to ask who or how or why. Didn't care.""*
