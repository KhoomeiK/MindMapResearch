ucla,fpecywe,t1_fpecpc0,1588545065.0,Are you part of the 100$ fund?
ucla,fpeck0h,t1_fpecgw6,1588544823.0,I got an email from someone else who was in charge of the $100 fund and she asked if I wanna venmo or zelle. I heard there’s people who are charge of sending it to you
ucla,fpece6q,t3_gcz70k,1588544729.0,Email them. I received mine
ucla,fp490bv,t1_fp48s06,1588294101.0,I emailed them today and got it today through venmo
ucla,fp153a4,t3_ganepn,1588224643.0,I got an email like week 3 saying I got it but haven’t received it yet
ucla,foruvjl,t1_foru7y0,1588018924.0,Nope I’m back at home but I saw on Facebook that they opened it up again
ucla,forl5g9,t3_g96m0q,1588014075.0,I heard Hedrick the study is open 8 am to midnight but you’ll have to wear a mask and be 6 feet away.
ucla,forhxd0,t1_forhbm3,1588012528.0,Holly is the transfer community and you’ll meet other transfers and make friends
ucla,foomp47,t3_g8ohtl,1587942061.0,So I’m guessing new students aren’t going to be bruintized since the orientation is online now :/
ucla,fooazi3,t3_g8mhnh,1587935802.0,It’s true
ucla,foj74g5,t1_foivzhj,1587811023.0,Nope professors encourage it
ucla,foin5qm,t3_g7jrby,1587791010.0,"I wouldn’t look into housing off campus and sign a lease just yet because the coronavirus and how fall may not be in person. I would recommend doing UCLA housing because if classes are online, you would be given your money back for fall housing"
ucla,foidh68,t1_foiddsr,1587784119.0,You’ll get an email from housing about it. I would say apply for on campus housing in the dorms. The transfer community is holly and holly building consists of triple deluxe rooms so apply for that dorm if you want to be near other transfers
ucla,foia3x1,t1_foi9a8e,1587781942.0,"You would use something professional for your log ID. Mine was taken so I used half of my first name and my last initial. 
I liked studying on the hill in the study rooms and also at the library. 
I would say choose on campus housing in the dorms. It’s a once in a lifetime experience and you get to meet other transfers. The building that you want as a transfer is holly and the dorm type is deluxe triple."
ucla,foi8pni,t1_foi8ktt,1587781060.0,Well UCLA campus is so beautiful and I wanted to be in LA. I liked the program I got into as well.
ucla,fohwzzb,t1_fohwmxc,1587774276.0,Check now! They are up
ucla,fohw9ma,t1_fohw3b3,1587773869.0,"So people are either rejected, admitted, or waitlisted. This means they will accept you at a later time like in June or July if there is still space open in the transfer class. You can opt in if you still want to attend UCLA but also you should accept admissions at another college in case the waitlist doesn’t accept you in June or July."
ucla,foeng2s,t1_foenc2p,1587708630.0,Like week 9
ucla,foen08i,t1_foemx3r,1587708255.0,Yea! I don’t wake up for the class. I watch it later on in the week and then I feel behind so I’m still gonna have to catch up. I’m on this week now. There’s also a group me for this class. I’m planning on rereading notes and the course reader and doing the book problems
ucla,foemne3,t3_g712ey,1587707955.0,I was always into healthcare growing up with a family of nurses. But I explored more throughout high school and my time at community college and knew that I wanted to go into medicine because of my desire to understand the human body and how it works. I want to be in the front line of working at a hospital (ER). I’ve gone through other professions like nursing and Pa and even dental and optometry but always came back to this thought of me standing in an ER and healing people every hour.
ucla,foem924,t3_g72mpy,1587707625.0,I’m also in the class this quarter
ucla,foem7jm,t3_g72t4j,1587707589.0,Usually after finals week. So last week of June or like third week of June
ucla,fmqsmno,t3_fww9r9,1586306178.0,There’s an Asian health organization also! Not sure what it’s called but they go to health fairs and translate
ucla,fmqm61m,t3_fws8yx,1586302352.0,Community health science 179
ucla,fmqm25r,t3_fwv1o5,1586302289.0,Be careful who you work with. A lot of people were reported to the dean last quarter for cheating. Someone on the inside reported them.
ucla,flsq6jy,t3_fquzp7,1585448056.0,Yea
