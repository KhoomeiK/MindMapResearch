UCI,fopor5s,t1_foombf1,1587967399.0,"Lol.  
I graduate next fall and I’ve been thinking about law enforcement and probably start up an business selling private label items.  These are all things I could have done without a degree.  I still want to get my Masters just for kicks, but really probably wont use it.  Bottomline, it’s possible to live a good life without a degree, but you’ll regret if you don’t accomplish this one milestone in your life.
Live your own life."

JusticeServed,fn16t74,t1_fn15vjl,1586555933.0,"Well it makes sense, at least financially.  The actuaries computing the cost of injury claims would far exceed the cost of any grocery items stolen on average.  There’s no chase policy isn’t necessarily a good one either if we look at countries like China we see greater implementation of surveillance systems hindering public privacy."
JusticeServed,fn15kpe,t3_fyhw8n,1586555237.0,"I think stores have a no chase policy incase the shoplifters has a weapon.  So if the situation were to escalate and the employee is injured during the confrontation the store could make the case that they forbid all employees from chasing shoplifters.  In the end, out of negligence the employee defied store police, and got injured.  
I dont know really just making an assumption."
