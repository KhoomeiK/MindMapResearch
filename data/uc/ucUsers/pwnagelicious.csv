UCI,fovwg6y,t1_foisafa,1588108718.0,"You need 24 semester units for accounting and business related subjects. All your econ classes will account for business units which you also need 24 units for. 24 semester units X 1.5 = 36 quarter units. So double check and make sure.

UCI,fo9xmfl,t3_g6dyea,1587634227.0,You can do Econ and accounting minor here at uci and qualify to sit for cpa if that’s the route you wanna take (I’m doing this). Getting actually accepted into accounting minor is competitive but as long as you take all the required courses you’ll get “accounting minor” written on your degree lol. And ya your chances of changing majors once in is nearly impossible especially for bus admin since it’s so competitive and there’s literally not enough seats

UCI,fmtkv6o,t3_fx8cmm,1586374464.0,"I’m literally in the exact same position as you. No email back from financial aid, and no letter back from IRS and it’s almost been 4 weeks. Emailed financial aid like 6 days ago too. Hoping they’ll extend the deadline since the IRS is probably backed with so many requests of tax returns. Please let me know if you ever get your letter in from the IRS"
UCI,flauc3w,t3_fnogud,1584991289.0,"Hey I recently got accepted this year and within the app form I discussed how I planned to become a cpa and develop software down the line to automate specific processes within the field. You can also discuss a specific industry where you think accounting could be challenging within our current generation, such as e-commerce. Hope this helps :)"
