berkeley,fp0vrem,t1_fozdbl1,1588218025.0,This is what I'm concerned about too.
berkeley,fp0vjv1,t1_fowntdq,1588217888.0,"Not to mention that people in the states where there ARE shelter in place restrictions will likely start to get lax and want to break quarantine to see one friend here, one friend there... I'm bracing for the fact that without actual on-the-ground enforcement of guidelines that a lot of people will start to slide and get selfish and/or sloppy."
Devs,fowfrex,t1_fn5loe3,1588118907.0,"To be fair, we don't know that for sure.  They might not have been domesticated en masse, but who's to say she didn't bond with a wolf that acted like a dog?"
Devs,foe6iwl,t1_flse3vj,1587697020.0,The OA is soooo good.  Watch it!
Devs,fnsw557,t1_fli3v8r,1587229932.0,"People always complain more about actresses and female characters more than actors and male characters because--welp--people are still overly critical of women and don't recognize the range of personalities they have, just like men.  I noticed a few off-moments with the acting in the first episode myself, but it's not nearly as bad as people are bitching about.  I'm certain she and the character wouldn't get so much flack on here if the character was a dude.  They would just think he's an awkward and focused dude."
Devs,fnqhrdd,t1_fkrno62,1587164860.0,"My friend recommended Devs because he knows I'm a huge fan of The OA on Netflix.  They are similar in that they are both multi-layered puzzle-box mysteries that involve time travel, bending time and space, and tech cults in San Francisco.  Both involve extreme matters of life and death.  They both get under your skin in a truly uncanny, immersive way.  They differ in that The OA is more humanistic and hopeful, and involves more elements of fantasy than technology.  Though I would still consider it a sci-fi show, it is more than that and defies genre.   People tend to love it or hate it."
Lowes_Employees,fncj409,t1_fn82jyo,1586838059.0,I’m so sorry.  That’s real messed up. Wishing the best to you.
EntitledBitch,fn4il23,t1_fn2ee0i,1586642120.0,"I mean, I agree with you about better enforcement.  But then you'd have all the entitled dumbfucks raising hell about government overreach even more than they are now.  At least this way, they might (hopefully) contract the disease and learn a lesson. (While infecting no other bystanders one could only hope)."
EntitledBitch,fn4ib8t,t1_fn2rve1,1586641964.0,"Yeah, multiply this by all the freedom-loving libertarians across the country."
EntitledBitch,fn4i6bj,t1_fn2tx53,1586641883.0,"Entitled, dumb as a rock, starved for attention while under quarantine... yep would be an interesting study."
EntitledBitch,fn4hs9k,t1_fn1dkn9,1586641657.0,"And just made her facebook unsearchable.  Probably gonna whine and cry about how mean the internet is when this Karen completely brought it on herself.  Attention-starved in quarantine, acting out, now regretting all the attention.  Lol."
EntitledBitch,fn4hkc6,t1_fn1ow3z,1586641530.0,I wonder if I can be surprised by anything in the United States anymore.  These are the Karens of all Karens.
EntitledBitch,fn4gzfi,t1_fn182s7,1586641193.0,You can't even make this up.  It's like a george saunders story and Idiocracy rolled into one.
AskNYC,fk7ufb4,t1_fk7gebn,1583943825.0,"No problem! The location is called NYU Sunset Terrace. It is part of the NYU Langone system, but they accept anyone with medicaid and most other insurance.  Here is the site:
https://nyulangone.org/locations/sunset-terrace-family-health-center-at-nyu-langone

The Jewish Board runs similarly (required weekly therapy plus psychiatrist visits every 4-10 weeks) 
https://jewishboard.org/about-us/contact-us/

They are both good. Clinicians were very helpful at both. NYU has only one location with those mental services, whereas the Jewish Board has multiple locations in the boroughs. Out of those two, something should work out. Hope this helps!"
