ucla,fodx2i8,t1_fodw6gy,1587691764.0,The account claiming to be Naomi is not Naomi- confirmed.
ucla,fodti3a,t3_g6xqhm,1587689833.0,"As someone who is close with Naomi, this is not her account, and is someone impersonating her."
ucla,fmyas7s,t1_fmxrfnv,1586481866.0,"LOL if you read the responses above (which seemingly none of you all have engaged with), you'd realize that folks did provide very clear information that disputes this post."
ucla,fmxngdq,t1_fmxm74o,1586468274.0,"The problem too is even though departments are mishandling the money, since it's referenda money it can't just be moved. USAC has been demanding accountability from admin for years about it"
ucla,fmxmq97,t1_fmxlslq,1586467887.0,"When the status quo is Muslim students praying next to dumpsters outside Kerckhoff, maybe you'd show some empathy and reconsider how students have been impacted on campus."
ucla,fmxmdyb,t1_fmxljo8,1586467706.0,"[https://usac.ucla.edu/documents/](https://usac.ucla.edu/documents/)

Imagine pretending to care about accountability but not actually supporting steps like these referenda to mitigate the lack of accountability by administration for failing to support historically underrepresented communities on campus."
ucla,fmxlfsa,t1_fmxk1x7,1586467195.0,"The money doesn't go to ""USAC activities."" Read the language."
ucla,fmxjiik,t1_fmx6dwf,1586466161.0,They can't raise your tuition
ucla,fmxi57x,t3_fxy4rl,1586465430.0,"I'm skeptical of proposals to increase fees just as much as anyone else, but this post is riddled with falsehoods and lacks consideration for the communities that are largely running these referenda:

1. The 2,000,000 that is ""unaccounted for"" is not a result of USAC mishandling, but CPO departmental mishandling of funds- refusing to give the money to student-run committees that were designed to focus on access and retention. If you read the article you cited, you'd see that USAC has been working all year to advocate for transparency. Once the money is allocated, USAC loses much of its financial responsibility over the money. Finally, this money is earmarked by the past student bodies who voted for it, it can't just be moved around to another spot.
2. This 9 million dollar budget that exists is largely earmarked for campus departments (such as the CPO, BRC, LGBT Center, CAPS, CARE, etc.) that many students use. This money is not money that USAC can just move around where-ever it deems necessary- it's earmarked by past referenda.
3. Did you read the referenda language? These fees are literally required to fund the creation of a black resource center with a programming budget, pay off the transfer student debt, permanently fund the campus redistribution center, and develop new prayer space for student. Read the language before you call them vague. And, more importantly, don't speak on behalf of what communities do or do not need when many leaders within these same communities are running the referenda themselves.
4. If you paid attention to USAC's weekly announcements, you would know that they are reallocating most of their remaining budget to a COVID-19 relief fund. Relying on surplus to sustainably fund a Black Resource Center doesn't sound like the move.
5. 25% of referenda fees go back to financial aid. Look up the regents policy. It effectively doesn't impact students who are on financial aid because a proportional amount goes back to financial aid. Period.

This post is riddled with inaccuracies that manipulates what would otherwise be meaningful referenda that provide tangible benefits for impacted communities on campus. USAC has its fair share of problems, but this post just isn't it."
