They seem like they really want us to do well, maybe reach out to your TA and see if you can redo some of the work or ask what would help boost your grade? I agree about Lezra though, I can’t focus on her lectures and the reader thing really bugged me."
UCSantaBarbara,fozexpv,t3_gad7tb,1588189519.0,"Hi! Echoing other comments here, people at ucsb are generally into living a healthy lifestyle, working out, eating healthy, stuff like that, but this doesn’t mean everyone is like that!! UCSB is really laid back, and I personally think we are really diverse, with tons of different body types. 

As far as sororities, I personally think all houses are “good” houses! Not every house is a top house, but if you want to join one, I do believe that you’ll end up where you belong. I personally think being in a sorority is rewarding and helped my social life a ton! If you have any questions, feel free to DM, most of reddit is extremely anti-greek life."
