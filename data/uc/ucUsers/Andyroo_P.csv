UCSD,fpcfjji,t3_gcghg8,1588498681.0,So many people don’t like UCSD it seems :’(
UCSD,fpcf8r0,t3_gclyhh,1588498352.0,"COMM 10 is great, especially with Prof. Anderson. No exams and only a few assignments here and there."
UCSD,fp3gmpk,t1_fp3bksx,1588278960.0,Question: do internationals pay more than out-of-state students to be here? People say so but I’m not able to verify it.
UCSD,fowsgzc,t3_g9zmsb,1588126180.0,"There are quite a few families that bike around on campus. Other than that, it's pretty rare to see a student. Only a handful of dining halls and markets are open at extremely restricted hours. Some stuff in PC is also open but at extremely restricted hours. Lawns haven't been mowed in months."

UCSD,fnivz8k,t3_g21hff,1586987329.0,"COMM 10 was great, though the professor I took it with was phenomenal and may have been the main reason why the class was great (Prof. Anderson). There was almost no work and no exams (there were group projects and a small oral exam at the end)."
UCSD,fmdyaid,t3_fuooor,1585982070.0,"The prereq is a 5 in BC calc (which I’d say itself isn’t a good prereq because it correlates poorly with good performance in the 31-series). The classes are proof-based, which can be a learning curve if you are not used to it. If you feel like you can handle the class without this prereq, you should use EASy to petition to take the class."
