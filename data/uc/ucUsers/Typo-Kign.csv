Android,fpinmpc,t1_fph8mcm,1588644690.0,"No need to be a dick about something you know nothing about. Google's approach is better than most but as others have already pointed out, the system is still ripe for abuse.

Also Google has made no effort to chase HIPAA compliance, which tells you everything you need to know about their attitude towards privacy"

UCSD,fp0qps4,t3_gaecv8,1588214832.0,Better CS program and better location. UCLAs campus is nice but stray a little too far and you're in a shitty part of LA
UCSD,fox4ubq,t1_fox0pz4,1588134102.0,Mate the university literally got sent a check for $34 million so that they could refund fees. Some schools even paid their students cash because the stimulus package was so huge. This is insulting.

UCSD,fovtdkq,t3_g9uvxa,1588107189.0,"If I had to speculate here I would guess that lectures are going to be entirely online and discussions/labs will be in person. Keep class sizes limited, don't cram 300 people into a lecture hall. That would also mean professors (many of whom are in their 60s, 70s, ...) who are the most vulnerable could still lecture from home, and 20-something-year-old TAs could lead discussions and labs without much risk."
Coffee,fovckru,t1_fovcftn,1588099056.0,"Sorry, my camera quality is kind of ass. Take a look at the part of the filter closest to the camera, you can kind of see there's a thick crust near the lip of the filter. I don't think that's normal."
Coffee,fovcbw5,t1_fovc4ah,1588098938.0,Yep!
Coffee,fovby5g,t3_g9sohq,1588098757.0,Grinding at a 13 on my Encore. 30g to 500mL water. Still having issues with a crust of grounds sticking to the filter. Following Hoffmann's method exactly. Drawdown ends around 2:50-3:00. I tried swirling the coffee over the stuck grounds but they're stuck on there.
UCSD,fotoarm,t3_g9b08y,1588060331.0,Good thing you're not in Muir. My advisor told me to eat shit. Talk to your college and major advisors and hope they're not massive assholes like mine are

Thanks for the advice, yeah, I will definitely grind finer next time"
HalfLife,fo81yls,t3_g65apc,1587588469.0,"So much of what you just said is completely false. Yes, you should probably avoid playing TF2 and CSGO until Valve releases a statement or puts out a patch.

No, it's very unlikely that someone will be able to dupe items. No, no one will be able to steal your items if you don't launch the game. Even if you do launch the game, if you have Steam Guard 2FA they won't be able to steal your items, even if there is an RCE and it is severe as people are guessing.

No, you should not disable updates. That's literally the dumbest fucking idea, you want to download the patch when Valve releases it. 

So yeah, guys, don't play CSGO or TF2 for a little bit. But at the same time, OP, please delete like 90% of your post because you're just making it sound like you have no clue what you're talking about"

UCSD,fnt623o,t3_g3rxay,1587235308.0,"I got my refund over a week ago, check your billing portal and see if you have a positive balance. 

They also sent me a check in the mail, so I guess you have the option of cashing the check if you need the money and they'll just take away the credit in the billing portal?"
UCSD,fnqybz7,t1_fnqjs4e,1587174925.0,"It's even more subtle than that unfortunately. If you *could be* qualified as a dependent but still claimed yourself (aka me ðŸ˜¢), you don't get a check."

It's fucking bullshit. I'm in college, I'm not a dependent, I make my own money, pay for my own education, pay my taxes, but I don't get shit. I'll survive but I really could have used the money"
