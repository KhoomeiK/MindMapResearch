FunFact: You can see the effects of the Earth's curvature in this picture. You took this picture at the perfect spot to see it. What you are looking at appears to be an island but it is a peninsula. The area to the left of the picture looks like it is water, but there is land that is hidden by the curvature. If you go further to the left, you will see more land (that is more of the mountains).

Now you can show a flat Earther the curvature!"

2. Would it be possible to have some people home and others on campus? I don't think professors could go to class for students on campus then film for the students who are at home. They can film at home with their setup, but it isn't reasonable to then bring a big camera to every class.
