AskReddit,fmo317m,t3_fwfv6k,1586243551.0,"I get really mad at my girlfriend when I have to repeat myself. I hate it. Takes me a while to formulate my thoughts in a conversation (I have ADHD) so when she asks me to repeat something I just said I get this quick frustration that comes out of nowhere. It’s weird because I never had this problem with people that are not in my personal circle. 

It scares me because my dad always had a really short temper growing up so I always feel like I developed a lot of bad habits from him that I don’t want to pass onto those close to me."
