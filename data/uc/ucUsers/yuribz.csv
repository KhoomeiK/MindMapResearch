therewasanattempt,fpcavpf,t1_fpc7tl6,1588493675.0,"I mean each of the prophets was sent for specific reason, to preach the specific part of his word. Moses provided the code of law, Isaiah reminded that people need to behave, Amos kinda same, Jonah warned the people of Nineveh, Samuel oversaw the establishment of the Kingdom of Israel, etc. Sending one messenger would be hard because some stuff needed to be clarified, people needed to be reminded that the divine law exists and stuff like that. Jesus came because God was done with people breaking laws and just told them to believe, thus completely reforming the religion. Don't know what exactly Mohammed preached, but I believe him being the last prophet was also because he was sent to preach something important that set off a completely different religion. So, there needed to be many prophets because people constantly forgot what was the point and stuff"

I know he talks about a different thing in it, but you can kinda connect it to that as well because he's talking about accepting the word of God)"

SequelMemes,foxg333,t1_fox62hm,1588142915.0,"A huge problem for Abrams was that he was severely limited during the production of TRoS. I read an interview with one of the former producers or something that Disney made a lot of changes in order to make the movie as fan service as possible. We can only guess what exactly Abrams planned to do for IX. And yeah, TLJ definitely caused some discrepancies with what the original path for the trilogy might have been

ANormalDayInRussia,fom9x26,t1_fom1mv1,1587882739.0,"Actually the Soviet times was when Ukraine did very well economically and what not. USSR really treated it well in the 60's. Imperial Russia is when Ukraine wasn't treated that well. 

Also, there's also an alternative theory that Ukraine means ""v kraina"", so ""inner land""."

UCSD,foi7k8g,t1_foi7bmz,1587780364.0,"As u/FructoseGuardian posted, there is no restriction on DSC 10 anymore, so just first pass it and you'll probably be good to go. There will probably be only one/two sections though (that was the case last Fall), so that might be an issue. Everyone needs to take 10, so the class is more or less filled. It will be easier without the restriction, however, so good luck"

UCSD,foi66mf,t3_g7l5pw,1587779536.0,"All math classes are not that hard to get in, just keep in mind that they might fill up fast so prioritize taking them. For DSC 10, if you're a Data Science major, you get priority anyway and won't have any issues with it. Otherwise you will need to submit an EASY request because the class is major restricted."

Sequels are still Star Wars, and enough many fans dislike them, there is still a huge amount of people, both old fans and newcomers, who like the new movies. And the point of this meme is to remind people that even if you hate the sequels, that's not a valid reason to hate the fans of sequels. What bad did they do? Is it their fault that they like a movie? Is it their fault that the movies might have faulty writing or moments that don't make sense? People can like whatever they want"

But Russian alphabet, if starting from English, is literally one of the easiest alphabets to learn because it is similar enough to Latin alphabet due to shared derivation from Greek.
