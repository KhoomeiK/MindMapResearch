I’m not going to role up in a gm nightfall with an anti barrier sidearm and just  get absolutely shit on because I’m at such a close range. And limiting anti barrier to two mods a season is ludicrous the whole play the way you want to play is bs when I have to use a preset that requires me to run a side arm or smg. Then we have exotics that aren’t even brought into the new system leaving out old PVE power house primaries like outbreak perfected, ace of spades, thorn, lumina, and many more. Not only does having to rely on these mods make PVE an absolute chore which isn’t the problem the extra challenge should be there but it makes it unfun. Nightfalls used to be run whatever was good and try and fight your way through with your inherent skill and wit to get through mechanics but because they added champions without having a system in place to bring every weapon in the game to counter them it has limited nightfalls to essentially running a boring and repetitive load out that is painfully underwhelming at times. I miss the days where I could pull out ace of spades and feel like I wasn’t holding my team back in a nightfall. But now I have to run a legendary primary or something like erianas vow to even play a high level nightfall. I’ve been playing since year 1 of Destiny 1 and I have never been this bored or annoyed with the new PVE system. And the new leveling system has caused more issues than it’s worth. If having no light cap is going to essentially cut 3/4 of your player base from higher tier nightfalls than what’s the point in running the endgame nightfall. If only those who want to play bounty simulator day in and out to rank up their artifact to a ridiculous power level can play it. While I’m all for skillful play and dedication to hardcore players the gm nightfall loot is subpar for the amount of effort put in. It’s like yeah thanks I love getting 5 masterwork cores and an under leveled exotic that I already have a better role on. Also no blue flame like back in destiny 1 if they brought that back for gm nightfalls with the 3x xp boost you would have a lot more players trying to get through a gm nightfall."
sharditkeepit,fnqd1n4,t3_g3bhce,1587162227.0,"It’s good but there are better rolls and perks that may be more valuable depending on your play style. Snapshot is an all around good perk but on a 150 which is a light weight frame it intrinsically has better handling so to me snap shot isn’t as valuable since the handling is already good. Opening shot is a contender for the best perk in that slot, it’s increase to accuracy and stability allow you to get that instant first headshot which is really valuable. Since you’re on console you may favor stability more so than range and appendage mag isn’t really useful other than adding a few extra bullets ricochet or high cal rounds are the two best in slot perks. I don’t know what your masterwork is but I think your roll should be ok. I love my god roll waking vigil and it intrinsically feels really good on console but if you really want to spice it up try and go for opening shot slide shot you’ll never want to go back. The ability to stack both perks and potentially get two instant crits that stack together (opening shot and slide shot stack) or if you space out opening shot proc three crits. Overall I’d use your roll if you feel content with it. Snapshot feels good and snappy and opening shot is just an all around buff. Try it out see how you feel about it first."

DestinyMemes,fnea077,t1_fne0dz7,1586885657.0,Yeah same here god of war and super black were two of the coolest single color shaders back in the day
SWORDS,fmxm5a4,t1_fmxhrwz,1586467575.0,"This is really cool, I was wondering since you have tested many macuahuitl, how often would you have to maintain and replace the blades, did they essentially become clubs after a short span of use, and would you consider it a reliable weapon for the time period and battle fields it was utilized on?"
ucr,fm2hq55,t1_fm2druw,1585697713.0,Yeah but he was using a racial slur as his name the ta’s figured out that it could be attached to an SID and the professor kicked him thank god.
