UCSD,fpepnrr,t3_gd10sz,1588552276.0,I think it’s a great show of what working with a team is like in a real world application.
compsci,fozq71g,t3_gaco3x,1588194946.0,"I got into my college only knowing pre-calc. I had to take pre-calc, calc 1, then calc1 again but for engineers to begin my the math major requirements for computer science. I highly recommend getting it done if you can in highschool or over the summer at your local community college."
