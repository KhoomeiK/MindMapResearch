Tbh everytime I let my environment get to me, I try to take a step back and remember why I'm even going here in the first place. It might not be the same for you, but I just wanted to share, but my goal is to get an education in order to get a good enough job to be financially independent from my family. So then, I can live on my own terms, and not have to live with some constant anxiety. So what I mean is, even though the situation might be horrible, as cheesy as it sounds, keep looking forward. Take advantage of what everybody in here is saying and talk to your professors, and remember that this will eventually pass. Keep trying to stay sane, we all here trying together <3"
