AskReddit,fongp25,t1_fommvrr,1587919149.0,"Sleep paralysis is most often caused by the brain being “awake” but still carrying out dream like functions. Your body goes into a form of paralysis when you sleep, to keep you from falling out of the tree (your bed) or thrashing around and hurting yourself/others. However, sometimes the brain will “wake up” but it didn’t complete the process, resulting in an awake person that can’t move. While in this state, your brain is also most likely coming out of a REM sleep cycle, aka, dreaming. The brain usually dreams every night, but we just don’t remember the vast majority of it. It’s during this dreaming period when your body is in full paralysis. So, if you “wake up” improperly during this time, your body can’t move and it is still “dreaming” which can manifest itself as scary shadow demons or things on your chest preventing you from moving. It’s your lizard brain trying to make sense of what is happening to the body when nothing should be there causing it to be unresponsive. “I can’t move, there must be a shadow demon in the room. Of fuck there it is, on my chest! Oh would you look at that, I can move now, and the shadow demon is gone. Must have been a succubus holding me down to the bed. What’s sleep paralysis?” 

Now why these hallucinations seem to take humanoid forms and appear as shadows is still a mystery. Potentially linked to our perceptions of the self."

One night, I’m driving home from work. The road I take is a bit back countryish in one area, so it’s not uncommon to see animals as you’re driving through the dark. 

This night, I’m coming across a bend in the road and my headlights catch the reflective eyes of something low to the ground staring at me from the scrub bushes off the side of the road. At first I think “oh cool, a fox or maybe a weasel thing”. However, the eyes then begin to move up as this thing goes from being a foot off the ground to being close to 6 feet off the ground in an few moments. This all happens right as I’m making the turn and passing this creature by, so by the time I realize just how big this thing is, I’ve already left it behind. I freak out for a minute thinking “Bear? Werewolf? Person?” Then my rational brain takes over and I eliminate all those options as being ridiculous, other than maybe the bear. A few minutes later, I realize that I had just caught a huge deer eating by the side of the road. Had his head low eating some grass and my car passing by caused him to look up rapidly.

UCSC,fngilz4,t3_g1jo3t,1586933403.0,"So as others said, you being a transfer student limits your options. 

However, there are ups and downs of each of the main transfer housing areas.

Porter: Lots of interesting people and murals everywhere. It has an artsy/care free vibe to it. Right next to the Squiggle (God) so you get wonderful sunsets and views of the ocean and woods. However, it can be a bit noisy and chaotic and the students have a reputation for being immature. Some parties happen here, and plenty of substance use. People tend to be more artistic and expressive here. The college has a decent dining hall and it is not terribly far from arguably one of the best ones. There are apartments, but they are usually reserved for continuing/older students. Most of the housing is Dorm so, yeah. You can get a single, but don't be surprised if you get put into a small triple or quad. No real student parking lot, so if you have your car it most likely will be off campus or at the west remote parking lot.

Redwood Grove: Special housing for first year transfer students aged 23 and up (but this changes every year depending on the average age of applicants, so sometimes it may be 24 or 22). Apartment style housing only, this places you half way up the campus on the left side, so lots of things are within walking distance once you learn the paths. Smack dab in the middle of a bunch of redwoods and wooden bridges, its very quiet and peaceful here. Very beautiful, with hiking paths in the valley below your decks. Not too many parties happen and most houses stick to themselves but there will always be people looking to hang out and say hi. There are two parking lots you can apply for, but the C permits get snatched up almost as soon as they become available. C permits allow you to park in specific lots on campus, but no guarantees which one you will get. One major problem of these apartments is it gets dark much quicker than porter. Also since it is apartment style living with up to 5 other people, space can be a bit tight at times, but the rooms are big enough for 1-2 people to be comfortable. 

The other colleges I am not terribly familiar with when it comes to housing and culture, but they are more or less similar layouts with dorm rooms in Residence halls and Apartments in specific buildings. 

IF you get the chance to live somewhere else, most of the places are ok. Cowell is the oldest college so it can be a bit run down at times, but they have the best views of the ocean, quick access to many sporting activities, and are right next to the Bookstore, which can be useful. Stevenson is just a more remote version of Cowell, which are on the right side of campus. Both Cowell and Stevenson are party colleges though so expect lots of noise. Oakes is also older and its pretty far from the rest of campus on the bottom, so it is usually quiet down there. Close access to the west remote parking as well. Rachel Carson is more modern but a bit busy and has lots of stairs leading directly to porter and Oakes. Wonderful architecture. Kresge is like an extension of Porter but a bit on the older side and slopes upward more. They are doing construction, but I don't think that's for housing. 9/10 are pretty similar to each other at the top of campus, and are the newest colleges. Everything there is fairly modern, with many apartment style housing options. They have, in my opinion, the best dining hall, and quickest access to the most services. However, it can be a bit of a busy place. Finally, Merrill and Crown are sort of the outliers in the remote top left of campus. They are known to be VERY quiet and studious places, but with that you get less friendly and outgoing people. The architecture is a little bland, but its surrounded by woods with a view of the ocean. You also have the quickest access to the north campus woods and pogonip which are amazing hiking destinations. 

Also, there is more... unique housing. You can live in the Village in the center/bottom of campus (absolutely do not live in the village, it is awful), off campus university housing (don't recommend as its right off of pacific ave and the building is a little dated, unless you want a night life then it should be pretty nice, but you also have easy access to the bus system) or the trailer park (they are famous for their raging and wild parties, but I think they have the coolest spot on campus). However, it is a trailer park so expect some interesting people and a unique living experience. Finding an apartment in SC is mostly just luck of the draw on if you can find an affordable place, with enough roommates you like, that is also within driving distance of the campus, and be ok with most likely inhabiting that place for 2+ years."
UCSC,fnggnof,t3_g1l1w3,1586931638.0,"UCSC has substance free housing, and they also have opportunities for substance free events/former addict help. You also have lots of power to control potential roommates from engaging in substances as well if you get RA's involved before it becomes an issue.

todayilearned,fmwiyql,t1_fmvlbq7,1586447422.0,"Movies are just a bunch of pictures moving really fast.

Music is just a bunch of sounds being played in harmony.

Or there can be a little bit of nuance and understanding that like most things in life, human interpretation and importance to a subject will change. YOU may view wine as just a bunch of flavors, but to many others they view it as an artistic expression with countless variables that go into each unique production time for a bottle."

NatureIsFuckingLit,fmm5fxv,t1_fmm3xns,1586199131.0,"Yes, Manatees are very chill. The most they will do is ram you or hit you with their tail if they are scared or you are threatening them or their young. They cant leave the water like a walrus can, and they don't have any sharp bits like the teeth of a walrus. 

I wouldn't approach a wild one or get in the water with wild manatees just for general safety of you and them, but if you are in a kayak or boat, they will often come right up to you and just check you out before gliding away. This leads them to getting close to propellers which can kill them or leave them with deep scars for life.

The dolphins in that video near the middle are probably more dangerous than your average manatee is."

Did Michael fart or something? The audio cuts out for a second and he then says ""Excuse me."""
