Madden,fpkhz5j,t3_gdxjk7,1588695033.0,This isn't pass interference. If anything its offensive pass interference for trying to fight through the defender instead of around him. The defensive player has every right for positioning on the field as an offensive player.

Damaging student funded buildings increases costs to student funds. Thats buildings that students pay for. Housing and dining halls. Those will only in return literally cost you money.

The other buildings are paid for by state funding, aka, the Universities money. (Think offices and whatnot)

That's why I believe my max for OHP went from 135 to 225 in about 6-7 months and got into repping in the 300s for bench just as quickly. 1 minute between sets following the nsuns program has been great. The rest time also boosted my pull ups too. I started soing sets of 8 a month ago, with 1 minute rests in between until I did 100 reps, now I'm up to sets of 16. Ive tried with 2 minute rests and havent increased my pull up per set anymore than the 1 minute rest."

I also don't think going to failure on excercises every time is a great strategy. For body weight excercises it's a good strategy to just set a time for your sets and do as many as you can within that time limit. Say, 30 seconds. 

Like for body weight squats my failure would be like 300 reps, and yeah, I'd feel like dying if I added those to my workout 3 times a week too."

Fitness,fna2cs3,t3_g0fp5e,1586789677.0,"Your muscles suck in water to help with the healing process. Most beginners see this weight gain when they first start lifting. It actually tricks beginner workouts in thinking they gained muscles right away as some parts can look ""swollen"". (It's increased blood and water in the muscles) As long as you're convinced that you're counting calories properly then that's all it is and I would pretend like it's not even there. 

If you continue to gain weight at this point chances are you aren't counting calories properly because after that initial weight gain chances are you're at a calorie surplus. Muscle usually takes weeks to months to build up to a noticeable point. (Think like 2-6 month range)"

All of my players wear full pads 5 times a week, including their game on Saturday. (6 times a week for 2 hours a day) My track team does add strength running once a week, up a hill, with weights or parachutes. So doesn't almost every other single track team that I've seen. The work I was doing every other day had been my routine for 3 years, adding the strength runs broke the plateau.

Fitness,fmwa9eg,t3_fxm2wr,1586442781.0,"All of the studies done that show damage to the body with running with weighted vests and ankle weights have been done on distance running.

All of the studies done with sprinting and only using them occasionally with short distance is nothing but positive results.

The internet is very simple minded so they only see the damaging aspect of it and then say all running with weights is bad. (Isn't this what football players do? They add an additional 20 pounds on their body frequently with their equipment.)

In fact, running uphill with ankle weights and a weighted vest once a week for about 10 minutes is exactly what I credit my 40 yard dash time improvement too. A couple of months of that (only 80 minutes in 2 months) improved my time from like a 4.8 to a 4.4 back in high school."

Seriously, you can walk right through a group of turkeys, deer, within touching distance and sometimes they pretend like you're not even there. Frequently I've walked within 2-3 feet away coyotes who were more interested in chasing a ground squirrel then they were about me. A baby coyote and I met up at the same location every morning for weeks on my walk to work, I'd say hi, it would turn it's head sideways, and then we would walk away from each other.
