Flipping,fp8y69g,t1_fp8xaee,1588407165.0,"From my understanding, Target is not taking returns in stores (but mail-in yes). When they take returns again, you‚Äôd have up to 45 days to return the item in stores (even if your return window was supposed to expire during the time they aren‚Äôt accepting returns)."
churning,fp3szfs,t1_fp25fe8,1588285244.0,"Any substantial amount of self referrals will likely end up with your account suspended. I bought referrals a while ago and made a few hundred, but acc got suspended in the end."
DesignerReps,foq24z8,t1_fopqdqe,1587980218.0,"If you want a response you have to post your question in the correct discussion thread, not as a stand-alone thread"
UCI,fo8da2i,t3_g69d0l,1587594364.0,"I would be a little irked that I don‚Äôt get the same advantage as the people in the class, but ultimately I wouldn‚Äôt be that upset. I‚Äôm being graded with people going through the same midterm in the same situation, not with those who are getting open note tests. You were basically just put in the same situation that almost every 2B class before you were like. 

2B is generally a highly curved class, so your current grade wouldn‚Äôt necessarily reflect your final grade. Probably more so considering the current situation. Just keep at it and try to understand the material the best you can."
muacirclejerk,fo56o27,t1_fo4bsy8,1587518671.0,"If you do decide to throw your money at DE and you end up having a problem with their products, I think you should be able to get a refund fairly easily. My friend bought the babyfacial and it was waay too strong for him and they let him send it back."
churning,fo0sksz,t1_fnzhs92,1587418981.0,"Have you looked into Fetch instead (or in addition to)? I tried Ibotta a while ago but I didn‚Äôt like that you only really earn money when you buy specific products. Fetch gives bonuses on specific products, but you also get a sort of ‚Äúbase‚Äù earning with every receipt regardless of items purchased."
investing,fntzkme,t1_fntx7zg,1587251623.0,I‚Äôve been able to pay for it via CC by setting up a membership online. They use the CC as a backup payment method...and my linked bank account seems to always be empty...
churning,fnd7q19,t1_fnahonh,1586861945.0,"I don‚Äôt currently use a roboinvestor, but I used to have accounts at quite a few of them. If you want to use one, I would recommend Axos Invest (formerly WiseBanyan) because it‚Äôs the only roboinvestor I‚Äôve found that charges no management fees. 

You only start paying management fees if you want to take advantage of additional features like tax loss harvesting.

Edit: actually I lied, I‚Äôm currently using Acorns but only because I get it for free as a student and their Found Money feature is marginally useful."
UCI,fn1cdca,t3_fy4nsr,1586559102.0,"I noticed that some people, like Malik Carmichael and Jacob Lohrbach, have their slate as Anteaters for Anteaters, but still mention in their description that their slate is Fund the Clubs."
personalfinance,fmx4tnk,t1_fmwjzun,1586458474.0,"Housing still may exist around a college that isn‚Äôt solely owned by the college. Near my school, students living in these third party housing communities can‚Äôt cancel their lease."

The subreddit is still around and fairly active. I don‚Äôt think anybody has actually gotten a million dollars, but that doesn‚Äôt mean winners don‚Äôt get anything."
Tonedeafcelebs,fmrsjmg,t1_fmrrj0h,1586333902.0,"The celebrity have the right to host RT/following giveaways (and it‚Äôs certainly nice to have the chance to win the money), but I think because of the intent behind it, it shouldn‚Äôt necessarily be listed as one of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù things that they do. It‚Äôs just very good marketing. I wouldn‚Äôt say company is doing  good if they are hosting a giveaway for XYZ. The same applies for celebrities. 

Mr. Beast is actually a little upfront about his giveaways. He admits it gets him views, and that becomes profit. To be clear, wanting followers and profit is not bad, but I see giveaways as purely a brand/business reinvestment rather than being nice or doing good."
Tonedeafcelebs,fmri3pa,t1_fm397so,1586323879.0,"Eh, I think the giving away thousands of dollars is just a cheap and easy way of buying hundreds of thousands of new, active followers. The money would do much more good given to charity (and would even be able to reach those who are too poor to even be on the Internet), but giving to charity won‚Äôt result in as much followers as a ‚Äúgoodwill‚Äù giveaway."
