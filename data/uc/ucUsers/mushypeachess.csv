AvPD,fodxybh,t3_g6vtx8,1587692243.0,"For me personally, Iâ€™m jealous of everyone having so many friends and people they know, especially on social media. I know itâ€™s a stupid thing to be jealous about but I always wanted to be like those cool social media kids but I have barely any followers/friends and Iâ€™m worried that if I post something then ppl will laugh at me for getting 2 likes. I remember being a freshman and learning about the negative effects of social media and making ppl feel lonely and everyone in my class (who were all fairly popular) didnâ€™t agree and Iâ€™m just sitting there thinking it might not be such a bad thing yknoww but yeah :/"
berkeley,fodwi80,t3_g6rwvu,1587691458.0,Mannn... I just hope whatever decision they make will be a solid decision. I donâ€™t want to stress over whether I should choose online school for fall or if I should go in person to have that freshman experience. Just pick one!! Iâ€™m a horrible decision maker ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–
