UCI,fp3t608,t1_fp3qih7,1588285340.0,Ego is a perfect description of some professors mentality to teaching. It’s understandable they are passionate about their subject but most undergrad degrees require us to have a basic understanding about many fields related to our majors. Yet there are a surprising amount of poor upper div professors who don’t understand this expectation for us.

UCI,fos6whl,t3_g991lv,1588025056.0,"Spent all of Winter Quarter interviewing for jobs, landed a sick job at a start up with really great compensation and it got rescinded. Asked for another shot at interviewing for a company I rejected and I got the job but waiting on the offer. I know I should be grateful that I’ll have a job after graduation but I’m having a hard time being happy about the job I was able to get after realizing what I could’ve been doing instead."

>27 y/o Brooklyn artist. For those who enjoy chill/mellow rap. Good range of pace in his songs with solid beats. If I had to compare him to a well-known artist, it would be 6lack."

Brady is slow and methodical, Winston is crazy and unpredictable. Owning Mike Evans last year was a blast; once I saw Winston’s eyes light up down field I knew I was either getting 10+ points in one play or 1 IDP tackle point from Evans tackling the DB.
