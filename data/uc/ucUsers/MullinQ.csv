natureismetal,fpasf04,t3_gc5i7t,1588454738.0,The human equivalent of 60 meters is: 60 meters. Epic spider.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fox29na,t1_fowot3x,1588132365.0,Not to mention the fact that this is a train track not a kart-like vehicle you can sit on.
mallninjashit,fouzhxd,t3_g9pd6r,1588092927.0,Kinda acting like he invented that. As if X-acto boxcutters don't use the same system
MechanicAdvice,fot9hh5,t3_g9bnfh,1588047807.0,Sounds like lugs made in chiyna

UCSD,forpeoo,t1_forkqq4,1588016176.0,"It is hard to say what each professor is thinking. It's pretty clear they all see this in different ways. Thanks for the good wishes, hope you can enjoy your next few weeks !"
UCSD,foriu0p,t3_g92od5,1588012966.0,"I think this has pushed a lot of people beyond their limits in a lot of different ways, I know it has for me. I just wanted to reinforce that there's not a single person who wants to make you feel bad for falling behind on something as trivial as grades and schoolwork now, so don't forget to spend some time seeking fulfillment outside of school so you don't go mad about something out of your control. I hoped UCSD would encourage their professors to handle this in a different way but I'm at least comforted to know we're all having similar experiences (even if that's a little selfish of me)."
whatisthisthing,fomz73n,t1_foldndh,1587908186.0,Likely Solved!
whatisthisthing,fomz5ua,t1_folffvc,1587908160.0,"Ok I stacked a few coasters in there. They fit, but the Gap is so ridiculously small or couldn't really hold more than 2 or 3 at a time. I still can't find this specific design online but this is by far the most plausible explanation so I'll tag it as a likely solved. Thanks for the idea!"
whatisthisthing,fole0we,t1_foldndh,1587860220.0,Do you happen to know how they stack up in there? I can't find it on the internet. I'd like to give it a try.
whatisthisthing,folbh9w,t1_folb7e9,1587858712.0,It's about 2/3 the size of 1 banana
whatisthisthing,folb1w6,t3_g83tb1,1587858461.0,"Apparently this was a gift to my mother that was never explained (or she has forgotten). It's very light and unstable unless it's positioned exactly how it's shown in the photo. Also, the two halves are connected by rods at a small angle above parallel. (The two wooden pieces are slightly further apart at the long end, and slightly closer at the smaller crescent end). 

The larger end is too big for a wine bottle, and I tried looking for similar wine holders, just in case, but nothing showed up. I am unsure where to begin after that."
Beekeeping,fm5wc6v,t1_fm0xama,1585781290.0,"I have similar issues often with my hives. I'm from the northeast so we occasionally lose hives to the cold and leave them out unknowingly. Before you go and put a new package in there I'd give your frames a look. Removing mouldy frames and cleaning out the bottom of the hive will reduce the workload on your new bees, and make sure to check for any insect/ mouse activity so there's nothing to worry about when you get your package installed. Leaving healthy looking wax and capped honey is great, so if the frames looks good keep them in there."
