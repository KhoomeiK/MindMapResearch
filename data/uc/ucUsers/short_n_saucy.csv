Piece of advice: going for the big boys first makes everything else seem a lot easier"
MLBTheShow,fpgesfx,t3_gdb6b3,1588601231.0,Again with the repeat legends. This is getting out of hand. They have so many options at their disposal they could have saved the big 3 higher-tier cards for later when it would be more fresh
UCI,fp6efxu,t3_gbao6z,1588350928.0,I actively talk shit to my professors when I take those. Some of these questions are god awful and they need to hear about it
MLBTheShow,fp2eha1,t3_gav804,1588260356.0,They seriously need to stop picking legends that already have cards in the game. Do they only have the rights to 12 legends this year or something?
Connery,fowb0jg,t3_g9vi7t,1588116324.0,"T1DE does a lot of small ops stuff, good group of people over there though they don’t run everyday"
Project_Winter,fost7ln,t3_g94c4e,1588037553.0,This and the inventory scroll need to stop
Project_Winter,fost6yx,t1_foskkj0,1588037542.0,"If you don’t have “Survivor” plastered on your screen, you may not be able to spell it backwards off the top of your head. Basically they’re trying to figure out who the traitor is without playing the game"
MLBTheShow,for0bjm,t3_g92c02,1588003961.0,A general good rule of thumb is to not tell other people what to do with their money
OaklandAthletics,foquzan,t3_g91q4e,1588001297.0,The MLB has not officially cancelled any games. You won’t get your refunds until the portion of the season is cancelled rather than postponed
baseball,fonluf2,t3_g8dzy7,1587921979.0,Every bowling alley has one of these. It’s the law.

MLBTheShow,fogve4n,t3_g7e9h3,1587757401.0,I made 30k before everything sorta calmed down now
MLBTheShow,foedk89,t1_foeayzl,1587701221.0,This is objectively untrue lol
formuladank,foc125d,t3_g60cji,1587665930.0,I feel like the Carlos boxing montages have me leaning towards him
formula1,fo9lwcf,t1_fo9lf5y,1587623404.0,I’m gonna assume Albin was making his way down the pit lane when he pulled off cause the overheating
MLBTheShow,fo9fj6n,t3_g5ki3g,1587618114.0,"As a rule of thumb, I only pick players that I have heard of before. Clearly I have not been keeping up with prospects lately"
MLBTheShow,fo5hv48,t1_fo5hjae,1587526020.0,"Not better than Luzardo, but they are #1 and #2 in the A’s prospect rankings"
MLBTheShow,fo436l9,t3_g5ki3g,1587497413.0,Ima kill for AJ Puk.
MLBTheShow,fnxgc7z,t3_g4du38,1587338046.0,"If they do it, I assume it would be a 2002 MVP card"
MLBTheShow,fnwml3m,t3_g47as1,1587321266.0,Welcome to the AJ Puk show
baseball,fnlohzi,t3_g2f568,1587057013.0,"While I don’t have the exact numbers I doubt that is actually the case. Sponsorship and TV make up at least 65% of the assets.

Fun fact: if 0 people bought tickets to Packers games, they would still break even"
MLBTheShow,fnf40fg,t3_g1e8cj,1586900997.0,"Yeah I’m going to give this game a couple days. Pretty tired of the crapshoot fielding ATM. I trust they’ll fix it, but it’s not worth the stress for now."
MLBTheShow,fnc83kh,t1_fnc5pnv,1586830650.0,The devs probably can’t fix it due to the virus and not being in the office
Games,fn3vkbe,t1_fn3uqdx,1586628758.0,It’s pretty fun if you can get lucky with the servers. Certainly worth picking up if your played Warband
MLBTheShow,fmxq99x,t3_fy1nzb,1586469780.0,Yall didnt actually expect anything crazy when they're offering the pack to everyone right?
MLBTheShow,fmxcstk,t3_fxzj5y,1586462601.0,These packs are not gonna be good if they’re letting everyone get one
MLBTheShow,fmv1p58,t1_fmv0xv3,1586403897.0,Yes grow a pair and be an adult while complaining about the game on Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/MLBTheShow/comments/fxjc8l/this_is_the_stuff_that_annoys_me_im_hold_left/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
OaklandAthletics,fmqm1kz,t3_fwqewc,1586302279.0,"You won’t get refunds until MLB decides what to officially do. Just be patient, if the games aren’t played in Oakland you’ll get your money back, but they won’t do anything till there’s an official MLB statement"
MLBTheShow,fmmlgkg,t3_fw6xk3,1586207442.0,"This is an annoying trend. We already have a Smotlz just like we already had a Vida and Franco. I really wish they would save these for later on in the year, would be nicer to see some different legends before we start making copies"
