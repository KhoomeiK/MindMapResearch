ucla,fpjxnre,t3_gdx9gp,1588683616.0,"Make USAC open source

Open source means transparent, and accessible, and it listens to you to give you what you want.

But why should you care about the internal structure of USAC? I get it, you care about what we deliver, not how we work. But how we work means everything about what we can deliver. 

So let’s break it down.

1. The budget should be public, analyzed, and TRANSPARENT: ( facebook.com/OrionUSAC/posts/238883897522440 )

2. Meeting minutes should be notes rather than masquerading as transcripts. They should have timestamps to the USAC Live video so people can see what they’re referring to for themselves.

3. Previously, the video and sound quality of USAC’s meeting live streams made it difficult for students to participate if they couldn’t make it in person (see link). With Zoom, it’s great (see link). Video views have spiked since the transition (\~20 vs 1925 views). So, as Council member Brandon recommended, let's keep using Zoom, even after returning to in person meetings so we are ACCESSIBLE to people who can’t come.

4. Let's centralize everything in one place so they are ACCESSIBLE. Right now things are an impenetrable morass, but we can fix that and make them accessible to ordinary students. There are too many funds to apply to, so let's combine them. There are too many sites to find info, so lets combine them. There are too many office names  (TSR, ISR, FAC, CEC, CSC, CAC … I didn’t even recognize “USAC” last year) for students to know, so let’s stamp one name, USAC, on all the things we do. That way it’s clear what we do and what we do is TRANSPARENT. There are too many acronyms to be ACCESSIBLE so let’s stop using them (especially when one acronym can mean 3 different things). Let’s centralize the recruitment process so that there is one form to apply to all offices. And so on. Things don’t have to be this confusing.

5. Project Management Software

Imagine a publicly ACCESSIBLE board (like meister-task or monday.com) representing every task that USAC offices are working on.

Tasks could be split up into open, in progress, needing-discussion, and closed. 

Open tasks build ACCESSIBILITY by allowing more students to get involved. Just like open source projects, students can look at the list of tasks that need people and volunteer to work on a specific one. This means busy students can still meaningfully contribute without sitting through irrelevant meetings (unless they want to).

In progress tasks show students at a glance see what is being worked on, potentially eliminating the need for officer reports (new post coming soon). Instead, students can at any time just consult the list of in progress tasks for a given officer to see what they’re up to.

Needing-discussion tasks become the agenda for the weekly USAC meetings, so there are NO SURPRISES. Tell me, can you currently find the bylaw changes we’re planning to discuss at today’s meeting? How about for next week’s meeting? 

6. Bylaw change forms

Let’s require that the reason for every change be printed on the bylaw change form. This sort of record keeping of why exactly USAC does things (in addition to what exactly was changed) is essential to making things ACCESSIBLE to students who aren’t familiar with the context surrounding these changes, and to future generations of USAC officers who want to understand why they’re inheriting the bylaws they do.

7. Let’s use STV voting for budget allocation (so that surplus allocation isn’t nasty). See \[youtu.be/WXPlcUJGBXY?t=19923\] for an example of how nasty it can get - the meeting went on till 1:23AM, and in the end the surplus was allocated on the basis of everyone being exhausted and resorting to an significantly flawed system of averaging that was easy to game.

8. Let’s limit meetings to 10pm, so that it is ACCESSIBLE for students to attend the whole meeting. This is especially important since voting takes place at the end of the meeting - if it drags on till 3AM (like it did on March 10 when, we quit before reaching my discussion item “efficient officer reports” \[docs.google.com/document/d/1bqk\_BuicQF\_fKTiMOpNq3xBrfj9qBVpcoZ\_2pTXIFcs/edit\]), it’s almost impossible for students to watch their government vote on decisions and still make it to class the next morning. As it currently stands, the most contentious (and therefore crucial) votes effectively occur privately in the dead of the night.

9. Let’s make public comment a dialog, instead of requiring officers to not respond to questions. Students should be able to hear back from their elected representatives about their concerns, instead of being met with mandatory silence.

10. Let’s improve meeting ACCESSIBILITY.  Have signs pointing to the weekly meetings, have signs that there is a meeting, have the doors open, and have signs with the rules of the discussion so that normal students know what is going on and how to participate.

PROVIDING YOU VALUE/LISTENING TO YOU: 

These 10 approaches would ensure that USAC is intimately connected with the student body and that it works on stuff that YOU want. No surprises. Just understanding.

In the middle of a pandemic this may not seem so important, but note that pandemic preparation didn’t look too important until we were in the middle of a pandemic, and wildfire preparation didn’t look too important until we were beset by wildfires. If recent events have taught us anything, it’s that we should address problems before they turn into crises, even as we work on other urgent things. 

If you want these improvements, vote Orion on MyUCLA ( bit.ly/usac2020vote ), from right now till 1PM on Friday.

STV (single transferable vote) is one type of ranked choice voting. There are many types of ranked choice voting, such as Condorcet, which is arguably more fair (but easier to game).

The issue with voting is Arrow's impossibility theorem, which mathematically proves that you can't have a perfect voting system. So, you have to balance strengths and weaknesses for each system. I could have made a much longer post why I like STV in particular and the trade offs, but that's for another time.

ucla,fpimkoi,t3_gdozse,1588644042.0,"But Orion, ""only the general representative race uses STV, all other positions use alternative vote"".

ucla,fpemm23,t1_fp348sn,1588550477.0," Hi u/USACInsiderBurner,

First off, I appreciate the way you wrote a neutral analysis of the slate and USAC situation. The fact that you can do this, in my mind (and I guess  u/dbjcbruin23 's mind), means that you’re the right person to consider running for office. Also, thank you for your concern for my well being. I can assure you that I am doing well.

As for the rest of my slate, you’re right that they have little experience. But I’d like to point out that before I was elected, I had even less experience. Two quarters ago, I wasn’t elected for my experience. People elected me for the work I would do (like on that LAX bus), not had already done. And now, the people on my slate have much more experience than I had, even if they don’t stress that. A few of them have served in my cabinet, where they helped research options, negotiate with admin, and analyze the budget. Our candidate for transfer rep meanwhile was Co-President of the Honor Transfer Club at her community college. 

Regarding shared values: the reason why Jong Hyeon has the same bullet list of platforms as me is that we do share platforms. He’s my chief advisor, and we’ve worked together on everything that I’ve done in office. As such, there’s not too much that one can change about our bullet list of shared goals besides scrambling the order. If you want to hear his unique voice though, I highly encourage you to read his candidate statement on [https://www.uclaelectionsboard.org/candidates](https://www.uclaelectionsboard.org/candidates).

Regarding people getting involved for the wrong reasons: you raise a good point. That’s why I started a discussion on sortition, a possible solution to this problem: reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gaqf30/what\_if\_random\_bruins\_ran\_usac\_detail\_in\_a\_comment/

Regarding shared missions: people that you are friends with, tend to believe in the same causes - and people that share beliefs tend to be friends. I don’t think we can cleanly separate the two. I do generally dislike political parties because they stifle independent candidates. However, USAC elections use STV voting (https://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom-single-transferable-vote) precisely so that won’t happen, so I’m not too worried about that.

Thanks for your time. Regards,

Orion

ucla,fp1fshx,t1_fp1eg3a,1588234049.0,"Hi u/namhsor,

The idea is that no one volunteers to be in the lottery. UCLA has a directory of all students and can just pick someone randomly (who had no intention of participating). Imagine you got an email/MyUCLA alert asking you to report to duty. You'd feel outraged, until they told you that they would compensate you for your time. Then you might do it. The only thing we have to fear is that you won't. Then we get the statistical non response bias you pointed out.

As for not having background knowledge, that's why the normal political process is still used for electing the house, for generating the proposals, and informing the senate. The senate (sortition body) would only decide on approval or disapproval. 

Regards,

Orion"
ucla,fp191wv,t3_gaqf30,1588227936.0,"The only way to get a truly representative sample of a population is random sampling (ask a statistician). And presumably we all want a representative government. Enter: Sortition.

Sortition is like jury duty, only for legislatures as well. Imagine if your Congress members were ordinary people like you and me instead of career politicians:

[https://www.ted.com/talks/brett\_hennig\_what\_if\_we\_replaced\_politicians\_with\_randomly\_selected\_people?utm\_campaign=tedspread&utm\_medium=referral&utm\_source=tedcomshare](https://www.ted.com/talks/brett_hennig_what_if_we_replaced_politicians_with_randomly_selected_people?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare)

Would it work in practice? It worked in Ancient Greece (britannica.com/topic/sortition). But how would it work here?

For starters, we could add a sortition based senate to USAC. While USAC could be the one generating proposals, the sortition senate could be in charge of choosing the proposals. As long as the senate is large enough (by the Central Limit Theorem, at least 30 people) and randomly selected, it would be as though all of UCLA’s undergraduates came together to voice their opinions. It’s the same way that a random spoonful from a well-mixed pot of soup tells us how the entire soup is, no matter how big the pot is; the way USAC is currently selected is closer to not mixing the pot at all and taking spoonfuls from the same spot over and over again, and then being surprised we get the same result every time.

It’s also worth noting that separating the planning from the decision making prevents decision makers from being biased towards their own (pet) project. As part of a more general separation of powers, this could be a very healthy move for our student government. Finally, and most importantly, doing away with elections can counterintuitively make the process more democratic: for example, when Congress members don’t have to spend lots of money to win elections, they don’t have to please corporate lobbyists in order to stay Congress members. Instead they can focus on what ordinary citizens want, which as ordinary citizens they should be familiar with. In that way the process is more about the citizens and less about money, more democratic and less plutocratic. A similar logic applies to our student representatives, who we want to be in touch with ordinary students; and what better way to do that than make them ordinary students?

But why would a random student agree to do this work? For one, they would get paid; we’re already doing something like this by paying our USAC councillors a $10,000 yearly stipend. And two, the time commitment would be a lot lower than being a USAC councillor: they wouldn’t have to campaign in an election or draw up proposals, just be randomly selected and read proposals - it’s like how you or I can know good from bad food when we taste it even if we’re not good cooks. If that’s still too much work for a sortition member, we can accept their decision and randomly choose someone else (though at the cost of non-response bias making the selection not perfectly random).

Would this random selection be ideal? No. But to quote Winston Churchill, “Democracy is the worst form of government except all others that have been tried.” Sortition is a better form of democracy, closer to the ideal of a government “Of the people, by the people, and for the people.” We owe it to ourselves to give it a shot.

Can it actually happen? Yes. It would take a referendum, but if that referendum gets on the ballot next year the choice is yours.

Will it happen? That depends on you. An idea is just an idea; to amount to anything people must act on it. Do you want to act on it? Or do you have second thoughts? Let me know in the comments.

Thanks for sharing, it is a good find, and a nice depiction of the budget breakdown.

We have to make a distinction though between the overall budget, and the actual expenditures. For example t-shirts could be purchased with money from a category (general ledger) for t-shirts, or from a general expenses category. Which is why ""$0"" were spent on t-shirts last fiscal year.

I understand where you are coming from there.

That's a familiar problem to epistemology. With so much complexity, how do we really know anything about anything.

ucla,fo4nn86,t1_fo2pi12,1587507719.0,"Hi u/FilmicIllusion,

Thank you for expressing your concerns.

1. Sorry, I can't do anything regarding that one. It's up to you (collectively) to decide what happens this election. It's also no secret I abstained (while publicly stating that I would have voted no) at the April 14 council meeting. Let me elaborate on that.
   1. Why I abstained:
      1. “Officers or appointed members must avoid even the perception of a conflict” - Bylaws Section D Subsection 1
      2. All candidates success in this election may be statistically correlated with the referenda.
      3. Checking for perception of conflict of interest, I asked Dr. Geller (sort of like an admin advisor) near the beginning of the meeting, and she said that ""... and in general, its best practice, for those who are themselves a candidate, to abstain in all votes regarding elections matters. Umm, I'll leave it to you to determine ... if you have a conflict of interest"" ( [https://youtu.be/Jeq7NQzzA9o?t=3412](https://youtu.be/Jeq7NQzzA9o?t=3412) )
   2. Why I said I would have voted no:
      1. Many students are suffering right now, and their voices should be heard. Council tries to vote unanimous on everything, but that's not a true representation of the student body. While this money can definitely be used to do good things, I did't believe it would be representative for council to send a unanimous declaration to students, because that would violate the trust of students who are expecting to be represented.
      2. Any decision like this must be through an informed vote of the student body. I felt that not enough info was out there at the time. I'm trying to address that part, regardless on how you end up voting. I'm against uninformed votes, I'm not against pro-referendum votes.
2. 25% to financial aid is a UCOP (University of California Office of the President) policy. ""any compulsory campus-based student fee ... shall provide for fee revenue for local need-based financial aid (""return-to-aid"") to be set aside in an amount equal to at least 25% of the total new fee or fee increase as appropriate"" ( [https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710528/PACAOS-80](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710528/PACAOS-80) ) USAC cannot change this.
3. This one is about trust. If you vote yes on the CUB referendum,  it means that you trust ASUCLA (more on this later). And again this is not going to build a new building. If a new building is built, this would only fund the interior. The thing that happens more quickly is building out of the new Black Resource center, and even faster, the payment of transfer student center rent.

I hope that was somewhat helpful,

Orion

TLDR; It is what it is. You (collectively) decide what happens."
ucla,fo4emc6,t1_fo2z762,1587503029.0,"Hi, u/LBCLaCroix  


Thank you for your question.   
I realize there is a lot of potential misinformation and misunderstandings out there. That is why I went to an official source (Roy) for that information. 

As far as I can tell, the probabilities are just high that it will happen. Empty land at UCLA doesn't stay empty for long. UCLA is good at getting donors (and easier with the Olympics coming). And, I may be mistaken, but I think there was a study done on the possibility of a 6 story building.

That being said. There are no guarantees that I am aware of at this time. Others may know more information that points towards the chances being very high, but I cannot comment on that.

I hope this clears some things up.
