Your family would be devasted and heartbroken for a lot longer than ""a bit"" and they'd miss you forever. Looking at your post history, all I know is that you've been dealt a really tough hand. I hope you continue to fight and stay with us. I don't know you but I would still care if you're gone. Your friends will care. Your family will care. Your loved ones will care. It sounds obvious enough but sometimes I have to remind myself that our loved ones love us back. Despite what you think, I can garuantee you're making your loved ones' lives better simply by living in it. You don't have to do anything else - that's more than enough for them. Sorry for snooping but I agree - Ned Flanders is quite the hunk ðŸ”¥."

SanFranciscoAnalog,f8xsep9,t3_e2rtzm,1574931839.0,I don't want this to discourage people from posting! Mostly I get curious looking at these photos and wonder if they're recent or old. I think it adds to a layer of perspective knowing the general / rough ballpark of when a photo was taken.
