There are people who get into med school with undergrad degrees in philosophy. Definitely not doubting your ability to perform and deliver results. There are many factors to take into consideration when reviewing applicants trying to get into med school. Do your research. Know what you want to do, and do what's necessary to get you to your desired destination having been able to perform competitively in whatever factors are being considered. (Interview skill, MCAT scores, GPA, industry connections, etc)"
