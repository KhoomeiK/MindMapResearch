One of my professors told me that if your goal is a good GPA, you're doing college wrong.  Not that you _shouldn't_ aim for a good GPA, but don't let the tail wag the dog.  Take classes that will challenge you and teach you things that you want to learn, study and do your work, and you'll do well.  He also said he had former students with great GPAs but who were only good at school, and had trouble using their degree, and had students whose grades weren't high but who learned well and were very successful afterward. 

UCI has a good chemistry program.  If you're going to work hard and try your best, you'll do well here, no matter what your transcript ends up saying."
