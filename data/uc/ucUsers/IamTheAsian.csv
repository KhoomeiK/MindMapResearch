Fitness,fpj7kek,t1_fpj6pme,1588658956.0,You are assuming that the human body is as efficient at walking than running. Walking a 3.5 mph is the most efficient speed per mile for a human. [Source](https://exrx.net/Aerobic/WalkCalExp). So obviously when you run you are expending more calories per mile ran.
