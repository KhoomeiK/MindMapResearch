ucla,fp76bwq,t3_gbnybp,1588364853.0,I can't believe that you woke up this morning and thought it would be a good idea to post something so stupid.

Fuck USAC"
ucla,fo3mu38,t3_g5ihjv,1587489536.0,I hope /u/Orion4USAC is reading.

Wow, what a joke."
ucla,fnkby88,t1_fnkbnn1,1587021463.0,They've had AMAs on here before. A couple of times I think. I don't think this time it'll go as well lmao
ucla,fmyypx9,t1_fmxi57x,1586500060.0,"> The 2,000,000 that is ""unaccounted for"" is not a result of USAC mishandling, but CPO departmental mishandling of funds- refusing to give the money to student-run committees that were designed to focus on access and retention. If you read the article you cited, you'd see that USAC has been working all year to advocate for transparency. Once the money is allocated, USAC loses much of its financial responsibility over the money. Finally, this money is earmarked by the past student bodies who voted for it, it can't just be moved around to another spot.

Sounds like perfect evidence as to why we shouldn't give a dime to USAC. They can't even control the funds or the offices below them once its allocated. They can't even summon CPO to a meeting to talk about it. This doesn't convince anyone to give more to USAC. It has the opposite effect. 

> This 9 million dollar budget that exists is largely earmarked for campus departments (such as the CPO, BRC, LGBT Center, CAPS, CARE, etc.) that many students use. This money is not money that USAC can just move around where-ever it deems necessary- it's earmarked by past referenda.

USAC should work on fixing the way money is allocated, instead of upping fees all the time as a solution. Instead of creating more burdens for students, they should work internal policies to fix budget lockboxes.

> Did you read the referenda language? These fees are literally required to fund the creation of a black resource center with a programming budget, pay off the transfer student debt, permanently fund the campus redistribution center, and develop new prayer space for student. Read the language before you call them vague. And, more importantly, don't speak on behalf of what communities do or do not need when many leaders within these same communities are running the referenda themselves.

Did you read the post? Students are struggling more than ever right now and raising the overall cost of attendance is going to affect them negatively. Not to mention the poor timing of all this. You really had to do this NOW? 

> If you paid attention to USAC's weekly announcements, you would know that they are reallocating most of their remaining budget to a COVID-19 relief fund. Relying on surplus to sustainably fund a Black Resource Center doesn't sound like the move.

A refund to students would have been more helpful. I get that the students want their resource center, but asking for fees at a time like this is NOT the move.

> 25% of referenda fees go back to financial aid. Look up the regents policy. It effectively doesn't impact students who are on financial aid because a proportional amount goes back to financial aid. Period.

Oh great, so let's take money from students and give it back to them in the form of financial aid. Sounds like  a redundant and unnecessary step to me. Haw about simply not taking our money in the first place?"
