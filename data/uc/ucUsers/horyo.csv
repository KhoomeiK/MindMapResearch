youngjustice,fpmjo3x,t1_fpmd7jm,1588734546.0,"> This is personal preference, but I would have preferred more varied, well-developed, genuine relationships over the misguided/superficial/off-putting ones we seem to get in season 3.

But we do though. Off the top of my head:

* We have the long-running friendship between Artemis and Zatanna, which we learn expands to including M'gann and Rocket. 

* We get the friendship between Forager and Conner, as well as his friendships to Violet and Brion. 

* We also have the og friendships + Wally. 

* We have the best broship between Jaime and Bart.

* We have Black Lightning's friendship and working relationship with Nightwing, and that comes into being a source of conflict when lies are uncovered. 

The show is about relationships in all forms. It just so happens that romantic relationship drama drives a bit of the dynamic and is more prominent. The natural friendships slide into the background because they're more subtle, genuine, and natural. You have to look for them to see them."

I'm not. I don't think you see my point here, so I recommend you go back and reread it.

> Lol u get triggered easily I love it. Well u where at that chapter u could have kept reading... I went back to that chapter. I said cooking didn’t I? I went back and she’s going GROCERY shopping since dear sasuke kun is coming home tonight. Lol it’s clearly for her to go home and cook with but keep acting obtuse.

Spouse is coming home so character goes grocery shopping --> ""so abnormal."" That's what you're saying. This precedes everything that happened with Jigen. As soon as Ino sensed something was amiss, Sakura told Sarada to bring stuff home. You cannot confirm what she did until we see her next, which was healing Sasuke. I made a more reasonable inference that she went back to the hospital to prepare. I have more ground to stand on here. You're ignoring context to support your point. This is not good argument style. 

>Why would she leave him when she gave birth to his child?! 

Because she can. There's nothing to stop her. Women have autonomy to leave a relationship whether or not a child is involved. Have you heard of single mothers?

>Her whole motive was hanging up on a guy that wasn’t shit... she wouldn’t leave now that she has finally got him, that doesn’t mean she’s happy. She has no choice but to settle. We all know the type of girl sakura is. 

>When the war ended she was waiting there hopefully for him like he was gonna give her an affectionate gesture but in the end didn’t get ish but a forehead tap. 

You mean one of the most significant gestures in Sasuke's life? The same one she and he share with Sarada? The one he received from Itachi? Now I know you're ignoring the material blindly to support your point.

>Even during sarada daddy issue arc she was desperately waiting for a romantic gesture and he paid her dust. During that same chapter sakura herself said she does get lonely but now it’s plenty enough. The girls has settled she can not get anything more and is stuck with her sad life.

See my point above about reading and inferring the nuance of a situation and how characters are portrayed in comedic fashion as according to tropes that are popular in Japan (i.e. Tsundere). 

You can go on and on if you'd like; we're going in circles now. I presented my case pretty clearly with substantiation and I stand by my points."

> In the manga where naruto and sauske are fighting for there life. Sarada and sakura both heard what was going on. Smart sarada went to investigate while sakura went gushing up on hubby come home and went home to go cook.....

I love how you made up this detail to fit your ""narrative."" I went back to read chapters 35-37. Nowhere does it show Sakura ""went home to cook."" She remained with Ino and she probably headed back to the hospital, because, y'know, that's her role during an emergency inside the village. Sarada was the one who said she was going home to put away the flowers. The only time that Sakura ""gushed"" was before Ino sensed any perturbation in the chakra network. You know who else gushed? Sarada. And who was it that healed Sasuke when he escaped Jigen? Sakura, because she was, y'know, where she was supposed to be: the hospital. So nice going.

>Also is there REALLY a mutual understanding? Sakura has no choice but to ACCEPT it.

She does have a choice. She can leave him. There's nothing stopping her other than she enjoys being in this relationship. 

>We see in the beginning sakura was struggling to pay bills.

Struggling? Not finished paying a mortgage =/= struggling to pay bills. Mortgages take time. Sakura directs the Medical Center in Konoha. She isn't struggling for cash. Besides, she obliterated that house which is unneeded expenses. Anyone would feel frustrated. 

>Sarada herself told sasuke to come home more often. When he comes home (which is rarely) sakura passed out... mutual my back

She's a doctor. She works most of the day. He comes home at variable times. Of course she'd be asleep. Does she react to him negatively? No. When we see her awake with him, it's always bliss for her. And yes, Sarada told him to come home more often. That's a normal thing for a child to say to a parent who works away. 

> With every little « proof of good relationship » I have 5 for how bad they are.

I've given you multiple rebuttals. It's up to you to receive them or not. I recommend you try to get some insight about this relationship (and others) before casting it off as one thing or another because it doesn't fit your schema of what a ""healthy"" relationship is."
Boruto,fop4otp,t1_fop4b7u,1587953013.0,"> As I said he’s barely home. 

And? Sakura is content with this as she's expressed. He's similar to any other parental figure who works away jobs. They have a mutual understanding and they're both at the very least satisfied with the relationship. Are you trying to say people who work intense jobs do not have good relationships? A lot of doctors/lawyers/military personnel would disagree. 

>When he’s home he’s with naruto or boruto. 

Because it's a show about Boruto and Sasuke is his mentor. We obviously don't see the offscreen time he spends with Sarada, teaching her the grand fireball technique or helping her train.

>He’s with sakura out of pity... good couple my behind

Pity doesn't necessitate confiding in her about his bond with Itachi and how significant that was to him. Pity doesn't mean he apologizes to her for being a burden. 

I'm not the one grasping at straws. I never said it was the best relationship, but it suits both people who are in it. I don't think you should project your desires/insecurities/idealizations onto a relationship. There are a variety of different ones/arrangements out in our world too."
