berkeley,fp75ko0,t3_gbokbo,1588364458.0,"Ok while I understand cheating is bad, I read somewhere that he caught like 100 students answering that problem he gave. If 100 of your students are cheating there’s more than likely something not working in your classroom. Additionally, we’re in the middle of a once in a lifetime global pandemic, there are a lot of legitimate factors that might drive a student to look up the answer to a problem that is confusing or worded strangely. Cheating is never ok. But given the circumstances I feel like this professor coulda gone about addressing that issue in less of a “haha gotcha” kinda way, seems apathetic to a lot of the issues people might be dealing with right now."
ApplyingToCollege,fp3rfrx,t3_gb57pu,1588284444.0,"I transferred from CC to Berkeley. If I could go back in time and make my decision I’d choose to go to CC again. Number one it let me go to Berkeley, something I never could have done out of Highschool, number 2 it saved me literally thousands of dollars. The first two years of college are in my opinion a bit of a scam. You’re taking classes you’ve already taken in highschool for the price of tuition, which is usually tens of thousands of dollars. At CC those GE courses are not only ~incredibly~ cheaper but they’re easier. 

Yeah missing out on the first two years of University is a little disappointing, however all the UCs have significant transfer communities that will allow you to easily make friends and connect with people who have similar college experiences as you when you transfer. 

While I am not entirely sure about the medical school issue I do not believe that having a CC on your transcript would hurt you. I think if you do well at both schools and round out your application with test scores and extracurriculars and internships I’m sure you will have just as good of a chance at getting in as anyone else. And who knows, by the time you finish college you may be interested in a completely different vocation at that point."

nfl,foi0cfr,t3_g7kfbl,1587776145.0,In coming “but they already have an RB” comments
berkeley,fohydeq,t3_g7ghw3,1587775049.0,Dude I fucked up so badly in highschool I never thought I would end up here. The transfer route is a fucking awesome option and I wouldn’t have given it up for anything. You got this.
49ers,foet7hn,t1_foes05h,1587713931.0,I’m thinking a 3rd for Brieda...Goodwin we’d be extremely lucky to get a 5th for...more reasonably a 6th or 7th. Pettis I don’t think we will trade as much as this sub would like to.
49ers,foe2eys,t1_foe2a3e,1587694698.0,Facts. I put my comment in the wrong thread which is why I’m getting some downvotes but literally everybody on twitter crying Bc we didn’t get WR. As well as a lot of people here in other threads.
49ers,foe1ig2,t1_foe1dgb,1587694199.0,Bruh lots of people complaining in every thread as well as twitter and instagram. Sorry if I came off too strong. People just piss me off.
49ers,foe10rv,t3_g6ztvi,1587693928.0,Our D line was what made us such a defensive force last year. The only reason our DBs didn’t get fuckin toasted like they did in 2018 was because of the pressure the D line brought. Stop complaining.
49ers,fodzzxv,t3_g6zpty,1587693363.0,We basically just traded in our 7th for a 4th. Def worth it
