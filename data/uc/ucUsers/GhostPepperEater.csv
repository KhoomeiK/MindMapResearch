Most large precincts are in large cities which are most often not GOP strongholds even when they are located in red states. Take New Orleans for example. Laws passed there DESPITE GOP fighting them tooth and nail. In fact, the GOP there wants to go back to stop and frisk. The Magas on reddit in that area call for it constantly and are pretty blatantly racist about it. Any support for the cameras is usually accompanied by phrases like ,""in high crime areas""...and we all know what that means.

Also, in areas like the deep south those cameras have a way of turning themselves off right before someone catches a beating."
