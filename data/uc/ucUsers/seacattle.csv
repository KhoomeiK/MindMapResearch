bayarea,fpeqp9m,t1_fpdnwlk,1588552908.0,I think they are going to get shut down.
Dentistry,fpe28tr,t3_gcvzee,1588538910.0,"You might be able to do a root canal and a crown, depending on how much of your tooth is left and what it looks like in an x-ray. Or maybe there are other option. Only way to find out is by going to a dentist to have it checked out."
GettyMuseumChallenge,fpe1vur,t3_gcsrsy,1588538706.0,Adorable!
GettyMuseumChallenge,fpe1r6a,t1_fpc5n3v,1588538632.0,On second look...is that Garfield?
GettyMuseumChallenge,fpc5n3v,t3_gcc43q,1588488408.0,Garfield made me literally LOL!
pelotoncycle,fpbpduc,t1_fpbnu5q,1588475413.0,"I think the badges show up on the browser, but not the programs...unless I just haven't figured out how to find them on the browser. If you have a link, please post it!"
pelotoncycle,fpbo6kg,t1_fp9ghmm,1588474584.0,"Yeah, now that I've been using the app longer, the badges are getting fewer and far between. But I hope they end up looking cooler or different as you progress... the 30 day streak one was silver instead of blue... so exciting!"
pelotoncycle,fpbmptf,t1_fpaevpr,1588473597.0,"Same! The music is so fun and the little cues on posture and pace are so helpful! I was really beating the shit out of my legs and feet the last time I tried to run (a few years ago, with Couch to 5k). I feel so much better now that I'm focusing on lightness and proper form with foot strikes etc."
pelotoncycle,fpbmlzl,t1_fp9i6zq,1588473525.0,Thank you!üí™üèª
pelotoncycle,fpbmiwj,t1_fpaclng,1588473467.0,That green and black tulip badge is so pretty! I hope they have more silly quick challenges like that!
pelotoncycle,fpbmgkj,t1_fpa5omp,1588473424.0,Yes do it! I still can't do all the moves perfectly but just trying makes us stronger!!
pelotoncycle,fpbmey5,t1_fp9vfnq,1588473395.0,I still haven't done a spin class on the Peloton app (don't have access to a stationary bike) but I'm pretty sure it would make me exhausted also! I see my friends who have the bike having crazy calorie outputs on their rides that I would be lucky to achieve on a run!
pelotoncycle,fpbmakh,t1_fp9u9pz,1588473316.0,Aw that's a bummer! I hope someone who uses the Android app responds to you. I've heard it's not as fleshed out as the Apple app.
pelotoncycle,fpbm7r3,t1_fpankmf,1588473261.0,You were just taking rest days! Those are important!! ;)
pelotoncycle,fpbm20t,t1_fp9e1mh,1588473154.0,"Agreed, I would love a badge for Crush Your Core too! And badges for going through it a 2nd time, and a 3rd..."
pelotoncycle,fpblz7g,t1_fp9trnk,1588473102.0,I need to try the meditation still! One of my friends is super into it!
pelotoncycle,fpblv7x,t1_fp97j98,1588473027.0,"Yes! I recognize your username from looking at a thread about alternative bikes that could be used with the app...I'm tempted to get an alternative bike, since I don't think I'll have a spare 2-3k sitting in my account any time soon!"
pelotoncycle,fpblpki,t1_fp8zej3,1588472923.0,Yeah do it! I am almost able to get through the 30 seconds of bicycle crunching at the end without crying :)
pelotoncycle,fpblnv2,t1_fp8vqvf,1588472890.0,Thank you!!
berkeley,fp8kyl3,t1_fp7hrz8,1588395076.0,Interesting! Link?
pelotoncycle,fozrchx,t1_fooq5i0,1588195519.0,"agreed, that would be awesome!"
GettyMuseumChallenge,fnu38hl,t1_fnqjbu4,1587253676.0,Lol yep
Dentistry,fnu0h9x,t3_g3u3nh,1587252142.0,You should ask the people who graduated from your program in 2019 :) I have heard 200-500k but that is just a few data points
oakland,fmrhb9u,t3_fwskhr,1586323191.0,My friend applied Friday and heard today! Crazy fast.
Dentistry,fmq9dj3,t1_fmq7nkq,1586295336.0,"It‚Äôs possible they might put a temporary filling just to close the hole off, without doing any drilling or numbing. You would have to get it replaced in the future."
Unemployment,fmq1885,t3_fuck9h,1586291028.0,"You can start now. UI considers the day you EARNED the pay as your last day, not the day you actually got paid."

bayarea,fmkjiwd,t3_fvp5bz,1586157114.0,"Try Petfinder, a lot of small local rescues still have dogs available in foster homes. I believe many are only letting people meet pets over video chat before they adopt, just fyi."
