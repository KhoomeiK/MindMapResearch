SwiftUI,fp3fkwr,t3_elaklx,1588278440.0,"You can fix this by using UIImage to define SymbolConfiguration, then wrap it as an Image. 

&#x200B;

var config = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(pointSize: 25, weight: .black, scale: .small)

var bookmark = UIImage(systemName: ""bookmark"", withConfiguration: config)

Then in your View, use it like Image(uiImage: bookmark!)"

berkeley,fp2u6tx,t3_g8an1k,1588267951.0,"I have a cogsci degree and Iâ€™m doing a CS masters, I didnâ€™t know how infuriating point A could be until it started happening to me ALL THE TIME. Oh my god, some men donâ€™t understand that I actually know things and that I donâ€™t need every little detail explained to me?? Also the whole deferring to other men for answers bothers the hell out of me. The worst part is this happens with close guy friends as well, so its even the men who should know/trust me the most. Iâ€™m starting to call out guys though who I feel would be receptive to that kind of criticism, itâ€™s exhausting but Iâ€™m not about to allow people to question what I know so blatantly and disrespectfully!"
