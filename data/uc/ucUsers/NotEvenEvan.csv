UCDavis,fphpuc7,t1_fpgt6iz,1588625609.0,You should’ve gotten an email saying your reward information for the 2019-2020 year has changed. Check your MyAwards and MyBill accounts to verify.

modernwarfare,fpey0kg,t3_gd2pgz,1588557393.0,You’re an absolute idiot. This has nothing to do with internet speeds nor computer specs. Do us all a favor and stop talking out of your ass.

buildapcsales,fp859ep,t1_fp7zi3n,1588383860.0,Shows OOS on Amazon for me. Only option is to buy from third-party.
LoveLive,fp55jps,t3_gbdhyq,1588317021.0,"[Source!](https://twitter.com/kou7303/status/1256056230914580482?s=21)

Came across this super cute art on Twitter and just had to share it. I love the little details and it’s not everyday you get to see our girls drink."

nintendo,fol5kw8,t3_g7vuf0,1587855324.0,"It would be nice to be able to physically attend my college classes again. Never thought I’d say this, but I’m sick of staying at home all day. Online classes are hard to get through due to my lack of motivation and so I’m struggling in my classes."
Animewallpaper,foj24nk,t3_g7q30e,1587805346.0,Why’d you put Love Live in the title twice lol

patientgamers,fo9mlmx,t3_g6fhu4,1587624033.0,"This was the main reason I ultimately had to stop playing NV and just skip to 4. The game crashed every 10-15 minutes of gameplay with only a few QoL mods, it was unbearable.

Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 crashed maybe twice each during my ~100 hour playthroughs. NV just refuses to work on my PC."
UCDavis,fo4li0t,t3_g5kbnc,1587506584.0,FYI Chegg Discord servers exist. You donate a dollar and get access to a bot that gives you all the answers on Chegg.

anime,fnrahts,t1_fnqv2nl,1587183400.0,I feel you dude. Seeing them live once before their inevitable disbandment is all I want.
LivestreamFail,fnpl11l,t1_fnpiirs,1587147360.0,Not to mention the amount of sexualized children in the game. Kiiiiinda weird.
LivestreamFail,fnph51i,t1_fnoqzgr,1587145415.0,Really? I type BabyRage all the time in his chat and I’ve yet to be banned lol
buildapc,fmudv51,t1_fmubxxu,1586389466.0,"To add onto OP, the 5600 XT is very slightly faster than the standard RTX 2060. They pretty much butt heads evenly, which is amazing considering the 5600 XT is quite a bit cheaper."
misfits,fmrq0cr,t1_fmrjhsz,1586331277.0,"Check their Twitter, they usually make a post every time a new episode comes out. Today was the first time they didn’t.

Also you can’t disable Twitter comments :)"
worldnews,fmm63t0,t1_fmm3qcj,1586199474.0,Mods don’t have friends.
patientgamers,fmgyipf,t3_fv7vhu,1586061332.0,"I’m in the same boat as you, I’m the complete opposite of a patient gamer. Resident Evil 3 Remake came out yesterday and I’m already finished with the game.

This sub is the only place where meaningful discussion about games happens. r/gaming is a sob story-filled, karma farm with unfunny memes and sweaty nerds. This sub has none of that, probably because people here are limited to text-only posts."
