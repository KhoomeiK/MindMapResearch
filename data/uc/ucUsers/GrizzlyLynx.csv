ucr,fn1fhbc,t1_fn1f4a0,1586560920.0,"not a dumb question, you can pick your roommate through the housing portal once you submit your application for housing. Getting a room together shouldn't be difficult but the longer you wait the worse room selection you'll be able to pick from. for instance, a middle floor, or a room next to hall entrance door or study lounge"
ucr,fn1ez1p,t3_fyqy0f,1586560618.0,"you're looking for Lothian. AI is a party hall with a worse dining hall, Pentland is lonely af and no food.

Lothian has two sides, East (c, d, e, f) and west ( a, b). westlo is more rundown with worse bathrooms and laundry rooms, but the conditions can bond you to your hall mates. Eastlo is newer and nicer, but depending on your hall mates can turn bad quickly. You should be careful with your roommate too, as that can be a major factor in your living experience. 

I lived in westlo with a great hall and an okay roommate, and my first year was pretty cool. just try not to overthink it because college is a lot more than your living Arrangements. hope this helps and welcome to ucr. 

P. S. not everybody here is an asshole, try and meet some commuter students, they need friends."
