The messed up part? All my friends are graduating that year and I’ll only have 2 quarters to be with them and I am really worried about not having any quarters with them (if for some reason I can’t find housing, have to take Winter and Spring online, airports remain under lockdown etc)."

Do you think this will be the case for the entire school year? or just fall? Can they even force students to get back during, say, spring quarter?
