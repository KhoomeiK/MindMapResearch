Too many that want to sell drugs to make a quick buck instead of go to school. Because school is hard work and takes a long time. Selling drugs and getting paid is easy.

Cool, jews have been the most successful group everywhere in the world. The moroccan jews, middle eastern jews, european, and american. Their success is location-agnostic.

> Judaism has a very strong tradition of education, so Jewish communities tended to have higher literacy rates.

Blacks do not have a tradition of education. This problem would be reversed rapidly if they embraced education. But they don't and I haven't seen any indication that they are as a community. So another generation falls through the cracks...

> Poor Jews still exist. Jews aren't a monolithic group.

And rich blacks exist. We are talking about generalizations.
