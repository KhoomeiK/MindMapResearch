NoStupidQuestions,fp9ih9e,t3_gbn64d,1588427050.0,I was playing a game once and marveling at the amazing sound quality before realizing I had my window open and was hearing actual birds.
ucla,fp62nfq,t1_fp5vbir,1588344913.0,A lot of classes also have midterms this week. They may just have a ton of extra emails from their students right now.
ucla,fp54e70,t3_gb91hf,1588315934.0,"Taking classes. The two I was planning were cancelled, but I’ll figure something else out. 

Normally I’d also be working, but I’m nonessential."
ucla,fp0atp5,t3_gafamc,1588205715.0,"Im also really sad that I’m having part of my already short two years online. I’m not even an a very social person, but I really miss in person classes, drinking coffee I did not make, and just being on campus. I also feel like I’m 1000x more awkward on screen which makes me never want to talk in class."
ucla,fozk1i9,t3_gaf4qr,1588191962.0,"I’m in Norwegian and I love it. It’s close to English in some ways, so if you aren’t great at learning a foreign language it’s not so bad."
mtgfinance,fos17ij,t1_forzvkp,1588022117.0,"I would hope they’d leave a notice, but you can probably call and see if any mail for you is being held there."
mtgfinance,forw1p7,t3_g983gx,1588019507.0,"I received mine a few days ago. No tracking or shipping notice. It just kind of showed up. I did have to sign for it (well, the delivery person signed for it while I confirmed my identity so that I wouldn’t have to touch it)"
ucla,fonhkax,t1_fom7ag9,1587919627.0,"I don’t know any dedicated pages for that. But I’ve seen people looking on the transfer FB page: https://m.facebook.com/groups/79723067693?ref=bookmarks

Or there is the UCLA housing page which might help: https://m.facebook.com/groups/1414484008814397/?ref=group_browse"
ucla,fom3670,t1_folhlz1,1587877041.0,I’m pretty sure commuter is just from your parent’s/family’s home that is specifically not your spouse. I live with my husband and have to select off-campus. Though there should be a little link to click for an explanation next to each option.
nintendo,fol9tpk,t3_g7vuf0,1587857744.0,I just want to be able to go on campus for class instead of learning online. I miss sitting under the giant trees and studying on campus.
ucla,fojtv3g,t1_foiurn8,1587829277.0,"Yeah, campus is still open, there are even people still living in the dorms. Just take the same precautions you would anywhere else, 6 ft apart etc."
ucla,fnp62al,t3_g34rzv,1587139849.0,"No harm in asking the professor if you can sit in on the class. We had someone from Berkley zoom in to watch my foreign language class. We only had 3 people in the class, so it’s not like she couldn’t handle the extra person."
AskReddit,fnjb3w1,t3_g1u0ex,1586995433.0,"I worked in a restaurant that usually had a large after church crowd every Sunday. We didn’t take reservations, but if you had a large group and called ahead, we tried to accommodate you. Other than that we had a waitlist you could join when you arrived.

One Sunday we were super short handed. I was waiting tables and because I had the closest section to the hostess station, I was also taking down names for the waitlist and seating people when it was their turn.

This man came in with 4 or so other people, including small children (clearly from church based on how they were dressed) and I took his name down for the list. Right after them a group of 2 came in. We had some (very very) small booths that could accommodate groups of two. They were not super popular, but some people would opt for them if we were really busy.

So I try to take this couple to one of the small booths. This man jumps up from where he was waiting to scream at me about skipping him. He goes on and on about the bad service and how incompetent we all were. He’s was going to have that table and I was “a stupid c**t” for taking another table before his. There were at least 5 other groups of 4+ waiting before him, but I guess he thought he should be next.

It was the first and only time I’ve been called that to my face."
ucla,fniq6z9,t1_fnibhdy,1586984418.0,"Honestly, it doesn’t feel like they don’t realize it. It’s just an easier position to take to call people racist than it is to defend a fee increase when people are struggling to buy minimal supplies for survival."
ucla,fna2095,t1_fn97w3v,1586789482.0,"Oh yeah, if they are zero stress no point in changing them. I hope it starts to make sense. It sucks when you spend so much time on something and it just doesn’t click."
ucla,fn97kko,t1_fn96t9o,1586762224.0,Is this your most important class? Could you switch something less essential to p/np to take some of the stress off yourself and devote more time to this class?
ucla,fmo16x5,t3_fw6h5d,1586241687.0,"Scandinavian C180 - Literature and Scandinavian Society

M/W/F 10:00-10:50. You’d have to make future lectures, but the first week’s worth are up on the class website. She’s leaving them up for like 2 weeks for people to catch up as they get everything sorted out. Future lectures will be up less time. Pretty sure there are seats left in the class."
ApplyingToCollege,fmglq75,t1_fmfvfbe,1586051817.0,"I know they take a lot more transfers from CA community colleges, but I do know some people that transferred in from out of state. As for residency for tuition, I have no idea. 

As for friends, I have made some in my classes, but I transferred into the same major with people I had several classes with at CC. So I came in with friends. I live off campus, so I’m less social than I could be."
