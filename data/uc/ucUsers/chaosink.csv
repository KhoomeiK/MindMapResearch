Never used it on enamel though. Test a small spot first."

USMC,fnqmpql,t1_fnod27t,1587167722.0,Heard something like that at 8th and I when I was kid. Brings a tear to my eye every time I think of it.

They took a plain pleated mask and shot a huge viral load (. 3 micron) at it and it filtered 50% of the nasty guys. Better than nothing, but still keep your distance!"

It even stood up to gale force winds and 2.5ft of snow. Granted I had put everything I had in there to keep it from flying away, but I got through it with only a couple of cracked poles!"
CovIdiots,fmuex7l,t3_fv8ts2,1586390061.0,"As a Liverpool fan, I'm happy to report that they reversed this decision quickly after the world took the piss out of them. The club is actually owned by the Fenway Sports Group (Red Sox) and I suspect the ownership didn't realize the backlash that would engender in the UK, especially a blue collar town like Liverpool."
