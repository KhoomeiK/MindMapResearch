CPA,fp7sces,t1_fp7lpb2,1588376783.0,Got it! Hopefully it‚Äôs our last one we can finally update our flair to 4/4 !!!!!!
CPA,fp7sb6o,t1_fp7ix90,1588376762.0,"Cool, I am gonna sign up then! Good luck on your exam and hopefully we can actually take it haha"
lawschooladmissions,fp4yhkq,t1_fp4umpu,1588310806.0,"Thanks for the reply! I REALLY hope so... I am concerned that the GRE isn't as ""traditional"" but it's still worth the shot I guess. The only reason why I would do Law School is if I can get into UCLA full-ride or maybe USC. I just love SoCal and I don't see myself living anywhere else haha"
lawschooladmissions,fp3765r,t1_foyrb88,1588274272.0,"Sorry I am a noob here. What is a viable site to check for the median GPA for the schools, specifically the T14?"
gradadmissions,fp0fh2h,t1_fozcmxl,1588208242.0,Thank you so much for your help! What are some industry-oriented Econ MS/MA programs that I can look into? I am having difficulty where to even start.
gradadmissions,foz0w80,t1_foxxvs7,1588182761.0,"Thanks for your input. I should have specified that I am more interested in an industry-oriented program that‚Äôs short and can lead to a career in finance or banking. 

However, going strictly into Econ MS/MA also sound super interesting too. What are the career prospects with just a Econ MA/MS instead of going all the way to a PhD? I understand that the CPA holds no value in the admissions process but will a Econ MA/MS background with a CPA be more marketable in the job field?"
gradadmissions,foz03zp,t1_foxwxw6,1588182359.0,"Thanks for your input! I guess I am looking mainly at a professional degree like an MBA but I am not completely closed off on research/academia.

For example, I was looking at Columbia business school and they offer a masters program called masters of science in accounting & fundamental analysis. It‚Äôs only one year and they say that ‚Äúit‚Äôs intended for students who prefer a shorter and more industry-oriented experience than the school‚Äôs doctoral program‚Äù. This program/curriculum interests me because it‚Äôs short and can lead to a field like investment bank, financial management, consulting etc. and adds a nice blend to the CPA license. 

It does sound like I am more interested in a professional degree but I am also open to more academia which I understand is different."
CPA,fom1j3c,t3_g85ql4,1587875784.0,congrats!
UCSantaBarbara,fom1gdk,t1_foldupo,1587875729.0,Yeah I knew it! She‚Äôs awesome. I didn‚Äôt take her class personally but she was a guest speaker for one of the classes and she was an amazing person.
UCSantaBarbara,fol2wv5,t1_foi0cty,1587853826.0,Who‚Äôs the professor??
CPA,fohc4fn,t3_g7grpr,1587763487.0,So they don‚Äôt know which centers will actually open on 5/1 yet... looks like I am not booking anything until I know exactly which centers are open lol
CPA,foh5zr5,t3_g7c536,1587760919.0,"I took 3 of my exams in Guam when I was staying in South Korea. (The flight is roughly 4 hrs). Had to book all the flights, hotel, and rental car. It was wild but I was able to pass all 3 on the first try :)"
CPA,fodsun2,t3_g6vrln,1587689486.0,Peter Olinto is literally THE man
CPA,fodss68,t1_fodop4e,1587689450.0,"Apparently back in the day, it was FARE instead of FAR, thus why Gearty keeps saying ‚ÄúFARE‚Äù. Still annoying though since it‚Äôs called FAR now"
CPA,focy3qn,t3_g6q0kb,1587677407.0,Same question here!
UCSantaBarbara,fo8rqlc,t3_g66vyf,1587602477.0,"If you are looking to study for the CPA, this is a great way to practice haha. I know it sucks right now but most of the CPA exam prep courses are through online lectures and textbook reading. Hang in there bud"
CPA,fo7ydse,t1_fo73r6o,1587586672.0,"Wow good for you!- striving for the best I see. I asked because I only have REG left and I am thinking about taking the CMA exam right after passing the CPA exam (even though I am already burned out from the CPA exam haha).

I actually recently graduated from college and will be starting full time in the Fall so I have plenty of time to study for the CMA right after the CPA exam. Would you mind If I PM you with some questions?"
CPA,fo5vufz,t1_fo5nw3c,1587537363.0,Sorry random question but why CMA instead of CPA?

UCSantaBarbara,fmcpp14,t1_fmcnu0d,1585950343.0,I hit a 3.91 and graduated in 2019 with Econ & Acct. It‚Äôs only doable if you put school as your life and obsess over every point. Was it worth it? Hell no LOL I should have enjoyed college more instead of staying in to study every weekend
