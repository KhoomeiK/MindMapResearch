sporetraders,fphhtk1,t3_gdeseq,1588621533.0,Way to sow some mush love thank you.
UCI,fpam5dt,t3_gca3bw,1588451012.0,"Thanks for the shout-out. I'm an adjunct whose contract is about to end, losing my insurance, wage, apartment in a few months and doing everything I can to help my students...reducing work as much as I can, 30 individual meetings a week, feedback like crazy, new video lessons, etc. We aren't all lacking empathy. This situation and system is just really hard."
solotravel,fo6k5av,t3_g5zbw6,1587560807.0,"I thought you were going to say you were over 70 and had bad health. I'm sorry for what you're feeling at the moment, but you can definitely travel at any age. There are many all-age hostels and there is nothing stopping you. To meet more people of all ages you can do Meetup.com and the occasional tour. I am 36 and I have had many solo trips in the last few years and it's all been lovely."
LongDistance,fo368hw,t3_g5brfy,1587481315.0,We are hoping the ban does not apply to spouse or family visas but we won't know until the executive order is signed and released.
BPDrecovery,fne01od,t3_g0uafg,1586880651.0,"Thanks for sharing a story of recovery. Hope is so important. I used to feel like a dog that needed to be put down but I have had my own great improvements from working a 12 step program. I no longer meet the symptoms for BPD, but at one time I clung to stories like yours. I couldn't afford therapy, but thankfully I found the 12 steps. Thanks again for sharing."
UCI,fndiwod,t1_fnbxxr8,1586871039.0,"Naw many of us will be laid off anyway and are doing the best we can to help whoever we can even though we'll lose wages, health insurance, and housing in July. Edit: I've reduced my students' work by 35%, and my own has increased by just as much."
longmire,fn1ojv3,t3_fyr8sb,1586566501.0,ðŸ˜‚ No doubt Walt is on the case. Nighthorse!!!!
stopdrinking,fmow3q9,t3_fwge7b,1586269629.0,I will not drink with you today.
butchlesbians,fmhy2eh,t3_fvdb09,1586097310.0,"Yes you can be seen as a long haired Butch, just like men can have long hair. It's all in your swagger and walk. Muscles help. I don't identify as Butch but am perceived as such in the queer community because of my muscles and walk and mannerisms, and I have long hair. 

But I can relate to people not seeing you as you identify. I've dealt with it my whole life but can tell you that there are plenty of people who will see you if they get to know you a bit."
