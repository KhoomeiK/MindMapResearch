MatebookXPro,fox8ftv,t3_g9x14k,1588136694.0,"In case this comes up in your search,

The model codes of the MateBook X is **WT-W09** for the i5 config, **WT-W19** for i7, and **WT-WX9** for the product line in general.

MateBook X Pro is MACH-W19 for i5 or MACH-W29 for i7, and MACH-WX9 for X Pro in general.

The W09, W19, W29 suffixes all denote config tiers.

For those interested, more info on MateBook naming schemes on this article I wrote in 2018 (spoiler: the model codes are names of scientists):  [https://bradshacks.com/matebook-13-model/](https://bradshacks.com/matebook-13-model/)"

MatebookXPro,fovnnos,t1_fovhawb,1588104383.0,">If you went too low the computer might not start

Incorrect. Because we're setting the voltages using ThrottleStop (or XTU) instead of the BIOS, the undervolt won't kick in until you log in to Windows.

You should thoroughly test the undervolt before you set ""Save voltages immediately"" instead of the default ""Do not save voltages"" in ThrottleStop.

See undervolt section of [this guide](https://bradshacks.com/tweaks-laptop-faster-more-efficient/).  


Edit: If you have accidentally set the undervolt to automatically apply without checking its stability, and find your computer crashing every time after log-in, you can boot into safe mode and delete ThrottleStop.ini (stores ThrottleStop settings). The voltage should reset at next boot or after another power cycle."

This shows that this BSOD is not caused by high temperature.

In fact, BSODs are seldom caused by high temperature alone. Modern computers do not simply ""overheat and die"" because there are throttling mechanisms keeping them below the critical temperature â€” unless you disable those mechanisms."
