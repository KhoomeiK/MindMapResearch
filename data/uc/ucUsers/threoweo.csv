AskReddit,fodi9f7,t3_g6xg2r,1587685021.0,"When I was like 16 I was home alone after school and changing clothes to go to a job interview down the street. Halfway there I realized I didn’t have my phone which I needed for reference numbers and stuff like that, so I had to run back and grab it. When I got to my room again literally 3 or 4 minutes after leaving, my bedroom window fan was across the room and the bathroom mirror next to my room was shattered. I was so freaked out I didn’t even go to the interview and just stood outside to call my mom. 

That apartment was very weird. My room always felt haunted to me, even friends sleeping over would notice despite me not having said anything. Sometimes my cat would literally walk around the door instead of walking past it. The two creepiest things that ever happened was I felt a hand on my head while falling asleep, though I read that could be sleep paralysis. The second was that my mom found underwear in her bed that didn’t belong to anyone in the family (just her and me and my younger sister). Sometimes I even swore food would go missing, but that could have been paranoia haha. It was a strange old apartment so I always wondered if someone had the key and we didn’t know, especially cuz we were all out of the house from like 6am-6pm daily."
