MMA,fokcpqs,t3_g7uxm5,1587839622.0,"Pettis has let me down everytime I've rooted against/for him, recently being:

*He won against Wonderboy 

*He lost to Diaz

I want him to win against Cerrone, so he'll probably lose"
MMA,fok4ylf,t1_foio1q3,1587835499.0,"No, just that he didn't just run through Dillashaw easily. It was a tough fight because of his layoff and injuries. The same can be predicted for Cejudo."
MMA,foidiol,t1_fohf116,1587784146.0,A lot of people forget the win over Dillashaw was a split decision.

StreetMartialArts,fno8qns,t1_fn7jzm9,1587116365.0,This is not 100% power sparring. Looks more like 70% which is typical.
martialarts,fnkswim,t1_fni6hmf,1587039013.0,"The jumping kicks to knock people off horseback I have heard before but it might as well all be myth. I think it's a common Karate tradition to pass down that the belt was white and became dirty over years to become black. I've heard of it multiple times across different dojos in online video

Who are we to say if it's correct or not correct? Sure it's ludicrous but we sure as hell don't know"

UCSantaBarbara,fnc63t7,t1_fnbudw0,1586829417.0,"Nope, you'd fulfill all your OChem series requirements with LD credit transferred and articulated just like any other class/series you take at CC. All credit transferred from CC is LD units. 

You'll still have OChem articulated as complete if you finish it at CC and transfer to UCSB."
UCSantaBarbara,fna8m0z,t1_fn8u486,1586793061.0,Why if I may ask? Did you not enjoy the ChemE workfield?
UCSantaBarbara,fna8hqt,t1_fn97s0i,1586792999.0,"The lectures will count towards UD credits here at UCSB, but the labs are still lower division. Yeah, it doesnâ€™t quite matter where you took it because you need it as part of the curriculum anyway.

But, one year of OChem at CC usually transfers as 109A-B + 6A-BL. One year of OChem at UCSB will require students to take the third quarter of OChem which is 109C, basically an intro to Biochem concepts."
UCSantaBarbara,fn8xltl,t3_g04tzv,1586753030.0,"Biopsych UDs are very interesting and have you engage with the material. There's a focus on neuroscience and biology but you can choose to adjust the UDs you take with as much science v. behavioral studies as you'd like.

I would recommend taking all your LD prerequisites in CC, that way you have more time to take ""med-prep"" classes like Biochemistry & Genetics at UCSB if you desire. If you absolutely have to leave out one series, some people end up finishing either OChem or Physics at UCSB. 

The only benefit in taking OChem at UCSB is that it gives you upper-division units for the lectures as they are UD level, but the lab series is pretty difficult at UCSB."
