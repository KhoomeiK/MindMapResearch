personalfinance,fpmymw4,t1_fpmbb1w,1588745161.0,"I'm not super savvy when it comes to finances, but I would recommend having a nest egg that is 6 months of your combined bills PLUS the max out-of-pocket (and out of network) costs for your health insurance. Mainly, due to the current health pandemic but also just life circumstances in general. If you get sick, you might be taken somewhere out of network and have to pay the total out of pocket costs. If you're really ill or have an accident, you'll likely rack up medical debt and lose income. This nest egg can be put in a high interest savings account if you're worried about losing potential income.

If you've got that already, congrats! Keep some on the side for rainy day funds (different than emergency funds in my mind) and make larger payments. You can make larger payments without doing a huge lump sum payment, right? That would give you flexibility to change your mind if something happens"

Why not any ground wire leading into the dirt below the fence? Do you not have any groundhogs in your area? Will you be adding more raised beds inside the enclosure?

It really depends on the location and the timing, regarding the decline of megafauna. I have not heard anything about it being tied specifically to rise in settlements.

In some parts of the world, megafauna declines happened very suspiciously close to the arrival of anatomically modern humans. Direct evidence of hunting (butcher marks and megafauna bones in human settlements) indicate that humans definitely did hunt megafauna. However, other evidence (chemistry, ancient genetics, distribution data) suggest that many megafauna were already experiencing population declines.

When a population is in duress, even a relatively small additional stress can be all it needs to precipitously decline until the population is no longer genetically viable (not enough genetic variation to clean out bad mutations).

Examples of ‚Äúnatural‚Äù megafauna declines: 
Mastodons (Smaller mammoth relative) in North America experienced population declines when Forrest land turned to grassland due to precipitation patterns changing.

Megafauna in Africa experienced something similar, but earlier. 

Here are some open access links to papers written by some of the leading experts in the vert paleo field.

AskScienceDiscussion,fo6sawp,t1_fo5y8yw,1587565769.0,"I get your point and you're mostly right but there's more to it than that.

Death counts so far have only counted those to be confirmed coronavirus cases (via the covid test). An autopsy just found the first covid deaths in the US to have been in early February but the test wasn't available yet. How many others died between February and wide scale testing? Plus, the death count requires all hospitals/doctors to report deaths as covid, which they might not be for various reasons.

An example:

(Theoretically) If someone dies of an aneurysm or blood clot in the brain while intubated, is that a covid death? Different hospitals might consider it different. This same issue exists during flu season and it's one (of many) reasons why flu death counts have such a large error estimate (like 2018-2019,  46,000-94,000... That's an enormous range!)
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm#table1

You made a point about global deaths in the parent post. I certainly am not confident about the covid death reports out of China, Iran, Sub-Saharan Africa, South America. The reasons to be sceptical: tests are not widely available globally, some governments have chosen to downplay the entire thing and likely are reporting false information (China, Iran, Brazil, etc), many places may have people dying that never make it to a hospital to be counted."

Mint should be planted in its own container where it can't spread. Bees love it and it's good for various uses but it is aggressive and can very quickly take over.

Cat mint can attract neighborhood cats, thus  reducing rodent populations (and birds). Bees also love cat mint. It is also aggressive.

Sage and pretty much all the sage family (salvia) attract bees and hummingbirds. They are a good in the ground plant (maybe along that back paneling?)

I will bet that studies looking at diagnosed flu cases earlier in the year followed by covid cases will be looked at once there's time to collate the data.
