Rollerskating,fpccsch,t3_gcgett,1588495693.0,Omg I wish I knew this before I ordered mine online 😭
lululemon,fpategr,t1_fpat2bb,1588455322.0,"whoa those look great, thanks!"
lululemon,fpar8bf,t1_fpaqtv8,1588454031.0,They’re the original aligns! I don’t have muscular thighs but I carry all of my body fat on my thighs and butt. I guess it’s just my body that doesn’t work with them because size 6 is too tight and 8 constantly falls down/waist is too wide but is perfect in the legs
lululemon,fpaqsdy,t1_fpamnua,1588453771.0,do you recommend any styles that are high rise with the drawstring? Low rise leggings don’t work with my body type and I’ve only seen the drawstring with low rise pants
lululemon,fpaqn5v,t1_fpap3o8,1588453687.0,I’m wearing a size 8; the smallest part of my waist is 26” and the widest for my hips is 39”. I’ve tried the sixes on multiple times and it’s far too uncomfortable in the thighs or they just don’t even pass through my legs
birthcontrol,fp3ge9h,t1_fp3222m,1588278843.0,Iron and B12 deficiency could be it since I’ve had it in the past. I’ll make sure to get a blood test once everything settles down. Thank you for the help!
birthcontrol,fp2ydot,t1_fp1jitz,1588269961.0,"I tend to drink at least 75oz a day, could that still be the issue?"
AskReddit,fp0jxzo,t1_fozpt7g,1588210767.0,"I’ve been waiting for someone to say this! Why is mental illness being glorified? All I want nowadays is to wake up and not have anxiety or panic attacks for once in my life and these kids are praising each other for having them? I just don’t understand lol why would you want to mentally suffer, it’s really not fun and can take a huge toll on your well being."
lululemon,foqu2p4,t1_fopfjn5,1588000841.0,"From the pictures I can fell that I for sure have larger thighs, I hope the 8 works for me! And thank you for the advice!"
UCSC,fopuidj,t3_g8n8uy,1587972565.0,This showed up on my tik tok too lol how do they know I go to ucsc when I’m currently back at home 😳
lululemon,foof1h5,t1_foobq6a,1587937794.0,"Definitely will stick with 8 then, thank you!"
lululemon,foo4hie,t1_fonyoyt,1587932327.0,"Thank you for this, I’ll definitely go for the 8 then!"
geology,fomatm0,t3_g87euf,1587883566.0,I’ve been shown this video in every geology class and it gets better each time
DrMartens,fokr410,t3_g7shzu,1587847339.0,"I don’t have a particular style and I’ve been loving my jadons for a long time now. I wear them with honestly anything that works with the silhouette of the shoe, whether it’s a dress that’s “girly” or a more unisex “grunge” outfit. Bottom line, they can be worn with anything and they’re really not considered to be a girly shoe!"

curlyhair,fnf0vn2,t3_g16295,1586899368.0,Oh my gosh hahah my hair looks exactly like yours and it’s at the same length too!
DrMartens,fn7bl8y,t3_g0182e,1586717109.0,Love those!! I have these in burgundy and they’re amazing; just watch out for the sole because they tend to wear out faster than you’d think due to the material!
birthcontrol,fn64lxj,t3_fz0k49,1586687218.0,"I got my mirena inserted about a month ago, and about a week in I felt like this too; I’d randomly get faint and shaky which led me to lie down for a few hours until I felt better. Sometimes I genuinely felt like I was going to pass out but it would come in waves and I’d feel better after a bit. I was thinking that it was probably from the hormones but I’m not too sure."
birthcontrol,fn645kb,t3_fz5kq2,1586686700.0,"I got the mirena about a month ago and I’ve also been cramping and having brown spotting basically non stop this entire time. I’ve noticed that my cramping worsens after doing more physical activity so I’ve been trying to be more gentle with it. But honestly I’ve been considering removal too because I also just feel miserable with the cramping, spotting, bloating and also hair loss but I’m just going to stick with it for a few months and see. I really hope your symptoms get better over time!"
akita,fn5sqmt,t1_fn5fl7n,1586674595.0,Awww I’m so sorry 😔
