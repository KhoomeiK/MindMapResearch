UCI,fmt54ba,t3_fx58pf,1586367012.0,"The human brain is weird and forms **associations** with locations. You subconsciously associate some locations with ""relaxation"", such as maybe your bed, and some locations like the library are associated with ""work"". It's possible that your brain associates your bedroom and bed with ""relaxation"" instead of ""work"". 


The way to fix this is to just go to a different location of your house and start working only there. Don't take any breaks in that new location, so eventually your brain will grow to associate that location with work instead of relaxation. If you do have to take a break, go back to your bedroom and do it there. Hope this helps."
