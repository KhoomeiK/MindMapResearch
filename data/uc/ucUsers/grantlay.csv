I’m just saying you’d be treated just fine at a hospital because we have been somewhat effective so far at preventing wide spread infection. 

I wouldn’t want someone to be afraid to go to the hospital with another condition because they think they’d be taking up too many resources."
UCSantaBarbara,fpe8s20,t1_fpdkbvk,1588542630.0,"Latest CDC summary : https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/pdf/covidview-05-01-2020.pdf

3% of hospital visits were for Covid like illnesses during this week in California. I understand not wanting to go in terms of the risk factors, but you’d still get treated just fine."
UCSantaBarbara,fpda8um,t1_fpd6mx1,1588523002.0,"I think we should listen to the stay at home orders, but I’m wondering what you’re reading that says healthy college age students are dying because everything I see either has the group as 21-44 or is just anecdotal about single instances. 

After some googling the best I could find was this: 
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/

Which is still split 0-17 and 18-45. If we look at the 0-17 group, 0 died without underlying conditions. And in the 18-45 we have 1.0% of deaths that were without underlying condition. 

Again I’m not trying to say that we shouldn’t stay at home to protect the vulnerable populations, but what I am saying is that if you’re a 18-25 with no underlying conditions you have an extremely high chance of surviving - probably in the 99.99% range based on what we can see from data."
astrophysics,fp2et5f,t1_fp1qi1o,1588260521.0,"It would just have one constant equation on the screen. F = GM1M2/r^2 (it would have this equation between every body in a naive simulation)

As the other commenters have pointed out, the difficulty in these simulations is using them in real time - I.e the computer has the compute that equation (or some other form that was linked to you in this reply thread) over and over again. The math doesn’t change form as the bodies move."
astrophysics,fonwewj,t3_g8i9ua,1587927797.0,At the undergraduate level I’d say it’s less about actual intelligence and more about your commitment to stay on top of your studies
IAmA,fo3xetc,t1_fo3i08a,1587494573.0,I’ve struggled with this as well my whole life and only in the past -5 months I’ve been able to get passed it (still working through it but a lot better now). What worked for me was focusing on skin care daily. I think for me the urge was in some way an urge to touch my skin and I found that by applying lotion after every shower and putting on face masks helped redirect a lot of that energy. I’m by no means perfect now but the focus on skin care helped me a lot!
dankmemes,fo0sv8r,t1_fo0asd0,1587419131.0,I’m gonna butcher the science but 23&me assigns certain portions of your dna to different places so if they don’t have a place for some part of your dna then it goes unassigned.

wallstreetbets,fnpb3fn,t1_fnpac5a,1587142387.0,You’re assuming ad revenue goes down which maybe true . Another line of reasoning could be increased internet traffic and fed money prompt and increase in ad-clicks and so not too much of ad loss.
