ucr,fo1g7en,t1_fo1bq6v,1587432604.0,"once you switch to a different tab or off the learn page it shows up as ""student not looking at the exam/off exam"" or something like that. it doesn't show where you went it just says that you left the page."

ucr,fnrdoj8,t1_fnrdb05,1587185891.0,I doubt there's enough in the pot to distribute that much to everyone
ucr,fnpz0kq,t3_g388fi,1587154589.0,its a fee. weird thing is when ever I pay it every quarter it gets refunded back to me the following day or two. I wouldn't sweat it
ucr,fmu92z2,t3_fxe9m5,1586386841.0,"the apartment side of UCR other side of the highway is pretty sketchy at night. but I mean we're talking midnight. other then that its pretty good cus there's usually a lot of kids walking back or too school. The other side of the freeway where its just houses is pretty safe, just families and your typical suburban neighborhood."

AskMen,fmnygea,t3_fweo4w,1586239094.0,"Know your audience. If your trying too fit in a group that loves Rap and fast and furious movies but you like indie and David Fincher movies then you kinda have no other choice but to fake it or find rap music that you like. I know its not good to be fake but the people I know (or knew) who did actually like the things I like were never down to do stuff outside and just wanted to game.  Never be quiet/ shy tho because you're going to stick out like a sore thumb no matter how genuine of a person you are. Once your ""in"" the friend group then you can start being a little bit of yourself bit by bit. This is just a scenario from my experience of switching ""squads"" all the time when I was little because I would always change schools and move a lot."
