When I request live chat every time it would get error and switch to page that said that I canâ€™t due to high traffic. I tried request live chat on Firefox a Chrome and on my IPad.

reddeadredemption,foq5oeu,t1_foq3s4l,1587983916.0,This was during mission where you raid Oâ€™Driscol camp in prologue. I was looting corpses and he died because I wasnâ€™t helping. If only this were canon
Persona5,fooj107,t1_foocf02,1587939926.0,Thereâ€™s only one bad ending and you just pick bad dialogue and epilogue just played and ending credits of bad ending no extra gameplay need. Just watch it on YT
Persona5,fooewyo,t3_g8ifd8,1587937732.0,Still canâ€™t do it. Makoto VA doing all the heavy lifting
Persona5,fol84e3,t3_g83cv8,1587856759.0,One thing I do the same: ignore Ohya until thereâ€™s no more left
BattlefieldV,foku43r,t3_g7sxgm,1587848981.0,Iâ€™ll never forget the day that played BF1 Operations for a whole day. One thing I look forward to and was extremely disappointed

Persona5,fo5jpvu,t3_g5qrv8,1587527323.0," [SPOILERS] 






Yes that why you should choose it first. To see the ideal dream like ending first then go the true ending route. You get to see what each of their wish are and understand them on a deeper level. I grew to love them even more because they rejected that ending and choose the real one. 





[SPOILERS] 






I mean you see Yusuke still want Madarame to be his teach. You see Futaba finally have her mother again but still choose to reject it"
Persona5,fo5j5gd,t1_fo5j2em,1587526921.0,His deal is essentially the perfect happy ending in other game
Persona5,fo5fj5v,t1_fo5ewsf,1587524415.0,"That is literally what I meant. the original post complain that 10 hangout was boring and waste of time. I explained that 10 hangout of maruki doesnâ€™t follow am arc like other confident but rather used to introduce player to him so that is why may be boring for some. His true arc is shown during his palace. But character development/building happens in the hangout so it still serve an important purpose 

He have an arc but is not in hangouts but in 3rd semester we get to see it. 

The hangout is for shows his POV and just talking with him and learning about him IMO"
Persona5,fo5egze,t1_fo54h41,1587523699.0,I donâ€™t see it from rank 1-10 lol
Persona5,fo54eej,t1_fo547tk,1587517260.0,I meant he donâ€™t have an arc but itâ€™s still character development since we learn a bit about him and his ideal/POV
Persona5,fo52mrf,t1_fo4vq7o,1587516181.0,Bruh I plat the game
Persona5,fo52fej,t3_g5qrv8,1587516059.0,All I can say is choose the ending that you not going to want first
Persona5,fo52a57,t3_g5qsu2,1587515970.0,I canâ€™t even contact them wtf
Persona5,fo52588,t3_g5qvay,1587515887.0,"Whole game is time wasters. Maruki counseling is where protagonist and him ease of and discuss/introduce abstract ideas and motivation that are present to player in the third semester. His theme during counseling also have a relaxing feeling to it adding to the relaxing nature of his confidant. 

Thereâ€™s isnâ€™t character development like how each oTher confidant go through change and arrive at their own realization for Maruki. So thatâ€™s maybe why. But I like his confidant route looking back as just fun philosophical discussions and interest ideas presented which also serve as character building and introductions"
Persona5,fo510ef,t1_fo505f5,1587515205.0,"Farm money in mementos and spend it on Chihaya, donâ€™t hangout with confidant until it said up next to their name. Keep Affinity reading them until they do. If no one is available thatâ€™s when you infiltrate palace and mementos

Edit: Also play dart it and billiards when thereâ€™s no rank up. It help gain some point toward multiple confidant, social link and help with baton pass and technical damage at the same time"
Persona5,fnyvo10,t3_g4k6un,1587377403.0,Finished Persona 5 and was left with a void. 3 says later it was filled with Royals. Just finished Royals today. Persona 5 have become a routine that I feel empty without it
Persona5,fnyvfcs,t3_g4knvq,1587377148.0,Lancer become Archer. Hmmmm...
Persona5,fnyvdd0,t1_fny2kko,1587377090.0,I did opposite. I ploughing straight through the game while my new quarter. Next week is midterm for meðŸ˜‚
Persona5,fnyur1y,t3_g4n8en,1587376420.0,I never wanted it to end but Iâ€™ll agree that it about 10-15 hours. Less for me since I maxed almost everything even before Sae boss
Persona5,fnyukcx,t3_g4nhu1,1587376217.0,For P5R?
Persona5,fnyu9w9,t3_g4o8k9,1587375902.0,Just got mine right now as well
Persona5,fnyu3m9,t3_g4oqtf,1587375712.0,Buy get it right now. If you finish original I doubt that you have the willpower even try to finish Royal right after. Itâ€™s just start a new game. Youâ€™re probably going to have to replay like 8-10 hours but thatâ€™s petty compared to the length of the game
Persona5,fnytsyu,t3_g4pl8p,1587375390.0,Marukiâ€™s is just so peace and fun. One my new fav. Just finished the game there will be a lot more faves coming your way

UCSantaBarbara,flwcrnn,t1_flwcdle,1585546278.0,Maybe giving a week so student and teacher could workout schedules and time to organize. My professors page is chaotic and not organize at all. The extra week would give them time to organize and formal instructions would start next week
