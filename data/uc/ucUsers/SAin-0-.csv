One things that has been keeping me going is pretending that I still have the class schedule and lectures and all that."

UCSD,fnc2fiq,t1_fnbu7p1,1586827200.0,"I never thought that I could burn out studying at home, but it's week 3 (feels like week 8) and I am at a point where even sleeping, let alone trying to study, in my rooms gives me a headache and makes me sick. 

I also ""love"" how not weekends are also fair game. So instead of a 5 day week its a 7 days week for some courses. 
Oh how I love waking up on a Sunday and not being able to tell what day of the week it is because they are all the same!"
relationship_advice,fn5w5u8,t1_fn4qypt,1586678020.0,"Very true. 
My mum is extremely anti vax and anti medical anything too. No matter ho much information I try to give her or how much I try to explain she never listens.
All i can recommend is to just be patient and try to talk to her as calmly and nicely as you can. Maybe give her some studies/evidence to look at in her free time or look over it with her."

TA: sections are prerecorded or 1/3 of the time of what they originally were
