UCSD,fp05oj8,t1_fozuok7,1588202960.0,"No Problem! I hope this help you to narrow down your choice a little bit. 

Answer to your question: It really depends on the professor, classes with good, passionate professors get filled up fast, so you will really need priority registration if your target is to get into all the classes with good professors. Some are passionate about the subject they teach like professor Cooper, Emily, Michael burg in the bio department.

 However, there were many professors I have taken where they aren't particularly passionate about teaching and it is a frustrating experience (I won't state name). Sometimes you are left with no option and to take that professor as only one professor teaches the particular class in the quarter. Also, larger classes with 200-350 students are also factor which you will most likely see at both schools. It is not the best experience as a Pre-med.  So overall, I would say some are passionate about what they teach and some aren't."

EDIT:"
UCSD,fozpcnk,t3_gaecv8,1588194525.0,"I did choose UCSD and got in to UCLA. I am a transfer premed and a bio major at UCSD. You can't go wrong in choosing either one if you are a bio major, because they both have excellent programs in Biology, so it wasn't a factor in my decision when choosing either one.  However,  my decision was based on my cost of attendance and accessibility to get needed classes(got priority registration at UCSD), gain experience in healthcare. The financial aspect was a major factor since I'm planning to go to med school, I need to stay much as possible away from debt. Also, I am from SD, so staying close to my house gave me a little advantage. One more thing, I didn't like the 6 (7 now) different college system at UCSD, some might like it but not me or my friend.

If you wanna know about the premed-culture at UCSD, you should read this as it may help with your decision. Written by u/elucidateobfuscation.  \[I didn't put the quote block as it takes away numbered list\]

Pros:

1. We have a medical school/health system (and attached VA system) and some other places like Scripps Health are nearby - it's a great place to get clinical experience, volunteer, shadow a doctor, do research, etc. most of which are pretty essential components of the med school app. It also happens to be pretty well ranked which is also a plus.
2. We have a LOT of research/are very research focused - there's plenty of opportunities and programs to get involved in research. Regardless we are next to some great research institutes like Salk and Sanford Burnham which are all great places to research. This is particularly useful if you're interested in the MD/PhD route, as a huge component is the wetlab/dry lab experience.
3. The bio department is pretty high ranked in general - there's a lot of great profs, good classes, world class researchers, etc. which attracts a lot of funding and grants to our bio department. We have lots of interesting research groups, centers, etc. for niche areas and this is true of our classes. I have a few friends who are premed at my instate schools (I'm out of state) and a few other states and their majors as well as courses do not contain the same level of depth or niche areas that we do. Their biochemistry series for examples is 1.5 years long (3 semester classes) but essentially just covers half of our metabolic and maybe half of our molecular bio classes. They also lack a number of the higher level upper div bio classes we have. Of course this is anecdotal!
4. There's a good amount of premed clubs based around preparing for med school, getting volunteering experience, getting into a lab, etc. so there's a strong premed community/presence (though I believe UCSD is already known for this, so it might be a given). There's also no shortage of service based clubs/orgs which is also a great perk for a med school app.
5. For some, the quarter system may be a boon! It gives you more chances to take the classes you might need or think would help, explore interests, and enables more forgiveness if you need to retake some (ex: ochem or gen chem is offered multiple times a year instead of 1 time a year). THOUGH THIS MAY ALSO BE A CON (explored below).
6. The BS/MS programs are nice if you're interested in the MD/PhD route or want something to do in a gap year should you decide to take one. You can get a bio masters in a year, which is great to have incase you decide med school isn't for you, as it helps a lot in industry - plus it can be partially (if out of state) or fully covered if you get a TA position! It's great to have the extra training, the thesis, and possibly a publication if you're interested in the MD/PhD route and helps give a bit of a leg up.
7. I haven't done this, but I know there's a Palomar Pathmaker Internship which is another program to get clinical exposure/experience and seems pretty popular (from what I've heard). That's another great offering; there are also some direct programs with the UC Health System that are similar too that I can't recall the name of currently.
8. Even with the capped bio major (though it can be switched into), there are plenty of other majors that match a good number of premed requirements or provide a great background as well. A few examples are Human Developmental Sciences, Global Health, Science/Med Sociology, and even Biological Anthropology.
9. We're located in a biotech hub so there's plenty of places to get internships with and industry experience, which is always a nice addition to any app and many of the local companies are still involved with the health field (drug design/therapeutic research, clinical trials, etc.) so they are relevant.

Cons:

1. Because of our research focus, sometimes the course education can be lacking - there are the profs that are more interested in their research rather than teaching, so you can get poorer experiences based on prof interactions and the sheer size of some bio classes. This can result in just not learning as well as you could if smaller class sizes were more emphasized for example.
2. Along the research emphasis, it is a bit competitive to get spots as there are a lot of students beyond premeds also trying to get research positions. There is a huge demand for lab positions that exceeds the supply generally.
3. The premed culture isn't cutthroat (at least in my experience), but it certainly isn't the healthiest. There is a high level of stress regarding scheduling, grades, extracurriculars and research, etc. that can be exhausting and draining for some.
4. The quarter system can be a problem as it only exacerbates stress by making people feel even greater pressures on a shorter timetable - it's quite the crunch. Furthermore, much of medical school is about understanding and solving problems, but the quarter system can result in students feeling pressured to memorize rather than understand - you also end up getting a bit of a shallow look at the key subjects rather than a more intricate and in depth study of them. The nature of the quarter system means it can be easy to fall behind and feel more overwhelmed if you don't do as well. It also amplifies the typical first year poor GPA (for med school standards) trend that is pretty common for people coming straight out of high school, as you have more credits and classes that you may have done not as well as you could have with more time and experience in the system.
5. Depending on the college, the GE system can really get in the way of getting your premed coursework done. It can mess up planning, or just add to a high workload and cause stress. Also, they often really do not relate well to the courses you would typically take and feel out of place at times.
6. Some recommended or useful courses for med school are either not offered or offered sporadically - one reason for this is issues between various departments and the medical school regarding sharing resources. I just took a human anatomy class (offered here only 1 time in the 4 years I've been here iirc and the prof is moving to Davis next quarter) and we did not have a lab component due to the department unable to get any lab space or shared resources from the med school, according to the prof/department at least. There are other colleges/universities that offer either the lab component or some of these niche classes that we just can't offer or match currently."

However, it also comes with the fact that you will be spending more time memorizing than learning the subject especially if you are taking stem classes in a quarter system. I prefer the semester system as I am a premed who actually has to have a good understanding of some of the subjects like chemistry, bio and etc. Also,  for me having a better understanding of a particular subject area benefit more than taking multiple classes. The quarter system really feels like a rushed system but both systems has pros and cons.
