UCSD,fmxf2ih,t3_fxzm7h,1586463793.0,"content is *super* understandable/easy (action potential/myelination) so far if you've taken BIPN100, but seems like there's a solid amount of weekly quizzes/homework/projects.... which sucks doodoo"
UCSD,fmn4bbb,t3_fw7kav,1586217915.0,I feel like since all my classes are trying to spread things out so that all the points aren't concentrated on one MT/one final = entire grade and so that it's now spread out into weekly quizzes I don't know how to keep everything on track :(
UCSD,fmn42l7,t3_fw6jvg,1586217771.0,"I would say do it in batches of applications, such as like at the middle/end of spring quarter, in the middle of summer, and at the end of summer! That way you get the maximum coverage and can also follow up on anything needed during those times."
UCSD,fm6y4ho,t3_ft88ch,1585806758.0," I took 40CH solely because I reallllyy did not want to take the 40C professors (Hoeger and Ternansky) so I guess I took it purely for the academic aspect and not because I enjoyed the content.

I do think that Tor is a good teacher, but he can be a little tangential in his explanations since he expects students that are taking the class to have a deeper interest in ochem. I wouldn't say that the content is too challenging, but it is extremely helpful to go to OH and form a study group since he lectures by writing a bunch of mechanisms on the chalkboard and can skim over things pretty fast. I learn ochem best with step by step mechanisms/arrow pushing etc, and I think that Tor taught that pretty well, as opposed to Hoeger and Ternansky, who I heard both like to use a lot of words in their slides and are more conceptual/word based.

The class kinda sucked in that I don't love ochem and it felt like everyone else was smarter than me, but I don't regret taking it because being in the ""honors"" environment pushed me to do better than I would have in 40C (I think).

Here are my stats for better clarity in helping you decide your fate:

40A: A

40B: A-

40CH: A-

My 40CH MT avgs: 50% ish? Final: 48% I think?"
