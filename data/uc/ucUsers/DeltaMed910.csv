PhysicsStudents,fpil1jg,t1_fpgqdez,1588643124.0,"He's a great instructor who definitely knows his shit and has several strategies for explaining complicated topics to students. Some fun facts:

Although our institution focuses on sending students to grad school, Griffiths actually strongly encourages us to become high school teachers! He believes that the US high school physics curriculum is degrading into ""just another math class"" with rote computations. This is because-- according to him-- not many physics majors teach high school. So, the classes are taught by math or chemistry folks, who never took upper div physics to know how everything actually pieces together. Thoughts?

Ironically, Griffiths also discourages student research at our institution, as ""nothing compares to a summer at Stanford.""

He also helps another physics prof document birds in Portland as a fun hobby.

Every senior has a year long thesis, and I think many of them get personally destroyed by Griffiths at some point in their thesis-writing... All character building, I hope!

Lastly, all Reed textbooks are printed in-house, so they're around $12 a pop, purely to cover printing costs."

I still have at least a year before I begin my senior thesis, but I was hoping to try actually *making* a C-14 battery... The thesis is a HUGE deal at my institution, Reed College. You may recognize some of our physics theses, like the cathode ray oscilloscope! (You probably also recognize Griffiths' texts...)

Many sophomores/juniors spend their summers on relevant research projects that contribute to their year-long senior thesis. So, as a current sophomore, I'm narrowing down what work I need to do in the next 2 summers to ensure I have all the tools to make this C-14 battery in my senior year.

I've already completed a literature review on the subject matter, so I'd like to think I have a pretty good idea of what the current progress is and what needs to happen next. 

Thanks for your helpful offer. I completely understand if you're uncomfortable with this, but would you mind suggesting a name from the Bristol group that I could reach out to? I'd appreciate your input, rather than me flying in blind with no personal knowledge of Bristol's faculty.

Also, thanks for the suggestions on the infographic. You're right, I really skimped out on the graphics! Maybe I'll remake it when I do go deeper with this project."

Once you get past the initial ""intuitive"" hump in introductory kinematics, it's just harder and harder calculus and linear algebra from there.

On the other hand, I think there is a very high probability that your experience with mathematics is warped from high school math-- where ""being good at math"" is someone who can solve the longest integral. It's actually so not. I haven't **computed** as much as I've **rigorously proved** every single tiny mathematical principle. Have you looked into analysis courses? That's really what collegiate math is about.

However, Korea has a serious fucking problem with their OPERATORS. Like holy shit you can get a reactor operator's license in Korea without having ever operated a nuclear reactor before-- you just need to pass a theory exam.

Also, I saw older operators ask *unlicensed* 후배's to watch the console for them while they step out for a smoke.

The Korean social hierarchy hampers the precise, critical, open communication necessary to safely operate a nuclear fucking reactor, as the 선배-후배 relationships are abused to skirt strict procedures."

reedcollege,fn2z006,t3_fysrld,1586608265.0,"I'm a physics sophomore that overloaded with chemistry courses for 3 semesters. This semester, I finally crashed and burned. I appreciate and can empathize with your enthusiasm to take all these interesting classes, seriously.  We may or may not know each other irl, but, as some comparative baseline, I'm speaking as a student that whizzed thru 14 AP's in high school.

So far, your Physics 100's class has been with other chemistry and biology majors. Most important to your undergraduate career isn't spreading yourself thin; you want to do *well* in your classes so that you have solid foundations to move on. **YOU DO NOT WANT TO OVERLOAD WITH PHYSICS 201 AND MATH 202!!!**

I was also one of those ""early birds"" that tested out of Math 111 such that I was able to take Math 202 as my 3rd Reed math course. In my Fall 2019 Math 202 course, there were 6 students enrolled in Physics 201 and Math 202, and only 2 remained in Math 202 by the end of the semester. Either Jerry will tell you to drop, or you will want to shoot yourself from the world's most theoretical rendition of vector calculus. The workload for Jerry's vector calc is an insane amount to be overloading with. It's about 10 problems twice a week (3x long as Angelica's linear psets) and a quiz (which you need to typeset) every other week.

About chemistry-- as a physics student, you will have a *some* physical foundation to handle QM and Thermo (333, 332) in the chem department. I am currently enrolled in CHEM 332 Thermodynamics, having taken CHEM 101, 102 in my freshman year. However, as a sophomore, you will be in a 300-chemistry course with chem juniors and seniors that have a large organic chemistry background (CHEM 201, 202, 212). As such, the upper-div ""physical"" chemistry courses are all *very* applied to organic chemistry. For instance, although I understand the basic physics principles in Thermo, I'm left in the dust once we start analyzing the thermodynamics of complex organic reactions. In Chem QM, we apply square well approximations to finding bond lengths in organic compounds.

Imagine it the other way around: would you think a sophomore chemistry major would succeed in 300-level math/physics courses?

(Now, I know gen chem and ochem are not prereqs for QM and Thermo. I'm just telling you from hard experience that the profs WILL make a lot of connections to ochem because that's what 95% of the class has taken.)

Apologies if I sound too pessimistic or exaggerating. Overloading with an already tough 200-math/phys courseload was one of the worst, depressing experiences of my life. I'm just seeing a lot of similarities between your and my trajectories, and I don't want to see a fellow physics student have a not-fun time... :((

&#x200B;

Edit: Also, have you seen your transcript? I know Reed doesn't emphasize grades, but if your plan is grad school, your transcript can be a good ""hard"" tool to see if you should be overloading or not. My advisor does not approve overloads at all unless you have a 3.5ish or above."
