Any economic â€˜principlesâ€™ are incredibly influenced by the ideology of the person espousing them, whereas science theoretically is not. Oftentimes, â€˜economicsâ€™ is thinly-veiled justification for class warfare. Itâ€™s not that people donâ€™t think that $15 minimum wage wouldnâ€™t have ramifications, itâ€™s that people think the ramifications are okay or the system should be amended to make them okay."
