Thanks for doing this AMA! I first saw you in 2015, and I’m so happy that 5 years later you’re still making music that’s so fresh and easy to vibe with. I love the journey you’ve taken us on with your sound! 

You toured with Zhu a couple years ago (saw you in Santa Cruz CA! I awkwardly asked you about your lunch) and you two absolutely killed it. Any plans to collaborate or tour with Zhu again soon? 

Your mellow vibes and dreamy beats are godsend during all this chaos, I’m really looking forward to Oasis Nocturno! It’ll be the perfect soundtrack to the days I’ll be spending inside the next couple of weeks. Hope you and yours can stay healthy and safe!"
