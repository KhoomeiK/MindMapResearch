UCDavis,fplytcw,t1_fplx2py,1588722115.0,"> You already turned in the SIR so there's really no going back.

Actually no, the only loss they would have would be that they wouldn't get the SIR fee refunded. I also SIR'd to a different school before getting off the waitlist for Davis. I mean, it's a lot of money to throw away, so it's better to be sure you want to go to SB over Davis.

Definitely agree that all schools have good and bad sides which are personal to each student. UCD/UCSB is not suitable for all kinds of students."
UCDavis,fply7ix,t1_fpltsks,1588721773.0,"I'm really surprised by that, ahaha. It's also my last quarter, and I've had inclusive access almost every quarter. Definitely repeatedly call/email if you can, I've heard that worked for a few classmates."
UCDavis,fplmin7,t1_fpllyci,1588715406.0,"You should have gotten an email near the beginning of the quarter saying ""You have classes that are using inclusive access, you can opt out here"". Some classes will automatically opt you in and some will just give you the option to opt in. You might want to make sure to check all your emails since this probably won't be the last class you take that has inclusive access. You also might be able to contact support for a refund if you've never once accessed the textbook or resources."
UCDavis,fpe8n7p,t3_gcybvz,1588542553.0,"Not sure if you've seen the [ [UC Davis Class of 2024 Waitlist thread](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-california-davis/2178767-uc-davis-waitlist-discussion-class-of-2024-p3.html) ] on College Confidential. I think more waitlisted students tend to post there then on this subreddit.

Someone apparently emailed a representative on Friday who said they expect to release waitlist decisions next week or the week after."
UCDavis,fp7dm6w,t1_fp5ftib,1588368645.0,"Hard to say, though I'm leaning more towards no. The upper division courses that are taught once a year are often within a pretty specific field of study. Think, food microbiology within food science. So these courses are usually pretty small, 30-80 students? The likelihood that deferred students would make up a majority of such a small class seems unlikely. That, and students who transfer (so students who go to a CC this fall instead) will largely be unaffected. Honestly, I feel like more freshmen will elect to go to CC than defer. I didn't transfer, but it's a very underrated path to take."
UCDavis,fp5ekq8,t1_fp5b8nh,1588326458.0,"I mean, keep in mind the world is going through a pandemic, and people here are more recently worried about future instruction being online, signing leases, and their friends' and family's health. No one is unaffected.

Even then, I definitely disagree with you. I've seen a lot of helpful and positive comments still being made, even in your post."

UCDavis,fp3nm2z,t1_fp1x6q2,1588282491.0,"I feel incredibly bad for incoming freshmen who won't have the true first quarter experience of college (on the flip side, I'm supposed to graduate this quarter, so I empathize) but taking fall quarter off could definitely have more consequences besides graduating a few months later.

For example, there are some classes that you need to take in a series (think A, B, C). There are also some required classes that are only available once a year that have the C class as a prerequisite. If you don't have it done in time before the class is offered, you might have to put off taking that class for another year. For students who are already familiar with their 4-year plans, this wouldn't be as big of a deal since they can account for it, but for freshmen who may not be sure if they want to switch majors or not (very common), it could delay graduation more than a few months.

Definitely a difficult situation for everyone. Best of luck whatever you do. :( Sorry it had to be this way."
UCDavis,fowflar,t3_g9yi7c,1588118814.0,"(I think) To meet minimum progress, you need to take 36 units in the school year, which comes out to a minimum of 12 units per quarter. 12 units is also the requirement to be considered a full time student, so if you're getting financial aid, you'll need to make sure you sign up for at least 12 units. That being said, advisers usually recommend incoming freshman to take 3 classes during their first quarter, as you'll be adjusting to a very different lifestyle, and it may be overwhelming. Some freshman do take more than 3 classes their first quarter, and some adjust well and others don't. You're free to drop any class either before the 10th day of instruction, or the 20th depending on the class.

As to what classes we could recommend, that completely depends on your major. Typically, freshman have an orientation during summer where peer advisers help you choose your classes your first quarter, but they'll probably have an online version this summer. If you know your major, you can google ""(major) 4 year sample plan UC davis"" or the major requirements for more specifics about what classes you need."
UCDavis,fosch3n,t3_g97xuw,1588028015.0,"> 90% of people get accepted off the wait-list

Not true, but even if it were true in one particular year, it doesn't have any bearing on this year.


In terms of the waitlist, you're only ""competing"" with other waitlisted students within your major. The more students that choose to attend UCD, the less spots there will be available for the waitlist group. So what's often the case is that more students in impacted majors will choose to attend, leaving less spots, if any, for the waitlist. 


If there are available spots for waitlisted students in a given major, the highest ranked students within that major will get accepted from the waitlist, and they'll continue down the list until there are no more spots available. 


From what I've seen, most of the waitlist acceptances get sent out within the first week of the first wave. Then waves after that are because not all waitlisted students accept a spot."
UCDavis,fosb70g,t3_g9b34y,1588027320.0,Depends on the professor's choice which I imagine is the same at most universities.
UCDavis,fordrld,t3_g93qq0,1588010503.0,"The requirements to change your major are here:
https://cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/non-majors/changing-majors-double-majors

You can't change your major until you have completed at least one quarter at UCD, but you also have to take 6 specific major classes and have a 3.0 GPA here. You can start to take CS classes without having officially changed majors.

> Also what are the financial aid available for international students?

The university itself offers very little to no financial aid to international students because it's a state run university, but I found a list of resources on the website here:
https://financialaid.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/apply/international"
UCDavis,fnyb7lz,t3_g4lo94,1587358098.0,"https://cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/non-majors/changing-majors-double-majors

Down at the bottom of the page should have the requirements for transfers. Probably your main concern is if you ""Have completed all transfer admission course requirements for the intended major"". You probably need to look into what the required transfer courses are for CS majors."
UCDavis,fnraxst,t1_fnragg7,1587183734.0,"Ahaha, I actually did one of the study abroad programs while I was in Davis; I went during the summer to Japan.

I honestly think Davis has some of the best study abroad programs. They will actively encourage students to study abroad, and a lot of students from other universities also apply for the programs here.
Definitely a worthwhile thing to look into, and most programs are ideally taken after your 1st or 2nd year."
UCDavis,fnra34i,t1_fnr9b23,1587183094.0,"I was definitely thinking of you when I wrote ""few staff"", haha.
Honestly, whenever I see one of your replies, I always recall this memory from a few years ago; you were getting off at the same obscure bus stop on the ~~/~~ line and because it was quite dark, the dim streetlamp made you look very scary with the cape (given it was the first time I had ever seen you).

Hahaha, so nostalgic."
UCDavis,fnr8j5h,t1_fnr1qi6,1587181950.0,"Honestly, that reply seems very bizarre to me. There's only a few staff members actually on the subreddit, and no one here has responded ""UCD is the best school ever!!"" or anything like that. As a current 4th year who has nothing to do with the admissions office, I can assure you that like all universities across the world, there are students here who are happy, and some that are unhappy. 

The Wildfire app is more of a meme app that also gives information/updates from other students. It's very entertaining, but people also largely use it to vent. Obviously most students aren't going to be posting ""I'm having a great time here"" more than ""I'm really stressed out and regret coming to Davis"". You can somewhat gauge how great Davis students' meme game is, but otherwise I wouldn't take it too seriously.

My advice is rather corny, but university really is what you make of it. The experiences students have here vary so greatly, but a lot of it is also how we as students choose to spend our time. How often you talk to your major's faculty, how you split your time between studying and friends. Now that you're heading off to college, there are a lot of decisions you have to make for yourself that maybe you've never actively thought about before.

I'd also say, don't beat yourself up too hard if things don't go right the first couple times. What I'm talking about is, a lot of us have failed midterms in our first year, and it's really easy to become extremely discouraged after only ever having Bs/As in high school (especially if you felt good when you were actually taking the midterm). Going to university is a learning experience, and everyone adjusts at their own pace.  Compared to high school, midterms are worth much more in terms of your final grade, but it's almost always possible to recover, so try to keep positive!
(P.S. my best friend was also choosing between UCLA/UCD. She's never regretted choosing Davis apparently.)"
UCDavis,fnijb6c,t1_fni7udt,1586980977.0,"I really do feel for prospective students, as visiting the campus really helps you gauge the environment and overall student happiness. The previous year, one of the moderators setup an [Incoming Class Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/b6szlr/2019_new_admits_incoming_class_megathread/) where prospective students (transfer or not) could ask questions. Not sure why one wasn't made this year.

I guess one of the issues is that the sub doesn't get a ton of threads made usually, so if each prospective student makes their own thread, it can clog the sub very quickly, making it difficult to navigate through. That, and a lot of them are titled something like ""UCD vs UCI??"" etc, and most of the students here have very little personal experience with other universities. Obviously not all threads are like that, but prospective students should narrow their questions to ones most UCD students would be able to answer instead of ""Would it be better to go to SLO in (major) than attending UCD in (other major)?"" That, and questions like, ""Convince me to love UCD"" really rub the students here the wrong way."
UCDavis,fmrq3ch,t3_fx0lmw,1586331364.0,"The number of people that get off the waitlist varies wildly from year to year (from most people getting off the waitlist, to less than 10). 

I remember calling the admissions office about the same thing, and they had said that you obviously should avoid getting any D's or F's, but 1 C (even if you project your spring grades to be all B's/A's) would be fine. Any number of B's will not be alarming at all, and I can imagine they'd be especially lenient this year."
UCDavis,fmae8g5,t3_fu1xus,1585891298.0,"Even if there isn't crazy roommate drama, I think there's a higher probability of just not being compatible with your roommate when you choose random.

I also chose random, and my rooommate and I were just really different. She'd go home every weekend, and even when we did talk during the week, it'd be really minimal and awkward. I think most days we'd only say,""Hey, can I turn off the lights?"" at most. If the deadline isn't too close, I'd keep looking. I regret not finding someone."
