There’s people on this subreddit who seem to have a frothing hate for UCSD and others who seem to think that people with a bad experience are wrong and didn’t try hard enough. Like, the school has problems. Immense problems. It’s not a bad school by any means, and you’re right that the opportunities UCSD offers can make up for a lot of it but jeez man. Don’t devalidate other people’s experiences.

You don’t have to defend the school at every negative post. Freshmen will figure out what they want. Everyone else will disagree or agree quietly. Let the guy vent."
UCSD,fpbj869,t3_gcghg8,1588471269.0,"Good luck, dude! And good on you. It seems a lot of people on this subreddit get mad when others don’t like the school or say it’s socially dead but like...it is lol. UCSD has a lot of problems and some acknowledge them more than others. I’ve met quite a lot of peers who respond to the whole “are you happy here?” Question with a “ehhhh I guess”. Good on you for taking that leap! I wish I could do the same."
UCSD,fp8vac4,t3_gc2bi6,1588404190.0,"W3 Schools is an excellent place to start in my opinion. I solely depended on those tutorials to pass my coding class last quarter. I’m sure there’s more options out there, but so far this is the best I’ve come across."
UCSD,fnb14o2,t3_g0o55f,1586807393.0,"Cope, my dude. We’re in a literal pandemic and the fate of next quarter depends on how well this virus is handled. Your mental health being affected is a side effect of UCSD’s choice on online classes, not a goal. It’s not ideal for many, but we want to keep people alive and healthy."
UCSD,fmku4qs,t3_fvpdc4,1586168758.0,"I took a full year of Spanish to knock out GEs. It depends how comfortable you are with it and where you end up in class ranking (since Spanish classes range from beginner speaker to intermediate essays and literature, I believe.)
It can be lot of work. I say that as a Hispanic from a Spanish-speaking household, but I’m pretty terrible at speaking it. Lots of worksheets, they base your grade on participation and effort. Styles can differ between TAs. One was a stickler for how we spoke while another just liked us showing up and trying. I had quizzes, partners to speak with, workbooks, presentations, and it kinda felt like high-school work tbh.
If you’re worried about time management, the classes can be time-intensive if you’re stuck on some concepts but it shouldn’t be like, math 20C levels of difficulty. Just gotta commit to the language and you’ll get by just fine."
