ApplyingToCollege,fot4zrl,t1_fot33ep,1588044774.0,"* ucsb

I wouldn't say that the ""less research opportunities"" is really correct. It has a student body of \~26K compared to UCSD's \~39K and 90% of students there are undergrads (10% grads). also, the thing about no medical school/hospital is kinda a setback but they do have these 2 places that I've heard called Samsun clinic and Goleta Hospital that pre meds frequent. 

* ucsd

idk, I've heard on reddit either it's very academically focused but the people are mostly supportive, but others say that they felt the competition was toxic. It's interesting to hear that you said the food was nice since I've heard from a friend who goes there say that it's just eh, but you can use the bus to get to good places (I'm not too familiar with the bus system tho). Plus, I don't think you should bank on honors for med school. I hear a lot of people drop out because the reqs to take a certain # of honors courses can be a lot, so imo you should be cautious about thinking you'll stay in the honors college (I guess this goes more for ucd/ucsb) all the way up till your 4th year. 

If you're not sure about a campus' vibes, then I would suggest you go on youtube and find videos from people that have toured the campus. [this youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF80ItSXNzvgPiSoGKANx2g) has some videos of ucsb and ucd but not ucsd but I’m sure you can find something else easily on youtube"
