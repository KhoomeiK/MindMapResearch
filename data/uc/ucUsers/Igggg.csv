Yes. This is called *socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor*, and is a pretty established economic model in the U.S."
law,fovtsnk,t1_fovhlih,1588107396.0,"> Exactly. Dedicate a specific bureaucracy to it, make sure its properly funded for its needs, have strict oversight, and any ""profits"" are just used to bolster the system. That seems way more efficient to me that worrying about dividing profits among stockholders, private investors, and corporate boards.

There was a guy running on this platform this year. He lost the nomination of the supposedly more liberal party, because this is America, and people are very scared of ""socialism"", without, of course, understanding what it means."

This is only true if you view the goal of the American healthare payment system as protecting people's health. If you instead view it for what it is - a pure profit-generating industry - then everything makes sense."

legal,fncu1t0,t1_fncp1nm,1586847202.0,"> I get the whole idea of you having to meet subclause (I) and subclause (II) to qualify.

No, you only need one of the two, not both. There's an OR between them.

>the individual is unemployed, partially unemployed, unable, AND unavailable to work because COVID-19 reasons.

No, the OR is obviousty intended there. Those are partially exclusive conditions - you can't be unemployed and also partially unemployed. Meeting any one of those conditions is sufficient."
legal,fncjvh8,t1_fnbph1n,1586838617.0,"[Let's look at the document](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr748/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf).

Section 2102 (a)(3)(A)(II) says:

> is   self-employed,   is   seeking   part-time   employment, does not have sufficient work history, or    otherwise    would    not    qualify    for    regular    unemployment  or  extended  benefits  under  State  or  Federal  law  or  pandemic  emergency  unemployment  compensation  under  section  2107  and  meets  the requirements of subclause (I) [...]

And (I) says:

>I)  is  otherwise  able  to  work  and  available  for  work  within  the  meaning  of  applicable  State  law, except the individual is unemployed, partially unemployed,   or   unable   or   unavailable   to   work   because— [...]

So anyone that matches either the text of (I) or the text of (II) (where the latter lists a number of conditions and then ANDs them with (I)) is ""covered"" within the meaning of (a)(3)(A).

""A or B or C and D"" usually means ""(A or B or C) and D"" in legal documents (although not in computer code :) )"
