UCI,fpbvei7,t3_gcijbp,1588479727.0,"all ph majors have to do a ten week internship (PH 195W), so mandatory experience! i've absolutely loved all of my public health profs so far, but i'm sure there's some bad ones here and there, as there always is. we're currently a program instead of a school, but we're in the middle of transitioning to an official school. they argued about the name for eons lol

uci is just... great. i can't explain it, but the moment i stepped onto campus i knew i had to choose uci. i've been to ucsd, and while the architecture is cool, uci's nature definitely trumps it. especially that glorious park haha

(btw, i actually chose uci for public health over ucsd's program haha, just loved the campus and the vibes a lot more, and liked how there were two public health majors to pick from)"

UCI,foym9cx,t1_foxl3si,1588175058.0,"ooo, that'll be a good experience to use. try to think of things outside of actual high school if you wish (ex: for me girl scouts or soccer has nothing to do with hs, some of it just happened while i was in hs), but honestly anything goes as they know you've haven't had a chance to fully get out there. high school is still a part of you. i would just stay away from clubs if you weren't on board, unless your hs actually had active ones lol. but i think you'll get it, you seem like you care!"
