ucla,fp1a77c,t1_fp18wzy,1588228944.0,How are so many of us on reddit? We probably just don't have lives lol.
ucla,fp0xa0z,t3_ganeaa,1588219010.0,"1. Go through each proof presented in class as thoroughly as possible and make sure you understand it. If you ignore ""minor"" details, it will often bite you in the ass later, so make sure you understand absolutely everything. 
2. I don't know anything about this particular professor, but it's a common trend for upper division math classes to have exam problems similar to hw. The same thing applies: be as thorough as possible when redoing missed hw problems.
3. Once you understand each proof from class, try to memorize them. When memorizing, try breaking large proofs into chunks. So for example, proving the statement in one direction might be one ""chunk"" if it's an if and only if.
4. You need to know every single definition and theorem like the back of your hand. 

It's been said by many people before, but upper division math is tough cuz it's a complete paradigm shift from previous math. If everything doesn't click now, that's ok (it took about a year for everything to fully ""click"" for me). It just needs to ""click"" enough for you to solve problems."

ucla,foywliu,t3_ga4a4z,1588180530.0,"For me the most torturous part of this ordeal is actually similar to what that comment said. I'm paying for this, and obviously I know I should try to get the most out of it, but that's the complete opposite of how i feel rn. Academics just don't feel important when people are dying and future job prospects are evaporating."

worldnews,fnprz74,t1_fnpdmbx,1587150914.0,"I don't think it's that simple. For a lot of people (myself included), it's really hard to work at home just because there's less separation between your work life and home life. Things get ugly fast when you have to start worrying about work in a place you would normally be able to relax in.

Psychologically, I also find it extremely hard to work/live without stepping out of the boundaries of my house except for groceries/essential supplies. I just feel trapped in a way that I never felt pre-quarantine, and this makes it a lot harder to do my regular duties."

stunfisk,fnjibg3,t3_g1wun4,1586999555.0,"Other people have already answered this question really well, but I wanted to add a few things to clarify:

First of all, when people talk about ""momentum"" or ""tempo"", what they're referring to is basically how aggressive your plays are. The best I way I can explain it is that if the momentum is in your favor, you're making aggressive plays and the opponent is forced to react to your plays and prioritize stopping your moves rather than advancing their own game plan. On the flip side, if the momentum is in your opponent's favor, *they're* the one who is making aggressive plays while you are forced to react. 

The game plan of most bulky offense and hyper offense teams is to gain/preserve momentum and force the opponent into an unfavorable position fairly quickly. Meanwhile, the game plan of most balances, stalls, and semi-stalls is simply to outlast the opponent and slowly but surely back the opponent into a corner with things that aren't direct damage (PP stall, status damage, entry hazards, etc.). 

Also, a few things about balance since it hasn't been explained as extensively: balance is basically a mix of bulky offense and stall. While all stall teams have at least 5 walls (completely dedicated defensive pokemon with almost no offensive presence), balance teams usually only have 2-3 walls. Instead, balance has a lot of slow/bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus and Mega Latias that are meant to sit around the entire game and find opportunities to setup. Balance also usually lacks the momentum-gaining capabilities that bulky offense has (i.e. balance teams are usually played a lot more passively than bulky offense ones and also don't have the momentum-gaining pivots that bulky offense has)."

ucla,fmlmjk0,t3_fvvm4b,1586189309.0,Yes. But I would recommend only one upper division math course for your first two quarters of upper division math.
