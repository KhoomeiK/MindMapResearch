investing,fnu8gbs,t1_fnt8snn,1587256708.0,"no, ***you*** have the math wrong. God why are you redditors so arrogant and pretentious. 

Stock growth is geometric. Which means balancing with something  uncorrelated or anti-correlated will increase earnings if the average return is equal. It can even increase returns using diversification even if the second asset returns less on its own

An approximation for the geometric mean of a normally distributed variable with arithmetic mean m is

    CAGR ~~=  sqrt((1 + m)2 - variance) -1

If asset a and asset b both have average return c, then the cagr of 50% of both is greater than 100% of either. This is because if A and B are independent variables

    Variance( c(A)+ d(B)) = c^2var(A) + d^2var(B)

    arithmetic mean (cA + dB) = (c*arithmetic mean (A) + d*arithmetic mean(b))/2

If c and d are 50%, and the variance of both assets are independent but identical, then the standard deviation the combination is half of either of them. Treasuries are negatively correlated, so this effect is even greater than this formula provides

[Heres a link](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=2004&firstMonth=1&endYear=2020&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&asset1=LongTreasury&allocation1_1=100&allocation1_3=50&asset2=TotalStockMarket&allocation2_2=100&allocation2_3=50)

It shows treasuries have lower geometric and arithmetic mean than the total US market, but the combination of the two rebalanced frequently enough to maintain the ratio has greater yield than 100% of either.

You ***really*** have no idea what you're talking about. Why don't you ""take a math class""."

You could see that on  multiples of 5/10's, the frequency was significantly higher on those than on occurrence as on prices who's one's digit was not 5 or 0.
