VALORANT,fof2cxl,t3_g6k8n1,1587723500.0,"I'm 18, I never wanted to go pro when I was  younger (12-17). Despite that I was addicted to the competition and I ended up probably putting nearly as much time as it would require to be a pro. Did it ruin my academic life? No, I did well in school compared to my peers and my environment. That's what I always thought, I breeze by and keep playing games, but I was just delaying the inevitable. School is easy, but making it a great investment is hard. I'm lucky I got into college but I'm currently lacking the skills needed to excel. Playing games taught me a certain sort of discipline, but one that was only present when there was a passionate drive, and outside of other hobbies I'm having a hard time applying that to the real world. Do it for yourself, dont neglect life outside of games."
VALORANT,fo91r7g,t3_g65z9d,1587608587.0,I think the best will get is something akin to earlier overwatch with their custom game system (before the workshop update).

VALORANT,fo8zl1i,t1_fo8xn5j,1587607213.0,"Literally all of them have played cs, that's a given, you can't be in the finals never having touched cs before. But then why is there always a voice shitting on all of the other teams, labeling them as ""brers"" saying it will be 13-0 besides the devs?"
VALORANT,fo8zdq4,t1_fo8z01y,1587607088.0,"I never thought about that, I guess you're right. I still think it's pretty easy to get discouraged especially if you've never played a game like csgo."
VALORANT,fo8z2jp,t1_fo8xztd,1587606895.0,"Everyone of them still were more active cs players than the opposing, and that's not even mentioning that all of them at one point or another are considered world class NA players."
VALORANT,fo8ynxf,t3_g6dx52,1587606641.0,"The toxicity was so apparent in twitch chat.

I'm a cs player, atleast I was 4-5 years ago. The apex team are all cs palyers, some years ago as well. Despite this, there's always a toxic shade of the cs community, people who religiously play cs thinking they're better than everyone else, despite a lot of pros from differing games having their start in csgo, they always put ""ow pros"" or ""br pros"" at the end of the stick. This was really satisfying to watch, even though I was expecting NA CS to win I was rooting for Canyon.

This is probably never going to end though and it's unhealthy for the growth of the community."
