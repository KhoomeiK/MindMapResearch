I would say keep it above 3.0 but I think 3.6 is a good goal. Just search average GPA for your job online and I'm sure there is a specific reddit for data science where people know more.

berkeley,fosnupm,t3_g9ctt3,1588034419.0,If you were already intending to do that I wouldn't stress it and you can just tell them. Also a lot more people are mixing and matching this term than others so i feel like you'll look better than you would've before covid.
