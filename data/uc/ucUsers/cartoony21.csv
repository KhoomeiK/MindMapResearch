People tend to be bio, Chem etc. majors because you kill two birds with one stone. Your major classes and your science pre reqs.

Do whatever you’re passionate about!!!"

ucla,fmtm2al,t3_fxa5zq,1586375060.0,If all else fails maybe you can notify your professors of your situation? Tell them how Murphy hall is screwing you and you may be dropped. Maybe they can add you back once everything is cleared up? You have nothing to lose by doing this
predental,fmjs5w0,t3_fvoyk3,1586136620.0,On paper you look great. Good luck!
