ImaginarySliceOfLife,fp7c1g5,t1_fp4ad0t,1588367799.0,"Oh wow thank you so much! I'll definitely be trying all of these, I haven't really watched anime for a while (I've been binging the Great british baking show most recently) but this is totally my niche."

casualnintendo,fook4c6,t1_foo3jgq,1587940555.0,"As a huge fe fan I agree with you. I like all of the characters but the earlier ones (basically the ones who arent Corrin, Robin, and Byleth since those three have unique playstyles) are definitely not all needed."

UCSD,fn7tbfc,t3_fzqi0x,1586727209.0,"There's really not a lot of black students here as other people have mentioned, and obviously with any group of people this big there will be racist or harmfully ignorant people (as unfortunate as that is). At the same time, there definitely is a culture of acceptance, which comes with how many different origins students have. My roommate has been to several Black Resource Center events and she said they really helped her settle in during Welcome Week, it sounded like she would recommend it. I might be biased since my high school was whiter than UCSD, but I feel like diversity is normalized here. Not saying that like it shouldn't be normalized obviously, but that there's a good atmosphere."

UCSD,fmwwu9k,t3_fxuxej,1586454439.0,Same :( staying in shape is very important to me and gyms being closed is the worst. Home/body weight workouts really just don't hit the same
UCSD,fmurr8x,t3_fx9i7l,1586397459.0,"It's really hard to keep track of assignments, especially with classes that don't have regular Zoom meetings. Also for ones I just joined recently, I missed any emails before the first week of classes that explained how those classes would work. I'm constantly worried that there's assignments that I'm missing/don't know about/lost somewhere in the mess of emails."
