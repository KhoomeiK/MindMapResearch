boyslove,fpii80r,t1_fpiehbm,1588641439.0,"Bruh, chill. Another man here and I get it, the problem are women...that write BL like this. And, in a way, is mostly society spoon-feeding them the perception that is ok. Also, they wrote this for other people like them. People have fetishes and they have the right to write and read whatever the fuck they like. The only problem is that something that should be obscure and sought by those interested is widely available to people who don't like that sorta thing. With great power comes great responsibility and studios that greenlight BL series are also responsible for greenlighting problematic titles knowing that their intended audience is a small part of the people who will see this. It is unfair to judge the fans, and the writers, too harshly."
