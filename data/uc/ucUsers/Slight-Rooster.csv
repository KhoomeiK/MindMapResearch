Most CS students do."
ucla,fo9cqxi,t1_fo7psll,1587616018.0,"It's not something where the prof is like ""so now we're going to cover text parsing"". In CS31, you learn for loops, if conditionals, and strings. CS32, you apply those in projects. Then in CS33, you're taught API calls and IO operations for handling files. That's all you need for parsing texts from files. UI is arguably not even programming and ""anyone"" can do it with a bit of experimenting and playing around with tools out there (low learning curve)."

If you need help, motivation, or manpower building the software facilitating clarity in understanding the budget expenditures, feel free to post this on the UCLA Computer Science Facebook page. I doubt your technical requirements (text parsing, UI layouts, API creation etc.) would require more than the knowledge of first year CS classes at UCLA and many 1st-3rd year students are hungry for mini projects to slap on their resume (read: they'll help you for free). This would also draw attention from south campus majors, benefitting your campaign. I've never met you before, but you have become a role model to many of us by standing up maturely against people who pull you down.

Kind regards,

Another south campus kid who didn't give a shit about USAC until recent happenings"

[The top 3 ASUCLA directors make around a software engineers salary in Silicon Valley (>$190,000) and 18 directors make north of $100,000.](https://imgur.com/a/8uGIaW7) You can verify it yourself at [https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/](https://ucannualwage.ucop.edu/wage/) with location set to ASUCLA. 

I graduated this school year, but if I were a student, I sure as hell wouldn't contribute extra tuition to their poor management of ASUCLA.
