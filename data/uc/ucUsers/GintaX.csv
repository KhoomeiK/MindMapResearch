NintendoSwitch,foqianm,t1_foqi503,1587994202.0,"Also, past the first “tutorial” week of Animal Crossing, the second player now has most things available to them that the first player does. It just takes time, Nintendo didn’t develop the game to played 24/7 during a quarantine but in short bursts throughout the day."
NintendoSwitch,fopkhyz,t1_fopafrs,1587963919.0,"If you do decide to get a flashy case, you can always teach her good habits on how to protect her switch from being taken, like keeping it secure in a backpack when it's not in use or making sure she keeps it accountable. I bring my switch around in a BOTW flashy case, but I keep it hidden in my car glove compartment or in my backpack when it's not in use and I'm out and about."
Dynavap,fo80mj6,t1_fo7zaep,1587587794.0,"Also I am sorry that your first experience has been wack. I tried both the 2019 and 2020 and I still like my 2019 more because it clicks appropriately. However, I will say the 2020M retains heat much better, so you can get longer rips and even pass it around while it’s hot and I also prefer the body."
Dynavap,fo80d11,t1_fo7zaep,1587587661.0,"2020M takes longer to heat up due to a significantly more massive tip than past dynavaps. If your bud is still green in there, go past the click a few seconds the next time you heat up and rip. Heating by the bottom of the cap helps too. Especially with a BIC lighter, I used to only use BIC and would go past the click on my 2019. It is even more necessary with the captive cap and 2020 tip. Make sure you are also burying the cap in the flame (not at the top of the BIC flame) and rotating quickly."
waterpolo,fo76bis,t3_g5q8d7,1587573004.0,"If you like shooting practice, 5 alive is kinda fun. Each person on the team has 5 lives and lines up single file, with your main goalie in the goal. There’s only one ball, and you shoot penalty shots. If your shot gets blocked or if you miss, you replace the current goalie, and the previous goalie gets to go to the back of the line. If you make your shot, that person loses a life, and you get to return to the back of the line. The whole point is that if you miss, the person who was previously the goalie tries to screw you over by trying to get the ball to the next shooter before you can get in the cage and block. When it comes to someone’s last life, they can only die by a trick shot. If you do “kill” someone, you become goalie. I found this game to be pretty fun, people lose lives surprisingly fast, but the trick shot rule makes it so even people who have never protected the goal before can still try and survive. Also, the more people that experience what it’s like to be in the goal realize how hard a goalie has it in a one on one situation."
UCSD,fo63yml,t1_fo63jtg,1587545614.0,"Chegg Study is a part of chegg where you can put any question you want and a teacher or some other online assistant will answer it. A lot of teachers are online waiting to answer, so you can put up a .pdf or just copy paste questions and get answers in a few minutes. For homework, I assume you could put it up several days in advance and just wait for answers. 


What I don't understand is cheating for BILD 3. That class is about basic evolution theory and concepts similar to that, and most of the homework I got for that class was pretty similar to highschool bio, without being rude to the cheater."
Dynavap,fo50vpa,t3_g5q4pb,1587515127.0,"You can probably try putting a normal cap on your 2020M tip. One issue me and friend had comparing our two Vaps (he got a 2020, I had my 2019M for a few months already) is that even using a torch he had to go past the click an additional 2-3 seconds to get vapor. I think if a normal cap was put on, the heat transfer would be better than the loose captive cap, and probably click when you are meant to stop."
Dynavap,fo4uou0,t1_fo4tv67,1587511572.0,"You still need to pull it out and put it back in if it doesn’t heat it fast enough because dental heaters auto shut off after a few heating cycles. If you are trying to vape quietly, a dental heater makes a repeated click noises while it heats and cycles, which made me not want to buy one."

I recommend this video for learning some technique on the dynavap. His review of the 2019 M also shows how to heat the device well.

Typically you shouldn’t really taste anything burnt on the first hit, but you also won’t get a lot of vapor in the first hit. The second hit is usually the real hit of the dyna in my opinion. 

A good way to check if everything’s isn’t burnt is to just check the color of your bud. If it’s black and grey with ash, you combusted."
