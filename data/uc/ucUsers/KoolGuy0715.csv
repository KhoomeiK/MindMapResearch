I‚Äôm applying to law school this year but will matriculate on the end of August 2021. Sadly there‚Äôs not an option for me to start earlier, which would be nice considering I‚Äôm graduating this fall rather than Spring 2021.

What‚Äôs great is that you don‚Äôt need to file FAFSA with them and can be approved by filing a separate application that they determine independently based on your income.

You can do this at multiple schools if you‚Äôd like to."

Because of Davis and the generous scholarships and aid I‚Äôve received, I will graduate this fall with $0 in debt! 

I‚Äôll probably be swimming in debt when I attend Grad school next year haha. 

The people are very friendly and I‚Äôve been getting good vibes from everyone around campus when in-person instruction existed in the past 2 quarters. 

I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt feel the same way I do, but you must remember that everyone has different perspectives and experiences about anything in general. I personally appreciate the rigor at Davis, it makes me realize that I‚Äôm being trained to test my boundaries in order to realize my academic potential. 

Warm Regards"
LawSchool,fp2w4ks,t1_fp2vmr2,1588268875.0,What do you think will happen then? Do you think that we‚Äôll still have 100% online classes or a mix of in-person and online? What are your thoughts about the classroom structure during my 1L?
LawSchool,fp2uu25,t1_fp2unbc,1588268261.0,Hopefully a vaccine will be made and it‚Äôll be distributed to the general population by August 2021 so that I can complete my 1L with in-person instruction.
LSAT,fp2tdf4,t1_fp08fay,1588267562.0,"I feel the exact same way OP, as a KJD that‚Äôs graduating in Fall 2020 rather than my usual timeframe of Spring 2021, my goal is to do well on the lsat and just get into my schools this year, after which I can rest easy for 8 months and get a steady job I‚Äôm not desperate for, knowing that my family has agreed to keep me in their home till I matriculate to law school in August next year. 

If I don‚Äôt apply to law school this year, I feel like I‚Äôm wasting time and prolonging the inevitable path towards becoming a lawyer (in my case). 

I‚Äôm taking the July Test and will probably take the October one as well if I‚Äôm not satisfied with my July score. I hope you receive sufficient accommodations to be able to take the online exam. 

My school is loaning chrome books to those that need them. Maybe you can try explaining your situation to your school and they can help? I‚Äôm sure you can secure a loan to cover expenditures and housing for a period of time, it‚Äôs time to look into this because I highly suggest you just take the test if you‚Äôre ready and go for it."

UCDavis,fos8jlw,t3_g9aq47,1588025923.0,"I‚Äôm not an expert but if I were you I‚Äôd stick with UCDavis because it‚Äôs ranked #30 whereas UCSD is ranked #50. That‚Äôs a pretty significant difference but it usually depends on where you want to work and what school would better suit your needs. 

However, I also believe that if you shine at a lower ranked university (Performed well academically, participated in meaningful extracurriculars, had the admiration of Professors), I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre in a great position for Jobs regardless of where you went to school."

LSAT,fnuc1iv,t1_fnubx9b,1587258835.0,University of San Diego sent me a random email saying that they‚Äôll fully support LSAT Flex! That only made me more worried whether the schools that I actually want to go will accept it or not.
LSAT,fnubeku,t1_fnub28p,1587258464.0,"Sorry! My mistake you‚Äôre correct there‚Äôs 5 sections on the original lsat which consists of 4 graded sections and 1 experimental sections.

On the lsat flex there are just 3 graded sections. This means that the lsat flex is even shorter than I originally thought! 

I hope the lsat flex is offered in July cause that‚Äôs when I take mine"
LSAT,fnuamtf,t1_fnr52yp,1587257998.0,"In the original exam there‚Äôs 5 sections because of an ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù section that isn‚Äôt graded and counted against you.

There‚Äôs a trade off for having a shorter exam with 3 sections, every question will count this time so you can‚Äôt screw up on one section, do well on the others, and have the chance to get a 170+ because the section you happened to mess up on was the experimental section. 

So yeah there‚Äôs always a catch"
UCDavis,fnu9s8t,t1_fnu93sy,1587257490.0,"It‚Äôs perfectly fine if you take these classes later while you‚Äôre at Davis. You just gotta file a ‚ÄúConcurrent Enrollment‚Äù form in order to receive credit for these classes to apply towards graduation requirements. Keep in mind that if you transfer in more than 70 semester/ 105 quarter units, the rest will be considered as subject credit and not count towards graduation unit totals. 

If you don‚Äôt care about having these classes transferred to Davis assuming you‚Äôve reached the max limit to transfer, you don‚Äôt need to file a concurrent enrollment form and can just apply to Sac City (or any school that provides the equivalent classes to the ones accepted by the panthers legal scholars program) and just take the classes no problem!

Also, what‚Äôs great is that if your income is low enough, you can still apply for a BOG fee waiver through filing a different form at your local cc. This way, you don‚Äôt need to file a FAFSA and will continue to legally be able to get your tuition fees waived at the community college (since they‚Äôre determining independently if they want to waive your fees or not, they‚Äôre not relying on the government to do so)."

UCDavis,fnu5b6d,t3_g3xj8f,1587254839.0,"Well actually there‚Äôs a program offered by Sacramento City College called the ‚ÄúPanthers Legal Scholars‚Äù program. Basically it‚Äôs an honors program where you complete a set amount of classes, after which you become certified as a legal scholar and receive benefits to being admitted to the following Law Schools:

Loyola Marymount

Santa Clara University

UC Berkeley

UC Davis

UC Irvine

UCLA

University of San Francisco

USC

You can still complete these classes at Sac City College and become certified. Speak to Professor David Delaini for more information. His email is DelainD@scc.losrios.edu"
LSAT,fnqmfxc,t1_fnqi1rl,1587167562.0,Also there‚Äôs three sections instead of four so the test is shorter! This is a blessing for those who do not have the stamina to complete a 4 hour exam

I think every soundtrack they offer is beautiful but Terra‚Äôs theme truly hyped me up. Terra is one of the top 5 I like the most because he will do anything to protect his friends and family. His strength of character has rubbed off on Riku too, who has proved on many occasions that he‚Äôs willing to sacrifice his life and be cast away into Darkness in order to protect those that matter to him.

Along with Terra‚Äôs theme I love Riku‚Äôs, Ventus‚Äôs, Aqua‚Äôs, Roxa‚Äôs, Scalia Ad Caelum, Soras Sacrifice (gives me goosebumps every single time), among many others.
