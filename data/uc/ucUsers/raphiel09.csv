UCSD,fnnpjs4,t1_fnnp8dz,1587098121.0,Haha I duh-nuh bruh
UCSD,fnnkfy3,t1_fnnkcbn,1587094473.0,Yea what are they doing for the ceremony? Putting off? Or some weird zoom call haha
UCSD,fnnjzri,t1_fnnjlkf,1587094163.0,"I’m not sure it would just be one quarter. Maybe I’m over thinking this but switching regular in person classes in the middle of the school year would mess with financial aid, housing, and basically any kind of stability anyone’s gotten in the months leading up. I’d hope it’s only for one quarter but who knows."
UCSD,fnnjjpn,t1_fnnj1mm,1587093859.0,"In summary, UCSD and basically every other 4year university in SD is trying to decide whether or not to continue being fully online. They haven’t decided yet because they’re still monitoring the state of the situation but they say it’s a big possibility that it will go that way. It mentions that they’ve already lost a lot of money and will probably loose more, and that they fear a decline in student seeking admission here."
UCSD,fnndms8,t1_fnndhpb,1587089964.0,"Yep yep, I mean I know it’s probably for the best but it really sucks for the incoming freshman."
sandiego,fmtcz9f,t1_fmry8qy,1586370653.0,"Thank you, really, for putting all this here. I was really unsure of where to even look for this information, what to search for. I know other people might have the same question so to have this information here is a good resource to spark some interest to learn more about our state’s/government’s legislation."
sandiego,fmqp9md,t1_fmqdj5t,1586304156.0,Haha no you certainly do not
sandiego,fmqd0pg,t1_fmq49vr,1586297314.0,That last statement is questionable but everything else seems legitimate.
sandiego,fmq8gqc,t1_fmq89xg,1586294837.0,I feel like that’s an oversimplification but I understand what you’re getting at.
sandiego,fmq8a21,t1_fmq69dd,1586294735.0,Thanks for posting this!
sandiego,fmq84er,t1_fmq6xf7,1586294652.0,"No I understand that, I haven’t been out of my house in 11 days. The last time I used my car was for a grocery run. I was just surprised that you can get ticketed for being in your car parked in a Parking lot or on the road. Even being down the street from a beach walking could get you ticketed. I don’t think it’s an overreaction to feel a little bit threatened that a sort of freedom was taken away from you. I have no formal understanding of law this was just something I was curious/worried about."
sandiego,fmq3uog,t1_fmq3nw6,1586292378.0,Can you expand?
UCSD,fmc4bxr,t3_ftza7m,1585938656.0,"Ok this is definitely a vibes for me, Ive been a commuter with three jobs spread out in SD, for the last two years. I’ve saved so much time not commuting, I’ve gotten to do that thing that non commuting/working students get to do where you go over the material before and after class. I still feel like I missing out on the in person aspect of getting to meet your professor and getting to know them, but there’s definitely a give and take here. I would like the lab classes go back to normal, so we can learn technique, but an option for this in the future for commuters sounds like an awesome idea."
