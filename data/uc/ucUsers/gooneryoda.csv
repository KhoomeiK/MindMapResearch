MovieDetails,fp00w9v,t1_fozlb21,1588200405.0,"From 2014....

The Wall Street Journal reported in an interview with character actor Bob Gunton, who’s known for his role as the warden, despite having 125 characters to his name, that it’s Shawshank that keeps steady income. The actor explained just how popular and bankable Shawshank still is today. The 68-year-old said that the residual payments still come in, and they’re pretty steady. For the actor his checks from the film are close to six figures. Since the 10th anniversary in 2004, he has continued to get “a very substantial income” from The Shawshank Redemption. Twenty years is long past the typical age of when a film’s residuals go south.

The film gets played so much that the actor went on to predict that, once he’s long gone he will still be receiving checks. “I suspect my daughter, years from now, will still be getting checks.”"
