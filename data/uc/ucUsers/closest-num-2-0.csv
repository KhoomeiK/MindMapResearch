Bitcoin,fp53q1q,t3_gbd699,1588315310.0,You should use a peer to peer system if you want btc faster. Coinbase takes a lot of time for deposits since that is how it makes profit.
pcmasterrace,fp18hkx,t3_gaqbeh,1588227451.0,find an office that is closing due to covid and get a free herman miller chair. Wipe it down with clorox wipes. Best chair you will ever own.

berkeley,fo0csio,t3_g4z2zb,1587410501.0,Parking at an apartment ranges from 50 to 150 dollars a month so for an academic year 1400 is a bit steep.
berkeley,fnwb40s,t3_g4aj1n,1587314985.0,North side I would argue is better for getting stuff done. You can always meet your friends on south side if its too quiet over here. I think its better but that being said food is further away if you want a late night snack since north side restaurants close earlier.
berkeley,fnqtui8,t3_g3c5rk,1587172094.0,I was a transfer at 18 years old as well and I am starting my PhD in the Fall! If you have any specific questions geel free to dm me!

berkeley,fnmgo9x,t1_fnmfsys,1587071094.0,Who is mainting the machines for the printing. Why are they spending hundreds of dollars on this maagazine asking for money when it could be directly used for donations. Still my point stands. Just because the writers are safe at home doesnt mean that everyone else is safe working from home. This adds strain on the postal system that is already experiencing difficulties. Its dumb overall. Im glad that people are working remotely but this is definitely not essential.

MechanicalEngineering,fn3wsqy,t3_fyr1gg,1586629456.0,"I had an interview last month with a very well known chip maker and when I told them I had 3 axis cnc machine experience they were extremely delighted. Just graduated last year with a BS in Mech E and while shop experience wont help in school as much other than project courses, it will definitely be a huge plus on a resume."

blackmagicfuckery,fmb77r3,t1_fmakhuw,1585920119.0,They are most likely gimbal brushless motors with decent position feedback control. maintaining the proper rpm with position feedback is essential to creating a display like this. Also turning the motors by hand on  gimbal motors still help to give a starting boost. It would just take too long for them to rotate up to speed on their own. Like another user said the blades of LEDs probably have a decent ammount of weight.
