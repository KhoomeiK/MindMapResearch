UCSD,fpm5nb2,t3_ge8bob,1588726065.0,"I 'm pretty sure that as long as you take 36 units for the school year, you should be fine. Check with fin aid though just to be 100% sure"
UCSD,fphkp5f,t1_fpgrr5c,1588622977.0,"Yeah, Gary is tough, I took 12 with Politz and loved it. So it is a teacher-dependent experience"
UCSD,fpe1gr8,t3_gcxq7f,1588538469.0,"I'm not sure how much you got removed, but the school did say that if you moved home, you would see a reduction in your financial aid"
UCSD,fpcgqj0,t3_gclqca,1588500015.0,"CSE 12 isn't bad here. I had a great time in the class. Like most classes, I'm pretty sure it depends on who you take 12 with"
UCSD,fpamnj4,t3_gca8z7,1588451310.0,"""I was told I wouldnâ€™t pay for this quarter if I left campus."" This only applied to housing on campus. The school doesn't become free because you went home. Also, fin aid gets reduced if you live at home. Make sure you met all your deadlines were met(if you registered for classes this quarter). If you truly think you were overcharged, dispute it with the link that someone else commented."
UCSD,fp19f0i,t1_fp0ysdv,1588228256.0,I took 8 units in session 1 and didn't do session 2
UCSD,fp19dt8,t1_fp0yily,1588228227.0,"I took 8 units, both in session 1"
UCSD,fp0xe4p,t3_galunt,1588219087.0,"The school will be providing summer housing, and I believe you need to apply for housing on the summer housing portal (idk when it opens). You should be able to live on campus, given that there will most likely be small demand for summer housing

For fin aid, I also get max amount and last year I got $2k from the school and $1k in Pell, but idk if that will change given everything going on."
UCSD,fp0x48e,t1_fozsafn,1588218904.0,"I mean, we have P/NP too, and we have until week 10 to do it lol"
UCSD,fozwnhe,t3_gai7lp,1588198185.0,"Best suggestion: submit that question on the VAC(Virtual Advising Center)

My input(may/may not be accurate):  If I am not mistaken, you should be fine as long as you meet the 36 units/year minimum to be a full-time student for fin aid"
UCSD,fotif1m,t3_g9fqxo,1588054884.0,"Basically- on the fence between in-person & online, maybe larger classes online while others are in person. If this thing going on doesn't go away, then completely online. And for housing- no triple room, so singles and doubles only"
UCSD,fop5br2,t3_g8pbb5,1587953412.0,"Did SPIS 2 years ago, 100% worth it, CSE students, apply!"
UCSD,fogv3hk,t3_g74t2u,1587757305.0,"Yes, I'm here for CS. I was on the shy side and coming here really got me to come out of my shell and be more social. I have met plenty of amazing and wonderful people, and you can run into plenty of great opportunities here that I love"

UCSD,fnxqzrz,t1_fnx2ila,1587344519.0,"Since the OP is an incoming freshman, they won't need to worry about 1st/2nd pass for fall quarter since they enroll in all their classes in late Aug. or early Sept."

UCSD,fmmqc5q,t3_fw6cr1,1586210059.0,"I try to have make a routine. I try to sleep/wake up at a consistent time, and I go to live lectures. For me, changing to my regular clothes instead of staying in pjs puts me in ""work mode"" and helps me stay focused"
