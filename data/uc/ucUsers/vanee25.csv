ucla,fosg58u,t3_g9b5fc,1588030055.0,That's normal usually when they disperse the money it takes a couple of days depending on your bank.
ucla,fo7ddqz,t1_fo5d1qt,1587576421.0,"Yes, I believe it's due on the 30 of this month"
ucla,fo493vc,t3_g5mhv5,1587500313.0,I'm in 23L right now and everything is online and due on sunday by 5pm. So far the 3 hour lab just got completely cut out and is now just office hours with your ta. You basically can finish the assignments on your own time as long as they're submitted by 5pm Sunday.  I think I wouldve preferred the in person lab but I actually dont mind the set up right now.
ucla,fnyawhg,t1_fnyaq83,1587357860.0,"Tuition charges both sessions at the same time, like you're billed for both as if it were a single quarter. They charge you based on the units you take not the session you take them in"
ucla,fnxqv7z,t3_g4iotr,1587344440.0,"My efc is also 0, I took summer classes last year (9units) and I only paid 200 out of pocket. Towards the end of session c I was reimbursed the 200 for some reason, so it was basically all covered."
ucla,fnit4nv,t3_g20tfc,1586985904.0,I also enrolled a while ago and my class doesnt say online? Maybe they're taking precaution but I wouldn't be surprised if it were online.
ucla,fnemy7l,t3_g13a8f,1586892234.0,"I dont think you're parents will find out, I think right now you're just on academic probation. I've had to friends in this situation and my only advice is to literally take the easiest classes you possibly can. If you're not done with your GE's take 2 super easy GE's and maybe a major course if you feel up to it. Don't overwhelm yourself, a lot of people have been in this situation and have turned things around"
ucla,fn97drm,t1_fn94sj8,1586762030.0,"I was taking 9, but I know that the max for aid is 12 units, so I think you should still be fine."
ucla,fn92lrb,t3_g0ca2i,1586757350.0,"As someone who also has an efc of 0, I took summer last year and financial aid pretty much covered the whole thing. I had to put maybe 200? But towards the end of session C financial aid redid my financial aid award for some reason and I was refunded what I put out of pocket. You do have to actually sign up for classes first though, the summer financial aid applications is really short like it literally takes 2 minutes, but you do have to put the amount of units you're taking during each session."
ucla,fn91ozq,t3_g0cr7w,1586756538.0,Maybe another housing refund like they did this quarter?
ucla,fn9108b,t3_g090xl,1586755924.0,"I recieved my housing refund a couple weeks ago. I canceled my housing contract on march 15 and recieved my refund in my bank account by march 24. What I havent recieved is my refund for winter since I cancelled it before the end of winter quarter, that is still on bruinbill as a negative balance. I'm sure you'll receive it soon, I think alot of people who cancelled later 
 have a delay in their refunds due to the high number of students who moved out during that time."
ucla,fn880bk,t3_g0599b,1586735859.0,"I took 14b with him last spring, and I never found his lectures super helpful. Not sure if hes changed a lot from last year but if you literally go through his slides and understand the practice problems and the concepts he emphasizes on the slides you should be fine. In my experience he would take some of the practice problems from the slides and put them on the midterms. In my opinion scerri was a very fair professor, I had a horrible 14a experience and his class was honestly 10x better than my 14a professors."
ucla,fn7ye05,t3_g02zrj,1586730128.0,"Bless your heart this post reminded me to fill out the finacial aid application for the summee, my heart dropped thinking it was due already!"
ucla,fmxcf9p,t3_fxyv70,1586462414.0,"It's probably just a notice for everyone as a reminder, I dont think its directed to you specifically if you have no outstanding balancing then you should be fine"
ucla,fmvjn9a,t3_fxmgww,1586419372.0,You could try having zoom on your phone and then the other class on your computer? I'm not sure if ccle would prevent this but I dont see why it wouldn't work?
ucla,fmocliu,t3_fwcxt6,1586253958.0,"Unpopular opinion: no, I really really don't, this was my 3rd year on the hill and I was so tired of the food. The only thing I miss are the iced mocha lattes from bcafe ):"
YAlit,fmjwmrl,t1_fmhnta0,1586139217.0,"Haha I actually found it, it's called ignite by desni dantone. I love the covenant series and it is similar but they're very different! Thank you though! (:"
