But Dr. George Rutherford, a researcher whose main interests are epidemiology and prevention of infectious and tropical diseases of public health importance, disagrees with that saying that the mortality rate of COVID-19 could end up being 30 times worse than the flu. 

Quarantines are for people or groups who don’t have symptoms but were exposed to the sickness. A quarantine keeps them away from others so they don’t unknowingly infect anyone.

So two local urgent care doctors vs epidemiological community? Yeah I'd rather trust the latter."

But we do have peer mentoring, senior design projects, research as well. It's just not a ""program"" and completely voluntary. Resources are available, and you just gotta take it if you need it. 

Not sure what kind of government research you're into, but you can totally do research that will help you get a government job like energy, defense, transportation, etc. I know a handful of people who interned for governments (City of LA, Santa Ana, or even US army)."

UCI,fmsyc74,t3_fx58pf,1586363916.0,"Hey OP, I can relate. I don’t have my own room (my family just sleeps in the same room), desk, chair, anything. 

I think your study environment is really important though. Looks like your only choice is kitchen table, and I know you said you can’t do it but... if that’s your only desk, honestly you gotta make it work. 

Clean everything and bring only what you need when you study. and TURN OFF your phone and put it somewhere else. Use StayFocusd to block distractions. And just do ONE practice problem at a time. 

Another thing you can do is changing your courses to P/NP. And if you have good health insurance, you can see a therapist too (yes it’s a legitimate reason to see a therapist). If you have UCSHIP, Acacia Irvine does remote therapy sessions. 

Good luck my friend! And remember “This too shall pass”. Don’t lose hope."
