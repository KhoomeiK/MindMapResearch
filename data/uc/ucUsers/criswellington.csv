neuro,fpan8fz,t1_fpaml4s,1588451656.0,"Oops, you're right if they were agonists it would cause a similar effect as dopamine binding. Non-specific dopamine uptake inhibitors! Thanks for enforcing my knowledge ðŸ˜Š"
neuro,fpalscx,t1_fpa9c2m,1588450798.0,"Is this correct? I know for methamphetamine and cocaine they are nonspecific inhibitors of dopamine receptors (blocking dopamine from being reabsorbed), dopamine builds up in cleft, to clear dopamine the brain upregulates the amount of dopamine receptors. With increased receptors for uptake you need more drug to get the same effect. Relative to this state, ""without the drug"" dopamine levels are more quickly removed due to the upregulation of dopamine receptors, resulting in the feeling of needing more of what gives you dopamine. 

But I agree with everything else! Sometimes I like to reduce my body to the cellular level. It feels like cravings and withdrawals but it is your body returning to homeostasis. I believe you'll be able to kick it! It definitely gets easier with every attempt ðŸ˜Š

Edit: nonspecific inhibitors used to say ""agonists"""

neuroscience,fp393bb,t1_fozoljy,1588275225.0,"The clubs I'm referring to are student-organized, not created by the program. I'm not very aware of education outside the U.S., but I'm guessing there are student-run organizations? Like student government? Often you can go to a schools website, look at Student Life, and they list active clubs ran by students.

I actually founded my club and am our first president! I was disappointed when I came to Uni and the neuro clubs weren't as involved as I liked, so I made my own haha."
neuroscience,fp38p1b,t1_foznuj2,1588275026.0,"Neuralink is using robots to thread microelectrodes into rats brains, with the intention to one day use it on people. The engineering is good, but it's not revolutionary since the techniques have been used in labs for awhile now. People have created brain networks (brain internet) between mice to see if one mouse being connected to another would change memory or behavior. It is very cool stuff with very ambitious application, but you'd be able to have access to that type of tech and studies in a graduate program. 

Credit where it's due, Neuralink is very cool, but ultimately they rely on the ground-breaking tech that comes out of publicly (or privately) funded labs. What you'd work with at Neuralink would be filtered through academia first (so it wouldn't really be new), which is why I personally prefer academia to industry."
neuroscience,fozm4x4,t1_fozkyw1,1588192965.0,"Here I go again, replying to myself!   


Also, another way to get involved in neuroscience development is joining clubs as an undergraduate. I am a part of a Huntington's Disease (HD) awareness and advocacy club. I get to go to neurodegenerative disorder symposiums and work closely with some of the pioneers for neurodegenerative  treatments. I greatly value this experience as well because it reminds me that what I study in the lab and classroom are someone else's reality. Its one thing to study a neurodegenerative disease, its another thing to see people affected, the care givers affects, the people who abandon treatment and care in third world countries due to the shame of having Huntington's. It's heartbreaking. It also makes me so incredibly motivated to contribute to my field however I can, even if its just sharing resources for patients."
neuroscience,fozkyw1,t1_fozkbqr,1588192405.0,">h not very good education, leadership, freedom (specially in research) and just start my degree. There's one which offers genetics, which sounds cool to me. My question is, do you suggest just starting a degree and get my undergrad quick, or wait until getting into a university where I can actually develop my skills, research and learn to the fullest? Universities in my region really don't have any tracks in neuro of any kind, you may find a very limited amount of courses on the brain, but it's mostly limited to biology and brain connectivity, so if I get into one of those universities I would graduate knowing little to nothing about the brain. Alternatively, I could try getting into a university in Paraguay, doing a few courses and then transferring to Europe and building a good knowledge base, at least MUCH more related to Neuro compared to Paraguay/Argentina. On the other hand if I stay in Paraguay I could start a business or doing things which maybe not directly related to my academic goals, I'd acquire skills that could help me in a future combine with my neuroscience skills to make an impact.

>I do see myself in a lab, but just as much I see myself leading through private businesses, public organizations, working in politics or really anything that can change big amounts of people. I would like to work in a lab, but not in the traditional way. Most lab papers just end up being papers and don't go out to the real world. I want to discover things about human behavior and then implement that outside of science, not only 

Also, Lab work is often going into the real world! You're writing papers and publishing because thats how you get money for your experiments, but it is experimenting and learning novel things about the brain. Labs are where the magic happens! Also as a graduate student you'd be able to go to international conferences and see the breaking-developments everyone else in neuro is making. I honestly dont know of a lot of neuro-companies that are doing ""ground-breaking"" work. You mentioned Neuralink, but honestly that company is not doing anything revolutionary. Working in Neuroscience ""industry"" always seemed more like a desk job to me. Labs are where you're injecting, imaging, recording and analyzing behavior."
neuroscience,fozkbqr,t1_foz6uhd,1588192095.0,"I don't think the advice was to start your undergrad ASAP, more so to join a neuro-based lab as soon as you do enter university. It does sound like the route you're describing is PhD. I'm in the undergraduate program for Neurobiology and Behavior at University of California, Irvine, and am currently taking Honors Research Methods in Neurobiology, Advanced Neurobiology, Molecular Mechanisms of Learning, and I do research in a Neural Circuits lab. Even though it's a good program, I've learned the most from the research lab, which is treated like an extracurricular. Working in a research lab as an undergraduate (and having a good principle investigator) will give you the resources and skills to do what you've described in your original post, a lot of what I've learned in the classroom is ""core knowledge"" for neuroscience (understanding action potentials, understanding LTP, understanding neuron types, understanding human development) but since this is ""core knowledge"" its often out of date, simplified, or not applicable to the work force. Entering a lab as an undergraduate researcher helped me achieve my academic goals, gave me a taste of graduate school, allowed me to pursue my specific neuroscience interests, and allowed me to apply cutting-edge technology. Plus, I've now networked with multiple labs we collaborate with and have other labs interested in me as a graduate student!    


This being said, to save money I first went to Community College in California, its cheaper and I got the same education (college education is college education). Now, I have way more money saved up for graduate school to further pursue my neuroscience projects!  


Don't worry about going into the ""best"" neuroscience program abroad, especially since undergraduate is pretty basic knowledge, I'd try and go to a ""good"" one, get good scores, and take the utmost advantage of research opportunities. Some schools even give students grants to pursue their own research project! Then you have way more freedom for the work you want to contribute."

She's been with us since her Sophomore year of HS, after recommendation of her older sister who also joined the lab as a high school student. Research experience is out there!"
