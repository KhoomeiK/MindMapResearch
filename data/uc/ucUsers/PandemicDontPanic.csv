They're very different kinds of suck, but when it's that hot and dry it's genuinely a struggle to stay hydrated if you're doing anything physically exerting, because you're losing about 1-2 liters of water per hour in sweat. Tires you out like nothing else, and kills quite a few people that don't realize how quickly they're losing fluids (first hour or two of a hike feel fine if you're in decent shape, so by the time dehydration starts setting in, you're too far in to hike back if you don't have enough water)."

PoliticalCompassMemes,fodrx5t,t1_fodpo07,1587688987.0,"Thanks for the links. Worth mentioning that the US has been tending up in working hours since the 80s, but otherwise your claims seem accurate (and the US is an outlier in regards to working hours). I will say, I wish someone broke down stats by age bracket, because young people seem far more dissatisfied than older generations based on the Democratic primary elections, where old people overwhelmingly voted for 'a return to normal', while young people seem to be demanding far more radical action.

LVT seems like it would be an excellent solution to our current mess, but I'd be cautious about letting perfect be the enemy of good. I'm genuinely worried where four more years of status quo will get us, because an economic depression combined with existing dissatisfaction isn't exactly a recipe for stable government. A yellow vest-style protest in the US turning violent and armed, a populist demagogue (with more than two brain cells to rub together) taking power, or any number of other scenarios all seem increasingly likely. It's my biggest worry with Biden; I don't think he's going to change anything fundamentally, and we need fundamental change to bring back the people on the fringes."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fodo2ru,t1_fodhjf3,1587687068.0,"While I'm sure the internet has had some effect, I think the bigger factor has been widening inequality, both between the ultra-rich and everyone else, and also between white collar and blue collar workers. Friends that grew up middle class in the suburbs and went straight from high school to college seem mostly oblivious to the problems people less fortunate than them face, unless it's to make a point they already agree with (i.e. how expensive healthcare is). Every single one of them, though, 'just can't understand' why people voted for Trump outside of bigotry or stupidity. It's telling.

Conversely, my friends that didn't grow up middle class, didn't go to college, and are just trying to get feel increasingly like they've been left behind, like the game is rigged, etc. My best friend's brother was a staunch libertarian since highschool, but despite working harder than any other human being I know, is still struggling to get by eight years after graduating high school. He can't afford to treat his auto-immune disease, and his girlfriend can't even afford an EpiPen for her bee allergy. Somewhat unsurprisingly, he's no longer the staunch libertarian that believes successful people earned everything they have, and I've noticed a similar trend with all of my blue collar friends; they're working their asses off to barely get by, and yet the talking heads keep saying things have never been better. Their dissatisfaction with the status quo is entirely understandable.

TrueOffMyChest,fo0c0oi,t1_fnza6pn,1587410011.0,"I have a lot of sympathy for those struggling financially right now, but trust me, lockdown is better for nearly everyone, even for those unlikely to die if they contract it. Even at a 1% case fatality rate, we're still looking at *millions* of Americans dead if we reopened everything, and case fatality rate isn't a static number. Currently it assumes you receive proper medical treatment, but you can only receive proper care if the hospitals aren't overwhelmed. In an ""everything is open"" scenario, hospitals will be overwhelmed, meaning COVID patients don't get ventilators, O2 masks, etc., and non-COVID patients don't get the care they need (if they get care at all). That means cancer patients, crash victims, heart attack/stroke victims and so on, are much more likely to die or be left permanently disabled than they would be otherwise. Worth noting as well that COVID patients who recover are often left with permanent, severe lung damage, undoubtedly leading to further complications down the road. Additionally, such a monumental loss of life, severe damage to our medical system, and public avoidance of restaurants, movie theaters, travel, etc. would likely lead to an economic recession anyways, just slightly delayed. 

Again, I really feel for those struggling right now. They should absolutely be taking priority over corporations, and we desperately need to reform our society to work better for everyone (esp. those at the bottom), but reopening the economy won't help anyone in the long run, and it stands to hurt a tremendous amount of people. We've made our bed with years of complacency and inaction, and now we must lie in it."
todayilearned,fnqohzf,t1_fnq3teo,1587168772.0,"Interesting to hear! I'm not very familiar opioids, but that makes sense from what little I know (namely, that they're pretty good with helping manage pain). Proper dosage is a big part of why I advocate for legalization, as it's a lot easier to dose correctly if you can get clean drugs in finely measured quantities, and a lot of people that end up addicted to drugs start because they were self-medicating legitimate problems. Again, very little experience with opioids, so I don't know if legalization is the right course there, but giving users a safer, legal alternative they can use to address their problems in a healthier manner seems like a no-brainer for a lot of illicit drugs."
todayilearned,fnq1el4,t1_fnpzlsd,1587155851.0,"Dosage is something people don't seem to understand about drugs. I don't blame them, it's easy to see a tweaker and think that using amphetamines at all would just push you closer to that and dosage only effects how close you get to full tweaker, but it's set the conversation on drugs back so far. My go-to for explaining dosage, though, is alcohol; at very low doses (i.e. a beer or less for most people), it can act as a performance enhancer in sports like competitive shooting because it relaxes the muscles and calms the person down without impairing their fine motor skills. Even recreationally, correct dosage can mean the difference between being sociable and charming or being 'that guy' who's obnoxiously drunk and kills the mood."
UCI,fnpx5k8,t1_fnoq2sz,1587153609.0,">You don’t even know how much money they got, they could’ve taken a lost.

Yeah, that's kind of the point of free enterprise. If a company can't survive, then it doesn't. It's not as if the apartments they own would disappear without the company existing, they'd just get bought by either the university or a different company if ACC folded or liquidated assets to stay afloat. 

Plenty of businesses will be shutting their doors in the next few months, not sure why ACC was so special.


>It would make no sense for ACC to break thousands of leases and not get some type of compensation.

""If you owe the bank $100 that's your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem.""

In this case, the UCI students had a lot more power over ACC than ACC had over them. If everyone that moved out just stopped paying rent, ACC would have been effectively powerless to stop them, and would have probably ended up cutting a deal with those students to cancel the lease for some amount of money so as not to get completely shafted."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fnpte8u,t1_fnp6xbz,1587151659.0,"People are complicated, so trying to give a definitive answer isn't really possible, but I'll give it a shot. Average age on this sub skews pretty young by the feel of it, so a lot of the guys on here only have experience with women still figuring out what they want in a relationship. Society can also be kinda weird about female sexuality (and sexuality in general), and so some women don't feel comfortable expressing what they feel and instead express more socially acceptable wants and desires. It can also be the case that a guy has some qualities that a woman likes, but after dating him for a while she finds that he has other qualities she can't stand and breaks up. Good chance a guy gets out of that relationship thinking thinking he was what she said she wanted, but since things ended, she must have not known what she was talking about.

Reversing the genders, it's not hard to see that goes the other way too. Most guys without any experience would say they want to date a woman with a high libido, but most of them don't have any experience dating a partner with a higher libido, and may find that in reality they don't want a woman with a higher libido, but with a matching libido. If a guy enjoys being more submissive in bed, but feels uncomfortable expressing that and just says he's pretty vanilla instead, he might end up sexually unsatisfied despite getting everything he said he wanted. And, to the last point, it's really not hard to imagine a woman who fits with most of what guy wants, but still wouldn't be a good fit (i.e. guy's a neat-freak, woman's a slob, etc.).

Personally, I would advise everyone to just ignore what other people say they want in a partner and just focus on being their best selves. Self-confidence is almost always attractive to a partner, and living true to yourself means you're a lot more likely to find someone that appreciates you for who you are."

The fact that mass shootings (which account for <1% of gun deaths overall, but scare rich suburbanites) are talked about more than any of the other causes is the cherry on top of this shit-cake.
