That paywall severely discourages new or newer players from playing ladder, and even outside of ladder, the game has been getting really stale."

ClashRoyale,fovsz8i,t1_fovs9aj,1588106993.0,"I definitely agree that f2p players are in a better place now than a few years back (lol back then the f2p economy was a complete and utter joke, e.g. trade tokens didn't even exist, even getting a max epic was nearly impossible). However, this game evolves, and thus I think SC should evolve as well and improve the playing experience further for f2p's."
ucla,fovpo1y,t1_fovhvo7,1588105367.0,"A lot of people who are opposed to CUB aren't actually opposed to the creation of a Black Resource Center; they're opposed to the lack of transparency of USAC and how they have no idea where their funds are even going.

Secondly, even if someone were to oppose the creation of a Black Resource Center entirely, that doesn't mean necessarily that they're racist. They could be misinformed, not well informed enough, or might simply believe that it's not necessary without being racist."
ClashRoyale,fovk8bm,t3_g9rwiz,1588102723.0,"I think there are a couple reasons why this may be the case.

1. The game has increasingly become more rock-paper-scissors to the point that a significant factor in determining who wins a match is the matchup itself (ESPECIALLY in the competitive community). The addition of more and more cards, some of which are made specifically to counter other cards, worsens this trend. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how to fully fix this -- any thoughts are appreciated. (As a bonus, competitive players aren't necessarily feeling any better -- golem in the back is actually viable rn, and there are lower-skill sparky rage / egolem healer decks in the meta, etc.,)
2. There continues to be a huge paywall in this game. In many ways I'd argue this is even worse than the RPS meta issue (despite me being rather competitively oriented and pushing ranked ladder routinely). The reason you see so many of the same decks on non-ranked ladder is because it is far too hard to level up a large number of cards -- not only do chests, quests, etc. not give enough cards imo, but there is not nearly enough gold to upgrade them anyway even if you get all the cards. (As a bonus, the gem economy flatout sucks rn.) As a result, many f2p players will run common f2p decks like 2.6 and 2.9, for example, but basically anyone who isn't blowing $$$ into the game is going to have a pick one deck and stick with it -- and it tends to be a deck that is well known or has decent longevity (e.g. pekka bridge spam, golem nw)."

ucla,fnic1lc,t1_fnib71j,1586977453.0,Indeed; that's just how it is lol sorry

ucla,fn5h026,t3_fzpo51,1586664624.0,"Would you mind sharing some examples of the ""blatant racism on this campus""? As a person of color, I've been around campus a lot and my experiences certainly do not support that claim.

Furthermore, the \[implicit\] argument that anyone who is opposed to paying $15/quarter more to an organization is racist/selfish is absurd. I'm a transfer student and a person of color, and I have yet to find good enough evidence that will swing me over to supporting this fee (although I'm open to being changed); does that mean that I don't care about other transfers and students of color (and other minority groups)? I promise you, arguing by identity politics, while being the norm in social media, etc. these days, is not intelligent at all and won't bode well for you in the long run."
