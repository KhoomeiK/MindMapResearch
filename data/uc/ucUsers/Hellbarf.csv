I don't trust the five minute stuff if I want a good time!"
bathandbodyworks,fp1fogr,t1_fopnflu,1588233943.0,I joined about five facebook groups to figure out if I would like the scent or not back when none of the products had any reviews! So thanks for taking the plunge and ordering this one.
boba,fotftyj,t1_fosj25u,1588052695.0,"I suggested syrup websites as a primary point of inspiration! 
Never heard of a boba press but I thought checking out the syrup offerings would be great to inspire you with."
boba,fos9gjz,t3_g7q66y,1588026399.0,"Have you heard of OneZo and TeaMaru in Southern California? These shops both make their boba in-house and with a variety of flavors. Besides the classic black boba wallowing in simple syrup, they have best selling brown sugar, taro, chrysanthemum, black sesame, orange, strawberry, mango, sweet potato, honey, and caramel.  
Honestly, you can just hit up any major retailer of syrups online and check out the options they have for whatever flavors you feel like. Boba will soak up anything you throw at it."
boba,fos7h83,t1_fos721s,1588025358.0,"What about it didn't taste right? I personally hate almond milk in my boba drinks, homemade or store bought, because with the ice the drink gets watered down awfully. You might want to try an alternative milk creamer instead of almond milk! I prefer thick oat and high calorie soy milk. If you insist on almond milk, make it almond creamer or the highest-calorie version of milk available. My tears are thicker than 70 calorie almond milk.   
You can also try brewing the tea base with double the amount of tea."
boba,fos5evi,t3_g991fs,1588024294.0,"First of all, could you please list the thing you attempted? Like what stuff did you use, what steps you took? I think that could be really helpful."
boba,forfpkg,t3_g8lfw9,1588011448.0,"Ohhh, these are gorgeous!"
berkeley,fo5h0v0,t1_fo52x8n,1587525436.0,"Hey, what anime and/or martial arts do you like?  
I also dig the Bruce Lee quote you chose for your name."
berkeley,fo5gtwt,t1_fo4975k,1587525305.0,"Ohh, Occidental is beautiful. I've checked the campus out when my family was looking for a home in nearby Highland Park.  
Also hi from an English major! Classes here are great and so far have contributed to actual improvement!"
berkeley,fo5gh0e,t1_fo3v1yf,1587525064.0,"Hello, fellow pineapple on pizza lover!!  
What do you think about corn and zucchini pizza though?"
berkeley,fo5gaa1,t1_fo4k46m,1587524933.0,"I love shounen but I have kinda shit taste in other genres. Of course Kimetsu's great for its handling by the animation studio! I'm a fan of Sailor Moon, myself, but I grew up watching DBZ on Mexican cable. I think I've seen all of My Hero Academia. I love this one shounen show that nobody ever really talks about called BTOOOM!. It's a battle royale type of plot.  
For cerebral shows, I dig, dig, DIG Serial Experiments Lain and Shinsekai Yori (Tales from the New World). On my to watch list for this genre are Ergo Proxy and Ghost in the Shell.For standalone films, I recommend watching Angel's Egg, released way back in freaking 1985 or something. Made by the same guy who did Ghost in the Shell, but at a time in his life where he was questioning his faith. It led to this beautiful result, an eerie, gothic, arthouse-y film with a beautifully depicted set of characters on par with like Tim Burton designs, and drenched in heavy religious symbolism that might not go anywhere depending on how you interpret it. You gotta watch this one in a dark room. It's available for free on Youtube.A fun one you gotta watch while you're still in colleege is Tatami Galaxy! It's probably not for everyone, though, just because the writing and direction is a little off the beaten path compared to more easily digestible shounen.

And what makes my taste so bad is that I unashamedly love stupid brainless ecchi shit like Rosario Vampire and Monster Musume. Both feature bland male leads who get all these monster girls after them. I think Chobits kinda falls into the ecchi category, cuz it's got weird fanservicey scenes, but it's got other stuff going on for it, too. I just think the art is so beautiful."
berkeley,fo5f93a,t1_fo3zlpn,1587524222.0,YOOO Isn't Ari Aster so freaking good at horror? I loved Hereditary and still need to see Midsommar. The Conjuring fucked my shit up... I was the first to enter this blood-red AMC theater room and never felt safe the entire time I saw it. Can't forget those clapping hands!
berkeley,fo41dre,t1_fo3vmyd,1587496527.0,"So is Helsing one of your favorite anime shows, going off your name?"
boba,fntcswm,t3_g3t9gn,1587239080.0,"My old boba shop used Torani, Mon√≠n, and RedSun brand syrups for gourmand and fruity/floral flavors. Our fruit tea used passionfruit syrup from Monin and it worked well with the actual fruits we put into it."

AsianBeauty,fmy4lnt,t1_fmx98w1,1586478002.0,"I love Jigott! I have a few on retainer and have been exclusively using the whitening one (with no actual whitening thankfully) for regular daily exposure. This other version should also treat you well, with no problems lying under makeup. I still haven't gotten around to trying the snail version."
AskReddit,fmvdfdg,t1_fmv7hdq,1586413206.0,"That's so sad honestly. If I were in her shoes I'd laugh, too. Ridiculous circumstances."
AskReddit,fmvdc1v,t1_fmv5fjn,1586413121.0,"Fuck, I definitely remember seeing some of this shit happen in my middle school in Southeast LA. What pisses me off the most is the disgusting pedophile creeps who were impregnating my classmates because they were vulnerable and financially strained. I think it's gotten a little better but the societal problems remain."
berkeley,fmsbinh,t3_fwua3b,1586351821.0,"I like to play Pokemon Go during Coronavirus off-season and water houseplants, or loiter in boba shops and draw. Other people like to surf, dedicate their life to their awesome club, volunteer at the ASPCA, party, or start fights in front of pizza places at 2am. It's all up to what kind of person you are, but Berkeley is big enough and SF is close enough that all your needs can be met. You just have to be the proactive one!"
berkeley,fmsawzd,t1_fms13f3,1586351401.0,"depends, can a single small person make off with any of these items with little struggle? Many people would be interested in doing the work for you on the Facebook page mentioned!"
popping,fmkkgs2,t3_fvigzy,1586158068.0,"Was hoping someone would have the track used listed somewhere, but haven't had luck. It sounds nice - like Southern gothic stuff."
