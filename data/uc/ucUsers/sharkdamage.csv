Sometimes it doesn't hurt to try it out and I know I have a tendency to rule things like that out and never even attempt it."

A windows computer will probably be the cheapest option. Just don't get a chromebook at all, they can be great for older people but not for students.

ALTERNATIVELY: I used to be a PC guy all my life and then I had decided to buy a new laptop. I was about to make my purchase when I noticed a used macbook air on Amazon from a seller with good reviews and it was listed for $600. I was going to slap Linux onto it and call it a day. But then I got lazy and it worked fine for me for...8 years. I bought it in 2012 and I am still using it to type this message out right now. Please do be aware that buying used computers can be risky but sometimes it can really pay off. If you use an iphone, airdrop makes passing documents or recordings between your devices really easy.

The reason I mentioned that it depends on how much you know about computers is that if you need to use programs that are windows only, you'll have to use bootcamp or something like that. 

Good luck! Good job on getting in!"

There are very few distractions around that time, especially from friends and family. Definitely go to bed early to get enough sleep though, can sometimes be hard with parents but at least it's easier with friends and quarantine? Give it a shot, if not we can figure something else out."

I remember he was teaching us Bayesian analysis and he told us that he does each problem, computes the results of common mistakes and puts those in as answers on the multiple-choice questions. 

It's probably a much boring class for you guys since you guys have to take Bio 5A and its not human genetics (which was actually really really cool) but the general concepts should be the same. You can't totally just memorize facts as answers but think of them as tools that you can use to figure out the answers to his questions. 

That being said his exams were fucking BONKERS hard, the practice midterms are helpful to study but won't give you any indication of what the actual exam will be like. But the curve was generous and I think it made me a much much better student for all of the classes that I took after that quarter. You can do this."

Finding a spot in a house for rent is much cheaper and more ideal. You can message me for more details if you need them."
