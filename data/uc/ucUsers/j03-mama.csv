UCSantaBarbara,foxcf8w,t1_fox2nol,1588139837.0,i found them a bit harder bc he puts the whole thing in symbols/variable and i wasn’t used to working through the problems like that. idk if he gives u guys worksheets but some concepts on the test are similar to those too
UCSantaBarbara,fownqzv,t3_g9zkza,1588123442.0,service gets really weird at the beach/dp but that might be for everyone
UCSantaBarbara,fov10io,t3_g9i2wj,1588093634.0,he doesn’t have practice exams :/ but doing the hw problems he gives u and also the textbook problems helps get most of the concepts down
UCSantaBarbara,fotjno2,t3_g96dgd,1588055984.0,plus we can’t really tell what we got wrong on the lab reports so it’s harder to improve :/

UCSantaBarbara,fmtfxx3,t3_fx2cw8,1586372047.0,"i went random and i never actually hung out with either of my roommates. try to fill out your preferences as accurate as you can though so that your habits/lifestyle matches up with your roommates. 

our ra was really nice and organized a lot of floor events for us after move in and during week zero. everyone is in the same boat as you and wants to make friends so don’t worry! you’ll have to step out of your comfort zone a bit but that’s life. my advice is get to know the people on your floor and talk to the people next to you in your classes. also, most of the freshmen are super social during the first few weeks and everyone’s constantly exchanging names but after that it kind of dies down after they find their groups"
UCSantaBarbara,fmj9voi,t3_fvi4k0,1586125989.0,i just wrote down all the formulas for moments of inertia and refer to them when i do problems. hoping that he doesn’t make us actually derive it on a test hahaha. and you’re definitely not the only one lost
