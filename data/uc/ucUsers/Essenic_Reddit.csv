The tuition question? Well, it’s like asking someone whether to pick heads or tails on a coin even though both are gonna give (hypothetically) the same chance. There is just enough reasons why tuition rates should go down to why tuition rates shouldn’t go down. So, please just stop asking the same question to the same demographic who probably doesn’t have enough individual power to do anything alone."

AskReddit,fnuwvxa,t1_fnuvwad,1587273283.0,"Personally, I’m not much of a talker. Usually don’t hit it off well and may be awkward. I don’t think asking a bunch of questions for the girl is the right thing for me because it makes me feel like a total creep. I don’t know if I should just immediately connect to a girl with an interest, then get comfortable with her and start acting more openly."
AskReddit,fnuwmvr,t1_fnuvxqp,1587273082.0,"I agree with you. I like the introvert lifestyle even though I was a super hyperactive child.

I feel like a mix of being alpha and beta is the best of both worlds, where you can get both perspectives.

On the side note, you seem like a very interesting guy with a lot of life experiences. Honestly, you seem wise and I respect that. Do you mind if I follow you and dm you once and a while about fun life things happen and bad ones too. Honestly it might be weird from someone of my age.
