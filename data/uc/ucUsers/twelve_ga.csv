berkeley,foxbdtd,t3_g9vxb0,1588138988.0,"I'm back home in Seoul, South Korea and I will say this: I generally have really strong feelings about digital privacy but I felt that the tracking system the health department used was really well put together and I had no complaints about giving full access to my location, etc. because I knew it was needed and it worked. If you're curious, here's a bit about my experience:

When I entered the country, I was put on a 2-week mandatory self-quarantine phase where I installed an app on my phone and they tracked me 24/7 to make sure that I wasn't leaving the house. Someone called me every day to check in on me and I got a care package with food, hand sanitizer, and masks whenever I needed them (this service might differ at a municipal level). After that, I got tested right away for free and got a negative result back.

What I think really helped was the fact that:

1. they release information about every single confirmed caseâ€“where the infected person has been, and at what time.
2. they keep an eye on all the different points of contact that may have resulted from the infected person's actions before the diagnosis.
3. They arrange for the infected person to be sent to a medical facility without contact with other people. **AND, the health department sanitizes every single place that the infected person has been, including their residence.**

I've spent quite a few years in the states now, long enough to call it home, and at times I even subconsciously pretend I'm just American. I feel disappointed and frustrated that many don't realize how they're not getting what they deserve in terms of basic healthcare. The antiquated system that is in place right now falls far behind the ""America #1"" image, to say the very least.

I know there's not much I can do about it personally, and ""technically it's none of my business"". Still, I find myself constantly thinking about potential solutions to these problems... and the sheer size of the clusterfuck just stumps me sometimes.

All I can say for now is that you need to actively protect yourself and seek the most trustworthy data you can find. The government isn't there to protect you, it seems. Best of luck to all you strong people and I know we can make it through this mess. Thanks Nick for the wonderful and informative post.

bikewrench,fomriab,t1_fomnp53,1587901264.0,Gotcha. Thanks for the noob friendly explanation.
bikewrench,fomnl56,t1_fomnj84,1587896919.0,Gotcha. Didn't read between the lines there
bikewrench,fomngva,t1_fomne6w,1587896786.0,I see. Although at this price point I don't expect free truing because I think they charged like 25 for it some time back. Thanks for the advice.
bikewrench,fomnczd,t1_fomn2dh,1587896662.0,"Huh. That sounds a bit counterintuitive but I guess if I take good lines to allow for a higher ""speed threshold"" in the corners that would be possible."
bikewrench,fomk00r,t1_fomjmo2,1587892897.0,"If you're asking if I brake on and off for 2-3 second intervals, yes--I am a cheapskate and for whatever reason doing that makes me feel like I'm not burning through my pads.

As for my athletic performance... you're right. It is a different problem and I will address it ""some other time"" as usual. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
bikewrench,fomg7b9,t1_fomg24c,1587888855.0,Quality is a bit more a concern for me cause I'm on a rim brake road bike. I don't have a lot of dough to work with (classic college student budget) but I do want to make sure that can descend without dying because there are decently big hills here in the East Bay.

bikewrench,fomen3j,t1_fomd8vy,1587887262.0,Thanks for the advice. What's a good price to be paying on a budget but dependable set of hoops? I was thinking of something from lightbicycle or a similar supplier
