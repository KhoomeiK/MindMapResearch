UCSD,fomad8o,t3_g88t5k,1587883150.0,"Hey, honestly its pretty good to have that self-awareness, though. It usually gets worse for me the more something fails to work in my homeworks. Big sigh. 

Idk if you wanted to hear what works for me, but I found that for me, when I have so much resistance towards doing what I do, I have tiers of productivity techniques that I'll employ to get myself to do something a little more. Like if I start to really not be able to get off facebook, and this is kinda a reflex to alt tab, then I might try to start by adding a extension that blocks sites for half an hour at a time. Then I might try to start a pomodoro timer. Then I might try checklisting as a final resort, where each checkbox is SO SO granular!!! I find that as I struggle more, the more willing I am to do something so simple as a check list. It lowkey sounds cheesy, but at some point, I'll be willing to do whatever it takes. Cheers! Goodluck!"
UCSD,foltdj7,t3_g7ro69,1587870023.0,"Thank you for describing these times as strange rather than any more negative alternative. It really helps to acknowledge that things are off, but nothing that will be permanent. Cheers everyone!"

If you ever need someone to hang with and study, I'm running a covid19 charity stream to provide solidarity for those who felt displaced and unable to stay productive alone.  [https://www.twitch.tv/willystudies](https://www.twitch.tv/willystudies).
