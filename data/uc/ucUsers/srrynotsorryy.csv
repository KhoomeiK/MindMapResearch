MUAontheCheap,foz7mvx,t3_g9reca,1588186037.0,"dang my order got cancelled too! i guess that saves me some money, but it looks like the cost of shipping isnt getting refunded! wtf?"
swatchitforme,foofnoy,t1_foofcis,1587938105.0,yes! will you post swatches for the pastel box and the extra spicy palette? i can’t wait!
swatchitforme,fooe8kb,t1_foodfsr,1587937397.0,"thanks so much! i’ve actually been stalking that page of yours since i’ve been meaning to make a purchase, but most of the shades i wanted sold out :( the pastel box looks perfect, since pastels are all i wear! i’m curious as to how their pastel foils will look, especially since i’ve heard their foils are a thicker, more metallic formula. when i think of pastel shimmers, i think of something like the devinah xploders, sheerer and more shimmery."
swatchitforme,foo9y02,t1_foo8xi8,1587935299.0,"i’m going to try to get it too! i’ve never gotten anything from them, and this looks like the perfect way to break into the brand! i have no idea how fast their mystery boxes will sell out though, since i’ve never tried anything from gmg, so i’m scared it’ll sell out so fast. good luck to us both!! praying we can both snatch it up!"
swatchitforme,foo3t8l,t1_fonrlqg,1587931951.0,"that’s so adorable!! this story made my day haha! also, i just have to ask, are you planning on getting the GMG pastel mystery box?"
swatchitforme,foo22kg,t3_g8l4rr,1587930975.0,"This is Nabla Cutie palette in Wildberry, and I swatched this on bare NC15 skin in natural lighting, layering only the shimmers twice. I’ve never tried Nabla so I’m excited to give this brand a go, and from first impression, Alchemy and Bucolic Baby are super sparkly and shimmery and have a rather sheer base. The mattes are super pigmented, and the one latex matte, Incense, reminds me of the cream to powder mattes Natasha Denona has, but a little more loose and therefore probably easier to blend. Very impressed so far!"

makeupexchange,fnrhzk7,t3_g39s8j,1587189534.0,would you be willing do you $10 shipped for nerds and verity?
swatchitforme,fn5cvwv,t1_fn5aj2u,1586661587.0,"yess! the mattes are just amazing! they are so opaque and pigmented! the shimmers are beautiful too! so smooth, and the shine is so elegant! the teal is a breathtaking color, and it works so well with the green! i’m loving this so far, and i think this palette would not only work so well for summer, but also for fall!"
swatchitforme,fn57svy,t3_fzo598,1586657999.0,"This is the Sugarpill C2 palette, and I swatched it on dry NC15 skin in natural lighting. The only shade I went over twice was the blue/teal one, and only because it was very crumbly. I have the pink C1 on as well, and out of the two, I like the orange one more! Surprisingly so, because I am a pastel whore and rarely use neutrals! This is probably the only neutral palette I’ll use, and I am overall very happy and impressed with it so far!"
swatchitforme,fn0uz1p,t1_fn0djpi,1586549251.0,yes! i’m such a big fan of your ig!
swatchitforme,fmyy13v,t1_fmysm1x,1586499381.0,"yep! i have crossroads and moonlite, but i don’t have sweet spot! i can send u a comparison if you’d still like though!"
swatchitforme,fmy4lkh,t1_fmy0vs5,1586478001.0,"don’t really love the formula, tbh! it’s really easy to blend, but the colors, mainly the pastels, don’t want to build and end up looking like nothing. the primary colors in the palette are great though, not counting the white, which is probably the worst white i’ve ever used. it’s similar in formula to the tokyo harajuku (very blendible and soft but refuses to build and more satiny than matte). i would recommend the pastel pup and creepy cute 100 times over the psyches box and tokyo harajuku! and if you’re looking at the fun size too, i wouldn’t really consider it to be a pastel palette(there are only 2, maybe 3 pastel shades)."
swatchitforme,fmxw3pe,t1_fmxvlte,1586473032.0,"sadly i didn’t get any of the pastel chameleons! now i’m kicking myself for not doing so, because i really want callisto and aurora! i’m totally getting those 2 and maybe wavelength when they come into stock!"
swatchitforme,fmxsq0z,t1_fmxqwif,1586471133.0,"yes! i like these the most simply because of the colors and how creamy the formula is! the cornflower blue is the most beautiful pastel blue i have, and unlike many other brands that put out “pastels”, these are true, true pastels! pastel pup and creepy cute are the best pastel palettes out of the ones i have, but i feel like singles are just so much more versatile!"
swatchitforme,fmxoi4v,t3_fy1ccm,1586468840.0,"This is the terra moons pastel matte bundle, and colors on the top row from left to right are daydream, lunar and later, utopia, palm reader, space walker, and twilight! the purple on bottom is libra. swatched on dry NC15 skin, natural lighting, no primer and i went over the initial swatch once to build it up. these are lovely, true pastels! i am a pastel fanatic, and i have the creepy cute from shroud, kvds pastel goth, the new menagerie pastel pup, nomads tokyo harajuku, the morphe 35i, claropsyche’s psyches box, and the sugar pill C1 capsule and funsize! i would say these are probably my favorite pastel shadows of the bunch, followed closely by the creepy cute! imo these shadows are very creamy and highly pigmented."
makeupexchange,fmlg9dd,t1_fmla3rt,1586185813.0,"yes, even cheaper than paypal!"
MUAontheCheap,fmdp2jh,t1_fmd88fs,1585973695.0,"just a warning, the nomad single shadows are not depotable! i asked them and they said they cannot remove the shadows from its compartment :( really annoying"
