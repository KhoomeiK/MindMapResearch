UCSC,fnjx4sw,t1_fnjs2fh,1587009092.0,Lmao quit being such a narc. If you “get blamed” you just go to the housing meeting and tell them you had no part of it. And oh look now you’re not in trouble. This is under the assumption you get blamed in the first place. Fucking relax boomer
UCSC,fnjwu79,t1_fniwaiq,1587008887.0,Yeah and the war on drugs started under Nixon in 1969. So boomers are the generation that grew up under the aggressive anti drug propaganda that has resulted in the entire country not being able to accept weed legalization. Boomers are absolutely freaked out about drug use.
UCSC,fnjwlxb,t1_fnjaji8,1587008729.0,"The pro isnt recruiters, the pro is reputation. The schools graduate research is funded by a lot of companies. One of my professors labs consistently gets grants from PayPal. If you’re trying to work in Silicon Valley, the interviewers are going to be intimately familiar with the schools program."
OldSchoolCool,fniwiqn,t1_fnipyai,1586987613.0,"Obviously I read it as you being dramatic, that’s why I said it. Care to provide something insightful?"
OldSchoolCool,fnipim7,t1_fnij72d,1586984077.0,"Regardless of what your opinion is, quit being so dramatic."
UCSC,fnidsfj,t1_fneq69m,1586978292.0,"I second this, get good with Python first. Learning programming is a very real skill, that involves a lot of time and practice. Once you’re comfortable with Python, then you can switch to one of the more applied AI languages (even of which Python is one, but there are others). 

And yeah please don’t waste your own time learning HTML, it won’t benefit you in the slightest."
UCSC,fnicp7c,t3_g1l1w3,1586977773.0,"If you’re freaked out and uncomfortable with casual drug use, don’t go to University. Feel free to not participate in casual drug use, nobody will judge you, but don’t act like a Boomer about it."
UCSC,fniciym,t1_fni1hwf,1586977688.0,"Don’t hate on the graduate students, quit being a bootlicker. They were in a fucked situation and decided to demonstrate for a better situation, AKA all of American History. Just because it’s current day doesn’t mean Civil Disobedience isn’t valid anymore."
UCSC,fnic42b,t3_g1tx5w,1586977486.0,"We’re the closest UC to Silicon Valley. School has a lot of fantastic professors, great classes, cutting edge research. I just finished my undergrad here and plan on starting my Masters here in CS this fall."
UCSC,fnibw01,t3_g1xmvr,1586977377.0,"Fuck the president, he isn’t responsible for the check, Congress is. He just cut funding to the World Health Organization today and you have the audacity to shout him out for something he deserves no credit for."
UCSC,fnibchp,t1_fni88it,1586977120.0,"In my time at UCSC, all proposed building areas are protested. Student housing west was supposed to be in Porter meadows, massive backlash. Then they moved it to where Family Student Housing is, massive backlash. Then they moved it to the fat open dry grass field below OPERS, massive backlash. Students want housing but they don’t want the University to build any, anywhere. And look I get it, like, living in the trees is my favorite part of UCSC, that’s why I’ve lived on campus for 3 years, but like we need to build some mf housing somewhere. I feel like a lot of students aren’t willing to compromise."
UCSC,f6xpzeg,t1_f6xgnp4,1573255327.0,"I agree with this person, you should apply OP if the school interests you."
