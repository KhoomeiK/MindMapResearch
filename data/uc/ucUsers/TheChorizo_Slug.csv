UCSC,fmr5zpm,t3_fwuze4,1586314676.0,"Yeah I thought the same too. Guess what homie it's the same for all UCs... in terms of difficulty. As a cs major we continuously share uci, ucm, ucb, ucsd, uc (whatevers uc you are at) work, slides, and ideas. So basically all the UCs share their material and data. In fact I had a friend transfer from UCSC to UCLA and quote on quote there was no difference*. I do believe that at a UC you work harder then a cc or state ( personally attending both). But quite frankly you get what you put in. However, im sure there are State students who are way smarter then alot of our UC students. I just think it's what you make out of it. Example my homie is a 3.7 gpa UCSC student, but takes the easiest professors, cheats, slacks, and is a senior but yet he will graduate with a BS. The irony is that he still cant code or doesnt know the theory so he has friends who pushed him through. Go to CC and transfer to a UC of your choice, save yourself money. Remember its what you learn and how you can make yourself marketable to an employer."

As a transfer I preferred living off campus. I got here at the age of 28 for CS.. even if your like 25 you will feel older then alot of people. But the con is you wont make that many friends. Plus I did alot of dorm, woods, and random ass parties when I lived on campus along with alot of hookups ( like clockwork its just a fuckfest if you shoot your shot). Plus drugs* . Take it from me stay on top of your classes and know when to fold. I went from a 1.5 merely getting kicked out every quarter to a 3.7 gpa currently (cumulative 3.5). Downside is that my 1st year I was always high and fucking around (fuckboy) because you can have alot of fun here. Thus, in order to graduate in time I'm going to miss out on Functional Programming, Operating Systems, and CSE 102 and go down to a CS BA. Upset cuz I did the maths.. ya know CSE 107 and Vector calc ( calc 3) ain't no joke. Friends say to stay but eh, it doesnt really matter at the end, but that's a story for another time. Welcome fresh slug!!!"
UCSC,fmqdq7s,t3_fwonu0,1586297685.0,"No. Best choice I made since I am a transfer student. Plus you can actually save money, get ebt for free food, use slug support when in dire need, and above all be able to study in a better environment. I do miss soe once in awhile though. I use to like studying weekends at home ( Fri, sat, sund) and the rest at SOE or McHenry"
UCSC,fmqdhde,t3_fwa7xy,1586297556.0,Why the fucks not. I'm down
UCSC,fmjtnym,t1_fmg5ued,1586137516.0,I have adhd didnt know it until I got into my 3rd year at UCSC (late). I went from a low 2.0 to a 3.5 with meds. Cse 107 is hard read the book do all the problems
