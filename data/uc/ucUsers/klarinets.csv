I feel so grateful, everything is so competitive even if it’s just volunteering!!! I’m honestly getting imposter syndrome, I keep thinking that they accidentally sent me the acceptance and it was supposed to go to someone else."
UCSantaBarbara,fpapqlf,t1_fpap271,1588453148.0,"Dude I have no idea what that was, it wasn’t in any of his videos I probably got no points on that question lol"
UCSantaBarbara,fp45izm,t3_gb46qz,1588292105.0,"I know!!! I feel like I have good explanations for the questions and they aren't wrong, but my TA takes off points because it's not the explanation they were looking for even though my explanation was right too. It's so infuriating"
UCSantaBarbara,fox09ae,t3_ga1vwy,1588131020.0,dude the lockdown will only go longer if you protest.
UCSantaBarbara,fooie7b,t1_foofa7t,1587939564.0,"I was thinking it was because the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria made them larger, and when you're larger you have a smaller SA/V ratio. But who knows"

COVID19,fnqwo08,t1_fnqvtgd,1587173859.0,"Thank you this calmed me down haha, especially because I go to a quarter system school that isn't starting until October 1st so who knows what the situation will be by then. I just can't see how they can go about dorms/dining halls/etc safely and also stop people from partying and going home on weekends, but I also can't see colleges staying closed for longer than fall because at that point I feel like the consequences would be too much. I guess we have to wait and see"
COVID19,fnqr2xe,t3_g0jfkh,1587170371.0,When could universities conceivably reopen? I've asked this before but at this point I don't think they can reopen for fall; do you think due to the nature of large lecture halls/dining halls and thousand of students coming in from different states/countries that universities can't open until a vaccine comes out? I know we need to keep people safe but as a college student with an on campus job that's closed this thought is really terrifying to me. With all the talk of no large gatherings until a vaccine I'm starting to wonder how colleges will go about this.
UCSantaBarbara,fncd0wj,t1_fnbz2dx,1586833812.0,"I really really hope we're back in fall, at least for smaller labs and sections. So many people have jobs on campus, and having no income besides some paid leave for spring, summer and fall could be detrimental for people. I really hope they figure something out :("
UCSantaBarbara,fmm4ogo,t3_fw3br8,1586198731.0,"I asked Gainer a couple weeks ago if 6BL will be canceled if summer goes online and he said it won't be canceled, but hopefully that didn't change!"
premed,fmjfh1x,t1_fmjebia,1586129267.0,"That’s a good way of putting it, thank you! I’ve just been feeling kinda useless, like I want to keep volunteering and start doing research and work toward medical school, so the idea that sitting at home is helping the most causes a kind of cognitive dissonance lol. Hope you’re staying healthy and safe!"
