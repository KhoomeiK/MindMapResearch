You don't have to watch it all, but you should skip to the part where it talks about Fauci. Also if you watch you should watch his older videos. You will see a scary pattern."
PoliticalHumor,fpe3cc4,t1_fpc1g5c,1588539531.0,I honestly didn't even know she existed until the day she was on that podium. I do hope she is not a compulsive liar like the rest of the administration

PoliticalHumor,fpbznln,t1_fp8k66r,1588483070.0,"I agree, but I rather see it and listen to every thing with caution than to actively expect the lie."
PoliticalHumor,fp7quf1,t3_gbommp,1588375902.0,"This is very premature.... I am disappointed that you guys didn't give her a chance. This administration has fucked up in every turn, but to preemptively assume she will lie it's a bit too much."
ucr,fouzs42,t1_fotnq3s,1588093058.0,"Thank you, likewise."
ucr,fork5x7,t1_for0lcq,1588013595.0,"Yeah, I think it's a break what I need and do some learning and reflecting.  I had been struggling with my personality for sometime not excelling as much as I wanted to, but this whole situation is making it hard to even think about school. I can't focus at home and everyday I go to bed hating the fact that I got very little work done."

Bunch of retards"
ucr,foknuh6,t1_fokck31,1587845578.0,If you pick AI or Pentland you will regret it. I stayed in all three of them and lothian was the best.  East Lothian.
ucr,fnryfbe,t1_fnrmvo1,1587206405.0,Thank you. I hope the same for you and know that you are not alone in anything.
ucr,fnrgnqa,t1_fjm2wwk,1587188386.0,"Hey dude, maybe we should shut down the school every flu season.... It's just a flu according to you. Great job I am enjoying this"
ucr,fnk5p2l,t3_g28xje,1587015734.0,"It won't be in person. Just check how pandemics usually play out and you will see that it's by waves. Since the SARS-COV-2 has mutated a lot and has infected plenty of hosts and therefore increased it's probability of mutating it's probable that it will stay with us. Something like the flu, but a shit ton more deadly and more persistent. Good luck and take care."
ucr,flkmx17,t1_fli1ejr,1585243900.0,"Yo, i am struggling with the same. And I was diagnosed with ADD and I have medicine for it, but is still a struggle. It's horrible."
