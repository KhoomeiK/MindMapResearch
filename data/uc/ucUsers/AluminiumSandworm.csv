traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fovm85p,t1_fou673a,1588103688.0,"yeah, that's more correct. i didn't go with the 100% accurate analogy because it would be ""it's like when you normalize a wavefunction to a part that extends beyond the energy well the bulk of the particle's probability field exists in""

we had to do quantum tunneling in my class about, well quantum physics but also the class on semiconductor devices like transistors and diodes. turns out it happens inside mosfet transistors under the right conditions and that effects the maximum voltage you can put on the gate before it stops passing current."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fou2zca,t1_fotypkp,1588074723.0,"""my gender potential curve has asymptotes"" sounds like a t-shirt that would entice so many different kinds of bullying they'd cancel out and put you in a Lagrange point of coolness"
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fou2sfh,t1_fotlpyx,1588074562.0,"no, the higher curve peaks represent a higher energy level. think about where water would pool if you poured it on the graph as places where particles would likely gather. 

quantum tunneling is when the waveform of the thing in the dip normalizes to be somewhere outside the dip, then rolls to the bottom. think of having the water be constantly splashing all over the place all crazy, and eventually some splashes out and rolls down to the even steeper place.

i could carry this analogy on for at least another 4 or 5 paragraphs but i don't think anyone came down here for a lecture on qm so imma stop there"
