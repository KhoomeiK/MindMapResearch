I understand the concern that fees are continuing to grow, but the Womxn's Hub fee would be the lowest fee charged to us at $6 annually. Compare this to the $264 fee for the ARC, the $128 fee for the Anteater Express, and the $417 fee that we are charged for the Student Center. It's more comparable to the $10 fee we are charged annually for the FRESH Hub.

Additionally, from the money raised from the fees, 33% of the money goes back towards students who benefit from financial aid. And the rest of the money doesn't go towards administration. It all goes to helping the Womxn's Hub which you can directly benefit from. 

The Womxn's Hub is trying to get this money because 80% of the money they receive is temporary. This leads to financial insecurity for a department that helps thousands of students every year. Because of this, they are the only major department on campus that doesn't have multiple pro staff. I know funding through reserves seems like a good alternative, and it definitely would be helpful, but it doesn't solve the problem of temporary funds that the Womxn's Hub currently suffers from. Consider the Womxn's Hub has been relocated THREE times in the four years it's been on this campus. No major department should have to worry about the money it needs to fund its programs and events."

But I appreciate the self-awareness that they're the bad guys and comparisons to them are in fact, a bad thing.

Claim 1: Voting a certain way has nothing to do with what slate you're on. The slate known as Friends of Petr from last year had 13 members running, none of which are associated with the current slate, Anteaters United. 

Claim 2: Nothing is known about the political party preferences of most ASUCI Candidates. We do know for sure ASUCI Senators Bryce Lindsey, Russell Matias, and Parliamentarian Kimo Gandall are active members of College Republicans at UCI. 

Claim 3: I know you're talking shit about us, but you got one right. :)

Claim 3.1: There are two candidates on AU in the current Senate, compared to the 6 members of FTC in the current Senate, so if the government's accomplished nothing, surely it's more on FTC than anyone else.

Claim 4: There is no slate called Anteater's Re-ignited for one. Secondly, there are no members from last year's slate Friends of Petr on the slate Anteaters United. There are however, 3 members of Friends of Petr from last year on the current slate, Fund the Clubs (those being Ryan Pavey, Logan Knight, and Joshua Wolfe).

Claim 5: The member of ASUCI government who was rumored to have COVID-19 is Senate Parliamentarian Kimo Gandall, who was at risk of contracting it when he attended the Conservative Political Action Committee, and he had attended a Senate meeting after being tested but before he received his test results, so he put all the Senators at risk.

I'd really like to know who made this burner account, and who keeps telling these guys that making them is a good idea. It really just makes you guys look worse. Who made this account? Kevin Tran again? Maybe Joshua Wolfe is mad we caught him lying about his ""work"" in funding certain organizations.

UCI,fnio85h,t1_fnindbr,1586983426.0,"A $6 annual fee would currently be the lowest fee we would be charged.

Small things add up, sure, but why aren't you more up in arms about the big things? The Womxn's Hub aids thousands of students every year just like the FRESH Hub, Student Center, etc., and it deserves to have a steady source of funding to continue to do so.

I'm so sick of this black and white argument that we can choose to raise fees or complain that college is too expensive. We can do both because there are a lot of other expenses we have to pay that cost us a lot more. It's really upsetting that people (most of which can afford it) just plain refuse to fund departments like this."

UCI,fniftp4,t1_fnic9gj,1586979267.0,"I'm not sure where you got the idea that Fund the Clubs are similar to Anteaters United.

The only members of AU who are currently serving on the Senate are Michelle Mallari and Ivan Fonseca, who both 1. voted against impeachment and 2. voted in favor of the Womxn's Hub. Neither of them were part of the group of senators who were recalled.

Anteaters United has no connections to Friends of Petr, unlike Fund the Clubs who has 3 members of last year's Friends of Petr and 3 more senators who were actually recalled.

As others have mentioned, you might be mixing up Anteaters United and Anteaters4Anteaters. Anteaters4Anteaters has candidates running who used to be part of Fund the Clubs before branching off into their own slate. Anteaters United is not associated with them at all."

UCI,fni80gq,t3_g1wioq,1586975534.0,"Honestly, as time's gone by, I've come to care less and less about the Student Infrastructure Act (the engineering bill). But I'm really thankful for it because it brought me into this world where I can now see everything the Senate has done wrong.

I'm not against the Constitutional Reform because I'm spiteful of the Senate. I've read the whole thing, and it's not just club money. They want to take away student's votes on certain offices, giving themselves the power to appoint those positions, even though one of them (SAG) is supposed to be an impartial investigative role.

Not to mention, they're trying to make it easier on the Senate to remove people they don't like. The Elections Commissioner needs a 75% vote to be removed by the Senate, but under the new Constitution it's only 66%. That doesn't seem like a lot, but that's the difference between removal and not removal with the current Senate breakdown. I had my job in the elections commission taken away from me by about a 70%~ vote (66% needed) by the current Senate and if the Elections Commissioner was held to those same standards, they would've removed him too.

Oh, and their plan to fund clubs? Not even as good as some other slates have proposed. The Constitution will allocate most of the $750,000 to academic schools first, and those schools will be able to distribute funds among clubs that are affiliated to their school. This is flawed in a lot of ways. 1. We can't trust the academic schools to fund clubs equally. We need to fund clubs directly, and slates like Anteaters United have better plans to bypass funding the schools first. 2. Most clubs aren't school-affiliated, so they won't be getting as much money to begin with, and the money being delegated to non-school affiliated clubs still has to go through the executive branch. That means the problem arises again that clubs aren't being directly, and the executive might not distribute funds to clubs fairly.

I respect your opinion though and totally see where you're coming from. But I've seen the Senate do a lot worse than the engineering bill, and would strongly encourage you compare the two Constitutions before voting on the reform."

The plan Fund the Clubs has outlined is a cover-up for the new Constitution they are trying to get passed which will take away the rights of students to vote for offices like the SAG, AAVP, and the SSVP and give themselves the power to appoint who they like and remove who they don't.

Not only that, they are making it easier for the Senate to remove executives that they don't like.

The Womxn's Hub Resilience Referendum is a YES. The Womxn's Hub is a department on campus that has been around for 4 years, and yet it has been relocated three times. 80% of the money they receive is temporary, and as a result, they have not been able to provide for students in a way they would like to.

What makes FTC's plan to give $750,000 to clubs better than say, Anteaters United's Unite the Clubs initiative? Or have you even read their slate platform? And I hardly think my partiality is any more disgusting than the Senate's attempts at taking voting opportunities away from the students. I simply want what's best for the students, something the Senate has yet to work towards."
UCI,fnb5gpf,t1_fnb4m3i,1586809549.0,"How you been, Ryan? Haven't had the misfortune to speak with you in a long time. Finally recover from being recalled?

Thanks for admitting, by the way, that the Senators have recognized where they can be corrupt and have acted on it at every opportunity. Another thing that's corrupt is backing a constitutional reform that takes away students' votes on 3 major executive positions, making it easier for senators to remove Elections Commissioners, and making it virtually impossible for senators to get recalled again. From my understanding, you supported this? Real classy of you  all to remove the article titled ""Direct Democracy"" from the Constitution and reduce it to a single clause of students rights with no details or specifications of student power."
UCI,fnb2ytr,t1_fnb1h2g,1586808302.0,"Unfortunately, the Elections Commission only has so much reach. Interns are posting on the class Facebook pages, but there is no hub where students can advertise the elections as a whole. That's why I, along with a handful of other students, are being so active on Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. I've even shared the elections in the UCI Discord. I doubt most students are taking the elections seriously to begin with, which is unfortunate, and as a result aren't paying much attention to the email that was sent this morning."
UCI,fnb08sh,t1_fnayw62,1586806957.0,"There's nothing in the Constitution I can find that delegates to the Senate the ability to overturn fee initiatives like the Whub referendum. From my understanding, once it's in effect, it's there until it expires or is reaffirmed."
UCI,fnaxu7u,t1_fnax5ri,1586805728.0,"The Womxn's Hub can receive money from the student reserves (if the reserves aren't already spent irresponsibly). However, the point of the referendum is to provide a long-term source of funding, so they won't have to worry about reinstating temporary funds year to year. Similar referendums have been passed for the FRESH Hub, a resource I'm sure you're aware of.

As of now, the only money they receive as [permanent funding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GbwVKxmr1x9bFY0QMhZ_LgkG20Da8o-bkV119NCrlg0/edit) is a $14,000 general budget."

UCI,fnawtzh,t3_g0pdmu,1586805223.0,"Hi! The slate you're looking to avoid is Fund The Clubs. Six of their members are part of the current Senate that had 23 senators recalled. Gabriel Zanipatin, Nicholas Ortiz, Logan Knight, Joshua Wolfe, Ryan Pavey, and Faith Chua.

These are the people who have been under fire for the last few months for irresponsibly managing UCI's student reserves and baselessly impeaching the President of ASUCI.

If you're looking for an alternative, I suggest Anteaters United. This slate is full of experienced, passionate individuals running in almost every position who have seen what the Senate has been up to (and is trying to perpetuate) and is looking to move ASUCI forward. Each candidate on the slate will have the name of the slate listed next to their name on the ballot, so you shouldn't have trouble finding them. But I would suggest reading up on all candidates beforehand so you can make your own decisions.

UCI,fnauwqd,t1_fnau3bg,1586804251.0,"In certain ways, yeah. The Senate shot down the Womxn's Hub referendum, the Womxn's hub being a resource i use on campus quite often. The Womxn's Hub has been relocated 3 times in 4 years, so us being forced to petition for it was really worrying. 

Also, the money that they sought to allocate to Engineering students ($800,000) is money that is intended to benefit all students, and that money could go directly to events, programs, giveaways, etc. that benefit us all instead of only 14% of the entire student population."
UCI,fnas7ef,t1_fnar7ym,1586802893.0,"Not the guy you're responding to, but I care because the people we elect get to manage million-dollar budgets, allocating hundreds of thousands of it to academic schools and programs every year. Even if you don't think they should have that power, they do, and it's important we choose carefully who we give that power to. Believe it or not, some of these candidates are actually qualified, having worked in ASUCI before and some even previously working with state and federal governments. 

Last year, we had an abysmal amount of people vote in the ASUCI elections (less than 10%). As a result of that, we've had the most controversial Senate in the last decade, baselessly trying to impeach the President (first time ever done at UCI), and irresponsibly and disproportionately allocate money to a small amount of the student population. They appointed their own friends to open positions and left positions open (Arts senator) when filling it wouldn't benefit them. 

So even more than picking the right people, I'm encouraging students to vote so we don't pick the wrong people."
UCI,fnarlxn,t3_g0o40p,1586802593.0,"These debates were really eye-opening. Michelle really stood out as a presidential candidate, especially considering her experience in the Senate and her commitment to building trust. It's still amazing to me that so many recalled senators have the gall to run again, some even looking for bigger positions.

Logan Knight running for Student Advocate General is especially heinous, considering the Student Advocate General is supposed to be a party-neutral, investigative position, and yet he is running on a slate (which contains many of the previously recalled senators). No one has considered there may be a conflict of interest there?"
UCI,fnaf4we,t1_fnae6y8,1586796413.0,"I get the concerns. It is only $6 a year though, and 33% of the money raised will go towards aiding students who receive financial aid (which is most students), so in reality, the fees are not that detrimental to students. Not to mention, this fee goes towards a helpful department, where you can collect supplies whose value exceeds the fee you're paying. Condoms, feminine hygiene products, books, food, etc. are all available to students who visit the Womxn's Hub, so you can effectively cancel out the fee you are being charged. And if you have quarantine concerns (i.e. that you can't get those supplies because we're not at school), this initiative wouldn't take effect until Fall Quarter, when we'll likely be back in school ([according to Dr. Fauci](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/491680-fauci-country-should-be-in-good-shape-to-reopen-schools-in-the-fall))."

nba,fmr9tx5,t1_fmr9obi,1586317345.0,"That's why I made sure to mention the power dynamic between men and women. Women, like the LGBTQ+ community, have plenty to fear from heterosexual men. Women and gays are more prone to abuse either from sexual assault, homophobia, harassment, etc."
nba,fmr9eg6,t1_fmr643p,1586317039.0,"The point of these movements is that anyone should be able to value who they are as a person, regardless of their genitals.

One thing you should consider is separating the concepts of gender and genitalia. That way, you can see how someone can have male genitalia and still identify as a woman. That also helps with figuring out the logic of ""My body, my choice."" Obviously, people who have vaginas (trans men and cis women) should have the highest priority in deciding how women can police their own bodies. And people who don't have vaginas (trans women and cis men) shouldn't get the same level of input but can still take pride in their identity.

The whole point of this movement is to respect people's identities and allow them to express themselves in whatever way they feel most comfortable, regardless of their genitalia."

nba,fmr8p62,t1_fmr7iut,1586316549.0,"You really don't get the nuance of this. It's not just as simple as ""if I am attracted to a certain sex, I shouldn't be allowed to be in the same locker room as them."" Otherwise, bisexual people would literally have nowhere to change LOL. For LGBTQ+ identifying people, the fear of being shunned, attacked, or killed for being part of the community is really high and explains why they don't divulge that information to anyone, teammates, friends, and family alike.

So to answer your question, no I don't think it's hypersexualization. There are more factors beyond straight men being attracted to women that go into separating them between locker rooms. Notice how you didn't say ""Straight women shouldn't share showers with men because it's inappropriate."" That's because of the power dynamic between men and women that doesn't exist in the example LeBron gave."
nba,fmr7vd4,t1_fmr5w3o,1586315957.0,"Hypersexualization of gay people is the concept that people tend to only think of gay intent through a sexual lens, especially since that's the only way a straight person is different from a gay person. Examples include impulsively telling a gay man you're straight so he doesn't get the idea that you're gay too. People do that because they automatically assume gay people are trying to make sexual advances when they're not.

For a lot of gay people, they fear reprimand for their sexuality being made public. No one is obligated to tell you their sexuality, and the fear of verbal or physical harassment for being openly gay takes priority over the concerns of straight people who might be getting looked at."

But that's just a way to hypersexualize gay people. As a gay man, I certainly don't stare at naked men at the gym I go to. I'm just there to get work done, just like any gay athlete."
