‚Ä¢Go on student access and click the ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù tab. Next click ‚Äúenrollment Exceptions‚Äù. You can choose to add course, switch sections, drop course, change variable units or change grade option (which is for p/np).
It‚Äôll ask which class you want to drop and they‚Äôll ask for a 140 character explanation. 
Once you submit the request the school will go over it and approve/decline the request. 

‚Ä¢you can drop the class week 6 and be totally fine. If you drop after week 6, a W (which stands for withdraw) will appear on your transcript for that class."
UCI,fpilxfe,t3_gdnstq,1588643651.0,"I can‚Äôt speak about the party life at UCI bc personally I‚Äôve never really attempted to get involved.
However, if you can stay motivated enough at a community college to transfer in 2 years to UCLA, I say you do it! UCLA is your dream school & your first two years of undergrad you‚Äôre taking prereqs that you could take at a cc and save a TON of money!! 
I came straight to UCI only because I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt take cc seriously and I was afraid of being stuck there for longer than 2 years. If I could go back and start at a cc and transfer, I would do it."

I am a bio major and I dropped a class week 3. Bio Sci school said it was a one time exception due to COVID 19 & that in the future I would have to provide proof. 
My reasons was something along the lines of ‚Äúhaving a hard time with remote learning , this class is too much on my plate‚Äù 
If you drop after week 6, a W will appear on your transcript so I suggest you do it ASAP.

curlyhair,fpc85vd,t3_gcmjty,1588490892.0,"Routine:
1. co wash with Giovanni Smooth as Silk Conditioner, rinse out completely 
2. Next, I use the same conditioner to deep condition, doing squish to condish technique. Leave on for about 10-15min 
3. rinse my hair, leave it dripping wet & flip my head over & apply just a small blob of conditioner 
4. Run a wide toothed comb through my wet hair a couple of times until I see a curl shape I can try to mold with my gel
5. With hair flipped over, I take about a medium blob of Eco Chic L.A. Natural Styling gel. put my hands on the very tips of my hair and push up. Kind of like squish to condish but you‚Äôre not squeezing all over the place, you‚Äôre more like pressing your hair up against your skull. I do this to keep my waves from getting into separate thinner strands. 
6. I take about 2 more blobs of gel but I apply each of them one at a time. When I apply a huge lump of gel all at once my hair gets overwhelmed. By building on the product with several smaller blobs, I‚Äôm able to tell when there is enough product in my hair vs. over doing it with a big blob. 
7. I grab a cotton T-shirt and place it at the very bottom on my tips. I press my hair up against my skull with my cotton T-shirt allowing it to absorb any excess water & or product. 
8. Holding my hair with the T-shirt pressed against my head, I slowly bring my head up. (My head is now no longer flipped) Once I‚Äôm standing up straight, I allow my curls to fall down from the top of my head. I use the cotton t shirt and gently press my hair towards my skull till my hair is no longer dripping 
9. Next I apply Garnier Fructis Style Curl Shaping spray gel but instead of spraying I just twist off the cap and squeeze out some blobs. and I do squish to condish (normal way). 
10. Allow hair to air dry
11. Once hair is dried, I do scrunch out the crunch. 
12. :D"

It amazes me how much my knowledge has flourished since I got there. I enjoy my major and I appreciate that the school does an adequate job at educating me on the subject. The majority of the classes I‚Äôve taken have been well structured and well taught. The majority of the professors I‚Äôve had are very educated and efficient. I say majority because, unfortunately this is not always the case. There are also several resources for students that are very helpful. I also think that having the opportunity to conduct research or work in a lab is super cool.  Most importantly, I find comfort in knowing that my degree will be from UCI. Life after undergrad is scary but I think having a degree from UCI will be very beneficial to my career."

FemaleDatingStrategy,foho2oz,t3_g7i6ow,1587769315.0,"Hey I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. 
I know it hurts to walk away from someone who you once loved and thought was right for you. I think it‚Äôs wonderful that you want to be selfish and work on yourself. That‚Äôs the best thing you can do right now! 
When I was dealing with my own heartbreak, I made a list of every thing I didn‚Äôt like my ex-partner doing and how bad it made me feel. On days that I thought of him, that I questioned my decision, Or got lonely, i read that list over again. Don‚Äôt allow yourself to forget that you walked away because you wanted something better for yourself! 
In regards to being selfish and working on yourself you can start even with small things to pamper yourself. After I split with my ex, I finally learned how to properly do my toe nails (you might already have perfected this lol it took me a while). I learned how to better style my hair. I got a new skin care routine. I started taking bubble baths. I started doing anything that made me feel good about myself, no matter how small. Of course you can also get a new hobby, learn a new language or pursue other things. But point is do what YOU want and what makes YOU feel good. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a huge change or it could be a huge change. What matters is that you‚Äôre putting yourself first! 
And remember to be kind to yourself. Some days will be good and some days you might find yourself a bit sad, missing your old relationship. If this happens, allow the emotions to flow. Don‚Äôt blame yourself or feel ‚Äúdumb‚Äù for missing certain aspects of your relationship. On these days, love yourself even more. Allow yourself to feel so you can begin to release."

I recommend you start by switching to a different shampo/container. This made a huge difference for me. [list of friendly products](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Dlc52yoWdMo4p7RWcVERJS_Lo5NSeDCtV2gWyTBllAw/mobilebasic)  which won‚Äôt further damage your hair. Personally I cut out shampoo and I co-wash instead (only using conditioner & scrubbing my scalp). I would also recommend a hair curling cream & gel which you can also on the list. 

I know the road ahead seems long but once you start seeing even the smallest differences, you‚Äôll want to keep going! Wishing you the best!"
