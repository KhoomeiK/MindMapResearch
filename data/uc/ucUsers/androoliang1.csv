UCI,foxop0h,t1_foxo1oo,1588150895.0,cc has a program called TAG where you basically follow the articulation between your cc and one of the selected UC’s and you’ll get in 100%. All you need is to maintain a 3.4 gpa and just complete the major requirements and GEs so you’ll be on track for when you transfer. -curent cc student who tagged ucsb and got in but also got into uci as well. cc students get priority over state schools or other four year universities

Hello fellow transfer students. I was just waitlisted for Econ today and was wondering what are the chances of getting off the waitlist? Did it affect your housing situation and your ability to find roommates ? Does the waitlist statement really matter or do they not really consider that besides the fall/winter/spring courses and grades that they ask for since it does say that it is optional and it is okay to leave it blank"

My 2014 m6 gt has some wind noise that id like to get rid of but is also out of warranty. It’s not just the back windows though, I hear it from the front as well, sort of near the A pillar section"
