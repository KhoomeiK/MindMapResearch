berkeley,fox5lh0,t3_g9z4bk,1588134635.0,"Ling 100 is a great class, especially with Katherine Hilton if she's teaching it. The homework doesn't take too long, max 1.5-2 hours a week if you're thorough with it. The content is also pretty straightforward and interesting.

If Paul Li is teaching Cogsci 1, it shouldn't be too difficult, just make sure you study and remember all the terms for the exams.

As for C127, I haven't taken it, but I've heard from several people that it's one of the most difficult Cogsci upperdivs. You might want to save it for a different semester when you're not taking 61A. 61A is not too bad if it clicks for you, but it's definitely a lot of work, and can be really time consuming and stressful if you struggle with it."
berkeley,fot0qsv,t3_g9evz4,1588042092.0,"I met my roommates off of one of those Facebook groups, so I honestly didn’t talk to them much or get to know them too well beforehand, so it was practically like going random. I ended up not liking one of them too much, and she always woke me up early in the morning getting ready. But the other one is one of my closest friends today and we still live with each other. It’s honestly chance with these things."
berkeley,foh8uck,t1_foh6ucg,1587761959.0,Hm. You would think they would save even just 10% of the seats for Cog Sci majors in these upper divs because it's so hand-in-hand with Psychology. Oh well. Hopefully I'll get to take at least one interesting Psychology class I'm interested in before I graduate :/
berkeley,foh8l3s,t1_foglsib,1587761838.0,"If only we could get each other into our respective classes lol. But thanks for the advice, I guess I'll just keep an eye out then."
berkeley,fog72bt,t1_fog6xrj,1587748754.0,Yeah but the thing is I can’t even get onto the waitlist
berkeley,fod7sxo,t1_focldvd,1587681341.0,thanks so much for this! :’)
berkeley,fo21dzb,t3_g59b7i,1587446836.0,Nope but L&S CS is pretty much the exact same thing so you should be fine
berkeley,fnzn7b3,t3_g4lk9j,1587397249.0,"“Researchers from the Chan school said Tuesday that the US may have to endure social distancing measures, such as stay-at-home orders and school closures, until 2022.”

someone please end this :("
berkeley,fny6765,t1_fny62o3,1587354390.0,either way we’re screwed since they’re only giving us an hour and a half to do it. but yeah i agree.
berkeley,fmrkxdb,t1_fmrihvf,1586326390.0,it was FIFTY EIGHT fucking points like wtaf
berkeley,fmmvezx,t1_fmmchrx,1586212834.0,"If you’re not used to staying up later than you normally are, you can’t really expect to perform as well as you would normally. Especially for 70, which requires a lot of complex thinking."
berkeley,fmgc7tw,t1_fmfqeho,1586045798.0,"I personally am studying both because I’m interested in human-computer interaction and UI/UX design, but yeah there’s a lot of on-campus clubs and some courses that suit my interests for that! Since I’m not really interested in comp bio, I’m not familiar with what we have to offer but there should probably be some clubs and programs that combine both. You can also look into Berkeley URAP, which is a well known research program."
