UCSantaBarbara,foehteo,t3_g6yf3v,1587704141.0,MCDB 1B itself is really time consuming; that class requires a lot of attention if you're looking to pass at least with a B.

You can keep the windows open and shut the curtains for privacy. As long as you have a good amount of air flow, it shouldn’t be a huge issue."
