Because being virtuous and getting hurt is harder than being a coward and pretending that the world is black and white? 

Because you've completely given up inside, believing you don't have any actual power and you'll let whichever candidate the elites choose for you fuck you in the ass if it means you don't have to think an independent thought or fight for something you actually believe in? 

Because you've filled the empty hole in your heart that a lack of morals has left you with a political party that would rather see you bled dry in a sweatshop than lift a finger to fight for you?"
OurPresident,fpman9g,t1_fpm9gan,1588728993.0,"You've been voting for Bernie ""for years now""? You mean twice? Lol I don't understand that sentence, he's only campaigned for president twice so far.

How am I proving your point? Trump is already in office. The chance of voting out an incumbent is about 20% on a regular year. You might get some leeway on that considering Trump is so disliked by the left, but Biden is also disliked by segments of the left, as well as all of the right. So, Biden gets Trump reelected, not me."
OurPresident,fpma2m1,t1_fpm98vp,1588728650.0,"Why is it up to me to fix *your* candidate's issue? Remember, we have a democracy. My voice was heard in my primary. In fact, in my state (the largest one in the country, but you know, who's counting) my guy won by 8.5%. 

The ""consensus pick"" (for the sake of argument) is your guy. Part of being a leader is consolidating your base. Biden has failed miserably at that - hell, where the fuck even *is he* these days? Hiding in his basement while his surrogates take his interviews. If Biden doesn't prove to the left that he wants their support, then he won't earn their votes. 

Part of playing the game of democracy is knowing that you will alienate some voters. For the left, a rapist who is best friends with billionaire oligarchs and wants to return to the ""good ol' days"" of bank bailouts, trillion dollar wars, and locking up black people for looking at you funny, is not our guy. So, you lost us. Better luck next time (if we get a next time)."
OurPresident,fpm8x0o,t1_fplsgrr,1588727969.0,"Why should voting against Trump be any Democrat's priority? You would vote for George Bush again if it got Trump out of office? You would vote for Ted Cruz, so long as Trump was gone? You would vote for Dr. Oz? Oprah? My dog?

For many of us, we don't have an actual choice in November. Trump and Biden are friends with the same Washington insiders. You trade one pretend billionaire running things for a handful of billionaires running things. We're all fucked either way. Biden will inspire no one, we'll probably lose the House, certainly won't win the Senate, then we've got gridlock if Biden wins (yaaay!) or tax cuts if Trump stays (boo!) no action on climate change or demilitarization, and then we're shit out of luck.

The only people taking this seriously are the ones who see that *both candidates* are going to be the death of us. We just get to choose which flavor of oppression we get."

I don't get why its on the people who are uninspired to come up with a viable alternative. You're acting like the candidate that wins the majority of the votes every cycle isn't ""Didn't Vote"" if you look at the statistics. Biden is a corporatist pig that championed the Iraq war, wrote the crime bill, and got Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court. Hard fucking pass.

I will be voting in every election except president, unless the Greens can manage to run someone that isn't an idiot this time around."

OurPresident,fpls7w2,t1_fplqajd,1588718467.0,"Yes, you are the problem. Because getting rid of your morals in order to destroy something you think is immoral (Trump) is the reason Trump exists in the first place. It means you never had morals to begin with.

Millions of people said, ""forget morals, I want security"" and voted for Trump in 2016 when the Obama economy left them high and dry. Biden supporters are doing the exact same thing this time around. If we keep doing that, then our country deserves the terrible leaders we elect."

Biden people aren't supporting Biden because they like him. He had rock bottom support during the primary until every other choice aside from Bernie dropped out. Biden is the ""vote blue no matter who"" candidate, Bernie is the ""activate new voters"" candidate. The primary bore that out. Voting blue no matter who would mean that people currently supporting Biden would support anyone. Bernie's people never made that claim."
OurPresident,fplq5om,t1_fplpsqj,1588717356.0,"I'm not sure. We didn't have one of those, which is too bad. We started to do one, and it was neck-and-neck, and then everyone dropped out and threw their support behind one guy in order to maintain their funding and cushy jobs within the party. Then a pandemic happened, and many states pushed their elections despite federal guidelines demanding they postpone them. Then other states canceled their primaries entirely. 

I'm not saying Bernie would have won the primary. I'm saying that more voters agreed that they would vote for him in the general if he were the nominee. But all of that is over now, because the DNC shut the entire primary down and Bernie dropped out. 

So, we're stuck with your idiot."
OurPresident,fplpih8,t1_fpllnsf,1588717010.0,"At least you're honest about not understanding math.

If Democrats have 30% of popular support, Republicans have 30%, and the remaining 40% are non-voters, guess who you desperately need to vote for your guy? That's right, 100% of *your own fucking party*.

Relying only on 75% of your 30% of the population, based on their complacency with the system, a winning campaign does not make. Maybe choose a candidate who, I don't know, unites the party? A candidate that the 75% who doesn't give a fuck and the 25% who *does* give a fuck would actually vote for?

If only we had polling data that showed one specific candidate whom nearly all Democrats would vote for in the general..."
OurPresident,fplp0p8,t1_fplg5ki,1588716746.0,"Not when you need more than 100% of your *own fucking party* to vote for you to succeed in the general. Biden will only win if he has 100% of Democrats *and* non-voters to overtake Republican numbers. And this ain't that, friend."

We will be signalling to the DNC that we are willing to give up our democratic (small ""d"") principles at the drop of a hat.

The DNC broke it, they bought it, in my opinion. If they pushed Biden, then we lose with Biden, or we have another primary. End of discussion."

Virtue is addressing the story the moment it comes out, publicly, on TV, with Biden himself speaking to Tara Reade (or at the very least answering hard questions about the allegations).

DemocraticSocialism,fowfvdx,t1_fowc51x,1588118969.0,"I like this dialogue, so I'll share with you my thinking about Biden specifically. It has a lot to do with the history of the executive in the U.S.

If you look at every president since Reagan (the neoliberal era), every single one of them, of both parties, has expanded the executive to do more things. The use of executive orders, skirting the War Powers Act, etc. Political scholars agree that Trump is not an aberration - he is the *result* of presidents like Clinton, Bush Jr., and Obama. Trump is the perfect president envisioned by neoliberalism. He's cozy with big business, easily swayed by special interests, easily bribed, has a strong vested interest in preserving corporate power (he benefits from it directly through his businesses and indirectly through his cronies).

Trump is the neoliberal dream, *not* the fascist dream. Notice how his cronies in the Republican party cringe about the kids in cages (a fascist move) but not his blatant profiting off his office (a neoliberal move). 

Why am I saying all this? Because who is more neoliberal than Joe Biden? Joe Biden wrote the crime bill that locked up millions of black and brown Americans. Joe Biden became *the champion* in the Democratic party for Bush's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He wrote the bankruptcy bill that makes it easy to move money around for corporations but nearly impossible for home owners or medical debt holders, and literally impossible for student debt holders. 

Biden isn't just an alternative to Trump, he's a successor. Biden represents neoliberalism just as much as Trump, just different facets (like choosing Larry Summers as his economic advisor). So in my view, they are *literally* the same. Their ideologies, at their core, are identical. They are both rapists. They are both in early stages of dementia. They are both surrounded by people far more intelligent than themselves, who will do everything they can to take money out of *your* pocket. 

So, I won't vote for him. Because, as far as I can tell, I actually don't have a choice this November. And neither do you. You have an illusion of a choice, but the result is exactly the same either way. You want kids in cages? Trump. You want blacks incarcerated? Biden. You want families broken apart? Obama. Their policies don't differ as much as they'd like you to think."

DemocraticSocialism,fow53rn,t1_fop33mz,1588113175.0,"Presidents are the chief executive of the entire nation. They literally *do control every police officer in the 50 states*. They set the tone for enforcement for the entire nation. That's one of their primary job descriptions. 

Presidents also *appoint federal judges* which set the tone for the state judiciaries. Federal courts resolve legal disputes that lower courts in the states cannot resolve. 

It's like you have no fucking clue how the United States government works, have no sense of history, and are white washing centuries' long regimes of state terror just to make some weird point about Donald Trump. Like, I fucking hate the guy too, would love to see him put in a guillotine. That doesn't change the history of this country, or the way that the presidency, police, or judicial system works.

This is our maximum point of leverage. Towing the party line will prove to the DNC that they can run a neoliberal racist rapist and we won't say a god damn word.

Like seriously, I feel like I tear my fucking hair our with Democrat sycophants every time this comes up.

DemocraticSocialism,fo4jb32,t1_fo1k9e8,1587505454.0,"What you described when you said, ""Quite the contrary... I have a particular fondness for Asian people"" is academically known as benevolent racism. Benevolent racism implies that the classification of human beings by racial status is not inherently destructive if there is a particular group that benefits from that racialized status - in your case, Asians. You're inadvertently agreeing that you're a racist by pretending that being nice to a racial group means that you aren't racist.

Also, as you say, ""China is not a race""... but neither is African-American (it's an ethnic group in the United States). And yet if you said, ""it's the culture of African-Americans that causes so much crime in our country"" you would be making a racist assertion. Race is a social category, it has nothing to do with genetics or biology. There is no such thing as being ""genetically Asian"" as you put it.

All of that being said (and I know you're going to fight me on all of that despite the fact that those are fundamental principles of sociology), even by your own metric you're still being racist (or maybe you prefer the word xenophobic). You use anecdotal evidence (""I have witnessed first hand"") and sweeping accusations (""hyper-consumption, materialism, lack of empathy, disregard for the planet, animal and human rights"") as a means to disavow an entire nation of people. Through nothing but your own perception (i.e. *not empirical*) you are claiming an entire nation of 1 billion people are exactly one single way.

Seriously, this isn't about political correctness. I don't think political correctness even fucking exists. This is about calling out blatant racism/xenophobia that is *pretending* to be empirical and scientific.

On top of that, Trump has a history of overtly racist housing discrimination in his apartments. His legacy of racism extends now into the presidency, as we've all seen (like Latinx kids in cages, being the most obvious example).

But that's not all - Trump is *also* a shill for despots and dictators around the world, and has contempt for democratic institutions like elections.

2. B.) You know who didn't vote for the war, get duped, or get caught up in the fanfare? Bernie FUCKING Sanders. So, it turns out having principles actually *does* matter when looking at somebodies record, because it proves that the supporters of the war did so based on conviction, not on the strength of the evidence.

3. He praised a colleague? No, he praised multiple segregationists, a few of which he never served in the senate with. He admired their work. By the way, if Biden is ""reaching across the aisle"" to work with segregationists, that's a big no from me, dog. Segregationists were the ones who sent ""nigger dogs"" to ravage black communities and allowed the Ku Klux Klans in their states to terrorize POC with the help of the police. I don't want my presidential candidate anywhere near segregationists, unless he's putting them behind bars.

4. ""The world is not black and white."" *EXACTLY* you finally got it! We can have nuanced beliefs about our candidates and make rational decisions based on their pasts, instead of thinking in terms of ""orange man bad so Biden man good."" Oh... no wait, sorry, somehow you meant the opposite of that? You're saying that creating a binary in which we get wall street wolves or fascist pigs is *not* black and white thinking?

5. The alternative is not to give up our collective power to one of these rapists. The alternative is to allow the Democratic party to fail, so that we can rebuild it to be a better party (including for the liberals that like Biden's policies but don't like his character). The alternative is to think to the future instead of continuing to just vote every four years and act like that's what being a good citizen is."

Cool, so glad we cleared that up. Good thing Biden isn't being protected by an entire establishment and we can all rest assured that Tara Reade is probably faking it like some Russian bot and her entire career wasn't ruined by this incident.

I want to be clear here (and avoid your obviously condescending tone) and say that I have never voted Green. I think Jill Stein is an idiot and I was way too young to vote for Nader. 

By the way, living your values is not ""performative wokeness."" I'm not virtue signalling here, I actually believe that I should not cast my vote for a rapist who drummed up support for the Iraq War, got Clarence Thomas onto the Supreme Court, wrote the crime bill that incarcerated millions of people of color, etc. 

The core of my argument (that you don't care about because you want to be angry at me) is that instead of picking a strong candidate that brings in new voters, Democrats consistently choose wall street safety picks. Which is why they keep losing, they don't energy anyone. If us progressives were such a powerful voting bloc, we would have gotten our own guy the nomination, not lost spectacularly like we just did."

I'm not saying that the progressives in the House are a powerful bloc.

You claim that Trump hates Democrats as if Democrats don't hate progressives with the exact same (if not more) fiery vitriol. 

I respectfully think that your framing has a confirmation bias, that you believe that a party that is rotten at its foundation would support its own cleansing.
