UCDavis,fnt3rdw,t3_g3qsoo,1587234048.0,Yes rent in Davis has been dropping amongst units that arent occupied I mean landlords are really struggling. For landlords that do have people living in their units I think they're fighting even harder to keep them. I've had several conversations with landlords who are still trying to charge as much as they were and some are in denial but many have realized what's happened and you can get a place for as low as $400 if you look I think it will drop even further but these are usually month to month from what I can tell because once the students move back of course they want to charge full price so the rent reduction is very temporary
FemaleDatingStrategy,fnsz5u7,t1_fnsy4j9,1587231566.0,"The problem of these sites is so far they don't have very many people in the United States though they are gaining people very quickly from what I can tell. I do like the quality of the people more than other sites I've used.

OkCupid was pretty horrible I mean there's some decent people but most of the people I met had drug addiction issues and I just felt like they were dark and I didn't really relate. But that was years ago maybe things are different now

My issue is Tinder is that it's highly saturated and it's just filled with so many people in so many choices that I think you don't really get to take the time you need to each person to develop a connection and was this site they have the option we can take personality test and you can look at a person's personality. I'm a very sexual person and if I'm in a relationship with somebody who isn't it almost never works out. I like to know in advance that they have a sex-drive that's as high as mine

I'm always interested in hearing about other dating sites I haven't looked into because there are some hidden gems out there and in the stage of the virus it's not like I can just go to Trader Joe's and try to pick somebody up or start a conversation with somebody everyone's wearing masks now so it's like online dating thing is pushed even further."
OregonStateUniv,fnpnmfn,t1_fnpni0d,1587148674.0,Actually I'm not which might surprise you I'm just new to the area and I tried Tinder and I didn't like it. I wish I was getting paid for this but I'm not
UCDavis,fn8sz95,t1_fn8sggv,1586749454.0,"What's really funny about that movie is that the Army is 12 Monkeys has nothing to do with the virus. I think that's what's hilarious the guys hunting for the Army is 12 Monkeys because history is being written as the army of 12 Monkeys is what was responsible for the virus but in fact it wasn't the army of 12 Monkeys at all. The army of 12 Monkeys was just a silly, comical stunt by Brad Pitt. In reality it was some lunatic who took a vials of virus and release them into various airports and stuff. Hence why the movie and this person have a lot in common."
UCDavis,fn8j3nw,t3_fzq9eb,1586742812.0,Clearly somebody has been watching 12 Monkeys a little too often. The army of the 12 Monkeys is upon us!
UCDavis,fn82bll,t3_fztbac,1586732422.0,Do major research on professors look let's be honest if you have one Professor it's going to be super easy class if you have another professor is going to suck. All classes depend on the professor so unfortunately it's less about what class you're taking and it's far more about what Professor you're taking. Also if you can pass the test online you don't have to take it so think about passing that test

UCDavis,fmogbc3,t3_fw7eb5,1586257962.0,You will only get in trouble if they cashed you and I don't think the police are going to go in the pond. I say what you do is wear a hoodie and do this and eventually just jump off your bike submerged in the water and come out somewhere without the police
UCDavis,fmog63f,t3_fwhv86,1586257810.0,It's overly impacted major. It's hard to complete your course work because there's so many students struggling and fighting to get into classes. On top of that if you actually wanted to be your major there's a lot of prereqs you have to do. I know that some students drop out of it and shoes to go so either a special code camp or a CSU but the reality is all computer science Majors everywhere are heavily impacted. On top of that no school really teaches computer programming that well compared to online platforms such as freecodecamp or other platforms. I can tell you right now that the university is about 10 years behind online educational platforms. What you do get is The credibility of going to a major university
UCDavis,fmofzkn,t3_fw8bx4,1586257626.0,"This is different for everyone for instance some of us live near major outbreaks and are taking care of our elderly parents. Some students are living in RVs and trailers outside of their families home because they're still being quarantined. Some of us students are doing all the shopping while wearing gas mask and putting bags of groceries in front of our parents houses so our parents don't starve to death and they don't go to the grocery store and get sick. Many of us right now are just trying to survive it's different per student, but some students are in a semi post-apocalyptic situation right now in which we are fighting for the survival of our families and still trying to complete College"
