science,fp66u7g,t1_fp52lqq,1588347133.0,">force a reader to figure out the intended meaning of the first clause based on subsequent clauses or sentences. This is especially true when simple grammatical changes can do that work.While the specific content of this post is only tangentially relevant, I would also like to point out that the reason this research was interesting is that the success of previous efforts to make tobacco bioluminesce was not visible to the naked eye. Native Americans could have bred (engineered) some or all strains of tobacco in a way that caused it to radiate green light, and it would not have been noticed. That would certainly be an interesting finding.Edit: you also never answered how you interpreted that sentence, which suggests to me that it was successfully ambiguous. Its grammatical construction was identical to that of the OP's title.

Hi mean11while et al, thanks for your feedback. I think the fact that there is much debate over the phrasing (which I appreciate!) means that there probably is a little too much ambiguity, and the fact that more than one person is confused should be enough reason to change it. In the future I'll just add the modifier ""Has been"". I was trying to work with what I could given the 300 letter limit.

This has been pretty constructive . I am trying to write these posts as an exercise in sci-comm, so all of your comments really are appreciated!"

science,fp3x1s9,t1_fp3v3tt,1588287405.0,"Sorry, I don't understand how it is misleading (?). I don't think the instinct upon reading it is to assume that I'm indicating ""ALL tobacco plants currently in existence are the product of genetic engineering and glow in the dark"".

I would assume the ""some"" is implied."

PanicAttack,fnbmicg,t3_g0so1s,1586818184.0,"""Ball dropped inside me"" sounds about right. Sounds like a panic attack. Once you realize you have them it gets easier - as you won't be so afraid of it. Panic attacks can't kill you! You just need to ride it out, and you will find sanity again once it passes!"

berkeley,fmxl5to,t1_fmxhwgh,1586467048.0,Mmm. If you didn't cheat I would not be worried. It's possible your answers are overly similar to that of another student and they were submitted at very close time intervals. Are they submitting this information to the university or are they offering you leeway upon confession?
berkeley,fmxh797,t3_fy07bq,1586464924.0,Did you collaborate with another student? It is quite easy to pick up if students worked together on exams.

No chest pains, good on that!"
