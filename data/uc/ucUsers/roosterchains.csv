boardgames,fpgynpv,t1_fpdgdhg,1588611852.0,Is the balance issue around the merging of gods? Or the gods and guardians abilities themselves?

boardgames,fpgxshp,t1_fpgueq7,1588611416.0,"If you like the fantasy theme and complexity of different characters and what something that is more complexity. Vast is more complicated asymmetric game. What I mean everyone plays a unique character who plays thr game different. Vast crystal caverns someone plays either a knight, dragon, goblins, or even the cave. Lots of fun but it is complex, would recommend you do plenty of research to make sure it wont be to difficult to teach and play.

If you just want a game with fairy tale theme. I would recommended  the grimm forest. Fun and easy game to learn. That being it plays nothing like villainous. You are a pig racing to build 3 houses, out of any 3 materials. It has bluffing and resource management as the main mechanics."
boardgames,fpgu1mf,t3_gdekms,1588609510.0,What about villanous did you like so much?

boardgames,fpew949,t1_fpervig,1588556308.0,"Completely different game. Ankh feels like what rising sun should have been. I like rising sun, I just didnt expect it to be an alliance and bluffing game. I've played ankh once on tts, but it felt more of an area control, semi enginer builder, and with some slight bluffing."

Now there is a contrary opinion, I believe from one of the original architects/designers. Which was the fountain was not meant to be a somber place, that it was always a place for a celebration of life. It was designed to be inviting and place to rest in the DC sun.

Which I see some truth with because when you are at the fountain it has a completely different feel than any other memorial I have been to. It feel more like a sunny center of a plaza. If the intent was to create a  a solemn tone, it seems contrary."
assholedesign,fpdjn13,t3_gcr2y7,1588528291.0,"I mean the real asshole design is the game is nothing like this. App companies found the best way to get people to play is pay money to a studio to make an add about a better, completely different game that does not exist."

Chargers,fp6agql,t3_gb7x3h,1588348966.0,"I would go Herbert, even if he is a bust it will be a memorable part of history. Plus if it does work out, would be dope to have a Jersey from his rookie year.

Only person I would rather have hindsight is besides Watson and Mahomes would be Lattimore. I wanted us to draft Hooker or Lattimore."

And was probably just average, which is saying a lot because the rest of our line was trash. He never got injured and was consistently average, which is not a bad thing.

You kind of forgot he was there, which honestly is kind of good for a player on the offensive line."
nfl,fp31htc,t1_fp2vlek,1588271484.0,To be fair they got the only good parts of our bad o-line.
Chargers,fp2nsir,t1_fp2n47v,1588264908.0,"True, I see him having similar development and use like Tyrell Williams. He started out being a gadget player and used for mostly slants, screens, and end of rounds. It was not until later he really bame that speedy deep threat."
Chargers,fp2n2ws,t3_gaogl9,1588264570.0,My big fear is how much faster our division got during the draft and our cb's do not match up well. Especially our depth at cb is really bad. We are so reliant on pass rush this season.

Chargers,fp2mn9z,t1_fp1yqzp,1588264362.0,More like pentalies were due to a Scott being terrible and pipkens being a guy who was supposed to have a red shirt year. Even when okung made it on the field he was not in playing shape and had a lot of holds.

Chargers,fout0ik,t3_g9kiq5,1588089909.0,"I mean he did regress last season in recieving, but so did the whole offence. The real question, is 2.7 million worth an elite blocking te? He is elite when it comes to blocking down field, he would really help Ekler spring open on those long plays."

Chargers,fooazak,t1_fooatmg,1587935799.0,"Ya but you are not trading up into the 1st for an Otto. That's just bad value and will hardly see the return. Especially on our team that runs so much nickel and dime.

Edit- Actually If he does develop having elite pass rushing than seeing him in Otto does make more sense and worth trading up for."

Chargers,foo8wsl,t1_foo6k28,1587934788.0,"I think in the long term based of his athleticism he can become a Will. I think in a season or two we will see Murray(Will), Tranquil(Mike), and someone knew(Otto). We will see Uchenna in Ingram's role and Kizir White playing the adrian Philip's role."

nfl,fogpcgl,t1_fognpi1,1587755425.0,I was going to say more with Patirots ability to not need heavy investment on any skill position. They are a loan dot in nearly every measurable. So they muddy all data post 2000.
Chargers,fogoa6r,t1_fognsy7,1587755067.0,"Is he? With Chris Harris playing the nickel now, we assumed Des would be moved to adrian Philips role at lb/safety hybrid. But now that we drafted murray, I expect Kizir White to be moved to that safety/hybrid role. 

Which puts Des only in on dime packages. He even lost his special teams job to Darius Jennings."
Chargers,fogn9r3,t1_fogl9l3,1587754728.0,"Does it? It's his last year on contract and his is a nickel cb, who regressed last year. To me a 2nd sounds about right."

Chargers,fofoks8,t3_g77z0i,1587740023.0,"Ya, I am expecting to see Desmond King traded today. I love the guy but after drafting Murray yesterday, I see Kizir White playing that nickel lb/safety/adrian Philips role that we thought Des would be playing.

Chargers,fofoanv,t3_g787ny,1587739876.0,"It does sound promising we will see him somewhere  even if does not be Reyshan Jenkins. Lynn says he is to talented and they will try him at different spots.
