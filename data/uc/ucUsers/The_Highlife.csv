Otherwise, nice work! Might consider rerouting the pre-burner exhaust in the full-flow diagram so that it's consistent with the staged-combustion diagram. In it's current form, the exhaust flow doesn't pass through the turbines.

Man I love this stuff."

Looks really good, too. Nice job!"

I have no other ideas on the matter but would love to be informed!"

SpaceXLounge,fmnlo9k,t1_fmij3u6,1586228980.0,"I feel a little cheated. I've been hugely fascinated with rotating stations like this for years. I never put pen to paper but my conceptual ideas were formed years ago and had a few distinct features that, until now and AFAIK, had never been explored. One was repeated inflatable modules, another was using cables like bicycle spokes to support the weight, and in my mind, trying to stabilize the C.M. through an outer tube of water and valves to control the flow and balance the station along it's central axis. Accelerometers in each module would be used to measure the location of the C.M.

Dang it. I would love to work on this if they were able to attract serious money, but right now I don't see it happening."
