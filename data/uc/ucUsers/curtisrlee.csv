UCSD,fp00se4,t3_ga76v1,1588200347.0,Just speculation but it could be DUO two factor. Cuz they send you push requests in real time.
UCSD,fp007bo,t3_gaecv8,1588200035.0,"I rejected UCLA because my engineering program (ECE) here is much better - there more interesting classes and more opportunities. The same can be said for other engineerings in general. And cog sci, a good example: UCSD basically invented cog sci, UCLA only got the major a couple years ago.

Plus, location is better."
UCSD,fn5u54f,t1_fn5cupv,1586675977.0,That sucks :(
UCSD,fn5cfvg,t3_fzmmwl,1586661268.0,The professor or TA can mute students. Ask them to consider muting the class while they are talking.
UCSD,fn1vuf1,t1_fn11zbp,1586571339.0,"as someone of Chinese ethnicity, I was paying close attention to the world around me. It's astonishing seeing Asian community set back decades from being America's precious model minority to a ""disease carrying race"" virtually overnight. I'm glad to be privileged enough to be able to shelter-in-place in a town where Asians are numerous enough to have political power and not have to deal.

I saw all the abandoned Chinese restaurants, saw all the people getting harassed and assaulted simply for being of Asian descent, and even the infant and toddler stabbed to death by a lunatic. If society is capable of such illogical bigotry towards a entire community, I can only imagine the potential threat to people who actually (may have) had COVID-19, especially back in mid-March.

To top it all off, I watched my own President attack a foreign government (a lying, abusive one which deserves it) but at the expense of my own community, and reading this article really gave me the exact same goosebumps. 

That's why i'm so triggered, but I do agree that the university absolutely sh\*t this one up. They should have offered the residents to transfer to another building, they should have given them info about the quarantine process, and most of all should have not lied."
UCSD,fn1tff4,t1_fn1sllw,1586569687.0,You have a point. I'm rather harsh on the guy. I think the real issue here just really boils down to unpreparedness and lack of information on multiple fronts.
UCSD,fn1shxg,t3_fythg4,1586569071.0,"Do not recommend CSE11. Can't take CSE8B or CSE12, those have prereqs.The rest just depends on what you want to get out of it.

* CSE3 is basically an IT class, showing you how computers work. should be easy as bricks
* CSE5A is an introductory C programming class, should be fairly easy as well.
* CSE8A is introductory Java class. 8A and 8B is basically just CSE11 split into two quarters for people with less/no experience.
* ECE15 is also introductory C programming class, but is much more rigorous than something like CSE5A. It will be harder but you will probably also squeeze a lot more knowledge out of it.
* MAE5 is also basically an IT class, as far as i'm aware (not too knowledgeable, just read course description)
* MAE8 is an introductory programming class but using MATLAB.
* never heard of the others

If you want the dead easiest just to satisfy a GE, probably CSE3, 5A or MAE5 will do. If you want to consider a CSE double major or minor, you should for sure do CSE8A (or CSE11, if you're okay with suffering). If you're considering something like mechanical or structural engineering then MAE8 will help you the most. Same for ECE and ECE15. It boils down to the prereqs that they will satisfy."

UCSD,fn1pumv,t1_fn0vskv,1586567340.0,"wholeheartedly agree. why is this downvoted? are people okay with ""othering"" patients and our brave health-care workers? It's crazy to me how we have so ability to obtain and access knowledge today, and yet some people still choose to rely on primal fears before educating themselves."
UCSD,fn1pc91,t1_fn0hy5i,1586567006.0,"I'm not sucking up to the admin, I fully agree the university screwed this up, not only they flat out lied, but  that they could have done countless things to be more transparent and reassure/educate the residents, without compromising the privacy of the patients.

The admin deserve to crash and burn for all I care, but not at the expense of the actual victims here. If the Guardian didn't give the platform to this crazy Sam dude, if the Guardian include a disclaimer to educate readers about the quarantine process, I wouldn't have any problem with it.

Actually, I reread the things again. and it seems that the article has actually been updated, and the initial claim that ""the university did not put out \*any\* notice at all"" has been rescinded. Yet they didn't bother to add any disclaimer, and that guy still has the soapbox.

This further proves my point that this article is just a sad, feeble attempt to slander the university by using COVID-19 victims as collateral damage. If they want to mobilize people to get angry at the university and demand accountability, then they should do it right. They should stick to the facts and logic, and not take advantage of ill-informed people's concerns and fears over COVID-19."
