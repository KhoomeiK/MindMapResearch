ucla,fo4sdd5,t3_g5ihjv,1587510289.0,"Okay not going to lie, I’m not sure what they were expecting trying to open a UCLA mall inside the campus. 

The stuff at the UCLA stores are extremely overpriced (as all college merchandise are) but most people buy 1-2 max unless you’re among the top 1% of rich kids or are in SAE. 

Although UCLA is highly populated, I can’t imagine anyone working at UCLA store ever saying “wow it’s so busy in here all the time, we need to expand”

They store is literally only busy on 3-4 specific days of the year such as “Bruin Day” when there are like 100k+ people on campus with intent to buy souvenirs. 

3-4 days of business does not justify a multi-level expansion of a college merchandise store"
