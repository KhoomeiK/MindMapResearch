berkeley,fpjhicv,t1_fpiwpus,1588668695.0,"Yep, honestly I wouldn’t recommend doing physics (or pure math, for that matter) unless you plan to go to grad school. The job market is not kind to those in the hard sciences"
berkeley,fp7po75,t1_fp7brz4,1588375228.0,"You have to pay for Chegg. Nobody is going to subscribe during a timed exam, so honest people wouldn't be tempted by this."
programming,fp4ge8i,t1_fp4f7b7,1588298477.0,That's fair
Physics,fp4g1ao,t1_fp4ej0z,1588298256.0,"Only insofar as it has no real world applications. Certainly there can be some benefits on the individual level (say, from enjoyment or a shift in perspective). I just don't think it's worth making it a requirement for everyone to do. Keep in mind though that it's not necessarily a bad thing to be pointless; many pure mathematicians pride themselves on doing research that is wholly useless."
berkeley,fp4dzom,t1_fp44gst,1588297020.0,I'm so happy I'm not CS
programming,fp4dp1s,t1_fp49kxx,1588296844.0,"You have a nonstandard definition of what constitutes research. I would say research encompasses both any experimental data collected and any results gleaned from that data. In theoretical fields such as math, there aren't any notebooks or logs to share. The only thing that is produced is a paper. So it wouldn't make any sense to say that papers are not research, because otherwise you'd be saying that mathematicians do not do research, which is absurd.  

At any rate, the intent of laws requiring publicly funded research to be freely available is to ensure that the fruits of such research (aka papers) are available to the public."
Physics,fp4aian,t1_fp2fiqb,1588294960.0,"I disagree. Knowing philosophy does not concretely make anyone a better scientist. If you wanted to add a nontechnical class to the standard undergraduate curriculum, a course on technical writing would be a far better pick than a pointless philosophy class."
programming,fp48o6i,t1_fp2e9c0,1588293911.0,Email is the preferred means of communication between scientists. Papers most definitely are research
labrats,fp479q9,t1_fp3q6ct,1588293100.0,That’s horrifying
berkeley,fou01wn,t3_g9kl76,1588072132.0,Math 160 fulfills the historical breadth
berkeley,fordu6q,t3_g95hmi,1588010537.0,A C will tank your grad school prospects much harder than a P (esp this semester). I would take at least that class P/NP and maybe any other class that you’ll get below a B+ in
learnmath,fopi0lz,t3_g8qgdn,1587962010.0,You should read through real analysis and linear algebra text books meant for math majors. I highly recommend Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis and Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right
berkeley,foojybg,t3_g8llsv,1587940458.0,"CS and physics is a very common double major. If you manage your time well, you can have a decent social life and still have time for research.

The physics 5 series is tough, but it’s overall better than the 7 series IMO. You will also get to know people in your cohort, which is valuable.

I would recommend learning linear algebra over the summer if are not already familiar with it, since it comes up everywhere."
berkeley,fod29m0,t3_g6sodf,1587678956.0,Lab classes are low key better because the workload is reduced 5x
math,fo8z79s,t1_fo8xgd8,1587606976.0,I would argue that quantum mechanics is a real world application in and of itself.
math,fo8ysdi,t1_fo8vcxz,1587606717.0,"To quote from the introduction:

> A concept  is effective in the sense of SIERPISKI if it does not require the axiom of choice AC. Here we  show by means of examples that fundamental notions of quantum theory are not effective. 

> ...

 >Hence the very notion of a self-adjoint operator as an observable of quantum theory may become meaningless without the axiom of choice."
math,fo8pekp,t3_g6c0ym,1587601142.0,I think the current formulation of quantum mechanics does rely on AC. See: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/malq.19960420128
math,fo6bdcj,t1_fo60t05,1587553517.0,"If you get into a top school, they will make sure you can attend. For instance, those with a family income of less than 90k have to pay 0 tuition at MIT. Many other schools have similar policies."
math,fo69qdp,t1_fo6327u,1587551831.0,The problems linked in the above comment are pretty similar to the ones done in my freshmen physics classes.
berkeley,fnpsrfz,t1_fnps6g2,1587151325.0,"It's pretty self contained, if you are familiar with linear algebra you should be fine"
berkeley,fnn2ha4,t3_g2qetd,1587083002.0,"I think the best order is 110, 113/104, 128A/185."
berkeley,fnkfiox,t3_g291jp,1587025119.0,"I think the most relevant math classes are 104, 110, 113, 185. Most physics majors probably take 110 + at least 1 of the others. 55 is really not needed for anything provided that you are good enough at proofs. 

CS classes are always useful.

Really, all technical classes in math, CS, Physics, Stats, etc. are going to be useful one way or another. I think the best thing to do is to take classes purely on interest rather than some vague notion of career applicability."
berkeley,fni41w1,t3_g1bbov,1586973614.0,"Perhaps this will be useful (188 used to be a special topics course, 151): https://phy151-ucb.github.io/seljak-phy151-fall-2018/#course-syllabus"
berkeley,fni2s1d,t3_g1wmva,1586973004.0,I think generally you ask the professor regardless. I know some professors ask the GSI to essentially ghostwrite it if they don't really know you.
Piracy,fngsker,t1_fngoxu6,1586943379.0,"I think you’re overestimating how often authors self archive their papers. Many fields don’t actually use ArXiv at all. 

Also, it’s often actually illegal for the author to share the pdf with you by email, since they don’t own the copyright to the paper (this varies from journal to journal, though). It’s messed up.

Sci-Hub is an incredibly important service, especially to those with fewer resources (e.g., universities in third world countries which cannot afford the journal subscription fee)"
berkeley,fngrgae,t3_g1ituu,1586942198.0,"Personally, I think the only math honors class worth taking is H113. The rest are pointlessly difficult/don’t cover the same material"
berkeley,fnc92sb,t1_fnbr2bv,1586831268.0,"Who did you take 113 with? I had Vaintrob who was really nice and a great lecturer but the class made me feel like Algebra was an incredibly dull field. Everything worked out so nice and tidy, there wasn’t much nuance"
berkeley,fnc8oir,t3_g0qees,1586831020.0,"Favorite:

Math 118, what an amazing class. Strain is probably the funniest lecturer I’ve ever had. The content was also super interesting, and the grade was mostly problem sets so there wasn’t huge amounts of pressure on the exams. 10/10 would recommend

Math 224A, similar to above. Interesting material coupled with no exams makes a really great learning experience IMO. Also the prof was pretty engaging and helpful at OH. 

Least favorite:

Physics 111A. This class is such a grind, it low key made me want to drop physics entirely. The only saving grace is that it’s somewhat interesting. 

Physics 5A. This class was so pointlessly hard and annoying. I couldn’t be bothered to care about all these dull mechanics problems

Physics 5BL. It’s 111A except the content was boring as hell and the time commitment was lower."
berkeley,fnc6vbm,t1_fnbqgwf,1586829887.0,"I’m not sure how I feel about Sug Woo’s Math 110 class. It was incredibly computational and skipped some topics (did we ever do Jordan normal forms?). 

OTOH that class convinced me to change my math minor into a full major so it wasn’t all bad

What did you like about him?"
EngineeringStudents,fn33jiu,t1_fn2ichf,1586611919.0,Fair enough
EngineeringStudents,fn2gg2t,t1_fn2eu68,1586588118.0,"It definitely is, the average starting salary for CS majors at my school is 110k, and it’s not unheard of to get 200k+ TC"

berkeley,fn0ei5q,t1_fn0a0bm,1586540460.0,"There are Physics @ Berkeley shirts/hoodies you can get. I got mine on Calday, but allegedly you can also get them from the department office in LeConte"
berkeley,fmknqsd,t1_fmkkckr,1586161555.0,"It’s definitely worth taking if you’re interested in the material and potentially theoretical physics as well. But many physics classes tend to brush aside technical analysis details, so I’m not sure if it will be directly applicable in physics grad classes (theorists generally take math grad classes as well, which is why it’s pretty crucial for them). 

Still, even if you never directly use the content it’s a valuable class nonetheless, since it helps your mathematical maturity and proof-writing ability."
berkeley,fmkk5fe,t3_fvu1b7,1586157743.0,It's an important class iff you're a theorist imo
