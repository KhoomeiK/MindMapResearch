ucla,fpiwc7s,t3_gdpk2j,1588650251.0,"had 20B with beren. honestly just a more in depth version of high school chemistry. basically half the class is just pv=nrt

as an elective it wouldn’t be that bad unless u hate chem"
ucla,fpi84v2,t1_fpi6zp1,1588635574.0,sick. glad to hear that. especially since I already voted for u this morning
ucla,fpfn2px,t3_gd6jon,1588576464.0,"never really thought about it before until reading this. can’t count how many times i’ve heard representatives and candidates talk about diversity, representation, and services but never seen much talking about improving big problems with south campus"
ucla,fpcjn26,t3_gco7gp,1588503021.0,"make sure the courses are equivalent through whatever ucla department it is for. after that u just enroll at whatever UC, usually they have a guest account sign up for that

summer financial aid app is on myucla w more details. u can only get financial aid over summer for 1 program. so either only aid for ucla summer sessions or only for aid at a different uc"
ucla,fp90m5z,t3_gc2mzn,1588409747.0,letter grade to pass it and u can just retake the class if you get a C- or lower
ucla,fp8v2w1,t3_gc1lwe,1588403986.0,in engineering as long as you have a real interest in your major than you will no doubt be able to do it. sometimes time consuming and a bitch ( definitely still able to have a social life) sometimes u take classes u like and it makes it worth it
ucla,fov07aw,t3_g9qfu3,1588093253.0,gonna start seeing more guys go to G league over college ball like him
ucla,fog7lhm,t1_fofvk1j,1587748958.0,"if i’m taking classes in C session too, should I be worried about that two week overlap with 103 or do u think it’s manageable?

it’d overlap w Physics 1C and 4BL"
ucla,fnitchd,t1_fniry7t,1586986011.0,"yea unless you come in with i think it’s 46+ units then you’ll still be in your grade’s window and get a random time

also forgot APush or AP gov test fulfills the American History requirement"
ucla,fniobh0,t1_fninlnz,1586983471.0,"for graduation there’s a list of classes you need to fulfill and by doing that you’ll have plenty of units to graduate 

sorry, do u mean eligibility as in acceptance to ucla or what?"
ucla,fnin9ng,t3_g1zz5z,1586982951.0,"Calc BC- can skip Math 31A, 31B
Physics C- can skip Physics 1A

at orientation they say be careful skipping but if u got scores high enough to, then i’d recommend it

the rest can only go towards units which don’t matter for engineering"
ucla,fmklipi,t3_fvszbd,1586159164.0,we also don’t know how it reacts throughout seasons. like influenza hotter seasons help not spread it. however we don’t know yet how or if hot or cold affect it
ucla,fm3khz6,t1_fm35hbo,1585726744.0,obv don’t think stuff like that’s funny. and it is definitely fucked up. just more talking about 20 posts  clogging the feed basically saying the same thing about less serious zoom pranks
