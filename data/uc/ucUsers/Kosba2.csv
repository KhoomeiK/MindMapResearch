KimetsuNoYaiba,fpm9lyp,t1_fpm4ubl,1588728376.0,"> hello? do you even watch the show? literally every single character feels the same way about demons. the idea is that they deserve torture for the amount of people that they've killed. ???

And to be fair, I greatly disliked every Pillar besides Tomioka when they were introduced"
discordapp,fpkztxi,t3_ge26zp,1588703889.0,Are you on a server? You might have been server muted by the admin.
MonsterHunterWorld,fpku27a,t1_fpjhgip,1588701038.0,"Yeah uh, it's still infinitely more useful than a joke, even if it got nerfed. It's a completely better Vitality Mantle for starters. It's a sidegrade to the Rockystead mantle, for example aerial attacks do not get interrupted (priceless for Hammer). Flinchshots, or just increasing DPS by allowing reckless abandon. So few enemies have consecutive attacks that'll chew through it, and even then that's more on the player for being in that situation. No mantle will last well if you take multihit moves."
MonsterHunterWorld,fpiczjl,t1_fpia20m,1588638373.0,"Yeah I can make it slightly more visible with some simple (scary) math (not necessarily for you, but anyone else who might want it).

`stuntime = get_up_animation + stun_actual + clap_cheeks_animation`

Let's label them A = get_up_animation , B = stun_actual, C = clap_cheeks_animation, so we get

`stuntime = A + B + C`

The first two ranks of stun resist do not affect A or C, those are static length, but it does affect B. So lets pretend A takes 3 seconds, and C takes 1 second, this isn't too accurate, but it's just there to demonstrate a point. Also say B is 5 seconds default

`stuntime = 3 + 5 + 1`

By default, 9 seconds.

If we get Stun Resist 2, which is a 90% reduction iirc (which translates to 10% of 5, which is 0.5), then we have

`stuntime = 3 + 0.5 + 1`

With Stun 2, 4.5 seconds. So from the big picture, closer to 50% stun reduction if those were the numbers. 

tl;dr: Skill only reduces part of formula for stun time"
MonsterHunterWorld,fphrlyb,t1_fpg93wz,1588626531.0,"Doesn't help when that only applies to like 40% of the animation time, it's why having Stun Resistance unmaxed sucks"
