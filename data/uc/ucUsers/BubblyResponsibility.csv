cscareerquestions,fplcwo5,t1_fplcha3,1588710463.0,It's reality though. Watch how these laid-off engineers are going to be hit with hards in their upcoming interviews
UCSD,fpiv47a,t1_fpd04pz,1588649424.0,"This is why it's harder to get into Cornell. Really no other reason, maybe apart from the Ivy tag"
UCSD,fpiv1v6,t1_fpbft2k,1588649382.0,Go to Cornell if you have the $$. Public schools are a scam and you'll run into the same issues again at UCLA and UCB
UCSD,fpiuvro,t1_fpdu4ne,1588649268.0,More like only east Asians do this than South Asians. You'll probably find <10 East Asian FOBS hanging out with other races at social events as compared to hundreds of South Asians hanging out with other races at social events.
UCSD,fpiuok0,t1_fpbt42q,1588649132.0,"There are some TAs I know who have copied their asses off on homework assignments and now that they're TAs they think they're the shit.

I've also seen TAs in the CSE department refuse to explain concepts as if it's like giving the homework answer away. A TA's job is to teach class material, and help me out with whatever it is as long as there's no disclosure of homework answers."
gradadmissions,fpf7zqe,t1_fpehg6q,1588563998.0,"Nice! From your post history, since you’re an Asian in Canada, do you need to visit the US embassy back in your country to get your visa? Or is just a I20 transfer required?"
cscareerquestions,fp8eu7l,t3_ejrpid,1588390520.0,"Hey, what were your scores like if you don't mind me asking?"
cscareerquestions,fp56ski,t1_fp53pyx,1588318274.0,well for my interviews if i dont have fully functional code i get rejected so i guess its nbd to learn how to implement a priority queue
cscareerquestions,fp3xmyw,t1_fp3wdi5,1588287721.0,"Yea, Practice writing a priority queue a couple of times and it becomes fairly straightforward"
cscareerquestions,fp3mgls,t1_fp3lu3i,1588281901.0,I never mentioned that ALL interviewers are like this. I’m saying that this occurs more often than people think.
cscareerquestions,fp3kks2,t1_fp3im48,1588280938.0,"Then can you explain why my google interviewer was 15 minutes late and asked me a medium which I know I had the optimal solution to, only to get grilled about why I declared my function as a static function? He kept bashing me over that tiny aspect which I overlooked and I got rejected for god knows what. 
This must be happening all across the board. Hiring managers have no idea whether their team member was late to an interview or not. Hiring managers also don’t know how many hints an interviewer might be providing for a hard. In my experience last week, my interviewers never even gave me ONE hint. I understand that for mediums and easies that might be normal but for hards?"
cscareerquestions,fp3bkbj,t1_fp3b141,1588276454.0,"No, you do have the knowledge. Just keep working on your interviewing skills. There are people at FAANG companies that just want to boost their egos on a daily basis, maybe because they can't find happiness elsewhere."
cscareerquestions,fp3aku3,t1_fp39o4p,1588275966.0,"I so agree with this. The current interview process at tech companies just disregards your prior experience and only focuses on how well you have memorized solutions on Leetcode.

I'd rather give my interviewer a blowjob than try to impress him with my leetcode hard solving abilities"
cscareerquestions,fp3afbg,t1_fp39trc,1588275891.0,"Yup, and all these fools that ask Leetcode hards will probably tell you that they never memorized any solutions and that they were ""smart enough"" to solve it inside 20 minutes with no hints."
cscareerquestions,fp38u84,t1_fp36rhh,1588275098.0,"That' good. I just had an interview with snap and had 25 minutes to solve an unseen hard. 

Sucks when interviewers want to fuck you over for nothing, maybe they hate your race or something"
cscareerquestions,fp0ds57,t1_fp0bzk4,1588207319.0,Wasn't only referring to fb but yeah that's definitely true for fb
cscareerquestions,fp09lk1,t1_fp04mxo,1588205060.0,"I've been doing mock interviews. I think the worst part is I've been getting too many unseen leetcode hards, and there's always something small about my code that's fucking up my chances of passing."
cscareerquestions,fozqy5q,t1_foygofv,1588195320.0,"How do you develop skills to handle all this? I’ve had a rough recruiting season and I just don’t think I’m good enough anymore. 
I get asked some harder hard and the interviewer won’t bother giving me a hint. On a couple of occasions, I’ve been so tempted to just ask the interviewer if he’d be able to solve this himself in 20 mins if he hadn’t seen this before."
cscareerquestions,forxfq7,t3_g8vq2g,1588020204.0,What’s the general consensus on solving hards in an interview? I had 20 mins from the time the interviewer pasted and explained the hard question. I had the right approach but couldn’t fully finish coding
cscareerquestions,fop49cu,t3_g8q2n7,1587952743.0,"Caltech. But get ready to study 24x7x365 because Caltech is one of the most rigorous schools out there. 

If you're someone who might not be able to handle this, go to UMich. Equally good chance of a FAANG offer from there and there's some culture at that college"
cscareerquestions,foov5az,t3_g89zwr,1587947127.0,"Leetcoding sucks. I think companies should just give interviews to fewer candidates and ask Mediums to then filter some people out. These days if you've done something useful in your college career (with good internships, coursework etc) but you can't solve a leetcode hard in an interview setting you're so done for."
cscareerquestions,fnbgt0h,t1_fnbbjjj,1586815275.0,"What about for onsites? I usually do well on phone screens but never do well on onsites, where I'll choke in 1-2 interviews which are enough to ruin my chances."
cscareerquestions,fn834gc,t1_fn7nf7b,1586732894.0,Any tips for leetcode prep? I'm good with Mediums but definitely not with hards lol
sandiego,fn589bd,t3_fp9c80,1586658314.0,"How hard is it going to be to drive from SD to SF this weekend? I am relocating and while I can arrange for food and water from some grocery store, where can I stop to use the restroom given that fast food restaurants are not accepting people inside their properties? I'm new to driving in the country, so please pardon me if I don't know anything that's pretty obvious. Thanks!"
OMSCS,flwhxbt,t1_flwhq2z,1585551285.0,"Nope, not in order. Just wanted to make sure I’m not taking crazy classes every semester and that my coursework is well balanced out."
