I sent a message to financial aid through Cal Central and they responded within a few days telling me my financial aid would be fine, but I think it varies based on your own situation. However, I am ahead on units because I've taken several summer classes."

BackToCollege,fohfk6n,t3_g6zets,1587765094.0,"I attended 4 different community colleges, failed several classes, and even a vocational college. I was able to make up for the past Fs, and get a great GPA. This time last year, I was accepted as a transfer student to all the state universities I applied to, including one that is notoriously difficult to get into, UC Berkeley. When I graduate next Spring, I will be 40. It is never too late, and definitely not pointless. 

As mentioned, see what resources your current school offers, and also check with the university you want to attend to see what programs they have available. Some have programs for non-traditional, re-entry students, first generation college students,  underrepresented minorities, student parents, who want to transfer and may have bigger hurdles than other students."
berkeley,foe4ot5,t3_g6ee2q,1587695963.0,"I requested a July 1 move in date, with kids though, last year. We got a mid July move in. My neighbors moved in around the same time, and they don't have kids. We both started in Fall. I applied around this time last year, and I think I got an offer in like mid-May. 

I do see a lot of people moving out, and with Fall semester potentially being online, who knows if more people will move out soon. I don't know of a source for other local properties, unfortunately, but sometimes people post them to the Facebook pages for transfers. 

Good luck, I hope you get a housing offer!"

She's a transfer counselor, so she also has helpful info on her site."

berkeley,fo1qooj,t1_fo1pnyu,1587439256.0,"I've taken two proseminars. I love them, but they're a  LOT of reading.

Standard lectures are more difficult than a CC, but you adapt. The best part is how interesting they are, so it's easy to stay focused (so far at least). 

The transition is challenging. I am happy did the Transfer Edge program last summer. It helped me get a sense of what was expected and how classes would go. But, it's totally doable. 

I will warn you about discussion seminars. On the one hand, you learn a lot, and they can be helpful. On the other, it can be a lot of work to prepare for that week's discussion section. How so? In lecture, especially the bigger classes, the professor just lectures. So, you can possibly get away without reading the stuff for that week. In section, you'll discuss, in detail usually, what you read, what you thought about it, etc. Hard to BS your way through that. Also, they are run by the GSI for your class, who also grade your work. 

First semester, I'd say do like 2 history classes, maybe one with a discussion section. Then go from there. Personally, I made a decision to be easy on myself my first semester, because I have heard how rough it can be, but I did ok. Ask for help if you need it, like from the SLC or your GSIs. Good luck, you can do it!"
berkeley,fo199pd,t3_g4458g,1587428374.0,"I'm a history major. I started last summer. I like it so far. Interesting classes and professors. I haven't had problems getting into the courses I need and I really like the undergrad advisor, who is very helpful and knowledgeable. I'm going to graduate on time, next Spring. 

What questions do you have?"

berkeley,fmq0jg3,t3_fwpnvg,1586290678.0,"Serious earthquakes happen very rarely. Most that occur just feel like a little bit of shaking, kind of like a large semi-truck rolling by, maybe the blinds will shake a bit, but that's it. If you decide to come here, you can also check out the ratings for the buildings the classes for your major tend to be in. For example, most of my major classes are in Dwinelle, which is rated a III (Good).  I known its hard to reason with fear, but as a life long Californian, I can tell you that earthquakes are not as big of an experience you may think."

I am still doing all the course work, but it's a huge weight off my shoulders to not worry about whether or not I get As.  I plan to go to law school, and GPAs matter for admissions."
