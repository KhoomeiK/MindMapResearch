Minecraft,fpbuztk,t1_fpae6aj,1588479421.0,Piglins have ears. Pigmen don’t. I just think of them as two different things for some reason
Minecraft,fpbupxs,t1_fpbl0qp,1588479215.0,"Considering the number of volatile elements in the nether it makes sense. It’s easier to make explosions fit into a large barrel than a controlled small gun barrel. And maybe the materials in the nether are simply too explosive that handheld guns are too dangerous. Or maybe they are like the Covenant from halo, preferring to use swords even with the availability of guns."
Minecraft,fpale4r,t1_fpak5vm,1588450565.0,I was thinking if Sora no Woto (Sound of the Sky) when writing my comment (if you know what I’m talking about then you get the irony) but yeah warhammer too
Minecraft,fpa3ifh,t3_gc86k8,1588440069.0,When you only still use swords but manage to invent tanks. But maybe it’s the classic case of having access to usable lost advanced tech but unable to reproduce it. So they lost their tech to make guns but at least they have a functioning tank from when they were advanced in the past.
Cornell,fpa1pmw,t3_gbq1rt,1588439033.0,"Does it matter when you get your good grades? If you’re pre med if just have to ace everything anyways so it doesn’t matter based on your reasoning.

Just find out which classes are hard and which are easy and try to spread them out, and don’t assume lower divs are easier."
Cornell,fpa1gaj,t1_fp7aezh,1588438886.0,"I’m in a major where upper divs are easier than lower ones, and I took them first (since I wanted to determine my interest). 

But as a transfer as well as starting off with classes with grad students as he majority it is hard to meet people you can regularly talk too. Ironically one of my classmates was my TA in another class."
Cornell,fp4dtbo,t1_fp32ixg,1588296915.0,College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Specifically the ag part. Chances are you basically go to a different school from me
Cornell,fp4cwwr,t1_fp4agi2,1588296377.0,"I’m in one of the easiest majors here that’s why. College was hard in other ways besides academics though, but high school for me was hell."
Cornell,fp2pn70,t3_gaxhrc,1588265783.0,"Depends on the AP class. But for me HS as a whole was many times harder than Cornell academically, at least in terms of workload. However my grades as approximately the same."
Cornell,fopyu00,t3_g8ldns,1587976805.0,"Regardless of the topics, I think Cornell is closer to the luck of the draw category than the overachieving category. 

While I’m not too knowledgeable about the other schools listed here, University of California (UC) schools are what I think are grind schools where hard stats are more important than at somewhere like Cornell. Got waitlisted by UC Davis with their 40% acceptance rate but got Transfer Option at Cornell."
Cornell,fonrydo,t3_g8ixe9,1587925293.0,Just give it time this is Cornell after all
ucla,foer74c,t3_g6wv2g,1587711994.0,I just listen to lecture recordings at 2x speed after skipping through nonsense and nonessentials while making mods for Kenshi
UPenn,fo86bdf,t3_g5rg0k,1587590678.0,Cornell has many rural students but I never see them really say anything about Cornell online and on Reddit despite seeing them in class.
Cornell,fo409ax,t3_g56yij,1587495975.0,My younger bro is more pro than me in every way including academics and gpa but he goes to UCSD now. Idk if there is tension but then he’s still more pro so it’s not really his fault
UPenn,fo3ovv3,t3_g5h68x,1587490519.0,They can’t tell if you are or not though unless you say so
UPenn,fo3oset,t1_fo3khvz,1587490474.0,I think that is representative of Cornell depending on which college you’re in. Meanwhile it seems like my peeps in the ag school are relatively unstressed but I’m stressed even with relatively little work since I’m allergic to school
Kenshi,fo3oac0,t3_g5c94t,1587490232.0,Now we need to take the portrait of Beep’s head and attach it to his body
Kenshi,fo29l9h,t3_g55xbx,1587454221.0,This is common
Kenshi,fo0qaju,t1_fo0q3ty,1587417787.0,That makes sense. Imagine putting iron spider arms on that thing. I know there’s an old mod out there for that.
CrusaderKings,fo0q50k,t1_fnzivq3,1587417705.0,Dont they get a new house generated for them normally? Like if you give a lowborn a holding they get a new house
Kenshi,fo0pyv0,t1_fo0puez,1587417612.0,Isn’t the praetorians normal limbs stronger than robotic ones though
Kenshi,fo0pptu,t3_g4sjzh,1587417480.0,"That’s kinda disturbing, those robotic zombies."

Kenshi,fnxnoz3,t1_fnx7tii,1587342485.0,I tried to start a colony in Gut and mine the iron trees but everyone died
Kenshi,fnxnnat,t1_fnx7tii,1587342456.0,"I made a start where you have a bunch of hive colonists with starter gear you can find it as Hive Colonist Start on the Steam Workshop. It’s basically like the vanilla Nobodies start but with hivers and you start in a hive village. 

But I think I might have made you allied to the western hive since the story I wrote it was you are colonists sent by the queen."
Kenshi,fnwlqyb,t1_fnwl3el,1587320810.0,I did not realize that was a text bubble lol
Cornell,fnwkeux,t3_g4b0hd,1587320070.0,If you want something more hands on you should get your own plants though
Cornell,fnwk6n6,t3_g4b0hd,1587319944.0,"PLBRG 2010 - Plants, Genes, and Global Food Production: this is like the intro plant breeding class and gives an overview of the topic (I’m taking it last for my minor ironically) (Easy)

PLBRG 4030 - Plant Breeding? (Forgot official name, something straightforward like this): More detailed and most students are grad level, basic concepts about how to do plant breeding. (Moderate)

PLBRG 4070 - Nutritional Improvement of Crop Plants: 2 units, you learn about biofortifcation in which plants are bred to have better nutrition, such as high carotenoid corn for use in Africa. (Easy)"
Kenshi,fnwji2y,t3_g49p55,1587319564.0,How is he differentiated from an average hive worker though
Cornell,fntvfx0,t3_g3pytu,1587249353.0,Cornell based on my experience is filled with average people whatever average is
Kenshi,fnt90p0,t3_g3r5ye,1587236948.0,It looks inspired by Tatooine from Star Wars
CrusaderKings,fnt5v1n,t1_fnt2uh8,1587235199.0,Don’t people get a random one if they have no guardian?
ucla,fnsz36x,t3_g3r31w,1587231527.0,While not a credible source (myself) I would recommend not taking “important” or “core” classes P/NP. They probably won’t care if you take fun or stupid classes P/NP but they might care about chemistry.
Kenshi,fnsyobo,t3_g3jvzh,1587231305.0,Wait I thought early game is the best part? After you get all op and stuff it gets boring
CrusaderKings,fnlkvut,t1_fnkcqrq,1587055281.0,I couldn’t finish my playthrough
CrusaderKings,fnjbq5i,t1_fnjbmrp,1586995773.0,Whoops yeah you’re right I got confused
CrusaderKings,fnj7lj1,t3_g22ny0,1586993485.0,"Firstly, when you have an army selected, there is a small arrow on the right part of the blue box above the three flanks if you didn’t know.

Second, fight where your troops have an advantage (defend against enemies on a mountain for example.

Third if you have Legacy of Rome and retinues, in some cases it is better to have your retinue entirely on its own flank arranging it when you open up the flank menu. The main point is to maintain troop type purity, which allows better tactics to be used. Pure camel cavalry is supposedly good and it seemed to work well when I used them.

Leading your troops yourself gives moral boost to troops."

CrusaderKings,fni2l67,t1_fnhwf2j,1586972912.0,Is absolute cognatic inheritance in Ck2 for certain religions? Or the closest is equal between men and women?
CrusaderKings,fni1lur,t3_g1o42k,1586972440.0,MR is super OP.
Cornell,fni1fyl,t3_g1asuz,1586972363.0,If it is one question you can send an email
CrusaderKings,fni0kwl,t1_fnhzc3l,1586971948.0,"I have a theory about this specific case. Since the pope is hard coded to not be able to marry, he can’t make sons to inherit by iqta. But a relative could, so the way to confirm this is to check if his heir is related or a person that would only inherit by iqta. However this pope also has another kingdom level title so that might mess things up."

Cornell,fnbskh9,t1_fnbk7bp,1586821482.0,China blocked Zoom a while ago. Joint classes had problems since they needed to find a new replacement. Idk if they unblocked it recently but maybe they don’t want to be spied on lol.
CrusaderKings,fn7fmw2,t1_fn5pzoj,1586719376.0,"Currently playing a Nestorian Aladdin run. He was a Abbasid vassal most of the game in multiple runs (since I had to restart) (not sure how many times). In my current playthrough the Abbasids collapsed and he was freed. 

It’s hilarious since he frequently gets a honorary position, I have pics of the patriarch as court musician, food tester, and most frequently commander."

Cornell,fn7b0f3,t1_fn4xjvo,1586716778.0,"Prepare to be incinerated in LA. Though lately the weather here has been mild, though during my childhood almost every summer the heat record was broken. 110+ degrees Fahrenheit is not uncommon in the summer. If your skin and respiratory system is sensitive to dry air you don’t want to be here.

LA actually has many nice new Mixed Zoning development going on and is improving surprisingly so maybe it’s worth considering."
Cornell,fn7amoa,t1_fn3zsph,1586716562.0,Are you in CALS?
Cornell,fn7akuq,t1_fn4ut3c,1586716534.0,I’m already waiting to live life. Don’t want to wait any longer
UPenn,fn7ae88,t3_g01l67,1586716431.0,"You don’t but then you will have to compete with fellow students who will have a higher total gpa due to ap classes counting as 5 points for an A. Since admissions are regionally based it also depends on what is the “meta” in your area. Like I came from a area with lots of tryhards so I have to have enough aps to be comparable to them. However, I would think an Ivy like Penn would put greater weight on other things more so than schools like UCLA."
CrusaderKings,fn3wmc6,t3_fz2ulq,1586629353.0,Are mongols even a threat? They never seem like one normally
Cornell,fn3r37j,t3_fz6yf1,1586626272.0,Somewhere in East Asia. Going to law school (in the US) after Cornell first though
Cornell,fn3qomi,t3_fz1eiq,1586626046.0,Finally some memes that fit Cornell’s online persona
CrusaderKings,fn3qi1o,t3_fz29q5,1586625945.0,Wait isn’t this the majority of your vassals every time you want to pass things like increase vassal taxes?
CrusaderKings,fn0n0oa,t1_fn0mgc6,1586544947.0,"They control Yemen and Abbysynia, though Egypt is controlled by Catholics. Also do I need a dlc to join the assassins? I turned of China’s aggressive expansion just cuz I lost a previous Aladdin run when China took me over."
CrusaderKings,fn0m79z,t3_fyemx6,1586544516.0,I reformed the African faith before but unfortunately I wasn’t on Ironman but then I never used the past saves either...
CrusaderKings,fn0kj3p,t3_fyemx6,1586543624.0,"Struggling with Aladdin run now since I can’t break through the abbasids that take up the whole middle section of the map... and the Chinese fell to the Jurchens when I finally had enough grace, losing years and years of gold and grace."
CrusaderKings,fmz9w9v,t1_fmz593w,1586512201.0,They used to have event troops or something when mongol territory was off map or something?  The tribal mongols in my game just behave like a normal nation. Hopefully my kingdom of Qinghai and the Mongols (my fellow Nestorians) can fight off the Abbasids if they decide to conquer my part of the map as they basically have the entire middle chunk.
CrusaderKings,fmz9qhu,t3_fy8iim,1586512015.0,"They have never been significant ever in any playthrough at all. There’s a lot of online documentation about this too. However I don’t have horse lords and they are a bunch of tribals, idk if this makes then not a threat."
Cornell,fmz8l0j,t3_fy0xcj,1586510673.0,"I think what they mean is that it will replace things like grants, loans, ws. And you keep the extra."
CrusaderKings,fmyh6ck,t1_fmxhh14,1586486078.0,I saved up 5000 grace and was ready for my new age of conquest but China fell to Jurchens and I didn’t get to spend it all since I was hoping China would prevail. I lost so much revenue by being tributary too.
CrusaderKings,fmwv054,t1_fmw0kao,1586453515.0,Yeah but I have to buy the dlc lol
Cornell,fmvea30,t3_fxk2ul,1586414011.0,Time to switch to S/U

CrusaderKings,fmt5nqy,t1_fmsooaf,1586367258.0,I was doing that during an Aladdin run (Duke of Jiuqian) and was about to celebrate doubling my land but ended up giving my vassal an independent duchy plus the one county I gave him and had to conquer it back.

ucla,fmpi8c0,t3_fwbzcm,1586281300.0,Organized education and the job market are all Battle Royales lol
CrusaderKings,fmpgwm8,t3_fwdv9i,1586280623.0,"This can be fixed. Since your pope is in Alexandria, a disease hotbed, get a temple and put your pope in it away from the disease. Your MA might take some hits since you can’t get your pope’s piety up if he keeps dying. 

And based on experience the popes will help in defensive how’ve wars, showing up the the party with disproportionately large armies (since they can hire mercs). If you have a holy site put the pope in the bishopric there to get an extra 5% MA on top of the normal 10%."
Cornell,fmcfcue,t1_fmc86g4,1585944589.0,I’m in CALS so I am not a credible source. But if it’s something you would think they deem as “important” then it would be better to take it for a letter grade if possible.
