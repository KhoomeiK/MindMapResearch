Rialto,fo1rst8,t3_g55kyw,1587440004.0,"Nightlife is non existent. You would have to go to downtown Riverside ~25 minutes to find a decent pub. Other than that, lots of crackheads. The 10 gets pretty packed and I would avoid taking it if you're heading west. You're better off taking the 210 ."
ucla,fnul4vb,t1_fnuktza,1587264712.0,"Oh, you will reach that limit , trust! And UCLA clout is nice when looking for a job. There is a difference when employers see that email handle in my experience (been out of school for a year) . I'm cheap, so yeah
You could also check the box that allows you to access your account the entire day"
ucla,fnuknsc,t1_fnukg3z,1587264384.0,"I mean, unlimited Google drive? If you don't like free stuff, then be my guest , I guess??"
ucla,fnu70qe,t1_fnu6fgk,1587255837.0,That was literally all his campaign was. Even dressed as a hotdog on bruinwalk. Doesn't get any more complex than that
ucla,fnt9yis,t3_g3m2yi,1587237478.0,"I still have duo installed as a postgrad. I actively use my UCLA email, which has unlimited Google drive storage. It's not annoying, get over it"
ucla,fnt63eg,t1_fnqe548,1587235328.0,"You're passion is misplaced, and you should redirect it towards your post-grad career as opposed to gaining elitist clout at ULCA, which no one cares about."
ucla,fnt4hh2,t3_g3qwtt,1587234444.0,"During my time at UCLA, a buddy of mine ran for usac president and his platform was to disband USAC. I think this idea is worth visiting again, considering how pointless student politics is."

mexico,fnn0h77,t1_fnmz4ss,1587081811.0,"De hecho eso fue unos de mis metas, pero en California! Yo nom√°s quiero ser trabajos para las personas de bajos recursos. De hecho orita estoy esperando empezar a trabajar en un banco de comida para inmigrantes. Ya tengo el 4x4 y era guardabosques para el bosque nacional de San Bernardino, pero la pandemia me dej√≥ desempleado üòµ
Agradezco demasiado sus perspectivas e informaci√≥n sobre vida profesional y pol√≠tica en M√©xico!"
