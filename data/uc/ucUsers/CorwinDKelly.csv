WritingPrompts,fma9cd1,t1_fm9l3cq,1585887238.0,"Wow. I'm really impressed, I can see your scenes and feel them in the way that good writing makes possible. I thought this line was really excellent:

>I suppose that I would have felt like an idiot, doing the same thing, inside closed doors. But everything in life takes a placid, palpable meaning, when it is near its end.

>I felt her undying love. At the hospital bed, knowingly waiting for  death, her thoughts and desires on me. Her silent prayers, her fears all  revolved around me. 

Thanks so much for sharing!"
