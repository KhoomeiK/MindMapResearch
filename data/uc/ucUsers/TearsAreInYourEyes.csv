This is good because you learn about what makes a person enjoy the qualities of that time. Say they like fall because it's chilly but not too cold, darker, and has special events. From this we can deduce that they come from a place that has hot summers so they enjoy a nice cool temp. Since they like the darker time, they probably are a homebody since it's cozier. They also said special events, so you could learn a bit more on why they like those events. Ideally, you would get the responses and go more in depth with it."

Although it looked a bit goofy, no one said anything. Other times I would wear something like [this](https://www.sheplers.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-master-product-catalog-shp/default/dw7b0a506f/images/A37/099A37_19_P1.JPG). No one commented on it besides my roommates, but that was it. No one is going to look down on you for wearing a hat. The only time someone would look down on you would be if you were wearing a political statement, but that's a different conversation."
