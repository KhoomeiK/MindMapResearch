AskReddit,fpinpmq,t3_gdhll9,1588644741.0,"Had to watch a suicide awareness video in high school and it was so cheesy. There was a scene where the 16/17 year old main character was struggling to get through the child safety lid on a bottle of pills in an attempt to kill herself. Next scene the mom walks in to find the teen sitting on the floor with the still closed bottle of pills in her hands and in the most pathetic voice goes ""i cant get it open..."" and i know it was supposed to be sad and dramatic but the acting was so corny and the idea of a 17 year old not being able to open a fucking prescription bottle was so funny that when my friend and i accidentally made eye contact we absolutely lost it. The room was dead silent but we were actually in tears laughing. Got in so much trouble and had to do a bunch of seminars after."

I almost feel like a dog or something in that I have no concept of time, did I see my boyfriend yesterday or last month? Who knows they effectively feel the same. I’m constantly exhausted, I have no energy. I feel like I start my days with negative spoons. Also I have nightmares, so while I’m lucky in that I don’t have insomnia or trouble falling asleep (usually) any sleep I get is poor quality. I slept for 18 hours the other day and that gave me enough energy to feel normal for about three hours, then I needed a nap. Also I constantly feel like an alien around most people. When I’m triggered I shut down and my brain gets stuck, almost on a loop, like a broken record, it’ll just repeat something random (word,phrase,sound) over and over again. Also I’ve had auditory hallucinations before and they sound so real, the human brain is crazy. 

Idk for me my memory is the most debilitating, it makes work or school extremely hard. Also it makes me sad that I can’t even remember when good things happen. I mean, I sort of can, but it’s like a vague, very loose knowledge that the thing happened. Sucks."

CPTSD,foea2am,t1_foe66xh,1587699102.0,I mean it’d be awkward for me if I don’t respond then run into her. I know (well I don’t *know*) she’s lowkey being gaslighty by pulling that shit then reaching out “apologizing” and extending the metaphorical olive branch so it makes me look like the asshole for ignoring her because she didn’t mean it and she even apologized she was just looking out for me (sarcasm) I really was fine with just ignoring her (all the drama happened pretty much exactly a year ago) but she’s randomly decided to “reach out”. Honestly I was fine with the way things were before cause it wasn’t obvious I didn’t like her but now I’m apprehensive that if I make it clear I don’t like her she’ll 100% act like the victim. I’ve told bf I don’t like her and he still thinks she was just looking out for me (LOL) but respects I don’t wanna be her friend. Problem is it’s a small town and I’ve had to move back cause college got shut down and she lives near me and I keep almost running into her. I just hate dealing with manipulative people like they’re so exhausting and good and playing victim. I’m tempted to just text back pretending to be fine with everything but I don’t wanna open the flood gates.

Coronavirus,fodjn4j,t1_fodimku,1587685518.0,"I’m aware, but there’s also a difference between lying though your teeth and convincing your followers you’re completely innocent and admitting to your wrong doings. Trump (or Biden) supporters can deflect by asserting the allegations are lies, you cannot do this for Newsom.

Coronavirus,fodfjfj,t1_foderow,1587684053.0,"Not sure which Clinton you’re referring to but either way the distinction is that they deny it, Newsom is upfront. The first two have “plausible deniability” and can claim that *insert political opponents* are trying to slander them."
Coronavirus,fodf87f,t1_fod9qbc,1587683941.0,No but he lies about it so there’s always that element of being “wrongly accused” (at least in trumpster heads) Newsom straight up admits to it. He’s obviously a better guy for owning it but that doesn’t really matter in a lot of people’s heads.
Coronavirus,foder1s,t1_fodddn9,1587683775.0,"Yeah but none of those were confirmed and they deny it, Newsom straight up admits and will talk about it. Not saying I agree but there’s a distinction."

I tried getting along with her at first but then she made up a bunch of stuff that he was cheating on me and had other girls/didn’t care about me etc. and when he called her out (because none of that is true) she was like “ohhh I’m really sorry I just thought that’s what you were doing” and she told me that she was just trying to “look out for me” because she thought he was exhibiting the behavior he has before when he’s ghosted girls in the past (which isn’t a great thing to do but ghosting someone after a week doesn’t equal cheating wtf) and my boyfriend who can be surprisingly trusting believes her and wants me to get along with her. 
She reached out the other day to apologize about everything but I’m sooo wary of her at this point. (Not to mention close friends of mine went to high school with her and she pulled a lot of BS then too) 

So basically now I’m kind of stuck because I really do not like or trust her but also she is a close friend of his and babysits for his sister and so I’m gonna have to be around her sooner or later and unless I respond to that text (it’s been over a week now lmao) it’s gonna be reeaaally uncomfortable. Idk. 

Not trying to hijack your post just I’m in a similar situation where my gut instinct just hates someone and I’m not sure if I need to just ignore it."

It over all lasted about two weeks. I’ve had a weird lung wheeze and tightness in my chest since then (not all the time just sometimes, usually at night) I’m wondering if I could have had it. This was in California in Santa Barbara (though I was traveling back to the bay once or twice). They didn’t have any official cases in SB until recently, but the population of UCSB is on average young and healthy, could it have spread without anyone knowing?

relationships,fmjvtvk,t3_fvlfgc,1586138765.0,"This...sounds very similar to a situation i find myself in, only im in your wifes position. I cant speak for your wife obviously but im personally just not very good at expressing things. I dont even mean deep intimate things, i mean usually my face just physically isnt expressive. My boyfriend has recently been trying to get me to be more social with his friends and family (ok, not recently recently because of the virus, but in the past 6 months) and its not that i dont want to per se, its just sometimes people will say something to me, i wont give them the reaction theyre looking for, and they think im being stuck up or standoffish. In reality im probably completely ambivalent but it doesnt come off that way. Because its my nature to be this way, any attempt to be expressive just feels fake or forced and it makes me feel awkward and not want to interact with people. 

Do you think your wife just doesnt know what to say? Everybody has a different idea on what goes into maintaining relationships, personally i have good friends i dont talk to for months at a time and its really no issue, but i know people who get personally offended if im not regularly reaching out (which i find exhausting). Could this just simply be a miscommunication? Maybe by your wifes standards she \*has\* reached out and done proper friendship maintenance, while your other loved ones dont feel the same. It kind of sounds like shes aware shes not on the same page as others, wants to be, but is insecure or nervous about how to rectify it (wanting friends but then shying away from your suggestions)"
