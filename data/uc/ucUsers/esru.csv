UCSantaBarbara,fp6qa49,t3_gb3s27,1588356730.0,That's actually not what it means. That's not an order the governor put out. This is misinformation. Even if its good advice please don't spread misinformation.
UCSantaBarbara,fosku38,t3_g9824m,1588032691.0,I recommend people to look at the facebook group pandemic pedagogy and its a group of thousands of thoughtful and empathetic faculty that are working toward solutions and discussion during this trying time. Its actually pretty uplifting. I just hope that these individuals can positive infect their peers on their respective campuses.
UCSantaBarbara,fopt31c,t3_g8vf28,1587971223.0,Woooh! Welcome to the Gaucho/Mapache Family!
orangecounty,fopbx83,t1_fop0tye,1587957692.0,You'll have to look at the infection rate over the next two weeks. A variable that might make it difficult is that many of these people are out of towners!
orangecounty,fopbpg5,t1_fop8l68,1587957545.0,"Yes of course, you're totally right. That being said intensity and time are a big factor with sunlight and in general the evidence is a little mixed regarding sunlight. For example the research that led the President to say a bunch of stupid shit last week was rooted in an Dep of Homeland Security study that indicated that sunlight could kill the virus in 30 minutes (seems dubious to me). This article mentions it a bit. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/health/coronavirus-summer-ultraviolet-light.html"
orangecounty,fon80ib,t1_fom60un,1587914224.0,"I want to be really clear and let you know that your comment added nothing to the discussion and served to be nothing more than a malicious quip. You added hate into the world with your comment. Its exactly why people hate internet comments. Even if you fully disagree with my comments, at least I added to the discussionâ€” you detracted from it. 

If you are interested in learning about aerial disperion, heres a great article that talks about all sides of it: https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/03/825639323/scientists-probe-how-coronavirus-might-travel-through-the-air"
orangecounty,folj3t3,t1_fokej0j,1587863328.0,Look I ultimately agree with you but if this stops OC dumbfucks from protesting than maybe it's worth it. It's not as easy of a calculus as it seems on the surface. Analysis of public policy involves an immense amount of research into *unintended* consequences.
orangecounty,foliwlb,t1_fol1gy6,1587863203.0,"I disagree. Check out this article. It gives a pretty comprehensive scope so you may end up agreeing or disagreeing with me!

orangecounty,folitae,t1_fokzrnd,1587863145.0,I think this is a really good point people are forgetting in this thread. Luckily public restroom are closed!
orangecounty,foliq4z,t1_fol1dqs,1587863091.0,"I disagree. Here's an article which may lead you to agree with me or may lead you to disagree with me stronger. Its pretty comprehensive:

orangecounty,foliklx,t1_fol47sq,1587862995.0,"If you're sick you shouldn't be going to the grocery store let alone the beach, those people are asshole and there is no amount of beach closures that can stop them from doing something. The standing order is that if you're symptomatic stay inside. If you're not symptomatic, the dispersion will keep others safe. Heres a great article that devles into the nuance:

orangecounty,folic8d,t1_fokq7b2,1587862854.0,"Because the CDC said that specific UV light devices (often used to clean yoga studios) do kill the virus. And sunlight is a less concentrated version so between the virus being in the sun vs the shade, holding all of variables constant, it will die in the sun faster."
orangecounty,foli4ne,t1_fokxvpn,1587862726.0,"First and foremost, I want to clarify that if a person is coughing and sneezing and they go to the beach or market-- they're an asshole. Here is a great article that illustrates the complexity. It mentions it a little bit but something I want to mention is that a lot of this research does not mention outdoor environments. These articles are using still air environments.

orangecounty,folhagw,t1_fol451d,1587862209.0,"In my understanding, unless you're sneezing or coughing (in which case you're an asshole for going outside) aerosol droplets will carry and disperse in the air in an outdoor environment, especially on a beach like Newport's where there is usually some amount of wind coming from offshore."
orangecounty,fokwutq,t1_fokqzcj,1587850473.0,"Awesome! Thanks for engaging with the math. I have some comments I would like to share. I don't think an individual needs 36ft^2. I would argue that although 36 is great you would really need somewhere between 9 and 16ft^2. The reason for this that I argue is if you are walking only three feet away from someone laying on the sand. Depending on your height you will be 5-6ft higher than the plane of their breathing. 

Regarding your points about air droplets: the droplets that you respirate will disperse very quickly in an outdoor environment. And this dispersion will really render them mute. They will be at such a low concentration that they is zero chance they will cause an infection. This is my understanding from what public health officials have explained."
orangecounty,fokvrxv,t1_fokqflv,1587849890.0,"Yeah so as I said in my above post it would be important to look at the ""useable"" portion of the beach which is my vague way of saying: the area that's not right against the water but also not the area that is so far away from the water that people don't actually sit. Moreover as I explained to another commenter, if you are walking only three feet away from someone laying on the sand. Depending on your height you will be 5-6ft higher than the plane of their breathing while you briefly walk past someone."
orangecounty,fokv3ex,t1_fokpkau,1587849517.0,I would encourage you to look into the research more on this. Particulates will disperse to a low enough concentration to not be infectious and being outside is a really important part of that.
orangecounty,fokuq2s,t1_fokqqbe,1587849317.0,"So i'd say a couple things in response:
1) Particulates will disperse to a very low concentration when outside especially because beaches typically have offshore wind.
2) If there is a person and they are laying on the sand and I walk past them standing up, the the particulates from those people (until fully dispersed by the wind) will stay one a lower plane. More simply, my mouth, eyes, nose will be 6ft off the ground and the people laying in the sand will be directing their breath 1/2 - 1ft off the ground."
orangecounty,fokh1tk,t1_fokb83d,1587841922.0,Yeah I think with kids it's probably a lot harder to control but because it's the outdoors I know that the possibilities of COVID lasting in a environment like that is next to none compared to an indoor setting. Between aerial dispersion and UV rays beating down on constantly moving sand. For me as an adult I don't have as many worries.
orangecounty,fokglz8,t1_fokay3x,1587841693.0,"Do you or anyone else with fancy math skills know what the population density of a the beach in Newport would be with let's say 20,000 groupings of 2 people (even though it's more likely like 14,800 groupings of 2.7 people) on the useable portion of the beach is by space per square foot? I'm not sure of the math."
orangecounty,fokfvij,t1_fokcdx0,1587841305.0,Oh i 100% agree but my question is that if they are social distancing would it all in all matter?
orangecounty,fokfs15,t1_fokc0fv,1587841254.0,I definitely agree with this!
orangecounty,fokfpre,t1_fokdz2m,1587841221.0,Just based on the video posted it seemed like every grouping on people was 8-10 feet apart at a minimum. So I can't say with any certainty because i have not looked at any additional evidence.
UCSantaBarbara,fokaeiq,t1_foi9yac,1587838386.0,Omg Thanks!! I didn't even realize it!
orangecounty,fok9xom,t3_g7tg8w,1587838140.0,"So if people are social distancing, what is the problem with going to the beach? Looking for a healthy discussion and opinions different than my own!"
UCSantaBarbara,foi7r2g,t3_g7fzha,1587780479.0,Rent is theft
UCSantaBarbara,focoj36,t3_g6spli,1587673831.0,Yeah dude sell em or work with IV Screen Printing to sell them in their store!

UCSantaBarbara,fo7uf07,t3_g66vyf,1587584724.0,"Are the ""extra"" lectures in lieu of readings or in addition to? Or is this not applicable STEM stuff."
UCSantaBarbara,fo5nrsx,t3_g5rlzs,1587530379.0,Chancellor Yang does not believe in fixing roads. I swear to you this is a quote from a Vice Chancellor.
UCSantaBarbara,fnpp699,t3_g20woz,1587149458.0,Look I recognize that this subreddit hates AS and honestly theres a lot to hate. But there are students that care and do good work behind the scenes to fight for student interests. I just want to share that my friend Austin Foreman who is running without a party for AS President has done more than any other senator I know to fight against administrators on internal committees. He has argued against conflicts of interests that the Chancellor appointed and he has fought for infrastructure on this campus that actually serves students not just the faculty.
UCSantaBarbara,fnenfsf,t3_g1a2kk,1586892483.0,Quality content!
UCSantaBarbara,fmkf30e,t3_fvseyy,1586152822.0,"Maybe not a groupme, but like a FB group. Either way i'd be down but if it was a groupme i'd definitely be muting notifications if there was hundreds of people in it."
