daverubin,fp2bohk,t3_gara6v,1588258923.0,"Yeah, I've seen such specific categories on Amazon before. Even in Academic subjects. It's a marketing scheme, so you can give more products the ""#1 Best Seller"" tag. I am not sure, however, if it is just Amazon doing this to iprove sales on the store, or if it is a deal that Amazon makes with publishing houses. Essentially, amazon selling the tag to improve sales and publicity. Maybe someone who knows more can tell us."
UCSD,fowa8a8,t3_g9uxgc,1588115902.0,"This is completely unacceptable. I still live in graduate housing, and the campus is essentially dead. Health services and the pharmacy are still open, and some shuttles are still operational, although wait times are usually long. In the price center, the few places that are still open primarily serve the construction workers who are still working there. 

And all these are understandable. Again, there is practically no one at the campus right now.

I would be ready to accept to pay some fees for the few people working on campus under these difficult circumstances. But to expect us to pay the full cost, as if the campus was fully operational, is utterly unacceptable. I am sure that the university is facing (and will face) financial constraints, but so are we. And students, both undergraduate and graduate, are in a more vulnerable position than UC San Diego, let alone the UC system as a whole.

The least they could do was to provide a reasonable discount to the fees to reflect the current status of the campus. I assume that the operating costs of the university are significantly lower than they used to."

MapPorn,fnj5yn5,t3_g1ynw2,1586992600.0,"It drives me crazy when I see Greek being identified with Omega. I keep seeing it.

In some game series, even (like total war, civilization), it is used as a national/ethnic symbol, why? It's like using 'Z' to symbolize English, and the English. It's very simplistic and kind of lazy.

At least that is what I though until now. Seeing 'A' used to symbolize the Latin alphabet is quite revealing. It clearly implies that the Latin alphabet is the most important one, which is very interesting considering that its creation was influenced by the Greek one. Maybe this is done subconsciously. I don't know. If the issue was simply to use a unique letter to each alphabet as a symbol, then for the Latin alphabet 'W' or 'Q' would have worked a lot better. But what we see, here at least, is 'A' the first letter in both alphabets. The one usually used to show importance and the start of something.

Edit: Syntax"

totalwar,fn2bqc8,t3_fypxyh,1586583648.0,"Shogun 2 is probably the oldest Total War game that doesn't feel very dated, in my opinion. If you want a historical Total War game to begin with, Shogun 2 is good option. It is essentially the pinacle of the first period of the series. Personally, having played all the games in the series -- except Attilla -- since the first one (fun fact, in the first game, before there was a series, Total War, was the subtitle), I split the series to two major periods, before and after Rome II. Of course, there other ways you can split the series, for example the first two games' gameplay and mechanics was more tabletop like, and could be considered as the first part of the series. Shogun 2, however, is where the mechanics of the rest of the games of the early period mature. 

Moreover, for a new player the map is comparatively smaller, and thus it can provide a better experience, and be easier to learn. Lastly, Shogun 2 is at heart a remake of the very first game and that has its importance for the series.

On a final note, If you want to play a more recent title, I wholeheartedly recommend Warhammer 1. The mechanics of Warhammer are significanltly improved in Warhammer 2, but the heart of the lore begins in the region of Warhammer 1, the map is more concise (larger than the map of Shogun 2, but still manageable), and if you want to eventually to play the whole map of the Warhammer world you will need to buy it anyway, might as well start with it.

This is probably more that what you were asking. Nevertheless, I hope it helps. Good luck!"

totalwar,fn29zu5,t1_fn0igsp,1586582117.0,"The ""duel"" mechanic as implemented in Three Kingdoms is a gimmick. You still have duels in the Warhammer Total War games by simply ordering a lord unit to attack an eneky one. 

We don't need gimmicks. We need good gameplay and good units (including balanced lord units)."

AncientGreek,fmyw3f3,t1_fmytabm,1586497565.0,"Erotas ('Ερωτας) is the modern Greek version of Eros ('Ερως). The modern nominative comes from the archaic genitive case. Which in the case of Eros is Erotos ('Ερωτος), i.e., of love.

This is not unusual. For example, the modern word Ellada (Ελλάδα), Greece, comes from the archaic genitive of Ellas\* (Ελλάς), Ellados (Ελλάδος). There are exceptions, however. For instance, the Greek word (in the nominative case) for light, Phos (Φώς), remains the same. If you are curious, the modern genitive of Ellada is Elladas (Ελλάδας).

By the way, it's important to mention that the archaic versions are not gone by any means. Although they are not used in every day speech, they are still present in various forms. Certain institutions still use the archaic forms. Again with the example of the word Ellas, you can see this in the Bank of Greece (Trapeza tis Ellados, Τράπεζα της Ελλάδος), the Church of Greece (Ekklisia tis Ellados, Εκκλησία της Ελλαδος), etc. Interestingly enough, in some cases, some organizations may choose to use the modern nominative or genitive, instead of the archaic one, such as the Communist Party of Greece, which in Greek is Kommounistiko Komma Elladas (Κομμουνιστικό Κόμμα Ελλάδας). The idea being that the communists reject the archaic pretentions of the Greek bourgeoisie.

On a final note, in athletic stadiums (for football matches, etc.) fans will not cheer the national team by shouting ""Ellada,"" but ""Ellas,"" the archaic form of the name.

This is probably more than you were asking, sorry. Take care.

\*In English you'll probably have seen the word written as Hellas

Edit: added ""or genitive"" in the third paragraph."

MapPorn,fmo9lsa,t1_fmnibwl,1586250632.0,"I think the choice of the dominant colours (black, green, red, yellow) place them in the same family. Essentially, the choice of the colours shows that the designers were drawing inspiration form the same ideas during the period of decollonization. 

It makes sense that there are significant variations in the design, considering the size of the continent (even in the sub-saharan part of it)."
