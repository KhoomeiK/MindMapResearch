 And adding to this, OP should sue her MIL for the replacement cost. 

First, if it's legal for one party to record a conversation, get MIL on record that she unwrapped the painting and improperly stored it. At least get it in an email.

Second, contact cousin and explain situation. The value of the painting is likely either the greater of what a competent artist would charge, or what your cousin can get. An art student may get only a few hundred for a painting, while a mid level could get $6K+ and someone very well established could get tens of thousands.   
So it's important to establish and document the true value of the painting.

It may be worthwhile to file in regular court, not just small claims. Gives leverage to settle, and you can compel depositions. 

Yeh this will escalate the war that MIL started. She agreed to store the painting, and is expected to exercise reasonable care.
