UCDavis,foxm4cn,t1_foxhief,1588148383.0,"Not sure if this makes you feel any better but I know how tough NPB 110C was. I also failed twice (I still don’t know how even though I worked my ass off, and also put on SD because of it). Don’t know how I failed NPB 110C but was able to pass o chem and BIS 102/103... it’s not like I don’t understand physio either, you would think after taking it thrice you would learn something, and I definitely did, and managed to get a B in NPB 101L too. NPB 110C is structured poorly and I hated that class SO much, after taking it a third time and getting a D, I was glad I was at least getting credit for it this time and left it at that. I’m so sorry about your midterm, screw 110C :("
