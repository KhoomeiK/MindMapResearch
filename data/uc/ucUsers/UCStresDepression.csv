Then, those two had a recessive dark coat which would be an Autosomal recessive inheritance. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. 

I wonder if all the pups are males only or females only. Normally, it wouldn't be only one gender, but if that was the case, then it would give rise to other possible scenarios such as X-linked or Y-linked traits."

>I never said we don't need testing;

I said we need more than just testing that confirms if someone has COVID-19. We need to test how many people have immunity against COVID-19 if we need to go back to our normal lives. Because people who are believed to be immune may be able to safely return to work. 

>The casualty rate will not go higher if the rate of spread is flattening. Those dying today are those that acquired the illness weeks ago. So no, the rate of death will not increase with a flattening curve.

The flattering curve will help to reduce the casualty rate. However, I never said flattering the curve will affect the casualty rate to go higher or lower.I  said the casualty rate will go higher if people don't develop immunity or there isn't any FDA approved treatment method. There are already 550,000 people with confirmed COVID-19, what do you think gonna happen to them without immunity against the virus or without an approved treatment method. Read two or three times just to be careful :)"
UCSD,fn9f9mh,t1_fn9dd5n,1586770714.0,"We need testing not just to confirm if someone has COVID-19 but to check who has immunity against COVID-19. Because people who are believed to be immune may be able to safely return to work. The idea of providing proof of immunity to allow workers to return to their jobs is being considered in many countries, including Britain and Italy. But there are problems with the anti-body testing and doctors/researchers are still conducting studies to see if someone is immune to the COVID-19, how long the immunity will last and to see what extent these anti-body tests can tell if the individual will survive against the virus. 

>The curve appears to be flattening regardless of lack of an approved treatment.

So you already know that there is a lack of an approved treatment. Without an FDA approved treatment, the casualty number will go higher, there are already 20k+ people dead from this virus in the USA. Flattering the curve matters to keep the situation under control but that does not guarantee that we will be able to go back to our normal lives without further steps like having proper studies regarding immunity against COVID-19, proper antibody test to let people who have immunity to go back to work and FDA approved treatment method. This matters because you basically giving the idea that just because the curve is flattering and more tests are being conducted to confirm if someone has COVID-19, we can go back to normal life soon."
UCSD,fn9cuyo,t1_fn9awl3,1586768016.0,"even though the curve is flattening, the questions need to be asked when will there be an FDA approved treatment method for COVID-19? when will there be an approved vaccine for COVID-19? will the anti-body test guarantee that you will have full immunity against COVID-19? If someone is immune to the virus, how long will the immunity last?"
