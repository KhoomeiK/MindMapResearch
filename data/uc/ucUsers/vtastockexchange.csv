UCSantaBarbara,fplmaq1,t3_ge6odk,1588715289.0,"Under normal circumstances, freshmen are guaranteed a spot in UCSB dorms, but they are preventing any rooms from having more than two people in them, which means that they cant fit as many people as they normally would be able to into the buildings. You are not guaranteed a spot in housing, but it is still wise to send in the application, because there is a good chance you will receive one. They will let you know if you got a room in June."

UCSantaBarbara,fp0wo20,t1_fp0we8y,1588218609.0,"I found Santa Rosa and Anacapa to be very social, while my floor on Santa Cruz was very quiet. Obviously it differs from year to year, depending on the people coming in, but I would highly recommend Santa Cruz or Santa Rosa. Both are really close to DLG, but Santa Cruz has been renovated the most recently."

That is, if the course isnt being instructed by someone who thinks all we do is sit around all day and twiddle our thumbs."
