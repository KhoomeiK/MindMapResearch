LSAT,fovyzu9,t1_fovvlv1,1588110010.0,"There are accommodations in hiring and employment practices that allow for such measures to be taken. This might sound mean through text but try to imagine this in a neutral tone haha. Not every lawyer goes in front of the courtroom, many are transactional, so they don‚Äôt have to be able to handle the pressures of the courtroom. In the principles of employment law, disabled employees are legally protected, and cannot be evaluated based on the standards of non-disabled employees. Once an employee discloses their disability, accommodations will be mandated by law, and if said disabilities cause them to be discriminated against by their employer, that‚Äôs grounds for a civil rights law suit. I can see where you may get the idea that the real world may be different, but in practice, the rule of law mandates accommodations like these for disabled professionals across several vocational fields. So if a disabled lawyer was hired by a firm, and discloses their disability to their employer, accommodations must be made by the firm under the rules stipulated by the ADA.

Keep in mind these accommodations aren‚Äôt necessarily advantages. If anything they level the playing field. A non-disabled person still has several advantages over a disabled person when it comes to testing. These accommodations are also mandated by law by the Americans with Disabilities Act, so law makers and the courts themselves do not view these as advantages, but view these accommodations as equalizers in a system inherently designed with non-disabled as the normative standard. Also keep in mind, just because someone has accommodations for testing doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôll score better. There are many people, whether they be disabled or not disabled, who could take the test 100% untimed and still score poorly, no matter how much they‚Äôve prepared for the exam. I could see your frustration if people were to cheat the system, and lie about a disability while reaping the advantages‚Äîbut the vast majority of people receiving accommodations do so under honest pretenses, and have been evaluated by medical professionals who in their expert opinion support testing accommodations and believe that such accommodations will allow their score to be a more accurate representation of their potential. 

I hope this helps better contextualize the issue and offers an adequate response to your concerns."
LSAT,fovol50,t3_g9spbx,1588104837.0,"What you are asking by itself is not an insensitive question‚Äîin fact this is a good question to ask. The rationale behind accommodated testing is that people with disabilities should not be evaluated based on testing conditions that were designed for non-disabled people. I think you need to understand that disabilities are more than just ‚Äúextra-time‚Äù on exams. Some applicants have motor disabilities and have trouble writing‚Äîlet alone turning the page on their exam booklet. Some have disorders like misphonia, a condition which induces a strong reaction to specific sounds, and require a private testing room. Some people have epilepsy, and require extra time due to the effects of the medications they take to control seizure activity. The concept of accommodated testing is to allow an even playing field between a disabled applicant and that of a non-disabled applicant. It would be unfair to place non-disabled constraints on a disabled applicant, as this would not be an accurate assessment of their intellectual ability and overall level of achievement.

In regards to being a lawyer, I think the premise you put forth is a bit flawed in the reasoning. While I am not a lawyer myself, I know many lawyers who would tell you that success on the LSAT, whether accommodated or not, does not directly translate to being a good lawyer. There will be no instance in your legal career, other than the bar exam, where you as a lawyer will be placed in such an arbitrary vacuum in which your testing abilities are tested under stringent time constraints. Being a lawyer is anything but a multiple choice test, and it should not be treated as one. In real life, lawyer won‚Äôt be able to choose from A, B, C, D, or E, as they‚Äôll have to formulate their own answers to the most complex problems posed by jurisprudence. As a future lawyer, I would also recommend you look at the ADA requirements prohibiting standardized testing entities from discriminating against disabled test takers. The ADA requirements form the basis for the existence of accommodated testing, and may provide you with answers to your questions. As a lawyer, these are some of the laws and legal precedents you should research before presenting your case to whatever forum you find yourself in.

As someone who has been disabled my entire life, and has succeeded academically in spite of the challenges I face, I can tell you firsthand despite my accommodations, I will in fact succeed as a lawyer. Many disabled people have gone on to have successful careers despite requiring accommodations. Steven Hawking, one of the greatest scientific minds to ever live, lived with a debilitating disability, and required significant accommodations. Another high-achieving person with a disability was that of President FDR, whose polio diagnosis required him to travel in and out of a wheel chair in order serve his role as commander in chief. It would be wrong to hold the same standards to disabled individuals, as standardized testing itself was designed with non-disabled people as the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù.

Beneath this post, I don‚Äôt sense animosity towards accommodated testing, but stress, fear, and insecurity. I can understand your fear, and understand why you may feel the need to displace this anger on someone else. I ask that no matter what, you be kind to yourself, and that if you feel stressed, overwhelmed, or sad during these times, that you take a break to rest and recuperate. It is ok to feel scared, and feel pressure, as this is not an ordinary exam. I wish nothing but the best for you and hope you score well on the LSAT and become the lawyer you dream of being."

LSAT,fnbi54b,t3_g0sow4,1586815941.0,"Yes... for sure they are worth it. Especially for games. A lot of the weird games we‚Äôre seeing on the newer tests are very similar to the weird games on those earlier tests. If you wanna be prepared for the curveballs they throw on test day, I would for sure invest in those PT‚Äôs. The RC from these, at least in my opinion, is a bit more difficult passage wise, and would be good practice for the newer ones. While the LR may seem weird for the earlier ones, they reuse a lot of the same scenarios, so it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to familiarize yourself with them. I would say any extra practice you can get is worth it in the long run. If you have a while to study, and don‚Äôt want to run out of material, 1-35 would be good to work through."
