UCSC,fourc8c,t3_g99cnv,1588089116.0,"In my game design class, the chat is always like that. And the professor reacts to it with humor. It makes such a casual atmosphere that I'm really thankful for. The class even has a discord for the usual stuff but also cursed sonic images and for out of context quotes from the professor."
UCSC,foi3l7h,t1_foheioz,1587778019.0,"Ya I have the $0 too. I'm grateful I dont have to rely on the UI, but it's still frustrating."
UCSC,foh8ozc,t3_g7cwt7,1587761889.0,"Got my UI claim back and I realized I don't qualify due to being an employee of a public/nonprofit school. I'm grateful I don't have to rely on the unemployment insurance, but it's still crushing during this time."
UpliftingNews,fob62t5,t3_g6cobt,1587656499.0,And then theres the US where a good portion of people are saying social distancing is communism and healthy people should be exempt from quarantine... In my community we have only 2 confirmed cases and no deaths and these people want to open up the hotels and vacation homes which just increases the chances of the virus.
deadcells,fnra873,t3_g3bbpx,1587183199.0,Never noticed that. I thought the feet were pockets. Not sure what I thought the legs were but it definitely looked like a dress

clonewars,fmo0gap,t1_fmnl5rr,1586240969.0,"Well best of luck to you. I feel the next arc is going to be better. And once that's done, you can continue ""clone wars fridays"" going through the past arcs."
clonewars,fmj0s3s,t1_fmiyzck,1586120736.0,True. That was fun.
