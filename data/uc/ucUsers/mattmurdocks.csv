To be honest, I feel like I'm always just kind of floating through life, and in fact I was totally going to just go to a state school until about a year ago I somehow got a 4.00 and was like. wait a second. what if I applied to Cal. So basically everything became about that now, and I guess I'm just feeling like I've been thrown back to square one in regards to what the hell I'm doing in college (though I'm absolutely grateful!). I definitely need to think harder about what I want after college, and your advise about looking outwards first before figuring out what to do is exactly what I needed to hear. Thank you!!!"

berkeley,fo836jz,t1_fo5wnen,1587589091.0,"Yeah, I'm kind of in limbo regarding that tbh. I kind of suck at math, which has really limited my ability to get into the sciences, but I'm going to attempt to take Chem at cc over the summer and test the waters there. I would love to do something regarding environmental studies, but again I think my lack of math skills might be a huge problem"

I've actually done 4 semesters of 2 different languages at CC, though Cal doesn't seem to have an ASL program which is... disappointing lol. I'm signing up to take Mandarin in the fall though so that might be interesting"
