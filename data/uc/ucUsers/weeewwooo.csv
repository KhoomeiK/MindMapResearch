chemistryhelp,fpm58zj,t1_fpm3b78,1588725830.0,"Thank you! 

I was also really confused because when I googled it showed that there were other Kw values for higher temperatures that were considered neutral and it worried me!"
chemistryhelp,fpm1pwh,t3_ge9d75,1588723771.0,Do I square the \[H+\] to get the Kw? But how do I know neutral/acidic
ucla,fpltzhm,t1_fplmrtz,1588719433.0,It’s so confusing cause there rlly isn’t a clear answer and I just want to make sure that I can estimate my grade properly. Based on the amount of work I’m doing I really hope I can get at least an A-

ucla,fpaq5z1,t1_fpa84oz,1588453402.0,I am in Pham's class right now and I definitely see your point! It is a lot of problem based questions but I really thought that if I understood the concept and did practice questions that I would be okay... Turns out I still have gaps in being able to apply my knowledge.
