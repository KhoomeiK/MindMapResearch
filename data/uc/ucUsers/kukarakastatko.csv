Sacramento,fpl6zk9,t1_fpl6fka,1588707478.0,"I know. The survey asks about anxiety around finances, and anxiety is obviously something that’s researched in psychology. The APA page is just another example of SES in psych research"
Sacramento,fpkrefu,t1_fpknsrt,1588699719.0,A quick google search would’ve answered your question. Just saying. Short answer: Yes. Try looking at what the [APA](https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/education) has to say about it.
migraine,fpj8iir,t3_gdq2yk,1588659820.0,"Yes! This is exactly where many of mine originate on the right side, or the pain begins in the R temple and eventually stretches all the way back there :("
berkeley,fpbkwte,t3_gc2dfg,1588472376.0,"Have taken both. Took 140 over summer but had taken 160 during a semester. I personally enjoyed both fairly equally, but since I took 160 with Serena Chen vs. 140 with a passing through postdoc/lecturer, I’d say I enjoyed 160 a little more. Both classes were pretty easy, too, imo."
berkeley,fp46a5t,t1_fp3wi35,1588292536.0,"If you take out a loan in the spring, say, for $2,500, they’ll pay the total amount in the spring semester."
berkeley,fp466s0,t3_gb6n4v,1588292481.0,"Well, looks like UC Berkeley’s graduate stats program is ranked #2 in the US (right under Stanford) and UCLA’s graduate stats program is #31 (Source: US News 2018 rankings). That may not reflect fully on the undergrad major, but this means the faculty and graduate student instructors (TAs, called GSIs here) are those who teach at/conduct research/attend a more highly ranked program than UCLA, which may have benefits worth looking into, especially if you’re interested in research and/or graduate school."
berkeley,fp44vhu,t3_gb7gtu,1588291731.0,Basically just bragging rights. I’ve read graduate school applications where the authors cited certain courses they received A+s in undergrad as evidence of their interest in/passion for a particular subject or research area.
relationship_advice,fp2mibs,t1_fp1sbbn,1588264296.0,"I love my boyfriend a lot but if he did something like this I would consider breaking up with him. I’d tell him that - “Hey, you treating me this way hurts me, and now I’m wondering if I would be better off not being in a relationship with you.” The fact that he says you’re overreacting means he doesn’t respect you... I would definitely part ways with someone who disrespects me like that. Life is too short to let people treat you like crap."
relationship_advice,foz9gq1,t3_gaf8j9,1588186907.0,"Oof. If my boyfriend asked me about this and 1) I wasn’t invited/couldn’t go, and 2) he said I’d be a “bad gf” if l didn’t let him go, I’d take that as a major red flag. Yes, I trust my boyfriend, but calling me a bad girlfriend is straight up gaslighting me imo. He’d be the “bad boyfriend” for being so selfish and not considering my (totally valid) feelings about him going on this trip."
berkeley,foz6szk,t3_ga3wn5,1588185643.0,"Congrats! Tbh when I first glanced at your post I thought of actual STDs tho, not standard deviations"
ArchitecturePorn,foz23pu,t1_foyy266,1588183367.0,"I was on campus til 4am and had to be back at 7am. At the time, it seemed easier to find somewhere to nap than to “waste time” walking home (I lived a 30 min walk from campus). Ah, the teenage years...."
ArchitecturePorn,foyxn4i,t3_g9wasw,1588181085.0,"Fun fact: I spent a night on the floor of the lobby in this building once. It’s a beauty for sure. The floor was pretty standard, though."
AskAcademia,foyoddf,t3_ga4vpb,1588176166.0,"Psychometrics - most people have no reaction. Some ask me what psychometrics is, others just drop it or decide that I must be studying psychology (which I did study back in undergrad, lol)."
berkeley,fovrzmz,t1_fovruwf,1588106509.0,damn. That’s really unfortunate. I hope that the funders clear things up for you soon
berkeley,fovrr74,t1_fovptnb,1588106392.0,It’s definitely going to depend on the agency. Different grant sources will have different rules. Your other best bet may be seeking out other students who’ve received funding from the same source in the past
berkeley,fouzoge,t3_g9j42l,1588093010.0,"Yeah I feel like this is a vague question and is really one that’s meant for the granting agency, not people here (Stipulations of the funding should come from whoever granted you the stipend.... not from fellow students/alum on Reddit)."
nintendo,fokuh00,t3_g7vuf0,1587849178.0,I am looking forward to seeing my father again. My dad lives out of state and has a heart problem that puts him in the category of “more vulnerable” during this pandemic... he has been sheltering in place for a while now. I miss him and tear up when I think about the possibility of losing him. I can’t wait to visit - I just want to hug him... hopefully not too far into the future.
berkeley,fo0admn,t3_g4lr3z,1587408985.0,Idk about you but my Calnet was locked last week due to being on a list of “exposed credentials” and it still hasn’t been unlocked. I can’t log in no matter what. It’s ridic
migraine,fnzn7o6,t1_fnx5ncn,1587397254.0,I will definitely be asking my doctor about this option
migraine,fnxoq9y,t1_fnxniwh,1587343118.0,"I was in a similar situation up until about 4 months ago - I didn’t love some of the side effects of my birth control (despite no periods) and decided to give my body a break. Long story short, it wasn’t worth it. The pros of not having nearly as many hormonal migraines far outweigh the other side effects"
migraine,fnxdthp,t1_fnxb4ho,1587336601.0,"I haven’t, but I’m willing to try just about anything (obviously only if it’s OKed by my doctor). I’ll also have to try the naproxen with my triptan next time and see if I have any different results... still waiting out this migraine and hoping it’ll be gone soon. I’ve tried edibles for my migraines but generally don’t find any relief from that when it’s hormone-related... wish I did tho"
migraine,fnxdk62,t1_fnx99uc,1587336456.0,Thank you! I will check out these options as well
migraine,fnxd92d,t1_fnx50sv,1587336286.0,"I’m using the ring continuously but had only recently went back on BC (3 weeks ago), so it seems my body hasn’t fully adjusted. I was able to decrease the amount/frequency of hormonal migraines if I stay on birth control for 6+ months, but the some of the side effects aren’t my favorite"
migraine,fnxd133,t1_fnx0dlu,1587336166.0,Feel better <3
migraine,fnxczz2,t1_fnx34s6,1587336149.0,I was about to go to urgent care for my migraine this morning! I do sometimes try tea. I think I will have some now. Thank you!
TwoXChromosomes,fnvyfss,t3_g4275i,1587307642.0,"So I normally hate seeing Redditors jump to conclusions & encourage people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, but this is different. He didn’t just tell you that he’s unhappy with you, he said he’s unhappy with you based on something TOTALLY SUPERFICIAL. Not only that, but he compared you to ex-partners. That’s not one, but two HUGE red flags. Maybe he’ll find someone who loves makeup as much as he appears to, but it sounds like you’re the one who’s due for an upgrade. 

Seriously, please consider either couples therapy or leaving him. At the very least, it sounds like he would benefit from therapy by himself (as many people could, of course). You deserve better. You can love yourself better than he can. You deserve to partner with someone who loves the same you whether or not you have some damn pretty paint on your face."
nintendo,fntxkzb,t3_g3ptch,1587250533.0,I’ve been spending way more time with my partner. It’s been incredible.
berkeley,fn791ut,t3_fzse1d,1586715664.0,"Noisy roommates who don’t know what headphones are, shoddy internet, and no desk! Good times."
n64,fmpsr8d,t1_fmoqv9j,1586286659.0,This comment confused me for a second because I had just seen a post from r/Finland right above this... wasn’t sure if I was in r/n64 or back in Suomi! Perkele
Sacramento,fmo5vui,t1_fmalm3f,1586246524.0,"Legally, public schools must ensure equity of access for ALL students. This means more than just distributing chromebooks. It requires thinking about issues such as accessibility: how students with IEPs will receive accommodations, how to reach students who may not have internet access, etc. Many teachers I know in Sacramento and other districts in CA were explicitly NOT allowed to provide direct instruction online (even if they wanted to) during the initial weeks of closure due to these issues. 

This also is the reason that many private schools in the state were able to get online learning up and running sooner. I get that this is unfortunate and it does suck for the students (and for teachers, parents, and everyone else, realistically), but complaining about it will not make things any better - school shutdowns are not something that should be taken lightly, and are often only done in light of extreme cases (such as COVID-19). Better to shut down schools and risk a couple months of sub-par education than risk thousands more lives being lost.... education can be regained. Lives cannot."
RATS,fmjq1vh,t3_fvm56m,1586135376.0,Used to have one of these. None of my rats would use it hehe
