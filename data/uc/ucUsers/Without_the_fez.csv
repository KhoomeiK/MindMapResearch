Think of your Bachelors as a platform that can help you propel into another chapter of your life.  You may have a bio B.S., but 12 yrs from graduation , you can become a CEO of a biotech firm, or an Executive with a lab testing company, etc.  

The same if you decide to pursue med school.  Not all doctors end up practicing medicine forever.  Many become managers, executives and yes, teachers.  No doubt their education and experience helps in pursuing different fields. 

My advice - finish your STEM degree.  Teach if you like.  Explore other opportunities.  I’m sure med schools will always be taking applications."
