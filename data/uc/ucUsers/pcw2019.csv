Campuses nationwide have organizations to help underserved groups get the resources that they need; this isnâ€™t anything unique to UCLA. Furthermore, people fail to recognize that the experience that you have as a student can be vastly different than others, especially when, as aforementioned, only 3-4% of your peers look like you. That can be a very isolating experience and, consequently, I think itâ€™s perfectly fair to have the organizations that UCLA has in place."
