publichealth,foqsj2u,t3_g8wedj,1588000035.0,i didn't study at all. the exam is pretty much common sense plus a little current events and program planning knowledge. if you work in the field or are fresh out of school you should be fine.

leaves,fofrdda,t3_g76tjh,1587741463.0,"yup that was totally a thing. going out to buy the product, smelling it and rolling around a nug in my fingers. finding the right place to store it. grinding it up twice to get the right consistency, shaking the grinder to ensure maximum kief drop in the catcher, packing the perfect joint, then getting the perfect light - all of that was probably more important than the actual ingestion after a certain point.   


addiction to the process is a very real thing. i even see it in people addicted to ""acceptable"" drugs like coffee - they buy the ""right"" beans and put so much time into grinding and brewing properly, or even the people who buy instant or from stores definitely have a habit associated with their drink. it's the same with most drugs, legal or not (alcohol, cigarettes, harder stuff like opiates and amphetamines).  


but ultimately, sobriety is the way to go. i'm very happy to have over a year and a half clean under my belt. life is better: my loved ones are closer, my eyes are clearer, my body and mind are healthier, i have a firmer grip on reality and my priorities. sure sometimes i miss the process, but then i think about what i'd be giving up if i relapsed and i'm able to keep a grip on sobriety. this subreddit helps a lot too <3"

biostatistics,fnw1qz1,t1_fnvz41h,1587309656.0,"1. a bio-statistician will be involved with how data for a study is collected (studies can range from how a medication works for a disease to whether or not a certain exposure contributes to a birth defect), and then running statistical tests on the data to see if the research question is validated. the biostatistician does not usually help create the research question, and has limited input on the ""actual science"" part.   
a bioinformatician would be involved on projects like modeling a protein or finding portions of dna/rna that need to be studied. they can be involved in the same kinds of projects i mentioned in my parenthetical above, but they would be more involved with designing the research question and interpreting the results the biostatistician gives them.  
2. not sure what the question is here, but you can learn more about biostats from coursera or just by googling guides 
3. data cleaning and manipulation is basically what you do to an excel file so that it can be analyzed using a program like SAS and return meaningful results. basically, the people who collect data might have made typos, or collected data in a way that is inconsistent or poorly formatted, and the grunt-level people are usually responsible for taking that mess and turning it into a clean spreadsheet that can be used."
