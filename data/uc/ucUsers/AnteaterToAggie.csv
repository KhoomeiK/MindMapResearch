UCDavis,fpkbggj,t3_gdppgh,1588691617.0,"""Best"" is a highly temporary term in technology. No single computer at a specific pricepoint is going to be ""best"" for very long. There are some general factors that make some computer builds better than others. 

**Desktops** (tower only)

* 8+GB RAM, preferably expandable
* Previous generation low-TDP processor (best bang for the buck). If you can get a modern generation, all the better. If you're going with Intel, go with an i3 or i5 processor. i7+ is too much heat, power consumption, and price for what most students need.
* 250GB SSD + 1TB HDD storage
* Low-TDP modern discrete graphics card w/3+ GB RAM
* WiFi and Ethernet
* Blu-Ray Drive (bonus)
* ~300w power supply

**Laptops**

* 8+GB RAM, preferably expandable
* Previous generation low-TDP processor (best bang for the buck). If you can get a modern generation, all the better. If you're going with Intel, go with an i3 or i5 processor. i7+ is too much heat, power consumption, and price for what most students need.
* 500GB SSD, preferably expandable
* Pref. discrete graphics chip/RAM
* 2+ USB ports
* 1 Video Out
* microSD card slot
* Metallic case to act as heat sink
* 13"" or 15"" screen with 1080p vertical. Do NOT accept less than 1080p. You'll see a LOT of budget laptops with 768p. This are wretched and will show you only a portion of what web designers/programmers intend on your screen. 

Depending on the economy at the time, you could find the above power-sipper computers for $600 or less. Worst case scenario, you could build the tower for that price. Today, prices have gone up due to various aspects relating to the pandemic. Right now, it all depends on sales. 

Windows 10 vs. MacOS. It's still a major debate. I always suggest a Windows 10 system because you can simply run more programs on them. Also, you'll want to have owned, updated, and installed all your preferred programs BEFORE coming to campus. You want to start fresh and ready."

UCDavis,fphbvkf,t1_fpgny57,1588618514.0,"Good. $600, you can work with, but the Trek fx2 will likely take all your money... and you don't want that that. When budgeting a bike, you really need to budget for all the necessities first or else you'll end up ""postponing"" (aka never buying) them and then you'll end up hurt, dirty, or losing your bike.

* Helmet - You don't want ""one size fits all"" and you DO want to look good in it or else you won't wear it. (~$65).
* U-Lock w/ Leash - Krytponite, Abus, or OnGuard. You want ""Sold Secure Gold"" rating on the lock. (~$60).
* Lights - Removable, USB rechargeable, LED. (~$45).
* Fenders (if not included) - Must fit your bike/tires. (~$45)

After that stuff, you got nearly $400 to spend on your bike. With that in mind, the Trek FX 1 is a better choice within your budget. 

As a long-time bike nerd, my personal suggestion is to get a bike with... 

* 7, 8, or 9 speeds (You'll save money upfront and with maintenance.)
* 36mm or wider tires (Smooths out bumpy roads and paths)
* Puncture-resistant tires (Will almost NEVER get a flat.)

Lastly, depending on where you are, you can go into a bike shop and say the following to get a very quick idea of how much they'll want to charge you. ""I'm looking for a 7, 8, or 9-speed bike with 36mm or wider tires (preferably puncture resistant). Bonus points if the bike comes with fenders and either a basket or a rear rack."" If they ask what you'll use it for, say, ""A college commute in a very flat area."" If they still try to sell you up to a mountain bike or something with drop-bars, kindly make your excuses and exit.

Another thing to know is that Bike Shops are like car dealerships in that they sell specific brands. It could sell Trek primarily, or Giant/Liv, or Specialized, etc. -- so you may need to visit a couple places to see what they have. Additionally, the last 15 years has seen an explosion in the number of smaller manufacturers on the market. Don't be fooled. Not all bikes are made equal. If a bike shop isn't selling it, chances are that it's poor quality and will not last more than a year."

UCDavis,fp6doqn,t3_gbc1vc,1588350559.0,">I have lived in Irvine my whole life so I feel like going to UC Davis would be a refreshing change and would give me the chance to be independent. This is the biggest reason that I am opposed to going to UCI. However, after talking to many people I get the impression that UCI is much better reputed than UC Davis but I don’t know if that’s true. 

I went to UCI (2000-2005) and then worked there until 2017. It is, without a doubt, and unquestionably high quality school. However, my wife and I left Irvine because we were just sick of how... beige everything is. She grew up in LA and I grew up in the Inland Empire, so we were both enamored by Irvine's cleanliness and ""new""ness. But when you get to know other communities, you begin to see through the veneer of Irvine. There's no town center. Everything is a chain-store or chain-restaurant. The Irvine Company's steel vice-grip hold on rents ensure than plucky start-up eateries kill their style to make rent. And the rent... jeez. The last apartment we had in town went up in rent $100/month for 4 straight years. We certainly didn't like paying nearly $2,000/month for a 680 sqft 1b/1ba. 

Davis, as a community, is very different. People get to know their neighbors. They smile and wave. There's a WHOLE LOT more bicyclists. The people here are genuinely kinder, more open, and more accepting. However, since it's SO MUCH CHEAPER to live here and only 1/4 the population, the City has significantly less money to spend on City infrastructure. Yes, there are a ridiculous amount of bike lane and bike paths. But they're not silky smooth like *all* the asphalt in Irvine is. There's also public art and a lovely downtown that Irvine could never make happen. 

My favorite difference is that Davis allows the seasons to happen. Huge, wide-spreading trees change colors and lose their leaves. And the leaves sit on the ground for weeks. They're not picked up the next morning by an army of landscapers. Right now is the height of spring and so many people have fruit trees that you can smell orange blossoms on the wind. 

For the people, best personal growth opportunities, and a change from Irvine, I suggest Davis. 

For the best career opportunities, I suggest Irvine. I think Irvine is just better when it comes to facilitating internships because they've built it into their educational system and because there are so many major companies in and around Irvine."
UCDavis,fp6bxa4,t3_gbc0ab,1588349693.0,"A couple things: 

1. There's no such thing as a ""rent strike"". A ""strike"" is a legal term with specific protections. Don't romanticize it and think that if enough people join in, somehow the landlords will lose their legal right to collect rent. A ""rent strike"" is just not paying your contractually obligated fees and, were it not for recent temporary eviction moratoriums, you'd be thrown out and sued for more than you would otherwise owe. 

2. Absent some future law mandating that landlords forgive unpaid rent during so-and-so months, your best option (according to your post) is to defer payments if you can't find someone to sublease. 

I absolutely don't know your family situation, so I give the following information blind of your variables: That federal stimulus money is supposed to help with situations like this. Your parents received $500 because of you. Can you use that money to pay your share of rent?

Also, if you personally have lost income, were you employed at UC Davis? If so, you should be able to claim up to 128 hours of paid COVID-19 admin leave. I'm actually paying my students for NOT working right now because of it."
UCDavis,fp68jlp,t3_gbdrgg,1588348001.0,"Welcome to the family, Mom/Dad!"
UCDavis,fp3te50,t3_gb3me0,1588285457.0,"Hello, Friend.

There's a lot to address here, so I'm going to have to break it down into sections. 

**Being a First-Generation College Student**

More of us than ever can relate. 42% of UC Davis students are first-generation college attendees. (https://firstgen.ucdavis.edu/about) There are a WHOLE BUNCH of us who went on to graduate and then return to the University system as faculty, staff, or grad students (https://firstgen.ucdavis.edu/directory). There are tons of us who are willing to share our experiences and help you understand that you're not the first to go through these rough times and you can get through it. 

**Joblessness Stress**

I, and every academic in psychology, can tell you that the number one stressor for any household is (the lack of) money. Money cannot solve all your problems, but it can sure as hell solve a lot. In fact, most people experience an equilibrium of money demand/supply around $75k. (http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html)

While many would refer to my race and regional upbringing when asking about difficulties, I rebuff the implication. Poverty was my defining childhood experience. My (step) dad got his GED in prison. My mom never made it to high school. Even when they were working, they never made enough to fully leave government assistance. This only exacerbated/compounded upon their other issues. When they were unemployed... well. That's for another talk. 

I don't know what your relationship with your parents are like outside of the stressors of joblessness. If it is otherwise good and they trust you as much as they're relying on you right now, then have a quick heart-to-heart with them can take some of the edge off. 

1. Use the opportunity to give them as much credit as possible for getting you to this point where they can trust you with such responsibilities.
2. Ask that, with the same heart, support you with a hug instead of blame. 
3. Tell them that ""we"" will get through this together. ""But we have to stay together."" 

**EDD**

Everyone is failing at contacting EDD. There's no way around it. It's a genuine hardship right now. It's a reality. I wish I could give you some hope here, but I'd rather prepare you. *It's going to be tough*. This is going to be one of those situations where just hang up and try again. Resubmit the form online. And never lose your cool-- especially with those people from EDD on the phone. Gush praise on them when you get the chance. Show them gratitude. They are working non-stop. 

I don't know if mom and dad recognize that, but let them know that your fancy education can't get you to the front of the bread line. 

Remind them -- We're doing this together. 

**I never imagined in my lifetime that this would happen...**

I did and I'm still concerned. I've lived through a few stock market crashes, but I was better prepared every time. Here's the thing: it WILL happen again. This economic recession we're in now is because of a pandemic but *numerous* companies are outright folding because they were bubble companies waiting for a needle. COVID-19 is the needle for a lot of bubbles... but the biggest bubbles (debt-financing venture capitalists investing in unicorn stocks) is yet to fully pop. Be ready for that one as well."

I grew up in genuine poverty and has literally zero family support/support (I was emancipated in undergrad) during or after college. I graduated *into* a recession (everyone graduating this year will be able to relate). I **refused** to slip back into poverty, so I rigidly accepted certain financial principles to protect against that risk. (That 10% monthly savings, for example, paid for almost everything during my year of unemployment!)

Also, this budgeting method didn't require that I ""skimp by"". I still had reasonable multi-day trips with my future wife. I bought computer upgrades. We went to the movies and got delivery from time to time. But we only spent the money that was left after being filtered through all those bills. And what we didn't spend at the end of the month went into savings. 

15 years after graduation, paying off a mortgage, and with another recession well into its formation, we still follow this financial methodology. In fact, the wife and I had a serious heart-to-heart about the potential of lay-offs and started talking about what we would cut immediately, what we have in our personal/individual savings, and what we have put away for home improvements (which turns into mortgage payments in the case of lay-offs)."
UCDavis,fp2s0yr,t3_gap6xh,1588266927.0,"I paid off ~$36,000 in 10 years (2005-2015) which averages out to $300/month. That also includes a year of unemployment and a few years of temp work ($36k/year before taxes).

As long as you prioritize your monthly spending appropriately, communicate with your loan servicer when major life events happen, and increase your monthly loan payment when you make better money, you will pay off your loan without much issue. 

**Monthly payment priorities**

1. Rent - Don't get your own apartment. Get a flatmate/roommate. 
2. Tier 1 Bills: Student loans, Car payment, electricity, (natural) gas, water/trash/sewage
3. Tier 2 Bills: Home internet access, basic cell phone service, vehicle fuel (Try transit, biking, walking, carpooling to save money. It works.). DON'T buy a new car. A new car payment isn't a treat. It's a liability. 
4. Food - Cook for yourself.
5. Savings - 10% of your take home goes to an emergency fund. 
5. Tier 3 Bills: Large cell phone data cap service. Cut this if you're short on $.
6. Tier 4 Bills: Entertainment subscriptions (Netflix, etc.). Cut some of these if you're short on $. 

Also...

* Do not select the lowest loan repayment amount if you can afford to pay more. You'll only be hurting yourself long-term by postponing paying down the loan. 
* Pay off your credit card's full balance every month. Don't pay minimums. Don't let the credit card ""float you"" for a month. You want all of last month's expenses 100% knocked out before you start next month's expenses."

And then all those companies that get stimulus funds (including campuses) that would employee students are less likely to lay-off/furlough students and more likely to hire students back during recovery.

While it's not contractually obligated, the plaintiff asserts that it is *most correct* to refund fees paid proportional to the reduced access to what those fees would normally provide. It would only seem appropriate that if we neglect the letter of the agreement to pay a set fee for access (without guarantee of access) that the price of access to all university services can be increased as the cost of providing those services increases.

In other words, ""Ok, here's $400 back for services unredered by the ARC, Student Center, and ASUCI. Also, here's a bill for $2,500 for all the increased software, hardware, and personnel overtime that was required to keep you working toward your degree while the campus was closed.""

One's maximum financial aid is increased if you live in a housing complex managed by UC Davis (not a 3rd party on the UC Davis campus) because that technically increases your cost of living and your financial aid package is supposed to help you cover the cost  of attendance (tuition, fees, and cost of living)."

If the Vice Chancellor says, ""I get the feeling that we're going to be in lock down in Winter 2021,"" you're going to have students who take gap years. And if everything turns out fine, sue the university for slowing their overall academic progress.

3. Whether University of California was unjustly enriched by retaining fees of Plaintiff and the other Class members without providing the services that the fees were intended to cover;
 * ""Enriched"". That's rich. The UC is not increasing funds right now. They're hemorrhaging money. Investments are shot. International students aren't expected to return. All kinds of optional fees are being opted out of. And now a lawsuit. 
4. Whether University of California committed conversion by retaining fees of Plaintiff and the other Class members without providing the services that the fees were intended to cover;

The majority of my campus life as experienced with my 1st year dormies. I lived with 70 people that first year... and then I moved into an apartment with 4 of them. And then another one joined a couple years later. I didn't get into Greek life or get into student government. I went to class, studied, went out with friends, threw (and went to) a few parties, and had a really great experience. 

I got a job that helped me discover a passion for education and put my area of study into a very distinct perspective. I made it a point to integrate *everything* I learned into my life and way of thinking (the real secret of college education-- not just the certificate of completion you get at the end). 

I met my wife in the dorms and the roommate I had for the last 4 years of undergrad was my best man in my wedding and I was his two years later. 

I focused on being a good person, achieving a comfortable level of academic success, and surrounding myself with similarly good people. 

All that said, some people would say that I didn't really experience ""campus life"" since I wasn't involved in clubs and attended maybe one concert on campus. ""Campus Life"" will help guide you to do a couple things here and there which could be useful if you were bored and you couldn't figure what to do or how to make friends. That's probably more important today than it was even 5 years ago because it would seem that people are very anxious about talking to new people now."

UCDavis,fmt0309,t3_fwyk2k,1586364709.0,"Hi! I went to UCI for undergrad and then worked there for 12 years. I know the place like the back of my hand. 

Culturally, the people in Davis are much, much, much more friendly and open. In Irvine, people get home, close the windows, turn on the A/C, and never get to know their neighbors.

The cities are extremely different. Irvine is one city in a metropolitan area. There's pretty much nothing to do there because it's housing and shopping chain-store shopping areas. It's spotless-clean, devoid of most crime, and boring. It's beige. Everything is beige.

Davis is a little grungier... but in a hippie way. The small-town downtown is better than anything Irvine has. 

The campuses are pretty much polar opposites. The Davis campus has huge oak trees and streets going through it... but the streets are closed to all vehicles except campus vehicles and bicycles. Leaves fall and they're allows to stay on the ground, so you actually get to experience the seasons. 

The Irvine campus looks forever new... like a shopping center. There aren't many giant trees except for the eucalyptus which grow up, not out. There are almost never any signs of any season. 

I don't know anything about clubs at UC Davis, but the ones at UCI are highly culturally oriented. Not that there's a segregation or anything, but the first thing people bond on are their cultural similarities, so they take that and roll with it. 

Probably my favorite strength of Davis is the sound... or lack thereof. I lived in Irvine 3 miles from the 3 miles from the 5 freeway and 1.5 miles from the 405 freeway and there was a CONSTANT droning of tire noise. It was never, ever quiet. Throughout much of Davis, you only hear the cars on I-80 during rush hour.

Biking - Davis is hard to beat when it comes to the amount of bicycle infrastructure, but it's really falling into disrepair. It's a great place for someone who doesn't know how to ride well and doesn't care to learn.

However, Irvine is no slouch *so long as you have learned out how to ride on the road*. The main arterials going through the city have 50mph speed limits along super long blockfaces with no driveways, so it's a constant ride on the smoothest asphalt. As a competent cyclist, I enjoyed riding in Irvine. 

Transit - There is no beating Unitrans. It's ubiquitous throughout the city and your fare is included in your student fees. Show ID, get on bus. Easy. Getting between the cities here, though, can be slow. There are some changes coming to Yolobus (the county transit system) that will speed that up a bit. We also have Amrtak up here, but Amtrak is kinda expensive.

In Irvine/Orange County, you have OCBus. It costs ~$170 for an annual pass, but you get access to the MASSIVE countywide network. Bus connectivity between the city and the campus is weak by comparison to Irvine, but you're connected to much more of the surrounding cities. Metrolink is a MUCH cheaper train option compared to Amtrak."
UCDavis,fmsxje1,t3_fx2pot,1586363554.0,"Nobody knows what the best housing community is until a couple months in. Why? Because dining commons food and distance from classes become distant considerations compared to the people you end up living around. 

Don't worry about getting ""the best"". Focus on being the best you and your experience will be tip-top."
UCDavis,fmsxad5,t3_fx0lmw,1586363441.0,"All UCs consider all of your grades- but they're considered within a variety of contexts:

* Local Context (your high school)
* State Context (top 9% of California students...)
* Course load rigor
* Extra-curricular load (clubs, sports, jobs, volunteer work, home responsibilities)
* Hardships and life experiences (Family, personal, *cough* global pandemic)

Now, you're talking about As and Bs -- not really an issue. Most people who get in trouble with their senior year grades go full senioritis and lets their grades slip to Cs or lower.

Additionally, given the expected massive drop in international enrollment this coming year, I would expect that more people than usual are expected to be selected from the Wait List... assuming there is sufficient financial aid to support them without international students subsidizing them."
UCDavis,fmp31te,t3_fwb56v,1586273479.0,"It depends on the virus and how serious we take it right now. (""We"" being literally the entire planet.)

Option #1: Vaccine - This is more than a year off, of course.

Option #2: It's the next ""influenza"" - If we do well enough over the next three months to keep the infection rate low enough so that people can contract the virus, be sick in relative safety, and recover while building an immunity, then there's a chance (albeit small), that we can be back in Fall 2020.

The only way we're going to get back to any semblance of normality is with herd immunity. Without herd immunity, the FEAR of COVID-19 alone will prevent people from forming groups of any significant size."

Campus Employee Perspective

1. **Internet Bandwidth** -- My wife and I are telecommuting. We work in different rooms of the house and both are Zoom-ing for meetings. Everyone in our neighborhood is doing the same. Our bandwidth is holding up so far. 
2. **Noise** -- It's quiet enough except for the dishwasher, laundry, and occasional lawn work being done nearby. That's intermittent, though. And I like putting music on anyway. Were we working in the same room, I'd just wear headphones.
3. **Mental Health** is suffering for everyone. Students are being asked to ignore everything and focus on their studies so they will be in better academic shape when this is all sorted. UC employees are working knowing that layoffs are coming. Business owners are watching their companies fall into disarray and laying off people they care about. Non-UC employees... well... look at the unemployment numbers. 
4. **Less Exercise/Break Time** - Working at home, neither of us take more than a couple 5-minute breaks to stand up and stretch. There's no bike commute. There's no walking to meetings or down the hall to talk with someone in person. There's no climbing the stairs. Lunch is actually LESS relaxing because I can't walk 10 minutes to the CoHo, pay for a sandwich, and walk back. I have to spend the time to make the food and clean up and walk about 15 steps in the process. It's really about 10 minutes of downtime all told.

It's hard right now. But it's hard for everyone."
ucr,fmcivyv,t1_fmbtodf,1585946532.0,"Not exactly. Instructors (actual professors, lecturers, etc.) are all funded in different ways. With enough research grants, a professor can pay for one's own salary and that of grad students and support staff. If the prof. is part of a department that balances heavier on the state funding than the grant funding, then the department may experience cuts. 

Lecturers are at the most risk. Very few of them even have permanent position at any UC and actually teach at multiple campuses (UC, CSU, CCC) to make a living."
