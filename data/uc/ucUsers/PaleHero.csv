Just be like ""Hey I know this is hard but I wanna get through this. We both want what is best for us and for our baby so how about you try telling me from your point of view and I'll tell you from mine"" type of thing.

Your wife sounds like a good lady, but maybe she just needs a very very gentle approach? You can do it OP I believe in you."
LifeProTips,fpa457n,t3_gc3b9l,1588440437.0,"In Jordan at tourist attractions they will offer to take pictures of you and then ask for money. Another one is they will offer you free horseback rides but they also expect money at the end. You can fortunately say no to both from what I've seen, but if you're willing to fork over 5 bucks for a horseback ride I'd say it's worth if.

Also, expect a hefty tourist markup in any shop you go to."
AskReddit,fp00a3g,t3_ga9q25,1588200076.0,"A reviewer on a paper I was co-authoring for a large and well reviewed journal gave my team a bunch of comments that were factually proven to be incorrect in other papers.

After we replied telling him we unfortunately could not make these edits due to them being factually wrong (in as polite a way as we can manage) he replied by degrading our paper and us and even used a particular racial slur that I think he intended to be ""witty"". 

Needless to say he was no longer a reviewer and we immediately requested someone else."
AmItheAsshole,foztq6y,t3_gaa8t7,1588196699.0,"I'd say YTA. I understand that with a ""first impressions"" meeting looks do matter and someone who has fluorescent green hair, strong patterned clothes, etc might give off a strong impression; however, after you meet someone I think their personality and actions (the less subjective ones) says more about them than anything else does. 

If your girlfriend is still respectful of you and has the same personality, it is alright to be bothered by how she dresses but I wouldn't go so far as to have a fight about it. If you feel like she is responding to these stares and is acting this way for a bad reason (though from my point of view this doesn't seem the be the case at all), then that should be the focus of your discussion rather than how she dresses.

I think the key takeaway I want you to have is why does how she dresses bother you? If it's because its weird and different then YTA because its just clothes and there are a lot more important things to describe a person than their clothes/appearance. If it's because she is getting stares and that makes you uncomfortable (this is a totally justified response as long as it is to a healthy level), that is a reasonable DISCUSSION to have where you can share your opinion with her and you guys can decide what the best move for both of you is.

I want to give you the benefit of the doubt OP and believe you aren't TA in general and are just a little conflicted about what is actually bothering you that she does, so I would encourage you to talk this over with her and find out what you both can do."

AmItheAsshole,follqqb,t3_g805ko,1587864985.0,"NAH. Sorry to spill the beans for anyone who wasn't aware, but marriage isn't about the price of a rock that actually isn't even that special (diamonds are one of the most common gemstones to find). 

It is unfair to make you feel like you betrayed her because you genuinely didn't misrepresent what you bought her. That being said, I want to give her the benefit of the doubt. My guess is, you told her its a ""real"" diamond (which it is) and her definition of ""real"" is slightly different from yours so basically she feels you lied to her. If that is the case, talk it out. If she's upset because it's ""cheap"" or not ""real enough"" for her to flaunt, then the talk you need to have is much more serious. 

In my case, I spoke to my partner and we both agreed the rings are a gesture worth having but not at an exorbitant markup just because ""wedding"" is in the label or because the diamond was mined instead of made. Life is too short, and there are much better ways to demonstrate how much you love someone and want to marry them than a silly rock."
AmItheAsshole,fnqioew,t3_g36usa,1587165385.0,"NTA. As a boyfriend for 3 years I feel like I can contribute to this as I've had a lot of experience in the position itself (If you need my performance evaluations I'll have my boss aka girlfriend fax them over). 

Your boyfriend (emphasis on ""boy"" because he is being a ""boy"" since man is reserved for adults) has no reason to be eating your food especially if it is directly making your life harder AND you asked him not to.

I'd definitely have a talk about this to try to understand what is going through his head and what his reasoning may be to be doing this. If it's sufficiently ridiculous and/or he doesn't understand how his behavior is impacting you negatively maybe it will be time to rethink what you want to do moving forward with him. 

If he is a nice guy I'm sure he has some silly reason to be out of his damn mind, and if he isn't you will definitely find out!"
AmItheAsshole,fnnb09a,t3_g2cgkm,1587088309.0,"NTA. 

It's all well and all to embrace who you are but she only is acting like this because she doesn't have to live with them after she leaves. 

They are your problem and not hers and she is really embodying that sentiment by trying to guilt trip you for not wanting to ruin your domestic situation. 

I don't know what her problem is, but personally for me I'd be pretty upset if my so-called ""friend"" was acting this selfishly and literally had none of my best interest in mind. 

OP you know your family and what they are like. If you think it isn't the move it probably isn't the move!"

unpopularopinion,fnervvd,t3_g17qii,1586894747.0,"What people are referring to is the Law of Diminishing Returns.

If you have 0 hamburgers, if I give you 1 you will be happy. If I give you 10 you're even happier. If I give you 1 million hamburgers when you have 100,00 you won't be much happier. Maybe even more upset since now all you have is a ton of hamburgers that you'll never finish.

Similarly, if you have no money and I give you 10 dollars you'll be very happy. Conversely if you have 10 billion and I give you another 100 million or even another 100 billion, your purchasing power and lifestyle won't change so relatively your happiness won't increase. You'll probably enjoy it for a short while, but after you've fulfilled all of your wildest dreams it'll just be excess possessions. You can only buy so much (I recommend the movie Brewster's Millions). 

This ""money can't buy happiness"" is all based on the perspective of where you are on this curve. Someone dirt poor might disagree, someone filthy rich might agree. The moral of the story, however, is whether one is rich or poor that if they can learn to be internally fulfilling instead of externally, that is far more permanent because it isn't attached to valuables that they either can't have (lack of money) or can't appreciate (excess of money) and whether or not you agree with the first statement, the second statement is true."

unpopularopinion,fn77riw,t1_fn6ygjh,1586714944.0,"This is a trade off in my opinion.

Denying them a smart phone ""socially handicaps"" them because they can't text their friends. 

At the same time in my personal experience with my younger brother it also seems to ""socially handicap"" them by teaching then to always be on their phone even when they are with others who they can socialize with.

I think there is a fine line that every parent needs to walk with this though and it isn't as clear cut/simple as ""If you are younger than _____""."

unpopularopinion,fn62az6,t3_fzj2ov,1586684640.0,"Props to you man! My best friend was in a similar situation growing up in the Bay Area. 

Single Mom no Dad lived in a bad neighborhood growing up and was forced to be gang affiliated to have protection for his family and himself. Managed to get into UC Berkeley and every morning he would drive 2 hours to Berkeley, attend his classes, then drive to San Francisco to work until Midnight/1am. 

Now, he lives in a very nice neighborhood and is completely independent and stable. Every time we talk about it his words are that he ""Will never go back to the ghetto"" and he is one of the people who I most respect and look up to in my life.

UCSantaBarbara,fn54mph,t3_fzccd6,1586655810.0,"Luckily I don't have to cheat and have the option to take classes P/NP in my department but I can sympathize.

There is only one test (final) worth 75% of our grade (he called it a ""gift"") and on top of that, he says if the average is high he will curve down. I thankfully am able to take it P/NP because the odds are definitely stacked against whoever takes that class for a letter grade."
AmItheAsshole,fn3peoa,t3_fz3f9w,1586625327.0,"YTA. I really question why you had to consult us at all. What is the huge problem if she wants to cook AND clean for you? I expected to read this post and see she was making a huge mess which was stressful for you but all I see is some 20 year old kid complaining about tomato thickness and her not cooking for him a certain way. 

Your tomatoes are cut a bit too thick? What kind of stupid ""constructive criticism"" is that? This isn't Master Chef or Chopped buddy. If it tastes good and is edible you don't need to make such small comments since holy shit she is doing it all for your sake. Yea, I'd feel pretty hurt too if I stay up until 3am to make food for my girlfriend and she hits me with ""The tomatoes are cut too thick"" or I'm making too big a mess."
unpopularopinion,fn3n9l6,t3_fz33c7,1586624124.0,"Honestly a lot of people will treat this like a joke and probably down vote you but it's a real thing. In my high school every club was so diverse whether it was spanish, korean, etc.

Moving to college nopeee. You are only in a club if you are apart of that race for the most part. Some of the clubs are so ridiculously racist. I'm middle eastern and was sitting at a table with maybe 9-10 of my friends who all happened to be Asian. Someone came up, invited LITERALLY all of them to a club and ignored me and they called him out on it.

One of my friends became an officer in that club, and when they were recruiting new members she got in trouble for trying to recruit non-Asians. 

Not to say they are all assholes, I have a lot of friends in every club but in some cases cultural clubs definitely promote exclusion based on race. If someone doesn't understand that they are either very lucky and go to a unusually inclusive school, or are privileged enough to not be from an excluded minority."

Meanwhile officers asked me to pop my hood and pop my trunk so they can look at everything in/on my car. Traffic violations is/are/will always be bullshit in my opinion."
AmItheAsshole,fmv21c3,t1_fmtbo33,1586404127.0,"100% agree.

OP also needs to recognize that the disparity between their pay despite fulfilling the same role due to ""unquantifiable work"" is sending a message to B that A is more valuable than him and might make him feel like he is inferior to his brother.

You should honestly pay B the difference or bump his pay if you can and/or return both to 15. I would also try to recognize B's special contributions because I find it hard to believe he doesn't do anything that you don't notice. Let him feel appreciated and recognized too!"

AmItheAsshole,fmq0mlk,t1_fmpkkzs,1586290724.0,"I do agree that ESH, but I would like to respectfully disagree that Jake is the biggest AH and their issues are inside their marriage alone.

Here is my reasoning: 

- Carly is TA for being very pushy and invasive of personal space. I'm sure she also realizes that she can use her position as a long time friend along with being single to make ridiculous demands to take advantage of Jake having his guard down around her (seems like he doesn't realize she is asking a lot). 

- OP is TA for not setting boundaries earlier or bringing this up earlier. This situation does not seem to have developed in a short period of time but rather as a result of a long period of complacency and not drawing the line (thus giving Carly the idea she can push it further). This should have been a civilized discussion long before it was a heated yelling at Carly. That being said, I have sympathy for OP due to the unusual circumstances placing strain on something she probably did not care too much about previously

- Jake is also TA for not drawing lines with Carly earlier (similar to OP). However, as someone else said we can not see what he would have done due to OP interjecting too early so it's hard to judge though if anything. 

All of this put together, I'd say Jake and OP are victims. Jake is a victim of being between a ""rock and a hard place"". Whether you think its justifiable are not, we can't neglect that for some people more than others choosing between pleasing a longtime friend or your wife is difficult. In some cases, they try to please everyone which is often not possible and seems to possibly be the case here. 

OP is a victim of wanting to just plainly be a good partner (for lack of better wording). She does not want to come off to Jake or Carly as overprotective/clingy.

These two things cause them to stretch themselves quite thin, and due to the current situation the stress Carly placed on their relationship is what seems to be the root of their problems.

Besides that, it seems like OP and Jake are able to listen and communicate effectively (is there a problem yes but relationship problem sounds a little harsh to me like their marriage is built on a flawed foundation). 

That being said, it is difficult to say Carly is TA alone due to OP and Jake never explicitly drawing lines with her.

So in conclusion, due to the reasoning above I reach a similar judgement to you, but slightly different. 

I hope you find my analysis fair and clear and that I am not reading into it or making any incorrect assumptions! 

ESH.

Carly - No boundaries
OP- Lashing out
Jake - Not drawing boundaries/being mindful 

Jake + OP = Victims of Carly + COVID"
