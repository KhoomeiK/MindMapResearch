Did your activities have an official log or sign in sheet? Worst case scenario you self-report an estimate but I would go through the process of lining it up to events I find in my stuff."
premed,fp3lux7,t3_gb4dz6,1588281594.0,"Make an excel spreadsheet and update it consistently.

I was lazy and used iphone notes. Don’t be like me and be forced to transcribe hours of multiple volunteer activities after the fact.

As for the inflation, I would not be surprised. I am really particular about my stuff but I think it would be normal to round up for partial hours. Personally, I completed almost 1000 hours of multiple community service activities. It’s taken four years though and ate into my time but I appreciate those experiences. To each their own :)"

USMilitarySO,fo0erp4,t3_g3xckb,1587411797.0,"Ahh, I relate. I was 19 years old and my MIL asked me when we were planning on a baby and what names we wanted. I was flabbergasted because (1) I was a teenager and (2) I was unemployed with no savings.

My husband PCSed to Japan and I was surrounded by other teenagers and young women who did not know about birth control or were taught marriage and childrearing are expectations. I had to teach a young mother how to clean her house, sanitize surfaces, and get into the habit of throwing away your baby’s diaper. These were not uncommon occurrences, unfortunately. All the while, everyone teased me that I would be next because “it’s in the water” (every fucking base). 

At my husband’s current duty station, I started a child-free group until college took over my life. I highly recommend starting one. Some people pitched fights but I ignored them. Also, I recommend involving yourself in your new community. I met amazing people volunteering at the Food Bank, Habitat for Humanity, and at my county internship. 

I am happy to report it’s been +10 years of marriage and no children in sight, but I have a quality resume, befriended diverse and supportive people, and am over halfway finished with my undergrad degree with plans for grad school. 

You will find your way too :)"

If you intend on applying to grad school, I recommend attending your professor’s office hours and speaking to them about your interest in their field (if applicable). For example, I was a chemistry major so I visited my chemistry professors’ office hours, sought advice for labs, and sometimes stopped by to chat with them about general interests. I built rapport with them that I intended to utilize for letters of recommendation, references, and research exposure. LoRs and research experience are needed for graduate school and help you stand out when applying.

Also, networking is a valuable skillset to have, especially as an inexperienced adult beginning one’s career. If you are able to, I highly recommend seeking internships or professional volunteer positions in your career field of choice. These experiences in conjunction with your professors’ recommendations may allow you to attain a job in your field earlier than others."
