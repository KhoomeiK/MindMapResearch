CollegeVsCollege,fnaka0r,t1_fna2cs8,1586798965.0,"I know mainly about the computer rankings and benefits since that‚Äôs my field, but from what I gather, they‚Äôre both virtually identically prestigious for mechanical engineering but have different focuses. SLO prepares one for industry better and has a more ‚Äúhands on‚Äù approach, while UCSD is a more theoretical approach and prepares you better for graduate school. Depending on your son‚Äôs career goals, this may play a big factor. That‚Äôs not to say you can‚Äôt gain valuable industry experience at UCSD, but the focus of the education is completely different. There‚Äôs countless research opportunities for grad school at UCSD while both schools have identical recruiting for internships, but SLO might give your son a better starting skillset for industry positions. 

This is just one of many factors, you can look at UCSD‚Äôs breathtaking location right next to the ocean, SLO‚Äôs better social scene and sports programs, etc etc. I go to UCSD so I‚Äôm biased tho haha. From an academic perspective though, they‚Äôre so closely matched that it really depends on your son and what he‚Äôs looking for in a career, and regardless of where he goes, these schools will look great on his resume. 

Good luck and congrats!"
