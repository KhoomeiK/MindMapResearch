ApplyingToCollege,fmvi1cn,t1_fmvghhx,1586417716.0,"I'm a current Berkeley student who thought exactly the same way as you, but committing to Berkeley (over a couple other highly-ranked CS schools) was the best decision of my life.

First off, I don't think course sizes are solely a Berkeley (or public school) problem. Because of the direction that the tech industry is moving in, everyone and their mother wants to do CS. As a result, many people try to loophole by applying to easier majors and switching to CS, which destroys the department-distribution estimates of admissions officers (resulting in over-enrollment in CS departments). In fact, even that other private junior college across the Bay is having a [CS Crisis](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/02/19/cs-in-crisis-is-stanford-doing-enough-to-respond-to-capacity-and-inclusion-challenges/).

In STEM in general (and CS especially), the number of students in your classroom doesn't matter at all towards your learning. In fact, most people doing CS here at Berkeley don't even attend in-person lecture, but rather watch the webcast from their dorm. Learning CS is about the ""doing"": grinding out challenging problem sets, coding up interesting projects, etc. There's a reason that quite a lot of people are being hired into CS-related industries (such as Software Engineering, if you're into that) with no college education and having only learned their CS skills from an Online Bootcamp.

If you really wanted that in-person small classroom learning experience, Berkeley will still allow you to learn that way. Outside of the main lecture, every class has 2-3 hours of discussion section per week, where each section (taught by a Graduate Student Instructor, or GSI—basically a TA) has about 20ish people in it and you get a much more intimate experience to ask questions and hone specific concepts. If you want even more attention, we have the support infrastructure for that as well: organizations like Computer Science Mentors (CSM) have sections of 3-4 person groups that meet weekly with a course mentor to review material in the course.

At the end of the day, the issue of CS course sizes at Berkeley is not one that will hamper your learning, and shouldn't be a deciding factor between schools for a major like CS."
berkeley,flsln9i,t3_fquz9r,1585444971.0,"From what I know (couple friends in the Stats/ML and the SCS programs), Stats/ML at CMU is more of an applied Stats/Data Science degree rather than a CS-oriented (SCS) degree. For Stats/ML, there's much less emphasis and rigor placed on important fundamentals of CS like data structures, algorithms & theory, software & systems, etc.

On the contrary, at Berkeley, majoring in CS will expose you to all of these core CS topics very thoroughly (making you much more hirable in tech), and on top of that you can go for a double major in CogSci (as you mentioned in your post), or DataSci or Stats (to learn more about ML and Stats). Even if you decide not to double in DS or Stats, some ML-related CS upper-divs are generally hardcore versions of math/stats classes anyway (for example, EECS 126: Probability and Random Processes covers all of Stat 134/140: Probability in the first 6 weeks, and goes on to do much more).

Add that to the fact that Berkeley is 1/3rd of the price, and it's a no brainer in my eyes (although, definitely also ask for opinions on r/CMU so you can make the most informed decision possible, especially since you can't make campus visits due to the unfortunate corona virus situation)."
