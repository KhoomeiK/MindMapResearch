ApplyingToCollege,fpfibty,t3_gd1v8w,1588572119.0,"YES I’ve only visited my dream school (but I got rejected) and safety so it only came down to 2 UC schools (reach and safety). I never imagined myself going to the safety since I never had an interest in it, but I started considering it since the other UC is far home, so I haven’t been able to get a vibe from it (other than stereotypes). I’ve committed to the reach school since it’ll bring more opportunities for me and although I wanted a laidback college experience, I know I can handle this school (hopefully)."
ApplyingToCollege,fpffhkl,t3_gd4x5l,1588569708.0,ME I literally had a breakdown last night because I’m terrified of dropping out of college or not being in the right major. Wish I was  born into a rich corporate family so I could chill 😞😞

berkeley,fpelk27,t3_fqdm9d,1588549892.0,"Coming in for CS under L&S and how hard is it to eventually declare the major with no CS experience and being bad at math?(I took Calc AB(2) and BC(4;ab subscore: 4) already but I don’t think I was the greatest at it since I never rlly understood the material) I’m scared of not meeting the gpa requirement and having to settle for data science since CS is really the only major I’m interested in (STEM wise). My other option is UCR, where I was admitted directly to CS but I’ve heard it’s more engineering based, so I can see myself having more difficulty there, and I’d probably be better starting off at a CC where I can explore other majors. 

Also would you say that as someone who hates physics, I would end up disliking CS here? Currently taking AP physics 1 and this is the only class I truly regret taking, and I’m predicting a 1 or 2(if I’m lucky) with this years exam. 

Also, I would like to be an ethical hacker but have recently discovered the world of UI/UX design. As much as i like art/graphic design, i didnt want to major in that since I felt it doesn’t allow me many job opportunities. I’ve heard the art program here isn’t great, and the only UI/UX/design program offered here is the boot camp. A psychology or graphic design major would be better for landing UI or UX design, but I really think a CS major is safer choice for me to have (in terms of job opportunities ). Is there any hope of exploring art/design here or would I be better off at an other college?

Lastly, CS is the only major I’d like to have STEMwise, but I am considering architecture. I would hate to go into grad school however, and so I’m looking more into the other CED majors like landscape architecture. Does anyone have any experience here and would you say that Berkeley prepared you well for the work field/internships?"

berkeley,forv8bw,t3_fqdm9d,1588019101.0,"Anyone know if it’s possible to take prerequisites (basically the weeder classes) at a CC over the summer? Intended CS major hoping to get rid of the weeder clases as soon as possible and with classes being online (most likely) during fall, I don’t wanna stress myself out at home. Or is it only UCB that I can take classes at during the summer?

On the other hand, with no CS background, would it be useful for me to instead take intro CS courses through my CC. I don’t care about the college credit transferring. I just want to go in feeling ready to take the classes at Berkeley, but I’m not sure how to choose the right classes with lessons that would be  applicable at berkeley."

Would you advise doing this for Computer Science, even when it’s an impacted major at both of these schools? 1/2 of me is considering attending Berkeley and deciding whether CS is right for me/exploring other majors, but with online classes, the other 1/2 is considering CC since I’m still torn whether I should give up on attending LA, considering that I may get rejected from both the second time. Would you say that this type of plan would need me to be dead set on what major I want?"
