Probably biased of me to say this Bc I don’t really know how UCLA is truly like but I felt like if I was at LA I’d be pushed to go to football games and parties all the time and I’d feel like I’m missing out if I don’t go but it’s not me to be THAT social. At SD just join clubs and people are extremely nice and welcoming!

Also, love the beaches here it’s so nice to have beaches so close. The sound of the ocean and the view of sunsets within 10 min walk is amazing."
UCSD,fozgeni,t3_gaecv8,1588190221.0,"I did because I felt like UCSD fits my personality more. Visited UCLA and just felt like the vibe isn’t really for me and I’d feel really uncomfortable there. Also one of my close friend picked UCSD over UCLA as well so attending college with her is pretty great.

Also I’d have to take lots of physics classes for CS if I did attend Ucla and I hate physics lol."
