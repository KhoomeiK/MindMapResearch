ucla,fpknmsk,t3_ge100n,1588697860.0,all you hear are crickets from /u/uclaelectionsboard as to why they allowed blatant voter manipulation
ucla,fo93jio,t3_g5j1i8,1587609727.0,"So it turns out I wasn‚Äôt allowed into ZBT or SAE because I was circumcised.

Apparently you need to be a complete dick."
ucla,fo3mnf0,t3_g5ihjv,1587489450.0,"I had been digging deeper into the referendum and had uncovered a bit of this info, but it seems like you know a lot more than I could've found out myself. Wow thanks a lot for this!

On top of it being a stupid idea to increase fees during a pandemic/recession in general, this information just puts a nail in their coffin!"
ucla,fnygx94,t1_fnygh9p,1587362746.0,"I'm reading more into it, and I see that it is specifically about lining the pockets of ASUCLA, which is broke af right now and in need of a stimulus. Only a fraction of the money will go to all these marginalized groups. ASUCLA is the puppet master."
ucla,fnwqcj8,t3_g1zfx1,1587323370.0,Hi. I can help put together graphic rebuttals of Q&A graphics the CUB referendum people posted. I have counter points for each one.

ucla,fmv71wi,t3_fxh9eg,1586407808.0,What are they doing?
ucla,fmu7hpr,t1_fmu75rd,1586386005.0,"Haha nah dude I wish

Tho I do also consider my self a big time jerker"
ucla,fmu61ji,t3_fxfwid,1586385245.0,"Lol same, except I pause my lecture videos to beat my meat, which extends the time I need to finish watching the lecture. It ends up taking way longer than 50 minutes. And it doesn‚Äôt necessarily take way longer because of the act itself, since it only takes like 4-5 minutes of actual stroking to get myself off. It‚Äôs because of the set-up time (Akin to how NFL games feature only like 7 minutes of actual play; the other 3 hours being timeouts, commercials and play calling, etc). So no, it‚Äôs not because of the stroking. 

It‚Äôs moreso the fact that I have to find the right video to fap to. And that could take anywhere from 5 - 30 minutes, no joke. I mean, I do have my go-to vids if I want something fast, but usually, like more than half the time, I need something new, which can take forever to find. I tried pornhub premium because they were offering a free trial during COVID-19 and my friend told me that premium only shows you all the best videos and that you therefore don‚Äôt need to search as long to find a good one. But honestly, the filtered ‚Äúhigh quality videos‚Äù don‚Äôt really suit my tastes. I mean sure, they‚Äôre longer, are in HD, always include the money shot (very important IMO), and feature the most beautiful performers and whatnot. But that‚Äôs not necessarily what I look for in a porno vid.

I like more amateur type stuff. Stuff that‚Äôs not so contrived and artificial. Stuff that looks like it could‚Äôve been made by a couple of people you know, you know? So pornhub premium hasn‚Äôt done much to curb the time I spend to find the right video. Hell, it may even take longer through premium to find the right vid because all the supposed ‚Äúinferior‚Äù vids that I like are buried further. And, therefore, it still takes forever to get through a whole lecture even though it‚Äôs only 50 minutes of content lol"
