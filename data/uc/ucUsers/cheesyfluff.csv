I was too excited to notice that my face was washed out haha"
weightlifting,fpkxpn2,t3_gdq1za,1588702846.0,"I took a selfie with bad lighting with him in NY about three years ago, seemed like a chill guy and it was cool to meet him."
weightlifting,fph6yi0,t1_fpg5bux,1588616054.0,Looks like a normal squat to me
weightlifting,fpfbtqg,t3_gd22qg,1588566778.0,"Technique dependent, if you have issues with hangs it's usually due to not having a fast turnover or deep bottom position. From personal experience I would say most people can hang more than power though, as you don't need to get as much height on the bar."
ucla,fpahvcm,t1_fpag6vr,1588448499.0,"I was in the school of engineering so I guess not haha. I did have to take some lower div math classes as pre reqs for my major and they didn't really stand out, I covered almost all of it in high school already. Math is different in that a lot can be learned on your own by reading and thinking, so I see your point. And my bad, wasn't aware you were a transfer."
ucla,fpafciw,t1_fp8oynb,1588446999.0,"It's the culture and the resources. For computer science at least, our school will cover materials at deeper level than any regular state school because we have the faculty needed to offer more courses like parallel and distributed computing, grad courses, etc. The professors put a lot of work into making high quality assignments that serve as useful teaching tools that keep up with the fast pace of the quarter. Also since everyone does pretty well academically we cater towards the more driven students, resulting in higher expectations from professors that force you to learn more. A friend of mine from Cal Poly SLO would always complain about how his school was just a lot of busywork. I didn't find that to be true for most of my upper div classes at UCLA, they really made you think about interesting problems and concepts. The only classes that were busywork were usually GE's and lower divs that were too easy. I hated doing the assignments since I'd learn nothing from them. Since you're only a sophomore you might be at that point. Lastly, school rankings also take into account other factors like quality of life and finances, so I wouldn't put too much weight into them."
weightlifting,fp8zcmg,t1_fp7qhu3,1588408405.0,Your comp lifts are pretty high for those squat numbers
Buckethead,fo4ld54,t1_fo4k2v3,1587506513.0,I agree it's strange the watermark is blacked out. I see [STATIC NOISES] is on the artist's website as well as the reddit account. Hopefully OP can address this.
Buckethead,fo4inmr,t1_fo4fh58,1587505113.0,Looks like he didn't like his old signature and adopted a new one
Buckethead,fo4ev7u,t1_fo47hia,1587503155.0,"The reddit account also has other artworks on the artist's profile and he claims to be in the same location, looks like OP is the artist."

weightlifting,fnwvqrq,t1_fnw066t,1587326393.0,"Same look and feel so far as the regular rogue bumpers I've used, nothing negative to say about them."
weightlifting,fnuwpal,t1_fnuuzcy,1587273135.0,"I hadn't really made anything before either and mainly used a handsaw, one drill, and some sandpaper. The bigger cuts I got done at home Depot. My dad made some fixes to our furniture before which is why I had the tools and wood already."
weightlifting,fnun45p,t1_fnujepd,1587266076.0,"I had most of the wood needed for the top and the horizontal supports lying around my garage, so I just had to get 4 4x4s which were $11 each, plus screws so maybe around $60. Later I saw that there were cheaper 4x4s that were only $7 each, which could have brought the cost down. The risers for squatting were also mostly made using some leftover wood."
weightlifting,fnsnpp5,t3_g31lak,1587225312.0,"The reddit app should have a video post option, otherwise you can link it from youtube"
ucla,fnman58,t1_fnloi63,1587068011.0,"As someone working with summer sessions, there has yet to be a decision on whether session C will be online as far I know. So regarding fall it's all just speculation dependent on the state of the pandemic at that time."
weightlifting,fnec9mm,t1_fndnc3h,1586886788.0,yeah clarence kennedy has pretty good jump technique considering he does tricking
weightlifting,fncwscg,t1_fncqjvv,1586849925.0,"I love your posts bro they're hilarious, don't stop weightlifting and keep posting your lifts"
weightlifting,fnb0s4i,t3_g0pti2,1586807224.0,"His approach isn't very good, if he better transferred his running momentum vertically he'd get much higher. Also it takes some skill to make sure the ball stays in your hand, I was trying to dunk on a low rim for fun and still missing even though my hand was much higher than it.

If any weightlifter could dunk I'd put by money on Lasha, that man is 6' 6""."

weightlifting,fmni3xh,t3_fwbgbp,1586226572.0,All the cheap ones are sold out... Good excuse to splurge and get a full comp set. I just ordered [this](https://www.fringesport.com/collections/bumper-plates/products/kilo-color-competition-bumper-plates?variant=11656800600111) one over the weekend
weightlifting,fmk944i,t1_fm9w0u5,1586147786.0,"I actually just made [these](https://imgur.com/a/qePgYAb) today haha  
Was relatively cheap, about $40 for 4x4s and $15 for screws, plus some extra wood in my garage."
