ucla,fonp4rg,t1_fokwxii,1587923740.0,"Being familiar with c++ is a big plus (no pun intended). If you believe you have a good understanding of the language and all of the data structures (all stl containers, simple sorting algorithms, etc), you’d probably satisfy the first two cs courses (cs31 and cs32 covers c++ in depth and some data structures). But after the first two, the rest of core courses cover variety of topics.
For example, OS class teaches you how to use/create/blend your programming tasks with OS APIs which I find it very useful since we need to have better understanding of the platforms that we are working on. Hence, their materials are very dense and considered one of most difficult course for cs (uses c/c++ for most).
Algorithm class is fun and difficult. There’s little to no coding involved since they are covering theoretical level. But if you invest time in this course and master it, doing a leetcode becomes a breeze (again, very hard though).
In terms of “hands on” materials, its hard to comment since i didnt go to other school. But UCLA offers multiple special courses (under CS188) in each quarter that covers different topics that are popular/important in the industries. For instance, I have taken computer vision (machine learning with images. Most used for photography industry or autonomous driving cars), HCI (human-computer interaction. improved my design of program for better user experience), and distributed systems (clouding computing, infrastructure, etc) which helped me to broaden my range of study.
Anywho, dont expect to do too much as a undergrad. I mean, the companies wont expect too much from you either. Like i have taken at least 4 different types of machine learning courses but industries are looking for grad students for these area. The amount of things you can learn as an undergrad has limits due to all the GEs and such. I would say pick a school that you want to blend in. If you are seeking for better program/education, you can find those for grad school. Just my thoughts."

I initially got a triple but they switched it to single after I submitted the request (although I kinda regretted because they are super expensive).

Also, there's a dorm building only for housing transfers. You might want to look into that as well."
ucla,foj5lbg,t1_foinjqo,1587809284.0,"Hmm.. this is a hard question. I would say many CS courses in UCLA are theoretical and gets deeper into the fundamentals. So instead of just throw you a Python language and tell you to build something, you will start with C++, understanding the structure of coding design, then you'll get to learn all other things such as APIs, different style of languages (imperative, functional, logic), etc etc.

All in all, I do believe I learned quite a lot from our CS classes. Hence, I was able to land a job in FAANG when I was nobody before coming into UCLA."

ucla,foj3xr7,t1_foiezub,1587807402.0,"**First and foremost, relax**. Once the school starts, you won’t have much of freedom. I was worried about the same thing as you did when I transferred in 2018. I been taking extra CS classes in other community colleges during summer, making sure I'll be competitive. Although it did help me a little bit, the amount of workload from assignments and projects easily burnt me out. And I wished I could have well rested during the summer.

**Be prepare to juggle the workloads**. Considering that I have been taking 25+ units every semester in CC, I though I will never have an issue with time management. Oh boy I was wrong. The moment you step a foot into the campus, your timer starts ticking. There are so many things that will eat your time. Figuring out where the classes/buildings are, understanding the interfaces of CCLE, Piazza, and ucla csweb, planning and adjusting your finances, etc etc. Also don't forget that as a transfer, you don't get the luxury of enrolling filler GE courses to balance the workload. Since you completed all/most of GEs in CC, your only option is to fill 3 (4, if you wanna graduate on time) most competitive major courses.

**Expect to study on your own**. Majority of CS classes expect a lot from you. Like, A LOT from you to the point where they teach you the structure of an Array and expecting you to build hash map from scratch (bit exaggerating but you get the idea). We can't blame them though. UCLA does have high standards towards their CS students and the standards are still growing... for some reason. So be ready to do large amount of self-study outside of the class.

**Don't take Eggert**. I love his lectures and projects. But I also hate his lectures and projects. You'll understand once you take him.

Also, don't forget to **prepare your resume and practice for upcoming career fair** in week 2/3 of Fall quarter. Although being a UCLA students do give you an advantage, you still need to work your ass off to land an internship (especially for first timer). Good luck and welcome to UCLA."
