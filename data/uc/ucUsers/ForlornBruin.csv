ucla,fpat6lg,t1_fox7fmj,1588455194.0,"FWIW, I hated 7B. I loved 7A and 7C. As an engineering major, I just personally found the workload reasonable and content fun."
ucla,foojbn3,t3_g85r0h,1587940097.0,"Chem 30A, period. I still have legitimate nightmares about failing the midterm."
ucla,foocvyt,t1_foo9efa,1587936739.0,"Yeah, go to the CLC sessions. The LA told me that the worksheets there are old exam questions. The LA's there also have a good understanding of how the test is built (i.e. they can help you figure what to focus on when you studying)."
ucla,foo0p4a,t1_fonz9wq,1587930207.0,"That's interesting! A lot of the folks in my major said that the LS series was our easiest set of requirements (i.e. my friend group and I almost didn't study at all for the exams, did largely pretty well), but for physics 1 series, chem 30 series, or math 32b we studied our butts off. I, personally, am not pre-med, so I don't know how the LS series compares to the MCAT content. 

The CLC sessions would normally come in clutch (i.e. I'd go to those once a week)."
ucla,fonpr45,t3_g89blt,1587924078.0,"It was annoying; questions were tricky for no reason, I would lose points for misreading and misinterpreting questions, rather than a lack of knowledge.

However, compared to other lower div south campus classes (chem 20, chem 30, physics 1 series, math) I found it a lot more tame. You guys complain about the 7 series, but it's honestly really fair. The exams are consistent from professor to professor, and if you wanted a good grade, it was attainable (as long as you put the time in). 

That's better than most south campus classes I had that assumed people had knowledge from high school (benefiting kids who took more AP classes/had gr8 teachers)."
ucla,fonp9gt,t3_g8hv72,1587923812.0,wait until you take physics 1b and 32b... a terrible terrible cross over episode

ucla,fnnurgk,t3_g1xxup,1587102348.0,"My skepticism with the referendum has nothing to do with race, it has to do with my own family's financials + USAC's general monetary incompetence.

The fact that 2 million in funds went ""missing"" from the CPO is unacceptable. 

""Well, USAC isn't the CPO, it's not their fault!"" 

Well, they were the ones who allocated the money in the first place for the CPO to lose. They serve us, the student body, and I expected better.

Yeah, a lot of UCLA students are socioeconomically privileged, but not all of them are. These are rough times; a supply and demand shock recession is no time to ask for more money. People are food insecure and worried about paying for their mortgages. If you want to fund a black resource center, cool, organize a private effort and let those who want to donate and fund it during these harsh times do it."
