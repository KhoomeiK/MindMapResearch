htgawm,fpkvnov,t1_fpkji25,1588701831.0,That's something really hard I've realized about asking more questions about people as an adult and making some hypotheses about people's childhoods that led them to be that way. It makes it hard to truly think about anyone as a real villain.
CaptchaArt,fpjmhwk,t1_fpfhet2,1588674031.0,Thank you for taking the time to decipher. Lockdown has made my brain mush
CaptchaArt,fpjmd5s,t3_gd89nh,1588673899.0,yesss
CaptchaArt,fpjm8xj,t3_gdsa3s,1588673780.0,Love the level of detail on this! You're doing God's work. <3
CaptchaArt,fpjm7h2,t1_fpjk04b,1588673738.0,"Is ""leg day skipper"" still offensive? Or have you guys reclaimed it?"
htgawm,fpjlvya,t1_fpg3sin,1588673411.0,"I agree that talking about cycles of abuse is important, but you hit the nail on the head! The writers shoehorned in this plot way too late and too superficially for the viewers to care about that or Sam's backstory at all. It seems like the writers were thinking through the arc of all the characters and realized that they weren't giving the villains as much fleshing out in the story as the protagonists and found a way to give Sam a reason for doing what he did while finding a neat way to tie up who kept sending the law after AK.

Their treatment of this issue ended up coming off as a cheap soap opera twist, which isn't sensitive to what male sexual abuse victims deserve in 2020."
htgawm,fpji7ve,t1_fp4ihe3,1588669462.0,Sounds like the writers are saying his sister raped him as a kid and groomed him into the incest?  :/

rupaulsdragrace,fp8zth7,t1_fp8zkws,1588408898.0,What about Lil Snackie working it the whole time though! I wanna hit the club with her!
sandiego,fp3xsmu,t1_fp2mvlz,1588287807.0,Not necessarily! Any nice view will do!
dogswithjobs,fomfd2r,t3_g87v5x,1587887991.0,That snooooooot! <3
rupaulsdragrace,folpgr9,t1_fok5ev4,1587867412.0,True! So much of how we feel about the jokes and comments the contestants make is shaped by editing and the reactions of the judges in the moment :( But alas... it is what it is.
rupaulsdragrace,foixmi3,t1_foitb1z,1587800513.0,Exactly! I thought Widow's parody on real life right-wing fire and brimstone politicians was super funny! And funnier because it was deadpan. She was committed to the character and never cracked up like Heidi or the others. I frankly thought it was racist that they said she came off angry when she was just being loud and serious. Thought more of her jokes landed for me than Pieface or Gigi.
30ROCK,fo5x9tt,t1_fo3ot7i,1587538733.0,ahaha just saw that ep today. Rewatching the series with my husband
berkeley,fo5vu1b,t3_g5p4ds,1587537352.0,I'm not a praying person but sending you positive vibes! If I was trapped at home with with my folks right now I would've ran off to live among the animals of the forest by now.
berkeley,fo5vqiu,t1_fo5h6cb,1587537262.0,best advice
running,fnghpea,t3_g1lquf,1586932582.0,"Jeezus I can't believe you ran 13.1 in the snow! Congrats! Hope you were alone given the social distancing situation? I've never ran more than 9 alone - I always have to take a buddy even when I'm training or I'll die of boredom.

My first half marathon race in the Grand Tetons was chill! Was supposed to be a loop course, but a bridge flooded so it was an out and back, which made the race not seem as long, and I passed by some slower friends on my way back who were in the race too and seeing them gave me a jolt of energy. Part of it was pavement, part of it a wide dirt trail and it was pretty. Weather was perfect. I died the last mile - calves started seizing up and my last mile split was like 2 mins slower than the others.

Both halfs I've ran my knees were shot for a day or two. Pop some ibuprofen for the swelling and I would rest if you can for a few days. But then again you're young and made of rubber so you'll probs heal faster than I do."
rupaulsdragrace,fn2lwad,t1_fn2laew,1586593909.0,Yeah I think Jackie was put over the edge by all the details in her outfit and at least attempting to be Madonna in her number instead of Heidi who was shredding the dancing but wasn't emulating Madonna
USMC,flibsqf,t3_foaeyq,1585179269.0,Tell friends and family to sign [this](http://chng.it/VRMYvwzR7D) to get the Sec of Defense to make a blanket policy for all the DoD.
