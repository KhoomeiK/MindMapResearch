If the stock price goes up the options are 'in the money' and you can buy it for whatever your options were priced at. If it doesn't then you don't exercise them. When you leave a company you usually have 90 days to exercise. At a public company you are also restricted in your ability to sell based on non-public information, so often they rely on progromatic selling.

The other guy mentioned RSUs which are fake stock options. The company puts a cap on how much it can go up. Fuck RSUs.

People are commonly given them at management levels. More commonly further down the food chain where cash is tight."

 Trump is all show, assisted by mental midgets who he keeps cutting down so they don't crowd him out. Bush had Cheney and Rumsfeld; if ever there was a deep state it's them.

The only way to build a railroad in a few years is to be among the best at ignoring the destruction of native populations that will inevitably occur.
