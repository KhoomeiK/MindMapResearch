And then we have New York City, which has had 0.12% of their *total population* die of COVID-19 (meaning COVID-19 is listed as a primary or contributing factor on death certificates). If the IFR is truly a worst-case of 0.15% then New York should be at near 100% total infection now, but we still have yet to see a significant slowdown in death counts.

It's interesting you accuse scientists unaffiliated with any government, that have published results with detailed methods sections, of political bias, but seem to accept an IFR from FEMA at face value without any supporting evidence or description of methodology, when FEMA is a non-scientific US government agency with a consistent history of being politicized."

For that, at this level of transmission, we're looking at >80%, probably >90% necessary for herd immunity. It is true that at 50% infected, the rate of transmission will be noticeably lower now than the rate was initially. But this is a double edged sword, as it only lengths the time it takes to reach that 80-90% level."

FWIW, specificity issues *cannot* give a false negative. They can only give a false positive. Conversely, sensitivity issues can give false negatives, but not false positives.

COVID19,fnf7ol4,t1_fndqk8u,1586902928.0,"Okay...but South Korea's testing was sufficient to totally squash their outbreak. And, their positive test rate was much lower than the US.

If you look more than surface deep at the data, it's obvious South Korea identified a much higher proportion of their cases by testing. Their test per capita is similar to the US because they did so much testing early on, there isn't a widespread outbreak anymore, they just don't need to test as near as much as the USA still does.

If Korea was missing a large chunk of their COVID cases, they wouldn't be at a sub-50 case count per day."

If the road to herd immunity takes 12-18 months, which is certainly a distinct possibility given the still-possible ranges of r0/IFR, then wouldn't it be smart to at least try a moderate social distancing, mask wearing, testing tracing and isolating strategy until a vaccine is available in 12-18 months anyway? Lets not pretend we could actually isolate and protect at-risk groups for a year while we try to gun for herd immunity."

COVID19,fn4gnsm,t1_fn4eud2,1586641004.0,"Here in California they are also requiring skilled nursing facilities to accept COVID patients, and I do agree it's a terrible policy. In the end it came down to liability and hospitals having better lobbyists than the nursing homes- hospitals want to wash their hands of COVID liability. It seems like the state is realizing their mistake finally though, in LA they're transferring healthy COVID-free patients out of affected nursing homes and onto the Mercy hospital ship. Too little, too late though.

All levels of policy makers right now should be planning a way to essentially run two healthcare systems in parallel: COVID and COVID-free. We should be designating specific hospitals as COVID facilities, and *no one* should be admitted to other hospitals or skilled nursing facilities unless they test negative for an active COVID infection."
COVID19,fn4dnw5,t1_fn49vt7,1586639238.0,"How are you defining ""high r0"" and ""low IFR""? It's pretty clear now the IFR will end up less than 1%, but also pretty clear that absent specific policy interventions to seal off at-risk groups, the IFR is above 0.3%. And r0 estimates are still estimates, we still don't have a good handle on population-wide infection estimates. But even if we were already at 10-15% infection rates now, the high r0 needed for that rate would mean herd immunity is only reached at >80% infected, and since r0 declines as immunity increases, truly reaching herd immunity will take many months. So I'm not convinced yet that we should have taken the strategy of locking up the elderly and letting the infection play out with everyone else. I don't see how it's possible to keep the elderly sealed off from the virus for 12 months. Containment would fail. I'm still more comfortable with a strategy of immediate suppression followed by moderate social distancing and localized tracing and isolation until we can put out a vaccine, aka the Korean and soon to be northern Europe approach. I don't see how else we can realistically avoid the catastrophe that is total spread among the elderly population.

I do agree though that this crisis has exposed just how slowly new scientific data travels down the pipeline from laboratory to local public health officials. Data presented by our local public health agency in a recent meeting suggested that infections under current restrictions wouldn't peak until *August*. That's an absurd prediction that aligns with no public model or any data collected in the past two months, and I don't know how they can justify policy based on a model that broken.

I think and hope that the post-mortem for this crisis will be a might tighter alignment between frontline medical science and public health policy."
COVID19,fn46zmz,t1_fn3rfec,1586635329.0,"Their data showed that rates of infection among front-line workers were the same as desk staff etc in the hospital. However that's not really evidence that you can extrapolate this infection rate to the entire city. Just spending the whole day inside a hospital building, especially a hospital near capacity filled with highly infectious patients, would have to but you at greater risk of infection compared to the vast majority of Madrid residents stuck in their homes, barely interacting with anyone."
COVID19,fn46jt2,t1_fn3psgw,1586635075.0,Yeah I think it's pretty well established at this point that if you are under 60 and do not have serious pre-existing conditions you are at very low risk of death with COVID-19. Two qualifiers that describe the vast majority of healthcare workers.
LosAngeles,fn4610v,t1_fn1tpmv,1586634773.0,"I agree that many public agencies at all levels of government (local, state, federal) are throwing out data from ""models"" but not disclosing any details of the model, which as a scientist is personally very disconcerting. The Santa Barbara County Public Health department gave a presentation to our Board of Supervisors last week and threw up some epidemic curves claiming that with social distancing, we wouldn't reach a peak in new infections until late summer, and policies would have to be in place until November. Which is absurd, and flies in the face of basically every current publicly available model and all data we have collected thus far. So I am very concerned that parts of the government are working off of bad data and bad models.

The reason I'm not worried, though, is once we see cases and deaths start to decline precipitously, we will see governments scrambling to loosen restrictions. It's worth noting these restrictions are KILLING tax revenue to local and state governments at the moment, there's nothing they'd like more than to open back up. The models are bad right now, but we're going to see rapid course corrections once the hard data starts to roll in."
