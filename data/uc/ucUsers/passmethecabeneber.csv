In the work week, there are five days. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are odd and Tuesday and Thursday are even. In college, I have recurring classes MWF and TH, so even classes and odd classes."
UCSantaBarbara,foznuwj,t3_gad7tb,1588193790.0,"I have a ton of friends who are probably similar in weight to you, there is no issue from my perspective, but I don’t have the first hand experience of being overweight at UCSB. I’m in a sorority and many of my friends in it are what I would consider overweight, nobody cares in my sorority although I can’t necessarily speak for how others in Greek life judge."

AskALiberal,foxcms0,t1_foxa3wl,1588140009.0,"As a freshman in college having gone to a public high school in the US, that was absolutely not the case. Freshman and sophomore year were very planned out, you only had choices in one elective, what language you take, and the level of class (regular, honors, AP). For junior and senior year there was more variation but you were essentially choosing 2 out of 10 offered AP classes for each junior and senior year. In these classes, depending on the quality of the teaching, is just preparing for the AP test, not working on critical thinking and breadth of education. Each student is set on a path starting freshman and sophomore year that determines how far they will be able to go in their coursework."
unpopularopinion,fonwzcl,t3_g8hca4,1587928118.0,"In the US so many kids are still in the middle of their senior year of high school when they turn 18. It has never made sense to me that a parent would kick their kid out at 18 when they are still involved in state mandated schooling. I agree with the premise but I feel like practically the question should be about parents kicking their kids out post-graduation, not post-turning 18."
UCSantaBarbara,fol855x,t3_g831g5,1587856771.0,"I’m planning for the best case scenario, that everything is back to normal. Even if it is online, I plan to move back to IV and take classes online from my apartment there."
AskAnAmerican,fojo06w,t3_g7pktr,1587825636.0,"I am in a special program at a public college in California and my intro major classes don’t have exams and are pass/fail. Instead of exams, we are graded on weekly homework assignments and corrections. Additionally, we present a mini lecture on one random topic from the course at the end of the quarter for participation."
minimalism,foer5fb,t3_g70a8i,1587711949.0,"My Powerbeats pro headphones. Bluetooth, 8 hr charge, comfortable enough to wear for extended periods of time and they wrap around my ear so they’re great for exercise too. I got them with the purchase of an iPad that I use for school and I haven’t replaced them for 3 years which feels like a long time for technology now days, especially since AirPods came out."
changemyview,fnlo8ai,t3_g2h95g,1587056884.0,"I think something that needs to be taken into account is that Xanax and Valium are almost entirely prescribed drugs to manage anxiety. They are meant to bring people down to a regular level, not to bring them even lower. I’ll give it to you that they might have similar effects, but their purposes are entirely different. Someone taking Xanax responsibly will take regular doses as prescribed by a doctor, not only in social situations."

AskALiberal,fndyrvq,t3_g15s7g,1586879984.0,"I wouldn’t consider it racist, but cultural misappropriation. The issue with it is that many people unknowingly use the racist system to benefit from the cultures of others. For non-blacks, wearing styles typically worn by blacks can be “cool” and “hip” whereas blacks wearing the same styles are “unprofessional”. So it’s offensive to some people to see their cultural styles and practices being praised on others and being looked down upon for wearing them themselves. Disclaimer, I am not black and I do not speak for the black community, but I have done some research and this is my understanding of it."
AskALiberal,fn4r2df,t3_fzjtvg,1586647134.0,I don’t think all religious organizations should be tax exempt
AskAnAmerican,fmfbcos,t3_fuwnj9,1586023704.0,"My mom is Methodist (a pretty moderate Protestant Christian sect) and my dad is an atheist. When they married they agreed that they would raise their kids in the church (baptize them, take them to church, have them go through conformation classes) but wouldn’t push either belief system on them. So I was baptized and went to Sunday school. I did youth group and went through conformation classes (basically learning about what the church believes to see if you want to be a member of that church formally) although I didn’t get confirmed. Even though I didn’t get confirmed, I still participated in youth group activities because I liked the people and activities they did. I don’t think I would have necessarily been atheist if my dad didn’t talk to me about why he didn’t believe or if both my parents were Christian. I think I had the best of both worlds, I had a community through the church that I enjoyed but I realized that ultimately I need to think for myself and not blindly follow doctrine."
