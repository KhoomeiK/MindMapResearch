AoNoExorcist,fp4ssc7,t3_gb3koa,1588306466.0,"1. I feel like using religion as a basis creates easy to define power systems, symbolism, and and good/evil in fantasy stories, which tend to be plentiful in anime. Like the beginning of a series can start with a long infodump about sigamooleans and bahahoos (idk made up names) and explain that one group has done many bad things over the centuries with examples to prove that to the audience, or you can say we are humans and we fight demons and we follow the god(s) and get help from the spirits—that’s ample backstory and justification and we can get on with the story.

2. I’m not religious (never went to church or anything), but seeing references to things other people are interested in is pretty enlightening in a casual observer sort of way. I’m fine with characters saying religious teachings as long as it’s used to further the plot. I haven’t had a problem with Blue Exorcist at all

3. At least I think I’ve seen more Christian-based shows in anime than in American TV (and definitely more Japanese-spiritual shows like Noragami), but I’m not sure if that’s true because I don’t follow American TV very much at all. I couldn’t imagine The Demon is a Part Timer ever being written and published in the US though because of the unironically humanized, badass yet cutely-drawn demons/satan"
