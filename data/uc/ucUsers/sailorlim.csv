UCSD,fphxp22,t3_gdkmcy,1588629733.0,Yes! I’m taking a class with one of my favorite professors (shoutout to Styler) but everything’s flying over my head. I’m really trying but this entire virtual platform on which the curriculum currently exists makes the experience itself feel so unaccessible and unauthentic

UCSD,fnkb19x,t3_g28zyj,1587020581.0,Yup yup yup! Takes me four times as much effort to even do a fourth of what I did pre-UC Zoom. Something about online education adding an extra layer of abstraction from my curriculum just de-legitimizes the entire experience for me

teachinginkorea,fn541rv,t1_fn4znmi,1586655418.0,Ah ok! I just thought doing the TEFL might as well be something I should do since I got a scholarship from my school to take their TEFL course for free (abt $3k).
teachinginkorea,fn4n83n,t1_fn4ji81,1586644848.0,"Hi! Honestly, my religion major was largely just something I tacked on for fun. I’ve completed most of my classes for my linguistics major, and realized I’d be graduating early (too soon, for my taste) unless I picked up another major. The religion program at my school has an intersectional approach that combines classes from other departments (literature, history, philosophy) and I’ve always had an interest in religion on an intellectual level, so I thought it would be fun for me. 

With that being said, I understand it’s not the most practical major, but it appealed to me due to its well-roundedness and research opportunities (small department faculty, allows for easier acess to professors for letters of recommendation and research advisors). Honestly, I’ve looked at other majors and other disciplines, but I can’t align myself with other ones as they don’t ignite an interest in me. Although I understand that sounds naïve, I had already made the mistake of choosing a major because it would have provided me with an opportunity to pursue a career I had minimal interest for, but paid good money (Specch Pathology, although I still find this career path valuable and enriching, just not for me). However, if you have any recommendations for an alternate major, I’m all ears!"
TEFL,fn3aogi,t3_fvtd5u,1586616741.0,"Hey guys! I’m currently an undergrad, but I’m heavily considering going into TEFL after I graduate, and potentially making a more long-term career out of it! 

I’m a double major in linguistics/study of religion, and most of my job experience has to do with language instruction/acquisition for students whose first language is not English. Most of my students/clients are from Asia, so ideally I’d like to begin my TEFL journey there. By the time I graduate I expect to have my certifications in TEFL and CELTA. 

With those things being said, is it still feasible for me to land a job as a TEFL in the coming years (specifically, 2022 onwards)? I initially wanted to try starting out in Korea/Taiwan/Japan, but seeing as how it’s most competitive there, I thought starting elsewhere may be more doable. Is getting my TEFL/CELTA only worth it if it’s face-to-face instruction, or will an online course suffice? Additionally, are there other things during my undergrad education that I should do to bolster my competitiveness as an applicant? Thanks so much!"

AskReddit,fmrmws3,t3_fwx9pc,1586328240.0,"Crona from Soul Eater, such an important figure for me as they were the first gender non-conforming character I’d ever seen in any kind of media. They were born into a ruthless environment dictated by their domineering mother. Their emotionally closing themself off from the world by building psychological walls and subsequently struggling to break those same walls down reflected a narrative that was both powerfully universal yet chillingly personal. Although I don’t believe they deserved the ending they got in the manga, I think it’s more important to acknowledge their effort to right the wrongs they’d committed as opposed to simply displacing blame onto the maladaptive behavior they cultivated as a result of a cruel upbringing. A character who undoubtedly committed many egregious acts, yet revealed a tortured soul which underlied each of their crimes with a sense of deep melancholy. At the time I watched Soul Eater I was too young to truly appreciate the nuances of their character. In growing up, I find the fragmented parts of myself as reflections of their own sufferings. Crona taught me that evil and its varying magnitudes don’t always start out in shrieks, but could come from whimpers and tragic resignation, from something human."
UCSD,fmpf76p,t3_fw9f8r,1586279759.0,"Same! My neighbors upstairs are stupid loud (they have an entire sound system) plus my mom and my brother think Zoom means I’m on vacation (???). Something that’s really helped me was putting on my earbuds and playing white noise! You can find white noise playlists on spotify that can go on for HOURS, and it’s honestly so handy. I even listen to it (with earbuds) to fall asleep bc sometimes my neighbors will blast music at midnight."
