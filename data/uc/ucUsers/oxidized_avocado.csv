Honestly just doing the bare minimum, and I feel guilty because my classes are actually interesting and relevant to my career. However, the psychological impact of being quarantine is probably more than we realize, so do what you need to do to cope! 

On the days I actually need to get some work done, I've found actually getting ready in the morning helps (even if I'm changing into a fresh pair of sweats or workout clothes) and then trying to work in a room that is not my bedroom.

if you feel like you're dying and need someone to talk to, PM me!"

I took data 100 after my internship and i ended up knowing the first 4 weeks of content in the class already, because i picked it up on the job / it was taught to me by my manager."
