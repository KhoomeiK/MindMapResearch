StudentNurse,fpdbzi0,t3_gcrnsk,1588523993.0,"Lots of good info here. I would add learn your teacher as fast as possible. You'll learn to know if they are the ones to trick you or not. And most importantly, there are many nursing school specific tricks that any nclex prep can teach you. For example, when prioritizing which patient to see first, always acute before chronic, actual problem before risk, etc. Assess before intervening but don't need to assess twice. Airway and safety are always first, except when they're not. Always wash your hands. Memorize every lab value range cold."

I ended up later upgrading the controllers too but I kept the old ones for certain games like beatsaber. I still use my OG base stations from the vive. I would only recommend the vive pro if you want wireless, and the cosmos if you play lots of Spacey games. Supposedly the index looks better for most games, but for very dark like in space games the blacks in the cosmos win."
