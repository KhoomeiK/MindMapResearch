UCSantaBarbara,foyctwp,t3_ga4h8l,1588170164.0,"One night of junior year, I was feeling sad so I went down to the beach to sit on the sand. As I looked at the horizon, I turned to my right to see a...""weird"" is the best way to show my feelings, black dog with very tiny white eyes. It was resting on the sand, body neatly pointed towards the water with its head looking at me. When I got up to go see it, it was dead. Lying on its side, as if it hadn't moved for hours. There were seaweed flies and some blood near it. I was so mortified that I slowly went to the stairs and quickly ran back to my house. In the morning, I woke up and looked to see the dog, and everything was fine. I knew it was crazy and that I just dreamed it. I go to the living room to make breakfast, and my roommates asked me if I was drunk last night. ""Why?"" ""Because you ran home looking all weird and kept looking at the beach from your window."" 
I know what I saw."

Any proof of these slurs being used? Or a curious glitch where you can't show the recording? Proof without some bs excuse paragraph like usual would be appreciated."

ucla,fn4rdeo,t3_fzjtqt,1586647317.0,"I was gonna criticize this like the other comments but after talking to tons of PhD students and hearing their stupid, ""I don't have a spine so let me just go to more school before I have to be an adult"" reasons, I can't say this is any worse"
ucla,fn4qsi2,t1_fn1fkuh,1586646970.0,"That's what everyone says though. ""IM gonna be the accountable one and make a difference, trust me IM not like the others and IM gonna help find where all this money has been going."" It's been like this since like 2005 when my friends complained. Anyone who gets that involved with student gov is gonna get brainwashed by all the stupid Gunner resume whores who use stupid taglines to get elected so they gave an extra line to add to their law school applications"
