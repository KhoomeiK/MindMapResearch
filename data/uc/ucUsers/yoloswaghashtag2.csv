berkeley,fpj5nwh,t3_gdrow6,1588657327.0,idk where i'd find a place elsewhere. It's hard to find a place to live that isn't total shit on minimum wage job. Probably would need to save some stuff up before :(
berkeley,fp1gshj,t3_gan5na,1588235016.0,"yeah, i'm in stat 134 right now. It's crazy how a pretty easy unit in AP stats becomes wtf within basically a week. Really shows you how little depth those classes had for being ""college level"" lol."
berkeley,fp0aogu,t3_gakj21,1588205634.0,345 lol. def don't think i'll get in
aves,foxs2rd,t1_fovzg51,1588154316.0,I think this took place in nepal if i remember correctly...
berkeley,fosecul,t1_foscra6,1588029059.0,what made you disappointed with 134/135? Just curious
berkeley,foevb5t,t3_g73g7i,1587716009.0,"Man, I feel bad for freshman that won't be able to experience GBO. The actual activities and the cost is a ripoff, but that one week of absolutely no obligations whatsoever crammed with other people is pretty nice."
berkeley,foe8mfe,t1_focxfzq,1587698263.0,"I'm just wondering what will be different in spring 2021. Seems like without a vaccine, we're basically in the exact same situation :("
berkeley,fo5fokk,t3_g5rl6l,1587524518.0,"I think the grading of the class is pretty awful ngl. Problem sets feel graded more on the format of your answer as opposed to what you know and theyve hidden rubrics for the problem sets so you cant understand why you got what you got. I actually did pretty good on the last midterm but one of my questions i submitted was unreadable (due to being in a rush) but i somehow got a 100% on that question? Im happy obviously, but the grading just seems nonsensical which is extremely frustrating."
freeparties,fo54aqx,t3_g5iobn,1587517198.0,"Id say the people at freeparties in the bay area tend to be on the older side (in europe the crowd seems younger), and we dont play as much freetekno. Ive heard everything from terrorcore to tropical house at a freeparty here."
freeparties,fo5449a,t1_fo48yf7,1587517090.0,"Id say we have a freeparty scene depending on where you are. (Like California), idk how big the sense of community is in Europe. But I'd say norcal definitely has a sense of community in its sphere."
berkeley,fo4h8sa,t1_fo4fp8d,1587504381.0,I mean i think it makes sense to announce it early. A lot of people need to sign leases around this time but aren't sure whats going to happen
freeparties,fo0o011,t1_fo01glp,1587416568.0,In parties in the UK or the rest of the europe?
freeparties,fnyvfum,t1_fnypu8d,1587377161.0,"Yeah, as an american feel like i definitely prefer american freeparties due to the genre diversity."
aves,fnuoohr,t3_g4004j,1587267185.0,"northern California, last rave i attended was at a warehouse that was any genre from tropical house to terrorcore."
berkeley,fnqrpq9,t1_fnqqfe9,1587170768.0,Whered you see the median?
berkeley,fnqrlmd,t3_g3c8e0,1587170695.0,127/150
berkeley,fnfk0he,t3_g1ffys,1586909556.0,Econ 2 is graded very weirdly imo. Idk about econ 1 but feels like in econ 2 that youre graded based off your answering fitting a specific format as opposed to what you know.
teenagers,fmdwitp,t3_fuoggg,1585980284.0,i mean ketamine is used for therapy lul
