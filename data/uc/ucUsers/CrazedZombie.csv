1. Sera Safaryan (advocate for victims in March 1 case) and her family were beaten a few days ago.  
2. The fight today between Alen and Artur today  
3. Armen Sarkissian sending the confiscation of property obtained with illegal money bill to the constitutional court instead of signing it (Still confused by this, if anyone has info on why he chose to do this please comment)  
4. The disputes with Russia over gas prices and the related anti-Pashinyan protests by people being cut off   
5. The Gavar incident today  
6. The shady stuff with ucom going on  
  
Overall, there’s a lot of different things going on right now and it’s very troubling to me. Many of these seem like possible provocations, and Pashinyan has been pretty silent in dealing with these. Maybe I’m misunderstanding some of these issues, if so please say so. But there’s plenty of reason for HHK and affiliates to rock the boat right now, considering the recent arrests, the ongoing 4 day war investigation, and most important of all, the property confiscation bill. And the coronavirus crisis offers a good opportunity for them to do so."

This is one of my least favorite buildings in Yerevan, because it just makes me sad that they took a perfectly good old building and wasted the facade on this abomination. I feel like the building behind it clashes with this facade.   
  
This is the worst example of this trend IMO, there are much better examples elsewhere in Yerevan. As OP said, the Ameriabank headquarters have a pretty good use of facadism. My personal favorite is the AGBU building on Melik Adamyan street, the rest of the building behind the facade is just glass, so IMO it doesn't clash with the facade in any way.    
  
Anyway, I'm not a fan of facadism either, we barely have any old buildings left as it is, so these should be left alone and restored properly. But if they do incorporate these buildings into new constructions, they should at least follow in the footsteps of the other two examples I mentioned."

Russian troops were on both sides at different times, for example the same Russian units which helped Azerbaijan launch the Goranboy offensive later helped Armenian forces stop that same offensive.

HumansAreMetal,fove2sy,t1_fouqooe,1588099769.0,"Well no, the evidence is very clear on it, there is a strong academic consensus by almost all scholars and the very word genocide was created based on the Armenian Genocide. What you are claiming about these killings being against the wishes of the empire is **completely false**, as there are various documents proving that the orders to deport and exterminate Armenians came from the very 3 Pasha’s ruling the empire. This was in no way a civil conflict between Turks - the Ottoman Leadership and military conducted a planned and determined effort to wipe out Armenian presence within the Ottoman Empire, using these claims of “Armenian betrayal” as an excuse. It’s shameful that these throughly debunked excuses have survived to the modern day. Those “generals” who were later sentenced to death were the very 3 Pasha’s leading the entire empire. The Ottoman Empire after the war finally came around to recognizing the horrible crimes against humanity it had committed against the Armenians, which is why those former leaders were put on trial and sentenced to death. But they escaped and the Turkish nationalist movement led by Atatürk took over and reversed those trials and began Turkey’s policy of denial. Instead, Armenians had to track down and assassinate each of these in what is known as “Operation Nemesis”.   
  
As someone who’s largely descended from survivors of this genocide and has as a result made sure to be well educated on it, it is incredibly sad to see genocide denial still being perpetuated based on claims which have been debunked countless times, and what more, to see it be upvoted one in a sub like this where people who know little about the matter might be swayed. There is nothing “unclear” about it . The Armenian Genocide was a genocide, no less than the Holocaust was a genocide."

Germany bans Holocaust denial and has paid *vast* sums in reparations to Jews. Because of the Holocaust, Germans are terrified of being nationalistic, because they remember what that nationalism led to. Germany has apologized for the Holocaust more than they ever could, and nobody sees Germany today as Germany in 1945. If Turkey came even close to what Germany has done in repenting for the genocide, nobody would hold the genocide against modern day Turkey.
  
The Nazis escaping to America and Argentina is a crime, they should have all been hunted down. But every one that couldn't escape faced their crimes in the Nuremberg Trials. The Ottoman Empire recognized these horrific crimes in the end as well, and began [conducting their own trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecution_of_Ottoman_war_criminals) sentencing the Pashas to death. But the Pasha's escaped, and Ataturk came to power and reversed the trials, beginning Turkey's policy of denial.  
 
I don't get what you mean by the West is bullying you. The West has treated Turkey far better than it should have, because it needed Turkey for NATO against Russia. Now that Turkey is straying away from NATO, more and more countries are finally doing the right thing and recognizing the genocide, but they should have done so long ago, and it's disgusting that Turkey was able to pressure them into not doing so for so long.   
Regarding the genocide being justified by the [Battle of Sarikamish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sarikamish), Enver Pasha completely failed handling the battle, and blamed his defeat on Armenians as an excuse.

Because that's your sole responsibly as an individual.  
  
 
And if all 80 million of you went out in the streets to protest and recognize it, the government absolutely would recognize it. Who do you think the government is? The government consists of people from those 80 million Turks. If the whole population recognizes it, then the government would be made out of people who recognizes the genocide, and thus the government would recognize it too."
armenia,fosdnwk,t1_fosaizt,1588028670.0,"This entire thread is you denying the genocide. You are saying we are lying about the facts, that we are misrepresenting reality, that is exactly what denying the genocide is. You are denying that the Ottoman Turkish government systematically ethnically cleansed and exterminated its population of close to 2 million Armenians. You are denying that this ethnic cleansing was not simply a result of a fictional two-sided conflict between Armenian militias and Muslim militias, as genocide deniers like to claim, but rather a central effort by the Turkish government led by the 3 Pashas as proven by telegrams and countless documents to destroy this ethnic group, beginning with the rounding up and eventual killing of Armenian intellectuals in Constantinople, as far removed from the war as possible. Are you denying your denial of the genocide? Because not recognizing the genocide is exactly that, denial.  
  
You absolutely can walk through Glendale. Nobody will give a shit, I guarantee you. If you start walking around downtown yelling how the genocide is a lie, people will be outraged, but I still doubt anything would happen to you. You could visit Armenia perfectly fine, you could go right to the Armenian Genocide memorial in Yerevan and people would be happy to see you there. Do you not see the irony in claiming to be the oppressed person, when Armenians are the ones who are being oppressed?      
  
I'm sure some innocent Turkish people got murdered by Bulgarians and Armenians. In fact, I know they did, because Armenians aren't perfect, there can be shitty Armenians just like there can be shitty Turks. I'm sure that some Armenian resistance groups, in the aftermath of seeing their entire families slaughtered during the genocide, conducted revenge killings. I can't even find these instances from trying to google them, but regardless whatever happened with those, they were tiny, few, and incomparable with the Armenian genocide.I know that massacres happened in both Armenian-Azerbaijani wars, but these massacres happened in completely different location and times from the Armenian genocide, and happened on both sides in a bloody ethnic conflict.  
  That's the difference, what happened in 1915-1920 in the Ottoman Empire wasn't an ethnic conflict between Turks and Armenians, but a concentrated effort to wipe out the Armenian population by the Turkish government. Almost every Armenian, myself included, can trace their family back to genocide survivors. Every Armenian has been touched by this. Of course you don't have a problem with Bulgaria and Armenia, Bulgaria and Armenia didn't try to systematically eradicate the Turkish race.  
  
Here's a question for you: Would you want to be an Armenian living in the Ottoman Empire in 1915? I would be fine with being a Turk living in the Ottoman Empire in 1915. Odds are, I'll be fine. But if you're an Armenian, you ARE going to suffer. There is no question of it. Odds are, you'll be 1 of the 1.5 million Armenians who die. And if you're one of the ""lucky"" ones who survive, you'll have witnessed your entire family, village, every person you knew be slaughtered or die of starvation around you. You'll have to walk hundreds of miles starving and suffering through the desert. Either you die, or you barely survive as a human, mentally and physically scarred. There is no rosy ending for Armenians there."
armenia,fosbigk,t1_fos904i,1588027489.0,"Regardless of if that even happened, which I'm guessing it didn't, that would be extremely sad. Obviously that would be wrong. But that's the point, people do shit that is wrong. If an Armenian does something bad, then I'm not going to deny that. I'm going to say that regardless of whether that person is Armenian or not, that is shitty. Yes, Turks in the past committed a genocide against Armenians, but that doesn't make current Turkish people responsible for the genocide. But by refusing to recognize it, then it makes you guilty of denying that genocide.   

We aren't blaming you for what happened 100 years ago, we're blaming you for not *recognizing* what happened 100 years ago. Do you not see how ridiculous what you're saying is? We are mad at your for not recognizing the genocide, and you point towards that anger and say why does it matter that we don't recognize the genocide when they are MAD at us! How dare they? It's the same thing as African Americans in the United States struggling for civil rights. For hundreds of years, African Americans were enslaved, oppressed, and endured racism at the hands of white Americans. Yet when African-Americans struggled for rights, and were angry at white Americans for denying those rights, those white Americans would be shocked and say how can they be mad and racist towards us like this? Who the fuck cares that black people were angry at white people, when that anger is completely justified and necessary?
  
Who cares about the small handful of schools which are *so kindly* allowed to operate when there were **thousands** of Armenian schools, churches, etc 100 years ago. A vast, enormous, ancient presence all across the land of modern-day Turkey that has been completely wiped out save for a few meager institutions, and somehow we should be happy that we still have those few?"
armenia,fos9yje,t1_fos8mgj,1588026656.0,"I don't really get what you're trying to say. Regarding politics, do you mean Armenians only care about getting money and land from genocide recognition? Because Armenia as a country has never made demands for reparations, only recognition. But if Turkey came to a state where it truly recognized and apologized for the genocide, then I'd think Turkey would willingly give reparations.  
  
I'm not really sure what you're trying to say about stealing lands and the Greeks. It sounds like you're saying that why should we care about what the borders were 100 years ago? I mean, you're kinda right. It sucks that Armenia lost our historic lands, every Armenian wishes that Western Armenia still existed. But there's no point in getting those lands back today when millions of Turks and Kurds live there now. The  best-case scenario of my dreams would be for Turkey to recognize the genocide, work with Armenian authorities to preserve and reverse the damage done to whatever is left of the thousand Armenian cultural monuments in Western Armenia, and give us our holy mountain Ararat since the population living there is small anyway. But even that would never happen."

Real population was somewhere close to 2 million Armenians. Assuming some several hundred thousand Armenians survived the genocide, as well as there being another couple million Armenians elsewhere in Russia and the rest of the world, It makes perfect sense that we have 10-12 million Armenians in the world today. Turkey has maybe 10 million Turks in 1915, now there’s 80 million in Turkey.
  
Regarding your second point, nobody says the current Turkish population is guilty of genocide. The current Turkish population is guilty of denying that the genocide ever happened, that is why we are mad. I don’t have a problem with Turks who recognize it, my best friend is Turkish. And regarding your last point about Turks sheltering Armenians, yes some Turks did shelter and save Armenians from genocide, and I’m incredibly grateful for them.

YerevanConstruction,fos3uzv,t1_fos2qkh,1588023490.0,That's great to hear. Do you know what purpose the building will serve?
YerevanConstruction,fos3o7k,t1_fos2p7v,1588023391.0,"They explain the roof in the EVNReport article, here's the quote:  
""The overall space will have a 7000 square meter glass dome. According to Levon Vardanyan, there are several reasons for this, starting from preserving the harmony of the space to solving issues that may arise from different weather conditions. These historic buildings had stone facades and arched open alleyways. These separated large public spaces from residential homes where you could find gardens and intricate wooden balconies. Since the general appearance of the city has changed to include newly built high rises around that space, the authors intend to build the dome to cut off the Old Yerevan Quarter from that view. They want to create a place where people can stroll and enjoy themselves without having to see modern high rises. Solar panels are to be installed on the sides of the glass dome to provide 24/7 lighting for the space.""  
  
I understand their reasoning, but I feel like they couldn't be more wrong. You are worried about high rises making the old district seem in-authentic, so you are going to make a massive roof on top instead? That just makes it feel more of a ""artificial"" construction. The high-rises around it wouldn't really detract IMO, it shows that this old district really belongs in a city. It provides an important contrast. You can see the Flame Towers in Baku from the old district there, but that doesn't detract from it in any way.  
  
Nevertheless, as you said I'm sure it will be an important attraction, and I'm sure I'll visit it often and enjoy it. But it's like Northern Avenue in a sense, where everyone goes there and enjoys it, and it's better that it's there than nothing at all, but it could be so much better.

MapPorn,foo0er5,t1_fonyoim,1587930047.0,"How did I prove your point?  
And obviously there were alliances made, trained soldiers were commandeered by high ranking officials, and even artillery was present, because there was a war going on. Obviously both sides would have these elements and use them for the purpose of fighting. When these massacres, which were not pre-planned broke out, soldiers killed civilians, that’s what a massacre is. I mean, it obviously sucks that this happened. But are you seriously trying to compare these war-time massacres, only one of which was committed by Armenians, to the very carefully well-planned wholesale ethnic cleansing of all the Armenians in Western Armenia, murdering 1.5 million Armenians? This was a concentrated effort proven by countless historical accounts, telegrams, etc from the very 3 Pasha’s themselves to eliminate Armenians as an ethnicity within the Ottoman Empire."
MapPorn,fony1vx,t1_foms56g,1587928722.0,"Considering you’re the one who is denying the genocide, I would say it is you whose ignorance is insurmountable. I don’t need your Turkish-propaganda sources, as an Armenian whose ancestors were sole survivors in their families during the genocide, I’ve read plenty through plenty of actual legitimate sources. I would link you to countless number of legitimate resources detailing exactly why the genocide was a genocide, but considering they are all available with a few strokes of the keyboard and you haven’t read any of them, I doubt you’d read them now.   
But, you do realize the very word “genocide” was created based on the Armenian Genocide?  
And here is Djemal Pasha’s own grandson recognizing the Armenian Genocide. This is the grandson of one of the very three people who led the Armenian Genocide. If he of all people recognizes it, I don’t understand how other Turks can still deny it. https://twitter.com/hsncml/status/1253431507659571204?s=21"
MapPorn,fonxgkk,t1_fomsh7a,1587928388.0,"Well, no, I wouldn’t call them *systematic*, because they weren’t of an organized nature like the genocide. There were the Armenian-Tartar massacres of 1907 (mixed violence between Azeris and Armenians), the March Days (committed by Armenians and Bolsheviks), the September Days (committed by Azerbaijanis), the Khaibalikend Massacre(commited by Azeris), and the Shusha Pogrom (committed by Azeris).  
  
My point is that without going into the specifics of these massacres, this was in the midst of a conflict (where Armenia was fighting for survival as a state made of genocide refugees), and thus the violence that occurred here is incomparable to the genocide, although obviously still sad."
MapPorn,fomrsq2,t3_g8bo09,1587901572.0,"I’ve seen this map posted many times before, and as I understand, the statistics shown here are sourced from [McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_McCarthy_(American_historian)) a leading genocide denier. This map purposefully compares Muslim and Armenian casualties in a misleading manner (and from what I recall, the Muslim numbers are inflated) in order to make it seem as if Armenians simply suffered in the same manner as Muslims as a result of WW1, and that they had the same experiences. To portray it as this is to complexly downplay and deny the planned genocidal effort to eradicate Armenians in the Armenian Genocide, which is why this map bothers me to no end when it is posted. It is never posted with noble intentions."
armenia,fomp02w,t1_fomomlw,1587898515.0,"That’s what I assumed he meant. I was confused why he was saying Karapapakh’s are Armenian, as I’d never heard of them before, but apparently he’s just completely wrong and they’re an Azeri sub-ethnicity."
MapPorn,fomop8y,t1_fommqu8,1587898177.0,"Generally the Armenian population was very mixed with the Turkish, Kurdish, and Azeri (Tartar) populations back then. When the Armenian Genocide happened, some 1.5 million Armenians were killed and part of the survivors fled to the East, establishing the first Armenian Republic with similar borders to modern day Armenian as seen in this map. Thus, the proportions shifted then more towards Armenians.   
  
Then, Turkey invaded the remaining territories held in the West held by Armenians, while Azerbaijan fought Armenia in the East/South for control of Nakhichevan/Syunik/Artsakh in 1918-1921. In this war, some population exchanges happened but a large Azeri population remained in Armenia, and a large Armenian population remained in Azerbaijan.  
  
Then for the next 60 years, Armenia and Azerbaijan were part of the Soviet Union. The Armenian and Azerbaijani minorities didn’t disappear, but didn’t grow as fast as the dominant ethnicities in the respective republic. Finally, in 1988 the NK conflict began, and the Sumgait Pogroms in Baku set in motion a large scale population exchange where Armenians fled from Azerbaijan and vice versa. Most of the Azerbaijani’s in Armenia were rural, so most violence was limited in scale, while Armenians formed large minorities in the three largest Azerbaijani cities and there were serious progroms there.   
  
I got a bit carried away with my response, nonetheless my point is that while population exchanges did happen, to some extent in 1920 but largely in 1988-1992, and without going into the specifics of the war and why it happened, it’s shitty that they happened, but it’s incomparable to the actual genocide which occurred against the Armenians. It’s a common tactic for Turkish genocide deniers to claim that it’s not a genocide because by claiming massive killings of Turkish civilians happened at the hands of the Armenians, which is completely false, and by falsely portraying it as a civil war where both sides suffered and deported each others civilians. This is wrong, and downplays the truly planned and genocidal effort to wipe out Armenian identity and culture, which is different from whatever debatable conflict and population exchanges occurred in the aftermath of the genocide."

worldnews,foleqry,t1_folckxs,1587860653.0,"Let's say Wuhan and all the surrounding provinces do a thousand times worse than Taiwan, so 300 deaths per one million people (even this is too low I would say, as this is the rate for France, Italy, and the UK overall, when we should look at the rate for those countries in their worst-hit cities). 
  
Taking the metropolitan population of Wuhan, 20 million people in 2010 (likely has increased since then), 20x300 would be 6,000 deaths alone. Taking the entire province of Hubei, which Wuhan is the capital of, brings the total population we're looking at up to 58.5 million people as of 2015. 58.5x300 would be 17,550 deaths.   
  
China's official death toll is 4,632 deaths, for ALL of China. Applying this conservative death rate to Wuhan's metro area alone already puts us past that with 6k deaths. Even at my figure of 17,550 deaths, we are only looking at the province Wuhan is in (so not even counting the rest of China), and are using conservative death rates. So based on that, China's death toll seems vastly underreported.

worldnews,folbb2r,t1_foku8cs,1587858612.0,"What are you basing this on? Taiwan has 0.3 deaths per million people, China has 3 deaths per million people. So Taiwan is doing only 10x better than China's supposedly faked numbers. And this is considering that China was the very first country to experience this outbreak, had information suppressed in the beginning and thus allowed the outbreak to spread into other provinces (unlike Taiwan that took action from the very start of it's outbreak to contain the spread) and didn't have the benefit that other countries have now of knowing what COVID-19 is and how to deal with it. Taiwan is basically the shining example of how to deal with Coronavirus. I can't see China doing only 10x worse than Taiwan with all that considered."

On one hand, the concept of ASALA seems fundamentally wrong - fighting fire with fire, an eye for an eye, always seems like the wrong thing to do. It's like the African-American struggle for civil rights, where it seems like we must use non-violent methods to protest. Yet, our experience protesting for the Armenian Genocide showed that non-violent protest didn't work. Until ASALA began committing terrorist attacks, genocide recognition was going nowhere, being completely suppressed by Turkey. In a way, it's Turkey's fault that ASALA came to be. If you suppress a nation's every attempt to fight for recognition peacefully, then you leave them no choice but to turn to violence. [Here's a comment that says it better than I do](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/alhdv6/what_do_you_think_about_asala/efesbvp/). In general, I think the attacks on diplomats was incredibly sad, but the fact that genocide recognition only truly began after those attacks proved that they were necessary. But like that comment says, the attacks on civilians were truly unacceptable and ASALA lost favor with Armenians at that point."
