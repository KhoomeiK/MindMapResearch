bmpcc,fpgbbi5,t1_fpg40c6,1588599063.0,"Al parecer, a la gente que vive en Inglaterra le gusta usar estas cámaras de Blackmagic Design! Hace medio año un par de hermanos estuvieron aquí en California y me tocó ver su película (Cosmos) grabada con la BMPCC original...tambien grabada completamente en ProRes como la tuya."
bmpcc,fpftz42,t1_fpfpul5,1588583414.0,"For now, it'll be for targeted lower tier producers.  The idea is to put together a concept short that includes key scenes from my script...in hopes to maybe ""hook"" a producer that will get the ball rolling in areas I'm not versed at...the ultimate goal being $$$ for the feature film.  Maybe it'll work, maybe it won't, pero de cualquier manera debo intentar.  Parece que los métodos convencionales no abren las puertas ampliamente.  Si funciona, bien.  Si no, nada perdido...hago mi película solo y ganó un mundo de experiencia. Saludos desde California."

UCDavis,fpaxof5,t1_fpanxtd,1588457864.0,How challenging is it to make friends at Davis? My daughter will be an incoming freshman and has always had a hard time forming close bonds as she has Aspergers.
UCDavis,fp8xslj,t1_fp8wpy1,1588406768.0,"The isolation is a concern for me. She has such a challenging time making friends.  She craves close friendships, however, since she has a hard time making sense of social cues, she tends to always be the third wheel in friendships...left out of most everything."
bmpcc,fp8mj8v,t1_fp8m7zg,1588396344.0,"Yeah, I own a few OG Pockets and also a BMCC 2.5K...shit, this is such a great camera.  You think the OLR might work with the BMCC 2.5K?"
bmpcc,fp8lde8,t1_fp8l1kv,1588395404.0,What remote control for WB are you refering to? I'm very interested.
bmpcc,fp8l2h6,t3_gbx6c0,1588395164.0,"While not having a touch screen is a mild inconvenience, the menu on this little MONSTER is very practical and straight forward...play around with it a bit and you'll get used to it quick...unlike Sony menus that are insane.  Yeah, the White Balance increments have too big of a gap but when shooting in RAW (CinemaDNG), you can easily readjust it in post...just get as close as possible while shooting...and yes, there are apps...many apps.  Shutter Angle is foreign to you? I'm thinking those 12 years you speak of were as a hobbyist right? Go with 180° or 172.8° on the OG BMPCC...you know what the 180° shutter rule is right? Well, this rule is where shutter speed comes from. Run and gun with this camera is not as practical as one would want it to be...but, just grab a bunch of extra batteries and go for it. Dig into YouTube tutorials on this BEAST of a camera and you'll realize that your friends gift is even greater than you thought. Best of luck to you!"

bmpcc,fp1n2d8,t3_ganfx1,1588241240.0,"I don't know much about the lenses you mentioned.  Now, while a dedicated prime lens is always desired, I would recommend that you get the Sigma 18-35 1.8 zoom lens plus a speedbooster.  This lens is exactly what people describe it as...""a bag of primes."" With the speedbooster, it is a faster lens and cuts down on the camera sensor's crop factor. And the side bonus is...without the speedbooster (and with a simple dummy adapter) you now have a  longer zoom ...albeit not as fast.  Get it."
bmpcc,fottwiw,t3_g97au8,1588065978.0,I literally saw your video a couple days back.
davinciresolve,fottgjt,t3_g9itq7,1588065521.0,"What you did right: you got it done. (Hopefully taking social distancing into consideration). Trust me, just starting a project and getting it done is a mission for most.  I procrastinate too much and place excuses often that keep me from getting shit done.  So...fuck yeah, starting and finishing something is awesome! Also, the brief jump cuts at around 2:12 worked well.  Also the inclusion of lyrics trough text was good...just be selective with when you place them...ask yourself: what makes those specific lyrics worthy to be written on screen over all other lyrics?  

What you did wrong: your video was way too static...the lack of movement made it bland quick...real quick. The jump cuts I mentioned above helped with movement...just no enough of this was in the video...however, that you used them tells me that you have good ideas...so keep at it. The lake b-roll just didn't feel liken it fit in. Simply having your talent walk (again...emphasis on motion vs static shots) along the shore or with the lake in the background as an establishing shot could justify why your b-roll is what it is. Habe your talent move around...walk! Also...take different shots...maybe some closeups of his mouth when he says important/meaningful parts of the song. Closeups of his hand gestures, his hat, his shoes. Just make more happen...especially with such an upbeat song...oh yeah, if your talent is not synced with the audio, cut to sone b-roll.  There were also lots of technical problems relating to getting to know your camera.  Overall, I have to be blunt so that there is value in my wanting you to get better (I sure need to also), so...it was not very watchable. But like I said earlier, you got it done and you should only get better from here. Keep at it and keep getting things done...that's a step ahead of many people I know who only get things done if the conditions align (that's often me). My best to you!"

Yes, it has several drawbacks, but trust me, it will absolutely teach your sister a world of things if she puts it to work. Check out the 2019 film COSMOS https://youtu.be/b95XIREFJwo it was filmed by a few British lads entirely witg this camera.  By the way, you can afford it with your budget as these usually go for about $350 US which leaves room to purchase a cage, a lens, memory, and a good external battery...all within your 600 € budget."
