ironscape,fpb4tvl,t1_fpb1pia,1588462131.0,"Temple trekking gets you about 3k/hour just by spamming easy treks and running from every encounter. You can also safespot banshees in the catacombs of kourend. The ess/hour depends on your range and setup, but I was getting about 800 essence/hour + good ranged exp with a basic RCB/black d'hide setup. 

The Ardy diary gives you some per day. After getting the medium diary, include running to the wizard in NE Ardy during the first herb run of the day for 100 essence in less than a minute.

When you start getting towards higher slayer, you'll get more and start stockpiling them. Wyrms and gargs give you a bunch."

He did a poll a few months back about doing it in livestreams versus a series and the consensus from the community was to take his time doing a series instead of doing livestreams because of the exploratory nature, even though he had other series planned and it might be a wait."

ironscape,fmzmsb3,t1_fmzd1lx,1586524834.0,"Huh, I'd assumed the math would work out that the base time to find the tunnel and run through to the chest, but if I'm doing the math right then it's better to ignore them.

Numbers made up, may not be accurate, etc etc. The post about only doing 1/2 brothers mentions they did 40 runs in an hour, so each run is 1.5 minutes. Let's say that's 20 seconds to kill the brother and 1 minute 10 seconds to run through finding the tunnels and getting to the chest. You get 2 rolls at only your items, or 45 seconds per roll, each of which has a .26% chance of hitting an item. This will take you, on average, 400 rolls over 5 hours to hit. 

If you kill another 2 brothers on the way, you now get 4 rolls. Your chance of hitting any item is .362% and your chance of hitting your desired item is .12%.  This run takes no additional time to find the tunnel, because you're just killing brothers on the way. The only additional time is 40 seconds to kill the other brothers, bringing the run up to 2 minutes and 10 seconds or 32.5 seconds per roll. While you're getting ~33% more rolls per hour, your chance of a desired item is a little less than half per roll, so it's better to only do the 1 you want."
ironscape,fmy78mz,t1_fmy42yc,1586479629.0,"That post only considers two things: Killing all brothers, or killing the desired one then ignoring all others to find the tunnel. I imagine that killing the desired one, then killing other brothers until you find the tunnel, then immediately finishing it + killing the one that spawns on the chest would be fastest in the long term? Basically don't go out of your way to kill extra brothers, but you kill the ones in front of you."
