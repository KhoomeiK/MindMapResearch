and some of the jobs pay less than working at a grocery store or fast food chain. seriously some positions were just $12 an hour. wtf? :( we went to college just for $12/ hour?? kinda wish some of the jobs actually required a bachelor's degree, a lot of times there are jobs like social media intern (unpaid) or random office stuff or after school kid sitter. idk i just feel like anyone could do that without a degree. and some more academic research jobs would be great. i find those more often on social media than on handshake."

UCSD,fpl0y11,t3_gdwnny,1588704443.0,"what do you do? what else are you doing all week that you forget about your assignments? or are you working on other assignments that you forget about others? you have to be honest with yourself, are you actually forgetting that you have an assignment due or are you forgetting to work on the assignment because you are procrastinating/ trying to subconsciously avoid doing it? if you straight up have memory loss i have no way of helping you and you should probably see a doctor cuz i think thats a symptom for depression or at least something very serious. but if you do have some conscious memory of having an assignment and are simply procrastinating here is some advice:

if it's because youre on social media i suggest you just log out of your accounts and erase the history cache. that way you will have to log back in and have to type in the user name/password each time. increasing the cost of accessing something that typically is so instantaneous/free should help a bit. then look at your calendar and start working **right now** on your next assignment. make a list of what you have to do in the week, write down which lectures you have to watch and which assignments you have to do in the order in which theyre due to happen. then just work your way through that list and cross off each item, use strikethrough. every time you finish watching a lecture or finish an assignment tell yourself ""great job! you did it! i can do this, see it wasnt so bad"" and then keep going on the next item. you can have this list on word or on a physical piece of paper but somewhere where you can easily see it. once the week is over and youve finished everything you can do the same the following week. if you have a larger project that isnt due until like 2 weeks you can still include it in your current week..like ""get started on x paper"" ""write first two paragraphs for this"" ""write bibliography"" that way you can plan it into your list of things to do even if the full paper isnt due until the following week"

UCSD,fpidpw9,t3_gdkhgj,1588638793.0,"aren't you literally invalidating people's experiences in the OP? youre saying lets not do that, but then you say ""just take what you hear with a grain of salt, everyone's experience is different! people believe their own experience is the sole reputation!"" i feel like youre trying to silence people who have had bad experiences at this school by saying that their opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. it's fine if you've had good experiences but a lot of people with good experiences tend to pounce on people who dare to say they've had a bad experience. it's ok for those to have had a bad experience, and it should be ok to speak about it. trying to tell people ""well that's just one person's opinion don't believe it entirely!!"" is an attempt to silence those opinions. youre right, people do have different experiences, both good and bad, but this post is literally doing what it purports to not do.

&#x200B;

i get that people dont want to think that some students might be racist, perhaps because youre against racism or youve never experienced it and you think your experience is the sole experience. that's fine. but the only way to fix things is to address that there is a problem, not just attack people for saying that they've faced a problem. everytime someone makes a post about a bad experience at ucsd there are so many people trying to silence them and saying ""well we ARE social! it's not socially dead!"" ect. ect. so i agree we should stop invalidating people's experiences with subtle jabs like this. many people have good experiences, some have bad experiences, no need to try to shut the other up when that happens."
UCSD,fphn88o,t3_gd6j8l,1588624261.0,"definitely try to stick to the 20 series. im not sure if your cc will let you switch to P/NP, but perhaps you could ask them (and ask ucsd) if you could take it for P/NP. in the long run i really dont think taking one lower division math class as P/NP should hurt your chances, especially since you mentioned being decent/good at math in the other replies and you will undoubtedly take many more important/difficult/relevant math and econ courses once youre at UCSD. at the moment ucsd is allowing students to take some major courses for P/NP this quarter, usually they require letter grades. but this depends on the department. but you have to ask and make sure if this applies to transfer students who are currently at cc as well. 

if you do end up dropping, perhaps you could take 20c over the summer at ucsd or at your cc whichever is cheaper. 

though honestly, even if you do get a C- in the course, that wont affect your gpa at ucsd, which is what grad schools will be looking at. and as i said above, one lower division math course really isnt going to make or break anything lol. spring 2020 will probably have an asterisk next to it for employers/school admissions for a very long time given the massive switch to online teaching and the whole global pandemic thing, they know everyone is going through shit rn. you've already been admitted to ucsd so i really dont see them resigning their admission offer over something like that (though make sure to ask ucsd about it). i really dont think your cc gpa at this moment will have any negative effects on you. you're already in and you'll get a fresh slate at ucsd."

UCSD,fpe7r95,t1_fpe5voi,1588542046.0,"does brown mean asian or latino? cuz there is a big difference, there are tons of brown asians at this school, but not as many latinos. and yes this echoes what i said, that people are naturally nicer to those of the same culture as them. it's in the first paragraph. but the issue is that there are no latino/black/native TAs or professors. so we dont get that 'extra' nice mentorship treatment that other TAs/professor might unconsciously give to people who are similar to them.

UCSD,fpe5tqf,t3_gcn063,1588540940.0,"well to play devil's advocate as you asked, the school is rich. it's the number one employer in the state of california (i think, dont cite me on this). they have the very best lawyers. the state knows how important they are for employing so many people, for helping california's economy, and especially right now with covid they are important actors. i dont know who is starting this class action lawsuit, but if they are just some individual who decided to do this there is just no way they are going to win against the monolith that is UC. sure, logically it makes sense that we shouldnt be charged for services we arent using but no one is going to have better lawyers and insight than UC. and i doubt the state would like it for all the UC schools to give refunds but then have to deal with the unemployment costs of letting go all those workers that were still being held on, or of then becoming bankrupt and requesting more money from the state. not to mention the university system isn't some inherently evil entity. it's not like that old lady suing mcdonalds. and we're a public university, not a private one. they produce a lot of beneficial research, their labs and hospitals ect. yes as undergrads we get the short stick and we find them evil but in the large scope of things they are producing a lot of societal goods by educating so many of us and by producing new research and medicine and health services. one of the reasons UCSD was ranked #1 university in those washinton rankings were because it produces a lot of societal good, it has a lot of first gen students from california, ect. it does give financial aid to those who need it even if it's a bit minimal. and yes it spends a lot on the dean salaries but an argument for that is that it's necessary to pay them a lot to get them to stay, to attract the best talent, cuz otherwise they could just go to work for a private school or in the private sector where they would be paying way more. 

and look at all of those online rec videos, that counts as ""something"" even though we obviously dont consider it as valid replacement. but all those podcasts you see being released now are in part due to that. they want to establish that they are still producing something , students are still 'paying' for 'something' even if it's just some shitty newsletter podcast video thing."
UCSD,fpe4wdn,t3_gcmpja,1588540405.0,"i think for now you should focus on getting any job you can, even if it's not on handshake or linked in, so even working at costco (they're hiring!) or other grocery stores or fast food places, just to have something. then sharing a bedroom with someone temporarily, might cost about $600. just do that for the month of june/july so that you have some safety to look for a better job after graduating."
UCSD,fpdugck,t1_fpd0q9e,1588534466.0,"when clubs are primarily all asian or primarily all white, how are we expected to join? it feels 10x more uncomfortable because you realize theyre all friends because theyre of the same race and you will never be allowed to actually be their friend. sorry it might be easy to tell an asian or white kid to join clubs to find friends but that isn't the same for latino and black students who will just further see more racial grouping in those clubs."
UCSD,fpdu4ne,t1_fpbm19m,1588534275.0,"something i always noticed here is that TAs/professors tend to be a lot nicer to people who are like them. so whether that's having an international chinese TA with international students, or an indian TA with indian students, or a white male professor being nice to white male students. i get it. you want to mentor people like you, it's only natural, you went through those same things, you know the struggles they might go through, they come from your same culture. 

but i hope people understand that black and latino and native students dont have this. there are no mexican or black TAs or professor that will be kind to us and mentor us. we are left out from those informal methods of care. and as nice as some white/asian professor/TAs might be, they know they're not /one of us/ and will always hold us at arms length because they might be afraid of being insensitive or problematic or just feel uncomfortable with someone /different/. they will always be kinder and more comfortable with those from the same group as them, always see a bit of themselves there, want to help them out more.

and of course the same goes for the general social experience here. look around and everyone is grouped together by race. if youre not white or asian you basically will rarely have a friend group where you completely belong and fit in.. the groups are usually all asian or all white or a slight mix of both but you dont really see latinos or black students welcome. 

if youre not white or asian at this school, it is just straight up a different experience and you get left out from a lot of social interactions, both among professors/TAs and with your fellow peers."

UCSD,fpa8i35,t3_gcaa40,1588442958.0,"personally i prefer summer session over regular quarter/semester lengths. class would have been done by now if this spring quarter were just a 5 week summer session class. 

and i did not find it harder at all. if anything it's easier because everything is compact, you don't have time to forget about material like you might do in a regular quarter. my full quarter classes have been a lot more difficult than anything ive done over summer. i took 12 units in one summer session and it was really doable. also most professors understand it's shorter so they may assign a bit less, though some still assign the same amount as in a full quarter. 

but since it's gonna be online this year i think it might be a very different experience. part of what made summer session nice was the chill vibes and super small class sizes. personally i have been struggling this quarter because it's online so i imagine that that struggle will carry over to online summer."

UCSD,fp0hnnp,t1_fp0afpk,1588209462.0,"oh boy lol. honestly it was hard from a quality perspective. in community college, your classes are fairly small, 20-30 students. but at ucsd most classes are huge lecture halls with around 200 students. and it's a lot harder to visit professors at office hours because a lot of the buildings and offices are so spread out, you might have to walk a mile just to go from the lecture hall to the professor's office. and office hours might not always be at a convenient time, so if you're walking from another class or something it just gets confusing. it's a small thing but it's something that took me forever to adjust to because my community college was so compact and the offices and classrooms were in the same building. it wasn't until my final year that i actually started attending office hours at ucsd. but back in community college i would go fairly often because everything was so accessible.

another thing is feedback. because classes are so big at ucsd, your work is usually graded by several TAs. and the quarter moves so fast that by the time professors or TAs finish grading something, it might be too late to really do much about it or to drop a course if you got a bad grade. 

plus it's so impersonal. most professors are really distant with students. they are just really busy with research, and if they're younger, they might be more focused on trying to get tenure above all else, so taking on additional responsibilities to get promoted. it usually means they rarely have time for much else. this took a lot of time to adjust to because at community college professors don't really do research on campus. they're there to teach, that's their main priority. so you can actually have time to sit down with them and talk about stuff for a while, and they usually seem to care a lot more about whether students are learning or not. at ucsd it was impossible to ever get into a real conversation with anyone because they were just always so busy and had to go to their next meeting. at first it might come across as rude but you learn to not take it personally and realize they're just trying to manage their time efficiently. but still something to get used to if you're not used to having conversations cut short the moment you ask a question beyond the scope of the syllabus or homework assignment, even if it's related to the subject of the course or about academia. but I suggest you just keep attending office hours regardless of how short they might be, and try to take classes with the same professor so you can at least try to create a figment of a professional relationship. this is really important for letters of recommendations and something i wish i had done sooner at ucsd. 

beyond that, it took a lot of time to adjust to the size of ucsd. finding where classrooms are, learning about different opportunities available, ect. i would suggest you start searching for any research programs or other things you might be interested in right now. go through the department's website and just soak up everything there is. a lot of programs require you to apply when you are still a junior, so try to take advantage of that. as a transfer i didn't know about these programs until my senior year and by then it was far too late to apply and take advantage of opportunities. it's unfortunate that they don't really do enough to inform transfers of these opportunities and deadlines. try to join stuff sooner rather than later,  whether that's clubs or programs or research internships. 

another thing that took some adjusting to was the people. at my community college, there were so many people from diverse backgrounds. adults, veterans, people with families, people with real jobs, you name it. everyone was really friendly and respectful of one another, it was really easy to just make conversation with anyone. but at ucsd everyone is a lot younger and even though im around the same age as most ucsd students, i still felt like they were so young. a lot of them just seem so shy. so many people are afraid of speaking up, or they just dont have anything to really say. you try to start a conversation with someone and they might just give one or two syllable answers. it's really sad and that really brought my experience down, but after a while i just got used to it. eventually you find people who do communicate well. there is also a huge international student population, and i think they are the majority of this ""won't speak to you"" crowd, though mainly it might just be because of the language barrier.

to summarise:

1. start looking into academic opportunities right now so you can still apply by the deadline (stuff like honors thesis, independent study, research, joint degree programs, study abroad)

2. if there are any elective sequences you want to take, look into them now. some have pre-requisites that might take time to get, or if they are year-long sequences, you need to enroll in fall quarter. 

3. go to office hours. they may be more distant than in cc, but that's really the only way to get letters of rec. 

4. have fun and talk to people, if they don't talk, dont take it personally, they're just scared children, but talk to those who will be open to talking back to you. don't let some people's silence otherwise bring you down.

good luck!"

UCSD,fnx54lq,t1_fnweysh,1587331660.0,"yes. there have been some universities in other parts of the world that are confirming classes will be online for the rest of the year (so that includes fall semester/quarter). im pretty sure we wont be having any concerts or large sporting events or stuff like that this year, and university classes would certainly fall into that category with just how large lecture classes are, and with how many vector interactions there are. even if you only have relatively 'small' class sizes with 30 people, everyone has such a different schedule that they are bound to interact with the rest of campus somehow. i really dont see how they could allow it unless it's for very special circumstances or tightly controlled environments. there are phd's giving their comprehensive exams and dissertation defenses online this quarter. so even that isn't enough to warrant physical on-campus exposure."
UCSD,fnwzxiz,t1_fnugkaz,1587328760.0,what are the other options available besides industry and continuing education? i havent filed mine yet.
UCSD,fnwz7fe,t3_g3xpkk,1587328349.0,"honestly i haven't been feeling depressed. i was a bit scared at the start of the quarter, just from the situation and then thinking about how i wont really get to establish connections with profs to get letters of rec and stuff like that. and i was afraid i would become depressed.

but now that we're more into the quarter, im kind of shocked to see that im kind of at ease. i like being at home with my family, there's no stress about having to commute to class and rush in the morning to get ready or waiting to go home. and there's zero anxiety about participating in class like there usually is. whenever id speak up in class i would end up overthinking everything i said or overthinking how the professor responds to my answer, shit like ""wow they didn't acknowledge anything about my response, but they just responded more enthusiastically to that other student, they must not like me...why isnt my response ever good enough.. oh no someone else raised their hand when i did im horrible"". it's great not having to deal with all of that anymore (yes i know it's really nonsensical but that's literally how my anxiety brain works in those situations lol). i also dropped some classes and added some easy ones so i think that was also a big relief.

i never really had too many friends on campus, and sometimes seeing how many people did have friends or ppl to talk to out in public places sometimes made me compare myself to them or feel bad about not having any. i mean, this didn't happen all the time, most of the time i was completely content just walking around campus from coffee shop to coffee shop on my own to study. but i think deep down it may have been something i suppressed feeling down about. and now i never think about that stuff at all and feel like im in a good mood being at home.

also as a commuter, deciding whether to spend money to eat on campus or wait until i get home was always a big issue for me.  i love that i no longer have to make that decision every day. instead i can just make myself something to eat and eat in peace. i don't have to always think with that scarcity mentality. no longer have to hunt down for an empty table at PC or anywhere else, or worry about how cold it is outside if i want to eat somewhere else. and i can just go use the bathroom whenever i need to instead of packing up all my things each time im at the library just to do that lol.

though part of the fun was trying to go hunt for a good study spot or nice place to eat my food lol. it felt nice to just explore on my own. but overall im fortunate to say ive been in a good mood lately, especially since for a long time i had been pretty depressed when at school. i wouldn't have thought that having classes online would have this effect on me.  i guess i didn't realize just how socially anxious and stressed i was at school."

UCSD,fnbxflo,t1_fnamhzo,1586824245.0,"this. i think this picture is bad because professor and admin might see it and think, ""see it's just the student's fault for being lazy at home, theyre admitting it"" when that is absolutely not true. all of the stuff on the left side of the pic are serious detriments to learning that affect our ability to actually focus. we are receiving so much noise from multiple notifications and trying to guess which tab shit is in for every different class. that takes a mental toll on your decision making processes. so much decision fatigue and trying to remember what was in which tab to avoid clicking on it again when searching for something. and doing that for every class, every time you need to watch a lecture or look for what assignment is due. there are reasons why CEOs and other people have personal assistants.. i feel like i need one just for this quarter..."

UCSD,fn4nnph,t3_fz2hh4,1586645094.0,"im at 12 units. there are two classes where i feel like i am just barely able to stay on top of things. but then one of my classes, i havent even started watching the lectures for because i have no time.. all of my time has been spent doing the homework for the other two classes. it's insane."
UCSD,fn2j7hx,t1_fn2hrrz,1586590982.0,legit ive held my pee in so often now because it feels like im gonna keep falling behind wasting time to go to the bathroom lmao. it's ridiculous. why are they working us so hard? literally have been doing nothing but homework all day i dont understand where all the time is going.
UCSD,fn2j3z8,t3_fyvuh2,1586590881.0,i agree. im honestly amazed that im only enrolled in 12 units right now because it feels like a lot more. this is much more work than ive ever had on campus and i once took 6 classes at once. it's almost 1am but i have been up all day trying to watch lecture videos and do homework assignments and i still feel incredibly behind. i just don't understand it. and ive literally been doing nothing but my homework all day. i don't even have time to make myself something to eat. i don't want to waste precious time on cooking and eating for an hour when i have deadlines due. wish professors would give us a fucking break
UCSD,fn0whne,t1_fn0isiq,1586550110.0,"no, there is also patient confidentiality that has to be maintained. there's a reason for this. what if you were the one was sick, would you want everyone to know you have it, so they can start staring at you and 'othering' you and blaming you for 'putting us at risk' and all the other stuff that comes with people shaming people who get sick? that is why we have a lockdown, why everyone is being told to wear masks, because if everyone takes these precautions it will help. don't just wait until you know someone is infected to start implementing safety measures. if you're already doing them you have nothing to worry about. and normalizing quarantine and normalizing wearing masks helps those who are infected so that they dont have to be stigmatized as well for doing that."
UCSD,fn0vskv,t3_fydo0c,1586549714.0,"i agree i feel like they are ""othering"" people who are infected. khosla even sent an email about this saying how anyone can get sick and we should be compassionate to everyone. it is not a moral failing if one gets sick. and if you and them are quarantined for two weeks you should have nothing to worry about. the guy in the article that is trying to sue the school for damages when it was /his/ decision to suddenly move out to the other side of the country is ridiculous. the university didn't force him to leave. he could have just stayed. that's his fault for being so scared. he mentioned having children but everyone should be in quarantine anyways so i really dont get what the ""Extra"" danger was. especially since infected people are also in quarantine."
UCSD,fmxfif1,t1_fmwt26q,1586464027.0,"i think this would be a good idea moving forward, but i think it's also a lot of effort for professors to do both at the same time. like i can see them doing online versions of courses, but not have the same class be online and in person at once. because lets say you just podcast the on-campus lectures like normal, and the assignments are turned in online anyways. but then how do you grade stuff like participation or discussion? doing that in person is fairly easy. but then professors would have to go through all the work of devising ways of measuring that online like how they're doing this quarter with extra assignments or webinar discussions and all of these extra things. it's like having some people on one grading scale and others on another. and it wouldnt be fair for those who go to classes on-campus to have to also do the extra work that is assigned to the online people. 

(btw i think all classes should be podcasted, but having an /online/ section of the course within the same course is just a lot of work. and im talking about those who will not be in san diego and thus never come to class at all. at least back before this online quarter happened, courses that were podcasted were done so as just an additional courtesy or help, but students were still required to come to class for midterms/finals/labs/discussions ect. that's the difference im referring to. how will you grade the online-onlys on that? it will be a lot harder to do so fairly."
UCSD,fmxeygu,t1_fmwsc4v,1586463734.0,"but i think the lease thing will be affecting everyone. most of the ppl in UTC are ucsd students. the people giving the lease know the situation. it's not like there are other people replacing those student leases on the original time frame, so i think they will still be able to get a lease or rent out a bedroom or something"
