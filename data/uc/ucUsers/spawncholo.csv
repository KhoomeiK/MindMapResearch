vipkid,fpgk6cm,t1_fpgcr50,1588604306.0,"Yeah don’t trip then, if it’s more than a month old it won’t affect your rating. Same thing happened to me like 2 days ago and my frenzy went unaffected."
vipkid,fpg7634,t1_fpg6k7z,1588596126.0,Did they change policy then? I tried when I first started out and they told me they would never alter 4 star reviews.

vipkid,foukmce,t3_g9o54p,1588085789.0,"You may end up with a bad review but despite what other people say, it’s not worth freaking out about. It may affect bookings for a bit but when I got one, that wasn’t the case. 

VIPKid should pay you in full as long as you started and ended the class on time! Someone else will correct me if I’m wrong, no doubt. 

Just don’t sweat it. Try and get through all the slides as best you can. Skip a couple when you can’t, or finish a few of them halfway if you’re worried about timing.  Try to learn from your mistakes and the improvements will show themselves in your future classes."

PublicFreakout,fmsgftf,t1_fms571u,1586354950.0,"The weed isn’t the excuse. The psychosis is. It just so happens that psychosis is commonly triggered by marijuana use. 

Psychosis is a severe mental disorder in which thought and emotions are so impaired that contact is lost with external reality. If someone is drunk, they’ll be impaired for a few hours, sober up, and probably remember what happened to some degree. High on marijuana, same thing (maybe with a bit more memory loss). When someone is psychotic, that’s not the case. They’ll get worse if you leave them to “sober up,” a process which can take months depending on the severity of the episode. The behavior of someone in a state of full blown psychosis isn’t at all comparable to someone who’s stoned. They’ve dissociated completely. They’re experiencing a different reality than the rest of us, and putting them in a drunk tank or something similar could- and probably would- put everyone else in serious danger. 

You’re right that marijuana and alcohol should both have comparable consequences when used irresponsibly. But psychosis can actually also occur in people who don’t drink or smoke regularly or to excess, causing episodes like this. It’s just not as simple as punishing someone for making a bad decision when intoxicated. I’m not defending this guy at all, don’t get me wrong. But it’s definitely not as black and white as something like driving under the influence."
memes,fl3ukex,t3_fmd0nh,1584798694.0,It’s an even happier ending than it looks. Guinea pigs can get so lonely they sometimes die if they don’t have another guinea pig around. Now he has a buddy!
