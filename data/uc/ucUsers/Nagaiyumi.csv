I came to US like a decade ago and never got the chance to go back to china, so i dont quite fit in with the internationals, and i dont fit in that well with locals, so i just stay home to a discord of some friends ive met playing games... Hmm sounds a lot sadder when i put it this way..."

At the moment we are looking to start streaming or creating content as well, as we have a lot of really funny moments that we thought would get a few laughs from other people. What would be your suggestion on starting, and how would you recommend us discovering a style of videos that are original? Since most of our ideas at the moment either don't make sense or would essentially be copying your format which we really don't feel comfortable doing since, well, you've made it and perfected it already."

Is there any benefit to be in the area? 
Will professors be available for OH and what about the cse basement?
If i have lab, should I stay around?"
