I kindly corrected him and he got all pissed for ""disrespecting his authority"". I basically had to climb the ladder until I reached the head of the chemistry department until they finally graded it. Unfortunately that didnt go well with my TA and he gave me shit for the rest of the quarter ;1"

pokemon,folutuq,t3_g7x4h1,1587871006.0,"It's a cool idea, but unfortunately under Game Freaks current trend of shoddy remakes I wouldn't bet on it. I'd love to see more focus in the games on map and dungeon design that innovates beyond the originals. With FR/LG they added the sevii islands which had cool puzzles, a ton of new features like the two pokemon day care, and unique atmosphere that hinted at a deeper story. Remember island 7 where you undergo this huge journey down a cliff and trainer covered island hunting for a larvitar, to find these ruins filled with Unknown? Sure they didn't do anything with it, but the mystery it invokes allows for you to make up your own stories about the history of the place."
