Everything else, you would have basically 3 semesters to finish up, which is really cramming things and you’d have to spend semester(s) taking 3 or even 4 technicals at a time.  (Which is not that big of a deal as long as all the technicals are not high workload).

Also, the 2019 acceptance rate for transfers was a ridiculous 5% for L&S CS which makes no sense considering that EECS was 9%."

Probably 10% of the words that comes out of my mouth is a swear word or urban slang word when I talk to my kid, in a normal way of talking, which is weird.  (I hope as a uGSI he is not doing the same).  Accents sometimes too.  I do somehow manage to talk with a Singaporean accent to my Malaysian and Singapore friends at times.  Sometimes even do the Brooklyn accent with a couple of people."

berkeley,fplwys6,t1_fplt05u,1588721075.0,"If you are in L&S, the main ones that are useable are your AP Calc and AP English credits. A 5 in Calc BC gets you out of Math 1A/1B, if you need those classes.  A 5 in English Lit gets you out of both of your R&C classes.  Other ones are major specific - for example a 4+ in both AP MacroEcon and AP MicroEcon would get you out of Econ 1/2 if you are an Econ major.  

Beyond this, the AP credits are only good for unit credit, which may help you graduate early with enough of the credits.  But more likely than not, you’ll end up with AP credits that you’ll never use.  My kid came in with 41 AP and 45 dual enrollment/CC credits and he’ll wind up graduating as a double major in 3 years with around 175 credits, even though he did get a 5 in Calc BC and Lit.  He could easy go for a 4th year and go for 200+ credits.  The DE/CC credits are actually a lot more useful since they can be used for breadths."

It’s a similar concept to EECS 126, where the class is incredibly difficult, but since the majority of the students have done competitive math, it’s probably easier for a lot of them.

You can make changes to the housing app after May 2. 
Historically Housing starts processing the applications in mid-May, so don’t wait too long to make changes.

As far as adding a roommate, a lot of people go random, and generally there’s nothing wrong with that.  If you’re choosing based on suggested roommates it’s pretty much the same thing.  You may want to join the class of 2024 FB page and look there, you might get better “matches”."

Advantages:  small class sizes, much better hand-holding for advising, you see the same people in every class so maybe a chance to make a core group of friends (not sure if this is really an advantage or not)

Disadvantages: limited class choice selection (some breadths, some English R&C, some Math), off campus, extra $2K of tuition

You should do a search on this subreddit and look at the many threads on this if you are more interested. It’s only for the first semester of your Berkeley life."

berkeley,fp6pdyy,t3_gbmipw,1588356293.0,Assist.org has been messed up in this regard for the last 3 years.  You have to go back to 2016-2017 for a given CC before the radio button choice to look at eligible breadths for Berkeley can be enabled and seen.  There are many more CC classes that do NOT articulate to a Berkeley class that is eligible as a breadth.  I’m not sure if the registrar has a more current set of classes for a given CC that qualifies as a breadth.
