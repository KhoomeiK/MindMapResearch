NewToEMS,fnrkg0j,t3_g3emqq,1587191800.0,"Use quizlet or Brady Lab if your class uses it.  Quizlet has practice questions on every chapter.  ABCs, patient care assessment (trauma/non trauma), common drugs and their doses, scope of practice - you need to internalize it.  If it helps, link up with someone in your class and study over zoom to keep yourself accountable.  Discussion alone can help you retain about 50% of the material. Practice questions, 75%; teaching, 90%

EMT school is difficult, and learning how to study effectively is one of the biggest challenges to face if you want to advance in life.  Only 19/40 people made it to the final/psychomotor exams in my class. Of those 19, only 15 passed the course.  

Best of luck!"

Tufts,fnkcgkb,t1_fni8m3b,1587021967.0,">The only upside of going to Tufts for pre-med is their early assurance, which is selective and not guaranteed entry.

Can confirm: dropped out of early assurance because I got B's in Orgo I/II :("
Tufts,fnkc3ka,t1_fnivxco,1587021609.0,">Tufts is likely to give you access to peers and a curriculum that is much less oriented around skill building and much more oriented around deep thinking.

I strongly agree with this.  I'm a grad student at a large research-oriented state school now and the undergrads I TA for do not engage with the material in the same way Tufts students do."

Tufts,fnifzlp,t3_g1r09t,1586979346.0,"If it‚Äôs between NEU w/ scholarship and Tufts, I would go with NEU.  On the one hand, one real advantage at Tufts as a pre-med is the early admit program, entry for which is hard and staying in even harder since grades have to stay very high.   On the other hand, I‚Äôve heard from friends that NEU‚Äôs co-op program is fantastic. Research opportunities at both schools are plentiful.  NEU‚Äôs  proximity to the city is also awesome since you take a straight shot from the green line to most hospitals.  

In sum, it is your performance during undergrad that matters, not where you went (unless it‚Äôs DeVry, but I digress).  You‚Äôre already an intelligent person with time to grow, so for 23k more per year, Tufts isn‚Äôt going to give you a leg up on Med School.  Best of luck in your decision making process."
prephysicianassistant,fnicaaa,t3_g1wv85,1586977569.0,"Your descriptive metaphor comparing the creation of a cohesive PA cohort to a mosaic is not only phenomenal, but also understandable for a layman like me.  I can see why you are a strong writer!

1) This might be kind of personal, but how was your mental health throughout college, and how did you manage it while doing so well in school?  The reason I ask is when I first went to college I fell into a cycle of deep depression that resulted in me getting D‚Äôs in all core sciences. Five years later I‚Äôm back in school at a UC and still battling for my science GPA (up from 2.3 to 3.1), but there are times when I still feel depressed and I lose focus in school, hence the B I got in Chem 6B last quarter.

2) Additionally, how did you show to the committee that you were ‚Äúidentifiably different‚Äù when designing your personal statement narrative?  If my first draft is crap, would you suggest having it read over by others before paying for an editing service? I think I have neither strong writing skills nor particularly unique life experiences, but I also don‚Äôt have room for error regarding stats.  

Thank you in advance - I admit I also rolled my eyes at first when I saw your numbers.  However, my perspective evolved as I read more about you :)"
