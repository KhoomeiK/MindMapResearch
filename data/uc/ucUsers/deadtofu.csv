UCI,foebfcx,t1_foeb0ml,1587699907.0,Yep!
UCI,fnn2i3p,t3_g2nnp4,1587083017.0,"Y’all are so goddamn pathetic to have blocked even me. Blocking people that are calling y’all out on your shit isn’t gonna prevent you guys from being downvoted into oblivion. Stick to The_Donald if you’d like your posts and comments to get upvoted. Otherwise, suck it up. It’s not some coordinated attempt to silence you. The majority of the people on this subreddit, like myself aren’t politically motivated with vitriol against the conservatives on campus, or throwaway accounts. We just don’t want to deal with your dirty politics."
UCI,fngailk,t1_fngag5a,1586926511.0,"No, I don’t. Someone posted screenshots of the email they sent a couple weeks back about the funding that was going towards the engineering school."
UCI,fng9wad,t3_g1jz3a,1586926022.0,genuinely wondering. why are they so horrible at formatting emails??? this and the last email they sent were visual clusterfucks.
UCI,fng9qtf,t3_g1km32,1586925906.0,welcome to UCI new anteater! I’m so sorry this is the chaos you’re having to witness as you do more research about our campus. but hopefully the outcome of this week’s election can ensure that your incoming freshman class has elected officials that will be better representatives for all of us in 2020!
UCI,fnfq6pl,t1_fnfmkgj,1586913165.0,genuine question. can you prove this?
