tennis,fnax9df,t3_fzqgns,1586805438.0,"Nakashima keeps going to the weird off-balance buggy-whip forehand, but it doesn't have enough spin or depth to really bother Pospisil, and because he's buggy-whipping instead of hitting flat, it doesn't have enough pace to bother Popsicle either. 

I think he should take a page from Novak's book and (1) stay balanced and planted on the baseline and perhaps hug it a little more, instead of falling backwards on half his forehands and (2) try to hit flatter through the ball to get some more pace and depth on it.

That being said, he's also only 18 and is 218 in the world, so I'm sure he'll be improving a lot."
