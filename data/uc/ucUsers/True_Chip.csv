You don't have to be a genius to play the electoral college as it is, both the democrats and the republicans do this, both of them target swing states.  And even ignoring that, if you think that the republicans are incompetent at getting elected, and changing the rules to get more elected, you are pretty blind.

This is just false, different people in different states have their votes counted differently, but that doesn't mean that democrat votes count less and republican votes count more.  Texas republican votes count less than Vermont democrat votes, and Wyoming republican votes count less than democrat Californian votes.  New Hampshire swing votes count more than Ohio swing votes, although Ohio votes are more sought after.

>The truth is the electoral college is the ONLY way Republicans can win. It’s not a check mate in a game of chess - it’s Calvinball where you gerrymander the game to suit you

This is the problem with collecting news articles on a certain subject to ""use"" whenever a topic comes up, because when it comes to news, it is very easy to create different arguments and therefore headlines using the same piece of news and this is highly incentivized.  So you have these lists of headlines often times years old and biased which you use as a goto instead of actually following the news like a normal person, and so you construct these narratives which are either outdated or plain wrong.

Reddit has a big problem with this, for example when the Syrian government used chemical weapons for the first time, the UN investigated, and someone not affiliated with the investigation claimed that it was the rebels who did it, and this was covered in a very easy to send BBC article.  For years (people still send out this article) people (some people who now are against Trump, I have noticed) would spam this article every time chemical weapons came up, and you couldn't get it through their head that the information was wrong and that the real UN report came back inconclusive, but because of the headline, they were convinced.

EDIT: I went over and looked at one of these lists, and several of the articles I sampled were quite different from what their headlines argued, and quite a few were based on incomplete information which was outdated when it was written, and have since been even more dated."

Yeah, I am not digging through a subreddit filled with clickbaity headlines, if you want to send a clickbaity headline my way, you do it, I'm not going to do your research for you.

No, the current situation is like if your friend wants protection, so you publicly say you support him and send your cousin to his house to guard against any attacks.  After your friend gets lazy and stops buying weapons, you tell him to shape up or you will stop protecting him.  He begrudgingly starts buying guns, but despite the rhetoric you send another one of your cousins to his house, because the gang that has been harassing him has been posturing more.  Knowing this, your friend decides not to renovate his house to be a fortress and decided against some of the more expensive security features.

Good alliances are built up with actions, and Trumps actions like, and I cannot stress this enough **Sending soldiers to Eastern Europe** are more than enough to reassure our NATO allies from drastically restructuring their military structures and alliances, something which would be self evident if they believed the US couldn't be relied upon.

When large geopolitical shifts happen, like what you are claiming, it would be self evident, and you wouldn't need to reference a subreddit which references articles which reference clickbaity shit."

This is a bad argument considering there are US soldiers on the front line who will be in the thick of the fighting if war breaks out.  If European countries truly believed that Trump was unclear on his NATO position, then there would be a lot more rearming by European states.  NATO is much different than the treaties that Trump has left, NATO is an alliance."

Well we trust them enough to hold nuclear weapons on their territory, that has got to count for something.

>The US President has made it clear that he may not honor article 5 if the Baltic States are invaded.

>The American public has lost faith in it's institutions and is perennially paralyzed by intractable domestic division with no end in sight.

Foreign policy in Europe is not something that is effected by this considering Trumps actions as opposed to his rhetoric.  If all the most anti-NATO president ever does is increase troop presence in Eastern Europe, and advance the alliances aims, then nothing partisan can effect NATO.

>The Middle East has seen Russia step in as a stabilizing force as the US clumsily retreats.  The Middle East has seen Russia step in as a stabilizing force as the US clumsily retreats. There is no grand strategy at play in American foreign policy anymore.

AmItheAsshole,fo2bp44,t1_fo2a4t9,1587456347.0,">Like she was a native to the USA at birth because when she was born she was issues a US passport. 

This is flat out wrong, she was eligible for a US citizenship when she was born, but it was not automatic, when she immigrated to the USA, she was granted citizenship, it is literally in the law:


""The following requirements must be met for automatic citizenship:

The child must have at least one U.S. citizen parent by birth or naturalization

The child must be under 18 years of age (at the time the law took effect, the child had to be born no earlier than February 27, 1983)

The child must be living in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent

**The child must be in the US in lawful permanent resident status.**""(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Citizenship_Act_of_2000)

In essence, she was born a native German citizen who was eligible for American citizenship, and upon immigrating to the United States, she was granted citizenship, had she not moved to the United States, there would still be an option to become a US citizen, but it would be a different process, and she would not be a [natural born citizen.](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/is-your-child-a-us-citizen-if-born-abroad)  Had she turned 18, she would have lost the easy access to American citizenship.

Furthermore, there is a distinction between being native of a country and being a citizen of a country, if there wasn't, there would be literally nothing wrong with stripping people of their citizenship and deporting them on a whim, since there is no connection between people and their country other than being a subject of it's government.

She is still an immigrant, just one that has an easy path to citizenship."
AmItheAsshole,fo28vx7,t1_fo27gd0,1587453526.0,"You are the one making the case that Obama is a native of Kenya, that sounds extremely birther to me...

After independence of the colonies, people who were citizens of the UK had their citizenship changed, so upon birth, Obama would have been a citizen of the USA with eligibility for UK citizenship.  Upon the independence of Kenya, he would have been a citizen of the USA and eligible for citizenship of Kenya and British commonwealth citizenship (he would be only a US citizen, and just eligible for citizenship of Kenya, because that is how things work, if one of your parents is from another country you weren't born into, usually you don't automatically get citizenship of that country, you have to register for it, and that is true in the [United States](https://nl.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/child-family-matters/birth/) as well).  Due to how the law works in Kenya, and the fact that he did not care to claim his Kenyan citizenship, he would have lost his eligibility to gain Kenyan citizenship when he turned 23, and he would remain a sole US citizen without the opportunity to claim any other citizenship.

Given all of this, how could Obama be a native of Kenya, but then stop being native after turning 23?  Is being the native of a country so insignificant that you can just be striped of it on a whim?  What does that say about the people of color who have been striped of their citizenship and deported in the past?

Simply put, being native to a country means being born there and grew up there (an exception could be made for people who grew up mostly on military bases and embassies, and went to American schools as children, although this is iffy, and strains what it means to be from a country).  

An immigrant is someone who moves to a country to which they are not native.

A citizen is someone who is the subject of a state or country.

Technically, OP wasn't born an American citizen, but most likely a German citizen eligible for American citizenship which was later claimed."
