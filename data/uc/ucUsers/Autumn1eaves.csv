Like influenza is still a disease people are getting today, and we can use that number for how many people probably will die of influenza this year.

Having said that, the thing about predictions is that they're dependent on specifics that are usually impossible to predict. The fact that the actual number is usually in the bounds of the prediction, and that they're going in the general same direction means the prediction has value.

I've heard this same exact argument for climate denial. One study found that glaciers aren't melting as fast as predicted, the fact that they're melting at all is concerning.

> The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 66 percent of legal abortions occur within
the first eight weeks of gestation, and 92 percent are performed within the first 13 weeks. Only 1.2 percent occur at or after 21 weeks (CDC, 2013).

I’m not too worried about a fetus who 98.8% of the time, cannot feel pain.

> So, in your book, it's worse to murder an 80 year old lady than it is to murder a 5 year old? Why should a person's age matter if somebody murders them?

This is gonna be my last comment because you’re clearly not arguing in good faith. You’re strawmanning the hell out of my argument, and I’m just tired of arguing with you.

I literally said, not 3 comments back, that everyone would agree that birth is the significant difference between fetuses and humans. So it’s clear as day to anyone that I don’t think 5 year olds should be murdered, nor should 80 year olds.

I agree with the Supreme Court that if a fetus can exist outside it’s mother, then we should give it the best opportunity to do so and not kill it, but in every other case it is up to the mother to decide what to happen.

I am saying that if a small packet of cells, that cannot feel pain in 98.8% of cases, is aborted for reasons that would lead to less suffering, then it should be done. 

At that point it feels no pain, and so by ending its existence we are not adding any significant suffering to the world, and oftentimes it prevents some suffering that would occur when the child is born.

I said earlier I wouldn’t get an abortion, but now I’ve changed my mind. If I get pregnant when me and my partner weren’t trying to. I, for sure, am getting an abortion."

For example, if you’re in remedial classes, then they probably won’t come to you to take AP classes. But if you’re already in an AP class, you get a lot of people coming in to recommend you take their other AP class.

There are no minimum number of AP classes, you can graduate without taking a single one.

I would say something like 15-25% of my Highschool took AP classes depending on class size (my senior year class was 400). Usually we had, for any AP course, 1-3 classes of 25-30 students. 

It’s not like AP classes are a course series or that if you take one you take them all. For example, I wanted to take AP US History my junior year, and I signed up for the class, but no other AP courses that year. I subsequently dropped APUSH, and signed up for AP Chem instead.

> All laws are limitations on liberty, and accepted as ""just"" due to what they can protect.

In fact many laws are to guarantee liberties to people. The bill of rights for example.

As well as, many laws in fact have negative effects on their citizens but are kept in place because of other people trying to enforce their will on the majority. Like, for example, marijuana laws. It’s shown that marijuana leads to less abuse of opiates in states where marijuana is legal, it’s still illegal not because anyone considers it just, or what have you. No, it’s still illegal because big pharma, who produces opiates, want it to be illegal.

> You're trying to declare it's outright unjust to set a limitation. 

This is a strawman. My argument is that it is unjust to implement laws that will cause more harm than good. In this case, 5 years after an abortion, something like 90% of women do not regret it. It is unfortunate that we have to resort to such measures, but it ultimately leads to a better life for those women, leads to less suffering for their children, and leads to a better society in the long run. Did you know that a statistically significant drop in crime occurred around 18 years after the initial passing of Roe V Wade?

>Well then, do you oppose all laws? Or is it nuanced based upon you perception of what deserves protection?

Again strawman. I obviously don’t oppose all laws, I generally oppose laws that I think would cause more harm than good, as I said earlier.

But even still, that second part is exactly what every person in America does. Our voting patterns are almost exclusively based around what we thing needs the most help. Generalizing a bit, for Democrats that’s healthcare and for Republicans that’s immigration. 

> Even the Supreme Court ruled a right to an abortion only up until viability. Where the ""right to privacy"" (which isn't well defined at all) is balanced with the state interest in protecting the ""potential life of a fetus.”

This is correct. I want to bring up one semi-broader interpretation of this statement, but otherwise this is correct.

Now you are right that women do have the right to privacy, but while that that is balanced against the government’s interest in the “prenatal life” it also is balanced with the “women’s health.” Which implicitly includes mental health, including the stress of having to raise a child.

>The court already ruled that this outright ""right to one's body/medical decisions"" doesn't actually exist.

This is just straight up wrong. It just is.

Fact 1: The court did decide that women have the right to medical privacy.

Fact 2: The court says “this right is not absolute, and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and protecting prenatal life.”

Conclusion: Women have the right to medical privacy except in the case of endangering prenatal life.

You’re interpreting this to include every single medical decision a woman could ever possibly make.

That statement is 100% wrong, and it is an incredibly dangerous and disingenuous assertion.

Stop fucking lying.

The other congresspeople see this, and they think they’ll be next if they step out of line, which gives Mitch more control to actually do something when they step out of line, which means they’re less likely to step out of lines which gives Mitch more control....."

I'm going to speak from a personal perspective, though I wouldn't say that all of this applies to me directly.

All of this comes from a presentation and perception standpoint. When I feel masculine I feel that I'm presenting masculine and/or being perceived as masculine. Of course, this also depends on what I think presentations make a person masculine

What you're doing is equating two different ideas. The idea of gender fluidity isn't really compatible with most modern feminist ideas of gender theory.

The problem is that a lot of LGBTQ theory gets usurped by feminist theory, when it really should be its own category as they have a lot of conflicting ideas."

stevenuniverse,fp0tg75,t1_fp0sfk0,1588216537.0,">That option still might have fertility problems if he has the wrong amount of chromosomes.

>I just assumed she either made an organic copy of her gemetic code (yes gemetic is a real term; peridot used it), or she shapeshifted to have DNA as part of her physical form (AKA microscopic holograms of DNA with mass).

To me it seems incredibly unlikely that their gemetic code would be anything like what humans have, especially since DNA might be an earth-specific phenomena. Lets assume through the magic of writing that this is the case though, then it would make sense for the second part of that.

>Wouldn't altering his cell structure require altering his DNA? I mean sure she could of used chemistry to mess with his gene expression, but that probably would of just made him end up like a thalidomide baby (although that might explain his lack of a neck before the timeskip).

Not necessarily, especially since the combination between the two is organic vs inorganic matter. All it would take is some kind of nanotechnology to, for example, include a means to convert Steven's gem energy into ATP, among other cellular non-genetic modifications. As well as allowing his gem mind and human brain to work in conjunction, etc.

Even still I think we can yada yada over a lot of this because most homeworld Gems are incredibly smart compared to human standards, and as such Rose Quartz would've probably been able fix and implement those over the course of her pregnancy.

>Neither of these options would give Steven the problems that mules and hinnies have.

>Although steven’s cell structure being different in the second one might have an effect on his fertility.

>Intimidate self contradiction lel

Actually no, what I was saying was that the problems mules and hinnies have on their ability to reproduce wouldn't be the one's Steven has. That doesn't mean that he can't have other problems moreover that he doesn't have the same problems as mules and hinnies."

stevenuniverse,fp0oa86,t1_fp0bvtn,1588213342.0,"Talking about it in genetic terms though, the biggest reason mules(male donkey, female horse) and hinnies (female donkey, male horse) can’t reproduce is because their genetics don’t match up in terms of shape or size. A person’s DNA has usually 1 gene different for every thousand, as compared to another person. For miles and hinnies, the difference is more stark, one of their genes would likely be .5% larger or smaller, or would likely have a slightly different shape. This is enough to prevent pairing when creating gametes for reproduction.

The second biggest reason is chromosome count differences. Horses have 64 (32 pairs) chromosomes, and donkeys have 62 (31 pairs). This leaves hinnies and mules with 63 chromosomes (31 pairs and an extra chromosome). This extra chromosome makes it so that even if a gamete is produced, it will lack an essential chromosome a lot of the time.

So the question is how in the hell did a being with no DNA create offspring with a being with DNA? A couple things might’ve happened.

Rose created her own DNA based off of Greg’s (and possibly other’s) DNA, and used that to create artificial eggs. 

Or Rose just used Greg’s DNA to create Steven and altered his cell structure in a way to support having a gem fusion inside him, and that’s why he looks different than young Greg.

Neither of these options would give Steven the problems that mules and hinnies have. 

Although steven’s cell structure being different in the second one might have an effect on his fertility.

d2: 1.5 d4: 2.5 d6: 3.5 d8: 4.5 d10: 5.5 d12: 6.5 d20: 10.5

The reason they're all half plus .5 is because on a d6 for example, you get ((6 + 1) + (5 + 2) + (4 + 3)) / 6 which is 3*7/6 = 7/2 = 3.5

To generalize for dn, the average is: 

((n + 1) + ((n-1) + 2) + ((n-2) + 3)... n/2 times ... ((n - n/2 + 1) + n/2) /n 

Each parenthesis is equal to n+1, and there are n/2 of them, therefore.

= (n/2) * (n+1)/n

rearranging a bit...

= n/n * (n+1)/2 

= (n+1)/2 

= n/2 + .5

The last two equations are correct for odd n, but there's a different derivation for it which will give you the same result."
