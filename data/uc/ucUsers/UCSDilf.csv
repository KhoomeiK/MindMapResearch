Yes, traffic is a little easier going north in the morning, but once you’re within 10/15 minutes of downtown it all becomes the same soup."

grindr,fon7xrm,t3_g8fp49,1587914178.0,I think they all show different aspects of the same person. You’re quite handsome. My one quibble is I hate mirror pictures where the person is looking at their phone instead of the mirror. Just a thing of mine.

Moving2SanDiego,fmx0ypx,t3_fxu422,1586456517.0,"Use Waze to look at commute times. 

One reason Temecula is pricier is it’s a little closer, but also it is a little older than the places in Menifee so the lots are a little bigger. The 215 can be crowded. Also the 15/215 can be busy on the weekends too, with San Diegans driving north for PS, mountains etc and Others driving south to spend the weekend in SD."
GayRateMe,fmjl585,t3_fvogo6,1586132517.0,Good choice
