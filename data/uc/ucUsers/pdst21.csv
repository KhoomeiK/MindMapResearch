I know I shouldn't be worried since this assignment is only 5% but I'm confused as to why he approved it and said it was a good topic and then gave me a D, so now I'm worried about not meeting the TA's expectations for the next assignments"
UCSD,fpash2i,t1_fpak92s,1588454774.0,"He is very though, for the CA last week he took points off bc I exceeded the word count for like 20 words..."
UCSD,fp8knvn,t1_fp63tfc,1588394841.0,"I HATE MMW, I hate that they make like 2000 videos for us to watch and the weekly writing assignments are stupid imo (plus some of the questions are hard)"
UCSD,fp4zbs6,t1_fp4a06a,1588311496.0,I was doing 3 classes. Also idk if you know this but UCSD doesn't offer online classes regularly they are being online bc of covid. A lot of upper division classes are only once a week (3 hrs long) so maybe you can pick classes that are only once a week and you will have more time to study and work.

UCSD,fp3grlf,t1_fp1e8wa,1588279027.0,"right? okay it's bc my TA mentioned that if we watched all of the lectures we would find clues to the answer, ig he lied to us bc we wanted us to watch all of the lectures lol"
UCSD,fp3glrc,t1_fp110eq,1588278946.0,yeah I put umbrella too!

UCSD,foxckav,t3_ga339c,1588139953.0,"I worked full time during my first two years at UCSD and my grades suffered so much. I know people who work full time and do school full time but for some reason it was very difficult for me (I also commute) during this year which is my 3rd year I decided to work less hours (20) and try to focus on school and it is so much better! my grades and GPA improved so much and I feel less stressed because I would always have a mental breakdown during finals lol. I would recommend you to talk to a counselor about your situation and plan your classes. But I think with this covid situation it is something doable, since you can technically watch the lectures whenever you have time! I hope this helps :)"
UCSD,fo5rpoi,t1_fo5q2om,1587533615.0,"yeah same! some of the questions were very specific but hopefully she gives us a solution since it looks like a lot of students complained about it! 

Plus she made us read the agreement and then sign it, which was being timed as well and I didn't notice at first so I was taking my time reading that too"
UCSD,fm5ke55,t1_fm1ucfm,1585774581.0,"yeah same here, hopefully he talks about it during office hours :( 

good luck!"
