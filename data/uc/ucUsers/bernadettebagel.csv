UCSD,foidmz1,t3_g7hbsk,1587784221.0,The kitchen is really nice but WOW that single is so small. The single I had in Marshall Uppers was probably double the size. I'm sure people will like it better than having triples at least.
UCSD,fnqsb21,t3_g39jb7,1587171143.0,"During chem 7L lab there was a girl who had a station across from mine and us and a group of girls near us connected really quickly when we were organizing and cleaning all our equipment. During the 2nd lab there was a break where things were drying and the TA didnt care where we went for an hour, so my new friend and I went to 64 and got food together and realized we both wanted to get a nose piercing. We made plans that weekend to go to a tattoo place in PB to get our nose pierced together and after we got tacos. Didn't talk to her much after the class ended but the friends and memories in that class were very wholesome."

Normally: About 45 minutes before my classes, usually around 9am or 10am. If it's a weekend or I have late classes around 10:30am."
