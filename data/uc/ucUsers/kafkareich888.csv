Mcat,fpbkws0,t1_fpbk7aq,1588472376.0,"Hmm, I didn‚Äôt see anything about mcat scores not being transmitted for those who have already taken it. Never said not to submit your test score"
Mcat,fpbizlo,t1_fpb5cx0,1588471108.0,"Hey... I was meant to take the exam in March which still counts as an ‚Äúearly‚Äù date. Please don‚Äôt make it seem as if you fall in a different category from us. None of us saw this coming and it‚Äôs not fair to say that you decided to take it early and we‚Äôre screwing you over. I was not supposed to be a late test taker, I was fully prepared after studying 6 months for an exam that was cancelled at the last minute."
berkeley,fp8ssn2,t1_fp8gy7c,1588401803.0,"Oh I see, thank you :)"
berkeley,fp8sr4y,t1_fp8kizu,1588401764.0,"Same, I don't think it would be safe for me to fly back. I was hoping that their email meant that no matter what circumstances you're in, there will be an online option of classes available."
berkeley,fp8so4c,t1_fp8htss,1588401684.0,"Got it thanks, I was worried that only select classes would be offered an online option. I'm not completely sure if I will be able to make it back to Berkeley in the fall."
berkeley,fp8sj6r,t1_fp8jzxs,1588401556.0,"Thanks, this is what I was kind of worried about - that I would be locked out of certain classes if I am not able to be there in person"
premed,fp54kvk,t3_gaxct3,1588316100.0,"Yup, they're willing to risk our lives now but JUST WAIT until a case arises where someone gets infected because of their nonsense."
Mcat,fp54gz5,t3_gaumtu,1588316003.0,"Wow!!!! I can't believe the lengths they will go to just to make sure that they get their money. What if someone contracts COVID-19 while traveling? What if someone brings over COVID-19 from another area? 

Are they in their right minds? How can this institution represent healthcare? Absolutely disgusting."
berkeley,fotohen,t3_g9bdzy,1588060506.0,"Just pulled out of my lease for the fall since I know I won't be going back for the summer and fall, I'd rather look for something during spring because the savings are huge - no matter how far or how much more expensive the apartment might be in the spring it still ends up cheaper than spending on an empty apartment for 7 months"
berkeley,foj7w6c,t3_g7ofcw,1587811888.0,"I‚Äôm incredibly angry that they‚Äôre not providing any refunds when we can‚Äôt access many of the campus services that we need to be there for. They should have their own relief funds, use their federal grant, their ‚Äúbig give‚Äù money or take a cut out of their fat pay checks to find ways to pay existing workers. They should not be taking advantage of students who are undergoing financial hardship and charge them fees that they are not being provided access to. It‚Äôs unfair."
berkeley,foeooi1,t3_g17uls,1587709704.0,YES this is what is pissing me off... Why are we being forced to pay for campus fees that we didn't get to use in the spring and that we most likely won't get to use in the fall? IT'S RIDICULOUS.
berkeley,foe7tru,t3_g6rwvu,1587697787.0,"Why can‚Äôt they give some campus fee refunds e.g. RSF, AC Transit, and other services that we cannot use? I find it really unreasonable. Yea sure we‚Äôll have access to staff through online classes which is ok to pay for but the issue is that we‚Äôre paying for services that we can‚Äôt even use!! Tell me where the money for our RSF membership that we‚Äôre paying for is going to when the gym is closed?? This is just really unreasonable. Considering the added fact that I already signed a lease for off-campus housing in January and now they can‚Äôt even give us a concrete answer so that I know whether I should argue to terminate the lease or not ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
berkeley,fo950bj,t1_fo7bnbz,1587610682.0,"so far it says that it's not but I'm going to try to ask my advisor if there are options over the summer to take in place of this class, thank you"

Mcat,fnzxevw,t1_fnzv41w,1587402409.0,"I agree with you, we still have to submit without a score instead of the original plans that many people had of receiving their score before applying. So at the end of the day this benefits people who already have an mcat score who can spend more time working on their app"

berkeley,fnr18x1,t3_g3dx3i,1587176874.0,I‚Äôm an MCB and Public Health major! It is doable since theres a huge overlap with lower divs and you can do an overlap with 2 courses for upper divs. I planned out my schedule from freshman year
Mcat,fnputoe,t3_g38sax,1587152404.0,"When are these dates, how fast will scores be expedited. Send help this vague response means nothing to me"
Mcat,fnpumql,t3_g38lkq,1587152304.0,I still can‚Äôt believe this was real

Mcat,fnpk7u0,t3_g36dy5,1587146950.0,Waiting for another probably vague response what a trap üò≠
Mcat,fnpfydw,t1_fnpfp81,1587144823.0,Oh never knew that we were supposed to ignore the hardships that we and others might be facing just because we're privileged enough to focus on the positive! My bad...
Mcat,fnpfbto,t3_g34mwt,1587144509.0,Anybody know why this is getting downvotes? Did I lie...

Mcat,fnp58cb,t1_fnp4t6j,1587139431.0,"Yea, I mean you would expect the medical field to be the most understanding in the midst of this type of crisis"

Mcat,fnp3cyu,t3_g32uqo,1587138507.0,"Yup, they‚Äôre unprofessional - most people study continuously for the MCAT for a set amount of time. What have we had to deal with?
1. Last-minute cancellations
2. Last-minute rescheduling
3. A GLOBAL PANDEMIC
4. Loved ones / friends / people we know getting COVID-19
5. Pearson hanging up on us
6. AAMC being unresponsive and not transparent
7. No changes in application cycle 
8. Pushing myself to pretend its okay to enter a test center and avoid risk of contracting or passing along a deadly disease

Tell me how the hell I‚Äôm supposed to do my best or SURVIVE in this situation???"
Mcat,fnp1zfc,t1_fnoqfqv,1587137830.0,"They didn‚Äôt specify a time, really annoying"

premed,fno5i11,t1_fno59u2,1587112826.0,Thank you! Do you know if I would be allowed to submit secondaries before getting my MCAT score?

Mcat,fnn7g9a,t3_g2npqk,1587086067.0,Hoping they‚Äôll announce delaying the application dates based on the tweet from AMCAS that ‚Äúthe 2021 AMCAS application cycle dates are under evaluation.‚Äù
Mcat,fni4lz8,t1_fni3677,1586973887.0,Damn wouldn‚Äôt it be a huge waste of money to apply that late though üò≠
Mcat,fni1vrv,t1_fni0ilr,1586972571.0,Oh you‚Äôre right lol so saying that they accept ALL of 2020 dates really doesn‚Äôt make a difference
premed,fni0b0b,t1_fni079b,1586971814.0,Thank you so much :)
Mcat,fni046x,t1_fnhz9lj,1586971726.0,Also they‚Äôre accepting 2020 mcats so until dec
Mcat,fni02lm,t1_fnhz9lj,1586971705.0,Doesn‚Äôt say if you can apply without an MCAT
Mcat,fnhxem5,t3_g1vu14,1586970451.0,I found this response kind of underwhelming :( so that means we‚Äôre still at a disadvantage compared to people who have already taken the MCAT. Also doesn‚Äôt say about whether we can apply without receiving our MCAT score and if our application will be reviewed without an MCAT score. It‚Äôs basically the same position as we were in before where we‚Äôre stuck waiting for when we can take the MCAT

Mcat,fngx4z5,t3_g1ln7t,1586948209.0,"Hey, I'm an international applying to MD schools this year. Its hard but its not impossible, I know another international from my school who got in this year but with very high stats and impressive research. You have to be ready to perform and do the best you can - we need to be well above average because there are less spots for us. Also need to be able to show that you can afford med school for the 4 years. Good luck!"
Mcat,fng9m26,t3_g1kenw,1586925805.0,Same - seeing everyone‚Äôs posts about getting their scores back makes me think of what could have been and makes me feel really sad :(

premed,fnddt3d,t3_g13zv5,1586867466.0,Are we allowed to request transcripts after spring grades are released?
Mcat,fncwrsq,t3_g0w6rf,1586849911.0,‚ÄúHave not... traveled to affected areas‚Äù isn‚Äôt everywhere affected though?? And how can they make sure that we haven‚Äôt unknowingly been in contact with someone who was just asymptomatic üò£
Mcat,fnamebn,t3_g0mz8w,1586800007.0,Wow I‚Äôm shook they‚Äôre making decisions this early. Meanwhile aamc still hasn‚Äôt said anything definite about applications that open in a month üôÉüôÉ
Mcat,fnag788,t1_fnaer4v,1586796947.0,"Probably but considering that I already studied for a long time for my initial 3/27 date, I think that content is something that I can refresh myself on quickly when I have more certainty and can focus on studying completely.

Mcat,fnabnq6,t3_g0lq0e,1586794645.0,Yep took basically a 3 week break to work on app stuff and school
Mcat,fnabkn2,t3_g0lt3f,1586794600.0,I think that it depends on how schools adjust this cycle. If they don‚Äôt make any changes then yes probably because more people will be pushed to next year.

Mcat,fn5toxv,t1_fn3wej0,1586675528.0,That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôll review our app tho right
premed,fn5tlt8,t1_fn5p6nh,1586675443.0,What if it never comes tho...
premed,fn5tfj3,t1_fn5qrsv,1586675270.0,Where are you finding that most med schools are proceeding with the rest of the app process without MCAT scores? I have only seen California med schools do this and have been searching through med school websites to see if other med schools are doing this but most are being really vague saying that they‚Äôll accept a late MCAT - I don‚Äôt really know if that means we have a chance to get to interviews without a score though??
premed,fn56bxp,t3_fzd4dc,1586656982.0,Are we allowed to apply to all schools without the MCAT or are we supposed to wait for specific statements from each school that we can do that (like the statement released by California medical schools)?
Mcat,fn3vxzc,t3_fz941w,1586628973.0,Are you already allowed to submit apps without an MCAT score? Or do we need to look into each school specifically?
Mcat,fn30zn0,t3_fy9r34,1586609928.0,RemindME! 2 days
Mcat,fn2epm3,t1_fn2c30l,1586586420.0,"Yes, I think a lot of people have been so focused on even getting an mcat date that there hasn't been time to think about the repercussions of gathering at a test center :/"
Mcat,fn24a30,t1_fn22pju,1586577458.0,"I agree, I find it hard to picture how the MCAT could realistically take place in person without putting us at risk. We shouldn't be forced to put our lives at risk just to get a shot of applying :("
Mcat,fn23rzv,t1_fn2177g,1586577072.0,"Thank you, I really hope that everyone else planning to take the MCAT is as cautious as you so that we can all stay safe :')"
Mcat,fn22rjy,t3_fytfx7,1586576311.0,I agree it should be online... some people are going to be traveling to other states/countries for this test and we‚Äôre going to be risking having people gathered in a room or building for several hours during a global pandemic. Its a bit irresponsible if someone loses their life or puts their loved ones at risk because of this :(
Mcat,fmwzm9f,t3_fxp624,1586455834.0,Also so confused about what this means - since they won‚Äôt make a final decision without the mcat score this just means you could possibly get all the way to the interview stage still having to think about the mcat if it gets cancelled until then which is just really ridiculous??
Mcat,fmuwfg2,t3_fxgx3r,1586400400.0,I laughed too hard before going back to realizing this is me :)
Mcat,fmoqgn5,t3_fl1o4b,1586266244.0,"I've been checking on schools and some say that they'll accept an MCAT score until September, does anyone know what this means? So if BY CHANCE the mcat gets cancelled until September we just won't have a chance to apply? :("
Mcat,fmeayci,t1_fmbqg8i,1585996913.0,"Hi, yes thank you for the encouragement. I‚Äôm just worried that a late application will put me at too much of a disadvantage because not many medical schools are saying whether they will be delaying the start of the application cycle and its really uncertain when I‚Äôll be able to take the MCAT. Thank you though, I will certainly try to treat it as a challenge!"
