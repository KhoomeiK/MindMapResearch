UCDavis,fnt5ew4,t1_fnr8j5h,1587234953.0,"agreed â€” not sure why their experience at UCD is being projected onto everyone else here, lol. as a current 3rd year who also has nothing to do with the admissions office, i can attest to your comment. 

just want to add on to the wildfire/subreddit thing: itâ€™s a lot easier to vent and share unhappy experiences on anonymous platforms. this isnâ€™t unique to UCD. everyoneâ€™s going to be stressed during exam season, complaining about horrible profs, etc., no matter where you go â€” wildfire/this subreddit just helps centralize all of that into a giant negativity cesspool. 

itâ€™s not a bad thing that we have access to these platforms as our outlets â€” i just want to point out that this is not representative of the entire student population. i, too, get pissed about incompetent professors, annoyed with other students, and bored on weekends sometimes; but theyâ€™re not a major contribution to my overall experience. 

like it was mentioned, university (and life) is kinda what you make of it. the people i surround myself with at UCD are composed of a variety of genuine, fun, and active people; so iâ€™m (mostly) having a good time. i wonâ€™t deny that there are definitely some weirdos, fakes, and snakes out here, but iâ€™d be surprised if you didnâ€™t find them at other universities/in the real world outside of school."
UCDavis,fl60p94,t3_fmbtrp,1584850858.0,"hi! 

you can probably find similar answers to this question in many, many places; so here are my personal, very biased reasons for choosing the life out here with the cows:

â€”

itâ€™s chill here and not as hardcore cut throat like in some other unis

iâ€™ve always liked biking so i like zooming around campus everywhere

i love the ARC so very much! itâ€™s giant and has: an indoor track, basketball courts, volleyball courts, badminton/indoor soccer/whatever courts, racketball/squash courts, weights, resistance machines, treadmills, etc etc. 

i can see a bunch of stars at night! way more than from my hometown near a large city

i love the walking proximity to downtown â€” itâ€™s right next door! i also really like downtown itself; with its many shops all centralized it feels cozy and everything is easily reachable. the farmerâ€™s market is also pretty nice!
i especially love the atmosphere and everything of A x 3rd street: the cobblestones, the lampposts, the shops, the people strolling around (and now an obelisk...)


and if you ever get tired of all of that, youre an hour or so from the bay! and once that gets tiring, youre an hour or so from tahoe! (by car, not by bike)


â€”

boring closing remarks!: 

a lot of people on social media like reddit may give the impression that davis is boring, that itâ€™s lonely here, the people are unapproachable, etc.; but really, college is what you make of it. seriously. 

big boi parties arent really my thing, but even so my schedule is literally packed most weeks and i always have something to do.

i didnt go to ucd in my first year, missing the opportunity of meeting others in the dorms; yet ive still been able to meet many, many cool people from all over. 
from people in my classes, to people at the ARC, to people while doing my grocery shopping, itâ€™s kind of crazy how many friends you can make if you go in with the right mindset. 


no matter where you choose to go, a lot of what you get from your college experience comes from your own attitude and behavior! this is a super exciting time and i hope everything works out for you in the future :)"
