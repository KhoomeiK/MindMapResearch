I went through the same exact experience last semester feeling lost and constant frustration with no real help. things that helped me get through that time was just cleaning little things around me. cleaning just helped me have a break and clear a little bit of that depressive feeling. That feeling that you aren’t enough for this project really got to me and i hope it doesn’t get you too! trust me, you’ll look back at your projects when you’re done with this class and be surprised at how much you’ve accomplished. keep fighting and living"
