My beef with it is if I'm working on an exam and come across a problem that's ""technically unsolvable,"" I'm going to assume it *is* solvable because it's on the final and so of course it must have an answer. No one in their right mind is going to think that it's a trick question. I'd waste so much exam time on that.

>could that lead to an SJA referral?

Yes, I would say so. But if the answer is correct, it'd be difficult to prove. Take the paranoia as a good warning. Chegg is a helpful resource, but leave it out of the exam room."

These are all questions that no one has answers to."

What, in particular, has been overwhelming? Is it the material? If so I think spending a lot of time with the material is your best bet. Beyond the usual office hours and tutoring etc, if your professor's explanation is confusing, there's tons of youtube videos that cover the same topics in a more intuitive manner."

I appreciate the gusto, but I have better things to do. Like sink into a depressive episode."
