UCSC,fpiw4nc,t3_gdlvxa,1588650105.0,"My advise is that a double major is not worth the extra work.  I was doing a minor in Math and CS while I was an undergrad but decided to switch CS to a minor. You'll be paying thousands extra for little added benefit and you'll also be devoting so many more hours of your time towards meeting the second major requirements. Perhaps you could do a minor, learn about your second topic of interest through work, self study, or attend grad school."
UCSC,fpa6lm0,t1_fp4h7x8,1588441854.0,"Maybe he wasn't concerned about the students cheating at all. Maybe he was waiting for Good Will Hunting to show up and prove that there isn't a solution and leave a comment like:""What ahh yahh, fackin stupid or sumtin""."
UCSC,foieif1,t3_g7hv5e,1587784790.0,"I think that they don't reduce tuition because they don't have to. UC is one of the most recognizable brands in the world and I'm sure that there are millions of people around the world who would be elated to obtain a degree from UC \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and be able to do it online. Likewise, the US government pays a large part of domestic tuitions so, in my opinion, tuitions would largely stay the same unless these two sources were to pay less."
UCSC,fo5zk6f,t1_fnzgc7g,1587540994.0,I'm glad you are hopeful. My college experience was a lot of fun. I would also recommend getting out and engaging in student activities and programs since there are so many for little added cost!
UCSC,fnyebt5,t3_g4lbmn,1587360606.0,"I was either 27 or 28 when I went to my undergrad (damn, I can't remember)! I thought it was dope. Although the huge majority of students were the so called traditional types, there were a lot of students my age and older that I met and related with. One of my best friends I met at CC and we ended up going to the same 4 year. He eventually decided to leave and joined the national guard where he took up a trade and now works as a civilian contractor with stints here and there but has made a good living for himself w/o university. I also met a lot of cool retired military people who I found to be pretty cool since they, guys and gals alike, had no filter and were otherwise adults (which can be a nice relief in the era of Woke). There were also a lot of cool young students that I met too!"
UCSC,fnt7aar,t3_g3jd2e,1587235985.0,I say very likely. just think how many students go to class sick. Then throw corona virus into the mix. The student body would probably be okay for the most part but it would be a 20k strong biohazard to older ucsc  employees and residents.
UCSC,fnextwc,t1_fneq69m,1586897838.0,"I'll second slimfaydey. If you are interested in AI, I recommend that you keep learning python and that  C/C++ is a good set of languages to also learn since most ai packages are written in Python but will call C/C++ for their heavy work.  I don't know much about cogsci, but R would definitely be good to know for the scientific/bio/med side of things. Despite Python being the ""data science language"", R is a high level language used primarily for statistics and is well known in the scientific community."
UCSC,fml4p19,t1_fmkkgop,1586178529.0,"It was really all over the place! Usually, I remember most of the outages were short-about 20mins maybe. But there were times when it would be out for 2-4 hrs. The longest, where I lived on campus, was about 4 days! Maybe I don't remember correctly, but it seemed that outages lasting more than 8 hrs. occurred more than a few times!"
UCSC,fmkghza,t1_fmkciz5,1586154159.0,"haha, if you search back far enough you will see posts from ppl warning others to start charging their devices bc it was supposed to/ has started raining hahaha. Not kidding."
