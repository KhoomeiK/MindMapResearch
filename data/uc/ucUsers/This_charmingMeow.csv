Reach out to the department,  peer advisors, college advisor, any recourses you use on campus that can advocate for you like stars or DRC, the more people the better. Good luck!"
UCSantaBarbara,fp6v22b,t1_fp127pu,1588359080.0,"Same.well, I'm from UCSC and we haven't been given any money or aid from CAREs."
UCSantaBarbara,fp6u5ly,t3_gb2kgt,1588358642.0,Were y'all notified that you would receive this CARES aid from the schools? I'm a UCSC student and wondering if/when we'll get anything.
UCSC,fp6qjji,t3_gbduxh,1588356860.0,"I had the same problem, my mom didn't keep my records and the Drs didn't have them anymore. I was still able to register and just start school (although I started as a summer transfer not fall.idk if that makes a difference since there's far less people on campus in summer) and then they had me attend one of the many shot clinincs on campus where I received a couple shots plus did blood work which was able to tell if I needed other shots some how. Just make sure you let them know in the messages they send so they can schedule that asap."

UCSC,fodb4ip,t3_g680x9,1587682466.0,I got moved from porter to college 9 with literally like 2 days notice but I got a huge triple to myself and my cat lol Since parking permits are suspended I get to have my car close which is cool bc I can easily go to the grocery store to buy food since the dinning hall is literally serving the same shit to us everyday. It's hella quiet and peaceful . Lots of animals out.
UCSC,fod8zqh,t3_g6fh9i,1587681758.0,"I write down my whole schedule of classes and assignments and readings for the week in detail in a planner at the beginning of the week so that I can have an idea of where I have time and don't. I also set deadlines 1 day a head of what they actually are so that when it really comes down to it I actually have one extra day, this has helped me a lot as I am a huge procrastinator. 
I also give my self little rewards for finishing things like"" if I finish everything written down for today then I can watch my show today"" and give your self breaks so you don't burn out."

UCSC,fo0m3d1,t3_g44i4q,1587415581.0,I believe the financial aid office only issues refunds to banks once a week like Tuesdays?
UCSC,fo0ldzj,t3_g4lbmn,1587415224.0,"I'm a 29 year old transfer, well was 28 when I transferred and I feel like I'm also really mature for my age so I would say I do feel like an old lady at times like ""these damn kids!"" When I hear them running through the halls late at night or being loud (and screaming 'poorrtteerr' at 3am) but everyone is still very nice to me and age doesn't seem to matter. It's just a weird adjustment as I had my own place for years and then moved into the dorms. There's a good amount of older people here too, we have the Stars. Program for transfer/re entry students specifically that is a good resource. Also congrats on transferring! I had imposter syndrome when I first transferred but fuck that, we belong here too and worked just as hard (actually probably harder) to get here! Don't trip of your age."
UCSC,fnf56dt,t3_g1dq02,1586901602.0,"If u were forced to eat the same exact shit everyday you would complain too, so STFU with all that."
UCSC,fneunr7,t3_fzooq1,1586896152.0,"I complained to someone today , they said if they get enough complaints via dinning hall comment card online and in person (not to a server or cook but one of the ppl sitting behind a desk) they will eventually change things. So please complain on the UCSC dinning hall page, under contact you'll see the dinning hall comment card."

UCSC,fne9dag,t3_g0vq5p,1586885343.0,"If you're going to return in fall just keep it, the general rule is to update your change in work/living w/in three months so if you are planning to just move back in fall then it is pointless to update now then re apply again when u come back."

UCSC,fmmszc2,t3_fvrj7h,1586211489.0,"Wow, what an amazing accomplishment! Congrats on pushing through all the tough parts and damn a 4.0 with a kid?! That's what's up!! I am sorry you will not be able to walk/ have commencement and I know the feeling, took me almost 10 years to get my associates and walking across the stage has a much more deeper meaning when you don't take the traditional route. I applaud you and I hope that you get to walk when ever the next commencement happens once all this clears up! Although walking is a huge part of graduating, know that  even without walking you still kicked ass and made a huge accomplishment that you should be proud of! Good luck slug!"
