Jeopardy,fn2g2v5,t1_fn25p6x,1586587752.0,"Beat the #5 ranked Beavercreek at 2018 HSNCT by 10 points by playing a great game and stalling on the last bonus

Or maybe when we beat our high school rival in a tournament final where the halftime score was something like 225 - 215 (meaning almost every possible point had been gotten)"
Jeopardy,fn2fb8n,t1_fn27g9u,1586587003.0,Glad to see you liked it! Wish I'd been more enthusiastic about it lol
Jeopardy,fn2f7u5,t1_fn20ydz,1586586911.0,"Dream: CS or linguistics, since I was the only major in either of those; or Carly Rae Jepsen

Nightmare: anything that appears on television"
Jeopardy,fn2ewmx,t1_fn1xteq,1586586611.0,"I don't think any of us are inspired by James in particular, it's just generally thought of as good strategy."
UCSD,fmxv3os,t1_fmp3ghs,1586472457.0,"4. On-campus, pretty much every dining hall has vegetarian/vegan options - if you don't mind eating a lot of tofu, it's fine. There's also Roots, which has a pretty wide variety and which I find to be pretty good. Sounds like you want to cook, though, and obviously that's an option also once you're in an apartment."
UCSD,fmxug55,t1_fmt3uyk,1586472090.0,"I love UCSD, but I think the advice that as a prospective CS major you should prioritize getting into the major you actually want is correct - you *can* switch, but it's a hassle and not at all guaranteed. From a grad school perspective, both are highly-regarded CS research programs (literally one place apart on [csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org)). Especially since cost and other factors don't seem to matter too much(?), then I'd ceteris paribus recommend UMD."
UCSD,fmv92to,t1_fmursrp,1586409438.0,"They had an online test near the beginning of Fall Quarter, which 18k kids took; getting better than I think 35/50 qualified you for an audition. Those were held over a few weekends in four cities - mine was in LA - and about 500 kids got an audition. At the audition, there was another written test (probably cause it wouldn't be hard to cheat on the online one lol), mock games with the contestants, and an interview portion where they asked you about the ""interesting things"" for the interview part of the show. And then based on all that, they chose 15 contestants and an alternate!"

Jeopardy,fmunk7c,t1_fmuddl7,1586394942.0,"Hi, Alistair here! No, we didn't make any kind of pact about starting at the bottom; I guess all the college kids just kind of play the same way. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ For me, my reasoning is that it maximizes the advantage of picking the next clue, because you're probably going to have better knowledge in the category you pick and can then do better on the harder clues (especially if you're jumping between categories, because your opponents will have to work more to get their head in the right place). And this strategy is faster to build up money so that Daily Doubles can be worth more.

Or maybe it's a holdover from quizbowl, where harder clues go earlier in questions. /s"

Happy to do an AMA about it or whatever."
