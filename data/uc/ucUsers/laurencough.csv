UCSD,foz1tx9,t1_foxbwf0,1588183230.0,Ya but keep in mind you are required a min of 180 units to graduate so if you dont have a lot from high school you are going to have to take elective classes to meet that requirement. Also there is the 12 quarter limit excluding summer sessions for students entering Fall 2019 and after.

I met one person through my orientation group and through that person i met a lot more people. you just have to tru to make a little bit of an effort to meet a few people who you can hopefully meet more people through and orientation day is a great day for that because you are all new :)"
