ucr,foxl7ir,t1_foxl2he,1588147524.0,I would definitely email housing about that to make sure your contract gets submitted just in case we do go back to in-person lectures in the fall! But i think you need to pay $270 to submit the contract
ucr,foxl0ay,t1_fowxia2,1588147339.0,"If i remember correctly, both of those payments are nonrefundable, but it could change depending on the situation. I hope that if fall does end up being online, y’all get ur money back"
ucr,foxkwe1,t3_ga1c7k,1588147238.0,"I’m thinking that with covid-19, housing isn’t guaranteed cuz they may have to make all rooms single-occupancy to prevent exposure. However, everything is still up in the air, so my advice would be to submit ur housing contracts asap!"
ucr,fnfmvpo,t3_g0ast7,1586911231.0,"hey, i definitely feel that and your feelings are totally valid, so don't apologize! you may think that you don't have a large friend group/go to parties and all that stuff people expect to do in college, but maybe those things haven't happened yet because it wasn't something you really wanted to do. honestly, we're all here to get our degrees or to do something more with our lives than to just party or get wasted. i mean i guess it's cool sometimes and honestly if you're like me, you get serious fomo when you see people going out and stuff, but in the end, your college experience is what you make of it. and even if you don't experience these things in college,  your life isn't over. hell, after you get your degree and a stable job, you can party with friends all you want lol. but i hope you know that you're not alone in how you feel and if you need someone to talk to, i'll be here for ya :)"
ucr,fmsx52q,t1_fmrwava,1586363376.0,Thank you so much!! I appreciate you!! ☺️☺️

ucr,fmlk21i,t1_fmjorn3,1586187951.0,"living in an LLC allows you to live with other residents who are in the same college as you or relatively the same major or are from a group that you identify with. For instance, if you got into UCR as a CHASS major (humanities), and want to live with other CHASS students, then you could sign up to live in a CHASS LLC. There are also LLC's specifically for Latinx students, students of African descent, and LGBTQ+. Check out this website for more info on LLC: [https://housing.ucr.edu/living-at-ucr/living-learning-communities](https://housing.ucr.edu/living-at-ucr/living-learning-communities)"
ucr,fmgcrxh,t3_fuktzb,1586046147.0,"as someone mentioned, we're using PHET simulators to complete the lab. the pre-lab is due on the day you have lab at the start time (submit through iLearn), and the lab report is due within 24 of the start of your lab time (also submit through iLearn). lmk if this is unclear! :)"
