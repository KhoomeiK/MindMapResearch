UCI,fnfhhqi,t3_g1224c,1586908141.0,Were we supposed to get refunds after canceling our lease? I had asked Camino if people who moved out last month from canceling their lease were getting refunds and they said no. I'm still a littl confused
UCI,fmve9cj,t3_fxmiga,1586413992.0,I'm taking 4 right now because I was hoping to not be overwhelmed next academic year before I graduate so I'm stuck with these classes either way :l
UCI,flpbnqh,t1_flpbfw5,1585355770.0,I saw it and I even sent a request but I don't really want to take care of something that isn't technically mine per se and if something happens to it then I would have to pay the 800$ so I'd rather stay safe by spending less than that if anything does happen but thank you!
