UCSantaBarbara,fpm2rso,t1_fplz4ag,1588724384.0,I hope they give us an option to cancel or not and not just forcefully cancel or move our apartments.
UCSantaBarbara,fpm1prd,t1_fpm0jwa,1588723769.0,"Yeah they better not forcefully cancel the people in 2 and 2 program. If people want to cancel, have them cancelled. But if not, they should be allowed to live at the uni apartments."
UCSantaBarbara,fplsnwv,t1_fplrtc4,1588718713.0,Awesome. Thanks.
UCSantaBarbara,fplihj5,t3_ge5wme,1588713306.0,"This was what I was worried about too but for MCDB 110. All this online learning is making me feel like I'm not absorbing anything.

I know that the 20 amino acids have to be memorized, but in terms of ochem mechs and how to create these peptides, does a lot of 109C carry over?"
UCSantaBarbara,fpfcafz,t1_fpex9kb,1588567138.0,Does that mean ochem classes here won't count towards the 60 units requirment?
UCSantaBarbara,fpfc3bj,t3_gd0hwn,1588566985.0,"I would just take it to be safe. Even if you don't need to, I would still take it. Pstat 5A is literally the easiest 5 unit class ever. It is an easy grade padder compared to other classes you will take in bio."
UCSantaBarbara,fpcarre,t1_fpbfp0i,1588493561.0,The azeotrope one. I know everything is fair game. But then he shouldn't have made that post about how the quiz will be on just those 3 things. His post made it seem like it would.
UCSantaBarbara,fpavkve,t1_fpauux3,1588456615.0,Do the TAs and the professor have meetings weekly? Because my TA has been deflecting any questions on the quiz by either saying she didn't write the quiz or I have to complain to Gainer and it's not her responsibility.
UCSantaBarbara,fpaupm1,t1_fpate75,1588456097.0,Oh god. I can't imagine having to take his quiz twice every week.
UCSantaBarbara,fpaulj4,t1_fpat9h8,1588456030.0,"Thanks. Yea, there have already been mistakes on 2 quizzes where the correct answer was not there or the TA misworded the question."
UCSantaBarbara,fparsoj,t1_fpaqeis,1588454370.0,The ta write the quizzes and he looks over them and makes changes.
UCSantaBarbara,fparfuj,t1_fpapnk8,1588454156.0,No point in emailing. There is a curve anyway. He will just say everyone probabaly felt the same way.
UCSantaBarbara,fpar9t5,t1_fpar08p,1588454056.0,I just went to his video and copied down everything he said on how to fix emulsion.
UCSantaBarbara,fpaeskz,t3_gcbv4g,1588446671.0,"""Quiz will be on chromatography, extraction, and IR"" Then he asks a question on distillation. Thank you gainer. I really appreciated that. So stupid."
UCSantaBarbara,fpadzmq,t3_gcbom0,1588446192.0,"That was what I was thinking too. It was also very nice of him to put in that distillation question when he said quiz will be on chromatography, extraction, and IR. I really appreciated that."
UCSantaBarbara,fp6ydjm,t3_gbnfaw,1588360753.0,"Might have to spend extra money for housing, food/gas just to take 1 single in person lab. Fml"
UCSantaBarbara,fp4ym4y,t3_gb67da,1588310911.0,I got my refund back a few days ago. I also sent back my permit in early march as soon as they announced dorms were closing.
UCSantaBarbara,fp4k0kw,t1_fp4j6pc,1588300738.0,Most chem TAs are def not as understanding towards us as we are towards them and this is hugely dissapointing.
UCSantaBarbara,fp4ikm5,t1_fp4iag5,1588299837.0,"Based on your replies here, your original post about understanding and being nice just sounds so fake. 

If we are not given any slacks, then the TAs shouldn't get any. They are taking 2 weeks to grade 1 lab report when it should be 1 week."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4iag5,t1_fp4harb,1588299656.0,"We are on a timed quiz that we barely have time to finish them all. If we had time to check, we would. In fact, the professor already said he will re look at the misspelled words and give points back. So wtf is this about our grades plummeting after professor regrades. The way the TAs are grading right now, it literally cannot get worse."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4f7pq,t1_fp4dlan,1588297757.0,"The point is, the TA knows what we meant. You are the one who said Be kind and understanding. I don't think it's being kind and understanding when you take points off because of that. In fact, that's the opposite of understanding.

And sure take points off if this is an english or a spelling test. This isn't one. Misspelling benzyl doesn't mean we didn't understand the concept the question was asking."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4cs5z,t1_fp416jq,1588296298.0,Exactly. Got points off on the same mistakes as from lab 1 report because we didn't receive them until we turned in our new lab reports. They should not be marking points off if we haven't even got the feedback yet.
UCSantaBarbara,fp4cmtd,t1_fp48f0x,1588296211.0,"""Let's be kind"". Then they proceed to take off a point for spelling benzyll instead of benzyl."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4bzf1,t3_gb46qz,1588295828.0,"If there is an explanation question on a quiz, I automatically assume I'm getting maximum 50% credit for that. They will never be happy with any explanation I provide anyway."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4bwsi,t3_gb46qz,1588295786.0,These lab reports are killing me too. My TA marks so much points off for so many little things. The scores on these lab reports are actually fucking sad. Not even getting a passing grade.
UCSantaBarbara,fp089zp,t3_gakmlu,1588204342.0,LOL sounds like a poor man's proctoru
UCSantaBarbara,foyw5qf,t3_gad7tb,1588180294.0,No one cares here honestly. I’ve never someone get made fun of for not being skinny or being too skinny. It’s college. No matter where you go It will be the same. You do you. Everyone else is busy with their own lives to care.
UCSantaBarbara,foyrd0t,t3_ga5m14,1588177758.0,HOLY COW. Did not expect to get as much as this! I guess UCSB isn't as bad as I thought. Thank you UCSB!!
UCSantaBarbara,fox73d4,t3_ga1vwy,1588135708.0,Holy fuck I thought this kind of stupid protest shit won’t be happening here. Thanks for the joke op
UCSantaBarbara,fowiuzt,t3_g9yp4y,1588120637.0,just download video speed controller on chrome.
UCSantaBarbara,fow9ci1,t3_g9xia3,1588115429.0,Online orientation would be completely useless. Just go on gold and sign up by yourself during your pass time.
UCSantaBarbara,fotkvq5,t1_fotjtsk,1588057103.0,Yes can't forget about Latto. One of the professor who was so understanding last quarter about the final and everything.
UCSantaBarbara,fotjlbe,t1_fotjepb,1588055927.0,"Yes, people will do bad. But you also gotta give a chance for people who wants to use it to improve their GPA. So the best solution is to make P/NP optional. I don't see how that solution wouldn't work."
UCSantaBarbara,foti9ud,t1_fotgwnr,1588054760.0,Well all the universities in the whole nation has to do that to get rid of the notion. But what about for people who didn't do as well in their first years of college and they want to use this time to increase their GPA?  They should be able to do so. I don't think people are considering that there are people who want to increase their GPA. That's why P/NP should be optional not mandated.
UCSantaBarbara,fosu2ra,t1_fosmth4,1588038063.0,"chem is pass no pass. But if you are bio, not sure if they would count it if u take pass no pass??"
UCSantaBarbara,foshmkz,t1_foscfxe,1588030879.0,Are those 300 including just biological science major? Or they include like bio psych and neuroscience and zoology majors and other bio related majors?
UCSantaBarbara,fosheei,t1_fosg9dg,1588030753.0,I take back what I said. Looks like the lab classes curve down :/
UCSantaBarbara,fosfid9,t1_fosde8i,1588029699.0,"Most bio classes are curved to help increase people's grades. If people do well, there's no curve. As far as I know, only ochem lab curves down which is so stupid."
UCSantaBarbara,fosf9me,t1_fos172o,1588029564.0,I think not allowing people to take letter grade is too far. It should be made optional.
UCSantaBarbara,foojq63,t1_fooib44,1587940327.0,"Same. Hopefully, they don't make the next one 10x harder."
UCSantaBarbara,foojliw,t1_fooie7b,1587940252.0,"No if you google it, it says gram negative have higher SA. They probably just made a mistake on the solution."
UCSantaBarbara,foogp8a,t1_foogjct,1587938640.0,Bro it was literally open notes lmao. All you had to do was watch lecture and take notes.
UCSantaBarbara,foogb1q,t1_foofvkb,1587938432.0,Yeah. no curve.
UCSantaBarbara,foofufa,t1_foof2lw,1587938200.0,there's no way there's a curve with it being open notes.
UCSantaBarbara,foofa7t,t1_fooersm,1587937913.0,"I know. But if you look at her latest post, it says Gram positive has a higher SA to volume than gram negative and the answer is True."
UCSantaBarbara,fooc2eh,t3_g8msw4,1587936338.0,"Pretty sure gram negative have higher SA to volume ratio than gram positive.....

They gave us all credit for it, but still...they took a week to fix this problem and still somehow fucks up the solution. like wtf

They're really trolling us at this point. What a joke."
UCSantaBarbara,foltnml,t3_g86nuw,1587870212.0,"No wonder santa barbara county says this lockdown won't end until august. No one is cooperating.  The longer they stay out, the longer this lockdown"
UCSantaBarbara,folavzi,t1_fol8s0r,1587858363.0,I guess ochem labs is just one of those classes where u just gotta grind through it.
UCSantaBarbara,fokwnxv,t1_fokltka,1587850368.0,"watch new lecture videos...study for ochem lab quizzes...cry over it cuz it was hard af...study for ochem lecture quiz...cry over it again....do ochem lab report....wait 1 week to receive score...cry over it....write and read articles for GE classes....

rinse...repeat every week"
UCSantaBarbara,foizo7c,t3_g7p39z,1587802670.0,They love just triggering us for no reason. If only I could slap them across their faces.

UCSantaBarbara,fo76vrq,t1_fo76n5k,1587573278.0,"You realize that Sweden has the same death rate per million as Italy. With the US having such a bigger population, the amount of death would be tremendous. So no, they are not necessary doing that well."

I wish one of our quizzes get dropped though. It would massively help."
UCSantaBarbara,fo1ad8f,t1_fo19dn6,1587429027.0,Same. I don't even have the 2 quizzes we took. Don't even know what I did wrong.

UCSantaBarbara,fntx7hz,t3_g3wqu7,1587250326.0,It's similar to his practice exam. He takes some of the hard book problems and just changes up the numbers sometimes. It is def harder than joseph's.

UCSantaBarbara,fnngd6i,t1_fnn5xdz,1587091742.0,Why are there so many TAs btw for this class? Is it because there's no more labs you have to TA?

UCSantaBarbara,fnmhmgx,t1_fnmgg1i,1587071584.0,Exactly. The school should figure out where all this money is getting sent to if the student worker wages aren’t even getting paid. I’m all for them charging us if they are using them to pay people. But they’re not even doing that.
UCSantaBarbara,fnlwh2b,t3_g2k20h,1587060938.0,This. They are saying we need to pay because it pays for the various organizations still operating. But all these are not operating at full capacity. A lot of student workers have been laid off or being paid only a portion of their salary. So shouldn’t we get at least some money back?

UCSantaBarbara,fnf49bx,t1_fnf2g2c,1586901122.0,The max unit is just an arbitrary number the university created. They can easily increase that limit to allow for labs to have more units.
UCSantaBarbara,fneiilx,t1_fnebx8q,1586889981.0,Plus the 10+ hours to do pre lab lab report and studying for quizzes lmao
UCSantaBarbara,fne7s7z,t3_g19gbh,1586884558.0,Wait until bio labs where it's only 1.5 units. 2 years ago the bio labs were only 1 unit. Also ochem lab where it's only 3 units. It's messed up how these lab courses take up way more work than a lot of 4 unit classes.
UCSantaBarbara,fndwrls,t1_fncx5hu,1586878931.0,Wouldn’t it be smarter to just take a few stem classes and try to raise your gpa that way? No need to rush to raise ur gpa lmao. U still have 3 more years to go.
UCSantaBarbara,fncw8ga,t1_fncuktb,1586849357.0,Holy that’s a lot of stem classes. Why are you loading yourself so much as a first year? Are you behind on your schedule for your major or something?
