That way people at home still feel engaged (although at this point I would feel engaged watching a middle school basketball tournament) and the players feel the fans behind them since they’ll know the extra noise is from their tweets

There’s some good YouTube videos of stories of what happened, but basically if you put a bunch of young rich people in Vegas, they do what everyone does in Vegas and more. The NBA doesn’t want this rep at all.

But when there’s 1000+ people at the beach, which is a low to near average summer day, it’s really not.

They are so secluded from the world and so out of touch with reality that they don’t understand why social distancing is used. This is like Christians who think preventing them from going to church on Easter is a crime to prevent them from worshiping, and they think the same. 

The only thing they know from the moment they start to speak is how to worship god and study Torah. Being ripped away from worship, and keep in mind nearly every single act of worship has a social component to it, is not going to be as easy as a WhatsApp message to be safe or watching the news like others, Jewish or not."

No health official believes that this is going away anytime soon and none have said quarantine will last forever either. The main reason this is happening is to not overwhelm hospitals so that people who need attention from a doctor, a ventilator, or a bed can get it.
