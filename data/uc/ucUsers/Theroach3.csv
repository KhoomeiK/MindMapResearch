Yeah, it's perfect, that's why it contradicts itself with the 18th and 21st amendments... 


>Also you’re racist and have no evidence all writers  owned slaves. 

No one said they *all* owned slaves, but it is common knowledge that most did.  

>Also you ignore historical context when it comes to slavery. It’s terrible thing to partake in but take into account the time period the slave owning constitution writers lived in

This is blatant hypocrisy. You want people to have ""historical context"" for owning slaves, but not for the archaic document that these people wrote...

It shows that you're interested and willing to take the risk.  
If you're still nervous about it, here's a pros and cons list of making a move.  
Cons:  
You'll feel silly (for less than a day) if she turns you down.  
She might be an ax murderer or otherwise crazy if you succeed.  

Pros:  
**You'll actually have a chance.**  
You'll get the experience and confidence boost for next time, regardless of whether it works.  

Your choice man. I know anxiety is hard to overcome, but it's worth it when you can. Wish you all the best with however you proceed"
