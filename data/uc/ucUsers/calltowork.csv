 Some of the surveys are too extreme like a 30% in a class  is an A-."

MW2,fokrmnv,t3_g7z0sk,1587847623.0,"The ActMan has a good video going over why MW2 is considered the best COD multiplayer. It boils down to map selection and gun categories. Depending on the map, every gun has its role depending on the map. The Famas would excel in Wasteland while the P90 would obliterate in close quarter maps like Karachi. However, the guns were all overpowered (One Man Army Noob Toob was the exception) where they were all balanced based on maps. It's not perfect, but definitely one of the most rewarding games when you were in control of the match. 

This is very different from that of MW3 where the MP7 and ACR were laser beams that would excel in every map due to the same three lane style of each one."

Highly recommend Career Center, they have been hosting online office hours and workshops. If you are shy but want to learn more jumping on Zoom is a great way to start! 

Thanks for sharing about which Econ classes to take! For the electives, I've decided to take classes that interest me /valuable and not of just because they are easy."
ucr,fnpdcel,t3_g2990c,1587143517.0,"Major wise, no idea what to do other than using Stata. Stata is still a useful tool that pays decent for people who excel at it.

Higher Education at UCR is possible but I would start reaching out/emailing departments to learn more about careers.

Don't regret majoring in Econ bc it gave me the flexibility of networking and such but do regret not doing econ admin studies."

CoronavirusCA,fngrkc1,t1_fnghcoj,1586942316.0,"It's a lose-lose outcome for everyone. If most stuff would've been left open. People would blame the government for the loss of loved ones and mention how taxes didn't save people. If forecasts were true over 200,000 Californians would've been dead. People would be less inclined to go out bc of death count, trust issues with others/gov etc and that would've fucked up more in the long run. Frankly, this is a global problem, billions are stuck in the same place trying to get back to normal. 

At the end of the day, the small businesses are getting hurt more so than corporations that ask for a bailout. I think this a perfect opportunity to rally people online to finally demand Sacramento to step up for the small guy."

If Trump has high approval ratings (which somehow he is getting) for this virus, he might end up using the virus to convince people for him to stay and manage. Biden is going to have 7 brutal months and his let's get back to normal will be overshadowed by Trump's ' I got the economy running again'."
