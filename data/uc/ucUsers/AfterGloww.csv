Cubers,fpiuj4q,t1_fpi11x8,1588649030.0,"Depends on how much you remember I guess. When I was learning I stuck to 2-4 new algs per day, depending on how hard they were to remember"
AnimalCrossing,fpiu2t3,t1_fpitzn9,1588648735.0,"There are websites set up for this sort of thing, I wouldn’t be able to link you to it though."
AdviceAnimals,fpic1ez,t1_fphqk4r,1588637823.0,"You think a gun will improve any of those scenarios? Especially in the hands of untrained wannabes? Dream on. Here’s what would happen in any of those scenarios:

Gunfire starts. People start panicking and some Asshole starts shooting back at the attacker, probably aiming dangerously close to others and hitting them in the crossfire. People are still panicking and confused and Asshole B sees Asshole A wildly firing his gun and assumes Asshole A is the attacker, and therefore starts shooting at *him*. Repeat this process for every asshole out there with a gun, minus the ones who just shit their pants while they run away. 

Congratulations, we just defended the whole protest!

PS: it is far more statistically likely for a domestic terrorist in the US to be motivated by right wing extremism, so if you really want to “defend yourself” it’s probably safer if all those right wing protestors leave their guns at home. You know, just in case."
AdviceAnimals,fphjyuz,t1_fphi8kv,1588622608.0,Lol defense against what?
AnimalCrossing,fp2m3i9,t1_fp2epxt,1588264097.0,I was really surprised at how well google images was working for me when I typed in very vague search terms. For The Milkmaid all I typed was “painting of a woman pouring a jug” and it came up first result
AskReddit,fovfg8i,t1_fovdpkz,1588100416.0,I find it extremely difficult to believe that California transplants are outnumbering the locals anywhere. If they don’t like the policies that Californians support then perhaps the local population should exercise their voting rights.
AskReddit,fovaccr,t1_fov71s8,1588098002.0,That sounds like a rich person problem and not a Californian problem. I guarantee you that your average Californian is not running around buying houses in other states all-cash. Your average Californian is also loath to ever leave the state. Cost of living here is high for a reason: it’s one of the best places to live.
AskReddit,fov9ymc,t1_fov90wt,1588097822.0,No one in their right mind would move from California to Idaho lol. Anyone who permanently leaves California loses their status as a Californian imo
gifs,fol2ic3,t1_fol207h,1587853602.0,I think that TMZ getting those American celebrity deaths right is a tad bit different than the dictator of North Korea.

Cubers,foew8ow,t1_foew1di,1587716955.0,Only if you can afford it
politics,foe6bvu,t1_foe1zyv,1587696912.0,Explain to me how ingesting disinfectant will kill any of the virus that resides in the lungs.
politics,fodz7li,t1_fodympz,1587692922.0,The second sentence does not change what the first sentence said. Do you really not know what *ingesting* means? You know that google exists right? It’s this cool website where you can search up the answers to any question you have.
UCSD,fo6sp3l,t1_fo6e0jf,1587565987.0,These instructions are totally unreasonable. No bathroom breaks? Am I just supposed to shit at my desk while they watch me?
movies,fnth17w,t1_fntdebe,1587241486.0,Obviously yes people will want to go out and do fun things again but that’s not the problem. Can these business even survive in the short term? If major theatres go under it will certainly alter the landscape of the movie industry. New movie theatres are not going to magically start popping up once this is all over.
movies,fntgl5k,t1_fnte1d9,1587241228.0,I mean drive ins are a cool experience but I wouldn’t go to one regularly over a normal theatre. Normal theatres are more comfortable and the visual and audio quality is leagues better
movies,fntgddv,t1_fntfiwx,1587241104.0,"Not that I disagree with what you’ve said, but all of the drive in theatres that I’ve ever been to play the audio of the movie on a specific radio frequency that you can tune into in your car."

Games,fnahg0g,t3_g0lz2q,1586797569.0,"So hyped to see what this last update brings. Terraria is one of my most played games ever in terms of hours, probably only losing to MMOs or league."
Games,fn9bi3s,t1_fn9aq1g,1586766484.0,"Show me the time stamp where digital foundry said that and I’ll believe you. Otherwise I’m going to assume you’re talking out of your ass because you apparently don’t understand that input lag in an offline single player game has nothing to do with the game itself. 

90ms input lag is unplayable, period. If what you’re saying is true, people would be rioting and shitting on Doom. 

Watch this since you don’t understand what 90ms input lag means.

Games,fn9a3kk,t1_fn946oj,1586764926.0,"Doom eternal does not have 90ms latency. 90ms latency on an action FPS would be unplayable and I have literally not heard anyone complain about it. Furthermore, latency does not come from the game so calling it a “laggy ass game” is nonsensical. 

Latency comes from your hardware (monitor and input devices). So you probably have a bad monitor and you should fix that if you’re getting 90 ms latency."
AnimalCrossing,fn5trrk,t1_fn5ka2m,1586675607.0,Literally cannot go turnips up
personalfinance,fmd5p8m,t3_fubpr9,1585959895.0,"Probably a really dumb question but what’s the benefit to this? The money in my HSA has been taken out of my paycheck, so I’m really just spending my own money either way right?"
