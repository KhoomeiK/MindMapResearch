Hi everyone! I am currently stuck between two schools, UC Riverside and UC Santa Cruz. HISTORY MAJOR for both 

UCR 
PROS:
-Close to home (2 hours away)
-Itâ€™s in a big city 
-summer weather 
-Iâ€™ve visited the campus and enjoyed it, really nice gym 
-D1 sports teams 

CONS:
-need to pick a triple dorm and cheapest meal plan in order to keep my price low
-might go home too often and not experience the full college lifestyle 
-seems really dry

UCSC
PROS: 
-The campus is beautiful 
-cheaper than UCR by around 2k-4k 
-Can pick a good dorm size with 7day meal plan
-A new city for me
-new cultures 
-has a better reputation academically (rankings)


CONS:
-heard of housing problems after 2 years 
-heard about massive strikes going on 
-canâ€™t go home often 
-really small town (not much to do from what I heard)
-Iâ€™ll probably feel alienated because Iâ€™ve grown up in a Latino community (however I do want to meet new cultures/people)
-6 hours away from home
-homesick 


If anyone could help me make this decision or give more information about each school I would really appreciate it! Thank you for your time!"
