Do you have the number for campus grief counseling?

OP, we are all different, but work and school have been great distractions for me in the past. Not in the immediate wake of death, but perhaps a couple of days to a week later. Talk to your professors and let them know what is happening so they can work with you. I was in law school when my friend was executed in front of me and my school (not UCLA) let me do anything I wanted afterward. Truth is, I just wanted to feel normal after about 2 days of being a complete mess and the fear of always seeing my apartment on the news announcing my friend's killer was still out there, so I got through the remainder of school just fine cos I wanted some semblance of normal and it was all I had. The only thing that still made me feel like a normal kid. I did just fine, actually CALI-ed my evidence class on top of it. Right now, no, you can't focus, but it will hit you like a train at some point because you will just think, ""I can't go on feeling like this. This is awful."" and you'll just go full steam back into school so don't trip.

Hang in there. We love you."
