I got that ratchet you bought in a set and it has loosen several brake caliper bolts even with a cheater pipe.  I really like it.  I now have a bigger 1/2"" ratchet and sockets just in case my 3/8"" can't cut it.  I also have a 1/2"" breaker bar from Harbor freight."

I won't say it was particularly difficult with him, but the lab and discussion TAs definitely made it a lot easier with all of the extra practice problems they covered.  Sorry this may not apply to you.  He did jump back and forth with the slides during the lectures, though.  Again, I realize this may or may not apply to you since it was over a year ago, and you will have online instruction."
