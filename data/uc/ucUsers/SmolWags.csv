I think that's all the sources. Without Coyote's you're at 210% CHD, with Coyote's your sitting at 220% or 235% CHD. So he's likely a higher-level SHD player with near perfect gear.

* Chest: The Sacrifice/Providence (Glass cannon)
* Backpack: Providence (Vigilance/Composure)
* Gloves: Contractor's
* Holster: Providence/Ceska
* Knee pads: Fox's Prayer

If you don't have Contractor's or Fox's Prayer you can substitute in a good Ceska/Grupo piece and not lose too much damage. You want to aim for 3pc Providence, 1x Overlord (Fox's), 1x Petrov (Contractor's), and the last piece can be Ceska, Grupo or Coyote's depending on what stat you need.

I run the above build with Coyote's and Ceska knee pads for now with a Baker's Dozen with either the 12x and either a MG5 or M249. I use Fast Hands or Strained as the LMG talents. Killer may also work well but I haven't played with it too much. Another possibility I haven't tested yet is Negev with Steady Hands with the +50 round ammo pouch.

If you find yourself dying a lot because of Glass Cannon you can also try swapping to a chest with Obliterate, Overwatch, or Spotter. If you do, you can swap out Fox's Prayer for a Fenris set piece and run an AR over the M1A/rifle. Another option if you run the AR/LMG version is to run Devil's Due (Perfect Clutch) and use a Providence piece elsewhere. If you do the Clutch route you'll want to use high RPM weapons, so FAMAS/P416/Police M4 and MG5/Negev would be the best options.

I'm currently saving up for a MT-07 though."
UCDavis,fn8oip4,t1_fn43xyg,1586746345.0,"I think it depends on the roles you're applying for. When I interviewed with Facebook for their data science position, the first interview was technical (SQL/python/R) and product analytics and the second was statistical theory/probability and more product analytics. The questions they asked weren't really leetcode-style or algorithm based, but more about data manipulation and wrangling (i.e ""Given these tables/dataframes, find how many unique transactions occurred on this day"") . [There was a recent post](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fxgy04/ex_fb_ds_analytics_where_are_you_now/) on /r/datascience asking about the position where others said similar things. From what I've seen of your posts, a role like this would be perfect for you as it favors the statistical side of data science more than the engineering side.

I think I mentioned this to you before, but I'm the opposite of you. I think statistical theory is interesting but I'm not particularly great at statistics. I enjoy the engineering side of data science a lot more. But the thing is we have to know/be good at both programming and statistics to be a good data scientist. Especially if you're trying to break into the Bay Area as it's probably the most competitive place in the world for tech and data science.

If you haven't, I recommend checking out both ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" (CTCI) and ""Elements of Programming Interviews (In Python)"" (EPI). I've read through CTCI and am currently working my way through EPI to prepare for full-time roles. A great resource for algorithm design/knowledge is [""Introduction to Algorithms"" AKA ""CLRS""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms), this is the textbook we used for ECS 122A and helped me improve my understanding of algorithms and optimizing them."

UCDavis,fn4gaxm,t1_fn4fiai,1586640794.0,"No problem, I really enjoyed the class and the instructor was great (I had Miles Miniaci). He offered to help his students after they finish his class too. I believe he's a writing consultant when not teaching so he's very knowledgeable about business practices. He helped me develop a strong elevator pitch and talking points that helped me get interviews and an internship."
UCDavis,fn4fenb,t1_fn4f807,1586640266.0,"UWP 104A is more focused on applications of writing, like writing a resume/cover letter, website, business reports/emails, etc. You also practice things like elevator pitches and some networking tips."

UCDavis,fn0xc6g,t1_fmyaza1,1586550579.0,"Classwork alone won't prepare you for internships. I think I spend an equal amount of time self-studying for industry as I do on my classwork. It's a ton of work but worth it, last year I wasn't getting any replies but this year I've interviewed and gotten offers from several Big N and F500 companies."

UCDavis,fmr9e19,t1_fmpuo1e,1586317030.0,"> Admittedly with a CS degree you really need to have some side projects to be more competitive if you're vying for the same positions that bootcampers aim at.

A degree holds way more weight than a bootcamp certificate. But you should have projects either way to demonstrate understanding and ability because as a student, your resume will likely be pretty limited."

Ask the registrar about the parent thing, I have no idea about that one."
UCDavis,fmplqf4,t1_fmpl602,1586283078.0,"It's worth a shot yeah, California intentionally made it very difficult to establish residency. The state has poured a lot of money into making the UCs and CSUs top-tier institutions and want to make sure the graduates remain in California so the state can benefit from it. That's why they require you to show intent to remain in California after graduation unlike most states."
UCDavis,fmpkl6d,t1_fmpjx8k,1586282494.0,"I may have misspoke, I'm not sure if AB540 only applies to undocumented immigrants or any OOS student that fits the requirements."
UCDavis,fmpjrfr,t1_fmovvhl,1586282085.0,"Your parents must be California residents for you to get residency. You may qualify under AB540 if you meet certain criteria depending on how long you were in California and the number of years you attended a California elementary/middle school and high school. I believe you need three years at each (three elementary/middle, three high school).

>I have a lot of questions already in to the residency office so I figured I would ask here.

Your best bet is to contact the registrar's office. They don't care how often you ask them questions."

UCDavis,fmj45v3,t1_fmitba6,1586122664.0,It won't work for OP as they are not a resident. California is helpful to students who are California residents and are in low-income situations but not so much OOS students. This is largely because OOS students have not paid California taxes which support the UC system.
