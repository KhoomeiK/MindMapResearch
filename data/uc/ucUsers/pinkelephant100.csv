UCSD,fnnlzpl,t3_g2sljt,1587095546.0,It’s very likely. People always enroll in SS but usually have no actual desire to take classes/pay for them in summer. You will see as the due date for payment comes a lot of ppl will drop. Once I was 25 on a waitlist for a SSchem class and I made it in lol

sandiego,flrvwuz,t1_flrv2of,1585428980.0,"I mean scientists have inventories in place for the nitty gritty like they know the protocols of how to actually do these things and I don’t think they’re trying to start right this second.
