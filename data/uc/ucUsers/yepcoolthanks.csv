Unless you know you were late on any payments, call SBS and they'll remove those. Or if you're ""late"" because you're fighting the cleaning fees, you can get the late fees removed too. Saves you at least $50.

What does the actual lease contract say about damage charges? If there's anything in there that says you have the right to a report or whatnot, call them on it. Otherwise if you didn't take pictures as proof of the condition you left your space in when you moved out, you might not be able to fight them much harder on it :/"

ucr,fpiz4w8,t3_gdicdk,1588652255.0,"You shouldn't pay interest or fees on any loan funds that weren't actually disbursed. If you mean you accepted the loans last year as part of your fin aid package/FAFSA, you can refuse the disbursement with no problem whatsoever and you will not pay any interest. You actually can even take a disbursement and if you pay the fu disbursement amount back within 120 days they won't charge you interest or fees on it."

ucr,foljhph,t1_foieppw,1587863568.0,"Grad Division and the Reg has no idea who works as a TA in any given quarter, and they don't get priority in anything, don't worry. Your friend just got lucky haha.. I'd say give it till Wednesday and then check back with Trina. Banner refreshes at about 3:30am every day so if they process you Monday even early in the day you won't see it till Tuesday morning."
ucr,foi81pr,t1_foi0h3y,1587780658.0,"Is your last name in the same half of the alphabet as your classmate? If so, then yes that does sound a bit odd because the same staff would have done both forms and probably close to the same time. If not, I wouldn't worry as much because your forms will be processed by a different staff person that handles a different chunk of the alphabet and they might get to it later.

Start by following up with either Amanda or Trina in Grad Division next week, and then they'll tell you who to talk to in the Reg office if you need to."
Riverside,fofc69f,t3_g1v74e,1587732448.0,No it's actually super chill and quiet! Just look for a unit that either faces a pool or is back from the street :)
ucr,foempo6,t3_g6z62y,1587708007.0,"Drops won't be enforced with a W until week 8. Grad Div and the Reg office are legit fricken swamped right now and they're gonna take at least as long as they estimated to finish processing your EAF forms. If you still haven't seen changes by the beginning of week 6, then follow up. You'll be all right!

I ordered a book at like, 3 in the afternoon last Monday and had it delivered by the next afternoon."
Riverside,fnke28a,t3_g1v74e,1587023600.0,Los Arbolitos/Timbers is the cheapest rent per square foot in Riverside. I've lived here since 2012 and never had a problem. Would recommend
ucr,fn8vrqn,t3_g04r5q,1586751559.0,"Each department had the opportunity to determine whether their departmental courses would be offered s/nc for the quarter. And you'd have to opt in to s/nc, it's not the default. If you do want to do some s/nc's check with your advisor and they'll know which departments implemented the option. I'm pretty sure it's still breadth only, though."
ucr,fmrcmf6,t3_fwmki0,1586319430.0,Banner refreshes at about 3am every day and that's what links your registration to iLearn. You should be good within 24 hours tops

Your roommates can request that Housing replaces you with someone specific if they know someone who's applying for housing and they all want to live together, otherwise it will essentially be a random from the housing waitlist that wants the bedspace/floorplan you're leasing right now."
ucr,fmiysy6,t3_fvirsm,1586119639.0,Have you heard about actual enforcement happening?
