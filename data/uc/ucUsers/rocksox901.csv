It has these utterly apocalyptic builds and releases that work their way into your skull like some rough centipede. Their vocalist craggily groans like his vocal chords are suffering from irradiated decay while their instrumentation ranges from unrelenting drums to ethereal flutes. Equal parts beautiful and damned. Highly recommend to anyone who likes Swans or Deafheaven."
indieheads,fp7l0oh,t1_fp7chue,1588372620.0,"Very cool to hear from someone who had that experience. It does kind of put it in perspective that it's awesome that it's been around as long as it has been, as sad as its closure is!"
indieheads,fp735rj,t1_fp6n7jb,1588363195.0,"Same. Crack the Skye was basically my personal gateway into sprawling and psychedelic music. The back half of that album especially -- I always heard it as a masterclass in full-album composition, as corny as it can sometimes be."
indieheads,fp72ima,t1_fp6xipe,1588362861.0,"It's an interesting issue. On the one hand, everything we listen to now is likely to be tinted by the coronavirus context -- ""we"" including the reviewers. I doubt many of them are including coronavirus frameworks for sake of selling timeliness as much as it's genuinely difficult to disassociate ANYTHING from the current situation. But on the other hand, albums are not (yet) fleeting experiences. These albums, and reviews, will persist and be listened to long after the pandemic is over, and ideally, I think they should be judged on the standalone merits they have with that atemporality in mind. However, that is literally impossible right now for many folks."

indieheads,fp713to,t3_gbokup,1588362138.0,"RIP to a great space for local and emerging music. I saw US Girls here, as well as Tropical Fuck Storm. Both were amazing performances that suited the space in their own way. It's a scary time for live music, and especially small venues."
indieheads,fozadim,t1_foytkzt,1588187345.0,I have yet to find an artist that scratches that same itch. His music takes me to some log cabin on a river in an old and untrammeled country to which I've never been but somehow know. I'm smoking pot by myself and thinking and gazing at the woods and the mountains. So beautiful and so sad.
UCSantaBarbara,fow430u,t3_g9vbi9,1588112638.0,"K through 12 schools will almost definitely resume in-person activity in Fall, if not sooner, as some have pointed out -- that sort of early public education is vital for a number of reasons. Universities will be trickier though... there's a more diverse population, geographically, leading to higher risk of exposure; less need for re-opening to allow parents to go back to work, unlike with K-12; less need for schooling to be in-person for pedagogical effectiveness (as much as in-person is clearly better than online, a 19 year old will be able to get SOMETHING out of online class while a 9 year old probably won't). I imagine classes will be more or less back to normal around Stage 3, barring extremely large lecture courses which will likely do some sort of simulcast format."
indieheads,fork4yg,t3_g96dji,1588013582.0,What a BOP. Digging the more prominent vocals and that really funky bassline.
rct,foizz1a,t3_g7mlre,1587802996.0,These are great!!
UCSantaBarbara,fodl5vs,t3_g6spli,1587686053.0,I have one of these! Sick design. Shout out Felix and Alec who I think also worked on this? Or at least hustled haha
indieheads,fm5c9om,t1_fm4zu7r,1585770250.0,"Frank Ocean's cover of ""Moon River."" Really don't know anything else like it, even in his catalog."
