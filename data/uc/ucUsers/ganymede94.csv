ChineseLanguage,fp5348j,t1_fp4lmv7,1588314761.0,"When you say you had a dream in Classical Chinese, I assume you were speaking in the dream using Mandarin phonology? I’m curious because Classical Chinese can be pronounced differently depending where you’re from and what language you speak, and also it’s pronounced entirely differently today than it was pronounced 2,000 years ago (unless you’re secretly working on an old Chinese phonological reconstruction? 🤔)"

Chonkers,fo24cf0,t1_fo21uhd,1587449325.0,"Fair enough, good points. I hadn’t considered that perspective. 

I agree, I don’t think most people who post here desire to overfeed their cats. But I do think there’s still a fair share of misinformed cat owners here who simply don’t realize that having a fat cat can be unhealthy. I’m sure these people have the best of intentions and think feeding their cat what the cat wants will make it happy, but they’re just simply incognizant of the dangers of an overweight cat, especially when they could prevent it had they been better informed."
Chonkers,fo1yplj,t1_fo1qn0m,1587444764.0,"How’d they get fat in the first place then? Of course it wasn’t intentional. The bottom line is the owners were negligent and fed their cats too much food.

I think the main criticisms some people have with this subreddit has to do with the tone of it all—it does in fact feel like having a fat cat is being celebrated. 

Rather than having these cat owners posting photo to a cat discussion forum and saying something along the lines of, “I’ve been busy lately and haven’t been paying attention too much to the health of my cat—do you think my cat is overweight?”,

they’re instead posting here and essentially saying, “I am/was negligent of my cat’s health...BUT look how cute/funny my fat cats looks!” 

In my opinion, if I was negligent of something, I would personally feel shameful of it in most cases, and definitely wouldn’t go effectively boasting about it by posting it to the internet. But I guess some people are different, I don’t know."

It was a great time—were all able to catch up with each other and I got to “see” a few relatives of mine that I hadn’t talked to in years. 

It also went way smoother than I had expected—I had initially thought it would be chaos with this many people trying to all talk at once, but it was actually quite manageable!"
ChineseLanguage,fnnpoqn,t1_fnnljnz,1587098225.0,"For me, learning how to handwrite the characters helps tremendously in memorization, and in the long run, it helps with remembering how to distinguish from similar looking characters that only differ by a stroke or two.

For example: 

已 vs 己 

土 vs 士

 未 vs 末 

哀 vs 衷 vs 衰 

etc, etc...the list goes on"

Also the soonest we'll see mass distribution of a vaccine likely won't be until summer 2021 at the earliest, but that's being hopeful. Most vaccines take several years to make and distribute.

ChineseLanguage,fmnslmj,t3_fwd2ri,1586234121.0,"This doesn’t exactly answer your question, but if you’re interested in the etymology of the two and why they’re similar: 

“做 was originally a non-standard variant of 作 “to work” and meant the same thing. It was composed of 作 plus 攵 (movement). 古 is a corruption of 񃿒, which is a variant of 乍.“
