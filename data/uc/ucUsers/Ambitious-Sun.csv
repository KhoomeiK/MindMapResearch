Just know that I do understand. I took care of my mother in isolation when she got really sick. She never got tested so we don‚Äôt know if it was covid-19.. Nonetheless, I had to take care of her around the clock, while studying for various midterms and trying to do all the homework assignments (I.e. worksheets, activities, play-posit videos, lab reports) not to mention still find time for the little quizzes that we had in between. It was hard but not impossible. 

I hope you, your uncle, and family are doing better now. I understand a C is not optimal, but I‚Äôm sure there is still a way to bring it back up. You could talk to your professor to see how he may he willing to help.  Best of luck and keep your head up!"

ucr,fozyz8f,t3_gaimy8,1588199393.0,"I was in the same boat as you when I was picking between ucsd, uci, and ucr. Same concerns, same questions, and it ultimately came down to financials. I obviously decided on UCR because I don‚Äôt have to pay anything, and I even get a refund check ($1000) each quarter for expenses. I am a commuter, but I joined a LC and had the privilege of meeting my 2 best friends there. I have a stable study group since it‚Äôs the same people the whole year, and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even feel like I commute because I spend almost all my days on campus. 

Apart from that, I toured UCSD and it was really depressing tbh.. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it but it definitely did not pass the vibe check lol. UCI is very nice but would have had to taken loans, and it wasn‚Äôt worth it for me.

Nonetheless, I‚Äôll tell you what everyone will say: College is what you make of it. There are opportunities at both campuses as they are both research-focused schools. IMO you should consider financials and where it feels right."

With that kinda GPA zayum."
ucr,fnfnpdx,t3_g1gnaf,1586911716.0,"Yes! I‚Äôm a first year right now and a CNAS student. It took me a while to decide to join it but glad I did. It‚Äôs very helpful in terms of class registration, resources, and making friends too! 

For class registration, they make your schedule for you (core classes) and all you have to do is accept during your registration period. You can also add more classes on your own if you‚Äôd like. This is especially useful because many of the classes that they reserve for you are usually full by the first week of registration.

They also offer awesome resources like workshops and the SI sessions for classes like Calculas, Chem, bio, etc. Research is another big thing. Although nothing is promised, they definitely let you get a foot in the door for research opportunities (RISE, PERSIST, etc). 

Making friends is also a big thing. Academics are important, but I think it‚Äôs also important to form a good group of friends. I think it‚Äôs cool to be able to have class with the same group of people for all your classes because you eventually become friends and you know exactly who to ask for help. I‚Äôve noticed that those that are not in LC‚Äôs tend to have a harder time finding a consistent group of friends that they can spend time with everyday. However, if you‚Äôre joining to clubs and all that good stuff then it might not be that big of a deal haha. 

Hope this helps! ü§ó"
