My country does not have a strong biotech scene. Most of the companies don't have R&D here. Only a couple that actually do, and I don't think anyone is working on immunology research.

I've put a pause on reaching out to people due to the covid situation, I'll resume once things are clearer because I understand that it would be very difficult to make a commitment on their part at this time.

biotech,fp14n05,t1_foxlru4,1588224285.0,"Hi, thank you for your detailed response. 

I should mention that I do not have US citizenship. I will not be considered for entry level positions in the US job market right now. If I do take a few years off, I will have to join an academic lab, that too outside the US (again, for VISA reasons). While this undoubtedly could give me a clearer picture of the field and what I want to do during my PhD, I would be subjecting myself to the very low pay of a research assistant in academia. I believe this isn't a good parallel with your situation where you could be in industry making connections and getting paid decent. The only time I will be in a position to apply for jobs in the biotech industry will be right after I finish my PhD from the US.
