buildapc,fnn1wfx,t3_g2oqsn,1587082657.0,I appreciate ya’ll! Will totally start from here!
UCI,fnc2aar,t1_fnc25q6,1586827112.0,Because I got Kawhi and Ja Morant on the team lol
UCI,fmn4xa6,t1_fmn4ep8,1586218285.0,"I dont think I took sequential classes in different colleges though. I took my math and art classes all in the college I started them.

Try to hop on college confidential forums. You might find people who are/who were in the same boat as you and the forum champions are very helpful as well."
UCI,fmn47gs,t3_fw9vln,1586217851.0,"I took classes at 4 different community colleges on top of studying a couple years at a foreign institution but was able to transfer into UCI in the fall last year.

I had a full-time job while only going to school part-time and I had to fit my school schedule around my work schedule during those times so I had to look at different CCs to make it work. I dont think it hurts your chances as what’s important is you have completed Pre-reqs, suggested articulated courses and a complete IGETC (and probably compelling essays) to make your application as competitive as possible.

Good luck and hope you get in my dude."
UCI,fmiz6c5,t3_fvc23b,1586119851.0,My roommate had really loud ass party during finals week. Trashed the apartment pretty bad. Glad my roommate moved out; very inconsiderate given the fact it was finals week and covid was starting to spread. I felt kinda embarrassed because I saw our next door neighbors and downstairs neighbors go out of their apartments to see what’s going on. And I had to go elsewhere because there’s no way I could just stay in my room while they were all being loud
