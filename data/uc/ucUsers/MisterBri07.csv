AskReddit,foyjdhp,t3_ga4gjx,1588173584.0,"I had this weird memory as a kid of seeing photos of my younger cousin dismembered. Just pictures of her arms and legs, really bloody.  They obviously don’t exist because she is alive and well, but I still remember seeing them.  When I was like 7 I asked my mom about the pictures and it really upset her."
