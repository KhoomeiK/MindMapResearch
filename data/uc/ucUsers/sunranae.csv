LadiesofScience,fp8ey3c,t3_gbwrnm,1588390593.0,"I’m in the exact same position. :(  Internet hug. 
I’m looking into finding other ways to add to my tangible/desirable skills this summer instead of my summer research. R programming or GIS."
UCSC,fp4oxxh,t3_gb8ivm,1588303876.0,"I was choosing between HSU, UCSC  and UCSB (I’m from by Ukiah) and I think UCSC is a good mix of the familiar (Humboldt) and the new.  It’s close to my family in the Bay Area which was nice when we would still visit. 
Also, as far a finances, I’m on a UC Grant, Pell grant and some small federal loans and I am able to make ends meet, even in this high rent place. Idk what your exact situation is, but rent is nuts at SB and UCSD as well. Live frugal and you can do it!"

UCSC,fncpafq,t3_g0w1rl,1586842904.0,Ditto on the exam questions. Ditto on the slow-talking—which I just speed up at 1.5-2x speed and slow down for clarification.
