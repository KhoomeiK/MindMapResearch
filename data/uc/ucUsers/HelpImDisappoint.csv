*it is not"
ucla,fpcg5gc,t3_gci947,1588499352.0,"I learned this too. Simply have to adapt to it if you want to protect your health. Run early in the morning ( I mean super early like before the sun even peaks out but light is still out). Or run late at night ( I run around 1am with a flashlight for unlit areas). Otherwise avoid any path you think will be crowded.  Theres a ton of people doing the perimeter of the campus during regular sunlight hours well into the evening so I never even bothered to see if the interior would be any better. It's a tough situation, but if those people are staying only close to those who they are in quarantine with, can't blame them for wanting to get some sun. At the same time I know that's likely not the case with many others based on how my neighbors seem to be bringing people over every weekend."

Edit: actually thinking about it, this is most likely satire. Point still stands about Usac being filth though"
ucla,fo7pkzy,t1_fo7g7m1,1587582350.0,It's an ad. Ads from the creators aren't generally posted on their own feeds
ucla,fo22h07,t1_fo1mq69,1587447727.0,"*it's great!! I like to tell fellow students we're going to make they're college experience better and then not do anything at all! It's a tough job, but someone has to do it. The ""missing funds"" really are just expenses from all of our retreats and stipends; We went to Dubai last summer* ðŸ¥°"
mildlyinteresting,fo21lgy,t1_fo1ncvd,1587447009.0,Legit this is the reason I love nopales. The flavor they pick up from the steak and salt added to a grilled nopal is soooooo good
ucla,fo20wri,t1_fo1vsmh,1587446445.0,"I would say the campus has a bowl shape with the ups and downs in elevation. On one hill you have the residence halls, then the athletic fields, gym, other services in the flat area, then the other hill has all the lecture halls"

ucla,fnkqad2,t1_fnkjp3h,1587036665.0,Also 14p is more expensive than 19r. I'd say the only thing 14p has over 19r is that you could swipe twice during a meal period to get like a gelato or something and an actual meal. Or if you want to swipe others in with you. But its 14p so you'd be constrained for the week if you didnt save up from previous weeks. IMO 19r is the best meal plan. You wont be able to get multiple things during one meal period but you can treat yourself to late night specials more frequently.

LosAngeles,fn2qxqy,t1_fn18wc1,1586599722.0,"Rat terriers! I had one a couple years ago, tragically he was run over, but he and another rat terrier I had would get any rats before they scurry up anything.  They'd also dig into the ground to catch them. Easy to care and very affectionate. Only have to train them to be social, otherwise they bark at anybody/anything not constantly around them."
ucla,fmco4qh,t3_fufgpk,1585949446.0,"Offering 2 spots in a double shared room for 700(very negotiatable)! Rent is typically 875, the apt is a 2b/2b. There are 2 guys in the apt. Comes furnished with necessities like bed and desk. Fast wifi. DM me for details if you're interested! Might be a good idea if you wanna move off the hill and get a taste of apartment life, or just be in not as a condensed area:)"
