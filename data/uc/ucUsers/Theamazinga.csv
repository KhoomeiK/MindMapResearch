berkeley,fpierdw,t1_fpg2k1z,1588639410.0,"I feel like a lot of it is regional. As a California resident, I was always hearing about Berkeley and other California schools. Before my college search, the only Ivy League I could name would be Harvard, but that's only because of football. Throughout HS my internal college 'ranking' went something like Stanford>Cal>UCLA>USC=Harvard/Ivy's. So obviously biased towards SoCal. I'd expect that if I lived on the east coast it'd be quite different just because I'd be hearing about the Ivy's more in conversation and the news."

berkeley,fp56u7l,t3_gbcgfo,1588318319.0,"You've got a summer to turn ""never coded in my life"" into ""know the basics of programming"". If you're worried about being able to handle 61a you could teach yourself python in your free time this summer. All of 61a is online too, so you could learn some of the material in advance. An hour a day from now until the start of next semester would even put you ahead of the pack."

berkeley,fovrcwo,t1_fovhmy9,1588106196.0,"Thanks for the comment. I'll be sure to take 16B in the spring. I don't have enrollment priority anyways since I'm still in the process of switching majors, but hopefully I can get that all sorted out after this semester."
berkeley,fovbyvu,t1_fovbheh,1588098767.0,"I didn't particularly like 16a. Didn't do very good in module 1 but brought it back with 2. For that reason and that I'm in love with CS so I'd rather take those classes, I'm leaning towards 61C. My only concern is that I've heard 61C is quite a bit of work, but I figure 16b wouldn't be much easier, and I mean I'm going to have to take them eventually."

berkeley,fookhau,t1_fonrt5k,1587940764.0,"There's like over 3000 people in the department. Sure there's people you wouldn't want to hang out with, maybe at a slightly higher percentage than other majors, but you should have no problem meeting chill people if you aren't a douch yourself and put at least some effort into it. 

Also I'd really encourage you to make the decision of what your major is gonna be on what you're good at and enjoy doing than anything else. I got in here as an engineering major I didn't really like because I thought it would have good job prospects, good pay, and more chill people.  Now that I've realized that what really matters is doing something you're good at and enjoy, I've had to go through the whole major transfer process which is just a lot of stress you don't need."
worldnews,fonr5m5,t1_fonn0p8,1587924850.0,"The ""White males accounted for 69.67% of suicide deaths in 2017"" statistic is true, but kinda misleading. Males do die from suicide at a much higher rate than Females, but Females tend to attempt suicide at a higher rate. The reason for the disparity is that men tend to use more deadly methods than women, with firearms being the most common method of choice by men while poisoning is the most common method of choice by women."

berkeley,fnu0dan,t3_g3vy64,1587252080.0,"So I can't answer your question, but I thought I'd give some of my insight on the matter since I've gone through something similar. I got into Cal last year off the wait list. I think I was in the second or third wave to come out. This came after being rejected from a lot of my other top schools, so I wasn't very hopeful. As you'd expect, I was pretty excited I got in, but deep in me was a worry that I wasn't cut up for the tough Cal academics. I spent quite a bit of time reading Quora horror stories about people flopping out of Cal and it was pretty rough. Couple this with not even being in the major I had recently fallen in love with, and it was getting to the point where the anxiety was affecting my sleep. Not fun. Well suffice it to say, I come to Cal, and find out all my worries were completely unfounded. Of course the classes aren't a walk in the park, but they're also not thattt difficult. For reference I took cs61a, chem 1a/l, and some breaths. Now I didn't get straight A's, but I'm above the 3.3 gpa req to change majors. Everyone has been super helpful, both teachers and classmates. Definitely not what I was expecting out of these so-called 'cutthroat' weeder classes I was taking. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll be fine. Come in, finish a semester, and if you're still feeling like Cal isn't for you, then you can start asking about transferring. But not before you've even been in a lecture."

He put in a lot of effort trying to smooth out the bcourses issues people were having before the test, and everyone just went crazy when the whole assignment crashed. He did a good job trying to get everyone to stop madly refreshing, albeit unsuccessfully. He's a great teacher and I hope staff can figure out a better solution than the paper-thin bcourses servers."

berkeley,fmklm8r,t3_fvub5g,1586159264.0,"Since the other guy gave you some insight on 4A, here's my take on 1a. I'm not a chem or bio major and the last chem class I took was highschool sophomore regular chem. I was super freaked out for chem1a cuz I was terrible at my HS chem class and I knew I'd be taking it with all y'all crazy chem and bio folks. Ended up doing great, imo not that bad of a class. My R4B class was more work (please look on BerkeleyTime for an r4b teacher with a good grade distribution, I super regret not doing that). Since I hate chem with a passion, I'm sure you would do just fine."
berkeley,fmjkila,t1_fmivb53,1586132152.0,"Eh I think Hilfinger has cleaned up his act, at least this semester. No autograder issues, full autograder logs, better support, low grade bins, etc. It's a relatively easy A if you can learn Java and start the projects early. 
This is coming from someone who got a A- in 61a and am heading for a B/B- in 16a for reference. Like 61a, you can make your life a hell of a lot easier by picking up some Java beforehand. My highschool AP CSA class proved super helpful, didn't even need to watch the first modules lectures since it's mostly the same content."
