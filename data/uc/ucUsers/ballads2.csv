You'd also be making plenty of connections with talented and driven people, who motivate you and eventually could boost you in your own career."
berkeley,fnqw92c,t3_g3dnp2,1587173603.0,congratulations!!! welcome to the bear family 🐻
berkeley,fnbztr8,t1_fnb3lb7,1586825648.0,"clearly an unpopular opinion, but as a stem major who took it for the easy A with Hirschkind, I found the class really interesting. It's true the lectures were really draggy at times, but the class itself is different from anything else I've taken in the sense that it teaches you to question the nature of your reality, rather than spewing facts at you."
csMajors,fmgakxf,t3_fv1tx4,1586044784.0,"A few months ago I felt the exact same way, especially the part about taking days to make the same amount of progress as someone else does in a few hours. In fact, I was almost constantly thinking about it, and it really took a toll on how I thought about myself and it set a sort of dark cloud over me. Being surrounded by friends & classmates who had more experience and internship offers didn't help either. 

I'm in a much better place now, but it definitely wasn't an overnight shift. I had to realize that some of my peers were just more experienced than me, and that meant that they more built-in intuition. I also made sure the start my projects as early as possible, and it doesn't matter so much that I had to spend more time on them; at the end of the day I learned the material and got the experience I needed. I spent more time studying, more time leetcoding, more time applying to jobs, and eventually it showed. 

TLDR, this feeling won't last. If you keep on pushing forward and giving your best effort, you'll see the results. Good luck!"
