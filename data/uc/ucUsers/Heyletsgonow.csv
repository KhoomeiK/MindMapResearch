YES, I'm aware it's been posted. I don't care, I want all the shills to see it."
ucla,fph7i9s,t3_gd6jon,1588616333.0,"Thanks for putting the /u/daily-bruin on notice for their blatant bias. Journalistic integrity is not one of their strong suits.

They even avoided publishing stories about the fiscal impact of referenda so it would have a better chance to pass. They recently endorsed the referenda."
ucla,fph12sc,t3_gd6c0j,1588613092.0,"Also, the /u/daily-bruin seems to be in on this shilling as well. 

I posted this comment three weeks ago asking them to look into a story about fee increases

> /u/daily-bruin In a future issue, could you guys please include in-depth coverage of the history of USAC's student fee increases over the years?

But it looks like they never got around to it. How tf could they fail to cover something so substantial? And boy, how convenient was that... considering that they also recently announced that they endorse the fee increase (referendum). 

It looks to me like that intentionally avoided any negative press or stories that could paint the referendum badly. From what it looks like, they didn't want to publish a story that might hurt the chances of the referendum passing since they all love it so much. They endorsed it and actively avoided any story that could reveal the fiscal truth about the referendum. 

Pathetic excuse for journalism. They are incredibly biased."
ucla,fph0843,t3_gd6c0j,1588612659.0,"This election is rigged

The UCLA admins arbitrarily reduced the turnout threshold for this vote to pass from 20% to 15%. They want this referendum to pass so much so that students stop bugging them for money for all these 'resources.' They also control the vote counting, so you know there's likely to be some funny business going on. Nobody holds them accountable for the vote counting. They can report any bullshit number they want.

UC also just announced that COVID-19 caused an unexpected $550m in expenses. So you know the administration is salivating at the thought of squeezing as much money from students instead of forking up what they have. If you think your vote actually counts, think again.

USAC is just the puppet. ASUCLA/UCLA administration is the puppet master.

Frankly, this sub had turned into an astroturfed battle ground for USAC cronies. It's disgusting.

edit: I guess I'm a tiny bit annoyed that my post got redirected here, but I'm more happy that the front page won't be full of stupid USAC posts. So good job mods. Because nobody cares about USAC or their astroturfing on throwaway accounts."

There are literally thousands of students who are against the free increase, and yet they find it difficult to believe that ONE REPRESENTATIVE feels the need to be a voice for those students? They were trying to bully him into their hivemind groupthink bullshit. I'm glad he stood his ground. A council doesn't always need to be unanimous on every issue, ESPECIALLY when half of fucking campus is opposed. What kind of a leader would he be if ignored his constituents like that just to follow what his pea-brained colleagues were doing."
ucla,fngjj9w,t1_fngjdgv,1586934254.0,"He presided over a USAC meeting tonight where the entire council basically attacked and ganged up on one of the gen reps who doesn't support the fee increase. 

Basically, their arguments boil down to ""if you don't agree with support the fee increase, you're a racist.""

Robert also participated in this. His leadership has also been called into question in general for supporting a $45 fee increase during a global pandemic/recession where thousands of students and their families are struggling financially.

ucla,fmyzfvz,t1_fmyxki7,1586500781.0,Why are you assuming everyone is privileged for not wanting their money spent on stuff they won't ever use? Fuck off with that sentiment. I think you're the privileged one if you're so quick to dismiss people's concerns about the financial impact of fee hikes. I definitely don't come from a privileged background. I'm Mexican and currently am helping my dad cut lawns and tend yards to stay afloat when I should be on my zoom lectures. We are struggling because of the impacts coronavirus on our income. And I oppose these fees because it would add to that burden and because it is my right as a UCLA student to choose. The privileged people are those who assume everyone can just afford whatever fucking fee hike is thrown at them and who think that everyone in opposition is just some rich asshole or something.
