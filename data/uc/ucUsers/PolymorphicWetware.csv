Netrunner,fpihfey,t1_fpgo6tb,1588640968.0,"I tried to word it similarly to Standoff, but that made the phrasing really clunky since the Runner taking a meat damage is not the same as the Runner trashing a card from their hand. In the end, since there were two different effects (meat damage versus trash a card) it felt more elegant to split it into two sentences.

As to whether it's too easy a way for the Corp to gain credits... I'm not really sure. Cards in HQ are incredibly important for insulating agendas in HQ, and even if you don't have any agendas on hand losing combo pieces to \[\[Maw\]\] or \[\[Wanton Destruction\]\] really hurts. On the other hand, the Runner can't afford to play this game either because of the threat of \[\[Contract Killer\]\], \[\[Ronin\]\], running into a \[\[Snare!\]\], faceplanting into a \[\[Saisentan\]\], et cetera...

I think it's balanced just because it makes both players afraid of each other. The Corp might slam it down with a confident smile, but on the inside there'll always be that doubt about 'what if the Runner pushes this to the limit?' The Runner might smile back and thumb the \[\[Officer Frank\]\] they've got hosted on a \[\[Street Peddler\]\], but in the back of their mind they know 'that facedown card could be Contract Killer, and I've seen \[\[Dedication Ceremony\]\] in R&D...'

The mind games will be interesting to see. Uniquely Weyland in flavor too, as players got locked into an ever escalating war of bitterness and the Sunk Cost fallacy."

**Thoughts:** I posted this on the last CCM (Choice), but I didn't get much feedback, and the theme this time around is still relevant, so let's give this another roll of the dice:

It's \[\[Standoff\]\] but on Earth, \[\[Successful Demonstration\]\] but more interactive, and \[\[Hedge Fund\]\] but interesting. It's a way to gain econ during the money grubbing phases of the game, but it can be fun in and of itself rather than just being the boring setup you need for the fun stuff. It goes great with \[\[Punitive Counterstrike\]\] - are you going to give me the money I need to win two traces or take so much damage you'll die to one? - and pairs well with the intended function of \[\[Reconstruction Contract\]\] - thematic! It's \[\[Building A Better World\]\] support in 2020, punishes Runners for thinking they're safe from Weyland just because they're not tagged, and is the first in a series of faction-specific economy cards I'm working on that will be themed around making your credits depend on interacting with the Runner.

In short, I think it'll be a great way to show new players what Weyland is about, and at the very least gives the Runner a choice in how costly they want to make things for the Corp. I'm sure there's a certain kind of Anarch player out there who'll enjoy installing \[\[Maw\]\] the turn after the Corp goes down to 1 card in HQ trying to get their 5 credits, and I'm also sure there's another kind of player who's excited to bring \[\[Officer Frank\]\] back from the dead.

If anyone's wondering what bump keys are, they're essentially a form of lockpick that allows you to defeat locks as easily and speedily as the old lockpicks could. As I put it,

""I know I'm a little bit late, but would it be reasonable to add bump keys to the game?  From my reading, it seems to be about as quick, easy to use, and reliable IRL as lockpicking used to be before this change - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_bumping, https://acehackware.com/blogs/aces-stories/6069558-how-does-a-bump-key-work, and https://www.thespruce.com/dangers-of-lock-bumping-1835232.

They work on the same principles of as a pick gun, except with bump keys (of course) and something to tap the key into the lock, like a shoe or something. The concept is complicated enough that you should only be able to make bump keys from a lockpicking book or from starting with some skill in lockpicking. It could form a useful intermediate option between lockpicking (very slow, but silent and works on almost all doors) and prying (very fast, but noisy and won't work on stronger doors) by being fast, somewhat noisy, and working on lower security doors."""

cataclysmdda,foi37e0,t1_fohis57,1587777794.0,"I like the idea of counting vertices to determine cover effectiveness, since it means that standing in a doorway is a death sentence while the system I've proposed would treat it as providing cover. This is pretty important since doorways are death sentences IRL, and that's one of the first and most vital things you learn about urban combat - they're even called the 'fatal funnel' by the military I believe.

As to the ratio of your speed versus projectile speed, I don't think that will be necessary since this idea isn't about dodging bullets, despite using the dodge skill. It's about being able to duck behind cover in time when you see your opponent trying to line up a shot on you, and the dodge skill is the closest approximation we have to that sort of combat awareness + reaction speed skill. I do like the idea of adding health and penetration resistance to every single wall, furniture item, and vehicle in the game, but I didn't suggest that since I wanted something that would be less work on the developers (since it is a little bit presumptuous of me to ask for something I won't put in any work to implementing myself). 

I thought instead that a few discrete JSON flags seemed to be the best way to do that, rather than continuous health and armor values I know people will be arguing over till the end of time (""A wooden palisade should be modeled as having 200 health and 15 penetration resistance!"" ""No, you underestimate quality wood! It should have 250 health and 22 penetration resistance!"" ""Guys, stop arguing and tell me why cloth walls have any health at all.

cataclysmdda,fohz2wb,t1_fogwa7m,1587775443.0,"I also like that system, though I have two qualms about it. The first is that it means that a line of couches would be exponentially more effective (literally, exponential decay) than a single couch when it'd make more sense for the bullet to either be low enough to hit the couches or high enough to not. The second is that it's a little hard to properly represent cover versus concealment for different kinds of bullets with this system, since a couch that can block little 9mm bullets will only slow down a 7.56mm bullet and do basically nothing against a .50cal shot, and I can't see an easy way to adapt this system to that fact. As far as I'm aware the game currently has no way to handle bullets losing some but not all of their energy, since adding one would open up a huge can of worms on things like bullets losing enough energy to fall to the ground before reaching their target, or piercing cover without destroying it versus not piercing cover but destroying it versus piercing cover and destroying it. 

I think that the COVER and HALF_COVER flags could do a reasonably good job instead, because it easily supports FULL_COVER_PIERCING and HALF_COVER_PIERCING flags to represent this kind of interaction. It also helps that it can represent bullets losing energy by adding dispersion so that good shots become grazes and do less damage - it's not quite the same thing, but it gets to sort of the same place by reusing what we already have, and it's not too unreasonable an approximation while being much easier to implement than the alternatives."
cataclysmdda,fohw79i,t1_fohq9ft,1587773833.0,"Hence why I wanted this simple to implement, simple to extend system. There's a lot it doesn't do well, but at least it's relatively easy to make and therefore isn't too unreasonable a request to make to the developers, since you know none of us are the ones who will have to put in the work to make this happen.

Plus, by integrating with the crouching mechanic it can at least cover suppression: the thing about a lot of suppression mechanics in games is that it's some automatic force when really it's more like a choice between being dead and being suppressed. You shoot at someone, and if your gun is powerful or accurate enough they might choose to hunker down rather than fire back and risk exposing themselves. In New XCOM you can suppress even a Sectopod with a couple of your starting Heavies to the point it can't hit anything, despite the fact that it shouldn't be afraid of your starting peashooters. 

Under this proposed system being suppressed is the logical response to the threat of death, and won't happen otherwise if your cover is good enough or you're skilled enough in combat (experienced soldier with good dodge skill) to not really worry about that. The real world fire and maneuver tactics would then naturally emerge from that: the enemy chooses to be suppressed rather than be shot, and you can't move forward without letting up the suppression, so you order your NPC squadmates to move up to a designated tile to flank/throw a grenade at the designated tile to flush them out. It's a simple system, but it provides the roots for everything we really want to organically emerge from players making sensible decisions and NPCs making easy to define calculations ('how much damage would the player do on average through my cover if I stopped crouching?'). And that's the most important thing in game development - making something that can actually be developed."
cataclysmdda,fohc45r,t1_fofj7ao,1587763484.0,Slap some rollerskates (halved movement cost + a bunch of feet encumbrance) on that bad boy and he should be able to move almost 5 tiles per turn passively.
cataclysmdda,fohbtkf,t1_fofoqyh,1587763347.0,"With fitted rollerskates + Quick/Fleet Footed + Running, I think you can outrun grenade hacks with an effective speed of 300-400. Only on roads though."
cataclysmdda,fof7xdo,t1_fof6a8f,1587729012.0,"That's one of the most important things I was concerned about with this system: any system of JSON flags I could dream up would always fail to capture the complexity of real cover, despite doing a fairly good job of modeling concealment. When you start to take into account the energy of a round, its terminal ballistics, the various thicknesses and materials of any possible cover object, the possibility of damaging and wearing out cover, the possibility of puncturing cover without destroying it... it becomes impossible to cover that combinatorial explosion with any manageable number of JSON flags.

So I decided that New XCOM probably has the right approach to it: use just 2 flags, Cover and Half-cover, to represent the vast universe of things that could help you avoid getting shot. Things that are better at helping you not get shot count as full cover, like brick walls and tanks; weaker stuff counts as half-cover, like a tree or a locker; anything weaker doesn't count at all, like an overturned table. In that way the game can abstract away some of the difficulty associated with properly modeling cover versus concealment. 

So by being very selective with what we grant the COVER and HALF_COVER flags, it should be possible to replicate this successful system in a way that's easy to implement and extend. For example, we could give large but flimsy objects like the aforementioned couch the HALF_COVER flag to represent how it offers concealment without proper cover. Then we could give powerful rounds like the .308/7.62mm a new HALF_COVER_PIERCING flag that allows them to ignore the HALF_COVER flag, to represent their ability to pierce right through your concealment and murder you. More powerful rounds like the .50 cal could get a FULL_COVER_PIERCING flag that allows them to downgrade full cover to half, in addition to treating half cover as none, to represent their power to smash through even brick walls. 

Basically, what I like about this proposed system is that with just a few flags and the reuse of what we already have, we can adequately model almost any situation, ranging from .50 cal shots to Mi-go pain rays to arrows and bolts. And I'm sure mod developers would love a system that's easy to add on to, like by defining certain spells in Magiclysm as HALF_COVER_PIERCING or FULL_COVER_PIERCING, even if it's not quite as powerful as a more thorough ballistics model. With this system you can downgrade a head-shot to a critical hit, or a good hit to a graze, and that *sort of* replicates the bullet absorption ability of cover alongside the bullet dodging ability of hiding behind concealment. I think that's good enough for most people, since it gets the similar results in the end."

If I didn't know better I'd swear it had been placed there by a human game designer, making sure that the player has exactly the tools they need to deal with each level the moment they need it, and no earlier.

Too bad I'll probably never be this lucky ever again - I never did find another one of those things despite how many crates I tore open in that lab. It would be nice if some human level designer did make sure that the entrances to labs were guaranteed to spawn with at least one tool for dealing with turrets, like EMP grenades or smoke grenades, but I won't hold my breath for it since such gameplay considerations aren't realistic and don't match the realism focus of this game's development."

This would be more in line with the police and riot bots already in the game, and fix both the 'too much easily obtained ammo' issue and the issue with turrets being unfun to interact with (you can't interact with them; either you shoot them dead or they shoot you dead). 

So the turrets in labs would have energy weapons; the turrets in military sites would have live bullets; and the police turrets you see everywhere else would stun you and leave you easy prey for the zombies while ordering you to stop resisting.

Whatever we think of it, that's what he thinks and he's the one with final authority over this version of the project. 

I think something like this (alongside making Generic Guns the baseline gun model) would be healthier for the game then the current situation, where a few options require no thought to supply and everything else is impossible to find ammo for, but I don't control the project and can't redirect its focus from simulator to game."

We haven't even gotten to using magma to melt off their fat and make them fireproof, why care about that?

I personally consider Dwarf Fortress to be a much better War Crimes simulator than Rimworld or Stellaris, purely because the war crimes emerge from the ingenuity and dedication of the playerbase instead of being supplied by the developer. Why, sometimes the war crimes are *too much* for the developer, such as when Toady One (the Dwarf Fortress developer) was so sickened by the [Industrialized Evil](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndustrializedEvil) of Mermaid Farming that he patched it out by making mermaid bones as worthless as any other.

It's evil without malice, in short, which is something a lot of people have trouble understanding before they get to experience it. In fact, alongside Universal Paperclips, I think Dwarf Fortress is one of the best ways possible to get into the mind of an AI: getting you to think in terms of the most efficient way to get from A to B with considerable intelligence and zero morality. After all, why *should* you care about [mass kitten slaughter](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Catsplosion) when they're chugging your framerate and making your dwarves sad if they got adopted before they die?

So if a gun has a listed barrel length of 750ml, it means you save 0.75L when you saw it down. So it'd be more accurate to call this the barrel volume. Note that some guns still measure it in the old volume units of 250ml increments, so you might find a gun that has a barrel length of '3' instead of '750ml'."

cataclysmdda,fo4knth,t1_fo3k6eb,1587506156.0,"Technically it's even more complicated than that, because every shot also has a damage multiplier that varies with how good it is. So headshots deal double damage, criticals deal between 1.5 and 2 times the damage, good hits deal between 1 and 1.5 times damage, and so on. See https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/26ab54066ebd7dba0aaa81c5db5d2dc6a19ad977/src/creature.cpp & https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/7bd2498db2341e76e0eb91b976072d88c89dead1/src/projectile.cpp#L18 for the exact code that handles this. That's why JHP versus Armor Piercing versions of bullets almost always exchange damage for armor piercing at a 1:2 ratio - that's the exchange rate set by headshots. If it was lower, like 1:1, the non-armor piercing version of a bullet might be more powerful against an armored target than the armor piercing version - definitely nonsensical. If it was higher, like 1:3, than the armor-piercing version would be the no brainer against anything with armor. As is, both are valid options depending on how good your aim is and how many unarmored versus armored targets you're dealing with. Anyways, the ranged damage calculations are even more complicated than they first appear.

(That's not even getting into bows, which were recently changed to have 1/5 the base damage but have 5 times the crit multiplier - see https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/39203. A good rule of thumb for this game is that *everything* is more complicated than it first appears. Everything tries to be realistic; nothing is simple like you might see in a game that's trying to be a game instead of a post-apocalyptic simulator.)"
cataclysmdda,fo4hnnj,t3_g5fucl,1587504593.0,"It's technically correct; the best kind of correct. For you see, although the item browser reports that the plank has a higher DPS than the almighty splintered wood (see http://cdda.chezzo.com/2x4 & http://cdda.chezzo.com/splinter), it forgets to take into account the bonus damage from Strength (see https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/2a9b99775059555d51389e7ab911f6466a1521df/src/melee.cpp#L836). When you incorporate that into the calculation, you find that the more rapid strikes of the splintered wood outweigh the higher base damage on the plank. But the item browser is not wrong to say that the plank has a higher DPS than the splintered wood; it too is technically correct: the best kind of correct. So the real answer to 'is the splintered wood or the plank stronger' is ""*Both of them.*""

The short version is that normal people can safely handle comestibles with an addiction power up to 4 (e.g. liquor + juice cocktails like Wild Apple), people with Addictive Personality can safely handle stuff with addiction power 2 (e.g. beer and cola), and people with Addiction Resistant can safely handle addiction power 8 (e.g. atomic coffee and purifier).

whowouldwin,fo1fcwp,t3_g4e5vj,1587432077.0,"I kind of want to see a speedrun WC (World Conquest) run of this. What sort of ridiculous cheese would magic powers make possible? Can you run the standard CK2 eugenics program on her mass manufactured snowchildren? Does she even need humans if she can mass manufacture snowchildren? (She *could* just kill them all and replace them with her perfectly loyal creations, to counter the threat of assassination given how many enemies she's making and how low her intrigue score probably is. See  [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10021408/1/Kingdom-of-Isolation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10021408/1/Kingdom-of-Isolation) for an example run.) Where would her sister fall into all this, can she meaningfully contribute to a WC run? So many questions, so few answers...

... though I can hazard a guess to some of them. If she has some sort of Apotheosis event chain where she becomes a full blown goddess, the optimal speedrun strat would probably revolve around triggering it as quickly and reliably as possible, then conquering the world in like 6 days. See [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9923731/3/Comfort-Joy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9923731/3/Comfort-Joy) for an example run. Furthermore, rebellions would be inefficient, forcing Elsa to divert forces to pacify conquered provinces rather than keep steamrolling the world. But as the playthrough on  [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10328221/1/The-Empress](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10328221/1/The-Empress) points out, Anna can be a useful element for mollifying the populace, ""the silk to Elsa's steel,"" and so the pain train doesn't have to stop for anyone.

As for bonus round 1, Colonization... that's more a Victoria 2 thing. Luckily I used to play Victoria 2, so I can give this a go. Let's assume the game transitions to the mechanics of Victoria 2 at some point (I know save file importers are a thing, though I don't know any that do CK2->Vic2). The most important thing is to pick up Prophylaxis Against Malaria, since Elsa has demonstrated a vulnerability to diseases (see *Frozen Fever*, 2015, Walt Disney Animation Studios), malaria is unavoidable in the tropics, and it wouldn't do to have our star ruler die on the job.

Luckily it's tied to an early game tech (Medicine, 1836) which you should be rushing anyway for the pop growth bonus, and Arendelle should have a strong Research Point (RP) game due to Norway's high literacy. If somehow the invention hasn't fired by the time she's ready to colonize (it's possible Arendelle's RP game could tank due to conquering lots of illiterate people and dragging down it's average literacy rate), she can send in her snowlem forces without her. They probably won't do as good a job without her direction, and reinforcements will take longer to arrive, but with sufficient numbers they should do adequately and we know Elsa can effortlessly create a lot of them (ibid.). She won't have to worry about them melting because we've seen her modify her snowlems to not melt despite having no visible source of cooling (see *Frozen II,* 2019, Walt Disney Animation Studios). Relying on them however will unavoidably slow things down - not good for a speedrun.

Once she has the Malaria Prophylaxis she should be good - normally you'd need Mission to Civilize and Colonial Negotiations to colonize lower life-rating provinces, but I think Anna's ideology (charity from our World Conquest) and Elsa's own magic should acceptably substitute for Nationalism & Imperialism + Machine Guns respectively. If that doesn't work, the Arendellian Empire will have to step up its research game in order to grab those technologies the moment they appear. You can store up RPs, yes, but only up to one year's worth, and Nationalism & Imperialism + Machine Guns each require 14400 RPs (or \~40 a day to research instantly).

That's a pretty high bar for a large empire with an illiterate population, so Elsa will have to focus education in order to make it a large empire with a literate population. Luckily as an absolute monarch she should be able to force through as many Public School System reforms through the Upper House as she wants (she shouldn't need Militancy cheese), National Focusing Clerics in key provinces is very effective in this game, and Darwinism gives a massive +50% Education Efficiency and is available with Biologism from 1850 onwards. See  [https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/6ogih5/whats\_the\_fastest\_way\_to\_increase\_literacy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/6ogih5/whats_the_fastest_way_to_increase_literacy/) &  [https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria2/comments/4aadhz/best\_ways\_of\_increasing\_literacy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria2/comments/4aadhz/best_ways_of_increasing_literacy/)  for discussions.

If Arendelle was an unciv it could just conquer its neighbours and gain boatloads of RPs that way (rush military reform), but of course as an unciv it can't research Machine Guns, only try to rush Westernization as quickly as possible.  In earlier versions of the game you could rely on conquered provinces triggering events that could give you RPs at light speed (see ""Discriminatory School System"", event ID 15030, and ""The Flying University"", event ID 15310), but they've been nerfed in more recent versions of the game. It may be better off instead staying small for a while in order to max out its research speed, only conquering literate countries like its neighbors, so it can conquer the world faster overall by netting vital techs earlier in the run.

When it finally has the necessary techs and inventions, though, I expect the entire world to quickly fall to its heel. Arendelle should have no shortage of Colonial Power due to having a lot of conquered coastal provinces to spam level 1 Naval Bases at in order to support a ton of Commerce Raiders/Monitors, it should be able to easily win any Colonial Race by invading and subjugating all rivals, and there are plenty of countries it could conquer to gain access to foreign shores. Of course, it's still important to colonize the most valuable provinces first (those that will eventually have Rubber or Oil, have Precious Metals, or a large population that can mass produce industrial resources like Coal), but it should be able to snap up all of them in short order.

From there, it's just a standard late game Victoria 2 playthrough: wondering if the Late Game Economic Malaise will crush the world economy, stamping out rebels because education gave people ideas above their station (Henry Ford apocryphally said, ""Why is it that every time I ask for a pair of hands they come with a brain attached?""), and carefully laying out your industrial masterpieces like an orchestra conductor turned Soviet economic planner. (I'm sure Elsa would enjoy the last one.) If you want to hear more about how her choice of colonies, the Late Game Economic Malaise, and the messed up nature of Victoria 2's economic system play into Elsa's World Conquest strategy, just ask. But for now, I'll take a rest."
CrusaderKings,fo103n5,t1_fnzzn6w,1587423080.0,"The pope? To paraphrase Stalin, how many magic powers has he?

No seriously, if Player Elsa goes on a crusade (in 1840 no less) she might inspire more religious devotion than the Pope due to the entire 'magic powers' thing. In fact, she can probably just form her own religion (With blackjack! And hookers!) devoted to worshiping her (obligatory 'we could make a religion out of this' joke). Failing that, she's Lutheran and doesn't have to care about what the pope says, beyond arguing that God's on her side so obviously the religious schisms in Christianity have been settled from above.

... it'd be interesting to see the religious riots between those who see her as Witch Satan and those who see her as a goddess. She might actually have to placate the pope and his constituents, less they riot and distract her from world conquest by forcing her to pacify already occupied provinces."
