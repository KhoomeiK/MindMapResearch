I get that you're anxious, but keep in mind that it's entirely possible that your TA's internet was down as well, and that even under ordinary pandemic circumstances, people are overwhelmed with email. Everything happens more slowly.

If you don't hear in a couple days, email the TA again. If there's still no response, then contact the professor & make clear that your TA isn't responding to communication."

UCDavis,fpdlxgz,t3_gcmt2e,1588529589.0,"Co-op has local honey.

Eating local honey will not alleviate your allergy symptoms. The idea behind eating local honey is that, over time, exposure to small doses of allergens will lower your body's sensitivity to them. Immunotherapy is like a real thing, but doctors do it in a controlled way, exposing the patient to known quantities of known allergens on a regular schedule. The problems with the honey approach are numerous: (1) there's no guarantee that whatever you're allergic to is a specific pollen that local bees are picking up (i.e. your allergen may not be in the honey); (2) even if the thing you're allergic to is picked up by bees, in any given batch of honey, there's not telling how much (if any) of that allergen you'll find. Bees have a limited range of flight, and if a beekeeper sets up a hive in like for example an almond orchard, much of the pollen the bees collects is likely going to be from almond trees; (3) even if the thing you're allergic to is something the bees picked up and even if there's a sufficient quantity of it in the honey you happen to buy, you would need to consume increasing amounts of honey over a significant period of time for any effect to take place.

Claritin works for me most of the time. I also know that some peopel have had great success with the prescription nasal sprays (Flotrin?). Some years are worse than others for whatever I'm allergic to. Good luck."

Professors are hired primarily to do research. Their job is split between research, service, and teaching. Some of them teach only one class per year. They are evaluated primarily on the strength of their research. Teaching plays little to no role in their promotion and tenure decisions."

Recently, the University began hiring more  people into a Senate title called ""Lecturer with Potential Security of Employment."" LPSOEs can eventually attain ""Security of Employment,"" which is not the same as tenure.

And yes, some professors aren't tenured because they're still assistant profs. They become eligible for tenure, though, which lecturers never do."

UCDavis,fosg8ga,t3_g9aq47,1588030102.0,"Rankings are for the most part meaningless. Often, they're assembled by people who have little to no experience in education, and are determined by algorithms that have little to no correlation to real learning outcomes. They appeal to people's superficial desires to be associated with the biggest or best or whateverist. Almost nobody takes rankings seriously except for marketers, who love rankings because it gives them easily digestible ad copy to solicit funding from alumni; and  Administrators, who love rankings because it gives them easily digestible ad copy to justify their enormous salaries.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter if the school you attend is ranked by somebody as 20th or 30th or 50th. What matters is the work you do while you're there. If you go to a top-ranked school but don't learn, you'll graduate with a degree from a highly-ranked school and limited skills and abilities.

UCDavis,fnqsd1g,t3_g3buv0,1587171178.0,"Be prepared to feel overwhelmed and/or lost initially. Davis is a large campus,  some of the classes are huge (500 students), and the quarter system is incredibly fast-paced. All of this can be disorienting and disheartening to some, especially if they're not expecting it. By the end of the first year, it will feel like second nature.

Try to establish good habits in your first year (even in your first week)--that's often what separates students who succeed from students who struggle or just barely get by.

Early on--like in your first week--try to familiarize yourself with all of the resources available to you on campus. Don't just go online and look at a webpage, but go and walk to the office so you can see where they're located and how they're set up. This will make it much easier and more comfortable if and when you decide that you want to get extra tutoring, need to see a counselor, have a medical issue, etc. You mention that you're first generation. Two good places to start are here: [https://firstgen.ucdavis.edu/student-resources](https://firstgen.ucdavis.edu/student-resources) and here: [https://firstgen.ucdavis.edu/uc-davis-campus-resources](https://firstgen.ucdavis.edu/uc-davis-campus-resources)

Time management is maybe the most important skill to focus on. You're going to have a ton of work to do, and far less structure than you may be used to (I assume you're coming from high school?). You won't have (as many) reminders of projects deadlines, etc., so it's up to you to keep track of what you have to do, and figure out when you're going to get everything done. Treat school like a full-time job (because it is one), and schedule your time every week.

Get in the habit of going to your teachers' office hours. Go every week, even if you don't have burning questions. Even if you understand everything, use office hours to ask questions about things you're interested in that are related to but not covered in the class. You'll feel more connected to your classes and your learning, and there's a better chance that your teachers will know and/or remember you, which can be really useful in a few years if you're looking for a lab position or a letter of recommendation.

Try to focus on learning, not just getting the work done. Your labs are there to teach you important techniques and ways of thinking. Lower division courses lay the foundation for the work you'll do when you get deep into your major classes. Don't treat them as busy work, even when they feel like it.

Also, as hard as it may be when you're thrown into a brand new social scene and experiencing independence for the first time, try to make school your first priority. You'll encounter a lot of people who aren't really serious about school, and who always seems to be having a good time, and while it will be tempting to follow them, remember why you're here (of course, if you don't care about school and are just here for the social scene, forget what i just said).

Connect with good people, ignore the assholes, and above all be good to yourself."

**P/NP & S/U deadline changed to** [**Last Day of Instruction; June 4, 2020**](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/calendar/quarter). See the UC Davis Academic Senate's [**COVID-19 FAQ for Students**](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-faqs#pnpoption) webpage for the update regarding P/NP & S/U grade options. 

#### Spring Quarter 2020 - Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) and Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Update

The Academic Senate recognizes the stresses that students and instructors are currently facing in their academic and personal lives. To reduce academic uncertainty and increase flexibility when trying to adapt to remote instruction, the Academic Senate and administrative partners are announcing the following changes for spring quarter 2020:

* **P/NP deadline extension** — The deadline for undergraduate students to opt for P/NP grading, or to revert back to letter grading, has been extended to the last day of instruction for spring 2020; *June 4, 2020*.
* **Maximum P/NP unit exception** — Current Academic Senate policy ([**DDR A545.B**](https://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/bylaws-regulations/regulations#A545-)) states that no more than one-third of the units for graduation taken at UC Davis by an undergraduate student may be taken on a P/NP basis.
   * **Amendment to policy (effective immediately) —** The Academic Senate is exempting spring quarter 2020 units from this one-third calculation; spring units will not be calculated in the numerator (P/NP units taken) or the denominator (total units taken) of the one-third maximum.
   * The College of Letters and Science and the College of Engineering, which have stricter than one-third P/NP maximums, will likewise exempt spring 2020 units when calculating their college-specific P/NP unit caps.
* **These amendments do not override** additional college or major limitations on the use of P/NP courses for degree requirements. For example, some colleges require that all courses for majors be taken for a letter grade. Colleges are currently discussing if and how to adjust those letter-graded major requirements for spring 2020 and will communicate any such decisions to students."

UCDavis,fmlvsry,t3_fvyptb,1586194138.0,"Personally, I don't know that any undergraduate degree is worth $250K. Those are Harvard prices, without the Harvard product. 

In terms of the degree, there's really going to be no difference between the schools.

Other things to consider. PSU's alumni network is three times as large as UC Davis' network, and the school does a very deliberate job of trying to maintain connections with and among its graduates. It's also generally a more recognized name that UCD. Outside of California, few people have heard of UC Davis (except for the pepper spray incident); within California, Davis is generally regarded as a mid-tier UC school. The schools feel totally different as well: the undergraduate population at PSU is 50% larger than at Davis, and students don't leave town on the weekends as many students do at Davis. Even though State College is more isolated than Davis, State College is bustling, while Davis feels like a sleepy small town by comparison. There's also way more activity on campus at PSU than at Davis: student organizations, clubs, cultural events, etc. PSU is also, obviously, a huge sports school, if that matters to you.

Depending on where you're coming from, the cultural differneces may be more jarring in one place than another. Pennsylvania has a much more homogeneous population than California does, and while there is a significant international population there, you're less likely to find anything familiar outside of State College."

[https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC\_COMMUNITY\_job\_protection\_covid19\_040220.pdf](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC_COMMUNITY_job_protection_covid19_040220.pdf)

I believe the email was meant to put people's minds at ease, saying that even if things remain shut down through June, nobody will be laid off, even those people who have been sent home but can't perform their jobs remotely.

To be clear, the UC gets some--but not nearly all--of their funding from the state. Layoff criteria vary, depending on job title, whether the title is represented, etc."
