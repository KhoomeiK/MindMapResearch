I must also mention that I am only speaking for myself here; it's my personal opinion, not the paper's. But I digress.

What I want to talk about is the complete lack of respect for the Daily Bruin on this sub. I mean, seriously, what gives? Perhaps it's the comfort of anonymity that emboldens you all to talk the trash that you do but realize that it's honestly pathetic and sad that you're sitting there defending some idiotic block party that put people's safety and property in jeopardy; and then criticizing the only voice of reason throughout this whole fiasco. How about this? GROW UP. You people aren't in high school anymore. It's time that you take responsibility for your actions. The block party got way out of hand and you know it. I'm genuinely puzzled as to how such a ridiculous display of asininity could be seen as fun. You don't have anything better to do than trash your own neighborhood? Seriously, I feel sorry for you if this is your preferred form of entertainment.

I know a lot of you are too dense to realize that dumping trash onto the street and then walking away from it like it never happened will necessitate someone else picking it up for you, but it’s not cool and should never happen. Not only is not cool it’s egregious to the point that I’m embarrassed to be a UCLA student right now. People who heard about the block party were shocked when they learned UCLA students were acting like unsocialized, aggressive delinquents. And no, I'm not just talking about nearby wealthy residents. People from all over LA heard about the story, both this latest one and the one from January that prompted a broadcast on TV from CBS Los Angeles. Think about it, people: hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people throughout Southern California witnessed this lunacy on the street. Is this how you want people to view UCLA?? Do you not care about your school or its reputation? What about your own personal reputation?

Were some of you so pampered and privileged growing up that you can’t see the problem with this? If you weren't, what would your parents think about you acting like a bunch of clowns on the street?

I've been reading the comments in that thread and wow, the only thing I can say is they're absurd and outrageously ignorant. They are mind bogglinglyy dumb, hilariously nonsensical and immature. I honestly can't believe that students at one of the world's elite institutions are acting like a bunch of ninth graders after their first house party. Did a bunch of frat bros brigade this sub or something? What exactly is happening here? I only speculate that that's what's going on because I know there can't be such a large contingent of stupid people on here. It must be a concerted effort on the part of the people who organized last week's shitshow, which I believe is coming from those involved in Greek life. I just can't fathom how there could be another explanation in light of the the level of stupidity displayed here.

Do yourselves a favor and knock off the block party crap. It’s unfair to residents who want no part of it. It’s unfair to the firefighters and police who had to divert officers and resources to baby sit you on the street instead of focusing on crimes like the recent burglaries on the hill.

For those of you who don't like the paper or our stances on issues: nobody cares. We are supposed to challenge the status quo and the common narrative. You're not supposed to agree with everything, you dolts.

And finally, learn to respect your fellow students. I know you all think we at the DB are different from you, but guess what, we’re not. We’re students too. We like to party and have a good time like anyone else. But just because we don’t act like a bunch of middle schoolers, that doesn’t mean you have free pass to say whatever bullshit you want about us without a response. We’re not against parties. But we also don’t see the problem in calling out a horde of out-of-control wild animals like a lot of you were acting last week.

Do yourselves a favor, keep it indoors and off the street. This whole block party thing is so lame and overdone."

Def voting NO"
