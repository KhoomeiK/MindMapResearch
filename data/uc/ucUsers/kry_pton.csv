One thing I do know is that there are plenty of engineering clubs at UCSD with a very rigorous application process. SEDS for example have some pretty hard interviews while Formula SAE has a rigorous 4 week weeder program before you’re allowed to join the team."

paintball,fokzgn4,t1_fokupdn,1587851899.0,"Yes I do, I think what you linked would be perfect.

Regarding the regulated 100psi, I will just find whatever thread at the output of the regulator and I'll adapt to it to the 1/2"" tubing I will probably be using which will go into a small solenoid valve and maybe a check valve as well.

Also I noticed that with the schematic you linked, it goes directly from the ASA to the macroline fitting. How does that work, are their ASAs that have a 1/8 NPT outlet?"
paintball,fokryfo,t1_fokprf6,1587847800.0,"Thanks for the input!

As of now I will be using helium gas and not CO2. It is mass dependent, so as long as I can fit a certain ""amount"" of gas and can regulate it down to 100psi I am good.

Regarding sizing, I was thinking of using [this tank](https://www.ebay.com/itm/4-1oz-7ci-X-Short-Paintball-hp-System-200-bar-3000-Psi/113568438176?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D225086%26meid%3D4a411e5d272743f2a2498227bf6ffd07%26pid%3D100675%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D15%26mehot%3Dnone%26sd%3D113568438176%26itm%3D113568438176%26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2380057&_trksid=p2380057.c100675.m4236&_trkparms=pageci%3A6361c712-8735-11ea-af54-74dbd180e3a4%7Cparentrq%3Ab31479e21710a9e42a411f46ffcba4d8%7Ciid%3A1), removing the included regulator, somehow attaching a macroline and then an inline regulator. What do you think?

Edit: The only problem I have found this is finding an inline regulator that will accept 2000psi input pressure and output 100psi."
paintball,fokqqbw,t1_fokn807,1587847137.0,Whoah these regulators can go from 4500psi to 0psi. Maybe if I use it with something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W18LJB9/ref=sspa_dk_detail_3?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B07W18LJB9&pd_rd_w=7qLgJ&pf_rd_p=48d372c1-f7e1-4b8b-9d02-4bd86f5158c5&pd_rd_wg=lTruM&pf_rd_r=2W3W2AZZ28X46Y100M0C&pd_rd_r=822b3dd2-2ee3-4d26-ab6e-a4fa539f6cad&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExTFNDS1lDTTQySTdWJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDcyMzEzMkw5MlJFQjBQT1QwQSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTE3Nzk0OTBOQlJOQVJBU05LJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfZGV0YWlsJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==#customerReviews) I can use it with a regular paintball tank without its included regulator. If somehow I can have this set up be inline and not attached to the tank that would fix the height problem. I know there is something called macro fittings which I will look more into.
paintball,foknqvw,t1_fokmnlr,1587845524.0,"I'll definitely look into possibly using CO2 as our gas but as of right now, we're planning on using Helium. So whatever tank we'll use, we will fill it with helium at our desired pressure.

I just ran my program. If these cartridges are refillable and with their volume in mind, I would need it to be at 13,000 psi, which I don't know if it will be able to withstand."
paintball,fokm4nz,t1_fokk86h,1587844639.0,"From some quick research, the ASA is for interfacing with the tank and turning it on and off. 

How would I then regulate the 800 psi to 100 psi?"
paintball,foklzef,t1_fokl8ug,1587844559.0,">16g threaded co2 cartridge

Ok thanks I'll give them a call see if they pick up especially with the lockdown. 

I would need the tank to be refillable and able to withstand a very high pressure.(especially if it's that small the pressure I need will likely be over 10,000psi). Sorry I didn't make that clear."
