berkeley,fp3hayu,t1_fp3c64j,1588279296.0,"[“Science” does not dictate our coronavirus response](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/29/science-coronavirus-223213). Science does not answer the moral question of how many lives should be lost to the virus vs how much human suffering should we cause from the lockdown. All science does is tell us, to the best of its ability, how the virus will spread and what it’s effects will be. The rest is expressly up to the politicians."
PoliticalDiscussion,fp0d9rj,t1_fp0bbor,1588207041.0,"That’s a good question. Personally, probably a 6 or 7. There were mistakes made, especially at the beginning: Trump should not have downplayed the virus as much as he did (even though the Democrats and media were complicit in that as well - remember Pelosi telling people to go to Chinatown?). I think Trump downplayed the virus because he was afraid of its effect on the economy, and because he thought that the Democrats and media were manufacturing yet another crisis with which to bludgeon him, but his inability to see past that is a failure on him.

On the other hand, since approximately mid-March, I think the Administration’s response has been mostly very good. They’ve placed competent public health officials (Anthony Fauci, Deborah Birx, Jerome Adams) at the front of the response, they’ve ramped up testing so that we are now performing the highest numbers of tests in the world (though still not nearly enough), and they’ve slashed red tape to accelerate the development of new drugs - check out Gilead’s new announcements about remdesivir today. Of course, let’s not forget the landmark CARES Act, which included the $1200 direct payments which were an idea directly from the Administration. Since then, I think most of Trump’s failures have been on messaging, not on governance. Even though the media dramatically misrepresented his disinfectant comments last week (he was musing in front of a camera about treatments he half-remembered, not telling people to literally shoot up bleach), I think it was still a dumb thing to do.

So, overall, 6 or 7. For reference, I’d probably put Germany at an 8, South Korea at a 9, no one at 10, the UK at 5, Italy and Spain at 3 or 4. I think I’d probably put a hypothetical Democratic president’s response at about the same, since I think a Democrat’s response would follow mostly the same contours as Trump’s. I think the Democrat would probably be worse at governance, especially with passing a CARES Act type bill (remember how Democrats wanted to tie the airline bailout to carbon emissions?) or FDA regulation slashing, but probably better at messaging than Trump.

How would you rank America’s response?"
PoliticalDiscussion,fp0ai41,t1_fozu1e1,1588205541.0,"As I posted above, here is a link from the BBC showing that [America’s per-capita death rate is well below most of Europe’s](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52415579). I find your article incredibly speculative, and very difficult to believe. I do not believe there is a realistic scenario where our per capita death rate is 50 to 100 times lower than that if Europe, and I think you’re setting an unrealistic standard for Trump just so you can look and him and say “See! He screwed up!”, even though the data shows the opposite."
PoliticalDiscussion,fozpo7l,t1_fozpgi5,1588194684.0,"This is a global pandemic, and our response is better than most of the world’s. How is this Trump’s fault? Where has he gone wrong if our death rate is lower than almost every other country, besides a few in East Asia?"
PoliticalDiscussion,foznqvi,t1_fozn3hf,1588193735.0,"How can you say that his response has been a failure when we are doing better than most of the developed world? If anything, the evidence shows that empowering local officials to take action in their own communities is more effective than a one-size-fits-all approach, not less. To say that Trump’s corona response has been the “biggest failure of his presidency” is a statement that is simply not backed by the numbers."
PoliticalDiscussion,fozlygh,t1_fozl6fy,1588192878.0,"And yet, Democrat-run urbanized states like New York and New Jersey are doing [far worse] (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#states) than Republican-run urbanized states like Texas, Georgia, Florida or Ohio. That would seem to go against your theory that Democratic leadership would have made us fare better."

PoliticalDiscussion,foz3nu6,t1_foyaivf,1588184138.0,"This is the sort of political tribalism that gets us nowhere. It’s absurd to believe that a Democrat could have prevented 90% of the deaths from coronavirus. Frankly, despite all the media posturing to the contrary, the US’s coronavirus response has actually been pretty robust, and is in line with or better than most of Europe. On a per-capita basis, the death toll here is better than in [the UK, France, Belgium, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52415579). Sure, Singapore and Taiwan have handled this better than we have, but I find it difficult to believe that a Democratic president could have waved a magic wand and made us perform like an small East Asian country rather than like our peer countries in the EU.

Besides that, all the things you’ve said against Trump are... conservative policy victories. Conservatives generally don’t like ineffective multilateralism to virtue signal for progressive priorities. Most conservatives besides Trump would also have pulled out of the JCPOA or Paris Accords.

Trump’s tough approach on China has forged a [new bipartisan consensus](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/03/04/the-china-debate-is-here-to-stay/) in Washington to be more aggressive in confronting them. Even [Biden is tough on China](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/23/biden-ad-exposes-left-rift-china-202241) now. Reorienting America’s position towards China is one of the enduring victories of the Trump presidency, regardless of whether he wins or loses in 2020. I can’t believe that you hate Trump so much that you’re defending the CPC.

[Many experts](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/opinion/trump-kim-north-korea-summit.html) hailed Trump’s decision to meet with Kim. While the follow-through has been underwhelming, we’ve still seen repatriation of the remains of Korean War servicemen, the dismantling of their nuclear test site, a moratorium on ICBM tests through the end of 2019, and a general thaw in relations on the peninsula. If this was a Democratic president, I bet you would consider this sufficient.

Overall, I recommend that you be relentlessly critical of all media that you consume, especially with regards to coronavirus. The media would have you believe that Trump uniquely bungled the coronavirus response, and that is simply not the case."
