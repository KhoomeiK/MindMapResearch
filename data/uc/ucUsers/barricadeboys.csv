sadcringe,fpjc8ut,t1_fpjb0i7,1588663312.0,Textbook bully...
sadcringe,fpj8upi,t1_fpiwbdc,1588660128.0,Everything about this hurts. He's so rude but I feel so sorry for him.
trashpandas,fpeb14g,t3_gcx9zu,1588543934.0,I too love his sock monkey. And him.
SelfAwarewolves,fpdc927,t1_fpda6ya,1588524144.0,"Exactly.  My friend is so pro-gun it seems almost like a moral issue to him the way abortion is for many people. It overshadows any other policy consideration. I honestly think he believes it is a life-or-death political struggle, but where ""life"" and ""guns"" are on the same side."
wlw_irl,fpdbeey,t1_fpda2x1,1588523659.0,Yeah I get the sense most gold star lesbians haven't succeeded in having many relationships and are bitter... With a toxic attitude like that though it's kind of a self fulfilling prophecy imho
orangeisthenewblack,fp4qdah,t3_gbacsh,1588304815.0,"I loved the riot personally, but I think it's just a big content shift from the rest of the show.  Up to that point it seemed more ""slice of life"" with season arcs but less of a dominant central plot.   If you become accustomed to the show being a certain way I guess I can see why people would be salty about it since it went from ""this is how prison may be for people"" to a much rarer kind of story."
toptalent,fp38i2d,t1_fp2i5uw,1588274931.0,This certainly is humbling... I can't imagine the kind of dexterity this must require.
politics,foxey5d,t1_fox7ct6,1588141935.0,It doesn't. OP clearly didn't read the article and is stating misinformed conjecture as fact.
blackpeoplegifs,forhouh,t1_forartg,1588012412.0,Both an impressive father and an impressive memory...
blackpeoplegifs,foo6hjp,t3_g8k0jk,1587933445.0,I wonder if it's a skill that switches on automatically upon becoming a parent or one that is gradually developed over time
BeAmazed,foo6274,t1_foo5fh6,1587933206.0,"I'd like to think the response was meant literally, like fragile as in easily hurt by the sun.  Don't think anyone could reasonably think your comment is racist,but I guess it could be a misunderstanding."
DidThisLastNight,fonm6i5,t3_g8fmh0,1587922160.0,"Well I'm going to have nightmares, thanks OP"
notdisneyvacation,foiwujz,t3_g7lzax,1587799729.0,I cannot even fathom how this fit into context... Or why this even needed to be illustrated.
madlads,foetvt3,t1_foemf0u,1587714589.0,"That did not occur to me, and now it's ruined. Thanks for that unfortunate dose of reality OP"
SampleSize,fo020nt,t3_g4v7lb,1587404693.0,Wow wasn't expecting an existential crisis at this time...
chadsriseup,fnwgqfa,t1_fnwdg5v,1587318062.0,This sub's evil counterpart...
u_GovSchwarzenegger,fnnn4e4,t3_g2tpq4,1587096344.0,I see you're making the most of shelter in place!
ATBGE,fngfyqj,t1_fnftc0j,1586931025.0,And of course it's from Texas...
lewronggeneration,fneg0w6,t1_fne7c7k,1586888713.0,The edit put it over the edge imho. Definitely satire.
politics,fnbb72p,t1_fnb9gi2,1586812442.0,This is a really interesting metaphor.  I've always thought that Bernie is most effective as an activist. Hopefully his influence will continue in that vein even with a different president.
PenguinOfTheMonth,fnb3yj5,t3_g0p2dz,1586808799.0,Excellent penguins 10/10
happycryingdads,fnaqgd6,t3_g0oa13,1586802015.0,I love success stories like this!  You can tell that this is such an important relationship to both of them.
relationship_advice,fn3zn89,t1_fn3g8zl,1586631080.0,"Absolutely, this seems like a brutal situation for everyone but acknowledging her shows serious emotional maturity.  Hopefully she either won't bring it up or won't make a big deal about it to your ex but honestly that's not on you.  I don't see how this could be interpreted as being about him."
UCSantaBarbara,fn3ytv1,t3_fzccd6,1586630615.0,"It is just so sad that students are having to resort to these measures.  I am vehemently anti-cheating but the temptation is always there, especially when it is so hard to keep up with the workload."
UCSantaBarbara,fn2gfb8,t1_fn1s3s6,1586588098.0,It's seasonal. Kind of an endless project... Hopefully soon some of the less successful natives will be established enough to put up a fight.
UCSantaBarbara,fn1bleo,t1_fn18b6f,1586558660.0,"Yeah unfortunately, it's a serious problem at the lagoon and around Manzanita Village"
UCSantaBarbara,fn11uby,t3_fylmq2,1586553110.0,"Pre-covid I was actually employed by the school to weed out that oxalis, since I work for the restoration center.  This photo is taunting me..."
wholesomegifs,fn0bou1,t1_fn04fjl,1586539001.0,Didn't think about it that way... honestly wouldn't surprise me but either way it is adorable.
news,fmt956p,t1_fmt78na,1586368853.0,"I don't think Warren supporters necessary go Bernie, a lot of them went Biden."
NoStupidQuestions,fmt7ia5,t1_fmt5g8a,1586368100.0,"Wow that's an excellent video, definitely will be trying that!"
badwomensanatomy,fmietj8,t1_fmhkozq,1586108156.0,"Wow, it is! Congrats on educating that dude."
