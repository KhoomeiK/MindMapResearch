berkeley,fpkxzjv,t1_fpkuh6c,1588702984.0,"yeah! honestly, CNR is really nice. i love my advisor and the resources are truly great. i am not planning on going to med school, so i want the major i’m in right now to reflect what i want to pursue in grad school, since that’s my current plan. i never really wanted to be in CNR because i’m more interested in human science more so than an environmental aspect, which is what CNR focuses on. i’m currently in genetics and plant biology, but i’m more interested in human genetics and the grad school programs i might be interested in seem to favor me being in that major. but, that being said, the lab position i have focuses on plant genetic engineering lol, but i still do find it interesting and the experience is invaluable."
berkeley,fpku066,t3_gdqbf1,1588701012.0,"i am a freshman with a synthetic biology lab position and i am in CNR, switching into L&S. you just really have to keep your eyes out and apply as soon as you see something, also cold email and reach out to everyone! sorry i know that’s not super helpful, but there is definitely luck involved.  also like the first commenter said, major doesn’t really matter as long as you know what you want. always be on the lookout for positions and getting in touch with people in the field shows major interest and drive. don’t stress too much, if you’re already thinking about this, you’ve got the determination to make it happen."

Also, we are in a pandemic and everyone is going through enough as it is...can we just maybe be kind to each other?? And let each other live...literally?? GOD. I am so saddened. Be nice to others right now and ALWAYS <3

I desperately wish there was something we could do, even just having a donation page or something. I wish I could help in some way, but I feel a little helpless. His family needs extra love right now and I wish I could give it.

If anyone knows of anything, message me please <3"

biology,flwcf61,t3_frkmam,1585545959.0,"what I’ve gathered: more testing = more cases found. more tests are being administered in new locations which means they are finding more cases that have been unidentified for a while. also, since many people are asymptomatic, they think they are healthy and have unknowingly passed it on to people who then don’t see symptoms for two weeks. then these people may have unknowingly passed it on to someone during that two weeks, or maybe they are asymptomatic too and will eventually pass it to someone else. 

tldr; more testing in more locations, two week incubation period, asymptomatic individuals being careless."
