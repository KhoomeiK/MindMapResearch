ucla,fox55wr,t1_fox4gcx,1588134329.0,"The way they put it was kinda weird. My interpretation is that it will (for sure) be possible to take a full course-load without ever stepping foot on campus, but they didn't clarify whether in-person and online classes will be taught separately. 

So I'm not sure if it would be possible to say only go to class once a week and watch online the rest of the time. Tbh I don't think they know either"
ucla,fowssbw,t3_ga0ngt,1588126372.0,"TLDR:

- A ""Future Planning Task Force"" has been established to ""explore and submit [policy] recommendations"" that the university is guaranteed to ignore. We won't hear about it again until five years from now when we find out it's been eating up millions of tuition dollars.

- UCLA plans to offer the **option** of remote learning in the fall even if some classes are held in person. Summer Session A is online. Summer Session C/Fall Quarter TBD but don't get your hopes up.

- Fuck you, we aren't refunding or even reducing tuition now or at any point in the future.

- Housing is no longer guaranteed for the 2020-21 academic year. ""If we are unable to fulfill housing requests, we plan to offer remote learning as an alternative."" More info to come."

baseball,fmrskta,t1_fmrmomk,1586333936.0,"I guess because I wanted to let people know where the fields were without making the title of the post cumbersome. I'd say that the main point of the post is to showcase a cool looking sports complex and the location is a minor, secondary detail. In other words, you don't need to know where Lake Elsinore is to appreciate the post. I certainly don't expect anyone to know where Lake Elsinore is nor do I expect them to care; I just thought I'd include it to give context to the post for those who do know the area as well as those who are curious and want to look further into it. Certainly there's enough detail for someone to find it who wants to--just google 'rosetta canyon sports park lake elsinore'. I understand what you're saying though, I'm not even from Lake Elsinore myself."
baseball,fmrm0lz,t1_fmr3woa,1586327404.0,"Not sure if this is a joke, but it’s about halfway between San Diego and LA, about 20 miles inland."
baseball,fmo5lxp,t1_fmnwbsh,1586246234.0,It’s a bit less than that—just restrooms and a convertible snack shack/storage area. It’s a bit elevated relative to the fields and there’s seating on the roof from where you can see all five fields which is pretty cool.
baseball,fmmxa98,t1_fmmjab4,1586213846.0,"The backstops are decently high, and it's softball so foul balls don't travel as far, but most everyone stays under the shade structures for that reason--we've had some close calls in the past. The fields are also identified by the color, so Blue Field, Red Field, etc."
ucla,flomw5q,t3_fq4hj1,1585341392.0,"Student life at UCLA is infinitely better. The city of Berkeley is not pleasant and can’t hold a candle to Westwood, and the housing (keep in mind, you’ll literally be \*living\* at wherever you choose) is terrible. Berkeley barely guarantees one year of university housing (not even on campus) with minimal food plan options while here most 2nd and many 3rd years come back voluntarily."
