Athleanx,fownt5w,t1_fowmtgw,1588123477.0,From what I understand it’s a pay once and have forever kinda thing. Idk what happens if it is deleted off your phone but I switched phones and still had the paid version
Athleanx,fowmguc,t3_g9zfqo,1588122693.0,Honestly I’ve been using it for 6 months and think it’s for sure worth it. Great way to diversify workouts and just do something whenever

AskSF,folj47b,t1_fol6s0f,1587863334.0,"Thank you! I’ll check them out! Though I did live in the Bay Area before just in the peninsula. I was somewhat familiar with the city but like you said, always learning and seeing new stuff"
AskSF,fol2taw,t3_g809yc,1587853772.0,Just moved into the city and love to run so I’ve been exploring quite a bit. Was running along the Embarcadero then I was like hey ima go to Coit tower which was an amazing and rewarding run despite the endless amount of stairs. On the way I ran through Levi park which I thought was gorgeous

armenia,fmrovmz,t3_fwx7za,1586330130.0,"I love your videos! If you’d do go back in the summer I highly recommend being there during Vardavar https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardavar
It’s a holiday/tradition that has stayed in the culture since our polytheistic days and it’s pretty much a huge water fight everywhere for the day. It’s an amazing experience especially in Yerevan. I’m so happy you enjoyed your trip!"
armenian,fmki01m,t3_fviku8,1586155606.0,The fact that you took the time to come here shows you really seem to care so that made me smile. It doesn’t seem like she’s rushing into she just wanted to make her goals and where she sees herself in the future clear so you should be good taking things slowly and making sure you guys really like each other. Like others have said every Armenian family is different but traditional families are very welcoming and also protective. It’s not a bad idea to bring like flowers or alcohol if you are invited to their home. Good luck and just try to be genuine!
