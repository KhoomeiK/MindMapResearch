UCSD,fpdhqq4,t1_fpc402d,1588527222.0,"I've had a pretty positive experience with CS here so far. Most of my professors have been extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what they teach. Just prepare for an endless stream of Pokemon-related teaching material. The lecture halls are pretty crowded, but I feel like that's a given for any major at our school. Like people have said, it will be more difficult to get tutor help if you wait until the very last minute (as I have done), but the tutors will give you ample guidance if you start even slightly earlier! They've saved my ass on multiple occasions. And I started late then, too. Also, I'm going against OP's post here, but I've found it pretty easy to make friends within my major! Some of the most talented and social people I know are CS or math CS. 

Our program has a strong reputation for a reason! Don't let the negatives discourage you."
