AskReddit,fpl9iyj,t1_fpk0ohd,1588708746.0,"One time I showed up for a doctor’s appointment and they said I didn’t have one. I was like, “What?” And I showed them the appointment card. They asked if I lived in X city, yes I did. On X street? No. With X phone number? No. Turns out another person with my same name and spelling lived in the same city and had the same doctor. They found my appointment then. Lol"

InlandEmpire,fpeugxj,t1_fpen67o,1588555192.0,"Yeah, you aren’t smarter than everybody. And that’s okay, but it doesn’t give you the right to think you are smarter than anyone. Yes, I do think it takes more intelligence than high school science class to understand the data, which, mind you, you aren’t actually privy to other than some tiny morsels the media may print."
InlandEmpire,fpegoq4,t1_fpecnkw,1588547198.0,"So, you passed all the AP and Honors classes you took in high school? You have a MD or PhD in some medical field or pandemic history? Why do you think you’re smarter than the people taking this seriously?"
InlandEmpire,fp8hr4n,t1_fp78sn4,1588392621.0,"Yes, it is racist to insist on calling it that and even more so racist to not understand the world in 1918. I don’t know anyone who actually got mad Trump stopped flights from China aside from the folks annoyed he let Americans return from China potentially bringing the virus into the country. It’s not political to look at lessons learned from the 1918 Flu Pandemic and use current science to make decisions."

If they can make it through that, our kids can make it through staying safe at home. To be honest, I was shocked at their stories because I would have thought they’d be much further behind academically than they are. They had no school for years. We have internet options."

If you are a landlord, your mortgage is paused so you don’t have to pay it and your renters shouldn’t either. There are solutions if the government would take “we the people” into account."
CoronavirusCA,fo63rs7,t1_fo5hil9,1587545410.0,"Yup. Suspend mortgages and rents, freeze interest on credit cards/loans, give a UBI that covers essentials and all these small businesses can open up when it is safe for us to go there."
