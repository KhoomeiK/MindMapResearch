After those labs, lab 4-9 are definitely harder, and took me a couple hours a day throughout the week he assigns it. Though don’t focus too much on how long each project takes as it differs through each student depending on how much you understand the material. I took cse13e with another programming class and a physics class with a lab and it wasn’t too bad you just have to manage your time wisely. No exams or midterms but every week he gave an online exam that you have to complete within ten minutes. Quizzes are usually based off of his powerpoints slides or his readings (he did this only for the first week). I definitely admit to slacking here and there but like I said it was doable. You got this!"
UCSC,fnxfex0,t3_g4ge0u,1587337508.0,"Hi! I recently took Cse13e during winter quarter and my only knowledge prior was python and assembly. To be completely honest it was completely doable as long as you input the time and effort, go to section if you need help starting/etc. I don’t think the coding part is the hard part, I think the hardest part is understanding each project and starting it. If you have some knowledge in computer science that will definitely help. Also, do not worry too much as he will give some pseudo code in the first few projects, and all you have to do is code it which he will explain each lab every week and same for the TA’s. Remember to keep up with deadlines and try to do the extra credits because they will help you in the future. The difficulty of the labs increases each week, but the hardest ones are the toaster oven and the battleship (you can have a partner for this lab). Also he gives you abt 72hrs of late hours which is really convenient. This class it not too bad if you put in time and effort. Just work hard and never start labs too late because you won’t have enough time to finish unless you pull an all nighter. Best of luck to you!"
