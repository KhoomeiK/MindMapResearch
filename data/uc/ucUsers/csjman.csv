UCI,fp73v1h,t1_fp6vfkk,1588363563.0,"I agree. What is even more disappointing is that this class has always been online, even before the pandemic— so this professor really just doesn’t give a shit."
UCI,fp73u07,t3_gbnsbp,1588363548.0,This class needs to be reported to the dean.
cscareerquestions,fokbrov,t1_fokb514,1587839112.0,"I’ve never met anyone that had a similar experience as me, but it’s awesome to finally find someone! I was actually in elementary school when my server blew up, was paying $400/month for a monstrous dedicated windows server with my mom’s Paypal account. Definitely surreal."
UCI,fok11gp,t3_g7untr,1587833367.0,"Hang in there, you’re definitely not alone— many of us are feeling this way."
cscareerquestions,fok0qnz,t1_fojytl4,1587833201.0,Same man. I ended up hosting a runescape private server when I was 11-12 that ended up becoming massively popular on the online communities runelocus and rune-server.... good ole days
cscareerquestions,fok0kkc,t1_fojuvo6,1587833107.0,"I also got into computer science/programming because of runescape as well! I transitioned to private servers written in Java though, was a great introduction for a 12 year old."
cscareerquestions,fo52lys,t1_fo4m9kq,1587516168.0,"Basically once I was referred their University Recruiter emailed me and set up a call, asked me what year I was, after I told her I was a junior she told me the pay rate for juniors and asked a few more legal questions regarding my employment eligibility.. took a few weeks to get the actual offer letter but there was no technical or even soft skill interview."
cscareerquestions,fo41yoq,t1_fo3qczg,1587496815.0,I second this. My first internship interview in southern california asked me FizzBuzz as well. Second internship at a Fortune 500 company didn’t even interview me because a previous manager at my first internship referred me.
UCI,flevwaf,t1_flelroz,1585092589.0,I heard last year the FBI was also doing investigations... didn’t know the faculty were involved.
