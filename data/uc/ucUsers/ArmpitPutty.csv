AskReddit,fnv4io5,t1_fnv41nq,1587279981.0,"Jesus christ dude, you're bananas. I have some implicit deep-seated hatred for obese people because I said that it's not appropriate to create a presentation about banning obese people from school?

No, dude. These things aren't appropriate because despite what you're saying in your multiple long-winded monologues, there ARE people who discriminate against people based on things like gender and weight. You literally just said it when you accused me of being one of those people, lmfao. Regardless of *your* intent, these people exist. 

Don't bother with another six-paragraph reply, I'm done. You're nuts."
AskReddit,fnv21ui,t1_fnulyn3,1587277699.0,"Propaganda in a historical context is different than literally creating and peddling hateful propaganda in school, lmfao. I can understand a 14 year old kid not understanding this, but how are you still not able to see that?"

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fnancgq,t1_fna5va6,1586800469.0,"Really? You can’t even understand it?

Boomers were raised in a society where socialism and communism were the enemies. They were comic book supervillain bad. They were portrayed as so stupid and so evil that it wasn’t even worth the time to try to understand them. It wasn’t just people’s opinion, this was taught as fact in their schools.

It would be the equivalent of millennials/Gen Z growing up and their grandchildren insisting that fascism is actually the clearest path forward, and that we simply don’t understand it.

Obviously, socialism ISN’T the great evil that the U.S. government portrayed it as, and I’m not trying to say that boomers are right or that it’s in any way comparable to fascism. But if you want to understand why older Americans are so reluctant to vote for a self-identified democratic socialist, you have to understand what socialism means to somebody raised during the Cold War."
