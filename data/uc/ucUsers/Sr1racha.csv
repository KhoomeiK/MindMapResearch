kpop,foiqisn,t3_g7mnwv,1587793814.0,[Wrong Number - TVXQ!](https://youtu.be/rwagNDrh1DA). I think this song deserves a lot more covers - because no well known groups have done one yet ;_____:
fountainpens,fofwxzz,t1_fofvi1n,1587744261.0,I've used Ku-jaku almost exclusively in mine since I got it.
fountainpens,fofv9ai,t3_g78t1u,1587743425.0,"In my opinion, Pilot's most underrated pen - mine has a MF nib and is a fantastic writer, and one of my go to ""workhorse"" pens. Enjoy yours!"
fountainpens,fo81psv,t1_fo80vi5,1587588346.0,"This is a wet and smooth medium 14C nib, found on mid 1970s - 1980s 149s. I believe this 149 was made prior to 1985."
fountainpens,fo80gyx,t1_fo7pjgy,1587587717.0,"Every time I pick up this pen to write with, I feel like a rich 1980s corporate executive."
fountainpens,fo5wjjl,t1_fo5han6,1587538028.0,Syrah has to be one of my favorite red inks ever. It's the perfect shade of wine red that is so pleasing to write with and look at.

UCSantaBarbara,fny4a1m,t3_g4iasb,1587353052.0,Do people not call it FT anymore? Last time I checked before I graduated 5 years ago everyone still called it FT.
fountainpens,fnq79op,t1_fnpqzxe,1587159036.0,"Its section always reminds me of the Michelin man. However, I do agree it is nice and I want one, but there are way too many other pens I'd buy first in that price range ($250-$500) before the Imporium."
fountainpens,fnq6ekp,t3_g32mr0,1587158557.0,"Pen related thoughts floating around my mind lately:

- Sometimes I wonder who the previous owners of my vintage pens were and what they used them for. I'd like to think that they would be happy to see their pens still used in good hands.

- I've learned that I'm comfortable with almost any size pen from a Liliput to a Namiki Emperor.

- How the heck did Parker approve Superchrome for release if they were aware of the horrible things it did to pens, even the nearly infallible ""eats any ink for breakfast"" aerometric 51?"
knifeclub,fnq5k47,t3_g38vig,1587158093.0,"Excellent purchase! I've always wanted the Wilson Combat version of this knife.

Also, this quarantine has definitely not been helping out my wallet either this month when it comes to all the things I collect."

fountainpens,fmt7l7k,t3_fxafjg,1586368139.0,"My Franklin Christoph Model 03 has a steel Masuyama medium stub nib.

For the extra $25 over a regular FC steel nib, the pen gets into typical ""gold nib territory"" prices, but it's the best stub nib I've ever written with, and one of the most perfectly adjusted and ground nibs out of the box. Also, Franklin Christoph is known for their excellent steel nibs in general as they tune and check each one before it gets sent out."
fountainpens,fmt5wna,t1_fmt2dgq,1586367373.0,"Japan Post tracking says the Custom 845 is still in Japan. As for the Sailor, I have no idea since I got it through Amazon and the order summary says it was ""shipped""."
fountainpens,fmt5edb,t1_fmt0svh,1586367139.0,"It's great - it was perfect out of the box and didn't need any adjustment, unlike some other cheap stubs I've tried."
fountainpens,fmsxeof,t3_fx8kgo,1586363496.0,"I have the same Al-Star with a 1.5mm stub. One of the first pens I ever got and still in use! I think I'll need a bigger notebook for taking lecture notes with it, though."

fountainpens,fm9kdlr,t1_fm8usiy,1585870523.0,"Your ink shouldn't be a problem at all, it's very likely your paper.

I love Maruman Mnemosyne spiral notebooks, they come in a variety of sizes and have little bleedthrough or ghosting with fountain pen inks."
