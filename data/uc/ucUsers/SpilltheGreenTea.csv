ucla,foxi3i1,t1_foxgmdh,1588144681.0,Your experience puts this all into context and you make a really good point. Thank you for sharing this advice

memes,fougsqw,t1_fotnjp5,1588083792.0,That‚Äôs good. I wish grocery store workers and package delivery people had a similar pay increase
ucla,fotkfcw,t1_fotjaiz,1588056685.0,I feel you! Im not super comfortable with the idea that the professor and TA have access to a recording of my room and for some people it can reveal more about their SES than they are comfortable with. I wish profs trusted us more

ucla,fog9ugk,t3_g72yes,1587749830.0,"I really hope they do bc UC Berkeley, Stanford, Columbia, Barnard, Dartmouth, Smith and MIT all have mandatory pass no pass so it‚Äôs messed up that we don‚Äôt have that.

PresidentialRaceMemes,fnv7dlt,t3_g35kcj,1587282792.0,fuck Obama but I'd be pissed if he endorsed earlier in the primaries.
PresidentialRaceMemes,fnv70ph,t1_fnv6okn,1587282433.0,ah the neoliberal go-to defense
PresidentialRaceMemes,fnv6t21,t1_fnv4xlo,1587282220.0,"I think this is the main point: Bernie had to suspend his campaign immediately when he saw the terrible situation in Wisconsin and the Biden people continuing GOTV when Bernie's campaign stopped pushing GOTV mid-late March. He personally did not want to put lives in danger because of his decisions or lack thereof. At that point, I wish he had acknowledged the sexual assault at some point but I get why he didn't, he didn't want to make it harder on his supporters when he eventually endorsed Joe Biden. No one wants to acknowledge endorsing an accused  rapist."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fnv63ra,t1_fnu3uhy,1587281534.0,"Part of Bernie's platform was working to end sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. It's part of the reason why I voted for him, his clean record on sexual misconduct. It's sad that he had to compromise his personal values on this issue by endorsing Joe Biden but I understand it."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fnuchw1,t1_fnu67aq,1587259098.0,"Per my comment, I live in California and my vote is effectively worthless there. I could vote for Trump, Howie Hawkins or write in my mother and it doesn‚Äôt change the facts that California‚Äôs electoral votes will go to Joe Biden. But by all means, continue to tell me that I‚Äôm going to help Trump win the election."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fnu1i12,t1_fnswdr8,1587252721.0,Yeah I get it; I'd have done the same. But it sucks that he had to
PresidentialRaceMemes,fnu1fds,t1_fntf8e9,1587252679.0,Yeah I get it; I'd do that same. But its still rough
PresidentialRaceMemes,fnu1bbx,t1_fnth1pb,1587252616.0,No because I didn't know Joe Biden would later be accused to sexual assault. That's the only reason I'm not voting for him (I live in CA). I get Bernie's decision; I'd have done the same. But its still rough

VoteBlue,fnlikdp,t1_fnlhimg,1587054162.0,"We can‚Äôt discount the voices of 47% of the voters who voted for McSally, that‚Äôs not really fair. They voted for a candidate, who then lost. Additionally, a lot of people probably voted for Sinema bc of the D, she‚Äôs fairly centrist."

ucla,fmtupd8,t3_fx781s,1586379332.0,"I'd say it's not too hard, when I took it last spring, it was very similar to the practice exams and the study questions she puts out. print out the notes if you can (its easier to flip through physical notes than to scroll through a pdf) and try to understand generally whats going on. Also FIND OTHER PEOPLE TO TAKE IT WITH!! it's going to be very helpful to bounce things off of others. DM me if you want my old exams"
