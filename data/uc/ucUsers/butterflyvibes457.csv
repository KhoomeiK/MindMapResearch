stimuluscheck,fp1t84k,t1_fp04ewf,1588247101.0,Congrats!

UCI,fp1kgnr,t3_garypc,1588238598.0,"Hell yes I would pick UCI again.  I had the best 4 years of my life.  I got to dorm, make new friends, learn, participate in extracurriculars I never thought I‚Äôd ever be a part of, and overall got the ultimate college experience.  

The campus is BEAUTIFUL.  The park is beautiful with its trees, green scenery, and the sounds of birds chirping every morning.  And it‚Äôs a great place to take a nap in between classes lol.

Education wise, I would say improvements can always be made, but that goes for every institution.  Professors are hit or miss but for the most part, I felt like I got quality education.  

Financially speaking, UCI broke my wallet.  It‚Äôs expensive if financial aid doesn‚Äôt completely cover you and there‚Äôs these small fees that add up every quarter as well.  But looking back, I don‚Äôt regret my experiences.  

Not so big on the party scene but I still had my fair share of partying there.  It really depends on the connections that you make as well.

And there‚Äôs PLENTY of opportunity to get involved on campus.  Look out for club fairs and posters that are taped on the bridge between Humanities Hall and The Student Center.  I would also follow the UCI Jobs and Internships Facebook page and the UCI Facebook groups as many opportunities are posted there as well.  

Overall, I miss UCI.  I miss college so much.  I miss the park, I miss the student center Starbucks, I miss studying in the libraries, and I miss going to lecture.  If you go to UCI, or are thinking about going to UCI, definitely enjoy the experience because 4 years will fly by fast.  

It honestly sucks that the class of 2020 won‚Äôt get the closure that normal seniors would get.  Grad photos, senior activities, commencement, and all the fun stuff that you get to do when you‚Äôre close to finishing out the quarter."

These checks were sent out as rebates to taxpayers.  Somewhat similar to the stimulus that we‚Äôre receiving now but the whole point of it was to provide relief and help stimulate the economy when it dipped in 2001.  Which was why I referred to it as, a stimulus *gasp*.  

Thank you for bringing up the topic of my age by the way.  I‚Äôm old enough to remember receiving checks in my household.  Goodnight, boomer."
stimuluscheck,fp1d9rj,t1_fp1d6de,1588231691.0,"Yes there was.  A one time check was distributed to taxpayers because of how things went down after 9/11.  Many people were laid off, similarly to how things are now though the cause is obviously for different reasons."
stimuluscheck,fp1cplk,t1_fp1bbct,1588231182.0,So basically it depends on your bank lol
stimuluscheck,fp1ckkn,t1_fp1cb4k,1588231056.0,Yes there was a stimulus in 2009 as well.  And a stimulus when 9/11 happened.  BOTH made economic impacts which was why a stimulus was distributed in BOTH situations.

stimuluscheck,fp08yc8,t1_fp08rfx,1588204713.0,I‚Äôve heard of cases where ppl didn‚Äôt get their deposits til 5:00-5:30 pm.  So it really does depend on your bank!  At this point you‚Äôre already deemed eligible and will receive the check.  It‚Äôs a matter of when the bank will post it for you!
stimuluscheck,fp07ndj,t1_fp07hza,1588204009.0,It‚Äôs cool!  Oh I‚Äôve heard of cases were ppl can see pending payments with their banks.  Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to see that with my Bank (Chase).
stimuluscheck,fp03wno,t1_fp03p94,1588202009.0,"I understand the anxiety.  Trust me.  What I can tell you that it really depends on your bank.  I bank with Chase.

I honestly was scared I wasn‚Äôt going to get one because I had friends who checked off ‚Äúcan be claimed as dependent‚Äù on their taxes.  Apparently if you check off that box, you won‚Äôt be eligible.  So I double checked my taxes and it wasn‚Äôt checked off so I was like OK SO I SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE."

stimuluscheck,fozxemm,t1_foztet1,1588198574.0,"So on the 15th, I was expecting a stimulus.  My parents and my friends got theirs.  EXCEPT FOR MOI.  So for days I was checking my status.  It would say: ‚Äúwe cannot determine your eligibility at this time‚Äù aka Payment Status not available.  So I checked last Friday, the 24th, because my friend told me IRS was making updates.  Finally it said ‚Äúyou are eligible and will be receiving funds to your bank account (then if lists the last 4 digits of my account #).  Then the next day I checked and it gave me a date of the 29th.  I woke up this morning around 8AM and my stimulus came in (I‚Äôm with Chase)."
stimuluscheck,fozwz20,t1_fozlqb0,1588198350.0,"I don‚Äôt either but if things get worse, something needs to be done."
stimuluscheck,fozww86,t1_fozm42q,1588198311.0,"This stimulus is non-taxable.  It‚Äôs separate from anything related to tax-refunds.  The IRS needed our DD info that we use to get our tax refunds.  The government already had all of this money to begin with but were pushed to giving it out due to the pandemic.  They‚Äôve given out a stimulus before when 9/11 hit so I would assume they had some sort of plan if the economy took a hit again.

What wasn‚Äôt planned well was unemployment assistance, the approval and distribution of stimulus packages through the IRS, and other resources to be given to people who needed them.  Business corporations benefited highly from the stimulus approval and got billions of dollars.  

Beggars can‚Äôt be choosers and I‚Äôm thankful to have gotten a stimulus but compared to how other countries are handling it, we‚Äôre a bit behind.  Other counties are providing $1,200 a month to families plus other resources while we get a one-time check so far."

stimuluscheck,foynjkv,t1_foyn1e5,1588175730.0,Oh I see I see.  How I interpreted it is that they‚Äôll mail it by that date.  So there‚Äôll be a room of a few days from the expected date for that check to come in the mail.
stimuluscheck,foyne18,t1_foymu1e,1588175648.0,"I did.  So on the 15th, I didn‚Äôt get a check and my status was not available.  After the updated the website, I checked it finally said I was eligible.  I checked the day after and it gave me a date of the 29th."

UCI,fotp5u9,t3_g8slgl,1588061179.0,"In a heartbeat.  I loved UCI, made so many good memories there, and wish I was back there again.  Because of UCI, I was able to dorm, make new friends, push myself out of my comfort zone, participate in clubs and extracurriculars that I never thought I‚Äôd be a part of, and overall had the best 4 years of my life.  The campus is beautiful, the air is crisp and clean, and the people there were amazing.  

UCI also provides many resources to its students.  Academically speaking, improvements can always be made but that‚Äôs for any higher ed institution.  Financially speaking, UCI broke my wallet and there‚Äôs all these ridiculous little fees that pop up.  So in that regard, improvements can definitely be made.  

I miss studying at the Starbucks or browsing through the library.  I miss watching the sunset from the rooftops.  I miss the park.  I honestly miss everything about UCI.  

If you‚Äôre currently a student, enjoy it.  College as an undergrad only comes once.  Make the most out of UCI and what it has to offer."

Unemployment,fo5x4l7,t1_fo5ws3z,1587538590.0,Do you know if we should fill out the quarterly gross earnings portion just to be safe?  Like when it asks for gross earnings from 1/2019 to 3/2019.  I didn‚Äôt see a red star next to that section so it‚Äôs not required per se.
Unemployment,fo5wdmm,t1_fo5wcem,1587537870.0,He‚Äôs part of a union so would it be through them?
Unemployment,fo5w97b,t1_fo5vzam,1587537753.0,"Wait how do you know Disney submitted all employee info?  So that‚Äôs why Disneyland didn‚Äôt pop up automatically.  Do you know if it‚Äôs considered a private company?

Also, should we fill out the quarterly gross earnings just in case (there‚Äôs no red star next to that section meaning it‚Äôs not required)?  Paid weekly and the pay varied so it‚Äôs just a lot of math :/."
Unemployment,fo5u0gi,t3_g2jubx,1587535654.0,"My dad was furloughed from his job officially on April 19.  They stopped physically going to work in March but were still paid until April 18.  What should he put as his last day of work?  The 19th?

Also, are we required to report quarterly gross earnings?  I did not see an asterisk next to that section so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs not required?  When filling out the application, there was a portion that says to report quarterly gross earnings starting from last year (2019).  Like for example, fill out gross earnings from 1/2019 to 3/2019.  However he was paid weekly so the pay varied along with other things like overtime (lots of math).  

Another thing, his employer doesn‚Äôt automatically pop up after filling personal information (Disneyland).  When I did mine, my employer automatically popped up and all I had to do was select the employer.  Why didn‚Äôt his automatically pop up?"
