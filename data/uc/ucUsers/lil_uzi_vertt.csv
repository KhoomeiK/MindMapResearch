But next winter is going to be much worse and we'll be in another lockdown and unemployment surge for a majority of winter. And I think this is when people will freak out because they know that quarantine sucks and they wont want to go through it again."
UCSD,fjz2jwi,t3_ffkxy3,1583709911.0,"150B doesn't satisfy the CSE machine learning requirement. According to capes its an easy A upper div class, so a lot of people just take the class as an elective.

But people take 151A because its one of the easier courses that satisfy machine learning depending on who is teaching it.

So if you need to take a machine learning course, 150B wont satisfy that requirement, you should take 151A or 158 which I hear is easy. If you just need an upper div elective class you should take 150B because it's relatively easy."
