personalfinance,folq2hs,t1_folhc46,1587867811.0,"I got a quote from my local credit union first. Then I applied to a bunch of places. The major banks, other credit unions, and online lenders. When they called to follow up I told them I was looking for the lowest APR. When they called and gave me the quote, I told them that wasn't good enough and I have a better offer elsewhere. Did this for about 7-10ish lenders. A few days later their retention offices call and give you much a better offer. One online lender quoted me 3.5% with no points, the retention office then quoted me 3.125% with no points. When the second company calls, I give them the offer I have on the table. They will beat it, I use that new offer against the third. By the time all fees were waived and it was $0 to close, I got that lender to lower the interest rate another .125%. Once I had the new lower rate, I emailed the previous people I talked to and asked them to beat it. From their it's asking them to keep beating the new offers.

TLDR: Get a first quote as a base. Apply to a bunch of places. Don't accept the first offer. Wait for the retention offices to call you for the better rates. Ask the lenders to keep asking to beat each other."

I have a high balance loan (above $500k but below jumbo amount of $760k) and looking at a 30 year fixed rate loan at 3.001% APR and $400 cash to close.
