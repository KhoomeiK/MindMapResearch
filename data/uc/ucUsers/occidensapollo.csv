MakeupAddiction,fp6w93j,t1_fp6vyc3,1588359677.0,"Thank you! I agree. I don’t think most people understand what I mean when so say I have lupus. But I’m an open book, happy to answer any questions!"
MakeupAddiction,fp6pzn8,t3_gbmzjs,1588356587.0,"I know there's no face of the day Friday, but considering it's May 1 and May is Lupus Awareness Month, I hope this can fly.

disability,fp48u6j,t1_fp48ry9,1588294006.0,"We can only hope. I said this in the other thread but, based on my reading, it seems that donations and stockpiles are still being directed to in-hospital covid treatment. There are some positive signs though; for example, Oklahoma bought a bunch and their Secretary of Health said [""that the drug is also useful for treating lupus and some other auto-immune diseases, so the state’s supply “will not have gone to waste.”""](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/04/28/us/ap-us-virus-outbreak-malaria-drugs-states.html)

My best case scenario is for a federally protected supply specifically for people for whom this is daily treatment. Questions of equity are especially salient for lupus patients, most of whom are women of color. Knowing this in conjunction with the history and present of medication and accessibility, I'm hoping for the best but expecting the worst."

Who is me (aka why do you care what I say)? Am just a science literate lupus patient with a bone to pick with all this mess."
lupus,fmnzzvg,t1_fmnpsyg,1586240533.0,Thanks! It’s the med I take and I am extremely concerned about what happens when my current supply runs out.
LAlist,fma3yqn,t1_fma3oeu,1585883231.0,"You know I tried to, the first few days. But I am actually an at-risk group, I have lupus, so I had a mask on pretty early. It can be very difficult to convey what you want out of a photograph, or why you even want to take it at all, quickly and at distance, when you can't use your mouth. So alas, I've changed mediums for now and have been painting in my downtime instead."
