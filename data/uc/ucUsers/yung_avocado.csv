berkeley,fnyafii,t1_fnus4e5,1587357496.0,Huh I haven't heard of that... all transfers that I know that wanted housing got it their first year-- you'll most likely be fine I think! They've been adding a lot of extra housing too.
berkeley,fnuqta8,t1_fnsuyb7,1587268707.0,Freshman and Transfer admits are guaranteed on-campus housing if they choose to take it I believe
berkeley,fnsu89r,t3_g3gnka,1587228888.0,"Just wanna share my 2c -- all the people I met when I got admitted as a transfer that had spent hours talking to people and trying to find roommates online ended up having issues with their roommates later in the semester. Meanwhile, my dad told me to just take what fate gives me, and I ended up in a room with two of my best friends I made at Cal. 

Of course, that's just luck but I just mean don't stress too much!!"
berkeley,fnstkxm,t3_g3oay7,1587228539.0,"Hey I got in off an appeal 2 years ago. My appeal was really short and I was so crushed while writing it that I didn't even proof-read it, just wrote a few sentences into the text box and sent it. I talked about why Berkeley specifically was my dream school, name-dropped a professor in CNR that I had talked to, and said something along the lines of ""I know I can handle the challenge and not only gain a lot from the experience personally but also know that I can do a lot to give back to the community at Cal.""

Good luck, I'm really sad that this is my last semester at Cal <3 Go Bears!"

berkeley,fnssfmu,t1_fnrijyr,1587227921.0,HEEEELLLL YEAAAAA
berkeley,fnss8ua,t3_g3dz48,1587227819.0,"Congrats all new transfers!! I know how amazing it feels because I was in your shoes 2 years ago! Now it's my last semester and I'm really sad it's ending like this... Enjoy every single day, don't get dragged into all the self&Cal-loathing that goes around during midterm season because those 2 years really fly by.

Feel free to ask me any questions about CNR, my experience, Berkeley, or anything!! 

Much love and GO BEARS <3"
teenagers,fnsqzxv,t1_fns80uj,1587227133.0,This is it chief. Don't do it very often at your guys' age. I probably smoked about once a week or less starting at like 17 and now I'm about to graduate from Berkeley and even smoke with my parents when I'm home! Never saw that one coming lol!
wallstreetbets,fmnvs18,t1_fmnjdbf,1586236718.0,Only point he's wrong on is you rent out the house

By all means, wear a mask if you want to, but the fact is that if you're under 50-years old and don't have a respiratory disorder, even IF you get COVID-19, it will affect you similarly to a mild flu where you have basically no chance of dying. Most people who even get it recover quickly.
