ucla,fovgk62,t3_g9grrg,1588100949.0,"USAC straight up lied to us. On the CUB Referendum FAQ, they told that the net impact on financial aid students is going to be Zero. Amazing how they will lie to you for political gain. 

Thank you for setting us free with the truth Orion."

This is outrageous, a student government should be accountable to the students and not letting us attend their meeting is outrageous!"
ucla,fn25nhp,t3_fypxpl,1586578520.0,"Reddit family We need your help! We understand your frustration with the recent news of student fee increases on the ballot. We were chosen to be the designated opposition representatives for the CUB Referendum. This is a $45 fee increase annually. We will get to debate against the referendum at the USAC debates and get to publish a statement against the referendum on MY.UCLA.

To start efforts off, We have started a petition to show USAC that students do not want fee increases. USAC is voting to formally endorse this referendum this Tuesday. We will be giving public comments in opposition to the referendum and would love to share a really big number of signatures. I would also love if you could join me on Zoom to give public comment. I will post the zoom link once it's released by USAC. HERE is the link to the petition: tinyurl.com/NoMoreStudentFees

Also, we've created a formal Instagram account. Please give us a follow to stay updated as that is where we will be posting regular updates. https://www.instagram.com/no.new.usac.fees/

Lastly, we need help writing opposition statements. If you have any ideas please PM on here or on Instagram and also feel free to post your thoughts down below."
