UCSantaBarbara,fo9djvg,t3_g6fsnv,1587616609.0,"Just curious, what was it like transferring from another UC? Did all of your classes count for credits here, and did you have to go through a bunch of bureaucratic bullshit to transfer?"
UCSantaBarbara,fo8cohk,t3_g66xzn,1587594042.0,The pain of losing the back cover and having to duct tape the batteries in💀

UCSantaBarbara,fnaow26,t1_fnao4r9,1586801233.0,"I’m surprised your school or even UCSB hasn’t reached out to you guys and told you necessary steps yet. I think it’s worth a shot to try that. I’m sure a lot of other incoming students are going through the same thing, so don’t worry too much."
UCSantaBarbara,fnanyj8,t3_g0nb1x,1586800771.0,Have you tried parchment? That’s what I used when I applied. Otherwise yeah contact your school bc I think it might need an admin signature

UCSantaBarbara,fmpfpgf,t3_fwhk14,1586280018.0,"They give you the PDF for the test, you print it out and you have a few hours to do the test. Then you scan the pages and upload them to gradescope. Pretty straightforward, much less invasive than stupid Proctor U."
370z,fmo5dqc,t1_fmmu54b,1586245991.0,"Brooo my first car was a Chevy Cruze too! At the time I wasn’t a car person but I thought it looked so cool, I actually thought it looked like a baby camaro lmaoooo. Had to get rid of it as well. anyway I’m super into cars now, got my BRZ a couple months ago and I’m in love with how it drives, plus it’s a manual unlike my old Cruze haha"
