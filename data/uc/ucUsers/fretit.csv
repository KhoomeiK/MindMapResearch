A hard working student with somewhat above average ability can get a high GPA.  They are likely to do reasonably well in college in quite a few majors (but less likely to do as well in STEM fields).  They will eventually hit a wall that no amount of studying will allow them to overcome.  

A so-so GPA student with very high SAT probably doesn't have good study habits.  But without proper studying and hard work, you also hit a wall at some point.

So how well these low GPA/high SAT students do in college is less predictable.  Should they be given a chance to transform themselves (like me) or should the opportunity be given to the hard working high GPA student with decent but not outstanding ability.

Kavanaugh had no record of such conduct at all, Biden on the other hand has multiple sniff and touch episodes in plain sight, accusations of inappropriate touching by Lucy Flores (a Democrat), and the well  established nicknames of ""Creepy Uncle Joe"" and ""Creepy Veep"" well before the Tara Reade revelation.

The real issue here is the absolute double standard in media coverage and prejudgement.  The hypocrisy has reached a point where even some hardcore MeToo supporters and some democrats are showing public signs of disgust.

The hypocrisy on Biden's part is even more outrageous.  This is a guy who says women should always be believed when it is politically convenient for him, but he is dismissing those who accuse him."

33k is tuition+room & board (closer to $38K though)  U Chicago is $80k.  That's at least $170k difference over four years.  That's a nice down payment for a decent CA house, or half a very nice house in many other states."
