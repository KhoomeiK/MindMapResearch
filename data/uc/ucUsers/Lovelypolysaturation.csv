I mean, it's understandable if it's just a lab and not meant to be taken seriously but dang, why do they have to rank the scores where you can see exactly where you stand in the class?"
UCSD,fp2i3x6,t3_gan48b,1588262141.0,Is this CSE 15L? lol rip

UCSD,fnna9zw,t3_g2oi0k,1587087847.0,"Evil is a very strong word here because it suggests that he just wants to hurt other people for the sake of hurting people.

Dr. Seuss wasn't evil for cheating and abandoning his wife even while she was suicidal. But was he disgustingly neglectful?  I think so. I think cheating involves a certain lack of care for the consideration for people."

UCSD,fnhzkxp,t3_g0whst,1586971474.0,"Hate to plug myself here, but my Study Group Session is 1:30-2:50pm on Tuesdays.

So far I usually get 2-4 people on average, so if you come you'll probably get to get some help on Math 18, which I think I can help with since I have been doing SI for the class since Fall Quarter. Follow Through!

UCSD,fmwz4q7,t1_fmv6mvi,1586455586.0,"Oh, finally a question I can answer. Physics is pretty medium difficulty when it comes to opportunities. I don't think it's too hard compared to Marine biology to get into a lab, but I don't it's super easy to get into a lab like Biology where they literally ask students to get into their lab.

So if you want to get into a lab, you could start early, get a list of 5 faculty members, and email 'em and pray that they respond and have an open spot for you.

HOWEVER and this is a huge however. People, including me, say that Physics 4A is the hardest weeder class ever. And honestly it's quite unfair. My class went from 120 people up until 65 people at the final. And then down to 55 people in Physics 4B.

So, actually, I would advise you to wait until after taking Physics 4A so you know you're okay with Physics as a major cause that class will hit you like a brick."
