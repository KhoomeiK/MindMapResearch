They're mutually intelligible dilects spoken by the entirety of the population of Rwanda and Burundi (nearly 20 million people) countries which in this arrangement are included in the Swahilli region despite the fact that Swahilli is not natively spoken there by most people. Plus it would create an enclave inside that region, and who doesn't love enclaves."

berkeley,fmyqyd5,t3_fy4bkv,1586493171.0,"I'm a Molecular and Cellular Biology, Economics, and Integrative Biology major. Like a lot of common triple majors, it's doable because two of my majors are super similar. 

I never took over four classes a semester (not counting DeCals or labs) but again a lot of that comes from two of my majors having the same lower div requirements."

berkeley,fmt5x76,t3_fx7wao,1586367380.0,"I can't speak for 140 but if you've taken 54 I'd say give 141 a chance (particularly if Pouzo is teaching, IDK about anyone else). It probably is more in depth, but as a result the class is a lot smaller and the grades are a lot nicer. One problem set around every other week, the begining is the most stats and math heavy but it calms down after that. Honestly I was terrified of taking 140 but 141 has a much nicer curve (50th percentile is A- versus B) and because it's purposefully more intense class sizes are smaller and I feel like there's good support from the GSI and you aren't expected to understand everything, just do your best."
