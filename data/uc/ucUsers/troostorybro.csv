AskMen,fpigqy4,t3_gdiqny,1588640569.0,"I have a very KISS approach to skincare.  I get the occasional blemish but overall I think it works very well.

I wash my face with a tea tree oil facial wash in the morning and at night.  Every other morning I'll exfoliate my face with an acai facial scrub after washing it (really wakes me up).  I use an SPF 15 scent-free moisturizer on my face after each wash.  I should probably use a different moisturizer at night but ... meh."

LosAngeles,fo7es16,t1_fo791xv,1587577103.0,"I have Spectrum and was experiencing intermittent outages every day last week.  They sent three technicians and the third replaced the modem.  My internet has been stable and speedy ever since.

Funnily enough, when I was on the phone scheduling a technician customer support would tell me that it definitely wasn't an area outage.  But the day before the technician was scheduled I'd get an automated call from Spectrum saying the area outage has been fixed and the technician is likely no longer necessary.

I'm glad I kept the appointments.  Lying fucks."

LosAngeles,fo0e96w,t1_fo0daig,1587411495.0,"Exactly! What was your experience like?

These dogs aren't tied up but they are left outside 24 hours a day.  Their backyard isn't much bigger than ours and I'd feel bad leaving my chihuaha/corgi mix out there longer than a few hours."
LosAngeles,fo06vbu,t3_g4sh5z,1587407119.0,"I don't deserve my boss, y'all.  I emailed him Friday that I wanted to talk about my hours.  He replied asking me to call him Saturday morning.  

I called him and he asked me what's going on.  I told him that the quarantine and isolation are getting to me and I literally cannot focus half the day.  The first thing he asked was, ""Have you been exercising?""  He knows I'm into running and knows that if I'm not running something is off.  We talked about our routines and then I told him I wanted to cut back to 35 hour weeks.  He said if it was I needed then to do it.  No questions.

Now onto the next issue.  I knew the dogs across the street were going to be an issue when we moved in.  They literally bark all day and night (never a 30 minute gap between barking fits) and it's three big-ass pit bulls.  I wear ear plugs when I sleep and wasn't home half the day before quarantine.  Now that I'm home the entire day it's grating.  They're barking as I type and it's so loud it kind of echoes in my room (my windows are closed).

I just drafted a letter to LA Animal Services.  From my understanding, the process is:

1. I send LA Animal Services an initial letter describing the issue with the address of the nuisance dogs.

2. LA Animal Services sends a letter to the owners telling them neighbor(s) have complained.

3. If the dogs are still an issue 15 days after LA Animal Services sends the warning, I write a second letter and get the signature of a neighbor that doesn't live with me agreeing that the dogs are a problem.

4. LA Animal Services schedules a hearing.  If the owners don't show they get cited (I'm not sure if the city takes the dogs away).

Anyone got experience with this process or dealing with nuisance dogs at all?  I hate that it's come to this but it's too much.  I'm a dog owner and understand the love and joy they bring to our lives.  But these poor dogs are neglected.  They were left out in the storm last week.  I could see them running around and barking in the storm.  They were barking overnight in the storm.  I've never seen them get walked or even leave the property.  I've never seen anyone in the household outside with the dogs or even interacting with them in any way shape or form.

This isn't okay.  And there's no talking to the owners.  They don't give a fuck about the neighborhood.  There's at least ten people that live in the house who all own 2 or 3 cars that double park, block driveways, park on yards, etc.

Thanks for reading the novel.  Happy Monday, y'all."

LosAngeles,fnls6jf,t3_g2el9x,1587058804.0,"Privileged whiny rant incoming:

Before quarantine my weekdays were pretty much school 8a - 1p then work 1:30p - 8:30p and a half shift Saturday mornings.  And I was good with that because I was in different environments throughout the day.

But now that we're in quarantine I'm kind of losing it sitting in front of my computer from 8a - 8p every day.  I cannot focus and I feel myself going numb.

I work 44 hours/week right now.  I'm thinking of cutting it back to 30.  I've done the math and my budget can take the hit.  I feel guilty that I'm not strong enough to keep working a full work week.  I should be grateful to even have a job right now (and I am, don't get me wrong).

Anyway, I know there are people far worse off due to this whole situation and I should shut up and be grateful for what I've got.  But I had to get that off my chest."
