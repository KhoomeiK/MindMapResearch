UCDavis,fol51kc,t1_fokl0qn,1587855024.0,"I don't quite understand the wording of your response but if you are asking why quarter system is harder, id say because:

1) A lot less time to retain information: It feels like we touch on something once in class and never hear about it again. This makes you have to self teach a lot of the time. Don't get me wrong, I fully expected having to study while in college, but as a first year trying out new things you may struggle in (computer science and biology for me ðŸ˜¬) this will lead to a lot of stress. However, once you find the major you want, it is a lot easier and enjoyable teaching yourself the material. 

2)Large class sizes: not only do the classes move fast, but they are big. This makes it harder to interact with your teachers like in HS or CC

3)More competition: I feel like it is hard to get help at this school because everyone uses the tutoring resources to assist their out of class learning. Tutoring programs (like the calculus room) are ran by ta's. You may get a good one, you may get a bad on, or you may leave after 30 mins of no help because the tiny room is overflowing with 25 other students and only 3 TA's

Overview: This is all my personal experience but I have to disclaim that I am not one of top tier students. If you were the type of kid who was really pushed (like a lot of people here were) then my point of veiw may not apply to you at all. But if you do feel like you may not be ready to really hit the ground runnin then I highly reccomend CC. Take 2 years to get your life, finances, goals in order then drop into uni with a clear mind and goal plan."
UCDavis,fohzu2u,t3_g74tbl,1587775859.0,"If you know what you wanna major in, and you think ucdavis is a good school for that major, then go for it. 

But i do not reccomend going in to this school blindly as a freshman. Trying to figure out your life plan while traversing the quarter system is gonna plow you. 

I would have preferred to just go to community college and figure out my academic goals before diving into such a rigorous environment. My main reason for going strait to uni was because I thought id have so much fun making friends and living in the dorms... Lol loneliest most miserable year of my life"
