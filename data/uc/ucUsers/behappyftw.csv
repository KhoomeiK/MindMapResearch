coolguides,fpmtd07,t3_gebsxe,1588741196.0,"I wouldnt say ""not dangerous"" is comeoletly accurate. A laser of sufficient power can blind you or burn you. Same goes with mucrowaves if you are inside one big enough to boil you alive.

Not saying you are wrong with 5G and the coronavirus. But using this as an argument to ""its completely safe and harmless therefore it cant cause the things you say"" can be easily taken down by one of the 5g rona believers and create a stronger notion that you are wrong and they are right."

Or am i missing something?

If yall really want to talk about just covid why not say we are the daily bruin here to answer questions about covid19 as opposed to ""AMA""?"
photocritique,fnijlse,t3_g1zi87,1586981124.0,"I took this photo about a year ago in a trip to Panama and overlooked it. I went back to it with new editing skills and kind of see some potential in this photo. It was shot handheld (we were not allowed to bring a tripod) and had to focus stack. It was also pretty dark.

I like the rocks in the foreground and the light in the top and river in the middle. but I am not entirely sure about the light and colors. On the one hand, it looks too dark/contrasty but on the other, it looks somewhat natural. What do you think? or what entirely new thing could I try that could improve it? Thank you!

5 minutes later, TA comes in and gives an announcement to everyone: problem x has a wording error. (The problem i asked about). 

When i turned in my midterm the TA apologized to me. That was nice. Tbh my fav TAs have been LS TAs."

To add:


OP talked about cost and considering student's health Have you thought about that consolidating could benefit students health?

- Theres rooms in my floor with 3 people living in them rn. Now they will have singles now. 
- People living in classics are sharing bathrooms rn. They wont after moving.(or atleast with that many)
- With people together, at least you get to see people which helps mentally (now social distancing is up to you and not UCLA). 
- cost wise, they can realocate cost and effort to better help those residents in one building (say a broken elevator is better to fix one that if different buildings broke or adding hand sanitizer stations in one building vs every building, or desinfecting one laundry room/door/lounge/elevator vs many).
- RAs are consolidated and can help if they are in the same building rather than scattered. (Say virtual programming. Assisting with 911 calls. Reporting suspicious activity. Reporting maintenance problem, etc)
- housing might be used for medical personnel. Think about all those families that could be exposed to the virus if the member came back everyday from the hospital (not to count commute). Not to mention the outrage (i am predicting post like this) about having medical personnel with students in the same building. 

Lets not forget that there was an email sent 2 weeks ago saying this could happen (i started packing since):

 >However, students who need to stay in housing may be moved to a differentÂ building to support the needs of the community.Â  


Its is a shitty situation. And i know its frustrating and stressful to you but so it is to everyone else. people forget everyone is suffering rn and get tunnel vision,  and forget to empathize with others too, people forget that this is not normal times. Lets try to see the bigger picture and come together to overcome this. We will all have to do some sacrifices. 

Stay safe people. Stay happy."
