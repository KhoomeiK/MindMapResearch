Then one day I asked him to explain something to me that I was pretty sure he knew how to do. He kind of struggled at first but it was as if a light bulb went on in his head and he gradually gained confidence and gave the answer. He was so happy it looked as if he was about to cry. There were high fives all around. 

Prior to that every time we studied together he desultorily thanked me for my time. After that his gratitude was effusive. In the second semester he would give me updates on his progress and ask a question or two; mostly to see if he had a concept correct. He also told his TA about our studying and this led to me being chosen as a UGSI for the course when I was a junior. 

He passed the second semester on his first try."
AskReddit,fp9hau1,t1_fp8s4c9,1588426181.0,"> three times got you out of a program

One day when I was a freshman in college, I sat next to this guy in O-chem who looked between 30 and 50 years old. He listened intently to the lecture, took copious notes, and even recorded the lecture. 

After the first midterm, I sat next to him again when they were handing back our tests. He gets his and just stared at the pages. I tried not to peek at his score but I could see a great deal of red ink. Suddenly, I notice a big fat tear fall on his test and his shoulders kind of go up and down. 

After class he pulled me aside and asked me how I did so well on the test. We theN went to a cafe and he told me his life story. Ever since he was young he wanted to be a mortician. He had completed all of the requirements except for organic chemistry. This was his third and last attempt. If he didn’t pass he would still graduate but not be able to be a mortician. 

I offered to help him because I couldn’t believe how he could be so confused when it came so easily to me. Every day for the rest of the semester we spent one or two hours studying O-chem together and one or two Sundays we spent all day together. He even offered to pay me for my time, but I told him it was unnecessary because I was getting a lot out of it because explaining things to him solidified the concepts for me. 

He ended up passing the class. The second semester we didn’t study together, but by then he had figured the subject out and could do it on his own.

There was a new legal secretary at my friend's law office that worked in litigation. My friend is a banking attorney, but he used to see the secretary around the office.

My friend thought the dinner went well and after they had finished dessert the legal secretary went to the bathroom. After about ten minutes the server approached my friend and said his date left through the kitchen. My friend paid and left.

My friend was kind of upset, texted her to see if she was OK, and was ghosted.

The following Monday, the secretary was BRAGGING to her coworkers that she got a free meal and dashed on my friend. Someone eventually ratted her out to her boss. Her boss asked my friend his version of events and my friend corroborated it. Her boss was pissed and told my friend that the legal secretary would be fired. My friend said firing was unnecessary. What the legal secretary did was shitty, but not worth taking the legal secretary's livelihood away.

My brother went to my 20th reunion instead of me. 

Some background: My brother and I are two years apart and attended different boarding schools. We don't look much alike. While I am probably average looking at best, he was very attractive and I'd witnessed women actually swoon when meeting him. Also, one of his closest friends attended my school.

When reunion time came around, I got an email from a friend asking if it was OK to pass on my contact information to the organizers so I could be formally invited. I declined, saying thanks, but I'm not really interested. My friend left it at that, but said he was going.

Word got around to my brother's friend that I wasn't going so he invited my brother in my place. My brother RSVPed as me and went.

I went to an all boys boarding school (now it is co-ed), but the reunion was held jointly with an all girls school that we later merged with. There was a girl at the all girls school that I had a crush on when I was a student. I didn't think she knew about it, but when she saw my brother with my name at the reunion, she approached him and said she knew about my crush. My brother thought this was hilarious and they hit it off. She and my brother ended up spending  the weekend together. 

A few days after the reunion, she got in touch with me via email and told me how much fun she had with me and even sent me some pictures of her and my brother from the reunion. She closed the email with the wistful words, ""oh what could have been."" I thought this was weird, so I called my brother and asked him what happened. He told me that that they hooked up and that she was probably married."
