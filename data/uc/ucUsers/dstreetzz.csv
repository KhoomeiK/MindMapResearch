ucla,fpitzxp,t1_fpifhmx,1588648683.0,Exactly! That is why itâ€™s important to highlight what weâ€™ve achieved before UCLA. Maybe one day the Daily Bruin will have transfers choosing and writing the endorsement for their representative!
ucla,fpitrno,t1_fpiiw6y,1588648534.0,Thank you so much for your support through this election cycle!
ucla,fpitq4c,t1_fphztud,1588648505.0,Thatâ€™s exactly why my slate is running! We want to make USAC a place that harbors new ideas and actually represents the student body!
ucla,fpitjmb,t1_fpitdqr,1588648387.0,Oh my goodness thank youðŸ˜­ðŸ’›
ucla,fpirdsw,t3_gdin17,1588647013.0,Heâ€™s got my vote!
ucla,fpioalj,t3_gdp2pn,1588645101.0,As students we can attempt to keep this election fair!
ucla,fphofe7,t3_gdj169,1588624870.0,"My name is Deven Streeton and I am running for USAC transfer student representative.

I  know it wonâ€™t come as a shock to many of you on this subreddit. Yet again the Daily Bruin has favored For the People over other slates. Both of us are transfer students, they chose not to endorse me because I  lack experience with USAC. I am a transfer student running for transfer rep! How could I possibly have experience working on USAC? It is my first year at UCLA, Iâ€™m still trying to find my footing. They note that  Zuleika also lacks that experience (with USAC), but somehow itâ€™s not an issue. They do note her involvement with transfer clubs on campus which is great, but they willfully ignore my previous experiences. They donâ€™t think I can handle the student government. In community college, I was the *co-president of the Honors Transfer Club*.  We organize trips to nearby campuses, as well as offering support on navigating college and the university application process. I currently work for a *non-profit* that helps low-income, and marginalized youth come together to create art. My duties range from administrative work as well as hands-on activities with kids during the summer. Most notably providing support and a place to hone art amongst LGBTQ+ and foster youths. Additionally, I spent three years of high school on my schoolâ€™s *Honors Thespian* (theater) *board*, serving as *Vice President* of our club. I was also the *head producer* of my schoolâ€™s weekly broadcast news. I know how to work with peers as well as produce quality projects in alignment with a deadline.

The only negative they had about my campaign is false. This is a woeful bias on the part of the Daily Bruin. They continue to favor For the  People over other slates and independent candidates. It is clear that whoever is writing for the Daily Bruin is very ignorant about the experiences of transfers. I have achieved a lot, I have worked incredibly hard to be at UCLA. **Just because my work in clubs has been done at a previous institution does not lessen my qualifications, rather it heightens it.**  I have worked with diverse groups of people. In high school, I worked for three years with very strong personalities. In community college, I  worked with people from different age groups, different cultures,  different backgrounds.

My slate  Cost-Cutting Innovations has been attacked endlessly through this election cycle. But we rise above, because we know we are better than petty comments and cyberbullying. Rather than focusing on the negative, I  saw an opportunity to address you, the student body with my truth.

**So please vote this week!**  It is up to you guys to make sure our voices are heard! We need new perspectives in USAC. They have created a perpetual circle where the same point of view is repeated over and over and rhetoric never gains new voices. So please vote between today and Friday for me Deven  Streeton, a proud member of Cost-Cutting Innovations, as transfer rep!!  We want to make your voice heard!

ucla,fncgwy6,t3_g0umq0,1586836469.0,I feel the exact same way. UCLA really feels like it thrives off memorization over genuine deep understanding. I also struggle to make deep friendships because it seems like everyone is craming every minute of the day cramming.
birthright,enoedgp,t3_benctc,1557958248.0,I think most people go alone. I went to a informational meeting with around a hundred people (all going on trips this summer) and when they asked if anyone was traveling with a friend I was the only one who raised a hand. So I think most of the others on your trip will prob be in the same boat!
