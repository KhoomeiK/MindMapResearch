Unemployment,fp8ti23,t1_fp8n4e0,1588402464.0,Thank you for doing the math to figure this out! I‚Äôm definitely gonna stay on the side of caution and be below $70.
Unemployment,fp8sa9b,t1_fp8rvew,1588401325.0,"I only did the form once and now I exclusively use the Online process! As soon as you log into your Benefits Online account, on the Homepage, there should be a Banner that immediately prompts you to Certify for Benefits. If that is not there, then click the the tab on the top of the page that says ‚ÄúCertify for Benefits‚Äù and it should provide you with some information as to whether you‚Äôre required to certify or not."
Unemployment,fp8rgwp,t1_fp8r79h,1588400568.0,"Once you get approved for Unemployment Benefits, they start sending you a form called ‚ÄúCertify for Benefits.‚Äù They Mail it to you, but you can also do it online (which the EDD recommends). 

On the certify for benefits form, it gives you the option to select ‚ÄúYes I earned wages.‚Äù From there, you would enter the amount of money you made during the two weeks it asks you to certify. So while you don‚Äôt necessarily input the exact amount of hours you worked, it compares your new reduced wages to the wages you received before COVID-19. Let me know if this makes sense or if I answered your question correctly!"
ucr,fp8c7x8,t3_gbx0r4,1588388695.0,"$500! I was expecting more since like UCSB was getting $800 minimum, but I am grateful nonetheless!"
ucla,fp4z50t,t1_fp4y0ei,1588311340.0,This was very helpful thank you so much! Worksheets sound helpful because it‚Äôll actually have content that I know I should study and understand.
ucla,fp4wd82,t1_fp4omr2,1588309132.0,Thank you!
COROLLA,fp4b4nx,t3_g9qq0j,1588295330.0,"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs normal. I have the 2020 sedan and yes wind noise is normal when it‚Äôs windy, but I don‚Äôt ever experience whistling when driving. 

Sounds silly, but I make this mistake a lot. Make sure your windows are completely rolled up. Even if it they look fully closed, roll them up just to make sure there‚Äôs not a super tiny gap that could cause whistling noises."
ucla,fp467u6,t3_fwh710,1588292498.0,I‚Äôm registered to take LS7A-C all in the summer intensive series. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs not too brutal!
ucr,fozvczn,t3_gahg4q,1588197525.0,"It‚Äôs definitely less than that! Your main fees will chiefly be the $15k tuition and any other campus fees (like the $209 SRC fee). They just include the other fees as a guide to help you estimate how much you would actually spend if you paid rent at your parents‚Äô residence, bought textbooks, food, etc. 

As for FAFSA being on hold, I‚Äôm not too sure what that means. I got told my loan and aid options the moment I got acceptance into the school. If you have any other questions let me know!"
Unemployment,foztooq,t1_foztfve,1588196678.0,Ah! This makes sense! Thank you for explaining and providing the section where it breaks it down further.
Unemployment,fozrov7,t1_fozramg,1588195686.0,"I‚Äôm a little confused on what means. I‚Äôm sorry, this is my first doing this."
Unemployment,foxnhof,t1_foxnbrp,1588149703.0,"I see, thank you. I‚Äôll continue to certify for benefits as usual then. I appreciate the help!"
Unemployment,foxjv8w,t1_foxjs8z,1588146283.0,Makes sense! I‚Äôm just scared I don‚Äôt qualify since it only says they‚Äôre paying me the $55 with no additional payment. Thank you for the clarification though!
Unemployment,foxj62v,t3_g9v8ln,1588145644.0,"I basically put everything you put and about a week later I got the email that I could now certify for benefits. I applied for UI on 3/15, and got the notice I could certify about a week later. Give it some time and hopefully you should get some kind of notification. 
Just so you know, I just now got laid for two weeks of UI. Hopefully it‚Äôs faster on your end"
ucr,foxgi5q,t1_fovibmm,1588143283.0,Then I think you‚Äôre all set to receive the money!
ucla,foh0tfi,t1_foh0ae3,1587759228.0,My motivation has left the room.
ucla,fog54l5,t1_fog07ya,1587748015.0,Okay I really appreciate you telling me this so I can decide if this really is the best idea. Was there a curve???? üòÖ
ucla,foemzuj,t1_foel5np,1587708245.0,"This makes me sad. At UCR we have the ‚Äú5 series‚Äù and 5A was ridiculous. I studied tremendously, watched every YouTube video, and did every worksheet and still ended up failing the class because of how ridiculous the exam questions were. 

I read on another Reddit post here that UCLA‚Äôs Bio series is much more focused on learning the content rather than administering excruciating exams. I‚Äôm hoping the online format this summer sessions provides some type of ease."
Switch,fob953o,t3_g6c0lz,1587657401.0,"Definitely Zelda. When I first got the switch, I got animal crossings, but got quickly used up practically everything you could do in the game in a day. I got zelda a few days later and I‚Äôve already put in more than 70 hours"
MechanicAdvice,fo97cgd,t1_fo95rfw,1587612241.0,Okay that‚Äôs a relief. I was so scared that it would voice the warranty since the packages are pretty comprehensive with the new 2020 hybrids.
MechanicAdvice,fo97af2,t1_fo952nt,1587612203.0,Yea this argument makes perfect sense. Toyota definitely doesn‚Äôt want people coming in repeatedly for repairs.
MechanicAdvice,fo978tf,t1_fo94lg3,1587612174.0,Thank you this was very helpful considering that it‚Äôs not hard to get a permanent repair.
MechanicAdvice,fo976fx,t1_fo93cx5,1587612129.0,Funny I was just reading up about a class action lawsuit against Toyota in 2018 for using soy based wiring. But we argued and didn‚Äôt get anywhere with the price
MechanicAdvice,fo92sqh,t1_fo92gt6,1587609251.0,My two concerns are 1.) If there is more damage in obscure places that prompted Toyota to recommend the whole replacement and 2.) If this would void my manufacture warranty
COROLLA,fo92g1h,t3_g5o5q3,1587609029.0,Update from the dealer: $2300 to replace the wire harness. Not covered by warranty. Currently seeking advice from the mechanicadvice thread if I should go forward with the replacement or see an ordinary mechanic
COROLLA,fo5tuiu,t1_fo5rcgz,1587535504.0,Catch me putting my car in the garage from now on haha.
COROLLA,fo5r52z,t1_fo5qrp5,1587533130.0,I think I saw the post you were referring too! And wow it‚Äôs crazy to hear you had similar problems. It seems like this is a pretty common issue. But I‚Äôm glad to hear that you were able to fix it yourself! It must‚Äôve been nice to know what to look for and how to remedy it. I will keep you all updated tomorrow after hearing what the dealer says
COROLLA,fo5q1an,t1_fo5p5wg,1587532203.0,"Honestly I‚Äôm totally on board with that idea. I‚Äôm definitely going to still take it to the dealership to see what they quote me for. But if it‚Äôs outrageous, then yea I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with asking my friends if they have the knowledge to do that. I appreciate your input!"
COROLLA,fo5odhj,t1_fo5mgsv,1587530852.0,I didn‚Äôt think this day could get any worse. Hopefully the damage isn‚Äôt extensive
COROLLA,fo5lxxk,t1_fo5karu,1587528954.0,I‚Äôm so relieved it wasn‚Äôt the actual car itself. These Toyota‚Äôs don‚Äôt usually break so it was pretty shocking to me that it was making all these weird noises
COROLLA,fo5brrk,t1_fo5az2f,1587521903.0,"https://imgur.com/gallery/nIwYgFZ

I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to put pictures on a Reddit post. I uploaded it to Imgur. Lemme know if the link works!"
COROLLA,fo5aqkk,t3_g5o5q3,1587521233.0,I think I found the problem! I found some wires chewed through leading from the engine cause that‚Äôs gotta be causing some kind of misfire. I‚Äôm taking it to the dealer tomorrow
COROLLA,fo4mn4i,t3_g5o5q3,1587507191.0,"https://youtu.be/YXNiTtv_fyM
Here‚Äôs a video of the noise it makes when idling. It‚Äôs never this loud and doesn‚Äôt make this idling noise. It‚Äôs 3x as loud and harsh when driving"
ucla,fo4h4h3,t1_fo4c9wd,1587504319.0,You‚Äôre right I should definitely get into contact with a UCLA counselor because I‚Äôm confused. UCR‚Äôs Bio sequence has a corresponding lab for each class
ucla,fo42r72,t1_fo313o0,1587497204.0,THANK YOU! That would be so helpful
ucla,fo42okg,t1_fo3d2wj,1587497168.0,"I‚Äôm that case, do you recommend that I still take LS 23L?"
ucla,fo2i9zs,t1_fo29ebv,1587463476.0,"Is the 7 series that bad??? I‚Äôm not a science major at UCR so I can‚Äôt take some of the premed classes offered there, but I‚Äôm allowed to do it at other UC campuses. UCLA is the closest to my house + Summer Sessions is going to be taught online"
ucla,fo1w6ay,t1_fo1vzwy,1587442885.0,You are a lifesaver! I appreciate the help greatly
ucla,fo1t4fh,t1_fo1stov,1587440895.0,"Thank you! I figured out how to do it concurrently with 7C. For the sake of clarification, am I now correctly registered for the Bio Series w/ lab needed for medical school? Like is this how normal pre-med students at UCLA would tackle the Bio prerequisite?"
ucla,fo1ryor,t1_fo1rhjz,1587440112.0,Do you know how I can register for that? Sorry I‚Äôm not familiar with UCLA‚Äôs life science program
COROLLA,fm50x9j,t1_fm4mx7g,1585764280.0,Same. I really wish this information was easily presented on the MID. Even my 8 year old Chevy tells me the pressure of each tire
