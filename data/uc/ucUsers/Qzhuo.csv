educationalgifs,fph54l6,t1_fpgqflg,1588615130.0,"There is a very cool and mesmerizing area of math investigating things called fractals -- infinite repeating patterns (i.e. no matter how much you zoom in you will see the same pattern, or a tessellation on steroids) that can be represented using mathematical operations. Some famous ones have names such as the Sierpinski Triangle and the Koch Snowflake, although I don't know if this one does.

And I agree with your sentiment. It seems like this sub is getting less educational and more show+don't tell."
UCI,fpfnhlj,t3_gd3y0l,1588576857.0,"Gonna try to share my highlights just so I can stop feeling anxious after midterms are over. I think I need to wind down and reflect on some positives:

&#x200B;

\- I restocked on supplies and bought some spices. Excited to try out some new recipes! Even got a care package full of food which I am extremely grateful for. If anyone has easy recipes I'd like to hear em :)

\- I did a bunch of cramming and studying before midterms. Although putting it off and being way too complacent during the quarter caught up to me, the studying helped bring me back a bit into school mode. I think I'm ready this week to try and be more diligent.

\- I caught up with some friends who were also dealing with quarantine and realized that everyone else is also having it rough. Just talking really helped me out and even though I wasn't really productive during that time at the end of the day I still didn't feel bad for not studying. 

&#x200B;

I hope this doesn't come off as show off-y. The quarter felt a bit slow but now that it's half way over it kinda felt like a blur. Let's push through the rest of it!"
UCI,fp3n99k,t1_fp3jvuz,1588282307.0,"I thought it was pretty clear, and even just reading the TL;DR spelled out what the student was trying to suggest: better email communication, share discussion recordings for students unable to make it or for review, allow practice midterm to be revisited and make it so you can actually see the practice question/answers, etc.

  
There are some parts that just flat out go ""I don't understand what's going on, teach better"" but there it boils down to the students having questions about the content and they are (allegedly) going completely unanswered. Sounds pretty constructive to me."

Camouflage has nothing to do with appearing threatening -- it is about blending in with surroundings   
Mimicry is meant to be noticeable -- it makes the animal appear more threatening than it is

&#x200B;

You overlook camouflage and get fooled by mimicry"

UCI,fmt8eff,t3_fwofjc,1586368512.0,"As someone else has said, your best bet is to sign up for the class that works best with your schedule first and then switching out. Remember many classes have an ""attend class 1"" policy (39B was like that and I switched out by emailing the prof)"
