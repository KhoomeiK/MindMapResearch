statistics,fpa3fdr,t1_fp9ycek,1588440021.0,"You can either use a mapping function to take each category to a number {1,2,3,4} etc or you can take each category into its own column, with 0 or 1. Depending on the number of categories there are trade offs with this method but the coefficient you get back may be more meaningful than if you split uneven categories into evenly spaced ordinal numbers. You have to look at the ranges and determine what the meaningful difference is between them."
statistics,fp8myem,t3_gbntly,1588396696.0,"I’m at a top ranked stats program and just finishing up the masters. I had almost 0 stats coming in, but I have a degree in math and CS so I’m a great control variable for how all the stats undergrads handled the program. I struggled a lot in stats, but succeeded in proofs based probability theory. Then when statistical computing and linear models came along, it felt great to me, because it is essentially applied linear algebra. But my classmates struggled a LOT. I spent a significant amount of time walking them through things like gram Schmidt (sp?) and projections, column space, bases, etc. and also general proof writing. 

I would recommend calculus at the level of second year or second semester calculus, but multi variable isn’t quite as important. But focus on linear algebra, and try to adopt the linear algebra mindset more than anything. It will help you vectorize calculations and visualize regression and linear models (and neural networks, etc) much more effectively."

berkeley,foisg66,t3_g7nbm8,1587795535.0,"I stopped going to class a few weeks ago, but my schedule is still very packed. The difference is, if I’m doing something I’m not enjoying, I quickly switch to something much more manageable or enjoyable. If I don’t have one of those manageable or enjoyable tasks lined up, I get a free pass to take an hour break. Nap, shows, you name it. Then I get straight back to it and try to find something interesting. 

Studies involving athletes find that enjoyment and excitement for the task or progress improved adherence and attrition during “off weeks” or in our case “off year/semester”. Always follow the enjoyment path, and give yourself space to process and enjoy your hobbies. Like, I give myself unlimited time to play guitar, but only a small amount of time to mindlessly scroll or watch shows. This way I don’t get burnt out. I need to keep my spirits up because I know if I spiral it will be very challenging to bounce back (had 3-5 spiral days in mid-March and I thought I might not snap out of it)

Anyway I’m sure you will find some groove that works for you. And if you don’t, it’s totally normal and okay during a stressful time like this."
berkeley,foicfx2,t1_fohhjx2,1587783446.0,"This is very wise. Some of my best training was from one particular CC teacher. GE’s in undergrad are overrated and there are only certain classes that are worth it, like the first series of CS or other famous courses that you can hold out for. If nobody is going to have the standard freshmen experience, why not go through CC and save money, save your expectations for transferring and really enjoying yourself!"

statistics,fn4scaq,t1_fn37zl5,1586647906.0,"Time elapsed varies person to person. Once you do the first few lessons it will be easier for you to estimate yourself. I had a full CS degree before I did swirl or used R, and it was still clunky, because it handles things differently than a traditional language (Functional vs. object oriented programming). However, after some time using it for statistics, I realized the power and the intuition behind a lot of what it does and why. 

In addition to swirl, becoming familiar with dplyr, tidyverse, and ggplot2 can do wonders for your ability to mutate data and represent it visually quickly. I imagine for your project you will only need to have a cursory understanding of these libraries. 

R does seem difficult to handle at first, and so does statistical inference and a project like this. Once you break it up into the steps required you may find it to be much more manageable. Don’t take shortcuts to just produce the project or “get through it”. 

That’s why I always recommend swirl. Nobody has time to learn it carefully and slowly the first time, but students always manage to find the time to learn it properly the 3rd or 4th time when they have been faking their way through the assignments. 

Best of luck! Google is your friend, and so are we!"
statistics,fn35yf4,t3_fz3lgw,1586613671.0,"Have you heard of swirl? It’s my favorite tool to recommend to my students to learn R. It’s quick, interactive, and will help you build some intuition. 

Of course, having someone explain the process or walk you through it could be helpful, but it sounds like you have a very reasonable assignment that’s requiring you to learn some new skills and tools and apply them. Remember, the learning and adapting is also an important part of your development as a biostatistician! 

Try chunking out the problem and writing an outline the way you would for an essay. Then you can just do each part separately and problem solve. Explore the data -> fit a model -> estimation -> report your results."
