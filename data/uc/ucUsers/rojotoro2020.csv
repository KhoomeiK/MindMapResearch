California_Politics,fpgoet0,t3_gddqus,1588606585.0,"Instead of thanking Newsom and local public health leaders from preventing California from having a major outbreak like in other states, Dan Walters wants to compare Newsom to a dictator and then compares him to Trump because Newsom has had a few flip flops in the past? What kind of writing is this! I am an avid follower of Dan Walters but this gave me the sense that he is probably attending the ""Reopen California"" protests without wearing a mask."

So I told my roommate that he needs to be careful and not go outside so much to not expose himself to the coronavirus because he has a pre-existing condition. He said that he doesn’t. That he is healthy. I said you have one... what about the blood clots you were always worrying about. The coronavirus can create clots in heart and brain. He said it was his anxiety that made him think he had blood clots and that hes healthy. Lol

It is a tragedy. Two people who seem to be right for each other and re-invigorate each other's lives have to leave each other to live their lives with people who might not truly care for each other. I hope that them finding that fun, excitement, passion, and love are still possible gives sparks to their lives and joy for the future.
