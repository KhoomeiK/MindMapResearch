I’m with my dad and he’s super extroverted, and he doesn’t like me spending any time in my room by myself because I’m being “closed off” and I need to “join the family.” It’s absolutely driving me crazy. He doesn’t realize I need alone time for my own sanity"

UCSC,fo91h4b,t1_fo8mjp4,1587608410.0,"I don’t think that’s really fair to put in this situation. I’m currently living with my abusive dad who barely gives me any time for myself to study, and I don’t have any friends to talk to, but I’m not disruptive. There isn’t really a correlation there - I think people are just bored. I don’t know if saying anything would make a difference or if they’d just ignore me, but I feel like it would be the latter seeing as the professor literally said to keep the chat on-topic and they didn’t listen to her; I don’t think I have as much power/ability to be respected as she does."
UCSC,fo911lc,t1_fo8yebk,1587608139.0,The class I was talking about is an upper div. That one has ~75 people and my other class has about 12 and has a pretty much nonexistent chat. I guess the larger the class the more rowdy it gets?

UCSC,fmrlm8m,t3_fwyi5c,1586327030.0,"The animals here are interesting because they’re clearly used to being surrounded by people and know how to stay out of the way for the most part (except for the turkeys but they’re the bosses). They won’t bother you if you don’t bother them. We have deer, turkeys, squirrels, raccoons, coyotes, and occasionally mountain lions, and of course banana slugs. We do have various birds, mostly ravens, and owls can be heard at night if you’re in the forest. I guess it depends on your level of fear if you think you can coexist with them."
ucsccola,fmnv93p,t1_fmnuyvq,1586236275.0,">Hi all,   
>  
>In the past few weeks, undergraduates have been circulating a petition and organizing in order to demand spring tuition back. The reasons behind this demand consist of the facts that:  
>  
>We did not sign up or pay for online education when we enrolled in UCSC  
>  
>UCSC fired 80+ graduate students for fighting for their basic human rights  
>  
>We are paying on campus fees for a campus we physically cannot access  
>  
>The university gives us zero transparency about where our money is going, and zero control over what they spend it on  
>  
>In this petition (see some results below) hundreds of undergraduates said that they would be un-enrolling or under-enrolling from the university while even more expressed other ways in which they would be addressing the way the university has failed to act in the best interest of its students. We would like to invite you to continue or join in this organizing effort and send an email to UCSC admin and the regents to let them know the results of this petition and that undergraduates are demanding a refund for our spring quarter tuition. We should not be expected to pay the same amount for an education that has been greatly impacted. Please join us in showing the administration that we will hold them accountable for their unresponsiveness and unwillingness to meet the needs of their students and workers. Use [***this***](https://tinyurl.com/canceltuition) link to send an already formatted email to the administration, and spread the attached flyer to demand your tuition back.

UCSC,fml1pwe,t3_fvrj7h,1586176239.0,You should be super proud of how far you’ve come. It’s tough as hell to move out of an abusive household as it is and you got through university despite that? That’s pretty awesome. I’ve had my own situation regarding an abusive household and I can’t say it’s been easy navigating through an academic career at all. I’m also pretty bummed about commencement but I can only hope that it’ll just be pushed off and not outright canceled. Don’t give up hope just yet.
