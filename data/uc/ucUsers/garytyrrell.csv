Why do you say this? There are already CBD drinks available. What would AriZona add to make them groundbreaking?"

Met my wife a bit after my divorce and we hit it off amazingly. We had a great few years just the two of us, and now are expecting our second baby. Life is wonderful and I’m so happy I didn’t write off marriage after my first failure."

AskSF,fov4dcj,t1_fov1sf6,1588095183.0,"> But I guess because everyone you know is so anxious to attend every event under the sun, that any event you go to you are likely to run in to somebody you know... so perhaps making plans to actually meet for a coffee was unnecessary.

This is the thing. I think some people think “We should meet up/get a coffee/get a drink” is disingenuous. I'm guilty of saying that as a goodbye, but in the moment, I definitely think ""I like spending time with this person and would love to again."" But, like you said, I want to go to all of the events under the sun (and then there are work and family commitments). So actually calendaring 1:1 time with that person is likely not going to happen, as much as I would like to. I'll most likely see that person again at the next party...the next concert...the next Dolores picnic...etc.

edit: to clarify, I 100% agree with you, but want to point out that people aren't usually malicious - just busy and maybe overly optimistic."
