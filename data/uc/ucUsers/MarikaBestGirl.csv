JETProgramme,fpmoggj,t1_fpmigwj,1588737667.0,"If you're anywhere not in the major cities, it's gonna be a bad time. I'm not talking rice paddy inaka, but even small city size. In summer, there are cicadas but they're chill, however they do tend to fly around, sit on trees, and you'll see their dead corpses on the ground.

Outside, there are giant hornets and wasps flying around and they're like jump scares. Inside, your house will 95% have roaches, even if you keep it clean. As someone who's scared of bugs, last summer when I came was very very hard. People might think I'm exaggerating, but when you're actually scared of bugs, seeing roaches in your house and outside you see giant fucking bugs flying around, it's terrifying.

I still have nightmares where I'm woken up at night because I can hear the cockroach legs scraping against my tatami mats because they're scurrying around.

Additional tidbit: At orientation, they talk a lot about culture shock and homesickness, and leading you to cry etc. But I have only cried twice in my time here. the first was I mistakenly went to a small inaka barbershop and ended up with the worst haircut of my life a week before I was supposed to meet all my friends (I ended up having to reset it and shave my head basically). The second time was in summer when I came, I have never dealt with roaches in my life before, so I was terrified of them, and they just kept coming and coming in my house. I'd be lucky if I didn't see one a day. I cleaned everything, bought all the sprays and traps, but I'd still occasionally see one, and I had to learn it's inevitable for the most part in Japanese summer. I'd feel like I accomplished a lot after cleaning and setting up traps, but to see one the same night was just such a heartbreaker. I felt so helpless; I couldn't sleep at night because since I sleep on the futon on the floor, I'd have nightmares of them crawling over me when I slept. I want to say I got over my fear, and in a way I did where I don't scream and can now just say ""fuck my life"" and walk over and get some spray, I'm actually very worried about summer coming again.."
JETProgramme,fpd6aa5,t1_fpd5m1g,1588520718.0,"Yeah, it's harder for me because I was in their shoes just a year ago, so it's a balancing act of trying to express optimism while also being realistic.

At its core that's what the main message is. The reasons or events that lead to many of us coming to that conclusion differs in many ways, but many of us have been embarrassed or hurt because we have been judged. Yes it leads to a sense of paranoia, and even though it's not justified, it's hard to not feel paranoid about somethings when you're proved right every once in awhile.

If you're saying we take it too far one way, I believe you're also taking it too far the other. 
>The bold, expressive foreigners are constantly ridiculed by rigid and robotic Japanese teachers.

The majority of the advice and posts here are in context to what the OP is asking about. While certainly many of us complain about ""DAE Japan ___?"", we know that it doesn't apply to everyone. 

My final point would be, and this is more personal than the others, is it really fucking pisses me off when people say ""just be yourself, be an individual"". Obviously, I'm not saying don't be yourself, but sometimes it's not so easy. You say as if you can walk in, be yourself, idk blue-haired and all, and all your teachers and co-workers will clap in applause and be supportive of your individualism. Wrong colored hair? I got embarrassed for wearing the wrong colored mask. It affects me more than others because I'm Asian, so it irks me when other foreigners say ""just be yourself"" when for me, from Day 1, I've felt immense pressure to conform to the Japanese way of things, starting with comments like ""oh, because you don't look foreign the kids will be more comfortable"" to people talking to me about foreigners or other ALTs as if they've forgotten I'm one of them myself. It feels like I'm expected to know all the Japanese culture customaries, and if I don't, I get met with disappointment. There's no handholding, there's no gaijin-smashing, so I feel lied to when I read stuff like what you posted and what JET tells you during the orientations. But again, that's a personal thing.

ESPECIALLY with things that are going on now, I think a lot of us JETs learned the hard way of us having to conform to Japan and how it does things. So many of of us tried to express our worries, like work from home. ""oh, working from home? In Japan we don't do that..."" ""Well, Japanese people...""

It's not a bunch of people shitting on someone trying to express themselves. It's that, you come to a point where you start having to weigh the risk factors and pros and cons, and since some of us have been burned really hard, it pressures us to err on the side of caution."
JETProgramme,fpb9ven,t3_gcgc7z,1588465233.0,"When they see your colored hair, one of the following will happen:

1) You're super lucky and have the rare BoE/Supervisor/Principal/JTE that's chill with everything (extremely unlikely)

2) You will be hit with passive aggressive comments like ""Oh...your hair.."" and ""Is it common to dye your hair that color at home? Japanese teachers can neverrrrr dye their hair like that..."" (likely will happen and they are trying to pressure you to dye it a normal color, but you could choose to gaijin smash and ignore this)

3) Your JTE confronts you crying because his/her ass just got ripped up by the principal because he/she is your supervisor(depending) and somehow it's his/her fault the gaijin has weird colored hair and now he/she has to confront you about it (also extremely unlikely but I've heard it happen)

Honestly, the more realistic scenario is that they'll see your hair and will be slightly offput about it but they can't really say or force anything because you're gaijin and CuLtUrAl ExChAnGe. It's not really a big deal either because even if they're whatever about it for a few days, they'll get used to it. I re-dyed my hair before coming because I'm a kissass but that's just me."

However, I never felt limited or shamed or treated differently because of me weight. What did matter was that my bad habits and weight gain was a reflection of my mental state. In my 3rd and 4th years, I started dieting and swimming and working out and because I felt better, both mentally and physically, I tended to attract more people/be more positive and confident and happier that helped me greatly. 

My weight loss wasn't due to how I was treated, nor did I lose weight to try to be accepted, because there was none of that at all FOR ME, not saying it couldn't happen or you encounter one drunk asshole on a friday night who says something. UCSB was amazing for me because of the chill atmosphere and just how chill everyone is, I can't really explain it but all Gauchos will know what I'm talking about.

JETProgramme,fmuhxji,t1_fmueyge,1586391750.0,"/u/SnootyDeath listen to /u/PresentHamster I know it's not what you want to hear, but your BoE could flat out say ""sorry no pets"". Sure you can get another apartment, IF they let you, as someone contracts state that you can't, and that you have to live in BoE housing. Mine is like that, many others are like that.

Okay so let's say you negotiate that you'll pay the BoE's housing rent, and you'll rent a separate apartment where you can live that accepts pets. Alright, good luck paying rent for BoE housing AND paying rent for a place that allows pets, as those will have way higher rent due to space and also fees. There are additional challenges to this, as some renters will flat out refuse to rent to foreigners, nevertheless to a foreigner family with pets. Equally so, it's unlike that a Japanese friend you meet here will be willing to be your guaranteer. 

Assuming your spouse does not work, on your 280,000/month JET salary, let's say 40,000 goes to BoE rent, another 80,000 for a place big enough for 2 people and allows pets, minus 60,000 in taxes, pension, insurance, minus 15,000 in bills and utilities, you're left with 80,000ish to for food and whatever else you may need.

Of course, you can land in a situation where your BoE is like sure! and super accommodating and everything works out fine, but that's not common. No one here is trying to crush your dreams, I know cats are the cutest seriously, but when you speak as if ""I'm bringing my cats no matter what"" it can come off the wrong tone, especially when it's towards current JETs who know their stuff and only saying what they've experienced and their advice."

Obvious foods include karaage, french fries, but i can also cook regular cuts like pork chops. My favorite recently is that since there's no pizza around me, just getting a slice of bread, some sauce and cheese on top and its ready in less than 5 minutes. You can even cook things like Sweet Potatoes!"

I admit I haven't used it strictly since I bought it (ex sometimes I go through periods where i don't use it all, then back to everyday) but that's partly because of seeing no results. I mean, nothing has gotten..worse? But I don't know if that's because of the vitamin C or it's just nothing happening lol.

I did read that it's definitely a very slow progression over time, so let's keep using!"

CompetitiveTFT,fmngwii,t1_fmmytoy,1586225787.0,"I mostly play for the Plat border, so I reached Plat in Set 1 and didn't play Set 2, now just hit Plat again from placements over the weekend.

I forced Void Brawlers every game but if you don't have Seraphs + QSS at least on Vel, it's poop. Demo Charge isnt as good as Morello's because the healing debuff and burn is super important early, and later you'll be melting them anyways where the stun won't matter much.

The 8th slot I suffered a bit because at first I didn't watch anyone play the comp or read any guides, so I assumed I could just splash Ekko for Infiltrator buff with Kha, but found way more success using a 2nd cho if you can't 3 star, just so you can have more beefy boys to eat hits while your Vel'koz gets more ults off or your Cho ults."
JETProgramme,fmn7e0w,t1_fmn5zxl,1586219771.0,"Yup, one of my schools I have to walk to the station, take the train, and then walk 20 minutes to school. On days I go to BoE, it's a 30 minutes walk from my house. 

I think a lot of ALTs have 20-30 minute walks in their schedule, and yeah a lot of placements ban driving, and taxis will not be reimbursed. Just want to give OP a good idea of the situation here."
JETProgramme,fmn510g,t1_fmn3pu9,1586218347.0,"While the other person said that all their schools have elevators, none of my schools nor my city have one, which tends to be the case with many JET placements as they tend to be more rural than urban.

Also, there are often times where you can have four periods in a row, such as 1 2 3 4 in the morning from 9am to 1pm where you will have very little time to rest."
JETProgramme,fmn37fq,t3_fw9ooz,1586217252.0,"While I have absolutely no idea, to be honest, I think it could. In ALT life, and ESID, there will be times where you will have to stand for long periods of time, whether it be during classes (nearly an hour) or during ceremonies and such. It isn't uncommon to have to walk from the office up 3 or 4 floors to your classrooms, in addition to having short periods of time (5-10 minutes) to get from one class to another, which again could be back from floor 4 to floor 1. There is a lot of walking and standing on the job, and anyone here who forgot their school shoes or are at a visit school and has to wear the shitty school slippers for the entire day, will know the feet pain.

I don't want to discourage you as I've read about many people with some sort of physical issue being accepted, but be aware of the possibility that when it comes down to deciding, the harsh reality is if it's you vs. someone equally qualified but fully healthy, they'll probably choose the someone. However, whenever you decide to do JET, the application is relatively easy compared to the potential outcome, so definitely still apply!"
