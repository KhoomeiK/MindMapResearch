MechanicalKeyboards,fpjl6fh,t1_fpj8kyu,1588672664.0,Haha I have a keyboard with gat blues too and I loved it until I had to do online school and it was so loud I could barely hear my lectures over them. Definitely still fun every once in a while but my gat browns are my pick for everyday use.

WatchesCirclejerk,fnmjd42,t1_fnmg59g,1587072480.0,"/uj that‚Äôs a Bremont mb1, designed in collaboration with Martin baker who makes ejector seats for planes I believe. Normal people can only buy the mb2 and 3 which have orange or grey outer barrels. This one has a red outer barrel and can only be bought by people who have ejected from a plane in a Martin baker seat. You have to provide proof and everything so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs pretty rare and/or a collectible.
