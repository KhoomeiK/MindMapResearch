berkeley,foce102,t3_g6l5ab,1587670216.0,"Have taken CS 170 and CS 149 but not EE 120. I think it is a doable schedule but definitely will be difficult to take all and require time management.

If I were to rank them on a scale of 1-10 for difficulty and time spent with 10 being hardest

CS 170: 8/10 Tricky long homeworks and tests.

CS 149: 6/10 I really like this class, most of the work is just lab and final project. Homework and test are not too difficult. Good for robotics!

EE  120: 4-6/10 ? From what I hear it's not too difficult and a reasonable class"

berkeley,fnv1k1z,t1_fnubvvk,1587277261.0,"162 is good but for SWE roles I think 169 might be better. If youâ€™re going to be a developer and build applications, why not take a class on how to build applications and the development practice behind it?

Or do both and use those development and team practices for 162!"
