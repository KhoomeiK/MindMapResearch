UCSantaBarbara,fovuwrr,t3_g9v3r1,1588107948.0,Are you looking to get into accounting? If so pre Econ and accounting will help you find an internship and potentially a job lined up after graduation. The classes are very hard but if you put in the time you will do good. You just have to worry about passing 10a as soon as your enter in your first quarter which is a lot of pressure. If you fail you can retake the final or the class to get in. Also UCSB is a great school and we’re by the beach. I hope this helps. Good luck!
