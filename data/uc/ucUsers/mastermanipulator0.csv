Hashimotos,fp92fym,t1_fp919wj,1588411727.0,Never seen anything written about it. Would love if you could share where you’ve seen it
TallGirls,fp8rzao,t3_gbpurq,1588401041.0,No one has ever commented about my feet size and I’m a size 12. The only time I point it out is when I’ll put my foot next a friend who has tiny feet and be like omg look how crazy this is. Just remember that they’re proportional to your height!
UCDavis,foexg9o,t3_g703dc,1587718220.0,Management SUCKS. Really nice to have your own room and bathroom. Walls are extremely thin. Amenities are great. Honestly there are better and cheaper places to live. I lived there my 2 years and I kinda regret it
UCDavis,foexblz,t3_g74tbl,1587718085.0,"If I could find a school with the same amount of research opportunities, noncompetitive nature, extensive majors/classes, low-ish tuition I would not attend davis. It’s too boring for me but I can’t let the city take away from the great academics."
Hypothyroidism,fo8xgjd,t1_fo876lu,1587605892.0,Yeah definitely I think I’ll be switching artificial sweeteners even though I barely ever use them!
Hypothyroidism,fo85vpg,t3_g68r35,1587590453.0,Hmm interesting. I just read the entire paper and they only mention one case in one woman so it definitely could’ve just been coincidence. They do state they had results that confirmed this in animals but with only one human case this paper cannot be taken as 100% proved.
UCDavis,fnnfgsb,t1_fnnagl8,1587091147.0,"To me biosci is way too broad and general biology didn’t really appeal to me. On top of that, I was introduced to biotechnology in high school and immediately became interested in it. I love that my specialization allows me to take such a broad range of cool classes from wine making to fermented foods to recombinant Dna cloning. I really feel like biotech is changing the world and is a little more specialized than general biology. It’s also cool because it relates to so much—food, medicine, plants, animals and so on. I just really feel like it’s the forefront of science and technology"
UCDavis,fnjvzef,t1_fngfger,1587008299.0,Yes! But you don’t have to take it before taking all the other classes. It’s a requirement to graduate but it’s not a prerequisite for anything
UCDavis,fnjuaj7,t1_fni8ier,1587007152.0,Microbiology and fermentation
askscience,fnghxkp,t1_fng3lt0,1586932787.0,COVID is a RNA virus and HIV is a retrovirus meaning that it actually integrates into your DNA
UCDavis,fngecoq,t3_g1llvb,1586929649.0,Ask me anything! Graduating this quarter with a degree in biotech
UCDavis,fmxxagw,t1_fmxwvn2,1586473704.0,For 6 units last summer it cost me ~$1200. I got some grant or something without even applying
Hashimotos,fmvi5qd,t3_fxnt6t,1586417841.0,Sounds like keratosis pilaris
glutenfree,fmtiqsj,t3_fxam51,1586373419.0,I used schars shortbread cookies for a crust and it turned out amazing last week!
AskWomen,fmj0s0r,t1_fmin6tw,1586120735.0,Wow I have never heard of this and I think you just introduced me to something awesome. I’m purchasing ASAP
