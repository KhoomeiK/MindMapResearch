TeamSolomid,fpm6jod,t1_fplyda2,1588726584.0,"Please God no. . . all the best to Spica but his last performance in the LCS made me think he wasn't quit up to the task YET. Are there any indications that he is now? 

If someone wants to explain to me how Spica is an improvement over Dardoch feel free, I'm trying my best to keep an open mind!!"

TeamSolomid,foutksa,t1_fouawj2,1588090177.0,That’s a really interesting point . . . If DD was for sure on the roster next split doublelift definitely would have mentioned being excited to play with him AT least once right? Good point!
TeamSolomid,fomc1w2,t1_fom7fwv,1587884711.0,"Got it, thanks!"
TeamSolomid,fom60uc,t3_g0rki4,1587879331.0,"Can someone explain this DD being toxic thing? I haven’t heard anything bad about his toxicity since being on TSM, I thought he got it under control so I’m pretty confused at where this is coming from. Any links to sources or something?"
UCSantaBarbara,foe1j8q,t3_g6spli,1587694211.0,I want to buy this!!!

TeamSolomid,fmu70cn,t3_fxgjne,1586385754.0,PURGE THE STAFF!!!!!!!!!! FFS WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE TIME?
UCSantaBarbara,fm13i2c,t3_fsfonz,1585671316.0,I'm in the same boat for my ARTHI class . . . this sucks! Have you heard back yet?
