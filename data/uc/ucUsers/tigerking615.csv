DIY,fnyo9re,t3_g4980v,1587369575.0,"We're trying to make a decorative lazy susan that shows wine corks. Something like [this](https://www.wineenthusiast.com/wine-cork-lazy-susan-kit).

If we start with a simple wooden lazy susan from Amazon (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Lipper-International-1118-Kitchen-Turntable/dp/B008DCH9A6/)) and put a glass slab on top, does anyone have a recommendation for a good way to seal the sides so everything stays in place? We could just plop the glass on top like a wood-glass sandwich with corks in the middle, but I don't think it would be very stable. Is there like a strip of bendy acrylic or something like that I can easily put around the side to wrap it all in place?"

DIY,fnu4z91,t1_fntz0vj,1587254652.0,"We'd like a glass or acrylic layer on top of the corks so it's a flat surface though. A tray like the one you sent might not be deep enough, so there'd be a gap between the glass top and the lip. Other ones I've found are too deep, so the overall height is high and the glass would end up below the lip."
DIY,fntwpup,t3_fzycq6,1587250053.0,"We'd like to build a lazy susan that displays wine corks. Something like this: https://www.wineenthusiast.com/wine-cork-lazy-susan-kit. We're thinking of using some sort of wooden base with corks arranged on it and then a glass or acrylic layer on top from tap plastics or somewhere.

Right now we're struggling a bit to find a good way to do the top part. We've found some wooden trays at the size we want (18""), like https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Serving-Cut-Out-Handles-40405cm/dp/B07TWZTN3R/, but they all seem really tall (that one is 2"" tall, and a wine cork is 3/4"" wide, so we'd need to get a really thick glass if we want the final surface to be level with the edges. And that's awkwardly high for a lazy susan on the dinner table.) Ideally we'd want something with a 1"" lip, but for some reason that seems really hard to find.

The other option is to just use a slab (possibly already attached to a lazy susan mechanism, like this one https://www.amazon.com/Lipper-International-1118-Kitchen-Turntable/dp/B008DCH9A6) and putting a glass case over it. I've looked for round glass display cases with flat tops. What I want is something like https://i.imgur.com/DXRhhqT.jpg (though larger, shorter, and with a weight-bearing flat top), but I can't really seem to find that anywhere. Is there a name for the thing I'm looking for, and if so where can I get it? If not, is it possible to custom order something like that?"
