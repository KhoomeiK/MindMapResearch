I'm reading one post that is accusatory and overly aggressive to a community that is likely not perpetrating the catcalling with a highly downvoted comment that says ""this is shitty but is this post helping?""

On the other hand I'm reading this post which merely points out that there is a lot of partying without accusing anyone in particular and an upvoted comment that belittles the poster for even bringing up the issue. People's lives are at stake and people are quick to brush this post off as ""empty"" yet get up-in-arms at the comment in the other post.

CODWarzone,fozw3cx,t1_foztrmo,1588197898.0,Completely fair points. I’m more arguing that it’s an overarching problem that also extends to the revolver - and I think you have a point in that the revolver is practically useless before you get the right attachments so leveling it up is more tedious than say the Grau.
CODWarzone,foztft4,t1_fozsyej,1588196553.0,"Hm. Personally I don't take a gun into Warzone unless I have the attachments I want, so to me it's just standard procedure to farm xp in plunder/multiplayer (during free weekends)

Screenwriting,fo4on79,t1_fo4odo1,1587508249.0,I think sometimes you can spot these things in other scripts but it’s hard to spot in your own. I bet after these lectures the students would have been able to watch a shitty movie and be like “that exposition is so obvious” but be unable to spot it in their own script.

Screenwriting,fo4lpz4,t3_g5nyss,1587506701.0,"So what I’m not understanding here is that they wrote FULL FEATURE LENGTH SCRIPTS and this is the first time you’ve read any of them or any part of them? 

Correct me if I’m wrong but that’s what I’m reading from your post. They should be turning in scenes before pages before acts before scripts. You should be helping them workshop as they go. You’ve put them in a spot where their entire script is riddled with errors they could have been working out of their scripts piece by piece, but imagine trying to do that for a whole script. It’s daunting.

I suggest you focus on just one act for a beginning class like this. Would you rather they finish the class with a great first act or a messy/sloppy full length script? I know which I would rather have."

“damn, overshot it... just a little left... too far, shit.... just a little more right.. god dammit I’ll just go inside”

That’s how I see it going in a lot of games. Doom gets away with it because it’s not a tactical shooter and there are no scenario’s like this. Plus just aesthetically this would be very silly for a lot of games that are trying to go for some level of realism.

EDIT: I guess after rereading you mentioned movement acceleration which would probably nullify my point but imo having one button to sprint is much easier and probably more fluid than acceleration"
