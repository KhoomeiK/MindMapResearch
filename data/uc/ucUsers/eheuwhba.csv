To preface this, I think that all the racism targeted against Asians during these times is wrong and distasteful. No one deserves to feel targeted or scared.

However I am to address your comment using my experiences at UCSD before the world went insane.

One more point is that before anyone thinks I am targeting Chinese, I am Chinese myself. I am the child of two immigrants from mainland China who came to this country with nothing. Therefore I do not hate Chinese people; I love the culture, the trips I have taken there, and most of my family still lives there.

What I do find myself irritated by are Chinese international students. Again take this statement with some caution as I understand this is a blanket statement that does not represent every student. I have met many great friends from China here at my time at UCSD, but at the same time I have met even more bad apples.

Let me elaborate:

For most Chinese international students, they come from very privileged backgrounds. They are sons and daughters of rich business men/women, government employees, etc. And to even make it out of the country to study abroad, there has to be a good enough amount of wealth to come study in the states. Now there are cases where this isn't true and families aren't well off, but those are rare cases. Also in those cases, those students are brilliant individuals which I fully respect as they don't really apply to the grievances I'm about to discuss.

One of the things that annoys me the most is how the international students attempt to flaunt their wealth. They show up with brand new luxury cars and hypebeast clothes. There is one kid with a Porsche that I have seen on multiple occasions driving like an asshole going way too fast and close to people and bikers on campus. First off slow down before you hurt someone else, and second of all we all know that mom and dad bought you that car. I get that you come to a new country and you need a car for transport. Thats fine. Show some humility and buy a Honda Civic for Christ's sake when you obviously didn't make that money yourself.

Second, when I see all these internationals wear hypebeast clothing, I just laugh. You don't understand true street wear culture whatsoever and just wear it to look cool. Imagine if these kids were dropped into south central LA wearing what they wear. However everyone is allowed to express themselves it's a free country so do what you want. Just know that the fact you're flexing a Supreme bogo hoodie and yeezys doesn't impress me.

Those are just minor personality traits and really isn't enough to totally hate someone. What really bugs me is etiquette. Now everyone shows up late to class from time to time, but it seems internationals don't understand the idea of not causing a disturbance. Too many times have I seen an international students being loud and disruptive walking into class late just to sit down next to one of their friends and chat for the rest of the class. That is not only disrespectful to the professor, but all your fellow classmates. But sure every class has people who talk and are disrespectful. Even now on zoom, there seems to be a influx of internationals interrupting the professor while they are talking and not muting their mics so that the whole room can listen to whatever they have playing on tv behind them.

Finally the last aspect that grinds my gears is the fact that many of them are not here on legitimate grounds. There are many college application agencies in China that do the whole college application process for them which is not necessarily wrong as we have college consulting here in the US, but in China they write your essays for you and claim classes and scores that are false and never taken by the student. Now again I am not saying this is true for everyone, but it definitely is not a small operation/issue. I have family friends from China that have confirmed this is the case for many individuals. And even now there are services to help individuals write their essays for them. I know this exists because I saw an ad on WeChat just the other day advertising this exact service. If you're here to simply pay and get a degree, that is distasteful and dishonorable.

In general this is an issue that me and my other Chinese American friends have discussed before. When people ask I do not say I am Chinese, but always specify Chinese American. Why? It is because I do not want to be associated as a rude, untrustworthy, and spoiled person. My family came here poor and had to work our way up and my family's story is not unique. This is the story for just about every immigrant family here in America. This is why I am proud of my country yet am rooted in my heritage at the same time. I grew up seeing my parents struggle to adapt being away from their home, so I choose to work hard and work honestly because that is how I was raised. And that's why when I see an international student it angers me so much. We are not the same. I did not have the same privileges and as a result it pisses me off when people also assume I fall under this identity.

So if you made it this far congratulations. You might resonate with what I said or think I am a spiteful person. You are allowed to hold your opinion just as I have expressed mine. Now in the context of this post, what has been done is indeed a very noble and generous act of kindness. And again not every Chinese international student is as I described. There are some truly kind, genuine students simply here to learn and work hard for a better life and I wholly respect that. I am sorry for being grouped altogether."
