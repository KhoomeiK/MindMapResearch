chanceme,fpfay97,t1_fpeu53w,1588566113.0,Well yea that makes sense but you wouldnt choose McCombs over any HYPSM. Only mit has an undergrad biz out of these schools but you are still 10 times better off in the business industry from a random degree from any HYPSM schools over UT.
UCSantaBarbara,fpbiq7r,t1_fpbhadb,1588470936.0,"Lmfao so what do you want to do? Has it ever occurred to you that if everyone followed precautions and started testing aggressively, the mess would not be this big? Also i have never seen an argument made for people dying because of the economy shutdown lol. Why do you keep emphasizing that we know this virus is not nearly as deadly as initially though to be? No one thought it was deadly in the first place. Like who have you been talking to?? I was one of those people freaking out about the virus in late January. I was never scared for a second that I was going to die. I was scared something like this may happen. The virus is highly contagious and if we reopen the economy, things will become a MASSIVE shit show my man. Look at countries like South Korea. Everyone started practicing social distancing and they tested aggressively and they are slowly reopening the economy. We reopen the economy? Everyone gets infected, hospitals over flood and cannot provide treatment so more people die. It WILL become a massive shit show.

Edit: I just reread your comment and bursted out into laughter lmao. People dying from famine? Any sources on that? Stimulus checks anyone? Sure everyone is taking a pay cut but famine?? In the United States of America? Lmfao"
UCSantaBarbara,fpbdafx,t1_fpbawkq,1588467386.0,"It has always been noted that the disease indeed is not dangerous. However, the diseases changes every time it infects someone and we dont know how deadly it might become. Also, no one sensible is scared that they are going to die from the virus lol. What people are scared of is the fact that they may catch the virus, and spread it to their parents, grandparents or younger siblings unknowingly. You wouldnt be this retarded if you had immune compromised family members living together."
ApplyingToCollege,fpbc07n,t1_fpbbsx6,1588466578.0,"Less true for stem, but relatively I did hear schools like Stanford and Harvard are not as rigorous as MIT or Berkeley. It is not that schools like Stanford or Harvard are easy per se, but schools like Berkeley, MIT just have insane grade deflations. All relative."
ApplyingToCollege,fpb9jzh,t1_fpb90qo,1588465034.0,"Yea just a heads up! Im trying to break into Finance and it really is hard. Keep that GPA up and land 2-3 stepping stone internships and network non-stop! ND is definitely the good choice over USC. Wall Street and the business industry in general are prestige whores. I was one of those people that wanted to go to a more relaxed school so I chose a low tier UC thinking that I will graduate top 1 percent and land a prestigious job, but soon realized it is almost impossible bc the industry is so prestige obsessed lol. So I had to transfer lol. GL at ND!"
ApplyingToCollege,fpb8a8u,t1_fpb7z2v,1588464239.0,"ND is fantastic bro. But if you DID get into harvard or yale and want to get into the finance industry, you chose the wrong school buddy. You can literally major in anything at HYPSM and break i to wall street. Btw pretty sure ND is not the number one undergrad biz. Wharton, Stern, Haas, Kelley, McIntire all come into mind. I think ND is top ten tho. Congrats anyways!"
ApplyingToCollege,fpb7po1,t1_fpas6ts,1588463883.0,I can guarantee you that Yale and Harvard will be an easier time thn ND lol. HY r famous for grade inflations

chanceme,fo4q4fh,t1_fo4oxnd,1587509059.0,"I dont think they will factor that in. Look up ucla psychology transfer admission and see what it says. For economics major, it says that it is HIGHLY recommended that I finish pre reqs by Fall. If it doesnt say that for psychology, who knows you might get in."
berkeley,fo4kpzs,t1_fo4k96m,1587506187.0,"I dont regret going to ucr because I hd a BLAST. It was really hard to leave behind all the friends I made. The hardest part about transferring for me wasnt the studying, it was trying to take classes at ucr and trying to finish up the pre reqs while the advisers at ucr kept telling me to finish pre reqs for the ucr major. If you are set on transferring just go to the CC 100 percent. CC also has transfer programs that significantly boost your chances. PM me if you want more details!"
chanceme,fo4k0dj,t3_g5lqnv,1587505819.0,"Not gonna lie chances are slim because UCLA psychology is HIGHLY impacted and you have not finished pre reqs by fall. Im also a transfer applicant and was accepted to uc berkeley. However, I have one pre req finishing right now during spring, so I am anticipating a waitlist or a rejection. Pre reqs by Fall is really important for UCLA for some reason. Ig there is so much competition that they wanna filter out whoever doesnt have the class completed."
berkeley,fo4i4iz,t1_fo4d9dm,1587504837.0,"I went to UCR with the intent of being a top dog there. I breezed through my classes and got an A+ in like 8 of the classes I took there and realized I wanted a better challenge. Job prospects are really bad for economics major at ucr in my opinion. If you are in engineering, or planning on going to grad school, UCR is fine but if you want to major in econ or biz, go to CC."
coys,fo0skhd,t1_fo0pyxo,1587418976.0,Whats ur point lol. Hes a dick. The girls side made the statement that they are indeed dating but Son denied everythin. Im not saying I dont understand why he did that lmao. Thats just a dick move.
coys,fo0nw12,t1_fo0l9to,1587416509.0,I guess what I said wasnt really clear. I meant that why go on dates if you clearly made it known that you wanna focus on soccer and not have any girls in your life until you retire.
coys,fo0kmds,t1_fnz8ou0,1587414833.0,"You are not making any sense within the context of what Im saying. I never said its not normal lmao. Imagine this. You are somewhat famous and you date a star athlete female whos hailed as a Goddess in your country. You guys go on dates and try to keep everything lowkey, but get busted from paparazzis. Now the media pressures you to give them an answer and for the love of your significant other, you take courage and say that yes you are in the beginning stages of the relationship. But your SO denies everything because of her reputation lmao. Possibly because of her father telling her to. Imagine how shitty that feeling is lol. I love Son as a soccer player, but he indeed is a dick. Stop sucking his cock and try to understand what Im saying is pretty reasonable r/coys"
coys,fo0jgbg,t1_fo004gp,1587414232.0,"Its not THAT controversial because Son was just a soccer player, BUT it became a controversy because of the fact that Son just flat out denied everything while the girl’s company released a statement saying that they were in the beginning stages of the relationship."

coys,fnz0zle,t1_fnz0gi2,1587382815.0,"Uhhhh no. Its a very common thing for Korean celebrities to go on secret dates. The paparazzi discovered them and Son got busted. He had no intentions of letting anyone know. Trust me I am Korean lol. It was a controversy when it happened, but obviously yes Son is hailed as a God in Korea and everyone just forgot about the incident.

Also i dont get what ur saying lol. If he wants to hold out why would he choose to go on dates lmao."
coys,fnz0bqe,t1_fnz043r,1587382199.0,"Yea but he chose to go on dates with this Korean idol girl named Minah. They were seen together holding hands multiple times. When the media asked both of them, the girl answered that they are in the beginning stages of the relationship but Son denied it lol."

It was a start up entertainment company that paid about 20 per hr for just generic office work. It was related to my major because I was using excel a lot and used a lot of knowledge on facebook ads to maximize ticket revenues for local concerts. Learned a lot about entrepreneurship because it literally was two ucr alumnus who started the company. PM me for more specific questions. I have been emailing people some useful resources! I also strongly recommend you to check out Starting Point mentorship and Berkeley Tap.

ApplyingToCollege,fnpxv6f,t1_fnpxlg7,1587153980.0,"Yea if your family qualifies for that much financial aid, then as a pre schooler you are free to claim that you will attend stanford for free lol. Just dont go around telling people you got a full ride which indicates an acceptance and a scholarship offer."
berkeley,fnpxbgw,t3_g2obc4,1587153695.0,"According to most of my pre med friends, having a hospital on campus is not that big of a benefit as people may think. I heard most pre meds binge their volunteering hours during the summer anyways. I think you will find more interesting research at Berkeley as opposed to UCLA. In kind of a similar position as you. My girlfriend is trying to choose between LA and Cal so I have been asking my friends at both schools."
ApplyingToCollege,fnpv4dg,t1_fnptwzi,1587152558.0,"Like I said, she never claimed an acceptance to USC. I do not see where she claimed she got a full ride either. It is not the same as a six year old claiming he got a full ride at harvard. A six year old can claim that he will most likely go to Harvard for free because of financial aid. OP specifically said USC is free. She did not mention ANY full rides anywhere in the post. Also, this is something that ticks me off. 90 percent of the people claiming “full rides” on this sub do not have actual full rides. Most are from financial aid.

Also,I think her point was that she has an option to apply to USC because it will be tuition free. She probably pointed this out because the main point of this post was that her dad will not be paying for a non Christian uni."
ApplyingToCollege,fnpuh80,t3_g38apw,1587152223.0,"I see a common misconception from rising seniors. The idea that UCLA will be easier than Cal is RIDICULOUS. Especially for pre med. Like you said, ucla is a pre med machine meaning there are more pre med students. This means that classes will be difficult for both schools, because you are competing with your classmates in a class graded on a bell curve. Cal is more difficult than ucla in some departments such as chemistry, eecs, econ etc. Pre med majors will be roughly the same. Also, having a hospital sure does help, but most pre meds binge their hospital hours during the summer. Most of my pre med friends just focus on academics and club participation during the school year. Having a med school on campus will not have as much benefits as you think you will. Also, yes UCLA food is great. I visit my friends once a month to eat their dining hall food, but Berkeley has much better food in the city. UCLA only has franchise restaurants like chick fil a around the area. This may sound like a bias cuz im a big Cal advocate LOL. But a point for ucla, I do not think its stupid at all for you to consider your boyfriend as a deciding factor. The common idea is that it is usually a bad idea to choose a school for a significant other. However, if we are talking about ucla vs uc berkeley, not ucr vs stanford LOL. If you think what you have with your boyfriend will last a long time then go for it and go to ucla. Tell him to transfer into ucla lol. Btw as you said its prtty hard to meet unless you guys drive. If you went to USC it might be easier because USC is more accessible to the Union station which as train rides to UCI.

Also, getting selected for verification is no indication of receiving less financial aid. I was selected for the last two years and I get the same amount. Your fafsa is based on your efc."
ApplyingToCollege,fnps447,t1_fnprylj,1587150985.0,Yes she never claimed she was. I think it was a miscommunication. No where does it say she was accepted anywhere. She was being hypothetical most likely. You dont need to be accepted to USC to know whether or not you will have free tuition. Just look at your parents tax forms and see if you qualify.
