COVID19,fpiwnsn,t1_fph1st9,1588650478.0,"My comment targeted methods which should be robust for policy decision making.

I have similar types of concerns related to New York’s lazy methods.  Usc\LA county use extra effort to get a random sample so better surveillance in this pandemic is possible.  It’s not a nationality thing it’s a methodology thing."
COVID19,fpgshyt,t1_fpgnoed,1588608708.0,You’re conflating the precondition motivations with result incentive.  Seems a reasonable assumption that those with a respiratory infection would behave differently to a covid19 surveillance study.
COVID19,fpgchk6,t1_fpdc1gg,1588599814.0,Small scale trials with same protocols are a necessity in this pandemic as case counts dwindle slowing enrollment. Common DMC makes sense too.
COVID19,fpgbsha,t1_fpga99s,1588599370.0,The half return rate seems treacherous since those who were sick may be more motivated to perform the test.
Workbenches,fpdc6ju,t3_gcq92v,1588524104.0,I customize everything I build to my arm length since I’m the 99% of the use.  Cardboard or scrap mockups help test.
DIY,fpd9042,t1_fpd6k6e,1588522294.0,OP asked if they should inspect.  A tester on outlets for ungrounded issues is prudent given an apparent missing ground.  Stopping as you suggest may be well intentioned because you’re guessing their next move.
HomeImprovement,fpd7a8f,t3_gcrup3,1588521307.0,Is the $650 needed because the setback incursion triggers a need for a permit (and maybe variance)?
DIY,fpd1uvh,t1_fpc0cgb,1588518042.0,I’m surprised that doesn’t require a conditional use permit in a residentially zoned area.  Maybe 14 is the cutoff if the people live there?
Seahawks,fp9ejh5,t1_fp7hub0,1588424018.0,I’m guessing JS is entirely fine with him testing the market and his offer will still be there.  Maybe even meet some other offers.  Every indication is JS plays square and transparent about the “business” and why the Seahawks make the choices they do.  Some evidence of that is the guys who come back.
SmartThings,fp9e0r7,t3_gc2aan,1588423587.0,For security reasons SmartThings isolates a bunch of devices from our WiFi devices (eg computers used for managing finances).  It’s definitely not the only reason.  But iot is notorious for attack vectors and poor security patches so a bunch of sensors and switches are on zwave.
politics,foue3nk,t1_foud2ai,1588082298.0,We were never at significant odds so a truce isn’t necessary but thanks for the offer.
Coronavirus,fou8hmf,t1_fou5nwb,1588078835.0,Ich bin kein Deutscher.  Your framing is micro (eg a specific family) and mine macro (eg the cost of shut down economies for 18 months).  Policies are global in this pandemic and every state impacts every state.
politics,fou6gqs,t1_fonjl7o,1588077444.0,"I don’t think the gap between us is as large as you think.  I’m applying my first paragraph to the USPS comment at the head of this thread.  A USPS subsidy to support small business benefits the owner not the owners employees so therefore isn’t good policy.  I believe you’re weighting other goals/policies higher in the moment (eg saving usps jobs and rural delivery service).

If that’s so then for you the business subsidy is an unintended consequence of other valid policy goals.  I’m down with that as I’ve already stated.  Having greater specificity helps form better policy.  Maybe USPS bailouts should emphasize rural services not business services.

The only reason I commented is because people promoting priorities shouldn’t use bad policies as justification.  That’s just bs politics.  “Good for small business” is rhetoric and actually not good policy.  Any give away to business is “good for them” That’s my twat-ish point.

Sorry about the union comment.  I had some vague notion about incentives in my head, specifically I’m arguing against mine and have union supporting principles(eg my “first paragraph”).  In the sloppiness of Reddit comments that was unhelpful at best."
Coronavirus,fou5fns,t3_g9m6nc,1588076680.0,Unfortunately we’re going to absorb some mortality and morbidity so people can afford to eat and shelter.

Seahawks,fot2vei,t3_g9c3f3,1588043422.0,It’s business.  Glad he’s looking out for himself.  Happier JS is JS.  Hope he’s a seahawk next season
politics,fomzdjs,t1_fom23gp,1587908324.0,"Fair point.  There are scenarios where I support business subsidies: where they favor the employee not the owner, in asynchronous markets, and monopoly scenarios (e.g roads).

In the usps case it’s merely a wealth transfer related to the narrow “good for small businesses” claim.  I get annoyed when union electricians argue that transfer of wealth from taxpayers to me is good policy.  Stick with your rural argument. If you just want to save union jobs just say that."
politics,fom1a0v,t1_fom032o,1587875598.0,"Lol, nice name calling.  This is a classic case of r/politics.  You’re making wide claims and I’m making narrow claims about usps subsidies to business, the original comment.  I bet generally You dont support business subsidies.  Subsidizing rural America is fine with me.  I’m not making claims about that."
politics,folzwm2,t1_folz471,1587874580.0,"This is a silly comparison.  In almost all areas there aren’t private roads as an alternative.  Email, docusign, google maps, ups, fedex, Dhl, and others provide alternatives to usps.  

It’s a silly argument.  Trump bailing out airlines (a business subsidy) doesn’t indicate that small business needs postal services."
politics,folzd7n,t1_folyl3b,1587874184.0,"Intrinsic to your point is that you want business to be supplied postal services run by the government at below cost.   You want to transfer wealth from taxpayers to a subset that own businesses.  That’s not a policy I support.

If you were making a more nuanced argument that business postage helps pay for fixed costs to subsidize a more deserving constituent I might support your claim.  But you merely seek to help business owners.

Hey,  I like the halo you’re bestowing on me and my peers.  We do employ half the country.  But we don’t deserve the wealth transfer."
politics,folwvvy,t1_folwm2j,1587872430.0,Oh so you want taxpayers to subsidize those businesses.  Got it.  Thanks
politics,folv3ts,t1_folnme2,1587871196.0,My wife and I own two different types of small businesses.  We’d be fine.  Some of her postage would go up slightly.  I could stop paying for a P.O. Box.  Realtors and politicians use junk mail pretty often so they’d have to change.  A shut down seems pretty trivial to small business.  Where’s the ground shattering impact?

Carpentry,fnty97z,t1_fnt0pnv,1587250896.0,Of course you’ll be fine.  Make it so the plastic rips away to maybe lesson the chances that it visits your neighbor.  Stay out of it if the wind blows.  Always have a knife or box cutter so you can cut the plastic if it falls down on you.
glutenfree,fnkzz2k,t3_g286ft,1587044101.0,"This isn’t what you asked for but I’ll leave this tip.  Poor quarantine planning left me without yeast so for our traditional Easter rolls do I used available pancake mix.  I just laid enough flour down to be able to roll them up off the parchment paper.  The sugar and cinnamon dominates the taste anyway.  The family loved them, said they were the best I ever made.  I didn’t tell them they were eating rolled cinnamon pancakes stuffed with brown sugar.  Their “best ever” was a little disappointing but they were easy."
econmonitor,fnkwbb5,t3_g1sv5h,1587041612.0,"Silver lining? People shifted to AMZN, COST and WMT instead of restaurants to meet maslows base hierarchy.  There’s not a good labor market or a consumer driven economy silver lining given the only FDA approved  intervention in the pandemic tool box is a seized economy.

Unless zoom conference call enabled jobs can carry the economy or a new intervention emerges the base models driving narratives are too optimistic.

First HCQ trails should read out over the next couple weeks.  If the primary efficacy signal is weak we’re betting on individuals using google/Apple or some other high participation mechanisms."

Here's a concrete implementation approach:  Seems like building a synthetic SP500 index like portfolio that under weights brick and mortar retail exposure (BBY,  FRT, maybe GAP, KIM, SPG, LB, REG, maybe ROST, Maybe TJX) would over perform the next two years."
politics,fndlmmu,t1_fnd2cap,1586872748.0,"There’s zero relevance to donors in my comment.

My comment is simple.  Take an element of the new deal and see if it has a chance of passing in the most favorable location in the representative democracy.  

The green new deal calls for retrofitting all buildings.  Read the text please.  Look at the levers proposed to solve the problem.  Then assess whether that’s policy that 1) is the highest leverage to solve the grave problem and 2) Has a chance of passing in Portland and other very favorable locations.

You got me on wanting to solve the problem by passing law.  I’m guilty of being action and results oriented.  Rhetorical discussion, lost elections, and senate resolution losing 57-0 do nothing for me.  I’d like to wait thirty years until demographics change the electorate but that’s not timely and high risk.  I’m practical. Guilty as charged.

I get the donor problem.  That needs to be solved too.  Pick pieces and attack that too.  It’s not the same law change so you’re needlessly complicating the solution.

Please run for an office.  Any office.  Then fix a problem.  Or support candidates and policy that will be difference makers.  Don’t just talk rhetorically about idealized solutions and criticize those seeking policy that moves the needle."
politics,fnawi4u,t1_fnaj8f5,1586805057.0,"Green new deal couldn't pass the Portland city council let alone pass the Senate.  

If the Portland City council [can barely mandate signage for unsafe buildings](https://www.portlandmercury.com/blogtown/2019/10/23/27357274/city-council-poised-to-overturn-controversial-earthquake-unsafe-building-sign-policy) when life preservation calls for immediate upgrades. Why do you think the Senate would ever agree to  national upgrading of buildings as required by the green new deal (i.e.,  search for ""upgrading all existing buildings in the United States"" in HR109 -116th congress)

Or have you not read what the green new deal requires?"
politics,fnau8av,t1_fnaqbhw,1586803914.0,"Yes, the best bet is some combo of my 3 and very high participation in an effective Apple/Google tracing venture.   

My point is the cuomo headline is focused on weekly death rate not the marathon.

politics,fnapusi,t3_g0mw1u,1586801712.0,"What made the peak in deaths true was a very undesirable locked down economy.  The world's best options for containing spread/deaths are:

1) Lock down economies.  This sucks.

2) Vaccines, this won't be true for months unless we get lucky with BCG Vaccine (e.g., [NCT04328441](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04328441))

3) Some new prophylaxis strategy (e.g., partial, perhaps individually driven, economy lock down + massive testing + hydroxychloroquine for high risk individuals assuming it's effective (e.g., [NCT04328961](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04328961), [NCT04331834](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04331834)).
