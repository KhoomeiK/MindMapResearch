The people turned to the Ghost Dance ritual, which frightened the supervising agents of the BIA. Those who had been residing in the area for a long time recognized that the ritual was often held shortly before battle was to occur.[\[14\]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ghost_Dance#citenote14) Kicking Bear was forced to leave Standing Rock, but when the dances continued unabated, [Agent James McLaughlin](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/James_McLaughlin_(Indian_agent)) asked for more troops. He claimed the [Hunkpapa](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hunkpapa) spiritual leader [Sitting Bull](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sitting_Bull) was the real leader of the movement. A former agent, [Valentine McGillycuddy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Valentine_McGillycuddy), saw nothing extraordinary in the dances and ridiculed the panic that seemed to have overcome the agencies, saying: ""The coming of the troops has frightened the Indians. If the [Seventh-Day Adventists](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church) prepare the ascension robes for the Second Coming of the Savior, the United States Army is not put in motion to prevent them. Why should not the Indians have the same privilege? If the troops remain, trouble is sure to come.""[\[15\]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ghost_Dance#citenote15)

Nonetheless, thousands of additional U.S. Army troops were deployed to the reservation. On December 15, 1890, Sitting Bull was arrested for failing to stop his people from practicing the Ghost Dance.[\[16\]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ghost_Dance#citenote16) During the incident, one of Sitting Bull's men, Catch the Bear, fired at Lieutenant ""Bull Head"", striking his right side. He instantly wheeled and shot Sitting Bull, hitting him in the left side, between the tenth and eleventh ribs;[\[17\]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ghost_Dance#citenote17) this exchange resulted in deaths on both sides, including that of Sitting Bull.
