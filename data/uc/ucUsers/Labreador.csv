As for the college experience, its usually chill but this year was kind of a shitshow with everything going on"
UCSC,fpm3hjn,t3_ge9hdg,1588724800.0,"Depends on the party but no one‚Äôs gonna bully you into taking/using any drugs. People pop shrooms, acid, sometimes molly, but its not too common on campus, those typa drugs are usually used off in parties out in the woods"

UCSC,fob4kcd,t3_g6gob6,1587656045.0,"Oakes pros:
-a lot of people are friendly
-great views
-close to the arboretum
-oakes cafe is always good
-good amount of diversity
-CSOs rarely visit, so its kinda hard to get written up by them
-oakes path is nice to walk through during the day

Oakes cons:
-far from everything, even Oakes
-super progressive white people who kiss ass to poc and tend to be anti-white towards other white people (like this doesn‚Äôt affect me but why do people do this???)
-you‚Äôre gonna hear the word ‚Äúghetto‚Äù a few times in reference to Oakes from people who‚Äôve never even been there
-we don‚Äôt have a generator so if there‚Äôs a campus-wide power outage then rip Oakes
-oakes path can be kinda spooky at night"

I sat in my brother‚Äôs gaming chair and some dude dm‚Äôed me complimenting it, we had a nice back and forth for a sec

Also talking about animal crossing is pretty much guaranteed at least one person‚Äôs attention, from my experience"
UCSC,fnbdnvp,t3_g0pxxl,1586813684.0,"Yeah oakes is far from everything, even oakes, but you get used to it"
UCSC,fn54v4f,t1_fn53nk7,1586655969.0,Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure it was just to get a rise out of me but I just paid it no mind
UCSC,fn4npe4,t3_fzkcrb,1586645123.0,"1. I‚Äôve been living at Oakes which is right next to RCC, I know a few right-wing people at ucsc but I haven‚Äôt seen anything extreme, especially on the west side of campus (where oakes and rcc are)

2. If you‚Äôre POC, you‚Äôll experience a few micro-aggressions here and there but they aren‚Äôt enough to make you feel unsafe (in my opinion). I‚Äôm a black dude and I‚Äôve had my fair share of run-ins with blatant and subtle racism at ucsc, I‚Äôve had a crowd of people walk right by me and say they hate black people (ironically it was at RCC), you don‚Äôt really have to avoid it. Again, it just doesn‚Äôt happen enough to the point where you need to. But that‚Äôs just my experiences and what I‚Äôve heard my POC friends deal with. 

3. The themes don‚Äôt really matter all that much, each college has a theme and stereotypes to accompany it. It doesn‚Äôt really affect much besides the core course

4. I wanna say yes, community-wise you shouldn‚Äôt have any trouble. I know there‚Äôs apartments in Oakes that are LGBT+ themed housing, I think its the Harvey Milk apartments but I‚Äôm not sure

5. Prioritize your classwork. Socializing is a big part of college but make sure you set some time aside to actually get your shit done. A few of my friends are on academic probation because they didn‚Äôt pay their classes any mind, one of them even got kicked out this year. 

That being said, make sure you make some connections within your first few weeks at ucsc. Its super social in the fall quarter and kinda dies out in the winter, so make sure to form your circle of trusted/close friends quick."
UCSC,fn3hktz,t3_fyyy73,1586620886.0,"You pick a college to be affiliated with but you don‚Äôt necessarily have to live there (e.g. being a Crown affiliate but living at Stevenson), it does make it more convenient if you do though 

What whichever college you choose doesn‚Äôt really matter, it‚Äôs all up to personal preference, what college stereotype you feel like you belong in, or whatever college someone convinces you to join"
UCSC,fn1z1m5,t3_fys92s,1586573605.0,"Oakes is accurate, but it should be ‚Äúlatin american, asian, AND black communities‚Äù there really, most of the black people at ucsc are at oakes or in the RPAATH house in Stevenson

Another pro is that CSOs rarely come to Oakes unless someone actually calls them down there

A con is definitely the ‚Äúsuper progressive‚Äù nonPOC who desperately pander to POC students so they can feel better about themselves and so people don‚Äôt see them as racist (when they never do in the first place anyway, but you get suspicious when you see that paranoia)"
