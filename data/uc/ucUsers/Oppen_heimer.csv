UCSantaBarbara,fp59ult,t3_gb34s8,1588321410.0,This isn't just the chem department. The class I'm TAing for is behind on grading because of all the logistical nightmares this quarter has become. It'll work out in the end as your TAs get more accustomed to teaching and working completely remotely.
UCSantaBarbara,foz6ehv,t1_foxtove,1588185453.0,"Still 0. You need a gpa near 4.0 if you even want a chance, and also have to rely on spots opening up, which isn't always the case."
UCSantaBarbara,foxsgfv,t3_ga6gmw,1588154696.0,"Very. Engineering is extremely impacted. If you have another school in the major you want, go to that."
UCSantaBarbara,foxs5sf,t3_ga2ul8,1588154400.0,"In the classes I TA for, students are allowed to make regrade requests if they feel we are being too harsh or if we missed something. You should ask the policy on this."
celestegame,fn8fxh7,t1_fn5ued6,1586740752.0,A lot of the maps shown in this video are on the harder side of the collab (because they look really epic to watch). There's a lot of stuff in there built for people of all skills including those that haven't even completed the game 100%.
