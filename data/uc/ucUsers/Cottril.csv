There was no sustainable funding model for NCAA (which was a main criticism of the measure at the time, since some believed Athletics to be bad at managing funds). 

If they had asked the Chancellor to extend his funding past the 2018 sunset, then maybe he would have done it, but Athletics had to go through the student body, since they wanted student fees to pay for it.

IMO, the small sports and Greek Org scene at UCSC just shows that people find other ways to feel connected at their University."
UCSC,fn7j6c1,t3_g00dzw,1586721385.0,"Tuition is 100% not going to change. Most, if not all colleges/universities across the country, are keeping their tuition the same, since you are still receiving instruction and the credit hours. 

You could probably argue for some student fees to be credited though. But, UCSC is undoubtedly seeing huge revenue reductions due to refunded housing and loss of event revenue, so at least one of their revenue streams needs to be untouched."

*Looks it up.*

Lol, wth, Ezra? Now, don't know if it was a joke/staged, but not looking too good if Miller had to be escorted out of the bar. Have there been any recent developments on this?"

UCSC,fn3ykxw,t3_fyu53b,1586630472.0,"My thoughts:

a) I can see UCSC being more stringent considering that, like many other schools, UCSC’s revenue streams have probably taken a huge hit due to student withdrawals. Also, the big concern with the UC is housing, so I can see them not really giving much thought to improvements to the gym.

b) You would have to make the effort to find information on gym capacity during peak hours, and see if the demand warrants expansion. Money has to come from somewhere, and a new facility is a pretty big capital project. 

c) Money for expansion ( if done through student fees) would probably have to be approved through a campus referendum, which would require the whole campus to vote on it. The UCSC student body has an interesting view on anything related to athletics, and voter turnout has been historically low, so the issue of meeting the voter threshold is also a concern to have in mind."

You can still tell the story of a modern, tech CEO Lex that is still as narcissistic and charismatic like the portrayals of the past. More of an Elon Musk-type than a Zuckerberg type."
