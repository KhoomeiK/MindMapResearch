UCSantaBarbara,fp0sfu0,t1_foth14b,1588215898.0,"UAW 2865 is the local chapter of the union that represents UC grad students and I think other UC employees too, and I think student workers are included? I'm not saying it's definitely not phishy, but the email address is not just a random string of characters."
UCSantaBarbara,foo3x8e,t1_foicadc,1587932012.0,"Physics is a great time here. We have a really social and tight-knit major, and not just for the people who started here as freshman. I’ve made a lot of transfer friends in the past year. I don’t know how the workload compares to physics in other schools, or other majors at UCSB, but I’m a lazy asshole and I’ve survived so far. It’s not easy but it is easy to get help. The physics study room is your friend. 

As for research, I think most of the people I know (myself included) are not doing research but it’s possible to get into if you reach out to professors and all that. But this is a big school with a big physics department and I don’t think there’s a whole lot to go around. 

UCSB has a wonderful atmosphere and I’m so glad I went here. People are friendly, the weather is nice, and the beach is right there. If you do decide to come here, hit me up in the fall and I can direct you towards resources if you need!"
UCSantaBarbara,foo37km,t1_foikhyg,1587931615.0,"I do not party, lots of people I know don’t party either, and we all have a good time socially. No one’s going to, like, ridicule you—if anyone does, you’re in the wrong crowd. There’s tons of stuff to do here besides party. I’d recommend joining clubs and connecting with people in your major. 

As for psych, I’m not a psych major but both of my roommates last year were. There is no psych BA and the BS requires chemistry. One of them just could not pass chem no matter how hard she tried and is now a history major. The other just wasn’t finding it fulfilling and is now a sociology major. That doesn’t mean either of them don’t want to do psych-y things after college but that’s something I’d keep in mind if I were you."
Cubers,fok5fjb,t1_foj3k01,1587835733.0,"Everyone’s replies have left me pretty convinced haha. Thanks for your input, I will check them out! It’s crazy how much the cubing world evolves over time, but I find that really neat."
UCSantaBarbara,fo5goq5,t3_g5jcn5,1587525209.0,"What’s open on campus right now? Like can you go into the lib? The Ucen? SRB? Random classrooms? And just FT and Portola are left, right?"
birding,fno4xj8,t3_g2nbti,1587112220.0,It do be like that sometimes

UCSantaBarbara,fnefigi,t1_fne3myo,1586888451.0,"Ortega is one of the four dining commons, I have a friend who has worked there for 2 years. It's got pretty high turnover but you get to eat for free every one of your shifts. She also said something about a $50/quarter mini meal plan? Idk the details but if you worked there I'd investigate. I think it's still $12/hr and I don't know if it's work study or not. It's the only dining hall not open on the weekends so if you want your weekends free, Ortega is the way to go."
UCSantaBarbara,fnedk8s,t1_fncd7o6,1586887444.0,"6 total? Or 6 per session? Like if I wanted to take 4 units session A and 4 session B, does that count?"
orchids,fnal62m,t1_fnagdgu,1586799399.0,So it's a mystery I guess. We'll see if it's life-threatening or just aesthetic soon enough :( thanks for the input!
orchids,fn94m8p,t1_fn8yqk5,1586759241.0,"This was its first time being outdoors. We had a lot of rain for a few days and then mostly cloudy since then, which makes me think rot rather than sunburn. I think it was probably too much rain /: despite being well drained. But the spots seriously developed like over night, it was fine and then suddenly wasn’t."
plantclinic,fn8fie9,t1_fn89jf0,1586740482.0,As long as it’s not dying I’m happy I guess. It has a bunch of new growths starting and I’d be so sad if it all rotted to death :(
orchids,fn893yk,t1_fn874k9,1586736522.0,That’s pretty similar to my situation minus the rocks :/ well if it survives I’ll add some and see if it makes a difference. Thanks for the info

proplifting,fn71gk3,t1_fn65s6z,1586711445.0,"I cut some vines of ivy off a big plant. Old enough for the stem to be somewhat woody but not so old as to be brittle. I cut them apart to be a leaf and node each, as you can see in the picture. And then I just put them in a little jam jar of tap water and left them on a bright north facing window sill. I change out the water when it starts to get a little low. This is like two or three weeks of progress, I don’t remember. 

When I did this with pothos it took way longer. I think it might be the light. They’re getting lots of bright indirect light all day. Good luck! And like the other commenter said, if you’re trying this with ivy, please don’t plant it outside! They’re quite invasive."
proplifting,fn5faoc,t1_fn5b0o8,1586663350.0,"That’s exactly it, they’re invasive all over my neighborhood—I cut a bunch of strands off a mass of ivy that has completely taken over a little shed in my parents’ yard. The experiment was first to see if I could prop them at all, and then to see if they’d survive as a potted indoor houseplant. 

Don’t worry! I definitely get it, and appreciate and share your concern. Happy propping :)"
proplifting,fn4w7iv,t1_fn4vyqa,1586650314.0,Oh that’s super cool. Well done!
proplifting,fn4vl8s,t3_fzjiub,1586649930.0,What is that? Is the thing with toothpicks in it part of the plant?

UCSantaBarbara,fn0firy,t3_fya9h8,1586540999.0,"I, too, kind of hated it here at first. I also wanted to transfer closer to home. I really did not even start to hit my stride until this, my 3rd year. By spring quarter freshman year I was basically still a lonely almost friendless awkward weirdo—and that was WITHOUT the world ending and keeping us all home. 

I don’t make connections easily at all. It took until this year for me to build up a scattered selection of people I get along with, and even then I’ve still only got a really deep connection with like one. But one is plenty for me :) my point is this isn’t how it’s going to be forever. You still have lots of time and things will get better. I can sincerely promise you that."

stevenuniverse,fmm073k,t1_fmlxsmw,1586196360.0,"She did specifically say horns *reduced*, not gone or anything that would imply that. But I do agree about the show in general that consequences don’t tend to stick as much as I’d like. WD crying about everything being her fault was nice to see her finally acknowledging that, but there still weren’t any consequences for all the harm done by her and for her."
