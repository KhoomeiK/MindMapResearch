AskReddit,foj36kl,t3_g7qe6r,1587806539.0,"No contact. My mom has been verbally abusive, obsessive, manipulative and narcissistic my entire life. I didn’t realize she was wrong until I refused to identify as a Christian and believe in her fucked up idea of what god is. I am currently living my most accomplished life working admin full time at a university, renting a whole home, buying my first car and finding an amazing partner. I’m currently 23 and attained all of this with absolutely no help/approval/encouragement from her."

UCSantaBarbara,fnjyij0,t1_fnjrbeo,1587010061.0,"I was an undergrad at UCSB from 2013-2017 and the bullshittery I would see happen during elections was so frustrating. I was always campaigning for the party opposing OPP, as part of a group who actually would fight for tuition reduction and expand resources to the brown/black and lgtbq community... but UCSB has a predominately white, privileged demographic and that’s the reality of the voting system. AS elections have always been useless to me. Agreed 100"
