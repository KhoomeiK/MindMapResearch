whichbike,fpmee1n,t1_fpmcc5w,1588731253.0,"I think for what you've described it would be a great do it all bike, especially if you can get it for less than $1300, which I agree isn't an amazing price. 

I took a look through Washington DC's Craigslist cross bike prices and I'd say if you can get this bike for under 1100 I'd be pretty stoked personally. Assuming it's in as good condition as it seems from the pictures. 

I really like steel bikes from the 90s and 2000s because most of them are relatively easy for someone new to start working on them. Not a lot of internal cabling, proprietary parts, etc. 

To answer your original question on tire clearance, some google searches through old bike forum posts suggests the Poprad can take up to 32 or 35ish depending on the brand, knob profile, etc."

Given the 1300 asking price, that seems pretty realistic because Craigslisters love to low-ball."
whichbike,fpm94vu,t1_fpkp9rv,1588728098.0,"The Poprad doesn't show up on the site you linked and quite frankly your recommendation of 5-600 for a True Temper OX frame with Red 22 and discs is a joke. This is easily 800+  depending on the area.

You want to connect the headphones to the computer first, with the program you want to use closed.

Then, set the active audio device to Headset using the taskbar sound icon. 

After that, open up the program you want to use, and make sure it's pointing to headset for both mic input and sound output. 

Should work after that. If your headphones disconnect and reconnect, you might have to restart the program you were using because sometimes it'll get confused and not switch back and forth properly."

environmental_science,fo4ch0q,t1_fo2ainq,1587501959.0,"There's actually a huuuuge list of various tricks to keep in mind. Others off the top of my head are stuff like, 

* Identity: appealing to a facet of someone's personality that they hold as an important identity (eg: there is a difference in mobilization when you ask people to ""vote"" vs ""be a voter"" for audiences that see themselves as politically engaged.)

* Default choices: Making a choice opt-out instead of opt-in increases participation wildly. In this case, organ donation participation rates are 90%+ in some countries where you're opted in by default, like when you register for social services. While in the US where you have to purposely opt in to being an organ donor, the participation rate is low, like 15% low. (See:
