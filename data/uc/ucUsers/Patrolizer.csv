UCI,fnrdacd,t3_g2vhsj,1587185571.0,"There's a lot of auxiliary departments that sole purpose is to make the campus function. Without students on campus buildings are being shut down, eateries closed, gym closed, dorms closed, and there's a lot of things that closed down. The University will be keeping everyone employed though the end of June and that costs of money. 

Student employees are currently receiving 64 hours of paid COVID time off. That might change but that's only a few weeks for students that work 20 hours / week."

Sensing your movements and turning in  your direction as you try and find a path around it. After finding a suitable path, you begin to go around the snek only to have it follow you while maintaining the same posture, head a few inches above the grass."

This place has its up and downs. This is the only place that I’ve been chased by a rattlesnake. 

 Near the quail loop a swampy section that grows some very nice flowers. I would highly recommend the second of golden field flowers, it can be quite stunning."

Just like Irish-American would be a specific type of white culture."
