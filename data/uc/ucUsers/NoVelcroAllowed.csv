UCI,fp4uf57,t3_gb80l1,1588307660.0,I think you can call dining to have them transferred until next year given the current situation
UCI,fop39ij,t1_fop335b,1587952117.0,Ok thanks! I won’t be graduating until next Spring but I’ll keep that in mind :)
UCI,fop2np5,t1_fookjvt,1587951737.0,I know I would be cause it’s actually more visible than a decoration on your cap
UCI,fooipip,t3_g8gwop,1587939743.0,You should do this on the side! Plenty of graduating seniors would pay for this just like they do to decorate their caps
UCI,foisogg,t1_foiij01,1587795741.0,Yes but those are apartments I think they just mean two people in one room so for example ACC could have two people in one room and one single
UCI,fnxl0kg,t1_fnx3q24,1587340836.0,Yeah exactly what they said lol
longbeach,fnqmnsk,t3_g3c9xr,1587167691.0,Check out velazquezalma562 on Instagram
UCI,fn90mxh,t1_fn90490,1586755598.0,My focus is education because I want to land a career related to Education Policy
UCI,fn8zmqf,t3_g0bwjb,1586754721.0,"There are three focuses in the major: education, government, and health. I suggest you take the government focus so you can take classes related to your law school interest. The classes I’ve taken so far have focused on issues of social justice and policy making."
UCI,fn46rpu,t1_fn2sv25,1586635202.0,Thank you so much for clarifying! The statement on the schedule wasn’t clear
UCI,fn2jmj1,t3_fywxpq,1586591428.0,I checked the schedule and it says you can still add it but you will have to pay $50. I also forgot and I’m debating whether or not I want to pay the fee lol
longbeach,fmwxthv,t3_fxrwoo,1586454926.0,Where are the pictures?
