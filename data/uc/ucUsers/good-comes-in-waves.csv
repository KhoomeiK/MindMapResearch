LongDistance,fn4ctb9,t1_fn4cgwf,1586638735.0,Thank you 💗 i know many people are feeling the same way as I am. Sometimes crying is the best remedy. You hang in there as well. Stay healthy 💖
LDR,fn4bc47,t1_fn48duu,1586637875.0,Thank you for reaching out 💕 we actually are in college but are from the same home town. We’re about 6 hours apart when in college but we haven’t seen one another since February. We’re both in our home town and he’s literally a 5 minute drive from my house. Our parents won’t let us out at all though so that’s why I can’t see him:( I tried to go on a run but my parents are even strict with that. Thank you for this though I appreciate it
LongDistance,fn4b3dn,t1_fn4afe2,1586637733.0,"you’re right with that 😂 

that’s exactly what my bf tells me! that all of this is crappy but we have a lifetime together. Thank you for sharing💖"
LDR,fn45brv,t1_fn44ex4,1586634364.0,"Thank you💗 yeah I completely feel that. It’s hard knowing “what could have been”. Thank you, you hang in there too."
LDR,fn43w1q,t1_fn3x811,1586633534.0,I hope so but it doesn’t look very likely just because our parents are both really strict about this whole lock down. It just sucks because I haven’t seen him since February and the fact that he’s five minutes away is agony
LDR,fn3vorw,t1_fn3j0kn,1586628828.0,"This is exactly my situation except because we’re quarantining at our parents house, our distance went from 6 hours to 5 minutes! :(("
UCSantaBarbara,fn1n390,t1_fn1dsf1,1586565568.0,Thank you this helps so much!!! That’s exactly how I feel. I feel like everyone one already has their groups and don’t want to add anyone new. This gives me a lot of hope thank you 🥰 I’ll definitely keep this in mind!!!
UCSantaBarbara,fn1ms0d,t1_fn1hlhe,1586565369.0,no I didn’t :( But I got ditched by them too! yeah msg me!!
UCSantaBarbara,fn12s1v,t1_fn1289g,1586553639.0,Hi! Thank you for commenting this. I’ve heard people say that they never found their friends throughout college and that’s okay. I feel like it’s just such a foreign concept that doesn’t get talked about so its perceived to be a “bad” thing. But thank you! I’m really glad that you shared this
UCSantaBarbara,fn0nha0,t1_fmz5wla,1586545192.0,Thank you SO SO much for this. I’m gonna messege you!❤️
UCSantaBarbara,fn0n69x,t1_fmz3xu6,1586545030.0,I’m in clubs that I LOVE but I haven’t really made connections in them yet :( I hope that I will next year though! You’re totally right. Thank you so much. I’m so glad that you found your people !
UCSantaBarbara,fn0n2o1,t1_fn0jhpz,1586544976.0,Thank you! I feel like social media and even high school teachers make it seem like you will make your best friend right away and it was just so weird because I had this expectation you know? It’s just interesting to see how it doesn’t get talked about as much. Thank you so much for this I’ll definitely remember this! I’m so happy that everything eventually worked out for you
UCSantaBarbara,fn0mvjw,t1_fn0firy,1586544872.0,"Thank you so much for sharing this, you’re right it’s just a rough patch and it won’t be my whole time at ucsb. Thank you!!!"
UCSantaBarbara,fn0mg70,t1_fn0faur,1586544644.0,"Wow that’s a rollercoaster, but I’m so glad that it worked out when you were least expecting it. That really shows something! I think next year I’m gonna really try to just do what I want and see who I’ll meet. Thank you so much for sharing this:)"
UCSantaBarbara,fn0mapw,t1_fn07wet,1586544566.0,That’s exactly how I was! It’s hard coming from that type of background and feeling that way. I hope next year will be better for you too💗
UCSantaBarbara,fn0m70e,t1_fn03wgl,1586544512.0,I felt like I was the only one too - social media really makes it look like everyone has their shit together. I’ll do that! Thank you
UCSantaBarbara,fn0m3us,t1_fmz55jg,1586544465.0,I’m sorry it was that way :( I’m glad it all works out though. Thank you I’ll definitely keep working at it! Hearing this really helps:)
UCSantaBarbara,fn0lzpr,t1_fmzip8h,1586544405.0,That’s a great quote. I’ll try to keep that in mind. I think I spent a lot of time stressing over this whole situation especially because I saw people from my Hugh school making best friends. The good thing though is that I learned how to be happy alone :) thank you so much for this!
UCSantaBarbara,fn0luuu,t1_fmz8m52,1586544332.0,Exactly!! I feel like I have “friends” for sure but nothing that really clicks. Yeah that’s what happened to me too. I only hung out with sorority girls because I thought they were “fun” but they ended up ditching me :/ thank you so much I hope so too!
UCSantaBarbara,fn0lpq4,t1_fmz1t4e,1586544256.0,"Wow that’s a really crazy journey, I’m so glad everything worked out for you. Thank you so much for sharing!"
LDR,fmyqyi5,t1_fmypi71,1586493174.0,"I completely understand where you’re coming from with that. And yeah, but we also don’t know where we will do grad school and where our jobs will end up after that. But I do get where you’re coming from 100%. Every LDR is different, no one knows what each couple is personally going through. I hope everything works out well with you & that both you and your SO stay healthy 🥰"
LDR,fmyq3la,t3_fy6sap,1586492490.0,"Hi! I hope that your family and your gf family is healthy🥰some of the most CRUCIAL pieces of advice I give my friends who just started not seeing their S.O. Regularly bc of all this is COMMUNICATION. 

I know what you’re thinking. You’ve heard it a bazillion times, I’m making it a bazillion and one. My bf and I have this “rule” where right when we feel upset about something - we call one another and talk about it AS SOON AS WE CAN. texting sucks in fights, it leads to misinterpretation, which leads to uneasy feelings. If you can’t call then say “hey let’s pause here and talk about it soon on the phone.” Having healthy communication can honestly make or break a whole entire day. I think the first thing is having a relationship with good communication already...if you feel a certain way DONT hold back. You want who you’re dating to be there with you as much as they can when they can’t be there physically.

FACETIME! My bf and I try to ft before we go to bed every single night. Also sometimes random times throughout the day just to be cute! If you have snapchat a fun thing to do is to make a custom story with just your gf and you and throughout the day you both can add to it! I think this is nice because sometimes I don’t wanna spam my bf with snaps haha and it’s a fun little surprise when going through stories. 

Always remind her how you two are IN THIS TOGETHER! There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Remind her that if your love can conquer this that means a lot. Just be there for one another honestly. 

Finally, goodnight texts. Every night my bf and I send one another a cute gn text saying how proud we are of one another for doing so much work, etc. it honestly gives me the most butterflies. 

Don’t be stressed - it’s SO normal to feel sad and uneasy during this time. Stay strong! I hope this helps🥰"
LDR,fmyp6o2,t1_fmylvtb,1586491788.0,Won’t everyone be though in some way or another? Even if it takes longer than it takes me to see mine? I think this is where we need to stop making it a “competition” of who has it worse. Some LDR’s see one another twice a month and that’s amazing. Thank you for recognizing what I meant to say though 💛
UCSantaBarbara,fmyk9cb,t1_fmu4q1f,1586488196.0,SAME HAHAHA
UCSantaBarbara,fmyk76d,t1_fmxwyob,1586488154.0,Yeah I feel that for sure. It’s pretty brutal:(
LDR,fmyjd8f,t1_fmyixaf,1586487573.0,"Yeah I will get to see him...but everyone’s long distance is temporary in some way or another if you close the gap. Just because I see him once every 3 months and we get summer together doesn’t make my daily pain of missing him any less than yours. We still have to live with the fact that at the end of those 3 months we have to say goodbye again. I know how fortunate I am to get summer with my boyfriend, trust me I do. And yeah that is a fact I will get to see him after this is over. But I don’t think it’s fair that even though I’ve been in a long distance relationship for 3 LONG years, you get to put me down because I come from the same home town as him. There’s so many LDR’s that started in high school and they have the same amount of pain. I was supposed to spend my birthday with him but we haven’t seen one another since February...like it’s still a long time. Like yeah I get that 5 minutes doesn’t qualify as long distance but not seeing him since February (when we visited one another in college) to now we’ve been long distance and we will be until we close our gap AFTER 4 more years of long distance. I also agree that if you’re in a relationship with someone and now are in “long distance” because of everything, it’s not long distance. It’s just not. But my situation is"
LDR,fmyigwa,t1_fmyhqly,1586486955.0,"I’m not in a normal distance though, I’m in normally long distance because of college...and no I completely agree. I have friends reaching out to me asking how my bf and I do it because they’re struggling rn. Dude I am in long distance. We go to school far away and I haven’t seen him since February. I know the daily pain of missing my significant other since I left for college. I’m sorry you misinterpreted my comment and I wasn’t clear. Usually I wouldn’t either be in his arms after this is lifted but because both of our colleges are doing online we came home early"
LDR,fmygk71,t1_fmx7xd9,1586485655.0,"My boyfriend and I come from the same home town but go to different colleges. We haven’t seen one another in 2 months but we like 5 minutes apart. Our families are taking the quarantine really seriously, yeah it hurts knowing I can go over so easily - but I can’t. We’re all in pain

Edit: By schools I meant colleges. We’re in our third year of long distance and we go to school 6 hours away!! I get long distance TRUST me. I’ve been doing it for 3 years now. I’m just saying like regardless of the distance, being in an ACTUAL LDR sucks. But I do have to say that regular couples who can’t see one another rn don’t have it as bad because we go through this a majority of the time"
