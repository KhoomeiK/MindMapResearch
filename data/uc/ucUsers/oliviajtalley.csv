UCSantaBarbara,fnudc9y,t3_g3w4j4,1587259595.0,I'm in spanish 6 with sebastian stratan this quarter and he's super chill. he reduced the word count of our essays by like 200 words which was super great. Only problem is I'm just not sure if he's a TA who's only teaching it because it's online. I also had omar figueredo last quarter for spanish 5 and really liked him and I know he was also teaching spanish 6
