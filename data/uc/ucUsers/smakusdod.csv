UCI,fpkwm0s,t3_ge0rkv,1588702302.0,"You kind of think they would have tried this first, before using it live.  Oof.  That's on the professor, and they should just drop the test."
orangecounty,fpkqy78,t1_fpkqf8z,1588699497.0,"We already passed SK testing per capita a while ago.  Our hospitals are not overwhelmed.  Anywhere.  We are only behind Germany now as far as testing goes.  Everywhere I go, everybody is wearing masks and social distancing.  Literally everywhere.  Using a couple of protests full of people risking their own lives (were you forced to participate in the protest?  Are you visiting their restaurant and bars?) as some sort of sign that we can't open responsibly is a bit much, no?  Then you see footage of Newport Beach from above, vs. from the side with a zoom lens, and you realize the media is not on your side.  We can open **responsibly**, and if you give the public the know-how and freedom to do it, they will.  We can handle a few bad apples."

The school system.  They tell you America is bad, the founding fathers owned slaves so they are bad, the entire foundation is bad, our founding literature is bad, etc., and that we have to 'right these wrongs', and that this correction must permeate every medium.  [It's communism's plan to subvert America through the education system](https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/34-years-ago-a-kgb-defector-described-america-today), and guess what?  It's working."
irvine,fp6pubu,t3_gbcdk8,1588356515.0,"All are a failure (and a much broader failure than merely the city level) of general public policy with regard to city planning as it relates to growth, exacerbated by a near complete lack of fiscal responsibility.  It only gets worse when you move into county/state levels.  That being said, keep fighting the good fight.  The easiest initiative would be to demand the city build public-owned internet infrastructure (as you mention), or at a minimum ease a transition to 5G so that Verizon (or whoever) can compete at the household level without having to tear up the streets again (a huge barrier to entry for anybody in both terms of cost, but also lawsuits, regulations, etc., which is why Google gave up in most cities, and why municipal internet sometimes fails to get traction in their own towns!).

As far as green, well, UCI is leading the way there.  Be proud of that.  Encourage UCI to further partner with the city (and in reality, the Irvine Company) to expand their green research projects and technology.  That way, the city gets it for 'free', and UCI benefits from researching on a near metropolis-sized population.  Imagine UCI's little boba delivery robots expanding to the city-level, traveling via Irvine's extensive trail network (another thing to be proud of, and having been a bike commuter for several years, I can tell you there are definitely trail rush-hours!), or via air-drone delivery (another city regulation that would be great to work on!)."

orangecounty,fosqsg6,t1_fosm0il,1588036127.0,"
There is no foolproof way of opening up.  But to stay closed forever is to doom vastly more people to a slower death.  My entire point is to craft opening policy at the most beneficial time from both a weather and seasonal sickness standpoint.  Better to test our capacitance slowly now while we can still roll it back under favorable conditions.

We have a decent understanding of who dies the most.  Of course it will vary genetically, but the basic facts are telling us that if you are under 50 and aren't on any medications, the risk of you dying from covid are extremely low.  

We can craft reasonably policy that let the most hearty get back to a working economy while still being careful for those who are vulnerable or unsure.  If you vape, take metformin, etc., go ahead and stay home!"
orangecounty,fosld29,t1_fosk8w4,1588032993.0,"The risk profile is dictated by who dies from the virus, which so far seems like the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.  You craft policy around protecting them."

orangecounty,fosifxn,t1_fos4lia,1588031334.0,"Do you work?  Do you pay for a mortgage, have kids in college, etc.?  We have to make tough decisions sooner or later.  Better to do it under favorable conditions.  That's what policy making is.  Letting the entire services economy die as we wait for a vaccine is probably bad policy.  We know what the risk profiles look like.  We can make effective policy about opening up while still protecting the vulnerable.  It's not all or nothing."
orangecounty,foshx1t,t1_fos48ph,1588031042.0,We have a pretty good idea of what the risk profile looks like.  Those within the risk profile can still quarantine.
orangecounty,fork0dl,t3_g94poc,1588013522.0,"Ok, it's time for an alternative viewpoint.  At what point in time do you think it's better to 'open'?  I suggest during warm weather at the furthest possible point from the next flu season, and at a time where our hospitals are not overrun.  Oh wait, that's now.  There are people who haven't worked for months at this point.  If you aren't sensitive to that, then you are incredibly privileged."
