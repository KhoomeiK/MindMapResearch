AskReddit,fpm1em3,t1_fpkdju0,1588723589.0,"Once my entire class tried to tell my History teacher she was using ""affect"" and ""effect"" wrong. Went so far as to call in our English teacher who knew we were right but was like ""respect your teacher let her spell it however she wants"""

UCSantaBarbara,fpl509e,t3_ge3cwf,1588706477.0,"According to Gavin Newsom, Friday is just reopening curbside pickup for nonessential businesses. It's just the beginning of Stage 2, but it looks like if we continue to make progress, schools can open in July/August.. even though schools seem more like a Stage 4 thing."
UCSantaBarbara,fpize5u,t3_gdqjdv,1588652442.0,wait what happened?

math,fp8o0n5,t3_gbkybg,1588397584.0,"Does anyone have any recommendations for resources I could use to better understand real analysis? More specifically, I'd like to be able to have a firmer grasp on proofs. I am reading Understanding Analysis by Abbott which is good, but still kinda struggling."
UCSantaBarbara,fp727hv,t3_gbnfaw,1588362702.0,"My sister's CC has reportedly used the funds that the govt just gave out to many colleges to purchase lab kits for students to take home and use. UCs received wayyy more money than the CCs, and only a portion of that was supposed to be given as CARE grants to students. There's still a lot of money left. They should really consider doing the same thing."
UCSantaBarbara,fp3esy8,t1_fp3c1xw,1588278055.0,"I'm grateful, just not to ucsb in this case."
UCSantaBarbara,fp3arbn,t1_fp38tbs,1588276057.0,bold of you to assume they gave it out of good heart and not because it's government mandated
UCSantaBarbara,fost7de,t3_g9dv9m,1588037549.0,"A lot of people go for Santa Cruz in their first year. I lived in San Miguel and I liked it because the floors were small and it wasn't really loud as some others can be. I would recommend a 14 meal plan if you plan on rarely eating out, and if you never go home for weekends, but a 10 meal plan is good if you have food coming from elsewhere. I had 10 meals but that's because I had a fridge in my room."
UCSantaBarbara,foq4wsq,t1_foq3w4r,1587983127.0,"It is engl 23!! Yeah that makes sense because when I run the progress check without WIP, area E is fulfilled but when run it with WIP, it shows a course that I'm enrolled in for the summer. Thank you!"
UCSantaBarbara,fopt4wl,t1_fopcuj5,1587971270.0,what major takes 14 weeks? I'm curious
UCSantaBarbara,foo2s82,t1_fomr6dz,1587931377.0,Thanks!
UCSantaBarbara,foo2onm,t1_fonb02c,1587931322.0,It was area G and E and it won't show up in either one. I don't mind it not showing up in G because I already fulfilled that requirement but it was the last course I needed for E

UCSantaBarbara,fo7y27b,t3_g688lv,1587586510.0,I think it'll show up on GOLD on May 4th. The first two passes happen during spring quarter and the last pass isn't until September.
UCSantaBarbara,fo5o4oz,t3_g5trt5,1587530661.0,Yep. Looks like summer session B is more likely to be online though.
UCSantaBarbara,fo4q59w,t3_g5p8oq,1587509072.0,"I feel you. One of my profs during winter quarter gave us a take-home final and basically allowed us to cheat, work with friends, use the internet etc. It took like 7 hours for me to do because he made it harder than it would've been but it was worth it knowing that no one could destroy the curve since we all had the same advantages. So I think the professors should really consider the fact that people will be tempted to cheat, especially during current circumstances, and they should plan accordingly."
FullertonCollege,fnwuezf,t1_fnwje7c,1587325649.0,"Gee, thanks. Fyi I already looked through the website, & I already signed up. I also did ask others for help. Then you may wonder why I posted on reddit, right? Because even after all that I was unsure of whether I took the right steps and wanted to make sure before it was too late. The steps you listed seemed a little different from what I'd done which is why I asked for the website you would've used."
FullertonCollege,fnwium9,t1_fnvxrk7,1587319206.0,Thank you!! Could you give me the link with which I could enroll?
UCSantaBarbara,fnuqzif,t3_g40syw,1587268829.0,"Math 8 really depends on your professor but the best way to study for it is definitely doing the homework and other similar practice problems.

Also, I just looked through the list of GroupMes and the Math 8 one is ""no longer joinable"" :/"

csuf,fnuj41t,t1_fnubsvq,1587263311.0,So if I'm right fall and spring semesters have a flat tuition rate but for summer it's just per unit?

UCSantaBarbara,fn3vzst,t1_fn3q4vo,1586629002.0,"Dude I haaate those. Y'all have calendars for every quarter, hundreds of posters all over campus and YOU STILL SEND ME EMAILS."
UCSantaBarbara,fn13ieo,t3_fyonb9,1586554060.0,some courses open more seats during pass 2
UCSantaBarbara,fn0skp5,t1_fn072iv,1586547937.0,actually scratch that. they can't make us come back because it sounds like a wonderful reason for a lawsuit. and they do care about money.
UCSantaBarbara,fn0sb4f,t3_fymtp2,1586547794.0,I think at this point you can only get partial refunds but Spectrum is offering free wifi services to students for 60 days so maybe check that out
UCSantaBarbara,fn06msj,t1_fn04km1,1586536388.0,"It doesn't really matter how long it takes. They won't let us back until they're sure it's safe. Unless, of course, they really don't care about us."

UCSantaBarbara,fmxir24,t3_fy07xj,1586465753.0,"6A uses a teensy bit of linear algebra but it's mostly calculus. Since it's online, I assume you should be able to do it pretty easily. Just try not to fall behind."
UCSantaBarbara,fmt6l60,t3_fx9ax5,1586367685.0,the math dept takes a really long time to process change of major petitions but it'll be done before this quarter ends.

mathematics,fmrib0l,t3_fwyyl9,1586324058.0,"Oof. I have no first hand experience to offer, but as an undergrad I'm kiiiind of familiar with what math grads go through at my school (ucsb).
They get paid ~24k per year which sounds good, but it's a lot of work since they have to study for their own exams, while also dedicating a significant amount of time to their undergrad students. The TAs went on strike (at multiple UCs, including mine) this year demanding better pay - covid disrupted it from getting to any resolution.
It takes 6 years to get the degree. 72 quarter units in total."
UCSantaBarbara,fmrcrjb,t1_fmrb639,1586319537.0,"Yeah if you get no fin aid, then the units you take doesn't matter."

Yeah right, most of us are having to take summer classes/being forced to graduate later than expected because of courses we could not manage to add this quarter due to the circumstances."
UCSantaBarbara,fmr79bc,t3_fwxkxl,1586315536.0,lol I'd take so much advantage of this situation
UCSantaBarbara,fmr5ap7,t3_fwy336,1586314213.0,"The way add codes are distributed differs among departments. I would say email the professor and TA for the class you want to add. If you fall below 12 units, your financial aid is reduced by some amount since you're no longer considered a part time student. Also, I'd recommend dropping the class after you receive the add code."
UCSantaBarbara,fmnmzz7,t3_fwcxmr,1586229919.0,"Usually you receive it in late summer :/

(but my sister who goes to a cc and gets it in august just got her's this week so maybe policies have changed?)"

UCSantaBarbara,fmlybaj,t3_fw2get,1586195416.0,Has any other university lowered tuition?
UCSantaBarbara,fmkgjfu,t3_fvtchv,1586154200.0,It's a new site created by UCSB students which is why we're using it and also why it isn't really strong enough to handle all the traffic that thousands of users bring. I would support it any other day but I wish that during the current circumstances they would've used a more reliable website. Hopefully the maintenances that were scheduled will make it run more smoothly soon though.
