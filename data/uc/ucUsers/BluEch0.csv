magicbuilding,fpksk1b,t1_fpkb5r5,1588700293.0,"But that is possible even without knowing everything about the magic. Take avatar or full mental alchemist for example. It really doesn’t matter what the viewer knows about bending or alchemy, the same few rules that govern everything are consistent and therefore even though we don’t know the science behind avatar’s chi flow or where exactly the energy for alchemy comes from, we understand the rules and limitations of the system and don’t lose that sense of tension in regards to what kind of magic is possible. 

An unscientific magic system should not necessarily equate to breaking tension, it’s all about having a harder magic system (and do not get me wrong, even softer magic systems, if used appropriately, should not break tension in a story. At a certain point, this becomes a problem with the writer’s ineptitude rather than a problem with the magic system.)"
AskGameMasters,fpiwlo4,t3_gdp5hv,1588650436.0,"Here’s my rule: 

If you have to change characters whether that be due to wanting to change a character or because your last character died, 

- you don’t get any of your old stuff unless the rest of the party in-character retrieves it upon your death and gives it to your new character during a session. Characters that were retired while alive are presumed to have kept the spoils fo their adventuring days. Exceptions can exist (like quest items or in cases where an adventurer was magically aged to the point where he can no longer lift his sword and decides to bestow it to the party fighter who might be able to use it, but make sure it’s not the player trying to cheese the system)

- you start one level lower than whatever level the last character was. This means changing characters too often will stunt your own progress. Learn some commitment. 

- when you build your new character, you may not have any special gear like magic items except for maybe common magic items like bags of holding. You can’t retire your character then come in new with a holy avenger or staff of the magi. You’re also going to be low on gold, maybe like a hundred gold per level? Ten gold per level? Doesn’t matter how much gold you actually give per level or per session, the new coming character is not well off, yet.

Maybe the rules aren’t perfect, but it works so far in my inexperience as a dm."

magicbuilding,fpitrqh,t1_fpiprfg,1588648535.0,"Yes, and I’m aware that science is not a “done and dusted” field, but I find that when most people say they want magic to feel like a science, they mean *everything* is known about the magic (Nevermind how that was possible but let’s just say that that’s part of their fantasy)

And that to me is more justification that magic should be more unknown to give that extra lining of wonder and mystery. But of course, do what your setting/story requires."
AskGameMasters,fphmrj6,t3_gdeuge,1588624027.0,"“It’s said that a very wealthy family who used to be customers to my shop discovered a way to enchant fabric with animated embroidery (glammerweave from eberron - I think that’s what it’s called - is what I’m thinking of). A dress embroidered with the image of vines slowly wave and unfurl as the dress’s fabric waves. A coat embroidered with the likeness of flames shows the fire dancing as if real. The problem is, no one else has been able to crack the code and create more of this fabric, and this family has no desire to sell the fabric nor share its secrets. All wizards who tried to replicate such a fabric have failed to create it or maintain the animation indefinitely. Even jealous dragons have tried to steal the fabric by force, only to lose their lives in their pursuit. So I ask you, you troublesome adventurers, discover the secrets of this weave. And guess what, I may not even ask my wizard friend to alter your memory of this secret if you succeed.”

Now you have to infiltrate a family of powerful mages. Perhaps they’re vampires? Maybe they’re a family of sorcerers, maybe a family at the center of a warlock cult.

ImaginaryKanto,fp8pcha,t1_fp8il5e,1588398705.0,"With mega evolutions, the Pokémon evolves due to a shit ton of Infinity Energy^TM boosting their power. 

Mega gengar fused with the shadows and developed a third eye, improving its own motif by fusing with the shadows, but channeling the mega evolution energy to open a third eye and enhance its special attacks. 

Mega steelix took all that mega energy and heated up its insides, causing them to burst out a crystals with excess energy causing a ring of metal scraps to orbit it. 

Mega gardevoir used that energy to fluff up its dress yes but also enlarged its red chest horn, which the pokedex states is the organ through which the ralts line senses others’ emotions and emits their psychic powers from, essentially meaning a bigger horn improves the Pokémon’s psychic abilities. 

Mega ballads on the other hand grows a cape yes but instead gets bigger elbow “swords” and shrinks its emotion sensing horn on its chest, making it a more efficient, though notably gallant looking, killer. But I wonder, is it truly gallant, or is it all a facade?

Mega kangaskhan takes all that energy and makes its pouch baby grow up. Seems self explanatory. 

There’s also a lot of other mega evos that don’t follow that trend or keep these deep explanations more to pokedex lore than explicit design but if we follow along the logic of the really good mega evo designs, maybe mega dragapult would become a stealth helicarrier (after all, the “catapult” in its name is talking about the mechanism on aircraft carriers that launch fighter jets). It is permanently stuck flying in a horizontal position rather than its sitting pose, and it houses fleets of normal dragapults or dracloaks, all primed and armed with dreepys and ready to fly off the back. The arrow pattern on regular dragapult’s neck is moved to the back to represent the arrows found on many aircraft carriers, and makes a perfect runway shape from tail to snout along its back. And to differentiate it from regular dragapult further, maybe it gains more “wings”/airfoils for better stability along its body. 

It’s also been a trend to add a downside to mega evolution (lore wise, not stat wise) so maybe explain how it’s arms and legs are now airfoils rather than appendages. It can’t attack itself, relying exclusively on the fleet of minions on its back so if it runs out of dracloak or dragapults on its back, it’s rendered helpless. 

Just my ideas. Don’t constrain yourself to one person’s imagination. But that’s the process that went through my head."

Seeing as no one is going to report on the educated Chinese family who knew not to fuck with bears, guess what the majority of reported cases of dumb Asian tourist is gonna be.

It is apparently lighter with a wider blade than the katana and this allows for better cutting for the weight but can’t attest to that personally.

Ether doesn’t quite interact the same way as regular matter and we can’t even really detect it on its own, but supposedly we can experience the flow of ether in the form of gravity.

dndnext,foh2ex1,t3_g7b7zs,1587759754.0,"I’m sorry but I think this is my second favorite use of a mimic. 

My first favorite is when they enter a room with two doors (one of which they walked through to get to this room) and a chest, and there’s a huge warning message written in blood on the back wall that says “beware the mimic”. The chest isn’t a mimic, it was filled with treasure. The other door was the mimic. 

Btw, you should totally encourage your fighter to tame the mimic and have a sentient transforming weapon. Only downside is he can’t put it down."
gameideas,fogzf2m,t1_fogvggv,1587758753.0,"Could be a silly hitman style game but the whole game revolves around the mastery of throwing things. You can throw anything and accomplish your mission. Assassinations? Framing someone? Getting to checkpoints, etc. 

Mastery of the throwing mechanic would also be far more interesting than typical fps games if throwing objects makes them fly in an arc rather than being hitscan. Especially if your throwing ability borders on the superhuman and you have environments with excellent verticality. 

Add in some stealth elements and you can really start constraining the missions. You can throw anything, but you have to carefully choose what you throw so that you don’t get caught, or people don’t notice the thing you threw being out of place."

coolguides,fo84eg9,t1_fo7z2ox,1587589697.0,"Depends. For example, if your character is just saying something in a regular tone, maybe a professional tone, “said” is fine. But if you want to more concisely describe how he had a strong tone, or how he threw a witty comeback, “demanded” or “snarked” might actually be appropriate. Those words will convey far more than “said” can but of course the trade-off is that they’re situational. 

Even in more artistic use, common words have their place."

If whole party wants tot try, hey, go all out 

For important npcs, they’re more aware, more alert, have a stronger will to fight and live than the mooks so deal regular sneak attack damage, but give them that surprised condition. The exception would be the assassin class as they have specific mechanics that deal more damage when you pull off that perfect stealth, though that too doesn’t guarantee a full kill for npcs with hundreds of hit points."

Switch,fo41oko,t1_fo3y98l,1587496676.0,"I’d say it’s a combination. 

Not to talk down to anyone here but there are definitely people who “abuse” their joysticks more with their inherent jerky movements or strong fingers, even though you yourself think you’re treating the joycon with care. For people like that, it would help to try to control your hand moevements or strength to get more out of the joy one. 

That however isn’t to say that Nintendo need not do something. I have no doubt Nintendo tested their joycon a before launch but it was clearly inadequate. If people are able to decalibrate a sensor with their inherent movements or hand strength, that’s a problem with the manufacturer. Yes, the rough users should learn to be more gentle, but the manufacturer should simultaneously be working to make the joycon be able to take more punishment. The grippy nature of joycons, especially considering how people hold them when the switch is docked and how thin the overall console/controllers are in handheld mode, probably contributes to higher amounts of wear for similar levels of roughness on other beefier controllers (for example, I don’t think anyone has reported drift on switch pro controllers). The joycons are a fairly new design in videogame history so that kind of oversight can be excusable but lack of iteration to fix the problem, or even test the theory is not. That being said, giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt and assuming they are looking for a solution and just haven’t found one yet, please be patient with them (but totally fuck them if they aren’t and they’re just going to sit on the issue because it makes money). 

Basically, if you’re finding yourself burning through joycons like crazy, you might have a problem yourself, even if by your standards you’re taking good care of your controller and not being too rough. Learn to be even more careful to the controllers. But that’s not the only kind of people getting drift issues so Nintendo should have revised their testing method or do something to make the joycon more robust."
