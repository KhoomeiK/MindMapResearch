AskReddit,fpgvecf,t1_fpgkzi8,1588610203.0,They’re cash-only and their owner has been accused of extensive sexual harassment. Not a good place.
AskReddit,fpgu6x3,t1_fpfuji8,1588609585.0,"I fainted last week and my roommate sighed in relief that I woke up so quickly. “I wasn’t sure if you had health insurance and I didn’t want to call an ambulance and put you in a shitload of debt if you didn’t.” I was thankful she thought of that, but yeah, oof."
SanJose,fpeu8vv,t1_fpe0ove,1588555054.0,Very few people sit in there anyway. It’s most commonly to go.

bayarea,fp2p07c,t1_fp21ser,1588265480.0,The point of not overwhelming hospitals is so more people don’t die when they don’t have to. Less people means more ability for hospitals to properly treat those affected.
bayarea,fp2ot26,t1_fp2l66y,1588265388.0,"Yes, I do remember. It’s at least more reason not to have people start commingling more."

bayarea,fp22ly8,t1_fp1fhgi,1588253855.0,SoCal had an uptick in cases this last week.
bayarea,fp21vo5,t1_fp201h0,1588253394.0,"I dislike how people seem to think of this virus as a singular force that loses power over time. The virus is still just as contagious, just as deadly as it was when this began. The point of flattening the curve is so we don’t overwhelm hospitals and therefore don’t have people needlessly dying. The hospitals will be overwhelmed when people start herding to beaches and state parks or start opening all businesses again.

But I guess people have decided they’re frustrated by not being able to go to the beach/hair salon/mall, so the threat is less real to them??"
AmItheButtface,foqi06p,t1_foqgl2h,1587994013.0,"Except you can’t find any N80s/N95s anywhere.

So you say OP is just as good with a surgical or cotton mask as an N95 but then say “we go for the N80-90 masks instead.” That doesn’t make any sense. Cleary there’s a need for some extensive filtration.

I don’t know why you’re so insistent on ranting at OP when you also are not a medical professional, as you previously mentioned are the only people qualified to answer this Reddit question."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fofj3cg,t1_fofgtqt,1587736966.0,"It is different. I don’t give a damn if they don’t ream him on national TV, they’re doing their job as best they can under a dictator. You would likely not be fired for giving accurate medical corrections. They would most certainly be."

These doctors are working to save lives, and keyboard warriors think they ought to piss on about what they’re doing wrong."

berkeley,focd8r1,t1_foc5nzl,1587669953.0,"I think many people getting angry about those fees aren't thinking about the numerous employees (not faculty) who would have no means of getting paid if not for those fees remaining to fund daily (minimum) operations, maintenance, security, etc. It's easy to assume those fees are just the university taking our money for kicks, but it doesn't feel like that's what they're doing."
bayarea,foajb6y,t1_foa60x5,1587647568.0,"Someone very likely under the influence who stole the bus and could damage a shitload of property, cars, telephone lines, oh yeah, and kill people?

Yeah, for car chases they always assume the person may be armed because they have no proof otherwise when they can’t search them, and then the bus driver refuses to exit the bus."

but for OP: It looks like Sam Evans is a postdoc (which happens frequently, where postdocs and GSIs teach summer courses), and I've never met a postdoc/GSI at Cal in ESPM who wasn't fantastic. If you're interested in the topic and willing to do the work, I would go for it. If you're concerned about workload, try to email the instructor to ask for an overview. He may even send you the syllabus in some capacity."

pcmasterrace,fndze3o,t1_fndouxk,1586880308.0,"I think (obviously depends on the situation) that it's more wanting to be ""impressed"" by everything a particular guy (or at least seem interested in it).

So there’s no reason for us all to be so pissed off about it, but you know. People.” I liked that class."

Coffee,fn6r6gn,t1_fn6p5h7,1586705706.0,"Oh, that sounds awesome! I typically just do about 16g for a typical pour over grind with beans on the “darker” side of light, and it takes forever in the Hario. I don’t time it anymore so I may be faster, but it used to take like 5 minutes."
Coffee,fn6nk6w,t1_fn6l8hs,1586703515.0,How long does it typically take you to grind for you (depends I guess on how much you grind)?
Coffee,fn6j2y3,t1_fn44m71,1586700582.0,"Thank you! That would definitely be a step up, honestly it takes me a good 5 min to crank my usual 16g."

Do you have a recommendation for a premium hand grinder? Or like the other poster, a Lido 3?"
bayarea,fn5icq8,t1_fn54qot,1586665658.0,"It probably is different depending on the system.

Coffee,fn41hs3,t3_fyhrib,1586632146.0,"Hey everyone! So, I've been using a Hario hand grinder for about a year now, and I've officially grown tired of grinding my beans by hand. I'm willing to shell out up to $150-200 for something electric, however, I'm about to move in with a new roommate in the coming months. Since I'm an early riser (and an early coffee drinker), I really don't want my new roommate to hate me for running something so loud it wakes them up/disturbs their morning/day.

I've been reading through threads around this sub, and it seems Capresso Infinity would be quietest, but I'd be sacrificing a lot in terms of grind quality and retention versus a Baratza Encore. I've also seen Kitchenaid, Bodum, Oxo, and Breville thrown around for brands. Any advice? Thanks!"
Coffee,fn3vbxc,t1_fn14x61,1586628628.0,"What do you dislike about the cold brew maker, in particular? 

Most rec's I've seen have been just throwing your grounds into a mason jar with water, letting it hang out, and filtering through a paper filter when done. Alternatively, you can get little ""coffee socks"" like large teabags so you don't have to filter at the end."

To me, everything at Taco Bell is salty, but I don't know how you would feel about it. Both of those options are pretty cheap, so if you aren't a fan, it's not super consequential."
LivingMas,fn1g0y7,t1_fn1es2d,1586561245.0,"They're fried, but not particularly crispy once they're in the taco or burrito. They just add a nice flavor and bulk to whatever you're eating.
