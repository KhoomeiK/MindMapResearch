If I were to give advice to my younger self, I wouldn’t say: don’t do this.

If you have friends, connections, maybe a job back home and you enjoy your family then it maybe be worth it. But if you don’t, CC is a long, boring trudge.

The main thing you lose though is this: the college experience. I got a taste of it at the first UC I went to and it’s amazing. Everyone’s experience is different but the camaraderie of freshmen in dorms is fantastic. You’ll have bad days and good days, but all days will be MEMORABLE.

Nothing at a CC is memorable and, so far, nothing as a transfer has been either.  

THAT BEING SAID, I know MANY transfers who would wholeheartedly disagree with me. 

This is something to consider though."
