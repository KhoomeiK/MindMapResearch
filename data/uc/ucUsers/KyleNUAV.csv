gadgets,fphl0xy,t1_fphij6t,1588623141.0,So essentially doing an ARM port is trivial as long as the hardware does everything properly.
gadgets,fphcuqi,t1_fph2t3w,1588619010.0,This is how I imagine it would work. Run an ARM core(s) but on the top layer have it accept x86 instructions with hardware decoding (for speed). This would make it look like a x86 while not really being one. I imagine this is how some processors already work just to keep legacy code running.
WildernessBackpacking,fpfw65l,t1_fpe7kxm,1588585799.0,What section?? In CA Costcos I’ve never seen any.
Entrepreneur,fpfv5uj,t1_fpfuuwh,1588584697.0,"Uhh idk about that. Even the easiest degree will still make you, at a minimum, much better at critical thinking, textual analysis, writing, etc."
santacruz,fpc70mx,t1_fpc41jr,1588489749.0,Nah police are searching for someone. Don’t have any more info sorry.
santacruz,fpbzou5,t1_fpbxu1u,1588483099.0,Yeah
santacruz,fpbu5k4,t3_gck7im,1588478797.0,"15 minutes later, in the same spot, a group of guys got in a shouting match apparently over cocaine. One of the people in the group started shouting at the police, who arrived very quickly, asking them to, “shoot me!”

Real Santa Cruz quarantine vibes.

Update: Apparently stuff is happening again. Whole of beach hill is locked down."
UCSC,fotnri0,t1_fotativ,1588059815.0,As tradition demands!
santacruz,forkxzu,t1_foqocpn,1588013974.0,I live here and my plate is not local (along with all the students) so that’s really not a good metric.
UCSC,fom5tm4,t1_folqoht,1587879164.0,lol his class is so easy this quarter what are you doin.
recruitinghell,fokj1u1,t1_fojxujq,1587842984.0,IBM made me play flash games to see if I was a good engineer. Such a surprise that they only hire the worst talent.
bayarea,foj5lk8,t1_foisw3q,1587809292.0,Nah nah just make manufacturing completely automated like the Tesla factory.  This will work!
learnmachinelearning,fohdjyr,t1_foh3cny,1587764160.0,Maybe change jobs?
UCSC,foa21sr,t1_fo9j94x,1587637762.0,"As long as they didn’t rip the ‘do not remove under penalty of death’ sticker off, should be gtg"
arduino,foa017m,t3_g6bobr,1587636123.0,If only someone made versions of common learner/kit parts that had protected inputs. Same complexity and difficulty while saving the school money.
Entrepreneur,fo69bzg,t3_g5ugph,1587551408.0,"This is a great idea and it’s awesome someone finally made a landlord/tenant review site. Here is some unsolicited advice pulled from my butt:

-Blatantly steal and copy the Rate My Professor setup. It works and people use it.

-Start marketing to college towns since they have the highest rental turnover and the times you would want to ramp up advertising is very predictable.

-Have the ratings tied to the address or lot so that landlords can’t get rid of reviews if they change a name or something. For tenants I’d argue that having a previous landlord as a reference is good enough of a rating. (Might not need tenant ratings.)"
wallstreetbets,fo66yjg,t1_fo65h3k,1587548849.0,lol like it’s some free fuckin tube you can just send shit down.
europe,fo651oi,t1_fo64xnn,1587546772.0,People shouldn’t donate money to charity? I don’t think you actually believe that.
europe,fo64oxn,t1_fo64j0f,1587546396.0,The population that donates the most money by % of income (and total amount) begs to differ.
bayarea,fo01l7v,t1_fnzyrwp,1587404479.0,Replying to you would be like engaging in a conversation with a crazy person on the street.
UCSC,fnv54kv,t1_fnu36l8,1587280567.0,And the wait time is well over 2 weeks from my experience...
EngineeringStudents,fnsunab,t1_fnsbhbh,1587229119.0,"Yes actually, I just really wanted to learn the math and how it’s done before relying on libraries. (And to learn more python)"
EngineeringStudents,fnrtnwu,t1_fnrjkq7,1587201142.0,CE here. I just spent all day writing a linear regression... in python... for question 2 (b) out of 5 questions... my head hurts.
DamnUEngineering,fngglxj,t1_fn6jdqx,1586931595.0,You really want to get within 2 m of someone wearing that?
EngineeringStudents,fn4y921,t1_fn4sf4n,1586651610.0,Because coastal cities have the highest population of engineers.
EngineeringStudents,fn4blgk,t1_fn4b28j,1586638025.0,"From what I’ve seen online (Glassdoor/indeed) 85-100 is normal for Silicon Valley. Idk about areas outside of major city hubs where I would imagine it is much lower.
I had three offers, 120, 95, and 75 all with various benefits. I went with 95 cause of the better work culture & I would be surrounded by people WAY smarter than myself."
EngineeringStudents,fn4apr9,t1_fn2eha5,1586637513.0,Nah. I’m graduating this spring and have a $95k/yr job waiting for me. Going to a pretty decent school really helps.
EngineeringStudents,fn4aiwa,t1_fn2cv5p,1586637400.0,Huh I’m starting out of college at 95k. CE.
AskReddit,fmvpgw2,t1_fmv5seh,1586425815.0,This is why we really need a boys health movement. Preteen and teenage boys are not getting the mental and social support/knowledge they need in the 21st century. This kid should have been sent to a psychiatrist for help not just shrugged at.
UCSC,fmjk6xi,t1_fmjgbt7,1586131973.0,My emails to the professors had nothing to do with fin aid and were pretty respectful. Like slugstructor said my email is more than likely buried under a mountain of other emails...
