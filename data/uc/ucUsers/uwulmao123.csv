berkeley,fpjg2h2,t3_gdrr2x,1588667169.0,"Hi OP! Please try to request an extension. Also, try to start off by writing your design doc to make a plan and stick to it. I've always found that it helps me have a better understanding when I write something out. Next, make sure you watch the videos on the spec! They give a few hints on how you might want to approach the project. If you haven't done lab 12 either, please take a look at it since it deals with file persistence and file paths. 
Something that might be helpful is doing the command in the order you're given. Start off with init, then add and so on, but only start writing code after thinking about what you need to do in your design doc. 
Lastly, if you're confused on how to structure the files you want to save, look in your .git folder in your repo folder! Because gitlet is a smaller version is git, use git and how it's structured to your advantage! Feel free to explore the folder and look at where things are stored. 

Wishing you the best of luck, and just wanted you to know I believe in you. It's a tough road, but you can do it <3

berkeley,fonvqng,t1_fonqxqp,1587927414.0,Join CSM! They offer free small group tutoring for your cs class and are committed to really helping you out.
berkeley,fonviw3,t3_g8an1k,1587927293.0,"Hey! Gal in CS here. I already have a 162 group next semester, but feel free to talk to me anytime :). Something that's kept me feeling integrated in the community is CSM (computer science mentors) and AWE (Association of women in EE/CS). I think I've found a really genuine group of people there, and I would 10/10 encourage you give it a try too."
