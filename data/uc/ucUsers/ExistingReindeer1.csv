berkeley,fpe0y5c,t1_fpdziv2,1588538174.0,Yeah you're totally fine. Now it's up to admissions.
berkeley,fpdyfr2,t1_fpdbo37,1588536740.0,"3 is fine. To be honest with you, I personally have a friend who mentioned ALL high school ECs and got in."
berkeley,fpb61bf,t3_gcbfuh,1588462856.0,"Just a piece of advice, a lot of people here are saying Berkeley doesn't verify anything. It's not true, sometimes you will be randomly selected to verify what you say."
berkeley,fozeyz7,t1_fozew9y,1588189535.0,He can submit a college transfer form. It happens all the time for transfers.
berkeley,fozdk2v,t3_gaftey,1588188865.0,"You can still declare regular Economics at Berkeley, by the way.

\-Fellow Transfer"
berkeley,fohelys,t3_g7ghw3,1587764645.0,"CC is a great choice, I loved my time in community college."
berkeley,fodqq5r,t3_g6xgkj,1587688332.0,"Sometimes it does give you issues. For example, if you take an English class. I highly recommend you ask and vet with your advisor the classes you're taking."
berkeley,fodgirn,t1_focr0fx,1587684401.0,"Didn't end up taking it. But if it's with Delong I don't recommend it. They never formally removed me from the class, so I can see everything that goes on. And from what I see, it doesn't seem worth it."
AskReddit,fo9jofw,t3_g69kfu,1587621475.0,"A student took up-skirt pictures of a teacher and circulated them into the entire school. It fucked up as in, they kinda ruined her life."
berkeley,fo9jh9w,t3_g6g144,1587621303.0,"I'm not entirely sure, of what you're saying. For example, are you submitting an appeal? If so I have the expertise, but really if you say all this in the appeal you will receive a conditional acceptance."
berkeley,fo9jdon,t3_g6gwu0,1587621219.0,"Downward trajectory, the state or federal government don't care about the school enough to fund it. Similarly, award winning research isn't coming out like it used to. But of course I may be wrong. My objective side tells me to say it'll go down, but subjectively I feel as if it will retain itself."
berkeley,fo843vh,t3_g68hba,1587589552.0,"I don't think it matters. These schools look for two things : 1. Upward trends, 2. high GPA. For the most part, I highly doubt graduate admissions will even care about this semester. They're probably going to just overlook it. Yargumentou can make the same arguement when you're taking decals for PNP. You have a mix of grades and PNP when you're taking a decal, so.... aren't law schools going to care about that? There are way too many inconsistencies in all arguments about whether or not classes should be taken as a mix. If you ask me, it truly doesn't matter and it gives you more benefit to take classes for grades that you're doing well in, and PNP for classes you aren't"
berkeley,fo7aonl,t1_fo5ros3,1587575115.0,Forgive me I meant to say Hybrid\*\*\*\*
berkeley,fo5pqvf,t1_fo5m9kq,1587531960.0,Does it actually take them 4 weeks to approve the course?
berkeley,fo5lvfz,t3_g5tikh,1587528903.0,SFSU is already online for the Fall. So that's something to base it off of.
berkeley,fo438gg,t1_fo3xgr4,1587497439.0,Welcome! I'm from SMCCD too. Email if you have any conversations.
berkeley,fnt9xjp,t3_g3sr8i,1587237462.0,"Only a UC-UC transfer can give you advice on this.

Good luck!"
berkeley,fnsuetf,t3_g3jtf5,1587228991.0,Wada is 1/3 transfers/upper classmen. It'd be a great fit.
berkeley,fnihxld,t1_fnieqb6,1586980296.0,You are correct
berkeley,fnigfvs,t3_g1ylnz,1586979566.0,"It's a pretty nice curve. You'll pass don't' worry. You'll get at least a B-. 

You still have a lot of your grade left."
berkeley,fmicv2k,t3_fv9ct5,1586107052.0,"Depending on your Pell Grants you're also eligible for one. 

This is completely a financial aid question, do not as reddit lol."
