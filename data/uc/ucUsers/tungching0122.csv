ucla,fpfalwk,t1_fpd0h6t,1588565862.0, Thank you so much! One more thing: is it common to get waitlisted for classes? I donâ€™t want to get waitlisted for classes that I have to take in a sequence ðŸ¥´
ucla,fpcdh0c,t3_gc9dpr,1588496404.0,"I really need some advice:/ just some general questions about how it is like being a biochem major at UCLA. I am an admitted transfer in the coming Fall majoring in biochem, choosing between UCLA and UW Seattle. I know that the Seattle area has a lot of support and opportunities for STEM majors in general, but I am not so sure about California. What are the pros and cons of being a biochem major in CA? 

How many people are there usually in upper-division courses? Are they still packed with people? Do you think profs teach well? Are TAs helpful? Are there ways that I can get extra help with my studies?

Transferring as a junior, do you think that it is hard for me to get undergrad research opportunities? How well do the school support undergrad research? Did you do any undergrad research/internship/research programs? Which ones do you recommend?

Do you think that it is hard to get a good grade? I heard that some people cheat? Not sure how frequent that happens though if that's true. 

I know this is a lot:/ this is a hard decision and I just don't know which school is more suitable for me. Please let me know how y'all think about it (any biochem major/graduate)"
