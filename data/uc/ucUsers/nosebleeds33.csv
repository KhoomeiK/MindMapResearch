ucr,fp91rsr,t1_fp8zdef,1588410998.0,Thank you. However I never got an email and when I check my account for the 19-20 year there’s nothing? Hopefully it’s something I can wait out for.
ucr,fp8oors,t3_gbzpa2,1588398148.0,Does this mean those who don’t receive any financial aid won’t get any money?
ucr,fnygaao,t3_g4e0lh,1587362208.0,Anyone here at uvt with any updates? I’ve tried calling multiple times on different days and no one seems to answer.
ucr,fnqvl02,t3_g3eofk,1587173189.0,Does this apply to all students or just those who receive aid ?
