ucla,fpmjq76,t3_geacy5,1588734585.0,But they created a task force headed by vice dean to the assistant vice chancellor provost who makes 200k a year to sit in meetings! Doesn't that make you feel better because they used the words 'task force'? Now what if I told you there were dozens of vice deans/assistant vice chancellors on this committee? Millions of dollars in salary all to have meetings about how complicated they can make the next email they send out to us

Actually the dumbest thing to do would be to create a reddit account and go argue with a bunch of your peers calling them privileged."

Also, while everyone's going to love eating this up (including me), it's not good for the long term health of the show :("
PKA,fmmtpjn,t3_fw7zgh,1586211892.0,"I laughed on the Richard Ryan episode when Taylor was talking about Kyle always sending them pictures of food. I think Taylor's quote was ""Kyle's just been eating and eating and eating and eating"""
