ucla,fpj5ng7,t1_fpj2ksw,1588657317.0,"Oh it's definitely a cycle, that's why affirmative action was started to begin with. That's why favoring students who come from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds can help the situation, since it'd put them in a place where their families wouldn't be stuck financially for multiple generations.

I think socioeconomic disparities across racial lines are largely due to racism, honestly. People talk about Asians as being a ""model minority"" because they are closer to whites in terms of things like median household income. They use it as a way to discriminate against other minorities, saying things like if the Asians can make money, why can't you? 

A large part of how our society is structured is flawed. People grow up in poor areas, and because they're in a poor area they have a lackluster education (be that because they have to help out at home, or their school doesn't get enough funding, or many other reasons). Because of that poorer education, there's less chance of them pursuing higher education--or even if they do pursue it, it's harder to succeed. Additionally, people who don't graduate college tend to not move very far from where they grew up (as far as I know) so then the entire area tends to stay impoverished, and the government doesn't seem to really care about amending that.

Affirmative action was something I think was necessary, but I'd like to see it move past being done along racial lines and move towards favoring people of poorer socioeconomic backgrounds. I think a lot of the pushback towards affirmative action would go away if that were the case, since a lot of white people bitch and moan about reverse discrimination. And I get where they're coming from, but I think they need to calm down. lol"
ucla,fpj27k5,t1_fpimeky,1588654544.0,"Absolutely. Prop 209 bans discrimination, and repealing it via ACA 5 opens the door to more issues than it would actually solve. 

Furthermore, affirmative action in of itself (as it has been historically utilized and implemented) does not tackle the root cause of why minority students have been and continue to be underrepresented on college campuses. A disparity in socioeconomic status, as can be seen via metrics such as median household income, is one of the primary issues underlying why minority groups to be underrepresented in places such as UCLA. As such, giving ""unfair"" advantage to students who come from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds is something I am in favor of as a concept. I am not in favor of giving advantage to students based solely off of their race, however, as I believe students who are in well-off households but are minorities do not deserve any advantage when compared to their white peers.

Ultimately, I would love for there to be more representation of minority students on campus, but ACA 5 is not the way to do it."
