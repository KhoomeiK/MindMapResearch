UCSantaBarbara,fpd44li,t1_fpc9k6w,1588519434.0,"The actually great thing is that it's not a lost cause! The Stay Home orders are informed by scientists who have studied this topic for decades - public health experts and epidemiologists - who have modeled that if we strictly stay home for a while longer (until we have more testing and contact tracing in place), we can continue to buy time for our medical system to catch up to understanding and treating this illness for people who do get it.

The relatively empty hospitals on the West Coast mean that my parent with a chronic illness can talk with a doctor about going in for essential surgery soon, without having to postpone it due to the hospital being clogged with COVID-19 or out of PPE. I'm grateful for people who are staying home."

UCSantaBarbara,fpbi1a7,t1_fpbhmuz,1588470480.0,"The sad thing is that this virus doesn't really work this way - it's not a fair illness. A lot of people behaving irresponsibly are probably healthy without underlying conditions, so if they get infected, they'll probably do ok - but they then have a huge risk of passing it to a friend, family member, store worker, medical worker, or other innocent person who is much more vulnerable."
sanfrancisco,fnxvram,t1_fnxpwic,1587347380.0,"Just interesting to note - the people with green vests are volunteers! They're part of the local [NERT program](https://sf-fire.org/neighborhood-emergency-response-team-nert). Anyone who lives or works in SF can sign up for an 18-hour free training from the SF Fire Department and become a NERT volunteer for emergency response. I did it, and I recommend it.

The program is mostly designed for educating people to be earthquake response volunteers, but since this is a different kind of emergency, they're asking us to help with coronavirus public health info distribution as well."
UCSantaBarbara,fnsn7g6,t3_g3hq3n,1587225030.0,"Look up misophonia - it sounds like that might be what you're experiencing. There are ways of mitigating and treating this, including with therapy."
sanfrancisco,fnnwi6m,t3_g2ubar,1587103910.0,"In case you haven't seen them, these sites are coordinating makers and people who need masks: https://www.makemasks2020.org/order or https://getusppe.org/request/ - you may be able to request homemade sewn masks to be sent to the facility."
UCSantaBarbara,fmmmvvm,t3_fvpj89,1586208204.0,You could also try the tenant mediation service here: https://islavistacsd.ca.gov/rental-housing-mediation - sign up and pick “tenant to tenant interpersonal”.
UCSantaBarbara,fmkc4pa,t3_fvpj89,1586150216.0,"I'm sorry, that's really scary and frustrating. Can you text them [a video like this from a young person with COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLSG-7K3Tc)? It may scare them a bit. [Here's a story from a hospital in NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE68xVXf8Kw) with some pretty distressing information, from the New York Times.

Or can you text them links to a couple of articles? Something like [this personal perspective from a doctor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/opinion/coronavirus-doctor-new-york.html) or [this call for immediate action](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca)? Or print the articles out and put them in the kitchen? It might not help, but it's something to try.

Can you wear a mask or another form of face covering to at least protect yourself a little bit while you're in shared spaces at home? Are you allowed to wear any kind of face covering at work? It's also not perfect, but it can help prevent spread."
