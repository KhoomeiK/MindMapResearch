UCSC,fp5zled,t1_fp58jqi,1588343218.0,Just enroll and worry about that later. Enrollment stays open and you can drop later if need be. Secure your spot now

The graffiti harms students. Like all of us, students still living at Kresge‚Äîwho are nearly the only ones who see the graffiti‚Äîare likely to be experiencing challenging reductions in security, community, amenities, and services. 

The graffiti harms staff. It damages the work environment, and adds stress and burden, to workers who spend hours, some of them in harm‚Äôs way, to maintain a living environment already under exceptional duress.

We imagine that many of you share our feelings about this, and have more to say. We look forward to turning a corner toward sanity and comfort in our campus home. Thank you for reading and we invite you to spread the word.

As a longtime UC worker ( and a student) please know that we miss you guys; sometimes we complain and are glad things clear out in the summer but we are here because the university exists for the students and we miss your smiling ( or whatever) faces every day. I don‚Äôt think I am alone when I say  that we look forward to you all coming back and having this experience and education that you deserve. I know this quarter sucks and I hope we can get back to classrooms and seeing friends."

Yeah our pup has been through a lot; his urination  seems back to normal now. We are really hoping he can catch a break and be a puppy for a while. We could also use the break financially; his surgery  and complications have cost us about 7,000$ at this point. He‚Äôs worth it but hopefully we can all stay healthy now"
AskVet,fok7r2v,t1_fojtsmt,1587836971.0,Thank you.
UCSC,fojqqch,t3_g7q6dx,1587827367.0,I‚Äôd say as long as it is before fall enrollment it would be considered fair warning .
UCSC,foi3u7j,t1_foi3l7y,1587778158.0,But your grades all along in the class ; were they passing or not?
UCSC,foi3j58,t3_g7kc8k,1587777985.0,Did you get passing grades in the class?

UCSC,foe61k8,t3_g6ui9i,1587696745.0,Since they have to make the call soon I‚Äôd say they have to say online. If they had more time it could have been in person.
AskVet,fo7eqkd,t1_fo7e9lv,1587577083.0,Why this
UCSC,fo55kfx,t1_fo53wad,1587517986.0,They did ?
UCSC,fo54yav,t1_fo543b2,1587517600.0,I think that makes a lot of sense
UCSC,fo53ta2,t3_g5le1z,1587516902.0,Keep in mind that enrollment for fall is less than a month away and they pretty much have to have made a decision by then if classes are in person or not. Given its so close they‚Äôll likely opt for either online or a hybrid system with a fraction of student on campus. Even if they go full in person a lot of students are projected to be taking time off so housing should be easier .

UCSC,fnt9623,t3_g3rxy9,1587237032.0,Unfortunately chances are that we won‚Äôt need ‚Äúreminders ‚Äú of this pandemic because we are not just going back to how things were before it. It‚Äôll be corona-light day every day.
UCSC,fnq270k,t1_fnq0hrt,1587156274.0,You could very well be right.
UCSC,fnpwdv9,t1_fnpv68p,1587153215.0,Yeah it might just be too complicated.
UCSC,fnpu5x4,t1_fnpp2a5,1587152059.0,I am just going to address your comment about groundskeepers and maintenance workers. We are definitely not looking elsewhere now that the economy is on a downward spiral. We have been given some paid leave hours but have also been working so the university is open for business in our case. A few months ago we may have had better options but not now. I cannot speak for other positions though.
UCSC,fnpt6uj,t1_fnpr0ew,1587151551.0,Fair point. Then maybe they‚Äôll resume 1/4 classes in person ( ones with labs and some others) and keep most online. On campus living will not go back to full numbers but if the pandemic seems under control they‚Äôll try and get a chunk of students back in.
AskVet,fnpqdhj,t3_g37qjp,1587150072.0,Not a vet and not giving medical advice. About the emotional support the best advice that was given to me was to ‚Äú be happy around your dog; don‚Äôt burden them with you sadness and worry‚Äù. That is what I did; try and have your voice and energy be reassuring and a bit up without getting him excited.
UCSC,fnpmp2u,t1_fnpmcsc,1587148204.0,Could well be; depends on state wide guidelines .
UCSC,fnpmlu2,t1_fnpmclc,1587148158.0,Very valid questions about who gets prioritized and I haven‚Äôt a clue . Why not all online? Because the university is losing money and the longer they can‚Äôt offer the full campus experience the less students will want to enroll in the future.
AskVet,fnpam12,t1_fnj7hi4,1587142146.0,"The update: 
The surgeon said to use lubricating eye drops for now so we can give Baldy some time to heal after his big ordeal. The plan is to then have what she said should be a straightforward procedure to make two small incisions on his brows or forehead and let those heal by second intention. Thanks again"
AskVet,fnkujod,t1_fnkonrk,1587040317.0,I am so sorry. Let me know about your gofund me campaign. I have an Instagram account with a lot of animal lover followers and if you start the gofund me I will  post a link to it and pitch in. @bergundwald
AskVet,fnkj5mk,t3_g29z0w,1587029042.0,I am not a vet but I sure feel for you. A gofund me campaign or maybe a payment plan? Going to a vet school ( not sure where you are) can be less expensive . Good luck and if you weigh it all and the best thing is to let your buddy go because money just won‚Äôt buy him a decent life then be easy on yourself because you clearly care.

 I am not a vet. We got a puppy that turned out to have genetic malformation issues right after we brought him home. It‚Äôs been a heartache and expensive but we figure at least he landed with someone that is trying to give him the best shot in life. This may not be workable for you and I hope you get answers to your actual question, but maybe something to keep in mind. We would not trade our cryptorchid/ head full of hamartomas/ funny shaped/ who -knows -what -else dog. Someone else may have put him down by now and he seems to be having a blast with us ."

UCSC,fn7wekn,t3_fzzu5k,1586728986.0,"That‚Äôs interesting. My department looked at average weekly hours for each student worker and then gave them Covid pay in this formula : averaged 40 hours/ week = total of 128 hours. Averaged 20 hours= 64 hours of covid leave. Departments are not paying this, the UC is. If they are not doing this it‚Äôs a department issue that should be looked into."
AskVet,fn79psl,t1_fn78nx8,1586716043.0,Plenty of people in my country are posting that all vets are closed so my recommendation is for them to call the vet and find out before writing that everything is closed. Brother in Italy and vets are open there too.
