I recommend you read my favorite lecture on the subject. Skin depth is a basic concept in EM:

changemyview,fnozipf,t1_fnox426,1587136548.0,"> There is electromagnetic region of wavelengths/frequencies known as the radio/micro wave region. This is everything with a longer wavelength/lower frequency than visible light. There is a subregion colloquially known just as 'radiowaves'. This is the region used by devices called radios for example, hence the colloquialism.

Right. I'm telling you, I'm not using the colloquial term. 


> Here is the crux of my point; your argument about lower frequency = more penetration would mean that (colloquial) radio waves, which have been used for literal centuries would penetrate deeper than 5G micro waves. 

Any point about potential hazards to health aside - they do penetrate deeper. This is not up to discussion or debate. Why do you think radio waves (in the colloquial sense) pass easily through several walls, yet wifi struggles with just a couple? Why do you think they travel kilometers through the atmosphere? Again, why do you think you can listen to the radio indoors in a dark room while its sunny outside? This is basic Electromagnetics.

Lower frequency waves don't have enough energy to be absorbed by most materials, and simply pass through without interacting.

Why do you think glass is transparent to visible light, but blocks higher-frequency UV light?"
changemyview,fnoushl,t1_fnoufgg,1587134002.0,"I think your confusion is coming from the fact that em wave range scale is logarithmic. Radio waves is a catch-all term which 5G falls under - not next to. When i say ""in the neighborhood of 5G"" I mean ""radio""."

Either way. They are certainly in the neighborhood of 5G

5G - I agree. Some radio waves do penetrate into the human body.  
  

>Because cellular ion channels do not interact with electromagnetic energy of that wavelength due to being electromagnetically triggered processes that are not receptive to electromagnetic induction. (If it was, getting an MRI would kill you a thousand times over).

You don't know that. They very well could.  I believe its possible the electric field itself generates a higher/lower voltage difference on ion channels. I don't know what the implications of this are. It's likely any effects it has are negligible - it might just shift the noise a little bit."

If find it amazing you are refuting this claim in your first paragraph, then accepting it in your second.
