leagueoflegends,foefsse,t1_foanljj,1587702703.0,There should be a “watch Teemo die” subreddit. Overwatch has one for Mei.
UCSD,foe5oyq,t1_fodjjjz,1587696545.0,Downside is that many labs are not taking volunteers for the foreseeable future as we’re not allowed to start any new projects and can only have 1-2 people per lab even come in for the foreseeable future. Definitely recommend trying to get experience somewhere somehow. Graduated last June and got picked up as a lab manager by the fall with 1 quarter of research lab experience.

So every other week two presenters from different labs present the research they’re doing right now. We get Regents pizza for the meetings."
Immunology,fnwih83,t1_fnvbw8t,1587319004.0,"Yeah, it’s the Immunology Group Meeting, technically. The unofficial name for it is pizza meeting. I’m on the email list for journal club, I just forget to attend whenever it starts. I also don’t have the article for each week. I assume you’re in Dr. Chang’s lab?"

Immunology,fnv5n1v,t1_fnv5g8g,1587281070.0,"Oh nice! It’s unfortunate you have to spend your last month in the current situation. Our floor had a visiting scholar that left in mid-March. She was supposed to stay longer, but her home country was preparing to close their borders. 

I haven’t attended the journal clubs at all, but I really should especially now that they’re online. Did you attend the “pizza meetings” (group meetings) every other week?"

UCSD,fnu30tz,t3_g3r34v,1587253562.0,"Here was my journey to UCSD as someone out of state. I first went to school in Portland, Oregon. Didn’t like it so I moved in with family in the SF Bay Area and went to cc for a year. They’ll give preference to cc for transfers spent my third year of undergrad at UCSD as an out-of-State student, and then filed for in-state tuition the summer after for in-state tuition my final year. 

I would recommend going to a cc in Cali and paying out of state there for two years. Make sure you work part time, your parents don’t claim you on their taxes for the two years, and possibly take out some FAFSA loans at cc. When you apply for transfer, you should be elegible for in-state tuition. There’s some steps you should take when you start this, however."

apple,fnie94v,t3_g1tlgv,1586978514.0,"I'm considering upgrading my 6s to the new SE (2020) and then possibly upgrading to the newer phone model in September or towards the end of the year. Would this be a wise decision? I get $80 discounted right now from the 6s and see it devaluing further to $50 or $30 by the iPhone later this year. What would be the return/resell value out of the new SE 6 months down the line? Should I just wait to buy the new iPhone at the end of the year? I was going to buy the 11 Pro, but then I saw that this year's model will likely have 5G capability. I've had the 6s since it came out in 2015. Any advice is welcome."

Ask_Politics,fn0lfm9,t1_fn0dvhw,1586544106.0,"If you want to get more involved and run for a party officer as another person commented on the main thread, you can say you’ve been a member of the party for x number of years. If you’re n  out interested in things like that, then you don’t really need to register. Depending on your state, being in the party will let you vote in the primary, which I think is a lot more impactful than the general election. If this is the case in your state, is it not a hassle to constantly register with a party, de-register, and then re-register every 2 years?"
Ask_Politics,fn07hq8,t1_fmz7p7h,1586536819.0,"Yeah, I agree that you should register with the party you’re more Lille to vote in. It makes things easier down the road. However, OP could leave the party as a signal they disagree with where things are headed, and then re-register with the party before midterms. All in all the decision is up to them, and I’d rather they vote than stay home. To quote one of my favorite TV shows, “decisions are made by those who show up.”"
Ask_Politics,fmyyfev,t1_fmybs8c,1586499769.0,"Yeah, don’t sign up for that misleading far-right “American Independent Party” that intentionally misleads people opting to be listed as an independent voter."
Ask_Politics,fmyyc8m,t1_fmylnar,1586499683.0,"OP pretty much implied he’s going to vote blue regardless. They were looking at pros and cons of leaving the party. Cali’s primary is a “jungle” primary, so the top two vote-getters face off come general. For example, the 2016 senate race that Harris won was a democrat vs. democrat general election. 

OP would be missing out on party functions and some ability to vote (mostly presidential candidate). They wouldn’t be prevented from participating in local elections. 

I appreciate the copy pasta, but it doesn’t contribute to the discussion OP was seeking."
Ask_Politics,fmyy3l3,t3_fy4xfh,1586499446.0,"At this point since Cali already had the primary, not really any point in changing party affiliation for general election. If you want to vote for a democrat in the 2024 primary, you’ll need to re-register with the party. If I recall correctly, our primary for other positions is a jungle primary, so I don’t think you need to be registered with a party to vote in the 2022 midterms."
