UCSantaBarbara,fpmds6b,t3_gea5g8,1588730872.0,I was wondering too. I looked them up on the PSTAT website and it looks they’re a graduate student so I’m not sure many people would have experience with them aside from as a TA maybe.
UCSantaBarbara,fplrkqe,t3_ge7fv6,1588718120.0,I haven’t heard back either.

Neither degree is very quantitative as they don’t require much math. The only math classes required are calculus 1 and 2 but you’re free to take more math classes if you want. As far as classes in the major that are quantitative we have two econometrics classes but not much beyond that. I transferred here as an econ major and after realizing I wanted a degree that was far more quantitative I switched to stats.

2. No. I’ve heard the econ grad program is great here but we don’t have a five year masters program. 

3. Financial math and statistics is like a blend between math/econ/stats. You take all the lower divison math and econ classes and then your upper divison classes a pretty evenly split between all three departments but leaning more towards statistics classes. Heres a link to the major sheet if you want to take a look at it.

This website shows you all the available online CC courses that will fill requirements at UCSB. I’d just double check assist.org to make sure they would transfer over."
UCSantaBarbara,fkw86lu,t3_fl26ht,1584585727.0,I would say you use a lot of 10A in 100B. Like someone else said the first 3 topics in 100B are pretty much just a review of 10A. After those topics the concepts are very similar in the way that you maximize functions. I wouldn’t count on the department waiving 10A nor would I reccomend skipping it if they did.
