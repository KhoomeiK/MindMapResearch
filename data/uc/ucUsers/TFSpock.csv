SG: Singleton / Bernard / Clark 

SF:  Jaquez / Juzang (if he gets a waiver) / Kyman

PF: Smith* / Nwuba

C: Hill* / Riley

** if they return, which I'd say Hill is 95% likely and Smith 75% likely. If Smith leaves Jaquez probably starts at the 4 with Juzang at the 3"
ucla,fox0msj,t1_fouxgqk,1588131271.0,we can't have nice things huh
nba,fovu49m,t1_fouycfr,1588107555.0,"In the same boat as a student. Good for him, but did he really have to leave us high and dry looking to fill the scholarship last-minute? Especially since he committed in August and probably took us out of the running for other recruits. Tyger is literally the only point guard on the roster now."
CollegeBasketball,fovf32r,t1_fovc0e4,1588100244.0,I mean Tyger pretty much played 40 mins a game this year so it won't be too different. Maybe we can get a transfer for depth? (If there are any left)
CollegeBasketball,foveenm,t1_fov34aa,1588099925.0,"I'm gonna bag on him, this guy committed to us in August and probably took us out of the running for many other recruits only to leave us high and dry last minute like this. I can't respect that. Go get that bag sure, but I'm not rooting for him when he fucked over our team"
CollegeBasketball,fotckqg,t1_fosulm9,1588050096.0,"We had a couple decommits after Alford got canned. As confounding as it is to us fans, this kid probably got to know Manning and the staff on a personal level over the course of months if not years, and liked them and the team enough to commit."
CollegeBasketball,folki00,t1_folausv,1587864198.0,"He's from LA, he'd definitely be able to cite family reasons as why he transferred."
nba,fo93kvn,t3_g64zs0,1587609753.0,"Nic Claxton! Didn't get a lot of minutes next year but his potential is insane. He shot 56% (!!!) from 3 in the G-League this year, if that eventually translates to the NBA and he bulks up a bit he'll be great. Jarrett Allen called him the most talented player on the team other than KD, and I can kinda see why."
CollegeBasketball,fncki3u,t1_fncf7xj,1586839085.0,Nah they’re not world beaters but I think they both make the tournament at the very least. I don’t think there’s a clear favorite in conference next year but a lot of good teams which is exciting.
CollegeBasketball,fncj5cn,t1_fnchw1o,1586838087.0,"Surprised, mostly. Always glad to see top croots land in the Pac-12 tho (unless it's zona or usc). Next year's gonna be very interesting, the conference is wide open imo."
CollegeBasketball,fncemya,t3_g0xy7l,1586834899.0,WOAH! PAC IS BACK!
CollegeBasketball,fncdcb6,t3_g0wwpm,1586834026.0,Just rip the band-aid off man I'm tired of waiting. As long as it isn't USC I'll be ok.
CollegeBasketball,fn97wiv,t1_fn7pb93,1586762572.0,"Honestly I'd be ok with saving the scholarship for a 2021 recruit or a transfer. We could possibly go 12 deep next year if Juzang gets his waiver, so it might not even necessary to look for another contributor."
ucla,fn975di,t1_fn96t9o,1586761789.0,"Ah, you're in the same boat as me then. Either way you've still got some options - unless you absolutely can't afford to re-take it, there's no harm in switching to p/np late in the game (if you're worried about GPA) or dropping if you really think you're gonna fail the class. Worst case scenario, you have to put off declaring your major by a quarter. 
But yea it'd help if we had more specifics about the class."
ucla,fn96g4n,t3_g0dn00,1586761077.0,"Switch it to p/np, and you've got until week 10 to drop it. One of the very few benefits of this corona horror show is that you've got a lot more flexibility when it comes to academics."
CollegeBasketball,fn6ajy5,t3_fzl6nk,1586693596.0,"We're pretty deep in the backcourt, so I'm not sure about this one. He'll be fighting for playing time with David Singleton, Jules Bernard and Jaylen Clark, and Daishen Nix might get minutes at the 2 depending on his fit with Tyger Campbell. 
We have one open scholarship, two if Smith leaves, but I think we'd go after another wing or big rather than a guard."
ucla,fn1y1eh,t1_fn0ydrz,1586572883.0,"Tbh, I'd rather that all those throwaway accounts are left up. Let the people see what their elected representatives really think of them."
CollegeBasketball,fn0yia7,t3_fykwak,1586551236.0,"Kinda funny to see Alford > Cronin. Probably because of Alford's performance at New Mexico but still, I'm little surprised Cronin wasn't higher than 94"
ucla,fn0p8n5,t3_fyli0x,1586546141.0,"Imagine if you called your Congressman's office to complain about a vote or position, and the person on the line called you privileged and bitched at you for not understanding how important they are to this country and how you're ungrateful for not appreciating them more.

THAT is why USAC is a joke."
ucla,fn0ospg,t1_fn0kt9d,1586545901.0,"Listen homie, I used to intern for a Congressman back home. I got calls from angry people all over the state (some not even from our district!)
Never at any point was I directed to dismiss their concerns or insult them personally. If they called me or the Congressman an asshole or hack or literally the fucking devil I was always instructed to respond with patience, kindness and understanding.

Clearly you clowns don't understand that. Learn how to lead. If USAC means anything more to you than a resume boost, I'd suggest being a little less condescending to your constituents."
ucla,fn0o5ns,t1_fmyktmg,1586545558.0,lol bruh this is your argument? We pay ~$240 a year in fees no? This shit isn't free either way
ucla,fmybg7c,t1_fmyas7s,1586482301.0,"I had previously read and upvoted your comment above, thanks for assuming I didn't. I was responding to your colleague, who should've followed your lead rather than personally attacking OP."
ucla,fmxrrns,t3_fxx7ej,1586470606.0,Hopefully he can get a waiver to play next year; this is an excellent pickup.
ucla,fmxrfnv,t1_fmxqj21,1586470422.0,"Trying to discredit your constituents for having concerns about your organization's actions is not leadership, it's cowardice. If he's misinformed, do a better job informing."
ucla,fmsmal6,t3_fws8yx,1586358212.0,"Public Policy 10B with Dukakis & Mitchell. Not too much work, the class is driven by guest speakers from various fields who are generally pretty interesting. Dukakis is a super interesting guy as well with a lot of perspective (he was the Democratic nominee for president in 1988).
One of UCLA’s hidden gems IMO"
nba,fmmmwo1,t3_fw4vv3,1586208216.0,"Two KDs, start Dinwiddie? I’m ok with that. They can take both forward spots"
ucla,fmd04nk,t3_fuirdh,1585956416.0,"They'll turn off water and power and save money on their precious utility bill.

I honestly might try to find a place off campus to sublet for the quarter. Might as well at this point"
