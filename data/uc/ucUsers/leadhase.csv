columbia,fpekxva,t3_gcljop,1588549548.0,I personally think it's a better life move to have a college experience far away from home. You have more independence and interact with people different than you're used to. I say that as I stayed in CA for my undergrad and am now out here. It's refreshing to see alternate perspectives and personalities.
cycling,fpe4olj,t1_fpe21bl,1588540280.0,"> Collectively, these data suggest: (1) there is limited evidence that supports the “Extreme exercise hypothesis,” the most compelling relating to the increased risk of atrial fibrillation at high volumes of exercise; (2) cardiac anomalies may be present in a small proportion of the most active veteran athletes; and (3) the combination of high-intensity physical activity in the presence of known or occult CVD, seems to be the major cause of exercise-related fatalities.

just a google search, I'm by no means an expert

I get to the car, take my clothes off by turning them inside out, and immediately shower and scrub. Then in a few days I'm the only one that has it. Just wtf.

When I have it I repeatedly think, man life was just so easy and nice before, why the hell was I taking 'not having poison oak right now' for granted?"

I frkn love trad climbing personally. If you're not leading tho I understand why it could blow. You're just removing pieces and waiting for them to build the anchor. And if they're not an efficienct climber it could take forever. However with trad you can go so many super fun routes. And crack climbing is somewhat of learned fun, once you get the hang of it it's sooo satisfying. But yes you can never make someone like something, especially your partner. Climbing..skiing.. yup"
