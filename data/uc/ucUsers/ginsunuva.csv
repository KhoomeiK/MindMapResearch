You need to:

1. Use it sublingually for optimal effects. Swallowing it alone will hit too gradually to receive much CEVs

2. Not be taking any supplements which inhibit activity such as L-Glutamine or Inositol.

3. Put your head face down with a blindfold and concentrate for at least a minute or so, then continue there for many minutes.

Most visuals seem to happen in between the comeup and the peak.  
And when they do, they are EXTREMELY visible. Undeniably there, not like faint black outlines.  

In fact, the picture in this post I would consider to be some mild weaker CEVs I would see on a lower dose or comedown. Mine are more along the lines of things like this https://gfycat.com/hoteducateddunnart but of course are still not comparable."
