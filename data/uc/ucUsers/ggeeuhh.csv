UCSantaBarbara,fp09tjj,t3_gad7tb,1588205179.0,"I actually gained weight and became a little more chunky since coming to UCSB LOL nobody cares for sure but i will say the most common body types to see here is either people having a little chub and bloating (from all the drinking ) or people being incredibly thin and NO body fat / are muscular . Either way, nobody really cares what u look like and the scenery actually motivates me to want to lose my weight (not the size of the others around me).  Just be confident in yourself, ur personality is what matters in life in general :)"
shameless,fi1y4oo,t3_f4zhi0,1582067214.0,"not sure why some people think I’m lying but that’s ok haha i only posted this to the subreddit cus i wanted everyone thats a fan of shameless to know he’s super chill in real life and a nice dude! Also i thought it was really cool that i was able to kick it with him and his friends for as long as i did. Still not sure why he even came to a UCSB frat party Saturday night to begin with but glad him and his friends did. He even paid for my friends uber back to my house, hella nice."
