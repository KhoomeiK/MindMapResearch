Why should I be upset that she took safety precautions that, when met with an actual predator, could save her life? Good on her for being aware of her surroundings."

Both were fantastic. Part of the reason the movie was so good is that it was almost word for word the book. The issue is the book was a bit of a drug fueled rant, a good one, but it certainly had its incoherent moments. The movie removed some of those parts and polished what it kept."
AskReddit,fp11qrx,t3_gaepss,1588222085.0,"Complete lack of faith in any system. Utter disillusionment. 

We are entirely post 9/11, consider all that’s happened since then and where we are now. Consider the type of world we’ve grown up in. I had an emotional reaction to an 80’s news cast recently because the worst thing on it was a helicopter crash and the president discussing an economic bill. I could barely imagine a competent president, or not hearing about ANOTHER massacre. All of our societal systems have let us down. Government? Look at the news for 5 minutes and tell me you’re encouraged. School? Frequent shootings, admissions scandals, student debt, and all of it rapidly losing funding. Religion? Protecting pedos and #metoo. Fucking entertainment? Also protecting pedos and #metoo. The Boy Scouts of America? The hallmark of providing structure to a young child’s life? Protecting pedos and #metoo, but also bankrupt. 
All that’s left is the military. We can’t afford any other structure without it. Just another way we’re being taken advantage of, as if all the other #metoo structures hadn’t done it first. 

I’d say at least we have our health but we couldn’t afford it. Not even taking into account the global fucking pandemic. 

And we’re all so hopeless about the situation that influencers have to beg for money to live on over the internet."
UCSantaBarbara,fp07d23,t3_gad7tb,1588203860.0,"Firstly, love yourself and fuck what others say. You are you, and you are loved. 

Secondly, a little? but not really. When I first got to UCSB I was 30/35 pounds overweight. Not obese but clearly not skinny. Some things in particular will be kind of tough. Riding or walking to and from classes can be tiring at first, but it won’t take long till it becomes second nature. Between that and the heat I was sweating non-stop for about 2 weeks. Nearly everyone there is skinny and attractive. Kind of intimidating, even though it’s very clear that most people don’t care and those that do don’t matter to anyone there. For this reason it’s kind of weird to do stuff like take off my shirt at the beach (male). Genuinely though, it doesn’t really matter, it just feels like it does. Especially with dating. If anything UCSB culture has shown me just how much I hold myself back because I think others are judging my weight. 

Thirdly, because of the really active lifestyle I lost some weight. Plus there’s a wide variety of healthy choices at the dining commons which I took advantage of, and an absolute unit of a gym which I went to everyday. I lost about 10/15 pounds by halfway through last quarter and it was noticeable. Regardless, the point is that if you choose to take advantage of them, there are a lot of options that can help you live a healthier lifestyle."
AskMen,fooapzo,t3_g8asyd,1587935674.0,"Was about 12, at Boy Scout camp in the woods. I was getting the wilderness survival merit badge. We had been building shelters out of whatever we could find in the woods and at the end of the week we’d sleep in them overnight. I was by no means popular, I didn’t fit in or had a lot of really good friends. So there were a bunch of shelters with 2 or 3 guys in it, I was the only one in a single person shelter. The night before, my shabby shelter was knocked over somehow. I don’t know how, but it was just a pile of sticks on the floor next to a tree. 

That night I slept in the rubble of my shelter. Now because I’m not the brightest bulb in the knife drawer, I thought a space blanket and pajamas would keep me warm. I also knew that a sleeping bag wouldn’t fit in my shelter. Regardless, as it got later into the night the wind came. I was alone in the woods freezing cold and it’s getting colder. I was scared. Really scared. I heard a rustling in the area and I figured the other boys were just trying to fuck with me. I got mad and wasn’t scared at all anymore, cold. Freezing cold. But not scared. I started reading my Percy Jackson books with my book light and toughed out the night with spite and annoyance. I couldn’t feel my toes and it was just getting colder, and I had no shelter. 

Turns out there were coyotes in the area. Not close enough to stop the night apparently, but definitely close enough for alarm. They probably should’ve stopped the night. 

You bet your ass I got that merit badge."
