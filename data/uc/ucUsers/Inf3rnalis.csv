Dude what the hell, is this a southern thing? Because I live in California and I swear even our racists are that blatant, these people are awful, you need to tell the boyfriend how wrong all of this is, show him this post, explain what’s going on and say look this is on you. If he doesn’t man up and deal with his family then you leave him. If he cares about you he wouldn’t tolerate this for a second, if I was him the very first time they made a racist comment, joke, or said the tucking nword that would’ve been game. Like the reaction a normal person has to that is “what the fuck is wrong with you, we’re gonna go get out of the house for awhile, and I’ll be happy to explain to you why that is an insane thing to say once you come to your senses and apologize” 

If he cared about you he’d do something about it"

bernieblindness,fox7und,t1_fox6y05,1588136256.0,"I disagree. The fundamental principle of representative democracy is that every person has a vote and they cast it in favor of the person they feel best represents them. I can’t vote for something I’d never endorse, knowing how many civilians will die from the wars he continues and expands, knowing how many people will be wasting away in prison for nonviolent drug crimes,  how many Americans will die because they’re afraid to go to the doctor, or because they can’t afford their medication. How many people will live in tents along the highway. The number of women who will be assaulted by men like him. I can’t sign my name on to that, I can’t have that on my conscience. I’m not even saying I don’t agree with you, yeah me not voting for Biden in a round about way helps trump. I disagree that it’s a valid logic to apply here but I can understand it. And maybe you’re right and I should be voting for Biden. Even if I thought it was the the right thing to do, I still couldn’t do it, even if Biden losing is the fault of people like me, I still wouldn’t regret it. I can’t live like that, knowing every day that I signed up for it."

bernieblindness,fox4qt6,t1_fox3j3k,1588134035.0,"But he won’t do that, Joe Biden already said if Medicare for all was dropped at his desk he wouldn’t sign it. He actively disagrees with progressive policy positions, he said he doesn’t believe in full legalization of marijuana, he doesn’t want the same things as me, I don’t think we could actually agree on any single major issue. I want Medicare for all, he doesn’t, I want tuition free public college, he doesn’t, I want legal weed, he does not, I want to end the wars, he obviously sees that very differently. Joe Biden is a corporatist, center-right authoritarian, a neo-liberal and a capitalist; I am a leftist libertarian, progressive populist, and social democrat. I will not vote for someone with whom I disagree."

techsupport,fojfc4v,t3_g7lexl,1587819282.0,"Well first things first, idc about your download speed if you’re having upload problems, I’d bet your up is somewhere around 30-40 Mbps, Mb stands for Megabit which is 1/8 of a megabyte (MB) btw, so I’d be willing to bet your upload is somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.75-5 MB’s per second. One minute of 1080p60 video is like 160MB, so a 30 minute video is around 4.8 GB. At 3.75 MBps the video would take 21min20sec to upload, at 5 MBps it would take 16min. So keep in mind to begin with, it’s not going to be uploading anything particularly quickly. 

From what you described though it does seem like you’re having some additional issue. Call your ISP is step one and make sure there’s nothing wrong in their end. Then get rid of any weird software you’ve installed (antivirus software and whatnot), make sure your drivers are up to date if you have a wireless card, update/fresh install of windows, also consider getting a proper router if you haven’t already, the one ATT gives you is shit. Non of those things are specifically going to fix it for sure, but they could, and they’re things you should do anyway so it’s a good starting point."

Will absolutely fuck the car, but it isn’t quite as obvious that someone did it intentionally, and it’s easier to do secretly. Just run up with a funnel and a few gallon jugs of water and wreak havoc. The car will run for a bit but it’ll be clear something is wrong pretty quickly, if I doesn’t die immediately it’ll sputter and jolt and can damage the fuel system. If you wanna do any more damage do the same thing but with bleach."
