So can y’all drop his best/your favorite Juice Wrld songs outside of the more obvious picks like Legends and Lucid Dreams"

UCSantaBarbara,fncuaqt,t3_g0zofz,1586847444.0,"I took the 34a/34b series and haven’t felt behind in any of my upper div econ classes as a result. In my experience the only math specific knowledge I’ve really ever needed is algebra and knowledge of basic derivatives. That’s not to say that the 3A/3B series wouldn’t help you and isn’t the better choice over 34a/34b, but it wouldn’t set you behind or anything. If anything it would just kinda be a waste of time since the 34 series is really easy and you could learn a lot more from the 3 series."

He was arguably my favorite in TDE after Control System dropped, but everything after has been a letdown (and that’s with 3 year waits with damn near no features). I know people like DWTW, and there were definitely some gems on there, but it also had some truly terrible songs like Womonogomy and Wifey vs Wifi and overall was pretty mid. I’d also throw Tut in there as again all his work after Preacher’s Son (which was in 2015) has been completely forgettable and devoid of what made him a compelling artist."
