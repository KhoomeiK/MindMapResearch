Nope, it only has one velocity and that's perpendicular to the orbital radius.

Orbits are much more stable than you think. Things never fall outwards, that's climbing against gravity. They only fall inwards due to friction, such as satellites in the Earth's atmosphere.

> The sun doesn't ""hold"" things in orbit, it only attracts them towards itself. 

This part is true, but it turns out that's all you need to hold things in orbit (and sufficient initial angular velocity for the orbital radius you're trying to achieve).

> Things only orbit when they have just the right outward velocity to balance with the sun's gravitational attraction. 

Nope, they orbit whenever there's sufficient angular velocity to ""miss"" the Sun, which is really quite small unless you're very close to the Sun, in which case you're burnt toast.

> If the ball is in orbit and you accelerate it towards the sun at 50 m/s it will fall out of orbit towards the sun. 

50 m/s is a delta-v, not an acceleration. You could accelerate it at 50 m/s^(2) but you'd have to point it behind the Sun and make corrections as you get closer in order to hit it.

estimation,fns0qlw,t1_fnrysua,1587208827.0,"Orbiting is 100% about angular speed. Well, and orbital distance.

Imagine throwing a baseball from Earth's surface. Pretend there's no atmosphere and the Earth is perfectly flat so it won't hit anything but the ground.

Throw it at 50 m/s, it hits the ground some distance away. Throw it 500 m/s, it'll hit the ground some further distance away. At some point, you throw it fast enough that it ""misses"" the Earth and continues falling completely around - it's now in orbit. [Here's](https://www.windows2universe.org/physical_science/physics/mechanics/orbit/orbits_satellites_falling.html&edu=high) a better explanation and a nice little picture to help illustrate the point.

Now, back to our baseball from Pluto.. at that distance from the Sun, any slight movement perpendicular to the Sun is going to cause the ball to fall around the Sun instead of crashing into it. The amount of that perpendicular speed will affect the eccentricity of the orbit (how far it is from circular), but it will orbit nonetheless.

In a perfect universe, if you were to exactly cancel out the perpendicular velocity, then theoretically it would fall straight into the Sun. However, every other body in the Solar System including your own (and even stars billions of light years away - gravity extends to infinity) are affecting that ball and giving it some amount of perpendicular velocity, meaning it will never fall directly at the Sun without some kind of controlled correcting forces like a rocket booster.

&#x200B;

To give a real world analogy.. remember those funnel things at the mall you would put coins into and watch them spin around? [These things.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS_ATYovQRo) The coins always fall into the center eventually because of friction, but orbits don't have friction (well, they do from tidal forces in the body itself but those are negligible on time periods less than millions or billions of years).

Now imagine a coin funnel that's miles wide with a hole the size of a marble. Imagine taking a tiny steel ball bearing and trying to hit the center of the funnel exactly. You can't miss, because friction won't help you - it'll orbit the center indefinitely if you do.

Now imagine doing that while riding a skateboard around the circumference of the funnel. Now imagine there's orbiting magnets at various points in the funnel that are messing with its trajectory. The scale here is all messed up, but vastly in your favor.

Hitting the Sun with a baseball from Pluto is much, much harder than hitting that coin funnel center with the ball bearing"
estimation,fnrzc5p,t1_fnryqpb,1587207387.0,"Depends on what 'here' means. Earth's gravity well is far more significant than the Sun's to us, which is why we don't float off the ground when the sun rises. The moon's plays a small role which is why we have tides, but it isn't strong enough to pull us off the Earth's surface, and nor is the Sun's.

Lagrangian points are where the Earth's and Sun's gravity forces cancel each other out (more technically, an object at these points would stay in the same position relative to the Earth as it orbits the Sun). There are 5 of them, [shown here](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/internal_resources/3323).

Because you're moving a lot faster than that. 50m/s difference is going to make it orbit the sun in a very, very slightly more elliptical path. Angular momentum from the Sun's gravity is going to turn most anything at that distance into an orbit.

Tell this lady her son didn’t die because he couldn’t afford insulin

People are fucking dying dude."
todayilearned,fngqdkq,t1_fngptsc,1586941074.0,"Wrong, not unpopular. Plenty of people over at T_D saying the same thing.

If we adopted single payer our budget would increase due to all the new taxes. People would pay less, government would have more, and everyone saves money. Only ones worse off are pharma and insurance CEO’s and shareholders who are current profiting off of denying healthcare and overcharging for life saving meds. The fuck’s that got to do with the military, genius? 

Second, plenty of R&D has taken place at universities. Publicly funded universities. As in from taxpayer money, not private institutions. 

Guess how much of pharma company’s budget goes to research and development? A hell of a lot less than what goes to marketing and ads. And of that R&D a ridiculous amount is spent on copying patented drugs but changing them slightly to avoid getting sued.

So let’s recap.. we pay twice as much as other countries for worse care and more expensive drugs just so some rich assholes can have a place in the Hamptons. 

GTFO"

The government doesn’t make money and spend it, we pay taxes to the government and vote for legislators who decide how to spend that money.

It’s idiotic statements like that one that have convinced people any tax whatsoever is bad, even if it would save them money over the **private taxes** they fork over to Aetna every month."

My opposition relates to whether or not a) it’s doable, 2) what the cost is and what consequences for the rest of budget are. How are you going to find $35 trillion over the next 10 years without having profound impacts on everything from taxes for middle class and working class people as well as the impact on the rest of the budget?""

Which means he doesn't know it's cheaper than our current system.

Which means he has either ignored or doesn't believe the dozens of studies that say it is.

Which means he's either malicious or stupid, or both.

What the fuck does ""doable"" even mean? If we can put a man on the moon just to flex on Russia 50 years ago, we can figure out how to SAVE MONEY and give everyone healthcare in one fell swoop. He just doesn't want to.

He listens to CNN and MSNBC like Trump listens to FOX. It's sad and depressing."

I’ll be voting down ticket definitely, but Biden will have to move way left to earn my vote. His means-tested half measures aren’t nearly enough to ignore his decades of contributing to the problems we face as a country today. 

Your second paragraph is correct, but still contradicts the narrative during the primary. If ANYONE is concerned about Joe’s chances of winning now, then the whole electability argument was 100% bullshit from the start. 

The DNC and MSM weren’t even behind him until it was clear all the other corporatist cucks didn’t stand a chance and dropped out."

Plenty of time to finish the drink since you don’t need to start healing right away, and letting the tank build threat is a good strat anyway so you don’t pull healing aggro from adds."
