ucr,fpe1tp7,t3_gcxp5n,1588538672.0,i agree it‚Äôs really annoying but that‚Äôs also why i watch my lectures on 2x speed
ucr,fpah9v6,t1_fpa8ybr,1588448143.0,name every individual in your 300+ lecture

ucr,fp9sb0y,t1_fp9atje,1588433513.0,i didn‚Äôt...? reddit must be tweaking lol i only see it once and i only posted it once
ucr,fp8y09q,t1_fp8ux29,1588406987.0,yep and the deadline for guaranteed is may 10
ucr,fp8s5gd,t1_fp8qmul,1588401199.0,i‚Äôm not sure but possibly
ucr,fp085a5,t1_fp06k4b,1588204271.0,Np. I also emailed them a while back to check on my application status and they said they‚Äôll be updating students throughout summer too. Then I asked if I should apply for a residence hall in case and they said yes but never said anything about that interfering w your apartment contract (since res halls are binding). So I emailed them again to clarify and it‚Äôs been two weeks without a reply lol housing is so helpful
ucr,fp03kww,t3_gai7yq,1588201837.0,I applied early jan for glen mor and haven‚Äôt heard anything. Also kinda worried :/
ucr,fo0j26a,t1_fnfgxu4,1587414032.0,"If the chancellor's scholarship allows priority reg, don't join an LC. If not, then join it. If you have priority registration by any other means it lets you pick what your schedule will be like instead of taking whatever you LC gives you (you can't choose class times, teachers etc.)"
ucr,fo0ipau,t1_fntuguy,1587413851.0,imo most UC's are better for pre-med than cal states
ucr,fo0ikvs,t1_fnwz8z2,1587413787.0,Commute to save money. The residential food sucks and isn't worth the amount you pay.
ucr,fo0i8v9,t3_g4lgg2,1587413615.0,"Same thing happened to me senior year lol. I wouldn't feel too bad about it though.

1. Dining hall food is mediocre but you won't mind after a while. As for around the school I'd say there's a handful of good restaurants.
2. Put in the effort to get to know people at the beginning of the year and it won't be hard to make friends
3. In my experience, people here are pretty chill and not super competitive. I'm only a first year so I'm just taking lower divs but everyone seems willing to help each other out"
ucr,fnxnt9t,t1_fnxlyug,1587342557.0,Yes that‚Äôs correct. It also depends on your math placement. If you want to be done with the bio 5 series before second year (considering you start chem 1st quarter) you can take 5c over the summer.
ucr,fnws8er,t3_g45dm3,1587324430.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt be too concerned about UCR‚Äôs cheapest meal plan bc I‚Äôve found that one was sufficient. I ended every quarter with a lot of extra meal swipes.

1. Depends on your personal situation like the other comment said

2. There‚Äôs university village with food places and a movie theatre and there‚Äôs a mall but you have to drive to that.

3. Idk 

4. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty dry but not unbearable. It‚Äôs usually just dryer in the winter."
