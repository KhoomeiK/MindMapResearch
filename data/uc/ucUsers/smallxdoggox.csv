OculusQuest,fnk6qh9,t1_fnk5yqw,1587016639.0,I don’t see why pistol whip isn’t on safe options
OculusQuest,fnk6ot0,t1_fnk2zj1,1587016600.0,Omg get pistol whip. They said it’s like beat saber but you shoot enemies to the beat and dodge bullets like super hot but it’s way faster. That was actually the most intense  and fun experience I had. My headset just came in today!!! Climb is also ridiculously good. I can see myself playing that consistently because it’s so beautiful and actually pretty challenging.
