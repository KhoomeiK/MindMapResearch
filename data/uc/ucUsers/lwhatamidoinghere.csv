ucla,fo77549,t1_fo1vsmh,1587573407.0,I think a huge part of how bike friendly UCLA is dependent on where your classes are.  I personally bought a bike while at UCLA and was able to cut my 15 minute speed walk down to 7 minutes.  I have found some routes that use things like the parking structure elevators to avoid stairs.  If you have a bike there’s nothing to lose. There are plenty of racks that are available to just stow the bike.  I won’t lie to you and say that it isn’t hilly.  However it is doable and can be quite fun zooming down the hills

ucla,fmfoawu,t1_fmezy0t,1586031444.0,The email specifically mentioned Dykstra and DeNeve. Maybe it doesn’t affect your dorm??
