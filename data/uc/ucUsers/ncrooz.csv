UCSD,fpaot2y,t3_gcbh2c,1588452597.0,"My refund processed on 4/17 and I just checked the mail today and I got my check (I don’t have direct deposit). If you don’t have direct deposit, it should take around 1-2 weeks for your check to come in the mail :)"

UCSD,fonj4mx,t3_g8dl3f,1587920483.0,"I feel you. Chemistry is one of my worst subjects and I felt pretty hopeless on that quiz even when it was open note. And honestly was surprised when we had to upload 3 different PDFs, it just stressed me out even more."
UCSD,folyps9,t1_folnyu1,1587873720.0,My chem professor gave us an extra 15 minutes to upload and it really made a difference. Wish all professors would do it.

UCSD,fobe4hm,t3_g6orsh,1587658873.0,"I would say go for the double and worst case you just get a triple. I was in a triple the past year and although I loved my roommates, the room was so crammed (which was expected but it would’ve still been nice to have a little more room). I didn’t live in the village so the rooms may be bigger or smaller than what I lived in."

UCSD,fo14ibm,t1_fnxeh2k,1587425580.0,"Hi! I’m currently a first year molecular and cell biology major and I was accepted off the waitlist last year in late April. I basically lost all my hope when I was waitlisted because biology is impacted at UCSD and I didn’t think I’d have a chance of getting in, so I actually committed to UCR, like you. UCSD was also my dream school. It’s certainly possible to get accepted off the waitlist, it really just depends on factors that are not in our control. Hope for the best but also be prepared for the worst. Good luck!"
UCSD,fnkc40h,t3_g27ln3,1587021621.0,"Molecular and cell bio major here. You will have to take math 11 because it’s a requirement for all bio majors. I took it fall quarter last year and it wasn’t too bad, and it was my first stats class. Since you already took a stats class, you should be more than fine in the class."
