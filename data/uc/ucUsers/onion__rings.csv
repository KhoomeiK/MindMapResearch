cscareerquestions,fpmyma8,t1_fpkqp9u,1588745148.0,Any project will help you stand out and give you something to talk about during interviews.
csMajors,fpmyaq5,t3_gee5nf,1588744904.0,"Took lin alg in high school, ended with only an algorithmic understanding of it (how to compute null space, gram schmidt, etc). Took the theoretical upper division version and it gave me a much deeper understanding, once you get past the computations. For my undergrad machine learning, a basic understanding sufficed. Maybe you can take the ml course and brush up on your lin alg when it's needed."
ucla,fp8xsme,t3_gbyk37,1588406769.0,Yuta is pretty clear.

ucla,fo3t620,t3_g54peu,1587492530.0,"If the math Dept provides the option for pnp, then the engineering school will allow the pnp course for major requirements."

csMajors,fnrqisf,t3_g3jfjt,1587197799.0,"If it's any help, I feel finding jobs should be relatively equal among these two. I attend UCLA which is definitely not as esteemed in cs, but I ended up with FANG internships just like my friends at CMU or MIT. It's more about what you do with yourself. Considering this, I feel that being happy is the most important thing to consider. Having rigorous academics is nice, but I feel doesn't really matter in the end."
ucla,fno3ryt,t1_fno3c0r,1587110988.0,"10 or 15 short-ish free response I think. Pretty easy, I don't remember them requiring much creativity. Like eggert style but easier.

Yeah, it'll be pretty obvious which topics are given a separate section in the book but aren't discussed at length in lecture (If I remember correctly, one was a scheduling algorithm another was a raid configuration)."
ucla,fno1tga,t3_g2w9vj,1587108990.0,"Which Prof? I had reiher and you could get away with the slides only, but I recall one question on each exam discussing a topic that was only covered in readings. I would recommend studying the profs content closely, and skimming to see the sections they didn't address."
ucla,fncx35b,t3_g0tjw9,1586850232.0,"31 is trivial except for some c++ minutiae, 32 easy if you had any experience with data structures before."
ucla,fmz04dt,t3_fy3crj,1586501470.0,If you wanna do software in industry I'd recommend taking the cs degree.
ucla,fmrtzpb,t3_fx24tf,1586335398.0,Reinmans exams were pretty trivial for my quarter. Just do the labs properly and you should be fine.
ucla,fmh1y31,t1_fmh1f4j,1586064166.0,"Both are important, but 180 is much more important for general 
software engineering interviews."
