UCSantaBarbara,fpj559r,t3_gdr4l3,1588656894.0,No business minor but thereâ€™s TMP (technology management program) which is pretty much the same thing
UCSantaBarbara,fpiznm8,t1_fpin5x2,1588652636.0,Thank you. Do you know how they find out/if you can keep what they already paid?
UCSantaBarbara,fpiy7q5,t1_fpiwfn2,1588651579.0,I literally donâ€™t know bc i got a letter in the mail asking me to submit some more info and I just ignored it...wasnâ€™t expecting to get it at all
UCSantaBarbara,fpit43n,t1_fpipv9g,1588648107.0,Hahaha looking forward to it
UCSantaBarbara,fpimh2n,t1_fpidjif,1588643982.0,Is it closer to the stables or to the actual beach?
UCSantaBarbara,fpby0o0,t1_fpbu79x,1588481734.0,"Thank you!!! My house has been doing this too, and most of the groups I see at the beach are also entire households that are only interacting with each other. And tbh i think a bigger issue is the ridiculous amount of people who are coming from outside of IV to go to our beach and yet no one is questioning them?"
Jazz,fopc31v,t1_fop2mur,1587957799.0,"Thank you, you have no idea how much this helped!! It seems so obvious now but its difficult when you donâ€™t listen to very much jazz"
Jazz,fopbsec,t1_fop205z,1587957601.0,Yes thank you this helped me so much!!
Jazz,foozm1k,t1_fooyrxc,1587949842.0,"Ah ok, one more question! To find the b part do I literally just need to count 16 bars and thatâ€™s immediately where it starts?"
Jazz,fooynzr,t1_fooyhvj,1587949264.0,"Also Iâ€™m listening to one off of Blue Train, so the original version I suppose."
Jazz,fooyhvj,t1_fooxtf4,1587949160.0,Lazy Bird by Coltrane. And do you mind elaborating on that a little bit? Do the solos not add to the total 32 bars? Like at what point would the A part give way to the B part and how do the solos fit into that?
Jazz,fooqqm3,t1_fooq82m,1587944458.0,Ah okay that makes sense! Iâ€™d never heard bass played like that before so I was a little confused. Thank you!
UCSantaBarbara,foixq2u,t3_g7ovel,1587800617.0,"SB actually has a ton of start ups and tech companies. For example, Sonos is an SB company, and they make stuff thatâ€™s very well known and used around the world (and they love hiring UCSB grads). Itâ€™s obviously no SF but I think opportunities will continue to grow here. 
Also IV has a reputation for being unaffordable but you can easily find cheaper housing, especially if you live further from DP. All in all, UCSB is great and I think youâ€™ll be pleasantly surprised by how much opportunity there is here! Also yeah, you canâ€™t beat living by the beach lol."
UCSantaBarbara,foeiieh,t3_g71gpa,1587704660.0,"Pretty sure you can still get paid w your work study, you should look into that first"
UCSantaBarbara,fod7m6h,t3_g6vlgl,1587681264.0,"Look up AS CoC, they are recruiting for a bunch of positions, and I definitely saw one regarding budgets and student fees. Itâ€™s not an internship but at least itâ€™s something!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnqrq84,t3_g3e00n,1587170776.0,"just look up gaviota hot springs, itâ€™s pretty lackluster tho tbh"
UCSantaBarbara,fnpvpwe,t1_fnpmrf7,1587152869.0,source?
UCSantaBarbara,fnc14be,t3_g0ujfb,1586826422.0,Lmfao all I can say is I also know some of these ppl and Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m not the only one who thinks they suck ðŸ˜‚
UCSantaBarbara,fmtnfwh,t1_fmsmzmk,1586375741.0,"Theyâ€™re only providing low rate alternatives to pacify us and make it seem like they are working for us. We pay for a lot more than just the rec cen, for example we pay for a bunch of festivals that arenâ€™t happening and that money should go back to students. We pay for the infrastructure and maintenance of buildings that are in no way being used or maintained e.g the library. The fees we pay for these things (which is by no means an exhaustive list) are only for these things. This money doesnâ€™t pay my professors salaries, that comes from a different budget and theyâ€™re going to get paid no matter what. I really donâ€™t see what is so hard to understand about the fact that we are paying extraordinary amounts of money for educational experiences that arenâ€™t just different but quite literally subpar"
UCSantaBarbara,fmr0enu,t1_fmqz5m3,1586311013.0,"Well good thing they just laid off a bunch of students including myself, so there should be plenty of money to go around now"
UCSantaBarbara,fmqro9l,t1_fmqq2xd,1586305599.0,"yeah and itâ€™s inaccurate...i have to pay taxes no matter what so I donâ€™t really have a choice. Here I am paying for a service which is now basically non existent. We are getting absolutely robbed by the UC system, no matter how you spin it"
UCSantaBarbara,fmqp2l7,t1_fmqjd0x,1586304041.0,"?? They arenâ€™t the same at all. I pay taxes just like everyone else and I donâ€™t mind because I benefit from them directly as well as indirectly. None of us are benefitting at all from anything because we literally cannot use the services we are paying for. If youâ€™re not upset about then good for you, itâ€™s nice to have that kind of privilege, but donâ€™t condescend to me when the fact is we are not getting the same educational experience and yet we are paying for it."
UCSantaBarbara,fmqbb0u,t1_fmq4skb,1586296397.0,Yeah except for they already took all our money ðŸ¥´
UCSantaBarbara,fmqb73a,t1_fmq5wul,1586296339.0,"Still doesnâ€™t make sense to me why that responsibility is being put on students who are currently struggling to pay for basic things, especially since most of us donâ€™t have jobs anymore. UCSB should use money from elsewhere to pay back its own loans, rather than take it from us. When everything returns to normal Iâ€™m happy to continue paying for these things but for now it makes absolutely no sense.
Edit: plus part of the rec cen fee is literally just the membership, so Iâ€™d like that money back. If I cant access it, I shouldnâ€™t be paying for it."
UCSantaBarbara,fmpujl0,t3_fwqsnj,1586287594.0,"Itâ€™s not fair that we are paying for services we arenâ€™t using. We should not have to be paying for rec cen memberships we wonâ€™t use, fees for printing labs we canâ€™t access, AS fees that will be doing nothing, and any of the other miscellaneous fees they like to sprinkle in to our tuition. They canâ€™t ignore us forever and eventually this will have to be addressed!

Edit: to all the people who are defending the UCâ€™s choice to not refund our money...how do those boots taste?"
UCSantaBarbara,fmpsoib,t3_fwqa49,1586286620.0,lolll they rly think this is gonna fly??! No fucking way! Literally what the fuck are we paying for?
UCSantaBarbara,fmnfw7f,t3_fwbj06,1586225136.0,"You can always drop later, best to enroll now if you can do you get the classes you want"
UCSantaBarbara,fmlyj6q,t1_fmkl9tx,1586195522.0,maybe if enough ppl donâ€™t want to buy their own we can split the cost and share the link? Idk if that works but Iâ€™d be down!
UCSantaBarbara,flo8jtz,t1_flo2kkn,1585333577.0,"Hey thanks, I didnâ€™t realize this. No it wonâ€™t help right now but itâ€™s definitely not nothing!"
