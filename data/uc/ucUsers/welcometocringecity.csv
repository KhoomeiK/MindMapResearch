ucla,fp4otrs,t3_gb2sym,1588303801.0,I feel like a lot of ppl don't realize that pandemics have 2 peaks...
ucla,foej9u6,t1_foeivg8,1587705231.0,"Yea it's a better deal if they confess because if they don't, Nag will turn it over to the Dean & they'll track whoever did it thru Chegg's database. & in that case it would be out of his hands & they would have to deal with whatever consequences the Dean deems appropriate"
ucla,foedwlo,t3_g716w7,1587701441.0,I would tell your professors everything you said: your parents are healthcare workers sick with COVID & you are feeling the symptoms. I would hope they wouldn't expect you to proceed normally in that incredibly stressful situation; you could be honest with them about your situation and say you don't know how you'll be able to take midterms when you're literally sick. I'm incredibly sorry that you have to deal with this and I wish you and your family well :(

& historically USAC doesn't do much to benefit the student body, meanwhile they get to decide how much money we give to them on a quarterly basis ($200+ I believe?). The additional fee may not seem like a big deal but this is just a slippery slope towards them incrementally tacking on more & more fees. I bet if they turned their attention towards tracking where their spending goes & how to spend it most efficiently, they would have more than enough to do actual meaningful things. Instead they're being wreckless w their power & forcing the burden onto students rather than taking accountability. 

Yesterday when someone posted about this fee increase (https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/fxy4rl/usac_is_once_again_trying_to_increase_your_fees/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), USAC's response was not to be civil & listen to the concerns of their constituents, but instead to downvote & suppress public opinion (https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/fyjyls/so_my_friend_is_a_lower_level_usac_affiliate_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), which is the opposite of what they should be doing as a glorified student council.


Edit: I think this post is a good representation of USAC's incompetency & elitism https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/8h1fk8/an_open_letter_to_rucla_and_anyone_who_has_been/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
Mcat,fmquo48,t3_fwvgn3,1586307437.0,"I feel like AAMC will develop something similar. I don't think social distancing measures will lighten up universally across states for awhile. But also we still don't know how admissions will be affected by the pandemic so maybe they'll cancel the test for a year if med schools decide to suspend admissions until things return back to normal. Otherwise if admissions continue then they'll probably try to provide testing in some format to make money n stuff.

And the normal LSAT has a duplicate of the same type of question (logical reasoning I think ?) and the LSAT FLEX just cut one of the sections (so it still has one LR section). But I don't think they would shorten the online version of the MCAT as I don't really know if they would be able to cut a section."
