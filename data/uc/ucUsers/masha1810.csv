UCSantaBarbara,edtobpz,t3_aer0ut,1547229130.0,"I'm in the same boat. I didn't fail on the econ 10A retake, I got a B-. which is still not good enough but its an upgrade from the C that I got in the class. I think there is hope. I mean what is it, 9 more weeks to get our shit together, go to CLAS or the professor for questions. I mean, you can study everything, know everything, understand it all, and still get like 1 MC wrong and be 2 points away from the B. Depends what he wants in life and how motivated he is. ECON 10A is a bitch. I just want to get it over with and pass the goddamn class. "
