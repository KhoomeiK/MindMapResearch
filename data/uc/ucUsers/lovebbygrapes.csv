ucr,fpihool,t1_fpigovh,1588641119.0,ugh yea iâ€™m debating not taking fall quarter but i donâ€™t wanna graduate late
ucr,fphw57v,t3_gdjwnt,1588628905.0,seriously itâ€™s so ridiculous that weâ€™re paying so much for some university of phoenix type trash education
ucr,fphlpgs,t1_fphljfp,1588623487.0,nooo i rlly donâ€™t want fall to be entirely online weâ€™re not even receiving uc quality education and yet are paying thousands of dollars
ucr,fphl4e8,t1_fphkzlg,1588623190.0,and yea i agree i was rlly hoping at least labs and discussions would be in person bc other schools r able to have classes hybridly
ucr,fphl2kb,t1_fphkzlg,1588623165.0,iâ€™m just confused is he officially telling us weâ€™re not coming back for fall? or what is going on
ucr,fphku66,t3_gd3xyf,1588623045.0,university crest is pretty cheap if ur willing to share a room! itâ€™s like 400-500 a month but it is unfurnished
ucr,fpa4rxl,t3_gc2ngu,1588440800.0,yay!! congrats and welcome ðŸ¥³
ucr,fow0mj2,t3_g9wddh,1588110839.0,i rlly hope itâ€™s not online but i think itâ€™ll probably be hybrid so smaller discussions and labs will be in person but the larger lectures will probably be online
ucr,fo58jf6,t1_fo57qu3,1587519839.0,i rly feel that :( itâ€™s so hard to even stay motivated with whatever else is going on and bc iâ€™m home my mind kind of thinks iâ€™m still on spring break or summer break :( but dw weâ€™ll get thru this and i hope weâ€™ll be back in fall !!!!
ucr,fo56euy,t1_fo55c1k,1587518512.0,exactly!! my online classes so far have been a mess and iâ€™m rly not able to concentrate well at home at all. i rlly want to be able to at least go back to campus by fall
ucr,fo55707,t1_fo4zh25,1587517750.0,iâ€™m just hoping that they bring back at least labs and discussion sections to be in person so i can at least go back to riverside. i just wanna be on campus at the least
ucr,fo4q415,t1_fo4pkht,1587509053.0,ya same!! i feel like a lot of schools have made decisions already and imo itâ€™s too soon to know what things will be like in september/october.
ucr,fo4pgr2,t1_fo4omp1,1587508702.0,thatâ€™s what iâ€™m hoping for too bc i rlly want to go back to campus :/
ucr,fo42xp3,t3_g5lia7,1587497292.0,yes iâ€™m down!
ucr,fo0h8gi,t1_fo0cyjn,1587413094.0,true! iâ€™m just hoping things will resume in fall as something to look forward to but i donâ€™t wanna get my hopes up :(
ucr,fo0gxb6,t1_fo0g3c4,1587412931.0,yea that would rlly suck esp bc itâ€™s ur first quarter at ucr :/
ucr,fo0gv4n,t1_fo0fxfc,1587412898.0,exactly!! iâ€™m supposed to graduate in 2021 too and if fall is online idk how housing is going to work out bc half my stuff is still in riverside
ucr,fo0cfzd,t1_fo0cdi1,1587410273.0,didnâ€™t the governor say he wanted schools to be open by fall though?
ucr,fnqm2ed,t3_g2w1bh,1587167344.0,hi!!
ucr,fmydrn9,t1_fmy2om8,1586483798.0,we have t done too much so far!! i think u should b able to catch up p easily
friendship,flm42ns,t3_f9alvo,1585274099.0,"i'm kind of in the same boat with my friends rn as i just cut off 2 of my best friends bc it was turning out to be a toxic friendship and while i do have friends they're not as close as i was with my old best friends. the only person i rlly consider is my best friend rn is my bf so i feel what u mean. i'm trying to balance it out by reaching out to ppl im not as close to and try to become close to them bc maybe we could actually become good friends. but i don't think it's a bad thing for u to be best friends w ur bf as long as u give urself time to separate the two if that makes sense? 

would love to chat abt this too bc i wanna talk to someone who's in the same situation as me so feel free to pm :)"
