WouldYouRather,fpknaax,t3_gdu48p,1588697690.0,"I would be the world's best software engineer, powerlifter, basketball player, and pool player. Sounds way more fun than unlimited money with no special talents. With unlimited money you'll also never know if people really like you for you, but this way I'll know I'm a beast for sure."

cscareerquestions,fokqp6q,t1_fokjmno,1587847120.0,"Any tips for pivoting out of defense to more tech-oriented companies as a SWE? I'm going to be interning at a defense company this summer and can see myself returning there full time next year once I graduate (unless I somehow get an offer from a better company). However, I don't want to stay there for very long if I can help it."

UCSD,fny1lmv,t1_fnr48x5,1587351213.0,"Same here, first quarter very tough as the workload was way more than CC. Overall tho seems like a great CS program after a year and a half of being here. Wish I would've looked for internships my first year tho."
UCSD,fny1bd7,t3_g3r34v,1587351025.0,"Definitely not worth, just go to the best school in your state imo...unless you're from Alabama or something"
UCSD,fny199g,t3_g3xpkk,1587350986.0,I felt very run down at the end of last quarter. This quarter is going much better for me so far. I think the main difference is commute time to school and between classes disappearing and less group projects which I'm not a fan of.
UCSD,fny11o5,t3_g42lnc,1587350843.0,"For me personally, the only reason I would skip a quarter is so that I'm eligible for internships next summer. As far as skipping Fall quarter if it's online, I think the saved costs of living with my parents are more important than any social activities that I would've been a part of on campus. The biggest thing I miss about ucsd is playing pool at Shogun )::"

UCSD,fntzppz,t1_fnova5w,1587251698.0,"I used to do this, but recently haven't been able to idk what happened"
UCSD,fnnyy39,t1_fnnyvid,1587106186.0,That would be a nice plan too. Hopefully after this quarter podcasts become mandatory and less profs use in class participation as a part of the overall grade
UCSD,fnnjlkf,t3_g2t2kn,1587093896.0,I hope it's online ðŸ¤ž one less quarter of housing to pay for

UCSD,fma3q3u,t3_ftza7m,1585883058.0,"I love this quarter, I hope they will keep something like this going in the future. Podcasts should be mandatory at the very least and attendance shouldn't be a part of your grade imo"
