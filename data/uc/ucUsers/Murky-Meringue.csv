This sub has made it clear that we're tired of faux action based initiatives that just create more do nothing committees and increase bloat. Here is a list of endorsements for those who have concrete and actionable plans whose effects are real, matter, and can be measured rather than the tired old ""raising awareness"" rhetoric.

In these endorsements, I will rate those running by positions and statements they have made that match the following model: ""Achieved x using y measured by z"". For those unaware, this a common model used by recruiters to rate the effectiveness of an applicant's resume. You must be clear about what you achieved, how you did it, and why you know it mattered.

While bringing back the flyaway bus may not be a high stakes initiative, it is clear about what it does: providing a way for students to get to LAX, how it does it: talking to the UCLA transportation department to fund a new bus, and why it matters: counting the number of people that use the bus.

On the other hand, opening up stipended student seats may sound impressive, but it fails to answer the question of why it matters. What it does: added stipended student seats to the Academic Senate, how does it do it: talked to [whomever you need to talk to], and why it matters: ? Of course people will copy and paste the same ""increasing x"" or ""improving y"" but there are no measurable results here. Same goes for every initiative centered around ""raising awareness.""

I don't have endorsements for every position because there were some that I don't think anyone brought actionable items to the table and somewhere a lot of people did.

President:

Orion Smedley
Orion has proved himself to be Reddit's posterchild when it comes to criticisms of the government's disconnect with the student body. As the leader of the Cost Cutting Innovations slate, his platform has always been oriented towards actionable goals that have real effects. As General Representative 2, he ran on a platform to bring back the flyaway bus and did exactly that. While other officers were adding student seats to councils that no one knows about or spending money on programming no one attends, Orion continued to focus his efforts on issues students face in real life such as the reducing student fees.

In response to a question about accountability, Orion stated that the current student government has put pressure on the CPO office over inadequate reports in the form of withholding stipends. It is not difficult to see him continuing to put this kind of pressure on those who mishandle student fees in his tenure.

Josuel Vasquez
The STV model allows for students to rank multiple choices and for the second spot the endorsement goes to Josuel. He has a very simple platform consisting almost solely of actionable items: refund the the spring quarter fees and give priority enrollment to the most vulnerable in our student body.

IVP:

Brandon Broukhim

Brandon hits the nail on the head for why so many students are disillusioned with student government in a single word. Transparency. Until the recent referendum sparked scrutiny for budgets, many students didn't even know their representatives were earning $10K stipends or that millions had gone missing under their nose. He brings valid criticisms to the government he was a part of and lays a concrete plan to improve accessibility. He talked about getting better equipment and paying out of his own stipend to better engage students in this online era.

Brandon also demonstrated a history of actionable plans as this year's General Representative 3. He made expansions to the food closet, negotiated discounts for students in Westwood stores, and fought to move the drop deadline this quarter.

Facilities Commissioner:

Draco Tong

In the debate, Draco focused his platform on realistic measures he would take to address sustainability issues. He talked about his participation in the sustainability Grand Challenges and how he would use this practical research experience to make UCLA greener. On the other hand, his opponent Sachi fell back onto the old approach of ""making committees"" and ""engaging with administration.""

In the closing statements he brought up the point that so many of us have identified with. He is an Electrical Engineering major trying make practical changes for students and is repeatedly told that he doesn't have the political experience to navigate bureaucracy. He feels that there has not been enough representation of South Campus perspectives which has led to the incessant creation of do nothing committees that only serve to allow friends of officers to pad their resumes.

If you want genuine change like improved elevators and solar power, then go with Draco.

Transf\*r Student Representative:

Deven Streeton

In my opinion, Deven narrowly beats out Zuleika for the Transf\*r Student Representative endorsement. Zuleika is a student that embodies many marginalized communities on campus, e.g. transf\*r, first gen, and parenting, but falls into the the establishment trap of endorsing the creation of ""committees"" and ""spaces"" that don't solve real problems. On the other hand Deven brought a solutions oriented platform to the table, characteristic of the CCI slate. While Zuleika was name dropping dozens of transf\*r related committees, coalitions, and centers, Deven was very clear that the best solution for transf\*rs was to centralize all these different resources."

Just for the record, I'm not advocating for Orion. It looks like it because Orion is the only one advocating for South Campus causes which means I support his platform. However, I would be more than happy to vote for other students advocating for South Campus issues.

From the platforms that most USAC candidates run on to the recently released officer evaluations by the Daily Bruin, it's pretty clear that there's a clear bias towards North Campus oriented agendas. 

As a user pointed out in another post, there's a pretty clear discrepancy in the way the Daily Bruin writes about some platforms. 

Looking at Orion's platform that received a rating of 1

> [The quality of dining hall ingredients, elevator speeds and lightly used shuttle buses weren’t at the front of students’ minds.](https://new.dailybruin.com/post/usac-officer-evaluation-orion-smedley-general-representative-2)

compared to Naomi's platform that received a rating of 5

> [Riley aimed to make decision-makers more accessible to students. Thanks in large part to Riley’s office, student Academic Senate positions are now stipended, which could open up seats at the table to students who couldn’t afford to donate time to academic policy debate without pay. Riley also worked to instate four student appointment positions on the public safety advisory committee following the Getty fire to ensure a student voice at the table in emergencies.](https://new.dailybruin.com/post/usac-officer-evaluation-naomi-riley-academic-affairs-commissioner)

the bias is pretty clear. Thousands of students eat in the dining halls every day. Using better quality ingredients is a sentiment that I bet nobody opposes. On the other hand, I'm graduating this year and I nor any of my friends have ever even heard of the Academic Senate until last quarter when departments were fighting with them over finals and making classes P/NP. 

They even wrote for the special election last year 

> [Smedley’s goals – such as organizing a bus between UCLA and LAX – ***showed him to be out of touch with student needs***, as the lack of student use caused the FlyAway bus to be phased out earlier this year.](https://dailybruin.com/2019/10/27/usac-fall-2019-special-election-no-endorsement-for-orion-smedley-for-general-representative/)

Well surprise surprise, he won. 

This is a part of a larger pattern in UCLA politics. 

South campus majors don't run for office. More importantly they don't vote. So when it comes to it, USAC is filled with the same people who push initiatives that stroke the ""woke"" ego that is so pervasive among the self proclaimed journalists at the Daily Bruin. It's absurd that a candidate can run on a campaign that wants to restore a tangible service to students and gets called out of touch while another candidate is praised for adding seats for students we don't know to a senate we've never heard of.

Right about now is where people jump into the comments saying ""You have no idea what kind of work [literally any committee] does for students."" 

You realize UCLA is throwing you a bone right? They give you a couple bucks out of every student's pockets so you can push those ""woke"" initiatives to pad your resume and play pretend government. But when it comes to important stuff like figuring out how to deal with a wildfire near campus, those ""student voices at the table"" don't count for anything. The folks who run one of the largest public school systems in the world aren't going to rollover because some uppity sophomores started to panic in the face of a real emergency.

Anyway back to the point. 

To USAC

You know why this sub hates USAC? Because for the first time, you have to campaign online. Which means you can't surround yourself with ""woke"" students who were already going to vote for you while being reported on by ""woke"" journalists whose only criticism is how you violated election rules by making a facebook post 20 minutes too early. On this sub, you're dealing with a user base that skews heavily to South Campus and now they're figuring out that none of you actually represent what they want in a candidate.

Rather than push a bunch of platitudinous platforms that call for unquantifiable changes like ""increasing diversity"", ""improving representation"", or ""raising awareness"", do something a large untapped portion of the student population will get behind.

I want better wifi in Boelter. I want the more dining options in the bomb shelter. I want free printing in the Boelter library. I don't want 3 hour labs that start at 6 PM. I want curriculum changes that teach practical skills rather than theoretical ones. Money would be better spent on those things than another initiative advocating for supporting students services with student service support.

To Daily Bruin

Get a better idea of what students want before reporting on what students want. There's such a circlejerk of writers pushing out ""out of touch"" pieces only to be validated by their fellow writers who say it's the student body who has no idea what they're talking about. 

You called Orion's platform out of touch but he won the special election. You said the block party got out of control but students who lived on that street said your report was exaggerated. Imagine how embarrassing it's going to be when you called Orion out of touch again and he ends up winning. Some of you need to reflect on why you deny the experience of South Campus majors. I know I'm not alone in saying that the Daily Bruin has lost a lot of credibility to me in the past year alone.

To South Campus majors

Vote. Stop USAC candidates from carrying out bullshit agendas that don't meet your needs. This happens because we're apathetic and the 15% of voters coming from North Campus get to dictate which student issues get attention.

Better yet run for office. Make the changes you want to see and cash in on that $10K stipend while you're at it.

Edit:

I'm graduating so I won't be around but someone needs to run on this platform next year.

* Better wifi in Boelter

* More free printing locations on campus especially in South Campus

* Pay for research assistants

* More practical coursework

* More dining options in South Campus

Feel free to comment more South Campus issues that need to be addressed."
