Are you thinking of dying the bleached part a color or just keeping it that way?"

UCI,fouohwc,t1_founiz6,1588087745.0,"They arenâ€™t crowded BECAUSE of social distancing. In places like NY, where no precautions were taken, hospitals are absolutely overwhelmed. 

And even if corona isnâ€™t the direct cause of death for people, it most definitely lead to it."
UCI,foumba7,t1_fouecuq,1588086651.0,"But by going outside, people arenâ€™t just getting antibodies. Theyâ€™re getting sick and taking up space in already crowded hospitals. Plus, not everyone is building immunity to the virus; people are dying. Healthcare is overwhelmed right now. Thereâ€™s a reason why we were asked to stay inside."
Gamingcirclejerk,fotgz1k,t3_g96efl,1588053636.0,"I really hope the game doesnâ€™t diminish the dystopia aspect of cyberpunk. Iâ€™m looking forward to the game because I love all things cyberpunk, but I really donâ€™t want to get my hopes up."

UCI,fosaawy,t1_fos2wtv,1588026838.0,"Sorry, I should have made it more clear. I have no problem with people going outside, but made this post to rant about people who go outside without following social distancing. There are many people who are going outside and keeping their space, but there are also many people who arenâ€™t."

UCI,fo8t7bz,t3_g64976,1587603338.0,"Everything is scary right now. I hate being at home with my family because my siblings and mom always fight with each other and/or me. Going on the internet is scary because I donâ€™t want to be ignorant of the current issues but the news is scary. Politics is scary. I keep feeling a sense of impending doom, and itâ€™s really weird because while the apocalypse is happening, Iâ€™m just being a student. Iâ€™m stressed about my job as a student researcher because there isnâ€™t much I can do without accessing the lab. Iâ€™m in the area, but the lab is restricted right now. Iâ€™m stressed about my internship this summer because I donâ€™t want it to be remote, but Iâ€™m trying to stay positive because at least Iâ€™ll still have something to do. 

The days are blurring together and I canâ€™t stop eating. I want things to be normal again, but at the same time, Iâ€™m not sure if I will be able to readjust. And on top of that, I think there is going to be a new normal. Nothing will ever be the same again, at least not for a while. 

I just want to hide under all my blankets and sleep until this is all over."

Gamingcirclejerk,fo3ryvo,t1_fo333yu,1587491970.0,"Same here, and I want to see more of Ciriâ€™s story as well. Geralt really isnâ€™t the most interesting character and I hate being restricted to his life."

curlyhair,fmtpzpd,t3_fxdhqt,1586376999.0,"Routineâœ¨
My routine is very much NOT completely curly girl. My scalp gets very oily really fast, and CG just wasnâ€™t working out for me. 

Wash hair with Kiehlâ€™s Amino Acid Shampoo and condition with Suave Essentials Tropical Coconut. I wash my hair almost every day; I only skip if Iâ€™m tired or really lazy. 

While conditioner is in my hair, I will detangle with my fingers and then clip it up/tie it up with a scrunchie I am willing to sacrifice to the water (I broke my hair clip) for the remainder of the shower. I do this so that I can wash all the conditioner out at the end of the shower and also scrub the back of my neck without getting too much soap in my hair.  

At the end of my shower, I rinse out the conditioner, again running my fingers through to take out more tangles. I do not rinse out all the conditioner; I leave enough to give the hair slip. 

After the shower, I add some apricot and almond oil to my hair. Right now Iâ€™m just using what I have lying around, which happens to be the Forget Me Not Multi-use Oil. I only really like it because it has flowers in it and it looks witchy ðŸ˜…

Then, this is where the fun begins. I use the 5-row Denman Brush (D-33). It is very small and probably more suited for children or traveling. I got it because I wanted a Denman and it was the cheapest one lol. I brush in sections, going from underneath the hair and curling it towards the end. And then, I curl the hair around the brush, like [this.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-DGwSCpk6Y/?igshid=1ehu11t8ef35h) Afterwards, I lightly scrunch the ringlets. 

I wait for my hair to air dry; I take night showers, so Iâ€™ll just do homework, study, videogames, etc. until itâ€™s completely dry. I am thinking about investing in a diffuser some time in the future. Before bed, I pineapple my hair, pinning lose sections to the back of my head, go to sleep, wake up, shake my hair out, and Iâ€™m good to go. 

Tips and product suggestions very welcome; I am very low maintenance and like to keep things simple."
