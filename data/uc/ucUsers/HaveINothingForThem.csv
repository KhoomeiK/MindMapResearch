UCDavis,fplj6hv,t3_gdbcp0,1588713663.0,"Keep in mind that Davis is a very different environment from UCLA and Berkeley (small town rather than a larger city, not near the ocean, smaller international student body, harder to leave without a car, etc). Myself and lots of other people love it here, but make sure to do your research in selecting a campus!"
UCDavis,fplinbi,t3_ge1vzx,1588713390.0,"No one can say for sure, but I'd guess your chances will be better this year than most; pretty large enrollment drops are likely at most universities this year, especially if fall quarter ends up online."
UCDavis,fp5h6x8,t1_fp5gjc0,1588329255.0,"That's true - that's a survey of individuals, not institutions, though, and QS does have more responses - 94,000 academics (including 7,700 from the US) and 45,000 employers versus less than 5,000 academics and no employers for US News. Even though US News clearly is dominant in the US, I don't think they're as well-positioned to collect data from individual academics since they're more of a magazine business than an educational data business, and because their reputation in higher ed circles is very negative."
UCDavis,fp5gc70,t1_fp5cyb0,1588328351.0,"It's one of the best-known university rankings websites worldwide; I used it a fair bit when researching colleges. All rankings are less related actual educational quality/outcomes than one might expect, but US News in particular uses a lot of absurd metrics to calculate their rankings that I would argue have nothing to do with quality of instruction: alumni giving rates (even when total 
spending is already considered), high school SAT averages, etc. They also like to change things up every year to keep the rankings more volatile, and therefore generate more news/traffic.
Some other ranking sites use a much smaller set of data, so they don't need to send our surveys directly to colleges since the more important stuff is usually publicly available anyway.

If you're interested, most ranking sites publish their formulas:

https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings

https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-world-university-rankings/methodology

I don't think there's much reason, other than the formulas used, to rely on one ranking over another - the paradox of college rankings is that even though they're treated as markers as prestige, no one who isn't a student or administrator involved with undergraduate education really cares about them."
UCDavis,fp51jb2,t3_gbc1vc,1588313362.0,"> However, after talking to many people I get the impression that UCI is much better reputed than UC Davis but I don’t know if that’s true.

That's not something I've heard before - my guess would be that you're hearing that because you live in the Irvine area, so everyone is familiar with UCI and knows it's a good school but might not know as much about Davis.

If your family is concerned, you could point out that any ""rankings"" websites will put Davis at a similar or higher level than Irvine, especially for some of the fields you're looking at (for example, [QS](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings) puts Davis at #104 and Irvine at #219 overall, and Davis at #42 in biological sciences while Irvine is at #101-150). I wouldn't recommend putting much stock in these websites yourself though, as they're not going to tell you much about your future earnings or college experience.

Setting that aside, I know Davis has very strong programs in bio, pharm chem, nutrition, and psychology (I'm not sure about public health). But especially since you're still undecided on your major, I would recommend focusing more on where you want to live for the next four years - if you haven't been to Davis, definitely do a little research into the town online."
UCDavis,fp4frlm,t1_fp47nl3,1588298094.0,"It's not just vaccination research that's done at the primate center - for example, I recently saw a presentation from a psychologist who did research that involved putting primates in stressful situations and observing their responses."
UCDavis,fp07heu,t1_fp03gh5,1588203922.0,Do the grants last 4 years or 12 quarters? You might be able to graduate in fall rather than spring and still be covered if you pelp a quarter.
UCDavis,fozpgca,t1_foxjt7f,1588194576.0,"Priority registration means they'll be able to waitlist first though, and CS classes usually have pretty high drop rates"

UCDavis,foxziav,t3_ga46ga,1588161328.0,"Check with an advisor, but I'd imagine it'd be similar to getting an NP in any other class. NP doesn't affect your GPA but can hurt minimum progress and things like that - but if you weren't getting credit anyway that's probably not a concern. A P would of course look better on your transcript."
UCDavis,foxjh0y,t3_ga4qnu,1588145920.0,"From https://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/undergrad-program/advising/ugrad-faq:

> **What do I need to declare a major in Economics?**
>
> You will need to be in good academic standing as well as have an overall GPA of 2.0 and an upper division GPA of 2.0 (if applicable) for the major.

If you aren't yet a student, you'll need to wait one quarter before you switch so that you can get a GPA; however, you don't need to take classes toward your old major during that time period and can start taking econ classes right away."
UCDavis,fosnpy1,t3_g9b34y,1588034343.0,Totally depends on the department and instructor; I'd say around half of my classes curved or adjusted the typical scale in some way. I've never had an instructor adjust grades downward though.

UCDavis,forp8qc,t3_g979ik,1588016094.0,"100% depends on the class; this quarter many classes don't require synchronous attendance but some do. I would guess that summer might have more classes that require attendance since professors might view summer enrollment as more optional, but I don't know. Keep in mind that even if your class doesn't have synchronous lectures it could also have weekly quizzes or something like that only available during class time, although I haven't come across that this quarter.

I'd definitely recommend emailing the professor before enrolling to ask whether, and to what extent, their class will be synchronous. And even if the timing works out, don't take more classes than you'd normally be able to handle with that amount of work - most online classes this quarter were not easier than in-person ones, at least in my experience."
UCDavis,folyamz,t3_g876uf,1587873423.0,"Unless you're getting housing through the university, or think you'll be moving regardless of the situation next quarter, I'd consider holding off on signing a lease as long as you can."
UCDavis,foly1yz,t1_foh3n61,1587873251.0,"Looks like this account basically just goes around posting anti-Chinese stuff in various subreddits. Weird - I'm curious whether it's just an extreme xenophobic fixation or if someone's for some reason paying.

In case anyone was wondering, I looked into these statistics and they're almost all incorrect. There were at least 400 (probably more like 800) Chinese international students in 2009, and now the total is just over 4,000, which includes graduate students. And while the number of international students has gone up, the number of California students has not decreased by much (because enrollment is growing overall), so it doesn't make sense to blame lower sports turnout on internationals.

UCDavis,folwyjk,t3_g84eqv,1587872482.0,"Definitely communicate with your supervisor asking what their plans are if the crisis continues through summer. Even if it hasn't been decided yet, I'd guess it's more likely or not that the internship will be cancelled or you'll be asked to work remotely, so I wouldn't worry too much at this point. If they tell you they're still deciding, I would just wait it out, especially if the program is going to try to charge you a fee for quitting (which seems bizarre and maybe illegal under any circumstances)."
UCDavis,fojwcjz,t3_g7jjla,1587830734.0,"There are 10,000 students in student housing, and I would imagine the average refund for moving out would be between $3,000 and $6,000, so that alone would account for half or more of the expenses."
UCDavis,fo5tdd2,t3_g5jues,1587535073.0,"L&S undergrads are definitely able to take grad courses. But I don't think the other answers are correct. You can take graduate courses for a letter grade, and you don't need to fill out any forms unless you're trying to apply the course toward graduation requirements.

The best way to get into a graduate-level course is to reach out to the professor explaining your interest and ask if it's possible for you to join; they can usually then get you a PTA from the department if necessary. There's even a special advisory on graduate-level math course listings on schedule builder:

> ** UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS OBTAIN CONSENT OF INSTRUCTOR **

That said, it may be a good idea to talk with an advisor before deciding to reach out to a professor, especially if your primary motivation here is to improve your grad school application. I'm not a math major, but I would be very surprised if grad schools expect students to come in with graduate classes - some of the best undergraduate institutions in the country don't even offer graduate-level instruction, and from what I've seen Davis has pretty robust upper-division offerings."
UCDavis,fn8rjt5,t1_fn8ni08,1586748401.0,"UHP dropout here - if you already have Regents there aren't really any consequences to dropping out (other than not being able to take UHP classes anymore).

The course requirement probably won't add to your workload - honors classes are usually just smaller versions of normal university courses, so they can count toward major and GE requirements that you'd have to fulfill anyway.

I'd definitely recommend giving the program a try. The honors dorm was great; I also got started with research a lot earlier than I otherwise would have because of opportunities that came out of UHP."
UCDavis,fn53wye,t3_fzndd2,1586655327.0,"Since it has a unix shell I think a Mac might be good enough for most things as long as you're okay with remotely accessing the Ubuntu machines at school (which you'll want to do regardless since those are probably the computers your programs will be tested on).
