They did say that after March 25th, they were going to spend the next few weeks readjusting peopleâ€™s aid and issuing out refunds. I barely got my refund on Monday and not too long after, the charges were updated on my account. It showed my actual charges as well as what I got refunded for (I.e. housing). At this point, all you can really do is wait. Hope you get refunded soon!"
