wallstreetbets,fpiq6ss,t3_gdn1ge,1588646273.0,The best time to sell was when Elon tanked his own stock. The second best time to sell is probably right the fuck now.
wallstreetbets,fph2cga,t1_fpgsiin,1588613730.0,"Appreciate the honesty here as well. Going be real with you though betting on Tesla is basically just gambling. It’s a meme stock which people will pump for no other reason than to be a part of the trend, it is ridiculously overvalued and certainly should be lower, but you can’t fight against the meme “it has to come crashing down at some point” isn’t a good reason to buy puts, it can seriously run off of meme for years.

DD: I was about to buy TSLA dip from musk tweet."

thetagang,foc9yqo,t3_g675of,1587668842.0,"Not a glitch, but an outcome of the way robinhood shows prices. 
If there’s no bid robinhood places the bid ask price at 0.01 since the contract is essentially worthless on the market if no one is buying it. This happens on a lot of low volume options stocks. Anyways the second a bid is put in the. the price will go to a more reasonable value of the between of the bid ask spread. So if it goes from a value of 0.01 to 1.01 thats an increase of 10,000% that you’re seeing. Don’t be mistaken though, no one was buying or selling at 0.01 that’s simply the price robinhood puts when there’s no bid."
