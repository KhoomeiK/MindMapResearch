history,fokwtsu,t1_fokcyuh,1587850457.0,"It's a concept called [syncretism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_syncretism). For example, once the Greeks began regular trade with the Egyptians, they noticed similarities with Zeus and Ammon, leading to worship of a new god, [Zeus-Ammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun#Greece).

Other times, foreign gods would be adopted into the local pantheon, like [the cult of Isis in Rome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis#In_the_Greco-Roman_world)"

CFB,fn5ux82,t3_fzmth9,1586676764.0,"People really only sing like four words of the National anthem. To start off, we yell “UC” in “oh say can you see”, then we yell “BLUE” over “red” in the “rockets red glare”, then everyone yells “GOLD” during “Star-spangled”, and finally it’s the home of the “BEARS”

CFB,fn0yvbu,t1_fn0ov9k,1586551439.0,Statistics have them about equal. Milner is a dual-threat guy though compared to Brasch.

CFB,fmxs5g0,t1_fmxrp1z,1586470816.0,Yep. But I'd be happy if they pulled Moss too
CFB,fmxry82,t3_fy1ryf,1586470706.0,"Some facts:

- Former OC Beau Baldwin's top QB target was [Miller Moss](https://247sports.com/player/miller-moss-46051144/). When Bill Musgrave came in, however, it seems priorities shifted, because Millner has been receiving all the love for the past few months.
- Back-to-back QBs from Higley HS now play for Cal (Spencer Brasch just finished his freshman season)."
berkeley,fmggn6p,t3_fv326r,1586048615.0,"Your brother would have to get in contact with the coaching staff. He'd have to send highlight videos of himself playing (around 3-4 minutes long, making sure to circle yourself playing) and have good measurables (height/weight). You can find Coach Fox on Twitter @coachmarkfox. 

Most players won't send highlight reels to just one school but to dozens and dozens, hoping for just one scholarship.

But if you get a scholarship, it covers all 4 (+1) years, housing, food, and tuition. It's a long process that changes your personality, but if it's the dream, it's worth it when it pays off."
