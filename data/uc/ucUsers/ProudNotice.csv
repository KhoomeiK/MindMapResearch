1. what's the most challenging part of keeping myself motivated?
2. think about a few actual examples that make you lose motivation. Be more specific, so you can analyze why
3. when you figure out what are the major factor contributing to this. Ask yourself why this is hard to overcome?
4. what have you tried to overcome it and keep yourself motivated

Hope theses tips will help and maybe sharing you problems with other could also help :)

I also think other alternative like creating cohort and commit study with a few friend to keep the momentum going."

UCSD,fma5bjr,t3_ftza7m,1585884210.0,"I finished my last quarter here with two heavy workload cs classes while working full time as a SWE in the Bay Area. Didn't feel much difference other than the getting less support from the courses staffs and lack of social life with students on campus. 

I think online learning is the future but then again the school is basically a social club + the learning part. Would you mind sharing anything else you have been missing from not being able to go on campus physically? Or anything other problem you have for this situation?"
