It’s pretty much the same as any other university, if not tamer than a lot of them due to the lack of Greek life and general vibe and setting of the campus and town. Nobody is going to pressure you into doing any drugs you don’t want to, especially hard drugs. They’re expensive."

IdiotsInCars,foti6yg,t1_fothec2,1588054691.0,"Geez, that is discouraging. I've called in a ""drunk"" driver twice, both times to 911. Both times they took the vehicle's license plate, make/model, and then my name and number too. They also asked if I was still behind them. One time the vehicle had already sped away, and the other time I was on the phone with 911 as the vehicle swerved across 4 lanes and crashed into a semi trailer that was parked on the shoulder, going about 80mph. Scary stuff, after seeing that I am definitely going to keep calling in to 911 when I see someone driving like that, just so they can understand that it *is* urgent, and that way paramedics/police can be on their way should something happen.

&#x200B;

This was in California, just for reference."
IdiotsInCars,fotbqfn,t1_fot9mmf,1588049453.0,"I think people are nervous about calling 911 unless they're positive that it's an emergency, and someone driving poorly is a situation most people can remove themselves from relatively easily so they just do that instead. The signs that sometimes say ""Call 911 to report drunk drivers"" or something similar could be changed to something more broad like ""call 911 to report dangerous drivers"", but I assume the thinking is that this could lead to people calling for things that don't warrant it, like getting frustrated at people for forgetting a blinker one time, not letting them in, etc.. 

&#x200B;

Interesting to think about how this could be improved though, because I definitely think that people shouldn't hesitate to report when someone is driving as dangerously as the person in this video."

UCSC,fntyduc,t1_fntwqo3,1587250969.0,"From the article: 

""When schools applied for funds, they were informed that they had a year to distribute the student grants. Davis says Purdue may make grants over time. “There’s an expectation that this emergency isn’t over tomorrow,” she says. “It’s going to continue for a while.”

Forbes checked with a dozen of the institutions slated to receive the largest emergency grants, including Arizona State University, Brigham Young University and Penn State. Aside from USC, those that responded were still trying to come up with a system for distributing the money. “We have teams of people working on this issue from all across the university,” said an ASU spokesman in an email."""

If they refuse to pay, it’s up to the landlord to work out with them. You most likely don’t have any obligation to pay the landlord the other roommate’s share"
