mtgfinance,fpfhzu5,t3_gd5a1j,1588571824.0,Is this a box worth buying at opening on it's date of physical release (5/15)? I want to open a box but I also want to know that it'll be worth the money. I'm not trying to profit. I just like getting value for my bucks.
Unemployment,fpd0aon,t3_gcrnjf,1588517048.0,I think you'll need the card to create or access your account. You can call boa and tell them that you need your card expedited because your bills are piling up
Unemployment,fpd03c1,t3_gcqee3,1588516915.0,"I spam checked my account a lot and noticed they shipped it way before payments were made on the card (according to the website). Once I was able to confirm it shipped, I called BOA and told them that I would need the card expedited since I have bills to pay and so they did. Now its coming in 2-3 days instead of 10. Applied on 4/28 certified on 4/30"
Unemployment,fp8c2hi,t1_fp8byco,1588388592.0,I'm using a completely different email. I don't know the email that was used bc my aunt is not tech savvy so the person who did it for her used their own email.
Unemployment,fp79jqj,t1_fp79ett,1588366502.0,I was able to certify for 6 weeks of back pay and had a claim balance so I assume I was approved
UCDavis,fp40mm0,t3_gb3me0,1588289360.0,"Hey, I can definitely relate to your situation. I'm not the oldest but the only one living with my immigrant parents who don't speak English. When I can't do something for them or I'm not successful in doing something, they don't understand that I couldn't do it. All they can see is that I didnt do it even though I should be able to. It's frustrating. I filed for unemployment for my mom and fortunately for us it worked out. Have you tried applying for PUA? If your parents arent qualified for normal UI I would definitely go that route. I didnt qualify for normal UI and applied for PUA and just got approved. If you have any questions feel free to ask at anytime. Hope this helps and hope your situation gets better:)"

Unemployment,foimr3j,t1_foimfvt,1587790694.0,"Wow that absolutely sucks...so even though I have a job and go to school, I'm completely out of luck in this situation? How does this make sense if some students still need to pay rent, bill, food, supplies, TUITION, etc??"
Unemployment,foimb09,t1_foim467,1587790337.0,"I do have work study but it wasn't requested for this job if that matters. Not being eligible for UI because of work study doesnt make sense. I'm on work study because I am low income so if I dont have work how else do I support myself through rent, food, school supplies, bills, etc?"
UCDavis,foi4ag9,t3_g7hepn,1587778414.0,I think megathreads about a lot of things for this sub would be nice or a pinned general information post. I just feel like there are no mods for this sub. I personally have not seen any form of modding in this sub ever
UCDavis,foi41hc,t1_foexcyo,1587778272.0,My roommates like to complain about how UC Davis doesn't care about the students but I came to realize that its every university. You just hear it more when you're at the school. And people just like to complain sometimes. You cant please everybody.
Unemployment,foerjtx,t1_foerg0m,1587712331.0,"I did not go through the calculator because I didnt have records of my paychecks to input. But I figured I might as well apply and worst case, they deny but I apply for PUA later on"
Unemployment,foer990,t1_foer7wu,1587712050.0,You too!
Unemployment,foer627,t1_foer443,1587711966.0,Nope. It's like unemployment. You still get the extra $600 on top and its backdated so you can get paid starting all the back from february
Unemployment,foeqzie,t1_foeqxdo,1587711798.0,"Pandemic(?) Unemployment Assistance. Basically for people who don't qualify for UI. Independent contractors, self employed, people in situations like me."

Unemployment,foeqkeg,t1_foeqidh,1587711412.0,"About $900. I think that's too low anyways. I wasnt fired, I'm just unable to work since my campus shut down entirely"
Unemployment,foeq71z,t1_foeq4kw,1587711071.0,Oh ok thanks. I had a job in 2019 from January - May. Does that make a difference?
Unemployment,foepu0h,t1_foeprvl,1587710744.0,"No, it didnt really give a reason. It just states my earnings from my job and last jobs then says I qualify for $0 in benefits"
Unemployment,foeppuo,t3_g725re,1587710640.0,Hey! I have a job at UCD too and make a similar amount bi weekly but I just got the letter saying I qualify for $0.00 in benefits. If you get something different could you let me know? Thanks!

Unemployment,fnyi6uz,t1_fnyi3tz,1587363852.0,"Oh good point, I did not think of that thanks. I tried calling edd but couldnt get through to an actual person. I know there a lot of people calling, probably with more pressing matters so I didn't bother trying again."
Unemployment,fnyhvmr,t1_fnyhtvi,1587363577.0,I applied online. Literally have not gotten any emails outside of the confirmation that my account was made

UCDavis,fnunr3h,t1_fnumj0h,1587266526.0,I never said that the full 33.8mil would go to students. And I also specified that the schools dont know how to use it yet
UCDavis,fnu2nic,t3_g3xe0x,1587253362.0,"Article from another source that seems to have a little more info: https://www.chronicle.com/article/Colleges-Are-Handing-Out/248544

Edit: according to this article https://edsource.org/2020/california-colleges-universities-share-in-1-7-billion-in-emergency-stimulus-funds/628763, it seems that each student can get about $887 if UCD decides to distribute it to everyone equally"
UCDavis,fnr8c3n,t3_g3dsol,1587181807.0,"I applied for unemployment and wasnt given any weeks to certify because I think you have to make a certain amount to qualify for unemployment. I'm not completely sure but that's the only reason I'm finding plausible. But in a few weeks, PUA will be released and if you dont qualify for UI benefits, you can apply for PUA. It will also be backdated so you can be paid for as early as february once you file for it"
