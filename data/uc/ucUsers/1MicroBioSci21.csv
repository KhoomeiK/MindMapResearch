As I was doing so the tail detached from the body and it ran away, but I noticed very little blood actually came out of the tail. It was a freaky moment, but cool nonetheless. Be kind to your neighborhood lizards."

biology,fp4ooa3,t3_gb90wn,1588303702.0,Creo que sería posible modificar el gen de p53 con CRISPR/Cas9 en las células germinales o en el cigoto si viéramos algún problema con su secuencia. Pero para cambiar el gen de p53 en un adulto es un poquito más complicado. Pero en el futuro pienso que esto o algúna forma alternativa de esta idea será implementado. Lo digo por todas las investigaciones actuales en el arreglo de los genes con CRISPR. ¡Gracias por su pregunta!
UCSD,fp4dc6a,t3_gb1k3d,1588296630.0,It looks like there will be a second in-person one too at a later date. Class of 2020 is pretty lucky to get two commencement ceremonies

biology,fp16dq7,t3_gap4ij,1588225678.0,"Sample stuff you’ll think you enjoy, and if you decide that it’s for you, stick with it. I find biology to be such an enriching field with many areas to specialize in and learn new things. That’s what biology really is too - it’s learning about nature and how life is able to exist and change. If you find that your curiosity drives your interest in this subject, then by all means give it a try! Don’t be afraid to be wrong or to know less, because as scientists, we’re all looking to learn more together."
UCSD,fp0g1sv,t1_fp0fpz9,1588208553.0,"All good! Well then hopefully you can get into those classes when your registration time comes up. Since you’re a freshman, it’s useful to have several backup plans in case a class you want gets full before you can enroll."
UCSD,fp0fjr6,t3_galfvc,1588208282.0,Maybe consider taking Math 11 your freshman year to get all your math out of the way? It’s a required course for majors in the bio department and I don’t think AP Stats places you out of it.
UCSD,foxh53v,t3_g9zmsb,1588143838.0,"Yeah it’s basically a ghost town. I actually feel like I’ve just witnessed a rare event (something like a total solar eclipse) whenever I see another student.

UCSD,fotdrqp,t3_g9b08y,1588051029.0,Fellow transfer here! I remember reading somewhere that you can extend your time here beyond 6 quarters if you get approval from your college and major department. I’d assume the first step to doing this is to form a plan with an advisor where you plan out the rest of your coursework and then just submit that plan for approval to your college and major department.

UCSD,foogncb,t3_g8jy76,1587938611.0,"Good on you for planning things so early! I think your commitment to your education really shines thru here!

I do believe in your case taking the physics series alongside general chemistry is a good idea. You’ll get it out of the way for one thing, but also the Physics 1 series will mention applications of physics in biology which I think will give you a greater appreciation for the way things like gel electrophoresis and radiation therapy work when you learn more about them in upper-division classes.

Good luck with everything!"

UCSD,fo29l0x,t1_fo296ke,1587454215.0,"The only other thing I can think of is the DEI requirement. This will require a little under a half hour of hw on your part, but UCSD has this requirement that all undergraduates must take before they graduate. There’s a list on their website if you google “UCSD DEI courses” of all the classes that satisfy this requirement. You can use Assist to find one that articulates with a class at your community college and try to take it there."
UCSD,fo28xjd,t1_fo28az6,1587453570.0,"I would focus on getting your IGETC done because that makes life MUCH easier upon transferring anywhere, not just UCSD. 

Take the OChem series at community so that you aren’t prevented from enrolling in certain upper-division biochemistry courses when you transfer. 

Physics can wait until after you transfer, but like everything else, it’s probably better to finish it at a CCC. Just don’t feel stressed out if you can’t fit it into your schedule. 

Make sure you’re solid on topics in your introductory bio classes. I actually transferred here knowing more than some of my classmates, so that made the first quarter (and making some friends) really easy haha"
UCSD,fo28l4m,t3_g54cwj,1587453236.0,"Huffaker was really caring and thorough for BIBC 100. Would definitely recommend, since the class goes over a lot of things I feel are important to understand biology at a molecular level."

UCSD,fnzm2w9,t3_g4nm3l,1587396655.0,See if you can take a Stats at your CC that articulated with MATH 11 here (check Assist)! It will be very convenient to not have to take any more math once you transfer

biology,fnv3nvh,t3_g42rav,1587279165.0,"So the cell membrane exists as a “fluid mosaic” which just means that phospholipids and proteins are allowed to move freely in the membrane.

Fluidity is regulated in several ways, but primarily by temperature, lipid type, and the presence of cholesterol. 
High temperature makes the lipids move faster -> high fluidity. Low temperature slows the movement of molecules -> low fluidity.
Saturated phospholipids with long fatty acid tails decrease fluidity. Unsaturated phospholipids make “kinks” in their structure (sort of like bends in the fatty acid tails), and with short tails increase fluidity.
Cholesterol is a little weird in how it works. Generally it serves to maintain fluidity of the membrane, especially in low temperatures."

UCSD,fnp28j1,t1_fno3bsd,1587137961.0,"This is not necessarily how it would come about. If a handful of students were to attend lecture in-person, all the professor would need to do is podcast the lecture like before COVID-19 and make that available to all the students, whether they be on campus or not. No Zoom lectures would be required in this instance. 

Also, all assignments and exams could be delivered asynchronously thru Canvas. Office hours could be in-person as well as online, most likely at the same time. Id imagine discussion sections would exclusively meet online so that there’s not a group of students in-class and a group on the computer screen."
UCSD,fnp1jz7,t3_g2zeha,1587137612.0,"I think for pre-meds, BIBC 102 is more useful because from what I hear, it goes in depth on many metabolic pathways that occur in humans and covers a lot of material that you’ll find on the MCAT. From a biological point of view, I can’t emphasize the importance of BIBC 100 enough because it explains why many molecules and enzymes react the way they do by looking at the functional groups present and the chemistry going on between those groups. 

I suppose for those looking to be in the medical field, BIBC 102 edges out 100 in importance though."

As it’s been said multiple times, it’s a very gray area in biology.

Based on the definition of “robot” you gave, the comparison seems acceptable at a very basic level. But keep in mind that viruses are able to evolve in response to the pressures of natural selection, whereas I’m doubtful a robot can do that. I doubt that I am qualified to provide an analogy for you since I have very little knowledge of computer science, but the best thing I can think of this: a virus can be thought of as a piece of code, which when run is capable of reproducing itself."

Not an expert on love (in the biological sense or the social sense) but from my background, I can guess that love may just be the culmination of multiple biochemical signals individually associated with other feelings/emotions. In this sense, love still exists, there may just be no “love” molecule that gets released when one is “in love”.

Whether you choose to agree with it or not, humans have collectively decided that whatever we experience in the presence of these chemical signals is “love”."
biology,fn6ziuh,t1_fn6voyw,1586710385.0,"You might have just defined love in the context of other emotions here, and therefore validated that it does, in fact, exist.

Studying it in high school, it may seem obvious what path organisms will take over the course of history, but that is the illusion created by the fact that those traits have already evolved, and were therefore already studied and taken into account by scientists. That’s why you can see it laid out before you in textbooks. As others have mentioned, evolution is not a directional process.
