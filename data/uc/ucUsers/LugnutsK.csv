* Yes, any further reductions would compromise the team.

openttd,fo5wdyy,t1_fo5unyn,1587537879.0,"1) Not really, that's pretty much how I would do it.

2) I'm guessing that the reverser looks like a dead end also, so I think if you add [""spurs/arrows""](https://wiki.openttdcoop.org/images/9/91/Overflow_primary.png) to the end of the reverser it will fix it. Trains will prioritize that since there are multiple choices (even if they are pointless choices). But whatever works.

3) If you use PBS you can have two reversers perpendicular to the exit line, shaped like a X, that get used simultaneously. Note PBS reversers don't need spurs/arrows. This would help improve throughput for high-production pickups. For other pickups the lower capacity reversers could be better to lower the flow of trains (if you don't have full-load dummy trains of course).

3) You could also use pathfinder penalties (i.e. a bunch of backwards two-way PBS) rather than a full-on reverser, and I think it should work but could be a bit more fragile as your network grows."

(2) Then change your pickup stations to hide the through route from the pathfinder, either by using terminus stations or by putting reversers on the exit.

Doing these two things will (1) pull trains towards a correct pickup station, and (2) block trains from going to a wrong pickup station, for their cargo type.
