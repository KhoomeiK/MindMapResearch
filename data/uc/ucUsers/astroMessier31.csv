ucla,fpiydrv,t3_g6c2ov,1588651698.0,"Hello!!! I was wondering if anyone on here had any experience with transferring from a UC to UC. I've been a UCI for a year and I'm realized that I am not comfortable here nor do I have the same major/career opportunities as I would at another UC. Luckily, I am finishing my GEs over the summer which allows me to consider transferring. I was wondering if someone could give me the realistic chances of transferring or speak about how the process was like? 

Also, congrats to everyone here!!!!"
