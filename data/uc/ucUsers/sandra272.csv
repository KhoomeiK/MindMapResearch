Also, I wouldn’t consider finding roommates a reason to stay at Davis because with covid it is unlikely anyone will be able to live on campus anyways, especially with roommates"
ApplyingToCollege,fpasqty,t3_gcb0c7,1588454935.0,UCSB! it’s a top 10 public university and the social life and parties are amazing

UCSantaBarbara,fow89ni,t3_g9xia3,1588114847.0,does anyone know what they would even do at orientation?
ApplyingToCollege,fopzkqv,t3_g8tcei,1587977567.0,"Honestly if the price of USC isn’t a problem, I would do the TTP given our circumstances right now. Most of next year will probably be online learning so it won’t matter if you go to community college for a year then transfer to USC, because everyone will have to be at home anyways so you won’t even notice the difference."
ApplyingToCollege,fmyz8cw,t3_fm97s7,1586500572.0,I would go with SDSU because it’s ranked way higher
