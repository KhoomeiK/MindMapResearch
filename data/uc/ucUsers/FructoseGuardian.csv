UCSD,foi72ru,t1_foi66mf,1587780076.0,"I think starting winter of this year, DSC 10 is no longer major restricted and dsc majors do not have priority, so everyone has an equal chance of getting in. [source](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-information/enrolling-in-classes/)"
UCSD,foi6q7m,t3_g7l5pw,1587779865.0,"There's usually a ton of sections for MATH 18 and MATH 20B but the sections with the good lecturers usually fill up fast. If you don't have a specific preference for who's teaching then you should be able to get in with no problems at all. Not to mention, I'm pretty sure they save a significant chunk of these seats for freshman only in the fall. I think the hardest class to get in your case would be DSC 10."

UCSD,fo8sm84,t1_fo8pgs1,1587602988.0,I'm pretty sure Marina is
UCSD,fo8si3a,t3_g68eto,1587602919.0,"Tbh, it was a similar workload when I took the class in the fall. But I can understand why students would want the professors to cut some slack since it may be stressful during these unprecedented times."

UCSD,fnu9r6k,t3_g3ygxw,1587257472.0,"If you're a data science major then definitely do the 20 series (iirc it's required to do the 20 series for dsc majors). Also 20A isn't that much harder than AP Calc AB. It's pretty much the same material. As long as you understand most of what you are learning in AP Calc AB right now, you should be fine."
UCSD,fnmdmry,t3_g1xpc8,1587069537.0,"I took COGS 107A with Boyle last summer and it was honestly sooo much work. There were lab worksheets, reading quizzes, and midterms every week. Not to mention full lab reports due every other week. It was also really hard to learn the material because there was just so much of it with so little time."
UCSD,fneynjk,t3_g0ddl3,1586898257.0,I've seen the head TA for one of my classes at a huge house party once. My friend said hi and he just kindly waved back.
UCSD,fhw5r6r,t3_f4o02t,1581907063.0,"DSC 80 was a lot of work. Content wise, I think it's easier but it's definitely the same or more time commitment as 30. Expect to do 3 assignments a week. I took 80 with Frankael last quarter and there were weekly labs, biweekly projects (weekly checkpoints), and weekly discussion labs. I wouldn't expect it to be much different for next quarter because I think the curriculum for 80 is pretty established now."
