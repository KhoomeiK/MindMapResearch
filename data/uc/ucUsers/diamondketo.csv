Multiprocessing is not the same thing as OS multitasking. Multiprocessing is literally the use of multiple CPU cores. The word ""process"" in multiprocessing does not refer to the same word process as in PID.

**Multitasking** is an OS-level functions where the OS schedules the task to be ran in the future weighed by priority and resource availability. Because it's OS-level, its extremely easy to do this in Bash. Every task had a process ID (PID). If you're writing queues to read data, you're using multitasking not multiprocessing.

That's correct, `CAPVAR` is for constants however you've violated this many times in your code. Constant means ""once it's defined it should never be changed"". It's not forced or checked by Python but it's a promise.

The title is clickbait and suggest non-uniform expanding universe is a new problem in cosmology. Your claim is not at all evident from what we're talking about.

No, don't give me a strawman argument."

flask,fo453rw,t1_fo4346j,1587498345.0,"> I suppose I'm going about this the wrong way. What is the value of having a schema for a list of users and the projects they're associated with and a separate schema describing the projects and their contents?

You may wish to read an article on database designs and data models in SQL. For example, a User schema and Project schema often has a many to many relation (one user may belong to many projects and vice versa). It's useful to have the two schema separate for scalability otherwise designing one schema for both would only be good if you have a small database. This UserProject schema would look like users are rows and columns are ""is user in project A/B/C/etc"".

It seems you're unfamiliar with SQL and more importantly building relations? If so, I'd recommend avoiding SQLAlchemy or any ORM for now and use SQL to first build your relation and use a DB-API 2.0 connector to read your database in Python (e.g., pymysql for MySQL)."
flask,fo3zcje,t1_fo1cohk,1587495528.0,"First it's best to design a relation so that you're efficiently constructing your databases. I have never worked with a database with thousands of schemas so I'm not sure if I can answer your question. So far the minimal for web authorization you'd need 1-2 schemas: one for list of users and their profile information (e.g., roles, teams, or projects they're in) and one to describe roles, teams, or project.

There's many ways to design this depending on how many roles you wish to support, how many roles can a user take on, the hierarchy of your roles (e.g., admin > user >  public_user), and various other factors one may think of."
