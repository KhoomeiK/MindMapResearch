UCSD,fpf0an4,t1_fpew94a,1588558833.0,I completely agree and you forgot to mention school is completely different than a job and the real world becuz you are paying to go not getting paid to go... in a job you are paid to do a job and if that means work in a group be it you will still get paid but at school it’s not at all the same... I’m not ok with my grade being lowered becuz I can’t get a classmate to work with the group... that’s completely unfair and it’s not how it works in the real world...
UCSD,fkwrg04,t3_fl237j,1584602646.0,They can’t prove you cheated and there’s literally no way they will waste their time on trying to prove you cheated... I would tell them to fuck off becuz they are tracking you against your wishes and I’m pretty sure that’s a bigger problem when they admit it...  they are trying to threaten so that people don’t “cheat” are you joking it’s an online exam wtf is cheating... everything is fair game straight up as someone else mentioned are they serious lmfaooo thinking people won’t use notes or google... online classes are so easy to pass this way took a few like this
