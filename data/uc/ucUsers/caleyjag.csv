berkeley,fpjbcjq,t1_fpjagz2,1588662452.0,"I see what you are saying but I think most of us go that route for the challenge and/or curiosity, knowing full well it is not a vocational major. 

Nobody ever sold me it is a good career move. I just thought physics was interesting.

These days with the mounting cost of education I do think students need to think about the potential return on their investment, and physics careers dont generally shine too brightly in that regard compared to other disciplines."

berkeley,fpj9i78,t3_gdn1k6,1588660729.0,"What do you want to do?

If you want to be a serious physicist then a PhD is probably the way to go.

A lot of my physics peers from Cal ended up in software (and did extremely well - much better than I did going the science route). Not sure if that is up your street. 

I think internships are less relevant for science careers than in tech. They dont do any harm but a good PhD program in a strong research group would eclipse any internships at this stage in your career."

NI Vision is my main area. I got into it while in academia, where I think it is an excellent fit.

For my thesis, I went all in. I know a lot of professors encourage their students to basically compile their papers and stick a review chapter on the front - i.e. expend as little effort as possible since a thesis doesn't really help the prof in any way.

Fortunately for me my school encouraged us to do a good job of it.

I went in to monk mode for 4 months or so, cut out alcohol or fun, camped out in coffee shops and got it done. Once I found my rhythm I really enjoyed writing it, and now I have a book on my shelf I am pretty proud of.

&#x200B;

One thing is that people will question the point of writing a thesis since apart from your review committee, nobody will read it. I've found that not to be true in the modern era, since your thesis will most likely be searchable online and future researchers and students may (and likely will) stumble across it. With that in mind, you never know what doors it could open if you want to stay in a related field."

Most folks in industry are not empowered by their management to spend company resources on altruistic endeavors. It's not their fault as individual practitioners.
