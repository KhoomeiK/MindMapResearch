berkeley,fpi58j0,t1_fpi4i4s,1588633912.0,"""For clarity sake, the Lower Sproul Fee is to cover the debt service on the new building that the ASUC built in Sproul Plaza.  That debit service will still need to be paid despite COVID-19.  The campus health center, wellness resources, and funding assistance for students in need of emergency housing and basic needs are in full force and being taxed more than ever"""
berkeley,fphye57,t1_fphy89l,1588630110.0,Nowhere did I say I was disagreeing. I just posted this because I had heard a lot of people confused about why we are paying summer campus fees.
berkeley,fphpi3c,t1_fphmikr,1588625419.0,I figured :( All his socials besides Twitter are inactive I think. The last time I talked to him was last semester. Crazy how things can change. Rest In Peace you beautiful man

berkeley,fpa9hoj,t1_fpa8yka,1588443536.0,"Yeah exactly! Plus it teaches you about a lot of useful stuff such as retirement planning, 401k, insurance, mutual funds/ETFs etc, credit reports and more"
berkeley,fpa87pf,t1_fpa39my,1588442791.0,Nope! They make sure that both business and non-business students can take it.
berkeley,fp9zghh,t1_fp8u94d,1588437741.0,"Do you have any rule of thumb for a 6-week session? 

Thank you!"
berkeley,fp9wmc2,t3_gc4mrk,1588436082.0,"UGBA 135 (Personal Finance) teaches you how to lower your taxes and be smart about your finances. It's not like Rich Dad, Poor Dad, or some cunning personal finance stuff, but it is really useful stuff that every adult should know. Probably one of the most useful 'real-life' classes at Cal!"
berkeley,fp0w216,t3_gam576,1588218217.0,I'm international and I got mine through Bank of America as well.
berkeley,fov64s7,t1_fotp31u,1588096002.0,I think you are confusing Data 88 with CS 88
berkeley,fo8c801,t3_g5xhqm,1587593795.0,They expanded the waitlist so there might be some hope considering the increased demand!
berkeley,fnqoznj,t3_g34cml,1587169076.0,"As someone said earlier, I'm taking Data 100 and Econ 140 together right now and it's a great combo! I feel like I'm learning theory in Econ 140 that I can confidently apply in Data 100."
cscareerquestions,fk8vzxp,t1_fk8ppvw,1583963952.0,"Glad to know I wasn't the only one!! I had the same recruiter who left the company (I am sure for good reason) and I was emailing someone who wasn't even there. There were only 2 Superdays, I have no idea how they could have still been interviewing weeks and months after the actual Superdays. Scheduling interviews after the Superday took more than a month both times and I can't believe I wasted so much time communicating with these clowns. I must have exchanged north of 100 emails with the recruiters by the end of the process. Please leave a review on Glassdoor/Indeed so that no one else has to go through this horrible process as we did!"
