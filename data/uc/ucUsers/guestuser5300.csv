ucla,fni2bii,t3_g1tfm9,1586972782.0,I applied for housing after I got my transfer decision. Contact them and let them know how you haven’t heard back from admissions

ucla,fn4ilzm,t1_fn4hqwt,1586642135.0,I think second year or fall quarter of third year
ucla,fn4daio,t1_fn487pj,1586639017.0,Yea I agree. Everyone takes the biomed research class and then application is during week 7 of that quarter and I heard only half get chosen for interview and only 20 or so spots are open based on the labs available
ucla,fn3wcy5,t1_fn3pztr,1586629207.0,What did they say?

ucla,fmy3a2b,t1_fmy14jc,1586477198.0,Also true for impacted classes. Til week 10
ucla,fmtxmi4,t3_fxdjf5,1586380822.0,It’s really competitive. Three interview sections. And only 3-5 get selected I heard out of 100’s
ucla,fmssekn,t3_fx781s,1586361260.0,She curved her class when I took it. Like around 80% was an A. The average for exams used to be 65% or so and I would get 50%’s and on the second one I got 45. I studied a lot for it tbh but it was my first quarter so I didn’t know how to study on the quarter system. I ended the class with a C.
