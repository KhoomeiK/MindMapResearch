UCSantaBarbara,foldupo,t1_fol2wv5,1587860120.0,Wona Lee! She's the only professor for Korean language and she's honestly the best ðŸ’•ðŸ’•
UCSantaBarbara,foi0cty,t3_g71g8c,1587776150.0,I'm thankful for my Korean professor. She's gone above and beyond to make this quarter the best that it can be for her students during such a crazy time even though it means extra work for her. Out of all my classes her class is the easiest one to keep up with and stay motivated to work hard. I love her!! I wish there was a good way I could show just how much I appreciate her.
