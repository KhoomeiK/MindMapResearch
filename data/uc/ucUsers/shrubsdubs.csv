Frankly, yeah, it can take a lot of time to get around to things that you have to put some thought into, or that you don’t really want to do. You know you should do it, and it haunts you, gives you anxiety, but for some reason it’s painfully difficult for no apparent reason.
Or you might want to do something, but because you’re not as good as efficiently managing your time, you just won’t have time for it especially if it’s not a priority."
UCSantaBarbara,fpev95f,t1_fpeudz6,1588555682.0,dm’d you
UCSantaBarbara,fpeh87r,t3_g9i2wj,1588547499.0,Most you can do is just practice using symbols. Idk how he’s going about this with online learning but from my experience last quarter exams are way harder than any practice you’ve been given.
UCSantaBarbara,fopfbeq,t1_fopen38,1587960029.0,"^^ this. I asked my TA to email me my grade unofficially, because I didn’t have a reason that I needed it officially recorded, and they were perfectly willing to do it."
UCSantaBarbara,fom67c5,t1_foks3cc,1587879481.0,I personally asked for 200% time after I was still running out with 150. the specialist I was working with looked again at my evaluation results/the subscore differences and said it was okay
UCSantaBarbara,foi3ayl,t1_foi30ku,1587777852.0,"Okay, thanks! That was helpful"
UCSantaBarbara,fo5x0vx,t1_fo37s3i,1587538492.0,"Yup, why?"
UCSantaBarbara,fnmfixb,t1_fn6vq4v,1587070507.0,OP-I’m also in the same boat and considering switching to earth science!!
UCSantaBarbara,fmucy3t,t1_fmrlpxp,1586388956.0,"i've been occupied with school, didn't receive any emails about it, and bc for some reason i remember(perhaps inaccurately) registration for summer classes being way later in the quarter last year... Unnecessary comment lol"
ADHD,fmrvvld,t3_fwre72,1586337377.0,"The language “how not to not make it sound it like an excuse” is unfair to yourself. this is a real physiological condition that impacts your ability to function in nearly every aspect of your life and therefore a very valid explanation for your struggles. Accountability is important, but when it ignores the reality of your ADHD it is no longer accountability and is now full blown invalidation. Theres a high chance the “fuck ups” you’re referring to are bc of ADHD, and not because you somehow lacked accountability and determination.

No one has the right to shame you for that and you shouldn’t doubt yourself either. (I’m referring to the line “...which I completely agree with and at the end of the day they are my mistakes and I have to live with the consequences.”) This kind of language alone is reinforcing the false notion that ADHD can be overcome if one “just tries hard enough.” 


I say this because I used to do this too until I realized how much it was 1) hurting me 2) affirming people’s misconceptions about ADHD. 
 
The pressure I put on myself for school earlier this yr was insane once I figured out I could succeed with medication and accommodations. 
On one hand, I did work very hard to learn how to manage my symptoms and become a better student. My grades improved. 

On the other hand, because I felt desperate to prove to others(and myself) that I could do everything just like they could as neurotypicals, I got super angry with myself whenever I didn’t do as well/as much as I had hoped. 
For example, I wanted to be able to use my time every day as efficiently as possible to cram in studying, but I always ended up somehow wasting many hours doing nothing. 
I went from barely passing my chem classes my first year(regularly getting 40, 50, 60% on exams) to falling in love with the subject, doing great on the exams and scoring above average, (B+ instead of Ds like before), and deciding to minor it it. But I wasn’t proud. I was mad at myself for not being able to get As like my neurotypical friends. Mad because I wanted to switch to chem as a major but it was taking too much of a toll on me. 

But every goal like that, that I set was not accommodating to my executive dysfunction and I refused to acknowledge it. 




My self esteem was trash and anxiety at an all time high. If someone on the outside told me I was making excuses, I would defend myself. 
But I couldn’t defend myself from myself.

You know why you’re struggling, and that’s what matters. You know the truth. Do try, but if he still doesn’t understand after trying to educate himself, you don’t need to try and jump through hoops to get him to understand because it’ll only make everything harder for you."
ADHD,fmrulg5,t3_fwyi65,1586336032.0,"This can also be caused by childhood trauma(not saying I think you experienced it, just in general). I wonder to what extent people in this sub who can relate to this have also experienced trauma."
UCSantaBarbara,fmrlb4l,t3_fwx658,1586326743.0,"The wording of this email confused me. Are they saying that the student tested positive shortly after leaving for break at home, meaning that they contracted it while at school?"
UCSantaBarbara,fmrl7bq,t3_fx11q0,1586326645.0,Wait what?? Signups for summer have already started??
UCSantaBarbara,fmrkwkw,t3_fwzlai,1586326369.0,"In IV, I’m pretty sure yes. They were only closed this weekend as a precaution bc it was supposed to be deltopia."
UCSantaBarbara,fmq7oge,t1_fmq0j5t,1586294412.0,"Damn, for some reason I thought the flat rate only applied if you're a full time student with 12< units. Thanks!"
