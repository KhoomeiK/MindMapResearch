UCSD,fpdra3o,t3_gcocw9,1588532634.0,"um I'm not really sure but I know that FERPA laws are pretty strict with what they can do with this type of information, plus I don't think that UCSD has the time or resources to review 30,000+ accounts worth of activity"
UCSD,fpc6ic5,t3_gclyhh,1588489242.0,"LIGN 8 pretty easy imo. We have weekly reading quizzes but the readings are pretty short. The biweekly HWs are just longer quizzes and there is one 3-4 page paper due at the end of the quarter. 2 midterms, no final"
traderjoes,fpb592i,t3_gceqk5,1588462381.0,do they have gelatin? also what flavors are they?
UCSD,fpa3y2j,t1_fp8wfv5,1588440318.0,I think they were offering a free Pro membership to students during quarantine
UCSD,fp8fzym,t1_fp8d3me,1588391337.0,yup
UCSD,fp84cp3,t1_fp7mtuv,1588383139.0,I never had the Zoom consultation meeting and I still received it
UCSD,fp7gyrs,t3_gbqtt3,1588370432.0,"UPDATE: I heard back from them and I received $1500 basic needs emergency grant. I urge you to apply if you are facing financial difficulties right now.  

yeah, I applied to this about 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything back"
UCSD,fp7eotw,t1_fp7eeci,1588369222.0,maybe they might convert more singles into mini doubles if they anticipate the need
UCSD,fp7elvj,t3_gbpd2v,1588369177.0,"yeah, I applied a couple weeks ago but haven't heard back

Update: I received an email that I would be getting $1500"
cscareerquestions,fp4k195,t3_gb6pt3,1588300750.0,"You be surprised with how many people fail a course in the first two years of college. Its not the end of the world. My college has a policy that a class can be retaken up to 2 times, and if you pass, it'll replace the failing grade on your transcript. See if UofT has that. Also talk to your college advisors. Sometimes taking the class another time, makes the content alot more understandable."
UCSD,fp44pjl,t1_fp3klv8,1588291636.0,"he moved it to next week, May 8th"
UCSD,fp0g7cp,t1_foxhsgx,1588208639.0,bro I've applied to everything on that page and I haven't heard back except for Cal Fresh which honestly doesn't help me personally as my parents are the one buying the groceries. They have at least $17 MILLION DOLLARS for students and we haven't seen a penny. I don't know why you think that UCSD is paying their stimulus money to students cause it isn't happening as of now.
UCSD,fozatfi,t3_ga5bgd,1588187553.0,"Personally, I know that 20 was a good amount of work and it covered the data structures and programming knowledge that was heavily expanded upon in 40B.  I would only recommend it if you are confident in your Python skills and are willing to put in the extra time. IMO you can stack up on upper division classes in later quarters rather than struggling in these foundational courses."
UCSD,foxb8w4,t1_fox1az2,1588138880.0,"for real, I always found it ridiculous that Khosla gets paid more than the freaking president of the country"
UCSD,fosdnfa,t3_g9b08y,1588028663.0,Talk to your department and college advisors first of all. They'll give you better advice and might be able to grant you a unit extension
traderjoes,fooma0v,t3_g8ob17,1587941816.0,I doubt this exist. Trader Joe's has a lot of seasonal and limited items so their inventory is constantly changing and varies from store to store
UCSD,fo8x7vj,t3_g6df91,1587605746.0,ummmm I think its taking about how UCSD is doing research in finding more carbon neutral alternatives for gasoline through biodegradable sources
UCSD,fo8brvk,t3_g68eto,1587593552.0,they pushed the checkpoint and discussion deadlines till sunday now
UCSD,fo7j7i3,t1_fo6sp3l,1587579248.0,"to be fair, its only 50 minutes. Still think overall, its pretty unreasonable"
traderjoes,fo4qukl,t3_g5nhby,1587509454.0,1 to 3
UCSD,fo2j370,t3_g5ckg8,1587464347.0,"i know alot of people minor in cog sci, I think its great because of its machine learning electives. Other popular options are math, econ, or a physical science

just remember that you can't minor/double major in anything from Jacobs ie mae, ceng, cse, etc. 

reach out to the HDSI advisors too, I'm sure they'd be happy to help"
UCSD,fo250zo,t3_g50yag,1587449933.0,we should start charging them late fees
cscareerquestions,fny14kq,t3_g4j609,1587350898.0,"Some schools let you ""graduate"" even if you have like a semester left. Have you looked into that at your school? 

Edit: this might be just referring to walking across the stage but I would still talk your college advisers to confirm"
UCSD,fnxzoik,t3_g4jl92,1587349932.0,"&#x200B;

1. Make a LinkedIn and start connecting with people you know. From there try to connect with recruiters at companies your interested in and start talking to them. 
2. Attend the Fall Career Fair (if it happens). Make sure to dress professionally and bring several copies of your resume. After the career fair, connect with the recruiters you talked to on LinkedIn. 
3. Start applying as early as August and apply, apply, apply. I started really late (January) but I still applied to over a 100 positions. Starting late was my biggest mistake. Continue applying until you get the position you want. 
4. Make sure your resume is perfect. Use a good template, not just one from Google Docs.
5. Practice Leetcode and prep for the behavioral interview. 

Check out r/cscareerquestions for more advice and let me know if you have any other questions."
UCSD,fnrkfii,t3_g3d8dh,1587191786.0,"just curious, what majors/depts require internship?"
UCSD,fnq8q15,t1_fnq39go,1587159841.0,"oh okay, my bad"
cscareerquestions,fnfp2xe,t3_g1h2y8,1586912509.0,IMO take the virtual internship especially since money is an issue here. A virtual internship looks much better than no internship and if you make the effort I'm sure you will be able to make some meaningful connections.
cscareerquestions,fnc79sy,t3_g0wcsz,1586830135.0,You could look for data analytics roles. Those would definitely prepare you for data science roles.
UCSD,fn2cn8m,t3_fyx6ss,1586584466.0,"Personally, I don't think so. It might just be wishful thinking tho"
UCSD,fn0k943,t3_fyjuh1,1586543477.0,Please don't. There is a reason that all non-essential places are closed right no. Do your part and stay home.
UCSD,fmydogm,t1_fmy6zqb,1586483742.0,"Yeah it looks like I wasn't selecting the ""allthruUCSD"" option. Thanks!!"
UCSD,fmkc34n,t3_fvrv52,1586150179.0,I've heard goodnotes is really good
