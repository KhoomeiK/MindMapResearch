I want to make a clarification, which is that in my experience, the vast majority of high-achieving / motivated people aren't like this. In fact, as someone involved around UPE / HKN / Research labs, the vast majority of people who had success academically were also very humble and sincere and chill to talk to, though a bit socially awkward, it was never negative. On the flip side, a large percentage of the people I met in CS clubs, business frats, etc., who were chasing top jobs/internships and things like that were very condescending and remind me of things described in the post and in the comments. Just wanted to stick up for the academia nerds in the thread :')"
MachineLearning,fomc5fr,t3_g806cs,1587884808.0,"All researchers who have touched deep RL are not at all surprised by this finding. Ex., DDPG algorithm is known to be quite unstable in practice and need some of the same tricks such as orthogonal initialization. Ablation on even simpler environments is something that should be more popular."
MachineLearning,focs15y,t3_g6r0yv,1587675074.0,"Really surprised to see none of the comments address that it is valuable because of domain adaptation — MTurk and other things like that work for ""simple"" labelling such as imagenet, but just look at https://scale.com/3d-sensor-fusion/cuboid , that requires lots of engineering to do. Their value (which you may be right, might be overvalued for now depending on their future but it _is_ a startup) comes from a combination of being first to market & the engineering work."

MachineLearning,fo64exw,t1_fo61x3p,1587546102.0,"Pretty sure all other self driving companies (cruise, waymo, etc.) use LIDAR in some capacity.

Pros: super accurate, cm level depth map of surroundings so easier to make decisions

Cons: can't _really_ distinguish objects (i.e., trash bag from traffic cone, since only depth not rgb) , expensive (although cost has gone down), fragile. Also, point cloud data is much more high dimensional obviously and expensive to store / consume (just see the dataset released by Lyft earlier and Waymo recently... people have trouble just doing EDA)"

SSBM,fnct8de,t3_g0vqk9,1586846437.0,maybe it's just me since I skipped through it but it took way too long to show what the actual tech is and there was some way too loud music halfway through so i just closed it..
