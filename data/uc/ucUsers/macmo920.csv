UCSC,fp1i2hi,t3_gane5r,1588236252.0,"Used to teach CS to AP students before transferring to UCSC. Udemy is good, codeacademy is okay. You can practice your skills on codingbat. However the best way to continue getting better is to keep writing more things that you want to make. Following someone's project list/tutorial is good, but it may often feel like you're being taught something that can only be applied in a single way. Making something you want to make, while figuring out the information you need to complete it helps a lot. Obviously you want to figure out the basics first, but once you're comfortable with the early stuff, then you're set.

If you're interested in learning more + have like 1hr+ per week, I'd be happy to jump in a zoom/discord call and teach a bit. No charge to you; I just really, really miss teaching."

UCSC,fotdjz2,t3_g9ejbm,1588050860.0,"Are there actually people arguing over who has the harder major?

Bro, who fucking cares about how hard your major is? Get the work done. There were people before you who completed the work, and there will be people after you. If all you want to do is complain about how hard it is, then find a new major. There are other people who would **love** to take your spot at a STEM-impacted school.

Edit: I understand venting frustration to friends, but there's a clear distinction between that and pushing the opinion that your major is harder. Everyone is studying different things because the world seeks knowledgeable people in any x subject.

If their major is so much easier, *learn it.*

Edit 2: [To the downvotes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDNZX2nql2Y) Cheers."

UCSC,fomnasz,t3_g823zx,1587896593.0,"Hi. Sorry for the late message, hope the notif doesn't wake you if your sleep schedule is normal lol. 

I'm a transfer student, and I've been feeling very similarly. It's pretty challenging for me to make friends in person. However, if you're interested I'd be happy to hop on a Zoom/Discord/whatever call and chat for a bit every few days, just as a means of getting social interaction and venting if need be. Lemme know, happy to share part of my day with more than homework or videogames."
nintendo,folyjtt,t3_g7vuf0,1587873601.0,"Right now I'm getting close to graduating college. I had an internship lined up for the summer, but sadly that looks very cancelled. I hope to work at this place in the future though, they have the kind of work I want to do and the moral compass that would make me proud to work there. I think I could make it, or an internship next summer, happen. So, I'm excited to see what my experience will be like in that regard."
