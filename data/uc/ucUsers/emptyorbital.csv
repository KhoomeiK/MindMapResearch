berkeley,fphl8hw,t1_fpfx9ab,1588623248.0,"Well, you do make an awfully good point."
ucla,fp7lsvj,t1_fp4c358,1588373053.0,"Thank you so much! All of that is really reassuring to hear. Were you also a chem major? I'm looking for a more inclusive/supportive environment which is why I'm hesitant to go with berk. I've heard that the people there don't go out of their way to tear you down but that there is a sense of competition in the air. Do you mean that high school AP courses were harder than your chem classes at UCLA? Did you go to a very rigorous high school? One thing that does appeal to me is the quarter system; although I'm used to the semester system I would love to take as many classes as possible. Do most students that look for a research opportunity end up obtaining one, and (if you were a transfer) did you find that there were lots of transfer resources as a stem student? For example, is there guidance in finding research opportunities, did you have difficulty getting in contact with an academic advisor, were you given proper orientation to the campus, etc. Also, do you know if it is common to get opportunities to work with the medical center? Thanks for all your help :-)"
ucla,fp1p3tl,t3_g6c2ov,1588243266.0,"I'm a transfer student that is currently choosing between completing my chemistry major at either UC Berkeley or UCLA. I've looked into the chem major at Cal, but I don't know much about it at UCLA. Are there any chem majors or premeds that can provide some insight into what attending the school has been like (class size, professors, competition, grading curve, research opportunities, courseload, etc)? Can anyone advocate for why I should go to UCLA? I'm having a hard time choosing so I would be grateful for any input. Thank you :)"
berkeley,foq61br,t1_foq4bqp,1587984281.0,"Can you elaborate on the bad professors? Are they prevalent in the upper-division courses? I have looked into the fall courses I would be taking and one of the professors had consistently bad rate my professor reviews, so I was thinking of trying to avoid him, although I'm concerned it may throw off my pathway if I wait. Also, I've heard that research is encouraged but highly competitive. I don't have a 4.0 (I'll be coming in with about a 3.75) and I'm worried I will not be able to compete with those who do."

berkeley,foq5hle,t1_foq300h,1587983720.0,"I'm sorry about your being the target of a crime. The chemistry program is strong, which is my primary reason for wanting to go, and I'm especially drawn to the small size of the CoC and the personalization that will inevitably come with that size. Still, I wonder whether its high ranking can be attributed to the quality of education that the students themselves receive, or if it instead is a result of other parameters such as the professors' research and accomplishments, the historical significance, etc. I also wonder if there really is a difference among all these top schools - at the end of the day they are all great. Thank you so much for sharing your input! I really appreciate it. I may have to take you up on that DM offer"
berkeley,foq0wox,t1_foq0lt6,1587978937.0,"That's a good point! I'm actually not going to move out if we're still in shelter-in-place, but if for some reason we are allowed on campus next fall or spring, I think you're right that finding housing will be a little easier than usual. I just hope it's easy enough to get housing even as a non-freshman.

Is it really not that dangerous? I would hope not. Are you a female student? I think it's interesting to note that my male friends seem to brush off the danger but my female friend down there warns me of it. I honestly don't know what to believe because I have such limited personal experience with the area. Thank you for informing me that there are safer parts, that does give me a little more ease."
berkeley,foq0lzt,t3_g8otf6,1587978634.0,"Please don't put your dog down :( I'm really sorry about your situation, but I promise there will be a solution. If you start a GoFundMe, I would donate. Lots of people would donate quickly to save a dog's life. There is a way to keep this dog alive, please don't give up on it. Again, I am really truly sorry for your situation and I can't imagine how stressful and upsetting this all must be, and I hope you hang in there."
