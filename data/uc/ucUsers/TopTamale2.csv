UCI,fo5ki28,t3_g5ac27,1587527886.0,"The main argument on the floor in senate:

For :
1. aid in the pandemic can coexist with bills like this. 
2. it‚Äôs a perfectly good bill so it can be passed right away.                                                  
3.The author worked with the esports since September and doesn‚Äôt want to wait any longer
4. ASUCI has millions to spend from
5. ASUCI can‚Äôt do anything about students leases or housing insecurities

Against :
1. Further drains funds with out considering the pandemic first.
2. Students polled against it 
3. The things in the bill that are being funded are not urgent items while covid 19 is.
4. Reserves currently have been drained
5. Others tried to allocate 160k or so to student scholarships (which can be spent how students would like: like leases) and was making it inclusive. But senate shot it down because they didn‚Äôt feel like enough people would benefit from the money and they didn‚Äôt think the executives would make the scholarships inclusive. 

I don‚Äôt believe anything will be added to the reserves this year. Since everyone in the executive body is allocating their money toward the pandemic. Senate on the other hand...

What happened to the reserves/ what can‚Äôt be spent:
1,100,000 from the infrastructure bill, + 250,000 for the dsc. And administration needs to reserve approx 500,000 for emergencies relating to SUCI to keep it functioning. 
                                                                            
What‚Äôs left in the reserves:
This leaves 750,000 left of reserves for other use. Reserves are meant for one time purchases for emergencies and a cushion against over spending. And none has been used for this pandemic at all.

2. Budgeted in ASUCI? This one is a weird one but I know it changed every year, it would be an unstable source since ego depends on how much the ASUCI will give and IF they will give since if we have a senate like this, they will prob cut it. (Unstable, very short)


The womxns hub needs a stable place to get funding from, they‚Äôve been getting more students. Reaching over thousands each year and would like to accommodate more on that. They don‚Äôt want to be afraid of changing locations and etc.

This is in the added new constitution. they are gonna add RONR. Kimo Gandall is gonna be a Justice next year too (everyone else is graduating) Next year is gonna be worse if this passes! RONR has details to many process which Kimo would argue isn‚Äôt inconsistent with the constitution. Don‚Äôt give FOP more power. The Current constitution is the only thing that‚Äôs ever stopped them.

‚Äî-copied from the new constitution
Sec. 1. Parliamentary Authority. The rules contained in the current edition of Robert‚Äôs Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR) shall govern ASUCI in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the ASUCI governing documents."
UCI,fnj5lbj,t1_fniqlp3,1586992398.0,"Basically, for the meetings so far (like making the election code and electing new deputies) the Rules would just make meetings on the fly. They don‚Äôt contact anyone but the internal SAG but still conduct meetings if she can‚Äôt make the last minute ones. 

A senator questioned why did no one get a formal agenda and why did no one, including the Chief justice, get notified?

Kimo Gandall simply responded that people like the Chief Justices isn‚Äôt a main voting person so they don‚Äôt need to be present. As for notifying the public, they said they don‚Äôt need too. No one needed to get notified as long as enough people in the committee meet and talk about the stuff.(Note this was in the context of other committee members as well as the public). Basically you don‚Äôt even have to invite other committee members as long as theirs enough people.
He justified it with RONR. Saying that it‚Äôs an okay practice for committees to meet suddenly like this and act like this. Btw Kimo Gandall was present for the ones like the elections code but not the chief who wasn‚Äôt notified as usual.

This is the main reason why RONR shouldn‚Äôt be followed if Kimo Gandalls interpretation is the real interpretation of what committees are.

As for the Deputy commissioner nomination meetings, they admited to not INTERVIEWING any of the election deputy‚Äôs. In meeting for selecting the election deputies the election commissioner was not present, to which FOP tried to justify that  the phrase ‚Äúas needed‚Äù meant that they did not need to have him present for either of the code rewriting or the nominations. A senator who sat in for the meeting (it‚Äôs always like an hour before senate) said that many of them didn‚Äôt read about the candidates beforehand... except for one of them.... (if you all can guess) The Internal SAG was not able to locate the email so didn‚Äôt know about these people beforehand either. 

Some will try to argue that the Chief Justice was notified of ONE meeting. that was in the beginning of the year when balance was still present. She was not notified again for the SEVERAL others.

I believe that they have been twisting and manipulating, even violating several rules. It‚Äôs very hypocritical as they would tear others down and attempt to humiliate others in the name of the ‚Äúbylaws‚Äù and ‚Äúconstitution‚Äù. Yet they do not hold themselves to the same standard when they violate clearly rules (bylaws, constitution, and even UC policy). 

The only rule they can‚Äôt wobble around is the constitution. Why else do you think they are trying ‚Äúfix‚Äù the constitution? 

As they‚Äôve done before, they are revising things to suit THEIR needs (not the students) because they believe they are right and anything that stops them is wrong. 2/3rd senate should NOT be able to control every branch. Just know...

They put money in bills as candy. Don‚Äôt bite in.

More Tea, as for the SAG and slates, it‚Äôs basically a matter of what election codes the commissioner is following right now. It‚Äôs a super grey area. Hopefully the old codes win out cuz that‚Äôs what‚Äôs posted on the website and students were first informed with. 

Basically, for the new codes:
Senate passed an election code in one day that increased individual spending (restriction change on how much money they can receive from one person - it was like 75 and now can prospectively cap at 2000 per candidate). It has other things but I‚Äôll think about it. In this it also changed a lot of the things like how the SAG isn‚Äôt banned from being in a slate. Not sure why Fo- I mean, ruleS- Shoot sorry, I mean internal governance committee changed this...? Maybe someone can tell me down here. 

Right now I think the election commissioner is following the original code since the timeline hasn‚Äôt changed 

(Like if we followed the new code then candidate sign up would‚Äôve been a week or two earlier. Like everyone would‚Äôve been ineligible)

However, I can see senators arguing that the new code should be followed. But that means everyone who signed up after the candidate thing are technically out of the running. Well everyone but like the two people that signed up early.

Edit:
It‚Äôs the governance and internal policy committee"

-A couple of Schools only get like 2K to allocate to clubs of the 450k so schools with low funding and want to start up a community get barely anything to split. Well others are getting HUGE portions each year. It‚Äôs a big gap between who gets how much.

Judical board ruled against that, Judical board also notices there‚Äôs too many people in rules, rules against committees

-it was 800k to just to renovate the engineering workshop and give machines. 35k to engineering council (Bill was written by engineering Senator)
-main controversy is that they didn‚Äôt even discuss with prostaff to make sure the money could go out, they also passed it in a day (with out discussing anything on the senate floor) and turns out their legislation was written wrong so it got stalled financially


The new justice wants access to emails to look up some past trials he believes were ruled bad


Chief Justice takes too long to give him what he requested, basically ALL THE EMAILS in existence 


Creates a legislation OOPS sorry I mean A senator creates a legislation to fix the bylaws again to let him and everyone get email privileges.


Senate subpeona‚Äôd Chief Justice for not complying with the new bylaw revision saying that the Judical email should be shareable to everyone in the Judical board. However, The prostaff said that The Chief could violate FERPA and HIPAA (this is something professors would be fired for, and she‚Äôs only a student)

They wrote an impeachment bill for an executive with language that didn‚Äôt need to be there as it was a speculation. From the perspective of many students it was sexist. 


On the same day as the impeachment, didnt let the womxn hubs bill which would LET STUDENTS (direct democracy) vote if they would like to add an extra bit small WAIVE-ABLE fee. 

-The womxn hub said they reach thousands of students from just their area, to events they hold. They even outlined what they were going to do. As well as reallocating a big chunk of the funds to financial aid.                                           
-The fee would continue for 30 years, but would be waive able. They did this because the fresh hub (the place THATS OPEN RN SO IF YOU NEED FOOD, provides food and necessities ) had only 10 years and said that that‚Äôs not enough.         
-it would pass if enough STUDENTS voted yes to it on the ballot.                                          
-NOTE the STUDENTS DECIDE

When you defend 10% of the WHOLE school population (anyone who pays ASUCI fees), you leave students who are in specific schools to lose their voices on their Senator. That wording means that people from OUTSIDE the school of humanities can vote against the humanities senator. The flip side is, if a school really hates their Senator, they do not have enough students to vote them out by themselves since the number is so disproportionate to a specific school.

That‚Äôs why it should be school specific. I would get it if you said it was 10 of the SPECIFIC SCHOOL population.

UCI,fmmdao1,t1_fmmd9om,1586203203.0,"WHY THE CONSTITUTION WAS NOT LIKED

The constitution clearly treats branches differently also (note the processes to impeach judicial, executive, and senate). The wording of maladministration was apparently important? It was something that was learned in some kinda law class and it was purposely left out for the judicial board. I cant remember the exact meaning as this was second hand but it has to do what you can charge people for when impeaching them. When questioned about it the parliamentarian said it had to do with ‚Äúdue rights‚Äù. So basically the judicial Board should have separate due rights!? The parliamentarian didn‚Äôt answer the statement on having separate due rights. Then the senate decided to pass it anyways despite senators trying to make it equal by removing/ adding it.

Also,
The constitution also gives money (750k is split percentage wise to our schools) to schools that have said they don‚Äôt want it. Several ASUCI members were also concerned because schools have said they will withdraw funding if ASUCI provides money. There was a lot of disagreement with the cost breakdown as well. It didn‚Äôt consider the presence of funding already. Some wanted to give more to small schools less to big schools. But senate never really worked out the pieces on that cuz Why discuss something that‚Äôs so good? Am I right? -this piece was specifically left for senate to ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù since it was controversial in the 8hr meeting. However senate did not make or allow any changes to it.

So the biggest things that needed to be worked on was one, the medium/ who was giving out the money so that clubs could actually get it. Two, making sure that clubs don‚Äôt lose the support they already have, or at least accommodate for that. 

I think giving money to clubs is great but why does senate always have to mess it up with shoddy work or try to add a poop stain on the bill with out even letting it get rubbed off?

Note, if they just made ONE bill for just club funding and actually worked with pro staff. CLUBS WILL GET THEIR MONEY. Yeah I disagreed with many of the constitution revisions due to the fact that many were rushed and not well thought out. It was literally forced out thought despite having many clear holes. 

And of course the petition arguments. Cuz even now senate is trying not to be recalled. Note that the recall for the executives were not as successful as for the senators where most were knocked out within hours. Where more people than the people who voted them in voted them out.

Edit: TDLR: 
impeachment process = weird separate due processes; Giving key to club = done in ways students might not get it; Petition= senate is salty"

Looking at the senates actions:

They tried to say that 8 hrs was enough to justify things with changes in policy and MONEY. Without having pro staff present or helping with corrections later on.

So basically, it was one day with the ASUCI as a whole (8hrs).

And then another day in senate were SENATE decided what revisions was passed. There were many debatable items. Please note that many arguments against certain things were left out. Most of them came from the opposing sides. Then passing it the same day with clear disadvantages

This was also posted only 2-3 hours before senate, A whole CONSTITUTION was posted only hrs before senate. A senator even brought up how it was still being REVISED as she was trying read it in depth. It was upsetting that Senate allowed this to slide by. Any edits after a legislation is posted, should be done on the senate floor or in committees. 

Some argued that all senators should‚Äôve come to the revision meeting (a Saturday) if they wanted to see the constitution (only the couple of senators who could make it had access to it).

Eh though, I think if we all vote right, next years senate will be better. I‚Äôm serious get some senators that actually don‚Äôt think students are mindless blobs. You should see how some of the senators think of senate and the students against them. 

-edit: many bills from senate has shoddy research and many senators don‚Äôt like to actually talk to directors or students *cough cough* every other bill or something. DSC one seems researched enough, just had weird stuff on it that could‚Äôve been fixed/clarifed

-edit: don‚Äôt take money from people with out even telling them and don‚Äôt use it for things that students don‚Äôt need in the CRISIS 

Also vote pls. For people who thinks how senate is being run rn is kinda crap. Not for those who justify it or make it seem better than it was."
