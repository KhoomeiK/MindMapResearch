COVID19PGH,fpegtrf,t1_fpe2gwd,1588547273.0,"I get your point that the monkey study is promising that humans might be able to develop immunity. I was wrong to say that your post was not well informed. I apologize for that, you’re clearly well informed. Your post started off with the assumption that humans can develop immunity. My intention was to point out that that is still an assumption because we don’t have evidence in humans. I hope we can understand each other a littler better."
COVID19PGH,fpedieh,t1_fpe2gwd,1588545383.0,"My original point is still valid. Even with the non-peer reviewed preprint you showed (which does seem really promising, thanks for sharing), there’s still no evidence that humans can develop long lasting immunity."
bioinformatics,fpdtolv,t1_fpd3s7g,1588534019.0,Check out the Carnegie Mellon University of Pittsburgh joint program in Computational Biology. Can highly recommend it!
COVID19PGH,fpdgh62,t1_fpdg480,1588526519.0,There’s no need to be condescending. I have tried to be polite in our conversation but you have not extended the same respect.
COVID19PGH,fpdfo7v,t1_fpdfdtp,1588526071.0,Have a great day.
COVID19PGH,fpd5w4s,t1_fpd5g55,1588520487.0,"I don’t think your conclusion is valid. People become immune when they develop antibodies that help fight off the virus in the future. 

There is no evidence that people can become immune. Quoting a lack of evidence is not evidence. 

I don’t usually comment on these things but it bothers me when people make unsupported claims. That’s why I pointed out your assumption that people can become immune. Making big generalizations like that contribute to misinformation. It’s better to say we don’t know than to say something incorrect.

COVID19PGH,fpd28ur,t1_fpcs2xl,1588518285.0,"Just FYI the research is not complete that lets us know if people can develop immunity. Some other corona viruses do not lead to lasting immunity. I understand that you wanted to share your thoughts, but I don’t think this comment is very well informed.  (Edit:spelling)"

Hammocks,fot854p,t1_fot7ncf,1588046858.0,"I see yeah, I’m looking for a balance of convenience and weight/size. Becket hitch seems fine, but a buckle just seems easier to adjust.  How much space do your cinch buckles take up? Apparently they’re not too heavy, which is nice."
Hammocks,fot6ze7,t1_fot6ouw,1588046065.0,"I see, yeah that figures. Got any recommendations? I did look at cinch buckle type suspensions (from Dutch) since they seem lighter than daisy chain (Atlas) style straps but easier than ultralight methods. I would like to hold two adults (400 lbs probably)"

Hammocks,forwy93,t1_forw2qw,1588019961.0,"Thanks for your input! I'm glad to hear that works well.

bicycling412,fob5u77,t1_foaq40a,1587656426.0,Thanks for sharing your experiences. I figured it was a little more nuanced than that. Now I wish they would have just marked the rest of the streets to truly avoid!
bicycling412,foaprsh,t1_foapgn1,1587650576.0,"Ah, that makes sense! I appreciate your explanation."
bicycling412,foam2mn,t1_foalomc,1587648972.0,"Thanks for the response!

I do remember reading that, but it’s not really clear how either is related to the unmarked streets. What’s worse, a cautionary or unmarked route? My guess is that on-street is safer than unmarked, which is safer than cautionary. Does that sound right?"

bioinformatics,fntthf7,t3_g3s63v,1587248318.0,"Like the other poster has shared, follow what sounds interesting to you. Sounds like you're expanding on courses, etc. Bioinformatics/computational biology is definitely its own thing now, but you're right in that its interdisciplinary. If you speak to a biotech company that wants to hire a computational biologist, they're going to be able to understand that your skill set is interdisciplinary and are not going to be confused. You don't need to be a software engineer, you just need to understand the relevant components of each field. It helps to take a fair amount of courses all over the place and you'll naturally begin to find what is most interesting to you. Personally, I lean towards the CS side of things because it is easier to work on than *in vivo* wetlab biology work, and it pays better too."
XVcrosstrek,fnmwwmv,t3_g2hjut,1587079746.0,"Awesome, thanks for sharing! Do you have any special equipment or mods? Did you push its off road limits or take it easy? I’ve been thinking about getting one for awhile and just want to learn what it can do!"

bioengineering,fng7h5d,t3_g1jwjn,1586924206.0,"I majored in both. Your job prospects are better with the CS degree, but you probably already knew that. A CS degree will not help you design medical devices, nor would it prepare you in anyway for the pharmaceutical industry. For those, electrical/mechanical engineering and biochemistry/chemical engineering are great routes. Bioengineering has a mix of stuff, but if you’re interested in something that’s totally bioengineering, I’d say go for it. Medical device engineering is probably the most famous area within bioengineering, so I’d say for that, BioE is a safe degree bet. To increase your future pay, a MS is often suggested. Let me know if you are wondering anything else in particular."

I’m also a beginner and wasn’t going to purchase the absolute best item. I’m really glad I got what I did. Aside from the agreeable price, the small footprint of the drums is actually super nice in my apartment. You might want to consider that too. Only the snare is mesh, and honestly the rubber on the toms is really responsive and so much better than I could have imagined. Smaller and more lightweight too. As for the module, I’m perfectly satisfied with the 15 drum kits, although customization is limited. Once you plug into a computer though, that doesn’t matter."
