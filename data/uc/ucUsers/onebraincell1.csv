Edit: Wait jk I realized you can just upload images for a custom design"
UCSantaBarbara,foyyhxq,t3_gad7tb,1588181534.0,"UCSB is generally known for having a really lax community. And it’s really easy to surround yourself with similar people you vibe with and just ignore the shitty ones who might not accept you the way you are since it’s such a big school

Plus the social life here isn’t all about beaches and sororities. There are so many other aspects to the social life here that make it much better than other places! Overall, it’s about finding your community, which can be difficult at first but it’ll be so worth it once you do. 

But I will agree with the comment above that just generally being healthy and fit is a priority to a majority of people here. So if you feel like pushing yourself towards that you’ll have a supportive environment to do so too :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fni6l1c,t3_g1wmpf,1586974847.0,I wonder how the test will be like if it’s open note/book. They have to somehow make it tricky so it’s not basic memorization questions?
UCSantaBarbara,fm5zemz,t3_ftav50,1585783082.0,"Not unpopular opinion, it basically feels like a self taught class if a huge chunk of material we have to read and learn on our own. I understand university faculty are working hard to make this remote learning work for us but I felt it was really undermining how we feel as students by saying “I know your stressed; we are too:)” not to mention she used the wrong you’re lol. 

She’s really not being empathetic towards this entire situation and how some students may be extremely lacking the proper environment and resources to succeed this quarter let alone in this class that requires so much of us. I’m glad people complained to her but I feel like we need to push back even more"
