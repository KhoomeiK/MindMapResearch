nfl,fpgx6gm,t1_fpgrakt,1588611109.0,"If a player came into the league and put up 1700 yards, that would put him at ninth most in a season ever (Rice topped out at 1848, which is third behind Megatron and Julio). They would have to get 1700 yards for 13 and a half seasons in order to break Rice's career record. 

If a player scored 17 receiving TDs in a season, that would tie them for 5th with 10 other players (Rice included, though he also holds second with 22 in 1987 (a season in which he only played *12 games*)). It would take just over 11 and a half seasons like that to tie/beat Rice.

I think the only one that could be beaten is career receptions, but even then, that's with some very generous progression of the passing game, as it would take a player having Michael Thomas' record-breaking 149 catch season almost 10 and a half times in order to beat it. 

Yards from scrimmage probably isn't realistic, but Frank Gore is only 4300 yards off, and I feel like if anyone could just keep chugging long enough, it would be Gore (if someone would just sign him already). It would only take 10 of CMC's 2019 (2392 yScm), which ranks 3rd all time. All purpose yards is pretty much the same story"
nfl,fpeuh26,t1_fpekefg,1588555194.0,"I think a part of the LB coverage thing is he's still making reads presnap and doesn't adjust to a LB dropping into coverage, or is reading another player and snaps straight to throwing without checking that the lane is open. I think he could improve on that with more starting experience, though it's no guarantee"

Shanahan seems to have a lot more control of the draft than most head coaches that aren't just straight up the GM (the elite guys like Belichick and BoB), and I know that he and Lynch will discuss specific players, to the point where I presume he says something like ""if it's reasonable, get me Aiyuk.
