By all means, stand strong, but if your man is weak enough to succumb to political pressures to the point of where he gets that angry then it's time to hang up the towel.  


That being said I personally wouldn't blame him But rather your choice of communication. Texting is fast becoming the worst way to communicate with others, and it's effortless to misconstrue things as being negative. Speaking from personal experience here, as I've recently lost 2 relationships as a result of this and it made no difference what I said either.

That being said the way he approached you is disrespectful and a good indicator of what kind of man he is. I also think in this case it is very disappointing that your friend doesn't acknowledge what he said as being disrespectful.  


 It's important to have friends that question your motivations but this just comes off as shallow. Race doesn't define who you are inside, it's what you do that defines you, your body is simply a vessel.   


So find people who treat you with the care and compassion you would receive from a good family member and disregard those who are unwilling to look past their own bias and are about as deep as a bowl of cereal. Of course, give people chances but not to the extent of the cost of your own character, find someone that lifts that character up...which will be difficult at 20yo."

That's a good point though if you took the time and put in the effort your degree it's easier to come back to something.

A large percentage of the workforce now has a basic bachelor's degree now making them worth less and less and less; and people need to adapt to a decreasing supply of jobs. Most people forget what they learn 6 months after a class is over. Companies realize this and make adjustments so that they offer job listings for qualified individuals with very very low pay."

the c940 does not run well with linux distros either lots of problems with the transition from computer to tablet mode.

Fedora is in a similar position as well. the X series has support for Linux, but not the yoga series.
