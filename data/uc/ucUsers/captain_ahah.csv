pics,foq1t3z,t1_foq10yu,1587979875.0,"Sure, ‘cept when you said “good old” you mispronounced “modern and contemporary and currently unresolved” —because while this argument began millennia ago, atheist philosophers still have not, in the current day, answered the question. 

Yet after 2600 years, atheists still talk their endless “moral chatter” (as eminent atheist philosopher Gould put it).

Not one argument provided for objective mora values and duties on atheism exists.

Not... even... one.

So when I hear atheists talking about moral *progress* rather than mere moral *change* and crying out against the evils of religion, or whatever it is that day... I see what they are really doing: stealing terms, wording, and a concept that uniquely belongs to religion (usually Christianity because that’s the familiar one) and counterfeiting it so that it appears that on their worldview they can contribute to the global moral dialogue. 

But this is a fraud. 

They can make no such contribution —not one philosophically and intellectually consistent with their beliefs. All they can do is deviate momentarily. 


When atheists talk their moral superiority-despite-being-impotent-to-make-moral-assertions, all I can do is meditate on the fact that after 2,600 years... the atheist camp has not produced a single argument for the existence of moral values and judgements without God (no matter how liberally defined).

You’d think it’d be easy, right? 

Also, without God, we’d have a lot less than some guy named Morales. We’d have true nothing in the philosophical sense: the lack of all properties and all potentiality, such that if there were properties there’d yet be no potential to create and if there were potential there’d be no properties with which to create. Absolute nothing. Not quantum something. Not History Channel “nothing created something.” —true nothingness. And I don’t think “Morales” would exist in that, since existence is a property."
pics,foq0u4z,t1_fonn47p,1587978864.0,"Well that’s a pointless thing to say. Theism also isn’t a group. So?

Let me phrase it in a special way that hammers out the distinction between a group of people who believe a thing uniformly and the belief itself, since you’ve failed to differentiate: 

Historically, in the 20th century alone, groups of individuals who uniformly subscribed to atheism as a foundational/core belief worked together to organize the murders of more people than any other group (or groups, collectively) of individuals who uniformly subscribed to theism or any religion over a period of 2,000 years.

So atheism is not a group. Neither is theism. That’s a strange point to make... 

But groups following atheism murdered more people in a single century (Pew Research Center study given in previous comments) than all religious and theistic groups combined in the course of 2,000 years.

Quit pretending atheism is somehow enlightened and uniquely incapable of evil. 

Atheism **is** cancer, precisely because unlike all other belief systems, it doesn’t struggle to define good or evil, it outright claims there is no objective good or evil.

It is the only major worldview that has the capacity to utterly strip the human being at its core of any inherent value, as a categorical and definitional move. Groups oppress other groups. Individuals against individuals. Only atheism swipes its hand at all human beings in all places at all times. 

All other religions, even the backwoods-assed ones, while they can be horrid, they nevertheless retain some kernel of value in people, even if only in some particular kind of people.

Only Christianity says this kernel is in everyone.

But only atheism, as Darwin said (paraphrasing), can lead society to accept that if a person were raised precisely in the same way as hive bees, we’d happily eat our husbands and murder our daughters, and no one would bat an eye. Only atheism says this is morally the same as caring for our families.

Darwin, Nietzsche, Camus, Sartre, Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer —they all recognized this. 

I can stand atheism. I can stand theism. I can stand all of it except for atheists who want to rid themselves of moral duties yet talk endlessly about the evils of the world.

If you are an atheist you have no basis for making objective moral value judgements.

And a world without morals cannot function. Hence, atheism is literally social cancer."

RadicalChristianity,fnlmrw2,t3_g2f49d,1587056187.0,"I think it might mean something similar to the word used in Greek talking about how the angels “long” to look into these things (the Gospel, why Jesus would die for us pasty little mammals).

I’ve never looked at this word in Greek, but I believe it is in line with other similar passages, and what I think it means is not love, in a purely rational sense, the way you could live a spouse, making sense of it as you go. I think it is a commandment to lust for closeness with God, like the angels, to burn with desire to be near Him, to feel is presence (yes, even though it is impossible to understand Him —but we can and do feel Him).

My argument was that the narrative of science v. religion, i.e., one *or* the other, **is false.**

I named at least five world-class scientists, mentioned some other statistics about the scientific community, and briefly mentioned the role that theistic (and specifically Christian) faith played in the lives of the founders of modern science.

The narrative is disproven. 

We are looking for two distinct types of answers, coming from two categories of inquiry. 

One is mechanical (the scientific *how*), the other is about agency (the religious *why*).

People who run the tired routine of “only science” fail to see the bigger picture.

**If I asked you why James’ television is auto-streaming episodes from The Office, you could answer in the narrow, atheistic way; “Well, James used his controller to activate the console, which presented him with a GUI that he navigated until he found the search screen, then he entered letters and searched for The Office...” OR... You could answer; “Well, because James wanted to watch The Office.”**

Both answer are correct. They are different *types* of answer. Different categories. 

That’s not an argument for God’s existence. If you want that, you could start on YouTube; William Lane Craig Arguments for God’s Existence (he’s the double-PhD philosopher that atheist Richard Dawkins was too scared to debate). 

What it is, is an argument against the atheist’s claim that we need only use one part of our inquiring self; the part that seeks answers to the  mechanism of the natural world. 

It is evidence that another category of inquiry, just as valid, exists. The answers are an entirely separate subject."

They were uniformly compelled to investigate the world for order because, as Newton put it, “I expected law in nature because I knew the Lawmaker would put it there.”

Bacon said, “A little scientific study makes a man an atheist, but a deep study of science makes him a Christian.”

Compare that THEISTIC and CHRISTIAN worldview in Europe which is relatively young, to atheist parts of Asia like China, where they never came to the conclusion of expecting order imbued into nature, seeing nature only for what it seemed on the surface; disordered —despite having much more time to do think about it (thousands of years more).

These people like Newton, Galileo, Copernicus, and the like, they were **not** limited in scope at all because of their religious views. They did not switch off their brilliant scientific minds when they studied theology.

**It was the Eastern atheists who lagged behind in science, and it was early Christian and theistic thinkers who first practiced science because their worldview led them to expect law in nature.**

**Many, many people behind a microscope or telescope are Christians, and go to church; Such as Dyson Freeman, the Nobel Prize winning physicist, Francis Collins, the evolutionary biologist who founded the Human Genome Project, John Lennox, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Oxford University, Ian Hutchinson, professor of Nuclear Physics at MIT, and many more —all who have contributed immensely to science, all who are Bible-believing Christians.**

So, yes. A brilliant scientist can often be spotted reading a Bible and praying to God, what these esteemed Reddit scholars derisively call, in their wisdom, “an invisible sky-daddy.” 

These same people who are steeped like a tea bag in atheist subreddits and Rick & Morty-level one-line soundbite philosophy. So of course they won’t listen.

Sorry, but 67.5% of Nobel Laureates in the Natural Sciences are Christian. 

In fact, just in China, the scientific community has a higher rate of theists than the regular population. 

People love to laugh at the 3-6% of Christians who are anti-evolution, flat-earther noobs. Well, that’s just bias, statistically speaking.

The truly smart people aren’t purely religious or purely naturalistic. They are a mixture of both. 

If we try to explain the world, i.e., the natural order of things in the way we would explain a car, here’s how the question would be answered by atheists and Christians/theists:

**“Explain the existence and functioning of this Ford T-Bird.”**

**Atheist: “Well, you have the chassis and the tires and the combustion engine...”**

**Theist/Christian who is also a scientist/mathematician/educated:**

**”Well, sure, you have all that. And one more critical component to explain the Ford T-Bird... HENRY FORD.”**

The philosopher will tell you that these are TWO TYPES of questions SEEKING TWO TYPES OF ANSWERS; the mechanical question, and the question of agency.

Atheist meme-makers, stop trying so hard to establish a false-dichotomy; it isn’t one OR the other, nature OR God.

It’s BOTH/AND,

It always has been (which is why the founders of science like Newton said things like “I’ve written more about God than about math”) ... and the fact that so, so many world-class scientists are Christians/theists in today’s day and age only corroborates this.

Eugene,fnamcoh,t1_fnajwb4,1586799985.0,"Thanks for not cursing at me.

Mega-churches are a profoundly and irredeemably anti-Christian concept. This is as close to historical fact as anyone is going to get. 
For the first 120 years that the early church existed, there did not exist a single church building. Every gathering of followers took place in the followers’ homes, following a circuit. 

The only exception to this would be group worship in nature (rare and dangerous) and group worship at the precipice of martyrdom in places like the colosseum. 

Churches are a Western idea. Mega-Churches are purely American (in origin) and profoundly and lastingly destructive to the public’s view of Christianity, and to Christian life in general.

I very nearly quake with rage at prosperity-gospel pushers.

But...

This post was against the guy who said in no uncertain terms that he somehow knew Eugene and Springfield pastors were conning people, as an absolute whole, as a unified collective. This is a caustic lie meant to harm and defame. 

I can see where you thought I meant every church, everywhere. As a blanket statement, yes, that’d be patently false.

Sorry I didn’t clarify."

Eugene,fnaj5tv,t1_fnadmkx,1586798418.0,"Do you think all philosophers are so deliberate at all times, in every capacity of life? When I watch The Simpsons and Rick and Morty with my colleague, we don’t have a pissing contest. We say and we do silly and philosophically indefensible things. 

Misconceptions abound in your mind. 

Regarding my “point” —which is not a thesis and which I won’t defend as such; it has already been stated. Here it is again: “Pastors are wrong for gathering their congregations right now, but the claim that they are doing this in order to acquire funds that are going to be misappropriated and spent on [jet skis and private jets] is false, caustic and malevolent.” 

You’ve written about my educational background. You’ve written about the foolishness of people gathering right now.
You’ve chattered quite a lot, Gurthy.

It’s a simple little claim I’ve made.

As for your skepticism... to paraphrase Russel... I just don’t have a reply to a skeptical gaze. Not my concern.

Finally, did you feel I was condescending? I have been immensely so. And rightfully. You Reddit phil wannabes have been absolutely brutish, flinging about insults and curses, then you ask why we aren’t having a purely academic discourse? How lopsided and convenient a view to hold. I won’t curse at any of you, nor employ curses in my responses because to do so is without exception intellectually lazy, but I will be as condescending as I please.

And please, I do. 

Ciao

Don’t you have some “friends in low places” to hang out with?"
Eugene,fnadtcn,t1_fnacmgx,1586795753.0,"I will say this again; I don’t condone gathering. I posted this because there was a guy on here who was saying these pastors are intentionally and malevolently endangering people not because of some confused beliefs, but because they want to scam people out of money so they can buy more jet skis and private jets —which is a contemptible lie. Then the post vanished and I wanted to make sure they saw this. Not about gathering. About the claims on intentional misappropriation of funds.
That’s why this was posted. To combat that person’s ridiculous and horrible allegations. Not condone gathering. Got it?"

First half of your reply just now was spot on. I wasn’t even sure what I was replying to! So, yes, basically. My initial post was a huffy-puffy thing to the person who was insulting me. Then some ‘philosophers’ started badgering me (okay, maybe I earned it for posting without structuring my thoughts), but now I’m being grilled by three people over the proper use of a term I learned years ago? Reddit is ruthless, hahaha 😂 and I’m somewhat proud of the younger wave. 

This is my first gold... and it’s under such a tragic light...

But, to the point about pseudo... no. Stop while you’re ahead, friend."
