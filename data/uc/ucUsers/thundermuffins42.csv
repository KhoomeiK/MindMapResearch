Presumably to attend this school you signed a document which included campus fees in your charges to enroll. Unless that document stipulates you are not required to pay campus fees in the event you do not enter campus for an entire quarter (I'll bet you it doesn't say anything like this), this suit doesn't hold any water."

I'm sure that when he speaks about opening schools earlier in the summer, he is talking about k-12 but has in mind the California public university system. Expect to hear more about this over the next month or two.

There are rumors of graduate and staff research being phased back in starting early May. As early as next week,in some limited capacity, researchers are perhaps going to be allowed back into labs to do their research. However I imagine it will be a highly regulated, staggered schedule, and will only apply to science hill labs where in-person lab work is necessary to produce results. Given that the MCD-led testing team is starting up work on May 1st, I imagine there will be some way to test graduates, post-docs, faculty, and staff who wish to return to work on campus. I very much doubt this applies to undergraduates or people who do not need to be on campus to do their work (e.g. the majority of non-stem grad students). 

As for fall quarter, I would bet on a mixed remote and in-person approach to classes. Small labs will likely be brought back for in-person teaching, since it is unreasonable to completely cut them from a degree program (as one would have to do for students who could not take the labs for a year or more). Perhaps 20 person classes will also be held this way. That depends on the state of the outbreak come July. However large classes (like more than 100 people) I bet will be held online. That way, large lecture halls can be utilized to hold smaller classes consistent with social distancing. That's just my guess though."

My advice to you is to abandon this way of looking at the situation, especially for grad school. There are good schools and bad schools; it should be easy enough to tell them apart. Bad schools have disparate research programs and little collaboration between departments or with nearby schools. Good schools have a history of successful collaboration and the resources to support their graduate students financially and in terms of career development.

Since you're a freshman, don't worry about all this. Focus on finding something you like to do and foster relationships with people in your major and your professors. Eventually if you actually want to go to grad school and your faculty adviser thinks it's a good idea, talk to them about which grad schools they think you'd fit into. Don't set your sights on any school in particular."

>How is the history department at this school?

The strikers have a website where you can see all the pledges that have been made. You can find, for example, a pledge not to accept TA positions from 19 of the grad students in the history department  [https://payusmoreucsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/History-pledge.pdf](https://payusmoreucsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/History-pledge.pdf)

Now I don't know how serious these 19 grads were about this. There are far more important things going on than the strike right now, and frankly I haven't heard squat this quarter about departments outside of PBSci or BSOE. If someone knows why that may be they can reply to this so you can read it. You should be aware though that if these people are serious about the strike then it's very likely your courses in the history department and related social studies/humanities departments will be affected (difficult enrollment, not enough TAs or graders, cancelled classes, etc).

I don't actually know anything about the UCSC History department, but I do know that they're far more impacted by the strike than any department I have contacts with.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should also add that some idiot (a striker themselves) actually shared a complete list of the 80 or so grads who withheld grades and were ultimately dismissed. I think at least two of these were History grads, so the pledge was not a passive one (like some in PBSci pledged not to fill roles for fired TAs in other departments, even though these grads would never be offered those positions in the first place)."

I'm not sure I understand your hesitance to sign a lease. I signed a lease on this place (over a year ago, now I'm on month to month) and I live alone. As for the shelter in place order, it's likely to be lifted in California, at least partially, by June. Governor Newsom has began to detail his plans to transition out of the lockdown mode we're in now, but the timeline is very fluid. You should do everything you can to stay up to date with that and use it to inform your search for housing. Sorry I can't offer anything more specific. This is important though because even with the current order I think landlords here are going to want to sign a lease with someone who can be there and move in the week that the space becomes available. Perhaps even the day or next day after it becomes available. Keep that in mind."
UCSC,fnj2mhe,t3_g1nxj1,1586990802.0,"Don't bet on grad student housing. Do your research and come out here to look at places and talk to landlords over the summer. The earlier the better.

I'm paying just over $1300 for a one bedroom on the west side right now.

And from what I can tell, you're the one being presumptive. Not only that experts will flock to your side because you bought a box of chemicals from china, but also that you'll be able to learn anything more meaningful from this than the actual medical professionals are learning every day on the front lines of this crisis.

I assume your homework was due sometime late Sunday, maybe midnight. This is the problem with having homework due on the weekends: I don't want to work weekends and you (undergrads taking non-major courses) don't want to do your homework until the last minute.

Some unsolicited advice: students that use chegg to do their homework for the whole quarter tend to do pretty poorly on exams. As a TA I'd rather you turn in incomplete homework than something which was obviously copied from the internet. At least then you know where you need to direct your study effort the most."

I know of a couple cases where professors have secretly extended the deadline by an hour so as to avoid the problem you're describing. It's totally reasonable for you to finish it on paper in 90 minutes, but if for whatever reason you can't convert it to a pdf and upload in exactly 5 minutes, you might have a hidden buffer.

Don't assume your class is implementing this strategy, and be vigilant. If you can't hit that 5 minute mark for whatever reason, do your best to make sure there's some form of receipt that you did the work and tried to submit (maybe through email) by a particular time.

EDIT: I should mention that the submission time is still recorded. If it's obvious that you took an extra hour to do it you might be marked down for turning it in late anyway. This is something that should be outlined in a syllabus (if it isn't, request it. This should be standard for online courses)"
