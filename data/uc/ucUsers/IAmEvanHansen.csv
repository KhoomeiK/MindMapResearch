From their email on MArch 23rd: "" With regards to Zot Bucks, as mentioned, they do not expire, even after you graduate. These Bucks are linked to your Student ID number and that number will always stay with you, does not terminate. As long as you keep or have your Student ID card at the time of redemption, you can use them at any time in any location that takes them."""
