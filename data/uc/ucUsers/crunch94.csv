Surface,fpbtmth,t1_fpbs8i6,1588478415.0,"Oh that's a very old flair. That's back 3 years ago with the original SB. I currently have a 15"" MBP but I'm selling it to save some money and was thinking about getting that Surface Laptop. I would end up with some extra 400-500. I'll lose some processing power and def the gpu. But I gain portability and extra cash and well I have a pc."
UCSD,fpbste4,t1_fpbjd1m,1588477831.0,"See, this the type of shit that makes my blood boil. It's also a reminder of the privilege I have by being a white mexican. I basically look Irish even tho I was born and raised in Mexico. I mean my name is Juan and you can notice an accent for sure. However, I've never had to experience something like that because I just don't look Mexican/Latinx. I'm so sorry you had to go through that and while it would've been cool to meet you on campus I wish you nothing but the best. Those both schools are amazing and you should be proud to have been accepted to the top 3 UCs. My girlfriend and friends went to Berkeley so I am biased towards it. You don't have an easy decision to make but it sure is a great one!"

unpopularopinion,fp7rn7i,t3_gbn6xu,1588376373.0,Isn't classifying the nerdy bullied kid as the type of kid who does school shooting inaccurate? I remember reading that most are not bullied but the bullies. Like it's a misconception that the bullied is the one who shoots up the schools.

apple,fp34hjf,t1_fp32xyg,1588272933.0,I've had the s20+ since release. I really like it tbh. Having the freedom to set my own default apps and having a real firefox browser is pretty awesome. Performance has been great. It's just that I've had a lot of apps on iPhone that I was used to. I also still have a mac and ipad so I basically broke the ecosystem haha

PickAnAndroidForMe,fov7jvb,t1_fov61xu,1588096661.0,"Yeah, I was thinking about asking for maybe $550 and the G8, bringing the overall price of my s20+ around 800-850. But the 60hz is gonna be hard to go back."

PS4,fo3y38g,t3_g467sl,1587494908.0,"It seems like they just updated the Arctis 1 Wireless with better drivers, maybe it's more comfortable now? I just ordered [these ones](https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-1-wireless-xbox-cyberpunk-edition-johnny-silverhand) cause they work wireless with all consoles and pc too. The previous version did not work with xbox, so that's why I think they might change a bit."
xboxone,fo3x7n1,t1_fo2rlp8,1587494474.0,"Plus, I'm far from my entertainment stand. I want wireless comfortable headset. The audio jack on the ps4/xbox controller usually is not that good. In my case it keeps skipping. When I saw this works with all of them I immediately bought them."
nintendo,fnult6v,t3_g3ptch,1587265175.0,"Flew to New Jersey before the intense lockdown to be with my girlfriend. It's been years of long distance so it was nee to be together for so long. First month was kinda rough and I was having doubts, she noticed and we talked. After that we've been pretty fucking good. Haven't had a fight in days. I don't know what's going to happen, but I relearned how important communication and support is. Hope y'all end up with a better relationship with whomever you're stuck in quarantine with."
apple,fnl663y,t1_fnklpv2,1587047754.0,"Besides the screen, how is it not on par? A13 blows away even the 865. You can get this for 399 and know it will be supported for the next 5 years. On the other hand my s20+ will be supported for two years."

newjersey,fncli5a,t1_fncit57,1586839835.0,Haha nice. I mean now that I think about it San Diego County has a town named San Diego.
worldnews,fmx2ul3,t1_fmwx3mh,1586457475.0,That's what I thought. I have a friend who keeps saying that recommending weight loss is fat shaming and I don't get it. Been fat for most of my life but I was at a healthy weight for like 3 years before going up again. Being fat is a pain in the ass. Fat shaming has to be eliminated cause it really causes mental issues but let's not act like obesity does not lead to health issues.
worldnews,fmwvoq7,t3_fxrbel,1586453860.0,"What exactly classify as obesity? Just being fat makes more at risk? Or is it being fat and not being active? Because I want to think that some athletes like Daniel Cormier, who is fat but is always training for hours would not have the same risk. Does anybody know?"
