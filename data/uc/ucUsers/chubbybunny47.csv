To some people, who terminate because it’s not the right time/can’t afford a baby/many other reasons outside of their direct control do feel a sort of loss. Many might still grieve a bit or feel guilt. She might have some real unresolved shit about this. You need to have a come to Jesus talk with her about what her motivations are behind this, but please don’t out her like that on Facebook."
AmItheAsshole,fpj99ei,t3_gdjzmr,1588660507.0,"NTA. If he didn’t think his actions were worth an apology, then he should stand by them. Why is he embarrassed or having to do “damage control” of he wasn’t even willing to admit to you his actions were wrong? You can’t have it both ways, James!"
AmItheAsshole,fpj80pc,t3_gdkm7x,1588659373.0,"NTA. If she wants silence on the other side of her wall, she shouldn’t live in an apartment. Personally, I think it was overstepping to make that request, if she has an issue with it, SHE can move her bedroom into the other room. You pay for your apartment, you can sleep where you please."
AmItheAsshole,fpj7vu3,t3_gdn33m,1588659249.0,"NAH. Get your kids into counseling. Transitioning, while obviously a personal experience, still massively impacts the family both between family members and obviously in school as well. Your son is dealing with bullying as well as possibly (very normally) grieving the loss of the brother he thought he had. It’s a tough transition for everyone. He needs counseling to develop better coping skills than hurting his sister and he needs and outlet to discuss his feelings with someone outside of the family. Good luck"

people can be weird about what wedding traditions they hold near and dear, but not wearing white to a wedding, much less a WEDDING DRESS, is pretty universal, at least in the US. She knows that and is being a total dick."

Pregnancy is a wild journey of hormones and stress. It’s also a total identity shift for many women. To go not just from feeling like your own person to being a “mother” but to also have to change your entire idea of what your body looks like is unimaginably hard for many people. 

I think you were harsher than needed. Leave this up to the doctor. You need to be her supporter right now, not her policer. Let the doctor tell her she’s not gaining enough weight and then sit with her and ask her how to support her in eating more. 


Additionally, speaking personally as someone with a disordered eating issue with calorie restriction, eating larger amounts of food at once might be hard. More small meals might help. Let her lead the way with what she needs for a healthy pregnancy."
AmItheAsshole,fpidvw8,t3_gd7mae,1588638891.0,"NTA. His other issues aside, if you talk about a topic you’re CLEARLY interested in it. Why wouldn’t he want to hear from an expert about a topic he’s interested in? And if he knows so much, why didn’t he recognize her? Its human to make mistakes so if he’s going to freak out that much over a correction, that’s on him to own,not you."
AmItheAsshole,fpidksl,t3_gdgy3x,1588638711.0,NTA. You can do whatever you want with a gift. This if anything just proves how right you are that she bought it for herself!

Honestly, I do think your comment was an incredibly low blow. But when someone says something that fucked up to someone who miscarried, the gloves come off. I’m sorry about your baby, and that she said something so terrible."

It sounds like he took your practical solution as some sort of symbolic “fuck you”. Either way it doesn’t matter, you’ve asked him numerous times so it’s understandable you’re now looking for other solutions besides his own stream control/ability to wipe up after himself."

This sounds like it may be an unpopular opinion, but I don’t think it’s your responsibility to tell your mom. Yes, she should know, but you should not be the one to take that on. I think your stepdad should have to tell her. 

Overall though, this is above Reddit’s pay grade. This is some serious shit my friend. A lot of counseling centers are doing virtual therapy and may have some more openings right now. Is that an option for you, to get into therapy? Because even though you’re in quarantine it is still likely available. 

See if you can set up therapy and I would start arranging to quarantine somewhere else. You are obviously a part of this and love those involved, but this situation was not your making and you are not required to solve it. This was your stepdads making. Your brother was a child and yes, he was groomed. Also not to be rude, but shame on people for saying your mom will be upset with you if she finds out you knew. Your mom will be upset all around, but she loves you and as she heals she will know HOW TF WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU FOUND THIS OUT? There is no script for this. This is not a normal situation. 

Find a way to get yourself, and maybe your mom and brother out of there. Shame on your stepfather. I’m so sorry this is going on; I can only imagine the deeply confusing feelings you’re probably having on ALL fronts."
AskReddit,fp47xsk,t3_gb33ag,1588293490.0,"I would maybe say time travelers wife. Maybe it’s because I love Rachel mccadams, but maybe also because I sob like a baby when I watch the movie and I don’t feel like I do when I read the book. Only read it once though!"
UCSantaBarbara,fox5w4t,t1_fowfg0r,1588134848.0,"You have to pay a lot more people for running an in person orientation. There are costs to have staff running presentation rooms, you pay for all the media, and to use spaces. I’m not sure what the confusion is, but I imagine the price difference is because it’s less costly to do it online so they don’t have to charge you as much...?"
AskReddit,foop9jb,t1_fonapwe,1587943583.0,"This one is so crazy and heartbreaking to me. I’ve hiked that trail many times, it’s so popular in that area. The fact that it took so long for someone to find them really shook me up! I guess hiking at night definitely impacted that some, but still."
pettyrevenge,fnt6ob0,t1_fnsplal,1587235649.0,Why on earth does it keep saying “Rebbiting”?
explainlikeimfive,fngcpfd,t1_fngc2ce,1586928282.0,"They’re explaining it anecdotally but it’s not. Receptors that sense pressure are thicker and myelinated, whereas ones that sense pain are thinner and unmyelinated. Messages travel faster from pressure receptors and reach the brain first. It’s also why you have a urge to rub your elbow after you’ve bumped it on a table or something."
relationships,fngc1s8,t3_g1gj2a,1586927744.0,"One thing I want to add (you’ve gotten a lot of good advice here) is to definitely think about your husbands language when he is sober and if it is as misogynistic as it is now. I’m staunchly feminist and generally would be against anyone talking about another person that way, but I’m also a mental health professional. I feel like it should be considered that your husband may have really compartmentalized this event and hasn’t processed it at all, and therefore when admitting to it drunk his 16 year old mentality came out. A lot of us were shits back then.  I’m not saying you should necessarily stay (or go), but I thought I’d bring this perspective to possibly ease your shock over how different he sounded when he told you."
TwoXChromosomes,fmuf3u8,t3_fx6vtm,1586390164.0,RIP. This movement has made such a massive difference in my life and allowed me to sleep better and calm my anxiety without terrible side effects. What a difference her young life made.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fmjn9bq,t1_fmjmtud,1586133755.0,"Agreed. It’s also often packed in other things, which change the flavor. I pre-mince my garlic and keep it in the fridge. It’s easy to do in bulk in a good process and still tastes much better than mince you buy at the grocery store"
