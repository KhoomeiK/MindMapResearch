UCSD,fpcgrna,t3_gcghg8,1588500049.0,So you transferred in to sd as sophomore and transfer out as senior? How can you do this? I thought people are only allowed to transfer as junior or below.
TransferStudents,fp4s5ej,t3_gb3947,1588306022.0,Work harder and carefully choose professor?
TransferStudents,fp0xwly,t1_fp0xj10,1588219428.0,Mb. Cuz I have searched for UCSB and UCI about the tag.
TransferStudents,fp0wtaa,t3_gaoc4y,1588218703.0,I don’t believe there is cs major in tag for UCs
MtSAC,foxrihp,t3_ga3iz3,1588153752.0,Do we have?
MtSAC,fov5pbv,t3_g9qaim,1588095804.0,Send email again. Math department’s chairman is pretty chill and he cleared my prerequisite very quick.
TransferStudents,fottj63,t3_g9jr8g,1588065596.0,"Which classes did u take? especially for physics and cs

I am super nervous about getting rejected with a high gpa."
MtSAC,fotj1kd,t1_fote9j3,1588055438.0,But math class still shows the meeting time. I am afraid that will be same time.
MtSAC,fospyh2,t3_g9cdik,1588035639.0,It only applies to 2020 fall transfer?
MtSAC,fosdrf7,t1_formtto,1588028724.0,LOL
TransferStudents,folys22,t3_g87jyg,1587873766.0,Bothering gpa when u already got into the school you want?
MtSAC,fof1ico,t1_foem8ie,1587722578.0,Do have the transfer admission to other schools?
MtSAC,foe7zza,t1_fodezcu,1587697889.0,Gpa?
MtSAC,focktx2,t1_focjfwv,1587672514.0,Professor Chevalier is pretty chill and easy. Her criteria is ez to follow too.
MtSAC,fo9uxx8,t3_g6h1i2,1587632078.0,May 9 as a sophomore and have taken 19 before this spring. I think it depends on how many units u have before this spring.
MtSAC,fo9gllq,t3_g6fpgx,1587618951.0,Finally. Does anything change?
MtSAC,fo9251s,t3_g6elej,1587608834.0,Yes it need all letter grade for most schools
TransferStudents,fo8a0uc,t1_fo6btxv,1587592618.0,So you have taken 60units before this spring? And around 70 units after spring? A lot of people missed one or two major requirements then got rejected especially for stem majors.
TransferStudents,fo6anl6,t3_g5yes6,1587552787.0,How many class u have taken so far?
TransferStudents,fo60fni,t1_fo5ki3a,1587541886.0,Did she tell you why?
TransferStudents,fo5lqzr,t1_fo49h3a,1587528810.0,"What is your cc? It seems you do not finish all the “additional” requirements classes, which might lead you to lose some points in the eye of admission office. For the other schools (UCB, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB), their requirements are nearly impossible to finish all in two years. For instance, you do not take 3 physics courses, which is required to the school I listed.

The maximum transfer units is 70, but you can waive the prerequisite for most of classes you took in cc are the lower division classes.

Sometimes, counselor might not be 100% correct, so the best shot is taking all the classes shown on the agreement when CS major is really competitive. Try to apply other schools, you are still a competitive applicant."
TransferStudents,fo5j22a,t1_fo4k13y,1587526853.0,"Why? If u visit assist.org, there can see which class is equal to UCSC’s."
TransferStudents,fo47dhe,t3_g5lkw1,1587499456.0,"I think the biggest reason of getting rejected is u do not finish all of the major requirements. Can I see what classes you take? Because 66units is way less than a normal cs major transfer applicant, most of people have over 75 units to fulfill the major requirements."
TransferStudents,fo4613x,t3_g5jsn2,1587498796.0,Why not UCSC?
TransferStudents,fnv83al,t3_g3xdgq,1587283514.0,How many units you have taken? Because it is so hard to fulfill the 15units honor classes when there are A LOT of requirements for CS major. I am planning to take most of GE in intersession and none of them open honor classes in intersession. I am taking around 18-21 units per semester so it seems I have no chance to get an honor on transcript. Is it affect a lot for applying Cal and UCLA ?
TransferStudents,fnv7ehk,t3_g3xot3,1587282818.0,What is your gpa?
MtSAC,fnrhyya,t3_g3ercx,1587189520.0,Me too. I just send an email to financial aid office.
MtSAC,fnmgxnt,t3_g2lwzw,1587071228.0,I have no idea why mtsac does this.
IWantOut,fnggusx,t3_g1i9ov,1586931809.0,"Taiwan might be a good place for you.

1. Very friendly to gay. Just pass the gay marriage law.

2. Higher education in low cost. Nearly every Taiwanese have a college degree. As a Taiwanese, I come to States for college degree with dual citizenship and the dream of becoming software engineer in Silicon Valley. But I have to say higher education in Taiwan is really good if you can catch up. If you do not have taken any ap classes in high school, you have little chance to catch up the Taiwan high school graduates. 

3. Health care is becoming bankrupt but still way more better than others."
TransferStudents,fnd1buq,t3_g0tj80,1586854830.0,My schedule is done 82 units in 2 years to fulfill the igetc and cs requirements. I’ve posted my schedule in this subreddit ( some changed but roughly same). It is do able but very few people do it. It is not easy to maintain gpa in high-level stem classes(compared to ge class). Some professors are coming cc to destroy ur gpa. My cal1 dropped out 2/3 and no one got A. Be careful to choose when there are so many professors teachings same courses in cc.
TransferStudents,fnd0gvx,t1_fncb0no,1586853868.0,"Hey! I found you are in mtsac too. How many classes you have took in CS? Because some UCs need to take both csci140/145 (programming in cpp and java) for requirements. But UCLA strongly recommend to take csci190 which cannot fit in my schedule if I took both csci140/145. Btw, do u take honor classes?"
MtSAC,fn15wiq,t1_fn0j9yh,1586555422.0,Source?
MtSAC,fmy20z5,t1_fmxms72,1586476449.0,"Thx! But I mean the some class did not open in past, I am wondering that would be change or not."
TransferStudents,fmvj1mm,t3_fxlzj3,1586418749.0,"I was in the same boat. You can check my post in this subreddit. Just take a B, and use that as a drive. Tbh, I am still hating the professor who let everyone get B or under B. It really destroys everyone’s gpa. After that shit, I realize that why people always use ratemyprofessor."
PublicFreakout,fmtrdhv,t1_fms3pnb,1586377683.0,She must be an idea and possibly be a low key racist. She is the one not suitable for being a teacher.
TransferStudents,fmrofl7,t1_fmrnks2,1586329694.0,"Rly? I am planning to take 85 units for cs major in two years in a semester school. That could include igetc and every required courses and some recommended courses. But in this intensive schedule, I need to give up the honor program which can guarantee me into some UCs in not impact major."
MtSAC,fmptpud,t3_fwqlqa,1586287161.0,2/3of semester but some professor said u can even drop in the last day
