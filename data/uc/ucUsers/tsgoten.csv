berkeley,fpjzgo7,t1_fpifl0n,1588684800.0,That’s good to know. thank you!
berkeley,fpj73qn,t1_fpiotqb,1588658548.0,I mean I haven’t caught up with them since the winter. But to be fair they were all freshman and fair enough for it being difficult to get AI/ML research then. I’ll ask next time we talk what their perspectives are now.
berkeley,fpiogoy,t1_fpicb6o,1588645207.0,"I'm friends with 5 current sophomores in SCS and their experience hasn't really said that it's significantly easier to get meaningful research there. Also people keep bringing up more opportunities per students, but man I have seen more of my friends at Cal land top internships after freshman year than they did after their freshman year."
Showerthoughts,fpinyq8,t1_fpibqc6,1588644897.0,I cannot go through this again. No it wont.
Showerthoughts,fpinx2h,t1_fpi5zap,1588644868.0,Agreed!
Showerthoughts,fpi5f3k,t1_fpi4v40,1588634017.0,"I agree. To answer the last point, the advice that is on average the best is the one that’s right. On average and for most cases being truthful and moral is better than lying and cheating. OP’s statement is a blanket “lying gets you ahead” which is false. But that’s not even my issue with it, it’s what are you defining as being the “reward”, money? Sure it can get you more money, but that clearly not what it’s all about."
Showerthoughts,fpi2jf4,t1_fphfhh5,1588632398.0,"Define ahead and rewarding? Say If you’re an engineering student cheating through classes, there’s very real costs in the long term with respect to your knowledge, and ability. Not to mention the possible errors that can lead to career ending disasters."
berkeley,fpi1did,t3_gdip7k,1588631749.0,I am doing the same thing and feel conflicted. My rationale is that some of my classes (61b and math 110) have done a good job of transitioning so why shouldn’t i take it graded. And others haven’t where I need the p/np to compensate for the subpar remote learning. Also my other two classes are much smaller so naturally less resources and ppl to go remote.
berkeley,fphjb78,t1_fphj10x,1588622278.0,"It doesn’t at all! That’s the point, for undergrad AI/ML is probably the same here and at CMU even if they claim to have a whole major dedicated to it."
berkeley,fphgi56,t3_gdghcp,1588620873.0,"Actually a couple of the AI/ML courses at CMU are based on our courses at Berkeley like CS 188 and CS189. I know my friend at CMU also does the Pac-man project that was developed by Berkeley professors for CS 188. 

which is funny cuz CMU like raced MIT to release their AI major."
ApplyingToCollege,fphgayv,t1_fphbubu,1588620773.0,"As a current Berkeley student, can confirm the first part. As per the second part actually a couple of the AI/ML courses at CMU are based on our courses at Berkeley CS 188 and CS189. I know my friend at CMU also does the Pac-man project that was developed by Berkeley professors for CS 188."
berkeley,fph3cpp,t1_fph20mv,1588614239.0,"Thank you for the response! I’m guessing you don’t have the answer to this, but for anyone else who might know will losing access to handshake be a serious downside for SWE internships and other internships for a CS major? Thanks."
Coronavirus,fpfycz1,t1_fpfx2vv,1588588126.0,I agree! but if we’re being pedantic there are a lot of species that eat their children. Some fishes have sex and then kill of their partners when they’re down. Weird shit. But yeah it’s crazy how the money brain just keeps coming back.

berkeley,fpeybv9,t3_gczs94,1588557591.0,"Unpopular opinion but the style is for you, to make it easier to understand your code. In gitlet I have so many methods a lot of time i forget what they do and quick Ctrl + B immediately brings up the java doc. 
Right the javadocs for the methods before you even code the method!

that being said fuck the method line limit and the line length limit. 

EDIT: I meant a quick mouse over but Ctrl + B is stupid useful too."
berkeley,fpexwn0,t1_fpe2pqb,1588557324.0,Yeah i’ve been telling this to incoming frosh. That yeah I work a ton but it’s because there’s just so many damn interesting classes!
berkeley,fpd4lke,t1_fpd29ye,1588519716.0,"It’s very difficult but a few students do choose to do it. And if it doesn’t work out usually you can at least late drop and try again.

berkeley,fpbol6p,t3_gce1zb,1588474861.0,"All the other comments are really great. So to add on to those I’d just like to say during the summer focus on learning “how to read the notes”. If this is your first proof math course it will take a little while to get used to it, but everyone has a slightly different way of reading math text. For some people, myself included, it’s not as simple as just reading through it from start to finish. 
I like to first just read the definitions and some motivation behind them. Then the theorems only focusing on the result and the motivation behind that. Once I have a big picture of what’s going on in the chapter/lecture note do I truly dive into the proofs and examples. 

I mention this because I believe it’s something that took me a couple of math classes to realize so when I took 70 i was well prepared to handle the really dense course notes. Also as a CSM mentor I’ve seen quite a few of my mentees struggle with this and it’s just good to be actively thinking about HOW you’re learning the material."
berkeley,fpbgedo,t1_fp7ydlf,1588469398.0,"I think you should be good without any review. The combination of Math 74 and Math 55 shouldn’t require no or very little linear algebra. Focus more on honing your proof writing skills so if you do wish to review i’d probably just review that. You should be good to go for Math 110 with that background when you take it, since I think proof writing is more important than having a ton of linear algebra background for the course."
berkeley,fp87xgi,t1_fp7b9rx,1588385771.0,Switch Oregon with Utah.
berkeley,fp6xwhk,t1_fp5yyij,1588360513.0,"(1) Yes, the Data Science concentration is the same thing as choosing three clustered data science electives. 

(2) I'd recommend taking Math 74 this Fall. The whole purpose of the course is to help students transition to upper division math. This is the first semester (in a while) it's an official course by the math department, in previous semesters it was a DeCal run by MUSA. I took it when it was a DeCal and it personally helped me a lot. I was also a little nervous about proof based math but the class really did help and ultimately most people are in the same boat. 

(3) I hated my linear algebra class too and in fact I forgot almost everything I learned. I literally didn't know what a span was. That being said I didn't find 110 that bad, and maybe I had to put in a bit more work in the start when most people were able to cruise, but the combination of the textbook, Axler, and help from my professor and GSI I was able to catch up. So don't worry you got this!

berkeley,fp5vbj0,t1_fp5ovoh,1588340706.0,Yeah but if you’re a former student your berkeley.edu email should still give you access to the YT videos.

May I ask why you don’t have confidence in your proof abilities? like was it a specific course/professor? or do you just not like proofs?"

berkeley,fp5r715,t3_gbb4gg,1588337981.0,"Have you VISITED Cornell? I had the same decision last year and I visited Ithaca twice since I live on the East Coast and once by myself. 
Ithaca is actually in buttfuck nowhere and it was kinda cold even in late spring. PM if you want more specifics but i think the area makes a huge difference, the NorCal weather for me has certainly been a huge upgrade. Also i think our CS and Math departments are just way better from my experience and talking to my friends at Cornell."
berkeley,fp5qmn2,t1_fp4zd4y,1588337584.0,"yeah i can see that out of 104, 110 and 70, CS 70 is my favorite math class but it’s definitely difficult."

berkeley,foprk8n,t1_fopbgok,1587969842.0,I can’t comment on summer but i personally needed to spend around 15 hrs a week during the school year to succeed in the class. So i’d guess 20 is the minimum over summer.

berkeley,fnjt4xo,t1_fni29uz,1587006385.0,"Proof based math is essentially a transition from asking problems where you solve for something, to proving something with logical arguments. Math 55 and all the upperdiv math courses at Berkeley I would consider ""proof based"" math courses. 

My first semester I took only 61A and 70 as my graded courses, so I was able to focus on just them and even then it was a challenge. Not insane, but definitely wasn't a cakewalk. For me it wasn't that bad to keep it above a 3.3 since I also had a lot of programming experience so 61A and 61B I would say were ""easy"" courses compared to cs70 and upperdiv math courses. 

One fair warning I would give is that cs70 is most definitely WAY harder and intense than the discrete math course you probably took at your HS. My personal recommendation would be if you don't have math 54 credit, just take EE16A to get used to how math is taught in EECS and then take cs70 with 61B your next semester. 

To check if you have the credit, if you're in-state there's some website you go to but im not sure. If you're out of state check the course equivalency section on the math department's website. Go bears :)"

Ex: no recorded lectures, less available OH, lectures given with a potato camera pointed to a 10ft far away blackboard. Other professors have done an amazing job transitioning to online so why should i pnp the class if I believe the class is a fair metric for my learning (61b and math 110).

Also I’d take CS70 cuz you learn more and if you’re confident in proof writing and plan on taking math 104 and 110 which will build up your proof writing. Why not take CS70 and learn some probability theory while you’re at it.

Yeah the topics are the same they will be the same across almost any CS program in the country. But the level of detail and breadth our courses go into is more. The biggest difference being in CS 70 vs EECS 203 where our intro course covers far more.
In fact the textbook, Rosen, being used for EECS 203 is what Berkeley’s Math 55 uses and everyone at Berkeley knows CS70 covers way more and is far more difficult.
