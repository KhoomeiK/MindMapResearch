TrueAtheism,fnq6hh8,t3_g32iua,1587158601.0,"I used to think about this a lot back when I was still Christian, but the fact is I can't be a happy theist. As a woman, I feel personally attacked by the Bible, as silly and pretentious as that sounds. IMHO the Bible is simply a tool that's been utilized by many different civilizations throughout history to attempt to justify the subjugation of women. I just would not be able to be ignorant of that fact. I suppose there are other religious systems I could look into that don't relegate women to a lesser role in society, but my negative experiences with Christianity make me very skeptical."
