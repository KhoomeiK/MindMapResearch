berkeley,fpmwsvr,t3_geap1f,1588743797.0,Not a hack but make sure you bring some masks to berkeley next fall. Some bus drivers will literally ask people to leave if they don't put on their mask.
berkeley,fpj8ozh,t1_fpj84f5,1588659982.0,"It's common to find a month to month lease, especially outside Berkeley, you can negotiate a month to month one if the landlord doesn't offer it. Forced year long lease is just one of those shits that berkeley landlord pulls because there's so much competition. But I have seen monthly leases in the past if you rent from individuals instead of businesses.

For me, my lease was year long but automatically converted to month to month onced the time is up. So now I can leave whenever I want. If spring doesn't have an online option, I'll look for places over winter break."
berkeley,fpj4jq2,t1_fpj3z3s,1588656402.0,"They told us they'll certainly have an online option. So if you're planning to live outside Berkeley, your plans are solid. The people still waiting are for a potential hybrid option. 

I don't think they'll change mid semester since the whole point is that international students don't have to travel to attend."
berkeley,fpj1czz,t1_fpi9n7h,1588653910.0,Can you elaborate on how the bsc is under capacity? I've been told it always has a long waitlist?
berkeley,fphxetz,t3_gdgtj6,1588629583.0,If its gonna be broadcasted then there's a good chance it would be recorded just like with this semester.
berkeley,fpfv0az,t3_gd7ohs,1588584533.0,No. Unless there're sending TAs to china and europe to proctor.
berkeley,fpfmrap,t3_gd39me,1588576162.0,It's completely your choice to enroll or not. They might loose out internationals and out of states who have to stay at home anyway.
berkeley,fpfmmee,t1_fpet29e,1588576032.0,There will guarantee to be an online option for GBO. You can't guarantee an online option for courses without doing the same for GBO and make international students fly in for only 1 week.
berkeley,fpckyia,t3_gckwl8,1588504436.0,You might miss out on the anxiety of sitting in a lecture hall or a bus and someone cough without covering their face. Happened to many of us early this March.
berkeley,fpcccs7,t1_fpc5p52,1588495232.0,Probably if the class is going to be offered at all there'll be an online option. Some EE classes are working to move their labs online over the summer.
berkeley,fpbw4zy,t3_gckf52,1588480294.0,"Yes. Fall is guaranteed to have av online option. Internationals cat fully attend from their home country, you can do so from home too."
berkeley,fpb794t,t3_gcekaa,1588463599.0,You know for sure there will be an online option.
berkeley,fp8k6dd,t3_gbxozx,1588394462.0,Maybe you hear about cheating more often this semester because of the online thing? They cracked down on proctoring so the university can't get sued. And most classes don't have time to switch to grade bins yet so basically anyone who can cheat and collaborate have very high incentive to do so.
berkeley,fp8htss,t3_gbzt9c,1588392675.0,It is. The question is whether there'll be any in-person option.
berkeley,fp4uru5,t1_fp4sgxb,1588307923.0,Yes. Takes a few days to update for me but after that the tasks dissapears.
berkeley,fp4sdro,t3_gbaji0,1588306178.0,No. I cancelled all my ap tests cuz they'd be useless at berkley. Admission said nothing when I told them.
berkeley,fp4clmt,t3_gb749w,1588296192.0,You can back out of commiting because they gave you false info on your finantial aid package.
berkeley,fp41gps,t1_fp3ae9i,1588289822.0,There's too many people in cs that some upper divs are impossible to get into unless you're Regent or graduating senior.
berkeley,fp0uteg,t3_ganjaj,1588217414.0,Pick where you vibe with most. There's only a small location advantage to foothill since most your lectures will be in dwinelle or wheeler (bigger capacity rooms for lower divs.) I don't think location makes a huge different for cs as you can always watch lectures online.
berkeley,fp0ue4a,t1_fp0ts2a,1588217137.0,Your landlord don't want you deferring either. It could cost them more that it would cost you (there's no way to tell how long covid would last). Hopefully they'd be willing to compromise if you brought up deffering.
berkeley,fp0u6x1,t1_fozratx,1588217006.0,Unless you're cs.
berkeley,fp0tatc,t3_gantbx,1588216441.0,"Tell them you're deffering rent. They can't evict you rn because of the order. Due to covid, you have the right to defer rent untill you can afford payment."
berkeley,fownbi7,t1_fowhim5,1588123188.0,"There is a reason why most models use Korea's data instead of Chinese reported data even though both are ahead of us in timeline. Korea has better testing data due to its smaller population, also better transparancy is a big reason."
berkeley,fow7s51,t3_g9xgq0,1588114591.0,Were some of those units swaps? Swaps don't incur addditional unit on the limit I think.
berkeley,fow7k8g,t1_fow6u9g,1588114475.0,They announced a virtually guaranteed online option for next fall. What they haven't announced yet was whether there will be an in-person option at all.
berkeley,fow5uj8,t3_g9wth5,1588113569.0,"It would be helpfull if some classes restructure to allow for more instant feedback.  Like more frequent but smaller assignments instead of only 3-4 big ones. It's harder to know how well you're doing if you don't get interact much with classmates and course staff.

Also, some classes should move away from curves. It favors cheaters while what we need is to encourage collaboration and supportiveness now that social distancing in the norm."
berkeley,fow4t25,t3_g9wo41,1588113017.0,"Regarding commute, the fall 20 online option means that you won't have to do it for at least a semester. AC transit are pretty safe in my experience even at night.

On campus singles are extremely rare unless you have Regent, work as an RA or are a graduate student"
berkeley,fovw3n9,t1_fovttkf,1588108543.0,The only certain thing is an online option. Whether we'll have any in-person option is still not determined
berkeley,fossbkc,t3_g9bdzy,1588037026.0,Start looking 1-1.5 mo ahead and I'm pretty sure you'll find a decent place for spring. In some cases prices for spring is less competive since there are very few students looking mid-year. Units within the $800s are not uncommon for spring.
berkeley,fosbry0,t3_g9abv9,1588027634.0,"Now is enough ltime for them to find another tenant. If at alternate is found, you won't be liable to pay for the lease."
berkeley,fore679,t3_g8x69l,1588010702.0,"CS is the best major to do online. You pretty much seft-teach your way though your CS  degree even if you live in Berkeley. 99% of the learning is in your own time, coding, reading, watching lectures at 2x, grinding past exams, etc. Piazza is the place to post question, but now that OH and discussions are online you hawe those as well."
berkeley,fooqqfw,t3_g8otf6,1587944455.0,Write to your profs about potential deadline extensions for those two essays? Having parents lose their job and losing your childhood pet should at the very least count as an unexpected emergency.
berkeley,foopbqd,t1_fooeej2,1587943619.0,Don't out of states need minimum 3.4 or something to apply to the UC system?
berkeley,foop85t,t1_foom38o,1587943559.0,2 overlap only applies to upper divs. You can overlap as many lower divs /GEs as you want.
berkeley,foofdlg,t1_fooc9qw,1587937960.0,"Even if the lock down is lifted, CDC social distancing guidelines might be impossible to follow without significant changes to college operations. Schools will need to decide whether these changes & risks are worth it, or they should just stay safe and stick to online. 

Social distancing is not a cure, but a crucial delay to buy time for research and vaccine trials."
berkeley,fooadyw,t3_g8iis0,1587935517.0,"I think the school would be more understanding regarding deferal requests right now. Some of us are in no place to attend school during a pandemic. Either we need to care for elderly, help parents who lost their jobs, or face travel restrictions etc."
berkeley,foo9g5p,t3_g8jx0d,1587935062.0,President of Brown is no public health official. The article didn't even try to seriously address public health concerns.
berkeley,foo8rcy,t3_g8m4n2,1587934705.0,"So many are along the lines of ""we are plannig/intending/hoping/might blah blah blah"", or ""faculty should prepare to teach online but we've not made a decision"", or straigt up ""no decision untill June/July/further notice/when we decide to make a decision""."
berkeley,folywfg,t3_g86aqy,1587873853.0,I just post it on fb free and for sale or craigslist and people will come and pick them up for me. I often list it for a price but if I want it gone within a day or two I'd list it as for free.
berkeley,follm4s,t1_foljvl9,1587864903.0,"I must admit I've never seen a double but I would've guessed that they're at least 1.5-2x a single? My point was that every bit of social distancing helps when we're dealing with something that works on an exponential scale. Insufficient initial response could quickly spiral out of control.

If according to you doubles are so small that you can't have a minimum 6-ft distance most of the time, then the school should not offer them ethically speaking and it is in our best interest not to live in doubles/triples that crammed together."
berkeley,foliqyd,t1_folfqkf,1587863105.0,"At the very least they'd still need to have some empty rooms on reserve, separated from the rest, so that people who tested positive could be isolated from the rest of the group."
berkeley,foli10i,t1_folfw2k,1587862663.0,"You can still feasibly divide space with 2 people. The reason to social distance, *even if you have reason to think you've already been exposed*, is that the virus multiplies exponentially in your body. Hence the higher the initial dose (people coughing directly on you), the faster the virus develop inside you, and the faster it can spread from you to someone else.

Moreover, your body creates anti-body at an exponential rate as well. Thus the lower the initial dose, the higher an advantage your immune system have. You'd recover faster and have less time to spread the virus to other people."
berkeley,folfl41,t3_g84ca4,1587861167.0,"At least for this year, those who moved out early because of online school got refunded for the remainder of the semester."
berkeley,foldebs,t3_g82j4e,1587859848.0,Back when the incomming freshmans got their aid offers. The finan aid office said we'd get ours by 4/24.
berkeley,foigcp4,t3_g7kwb9,1587785997.0,Who knows what kind of virus/wildfire/toilet paper shortage and what not would be bestowed uppon us in 2046.
berkeley,foifx6l,t3_g7jyvg,1587785707.0,"I looked around June last year and some of my offers were month-to-month leases. I'd say negotiate with your landlord if they don't offer it up front. A lease in a two party agreement, landlords are also more willing to negotiote if you stay for fall right now since many of us will be taking the remote option and not renting."
berkeley,foif3za,t1_foico9p,1587785184.0,This highly depends on your major. I don't know how you'd attend orchestra or PE online but for CS classes over 50% never showed up untill the final since our classes are 800+ and webcasted.
berkeley,foiey4i,t3_g7ll8w,1587785077.0,Yes you can stay in LA. The whole point of an online option is that internationals students might face travel restrictions to attend or return home afterwards. They want to make it so that you can fully attend class even if you are not able to travel to berkeley.
berkeley,fohnajw,t3_g7hj2o,1587768871.0,"You're looking for summer or fall? You don't apply to the appartment directly but through the bsc system. It's usually hard to get offered an appartment during fall. On the other hand, if you have documented allergies, I'm pretty sure they can accomodate you."
berkeley,fohmv5j,t1_fohitir,1587768635.0,Or some minimum wage employee paid to shill for him on social media. Comcast does this sort of things all the time.
berkeley,fohd45r,t3_g7gxg1,1587763956.0,"They'll give us notice months in advance, like with summer and fall (at least whether we can choose to take completely online). You'll have ample time to look for a place if they announce no online option for spring."
berkeley,foe250a,t1_fodcu4x,1587694544.0,They released an email saying that an online option is guaranteed.
berkeley,fodmw2a,t3_g6xhyh,1587686667.0,When are they doing this? That't 6 floor taller than Evans.
berkeley,fodmm15,t1_fodimhd,1587686562.0,True. I wish human can live without food and toilet paper. We'd have a true lock down then.
berkeley,fod65cs,t3_g6vwfe,1587680555.0,"I believe any withdraw request this semester is instant, and they automatically re-admit you afterwards due to covid."
berkeley,fod5p5b,t3_g6vwbk,1587680320.0,Funny thing when people say berkeley is a ghost town except whenever you need to go to Trader Joe's the line is like 1+ hr and we ran out of toilet paper everywhere.
berkeley,fod1jqs,t3_g6ulvf,1587678713.0,Probably you have the option to apply for spring regardless? Seems likely that many people won't be paying for dorms in the fall if they can just take classes remotely.
berkeley,focn3pz,t3_g6rl74,1587673322.0,We are guaranteed an online option given the email announcement.
berkeley,focl19g,t1_focj2ao,1587672585.0,"Hopefully there are other ways of evaluation that doesn't favor cheaters. For instance more weight on assignments/projects, etc. where we already have ways to detect copying. Some summer classes are also experimenting with this I think. Also, humanities could always give open-ended essays questions and check for plagarism like they alsways do."
berkeley,focjyp8,t1_foc8gqm,1587672217.0,"Yeah, the possibility of a second wave is very real, especially if we have a ton of students fly in from other cities + increase daily public transport. This is a reason behind their uncertain tone ""we're still waiting for public health etc, but for now we guarantee an online option""."
berkeley,fociqrg,t1_foc5oso,1587671800.0,It makes me even more reluctant to attend the in-person or at all. This is comming off as: in-person option = half effort to keep up appearance and retain tuition.
berkeley,foch73i,t1_foc4pwe,1587671292.0,I'll be the first student in the history of UCB to attend frow Hawaii.
berkeley,focgwjz,t1_focch3s,1587671195.0,"Exam format are likely up to instructor but I think everyone will take the same exam and in-person attendees would be treated the same as online attendees, since there's no way to do the reverse."
berkeley,foauq8b,t1_fo9jyeh,1587652801.0,Not all landlord require year long lease. Even in berkeley quite a few leases I saw when touring were month to month.
berkeley,fo9b0n7,t3_g6d1z7,1587614767.0,"I'd either go on campus since they give full refund when classes are online, or any lease with a covid provision. Don't sign any lease that you might not be able to afford latter."
berkeley,fo8vjq2,t3_g6dhq9,1587604732.0,"I like the idea but would rather save money and rent a cheap location, ideally with more space for an office-like setup. Also like the idea of exploring a new town."
berkeley,fo8bmfp,t3_g6949t,1587593472.0,"They're not allowed to force you to tell them. The school now hides who's taking pnp vs graded for a reason. The ""requiring"" part is a bluff, you can not respond or lie and change your mind latter and they can't do anything about it."
berkeley,fo5n7c2,t1_fo4trod,1587529933.0,Why attend zoom with a fake beach background when you could get a legit 100% natural beach background.
berkeley,fo4pxl0,t1_fo4o982,1587508957.0,"You assume that the UC is *doing the local community a favor* by recalling 40k students, a large chunk international and out of state, cramming them in tighly packed in-person lectures amist a pandemic."
berkeley,fo4ovwu,t3_g5p4ds,1587508379.0,Rent your own place? 18 is enough to move out and secure a lease for most of us. I'm planning to do this as well but will rent a cheaper remote place in the fall if classes are online.
berkeley,fo4molh,t1_fo4f2rs,1587507213.0,"Corona virus doesn't care about local economy or any of that. If you have a population of 40k students tightly packed in lecture halls every day, you're going to be the next epicenter. 

If they have no social distancing, online recordings and alternate exam accomodations for sick students, I'm going to withdraw next fall if they make us choose health vs grade."
berkeley,fo4689z,t1_fo40vb0,1587498893.0,Oral exams!
berkeley,fo3y98o,t1_fo3wqd5,1587494991.0,"Yeah. Earlier cs classes like 61a,c started to remove their attendance policy and have two midterm clobbers so that sick students are not left to fend for themselves. The school should enforce this on a large scale and accomodate recordings/alternate exams for sick students in order for in-person fall to work."
berkeley,fo3dc63,t3_g5hfez,1587484953.0,"Even if classes are back on campus, there will be social distancing measures, gathering limits, and probably still webcast/suspend mandatory attendance for sick people not to come. If you attend fall in-person, stay at home when you're sick."

berkeley,fn611pj,t3_fzse1d,1586683253.0,Yeah I get neighbor's dog/baby noise randomly. My advice is to always mute yourself unless you have questions. I find that turning off your webcam also help with internet speed unless your profs require it.
