poker,fnv0lqo,t1_fnuxyxq,1587276419.0,"My analysis: The difference is I have showdown value with my top pair top kicker and so getting one caller is still profitable, whereas it loses money with the flush draw.     

Another difference is that while still unpleasant, it is much easier to call a check raise with TPTK due to SDV as we have a bluff catcher and villain is more likely to be bluffing with a flush draw as we no longer block it.     

Yet another difference is that our TPTK has mostly stable SDV and is unlikely to improve on later streets so it's not too bad if circumstances force us to let it go, but with the draw it is very bad if we bet/fold when we were drawing to the nuts.      

 It's bad if we get one caller with the draw and very bad if we get check raised, whereas with TPTK its fine to get one caller and not terrible to get check raised and/or be forced to fold.

Granted, I overall still believe betting the flush draw is +EV, but it is different from TPTK."
poker,fnuxlsl,t1_fnuwjhn,1587273863.0,"Well duh, but the reason I made this post is I can see clear objections to my line of reasoning that I'm not sure how to respond to. What happens when we get check raised? I am now put in an extremely uncomfortable spot and will often have to fold my very strong draw when I otherwise could've made a ton when I hit. There is also the objection that I very often will not get two callers due to continuing ranges out of position being small enough 5 way, so I could only be making worse/middling hands I could've gotten value from on later streets fold while sets print off of me."

poker,fnuvjk5,t1_fnuvabh,1587272225.0,"Maybe my understanding is incorrect, but I believe I know what a semi bluff is and this is not one. I am not trying to bluff my opponents off of the pot with solid chances of improving as I would with a semi bluff, I am trying to get multiple callers because it is +EV."
