Recruiters are reluctant to extend offers to people who might not end up moving so convincing them that's your plan regardless might go a long way.

recruitinghell,fpddzcf,t1_fpdc1bq,1588525120.0,"In my personal observation people are not very open to feedback though. Let's take the last lady I interviewed and for sure will have to reject - she would have been hired to answer the phones and she  was just not well spoken - incredibly fast speaking, to a point its hard to understand, and due to the speed her mouth could barely keep up with her brain there was a lot of nervous stuttering too, consistent wrong use of the past tense of verbs, general lack of understanding what she is being asked. Example:
""What would you say are you greatest strengths and respectively, greatest weaknesses?""
Asnwer: ""Amazing""........................silence. That was it. That was her answer. Or ""Do you have any experience with email business etiquette?"" Answer: ""Oh, I use Outlook""

Dude, when you're unemployed your full time job is to look for a job, and you have been submitting a couple of applications per week! You need to step it up.

But between Feb and March I have submitted over 200 applications, because I actually needed to find a job. You're in a major city, it should be even easier for you, only if you try a bit harder.
