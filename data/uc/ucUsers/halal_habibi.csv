TyranitarTube,fplu66g,t3_ge5nag,1588719538.0,I feel like ttar plays games depending on how interesting the plot is and the uniqueness of it. thats why I don't see him playing insurgence again just to use different mons
TyranitarTube,fpgrukn,t3_gdbbr2,1588608365.0,battle frontier was peak post-game potential. literally never got tired of going there
TyranitarTube,fpexz0a,t3_gcjyuu,1588557364.0,I would recommend rewatching the as randomizer so you can see how the whole build-up works

TyranitarTube,fp50mr5,t3_gb4n5r,1588312583.0,glad I wasn't the only one that thought it was riolu who had definitely won
TyranitarTube,fowlsml,t3_g9z2do,1588122299.0,TTar: You guys smashed the like goal last video. Lets see if we can't hit 5k likes :)
TyranitarTube,fow3jk0,t3_g9si17,1588112350.0,"I don't want riolu just cuz its the ""safest option."" I would just rather watch ttar venture out on his journey with a normal mon instead of a legendary or mythic. Idk something about having such a powerful Pokemon like solgaleo or melmetal as your partner kinda just kills the fun imo."
TyranitarTube,fow2q06,t3_g9q0kv,1588111922.0,ngl this looks like a mystery dungeon arc
