AskReddit,fnqouls,t3_g310ac,1587168990.0,"my goal was 10,000 steps a day. was executing it well: i'm a pretty active city girl and i spent a month in europe starting in february. was planning on 2 months tho, and trip got cut short. since i've come home to quarantine, i've had only a few good walking days. i'm being reasonable about it though. can't wait to be more active eventually :3"

UCSD,e29whxc,t3_8yctd7,1531424872.0,"The Food Co-op has been a LIFESAVER for me. They don't take dining dollars, but they have really cheap vegeterian and vegan options, for when you want something other than Roots. 
As for the dining halls, including Canyon Vista, they have been trying. At CV, there's p good veggie breakfast options: eggs, veggie sausage, hashbrowns etc. and veggie and black bean burger options and pizza always available for afternoon/evening, as well as Salad Bar. I'm not sure about changes since 2017, but their specials tend to rotate weekly, and usually have one veggie option. That's what I lived off when I was living in Warren. Other than that, I bought a lot of microwave meals or ready made options from the market.
Try not to eat to much at Roots since it can be very expensive and drain your dining dollars fast. And try not to eat right before the dining halls close. My freshman year I had this habit and ate pizza and fries for dinner at Pines way too many times. Make the salad bar your friend, since other dining hall meals can be lacking in important nutrients. And take vitamins. HDH is trying to be veg-friendly, but for the times they lack, it's important to stay well-balanced. :-)"
