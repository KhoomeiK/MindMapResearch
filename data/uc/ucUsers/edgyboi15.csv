berkeley,fn64m2n,t3_fv0dfn,1586687222.0,"Berkeley. You seem like you’d love the environment of the Valley. If you’re really scared about declaring major, start studying now you have 4 months in your hand and all the lectures and material are available on webcast.berkeley.edu. I’m kind of in the same position but I’m really in love with SF; I’m gonna say fuck you to the declaration requirements and work my ass off to declare if I have to. I’m already more than halfway done with CS61A and I suggest you start now too. Berkeley CS is soooo gonna be worth it. Also, ucberkeleyrejects.com lmao"
berkeley,fn3hv00,t1_fmfh3k3,1586621052.0,"same! (they were kinda crazy this year tho, waitlisted a bunch of MIT and Umich kids i know, their loss lmfaoo)"
berkeley,fn07v7p,t1_fn07qfo,1586537013.0,That’s reasonable. Thank you for your inputs! :)
berkeley,fn06f0e,t1_fhajwa2,1586536275.0,"Hi, and congratulations on the grade! I'm an incoming Freshman for the class of '24 and I just took my first midterm 1 practice test. I scored a 32 on a test with a mean of 25.2, and a std dev of about 7-8. I shall continue to take more tests, and am aiming for as high as possible as time is a luxury for me, but do you think that there is a point of diminishing returns of doing practice tests, or does doing each practice test add, say, 5% to my expected grade? Would it be reasonable to expect to get my score (using this very test a benchmark) to something closer to a 35-38 with more tests? Thanks!"
berkeley,fmzeikj,t1_fmz9t4b,1586517565.0,"I just took my first midterm (fall ‘18) midterm 1 today and scored 32/40; the average was about 25.2 or so; i definitely agree with you, there was a 6 pointer that i COMPLETELY lost out on even after throwing 60 timed minutes on the problem and tbh it hurt lol"

berkeley,fmkhnhm,t1_fmkh927,1586155271.0,"I absolutely 100% agree with you, GPA is going to be irrelevant in the long run and I am aware of it. As I’ve mentioned here before though, I don’t want to take a chance as this very subreddit is filled with horror stories for the search queries “CS70”, “CS61A”, etc. and I have absolutely no idea what to expect or what my yardstick is. I just want my first year to go by without having felt like I hadn’t prepared enough y’know :(
Also yes, I don’t find CS61A challenging yet either, and I’m slated to finish the entire course in less than a month or so. Just sorta mentally preparing myself for the course workload in Berkeley in a way, helps me build some confidence with regards to my performance in the class."
