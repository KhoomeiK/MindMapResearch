I don’t know much about Deven, but I do know that Zuleika is a co-chair for the Transfer Leadership Coalition and works with current community college students to help them transfer to a four-year university of their choice. She’s been involved in many fronts representing transfers. Especially parenting transfers. I think that’s one thing to consider when voting. Especially since she’s representative of an even smaller population on campus: a parenting woman of color. 
Deven, on the other hand, is listing positions she held in hs. Not quite relevant anymore. That being said, while Deven hasn’t had quite as many transfer-related experiences, I think she has more room to grow in the position than Zuleika. 
Either way, it’s your choice. Please vote! Given the way people expressed their distaste for the current board, you need to use your voice and vote or you’re gonna be upset either way. At least if you vote you can say you tried.

edit: Zuleika has denounced her endorsement from DB to stand in solidarity with Carl Illustrisimo."
