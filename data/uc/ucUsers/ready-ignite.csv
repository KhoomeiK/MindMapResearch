The shift is particularly galling for the Bay Area ordinances just relaxed guidelines providing explicit exemption for sunbathing and other outdoor activities in reflection of successful containment in our area. They extended shelter-in-place with the trade-off of relaxed guidelines.

Guidelines can be structured to encourage behavior to minimize transmission with the least possible restriction on movement or freedoms. This aligns the interests of public and representatives of the moment.

Specifically, California is a massive state filled with barren wilderness areas. Keep the beaches open. Encourage public to drive further to remote coastline to minimize social contact. Gas is cheap! Freedoms intact. Reduced spread of the virus. Think of all the extra gas tax California can collect. Win win.

There is not a data driven justification for representatives of the moment to come down harder state wide. We're far below the best-case scenario projections. There is only rage bait TV unhinged emotional outburst screaming ""FIRE"" in the crowded theater for ratings to back this.

When you're rested and healthy, you've got more gas in the tank to perform work. Your energy levels largely determine your ability to focus on the task at hand. That little bit extra every day goes a long way.

Find yourself distracted easily and joking about ADHD? Your energy levels are probably low.

The key levers to increase energy are diet, exercise, and sleep.

* You can get most of the benefit from 30 minutes of exercise each day, consistently.

* Nutrition is longer to summarize but TL;DR a vegetable smoothie in the morning simplifies planning every other meal. Look up joe rogan's kale smoothie for example. Plugged into nutrition calculator, planning for the rest of the daily meals becomes far easier. You can then find efficiencies with mealprepsunday to save money, eat healthier, and find blend of foods that maximize energy.

* Sleep is a skill. You practice it like any other over time. On the psychology end, you can hack your brain to go into sleep mode more rapidly by reserving the bedroom for only sleep and relationship activities. Using electronics or entertainment? Keep it in another room when possible. Tricks yourself to go into relaxation mode. Consistency in when going to bed and getting up means more restful sleep, big part of 'hangover' discomfort is how the body expresses disrupted sleep schedule.

At the other extreme is do nothing and return to business as usual. This overwhelms hospital resources which also is not reasonable.

Mitigation *is* the option we're engaged in. Apply some risk management to reduce probability of spread low enough to avoid overwhelming hospital resources. The story told by the data is we are in a far better place than the best case scenario early models predicted. Mitigation is working! It's not necessary to tighten controls.

That provides tolerances for tiered return to work strategies while slowing things down when the hospitals call for it.

We've got control freaks out there that want to go for the impossible containment approach by subjecting people to the strictest lock-down measures possible seemingly for the indulgence in control over others. The exercise of unnecessary State power because you have that power available to use has a word -- that is fascist.

Demonizing your neighbor because they need to work to eat, for survival, is evil. Too strict a shut-down means food shortages and civil unrest. There are those gleefully eager for a revolution who would welcome that. I see paths to more dead from lack of food and that unrest than if the outbreak run wild.

Perhaps I'm cursed with imagination. I see no shortage of paths that don't rely on extremes. For example study those hardest hit and stagger back-to-work for low risk demographics. As a mitigation strategy this reduces the human toll while building herd immunity. Provides a pressure valve to reduce tensions of those suffering most without explosions of civil unrest."

""Give it to the fans"" as a long-term monetization strategy is one I think beats out alternatives.

Those fresh MBA's working on the marketing strategy look too anchored in existing case studies for inspiration for gaming. The Disney model of tight restriction with infrequent re-release. The EA model of dangle gambling slot machine addictions in front of children and get them ruinously addicted to paying for cosmetic items. Kills the experience which is exactly the entertainment industries woes with pirating. Focus on the positive experience and keep the customers on your early-netflix easy way to pay for content model.

In gaming the best experience on the long-run are games that give it to the fans. Release mod tools. Let the fans build content free of charge. You look at the game sales over the long-run of a Skyrim and you've got continued game sales and active community based on the content that keeps pumping out for it. That fattens the tail of your product life while maintaining a great user experience.

You can fatten that tail on product sales further. In the RDR2 case study Rockstar would have benefited from releasing PC and mod tools earlier. Devoted community would eagerly drive time into a faithful recreation of RDR in the new game engine. Formally adopt good mods, Rockstar could take that work, add their own remastered cutscenes and add some voice acting to the product and release the mod as a product for console DLC. In the meantime their dev team is free to work on other content (e.g. online) that can be monetized concurrently.

Embracing fan work is free labor. Just treat them with respect. And that involved support for archive efforts after done with the product.

I'm sure Legal is a roadblock. Protecting IP. A creative legal team has to be able to come up with frameworks to embrace community without choking the spirit from it."

The purpose of shelter-in-place is to reduce spread of COVID-19. Social distancing reduces the spread. There is no additional benefit to be realized by coming down hard on those responsibly social distancing. It's only an exercise in power for the sake of using power.

On the data driven decision-making side we have no examples of points of interest social distancing occurs resulting in outbreaks. The data is silent on this. Data published by SF shows that the vast majority of new cases are those with interaction with other infected, friends / family. Of community spread the numbers appear to be correlated with the homeless facilities and maybe public transit or shopping activity, indoor areas with high-density.

The application of arbitrary and excessive control loses the public. The public armed with information demonstrate reasoned compliance we see in San Francisco. The moment that arbitrary exercise in pushing the public around occurs you get people adjust their reasoned decision and jump off the shelter-in-place train -- the new information changes the equation losing consent of the governed.

These outlets will *destroy* you when called out.

Consider the example of the Boston Bombing coverage on reddit. The live threads included experts from every imaginable field and had unlimited human labor at their disposal. This meant rapid aggregation, sorting, sifting, and rapid debunking of new information. Those live threads debunked bad information in MSM stories minutes after going live -- repeatedly. This took narrative control out of the hands of MSM, just made it impossible.

So, what to do? The media outlets turned to attack reddit as a platform. Found the worst 5% of people on the internet working to identify and doxx possible suspects, an activity taking place across Facebook, Twitter, chans, chat rooms, and beat reddit over the head with it. They ran story after story attributing the actions of the worst 5% as characterization of every person on the platform. The allegation was total bullshit. All day long the live threads banned that behavior and community repeatedly reminded one another not to engage in that speculative activity, and once banned those worst 5% actors just shifted over to other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.

But that tactic was effective. Reddit bent over backwards, promoting less effective methods of covering live threads that didn't compete with media control over narrative. The media driven attacks against reddit slowed.

The same story took place across other tech platforms. Provide privileged access to media figures *or they destroy your platform*. Blue checkmarks on Twitter break the rules with impunity, and you're booted for the smallest slight? The difference is you don't have a platform that can harm Twitter so you get the stick. Premium recommendations on YouTube? Have you created an adpocalypse lately? Nope.

You have MSM writers going so petty as to try to destroy school kids standing in place minding their own business -- the Covington kids. They're that kid that no one wants to play with because they cheat, then when they lose anyway are such sore losers they will break your things.

It's a protection racket. Nod your head and pretend what the MSM is saying is true, or *they will destroy you*.

Notice how aggressively MSM outlets fired their research and copy editor teams to cut costs, then replaced them with digital teams.

The activity taking place at Ocean Beach is remarkable compliance with our guidelines. People are nailing it when they go outside while maintaining social distance. It's only a small few who need a reminder, send an officer or two out for a stroll during the day with friendly verbal reminders to maintain distance and that should do the trick -- no need for citations or heavy-handed tactics.

I'm mind-reading here, but I think the confusion comes by those who haven't read the ordinance. If we survey the population I suspect many don't realize the exception made for going outdoors for sunshine and exercise. Thus the outraged responses are trying to exert a social control not mandated by the shelter-in-place ordinance.

Frankly I feel driving to other points of interest would be beneficial for social distancing.
