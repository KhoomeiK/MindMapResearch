edit: not even sad"

Small droplets hang in the air, fluid mechanically speaking, and there are nature published studies to implicate small droplets in transmission far exceeding 6ft.

I feel like you are not arguing in good faith, and again I will highlight that exponential growth in California has rebounded this week."

The SARS1 transmission in an aircraft far exceeded 6ft. Add to this that exponential growth was increasing in california prior to opening the beaches and I am very concerned based on evidence."

biotech,foeh595,t1_foefsur,1587703652.0,"It's just the nature of the beast, writing up every detail of an experiment is difficult so you often have questions about exactly how or why something was done. 

And for interpreting results, there are often things you suspect but can't prove so they don't make it into the report.

In industry there's a huge amount of stuff that only technical teams know about, and you have to try to talk to people to see if they remember an experiment they ran 20 years ago (and they often do and their input is helpful)."
