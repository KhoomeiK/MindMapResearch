If the sole reason you think schools should be reopened is so that someone other than parents is watching over children (*i.e.* you see school as nothing more than day care and babysitting), then your suggestion makes sense.  Trying to teach in this context would be insane if everyone actually showed up because it would just take two weeks to get people back into a normal routine again.  We do not have that world, and so we are continuing rightly to keep schools closed."
Imperator,fonwyol,t1_fojdz6f,1587928108.0,"I have not played since it just released and the very first hotfix patches.  I have been busier in life and, while I enjoyed my playthrough, I wanted to give it time to grow.  I am really glad to see this video to see how much time has been spent on developing it.

Considering that both *Europa Universalis IV* and *Imperator* use mana points, and both use a -3/+3 stability scale, I was shocked when it said both were removed from the game in favor of different mechanics.

One of the things that saddens me about Paradox games is that as long as you are an active member playing regularly, the changes usually come and help breathe new life and make sure the game continues to be fun, and choices seem like logical outgrowth from current mechanics, but if one leaves for too long, one can get very lost.  I feel this way both with *EU IV* and even more with *CK II* these days.  Hopefully I can get back into them, because I really enjoy their games, but often too much time away can lead to a feeling of loss and confusion.  It usually takes several hours of reading dev diaries to realize what's happened and why.

This video certainly helps with that studying, and I am looking to give *Imperator* a hand in the future."

berkeley,foerv6l,t1_foepked,1587712633.0,"For context, when I finished my masters degree, we were the one remote seminar in our program.

We also had regular opportunities to have one on one conversations and office hours with our professor.  There was nothing lost in our experience except not having to spend hours to drive between where we currently resided and going back to campus.

As for the research, I will go digging in my files.  Sadly the days of having access to Google Scholar through UC just disappeared last spring, so I do not have everything I would like to show you.  In short, most education research is very locally specific.  Local conditions, supports, and culture have far more impact on academic outcomes than delivery techniques.  In addition, the most efficient means of transferring information is still proven to be direct instruction (lecture).  Still, we are told not to do it because general educational pedagogy is focused not on being efficient in transferring information but in improving educational outcomes for students with the least academic skills rather than trying to improve the academic outcomes for the majority of students.  Almost all discussions and research about learning styles is about increasing the outcomes of those limited few students who are otherwise not on level for reading, writing, critical thinking, or calculating.  Once again, if you are one of these people, that is support the tutoring center (and consequently the ASUC and student fees) covers, not University tuition."
berkeley,foep212,t1_foeomz7,1587710042.0,"You might be surprised, but as someone with a Masters in Education, I am aware of learning styles, the research around them, and the public discourse that typically mangles what the research actually says.

The major benefit from in person education in an educational context is primarily felt in primary and secondary education where a teacher chooses to read the room and change the way they manage and deliver their content.  This is not something that is done in higher education in general because the expectation is that the student regulates and controls their own focus and effort in the class.  The sole exception to this tends to be in educational classes, and the effect on students who are used to the more mature and independent style of higher education tends to make them feel as if they are being treated in an infantile manner.

If you are entering Berkeley and have not learned to self motivate yourself in your education, then you are in trouble, because you are developmentally behind where you should be."

It is true that remote learning does impact labs (and library and archive access for those of us in the world of Letters, rather than the Sciences), but you have to agree that it is a huge offer to let students not even attend courses but still get access to the education that they want to have.  The University is doing what it can to allow students to be safe while continuing their studies, and it should be commended for that, rather than be criticized for it.

I am not very satisfied by Newsom as a politician because in general I think he purposefully only does things if they are popular.  I see his comment on closure as an attempt to have his cake and eat it too, giving himself the spin that he 'did the right thing' when he did nothing at all.  You are right that if he had made this call, he would have been putting his neck on the line, and I do not appreciate the lack of courage.  He operates by liberal opinion poll rather than by conviction, something I would rather see in a governor.  I think he likes to pander more often than lead.

I worked at a school that has a temporary principal and a temporary superintendent.  The lack of legitimate power means that both were willing to drag their heels until the county told them to do something, and the county only did something because their neighboring counties gave them cover.  Even then, they still wanted us to return in May initially, but had to be strong armed behind closed doors to stay closed through the rest of the school year.
