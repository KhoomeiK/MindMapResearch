UCSD,fpm8ahc,t3_ge1ofw,1588727604.0,"I sent a form in, I was shortly after contacted by a case manager at ERC who helped me to get a grocery gift card through the school, help filling out the lost wages form, and resources for applying for Cal Fresh. I especially mentioned I had problems with lost wages and groceries so that’s what they helped with. I believe if you’re having difficulty finding housing they have even more things they can help with."
UCSD,fpfaa7f,t1_fpesfo7,1588565626.0,The 8 units applies to the entire summer so if you did session 2 you only have to do 1 class each session. Unless you’re trying to have half the summer off
TrollXChromosomes,fpeiuxp,t3_gcmkri,1588548400.0,"I feel like the more time I spend on Reddit the more I realize it’s generally hostile to women all the time. Isn’t the founder somehow involved with incels/mgtow? Or at least sympathizes with them? But maybe it’s worse lately. I’ve unsubscribed from many subs because they spiral into a bunch of people saying things like women are stupid, inferior, etc."
Anticonsumption,fpb1oie,t1_fp9iyte,1588460243.0,"I’m glad to hear the school helps divert the waste. I should find out if my school has similar policies and if not, see about setting them up"
Anticonsumption,fp96abn,t3_gbzpel,1588415982.0,"Hey I’m all for checking out what rich students leave behind. When students were leaving my school because of covid I found a $300 dyson vacuum in the trash with all the parts! No shame in it, it’s literally going to be wasted anyway"
UCSD,fp962qa,t1_fp8lk1a,1588415750.0,I looked at my financial aid for spring quarter and there was an emergency grant automatically added without me knowing of it. I got a random disbursement of it and I have heard other students getting something similar too
UCSD,fp7eeci,t3_gbot19,1588369065.0,"There will only be two people per room but the apartment sizes vary. Mine was one triple and 3 singles, but I had friends who had up to 12-13 people in the entire apartment (often 3-4 triples and 1 single). With the new restrictions I guess that means you could still have up to 9 in one apartment? Someone here on the subreddit did a walkthrough video of a Village apartment so you can see what it’s like. The hdh website isn’t that helpful for incoming students."
UCSD,fp503i6,t3_gav3a6,1588312133.0,"When I was waitlisted I got an email saying there was an update to my application status. I didn’t know until several weeks later that I was accepted. Then I first got an email, then the welcome packet later."
UCSD,fowbjlk,t1_fouw5xa,1588116609.0,SAME I always feel rushed no matter how much work I do. I blame the quarter system
UCSD,fotkp42,t3_g9hcx8,1588056934.0,My kind of professor
UCSD,fotgxe0,t3_g9b08y,1588053597.0,Im also a transfer student and I panicked about the quarter limit too. I spoke to a counselor in ERC advising about it and she said as long as you’re making progress toward your degree (meaning taking relevant classes to your major and minor) and are full time (12 units or more) you will be approved for an extension of you need to continue past 6 quarters.
UCSD,foq07e2,t3_g8vujq,1587978213.0,"It’s hard to stay focused, but yeah. Many of my professors have shortened the test time so I don’t have much time to look around the textbook for answers. I try to be familiar at least with the book and notes so I can look up things I don’t know."
UCSD,fo1i2ap,t3_g52nhd,1587433751.0,Your friends are stoners who aren’t from school? I literally met all of my good friends in classes and just asked them if they smoke weed. Go for a smoke sesh and talk and then make a long term friend
UCSD,fo1hu4d,t3_g5644w,1587433607.0,Cover the webcam with a sticky boi
TrollXChromosomes,fnob8uq,t1_fno6ni3,1587119088.0,Yes! I always think it’s a red flag when a guy has zero women friends. Being able to have friendships with women means they see women as more than just potential sex partners. It’s important to be able to talk to and befriend different kinds of people.
UCSD,fno1ihk,t1_fnntrtj,1587108684.0,Yeah I might try one more time. I know I’d be behind but I feel like since everything is recorded it would be possible to actually catch up
UCSD,fnnjmmk,t3_g2b26w,1587093916.0,Taking CHIN 10CD this quarter and it’s similar to the previous quarters. There is work every day but it’s manageable and helps me to keep up
UCSD,fnnj1mm,t3_g2t2kn,1587093517.0,Can’t read it because it’s behind a paywall. Can someone summarize it?
UCSD,fnj8phi,t3_g23kmz,1586994097.0,Your financial aid should be the same for summer session regardless of covid. You should call or email the office just to make sure they have your housing info and confirm the number of units is enough to get the full amount.
UCSD,fncfora,t3_g0ddny,1586835622.0,"I’m also a transfer student and I’m pissed that I’m losing my university experience stuck at home. I told my parents if fall quarter is online I’m going to withdraw and come back to finish once school is back in person. I chose UCSD to live on campus and get that experience, I could find work for a quarter if needed."
PanPorn,fmy3aso,t1_fmxwzel,1586477209.0,Thanks! I’ll try some of those out!
PanPorn,fmxvk3b,t1_fmx9chw,1586472721.0,How did you use Divine? I love all the other colors but can’t figure out a combination that doesn’t make divine look all muddy on me.
UCSD,fmv7f11,t3_fxiuy0,1586408096.0,"You can email them saying “hi professor, I’m worried that the classes keep going over time. I have a class right after but I don’t want to miss the material” or something like that so they’re at least aware of it. Tell them you and other students have to go after."
UCSD,fmu4vym,t3_fxc6mb,1586384633.0,"Most stores keep saying there’s no shortage of them, people are just buying up more than usual so the shelves are empty. If you go to the market early in the morning when they restock you shouldn’t have a problem getting some, but you can also call to make sure before you go."
UCSD,fmrif7k,t3_fwrh5c,1586324159.0,"I sometimes tell the professor that a student’s constant interrupting is distracting students, hurts my ability to focus and doesn’t add to the class. The professor should then handle it by talking to the student."
UCSD,fmn8hof,t3_fw6bxb,1586220443.0,I think since the plan is to use the campus to treat covid patients I don’t see that being over with in the summer. But who knows? Hopefully we’ll at least be back for fall session.
UCSD,fmdpth0,t3_fufjsy,1585974311.0,I have so many emails I can’t keep up with them and opening my inbox gives me anxiety. I don’t know how to better sort through them
