As you progress in your Mandarin and practice speaking Cantonese with your parents, you will start picking up words in Cantonese faster. Ask them to speak to you with more high level words in Canto and your brain will automatically start making associations between Mandarin and the equivalents in Cantonese, abs both will naturally build off each other."
UCSantaBarbara,fpenfjw,t1_fpde05y,1588550939.0,"I've taken PSTAT5A (fulfills the precomm requirements in place of comm87) and Comm 89. Currently taking comm 88. PSTAT with Prof Swenson was a straightforward class--do the homework, read the book, and do practice problems and it'll be easy to get at least an A-. Comm 89 with Prof Lane was really great. He was super organized, engaging, and considerate. The class was not that difficult--as long as you're good at taking multiple choice tests. 
If you end up having to take precomm classes online, you will most likely have free response tests instead of MC. That is the case with my current Comm 88 class. It's pretty challenging but the material is not that difficult to understand. I haven't taken comm 1 yet, but overall my impression of the precomm classes is that they're not difficult but also not ridiculously easy either. You just have to be willing to put time into studying and reviewing the material. If your MC and writing skills are lacking, it might be a good idea to work on those."

UCSantaBarbara,foxh5oa,t3_g9y73k,1588143852.0,I feel this way too. I lost a good number of points for the proposal for the thesis. Feedback was okay. I have a different TA and I've gotten full marks for my lecture notes (my notes resemble the lecture slides almost verbatim) so I don't know if he actually grades them for quality or not. The insane amount of work for this class is quite demotivating. The professors have half assedly addressed the difficulties we have in this class and offered to cheer us on. That's it. I wish they would actually make changes to the coursework or the grading instead of sending emails that don't change anything.
UCSantaBarbara,fovtriw,t3_g9gdke,1588107381.0,#6 made my head blank out. Lmao. Asking people to figure out their mistakes from earlier problems and explain why within 2 pages...

UCSantaBarbara,fmrqkf3,t3_fx1gko,1586331848.0,"For freshman dorms, the closest to classes and libraries is Santa Rosa. It is right across from the Psych building (you may have classes in there not related to psych + there's a printing lab in there) and the library parking lot. If you're doing stem, especially for physics, Broida hall (the physics building) is super close to it, assuming you live in the 1100s/2100s side. If you live in the 1200s/2200s side, you will be right next to DLG, one of the dining commons. Regardless of where you in Santa Rosa, however, the main entrance of Santa Rosa is super close to Ortega. If you want to be in a STEM community, you can always just join clubs if you find that you're not placed in the LLC you want.

Also, for party culture, refer to previous threads made on this topic. In short, yes, nerd culture is big. Just surround yourself with nerds and you won't feel left out."

UCSantaBarbara,fmnxqi3,t3_fw8dhq,1586238445.0,"I'm currently in 88 as well. I don't have too much info to make a more wise judgement on your situation unfortunately, but it does seem like Gonzalez is being lenient and considerate towards students for this quarter. She mentioned that tests were supposed to be harder because they were free response, but I think that free responses can be advantageous in their own way because if you do the reading and attend the lectures, your efforts will reveal themselves through your writing (as opposed to the tricks and shenanigans that are normal in multiple choice exams for comm). Hopefully what I've written here is something useful for you to consider, but definitely try to reach out and consult more people if possible."
