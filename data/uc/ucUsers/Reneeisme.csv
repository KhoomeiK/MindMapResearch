Somehow it's less awful than gang related violence? Don't get me wrong, all those fuckers should go to jail, for life.  Parole maybe, after you've been in long enough to convince me you won't just do it again.  Real prison reform to give incarcerated a shot at actually acquiring the skills, knowledge, prospects and attitude necessary to not resort to doing it again.  That's what I want.  I don't see the gang bangers as any worse than anyone else who takes a life not in the protection of their own, or others.  Adding gang related charges stems directly from the way people feel about who is typically in gangs.  Overwhelmingly POC, and usually poor.  It's just a way of locking THOSE criminals up longer.  It's not related to the actual crime at all which is no different than anyone else taking a life.  JMHO"

CAStateWorkers,fpi3hnr,t1_fph4axt,1588632930.0,"I'm going to be real with you.  It's so hard to get people fired, that most managers would prefer that you left on your own, instead of trying to get rid of you, if you are bad news.  So yes, they will micromanage, babysit, insist you sit in your seat at all times, other than timed or scheduled bathroom breaks, and generally make you so miserable, you leave.  Now a few managers do this anyway, to everyone.  There are bad managers, certainly.  But if you experience that while you're in the office, you might at least consider whether that's an attempt to encourage you to look for a promotion or transfer elsewhere, unless you see that happening with everyone. 

With employees at home, the ways to do that still exist, but they are fewer, and harder to implement.  Mostly those time sheet things that lots of people are having to fill out right now is what comes to mind, but I bet bad employees can tick those off just like good ones.  They will just be misrepresenting how much they actually did for each of those hours.  I think those are happening just because there are so many situations where managers have no previous experience with remote supervision and/or departments freaked out and demanded it.  So I don't mean to imply that busywork like that at the moment is definitely about getting people to leave.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that all of that is out the window right now anyway.  It doesn't seem like anyone's talking about it anymore.  Maybe because in the face everything else, now is not when people want to  fill a job vacancy, or maybe because they've got enough else on their plates, or maybe because it's just not practical.  But anything that makes that kind of lowkey harassment untenable is going to be resisted by managers.  It's the best tool they've got to keep bad apples moving along."

But I'm worried there's no other ship coming to pick us up, because everybody else is on the titanic, and we're going to feel the impact of that stupid, one way or the other.  Mostly I just find it weird that with the number of people who travel from here to the Bay Area regularly (I'm one of them - let me tell you about the number of cars on 80 heading to San Jose/San Francisco/East Bay on any given weekday at 5 am), it didn't spread here the way it did there once it got established there in December or January).  They locked down a few days earlier than we did, so clearly the difference is that it didn't spread as much here before the lockdown, and I'm wondering what that difference was."
Sacramento,fpcv8yv,t1_fpbtue8,1588513571.0,"Yeah, there's no way it's a huge impact.  It just potentially slightly cuts down on the risk of outdoor passing of the virus, by meaning that the virus dies a lot faster.  But that's most likely NOT the primary way, or even a very significant way, that people pick it up.  It helps with things like making sure metal surfaces that people communally touch (like say an ATM machine key pad) might carry live virus for less time (if that pad isn't completely sheltered from the sun, and I'm aware a lot of them are).  Obviously the main reason is that it somehow hadn't got here in any significant way before the early lockdown, and the lockdown meant things like that Rancho Cordova cluster didn't get a chance to spread more.  I'm not sure how we got so lucky though, with the amount of commuting between here and the very worst hit counties early on (Santa Clara)/Bay Area.  So I'm looking for other things that probably helped us too."
Sacramento,fpcr8gq,t1_fpcauby,1588510415.0,"We have [more sunny days on average than most other large cities](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/sunniest-cities/) in the US.  It's an average, so it might not have any bearing, because it hasn't been particularly sunny this year (meaning, this year could just happen to be less than our normal number of sunny days).  But we rank just below Phoenix and Las Vegas for the number of sunny days per year and average amount of sunshine per year.  If the virus is less communicable in direct sunlight (because it dies in the air in 2 minutes, instead of hanging in the air for hours), out door spread would presumably be less, the more sunshine there's been for the last two months.   I think it's well established that most spread happens in closed spaces though, so it's going to be a minor impact.  But things like the virus being on a car door handle from someone coughing near your car while you were in the store, would be a danger a lot longer in a climate that's had cloud cover for most of March and April.  The extra sunlight is hopefully killing the virus on lots of outdoor surfaces much more often than in places like New York, that have relatively less sunlight during these months."

If they couldn't be ressistated by the crew, they had to be left where they were.  Now your odds of making it under those circumstances are pretty damn low anyway, but depending on your distance to the hospital, and depending how how fast crews got there to start CPR, you CAN make it, and when shit hit the fan, those people didn't get that chance.  That's stage one of triage.  Eventually nobody gets help, and yes, people die who shouldn't have.  The significant number of young, healthy people who need ventilators to make it, quite possibly won't get them if shit gets bad enough.  It got bad enough to have people giving up vents and dying in Italy, because there weren't enough to go around.   It could happen here.  So my rant wasn't meant to suggest we don't try and slow it down.  It was more along the lines of, we can't stop it.  So maybe we have to let it out a little bit at a time, and then get back in the damn house when it's getting beyond our reach again.  Maybe we have to do what Hokkaido is doing.

But at the same time, when will it be long enough?  How do we avoid this?  I don't know if we can.  I think a second wave is inevitable, because we can't stay in lock down until there's a vaccine. Hell even with lock downs (because pretty much everyone was on lock down when the infections that lead to this week's deaths were contracted) the numbers are/were climbing in the US. I'm sure that will accelerate with even just the small number of states who've lifted restrictions.  It seems destined to climb, and the only thing we can influence is the rate of increase.  I see no indication we've been able to reverse the climb.

My whole life is about empathy for people who get the short end of the stick from the word go, and fight tooth and nail to make it to University anyway.  I am very specifically not empathetic towards a small portion of the striking grad students who demonstrated both their selfishness and ignorance of the realities of the situation they put THEMSELVES in, or of the harm they were causing.

And I loved doing it, and by virtue of my education, I felt like I could contribute something meaningful to help out overburdened teachers.  I spent around a decade in one child or another's class, at least two days a week (often more).  Good elementary school teachers are some of the smartest, hardest working, quick witted, compassionate people I know.  I absolutely agree that what an elementary school teacher does all day long would astound the average person if they really saw it first hand.  All these parents struggling with their own kids, should imagine what it's like when there's 15 - 25 more of them.  I know it's different when you are a parent, and when you're at home, and you lack all the support that teachers have in the way of administration and supervised lunches and so forth.  And when you are with them 24/7.  But there's no doubt teachers are underpaid and underappreciated, and I hope you're right that people are beginning to realize that.

Coronavirus,fovznpx,t1_fouy90z,1588110347.0,"I think college is ok for most people remotely.  I mean, it sucks, and so much of what people want to go to college for, is tied up in meeting other people, so it's not great, but it's doable.  But all these parents of younger kids I know, plus the half dozen elementary school teachers I know really well, are very scared about what the long term impact of even just these few months is going to be.  A handful of kids with lots of good quality support at home, are probably not losing all the gains they should have made during these months, but even with them, no one is claiming that the same amount of material can be taught and successfully retained, in this manner.  And then never mind that motivated kids with lots of support, are not the norm.  Lots more kids started out strong and then petered out, and stressed out, or disinterested, or over taxed parents haven't been able to reel them back in.  And then some barely phoned it in from the start.  Out of the classroom means out of school for some families.  This is a lost precious 1/4th of a grade for lots of kids.  There will be a LOT of pressure to not extend that into the fall."

Masks and gloves, and proper use of both, to ensure that the virus isn't inhaled or brought to the mouth or nose via hands that touched something an infected person touched, are going to do a lot more for you than tracing contacts for people who've already been symptomatic long enough to be tested, or checking fevers, ffs.  I understand what you meant.  It won't stop transmission completely.  And it probably won't even slow it down dramatically, but that's sort of like why birth control isn't 100% effective either.  You have to use the product correctly, it has to function perfectly and you have to use it every single time.

UCSC,fort7uj,t1_form64d,1588018096.0,"Yes I've heard this over and over again, this ""where would we be without people willing to take risks"" or variations on that theme.  Take risks with your own safety and well-being, not that of others (undergraduates) and you'll earn my respect, if I agree your cause is just.  It's absolutely symptomatic of how selfish and out of touch those strikers were, that they invoked examples of people like MLK, who always constructed his actions to have the burden fall completely on the actors, and not on bystanders, both because that's smart, and morally defensible.  And maybe it was entirely false bravado, but you'll forgive me for finding the whole ""we're bullet proof there's no way we can be fired"" narrative that floated around here for months, off-putting and convincing.  And that makes the whole thing MORE morally reprehensible, in the sense that I BELIEVE them when they said they didn't think they could/would be fired.  And thus, they didn't think they were risking anything significant on their own behaves, but were willing to cause serious issues for others.    

And I don't really know how they ultimately did anything to ""minimize collateral damage"".  They pushed the line each time their demands weren't met, right up to the full wild cat strike.  You can call it whatever you like, but the evidence that there was never anything more than lip service paid to the notion of minimizing the damage is obvious.  ""We'll try and minimize the damage as long as the university caves right away"" is more like it, and that's both ignorant of the likely outcome, and not worthy of the consideration you'd like me to afford it.  Of course they started with the least troublesome act (I just won't push that button to transmit the grades).  I'm not going to pretend that required some kind of consideration for undergrads on their part.  When that wasn't effective, they went right on escalating without regard for anyone, up to the point of actively disrupting classes they'd made it hard for students to attend.  Please tell me how THAT represents people trying to minimize the impact on undergrads? 

I don't know what the career path is for PhDs in every profession.  I'm just going to say that the one's I'm familiar with revolve around teaching, either as a primary goal, or secondary to that being the only way you can do research.

Look, I don't doubt the vast majority of grad students involved in this action in some way, believed all or part of that horseshit about minimizing the impact.  I have no real beef with any of the TAs that ultimately decided not to continue harming undergrads, even if that didn't happen until the writing was on the wall about the probable outcome.  You live and learn.  But the ones who withheld those grades right to the bitter end, and then beyond?  I stand by what I said.  They are selfish, out of touch, and not constitutionally made for teaching.  I sincerely hope that this experience marks them as such, so that if you're right, and they are after PhDs for some other reason, they are prevented from ever having a change of heart and inflicting themselves on other students."
