Steam,fn13gwp,t1_fn0u22u,1586554036.0,"There is a DLC called “Fall of the Samurai” which takes place when Japan got access to modern military weapons (Civil War Era guns and ships) and went to war with the remaining samurai clans and wiped them out.

Sadly it won’t be part of this free deal"

3d6,fmpv9we,t3_fwkg9g,1586287976.0,"I have played 3 Rangers. 

The first was a hunter conclave straight from the players handbook as my first character. I only played about 3 sessions with him but I liked the range and the ability to track enemies. 

The second was a Hill Dwarf beast master ranger from the UA Ranger. He had a giant badger as his companion and that was fun. He felt very helpful since the party was stranded on a snowy mountain and my character was able to help the party survive. 

The third Ranger I’ve played is my current character in a friends campaign. He is another Hill Dwarf, but this time took on a much different role. I went monster slayer from Xanathars and am using the new variant Ranger from a more recent UA. I am trying to play him like a Slayer Dwarf from Warhammer. So he is much more focused on melee and spells to track and hurt monsters. 

I think what pulls me towards rangers is their mix of melee and ranged, plus their usefulness in the wilderness where most adventures take place. I always feel like I can contribute as a Ranger if we are traveling, tracking, or monster slaying."
