UCSD,fpcappm,t3_gcmpja,1588493503.0,"That’s a really rough situation to be in, I’m really sorry :// I know that moving back home is not optimal for your emotional wellbeing, but I think that locking yourself into a housing situation in San Diego without having a job lined up would put an immense amount of stress on you to find one since you’ll be financially and legally bound to pay that rent. With only 6 weeks left, I’m just gonna be kind of blunt and say that it’s a bit too late to find a job and house at this point with everything you have going on, so you should probably explore other options. Normally I’d recommend seeing if you could stay with friends in the area, but that might be hard with the quarantine, especially if you don’t know their roommates very well."

UCSD,fo7725y,t1_fo4kee7,1587573365.0,"I know people say this ironically, but like there were definitely some points sophomore or junior year where I wasn’t sure I was cut out, and graduation seemed an eternity away. So I feel this. I just kept going through the quarters as usual and then all of a sudden graduation is here. I feel the same as I always have, I kind of expected to feel idk like accomplished and dignified and ready, but I just feel normal."
