MapPorn,fpb2eqj,t3_gcdyv2,1588460677.0,Why is Scots separate from English but Irish English is just English?
MapPorn,fp2eckf,t1_fp1vynr,1588260290.0,"I wouldn’t say center right, it really depends on the individual political parties. Sometimes liberal could mean center left “social liberals”, or center right “classical liberals”."

GenZLiberals,fodwz55,t3_g6hdj4,1587691712.0,Is there one adjusted for population? It should paint a better picture of how many people that live in a liberal democracy.
neoliberal,fodv4pc,t1_fodefmv,1587690707.0,I mean... weed does make an appealing argument
MapPorn,fnm4l6c,t1_fnl9tg6,1587064991.0,This is what happens to your brain on English
UCSantaBarbara,fn28s85,t1_fn25wim,1586581080.0,Post it on r/legaladvice and do exactly what the all-knowing reddit experts say
neoliberal,fmz4g9i,t1_fmy7kav,1586506016.0,What’s wrong with voting third party? We should be in favor of a proportional system instead of attacking people who do not vote for mainstream parties. r/neoliberal should hold true to its ideological values and not just the Democratic Party.
neoliberal,fmz45cp,t1_fmyxxrm,1586505683.0,In what ways are the republicans standing up to the CCP more so than the democrats? Which CCP’s bullshit are you referring to?
UCSantaBarbara,fmyn212,t1_fmxjxdl,1586490211.0,"I am not going to disagree with you on principle, but it’s quite rude to tell others to stop complaining. They have every right to voice their opinion on the education they are getting or otherwise. It is also disrespectful to disregard their opinion completely without being generous to their arguments. They are obviously not saying more work = bad. They are just pointing out the amount of work given may not be reasonable for everyone. I’m sure you can see that it’s very different from not wanting to do work. Anyway, the most important point you are missing here is that this post and a lot of the other contents on this sub and reddit in general are just memes. I mean... ok, boomer"
UCSantaBarbara,fmylfex,t3_fy3l0c,1586489029.0,At least we get the option to take pass/no pass... right?... RIGHT???
UCSantaBarbara,flhjyuk,t1_flhh56m,1585164099.0,"The issue is that these recommended courses only works if I study abroad for the whole year, not specifically for spring semester/quarter. They don’t match up if I take the classes at UCSB for fall quarter and study abroad for the rest of the year. Thanks for the help though!"
