Especially with how big of a school Cal is with CS being a prominent major here, like so many false positives would occurâ€”idk how you could tell if something is legit coded or copied"
berkeley,fp8mk8g,t1_fp8g9vw,1588396367.0,"I'm a prefrosh so I'm not too familiar with MOSS but how can it still detect plagiarism if you rewrite it completely? Because at that point, how does it not get false positives?"
