nintendo,fokr1su,t3_g7vuf0,1587847306.0,"I’m looking forward to getting together with my friends again. We’ve all been pretty lonely and stressed in quarantine, and I’ve been missing our game nights and dinners together. It’ll be great to get together for a few rounds of Catchphrase, Codenames, and Jackbox games again!"
FREE,fnzwjd1,t3_g4nlzr,1587401976.0,I’d get stardew valley so I could play with some of my friends! It looks like a lot of fun.
nintendo,fnte4gl,t3_g3ptch,1587239825.0,"I’m home from college with my family, and for the first time since I was a little kid we’re growing a garden! My mom has been too busy and tired to weed and prepare the garden, but since I’m home now with more free time due to online classes, I’ve been working on it. It’s really awesome to see how excited she is to plant seeds and grow things like we used to, and I’m really enjoying learning how to garden!"
Catbun,fnmdzqo,t3_g2j2xz,1587069721.0,Awww! What an adorable kitty
Breadit,fn2447g,t3_fyqk8e,1586577334.0,It’s so cute! Oh my goodness!
ucla,fmnhmbm,t3_fwbwdh,1586226254.0,Thank you for checking on Powell cat! So happy to hear someone’s caring for the little cutie.
ucla,fmlj4l2,t1_fmkm88s,1586187437.0,"I entirely agree with you that it’s important for everyone to consider the implications of an engineered pathogen. I think Covid-19 is showing is the world is woefully unprepared to handle any major pandemic, lab-originated or naturally generated."
ucla,fmkmati,t3_fvkotu,1586159976.0,"Thank you for sharing this! This is a great opportunity for us to offer some support and gratitude to the healthcare workers at UCLA health, they’re amazing and they work so hard."
ucla,fmkm5hq,t1_fmkkl8q,1586159817.0,"While bioterrorism is a terrifying prospect and something we should all be aware of, it doesn’t look like Covid-19 was an engineered pathogen. There’s a number of articles online debunking claims that it’s a bioweapon/engineered virus. 
I’ll link one of them here.
