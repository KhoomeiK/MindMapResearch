UCSD,fp6jnj2,t3_gbm2t0,1588353480.0,"Like seriously, let me get this straight. If you spent $3000 on a plan in September, and then spent 1050 dining dollars in the fall, and 1050 dining dollars in the winter, then even though you ended up paying $3000 for $2100 worth of food, UCSD is gonna say ""Oh look you overdrew from spring quarter, we're gonna charge you an extra $100!"" How the fuck?!"
UCSD,foe99yz,t1_fodxkjm,1587698659.0,No offense but you didn't say a single thing that the email didn't already say.
UCSD,fn9y9c7,t1_fn9pwb0,1586787294.0,"This is exactly the problem I have! And the worst thing is professors still make mistakes like saying they posted a document on canvas outlining a project when they really forgot, but now I have to assume I'm the dumbass and just can't find it even though I've checked every single tab."
UCSD,fn0io1s,t1_fmzrnmh,1586542647.0,"Yeah I know this is just anecdotal, but I don't know a single person who reads it."
UCSD,fkyxs5n,t3_flioqf,1584658410.0,"I thought it went alright. I'm glad the problems were similar to the ones we practiced in class, most of them were pretty familiar. I'm also super happy that there were 3 grading options, it just made the exam so much less stressful."
