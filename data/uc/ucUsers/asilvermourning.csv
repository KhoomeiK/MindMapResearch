berkeley,fot74a4,t3_g8x7qu,1588046154.0,"Just wanted to give my two cents, with a disclaimer - I’m not actually in the college of chemistry nor do I have experience with the upper division Chem classes as I’ve only taken gen Chem and Orgo for my requirements. 

With that said, the professors I’ve had in the chemistry department have been absolutely amazing. Partially I’ve gotten lucky, partially these are a bunch of amazing, caring, and outstanding professors. The best teacher I have ever had was my Orgo professor (shout out to Pete Marsden) and he really made me enjoy chemistry more than I ever have before. And the classes themselves have been some of the most difficult, challenging, yet rewarding ones I have taken at Cal as well. It made me want to be a Chem major for a hot second, hah. 

As for housing, that’s tricky but I’d definitely encourage you to look into the transfer floor in Martinez Commons. The building is amazing, it’s quite close to campus, and the rent is ok (relative to Berkeley)."
berkeley,fohixyo,t1_fohdfw3,1587766735.0,They’ve extended the late drop deadline! So dropping classes this semester until their new deadline will not count as a “late drop”

berkeley,fnjh0wu,t1_fnjgxzf,1586998800.0,Thank you! This is really helpful
berkeley,fncgfcm,t1_fnasqs8,1586836133.0,I think they said April 10th is the deadline to determine
berkeley,fn0xati,t1_fn0wd9j,1586550557.0,"As long as you’re confident that you can keep up, I would go for it! Honestly, I think being so immersed in the material really helped me better understand and enjoy the course. For context, I took Chem 3A this last summer and had 1.5 hours of lecture in the morning, Monday through Thursday. Then I went to Pete’s office hours two days a week.  I also took 3AL and a math class, so I would say it’s do-able. 

However, not sure how the format will be this summer given that it’s now online..."
berkeley,fn0uf2x,t3_fxw9ju,1586548941.0,"I would highly recommend taking it with with Pete. I’ve had him for all my lowerdiv chem classes, and he’s an amazing professor. He’s a really clear lecturer, very friendly and approachable, and honestly taking Chem 3A over the summer was one of the best experiences I’ve had at Berkeley. 

However, it’s important to acknowledge that it will be taught online this summer, which may make the course more difficult (just because it is a demanding course and you have to keep up with the material). I know that my productivity levels have plummeted after courses moved online, so I would definitely keep that in mind while you decide on your summer courses."

Separate random suggestions, just for shits and giggles - The Good Place and Star Trek. Not sure what your taste is outside of crime shows, but the Good Place has great character development and plotline (its a little fluffy but it’s fun) and Star Trek is a classic."
