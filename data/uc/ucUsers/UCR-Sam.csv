ucr,foxqblr,t3_ga5oaq,1588152540.0,Yes. I met good friends and enjoyed the “college” experience so far.
ucr,fo8loxl,t3_g6a3qe,1587599009.0,"You can also attend the weekly meetings to see what the ASUCR environment looks like. Sal did point out that there are many sub committees, so I’d go there if the politics stuff is something you don’t want to do."
ucr,fnqi5n1,t1_fnqf056,1587165088.0,"Oh I thought you wanted to outline the benefits. Eh it can help your gpa- say that you were struggling with a class and you get a C. You can make it to a pass/fail and still get the units but then it won’t affect your gpa. I’d only request a change near the end of the deadline that way you have time to decide if the course is gonna help or not. Another reason might be that you don’t want to try and just want to do the bare minimum without getting penalized for it. So you turn it into a pass or fail and just get a C. I think that it only helps as long as you don’t use your pass/fail on classes that you can very easily pass. You only get a certain number (usually) so you want to pass/fail when it risks lowering your gpa.
Edit: keep in mind that the pass/fail usually doesn’t apply to major courses but it seems that this quarter there might be an exception...? Talk to your advisor."
ucr,fnqce11,t1_fnqc7yy,1587161882.0,Dew it
ucr,fnqaf7o,t3_g3b1gq,1587160793.0,"Apply for housing. For Bannockburn, the only thing you got to pay out of pocket is the internet if you don’t want to use the schools WiFi. The commute would kill you. Living right across from campus is more beneficial than driving around 4 hours per trip. You’ll save time, money, gas, and have more opportunity to connect with others. You can apply for a parking space but I don’t know if the pass is included (I don’t drive). I’m from city heights :D

There is also more info on the housing website:

ucr,fnoww8k,t3_g2vc2w,1587135138.0,"There was the CARES act which gave the money to ‘independent’ students. The second bill hasn’t passed yet (I think) and it is estimated that it will be available around June, should it pass (this one is supposed to be available to anyone 16yrs+).

There was also some UC grants that I saw about somewhere either in here or Instagram but I don’t know if they are part of the first act or if they are separate. :/

Found it: https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/g1hq5r/cares_act_funding_for_california_college_students/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The UCR grants are part of the first package + money for independent students"
ucr,fnowepx,t3_g2vtjf,1587134876.0,"There was an email sent out recently but it failed to specify if ‘major’ courses are affected. I’d ask your advisor first before carrying on with an idea.

Edit: From the looks of it and past posts, I don’t think major courses are affected :( But still talk to your advisor."
ucr,fnofmrh,t3_g2yh24,1587123519.0,Try contacting the RSO.
ucr,fnoemsh,t3_g2y9xa,1587122562.0,UCR. The financial aid was the deciding factor for me and UC schools have a rep for being “better” than CalStates. I’m also a poli sci major :D

ucr,fnjpkrf,t3_g24fj5,1587004056.0,"If you are a native speaker, it should be easy. If you took it for high school, then you should be fine. It was multiple choice when I took it so keep in mind that you get some choices if you get stuck."

ucr,fniycgf,t1_fniutz5,1586988556.0,"You are right in calling out the lack of transparency and communication. That's good. You are right in that it is a serious issue and we should be getting something from someone. But you need to be mindful that we are giving you feedback on how you might want to present yourself to a group of random people. Dont take attacks personally, it evokes an emotional response from you. Obviously we know what bs and bullshit are, so by correcting us you gain nothing other than letting us know that our critique was too much for you. A better way of accepting or acknowledging things like these are saying, ""I appreciate the feedback"" or ""thanks but I'm trying to keep it real."" Also, reread your message before sending. There are a few spelling and grammatical errors that other people can use to poke fun at you and delegitimize you as a candidate (consequences would be greater if stakes were higher). We're not your enemies, we are your allies and your constituents :)"
ucr,fnivr93,t3_g1zp9m,1586987217.0,"Why are we still paying fees? - There are building debts that the school is still paying off (like the SRC). There are also maintenance fees to make sure they are earthquake resistant and such. However, this is not an excuse for the school to not pressure its business partners into freezing or postponing the rent payments. I got this info by asking the asucr people during week 1's meeting and from reading the instagram QnA that prez gonzalez did a few days ago."
ucr,fniuayx,t1_fnisofy,1586986489.0,I agree. asucr has a code of conduct but I dont know if it applies to candidates running for a position. I wouldnt risk it if I were op.
ucr,fnc93qt,t3_fytdym,1586831285.0,"Do it! I’d recommend taking it with Shane Shukis (I think that’s his name, pretty cool dude). Writing in 10 weeks is definitely not easy work. Doing it in 5 means that you’re gonna have to focus and prioritize schoolwork over summer fun. Since were in lockdown, I think it’s a great idea to do 2 classes if you have a room and stable internet throughout the summer. Good luck:)"
ucr,fnc8htw,t3_g0ue0a,1586830903.0,I’m okay with the time reduction as a way to reduce cheating. But to not allow people to go back and check is a bit overkill imo. I don’t know if there is a “fair” way to approach tests but I’d try to get your prof to at least consider allowing students to be able to check their answers.
ucr,fnc87ak,t3_g0wt16,1586830717.0,It’s been good. I just need to find the links cause I don’t save them. But other than that I’m having a good time.
ucr,fn4th38,t1_fn4ofou,1586648612.0,I could but I really get picky about where my money goes so that’s why trying to make it worth it while I can
ucr,fn2oj7z,t1_fn1flek,1586596919.0,That is a good point. I should have used this maybe then it would have made more sense.

ucr,fn0x272,t1_fn0ws6e,1586550426.0,Fuck yeah it is! I’m still in season 1 but I already know what happens. Can’t wait to see how it happens tho :)

ucr,fn0rnvo,t1_fn0qv0j,1586547449.0,"I’ve been to the meetings and they look like they’re trying but I’ve been trying to press them on communicating more with the students. Yeah, we know you don’t make the decisions but at least let us know what’s going on. There was a chass senator (running for) that posted a while back asking for feedback so I have hope that next year will be better :)"
ucr,fn0rgnr,t1_fn0qkc8,1586547341.0,Yeah those are two hours of my life I ain’t getting back. You are right tho I admit that.
ucr,fn0p7na,t1_fn0nv04,1586546126.0,"Not much. I think that they’re trying their best given this mess. I made two posts addressing her behavior towards a student via Twitter. She alleged it was her friend and that’s how she talks to them. But my point was also on why a student rep should choose their words carefully as they can harm the reputation of the organization they work for and themselves, especially online. I already addressed her but this guy wanted to express his opinions. so I’m like “yeah I’ll make a post about it.” That’s it."
ucr,fn0og02,t1_fn0octy,1586545712.0,Lol yup
ucr,fmzwgph,t3_fy2ylf,1586530938.0,"If you have any AP credits those can be very useful. Also bypassing the language requirement for chass makes it possible for you to graduate sooner. I’m doing soc and poli sci. The best thing about it is that if one of my majors’ classes is full, then I go and take the other one. So I rarely had to worry about not having a class that I needed to take. If you’re gonna do summer, try getting campus apartments. You benefit from not having to pay rent for the summer."
ucr,fmz9pzy,t1_fmz65ix,1586511998.0,"I understand that the “elections director” isn’t meant to handle this type of issue. And I already addressed this point in another comment but I don’t mind doing it again. Whether or not they have any say in this doesn’t matter. I know they have no say. But they are an organization that is supposed to represent the students. What I tried to highlight was how a paid official shouldn’t tell a student to seek help elsewhere cause that ain’t the officials duty. Let’s say you sought help for your quarter issues and the people you spoke to were your academic advisors. If they said “why are you complaining to me, this isn’t my job,” you’d be amazed at how unhelpful they were. I think you’d prefer a helpful answer at the very least. Something like “try talking to financial aid” would lead you in the right direction. Notice that the director didn’t point the student in the right direction, which was supposed to be the students‘ senator. Rather they shamed the student and tried turning the blame on them for not complaining to the right people. And the thing to remember is that we pretty much pay them to do the speaking for us. But if they can’t even speak for us, then what’s the point in paying them? The pay issue is for another day, but the main point with all of this was to show how not to address the student population if you occupy a paid position because the students are your employer. And that’s the perspective that a lot of freshman and others students don’t understand. Even people in the US don’t understand. Government and groups like these work for the people/the students, and should be held accountable for when they misrepresent or fail to perform their basic duty as a rep. They should be held to a higher standard than the rest simply because they have a louder voice than any of us and because that’s their job. Hopefully you understand where I’m coming from. You’d be surprised about how many people aren’t freshman and don’t know anything about ASUCR."
ucr,fmrjlp9,t1_fmrj6ir,1586325196.0,That’d be a waste of a wish imo
ucr,fmr6bo4,t1_fmr0tmr,1586314899.0,"You are right in that the ASUCR elections director should not have to engage in ""direct"" advocacy for the fees in this case. Im assuming you read the post and the links, so I'll reference those throughout this reply. I believe that if you are in ASUCR, you share a minimal common duty to represent/assist students to the best of your ability. I can give a pass to the director for not engaging in the fees because i understand that it is not her focus or main duty to do so. However, my issue is that she engaged in an unprofessional manner via twitter with a student. I addressed her in last week's meeting and she did not accept any responsibility for her behavior because she believed that their relation as friends protected her from criticism. I'd be okay with that only if she was not a student representative. In fact, notice how she addresses the student. She tells them that they are throwing a tantrum and that it doesn't look cute. On a personal level, I wouldn't care and I wouldn't want to be treated like that. On a professional level, this is very damaging to the organization she represents because she just told the student to help themselves. Notice she did not redirect them to their senator(s), nor did she acknowledge his complaints in a professional manner. This is an issue because we pay these students to represent us publicly and on campus. So if this is how one of their paid members behaves, then I dont think theyre be taking their job very seriosuly. Sure, its an on campus job. Might not pay well. So then why are you doing it? For the resume? The money? Or maybe you really like helping people and representing those that dont have time to do so themselves. Cause if you like helping people, then I'd expect you to respect everyone and acknowledge their concerns in a professional manner.

I dont disagree with the point that the fees are not her duty. I disagree with how she addressed a student. And when you work for the government, or a student elected one, your employer is the student/the people. Thats my view on this.

(the whole pay issue is another thing that bothers me but thats for later). And I dont know the director personally, Im just trying to tell them what theyre doing wrong so that they make better decisions going forward."
ucr,fmogpua,t3_fwbtdz,1586258368.0,Props for reaching out directly to the students :)
