rupaulsdragrace,fombz9g,t3_g7zq9t,1587884641.0,"Okay don't come for me, but I wasnt overwhelmingly shocked at this outfit. Don't get me wrong I like it, but I'm not going nuts over it. I absolutely love Jaida but I thought Jackie's and Widow's were better. I love over the top everything , for the most part, but Jaida's kinda felt tacky to me. Obviously it's my opinion and it's okay for others to disagree, but idk I'm not shitting my pants over it."

Disneycollegeprogram,foeh4fh,t1_foe73ew,1587703635.0,I think they flat out cancelled the FA program because training all of those people at the same time as Fall would be virtually impossible. It really sucks but I think that's why
Disneyland,fo0f5qr,t1_fo006jb,1587412009.0,Wowwwwwww. That's nuts
Disneyland,fo003tz,t1_fnzsj8i,1587403745.0,The last time I was there it was a 240 min wait... Doesn't even seem real.
