cscareerquestions,fozwue9,t3_gaip7n,1588198285.0,"I don’t think it’s a mistake but you should do three things. 

First and foremost good job for not giving them a number. Do not give them a number first. Have them give you a number and if they push just tell them you don’t have enough information to tell you what I think before hearing more about your offer.

Second, Tell company Y to rush their decision ASAP cuz you got another compelling offer. 

Third, Tell company X that you are still very interested. Tell them you don’t take decisions lightly and need time to think about this big life decision. And you can’t do that without more information about company X salary and company Y offer. 

If company Y drags their feat then take company X if they give you a dollar amount first because the economy is shaky rn and a job is better than no job.

Take this with a grain of salt, I’m also a new grad and have just read tons of negotiability advice from books and articles dealing with these possible scenarios."
