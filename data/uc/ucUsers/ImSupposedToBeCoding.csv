cscareerquestions,fovfcrk,t3_g9nozb,1588100372.0,My first assignment was a a huge list of security findings through Checkmarx that I needed to resolve for a legacy application written in VB & [ASP.net](https://ASP.net). There was zero training and they basically threw me in their saying good luck. I was super pissed and really hated my job at the time. Since then I've gotten to work with more recent tech (Angular & Node). Still salty about that and will be leaving my company soon.

linux,fofw5id,t1_foeu5z5,1587743868.0,"When it comes to multi-factor authentication we describe things as ""what you know"" (eg password) and ""what you have"" (eg authentication app that generates tokens, or a card you insert into your computer). Also, there's ""what you are"" (eg retinal scans, fingerprints).

A username is something you know, but a fingerprint is something you are. So I really don't think a fingerprint can be described like you did. Because not everyone really ""knows"" your fingerprint, just the fact that you have one."

crypto,fnptl0d,t1_fnp2dn7,1587151756.0,"Interesting, let's try to do some math. But first, what constitutes ""close variation""? In the context of OP's post, let's say some word A is a close variation of some word B if it differs by 2 or less characters.

Let's make a list of every possibly ""close variation"" of B with the following assumptions: B is of length n, only a-z, A-Z, 0-9 = 62 character space. 

* B, but missing a single character: (O(n) time to check these
* B, but missing two characters: O(n choose 2) = O(n! / 2 \* (n-2)!
* B, but a single character swapped with any other character except itself. O(n\*61)
* B, but two characters swapped with any other character except themselves respectively: O((n choose 2)\*61\^2) = n!\*61\^2 / 2\*(n-2)!

But let's think about what's realistic for n. Most likely someone's password won't be 32+ characters long. But let's assume the worst case is a length of 64. That would take:

64 + (64! / 2\*(64-2)) + 64\*61 +  (64!\*61\^2 / 2\*(64-2)) = A BIG FUCKING NUMBER"

Someone looking for a job (often new-grads) get their hopes up for one specific role (usually big-N) and only focus on those interviews. Then you get rejected and not only do you take a huge morale hit, but now you haven't been using your time to apply to other places. I fell into this trap too, so I'm not berating you.

You should learn from this, and next time continue to apply to other places even though you're interviewing with your dream company. You have to be realistic as well as optimistic.

>since all the previous stages went perfect.

This is some dangerous thinking, and a little cocky. There's no way to know you did perfect in an interview. If you solved the question quickly != perfect. They're screening you for a million things not just if you got the problem or not.
