UCSantaBarbara,fp8552y,t1_fp7h59w,1588383769.0,"no i meant feeling out of place, i come from a high school that was mostly latinx/black so going to a mostly white/asian school made me feel out of place culture wise"
UCSantaBarbara,fp011ll,t3_gad7tb,1588200484.0,"Hey I'm a fat girl here at ucsb and I can tell you that I encounter more issues feeling lonely/out of place because of my race/ethnicity (latinx) rather than my size. To be honest I don't go to the beach much but when I do I don't really wear a bathing suit more like swim shorts and an athletic shirt because I personally don't feel comfortable in a bathing suit but I've definitely seen other fat girls here rock the heck out of their bathing suits and no one cares or has issue with their size. 

• Dating: only tried tinder once and got plenty matches but never went on a date or anything (i'm not looking to date atm)

• Lectures: some lectures have good seating space (Buchanan, Chemistry, Harold Frank Hall, IV theatre 1) while others don't (Campbell, IV theatre 2). i'm talking about the space between your legs/belly and the desk part.

• Biking: tbh i haven't seen a lot of fat people bike but i bike and it's fun and a good way to get exercise in but walking is good too

• Food: if you're going to be eating in the dining commons no one really comments on the kind of food you're getting because tbh all college students tend to eat like crap but some are more conscious and choose healthier options. also i feel like there are more healthy options at the dining commons than IV

•Partying: easy to get into, especially if you're a girl, your size won't be a problem at all

yes you'll be surprised by how fit everyone tries to be or how much they jog/surf/hike but honestly it's just the environment and they're just being the healthiest they can be, they're not gonna stand there and judge you. anyone who comes from my hometown to visit also thinks they are very health conscious here too which is crazy to me because my friends are pretty fit themselves. so yes i sometimes feel out of place but i've felt out of place in high school too. it's not an issue of which college you go to but more how society views us. just be confident and don't let yourself be pushed around! you'll be fine <3"
