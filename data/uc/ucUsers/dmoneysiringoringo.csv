playingcards,fo9huuo,t1_fo9hcil,1587619968.0,"Definitely keep the courts and numbers standard but make them interesting by adding little things related to the theme of the deck. I would recommend looking at the the oxygen playing cards and any deck from organic playing cards for inspiration of the court cards. Mix up the color ways but don’t deviate to far from red and black if it’s going to be a magic focused deck. As for the back design, definitely make it two way and have fun with it! It’s your deck and your vision! Just wanted to give some suggestions. And if they look dope then I’ll back them!"

playingcards,fo3bllg,t1_fo3atqq,1587484090.0,"Honestly low printing numbers generate hype around the decks which appeal to both collectors and investors/resellers and due to the community seeing these decks resell for double or more will increase the demand drastically while supply stays the same. Personally for me, I only have an affinity towards the 6006 and the summer checkerboards are to me, they are the most unique and versatile as my use for playing cards are mainly for poker and a bit of magic."
