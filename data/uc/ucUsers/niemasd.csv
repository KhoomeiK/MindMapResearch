UCSD,fozv1sf,t1_foznx5c,1588197367.0,Ooooo I'd be down. Maybe I should start a taco vlog once quarantine is over :') Tacos and Trees: a vlog where I talk about data structures and phylogenetics while reviewing tacos
UCSD,foziya0,t1_foziir0,1588191442.0,"Congratulations!!! And yes, we have the best tacos in San Diego :-) (although not too many amazing taco shops immediately around UCSD in my opinion; not bad, but not the best)"
UCSD,fozenuh,t1_fozdris,1588189390.0,Thanks! This was quite a while back (I started undergrad in 2011 LOL) but it was definitely the right choice for me :-)
UCSD,foza3x3,t3_gaecv8,1588187218.0,"I did! I knew I wanted to go the biomedical route, and UCSD is extremely well-recognized for biomedical research. Plus, I'm originally from San Diego and all of my friends and my parents are still here, so I wanted to stay close to them all. Also, at the risk of starting a war, SD tacos >>> LA tacos

They're both excellent schools, so either is a good choice"
UCSD,fopnt37,t1_fop83gp,1587966598.0,I don't think the world's ready for another banger like that one
UCSD,fop7ook,t3_g8ph0q,1587954928.0,You got this :-)
UCSD,fociazk,t1_foci32z,1587671650.0,Isn't it Week 4?
UCSD,fob62it,t3_g6m1ej,1587656496.0,"During my undergrad, the 4 hardest classes I took (at least hardest for me) were the 3 ochem classes and BIBC 102. I fortunately took CHEM40A and CHEM40B (they were 140A and 140B back then) in the summer on their own, so I had literally all my time to focus on them, and even then, they were ridiculously hard for me. I barely passed CHEM40C (was 140C back then). When I took BIBC 102, I dropped it the first time because I didn't feel like I understood anything, and when I retook it the next quarter, I barely passed it

Also, the first CS class I tried to take (I was a Bioinformatics major, so I took both bio and CS classes) was CSE 11, and I dropped it 4 weeks into the quarter because I didn't feel like I understood anything. I tried again, ended up doing well, and fast forward 7 years later and I'm a professor in a top CSE department

It's totally okay to feel overwhelmed, and when I dropped those classes, I too felt like I had failed not only myself, but also my family. However, in hindsight, dropping those classes when I did in order to regain a bit of control over the things in my life was absolutely the right decision for me at the time, and I'm pretty sure that if I *didn't* drop those classes when I did, I would have ended up falling into a downward spiral

If everything in college was easy, there would be no point in even going to college: you would already know everything! Thus, by reverse logic, for college to be meaningful, you have to struggle at some point: struggling + overcoming the hurdle = growth. It's extremely frustrating when the struggle is fresh, but just know that, after you overcome it, you'll be able to reflect on it and see how much you've grown

TL;DR: What you're feeling is absolutely expected, but just know that you're not failing yourself when you choose to drop a class if you've bitten off more than you can chew :-)"
UCSD,fntq3ol,t3_g3v8nm,1587246605.0,Have you tried accessing them through the [UCSD VPN](https://vpn.ucsd.edu/)?
UCSD,fnthqj4,t3_g3soaz,1587241894.0,"I found [this document](https://cse.ucsd.edu/sites/cse.ucsd.edu/files/undergraduate/CSE%20Pass%20Grade%20Memo%20Majors%20%26%20Minors.pdf) on the [CSE Spring Undergraduate Course Updates page](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/spring-undergraduate-course-updates), which says the following:

> * P/NP grades taken during Spring 2020 will not count towards the 25% cap on P/NP (P/NP courses will be removed from both the numerator and denominator in this calculation).
> * Students will be able to select P/NP (and S/U) grades through the end of the 10th week.
> * Instructors may not require that students enroll on a P/NP or S/U basis in courses that currently allow letter grades.
> * The Department of Computer Science & Engineering **will allow courses for CSE major degree course requirements to be taken P/NP for Spring 2020 only**. (See below for details.)

The ""below"" part is the following:

> CSE Major/Minor requirement courses in which students receive a ""Pass"" may count towards the fulfillment of that requirement, even though that course is not taken for a letter grade. This exception will be in effect for Spring 2020 only, for all CSE majors (CS25, CS26, CS27, and CS28) and CS Minors (CS26). Please note that if you are using a grade of ""Pass"" in your Spring 2020 course towards your major or minor requirements, the system has been updated and programmed to automatically bring in those courses for your CSE major/CS minor requirements (for Spring 2020 courses only). Students who want to take a class for P/NP are responsible for making any changes needed in WebReg before the grading option deadline. For students who started before Fall 2019 and who may use “D” grades towards their major requirements, please note that a ""D"" is considered a ""No Pass,"" so in the event you receive the equivalent of a ""D"" and you take the course P/NP, you will not receive credit towards that specific degree requirement.
>
> Additionally, before you decide on completing your Spring 2020 courses for P/NP, be sure to consider your personal situation and whether it will negatively affect any financial aid, VA benefits, scholarships, graduate school application, job applications, course motivation, etc. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our advising staff via the Virtual Advising Center (VAC, vac.ucsd.edu)."
UCSD,fnpl3xb,t3_g2sdtt,1587147401.0,"I haven't used Canvas videos, but could you use the ""Network"" tab of Google Chrome's ""Developer Tools""? You might be able to go to the page of the video, open up ""Developer Tools"", go to the ""Network"" tab, click play on your video, and the streaming URL should hopefully appear. If it does, you should be able to right click it and click ""Open in new tab"", and you can hopefully download it from there via (e.g. CTRL+S / COMMAND+S)"
