worldnews,fpj9jhg,t1_fpj8zd0,1588660762.0,"Well I think the system is flawed anyway. But that aside, my point was just not to generalize the American population. Not saying she should have won, but Trump winning doesn’t mean everyone wanted Trump. Which leads back to the root post that said that all Chinese people are nationalist CCP fanatics, when social media has plenty of good Chinese people trying to air the CCP’s dirty laundry."
worldnews,fpj98b7,t1_fpj8mek,1588660478.0,"... the guy literally said we voted Trump in as if all Americans collectively got in a room and said “we want Trump.” I think you completely missed the bloody point; “generalizing” is a good word. And it’s funny you say we all know what’s going on when I can confidently say that the American education system and common core is a fucking joke and I could probably say a large portion of young, of age, Americans probably don’t care to or even know how to fill out a ballot. Sure, 2016 election results don’t mean much now and I’m not actually gutted by the results either, since I dislike both candidates. I didn’t support Hillary so don’t act like I’m whining that she didn’t win by popular vote. I’m just saying the electoral college doesn’t represent the general consensus of America as a whole. You hate the argument when you don’t even know what the argument was to begin with."

He very obviously loves this game, which is why he's taking the time out to find ways to make it better. Both BSG and this guy are doing good work."
Kengan_Ashura,fnd64y7,t1_fnd51y6,1586860256.0,"Which is understandable.  I can see Okubo losing to a lot of fighters in the tournament, including Saw Paing and others, but I can't say the same for Raian.

But I also think Okubo has a chance against every fighter except the ones I listed in the can't beat section. Although, some of the fighters I think Okubo *can* beat also just spell trouble. Cosmo has zone which is just an asspull where he can beat anyone as long as Yabako writes it in. Getting hit with a heart jab from Muteba spells doom. Falling to blink and getting hit with Rakshasa's palm is also not good. Rei and Bando would be extremely difficult for Okubo, and if he doesn't have it in him to kill, then Hajime and Masaki are out of the question too.

Raian on the other hand, he might be able to take some punches from and not get one shot.

In some ways, as an individual fighter, I think I put Okubo closer to Gaolang than anyone else, and I don't think Gaolang fairs much better against those guys either for the same reasons. But that's why I think Okubo vs. Gaolang would be a sick fight."
Kengan_Ashura,fnd4tuz,t1_fnd27wl,1586858795.0,"While Raian's in removal, I doubt Okubo can have a slug fest with him like Ohma did, but Okubo's an MMA professional with a much larger skill set than Mokichi and his Baritsu.

Realistically, it's a question if Okubo can find a way to last long enough until Raian's removal wears off. Considering Raian didn't use any Kure techniques at that point, I think Okubo could give Raian a run for his money with his synthesis. I think Ohma's fight vs Raian gives us some hints, since Ohma was able to land a lot of his attacks on Raian by constantly going from flame kata blows like flashing steel or ironbreaker to water kata holds and throws like guillotine or screwcutter jizo. Ohma even does something similar to Okubo with the soccer ball kick. However, I think Okubo's synthesis is more refined so it's faster than Ohma's, and I think Okubo is just physically stronger than Ohma, so he may be able to deal with the Removal this way. The only doubt I have is Okubo's speed. Hard to say how fast Okubo is, especially in manga where all we're given is speed lines, but going off the anime, I don't think Okubo can hope to match Removal Raian in this regard. But at the same time, Okuba took a lot of Kanoh's heavy hits, so he has a lot of endurance, and I can see a scenario where, if Okubo manages a throw on removal Raian, he stands a chance at keeping him at bay with synthesis.

If Okubo lasts until Raian can't use removal anymore, then I think he's fully capable of creating an opening like Ohma to mount him and pound his face in, which he tried to do in his match against Kanoh."
Kengan_Ashura,fnd1l86,t3_g0teu3,1586855119.0,"Well I think we can use a Kanoh as metric. Kanoh had to evolve in order to beat Okubo, so in my mind, he was as strong as pre-tournament Fang. Unfortunately, I think there's too little info to work with to gauge how he would fair against other fighters, especially when it comes to his conviction. In my mind, it's a game of matchups.

Fighters he can't beat: Beard, Kanoh, Ohma, Wakatsuki, Julius, Peak Hatsumi.

Toss Ups: Gaolang, Cosmo, Muteba.

Poor Matchups: Setsuna, Rei, Bando, Hajime, Masaki.

Everyone else, I think Okubo can beat, which doesn't leave much, but yes, this includes Raian.

I had explanations, but took em out since it was starting to be a wall of text, but if wanna know why for some of them, just ask I guess. Honestly, I could talk about this all day, since Okubo's one of my favorite characters after that Fang fight."

Kengan_Ashura,fn28azz,t3_fyhk20,1586580678.0,"If the tournament is set to where the winner fighters move on in a bracket, here's what I think:

Round 1: Kanoh vs Yumigahama - Kanoh Loses

Round 2: Ryuki vs Yumigahama - ???? (cuz Ryuki gotta avenge our boy Koga)

I don't really see 8th vs 6th unfortunately."
Kengan_Ashura,fn282vv,t3_fygb6b,1586580490.0,"That's what I said in another thread. This whole thing feels more like a grudge match than a tournament to see who's strongest like the Annihilation Tournament. We already have that Kanoh and Ryuki got beef with 6th Fang, and the Wu clan's got some shit on the Kure clan. Plus, Gaolang already commented on the conviction of Team Kengan; Tokuno'o, Akoya, and Julius don't seem interested."
Kengan_Ashura,fn275u5,t3_fynjte,1586579739.0,"I have bad feelings about  this whole thing. Seeing the boys out of action for so long is actually making me dread how strong/weak they've gotten, not to mention we have no idea what the Purgatory team has brought to the table. Hopefully Sandrovich-Sensei doesn't make Purgatory too stupidly OP, or else I'd be really disappointed. My gut is telling me that it's almost certain that team KA loses, and I can see a lot of these dudes losing/dying, and I say this because unlike the Annihilation Tournament, which felt like a contest to see who's stronger, this feels more like a grudge match.

However, I will say that I have high hopes for: Raian (even he does lose, if he faces the Wu clan, it's gonna be a good fight), Rihito, Misasa, and Julius.

On the other hand my mind is telling me Kanoh, Wakatsuki, and Gaolang lose unfortunately.

Ohma is honestly a swing to me. Yabako could either make him lose to make room for Koga to come back in as the chosen one, or Yabako settles on showing Ohma's recovery and growth after getting a new heart and mastering his Niko style to give Koga an even higher goal to look towards."
Kengan_Ashura,fn263xd,t3_fyjtzg,1586578881.0,"Idk about specific swap outs, but some fighters I'm really interested in seeing are Adam (he looks really strong now), Koga's uncles (he looks badass), Himuro (want to see his Jeet Kune Do and how strong he is), and of course the BEARD."

Kengan_Ashura,fn25lln,t1_fn221m2,1586578479.0,"Well, I'm not going to pretend that build and strength aren't major factors in a person's ability to fight, but we also had that line that Niko told Ohma: ""that's what martial arts are for dumbass."" While he may be physically weaker, he is far and away the best hand-to-hand combatant in the bodyguards, so I'm gonna bet he has some kick ass techniques. And realistically, if you armed anyone, no matter how small they are, with techniques like Muteba's heart jab, they're bound to be a threat."
ucla,fn200gd,t3_fyc1sg,1586574304.0,"Looking at examples for doing reductions, learning several np complete problems, understanding how to get the complexity of an algorithm, etc all helps to prepare for exams. Some more challenging topics may require some extra practice like divide & conquer and dynamic programming. Other stuff that might help to know would be Master Theorem (definitely know this), Dijkstra, Prim's, Kruskal's, Bellman-Ford, etc, but maybe cover these as you go so you don't wear yourself out.

Like the other guy said, the class actually comes in handy, especially the complexity analysis. I've also had an interview technical question that was a problem on my 180 midterm; the solution used a greedy algorithm, but a complete solution would require dynamic programming."

And no, while I do care about my fellow students, I don't care enough to pay your egregious organization anymore money, because that's not the everloving point. I read the referendum; show me that you actually plan to use the money for the things that you claim.

Don't tell me it's used to lower tuition, SHOW ME.

If I'm being honest, I'm willing to bet that if you made a survey asking the entire school if funding USAC has had any meaningful impact on their lives in a *positive* way, I'm sure the vast majority would say no or even question what it is you guys actually do. Seriously, you can't pull the wool over our eyes and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/fylv1a/update_usac_stipends_they_allocate_over_160k_for/) is a fucking joke, except I'm not really laughing."

While yes, wearing a face shield will potentially stop you from dying to 9mm to the face, you’re still probably going to die to better ammo anyways.

EscapefromTarkov,fmnaml4,t1_fmn4qn7,1586221767.0,"When I say jump, I don't mean standing still; that wouldn't make any sense, since we're concerned with a high top speed and I don't think there's any hill that you could stand still and jump off of in the game that could get you anywhere close, even if your player stood normal to the angle of the hill and jumping added a component of velocity in that direction...

But ok, I see I wasn't very clear, so allow me to clarify: I mean holding a directional key and jumping. At full sprint and jumping off at say... the hill at RUAF on customs, you can reach a considerably high top speed if done right. [This](https://imgur.com/2W2Y1WU) shows what I mean, although I think  I could have hit a higher speed and the video doesn't do it as much justice as it feels in game. The question becomes, when you jump, is the acceleration that you get as you're launched forward instantaneous or does the acceleration persist while you're in the air until you're hit the ground i.e. is it physics based or not. Empirically, I would say the former, but even so, if you look at the pipe on the right, you can sort of get a metric for how fast I'm going judging by the amount of distance I cover in that amount of time. Point is, the tolerances you apply to the system are going to be tight, and without detecting the cheat outright, simply limiting the speed of a player to instantly kick anyone above the limit doesn't eliminate the threat that a cheater could just speedhack at a lower speed (which is still pretty fast) and still destroy people.

I'm not going to dedicate enough time to thinking up a sound solution, but some things to consider would be 1. how fast a player is going 2. measuring the amount of time a player maintains a certain top speed (if the dude's zooming around the map at all times, then that's a cause for concern) 3. how long it takes for the system to detect the hacker before he does any damage (watched a guy die in 5 seconds on Labs, so probably has to be shorter than that)."
EscapefromTarkov,fmn4ci6,t1_fmn0d0v,1586217935.0,"You always have to consider that 1. there’s b-hopping 2. you can gain a considerable amount of horizontal speed jumping from an incline. You can set conditionals to handle the more extreme cases of speed hacking (except slightly more involved as you said), but you’re only lowering the bar at which they won’t get caught by a marginal amount, since you don’t want people who are using actual game mechanics to gain speed to get kicked as well. Speedhackers could just adjust their top speed to something lower and still have a massive advantage, but it’s a start I guess. And idk how it is in game dev, since I’ve yet to start unreal, but in computer graphics, the y-axis is usually “up” and z is horizontal or “into the screen”."
