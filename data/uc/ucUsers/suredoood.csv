ucla,fpdva8v,t1_fpdr0qe,1588534942.0,"The issue is you can't treat people's lives as a lab experiment. It's never as easy as rinse and retry...

Students that have shit professors have the option of P/NP up until week 10 with no penalty. Not everybody will be happy either way, but the fact that *most* professors are being lenient this quarter means that the overall benefit comes from just riding this out. Not to mention that if we force P/NP nearly guarantees that many students will simply not attempt to learns as much as if they had letter grades.

If you really want to go the ""rinse and repeat"" route, you really just need to cancel the quarter outright, because nobody is learning as effectively as they otherwise would, so having these classes on their transcripts is misrepresentative of their knowledge compared to others."
YangGang,fpdla2b,t1_fpd1zfm,1588529220.0,This needs to be higher up. Nobody makes cash purchases over a few hundred dollars. If we didn't develop an internet-based monetary system you could argue that by now we'd need higher bills but most purchases are cards anyways.
ucla,fpd6059,t1_fpc1qfo,1588520553.0,"Thing is it's also unfair to force people to take a gap year just so they can get either the same or worse grades. Whereas those who have shitty professors right now are definitely going to be excused by whatever grad school/professional school they're applying to.

Literally everybody is going to understand bad grades in this time and probably ignore them. Forcing people to take an extra year of school is 1) probably going to cost them money and 2) going to set them back a year in their career when there isn't really a good reason to do so."

dataisbeautiful,fp2wirn,t1_fp2bjwk,1588269062.0,"Total energy consumed is akin to position

Energy demand is akin to velocity since energy demand dictates how fast the amount of energy consumed all time is increasing(speed can't be negative)

Change in energy demand is akin to acceleration

In a lot of scenarios (thought not all), if a number is hovering above and below zero, theres a good chance its a second derivative function (change of a change) similar to acceleration."
changemyview,foym2c2,t3_ga6umx,1588174954.0,"I'm going to mainly focus on traffic fines with my argument. 

If you impose fines increasing based on income, this leads to a very bad incentive for law enforcement officers to prioritize the higher income offenders when deciding who should be pulled over. This leads to a form of skewed pullovers which will likely end up with people being afraid of driving more expensive cars in a similar manner to where everybody is afraid of driving red cars ever since the correlation of red cars being pulled over more often was discovered.

This already happens with cops doing it for purely psychological reasons with things like sports cars but imagine if they would also fill their quota faster by doing so."

ucla,foqq2w6,t3_g8qyq7,1587998745.0,"They're new, but in my experience (anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt) newer professors are more likely to be easier than harder. And with the whole virus thing the professors are being encouraged to grade easier.

My friend emailed her professor asking for advice bc she wanted to drop but he told her he's only grading on an A to B+ scale. Again, not representative of those biochem professors but just so you get an idea of what the climate is like right now."

WTF,fntjiq9,t1_fntdn1n,1587242916.0,"Dogs and cats have been bred to be easily domesticated. I doubt these birds have had enough generations as well as actual breeding happening to separate them from their wild counterparts. So it's more like keeping wolves as hunters rather than say a bloodhound.

The issue is about the psychology of the animal, not just the fact that they're animals. If dogs are happy to work for us in exchange for food and shelter and love then so be it, but wolves would not be inclined to make the same exchange. The ethics of breeding to change inherent psychology and whether or not you want to call that slavery is a separate discussion. But if you want to decide which of those two you're comparing it too, it's definitely the wolves (unless that species of bird was bred)."

ucla,fnsmw7t,t3_g3hvk5,1587224858.0,"Just thought I'd chime in here with model recommendations. So there's basically two options here, the regular iPad or the Pro. I've used the older iPad Pro (which is now essentially the same as the first iPad in terms of user experience) and the 2018 model which is almost identical to the new 2020 model.

I would just buy a standard iPad and apple pencil from r/appleswap as the only real differences are the form factor (yes, the pro looks MUCH nicer) and the screen frame rate (the pro is a buttery-smooth 120Hz). That being said, those upgrades are not in any way worth the $600 extra cost difference. The standard iPads are honestly amazing and show how far we've come in making good technology so accessible."

PleX,fn0pblc,t1_fn047s8,1586546186.0,"I think it also has to do with people actually caring to pay attention to stuff like compression loss.

Strangely enough, this doesn't even have to do with tech-literacy because I know plenty of people who are exactly like this but definitely have at least a good baseline understanding of technology.
