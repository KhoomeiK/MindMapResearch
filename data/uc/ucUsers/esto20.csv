I'm planning to use R as an alternative to using JMP for the analysis component of a green house experiment measuring fungal pathogensis on drought stressed plants. So mainly, I would need it for data visualization and and conducting tests. I've had a TA recommend looking into ggplot2 and he provided a cheat sheet. 

However, I feel like I should learn syntax and maybe conduct some basic statistical tests to get my feet wet. I'm also interested into looking at ecological modeling later on once I graduate and what not. I was wondering if you knew of any great resources to understand the basics?"

WhitePeopleTwitter,fo0y8zm,t1_fo0e24v,1587422047.0,"Does it really matter at this point? I wouldn't do the same but I also wouldn't hold any responsibility on top of them either. If popular votes and actual number of votes and participation means jack all, then it's completely understandable to have 0 faith in that process and refuse to participate.  Especially when the people in power that like to maintain this electoral system refuse to acknowledge direct democracy and frankly don't give a shit if not everyone votes, only if the voting outcome is in favor of their interests which has been shown time and time again, even as we speak. 

Hold that moral judgement on inequitable democracy and above the perpetrators that encourage it. Shaming people for being frustrated to the point where it feels like their voice doesn't even fucking matter is a bit arbitrary and counter-productive to using that energy towards abolishing our electoral process."
marijuanaenthusiasts,fo0dwkc,t1_fnvofoz,1587411265.0,"That was great thanks. I guess what I was viewing or my perspective of viewing the gif is based on ""tree planting"" efforts that are the super trendy next big thing for philanthropic ™ altruists. Most of these efforts don't understand the basic fundamentals that would ensure a healthy system for decades. 

Meaning I viewed this as an effort to ""replanting"" and as someone pursuing restoration ecology, it is fairly cringy as many of these efforts are far off base. But I now realize it was part of industrial forestry which you pointed out so it was a misunderstanding on my part. It definitely is better than industrial agricultural practices. 

I've actually been really interested in agroforestry, my professor's lab is actually looking into conducting more research as it would benefit communities that inhabit forested areas. 

I'm glad you're passionate, passion for ecology or any natural science is highly infectious and is totally rad. Appreciate your post."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fo0cpoh,t1_fnzuw3h,1587410453.0,"I understand this; however, if people believe in the power of electoralism, shouldn't we be voting for people that we feel are representing us? Isn't that the point of voting, to vote for the person that best represents your ideas?

This isn't a point or argument for not voting, more of a point for people like me that vote third party for some fringe candidate because we feel that they represent our beliefs more. And if people truly believe in the power of voting in our current system, we're choosing who best represents us. 

I understand the implications of your trolley problem, I just don't think that it addresses the problem of the current system betraying everyone enough. Energy spent pointing fingers at each other needs to be spent fixing our democratic process as it is the anti-thesis of democracy."
