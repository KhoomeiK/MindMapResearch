learnmath,forqqed,t1_formc3o,1588016838.0,"Yes! he is an amazing professor, totally changed how I view linear algebra."
learnmath,for6ilb,t1_fope83l,1588007008.0,For linear algebra I highly recommend Gilbert Strang’s Series on MIT courseware’s YouTube channel
UCSD,fopw9l7,t3_g8vujq,1587974247.0,"I’m in mostly lower div classes and in two of my classes while the quizzes are open notes, the avg are around 50-60% so yea I study and I think I’m now knowing why the avg are so low lol"
learnmath,fooq6v7,t1_fonvdth,1587944134.0,"Not sure if you’ve done linear algebra, but if you haven’t make sure to check out Gilbert Strang’s series on Linear Algebra on YouTube through MIT coursewares channel."
math,fo5ilwd,t3_g5ckgc,1587526539.0,"Thank you so much, I just got recommended a book by one of my TAs and its in here !"
UCSD,fnv0m8c,t1_fnuzo1j,1587276430.0,Same
UCSD,fnp00f2,t1_fnod3w2,1587136806.0,"yikes, thanks though! I was also thinking since I’m
Taking 24 units rn it won’t feel as bad if I
Just take se101a since I’ll just be focusing on that one class."
UCSD,fnnwpea,t1_fnnv61q,1587104094.0,Thanks! I will most likely take the course
UCSD,fnnbeog,t3_g2rpqr,1587088566.0,"Shoulda taken 2c.. I’m so glad I didn’t  take 7c, Luckily had the choice between 7c and 2c"
UCSD,fnlzah8,t1_fnlp93j,1587062348.0,True one of my prof is like a week ahead with lectures lmao. It kinda makes me feel like I’m behind but then I check the schedule and I’m realize I’m fine.
UCSD,fnkdj6g,t1_fnk9nqg,1587023060.0,Yea this is how I felt when it took MCWP40. I hope 50 is better
UCSD,fnin58i,t3_g1xpms,1586982889.0,"I submitted mine on Monday of week 1 and got it approved the following Monday. But then it takes another day for the course to show on canvas, good luck!"
math,fngjusj,t1_fngjs37,1586934551.0,my bad i meant lower division level courses in undergrad. I’ll edit it rn thanks!
math,fnghx1w,t1_fnggk6l,1586932774.0,"Yea they pretty much have a course for lower level undergrad math courses you’d see at a uni. Up too Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, linear Algebra interesting but I’d suggest Gilbert Strang’s Linear Algebra series! 

I think khan academy has section called also discrete mathematics but not sure what it contains.. but yea khan academy has plenty too keep you busy!"
UCSD,fnfgzms,t3_g1ghti,1586907866.0,Yea ^ my appointment isn’t until the 16. & I’m also planning on taking physics 2c!
UCSD,fncs8sp,t3_g0whst,1586845520.0,Search up “Linear Algebra Gilbert Strang” on YouTube. I think that’ll help
UCSD,fn52b9f,t1_fn51bel,1586654244.0,thanks and you do too!
UCSD,fn4za8q,t1_fn4xlo5,1586652268.0,"yea same. I’m still stuck taking mostly lower div courses, so I’m taking advantage rn lol"
UCSD,fn4z4ui,t1_fn4vchk,1586652171.0,"I just bought one too, and also set myself up a study space in the garage lol so I’m taking full advantage of this & also taking 5 classes. Yikes wish me luck"
UCSD,fmuurwl,t1_flwlsue,1586399346.0,"For the timeline we have to declare a double major, the units it’s talking about are UC units right ? so it won’t take into considerations units you enter with, for example from ap exams ?"
UCSD,fmul3rw,t1_fmujx8k,1586393525.0,"ok, I’ll make sure to talk to them beforehand. Thanks!"
UCSD,fmuh73f,t1_fmu07wv,1586391341.0,"I had a question, it’s happened multiple  times now where I get disconnected from zoom for a couple mins and then connects me back.

If this were to happen during an exam, would I get marked down for suspicion or how would the prof and TA’s go about this ? (Luckily most of my exams are ‘take-home’)"
UCSD,fmncdvn,t1_fmnbn17,1586222896.0,Yikes
UCSD,fmnccs0,t1_fmn4n62,1586222878.0,"most my math classes have weekly quizzes, so we’ll see how those go lol"
UCSD,fmnbzs0,t1_fmnazag,1586222644.0,"Yea me neither, and I got mine approved on Friday (submitted my request on last Monday at 9am)"
UCSD,fma0l2a,t1_fm9znjy,1585880888.0,is your request also waiting college approval ? this is stressing me out lol
