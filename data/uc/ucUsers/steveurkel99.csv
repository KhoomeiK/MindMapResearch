Python,fomgrij,t3_g87ozi,1587889432.0,"Just gonna give a couple pointers cuz they may help down the line:
1. There's no need to count the lines in the file, just iterate over the lines in the file!
2. The line.replace(' ','') not in ['\n', '\r\n'] is a cool workaround, but just use line.rstrip() and string truthiness instead, it was made for this purpose.
3. More of a question. Why the need to copy the whole file into another file? Im confused as to what this accomplished besides eliminating empty lines, which I presume could've been ignored when iterating line by line in the main function."

UCI,fnwtf89,t3_g4dce6,1587325092.0,People I know dont seem to think it makes a huge difference. That's true of pretty much all honors colleges though. You will get priority enrollment which is a big perk.

Coronavirus,fmvhgcw,t1_fmvgira,1586417122.0,"But it says median. It would make sense as an average, but not as a median. The only time a median is an average is if there are 2 middling values in the sorted list of values, in which case those are averaged. I don't understand why this median would not be a whole number"
computerscience,fmu57jm,t3_fxcjsp,1586384805.0,"Here's an example of a nested algorithm:

Go to the store and buy me these things: 
1 dozen Eggs
1 gallon Milk

Algoritm for eggs:
Iterate theough all the eggs and find the cheapest ones available that aren't cracked. If they're cracked, take the next-cheapest one, and so on

Algoritm for milk:
Look at the top shelf of the refrigerator. Iterate through and find the most expensive one.

There's 1 algorithm telling you what to buy, and 2 sub-algorithms that tell you how to do each of those things. I hope this helps"
