Stats 20 should prepare you well enough for this course.

But if you are eyeing for grad school, probably should take Stats 133+134 or Stats 140 instead of stats 20 or W21."
berkeley,fo58nc7,t3_g5qog7,1587519905.0,They are not related. Econ 140 is a stats class and it's pretty difficult
berkeley,fo4w873,t1_fo0y86h,1587512432.0,It's a bit unfair to judge like that. There are some people like me who have a short memory. Always do well on the midterms because I remember stuff and do soooo poorly on the final exam because I remember nothing and even reviewing for a whole week won't save me.
berkeley,fo4uxjk,t3_g59wgm,1587511712.0,Just late drop the class and escape from the sanction lol. The staff will not grade your stuff if you late drop and write a thank you letter and tell them you have dropped the class. Take cs70 next semester.
berkeley,fo4uftv,t3_g55gfw,1587511431.0,"I would suggest you late drop the class before you confess or they catch you cheating. If so, I assure that nothing will happen to you. It's the safest strategy you should consider. Once you late drop I don't think they will grade your homework. Take CS 70 next semester and it will probably be taught online as well.

YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY BEST OFF IF YOU LATE DROP!"

berkeley,fnzws4l,t3_g4jvei,1587402097.0,"If you would like to go to grad school, then the suggested courses are bullshit. They ensure your graduation but does not prepare your for PhD econ courses. I suggest you taking math 53 54 104, stats 134 135 150 151A while you are at cal. Pack yourself with as much math as possible. EEP suggests you taking math 16A/ 16B, that is a joke. Talk to an advisor to see if you can waive them using math 53 and 54."
berkeley,fnzwfvy,t3_g4jvei,1587401928.0,Are you going to grad schools?
berkeley,fnzw93a,t3_g4oh5q,1587401836.0,"Do it next semester with Hug. 

Professor Hilfinger is a terrible lecturer. You learn nothing from his lectures."
berkeley,fnzvuhx,t3_g4flws,1587401642.0,"Also, what is your intended major?  It really depends on your major here. 

I'm double majoring in Economics and Data Science.

I got gpa 3.85 for all my Economics courses. I really did not study for any of them... That major is so easy and grades are so inflated yet still the most popular ones at Cal. If you feel uncomfortable about yourself, maybe you can start with this major. Investment banks, financial institutes, grad schools all like this major. I'm sure you will have the happiest 4 years in your life and still gain a decent income after graduation.

But for data science courses, I got like 2.9 GPA.... I'm literally lost in every single data science, CS, and stats class. Especially for stats classes, professors are terrible cuz they teach you how to ride a toddler's bike and then ask you to drive a car in homework and exams.....That's how I feel. There are many smarter kids who can easily learn from the same material and generalize those concepts to difficult problems. Not me, unfortunately.

I was accepted as a Chemical Engineering student in freshman year. I really regret that. Although even now I'm still a big fan of chemistry and materials and still read some research papers during my free time, I was suffocated when taking that major. The workload of chemical engineering (or any engineering) is like taking three liberal arts majors at the same time. For chemical engineering, you have to learn chemistry, chemical engineering, physics, bioengineering, biology, material science, physical chemistry, and so on.... AND freshman physics and chemistry classes can kill your confidence. It's very common to get many Bs..."
berkeley,fnztxu0,t3_g4flws,1587400701.0,"UCB 3.4 GPA vs UCSD 3.9 GPA with very similar internship&research backgrounds. 

The recruiters take the second student.

That's how cruel and crazy the world is right now.

berkeley,fnz0b26,t3_fgj7es,1587382181.0,"Don't take stats 140 with cs 61b....

You know that 61b is hardcore, BUT you don't know that:

Stats 140 has way more workload than other stats class like 134 and 135

Every year, professor Adhikari has enough free time to write new homework and lab so good luck you won't be able to find ""solution"" online.

The labs are long and homework is hard. Support is very limited as the gsi's are not allowed to say anything more detailed than ""think about this question again"" on piazza.

It is indeed a very hardcore course."
