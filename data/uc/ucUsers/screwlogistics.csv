berkeley,fpani42,t3_gc6da4,1588451818.0,"Hey, awesome photo! Can I ask where you found this photo? 

I am looking to compile some information on the history of the Reserve Officer Training Corps Program here at UC Berkeley. (Much of the documentation and photographic history was lost in a fire in 1985) And it looks like those are Army Cadets getting their hair cut. 

The Student in the background is wearing the standard Army uniform for the time period  (Campaign hat, tunic, gaiters). 

The individual in the chair is wearing leather gaiters with their boots which is consistent with the Army uniform at the time.

Edit: You can also see two uniform tunics and a campaign hat hung up on a pole on the far right of the photo. I assume those belong to the individuals getting their hair cut."

I know you said outside, but just a forewarning that there are also smoke detectors in every dorm room. Tampering with the detector or setting off the detector carries fines. 

That all said, I'm not here to stop you from smoking, I just want you to know the policies so you don't find yourself in hot water here."

The only con I've seen is the Streamlight Tape Switch isn't as reliable as surefire. BUT Arisaka sells an adapter tail cap that lets your streamlight accept sure fire tape switches. 
I would recommend getting the upgraded tail cap and also an Arisaka Scout Mount. They are a great, low profile MLOK mounting option."
