SeattleWA,foipgi2,t1_foiiupn,1587792902.0,You might be right that it's harmful. My point was that it isn't socialism so let's not call it that.
SeattleWA,foihw38,t1_foigcv2,1587787046.0,It's not socialism just because the government does something. Socialism is when the means of production are socialized. Here both the restaurants and the delivery companies are still private.

magicthecirclejerking,fochsje,t1_fobg29x,1587671479.0,"People at my table proxy cards, but we set an $800 deck cap for all players. Real or proxies. It keeps the game accessible and fun.

Putting $ constraints can also make the deck building more interesting. Without a cap Mana Crypt is an auto add in every proxy deck. With it, Mana Crypt will wipe out 1/4 of your deck budget."
magicthecirclejerking,focfy2d,t1_fobf8s0,1587670867.0,"I'm all for proxying, I do it heavily myself. But the point of proxying isn't to play a cEDH deck at a casual table. It sounds to me like you are trying to defy the color pie and complaining that it is expensive to do so."

personalfinance,fnldg9f,t1_fnlajhu,1587051606.0,"> The crazy part is that if you pay the disability insurance for them, it’s subject to all taxes, including state disability.  It’s a circular calculation that you have to use a formula to get right.

Taxes, where summing an infinite geometric series is a single step in the process. I hope you remember your calculus classes!"
