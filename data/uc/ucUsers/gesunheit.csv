AskReddit,fn2paqk,t3_fz0cpc,1586597809.0,"This year has been so hard so far. My car got totalled by a texting teenager. Right after, I lost the job that I spent half a year finding after just a month. Right after that, our washing machine died, and its two (2!) subsequent replacements were DOA despite being brand new. Going on two months with no laundry. Which is really shitty timing because the dogs got fleas, which are now back with a vengeance after an unsuccessful purge. (One that required SEVEN industrial washers at the laundromat). We also lost a bunch of money in some investments. Trying to be grateful for what I do have - a support network, and our health. I just hope and pray to God that the rest is this year goes better. Sorry that didn't really answer the question but I just needed to get that out, haven't put this all together before now, and am feeling overwhelmed by the road so far."

AskReddit,fmvh14q,t1_fmv7xht,1586416690.0,"I had this realization while tripping acid in the shower the other day. Hit me like a train. What's the purpose of living, when in the end I'll die and be like every other molecule in the universe?

But then I realized that the brain is the only part of the universe that thinks about itself. It's like... the universe is putting on a grand show, and life persists so ardently to make sure that someone, something is watching it. Yes, the universe will die one day, but all shows end. At least while life persists, this firework display that is creation gets a round of applause."
