UCSD,fpfixax,t1_fpdugck,1588572644.0,"... do you genuinely believe that clubs whose primary membership are either white or Asian are friends cause they’re of the same race? You’re making too many assumptions about how these people even become friends. This is coming from someone in a club whose “racial demographic” is mostly Asian. 

I don’t understand the point of bringing race into it when the friendships start within and because of the club."

Oh my god this times 1000. Not only does joining some sort of org. look better on your resumé and help give you a sense of belonging, but it also helps build the skills you need for after UCSD. I can't tell you how many times I've sat in a board meeting for an org. and felt giddy because I felt like I found my people.

I hate the ""socially dead"" cloud that shrouds UCSD because I'd consider myself a social butterfly but I'm *intentionally* ""socially dead"". I pay a lot of money to attend an institution whose math and CS departments are at the top of their game, especially for a public institution, so I intend on spending as much of my time studying the things I'm there to study as possible.

Side note: the math department... wow no matter how much I feel like I don't belong, I still love it so much. The concentration of sheer intelligence in APM is staggering.

>but I don't think people are socially inept

You're absolutely right. Man, some of my favorite people I've met at UCSD are really quiet and shy international students, the same people who might be considered ""socially inept"" by OP. Sometimes all it takes is to talk to them and *try* to be their friend. I miss them so much. I wish I could talk to them in real life about the PAs.

UCSD has such mixed reviews from the student body and I think the negativity stems from inflated expectations people have about college. Not to invalidate OP's experiences, however, because I know even if you try to enjoy it, things can find a way to take a turn for the worst. One thing I've told my transfer friends is that your experience at UCSD isn't defined by what you're *supposed* to do, but rather what you *actually do*. To me, UCSD isn't ""UC Socially Dead"", it's ""UC Sit down and Do work""."

Your HS offers math courses in sets, logic, and combinatorics? That's impressive."

iamverysmart,fmuf9dy,t1_fmtkh6p,1586390250.0,"Understandable. UCs especially just have such robust research programs that the people teaching the classes, albeit while they’re less attentive than they would be at a CC, are leading experts in their respective fields. 

Not to say that professors at a CC aren’t/can’t, but you don’t generally associate the professors at a CC with that level of expertise. 

I’m really just not *used* to that from California CCs. I’m not from California, so it blew my mind that my roommate who transferred to our UC had actually taken classes at his CC with professors from our UC. Always been jealous of the California education system."
