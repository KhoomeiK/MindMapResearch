USC,fpmc916,t3_geaqmi,1588729947.0,I am guessing you are done with finals and have started celebrating with a bit of hooch. X-)
USC,fplow82,t3_gdguyq,1588716679.0,your spring insurance fee is more than the fall because it covers summer. Unless something has changed?
USC,fplok90,t1_fplcodz,1588716498.0,good point .. and most PhD programs do not cost anything.. except for blood sweat and tears I guess..
USC,fplo43y,t3_ge4drq,1588716258.0,You don't have to take it but I suggest that you do. There have been many scholarships internships and jobs that I have applied for that have asked for my scores. All of them actually. Hope this helps!
USC,fpb55b0,t1_fpadsym,1588462319.0,yeah.. it can take a while sometimes to update. I don't know why.
USC,fpb4xlq,t1_fpach1s,1588462192.0,you will be fine :) Everyone adjusts to it eventually..

""yeah.., I was involved in COVID research during the outbreak of 2020 while I was working in a hospital"" X-)"

USC,fp5qgu8,t1_fp49v7e,1588337468.0,"Totally, but the thing is you can have both covid and the flu at the same time because they are not in the same family. (however statistically unlikely) Also, I scratch my head every time someone says that we had a very bad flu season because that fact suggests that our flu season was unusual. A reason our flu season was unusual could have been due to covid. x-)  Of course that depends on our measure.  its a circular weird statement but I honestly dont know enough about it. I appreciate your work at the hospital! I would send you a thank you gift for your efforts but that would be weird. Fight on!"

USC,fp42ula,t3_gb2dpa,1588290590.0,Cool.. ill check it out.. I honestly hate discord with a passion.. but I be a trojanman.
USC,fp377dm,t1_fp2tr4x,1588274288.0,you said that your hospital did not get a case of COVID until mid-march and that everyone that had symptoms such as.. cough  or fever etc tested positive for the flu. So I guess you were implying that you were also testing people for COVID before march along with testing for the flu? It didn't make any sense when I read it anyway.. no worries.  fight on and be safe at the hospital!
USC,fp35eg3,t3_gaw969,1588273386.0,why would you take a w or an f this semester??
USC,fp1eszj,t3_gamn6s,1588233120.0,I should have voted
USC,fp0ie1f,t1_fowiqmc,1588209881.0,I'm still blown away by the resources your hospital must have to be able to run a rt-pcr test for everyone with flu-like symptoms as far back as jan/feb.
USC,fp060el,t3_g9ysl3,1588203138.0,"Look, 95% of our classes can be taught online without an issue. 

In most classes, if a professor says open book open note its time to panic.

Unless you are taking a class on memorization I doubt cheating is a real issue. If it is, you might want to make sure you don't take that professor next semester/ever."

USC,fowumjc,t1_foo4oi8,1588127501.0,"I have no idea really. I read you can chill with friends and watch movies or whatever but the problem here is my imagination. In my head, everything is crazy awesome compared to reality. I pulled the trigger and ordered one so I guess well see."
USC,fowu78p,t1_folkfxl,1588127239.0,what are you streaming?
USC,fovo2na,t3_g9c953,1588104588.0,I don't think there are any practice ones.  Other schools have online practice exams though (UC). They are the same. The placement tests are only for determining if you need to be placed in remedial math courses. They are very basic. The grades/scores you bring with you will allow you to start beyond those provided you don't blow it. Even if you do blow it you can still take the course you want if you sign a waiver and do the jig. Fight on! and welcome to the club.
USC,fotrxfl,t3_g9ea2o,1588063962.0,"5th grade for having ""snap-n-pops"""
USC,for4auk,t3_g93ciw,1588005933.0,"Yes, you can transfer units. But only before you are enrolled. Once you enroll, only courses taken during a summer semester will be considered for transfer credit.  USC is picky about which classes can transfer though and you need to talk to your admissions counselor.  Being a spring admit will not impact anything. You were placed into spring not because you suck."
USC,for1rph,t1_foq3e04,1588004690.0,Awesome. I am an rpg junkie. Thanks for the suggestions.
USC,fone0zi,t3_g83ltt,1587917687.0,I'm thinking of buying a VR headset. This would be a perfect time right? I don't want to throw it in my closet after a few hours. thoughts?
USC,fomun6t,t1_folnf5u,1587904367.0,I have been looking for a new game but I can't find anything that I want to play. thinking about buying an oculus but don't want it to end up in my closet after a few hours.
USC,fomuhn2,t1_folmo5j,1587904231.0,Good advice. Maybe I will dive into python. Its time that I admit that it might maybe sorta be useful for something. I just finished a new budget build myself. First time that I walked away without cutting my hand so that's a win.
USC,fomti9a,t1_foltyui,1587903300.0,im listening to it now. not shitty at all.
USC,fomt2jt,t1_fomejua,1587902868.0,"thats pretty deep.. I think I can relate, if only tangentially. It took this crisis for my friend and I to realize how important we are to each other and now we are ~5,250 miles apart. :/  Pretty excited and totally crushed at the same time. is that a thing? bleh.."
USC,fol4egu,t3_fybnif,1587854665.0,Easy A.. tests are basic. Take it with sule-guney if you can but it doesn't matter.. this stuff is taught the same way everywhere. 317 is the same. You won't be challenged. Everyone taking these two courses suck at math so you won't have much to worry about. No curve or anything. A group project and a presentation + paper + 2 midterms.
USC,fol2jfi,t3_g7hme0,1587853620.0,"There was this quiet girl in my phil class, philosophy of the mind. The few times she opened her mouth she said something that blew me away. I think I am still crushing on her a year later.

USC,fol0du4,t3_g7qity,1587852410.0,I live north at Ellendale which is close. One-room studio \~400 sq is 1600-1800. Utils are about 200. It's mostly all graduate students.. safe fun close to campus.

USC,fo6ysbm,t3_g5vinp,1587569214.0,There are plenty of jobs on campus. People who say otherwise are prob goofballs.. every job i have applied for on campus i have landed over the years be it research office work or it. Some will give you a stipend some will give you hourly. Expect min wage with no more than 20 hrs/week unless stipen. Stipeneds are usually for research.

USC,fnzyu2q,t3_g4uw96,1587403118.0,Why not pick up a minor? There is nothing wrong with being practical but happiness is important. Do not change majors. You will regret it later in life. The world needs engineers. The world does not need marketers. My dad hires engineers all the time for creative projects and special teams at his job. He works at wb studios. If you are a creative and an engineer then you are special. Pick up a minor or certificate. Fight on!

USC,fnxt55x,t3_g1ee03,1587345794.0,Yeah.. the brick is not only fake its a facade.. they are only an inch or two thick on the newer buildings. My dad pointed it out to me. He said that they use the same stuff at WB studio where he works. It's pretty much standard now in Cali. And cheaper.

genetics,fmvj7mf,t1_fmvfnhp,1586418921.0,"worthy endeavor! Heres the thing.. Most of the libraries out there, while very useful, are essentially used as shortcuts to make your life easier as a coder. Thats great and all but everything in these libraries you can actually do on your own and you should probably give that a shot first. Typically I use specific libraries because I dont want to write something I already know how to write from scratch. Now that I have patronized you enough, when I write something in python I sometimes use scripts from tensorflow and scipy but I do so sparingly. As you probably guessed, I do a lot of maths. Honestly though, I am more of a c guy... Hope this helps! and stick with R!.. you wont regret that decision."
USC,fmvdrj1,t1_fmv6dbr,1586413521.0,oh yeah.. smart and final not food for less  xD  I used to walk by there all the time.. never knew.. thanks for the tip!
genetics,fmvdj21,t3_fwsg7v,1586413300.0,"The answer is.. kinda sorta?. But, good news. You don't have to code in c or asm. There is a programming language called python designed for people just like you. Its easier to learn and takes little time and effort. It is a very abstract language and is perfect for someone who would rather be doing something else. Also, if you rather skip programming, sorta, and you are ok with a little math, stick with learning the ropes of ""R"". It usually goes hand in hand with the likes of python (c for me) but you can learn how to use it on its own. That might be more for you. At the end of the day, you should at least know enough to talk shop. Everyone is going to have their specialty but it's a good thing to be able to communicate with the people in your lab even at a basic level. I struggle with my lab manager sometimes because of the communication thing but at the end of the day she will draw me a picture of what she wants.. literally. and that usually works out."

genetics,fmvau8u,t3_fxlecg,1586410913.0,"Libraries?  in python they are ""modules"" but some call them libraries! in C we call them libraries so your good .. you will be fine with the standard library that comes with python to start.  R is very important if you are into stats. And you should be :) but that usually comes bundled along with whatever ide your using.. pycharm ,visual studio, etc... or are you talking about gene libraries?"
USC,fmv8gzo,t1_fmv4ge6,1586408944.0,"yeah. My beliefs are irrelevant at this point.  When I have to go out I have gloves mask etc.. I am more concerned about spreading the virus than catching it. I sorta have to be where I work. On that note, I am more afraid of people atm than the I am the virus. People are saying hysterical things and most of what they tell me stems from something they heard on the news. Its fear mongering money grubbing ratings fanatical bull and every single graph, set of numbers, headline.. everything is misleading and designed to keep you watching breathless. its crap. all of it.. period. If the s**t hits the fan, and people we know start dying, it wont be directly from covid. Where I work, the administration wont allow anyone turn on the news in the waiting area. If they would present the data in a factual meaningful way, it would make a difference. So yeah.. I'm ok with the numbers I posted. I do feel you though and am sorry if I upset you. Sort of the opposite effect than I was going for.. fight on"

USC,fmrr2eh,t3_fx1wqs,1586332370.0,I am just hunkered down atm.. focusing on my classes. I am way ahead for the first time so that's pretty cool.  I am actually learning more. My suggestion is to stay away from watching the news. Most of it is bs and is designed to freak you out so you keep watching.  I read that there are now 370ish deaths in California from covid.. that means that it almost beats how many deaths occurred from accidental bathtub drownings..  More people have died from accidentally poisoning themselves than all the people who are sick.  There's some perspective xD from the actual numbers.. your shower is far more dangerous than this virus. Don't stress.. I have been playing a lot of online games lately which is cool because of the social interaction side of it..  I don't know anything about cheating.. I just had a coding exam online and it went fine. I'm writing some new software for a class and I spent so much time on it that I think I have learned more in the last few weeks than the last few months... hang tight bro and  Fight on!

USC,fmkdtqo,t3_ftobl4,1586151679.0,my pops said it was the same way when he was here but it was with a different group of international students (before the Chinese got rich). I agree that it is awful but we should make it clear that we are not pointing fingers at any particular group. It's the schools fault really but it does help to cover some of our tuition so I guess there's that part.
