UCSD,fp3ey9q,t1_fp3edw2,1588278128.0,Same. The very generalized response from the UC/CSU system regarding keeping our money is extremely tone deaf and pretty disgusting.
UCSD,fo0rss2,t1_fo0rj0n,1587418572.0,Getting ghosted by your school just hits so different.
UCSD,fo0rhsl,t3_g50yag,1587418411.0,I've literally sent 3 unanswered e-mails to financial aid about it.
UCSD,fnupuom,t1_fnu4pw1,1587268015.0,"To my knowledge, it doesn't require prior scribing experience but it significantly helps. I know that for tele-scribes, they gave priority to the in clinic scribes first because they already have knowledge of how to navigate through the EHR and they have a rapport with some of the doctors already.

Be sure to check the SA website everyday, bc all of the outpatient doctors that I work with are transitioning over but its not all at once. There will be spots that need to get filled up! If you need a referral for SA, just send me a PM!"
UCSD,fntrqgc,t3_g2whlw,1587247430.0,"I worked as the chief scribe at my hospital before transferring to UCSD. Right now, there is a huge demand for telemedicine scribes as many specialists are transitioning to Zoom or other tele-med programs to see their patients. But if you are going to apply, do it quickly because spots are filling up pretty quickly. 

Also, you can look up the new California Health Corps. initiative. If you have any certs, you might be able to find something. Otherwise, now is a great time to make your application a bit stronger by doing volunteer work. Making masks/face shields/working at food banks etc.

This is a really difficult time for us though, I gotta admit. Hope this helps."
