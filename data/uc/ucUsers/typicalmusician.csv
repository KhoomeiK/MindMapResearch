AmItheAsshole,fp7i600,t1_fp77y9r,1588371077.0,lmao I bet he's in one of those Mensa facebook groups that don't actually require you to be a member of Mensa. What a tiresome person
AskReddit,foxq16d,t1_fovvfx1,1588152242.0,"Out of the 70ish replies I've received, this is the one that resonates with my issues the most. Thank you so much for your advice. For me, I tend to judge the ""cool"" people AND the ""not normal"" people. The groups ""above"" me are people older than me and people that appear more confident/intelligent than me (although the ""cool"" people are ""above"" me in terms of social ability). I started realizing this kind of hierarchical thinking wasn't healthy about two months ago but had no idea how to fix this thinking. After all the coronavirus stuff is over, I'll try my best to apply your advice!"
AskReddit,fothj67,t1_fotg0z2,1588054115.0,That's really cool! What have you been doing since then?
AskReddit,fot88ul,t1_fot7mpe,1588046928.0,The whole notion of suffering you describe and the concept of enlightenment sounds very Buddhist (from my limited knowledge of Buddhism haha). Interesting! Thanks for your description. I've thought about trying out psychedelics but I am a very anxious person and I'm worried that I'll end up having a bad trip due to my anxiety.
AskReddit,fot609a,t1_fos0lcr,1588045426.0,What specifically happened in that trip to make you motivated?
AskReddit,fot5x15,t1_fot4812,1588045367.0,"By saying your motivation will never come back, you are reinforcing that belief and through that reinforcement, you are making it true. But it doesn't have to be true. It takes a change of mindset, and while it isn't easy, it's possible."
nintendo,fokgffe,t3_g7vuf0,1587841597.0,"I've been fulfilling my New Years Resolution and lost a lot of weight, 30 pounds so far. By the time I feel safe enough to go outside after the quarantine is lifted, the first thing I'm going to do is go to the beach in a new swimsuit I'll actually feel comfortable wearing, and then get the biggest order of sushi I've ever gotten (haha rip my weight loss). I used to have (cheap) sushi in some form at least twice a week before lockdown and my family has refused to get takeout since over a month ago. I will cry when I take that first bite of sushi."
CasualConversation,fo90kp9,t3_g66y61,1587607843.0,"I don't think it's bad at all. I think it's bad of your sister to judge you for your dreams (but of course I don't know her so she might not be a bad person, just someone having a bad moment)."
iamverysmart,fo905p5,t3_g69a3j,1587607575.0,"Wow, I've been reading the other posts of his that you sent in the comments and they're so fucking funny. Pls send more! Also this dude sounds like he's at the very beginning of the graph of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Did he take an intro to physics course in college and suddenly think he knows everything about the subject? I feel so bad for you because you have to deal with this guy, and I feel bad for him because he's just exposing his stupidity over and over."
UCSD,fnzo3qd,t1_fnytg72,1587397717.0,"Yeah same. I'm just kind of worried about fake friends if I join a sorority. But I really didn't make a whole lot of friends this last year and I want to make more, so Greek life seems like the best way to do it. I'll need to get the shitty stereotypes about Greek life out of my head though; I'm definitely guilty of judging members of Greek life and it hasn't helped me."
dating_advice,fnwrmy7,t3_g44iw5,1587324092.0,Thank you for this. I think it goes the same way for self-worth. I constantly look for outside validation and I'm trying my best to figure out how to stop doing that because it's contributing to my depression/lack of motivation. I hope you find true inner happiness :)
unpopularopinion,fnwqpv1,t3_g478zo,1587323582.0,"I feel the same way about those stupid sympathy commercials on tv. It's the SAME shitty emotional piano music, the same insincere ""We've got your back!"" or ""Thank you essential workers!"" message. They don't have our backs, they're brands. They don't give one flying fuck about us besides whether or not we can give them money. They're only airing the commercial to boost their image, and it feels incredibly manipulative. Sure the message is nice but the main reason they're spreading them is to try and lift their public image because it increases profit. It ALWAYS comes back to profit."

AskReddit,fnpiowu,t1_fnokv2t,1587146184.0,I've done about the same and it feels AMAZING. Keep going!! <3
TheMonkeysPaw,fnofhab,t3_g2zx5l,1587123377.0,"Granted. The first time it happens, men everywhere start to question if they have an STD. Appointment bookings for urologists skyrocket and immediately everyone starts freaking out about the new penis disease everyone suddenly has. Markets form around penis-numbing agents with weird names like scrotamin or penistac or dickanidal. Rape becomes nonexistent except among masochists."
IAmA,fnoek0u,t3_g2lv2r,1587122487.0,"Oh my god, I cannot believe I missed this AMA. I loved Circe so much. I read it for an English course and just adored your storytelling. Thank you so much for writing such an amazing book!"
