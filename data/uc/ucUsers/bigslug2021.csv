UCSC,fno2ijf,t3_g2jplp,1587109691.0,if only one of those people who complain about UCSC could just give their spot to someone who really wants to be here like you
UCSC,fmrl46l,t3_fx0m1p,1586326566.0,"The history department at UCSC is quite strong. Especially for the Asia concentration we got some really top professors. Overall as for the classes, if you really enjoy reading a lot of history books then it will be a fun major. The writing is intensive especially if you have to take two history courses per quarter. The lectures are really fascinating to listen to."
