UCSantaBarbara,fnter45,t3_g3rhqv,1587240181.0,"I was actually faced with a similar dilemma when I was making my decision. I was drawn to the collaborative environment and smaller program at UCSB, and so far I am pretty happy with my choice. I have never had too much trouble getting required CS courses, nor have I ever felt that my success depended on others' failure. I also came because of the Technology Management Program, which I am excited to start in the Fall. I cannot comment on its efficacy, but it may be worth looking into."
