berkeley,foppndp,t1_fopogyo,1587968157.0,"For the sake of anonymity and respect for my friends in these houses, I won't mention them.  When you get here and decided to get involved in greek life rush (the formal recruitment process at the beginning of each academic year), I'm sure you will hear rumors about the reputation of each house.  Consider this when selecting which houses to rush, as you will not have enough time to go to them all.  Go to the houses you are interested in and hear about their social scene, housing options, academic vs social balance, and whatever else you find important.  I'm sure you can guess that the houses that are more active socially end up having lower academic performance, which in relation to your original question, are not similar to professional greek life.  This is not to say that all of their members may be like this, as there are definitely smart kids in each house, but the culture of the house is, in my eyes, considerably important.  There are definitely houses out there which will have the balance you seek, whether it leans more towards social or academic."
berkeley,fopo1fx,t1_fopmf63,1587966795.0,"Think of each of these organizations like their own respective family.  Traditional greek life is centered around having a diverse social life while typically maintaining high academic standards.  Professional greek life centers around people from specific majors or professional interests.  

Both organizations seek to bring in members who have powerful connections or have the potential to be powerful people in the future.  Likewise, each organization has distinguished alumni (sometimes across chapters across the nation) who are willing to offer you professional opportunities.  In answer to your question: yes, I would say they increase prospects because of these alumni.  In professional greek life, these alumni are more concentrated in the field of focus for the particular organization (i.e. pre-med frats will have alumni who may offer you opportunities); traditional greek life here has a more diverse selection of majors in membership and alumni, and you will almost certainly find opportunities for your major (albeit in smaller numbers).  Traditional greek life is more widespread throughout the country, and thus you will find an extensive alumni network within each organization that are more than willing to give you opportunities, though not to say that you cannot find this in professional greek life.   Simply being apart of these organizations will not improve your prospects, as it is reaching out to the alumni where the true benefits arise.

For your second question - traditional greek life has its own set of mansions near south side, typically referred to as ""frat row"", where most traditional greek life members live together by choice.  These are massive, often historic houses; I'm sure you can explore some of them on youtube or google images.  These houses are privately owned by each respective organization, and thus rent is a lot cheaper as they are not looking to make a profit off of you (you do have to pay dues, which is to fund the national organization and other expenses, but this is insignificant in comparison to how much you save).  Most of professional greek life does not have this and thus members must find their own living accommodations."
berkeley,foplaqb,t3_g8sbu9,1587964548.0,"Not the question OP asked, but I just want to say that if you're willing to put up with the negatives, you might as well go for real Greek life.  As long as you stay away from certain houses, the opportunities available are practically the same as any of these professional frats (and you get the added benefit of cheap housing and a more opportune social life).  The perspective of professional frats from inside of traditional greek life is that they're essentially ""wannabe"" greek organizations who lure kids by the often-exaggerated professional prospects."
berkeley,fooz67f,t1_fooxejt,1587949576.0,"When I came to Cal, I decided I wanted to branch out, meet new people, join new organizations, Greek life, etc.  This is pretty contrary to most other EECS majors, who spend the majority of their time studying (which I suspect contributes to the variety of mental health issues within the major) as the workload can be difficult.  These were time commitments I said from day one that I would not break, as I believe that engaging in them is both healthy and a crucial part of the college experience.  61A and 16A are conceptually heavy classes, especially if you aren't introduced to a majority of the material beforehand, and WILL take a significant amount of time to learn properly.  16A for me was especially time-consuming; take a look at the syllabus for yourself - the pace felt insane; the second half of 61A, which is new to most people, certainly didn't help.   Had I not committed myself to other things, it is entirely possible that I would have been able to manage the classes better.  I still managed to pull good grades, but it was a hectic semester that I wished would have made the transition from HS a bit easier.  It all really depends on what kind of life you want to lead here."

chanceme,fnuf5cj,t3_g3sab3,1587260660.0,"From a current OOS Berkeley EECS perspective,  honestly nobody here can chance you, including me.  Almost everyone here has the same stats (4.0, 1600, etc.) and has crazy accomplishments (CEOs, top 10 conference research, USACO winners, intel winners etc.)  while your stats are on par with many who are accepted, they are also on par with a majority of applicants who are rejected.  Some things that would really improve your chances would be getting some notable awards, research, and taking advanced classes in high school (linear algebra, above all)."
