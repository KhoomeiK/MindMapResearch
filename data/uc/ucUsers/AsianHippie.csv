vegas,fotefh3,t1_fon6e62,1588051550.0,Ah I knew I've heard that soundtrack somewhere! Those Google Photos automovies are pretty cool despite their flaws though.
berkeley,fo9rbuq,t3_g66p8c,1587628444.0,"Is CalCentral using Oracle for enrollment now?? Man, maybe Tele-Bears was a better idea lol"
berkeley,fo9r1gs,t3_g6g2qq,1587628167.0,"Okay, this post is the best thing in Berkeley and y'all need to know this. Not gonna retell the story here since others have done a great job already. I've always been pissed off at the hypocrisy in the community when people in Berkeley have no idea about the fact that their housing are owned by these SOBs while protesting about something that's basically irrelevant to the local community (not gonna point them out, but you know what they are). THIS is what students should be protesting about, and trying their best to drive them out. Do something that can improve your community (or even your own housing) than trying to save the Middle East. Get your priorities straight. /endrant"
bayarea,fo9qg50,t3_g6akoi,1587627601.0,Pretty cool! The towers on the bottom reminds me of Hong Kong skylines at night.
bayarea,fo9qel3,t1_fo9f47c,1587627560.0,Isn't San Diego Zoo one of the biggest and most famous? I've always wondered how it compares to zoos in the Bay Area.

bayarea,fo9pg5c,t1_fo8kfec,1587626634.0,"I mean, the Bay Area is patting themselves on the back for finally rolling out Clipper Cards after a decade of planning, while cities in Asia can use their version of Clipper Cards to buy groceries at convenient stores. Bureaucracy in America is not only annoying, it's detrimental to development."
bayarea,fo9pch2,t1_fo8e5l5,1587626540.0,">Sorry, I meant why is SMART not a part of BART \*\*\*

Read one of the comments above on the failed plan to build BART on the Golden Gate Bridge (GGB). I frankly think that was probably the worst mistake the Bay Area made when they made BART. Had they done it, it would've been way cheaper and doable than today's ridiculous building costs."
eastbay,fo9o9us,t1_fnrcvp6,1587625542.0,"As  a teacher I have to disagree on this parade thing (as a lot of folks at r/Teachers have complained about this). This really does nothing to help us teach or make the kids feel better about being stuck at home, and instead set a really bad example when we should really sheltering in place. If the kids miss their teachers, there are Zoom and Google Hangouts. Parading in the streets and honking the horns make them look attention grabbing and unprofessional imo."
berkeley,fo5m397,t1_fo5bgx3,1587529068.0,"Forgot the course number but there is one UGBA class on real estate that is open to everyone at Cal. Took it for my city planning minor and it was a pretty cool class. You get to learn how commercial real estate works and even get a free trip to SF to check out an office building (more interesting than it sounds haha). There were a lot of info that can help you learn about ""adulting"" when it comes to housing like mortgage and interest rates, etc, even though it was mostly about commercial properties."
waterpolo,fno14x4,t1_fnm4okx,1587108301.0,Join a club team or maybe even start one?
Fremont,fno0l00,t3_g06sb4,1587107758.0,It's about time Alameda County releases the city counts. Really wondering why they were dragging their feet constantly until this week.
bayarea,fnnyv80,t3_es0we1,1587106112.0,"Hey, a bit late here but are you looking into one of the developments in Centerville? I'm renting in one of the units and there's a few interesting quirks about their Fremont developments: 

* Below average sound proofing; my landlord has to ask me to turn down the TV volume at night because even TV sounds permeate easily 
* Location: For some reason (most likely land prices) they are all located very close to railroad tracks that carry commuter rail (ACE, Capitol Corridor) on a daily basis, in addition to freight trains at night. This is a red flag for those who can't sleep well (not for me though). 
* For newly built (town)houses though, they are of decent value and no major incidents have happened with built quality (i.e. no leaking or anything like that). 

DM me if you still want to know more. This one hits close to home (literally) haha."
bayarea,fnnyaux,t1_f8ulsfd,1587105579.0,">I wouldn't be surprised if Fremont had the first gurdwara

That is true. There's even a road called ""Gurdwara Rd"" that intersects with Mission Blvd in Fremont."
bayarea,fnnxc22,t3_g2mwjo,1587104667.0,"Okay, what is with Americans and wearing masks? I don't like wearing them too, but I know it's time to pull together and help out just by wearing the damn masks. Is that too much to ask for some people? All these people complaining about their civil liberties being violated by masks or ""resisting"" wearing them are just a bunch of first world anarchists tbh."
bayarea,fnnx1o2,t1_fnnppew,1587104402.0,"THIS. Driving in the Bay Area aimlessly is one of my all-time pleasures, especially with the recent gas prices. You simply don't get this much roadside attractions (bridges, coastlines, landmarks) in every urban area. LA, where I'm from, is boring in comparison and far too spread out to enjoy driving around for fun."
berkeley,fnkeqqk,t3_g21lns,1587024302.0,"Is this the Drugs and the Brain class? If so, you really don't need to worry too much about it. As long as you did your work before shit hits the fan, you'll be fine. You already know how Presti is like, you'll know that he means it when he wants to curb your anxiety (not your enthusiasm) at this time."
berkeley,fnkeldi,t1_fnkehoa,1587024144.0,I'm guessing Santa Cruz or Half Moon Bay?
Teachers,fnkdkl2,t1_fnhxss3,1587023101.0,"Policy, like everything human made, is subjective and people can put whatever spin they want with it. Same goes with districts. Glad to hear your district is being firm with expectations. The most you can do is, indeed, not do more than is asked at this point. 

Source: being polisci major back in undergrad provided me with some well-needed cynicism in education policy when I started teaching."
Teachers,fnkcxb2,t1_fnjbcms,1587022440.0,"Thank you, someone with common sense and value efficiency over blind effort. Last time I checked, we're teachers and not curriculum writers and producers. There are so many resources online that we can curate, Khan Academy, RazKids, IXL, you name it. Aside from providing an emotionally safe space (which is so important but not physically possible), our job in distance learning is to make sure that we can curate good, quality lessons online for the kids so that they can focus on what they should learn. Making new content is appropriate once in a while to supplement, but I really don't see a point of doing it every single day. 

If the kids want to socialize on Zoom, help them set it up with each other so they can chat all day long with their friends online."

Can attest to that 100% after living in places with and without one. I think it's one of the worst features of suburbia imo."
