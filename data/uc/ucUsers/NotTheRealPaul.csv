More importantly, giving students the opportunity to drop a class retroactively (as in after finals) without getting a mark on their record would be nice. I think given the situation, you shouldn’t even have to demonstrate severe hardship as it would be hard to prove especially in cases where you had to deal with increased/heightened mental illness due to the situation."
ucla,fpcdo4h,t1_fpcd6z4,1588496620.0,Good luck! It’s definitely been a huge stress reliever knowing I can switch to P/NP if things dont look great week 10.

ucla,fpcdd1n,t1_fpc6urc,1588496285.0,"If we’re asking graduate schools/employers to essentially turn a blind eye to this quarter wouldnt mandatory P/NP with a very low bar for passing make more sense? Our GPAs would remain entirely unaffected that way so the quarter really would be meaningless. However you’d still have to show you learned some of the material to pass.

If an individual is completely locked out of technology, then how could they participate in online classes at all? Wouldn’t it make more sense for them to simply withdraw for the quarter? If you have no access to the internet, I don’t expect you’d be able to learn in an online format at all, so you shouldn’t get a free pass for a bunch of classes. Atleast for some classes, they require knowledge taught in previous class, so it may be detrimental to be able to pass when you’re unable to access any learning resources. And I understand how this may seem unfair if some people have to take a gap quarter, but I dont think having them essentially skip a class is better. 

My problem w the A/A- system vs P/NP is at least in a P/NP u have to put in some work to show you’ve learned enough to move on. An A/A- system gives everyone an automatic pass. You should still have to demonstrate atleast some mastery of knowledge to move on regardless of the circumstances. I think its fair to lower the bar significantly so that those without the same access to resources can still pass, but if you’re in a situation with no access to technology at hand then a gap quarter is the only option. If you can’t demonstrate any mastery of knowledge you shouldn’t move on to the next class. 

I just don’t see how an A/A- system is better, but maybe Im just missing/not getting something."
ucla,fpccbxo,t1_fpc8ozh,1588495206.0,"You actually bring up a good point that I hadn’t considered and changed my mind. I also forgot how other majors are struggling. College of Engineering has been very lenient allowing us to take any class P/NP. 

I think if its going to be mandatory P/NP, then the minimum for passing should be lowered as well but otherwise I agree with you."
ucla,fpc6ad1,t1_fpc5yfb,1588489032.0,I just replied to your other comment regarding this but I think thats an unrealistic to ask for due to the grade inflation that would inevitably occur. I think lowering the P/NP minimum significantly would give the same stress relief/even the playing field.
ucla,fpc633u,t1_fpc5k77,1588488836.0,I doubt this will ever happen due to the obvious grade inflation. Maybe optional P/NP with the minimum for passing much lower (40% or lower) so that nearly everyone should be able to pass regardless and those that are able to do well in this format can get their gpa boost.
ucla,fpc5si0,t3_gck03j,1588488554.0,"Why mandatory P/NP though? I have a few classes where ive been able to teach myself and it looks like I might end with a good grade. Optional P/NP seems fairer so those of us who are doing okay this quarter can boost our gpa. 

Maybe the option to switch to P/NP after finals as well?"
ucla,fn4efpq,t1_fn16plm,1586639694.0,One of my friends has a chegg so if we’re completely stuck we just go there
ucla,fn0ou1c,t3_fyg9q5,1586545920.0,Ive given up on lectures and am just teaching myself out of the book and from khan academy.
AskMen,fjeazk8,t3_fcnp7z,1583268469.0,Ive been consistently going to the gym 4-5 days a week all year. Its not much but it makes me feel like I have some bit of control of my life. Ive also made (baby) steps into getting help with my mental health.
