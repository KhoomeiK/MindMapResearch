The world is a cruel place. 

It’s not fair, never will be fair people go though a lot of bad stuff, bad good can get it off easy. NEVER EVER worry about advantages other people have you can’t control.

There will always be people will be richer than you, more attractive, have more connections etc etc. don’t worry about them worry about yourself. 

It sucks that some people have it easier, sucks that some people have it worse. Worrying about it will just give you extra stress and this applies to all things in life not just a cs career."

unpopularopinion,fpavel4,t3_gc7f3p,1588456510.0,"I very strongly disagree with you 

Tv shows glorify cops as these good guys fighting crime and that’s usually our only impression of them since we don’t have a lot of daily interaction with cops. And of course when people like you see bad stuff happening you think “hey there’s always going to be a some bad eggs”

But here’s where your drop dead wrong. COPS are not good guys there job is to PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT not protect citizens. They are essentially a private military force for the government and let me explain why.  

1) in Warren v District of Columbia the Supreme Court declared that cops owe no duty to protect individal citizens. This was again confirmed by a judge after the Stoneman Douglass school shooting where cops did not enter the school to save kids getting gunned down, because it’s not their job.

2) Police have more power than average citizens obviously, power leads to corruption and they are not held accountable for their actions. Even if you want to submit a complain about a cop who are you going to submit it? The police? The police claim there actions are always justified because they feared for their lives. And if you sue them and win the money you get dosent come from their pensions or department but rather the taxpayer dollars. 

3)police enforce a systemic racist system for decades. When salary needed the police would falsely arrest hundreds of blacks and forced them to do service work in prison essentially another version of slavery. Practices of police discrimination are still around today.

Obviously here’s dozens more reasons than this but I hope you start to get the point. Even if there is a good cop he’s doing a job which makes him a bad person in a sense, which is why people say stuff like ACAB. People hate the police for stuff like this, they claim to sever the public but they are not public servants rather a private military force."

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fp6ufm2,t3_gbllx6,1588358776.0,"Dosent matter if they lied, she resisted arrest, she should have let them arrest her and screwed them over in court.

Edit: since this is getting a lot of hate let me point that 

You have the right to resist arrest physically, but only if you’re being harmed. An officer taking you into custody, even unlawfully, doesn’t justify assault. Additionally this only applies in some states not all. 

If there is proof that the unlawful arrest was peaceful on the officer’s part, you will be convicted of assault in court.

The best thing that girl should have done is call her lawyer. Explain to the officer that she isn’t resisting arrest, but that you’d like to speak to your lawyer before handing over her rights. Instead of trying to run or get away.

I also should not have said “let them arrest her” I meant not look like she was resisting by trying to get away."

I'm all for earning your money and small government with little interference but a society that allows billionaires to exist is flawed. Its almost impossible to fathom how much money a billion dollars is. For reference imagine a grain of rice is 100,000. A 10 pound bag of rice is what a billion looks like and now imagine Jeff Bezos with over 200 billion.  This leads to massive income inequality when 2000 people control half HALF of the worlds wealth and money=power which untimely corrupts. Now these people have the power to do support there initiatives and further divide the rich from the poor. For example say these billionaires pour their money into creating a new political party, buying every member of that party, pouring billions into getting them advertising and control the news outlet into convincing Americans that's these parties are here for them. Along with paying off anyone or getting ""rid"" of anyone that gets in their way. Now they control the government and hence everyone's lives and can continue to grow the wealth gap.
