Have they posted on BikeIndex?"
NianticWayfarer,fov5vu9,t1_fov48e4,1588095888.0,"Interesting!

Nothing that elaborate, but the City of Los Angeles has a historical marker up for a Native Californian burial ground, which is just part of a regular street with apartment buildings on it now. We have a portal/stop for that sign now."

NianticWayfarer,foqwqna,t1_foqs6o4,1588002178.0,"Agreed, I don't see anything in that plaque discussing historic significance. The religious aspect fits in with the Ingress lore for spiritual locations, but it's also a real world cemetery and the guidelines state to avoid those submissions."
ucla,fop72wq,t1_foob8n4,1587954537.0,"> You are a staff I see. It's only natural for you to talk and think like you do because you have a job as a staff.

I have nothing to do with the education side at all. I'm not using my degree for anything directly related to what I studied for. A hard lesson to learn is that your degree isn't a job license and you'll have to be able to adapt. Maybe you'll get a job directly related to what you studied, maybe you won't. Hopefully you can still find something that is related. Life isn't a direct path, certainly not everyone thinks that a degree is worth the money that you had to spent and the debt that too many people are forced to go into."
ucla,foo9c56,t3_g8l6ur,1587935011.0,">Being a biochemistry major and graduating from UCLA, paying $120,000 should guarantee a job at the very least.

I'd recommend you'd try to rethink this, and that no one else falls into this line of thinking. There's too many people who think that they are owed something because they paid tuition to a big name university."

It's clearly impossible to close the beaches, but the people in the photo (and you, if you took this photo) were technically violating the order and a police officer with nothing better to do could have ticketed you."
