At first I was confused on how to pass values to quad for the constants (it doesn't take kwargs), but I think I've figured it out. Quad knows that the first argument in myfunc is the variable to integrated, and then takes everything after as positional arguments. So I can pass a tuple of values that match up with the positional arguments of the function and do something like this (I added extra constants to your example function for my example).

    from scipy.integrate import quad
    
    def myfunc(x, a, c):
        return a*x**3 + c
    
    boundlist = [1, 2, 5, 8]
    
    # Values for a and c
    parameters = (15, 20)
    
    for bound in boundlist:
        result, error = quad(myfunc, 0, bound, args=parameters)
        print(bound, "" : "", round(result, 6))"
learnpython,fnekbgv,t1_fnd0oq1,1586890899.0,"I'm a bit unclear on how to deal with the constants. The documentation for quad defines the integrand with a lambda expression, but since I want to be able to change the constants, should I define a function with arguments for the integration variable and constants and pass that to quad?

&#x200B;

Edit: Or maybe define a lambda function with multiple variables?"
