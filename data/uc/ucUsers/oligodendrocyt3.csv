veterinarian,foem5ip,t3_g4pkgc,1587707541.0,"I’m not a veterinarian but I have some experience working with animals and in an animal clinic. Yellow poop in a cat is most definitely not normal. Make sure that you have no toxic plants in your house that your cat has access to. If you do, make sure you note what plant it is if you suspect your cat has been chewing on it. Yellow diarrhea can mean that your cat isn’t properly absorbing the food they’re eating. It could indicate an intestinal parasite, bacterial infection, or some sort of disease the cat was born with but didn’t have symptoms of when they were younger. If it’s possible, you should at least try to bring your cat into a vet office for a check up. You could try to collect a sample of the stool so if the vet wants to test it they can. 

When you adopted your cat, was it from a good shelter (meaning: did your cat receive proper deworming treatment before you adopted it)? Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat? Have you switched your cat’s food recently?"
medical_advice,fny5nol,t1_fnxbubj,1587354010.0,I think my right was slightly swollen but not enough to the point it hurt. My left took a beating though :(
medical_advice,fnxhj3t,t1_fnwxxir,1587338754.0,I have a rheumatologist for some other things (blood clotting issues) but I haven’t seen her since before this started. I’ll have to make an appointment and see what she says. I really hope there’s something I can do for it because I want to be able to take casual walks without painful hands.. thank you!

medical_advice,fnwq0zq,t1_fnvl597,1587323186.0,I went from indoor (temp 68F) to outdoors (temp 62F) for about 30 minutes before the swelling started happening.
medical_advice,fnwpycf,t1_fnv99kb,1587323144.0,It happens when I’m in cold temperature too.
medical_advice,fnup9ud,t3_g40uof,1587267607.0,"Details: For 5 years, every time I exercise or break a sweat, my hands swell and it hurts VERY badly. It happens when I walk, run, hike, vacuum, scoop the cat litter box, touch new objects(?). I have no idea what causes it because I don’t touch anything when I hike. I don’t have any allergies. I can’t figure out what causes it. It’s the type of pain that stops you in your tracks. Eventually the swelling and pain goes down. I try holding my hands above my head, ice packs, Advil. Please just help.

Today specifically, I went on a 1 mile long hike. Only my left hand swelled (right side for normal comparison). It’s been an hour and the left side is still swollen."

medical_advice,fnf0ron,t3_g193gd,1586899313.0,MRSA? I had a gnarly bump like this a while back and it looked similar. It looked like it could have been a bot fly but I got it cultured and it was MRSA. Get antibiotics ASAP.
