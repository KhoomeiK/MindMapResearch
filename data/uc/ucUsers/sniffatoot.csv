ApplyingToCollege,fo3bipv,t3_g5hea4,1587484052.0,I think going to a CC was one of the best decisions I ever made. I was very much a b student in high-school as well but I had a chance during those two years to change my study habits and learn to enjoy the challenge of academics. I am now going to be transferring to a UC this fall and super stoked not just because of how I applied myself but also because of the money I was able to save. And I was in the same boat I had the chance to go to CSULB but I didnâ€™t feel entirely right and its very important (at least for me) to feel that you have made the right decision about where you will be spending your college experience.
UCSC,fo28ntd,t3_g4ntf1,1587453309.0,Whatâ€™s your major?
UCSC,fo28khg,t1_fo28fnl,1587453219.0,"Talk to a counselor about where you want to transfer and what you are wanting to major in. You have to get youâ€™re general education out of the way and depending on you major, your counselor will print out a paper that lists all of the classes that you will need to have the best chance of getting accepted."

To be honest I just want to be in a place that is pretty LIT. Around People who want to party often. Not because I want to party all the time but so I can always have the option

csMajors,fnu1yk5,t1_fntp9pk,1587252973.0,"Itâ€™s always good if you have healthy relationships with sone back home so you can stay in contact while your initially moving into this new place. But the first couple of weeks for new students are made to create social atmospheres where you are almost forced to meet people and create relationships. Joining clubs and or thinking about Greek life is also a great way to hunker down ina new territory and claim a new place as home/2nd home. I moved out to California just to go to a CC for two years so Iâ€™d have a better chance at transferring into a UC for a lot less too. I noticed during my first year away from home that keeping my attention on schoolwork and getting out of the house when I had the chance kept me from feeling any kind of homesickness. Of course youâ€™re going to miss family, friends, and pets but branching out and going someplace you are new too is a fantastic way to grow as a person. Iâ€™ll be transferring to UCSC this fall as a junior transfer and I canâ€™t be more excited to finally live on a campus and meet all my future lifelong friends!"

ApplyingToCollege,fnsy4ph,t1_fnsxuh8,1587231012.0,Not easy but best choose if youâ€™re trying to save money. I did this for California. Flew out as soon as I could to open a bank account and get my drivers license then when the semester started found a cheap place to live and was offered instate my second year of CC and now will have instate whilst transferring to a university.
