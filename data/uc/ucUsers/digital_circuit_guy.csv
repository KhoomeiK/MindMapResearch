TheRightCantMeme,fpkhbjr,t1_fpjy5p7,1588694695.0,I would agree with that being a voluntary activity. I was just making a point about where it seems Republicans have their priorities.

dating,fpdmxrs,t3_gcvea2,1588530165.0,It seems like she’s not interested. I’d just leave her alone.
explainlikeimfive,fpdl025,t1_fpdjvwv,1588529063.0,"Well yeah, when you have a new process then it’ll take time to get up and running. But if you’re not trying to make your chip with the latest 3 nm process, then they already have the automation in place for anyone looking to get their ICs made. I guess with what I’m trying to say is that the custom parts of manufacturing semiconductors is a lot faster than the custom parts of different vaccines."
explainlikeimfive,fpdfhjf,t3_gcr80f,1588525967.0,"Most likely, it’s due to a couple of factors. First, according to GSK, some of the materials needed to produce vaccines take two years to procure. Second, it takes 12 months to produce the specific antigens in a large enough quantity to start producing the vaccines. Then, you have to couple all of the ingredients, and then go through a whole regulatory process.

Semiconductors, while they still may have some regulatory processes, have nowhere near the amount of red tape that vaccines do, since semiconductors aren’t being injected into the body. Most ICs manufactured follow a fairly standard process that is mostly automated and takes about 6-8 weeks from the foundry receiving the design to the completed batch."
AskEngineers,fpab3i4,t1_fpaap4f,1588444481.0,"Yeah, I did. It’s kind of a pain. Then I had an in person interview with the investigators and they had to interview a number of people that know me. I’m just now waiting to take the polygraph..."

beholdthemasterrace,fp911me,t1_fp90p54,1588410212.0,"That’s really interesting, I didn’t know that.

5Gcomm,fozah83,t1_fngpctj,1588187392.0,"That’s not correct. The 5G wireless standard uses multiple frequency bands, which do include mmWave frequency bands. See TS 38.101-1 and TS 38.101-2. 

It’s because if these higher frequencies that 5G networks have higher bandwidths and therefore higher data rates.

TooAfraidToAsk,fonsr6p,t3_g8iu5g,1587925737.0,"In terms of it being safe/legal, the hard cutoff according to law in the United States is 18. In reality, there’s no difference in maturity between someone who is 17 and 364 days and the same person who is 18 years and 0 days. But legally, there has to be a hard cutoff somewhere. 

Morally, I think there’s a big difference between someone who is also 17/18 and who is attracted to 17/18 year olds, and someone who is 45 and attracted to 17/18 year olds."

Some people like using IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments, since they have tools such as debuggers and compilers/interpreters built in, and offer other features like code completion and syntax highlighting. 

For a more specific answer, we’d need to know what programming language/operating system you’re using to tell you how to actually run the code.
