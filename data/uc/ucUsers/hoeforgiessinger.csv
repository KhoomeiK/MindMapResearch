UCSantaBarbara,fpc6ik0,t3_gcjtoc,1588489248.0,Honestly ALEKS was pretty calming to me. Mastering physics/chemistry is much more frustrating
UCSantaBarbara,fpa7ba5,t1_fpa3rbb,1588442268.0,"Oh wow, I didnâ€™t know about the rule change. Guess my friends were just lucky!"
UCSantaBarbara,fp8ewbk,t3_gbyn9h,1588390559.0,"I have a friend who did that. At first he couldnâ€™t get any compsci classes easily so he switched into the stats major. He took summer courses every summer. 

Edit: I have more than one friend who did it from L&S, one of which got in pretty early. It is VERY hard and painful for an undeclared to do it and not advisable. Additionally, as the faculty member below said, the rules *just* changed so itâ€™s much less likely. It seems that although it used to be possible, itâ€™s much harder now and youâ€™d be better off going to a different school."
UCSantaBarbara,foywj38,t3_gad7tb,1588180492.0,Uh. Not sure. Iâ€™m like on the skinny side and I donâ€™t go to the beach at all. I just do my schoolwork and dip. I know some people in sororities but theyâ€™re not that skinny? My housemates last year were my favorite people ever and party a lot and they werenâ€™t skinny. In my experience it doesnâ€™t have any correlation
UCSantaBarbara,fosia0j,t3_g9azra,1588031242.0,Just adding in here that students can also use google meet with other students!
UCSantaBarbara,foemvu4,t3_g71dia,1587708151.0,"The music department is very small, in fact there are probably not too many people on here that could answer your questions (I just play in the chamber orchestra) 

But Iâ€™d say its nice because itâ€™s close and you end up getting to know a lot of people. I met most of my college friends through music even though Iâ€™m not a major. 

I think as a music major you play in ensembles as a requirement and have lessons with your instrumentâ€™s professor. There are a lot of really up there professors, I heard from someone that the flute professor is well known. 

At UCSB they also have discounted concert tickets at the theaters in Santa Barbara. Since itâ€™s a popular place, a lot of really famous musicians play or come to have master classes."
chemistryhomework,fo71kw3,t1_fo6zozc,1587570630.0,"C4H8 has a mass of 56. Is there a reason this mass spec has the base peak at 55?

Also wouldnâ€™t cleaving off an acyl chloride group keep the positive charge on the COCL group and just leave a radical on the carbon chain?

Or wait, could it be that it makes an uncharged radical on both sides of the backbone, but then a hydrogen gets cleaved off, making m/z=55 ?"
UCSantaBarbara,fo2aikv,t3_g5aqt8,1587455143.0,A lot of the problems just have to do with resonance. I canâ€™t solve a lot of them until I draw out resonance structures and think about how that affect things. That and reading the book helps
UCSantaBarbara,fnuqp6q,t1_fnuqi6o,1587268625.0,"As for advice, Iâ€™ve started both my essays so I dont have to think as much when I continue them next week. Idk how to go about studying for all these tests ðŸ˜­"
UCSantaBarbara,fnuqi6o,t3_g40xvz,1587268483.0,Oh mood I have papers due Tuesday and Wednesday as well as 3 quizzes and 1 midterm on Monday. Fun
UCSantaBarbara,fnrhhtj,t3_g3hq3n,1587189105.0,My teacher for one of my classes has not had a clear throat for these entire 3 weeks and it drives me crazy. Sounds like sand paper with some intermittent coughing
UCSantaBarbara,fnq5xvg,t1_fnq5r28,1587158302.0,I thought normally 87 is a B+. You could prob email him and see if heâ€™ll round up but he usually already rounds up the grades heâ€™s willing to
UCSantaBarbara,fnq5nz3,t3_g39ixb,1587158151.0,He said the grade calculator is inaccurate bc thereâ€™s a new curve
