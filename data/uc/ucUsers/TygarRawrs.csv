Another possibility is that someone who took the class in previous years gave it to her.

Additionally, it is really a dick move on your end to go find a new girlfriend less than 2 months after you've broken up with your ex ***who was pregnant and miscarried your child***. She was already hurt from not being able to maintain her much-desired pregnancy, and then you make it worse by not only breaking up with her, but also dating someone new immediately. That's kinda like telling her ""you are not good enough, so I will now leave and find someone better and who doesn't have the limitations that you do, even though you cannot reasonably do anything to change your illness"" as well as confirming her belief that she will neither have children nor get married.

Also, your new girlfriend is 19. **19**. Just 1 year into legal adulthood.
