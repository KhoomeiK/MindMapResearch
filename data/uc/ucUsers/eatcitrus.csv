I'm looking at buying Titanium 2LS  or 4th Millennium Tall Fescue, would it be the same buying from [SuperSeedStore ($116.99/25lbs including free shipping)](https://www.seedsuperstore.com/catalog/p-100106/titanium-2-ls-tall-fescue) vs [UnitedSeeds.com ($101.70/25lbs including shipping)](https://unitedseeds.com/product/titanium-2ls/)?

When people go with SuperSeedStore, are they usually getting their [blended mixes](https://www.seedsuperstore.com/catalog/p-100003/ss1000-tall-fescue-blend)?"

Currently the weeds/burmuda grass won't grow there.

I'm somewhat new to lawn care, what are the benefits of doing a mix / increasing diversity vs going with just 1 brand?

I'm trying to avoid anything that spreads because of the nightmare it was to remove the Bermuda grass that invaded the lava rock side beds that came with the house."

Titanium 2 LS Tall Fescue from Seedsuperstore](https://www.seedsuperstore.com/catalog/p-100106/titanium-2-ls-tall-fescue), can I cover my whole lawn in shade tolerant grass, or will direct sunlight be too strong and I need shade tolerant grass for shaded areas only?"
