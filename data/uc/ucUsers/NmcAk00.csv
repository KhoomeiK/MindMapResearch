It's a relatively easy switch because undeclared are allowed to take the four required classes that you need to switch without any school or major restrictions.

Fall: Econ 20A (microeconomics), Math 2A (Single Variable Calculus: Derivatives and Limits)

Winter: Econ 20B (macroeconomics), Math 2B (Single Variable Calculus: Integrals and Series)

You can take more credits in some GEs that you need, but you can't get a grade below a C in any of those four classes and you need a 2.50 average gpa which is between a C+ and B- average so don't overwork yourself.  A lot of people have a really hard time in Math 2B.

If you scroll to business econ there should be a sample 4 year plan which you can follow."

Even though it won't be in person this year I'm sure that they will still offer advising for your classes in someway.  When I went last year for engineering they basically told me exactly what to take and how to use the site."

UCI,foyumkt,t3_ga9eki,1588179474.0,"Yeah it's a really easy change since you have to take all 11 of the required classes to switch anyways so you don't have to worry about any of the classes being major locked.  I heard that the counselors sometimes allow switches within the department without going through the formal process (aero -> mech, environmental -> civil) so it might be worth asking 

Otherwise if they say no just get a 3.0 (B average) in the 11 classes required to switch.

UCI,foxhgh5,t3_ga3ox6,1588144116.0,"The only class that you would have to worry about getting is EngrCee 20 in the fall of your second year since the other 10 pre reqs all allow undeclared to have priority in registering in them along with engineering.

https://changeofmajor.uci.edu/engineering/#civil

1st Quarter you would take Chem 1A, Math 2A, Physics 2 (if you didn't pass the placement MAPPS test)

2nd Quarter: Chem 1B, Math 2B, Physics 7C & 7LC

3rd Quarter: Chem 1C & 1LC, Math 2D, Physics 7D & 7LD, EngrCee 81A

Then first quarter your second year after you take Engrcee 20 you should be in.

This schedule is assuming you're not ahead in your math or chem from AP classes.  

So basically as long as you stick to the 4 year plan flowchart [here](http://plaza.eng.uci.edu/sites/default/files/flowcharts/18-19/civil-general-frosh.pdf) you should be able to switch relatively easily.  You have to stick to this schedule pretty strictly though, because some classes are only offered certain quarters.  Like this year and in the past Engrcee 20 is only offered in the fall.  Another requirement is maintaining a 3.0 (B average) in the 11 classes"

My engineer commuter friend got his parking pass in the School of Physical Science area (Lot 16 or something idk) since a fair number of first year STEM classes are there in MSTB and Rowland Hall

Here's a list of GEs that count for two categories if you have a lot to do.  If you did a lot of AP classes in high school then you don't really need a bunch that double count unless you just want to get them over with.  It's kind of nice to have a GPA booster here and there with and easy GE though like the Philosophy classes or the non-major art classes.

Declaring your minor as MSE is pretty easy for MechEs.  You already take the 10 required classes to get into the minor, after you declared it I think you need 5 more to complete it (since 2 more classes overlap).

UCI,folbh3y,t1_fokw3wb,1587858709.0,"Yeah I agree with the other poster if you know how to do basic kinematics and vector stuff (addition, multiplication, dot product) it's pretty unneeded.  Your time would be better spent doing an easy GE and focusing on your other STEM classes.

Of course if you need some review it may be good to do it since I personally found 7C to be kind of a lot of work and if you're not super strong on vectors and kinematics it would be good to have the review to help you adjust to college physics classes, but there's a lot of resources online to study that kind of stuff.

UCI,fokrtz2,t3_g7y6vv,1587847733.0,"MSE and MechE take very similar classes first year with the only difference really being MechE takes Chem 1LE instead of Chem 1B in the winter, so it wouldn't be a problem at all.

Basically you would take Math 2A, Chem 1A, Engrmae 10, and maybe Physics 2 first quarter if you don't pass the placement test for Physics 7C.

Then in the winter you would take Math 2B, Chem 1LE, Physics 7C & 7LC

Then 3rd quarter you would take Math 2D and Physics 7D and 7LD.

This is assuming you come in with no credits for AP classes.  You don't have to worry about major restrictions for classes until you take Mae 80 and 60 in your second year so you should be able to get the classes you need relatively easily."
