EDIT: Also The Film Reroll! They play through movie plots like it's DnD so the story can go in wildly different directions"

TheMidnightGospel,fp58tvh,t3_g9yz5q,1588320350.0,"The well-spoken and ""quotable"" parts of this show remind me a lot of BoJack Horseman. BH takes a while to get up to speed, but some of the best episodes are as heartbreaking and beautiful as Episode 8 of The Midnight Gospel."
TheMidnightGospel,fp58qxi,t1_foxisrf,1588320264.0,I love It's Such A Beautiful Day! Do you know if it exists anywhere online still? It seems like its been wiped off the face of the internet when I try to find it

AnimalCrossing,foc5zs1,t1_fobx1g8,1587667502.0,"All of that is really interesting! I ended up taking Isabelle’s advice first and adding more flowers and it worked! Five stars for a non-TT island! I still had stage-1 nooks cranny and Able Stisters, and was running out of room for furniture on the grass to be honest. Thanks for the advice and I’ll probably refer back to this as I try to maintain the rating!"
AnimalCrossing,fob33sp,t1_fo9ne84,1587655599.0,"Hmm okay! Yeah I think it was added because of the shrubs and stuff, but I’m also at the same point that you described. Do you think you can get away with large bodies of water? With the way that I designed my island I have a large body of water(takes up almost two sections of land, when looking at the map, like A3 and A4). I don’t want to remove it but I’m worried I’m losing points because I don’t have furniture/flowers in those sections because it’s all water."
AnimalCrossing,fo9lrwv,t1_fo9lh2v,1587623293.0,"Weird, I never saw that until I updated(didn’t change anything before updating). Maybe it’s just a coincidence or they altered the rating criteria a little bit"
