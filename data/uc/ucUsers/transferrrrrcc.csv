you should also contact financial aid at berkeley and tell them your situation, i've heard theyre helpful! congrats on getting into berkeley. and i really hope everything works out."
berkeley,fpkxkic,t3_ge2en7,1588702775.0,how is being a transfer making your tuition higher than non-transfer internationals? we pay the same tuition as 4 year students. my friend who is a transfer (and international) is on a scholarship.

berkeley,fphe12f,t3_gd4a3q,1588619612.0,"if you don't have a laptop get a laptop!! after having an ipad for a while now, i like it when doing psets and having my notes in 1 place but i often go back to paper because with paper you can see many sheets at one time without having to scroll back and forth (disrupts my train of thought).

it's not worth it to get an ipad + pencil just for school unless you already have one. loose leaf hole punched printer paper in a binder is always the best!"

berkeley,forksiu,t1_forfx4e,1588013899.0,"it kind of seems like one of those ""jokes"" that actually aren't jokes at all. it's honestly embarrassing. i'm probably taking it too seriously but it's SO embarrassing hearing people saying they ""settled"" for berkeley, especially as a transfer who never wanted anything more than to come to this school and is constantly grateful for everything Cal has given me."

2. yeah absolutely. many of my friends are doing research, and CoC is really great at offering opportunities. i honestly think it's rare for someone not to be in research, at least among my friends. even before i stepped foot on campus i started doing research at LBL with a fellowship offer from CoC + LBNL  (that had a sizable stipend!)"
berkeley,fohcyzr,t3_g7gxg1,1587763889.0,let me just call miss covid and ask her if she's still around during spring 21! brb it'll be real quick she usually lets us know :)

FrankOcean,focl2m8,t1_focis1g,1587672598.0,"Whoever you are. Wherever you are… I’m starting to think we’re a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness. All wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to. My loved ones are everything to me here. In the last year or 3 I’ve screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation. Mercy maybe. For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow. 4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I’d see him, and his smile. I’d hear his conversation and his silence…until it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him. By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love, it changed my life. Back then, my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with. I reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager.. The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realised they were written in a language I did not yet speak. I realised too much, too quickly. Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn’t in a plane though. I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldn’t admit the same. He had to go back inside soon, it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. He wouldn’t tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. I felt like I’d only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn’t on a cliff. I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn’t imagine keeping up my life without him. I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn’t always successful  


The dance went on.. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. It’s winter now. I’m typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat. It’s December 27, 2011. By now I’ve written two albums. This being the second. I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions. I’m surprised at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this I’d told some people my story. I’m sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans, probably angels. I don’t know what happens now, and that’s alrite. I don’t have any secrets I need kept anymore. There’s probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don’t think I ever could be. Thanks. To my first love, I’m grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn’t what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was. Some things never are.. and we were. I won’t forget you. I won’t forget the summer. I’ll remember who I was when I met you. I’ll remember who you were and how we’ve both changed and stayed the same. I’ve never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know I’m only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good. I feel like a free man. If I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too"

berkeley,fo2azwa,t3_g5a551,1587455626.0,"it's very bittersweet cause you wish you had more time to explore everything. really hard, but very rewarding and the people you meet are so cool. it depends what College youre in, but i'm in College of Chem so i don't have any unit cap unlike people in L&S, so i'm spending 3 years here instead of 2. it works out because i only spent 1 year at CC, so i'm still graduating ""on time"". 

i barely got a dorm room, but that's because i only chose singles as an option.

no magic bullet besides hard work."

berkeley,fnxqd7e,t3_g4flws,1587344123.0,"definitely never not do something because you think you won't be able to handle it. you can. it's just a matter of learning to adapt and taking things in stride. dont worry about that part at all. you'll meet so many smart, talented ppl and in turn you'll become a better thinker, student, and person.

amileaday,fncxxji,t3_g0eouu,1586851113.0,"1) 4/13 was officially a week! i haven't run this consistently for a loonng time. i was never a good runner. 11.25 miles this past week which isn't a lot but i'm glad i'm sticking with it! 

2) it feels pretty good. i want to increase my mileage and do longer runs at a slow speed. 

3)  my lower back is sore so i've been lying on the ground and stretching. i have a pretty shitty core so i'm going to start doing planks? if anyone reads this and has recommendations please tell me!!

4) treadmill running is super boring but i'll live. i can do 3.25 mi pretty easily at 5mph -- snail speed i know! at the end of the 3.25 i honestly wasn't  tired, just sweaty, so i wonder how many miles i can actually do that will get me tired! 

5) im currently taking a quantum mechanics midterm, and am exhausted and nowhere close to finishing. tomorrow's run will be rough."
