That sounds pretty interesting, I've definitely read some literature that contain similar concepts - apotheosis is a fascinating topic, and I think I have a vague memories of processes of god-making in the East. I have a few more questions I just thought of:

1. When you say the throne of God, is it a throne in the same sense as the Stone of Scone for the British  Monarchy, in that only God may sit there, or that anyone who sits there is God?
2. What are the conditions for a human to be a perfect vessel/candidate for God? (If you don't mind saying) By your wording, is it that God descends into your body, and you become God, or is it that you directly become God?
3. Is any day in July appropriate, or is there a specific date? How did you/your family decide the date?
4. Could you shed any light on how they've been cultivating you (if it's not too much of an invasion of privacy)?
5. What would you personally define God to be?
6. When you ascend and attain the state of God, is it similar to Buddhist nibbana in that you achieve non-existence/extinction, or something else?
7. After your apotheosis, what would you and your family do (if that makes any kind of sense)?
8. Will there be signs of your ascension visible to everyone/a specific subset of the people on Earth?
9. This isn't really related, but could you share any parts of your daily routine?

Again, feel free not to answer any of these - I'm a scholar at heart, so I'm just really curious about all this."

From what I've read in the paper, there's no indication that they've adjusted it in any way to account for the factors that don't affect the spread of the pandemic but affect the data collected."
singapore,fopx2uy,t3_g8v6z3,1587975052.0,"Speaking as someone who's only done a bit of statistics, modelling, and stochastic processes, I am sceptical of the data-predicted end dates. I don't see much of a problem with their definitions of the end dates, but their data has already been acknowledged to be inaccurate, which bothers me.

I've been looking at the paper linked [here](https://ddi.sutd.edu.sg/) written by [Dr. Luo Jianxi](https://epd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/luo) (And damn is his resume impressive), and I've seen no mention of adjusting for test rates and other factors that, while don't affect the spread of COVID-19 in a significant way, ***are*** non-negligible in influencing collected data. I can't say anything about the model - the Professor is definitely more qualified than me to comment on this - except that in my experience, any model is only as applicable to real life as far as the assumptions it makes are reasonable and that the data provided is accurate enough, which IMHO it isn't. You have reports of misinformation, different definitions of confirmed cases, differing test rates, differences in tests for COVID-19, etc. that make presenting the data now like this a bit misguided, in that it might do more harm than good if a lot of people read this without a basic knowledge of what went into creating these charts.

I really hope that the predictions his models give are accurate enough that I have something to look forward in the next few months, but I really wish that the DDI Lab didn't publish something like to the public with such a weak disclaimer, especially when the motivation section of the paper implies that the charts are meant to complement the existing reports of confirmed cases for a general audience.  


It seems odd to me that they would release this to the general public without further refinement.

**TLDR: The language of the disclaimer** ***has*** **to be more explicit in acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in making predictions of any kind with inaccurate, non-contextualized data, because people will get bored and not read things carefully.**"

Mona Lisa, however, is definitely a really good CE to get, and would be my first choice in most situations. You'll need a ton of QP the longer you play this game, since ludicrous amounts of it are needed to max out servant skills, ascend servants, or grail them. If you're not into that, then Mona Lisa will be less useful. IMHO Personal Lesson/Training is useless, since you'll eventually max out your Master level + Mystic Code levels if you play long enough. I'd never get them unless you really have nothing else to spend your RPs on.  


As for the raids, people grind them because of the Mats they drop, and because Chalk drops (the gold event currency) are good enough that I'd recommend you to use the event CE for chalk drops over MLB Mona Lisa."

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that no, you can't 1-turn with Orion yet. If you have an Arts buffer, maybe, since it stacks multiplicatively, but yeah.
