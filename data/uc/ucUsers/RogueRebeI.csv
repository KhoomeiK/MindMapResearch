ApplyingToCollege,fox638f,t3_ga0e2c,1588134988.0,"The deposit isn't really that much of a loss if you take into account the full picture of how much college actually costs. Think of it as similar to if you were accepted off a waitlist into your dream school after committing and depositing to another. For example, I originally committed to a school with a $300-400 deposit before deciding last minute to go somewhere else, and in the long run that $300-400 lost was more than made up in the financial difference between costs of the school. It's ultimately up to you, and both schools are great choices no matter what, but don't feel like the fees from Davis should play a factor. (Plus, like someone else said, I'm fairly certain housing can be refunded)"
ucla,fowu0qu,t3_ga03r5,1588127127.0,"I think UCs are making standardized tests optional (SAT/ACT) and relaxing some other requirements, but overall you need to put emphasis on good academics, community service, strong ECs with leadership/significant roles, etc"

ucla,fonquux,t3_g8j5n3,1587924684.0,"I took Psych 100A with Reise last quarter and ended with an A+. The textbook is free and online on Canvas, and if you get through the textbook easily then you'll be set. Quizzes are also administered online. Lectures are usually just review and were bruincasted so there wasn't a real need to go or watch lecture mostly. Overall it's a breeze if you can learn on your own, or if you need help seek it out from TAs"
