Broadcasting,fpje69m,t3_gdsior,1588665238.0,"So that splitter is "" HDCP COMPLIANT - WILL NOT BYPASS HDCP SIGNAL "" it's clearly on the list of features. The last one. What that means is when your xbox output and HDCP signal over HDMI, it won't split it to 2 devices.  That's most likely your problem

The Xbox should only output HDCP when it's playing a movie or netflix, but should work during games. 

Id send it back and get an different splitter, one that isn't HDCP compliant. Like this on from ViewHD

#1 thanks for making a nice short video. 10+ minute videos suck.

adding on to what's been posted, with regards to power, it's important to do the math. You didn't list the product you actually picked so I had to make guesses based on how they look in the video.

If you are delivery 5V & 2A thats 10 watts of power. I can't tell which Anker hub you used, but it looks like this: anker.com/products/variant/powerport-10/A2133111  This up max out at 12A @ 5V for 60watts total.  You could have just 6 of the RavPower chargers going at one time. 12 Amps total to distribute amongst the 10 ports.

With regards to the NF-P chargers, it looks like you chose this one: https://www.ravpower.com/products/rp-bc018-np-fz100-replacement-battery-charger-set
Which maxes out at 2A at 5Vs. According to their specs it takes 5 hours to charger a 2000mAh battery. Those 2000mAh batteries are 14.8 WH at 7.4 volts. A 74 Wh battery would need (74/14.8) * 5 = 5 * 5= 25 hours to charge full. If they're 6000 mAh lets just go with 6000/2000 * 5 hours to get 15 hours to charge fully.

Someone check my math."
