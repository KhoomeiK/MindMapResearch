UCSD,fpktqi9,t3_gdwnny,1588700878.0,Lots of people have been making Discord/Zoom study groups. You could try that too! It will keep you all mutually accountable.
UCSD,fp2dcmv,t3_garsoi,1588259790.0,"He's a guy who came from industry to teach college students so he could train competent chemists to go into industry, because he kept seeing incompetent college graduates. 

He knows organic chemistry is something people struggle with, and he knows people often end up just memorizing. I believed his UDED principle really got me through his course, and most definitely helped me pass my standardized exam for grad school. 

I don't know what experience you are speaking about, but the only ""tantrum"" I've seen from him is posted as a funny video to Facebook. I'm sorry you feel like he's belittling you and not being professional, but I hope you can get to know him and his teaching strategies more. There's a reason why his rmp rating is 4.2 but also has a 3.9 difficulty. He knows it is hard, he will make it hard, and he will make you work hard. 

To follow up on a different comment, Ternansky does care. There was a girl who was near failing, and she was in her senior year and had already been accepted to pharmacy school. If she got a D or failed this course, her admission would have been rescinded. She came into Ternansky's review in tears, and when he asked what was wrong, she burst out crying. She explained a bit about what was said above, and he asked about her current midterm scores, and how she was doing, and reassured her that she would pass. He took her outside for privacy after that, but she came back less teary, and ready to review. 

I guess I've been rambling a bit, but I'm just trying to say he's certainly tough, but I (and many others!) took his brusqueness as a challenge, and I believe you can too. I know you'll come out better at the end of it.

TBH you'd probably have a better experience in lecture, as he's probably very frustrated with Zoom, and trying to create online content. I wouldn't be surprised if he just gave old podcasts on the future."
calmhands,fop18zq,t3_g7dyw0,1587950857.0,Why do you suggest to not scrape the dirt under the nails?
UCSD,fooki85,t3_g8k3a8,1587940779.0,"I suggest having the blue light filter/night light on at all times. 

Additionally, Edge (I know, I know) has a free text to speech reader, you should try it out!"
calmhands,fo4dd4w,t1_fo4azh6,1587502404.0,Thanks! I think this may be helpful.
UCSD,fo24oha,t3_g2rpqr,1587449623.0,"Ugh yes. 

I have more work for this class than all my other classes combined."
whitewhale,fnnphau,t1_fncb30n,1587098068.0,"No, but thank you for the reply!"
whitewhale,fn4amdh,t1_fn42z6r,1586637456.0,No but thank you! These are just as funny.
UCSD,floo9zb,t3_fprose,1585342172.0,You should ask VAC. They will get back to you pretty quickly. Good luck!
