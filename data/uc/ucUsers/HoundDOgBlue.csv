China got away with Tiananmen Square, but Mexico got away with Tlatelolco. And India got away with 2002 Gujarat. And Israel got away with Gaza. And Saudi Arabia is currently getting away with Yemen. And Malaysia is currently getting away with the Rohingya. 


This is not me saying that we shouldn’t care about massacres, this is me saying that those in charge don’t, and most likely wont. If you really want to address these sorts of problems you can’t just make moral demands of the Chinese government. You need to make demands of an international system that has a long trackrecord of choosing profitability and “economic strategic interest” over the lives of protestors."
Bannerlord,fp721fl,t1_fp6p92j,1588362619.0,"Remember, you're feigning nobility. I also see it as the available recruits representing volunteers, just young men that want to adventure or fight for spoils. You pay the landlords, gangleaders or merchants a small sum to account for a slight change in manpower and in return, you get an eager potential warrior. 

&#x200B;

I think it's a fun headcanon that makes you feel a bit responsible for the men you recruit. Or it doesn't, your choice."
Bannerlord,fp70zj3,t1_fp5du13,1588362076.0,"Stat-wise, Bannerknights are slightly better than Elite Cataphracts. It's only a 20-point difference in one-handed, so it basically doesn't matter.

&#x200B;

Otherwise, cataphract armor is a lot better than the armor bannerknights wear, so Elite Cataphracts are for sure the best heavy cav in the game. Between the two factions, though, Vlandia is better cav-wise just by sheer numbers. Even if you're going for a thematic build, I think the bannerknight is the main symbol of Vlandian power while the Empire, based off of Rome, would view the Legionary as the main symbol of its military power.

All things considered though, Khuzaits are gang and their lancers are incredible."

2. obviously

3. Yes, obesity is absolutely a problem, but fat-shaming is shown to be an ineffective way of getting people to change their behavior

4. Obviously

5. I couldn't find that, though I did find [this](https://transcare.ucsd.edu/guidelines/youth) that cites a study in the Netherlands that seems to show marked improvements in the psychological wellbeing of trans kids and adolescents being given hormone therapy

6. [this](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/all/themes/hdr_theme/country-notes/SWE.pdf) seems to indicate that Sweden's HDI isn't declining, but rather growing at a slower rate. I wouldn't be surprised if letting in a bunch of refugees from one of the poorest places on Earth wouldn't lead to a slight decline in human welfare, just accounting for the differences between populations up until the point they are integrated with one another.

7. Yup. The idea that a woman earns 70c for every dollar a man in the same job earns is stupid, sure. Job choices obviously account for that difference, though there are studies that show diverse representation in media leads to individuals within those groups being more likely to pursue a career in that field.

totalwar,fom8ys2,t1_fom81b8,1587881870.0,"Against enemies that can do a ton of damage back and potentially even kill the dragon (ie, kholek, kharibdyss, dreadsaurian) you can mitigate damage by cycle-charging and by making good use of breath attacks. 

Star dragons have the most powerful breath attack in the game, and it is narrower compared to other dragons. While this makes it slightly less efficacious against a typical unit, if you position it above an enemy single-model unit and use the breath attack on it, it will do an incredible amount of damage.


Basically, a star dragon (and dragons in general) are probably the best single-model units in the game (besides some lords and heroes) because while you cant leave them in a fight against kholek, you aren’t really supposed to. They’re faster and they can fly, and the amount of utility that provides in conjunction with an already beastly statline makes them worldbeaters."

seriously, none of you have any idea what we could or should do against china. you just want to have a reason to scream at the tv like every other unhappy suburbanite ameretard.



if you are more mad at china than you are at a completely inadequate healthcare system or the herds of baying small business hogs chanting “turn me into fuel”, youre a joke and you need to be given a swirly.*

I've experienced the Northern empire being owned more than I've experienced the hunger issues, but resolving both doesn't seem like it would be too hard."
