Coronavirus,fofsy38,t1_fofs1dg,1587742265.0,"South Korea was able to test every citizen and do intense contact tracing. Americans are not equipped with tests and are not ready to give up some of their liberties like South Korea. Additionally, South Korea responded quickly and locked down before the U.S., so they are merely ahead of schedule. Even still, they are experiencing a major uptick in cases with the relaxation of quarantine. There is no way America can safely lift quarantine in the near future without killing a ton of people."

berkeley,fo9104k,t3_g6d1z7,1587608112.0,Just signed a lease today with a COVID provision. I won’t owe rent until campus is reopened. I highly recommend this route.
berkeley,fo90rzl,t3_g63vf4,1587607971.0,"Find a place with a COVID clause!! I just signed my lease today with Cedar Properties and they have a provision basically saying I wouldn’t owe rent for fall semester if school was pushed back. I know a couple other companies are offering similar provisions. It’s nice knowing I have a place to stay, but am not trapped into a lease if school moves online."
berkeley,fo8sbtw,t1_fo814hn,1587602818.0,"I worry about most classes being in-person from a safety perspective. Some reports are predicting a more severe second wave peaking around November and college campuses are notorious for spreading infectious diseases. I’m skeptical that the University would be able to implement sufficient social distancing measures by August. Additionally, having that many students migrate into one area from different parts of the country is not a recipe for success. I’ll probably defer my enrollment if classes are online because I’m definitely not paying tuition, but I think we should focus on what the best option for the student population is – even if it’s not at all desirable."
berkeley,fo8ldwk,t1_fo7xpyq,1587598835.0,"Another complication would be grading too. I think it would be tricky to implement a universal grading system that would be fair to both in-person and online students, seeing as some would physically not have the option to return to campus. It would certainly put students at an advantage/disadvantage."
berkeley,fo7u0n6,t3_g67luu,1587584529.0,"It’s hard to say definitively because people have vastly different experiences with the same management companies. I would say pay attention to the reviews on the specific property you’re considering and focus on a COVID-19 release clause (if you don’t want to live in Berkeley for an online semester). I’m renting from Cedar Properties this upcoming year and they’ve been very accommodating, but I can’t speak to the landlord aspect yet."
berkeley,fo7tcan,t3_g67cmm,1587584198.0,"Almost rented from them this year before I read up on all the horrific reviews. I’m sure some people had decent experiences, but I wouldn’t risk it especially with COVID-19 complicating matters."

It could be totally wrong, but that’s why I had originally favored cancelling the semester. If it makes things more complicated I see why online would make more sense"
berkeley,fnqcjql,t1_fnqboyn,1587161959.0,"I see your point. But coming from a family that is a bit tight on money, I’d much rather be economical when it comes to my parent’s savings. Additionally, it would give me an entire semester to work and save up for college. I know many other people in a similar situation as me, which is why I assumed online class was more universally hated."
berkeley,fnqc4i0,t1_fnqb82x,1587161738.0,"Maybe I’m coming across wrong;
Personally, I would rather they cancel the semester because I am not a senior. I am also not informed about the repercussions of doing so which is why I wanted to make this post.

Originally, I thought it would just be saving the university money and allow professors/TA’s/etc to make other arrangements for work instead of an uncertain cut in demand. I see now that is not the case. Some seniors do not have other options.

My goal or intent is not to be selfish, I genuinely was not aware what the drawbacks would be"
berkeley,fnq9lz2,t1_fnq8ja9,1587160338.0,I guess as long as the professors and TA’s and all the staff continue to receive full pay. Do you think it could effect wages with so many kids deferring?
berkeley,fnq96r1,t1_fnq8h14,1587160100.0,"To each their own, but from my perspective that’s a huge amount of money to throw away for the sake of graduating on time. Especially when a large percentage of the population is unemployed and money is tight. Additionally many aspects of life have had to be revised, so I don’t know how much weight graduating on time would carry.

Again, I’m not saying in any form that we should petition the school to cancel fall semester, but from my perspective it would make sense to cancel it. I’m curious to see what the counter arguments are. Not trying to prevent anyone from doing anything"
berkeley,fnq85zh,t1_fnq7u7k,1587159533.0,"I understand people need to graduate on time. But if there’s one thing I learned from this semester, it’s that online classes are very ineffective at teaching.

I wrote this post because I’m curious where people stand. On the one hand, seniors can graduate on time. On the other, they cannot complete any research or learn from the (very expensive) classes they enroll in."
berkeley,fne9x9i,t3_g181jn,1586885616.0,"You can definitely contact the university after housing contracts are offered to see if you can switch the rooms around. But honestly, I wouldn't rely on rooming with your friends. It will encourage you to get out and meet new people if you don't room with people you already know.  

You don't *have* to apply for triples, but most freshmen end up in them. It all depends on how much you're willing to pay and how lucky you get. 

Foothill is pretty far from the other dorms and tends to be a little quieter. I wouldn't categorize the dorms by major because they don't group students by academic interest. Any dorm will be good for your major. Hope this helps!"
