UCI,fnk7zjt,t1_fnjzqkn,1587017761.0,"Hey! Just trying to include my slate, Step Up, in the conversation, too! We're only 4 people (but we're committed!) and we're not affiliating ourselves with a larger organization, so it's been hard getting our name out there in a purely online campaign, but as you can see, we're still trying! Give our statements a read over if you can on the elections page!"

UCI,fnjzcdi,t1_fnjx2vk,1587010657.0,"Hmm if I had to guess, it might be UCI deciding against making an agreement with their CS program then. Definitely worth reaching out to a counselor for doubts, just in case the agreement isn't on ASSIST for some reason."
UCI,fnjqn2n,t3_g264gy,1587004740.0,"Agreed! Most of the school year is nothing like this, we promise. It's way more light-hearted most of the time. When all of this dies down, you can see how we get back to gushing over cute food delivery bots and Petr stickers."
UCI,fnjqbnp,t3_g267ou,1587004536.0,"Hey! As a current candidate running, I'll give you my perspective.

ASB in high school felt like little more than a party planning committee. They didn't control much except maybe the theme for prom and school rallies. When I first got here,  I thought that college student government might be more or less the same thing.

However, this year was a huge awakening for a lot of people -- me included. ASUCI controls a budget of over $2 million a year (funded through student fees), and that can have huuuge consequences depending on how it's allocated.

For example, 48% of students on campus experience some degree of low food security. That money could go towards helping alleviate that problem through increasing funding for essential services, like our FRESH Hub that helps students with groceries on a week-to-week basis. This money could also be poured into scholarships, new projects, clinics, etc. Anything students need really!

The example you'll probably hear most often right now is the Womxn's Hub referendum, which provides a whole host of crucial services for students. Through ASUCI, students can enact a voluntary $6 fee to boost funding for the Womxn's Hub, which adds up to a lot across many students!

I'm running because I think the millions we collect can be used in better ways than it currently is being allocated, especially when left in savings. A lot of people feel the same way! These services really help people with their lives, and they need them to properly pursue their education here. If anything, it should be really uplifting to see how many people are actively involved and arguing about these issues and removing the corruption that manages such a huge budget - at least, it is for me!"
UCI,fnirdjb,t1_fniolbm,1586985020.0,"Hey don't forget us! We're Step Up, a small slate trying to make some real changes.

I'm the ICS candidate - Mayank Sharma. None of us have a history in the toxic dealings of ASUCI because we're all outsiders to it. If you, as a student voter, feel confident that your candidate is honest and committed after doing your research on them, all the power to you! Cast that ballot and be heard!

If you have doubts and think you want to vote for something new, think about Stepping Up with us! We're open to questions, comments, and concerns and try to reply as soon as we can! We have candidate facebook pages, too!"

UCI,fniigz9,t3_g1z2jh,1586980560.0,THIS! Don't let all the political noise make you forget that there are some incredible workers and services on campus that are carrying on regardless of who gets elected - and they need your help! Please support the Womxn's Hub referendum!
UCI,fngly4z,t1_fngdz6j,1586936571.0,"Can confirm that you only pay for 8 during the entire summer!

As for 10-week classes, they count as 2 units for each summer session. This means that, since you have a 10-unit cap for each summer session, you can take 2 classes each summer session and 1 10-week class for a total of 20 units (5 4-unit classes) for the price of 8.

EDIT: some phrasing"

UCI,fnazcja,t1_fnawtzh,1586806503.0,"I'm gonna hijack this comment for a bit of self-promotion of another alternative: I'm a candidate from Step Up (Mayank Sharma, running for ICS Senate) - we're a small but energetic slate of ASUCI outsiders that want to make sure that the voices of those who are sick of the toxic norms in student government are heard.

Given that there are just 4 of us, it's been hard to cut through the noise with a single clear voice. I hope you'll consider us as determined individuals who speak from the perspective of students frustrated with the state of ASUCI. We all have candidate statements available on the elections website (kindly linked above!) and my own facebook event is here: [https://www.facebook.com/events/678597892905722/?active\_tab=about](https://www.facebook.com/events/678597892905722/?active_tab=about)

All in all, OP, thank you for taking the time to vote and research candidates - that's definitely an encouraging sign that people want change after this last year. I hope more people do as you do and make an informed decision, regardless of who it's for."
UCI,fnajndr,t1_fn9jn5z,1586798658.0,"Hey there!

One of the most commonly cited issues I've heard from the ICS community is the insecurity of feeling prepared for industry because 1) students don't feel as if they're learning the necessary tech skills in the classroom to be ready for internships/jobs and 2) insane competition from those who have had resources to explore technology and develop portfolios in high school. These manifest in impostor syndrome for a lot of students, and it makes it just that much harder to feel like you deserve the resources you need to be a competitive ICS student. I'd like to highlight that this is especially true for women and underrepresented minorities within the scope of CS, and many individuals belonging to these communities have told me stories about how they've been slighted and demeaned compared to other peers.

There are a few ways to address this that I think are worth exploring and are rooted in a basic concept: experiences breed confidence. I'll mention a couple with some depth here.

1. Provide scholarships and funding for entrepreneurial students that want to start tech initiatives on campus. This will allow students who have ideas to improve campus life to flesh them out into working models and projects with support in the form of both capital and mentorship. A set of grants should also be made available to ICS student organizations that would like to run any long-term projects that could help the community without worrying about cutting into their budgets. This also has the secondary benefit of revitalizing a lot of outdated campus technology (and we all are a little too familiar with these I'm sure) since students are incentivized to direct their talents toward technology issues on campus. ASUCI can actually start these types of scholarships without much difficulty - there is a TON of money available to support these projects that has gone into reserves instead.

2. Increase student-professor engagement through research fairs. There's a huge disconnect for a lot of students between themselves and their faculty - which is natural if you only engage each other during lecture halls. Office hours can also be intimidating for a lot of students, especially if you'd like to talk to a professor you don't have a class with but might be interested in exploring their area of expertise. It's also hard to get an accurate depiction of academia for a lot of people interested in research or teaching careers. Research fairs, built along the lines of science fairs, would be a great way to increase engagement between students and teaching faculty (including tenured professors, assistant professors, and graduate students) so that students can better look to their professors and TAs as not just teachers passionate about their subjects, but also models of successful careers in academia. I also think it would help some professors understand more about where their students are at in terms of their career interests, which is a good start to improving classroom communication as well.

I'll also briefly mention other ideas I had (we could have conversations for hours about these and more so I won't go on too long) but I'd also like to explore creating a centralized ""job board"" for students who'd like to collaborate with other students, working with departments to modernize websites, student mentorship programs specifically within ICS alone, and more. I hope this response helped give you an idea of the kinds of changes I'd like to see in our ICS community."
UCI,fn8c06s,t1_fn89hk6,1586738291.0,"Hey! Mayank here! 

All of us on the slate have had that same problem with ASUCI: everyone talks a big game about transparency and honesty. The other slates that have politicians running for reelection already had a chance to live up to that, and then just didn't. But they'll still campaign on it nonetheless.

One of the things we want to emphasize that's distinct from the other slates is that none of us are part of the old ASUCI cliques that have already had opportunities to stop corruption. We're a smaller slate because we're bonded through an honest effort to introduce an honest voice into ASUCI, so we could avoid joining with those who we believed would only further the toxicity. We refused offers to merge with other slates for this exact reason.

To use myself as an example, I will be refusing the Senate salary if elected. I will also be publishing a couple visuals later today that will show how ASUCI has been letting more money sit in reserves over the past few years as it ignores a declining voter turnout in students - things that ASUCI does not advertise for obvious reasons. I found these through my own research, and I hope it stands as a testimony as to how much we intend on communicating transparently once elected.

I know it can be hard to trust anyone running, but we ask that you take a chance on us and let students who are equally fed up with ASUCI over our time here finally get a chance at directing it toward students.

The visuals will be on my FB event page here: [https://www.facebook.com/events/678597892905722/](https://www.facebook.com/events/678597892905722/)"
