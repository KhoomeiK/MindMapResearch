UCSantaBarbara,fplo1j7,t3_gcyvek,1588716220.0,Lol legit this is exactly what I thought before going here but tbh UCSB being a party school DOES NOT mean you need to party to be able to fit in. I’m more of a homebody and I don’t like partying at all and nobody judges you or dislikes you based on that and you will find people who are just like you. You are who you hang out with so don’t worry if you can’t fit in if you don’t party. You don’t have to.
LSAT,fpc88as,t3_gcgbjb,1588490961.0,I'm so sorry for your loss but hey hang in there body! Like someone else said in this thread do this for your mom! Imagine how proud and happy she must be when she sees a 170+ and you thriving in a biglaw! Best of luck to you :)
UCSantaBarbara,fpc76ah,t3_gcg3ri,1588489904.0,Smh this is why i don't think that we can go back to campus this fall
UCSantaBarbara,fox6t04,t1_fox3ycd,1588135501.0,Really? Can you tell me a bit more about this class? I was planning to take it sometime in the future
UCSantaBarbara,fox6aix,t3_g9xia3,1588135134.0,Lol tbh just google LSAR 2020-2021 and you will know which GEs to take lol I struggled so much picking classes during orientation last years and my orientation staffer tho she was nice and chill she didn’t explain things clear enough so there was a lot of confusion at least for me. Tbh it’s not even that difficult just figure out which APs satisfy which GEs from the LASAR and then pick GEs that you still need
LSAT,fosiyqx,t3_g9bb5y,1588031628.0,Dang that’s a really nice score for a first-time taker lol I wish I would score that high on my first diagnostic
UCSantaBarbara,foq3w4r,t3_g8bhr4,1587982065.0,"Is it ENGL 23? I took it too during winter and I'm pretty sure it will show up on GOLD. If you have also taken another area E GE then sometimes the GOLD system will choose whichever course it displays in your GE progress report. For example, I took PHIL 3 which is another area E GE, and ENGL 23 was replaced by PHIL 3, but once I dropped PHIL 3 it came back up. If it's completely gone from your course history like it's not even on your transcript then you would want to contact the office of registrar about it."
UCSantaBarbara,fooyfbq,t3_g8mmns,1587949117.0,Yes I’m totally down for this! I love singing and music so performance would be great :)
LSAT,foejjel,t1_foe7qsp,1587705436.0,Hey there would you mind sharing the prep tests with me as well? Thanks!
UCSantaBarbara,fnyp1xv,t3_g3gglg,1587370365.0,No cuz taking two classes during each session manageable and usually you will be pretty busy if u r taking 3 courses instead. Summer sessions are 6 weeks long but the materials are the same so the classes were pretty intense and fast-paced
UCSantaBarbara,fnyokji,t1_fnwpkm4,1587369879.0,"I’m so sorry to hear this! I hope you can maybe talk to your family and others at home and let them know your class schedule so they would know to keep it down a lil bit when you r in class or working, or ask to borrow one of the other rooms at home just for studying! All the best :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fnyoe8i,t3_g46rhp,1587369700.0,"Ughhhhh no worries fam I relate here

I never felt so unproductive in my life before like I was taking 18 units at the beginning of this quarter cuz I took 19 units last quarter and I did fine so I thought I could try it again this quarter. But nope lol I really overestimated my productivity at home like there are just so many distractions at home compared to at the library and tbh I rly miss the library and the quiet studying environment of the 8th floor ocean room which I always went to. 

And like fr I also have a bunch of toddler siblings who just couldn’t keep their mouths shut for more than 2 seconds (“trouble two” ughh smh) and yea I already have difficulty focusing at work and the chaotic environment at home obviously didn’t help with the situation. So I ended up having to drop a few classes so I could catch up with the readings and assignments. I’m taking 12 units now and it’s not until now with 12 units that I could finally breathe for a bit and could have some work and relax balance in my days lol. Yea never thought I would take 12 units for any quarter cuz I was always capable of taking more but obviously that’s not the case for this quarter online and at home. Hope everybody is doing okay and coping with the current situation. Stay at home, drink water and wash dem hands :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fntlqyd,t3_g3tvmx,1587244198.0,Honestly what does that even mean lmao “public worms”?????? AS really be running out of ideas to charge us
UCSantaBarbara,fno4257,t3_g2jh9n,1587111283.0,Social distancing much?
UCSantaBarbara,fnklo9o,t1_fnkgn0a,1587031828.0,They will ask you if you would like to purchase one for the school year or if you want to waive it with your own insurance. It's an extra $1000
UCSantaBarbara,fnk8a92,t3_g25og6,1587018030.0,"LMAO you definitely don't need a car here everyone just bikes everywhere lol. I would definitely suggest getting a bike and it's really handy and you can literally leave 5 min before class and still get there on time.

In terms of the pharmacy we do have one at our student health but i'm pretty sure you can find some CVS close by that will also take your school insurance if you decide to purchase one. Contact student health and they'll provide you with a list of pharmacies in the SB area that accept the school insurance."
