nintendo,folkvko,t3_g7vuf0,1587864432.0,"I’d like to enter by talking about how much I miss small acts of appreciation. Instead of seeing a person on the street and working to avoid them, to be able to smile or say hi will be a new treat!"
JoeBiden,fol6mwe,t1_fokbgsg,1587855914.0,Yes. Dunno how though lol

AskLosAngeles,fnn0qsg,t1_fnmzztt,1587081971.0,80 meals definitely feels like more than something. Feeds a family of 4 for 6.67 days. Close to a week.
JoeBiden,fngpikk,t1_fngcvbb,1586940169.0,I believe Joe has an infamous sweet tooth for ice cream. There are many photos of him with a soft-serve cone
AskLosAngeles,fncrakt,t3_g0y2lu,1586844655.0,My local Ralph’s (Westwood village) has normal 7-11 hours. I think they just bullshit you

ucla,fmtka6h,t1_fmtgm0p,1586374173.0,"Try the registrar as well, since they’re in charge of maintaining your registration record. They may be willing to extend the deadline by a week or two!"

JoeBiden,fmmoj72,t1_fmlw9ts,1586209083.0,"I disagree, as a member of #TeamPeteForever. He competed incredibly admirably, but circumstances stole his momentum and his heartbreaking performance in South Carolina, probably at least partially driven by media narratives, did him in. He stepped aside to avoid repeating the Republican party’s mistakes in 2016, which lead to Tromp."
apple,fmmivj4,t1_fmm9x9q,1586206076.0,"“Plus,” as used before, implied extra features. For the 6/6s/7/8, the Plus got things like Optical Image Stabilization and an extra camera. “Max” implies it’s just a bigger version of exactly the same phone. Which it is."
PS4,fmjgrc1,t3_fvlspr,1586129998.0,Awesome! Hope someone deserving gets it!
