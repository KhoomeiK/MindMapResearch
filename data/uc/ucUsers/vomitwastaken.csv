ucr,fpl87h7,t3_ge4ehx,1588708091.0,"The reason u hear mixed opinions on this is bc it really depends on who ur professors are and even more so what you excel in 

I triple threat one quarter and passed but in hindsight it’s one of those quarters where I’m like “how did I even do that?” I’m sure a lot of people feel the same way"

ucr,fp7at06,t1_fp71dam,1588367149.0,"I understand ur concern but in all honesty the school really is trying it’s best. I heard they lost about $300 million dollars in just the month of March, mostly from them being willing to give students refunds with housing and dining. At the end of the day there’s still a school that needs to run (albeit in very ineffectively in regards to teaching). 

Plus they’re giving an extra thousand dollars to students with children according to this email. As someone without kids I’m glad the school at least recognizes that some students need money more than others. 

Fuck that change things sign I wish the money they used from that could’ve been used for something else"

ucr,foksrp6,t3_g7xkkj,1587848249.0,I remember my first night at AI waiting and waiting for it to be late night so I could shower when no one else was in the bathroom thinking “fuck I knew I should’ve picked pentland so I could shower when I want” the entire time. Not even three days later it felt normal. I could even carry a casual convo with whoever was in the shower stall next to me
ucr,foksasy,t3_g7yk3k,1587847991.0,"I have no regrets looking back on AI. It does look a little dingy but I didn’t mind. Cool thing is that is closest to campus and it has its own dining hall. People say it’s the “social dorm” but it’s honestly some combination of just luck and how willing you are to make friends with ur hallmates though. I know people in lotian/peatland who said they they were pretty close with their hallmates, and I know people in AI who said their halls were antisocial"

ucr,foikul7,t1_fohqf6o,1587789207.0,"Last quarter prof emailed everyone during online final saying “I know what you’re all doing and it’s considered cheating” and continued to email us every other hour throughout the day updating who will be considered academically dishonest and who won’t, often with messages like “I can’t believe a group of humans would stoop so low as to take advantage of the situation were all in for their own benefit”. It was like getting a notification every other hour for the day of how the guy was disappointed in everyone. It was a real show the way it unfolded"

Just Give In/Never Going Home really left it’s mark on me since I discovered it in 2017, I love it so much.

Yeah I’m not sure what u should do besides wait. I mean u probably can’t get ur money back from rcc (or ur time). Hope it works out and transfers over though"

ucr,fnydl1l,t3_g4lgg2,1587359996.0,The same thing happened to my senior year but honestly I'm glad. First of all I'm in way less debt than I would've been if I went to Irvine. Plus I really like the student experience we got going on. Like I thought it would be so different because it's location but the people here are just like anywhere else. Food on campus (in my experience) isn't that bad but then again there are some pretty bomb places nearby too. If ur STEM pre-med students can be pretty competitive about GPA and test averages but not soo much that they'll ruin the curve.

ucr,fnqigod,t1_fnpyy3g,1587165263.0,"Look all I'm saying is I know people who were placed in math courses that they were not supposed to be in. Made their first quarter way more hectic than it needed to be, they even failed two classes (which is not the end of the world, it happens). If OP can handle calc and chem your first quarter then by all means they should go right on ahead, I think the MAE is a great way determine that. By no means should someone try to score beyond their abilities on it though"

ucr,fnpx1ih,t3_g38vwq,1587153550.0,My best advice is don’t study. Placing into a math class that’s not your appropriate level will make your life as a freshman a whole lot harder. Plus who cares if u don’t take chem 1a fall of your freshman year? I didn’t and neither did thousands of other first years when I started and we’re all okay :)
