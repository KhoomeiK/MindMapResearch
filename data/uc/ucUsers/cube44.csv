My house has been heading to the beach together pretty regularly and since we’re a pretty large group we get a lot of dirty looks but we’ve been strict about not making real contact with anyone besides ourselves."
solotravel,fp0k2k7,t1_fp0c2t1,1588210841.0,I’d throw Pier 39 on this list as well.
UCSantaBarbara,fp0fdgw,t1_fp07wpv,1588208188.0,"Not management consulting, but a few undergrads will get offers for advisory positions that are independent of audit and tax. These positions are a good bit more competitive though and not heavily recruited as the B4 don't want to lose potential audit candidates by having a bunch of people apply for advisory positions they're less likely to get.

Feel free to PM me if you have more questions about this, I went through the whole recruiting process and I'm now a campus ambassador."

Read the comments on some of those Instagram posts there will be people there asking the same thing."
samharris,fosbcha,t3_g99l9t,1588027401.0,Does Sam actually run his Instagram account? Some of the recent postings seems a little out of character for him.

UCSantaBarbara,fo4pyx1,t1_fo4oxxg,1587508978.0,"I hear you, but joining every other department in accepting the p/np policy isn't too much of a favor considering the circumstances."
