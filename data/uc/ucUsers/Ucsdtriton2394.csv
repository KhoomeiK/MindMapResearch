UCSD,fnitri1,t1_fng9gah,1586986217.0,I had MCWP 50 at 8 am last year and it took me an hour to an hour and a a half to get to school... I was never late lol being on time really isnâ€™t that hard
DavidDobrik,fn8eaja,t1_fn7yydw,1586739708.0,Lmao this doesnâ€™t even have anything to do with the fact that sheâ€™s a woman.. If it was Zane Iâ€™d be annoyed too. The whole point is that many people enjoy the podcast because of the dynamic that JASON AND DAVID have.
UCSD,fmwsc4v,t1_fmwrgl6,1586452163.0,Yeah I think by may they will have a decision... the thing is tho if they make fall quarter online then they would have to make the WHOLE year online?? cuz students who would live off campus would have a hard time finding a lease for less than 12 months
