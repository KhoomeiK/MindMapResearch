StarWars,fpfnlg1,t3_gczctt,1588576959.0,"Completely agree with you. TCW is a great series, but the prequels (specifically episodes 1 & 3) were always solid movies in their own right. Visual effects & sound design were out of this world, as was the world building, art direction, and thematic elements. Easily my favorite of the 3 trilogies, though I'll admit I am biased as someone who grew up with them."
StarWars,fp6zm98,t1_fp6y9sf,1588361384.0,Maybe. Depends on whether the chips were programmed by Sidious or the Kaminoans.
StarWars,fp6zkcq,t1_fp6yec9,1588361356.0,"Were the chips programmed by the Kaminoans or Sidious? I think that would help clear the issue up.

When Anakin sees the vision that he will become evil, we see Palpatine use force lightning."

UCI,fmpt11b,t3_fwnbka,1586286801.0,Does ASUCI get paid?

While I haven't gone through the trauma you and your daughter have faced, I have met & observed others who've been in similar situations.

1. Talk to your mother about this. She's more experienced and can help you break the ice. That being said, don't have her take your side 100% of the time. Your daughter may lose faith in her (teenagers like it when they are in the right).
2. Tell your daughter that you messed up & don't hide anything. She's at the age where she can understand the situation.
3. Explain to your daughter that even though you were highly at fault, it isn't right for her to take out all the anger out on you (the wording should be a bit more pleasant than this, teenagers are quick to react angrily). The person who's been causing you both stress is the step-father. Tell her that story about being held at gunpoint by the step-father & that if that you had lost your life, she would have suffered terribly at the hands of the step-father. Also mention to her your own fear, but make sure to put your daughter's needs & safety before your own.
4. Tell her that you want to start fresh. Let her know that she'll be the first and main priority in your life & you won't try to find another man. NOTE: If you actually tell her this stuff, keep your word. There is nothing that a child hates more than their parent going back on their word.
5. Have your mother be constantly present throughout this conversation, giving a more nuanced & analytical take. Have her criticize you at points, but also make it clear that she ultimately agrees with the general message you are sending. Having her say something like how she wishes for her family to get along might help.
6. Be prepared to handle the daughters retorts. Snarky comments, mean words, etc. Don't get too upset when this happens & don't argue with her when she says these things. Tell her she's right in someways, but also give valid counterpoints for her to consider.
7. The day after the argument, try doing normal things with her and your mom. See how it goes.

This isn't guaranteed to work, but it should be at least somewhat helpful. I'd go over this plan with your mom and therapist to see if its a good plan."
