UCSD,fp1kr4h,t1_fozot66,1588238896.0,"I honestly don't see what's so bad about walking from on college to another to eat? Campus isn't that big, it should take 15 minutes tops and besides, walking is healthy. Walking everywhere is the one thing I miss about campus."
mildlyinteresting,foswjqe,t1_fosqmt9,1588039532.0,...Do you honestly think that was funny?
UCSD,fopvj3r,t3_g8p0pv,1587973538.0,"I did HCI major/CS minor. If you're actually interested in AI and you're good with math, go for the ML route. I was really interested in it, but after taking a couple ML classes I decided against it. HCI is slightly easier imo, and it's actually a great way to get some front-end experience. It'll be hard to get into CS classes as a non-major, but you can do it. 

Feel free to DM me if you have any questions."
UCSD,foptos2,t3_g8vncp,1587971791.0,Kinda in the same situation so I suggest e-mailing the financial aid office since every case is unique.
AskReddit,fnucm1l,t1_fnmbiui,1587259167.0,"Yep, the very beginning of a greater story."
AskReddit,fnmatku,t1_fnlax0v,1587068101.0,"You can read the light novels, the anime adapted the earlier books, the story is still going."
UCSD,fnbuabx,t3_g0sydj,1586822457.0,"I honestly understand what you're trying to say here, I complained about this myself, but still: Welcome to college."
UCSD,fmdkemw,t1_fm9f1hx,1585970098.0,"Well I mean, those two paths are entirely different from each other and it's a matter of asking yourself what you'd like to do with your life. 

Then again, I'd tell you to choose CogSci/CS at UCSD because, in my very biased opinion, you're gonna have an easier time studying that over biomedical engineering. I have friends studying Bio-related majors and they're always stressed out in comparison to CogSci/CS majors. You'd have to really like Biomed Eng to study it, and based on the question you just asked, I don't think you'd like it.

DM me if you have any more questions."
