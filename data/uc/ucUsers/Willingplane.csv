And no, you do not ""volunteer"" for the NHS, at least not according to your past posts, where you claimed that you WORK for the NHS, as a psychotherapist.  That's called a JOB, and certainly does not qualify as volunteering, much less, helping those most vulnerable at risk of dying from Covid!  And you don't post on other Covid subs, do you? Yeah, sure you care. 

I can't even believe you use Wuhan as an example.  No one has any idea what's going on in Wuhan, it's a communist dictatorship. 

How about Sweden, where only the vulnerable are being asked to remain at home?  Their Covid death rate is lower than the UK!   

Check my past posts, you will see I've posted about my volunteer delivery work, long before I became a skeptic, and also post frequently in the r/iPad sub, encouraging others to donate old iPads as I do, instead of throwing them out.  

I am NOT placing vulnerable at risk, that was another one of your self-sanctimonious assumptions!  When I deliver food, I wear a mask, gloves, which I spray down with a 70% alcohol solution between each delivery.  I knock or ring the bell, place the food on a chair outside their door, and back away.  --  all of which I've clearly stated before in my past posts!  Go check!  

I stayed in my house for a month, only leaving for deliveries, until some of my shut-ins asked if there was anyway they could get some of the food from their home countries. So I went to an international food mart.  I was one of the ONLY customers there wearing a mask! Other customers laughed at me!  Entire families were shopping, eating and socializing in the food courts -- kids running everywhere, like little banshees, hundreds of them! Then I drove past a playground and the park -- people everywhere!  Playing!  Picnicing!  barbecuing!  NO masks, and NO social distancing whatsoever! 

I checked the Covid stats for my area -- 32 cases, NO hospitalizations and ZERO deaths!  And this was AFTER the lockdown had been in effect for a month!  

Then I checked with the hospital (5 minute walk from my house). Not only did they not need any help, there's no one there! They're only operating at about 20- 25% capacity and are laying people off!  Because of the lockdown, they're were forced to cancel ALL elective procedures, and most non-Covid related treatments!  They're not even allowed to perform screening tests for cancer!  So people with cancer won't get diagnosed in time, and just die instead?  OH, and no one is going to the emergency room, they'd rather die of heart attacks at home, for fear of Covid!  All of this is in my past posts, and more!  

22 million people in the U.S. have lost their jobs because of the shut down, throwing entire families into poverty!  IF you actually Knew anything about mental health (which I doubt) then you should be aware of the devestation this is causing;  depression, anxiety, hunger, alcohol and drug abuse, despair, suicide, domestic violence -- just to name a few!  How about abused children, now forced to remain in homes with their abusers?    Do you care about them?  

How many MORE people will die from the ramifications of this lockdown, than die from the disease itself?"
LockdownSkepticism,fo1tqeu,t1_fo0zqr2,1587441308.0,"The lockdown was never even intended to save lives by preventing people from getting infected.  The sole purpose has always been just to slow down the infection rate, buy some time,  -- so the hospitals wouldn't get overwhelmed.   That's all.  

If the infection had spread as rapidly as they initially thought, and the hospitals had become overwhelmed, more people might have died due to the inability to treat all of them. But that hasn't happened and it's not actually saving anyone's life, just delaying the inevitable.  

So the question is really, is the cost of just delaying the inevitable worth the cost to society as a whole?  

22 million have already lost their jobs, throwing entire families into poverty, resulting in depression, anxiety, hunger, homelessness, alcohol and drug abuse, despair, suicide, etc. 

Medical treatments for, well, practically everything  else have all been cancelled, including screen tests for cancer -- which now may not be diagnosed in time to successfully treat.  People are dying of heart attacks at home rather than go to the hospital for fear of Covid.  People are not allowed to be with their dying family members, to comfort and say their last goodbyes -- all for fear of Covid.  

Destroying the economy and devastating tens of millions of of people's lives, is not going to actually going to prevent Covid deaths, it will only delay some of them.  I don't see how this is worth it."

The lockdown was never going to stop the virus from eventually infecting virtually everyone.  The same number of people will eventually still get sick, and a certain percentage will still die, regardless.

But it's become quickly  apparent that all the predictions were completely off.   The hospitals are not even close to being overwhelmed.

Stewart may not have watched the future, but Lyndon's death was already in the past.  Also, I'm pretty sure it was Lynden who said he never watched the future, when he as standing on the bridge with Katie.  

Stewart actually had watched the future, as shown when he was in the room with the rest of the team, and played a simulation for them,  1 second into the future. Stewart enjoyed their reactions, so doubt it was the first time or only time he peaked into the future.  

However, none of them could see the future past Lily's death, so that was as far as it went. 

He supposedly fired Lynden for breaking the rules, but when Lynden complained to Katie that they broke the rules all the time, Katie explained it was the multiverse theory that Forest couldn't accept.  

Katie knew the multiverse theory was correct, but only finally admitted this to Lynden on the bridge. Katie was the one who had been watched all the variations of the different simulations, and had accepted the multiverse theory as true. 

Forest never did, and that's why he willingly walked to his death, because he still believed he was on his ""tram line"", and believed he had no other choice, and there was no other outcome. 

It wasn't until Lily threw away the gun that he finally accepted the truth of the multiverse, realized that free will existed, and he had been wrong all along.

That was the last straw that pushed Stewart over the edge, resulting in his decision to kill Forest -- and make Katie watch, so she would feel the same pain at losing someone she loved, as he did.

Forest stubbornly continued to believe the results Lynden's algorithms produced were not real.  He refused to believe in the possibility of free will.  

It wasn't until Lily proved she could ""get off her tram line"" by throwing the gun away, that finally convinced Forest in the existence of free will, and that destiny could be changed, thus proving the existence of the multiverse theory as well. 

That's why, when Katie resurrected Forest, she explained the machine only worked using Lyden's algorithm and that she needed to make sure Forest understood what that meant.  She was actually asking Forest whether or not he wanted to be uploaded into the machine using Lyndon's algorithm, or if she should shut it down.  

Stewart assumed that Forest would tell Katie to shut it down, because he would not want to continue living inside the machine if there was no possibility being reunited with his wife and daughter in a falsified simulation, based the algorithm of a false theory.  Forest would have rather died with the belief that there was nothing he, or anyone else, could have done to prevent the death of his wife and daughter, that at was all predestined from the very beginning, and his death was as well.

She also knew the multiverse theory was real, and yet, willfully elected to manipulate Lynden into going over the edge by promising him that in the multiverses where he lived, he would get his job back at Devs, knowing full well that he died in every single one.  She murdered Lynden.  

I think Stewart watched those simulations too, and that's what pushed him over the edge.  He loved Lynden like a son, and Katie loved Forest.  I think Stewart stood there and waited to push that button to ensure Katie would be there to watch Forest die at his hand, so she would have to live with that same exact knowledge and pain.  Pure revenge, poetic justice. 

He also knew that Forest believed in predeterminism so strongly, that when when he was resurrected, he would have ordered Katie to shut the simulation down because he did not want to continue living without his wife and daughter, not even in a falsified simulation.   This is also why the machine could not see past Lily's death, because it assumed that it would be shut down, ending it's ability to formulate projections and simulations. 

By throwing away the gun, what Lily actually accomplished, was to change Forest's belief in predeterminism, and accept instead, the reality of the multiverses.  So when he was subsequently resurrected, instead of instructing Katie to shut the machine down, he instructed her place his consciousness in a multiverse where his family was still alive. Tossing the gun was the act that made Forest accept the multiverses as REAL.

What Lily changed was Forest's mind, and that changed everything."
Devs,fnpwt4h,t1_fnpum7t,1587153432.0,"I don't think so.  He was out to absolve himself of guilt for the deaths of his wife and daughter by proving he had no free will, and could not have acted in any other manner.  it was his sole reason for living and building the machine.  Once accomplished, would have accepted his impending death, and shut down the machine.  The entire purpose of the resurrection scene was for Katie to obtain Forest's decision. 

Your theory does not take into account the fact he fired Linden for providing evidence rejecting his theory, or the very reason Stewart pushed that button.

Stewart was always going to push that button, and I believe that was a direct result of watching Linden's death -- he knew that in every simulation, Linden fell to his death. Katie watched those simulations too, and knew the same thing, and Forest knew Katie watched those simulations.  Not only that, but her words promising Linden he would get his job back in the multiverses where he didn't fall, are what convinced him to do it, knowing all along that he fell to his death in every single simulation.   She even asked him if he ever watched the future, and he said no. She murdered him. 

I believe that's what pushed Stewart over the edge, resulting in his decision to push that button and end the simulation.  And I think he knew Forest believed so strongly in determinism, that he would have subsequently ordered Katie to shut it down.

Oh, and Stewart could have just broken the machine, or killed Forest in any number of ways, but he loved Linden like a son.  Katie loved Forest.  Stewart endured watching his loved one fall to his death at the hands of Katie, and he wanted Katie to watch Forest die by his hands, so she would have to live with same pain.  

In the final scene, Katie observes and mourns her lost love, inside the simulation, in the very same way that Forest did his wife and daughter."
Devs,fnpse81,t1_fnpdyl1,1587151132.0,"Forest was actually the ""being"" responsible for deciding whether or not to continue the existence of life inside the simulation. 

What Lily actually accomplished was to prove the existence of the multiverse to Forest.  IF she hadn't thrown away the gun, then when he was resurrected, he would have told his assistant to shut it all down because he did not wish to live in a simulation without his wife and daughter.  

Yes, both would have died regardless, but the machine would have been turned off.  It's also why the machine could not see past their death, because it would no longer have existed

That's what Lily changed."

He was lying,  I wasn't really fired.  They were going to lay off a temp. worker, and I asked them to lay me off instead.

I hope there's still time for you to appeal the decision, please do.  Just because a claim is initially denied, doesn't mean you can't fight, and win.

If you are fired, best way to fight a denial and win, is by claiming incompetence.  By that I mean you say that you tried really hard, but apparently weren't capable of doing what your boss wanted of you. You tried your best, but the more you tried, the more frustrated you became.

As far as fertilizer goes, that is not the issue.    The Govenor of Michigan closed the gardening centers -- you can still go to Home Depot and Walmart to shop, and buy all kinds of things, but the gardening section is closed and literally has yellow tape across it!  You can see all the gardening equipment and material, sitting right there, out in the open, but you can't buy any of it!  

It's not the fertilizer, or not being able to plant pretty flowers, they can't even buy seeds to plant vegetables to feed themselves!  At Walmart, you can buy packs of seeds as cheap as .20 - . 50 cents a pack, and no, they can not wait!  The growing season up north is much shorter, and you need to start your seeds RIGHT NOW or it will get cold and the plants will die before they can be harvested. 

No, you can't plant outside yet, you start your seeds inside, and transplant outside after the last frost, usually around Mother's Day. I have over 300 plants started -- fortunately, I live in Illinois. I grow a good half acre, to can, freeze and dry.  Still have at least 50 cans left from last season.  

There's a lot of poverty in Michigan, especially in the Upper Penninsula, and they depend on growing food for their very survival.  I know a lot of people in the UP, go up there almost every year to hunt -- if you don't thin the deer herd, the deer will overpopulate and starve to death--the very reason for deer hunting season, and only a limited number of licenses are granted, 1 deer per person.  Get a lot of venison off 1 deer, and can barter excess venison with farmers for eggs, milk, beef, etc.  Venison commands a premium, especially venison sausage, and the exchange rates are fairly good.  

This is how people survive on their minimum wage jobs up there. It's how they feed their families, which the Govenor just arbitrarily stripped away from them, and the situation is desperate.

LockdownSkepticism,fnjx7tc,t3_g1vttf,1587009151.0,"Apply for unemployment!  Do it now!  

I'll bet money that you will have no problem qualifying.  Unemployment only looks at the reason you left your most recent job. Even if you only worked a single week!  

The fact you got fired from the job before that is completely irrelevant, because the unemployment office will not even contact that employer. 

I worked in personnel and handled unemployment claims, and seriously, the unemployment office only contacts your most recent employer.  

Even if the employer before that fired you for cause, and even if that cause was justified, it doesn't matter.   It only matters if you got fired from your  very LAST job.

Unemployment will still combine all your earnings from the most recent 5 quarters of employment, and combine to arrive at your unemployment benefit amount.  It varies from state to state, but normally, as long as you have earnings in 2 or 3 of the last 5 quarters, you should be able to collect. 

PLUS!  Per the stimulus bill, you should also be eligible for the additional $600 per week for the next 4 months!  

So apply! Do it now!  The very worst they can do is say no, but I doubt that will happen.

And BTW, even if your last employer fired you, well, the burden of proof is on the employer.  Now, even if you were fired for violating company rules, in most states the employer would be required to provide documentation showing they gave you repeated written warnings and opportunities to correct the deficiency.  For example,might you were fired for showing up drunk, did they offer you any type of rehab program?  If not, in many states, unemployment will usually still grant benefits.  Even if you told your boss off, and refused to do something, was the request reasonable?  Did the boss behave in a professional manner?  If not, unemployment will usually still grant benefits. 

Your state unemployment gets to decide, not your last employer.  And unemployment case workers have crappy bosses too, and will normally give the benefit of doubt to employees, and grant unemployment benefits regardless."
