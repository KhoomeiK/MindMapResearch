Not many schools can balance a distinctly top tier education program with the most raucous, insane student life possible.

If I was a manager, would I want to hire a square, but undeniably, intelligent employee or someone who can balance frying his brains out on a Friday and then acing his Materials midterm come monday?

I understand the nuances and background that someone who was from a western country created and invented the test.

With the build and musculature you gave this dude I think he'd be closer to 900-1200 lbs perhaps. 

Additionally maybe this species started off as a tree dwelling species but as they became the dominant species they began to breed for size and strength over speed and agility.

sports,fo4lv9i,t1_fo44mud,1587506778.0,"Valid points and I appreciate the well thought out response.

I just have a hard time seeing how a rugby club could fund the lifestyle Dan Carter is accustomed to in one of the most expensive places to live in. That is on top of Chris Robshaw, who as England captain, would probably be accustomed to a certain lifestyle as well.

Of the top of my head you guys have Bastareaud and Foden who would be the marquee players I assume? 

Another thing I just thought about on my run is that is health insurance for players and their families. We all know ""good"" health insurance is sometimes tied to employers and I'm not sure what MLRs health insurance policy is.

Going from a country like NZ to the wild wild west healthcare that is the US must be a little scary as well."
sports,fo3s8hm,t1_fo3r8ei,1587492097.0,"Because USARugby filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was probably helping foot the bill or help secure funding from World Rugby.

I really do admire your optimism but based on the player funding and the number of players, players earn on average 35K and usually work another job. I've played with and against some guys on the Legion. 

I know Nonu is in SD but frankly I have no idea how players like him and Beast are being paid. I saw Chris Robshaw is coming to RUNY, but he and his opera singer wife in London are accustomed to a very particular lifestyle in London I'd imagine. I just have a really hard time imagining he can afford an apartment in Chelsea, Brooklyn or Manhattan on less than 100K.

Do you really think Dan Carter is going to move to NYC, one of the most expensive places to live in the world to play for a team in a bankrupt rugby union? Yeah I dont think so

Disclaimer:  I obviously want rugby to succeed but frankly, since about 2013, USARugby has been continuing to make dumb financial decisions without holding the idiots at top accountable"
