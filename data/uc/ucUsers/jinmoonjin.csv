UCSD,fozpqhm,t1_fozp08i,1588194715.0,I never suggested that school will give answers in August? I think you’re the one that misread it. Don’t generalize things...just because you found an apartment in August doesn’t mean it’ll be easy for everyone else to find housing. I’m not overreacting but just stating the issues I’m dealing with as well as other people. I’m not saying one day screwed my housing situation...I’m saying this leaves a lot of uncertainty for people who have to return to sd and find an apartment. If you don’t share the concerns just move on. There’s no need to criticize people who are concerned or make their concerns look trivial.
UCSD,fozk3se,t1_fozcsti,1588191991.0,Just because you signed your lease in August doesn’t mean everyone else is. Just accept the fact that the school giving such vague statements can impact some people negatively and add extra stress. I see other people are already in apartments or looking for apartments at the moment. I’m also looking for apartments right now as well. If you can’t relate just move on. You don’t have to question people’s choices
UCSD,fovqy6g,t1_fovqs53,1588105996.0,Bc Ucsd has to lure them in to take their money 🤣
UCSD,fovquda,t3_g9uxgc,1588105943.0,They basically said “no campus fees r refunded periodt”
UCSD,fofyg1v,t3_g74t2u,1587745008.0,I feel like comments down here aren’t very representative of what most people(at least the ones I know) would say. My answer is absolutely not. My friends and I talk abt it all the time how our lives would’ve been so much better if we didn’t choose ucsd. It lacks in every aspect and the school doesn’t give a fk abt you. Go to another school if you have options
UCSD,fo5zews,t3_g2na9l,1587540846.0,I’ve taken summer session before and I think that’s a lot. Most people take one or two classes during summer session. Since it’s online I think taking 1-2 and one easy class might be okay but that seems like a heavy workload. I think for me I would take out chem 43a because other classes will prob be easier online but idk abt ochem lab. My friend is taking it rn and she told me it’s really confusing and she gets tested on things the prof doesn’t even mention. But she did say the lab is just videos you watch. It’s up to you in the end and I’m sure you’re a good student but just my opinion.
UCSD,fo5z2ek,t3_g5m1sd,1587540496.0,"Realistically speaking I think they would and they should. Schools get so crowded and California is heavily undertested :(( Also the way the school has been dealing with cases(housing corona patients alongside healthy grad students with no notice, releasing info/updates abt infected students late and they still haven’t released some cases that I personally know of) I don’t feel safe going back Bc the school is not transparent."
UCSD,fntlv2s,t3_g3r34v,1587244263.0, No ucsd sucks even when I’m paying in state tuition. School is trash period. Pls don’t come here

UCSD,fmnnrjm,t1_fmnn6hr,1586230469.0,May I ask what department you’re associated with?
UCSD,fmnfuq0,t3_fw7kav,1586225108.0,Yeah I feel this...it’s ridiculous
UCSD,fm6vqhn,t3_fteck4,1585804646.0,I agree looks like some bs
