It seems to me that there are at least “meritocratic elements” to tech.

berkeley,fp4w5kv,t3_gbb4gg,1588308969.0,"I chose cal over cornell for CS two years ago, but since I'm in-state the money made it a very easy choice. I think cal and cornell are very comparable schools academically and career-wise. Most of the well-roundedness you're talking about can also be found at Cal if you want it - meanwhile, I'm sure cornell also has its fair share of engineering/finance people who want nothing to do with liberal arts.

Also, frankly, I really wouldn't worry about prestige. Cornell has a marginally lower acceptance rate, true, but I don't think anyone considers cornell to be a higher-tier school than Cal. Especially for CS. I also don't think the networking opportunities would be very different? But maybe I don't know enough about the elusive world of old-money ivy leaguers.

To me, your choice comes down to 3 main things:

1) cost - is 10-20k/year significant to you? for me, that'd be enough to choose cal if you're otherwise undecided. also, if you're not interested in graduate school, it's fairly easy to graduate in 3 years here if you want. edit: nvm, you said cost's not too significant.

2) you said you don't want to bank on being a top 20% grinder. now, tbh, it's probably easier to be a top 20% grinder than you think, because a lot of people here are lazy asf. but Cornell might be easier if you don't want to grind. idrk how competitive things are but given it's a private school, it's probably better than cal.

3) location. Cal is a more fun area w/ much better weather, cornell is closer to home."

I’m not an idiot and I’m sure there’s nepotism in tech. Even at an internship level I’ve seen it happen. My understanding is that there’s a lot less of it than in other industries, and that nepotism usually can’t bail out someone who’s *totally* incompetent. My reason for this belief is that because there’s a technical component to the interview, qualified candidates get a chance to stand out in a way that they wouldn’t in a traditional behavioral interview. I’m well aware my understanding could be totally wrong, hence my asking you.

I also check blind quite a bit lol. If it was that easy and common to get through on nepotism and prestige why would everyone on there be grinding tf out of leetcode? 

I think I’m rambling a bit but the big difference to my knowledge is it’s almost impossible to break into high finance if you didn’t go to the right school. That’s not the case for tech, and I think the interview process is a large part of the reason why."

Getting referrals through your own network of friends and coworkers is obviously very common but 1) I don’t think you get to skip the interview? and 2) that’s not the nefarious nepotism most people are opposed to anyways. 

What specifically are you referring to? As I said, I’m a college student with little industry experience so it’s entirely possible I just don’t know about it."
berkeley,fp3oxlr,t3_gb4jej,1588283165.0,"take the most rigorous courseload you can and get straight As. everything else is secondary.

if you have perfect academics and mediocre ECs, you have a pretty solid shot of getting into cal (although, you probably won't get into schools like harvard.) the reverse is not true. anecdotally from my competitive bay area school that sends 30-40 people here per year, I've never seen someone with top-tier academics get rejected from l&s.

csMajors,fp3o9m0,t1_fp3o5bb,1588282829.0,"completely agree with you there. 

at least from my perspective as a college student, LC questions do a reasonably good job at selecting for people that are smart and/or dedicated enough to grind tf out of leetcode. I think for an intern / new grad, there's not much else you can go off.

134 was pretty good overall actually (I really like probability), but I wish we had more practice problems - even the discussion sections just reused problems from the textbook half the time. Also, it seemed that the questions in the book were either really easy or really hard with no warm up, and the exams didn't have any outside-the-box problems. neither lucas nor the book were very good at explaining the material; adhikari's online book (and from what I've heard from friends, the 126 textbook) had much better explanations.

135 was awful. the textbook was one of the worst I've ever used - just dense mathematical formulas with nowhere near enough explanation. Lucas didn't really explain the math behind things, and even when he did, it rarely showed up on tests/hwk, so there was little motivation to learn it. the class just felt like a slightly upgraded AP stats."

I would bet money that whichever TA finds your form would just ignore it, and nothing will happen to you. At least, that's what I'd probably do if I were your TA.

The only people at any risk of getting caught, at all, are the people who word for word copied old solutions for substantial portions of the HW. *Maybe* they can catch you for copying other people's submissions, but that would logistically be very difficult.

As an aside, I always thought the ""YOU CANNOT LOOK AT OLD SOLUTIONS"" policy was really stupid. People get entire answers to problems from their friends or from readers/TAs in OH all the time. That's not cheating, but glancing at the solution key is? It seems to me that the only difference between the two is the former wastes a lot more time.

Doing these things online is obviously different from actually taking the class, because self-motivation is hard. But after actually taking 61a, I could do most of CTCI. Leetcode mediums will need data structures and some additional self-studying for concepts like dynamic programming.

I haven't taken 126 yet (plan to take it in the fall), 127 and 189 have both been easier than I expected. 127 is probably pretty comparable to 170 in terms of workload, and I think it's actually easier conceptually. 189 is not especially difficult conceptually either, and while the homeworks are long they're biweekly.

Ranade is a great professor for 127, but Ramchandran usually teaches 126 in the spring and he's fantastic too, so I'd say it's a wash with that regard as well.

I think both are fine schedules (and honestly if you felt confident with the lower divs you might find these a bit light actually), but option 1 is probably slightly more balanced workload-wise, since from what I've heard 126 is higher workload than 127, and 189 is definitely higher workload than 189."

Student quality is probably also pretty similar, we're both the ""back up"" schools for smart people who don't get into their very top choices. Cornell also seems to have a reputation for stress and depressed students.

First, just some minor factual corrections: you're wrong about the top 1/3 getting a B+, it's more like the top 1/2 to 3/5 for the 3 classes you need to declare. 170 is not at all hard to get into. 189 has huge waitlists, but I believe for the past two years enough people have dropped that anyone who wants to take the class has been able to take it.

127 and 126 have zero overlap in material, but optimization is apparently useful for a pretty wide range of disciplines (prof. ranade mentioned bioinformatics, control theory, and (dun dun dun) machine learning.) specifically for 189, I don't think either 126 or 127 are *necessary* for shewchuck's iteration, but 127 helps more than 126 I think."
