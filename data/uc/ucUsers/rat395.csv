UCSC,fpisl8z,t3_gdptga,1588647773.0,"You can switch to CS, I've had many friends that do so. But I hear that it is really hard to get the classes required to declare the CS major as a non-CS major. CS majors get priority.

Edit: I’m wrong. This comment is incorrect. See reply."

waterpolo,fo59539,t3_g5q8d7,1587520216.0,Pick up and shoot with lines at each position. I’d get tired but it’s fun to block the shots since they come from different angles. Also I’m the goalie.

Nicaragua,fnmsv53,t3_g2nkbw,1587077512.0,Pues yo pienso que reddit es para todas las personas. Pero pues los sapos se la pueden tragar entera. Esta bueno que ese mae ya no este en subreddit con sus mega mamadas.

UCSC,fn1rbfn,t1_fn1oyam,1586568296.0,"Yeah that’s a good point. The fact that the admin is trying to find alternatives is commendable (especially as you mentioned students who would prefer a discord graduation over nothing at all)

This definitely affects me since I’m graduating this year. But you’re right that my comment doesn’t really add to the conversation. I’m just a bit salty that my parents have been asking me what’s gonna happen and I haven’t been able to give them a straight answer."

golang,fm5x61p,t1_fm4wcbr,1585781775.0,"Yes of course. My professor made it clear that the assignment could be implemented in many languages, we just have to adhere to the api specification. I already had experience implementing backend with python, so I figured this would be a good way to get good with Go."
