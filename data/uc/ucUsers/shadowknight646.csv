shittyrainbow6,fo87dj8,t1_fo7c616,1587591226.0,"There was a quote from an interview, and they're proud of this one too by the way, that ""So, if professional players are not happy with our proposed features, than that means we are going in the right direction."" Except they forgot that the rest of their player base dont like the changes either. I saw a comment below as well that the way to lower jäger's pickrate is to lower the amount of stuff he's needed to counter. Buffing Ying with another Candella and two smokes is likely going to push his play rate even higher. Which, with how everything is going with the new development team, they're likely going to think that their nerfs on Jäger weren't effective and are going to do it again."
