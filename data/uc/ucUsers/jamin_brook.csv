TrumpCriticizesTrump,fo3xf3j,t1_fo1nkj5,1587494576.0,"Just for anyone who needs a working definition:

An assault rifle, generally speaking, is any rifle that was designed - for all intents and purposes - to kill other humans.  


Typical features are things that are not typically found on generic or hunting rifles:

 -- Large ammo capacity (i.e. clips with at least 10s if not 100s of bullets)

 -- Rapid fire capacity (if not fully automatic, very quick firing semi-automatic triggers) 

Furthermore there is a class of ammunition that is also design to be used on humans

 -- Armor piercing

 -- Fragmenting

 -- Exploding

All types of bullets that are simply not necessary, desirable, or useful during normal hunting."

China is not a democracy (see Hong Kong)

The USSR was run by a dictator

Neo-Nazis are alt-right or extreme right wing people

If you gave even this tiniest little piece of shit about this you'd actually learn what modern progressives stand for."
