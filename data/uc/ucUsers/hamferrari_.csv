UCI,fooyitn,t3_g8le80,1587949176.0,"Hi there!

Fellow Muslim here, so I understand how the act of fasting could be physically draining for you as an essential worker - on that note, I hope you can find a small amount of comfort in the fact that you missing out on religious activities is out of your hands when you have so much else going on. Having pure intention while fasting is what matters most and you may even be rewarded more for your fast due to the fact that you’re sticking to it, even during hardship.

Regarding the rest, I’m so sorry to hear that you’re having trouble making it through this tough time. I do want to suggest that you apply for a grant here in order to give yourself a bit of room for comfort when it comes to providing for yourself: https://www.launchgood.com/msawcovidrelief

Lastly, I want to echo what a few others have mentioned here - the UCI Counseling Center is still open and provides free counseling for students, and the meetings are really easy to set up! I meet with Dr. Christine Catipon, and she is wonderful. I am someone who appreciates having a therapist that is willing to work with me to set up plans for getting past my responsibilities and struggles, as well as help me prioritize what matters most (based on urgency and/or importance). Please PM me if you want to talk or need someone to reach out to. Sending you love & well wishes."
UCI,foowbjp,t3_g8gwop,1587947836.0,This is so beautiful! What a great way to add a bit of your own personality to your stole :)
SkincareAddiction,fnnxc8d,t3_g2usu9,1587104671.0,How do you like the Matcha Hemp Hydrating cleanser? I’ve heard things here and there but would love to hear more!
MBA,fneqgqv,t1_fnapnbm,1586894023.0,It definitely does. Thank you so much!
MBA,fneqdzw,t1_fnb1c8o,1586893985.0,Thank you for the feedback! I greatly appreciate it.
MBA,fneqbzt,t1_fnaj572,1586893957.0,Thank you! I'm currently in contact with the company at my second internship about potential job opportunities there starting in a month or two. I'm leaning towards retaking the GRE just to solidify things further and give myself a better chance at applying to various programs in future years if need be.
MBA,fnc2swm,t1_fnb0oam,1586827422.0,"Good to know. I was considering retaking it for general purposes, so this’ll help me decide on whether to do so. Thanks!"
MBA,fnalq4l,t1_fnagwrq,1586799677.0,Thank you both for the feedback. What sort of experiences would differentiate a good-for-consideration applicant from a not-good-for-consideration one in your opinions? Just good to know for future reference should I choose to apply for an MBA in future years when I still don’t have much experience under my belt.
PlasticSurgery,fmqcosm,t1_flot8qu,1586297141.0,"I’m really happy with my results. I watched a ton of vlogs/videos during my recovery (ironic to do AFTER and not BEFORE, I know) and besides the normal symptoms like bruising, swelling, and discomfort for the first week I didn’t deal with any problems. What I like best is that he doesn’t have a “signature” look, and this was part of the reason I went to him. I looked at his results gallery and showed him the results his patients had that I did AND didn’t like so he knew what I was hoping to achieve through the surgery. I also ended up requiring a septoplasty to fix minor breathing issues, which he fixed. I have really prominent features in general: big eyes, eyebrows, lips, chin, cheeks, the whole drill. I told him I wanted my nose to look similar to the noses I liked on his page, but I wanted it to fit my face and still look natural. It’s been exactly four months since my surgery and I’m super happy with everything! The best part is I know healing isn’t fully complete so my nose will only continue to get refined as time moves along.

The one thing I will note is that I did not ask for, and did not get, a perfect nose. I’m happy with this, but I personally cannot confirm that others who are looking for a perfectly symmetric nose will get that with Grigoryants because mine is not 100% symmetric, and I am okay with that because it is barely even noticeable. At four months, it is mostly something I can feel when I touch my nose with my fingers - more of a bone thing.

Let me know if you have any other questions! I loved Grigoryants and his work has made me so much more confident about my features. Other features on my face are way more evened out now, and people tell me that they like how natural it looks and that I could have been born with it, which always makes me happy. I’d recommend him!"
