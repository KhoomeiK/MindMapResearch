newborns,fpm873h,t1_fpm7plb,1588727548.0,Lmao. AA as in recovering alcoholics? So because they are recovering from an addiction they must abuse and not feed their baby??
newborns,fpm58uv,t3_ge9wlt,1588725828.0,"That‚Äôs terrible! 

How do you know they aren‚Äôt feeding them? Some babies are just colicky and cry an awful lot. I was completely convinced that my neighbors would think I was starving or harming my baby when he sobbed for hours a few times. 

As for damage, it will most definitely cause failure to thrive if the baby isn‚Äôt eating enough.

Edit: after going through your post history I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on here. You advocate for physical punishment and not feeding babies at night."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fpk7xvj,t1_fpk50em,1588689723.0,"Salt, fat and acid. I‚Äôm always genuinely shocked by how little people season at home. It‚Äôs like there are afraid of salt."

restaurateur,fpgv6c6,t3_gddp5l,1588610091.0,"I handle them the same way. I know my kitchen is spotless and my team follows all protocols. Also, 30 minutes after eating is very little time for it to be from your restaurant. Usually it takes a few hours up to days to get ill from food. I wouldn‚Äôt tell the guest that though."

sleeptrain,fosyk2h,t3_g9cb6t,1588040756.0,"At around 5 months that nap length is totally normal. We usually only get about 2.5 hours of day sleep and then 6:30pm-10:30pm, 11:00pm-7:00am so ours balances out. If you‚Äôre sleep isn‚Äôt being caught up at night, I would just follow cues and how fussy the baby is getting. Huckleberry wasn‚Äôt great for us, we use sleep cues now."
queerception,fok7lx3,t3_g7ww2x,1587836894.0,"I have a tilted cervix, we tried for 6 months at home unsuccessfully and then did IVF which worked. I‚Äôm not sure if it was my cervix or the quality of sperm that made it tough to conceive at home."

newborns,fo4akhl,t3_g5m358,1587501023.0,"I don‚Äôt want to be rude or fear mongering, but this is the hill you die on. Not only are a large portion of people are asymptomatic, but we keep learning more and more about how it affects babies as time goes on. Initially we didn‚Äôt even think they could get it. Now we know they can. In some states cases appear so low because we are only testing people that meet a very small criteria. Our numbers are much larger than we have tested positive for and loads of people are actually sick. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be the one to kill my mom or kill my child because I didn‚Äôt have the backbone to stand up for my family. Your job is to protect your children now."

rarepuppers,fny132n,t1_fnxtxjs,1587350870.0,"No, I‚Äôm not. I have had four shepherds and have worked with numerous and they tend to be reactive and require lots of work. They have high prey drives and need lots of exercise. I don‚Äôt think they are a good starter dog for anyone with no doggie experience. I love them, they are very sweet and cuddly but also can be crazy for no reason. Not to mention hip issues and sheer size. 

I deleted my comment after getting nasty PMs but did want to respond to you."

SnooLife,fnmpj8s,t1_fnmp7br,1587075715.0,"I think now is too early to really make any decisions like that. It‚Äôs all a chaotic few months and things keep changing. One week my bubby would only fall asleep on me, the next week he was mr independent, the week after that he refused to nap etc. any schedule you have now is out the window soon."

SnooLife,fnmofz6,t3_g2nx1z,1587075137.0,"Newborns sleep great! They sleep all the time. The little lumps are so great at sleeping. Older babies do not sleep as well. I would absolutely not transition out of the Snoo right now.

Edit: Our little guy used to fall asleep much easier when he was weeks old vs 4 months. Now it‚Äôs a struggle and I seriously think without the Snoo he wouldn‚Äôt sleep 8 solid hours a night."

weddingplanning,fnb0lts,t1_fnawvmm,1586807139.0,"I would be worried about it then. If your state hasn‚Äôt hit its peak yet, the worst is yet to come. Countries and states that already had their peak are just barely showing some good news."
