ucr,fpldj0g,t1_fpldewt,1588710777.0,Yes I do. It always has been 10/1. We lost a week of winter break also at the end of fall 2020 since we are starting a week late. It was news a few months back when I found out.
ucr,fpjc2gu,t1_fpjb55h,1588663140.0,First day of fall 2020 has always been October 1
ucr,fpjc1kp,t1_fpiz6su,1588663117.0,"2018 and 2019 orientations were in July and August. Since it’s virtual, there is no need for two day sessions. Also first day of the quarter has always been October 1 for fall 2020."
ucr,fpelhp4,t3_gczulq,1588549855.0,2-3 business days. They processed it on Friday. So it’ll be in your bank account by Wednesday.
ucr,fpebr6h,t1_fpebkjp,1588544359.0,Looks like the cutoff from 900 to 700 was at EFC $2000. I’ve been asking around to try to get rough cutoff estimates.
ucr,fpeabuf,t3_gcyyph,1588543528.0,"EFC in the area of 0-2000 got $900, ~10,000 got $600, ~30,000 got $250"
ucr,fp9krml,t3_gc13v0,1588428669.0,"Arrives in March/April for newly admits, May for continuing students who are taking summer, June for everyone else"
ucr,fp8iqyo,t1_fp8f2xm,1588393362.0,It does in order for you to qualify for any aid at all.
ucr,fp8ipow,t3_gby8hn,1588393336.0,"I took 8 units last summer and had to pay around $500 out of pocket, my EFC was not 0 however."
ucr,fp8bqdx,t3_gbyhk3,1588388364.0,"There has been too many posts recently. But I wish I could tell everyone that if you got money, no matter how much, be thankful cause some people who need it more than you may have gotten no money :("
ucr,fp87vl6,t1_fp87l2x,1588385734.0,Yeah the summer grant was for summer 2019.
ucr,fp86od8,t3_gbxloq,1588384893.0,It’s under your 2019-2020 financial aid award
ucr,fp4jqdj,t3_gb83du,1588300561.0,"Took summer 2019, you will get your financial aid award sometime during May ahead of all continuing students that get them in June. It’ll depend on your EFC for what you get. They for sure will offer you a separate pell grant if you qualify for that that is 1/2 of what you would get for a quarter. They also will offer you a Summer UCR grant if you qualify. My EFC was not 0, and I had to pay $500 out of pocket last summer for 2 - four unit classes"
ucr,fp3043p,t3_gb0fvr,1588270803.0,"For the courses you’re done, so I believe you will just need a 2.7 GPA for the remaining courses you haven’t taken yet."
ucr,foweihs,t3_g9xida,1588118219.0,I took 2 classes (8 units) last summer and I had to pay out of pocket about $500. My EFC was $2450 if that helps.
ucr,fow56yv,t3_g9wevo,1588113221.0,It seems like some people received the email and most people didn’t. I didn’t receive it.  But the school is required to distribute half of the funds in order to get any money at all.
ucr,fov8850,t1_fov84pd,1588096979.0,It’s in the registrars site. Just google UCR enrollment enrollment form and it should show up
ucr,fov2zsd,t3_g9r5nr,1588094548.0,Depends if you want to get ahead and how much financial aid you’ll get in the summer. You could get some GE’s out of the way or try taking a class that’s hard to register for during the school year
ucr,fov2sko,t3_g9qsa7,1588094457.0,You need to fill out an enrollment adjustment form on the registar’s site. You won’t get a W this quarter
ucr,fosmwkj,t1_fosmqza,1588033875.0,Ah so hopefully you can get into CS 12 in the fall. Math 9A is Easy to get into. Just calc 1
ucr,fosi50s,t3_g9bdoj,1588031166.0,"CS major switch requires English 1A, math 9A, CS 10, CS 12 to knocked out before the end of your first year. Then you’re able to switch."
ucr,fnzut1w,t3_g4p7nt,1587401130.0,Fin aid office apparently discussing with admin on how it’ll be distributed. They gotta distribute half of the 29 million by law so students have to get something.
ucr,fnua4ix,t1_fnu9qkd,1587257693.0,"You are able to take CS 10, once you are in math 6B or higher. The MAE places you either in Intermediate algebra, Math 6A(precal) or Math 9A(calc 1). If you get placed into math 6A you are able to declare CS by the end of spring quarter after taking English 1A, math 6A, and CS 10/math 6B in winter and 9A in spring. If you place into 9A, you can declare by end of fall. DM me if you have any questions I’m willing to help. I’m a second year CS with business major btw."
ucr,fnu95n1,t3_g3xhq6,1587257118.0,"CS, you need to take Math 9A, English 1A, CS 10(about to be renamed CS 10A in fall) and CS 12 (about to be renamed CS 10B) before the end of your first year. Take the MAE like someone else said. Study for it. It covers up to pre cal and algebra 2. I didn’t end up taking it seriously and was placed into intermediate algebra, so I was 3 quarters behind Math 9A. But switching to CS is doable if you take those classes mentioned to meet the criteria."
ucr,fnr55ig,t1_fnr1qca,1587179542.0,It’s a separate stimulus all US universities got. UCR got 29 million and at least half of that has to go to students as emergency grants.
ucr,fnprbg7,t3_g388fi,1587150565.0,"Go to account information under student account on r web, it should exactly tell you what it’s for."
ucr,fnj3i4z,t3_g1v2i8,1586991270.0,"I haven’t bought a textbook from the bookstore since fall quarter freshman year. Worst $200 I ever spent. Now I use PDFs , library genesis or MAX rent from amazon."
ucr,fnib899,t1_fniazhg,1586977064.0,Minimum if the school decides to give every single student an equal amount. It’ll be around $600. It can go up if the school decides to give more or down for some people if the school assumes that you are well off based off of your financial aid for the school year (which I don’t want). At the end it’ll depend on how the school is gonna handle the grants.
ucr,fngz9ci,t1_fnglnm1,1586950274.0,If you take the 29 million and divided by the number of students you get the $1242 amount that the website has listed. We know the UCR ain’t that nice and aren’t gonna give the whole 29 million to us. ~$600 would be the bare minimum
ucr,fngiaip,t1_fngemcy,1586933111.0,"In theory yes, but who knows how much each student is getting. I know half of the 29 million is required to be given out. If the school goes by evenly distributing to each student enrolled, it’ll be ~$600 a student. If it’s by need, some may get more than others."
ucr,fnbjo5l,t3_g0fc0s,1586816725.0,They aren’t dismissing people for the Spring 2020 quarter. Use this quarter as a “get out of jail free card” work out way back up to good standing!
ucr,fn562xi,t3_fzma25,1586656806.0,CSBA majors are required to take Math 10A and Math 31.
ucr,fn4bhd9,t3_fzge8u,1586637961.0,It says half of what the school is getting (14+ million) are required to go straight to students. That’s about $580 a student. I just hope we’ll see that in our student account one day.
ucr,fmziw8r,t1_fmyt1pl,1586521784.0,That’s totally fine. Just make sure you don’t fall behind. It goes by supperrr fast.
ucr,fmy2xmh,t3_fy3m6v,1586476988.0,Totally normal to take one class/4units per session. This is the minimum to get full financial aid.
ucr,fmqyyxx,t3_fwt8q7,1586310118.0,In May you get your 2020-2021 financial aid award in addition to summer. Pro of taking summer session is that you get your award before everyone else who get them in June.
ucr,fmpw7c4,t3_fwqpom,1586288459.0,"Session A is denoted AXX, XX being two numbers(for example A01 for Lecture and A21 for Discussion). 

Session B is denoted as BXX"
ucr,fmc9wqq,t3_fudqla,1585941643.0,"Cal grant A would cover your tuition itself completely. Fees would have to either come out of pocket. Or if you choose to accept loans. The best loan is the subsidized loan since the government would pay your interest while you’re in school. Then it’s unsub since you start collecting interest once the loan is disbursed. Last, the parent plus which I don’t suggest since your parents have to deal with this."
