box5,fpbgyt4,t3_gchjn6,1588469775.0,"It's so nice to see new people finding PotO!  I highly recommend \*ignoring\* Love Never Dies and not letting it color your view of the story.  It came out decades after the first musical and honestly a lot of fans don't really count it.  It's based on a really lousy book and the story just isn't that good, IMO.  But the cast is really awesome!

Recommendations: 1) Susan Kay's ""Phantom.""  It's a retelling of the phantom's life story, and it's really beautifully written.  (It was written in the 1990s so some parts of it feel a little outdated/questionable, but I don't think it takes too much away from the story.)

2) The musical is based on Gaston Leroux's book, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (translated from French).  It's pretty different from what you might expect after seeing the musical, but it's a good read, and it's the original version of the story!"

You can also get married and have kids and do some of these things too--usually there's less time for it but it's all about what works best for each person individually and what balance they want for themselves.  You don't have to get married to have a full and wonderful life.   Personally, I've basically always known I didn't want to have kids, and I'm really, really happy with that choice.  It's all a matter of what works best for you."

classicalmusic,fgvj34x,t3_f0gltu,1581149481.0,"Adding to these, his transcriptions of Schubert's lieder.  I recommend ""Du bist die Ruh"" and (maybe too famous) ""Gretchen am Spinnrade.""  His transcriptions in general are awesome.  I really love ""Isoldens Liebestod"" (Wagner)--it's one of those Liszt pieces that make you go ""a piano can sound like *that*?!"""
