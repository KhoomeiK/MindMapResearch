supremeclothing,fp69e03,t3_gbeitb,1588348428.0,"lmao inb4 drawing is considered on the same level of ""work"" as physical work. ""workwear"" is for PHYSICAL work. jesus christ this sub is embarassing

edit: i saw this when i just woke up and didnt notice he’s on a boat. my comment is based on thinking that this dude was drawing in his living room. my opinion still stands that workwear is being weirdly adopted by nerds who havent spent 1 day doing real, physical work, although it doesnt pertain to this guy obviously. downvote away if you want, but i literally just thought this dude was in his living room"

AskReddit,fp16b6h,t1_fp0orwd,1588225622.0,"im sorry but was your use of gender neutral pronouns intended? if so, why? like im not trying to be a snobby douche, but you literally said “my wife” so why not use the pronoun “she”? if you just accidently used “they”, just ignore my comment. im just interested if you purposely used “they”"

ucla,fosvono,t1_fophso8,1588039012.0,"Q1) If you can get the accounting minor on top of the BizEcon at UCLA (which already clears some reqs for the accounting minors I believe), definitely UCLA by far.

Q2) i might be biased, but bizecon is great because it deals with hard skills of accounting, and ensures your math skills are great as well. you'll be fit for most business jobs, especially if you do the accounting minor.

(im regular econ, butr i have friends in bizecon)"
ucla,fosvfz2,t1_fopla5d,1588038868.0,"definitely not easy with those two majors, I hope you enjoy studying if that's your plan. Econ, although short, has a few (ECON11, ECON41, ECON103) that will ravage ur soul if your math skills aren't good, but it is doable if you plans these listed classes around the harder classes of a Bio degree."
ucla,fosv9ne,t1_fosdhqq,1588038764.0,"I would totally take UCSB, given your statement. UCSB is sick, and the econ department is decent, and you got in for accounting as well. I'm a transfer, on my third quarter of the econ major at ucla rn in case that brings about any additional Qs."
ucla,fosuxm8,t1_fostncb,1588038566.0,"If you want a single/double deluxe, select ""No"" for LLC. To go through your list:

Holly: is only for the Transfer LLC (all triple deluxes). you will not be able to get a single/double deluxe in this building.

De Neve Plaza: This is probably where you would want to end up. It has doubles/triples with private bathrooms, and are the middle ground on the spectrum of quiet and social. 

Dykastra: I'm pretty sure dykstra is all standard triples, I might be wrong.

But yeah, De Neve Plaza is what I would reccomend for you, given your preferences"
ucla,form770,t1_foiv6bi,1588014587.0,everyone gets depressed at a certain point. the academic rigor of UCLA ensures that. so feel safe in regards to imposter syndrome.

ucla,forlagd,t1_fom57tx,1588014142.0,"I applied for Economics and got in. I'm not the biggest fan of the crazy academic rigor of my major, however the sheer amount of amazing people I've met at UCLA has definitely made it all worth it. I transferred in with a 3.81 from CC, with above-average CC involvement (a couple clubs, work-study on campus), I got an extra associates degree in Psychology, and I wrote about my life-changing chronic health condition in my personal essays. Honestly though, I didn't really expect to get in because I got B's in 2 math classes, so I'm pretty sure my essays carried me hard."
ucla,forje6b,t1_fophvwi,1588013230.0,"unless you're in a super sweaty STEM major, no one is actually hostile. also, as a transfer, I was hoping that class atmosphere would be better than CC (not many people talk in CC), but I was pretty disappointed when I got to UCLA. not many people talk with classmates tbh"
