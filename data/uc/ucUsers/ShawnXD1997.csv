UCSantaBarbara,fp6sg97,t3_gbnfaw,1588357808.0,"""I think what we are exploring is a mix where there will be some material that is delivered in a classroom or lab setting and other classes continue to be online.""

So I am guessing that large lectures will go online; sections/lab will be in-person?

But this is really dumb... image you have one online class and on in-person class back to back. Where are you gonna find places to watch your zoom videos? Can’t have everyone crammed into library. 

Honestly, I don’t feel much optimistic about this quote-unquote mix. Feel like there’s very little leeway. Mostly likely that we are still gonna have recorded lectures and only a handful of classes that can be conduct in-person, classes that you just cannot do online."

Jeez, this is insane. I am sorry that you have to go through this. People can be trash no matter race/nationality. Have you thought about moving? Maybe to a place in Canada that is more open and tolerant? Really thought things like this would happen in Canada..."

infp,fp1zthw,t3_gafcet,1588252057.0,"Same struggle... I feel like I am constantly switching between two mode, especially regarding which function is dominant and which is inferior... I've taken the test many times. Sometimes  I get INFP, sometimes INTP. I think it has to do with how the questions on the test are structured. They're just too... specific. Questions like ""do you often make lists or rely on your memory?"" Well, for me it depends what I am doing.

I think that at the end of the day, just remember that every category is flawed, but they are good gateways to understand yourself; they're NOT meant to be a blueprint for your life. What's most valuable for me about these tests is that they have explained lots of issues I have with myself in the past, but ultimately it is I who get to decide what do about them."

Why are there always Asians saying that there are too many Asians? Never imagine something like this would come off from any other ethnicities so casually. Your Asian self-hate is so evident."

However, in their defence, pretty much all major cities in Canada have different degrees of housing problems — Montreal doesn't have many Asians but the housing there is still very pricy."

However, Trump also said that he wants to protect American workers, so the employment-based immigration visas (EB-1, EB-2, EB-3...) and the non-immigration work visa (H-1B, OPT...) will probably be affected."

UCSantaBarbara,fnxlnet,t3_g4htum,1587341225.0,"The most likely thing is probably that we'll have a hybrid of online classes and in-person classes. Maybe let the labs go in-person but the lectures online, something like that. The point is that there might not be a sudden switch that until that point everything goes back to normal. It's more likely to be a gradual process."

This hits home really. 

However, I have to say that this might vary for different majors. I'd assume that all the CS/STAT/MATH classes would be way easier to switch to online than some other classes."
UCSantaBarbara,fmmcgkx,t1_fmmb2py,1586202788.0,"Thank you for pointing that out, but I've submitted this very online application over a month ago. The recent email coming from them still tells me to wait further instructions..."
