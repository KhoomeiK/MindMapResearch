PharmacyTechnician,fpi46uh,t3_gdgdun,1588633319.0,"In most American retails pharmacies, you'll be lucky to be doing anything that actually requires your license even 5% of the time. Days will be full of being a cashier, billing insurance, phone calls, and routine things that don't actually need a license. This is especially true if there are experienced technicians there that will prefer being in the back, and less true if there are pharmacy cashiers that can't help fill prescriptions."

AskReddit,fp9xsil,t1_fp9bagw,1588436769.0,"A big part of it is what they are able to conceive of saving for. Those without means often have homes in poor shape, and buying a nice home is way out of the realm of financial possibilities. So imagine that instead of paying for housing, he is paying for this truck. I've seen hundreds of such examples when I was living in the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas."

PrePharmacy,foxehxf,t3_g9jpeb,1588141552.0,"Spend even a few months a technician. If it's something you're going to hate having to do for the rest of your life, you'll know quickly, and before you've invested several years and a ton of money."
UCSC,foxc5e4,t1_foxam27,1588139610.0,"That's a beef I have with Terms of Service; yeah I can just ""not agree"" to them and not use the service, but usually I don't have any other options. I feel like most times I'm agreeing to ToS under duress."
UCSC,foxbruv,t3_ga1bfw,1588139305.0,"So, having taken a class with Dhar, I remember him being super against any recordings, webcasts, or photos of the blackboard. Has he let up a little? I wish you the best of luck, but I don't know if he be convinced to not use a proctoring service. Luckily for me at the time, the Physics Department decided against all finals last quarter."
latterdaysaints,forve9q,t1_fopuvku,1588019184.0,"Yes, but before they're GA's, they're bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and area presidents. Which may not be compatible with many blue collar jobs."
latterdaysaints,fopfyre,t3_g8saq3,1587960494.0,Part of it certainly has to do with who has enough wealth to retire and live without a regular income. Even the time commitment involved in being a bishop can difficult depending on your job requirements.
PharmacyTechnician,fopcy2u,t3_g8so67,1587958383.0,"Or just pass the PTCB. I believe with the new 2020 PTCB requirements you have to take a class or something, but I believe there are online ways to do that."

TalesFromThePharmacy,fok6ycm,t1_foj82ci,1587836539.0,"It can definitely mean the pharmacy is taking a hit, but it's the same story with some PBMs. Most chains won't care, because it all means more foot traffic. It can hurt local pharmacies, but some are willing to price match instead of using your coupon."
PharmacyTechnician,fok61vs,t3_g7vqfs,1587836059.0,"In an informal poll of ReTell Pharmacy podcast listeners, 92% of pharmacy workers use the 5 second rule. Whether we ~should~ or not is another story, but it happens; especially for C-II drugs."
PharmacyTechnician,focpqrg,t3_g6u71z,1587674254.0,"Wow. I made that much before I even had my license. Granted, I'm also in California. Have you checked a site like Glass door? It can give you an estimate for your area."
TalesFromThePharmacy,fo761h4,t1_fo6zxrb,1587572868.0,"At my location, unless it's one OTC that's right outside the pharmacy, I/have them call the front end to grab it and they can come back to the drive through in 15 minutes"

PharmacyTechnician,fn1atce,t3_fy7ru5,1586558219.0,"Tbh, most of what you'll be doing is serving as a pharmacy cashier: ringing people out, phone calls, and infernal insurancd. The senior, quick techs do most of the filling. Granted, the variety is location dependent. My job pays well, but is stressful and not much variety.
Based on the interviews I had, talk to the store manager instead of the PIC. At 2/3 places I applied, the store manager did the interview instead of the PIC, even after being certified."
