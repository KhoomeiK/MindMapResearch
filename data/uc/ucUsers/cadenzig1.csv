UCI,fog5u19,t1_fog2e7l,1587748277.0,that’s one thing i’m worried about. i have a signed lease with acc next year and if we’re online we better be getting a refund
UCI,foe6j9o,t1_foe6d8e,1587697025.0,I think it's for everyone.  I'm a first-year right now and it was on my portal
UCI,fodhklp,t1_fo8palh,1587684778.0,Glad your feeling a little bit better. Its always good to see things from multiple perspectives. Sometimes in bad there is good and in good there is bad and I think that this is one of those cases.
UCI,fo8nnu5,t3_g69d0l,1587600144.0,"First off, switching the style of learning is a very difficult hurdle for all of us. I saw someone mention that curves are by class not by math 2b as a whole so you shouldn't worry about that too much. In addition, I think that by doing the test that way is better preparing you for future math classes such as 2d. Don't get me wrong, it isn't fair that different professors are giving out tests differently, but if we are back in-person next year (which I really hope we are), people with open note tests may struggle more since they didn't have to remember anything. I took math 2b last quarter and there are definitely a lot of things that you have to memorize, especially when it comes to trig related things, and trust me, those do not go away."
UCI,fo8n3ag,t1_fo86eiz,1587599812.0,"came here to say the same thing, he is easily one of my favorite professors so far at UCI. His midterms were tough though for sure. I imagine his 2B class this quarter must be tough considering the fact that his lecture style was very interactive and flowed super well in person."

dataisbeautiful,fmcsx3j,t3_fud7n7,1585952193.0,Is it just me or does it seem like it goes from the coasts towards the middle?
