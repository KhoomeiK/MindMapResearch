We [incarcerate way more people](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/incarceration-rates-by-country/) than other countries.

[Tons](https://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/drug-war-statistics) of people have been affected by the war on drugs. If you can't come to terms with those verifiable facts then there's no point to trying to discuss this. It is not a one sided issue. In order to tackle gang violence, you have to deal with many aspects of the criminal justice system, including the fact that many people were led into lives of serious crime due to poor circumstances - which have in part to do with the historical oppression of minorities and the use of a phony drug war to make more arrests."

I think people support candidates further to the left than they themselves might be because we know that there's friction and partisan politics to water their ideas and policies down a bit before getting passed. The bay is such a progressive bubble that these ideas end up going all the way through to action in some cases, and that's why we see these policies of letting violent offenders and thieves go free happen.

If given the choice between two candidates in a general election and one wants to jail marijuana users, and the other is too soft on more serious crimes, it's not an easy choice for they're both sub-optimal. Which of the two extremes would you prefer? I feel like many many people are harmed due to the high amount of pointless incarcerations in this country, and at the same time a smaller group of people is hurt in a more severe way due to violent crime.

>people who haven't learned enough to pass, regardless of _why_ they haven't learned enough.

This assumes that people get an NP only because they haven't learned the material. You're forgetting that grades aren't always a true direct reflection of your knowledge; they're a reflection of your ability to turn in assignments and do well on exams. It's entirely possible that people are negatively affected by coronavirus in ways which cause them to miss lectures or other forms of attendance, not have time to finish an assignment or project, or in the worst case miss an exam.

For example if i wasn't fortunate enough to be able to stay in berkeley while this is happening, i would have had to go home where i only have shitty rural satellite internet. Attending a single online zoom lecture would use up the month's data cap, and that's ignoring the fact that the bandwidth would be too poor to video call in the first place. I also had projects which required working with large datasets which can not be easily downloaded on low bandwidth, low data cap internet. The instability of this internet would also mean that i am at risk of accidentally losing connection during an exam, in which case bcourses can submit your attempt and lock you out. This is also why i was against the allowance of taking attendance in zoom lectures, and professors that refused to publicize the lecture recordings. It is absolutely unfair to a demographic of students.

People could have learned the matetial adequately, yet just not have had the resources to get a passing grade. I think that giving an incomplete to anybody not passing with the ability to take a makeup exam and/or have extended project/assignment due dates which correspond with their personal circumstances is a much better option than making them NP and having to take the whole class again."

Attention starved nerds can be very condescending, annoying and even creepy. I can say this because I cringe thinking about the m'lady edgelord I was back in around middle school. Thankfully, I grew up enough to start learning to treat others with respect. Really sorry to hear your experiences have been so uncomfortable and rude.

For one, labs and other forms of in person instruction are irreplaceable. Online courses are really not the quality education you would expect to gain from spending thousands of dollars. For another, you'd be having a semester less time to meet people and make memories. Sure, it's likely that large gatherings still won't be happening then, but that doesn't mean you can't make friends and hang out or collaborate. College is about way more than just earning a degree."

I dont know about you but 60 hours is a lot for whats considered a minimum full time commitment. Its also a very naive and privileged perspective to have because it does not consider those who have to work or take care of a family while going to school.

The real problem is Sahai's courses pretend a unit is worth far more time and work than most professors and courses think. EE16B made me work more for 4 units than i ever did in a 5 unit language class."

berkeley,fni9c3q,t3_g1lpy4,1586976173.0,"You honestly just really sound like you're salty that EECS prestige didn't carry your daughter into an illustrious academic or professional career. Getting into EECS is only a small part of the work. Graduating with a high GPA and wanting to do research is much harder, at any top university. I dont know why for 4 years you believed athe words of a single person at an admissions event say that a 3.0 is good enough for research and grad school. Literally anybody else working in higher education and research will tell you that's not true. Only a small fraction of ungergrads go on to get their masters or phd, so of course only the top students with high GPAs will be in that group. Im sorry it didn't work out for your daughter, but the university's job is not to hand her a diploma and an A. It's to give her the tools to succeed if she puts in enough hard and smart work. What is smart work? You can brute force attack a problem for hours and make no progess, only frustration. Alternatively, you can work smartly and methodically to focus on solving the problem in a way that ingrains the concepts you're supposed to be learning. Many in college think that by spending time on their coursework, they've done everything they can. Less students actually evaluate their study methods and learning habits to correct them in a healthy way.

 It also sounds like your daughter suffered from mental health issues. You should try to work through those, and assess how they came to be and how they likely impacted her ability to succeed in college, like adults, rather than blame the university for everything."
