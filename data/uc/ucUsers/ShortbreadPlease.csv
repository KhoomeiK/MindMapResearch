berkeley,foxdxn3,t3_ga32ty,1588141080.0,"I'm currently taking 3 techs + 2 professional clubs with high-ish commitment along with other smaller academic commitments, and I'll say that my weekly workload varies significantly. On more chill weeks (no midterms coming up, no projects due), I spend an average of around 5 hours for each tech and maybe slightly more for each club. Note that I DID spend an insane amount of time previewing course material for those three techs over winter vacation, so I was familiar with a lot of the material already. On the busier weeks (exams + project deadlines + other big club events) I'll definitely be living the 80 hour work week, with around 50 hours total on my classes and 30 on club projects. Luckily, that doesn't happen TOO often (usually only around midterms and finals) so while I'd be burnt out by the end of the week, I usually have time to regain my energy afterwards. 

Honestly, it depends on the techs that you take and the degree of familiarity you are with it. Taking 170+189+162 and two clubs, for example, is very different from taking data 100 + 188 +  161 and two clubs (not saying these classes are easy, but they've historically demanded less work from students). 

I also like to preview the material by reading through course notes and doing psets before the semester begins--I personally find that I'm able to finish my classwork a lot faster during the semester that way. I know everyone studies differently, though, but you should be able to cut down the amount of time studying by finding the study habits that work best for yourself."

berkeley,fnytdlx,t1_fnylx8a,1587374933.0,"Well, ee16a provides a lot of linear algebra experience, which the more mathy upper division classes will need--so if you want to take classes like eecs127 (optimization) or cs189 (machine learning) which rely heavily on linear algebra early in your college career, taking 16a a semester late might delay that.

That being said, most people don't take those two classes until junior year (or spring sophomore year for the more mathematically oriented people), so taking 16a one semester late won't make that much of a big difference unless you really want to take them fall of sophomore year."
berkeley,fnyg1v0,t1_fny3rsw,1587362013.0,"It says encouraged to be taken concurrently--so it's not a prereq! You'll need basic coding knowledge (for loops, logic...etc) for EE16A and know how to google the numpy documentation, but that's about all the programming knowledge you need"
berkeley,fnxykfv,t1_fnw4lt4,1587349183.0,"It depends on your major and what major or college specific requirements you already have under your belt, but usually, yeah! It'll be a little bit more of a grind but it's something that a lot of people do."
berkeley,fnxyb3g,t1_fnuwtmp,1587349011.0,"Personally, I would advice against pushing back cs61a, for two main reasons: 

1. DeNero teaches in the fall, and he's THE teacher to take for cs61a (good lecturer, great course structure, and taking cs61a with DeNero is almost part of the Berkeley experience lol)

2. By pushing back cs61a, you're pushing back all your CS upper division courses back by 1 semester, since literally every CS class requires cs61a knowledge. If you have certain upper divs you want to squeeze in before graduation, this could prevent you from taking certain classes (or having to take more technical classes in future semesters instead of breadths, which will be significantly more tiring than your semester 1 schedule since upper division classes tend to all be harder than cs61a+ee16a+data8)

That being said, if you're worried about the workload, I would consider delaying ee16a. Unless you're planning to go into EE, delaying EE16A by one semester will have a much less impact on the range of classes you can choose in future semesters compared to cs61a, since having cs61a+cs61b+(perhaps cs61c) under your belt is more important than having ee16a+ee16b under your belt for more upper div CS classes."

berkeley,fmwdxjk,t3_fvy8jr,1586444823.0,"For non-academic clubs, join whatever interests you! I'd say we have just about any sport you can think of (even Quidditch!), and quite a few hobby clubs (Board Games at Berkeley, for example). Those usually have no application process but might involve some fees.

For academic clubs--it depends. A lot of academic societies (like CSUA, IEEE for example) have no application process (and no fees, I think) but they're mainly social clubs that organize events related to an academic field. 

Tech clubs do have an application process (usually around two 200-word short answer responses + behavioral interview + technical interview) as well as a fee to join. I don't have a very comprehensive list, but here are a few tech clubs in no particular order:

* Codebase (does tech projects for companies)
* Launchpad (machine learning club)
* ML@B (machine learning club)
* Codeology (does projects within the club)
* MDB (mobile development, altho I heard they're trying to reorient their club)
* Blockchain at Berkeley (blockchain)

Another popular group of clubs are consulting clubs--they usually also involve an application process (essays + behavioral interview + technical interview) and a fee. Once again, not a very comprehensive list, but here are a few consulting clubs in no particular order:

* Berkeley Consulting (the OG consulting club)
* The Berkeley Group (the other OG consulting club)
* Diversatech (tech consulting)
* Venture Consulting (startups)
* Valley Consulting (they do most industries, I believe)

Also, note that the first few weeks of school you'll get flyered by more clubs than you can possibly join. Most of the academic clubs and a lot of non academic clubs will have a booth in Sproul Hall and you'll be able to talk to people there for more info!  Also, about 2 weeks into the semester there's Calapalooza, which is basically a club fair. Most clubs that require applications also hold info sessions (check their facebook/webpages or talk to people flyering to learn more about where/when they're held), where you'll be able to learn more about the club, talk to members, and eat some free food!"

berkeley,fmsmsuq,t3_fx1ohc,1586358486.0,"I took a Berkeley Connect class my first semester at Cal! It’s basically a small discussion class of about 20 people that meets once a week for ~1.5 hours, and instead of lectures it’s a big discussion of different topics (related to the field of your BC class). My class was also taught by a graduate student instead of a professor (not quite sure if all BC classes are like that though) so it was a lot more casual and felt more like a discussion than a formal class. Oh, and since our class was in the evening, dinner was provided every class! 

As for mentorship, we met with our graduate student instructor (GSI) twice over the semester for like 15 minutes each, and just talked about my goals in Berkeley. I wouldn’t say I found those immensely helpful (but that might be because my major didn’t match the Berkeley Connect class I took) but it was nice to hear about Berkeley from the perspective of a graduate student!"

berkeley,flwqbrr,t1_flw2k14,1585560863.0,"You've probably heard this a thousand times, but it definitely depends a lot on your study habits and you past coding experience. 

If you've had programming experience before or are a strong math student, none of the classes (lower-division classes, at least--I can't speak for the upper-division ones) should be too hard for you to handle. If you haven't had programming experience before, you might find yourself spending a little more time just getting used to the way programs are written and the logic behind them. 

The best way to acquaint yourself with the difficulty level would be to take a look at the course material itself! You can easily find the homeworks and notes from most EECS classes on their websites. These are the classes you'll most likely take in your freshman/sophomore year:

* CS61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs): [https://cs61a.org/](https://cs61a.org/) 
* CS61B (Data Structures): [https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/\~cs61b/sp20/index.html](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/index.html) 
* CS61C (Machine Structures): [https://cs61c.org/](https://cs61c.org/) 
* EECS70 (Discrete Math and Probability Theory) [http://www.eecs70.org/](http://www.eecs70.org/) 
* EECS16A (Designing Information Devices and Systems I): [https://www.eecs16a.org/](https://www.eecs16a.org/) 
* EECS16B (Designing Information Devices and Systems II): [http://www.eecs16b.org/](http://www.eecs16b.org/) 

As for Berkeley's competitive nature--I came in expecting Berkeley to be cutthroat, for people to deliberately try and lower others' grades to boost their own GPA (since everything is graded ""on a curve"", AKA you're competing against your classmates). That was definitely not the case. Not only are there more than enough resources out there to help you understand the material (office hours, small-group discussions, CSM...among others), it's also pretty easy to find a group of people to study with, and many upperclassmen are also more than willing to help explain concepts in classes they've taken. So yes, the classes can be tough, but you feel supported throughout the semester. 

It's worth noting that EECS students are pretty smart in general--many people were the top of their classes in high school and everyone studies hard and tries their best in all their classes. In that sense, Berkeley can be competitive--if you slack off, you won't do well. On the other hand, it also means that you have a big pool of people to study with!

I will say that there are some REALLY smart kids out there, who never go to lecture, barely read the course notes, study the morning of the exam, and get a higher score than 99% of the class. It can be kind of intimidating at first (and the imposter syndrome can set in), but you'll realize that they're usually also really nice and are willing to help out in any way they can."
