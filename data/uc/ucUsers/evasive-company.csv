UCSantaBarbara,fp6oxur,t3_ga00sy,1588356072.0,"I transferred here this fall and cried at the end of the quarter bc I felt like I made no friends. I live with one other girl who I've known for years and turns out she's a recluse, so I was forced to be alone a lot and it was horrible. Don't live alone, I feel like that's what I've been doing and it sucks. Although, winter quarter I joined various groups on and off-campus and now have friends every block I turn. UCSB does a great job of integrating transfers into the academic part of school but hasn't really made an effort to help with social life. Everyone at UCSB wants to be friends, people are so inviting and nice. Just put yourself out there into the mix of it and people will be receptive and make your time great. Also use, ""I'm new here"" ""I'm a transfer, so I don't know anything"" as much as possible people LOVE to show you new things, etc."
UCSantaBarbara,fp6n67o,t3_gb7dbn,1588355211.0,"I don't think sbcc's comm 1 is accepted as ucsb comm 1 credit, but I recommend taking it at ucsb if you want to be a comm major bc it familiarizes you with the department, staff and what they want from you as a student. I def reccomend taking 87 at a cc because it's just a stats class. (I'm a transfer comm student so this shiz is my bread and butter) lmk if you have an other questions"
