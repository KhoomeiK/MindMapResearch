Clemson,fmslv2p,t3_fwy3c9,1586357979.0,"Reddit, and college for that matter, is predominantly left leaning. That being said, it has been a hot minute since I have seen any political posts. Unless of course you are discussing the virus as other comments have suggested.


Ive had my political opinion (emphasis on opinion here mate) downvoted when I suggested the football team should have refused to meet with the president because of the damage he has done. There common issue here is opinion. Everyone has one. Sincerely, graduating clemson liberal.

Nice to have such powerful insight from such a disinterested centrist though. We need less blind hatred and prejudice against other political position. Im happy to see you are making that change, u/liberalsucksc"
Clemson,fmbtgg4,t3_fubg81,1585932897.0,"My unprofessional opinion: this is normal to feel. We all seem to have waves of motivation, some more tumultuous than others, and the pandemic serves to exacerbate that. I have personally had the privilege of having my coursework ending already essentially, but I have felt similar severe lack of motivation in the past.

It does not hurt to contact the counseling services here at Clemson as well, it does not make you weaker than anyone else. I will finish this out with asking if you have felt a loss of joy for activities you once loved, have you struggled to find motivation for your pastimes? If so, I encourage seeking counseling even more, just to gain professional insight."
