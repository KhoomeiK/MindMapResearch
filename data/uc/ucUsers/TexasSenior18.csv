Are you guys going to pretend that it never happened and sweep it under the rug?"

ucla,fngonl4,t3_g1nxmk,1586939283.0,"it's hilarious how upset the rest of usac got just because they couldn't bully orion into conforming. They're mad that he didn't fall for their total fucking circle jerk and just bow down to their will. Look, I agree that marginalized communities should get resources. But to frame an issue in such a way that anyone who disagrees with fee increases for valid reasons (such as financial burden) is doing so because of racist tendencies is such a disgusting fucking move on their part. They kept trying to discredit him by insinuating that he didn't have a community to represent. That's total bullshit. He represents students who are struggling now more than ever, students who cannot afford $45 in additional fees. Students of all colors and backgrounds. 

That's about as fucking general as you can get as a ""general representative."" Sounds like he's doing his job. Whereas the other clowns love to spew that they represent only x and y community and forget the rest. And in reality, it's not even ALL of x or y community, it's like 35 politically active people specifically pushing for certain things.

If you ask the average transfer, for example, I am willing to bet that they wouldn't give a flying fuck about the transfer center rent. And that's not to discredit the transfer center bc I hear it's great, but the truth is that there's like 10,000 transfers at this school, and I strongly believe many would be far more outraged by another increase in fees than the transfer center's rent debt."

Hey USAC morons! the community he represents are the thousands of students who don't want to shell out another $50 - these are people of all colors and backgrounds. People who can't afford more fees. He represents me!

Clowns like robert think that just because Orion doesn't name off a specific ethnicity that his policy concerns are somehow invalid. Literally, Orion's position is one held by students of all backgrounds. Please stop making it about race you race-baiting twats."

ApplyingToCollege,flkzfka,t3_fpc1x9,1585250666.0,"Internationally, UCLA blows USC's reputation out of the water. It's not even close. As research universities they are only rivals because of proximity, not because USC is on UCLA's level in terms of research. UCLA is in a far better neighborhood, it has a more storied history despite being much younger than USC. It has a way better vibe than USC. USC has a reputation for scandals, bribery, rich kids paying their way in, snotty students, etc."
