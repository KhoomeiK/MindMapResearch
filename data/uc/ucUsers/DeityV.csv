ModernWarzone,fpigt5l,t1_fphhwkt,1588640606.0,Probably more kills than your average game
tressless,fpig62r,t1_fpi8co5,1588640231.0,And the comments r spot on too. Straight up lying to the op
MMORPG,fpe1vin,t1_fpcpvz1,1588538702.0,I mean there pretty much is no choice between not having a cash shop or having a cash shop anymore. So most people have just settled on the fact that they would rather have a cosmetic only cash shop rather than a p2w one
MMORPG,fpe1n1d,t1_fpdkge1,1588538567.0,"Yeah it’s pretty dumb how the only way to earn a cool looking mount in eso is to buy the “eh” ones on the cash shop or get a cool looking one from a loot box. This is on top of buying the game, paying a basically mandatory monthly sub, and buying their yearly expansion. And yet with all this money their servers r still so shit that 12+ people make it unplayable."
ModernWarzone,fpa6rfr,t1_fp98676,1588441948.0,Ayyy nice man ur gonna love how smooth it's gonna be
RoastMe,fp8o8dn,t3_gbmfms,1588397764.0,Oh no no no
ultimateskyrim,fp8o22e,t3_gbsxaa,1588397617.0,Try playing eso
ModernWarzone,fp8o0ca,t3_gbr1pg,1588397576.0,That fps hurts my eyes oh god
tressless,fp8mq99,t1_fp8mjq2,1588396510.0,3.75 in high school and 4.0 in first year college
doordash,fp7b29p,t3_gbl6wx,1588367284.0,"Even as a former dasher I see no reason to tip my occasional orders. Highest tip I got while dashing was $5 for a $100 order. Not only are the menu prices higher without telling u, but the fees are dumb af. The total ends up being like $20 for something that's $10 in the restaurant.

My orders still get picked up instantly with or without tip so honestly I can see why customers don't give a shit"
ft86,fp71vy3,t1_fp6heqp,1588362540.0,Jesus that's really good
MMORPG,fp5joml,t1_fp4r5hh,1588331796.0,It's because the majority of the swtor player base are white males between 35-60. Literally remember joining a guild 1 year ago and it was all old people. Nothing wrong with that but it's probably a driving factor on the state of general chat.
tressless,fp55bry,t1_fp53a01,1588316804.0,"Well I've been taking fin for a year and i had a 3.75 gpa and no girlfriend. Now i have a 4.0 gpa and a girlfriend. Therefore fin not only regrows my hair, but makes me smarter and got me a gf right? Correlation =/= causation but if u got symptoms that severe, then that sucks. You clearly noticed your weaker erections but that doesnt mean everyone experiences it"
tressless,fp48f20,t1_fp452fi,1588293767.0,It’s safe stop lying to yourself
malegrooming,fp3d49c,t3_gatrrq,1588277224.0,Either works but girls would probably like left more lmao
berkeley,fp1sq4q,t3_g8an1k,1588246672.0,I go to Csun and am a guy but the guys here are super cliquey as well for no reason. Honestly makes me think like why would I even wanna be friends with these people? Something about comp sci just attracts such odd and unique people.
malegrooming,fp0xb4w,t3_gam5ak,1588219031.0,Bottom right or  top left
elderscrollsonline,fozzzvj,t3_gaik52,1588199925.0,even bdo had better servers than this feelsbadman
elderscrollsonline,fozttk1,t3_gai8ua,1588196746.0,just practice doing it fast in pve with ur pvp skills equipped so u get the muscle memory down. in a couple days u dont even think when doing it and thats when the real fun starts
relationship_advice,fotycfl,t3_g9cle0,1588070485.0,"She’s victimizing herself when she cheated on you man. I’ve known many girls who do this. They know cheating is bad but they create scenarios in their head to justify it. Don’t let this ruin your ego. She might even message you in a couple months wanting to “start fresh” and it’s going to be your responsibility to decline cuz it’s just not worth it. 

Edit: reading more into the post and the comments in general, u have to realize you’re in the wrong too. None of us know the whole situation but you’ve either been manipulated to the point of being crazy or have always been crazy. Regardless, u need to cease contact with her"
pics,foq9wx4,t3_g8sj09,1587987949.0,Wow I’d love to frame something like this
csMajors,foq9s9x,t3_g8rck0,1587987837.0,My professor posts zoom recordings of his lecture and it’s actually more helpful than in class lectures because I can pause and digest the material at my own pace. My algorithms and data structures class is simple now.
MMORPG,foo7qu4,t1_fon24uq,1587934141.0,"Weekly resets is how devs turn their 10 hr  expansion into ""content for months"""
MMORPG,foo7jcf,t1_fonzzjp,1587934028.0,Not disagreeing with u but bdo's endgame pvp is also pure cancer with the release of every new class completely throwing balance out the window along with other little stuff
MMORPG,fomf01k,t3_g85337,1587887623.0,"Age of Wushu- First mmo was age of wushu that I played for 2 years. Pay2win as fuck game but people let me play like $50k accounts cuz I had good ping. The game was basically ping2win at a certain point in which if u have the best ping, u could stun lock someone forever. I'd give it a 0/10 if u decide to play it now.

Black Desert Online- First ""real"" mmo was bdo. Put an unbelievable amount of hours in that. Around 10k hours but contrary to popular belief, it wasn't majority afk fishing. Sold and bought accounts a few times at endgame. Last one i sold was for 7k and not planning on going back. Unlike most people, I still think it's a good game and the combat is unbelievably fun. No other mmo can compete in that regard. Just not my type of game anymore due to the p2w creep and pvp balance. I'd give it a 7/10.

Elder Scrolls Online- Currently playing eso just as a casual. Treating it more like Co op rpg with my friends. Definitely can't take it seriously as a long term game cuz the engine just feels outdated tho. I'd give it a 7/10 as well. 

Waiting for new world and hoping it doesn't flop. Other than that, I'll just continue playing eso and any singleplayer games that come out like cyberpunk 2077 until good mmo releases."
MMORPG,fom3c69,t3_g802qt,1587877170.0,Is it hard to ask for an mmo with bdo type of action combat and generic mmo stuff like dungeons and pvp?
modernwarfare,focqwrr,t1_focbn2e,1587674668.0,Playing for objective in cod LUL
blackdesertonline,fo4yhbz,t1_fo4mu7c,1587513719.0,"if a guardian is **regularly** losing 1v1's to any single non grab class in the game, im sorry but they're just bad at the class. Try not to be predictable against other grab classes i guess? At least you're not a wizard/witch.  seems like a git gud situation to me"
blackdesertonline,fo48yel,t1_fo35mjh,1587500239.0,"I too can make a montage video of me getting lucky and killing unaware groups of people or just doing insane plays that make my class look like it is the most broken thing in the game. The reality is that guardian can do stuff like this pretty regularly because it is actually broken... It's un cc-able by almost half the classes in the game (because of a lack of grab and spammable protection) unless you're a shitty guardian. 

Acting like other classes with the same gear of a guardian will perform the same or better is just ignorant and moronic."
elderscrollsonline,fo4767b,t1_fo2qklc,1587499357.0,Missing a /s? Lol
blackdesertonline,fo4708q,t1_fo2xcep,1587499275.0,"Pickup a musa and try 1v1ing a decent ninja, tamer, or warrior...Lmao grass ain't greener on the other side. 1v1's in this game will never be balanced until every class has a grab so there's no point even bringing it up. Either way I was not talking about 1v1's and strictly group pvp like rbf and node war where guardian just crushes people."
blackdesertonline,fo2pmxc,t1_fo2onnn,1587470720.0,"I don't really understand the point of ur comment here. No I don't go one shotting groups of people in rbf with that kind of massive aoe, protection, and speed as a 305 musa. I'd literally get grabbed in my btb if I dashed into a group of people like that regardless if I have bsr or not. You can do insane damage on every single class in this game but u can't do what that guardian did with any other class."
unpopularopinion,fo2opzg,t1_fo23xhu,1587469935.0,Idk about that one since jedi fallen order was pretty loved
elderscrollsonline,fo2n4y6,t1_fo2ldvf,1587468483.0,Next Gen consoles barely gonna get 60 fps on this if we can't even maintain 60 fps in 10+  people fights with a 2k pc lool. Game is just outdated at this point and needs major optimization changes especially with all these new players like me that came
blackdesertonline,fo12qct,t1_fo0zrdq,1587424568.0,Honestly that's broken regardless if the guardian is 650 gs or 700 gs
blackdesertonline,fo12jab,t1_fo0fo82,1587424457.0,What if u don't have a grab
playblackdesert,fnwwhws,t1_fnqhkum,1587326819.0,Literally any mmo requires u play atleast 5 hours a day in early game and end game to advance. I really don't understand ur mentality in telling someone who has 300 ap that they're probably gonna burn themselves out Lmao
CODWarzone,fntby9d,t1_fns66i0,1587238602.0,"Literally says ""While some games are developed with uncapped frame rates, expect many games to see no changes"" in the article dumbass. There's a reason all your comments are being down voted and it's not a lack of knowledge on our part."
CODWarzone,fns36lh,t1_fnry4xi,1587211178.0,That's not how it works.... The hardware dictates what fps you get. The screen hertz is completely different. I feel like communicating with a 12 year old here lol. Just because cod warzone runs uncapped doesn't mean the Xbox one X runs it at 120 fps. It still runs it at at 60 and below fps because the hardware of it is outdated. It literally dips down to 53 fps in this video and you think your Xbox is getting 120 fps? LOL https://youtu.be/qGZ1MIm7u90

CODWarzone,fnrjcuu,t1_fnr5c00,1587190775.0,I have a 280 hz monitor but it doesn't mean I'm playing games with 280 fps... I suggest you google what fps and hertz are before commenting about it Lmao. Ur Xbox is struggling to maintain 60 fps on most high end games
modernwarfare,fnqgttj,t1_fnq548i,1587164325.0,"We were all noobs once and improved because of no sbmm. How about they stop being carebears

Edit: getting down voted cuz it's true and the noobs are butt hurt Lmao"
modernwarfare,fnqgolh,t1_fnop8u6,1587164243.0,Yes we want pubstomps back because it's rewarding to outplay the average cod player. Sucks for the shit players but we were all shit once and improved. All the shit players queueing with shit players won't make them improve...
MMORPG,fnf4tik,t1_fnenwem,1586901416.0,ESO clone with a better engine and servers along with updated combat animations would be amazing
MMORPG,fnf499n,t3_g17giq,1586901121.0,"Hybrid or action combat is the new thing. Alot of people don't wanna play a WoW simulator and have to manage 32 skills and their cooldowns in a tab target game anymore. Literally just play WoW if u like that. People still play absolutely shit games like bdo only because the combat is the best.

We also don't wanna spend countless hours grinding and have gear become completely obsolete after every dlc or expansion. Bdo and eso do this pretty well but I cant speak for the rest since I've only seen gameplay vids."

blackdesertonline,fmz8hcr,t1_fmwl83h,1586510558.0,Honestly do the streamers involved even bring the game any positive popularity lol? There’s only like 3-4 big mmos on the market and pretty much everyone knows ab bdo. It’ll be better for a new player to hop on some other dudes stream instead of hopping on to joes stream and seeing anyone who uses the word exploit get banned in chat
elderscrollsonline,fmyv6ld,t3_fy3uda,1586496752.0,Too bad it’s unoptimized as fuck. I get double the fps with early access games..
csun,fmxqm31,t1_fmwu1iu,1586469973.0,Comp 110 is pretty easy though as a first time coder but I guess it depends on the professor. The jump from 110 to 182 on the other hand is pretty retarded.

csMajors,fmho7yy,t3_fv1tx4,1586088115.0,"Man I’m ngl but you sound like my friend in my class and u might even be him. Best tip I would give him is to just put in the time and not get turned off by not knowing how to do something. There’s nothing wrong with getting help from people on projects so ur grades don’t go down but the best thing u can do for yourself is go back to these old projects and just look at them and try to learn something new everyday. 

My friend probably also thinks I finished a certain project in a few hours but I literally sat and worked on it for like 6 hrs straight for 2 days."
