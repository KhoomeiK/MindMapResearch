However, mental health is far from her specialty so while I will be talking with her soon about it, I’m not sure how much she can tell me. I do see a therapist, but I’m not sure if she’s qualified to prescribe me anything. I’ll ask her too tho. 

It def seems like doctors are pretty dismissive of the side effects during the 2-9 week adjustment period, which is what I’m most concerned about pushing me over the edge. Was that when you were having sleeping problems?"
Coronavirus,fp6wk8p,t1_fp6w81n,1588359834.0,Aren’t they just supposed to report the facts without assuming the connections?
Coronavirus,fofpm4m,t1_foelyla,1587740547.0,"I am literally a biologist and I can confirm that cleaning chemicals don’t play nice with our body chemistry. If you don’t believe me, go inject some bleach and you’ll find out. Even injecting air or water into your veins has drastic consequences, which is why doctors put you on a saline drip and take care to flick bubbles out of the syringe. Now please think about all the people who blindly follow Trump and hang on his every word. I don’t want anybody to die because they’re stupid enough to do what he suggests. Nobody is saying that light is the problem here, and you really could’ve picked a more relevant comment to drop all that on lol."
Coronavirus,foef05v,t1_foea1ys,1587702159.0,"A nice quote from the article regarding injecting cleaning products:

“It’s a common method that people utilize when they want to kill themselves.”"
UCSC,focum2n,t1_focgpii,1587676105.0,"Thanks, this is really helpful. What if you can’t take the hard drive out of your computer though? I think mine is built in.
Is running a virtual machine viable?"
UCSC,focchem,t1_fobjapa,1587669696.0,"Hooonestly. I have had to do many proctor u exams and the sheer amount of information they keep about  you is scary, even if they didn’t sell it or anything. I keep tape over my webcam now because I’m always scared that it’ll be accessible."
Coronavirus,fo3g74v,t3_g5fn4k,1587486360.0,Now this is what people should be protesting about!!! No more of the “I want a haircut” bs please.
UCSC,fo3dsgn,t3_g5g9zf,1587485181.0,"CS is prob the most impacted major at the school, and if he got a denial that’s definitely not a great sign. Right now they’re probably seeing how many people who were accepted will actually enroll, and will fill the difference with waitlist kids. So, it’s gonna be dependent on that. 
I don’t think they keep public waitlist data, because when I was waitlisted they told me I wasn’t allowed to see it. I really hope he gets in, but if not UCSC has a pretty good transfer rate from community colleges (not out of state tho rip)."

UCSC,fnwkg8k,t1_fnwfb4t,1587320090.0,"People forget fast, given they STILL need to be reminded to wash their frickin hands."
UCSC,fnuwj95,t1_fnucrkc,1587273004.0,"Very true! Maybe we should just have a straight up pandemic awareness day. That could be beneficial because it would remind people why keeping up public health is important (since another pandemic is bound to happen at some point down the line), and give people who were affected by pandemics space to remember the people they lost."
UCSC,fntn8zu,t1_fntkyf9,1587245063.0,I feel like most of the point is to remember the people that died and to honor the people that were still working as essential and medical workers during this time. 9/11 sucks and nobody likes to remember what happened then but we still set aside a day for that cause it’s important to remember the people involved.
UCSC,fntk67z,t1_fnt9623,1587243292.0,Honestly fair. I really hope that eventually things will be some semblance of normal though. I would be very sad if I could never go see a concert or a movie again or if people are forever sketched out about human contact.
UCSC,fnt8ode,t1_fnt7u4x,1587236756.0,I mean like after it’s not like this? When things are “normal”?
UCSC,fnt3st4,t1_fnt2aem,1587234069.0,"I mean we could just very well combine it all into national pandemic day, but I think we can both agree that hardly anybody is around that rememberers those first two pandemics and the last two have not had nearly as big an impact on our daily lives as covid has. No need to be facetious about it my dude"
UCSC,fmlxdqg,t3_fw2z84,1586194950.0,"Give it a shot for sure, I Imagine that a lot of ppl are going to drop out because everything is online rn"
UCSC,fkumq80,t1_fktdawh,1584552279.0,"If everybody took your advice and got more “valuable skills” life would look very different for you. I hate to break it to you but without the people working “easily replaceable labor” you wouldn’t be able to live a normal and sanitary life. Sewer, garbage, food, utilities, service workers, etc. We either agree these people are essential to our own survival and sanitation and provide them the financial relief and medical care they need to continue to provide these services, or agree that they aren’t essential and we could continue fine without them. It hardly seems ethical to pay people such a low wage that they can hardly buy food and medicine for themselves, provide them no health coverage, and then expect them to be responsible for helping the rest of us in a pandemic. You say their jobs are easily replaceable but would you take their place?"
