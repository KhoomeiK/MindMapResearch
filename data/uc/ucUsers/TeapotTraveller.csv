UCSantaBarbara,fpmkz4u,t1_fpmktpn,1588735393.0,"I'm in grad school. They honestly don't care as much as you'd think.
Edit to explain further: With many PhD/master programs you apply to research under a professor. Those professors are primarily concerned about the research experience you have and your research interests. As long as your GPA isn't below a 3.0 you're probably fine, I know multiple PhD students that had GPAs around 3-3.3, it's the research experience that really matters. GPA is primarily useful for things like fellowships. If you are applying to 1yr masters  where your masters is just extra coursework then your GPA matters more because they have nothing else to go off of, but having a so so GPA will not doom you to be rejected from all masters programs"

UCSantaBarbara,fpmkd1m,t3_geb43j,1588734995.0,"Sorry you're going through a tough time. I would recommend switching your classes to P/NP if they aren't already. The world will go back to normal eventually, but if you want to avoid these online classes I would recommend taking a quarter or two off. You shouldn't throw away an entire degree because of a bad quarter during a pandemic, it's a hard time for anyone to succeed right now. 

As an alumni, let me just say that almost no one cares about your grades after college, they just care whether you got a degree or not. It's been less that 5 years since I graduated and I was obsessed with my GPA in college. I can't even remember it now, it's so unimportant to my life today. This quarter sucks, but it will not ruin your future."

tifu,fpbfpyt,t3_gc8vld,1588468954.0,"Hey there, I know I'm one of hundreds of comments, but you sound like you need to hear it again- don't blame yourself. Dogs will forgive you, now you need to forgive yourself. You are not a bad person, you are a person in immense suffering. When your wife died she took a part of you with her, but she left a bit of herself here with you- her dogs. And even if you don't believe it right now, I bet those dogs love you. Give them a hug, feed them some treats, brush them a bit, give them the affection they probably miss, it might make you and them feel a bit better. And those morning walks can be a blessing -when I was in the depths of my depression there were so many mornings when I didn't think I could get out of bed, but getting outside and walking with my pup helped stop the worst of my destructive thoughts. 

&#x200B;

The road out of depression and grief is a long one, and I am so sorry it is a journey you have to take. I hope all these comments have helped you realize that a lot of people feel for you and care about your well being. You are not the first person that has had to walk this path and you don't have to walk it alone. There are support groups and professionals that are literally there to help you.

&#x200B;

From one internet stranger to another, I am sending you (and your pups) many hugs, and I hope a bit of relief from suffering will come to you soon <3"
AskReddit,fp0d2t0,t1_foz19xw,1588206937.0,"I agree with this. The message it was trying to push about beauty not being skin deep was too in your face and cliche that it didn't have any emotional impact for me, which was disappointing because I love a good underdog/outcast story.

Make sure to go easy on yourself, I like to make myself a cup of tea and paint (I'm not good, I just like the process) when I'm feeling down. Depression can make you uninterested in the things you used to like, but it's important to remember that depression lies. Try to ignore its lies for 5 minutes and do something that you used to love or used to give you comfort (something that can be done indoors or away from a public area, of course). Whenever you have a bad moment, remember that depression lies.

UCSantaBarbara,fnso5qv,t3_g3hq3n,1587225563.0,"I promise you, everyone hates this format. Of course other students hate this format. The professors also hate this format, they're just trying to give it some amount of structure (with attendance and limited access) because IRL classes have this kind of structure. Yes it's annoying, but they're literally just trying to push students to keep up with the material. TAs also hate this format. It sucks spending hours making a lesson plan only to talk to a dozen black screens that never talk back. I have no idea what my students look like and I don't know what most of them sound like. The worst IRL class I've taught is miles better than these online classes. 

&#x200B;

It sucks all around. Online classes suck. It takes a huge amount of patience from all sides. Try not to let your anger get the best of you, the only person that will really suffer from it is yourself. The good news is this format is temporary, we only have to deal with it for 7 more weeks. Try to find ways to mitigate the bad parts (I find it helpful to speed up recorded lectures to 1.25 or 1.5 speed). And make sure to take care of yourself."

UCSantaBarbara,fnn7nue,t3_g232hp,1587086200.0,"Hi there! I lived in San Clem for 2 years and now live elsewhere. Here are my opinions:

&#x200B;

1. The kitchen is small. If you are in a 2 person apt, it's fine. If you are in a 4 person apt and people regularly cook then it definitely gets crowded.
2. The bedrooms are fine, I never had any problem. You can also move one of the bookshelves they provide out into the main living area if you want to free up more space. I have lived in 2 locations off campus at this point an they both had smaller bedrooms.
3. San Clem can feel a little like undergrad, but it's honestly a useful stepping stone. Finding affordable housing in the SB area is extremely difficult, and it is comparatively quite cheap to break the San Clem lease if you find another nice place to live. I live off campus now and I really like it, but it took about half a year to find my current place, and since I moved out in the summer I didn't have to pay San Clem anything for breaking my contract a bit early. You will never have that flexibility anywhere else.
4. It's mostly people in there 20s, with a couple 30 somethings (more often in the 2 bedroom apts)
5. Cheap, convenient, flexible, no deposit, anything that needs fixing is fixed for free. It's also very close to the Rec Cen (the gym). I worked out very regularly when I lived there. Kitchen/appliances are going to be newer that what you would find elsewhere at an equivalent price.
6. Very close to campus, it sometimes feels like you never leave. Also close to undergrad housing
7. When I started grad school I went to several San Clem socials and actually met several friends there. I would say the social aspect usually declines throughout the school year, but when you start out knowing no one, being in San Clem really helps to make friends. A large amount of 1st and 2nd years live there so it's easy to hang out, and there are fairly frequent community events.

Overall, I would say it's a good stepping stone. Easy to meet people, very flexible and convenient. I wouldn't recommend living there for all of grad school, but I certainly appreciate it for the time I had there and the friends I met.

&#x200B;

As always, roommates are hit or miss, but if you like to cook or want more control over your apartment, I would recommend the 2 person apt"
UCSantaBarbara,fnn5xdz,t3_g2rarb,1587085112.0,"I am one of a billion TAs for that class. You should watch the lectures. I watch them on 1.25 or 1.5 speed, it helps the lectures go a bit faster. The readings are optional and will not be on the test.

EEMB 3 is a memorization based class, so it is difficult to do well by just skimming lecture slides. You will be tested on the scientists mentioned, the experiments mentioned, the steps of the formation of life, the cellular processes mentioned, the branches of life, etc. Take notes or make flash cards. From experience with this class, if you do not put the time in to memorize material then you should not expect an A or B

Edit: The test is open book, so I guess you have to worry less about pure memorization this time around. But take good notes to reference, I would guess you'll run into timing issues if you don't have organized notes to easily search through"
