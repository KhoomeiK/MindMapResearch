apexlegends,fpa812h,t1_fp94352,1588442683.0,All of your comments and posts in this sub are super negative and rude man. Yeah you might be better at a game but try to be the better person. You’re making this place toxic :(
fantasywriters,fot5yv1,t3_g9cftd,1588045400.0,"Sanderson also has a podcast called Writing Excuses he does with a couple other authors, and it’s from 2008-current. I just started listening to it and I like how they use more examples from literature to explain their points than his lectures, and they go into a larger variety of topics. Episodes are only 15min!"
berkeley,fo7xm39,t1_fo7turg,1587586290.0,Your comment history is so negative man :( just be nice to people
berkeley,fnficg3,t3_g1gsiz,1586908610.0,I don’t think anyone is going to know for sure until the curve is flatter and Berkeley announces potential plans of action for the fall (as far as online or not)

WriteWithMe,fnckkj9,t3_g0yyix,1586839135.0,"I would be happy to! I’m not a professional literary critic by any means, but I’ve read a wide scope of things both academic and genre, and would be happy to help however I can!

I tend to be drawn more to fantasy and historical fiction more than anything else, but it might be good for both of us if your writing doesn’t fall under either of those categories. Either way, send me a DM if you’re interested!"
