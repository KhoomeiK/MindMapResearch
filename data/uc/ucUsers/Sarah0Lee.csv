ucr,fp187vt,t3_gajswk,1588227217.0,"I agree it should be optional. At another school they are allowing students to change their class to S/NC after grades are posted. They want to encourage everyone to try their best, but if the situation is rough, they have a backup option. I think it would be best to do that. I know I want my GPA boost since this is the last quarter I’m taking this many units."

ucr,foxtnj5,t1_fow19ng,1588155895.0,"I think it’s mandated in the CARES Act that half the funding an institution gets will go directly to student. So you all will get something. 

CSUSB sent info to their students today that they will get $200-$900 by May 15. The date leads me to believe there may also be regulation on how quickly institutions must distribute the funds."

ucr,fommz1v,t3_g8a289,1587896218.0,"Your feelings are valid. This is a weird time and it is difficult to try and be a student when so much of life is up in the air. If you are able to remove stress from your life by making a class S/NC or something else, try it. You’re not alone in feeling frustrated and disconnected from learning."
ucr,fomme9a,t3_g7z3o3,1587895562.0,"The SI just posted a bunch of stuff on canvas.

She has said that she tests from her slides. Maybe look for times she asked questions in the slides or drew something out. The homework has been very straightforward, so I assume studying the homework and understanding *why* a certain answer is correct would be good. Also know your amino acids."
ucr,fol9e11,t1_foikul7,1587857490.0,Wow that is just.... totally fitting of a system that protects professors regardless of their crazy actions.

ucr,fo5yge1,t1_fo4qme0,1587539879.0,I genuinely don’t understand any of this. You can’t just drop a class on your own? Sorry I’m new to this school and am baffled by this system.
ucr,fo5yd9c,t1_fo4pnkq,1587539793.0,At CSUSB the departments I was involved in all had faculty advisors. So I would go see a professor or the department chair for anything I needed and things were resolved very quickly. It’s really a travesty that y’all are paying for this and don’t have quality advising.

ucr,fo5xp8f,t3_g5mmvt,1587539152.0,"At my last school my advisors were professors. I guess that is the benefit of a small department (~300 students). 

I’m sorry y’all have so many issues with these people. If anyone doesn’t mind, could you fill me in on the advising situation."
ucr,fo22yk0,t3_g4nd8n,1587448138.0,"There is a feature on Blackboard for the professor to set up an automatic end to an exam if you click off screen, but I haven’t seen anyone use it yet. Only one professor at my last university ever used it out of the classes I took."

AskReddit,fnjerp5,t3_g24ie5,1586997496.0,"The time to start a 401k or IRA is when you are young. While it’s much easier to begin retirement savings when you have an employer match, whatever you can spare is going to grow over time. The market is scary right now, but time is your friend. Also, deposits into your IRA can help you when filing your taxes. Even small contributions while you’re young can help set you up for financial stability when you’re older. One regret I have is not opening my 401K sooner."

ucr,fn2cznx,t3_fyueac,1586584784.0,"I’m not in the class but I’m auditing BCH 100 with Dr Dingwall specifically because I want to be her TA in the future and I’m honestly floored by how good she is. She is a veteran of online content, she is organized and clear, the uses a good mic, and she is very patient when people ask questions. She also has a very successful discussion board where most students’ questions are answered in under 10 minutes. I’ve seen people post questions at like 1 am and still have support from fellow students within 10 minutes. I’m learning a lot, too. Quality content. Chef’s kiss. 

My other professors are also good and have been particularly patient with the transition, but Dr Dingwall is excelling."
AskReddit,fmvcqrs,t1_fmvclc3,1586412579.0,So if you’re using LaTeX it’s easy but I’ve yet to learn that but using the equations feature on Word isn’t horrible once you get used to it. Fortunately I’m a chemist so we rarely need those.

AmItheAsshole,fmrxbbw,t3_fx3htx,1586338923.0,"NTA. I think there’s a huge difference between romantic and sexual relationships. So yes, a woman isn’t defined by her genitalia. But your attraction is also not defined by other people. Just as you would not devalue a man because he is not your type, I don’t think you devalue this trans woman. If I understand this correctly you’re romantically attracted to women and sexually attracted to women with female genitalia. And this is ok. You’re not an asshole for that. Maybe the comment was a slight bit crude or could sting a little. But I don’t think you’re the AH here. As long as you value and respect people with penises, that is all that matters. I know lesbians who share your sentiment about dick, so you’re not alone."
ucr,fmrrcx9,t1_fmrpr34,1586332674.0,What a jerk. You’re supposed to learn a language by reading a book? My lord. Have you reached out to their department chair?
ucr,fmhclb9,t3_ftw8jd,1586074672.0,"I think they’re handling this poorly by not being transparent about the fees but you are still using some of these. The library has online services that they have expanded. You still have access to the ARC just online. If they were better at explaining why the fees are still applicable that would be more understandable. But the UC system treats its students like children instead of the competent, educated individuals they are. I don’t know all the details but I’m sure there are reasons that the fees are still applicable."
