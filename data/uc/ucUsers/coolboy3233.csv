aznidentity,fpmtfs1,t1_fpmsu7y,1588741257.0,"There is a reason hip hop and rap music is angry, because Blacks are angry. They're mostly angry at themselves though, black on black violence is at an all time high. They've tried being angry at the white man but that doesnt' work so well, they just get thrown in jail and arrested, so it's more like Asians are just a new target for them to vent their anger. Again stupid because they're still poor and they still don't have an education, nothing solved."
aznidentity,fpmpmf3,t1_fpmemn3,1588738470.0,"Asians have inherently done nothing wrong but Blacks are jealous and angry of Asians for many reasons including their success. They are just someone else Blacks can blame for their own problems. They are also angry in general at everyone including themselves for their ""situation.""  Just look at the black on black violence that continues to plague America. That is basically what their anger stems from — years and years of systematic racism and oppression. It's pretty stupid too because it doesn't solve anything for them."
aznidentity,fpmod7x,t3_ge4y1m,1588737605.0,Asians are too humble for that.
aznidentity,fpmngfr,t3_ge2fic,1588737004.0,Anger comes from fear. Why are whites so scared right now? Let me explain. Whites are inherently fearful that they will all die off more quickly because of the virus and Asians will take their place sooner rather than later. That is white peoples deepest fear.

Americans do not want to quarantine even if it is the only way to stop the spread of the virus. Eastern society is less focused on the individual and more ""the group."" Asians see themselves as part of a larger group and much more willing to sacrifice, that is why Asia was able to contain the virus quickly.
