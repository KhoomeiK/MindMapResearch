You really shouldn't do this. Only two things matter for law school admission - high GPA and high LSAT. The name of your undergrad doesn't matter. You're not more likely to get into Yale from UCLA over the other two schools. 

UCLA does very well in sending students to law school. Indeed, we're either the largest or second largest ABA feeder school in the country, depending on the year.

It doesn't matter if your undergrad is Northwest Oklahoma Panhandle State Veterinary School; Harvard will take the 4.0 from there before the 3.8 from Princeton.

The calculus obviously changes if law school isn't the only goal. The UCLA name/brand/etc is undoubtedly better than KU's - I don't know how much that matters for Environmental Science, but if you have any interest in applying the Econ degree towards working in finance it means a huge deal (and a UCLA degree ain't worth all that much in that world, if I'm being entirely honest). It's probably safe to say that the UCLA name + being in Los Angeles will mean that more doors will be open to you regardless of what career path you choose. 

Only you can say wether the money difference is worth it. $100k+ in loans for a UCLA degree sounds nuts to me, especially if I'm trying to be rational about it. But there are many other things to consider, especially if you're getting money from UCLA or have someone else signing the checks. It's four years of your life, after all.

Also - UCLA is a state school. It's a good one—some would say the best—but a state school nonetheless, with the full complement of state school problems.
