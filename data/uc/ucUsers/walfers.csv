You get to read theses from the founders of a lot of modern frameworks behind international relations, but since it's quite theoretical, you don't really get bogged down by a lot of examples at first. Later on, you observe specific events and try to analyze them based on the framework you learn early on (realism, liberalism, constructivism, etc.)"
