Edit: at least a 2.4 lol"

UCI,fpiu9wj,t1_fpit8cq,1588648859.0,They don’t just hand out 18 million dollars without a solid plan.
UCI,fpisxwf,t3_gdowug,1588647998.0,"Google UCI computer science and it will be one of the first links.

Edit:
Eh, here you go: http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/#majorstext"
UCI,fpisuxq,t1_fpirbzx,1588647946.0,"I think the speculation is just wrong. Our leases were cancelled before the CARES act even went into effect, right? The CARES money is meant to go to students (half of it). DACA students will be receiving aid from the UC system rather than UCI to compensate for the CARES act not providing them with assistance. It’s just a matter of time."
UCI,fphajky,t3_gdh738,1588617846.0,I’d say very very unlikely for engineering but not impossible.
UCI,fpfu7r1,t3_gd884d,1588583677.0,It’s 60 dollars for something you might only get one chance for and you can have it the rest of your life idk
UCI,fpdrqbn,t3_gcw2ir,1588532893.0,Study as much as you have to and you’ll get through it.
UCI,fpapv9e,t3_gcdjen,1588453225.0,Not bic for 143a thank you for coming to my ted talk
UCI,fp8y8s6,t3_gc2sra,1588407241.0,"Probably not unless you’ve taken something at UCI to satisfy that prereq, but email a counselor to find out"
UCI,fp7puat,t1_fp7c35t,1588375323.0,At least the UC system is taking care of them. They’re students too and not immune to the current state of the world...
UCI,fp7polk,t3_gbqvej,1588375234.0,I got my money back and I feel like more than I was owed lol
UCI,fp7j9al,t1_fp7iqbz,1588371660.0,"And the “lecture videos” are just him essentially reading slides and the zybook almost verbatim. I’ve looked at the discord for the other 143a section and it seems they are doing programming and have actual lectures, wish I got in that section instead. This midterm is gonna be fucked."
UCI,fp7iezz,t1_fp73u07,1588371209.0,"I’ve had that exact thought. On piazza he says thousands have passed it, and that’s fine, but it doesn’t change the fact I’ve learned nothing??? Am I stupid or is this class just not teaching me anything? I can’t tell sometimes"
UCI,fp70nuv,t3_gbok4u,1588361911.0,We dont
UCI,fp6vfkk,t3_gbnsbp,1588359265.0,"The zybook is a fantastic resource and all you need to pass. Just kidding, it sucks and I don’t know either

Also: the quality of education from this class is THE WORST I’ve ever had."
UCI,fp09j8y,t3_gakkj7,1588205027.0,Do wongma 53
UCI,foz147w,t3_gadmw0,1588182872.0,"MacBook Pro, the biggest and baddest one they sell. Jk. But you should probably go with Windows or Mac. If I can say Acer makes fairly priced laptops of decent quality. Macs are great too, I love mine, can’t say it’s worth the price though (for the hardware) but it’s nice."
UCI,forn6kb,t3_g9717g,1588015068.0,"My gf is at ucsd now and wishes she chose UCI. Few reasons: housing sucks ass, administration sucks ass, the food sucks ass, aside from the beach being nearby, there’s nothing nearby, it’s more on the antisocial side (arguably), and the campus is harder to navigate. It does have more prestige in the eyes of some, but not all, and San Diego (La Jolla) is nice AF.

Side note: I’m UCI biased and the list of negatives above are just some of her complaints.
Oh and have fun parking there, especially if you want to go out and come home after 8. Pangaea and Hopkins fill up and you’ll be chilling waiting for a spot to open for like an hour lol (and you pay out the ass for the parking pass)"
UCI,foj1dn3,t3_g7qcdj,1587804509.0,Don’t think fees and tuition are going to change whether or not we stay remote. Fees are applied regardless of your usage. Ex: recreation center fee must be paid even if you do not use the gym.
UCI,foiv2bw,t3_g7olhy,1587797976.0,Wong-Ma is a slave driver but runs a very organized class. I’m learning a lot but dying a little bit.
UCI,fodqhjo,t3_g6xmc4,1587688203.0,I had 2 Ws and I transferred in last year. CS.
UCI,foa3pzl,t3_g6jtja,1587638747.0,Do you expect anyone to say yes
UCI,fo40pfi,t3_g5lg9f,1587496195.0,It’s not a hard series if you have an interest in cs other than getting a job
UCI,fnrmeqr,t3_g3i5jr,1587193673.0,You’re never expected to reinvent the wheel but don’t copy code.
UCI,fnnkdc7,t3_g2pi7h,1587094423.0,Why you have lettuce in an egg carton
Bakersfield,fnn3nfw,t1_fnltyje,1587083709.0,Multiple 24 packs of tp. You’re part of the problem people are having lol
UCI,fnj2rzq,t1_fnj2o0q,1586990882.0,"Awesome, good news!

UCI,fn93287,t3_g0blh3,1586757767.0,I want one :(
UCI,fn92074,t3_g0cuhn,1586756813.0,Nice place but my roommate sucked ass
UCI,fn91qlx,t1_fn7xo4f,1586756577.0,It's a pretty nice town though. lol
UCI,fn7amp1,t1_fn769tl,1586716562.0,Why would you assume equal distribution when students’ financial aid awards can vary significantly?
UCI,fn5d1yk,t3_fzocq0,1586661710.0,What is this for officially?
UCI,fn5cg4f,t1_fn5c5pj,1586661273.0,Never told them their current situation doesn’t matter? Said cancel plans of suicide lol
UCI,fn59vfo,t3_fz12co,1586659451.0,Norte and Camino are across the street from one another so as far as distance goes they’re almost the same but technically Camino is closer. Bus stops are basically shared so commute is the same to campus. Amenities are also about the same but I’d say Camino has a better small gym and game room. I chose Camino because I liked it better :) if the extra rent isn’t a huge deal just go with Camino
UCI,fn55iez,t3_fznsd3,1586656416.0,"Not to sound negative but almost any doctor will happily prescribe you anti depressants! I’m only speaking from my own experience, results may vary, but I would say stay away from them!

Things will get better for you, so cancel any plans you have made and time will cure all :)

Edit: rationale for staying off of them: they won’t make you happy they will make you numb. You will become addicted to and dependent on them. When you quit taking them, if ever, you will never feel happy again. At least a natural path to happiness is possible whereas a synthetic one is just that—synthetic."
UCI,fn4giy1,t3_fz12co,1586640925.0,Probably Camino or VDC Norte are the best ACC. I like Camino. It’s about as much more expensive as it is nicer in comparison to Norte (which isn’t a lot).
UCI,fmvdr7g,t3_fxmlxk,1586413512.0,It is shocking to me how few black students we have at UCI. I definitely do notice when there is a black student in one of my classes (cs) only because there are so few.
UCI,fmvdd73,t3_fxmwsi,1586413151.0,You could simply lift something heavy and see how it feels
UCI,fmvdbml,t3_fxn58j,1586413110.0,It’s like a free for all this quarter just go P/NP unless you know you’re gonna get the grade you want.
UCI,fmr1oaq,t3_fwvny5,1586311827.0,4+8=12
UCI,fmin4j6,t1_fmi9wvt,1586112898.0,Give them community service where they have to scrub the ventilators muahaha
