UCSantaBarbara,fotovck,t1_fosgi9t,1588060886.0,"For the pre-bio major courses, I didn’t find the curve to be too bad, it’s just the exams can be difficult and you have to stay on top of your work. But for one of the intro bio classes for example, my grade deadass got curved up about 10% (got As or Bs on the midterm, C on the final, ended up with A in the class). In the intro chem series I got an 87% in one of the courses and ended up with a solid A. For ochem I think for most classes an A would fall around 85-88%. 

I think econ is another beast in grading at UCSB"

UCSantaBarbara,fnp68xa,t3_g343gw,1587139938.0,"Hey, I'm really sorry to hear about the incredibly immature behavior coming from a student at UCSB. Unfortunately, anonymity brings out the worst in people and often times students forget their professors/TA have feelings and use these course evals to lash out at them. I've taken a course with a professor who always delivered engaging and interesting lectures, yet her rate my professor page is just filled with students mocking the way she stutters. I would guess that students who did poorly in a course and can't criticize anything else but physical traits of a professor/TA likely did poorly due to their own fault and just wanted a scapegoat. 

I hope you take the criticism that is legit and don't take the rest to heart. I appreciate all that you do for us and I recognize that TAs play a huge role in our learning experience at UCSB."

UCSantaBarbara,fn41r2y,t1_fn418xx,1586632297.0,Hey don't feel guilty about taking breaks! You will perform better and retain more info if your brain gets a moments rest than if you just trudge through for hours on end and try to make things work. After 9:30 I always call it quits and play some games because at that point I'm not even learning anything anymore. Hopefully we all make it through this quarter okay. I appreciate you bringing up this discussion.
UCSantaBarbara,fn404a4,t3_fzccd6,1586631352.0,"Yep I've been working from about 8 AM until 9:30PM everyday for the past week with breaks here and there. I'm barely on track and I was trying to get ahead. I've had to drop a class because the stress was really getting to me.

One of my boyfriend's professors assigned him about hundreds of pages of readings for a single class to do every week, as well as quizzes every other day. I'm not sure if this is considered cheating but he split up the readings amongst his friend group (everyone writes a detailed summary for a given section) and has finally been able to focus on his other classes. Of course it's shitty to cheat. But right now we all are faced with a world that requires a lot more patience and leniency than ever before, and professors/certain departments aren't understanding that."
relationship_advice,fn3vt97,t1_fn3q83y,1586628897.0,"Honestly it sounds like your dad was also trying to find an excuse to leave too. Usually when people cheat and someone gets pregnant, at least one person in the affair will freak out and try to cut ties/end things. Of course I don’t know the full extent of the situation, but in my opinion your dad willing to drop everything and get together with your mom shows that even if your mom hadn’t gotten pregnant with you, he would still have left for another excuse sooner or later. Don’t put ANY blame on yourself for breaking up a family. Your sister is also completely misdirecting her anger and resentment. All the blame lies on your dad and you guys should hold him accountable."

worldnews,fmy3m2l,t1_fmy1pqh,1586477396.0,">The younger middle class generations have grown up with dogs as pets, not as working animals/livestock.

I understand that older generations can be more scared of dogs, but this quote above was the comment you're replying to. So you admit that it is true that younger middle class generations of Chinese/Asians in general are learning to grow up with dogs as pets and that we are really not very pet-averse and are becoming more accepting. Why make a comment saying otherwise?

Edit: Bro, even your article says more Chinese are getting dogs as pets and the number of registered dogs in Beijing hit 1 million back in 2012. Yes, the CCP may have found dogs a menace, but that doesn't mean the younger generation of Chinese do as well. They're literally complaining that so many Chinese are now owning dogs (although they should do better in cleaning up after their dogs)."
