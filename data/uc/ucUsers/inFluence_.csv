VALORANT,fobrq7s,t1_fo9s804,1587662951.0,"honestly no idea, I don't think it's internet but hardware doesn't explain this bug either"
VALORANT,fo8v9xu,t3_g66kqc,1587604568.0,"this is my exact issue and i'm running on a 2080S with an i9 and ethernet. i've tried sooo many different things and read every forum but i couldn't manage to fix it.

it's weird though, since the first time i played this wasn't present. maybe started around 4 days ago"
columbia,fo8v3p2,t1_fo8p7kd,1587604465.0,"sorry i don't think anyone can say for sure, but fwiw i think you're credentials are really strong. from what i know i think transfers are predominantly focused on reasons as opposed to just stellar credentials

columbia's ai/ml courses are also impacted too and i don't think that going to columbia would fix that issue though. trying to get ai/ml research is probably a good thing to do if you can, and if you can't, may be a good reason to add in your essay"
columbia,fo8ofjs,t3_g6av31,1587600583.0,"but why would you want to transfer? seems like you're doing great. i don't think there's much of a difference, especially for nyu v columbia for job or academia prospects"
