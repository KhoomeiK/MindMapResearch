On campus housing is more expensive but it will be easier to get out of a contract if classes remain remote. Off campus housing will be cheaper (it could even be substantial price difference since the market might take a hit), but any lease is formed at the individual scale and you will find it harder to get out of. But you can insist on an escape clause."
UCSD,fp50paf,t3_gayq9r,1588312641.0,No.

Yeah, we haven't figured out the elegant form we need to mimic to produce a more grandiose version of our artificial intelligence producing systems. But all these systems are still on the same trend line as we people are in terms of being intelligent systems.

You think you're creating a distinction between types. You're not. All you're doing is pointing out that these systems aren't as effective as we hope we can make them."
science,fp2x4ug,t1_fp28nt9,1588269356.0,But I would call that artificial intelligence. Any system that feeds information it produces back into itself to synthesize deeper information is an intelligent system. The distinction you are making is just an issue of scale.

But are you saying that this virus is an issue mostly for people who require healthcare and the general public is ok?

I know I get weird looks when I talk about this. But I feel like the viral load factor is not being considered enough. I think a healthy person is ok if they get a passing low dose and their immune system is allowed to fight it without being overwhelmed. But since this is a novel virus, people's immune systems aren't reacting right away. And the further the infection gets into the lungs before the immune system responds, the worse a person will fare, even if they are healthy.

Wave Two paranoia might not be delusional."

You don't see Russian troops in Ukraine? Are you that delusional?"
