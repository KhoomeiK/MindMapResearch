If they did this it would 100% be split online/in-person right? There's no way that Santa Cruz will be able to handle the remaining 2/3rds of the on campus population."
Frozen,fpi7f4j,t1_fpi5sy1,1588635165.0,"Don't worry, you're not rambling, everything you've said here is a valuable opinion.

I am also a bit concerned about subreddit activity if screenshot posts are not permitted 6 out of 7 days a week. We would definitely monitor this."
Frozen,fpi3m1k,t1_fpi34ot,1588632998.0,">I don't like the idea of an ""only screenshots day""

I should clarify, it wouldn't be a day where only screenshots would be allowed. It would be the only day of the week that screenshots would be allowed to be posted. Discussions, fanart, and fanfiction are all so underrepresented in posts recently, so we would definitely be OK with these being posted at any time. 


>Also I am all for community awards, but make sure there is just as much Anna as Elsa, because they both deserve an equal amount of love :)

We've discussed this and definitely will keep it in mind. One thing we considered doing is not using Anna/Elsa for awards and instead doing things like a ""Snowflake Award"" (or soemthing more inspired). But on the other hand, the characters are an integral part of the fandom and are the most memorable thing about the movies, so it might be strange to not include them."
