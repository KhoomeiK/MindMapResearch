ucr,fphxrm4,t1_fphuo33,1588629770.0,Is an 11% voter turnout normal for this kind of election? Seems extremely unrepresentative
ucr,fphs26w,t1_fphh86u,1588626769.0,It was literally in the video description lol
ucr,fp4xqmu,t1_fp4wvg1,1588310207.0,"UCR alumni work at SpaceX, Tesla, Google, Facebook, Amazon... the list goes on. Engineering and CS are becoming fields where it's up to you to market yourself and be an attractive candidate. School reputation is a very poor metric for performance in these fields, and employers are seeing that more and more."
ucr,fp3n4no,t1_fp344o8,1588282242.0,"I lost my internship, my mom lost her job, my dad had his hours reduced substantially... the list goes on. If one UC gives optional S/NC for classes this quarter, including major requirments, then they all should. The letter grades I'm earning this quarter are not a reflection of my abilities at all."
ucr,fp2j0j7,t1_fp2hqc8,1588262587.0,"I disagree. I am in favor of it as a choice, not a requirement, for this quarter."
ucr,fp0fs3g,t1_fp0akd3,1588208406.0,"Nah I took it last Spring, it being online honestly shouldn't affect the material since all assignments were written (and 1 presentation)"
ucr,fp09v27,t1_fp09koh,1588205201.0,"You'll present a powerpoint presenation with your group. You'll have to contribute to online documents as a group, which isn't so bad because the documents are broken down into sections. So you can split up the work pretty easily. And it can be done online I imagine easily as well."
ucr,fp09ez1,t3_gakgue,1588204963.0,Super easy
ucr,fozbasm,t1_foz8tyn,1588187787.0,"It appears in BCOE you still cannot S/NC major courses. Dang. 

Sign that petition boys and girls."
ucr,foz804a,t1_foz7n50,1588186211.0,That's probably why they also proposed a cut of 10% to CNAS TA-lines. Less students means they'll need less TAs.
ucr,foz6o6d,t1_foy9zjr,1588185579.0,Can you do this for major courses in BCOE? S/NC for EE100A would be clutch
ucr,fov8340,t3_g9ph4w,1588096913.0,"Start a club, get that shit going"
ucr,fo8r93v,t3_g6coy9,1587602196.0,ENGR 180W
ucr,fo5k8in,t3_g5snna,1587527692.0,"There are so many posts on this, search around"
ucr,fnxaek7,t1_fnwdpo0,1587334662.0,""" Iâ€™m not sure what the continuing student housing deal is at UCSC""

It's really really bad"
ucr,fnexre2,t3_g1d0ep,1586897803.0,"Assuming this is true is a horrible idea, email your adviser"
ucr,flpdxm3,t3_fq9bhx,1585357229.0,Be somewhat competent and you'll pass
