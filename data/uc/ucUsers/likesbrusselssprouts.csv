motorcycles,fpdf4da,t1_fpdc20i,1588525760.0,"I 100% agree with you, I don't think our philosophies are really that different. But I'll offer a counterpoint. 

It's possible that by changing components too early, that you increase your failure rate because you [never come down the wall of the bathtub.](https://www.weibull.com/hotwire/issue21/ht21_1.gif)

Service intervals are based on relative lifetimes of different components. Sure, they're based on some sort of baseline, but they are somewhat arbitrary. Component lifetime does vary significantly based on how a bike is used. It's impossible to know where you are on the bathtub, how wide it is, or how steep the walls are, but you can get a sense of your risk by understanding the average lifetime of a top end, bottom end, clutch etc. of the typical rider and comparing your riding style and maintenance regime to the typical rider.

There are components that I change before the service interval (clutch dampers), because I know they tend to fail often. But for other components for which there is a wealth of knowledge from mechanics, riders, etc. telling me otherwise, I choose not to. Partially because it costs money and time, and partially because it will increase my failure rate in the short term. 

Whats more, the consequences of top end failure are probably broadly the same regardless of failure from age and overuse, which would surface late in life, or failure from manufacturing issues, improper break-in or installation, etc., which would surface early in life.  Assuming that I will eventually have a failure. I now have saved myself a boatload of cash for a rebuild. Will I feel stupid for not changing the failed component earlier? Absolutely. But I'll have the money to do a full rebuild - which in itself is safer, for the same reason that we change chain and sprockets at the same time."
motorcycles,fpdas2b,t1_fpd8mz2,1588523308.0,"Ehhhh to each their own! Average top end life for trailridden EXC/FEs is probably on the order of 300/400 hours. And that's for a refresh prompted by loss of compression or oil burn, not a blowup. The manual also calls for changing all engine bearings at 135 hours, and I can be pretty sure I've never met a single soul that does that.

The VAST majority of top end failures come from acute misuse. e.g. hitting the rev limiter, over revving on a downhill, etc. Certainly, if you're burning oil or have a loss of compression, you should eventually do a refresh, but for the majority of us, it simply isn't necessary. There is nothing magic about 135 hours..."
motorcycles,fpd7yr0,t1_fpc1rry,1588521698.0,"Yea I feel that. Keep in mind, this is the Husky equivalent of the EXC, not the SX. The manual specifies 135hrs for piston swaps.

That being said, she is definitely due for a swap soon..."
motorcycles,fpbtvbz,t1_fpbsuj5,1588478588.0,"I changed the cam chain, CC tensioner, and guides at 200 hours. I pulled the head while doing that. Bore and piston were fine.

I'm a firm believer that how you use something matters more than how *much* you use it. Clean the air filter and make sure it seals well. Change the oil every 15 hours. Don't abuse the clutch and stay off the rev limiter. Your bike will outlast you if you treat it well."

I knew that I couldn’t take another fall. So I made a plan. Every corner I would look straight ahead to the next corner. If I couldn’t see the next corner, I’d take a sip of water and recheck. Let the bike take the hurt. Over each obstacle ONE MORE TIME. Up each hill ONE MORE TIME. Around each corner ONE MORE TIME. The final lap is a blur of adrenaline in my mind, but I didn’t fall. Around the final few corners I looked towards the finish. Checkered flag. White AND black. Thank god.

[“Fuck it. I did it.”](https://imgur.com/cMXVYZB)


I stopped to let the organizers take the transponder out my pack. I was completely and entirely mentally gone, but I was beaming. I had done it. I rode back to the pits got off the bike and collapsed into a camping chair. [I. Had. Done It.](https://imgur.com/cNlAzE0)


**Part 8: The teardown…**

Of course, when you assemble a bike to race that implies that you need to disassemble the bike after the race. It took the better part of an hour for me to gather the strength to start pulling the bike apart. Wheels, forks, fenders. Bolts in baggies. [Chips in mouth.](https://imgur.com/FHXrKNt) Bolts in baggies. Bread in mouth. Each new disassembled part hurt. Meanwhile I was meeting all the folks that had helped me. “Did you hear me yell your name?!” “You’re the guy with the Prius?” And my favorite, “Y’all are crazy.”

In the end, I finished in 20th place, miles behind the class leader, but a respectable finish. Not bad for a guy racing a bike with turn signals out of a subcompact. My wrist would end up being strained. Two months later it still isn’t 100%. But I’m glad for it.

Thank you to Toyota for designing the world’s greatest adventure vehicle.

Thank you to Glen Helen to putting on a hell of a race.

Thank you to the folks who helped me in the pits and on the course.

And thank you to my SO, who let me cram a dirt bike into the back of her car.

motorcycles,fpb7vro,t1_fpb7txb,1588463987.0,"**Part 5: Mishaps…**

Over a long enough race you and your bike are bound to fail (or both). I didn’t have any failures, but I saw plenty of them on the side of the course and I had some major scares. A few are below,

Hour ~3: Mid-section in the singletrack, my handguard suddenly swung down and hit my knee. I jabbed the brakes and rode off course to park the bike in the bushes. The bolt that held the left handguard to the perch had fallen off. The bolt is a weird size and I don’t know if I have a spare back in the pits. I run back down the trail scanning the ground with the pit in my stomach quickly getting larger. Miraculously, after what felt like an eternity, I found the bolt, head up, speared in the sand around 20 meters from the bike. Finger tight is fine to hold it until I get back to the pits.

Hour ~4.5: I enter my favorite part of the course, the trophy truck track, a wide open (and wide open throttle) section of long rolling jumps and flat corners. 5th gear coming into a corner I stab at the gear shifter. Zero resistance and it bottoms out… It had fallen off the spindle. I put my foot under it to cradle it and stop the bike. “I DEFINITELY do not have a spare bolt for this,” I thought. I looked down at my foot, somehow the bolt and lever remained together. I put the lever back on and tightened the bolt. It held for the rest of the race.

Hour 5: Glen Helen is known for its incredibly steep descents. Your stomach literally drops coming off of some of the crests. It feels like a roller coaster. The downhills got very gnarly towards the end and it was truly difficult to keep your hands on the bars. One of the particularly gnarly descents was slightly off-camber and transitioned into a left-hand turn at the bottom, so you had to drag the rear brake to kick the rear wheel out and make the corner… but not too much. Around hour 5, I got sloppy and hit the rear brake too hard 75% down the hill. I swapped ends and went over the bars. My right hand stayed with the bike and was caught under the handguard.

This was scary, the Pro riders truly FLY down these hills and with it being off-camber it is difficult to see downed bikes. I detached myself from the bars and stood over the bike. I NEEDED to get it up… but I NEEDED to catch my breath. After a minute or two I swung the bike around by the seat so that it was perpendicular to the hill with wheels facing downward. I lifted the bike. My right wrist bent down under the pressure. It felt weak, like it might tear off if I pulled hard enough. I grunted and shoved my knee under the bike to hold it. I knew I wouldn’t be able to pick it up again if it fell end over end. I started the bike and put it in gear, using the clutch to slowly turn it downhill. I sat there for a moment and heard the radiator fan kick on. In one motion I put my left foot on the peg swung my leg over, and released the clutch. It is the hardest fall I’ve ever taken.

**Part 6: The final stages…**

After my crash around hour 5 I really started to feel it. I couldn’t open the throttle fully and deflections or square-edged bumps would cause my wrist to buckle. I had to alter my riding style to keep myself on the bike. I fell a few times over the next laps trying to out-ride my injury. It wasn’t working.

There were two or three short sections of pavement after the long singletrack section The transitions between dirt and pavement were sharp, so on most laps I would pop the front wheel up and over them to avoid taco-ing the rim. In the lap following my crash simply COULDN’T do it. I popped the wheel up, but couldn’t hold the bars well. The front end bucked and dragged my body with it. Between two of these pavement sections there was a short section of sand whoops. I could barely hold on. Feet off the pegs. The bike was riding me. As I rode up onto the second pavement section, I veered off to the side to let a rider pass me. “You okay?” he yelled. I gave a thumbs up.

That was my cue. I pulled off to the side and shut off the bike. “I can’t do this,” I thought. I sat on the bike watching my tunnel vision slowly return to normal. Every sip of water would burn the roof of my mouth like the water was mixed with vinegar. I sat for a few minutes.

I walked over to the edge of the road to take a leak. “Fuck it.” I jumped up and down to try and get the blood flowing out of my head, my camelback hit the small of my back in sync. I don’t think I can fully explain how entirely and completely mentally and physically drained I felt. I smacked the right handguard partially back into position and hit the ignition switch. “Fuck it.”

After that lap I did some mental math and determined that I had two laps to go. I slowed the fuck down. No gas on the downhills. Just focus on looking ahead. These laps were slow, but went surprisingly well. I worked through (what I thought) was the final lap like a series of set-piece obstacles. “Okay, I’m through the first MX section, only three singletrack sections, the trophy truck track, and one more MX section to go”. Relief washed over me with each section completed.

There were three tabletops coming into the finish. As I came over the final one I saw a white flag. “NO… NO NO NO,” I thought. I scanned for my SO in the group of maybe 50+ spectators and off-rotation riders waiting near the finish. “I’m not done?” I yelled. “One more lap,” she yelled back. “OH FUCK ME.. FUCKIN’ A.. BULLSHIT.” My SO ran to the end of the pits to meet me at the entrance of the course. As she ran around a camper, I saw her face. She looked worried. She gave me a thumbs up that looked more like a question than a sign of encouragement. I gave the okay sign.

[Again. “Fuck it.”](https://imgur.com/EcUTHW8)"
motorcycles,fpb7txb,t3_gcgkx2,1588463956.0,"**Part 3: Raceday…**

I slept restlessly, but loading and unloading the bike, driving, etc. had me exhausted enough to get at least a few hours of sleep. I wake up to the ring-ding-ding of a 2T pitbike around 6:30am. I have breakfast, fill my camelback, and explain to my SO how to fill the bike with gas, fill my camelback, etc. The morning is a bit of a preoccupied blur. We decide that I will do bike-related tasks during pitstops and she will clean my glasses, force me to eat, and fill my camelback. It’s a plan. I put on my riding gear sans boots and jersey.

We are called to the 8am rider’s meeting over the loudspeaker. The Ironman class traditionally starts from the back, but the class is so large this year and has so many fast riders that they are moving Ironman to the third row (or second, I can’t quite remember). Fuck me…

The rider’s meeting ends, and we have only a few minutes until race start. I run back to the car and throw my boots and jersey on. In a cloud of nerves I nearly forget to put my helmet on.

I ride over to the starting line. I couldn’t hear the mic well during the riders meeting and don’t really know where to go. It’s hard to navigate the folks impounding bikes, families, next-leg-riders, and mechanics milling about, each with their own agendas that diverge from mine. [I find my spot near the end of what I assume is the Ironman row.](https://imgur.com/7zB8uZH) “Ironman?” I ask the guy next to me. “Yea I hope so,” he says.

The group in front of us launches. I watch them climb the banked turn and weave in and out of view. You can hear rev-limiters as bikes launch in the air and the doppler-affected BRAAAAAAAAP of bikes climbing Mt. St. Helen. This is probably a good time to explain that I had never ridden an MX track. I raced timekeeping enduros and the occasional hare scramble in high school, but no track time. I am hyperaware of this at the start.

The race starter explains the start procedure to our row. Keep the bike running, point to the sky, and go when the flag drops. Simple enough. I make the decision to sandbag the start to avoid a first turn collision. In hindsight this was a bad decision because you end up at the back of the eventual bottleneck.

Lost in thought I hear revs climb and hold my hand up. The flag drops…

I remember trying to be hyperaware of riders around me over the first few turns. Not knowing the track and not knowing how to ride a track in the first place, I don’t want to take someone out. The grip on the track is OUTSTANDING. I gain a slight bit of confidence.

We climb Mt. St. Helens, an undulating absolutely enormous climb, and make a sudden right turn at the top. Ahead I can see a massive cloud of dust and some riders stopped at the bottom of a climb. I make the split-second decision to stop as well and notice through the dust that there are 4-5 people stuck on the climb spinning their wheels. The climb doesn’t look bad at all, so I assume one rider fell, and another because of that, and another, and so on. More riders stop behind me. After a few moments a few people start to go, but no one in front of me takes off. “If this isn’t a queue I might as well go eh?” I thought. I look over my shoulder, drop the clutch hard to make it clear that it is MY TURN, and blast through the dust.

[On to the next obstacle…](https://imgur.com/nyI9Y79)



**Part 4: Settling in…**

It took me a few laps to learn how to ride the MX track. You have to manhandle the bike or ruts will buck you out of line. For these first few laps I try to take it easy, there are SIX hours to go. I find that I can make up a lot of time in the technical singletrack but lose it all as soon as we hit the open track. I make a goal to make an in-class pass on the track by hour 3.

I finish the first lap in 30th position (out of ~40 in the class). I start to settle in around lab 3. The singletrack sections are slippery and wallow-ey and you’re often forced off-line by stuck and crashed riders. Some of the descents take us down gulleys that are barely wide enough for a bike. Standing and leaning very far back seems to help keep the front from diving, but that seems to take more energy. It’s a constant battle between riding just relaxed enough to conserve energy but just fast enough to stay focused.

I had my first pitstop around lap 5. The folks next to us helped gas my bike as I adjusted the handguards and levers (too high). My SO waved GUs (little packets of sugar and electrolytes) and Gatorade in front of me. I ate as much as I could, swapped out my glasses (dirt sticks to the sweat that drops off my face onto the lenses). “You’re doing great bud!” “I feel good.”

[And the laps ticked on by](https://imgur.com/HNbGdwH), slowly getting more tired, but steadily making up positions. By lap 5 I had made up 8 positions and was in 22nd.

Every subsequent time I came through the pits a new group of people was helping me gas up, refill my camelback bladder, and cram food in my mouth. I was so out of it that I don’t remember any of their names, but my god THANK YOU. It was humbling to see folks from all over the pits all huddling around my tiny little team. People were tracking me on the live tracker updating me with lap times and positions. During my final stop a guy grabbed my goggles off my helmet and cleaned them for me. I hadn’t even realized how dirty they were."

UCSantaBarbara,fnp8u0q,t3_g343gw,1587141250.0,"I've been teaching for a while now (5+ years) both at UCSB and elsewhere. 

I work really hard to try to make sure my students have a positive experience whatever their aptitude or interest level. That takes a lot of time and effort, but I *love* doing it. It's so rewarding to meet a student as a freshman and see them grow and become more confident each year. 

I think I have a pretty thick skin, but this kind of thing still gets to me. Maybe once a year I get a really hateful or personal comment in reviews. It's very hard to not take it personally and it makes me feel like I'm wasting my time. This quarter has been a lot worse. It's hard to connect with students virtually and lecturing to a room full of black screens just isn't nearly as fun as even the least engaged classes. The anonymity of the whole online experience has made rude and intentionally-hurtful behavior semi-normal. I think there is a vocal minority of students that don't understand that they need to bring their in-class mentality online (and not the other way around). This quarter has been a scramble and my workload has probably doubled, which doesn't help. I know the online experience doesn't match up to the in-person experience for students either. It feels like running a marathon in cinder-blocks.

Either way, I'm glad to be teaching... but I'll be super glad when we finally get back to the classroom."

Unless you're working with spectroscopic data (which maybe is the case if you're using aerial data) or huge volumes of data you simply won't benefit a whole lot from extra processing power and certainly not from the GPU. 

Maybe I'm biased, but I always tell people to avoid buying a big, powerful, ""future-proofed"" laptop. Spend the money you save on a hard drive dock and a few 4tb+ drives (as scratch disks and backup disks)."

I commuted on street legal dirt bikes when I was in college. It probably didn't end up being any cheaper in the long run.
