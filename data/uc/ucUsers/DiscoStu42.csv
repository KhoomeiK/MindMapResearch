UCI,fp6dn58,t1_fp63qlu,1588350537.0,"The best instructors that I've had have been Thornton, Pattis and Wong-Ma. The only one who I would really recommend avoiding is Hermans. Ibrahim is mediocre, but it's not *too* bad if you end up in a class with him."
UCI,fokr7ex,t1_foj3mfx,1587847391.0,Glad to help
UCI,foiskg2,t3_g7okaz,1587795639.0,"I'm a CS major at UCI and I really love it here. Classes tend to be well organized and will teach you CS very thoroughly if you are willing to put in the necessary work. From what I've seen, career opportunities are very good. I'm a second-year and I was able to find a software engineering internship with no prior experience without too much difficulty.

As far as the social scene goes, there is a wide variety of types of people you can interact with. Most people are pretty chill and laid back socially, but you definitely still get some people who like to party on Wednesdays. Everyone is fairly nice and friendly, so I wouldn't worry about meeting people and making friends."
UCI,fo5nrux,t1_fo5h3zf,1587530380.0,I constantly feel uncomfortable that there's some midterm that I'm supposed to be taking  that I somehow just didn't hear was happening.
UCI,fo1vp3r,t3_g5328k,1587442566.0,"I am not a business major, but I have taken one business class at UCI. My experience was that you will get an A without much stress if you just do all the work you are assigned, pay attention in lecture, and read the textbook. Definitely one of the easier college courses I've taken."

UCI,fn0dku0,t1_fmyuyu8,1586539986.0,">LA is the HUB of jobs

For tech? That would be the Bay Area. Whether they choose UCI or UCLA, the highest quality internship/job opportunities will not be in the immediate geographical area of the school."
UCI,fmyqowb,t3_fy846o,1586492957.0,"I'm a CS major at UCI and I am very pleased with the program. Classes are rigorous and require effort, but if you put in the work you will get an A and learn a lot. You also have to take fewer general electives than at other schools, which would probably cancel out any extra GE's you need to take because of the honors program. While it is true that UCI does not have the brand name that UCLA does, UCI has been rising rapidly in terms of reputation and prestige in recent years and shows no signs of slowing down.

I definitely recommend UCI, but of course I'm a bit biased :)"
UCI,fmnwxi5,t1_fmn6oni,1586237733.0,Interesting username you got there...
UCI,fmmyypn,t1_fmmgguf,1586214768.0,"Also you need to consider the fact that UCI has been shooting up in the rankings over the last five years, while UCSD has been mostly stagnant for a long time."
