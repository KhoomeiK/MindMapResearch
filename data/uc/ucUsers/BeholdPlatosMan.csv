Look at the social policies set in place by Capitalist countries, the U.S. and Britain being primary, and how they've handled the Covid-19 crisis. Now look at the way countries whose government is based on Socialist policies have handled the Covid-19 crisis. Vietnam, to the best of my knowledge, has no deaths. According to the WHO, the DPRK has no Covid-19 related deaths. Hell, look at New Zealand, while still a Capitalist based country, they have enough social policies and safety nets for their population to have successfully combated this crisis.

The U.S., regardless if it's Biden or Trump, will absolutely continue it's slide towards the right. I challenge you to look at Biden's political history, voting record and speeches and come away feeling confident Biden can not only stop our country's slide towards fascism, but reverse it."
