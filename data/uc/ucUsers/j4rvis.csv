UCSD,fn5amjr,t1_fn598zo,1586659976.0,"Yeah, it probably takes some learning to get it working, but I have one professor who got it to work just fine. Sounds like the TA didn't do a trial run beforehand?"
UCSD,fkthz2k,t3_fkkz4a,1584520662.0,"I feel like the sentence “UC San Diego has shown a lack of concern and complete disregard for student health” is a bit of an exaggeration, though. Finals are all remote, next quarter is entirely remote, the bathrooms seem to be better maintained(?), people in leadership positions are hosting webinars, to name a few. To be fair to them- they’ve gotta deal with maintaining a physical school for remote students; it makes no sense. Like, what do you do with all the employees you have to maintain a physical place that isn’t being used? 

That said, it seems like the administrators are dragging their feet and deferring their decisions to what other schools do first. I’d love to see some thought leadership by them. We’re a top tier school, let’s act like it folks."
