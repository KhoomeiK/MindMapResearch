2010 had everyone choosing the Rangers except one guy. Someone wrote lol on all the other dudes and love you on the one guy that picked us. 

2012 had double check marks next to Detroit’s pitching and more check marks for them in their advantage. That one cracks me up as well."

Costco,foysumg,t1_foyselx,1588178539.0,"Perhaps it could be edited to say ""face covering, ensuring the nose and mouth is covered"" (especially for those who wear masks incorrectly) could be provided for clarity, but Costco or any other retailer is not obligated to provide a mask for customers to enter the facility.

I mean we've all seen the people of walmart photos, where technically people are wearing shirts and shoes, but they are uh... minimal."

there are other expenses students may not revealing they are charged. Office space? How much was spent on supplies? Did it go into overhead the university charges all programs? Due to how much was used and at the point of the year you are at, I get the feeling it’s staff salary and overhead charges."

I was also frustrated looking at some of the artistic interpretation scores on scoresheets one year, trying to figure out Bradie Tennell and Mirai Nagasu's scores. That was crap - no way Tennell should be outscoring Nagasu on artistry but that was the only way to reward her for her consistency. I argue to the death Lysacek vs Plushenko in 2010, but the scores at least backed me up there."

Dear Valued Annual Passholder,  


This is a truly unprecedented time for all of us, and we want to thank you for your patience as we work through the many details related to the temporary closure of the theme parks. We recognize this may be a challenging time, so we wanted to share how we will assist our Annual Passholders.  


Active Disneyland Resort Annual Passholders who have paid for their Passports in full will automatically have their Passport expiration date extended due to theme park closures to provide additional access opportunities at the end of the Passport term. The new expiration date will be reflected on the Annual Passholder’s Passport account prior to the reopening of the theme parks.  


As an alternative, in lieu of an extension of their Passports, Passholders who have paid in full may choose to receive a partial refund for the theme park closure period. Information will be provided soon on how to choose this option.  


Annual Passholders are some of our most loyal guests, and we stand ready to help during this incredibly uncertain time. If you have any questions, please contact Annual Passholder Member Services at (714) 781-7277. We do anticipate heavy call volume and appreciate your patience as we answer all inquiries."
