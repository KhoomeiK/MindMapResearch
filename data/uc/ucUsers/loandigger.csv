AskReddit,fnu9c55,t3_g3omlt,1587257224.0,"Chinese downhill. Friends and relatives are flown to my favorite Vermont ski resort, lodging, lift tickets and equipment included. They meet at the top of the mountain and all toss down a shot of bourbon in my memory. At the bottom of the hill at the lodge is a briefcase with $100,000 cash in it, the remaining proceeds from my life insurance policy. Everyone lines up and the whistle blows.  No teams, no rules, no holding back. First one down the mountain gets it all. Not your typical Judeo-Christian memorial, but I imagine those who were there would talk about that day for the remainder of their days."
bestoflegaladvice,fnbrfnk,t3_g0ha0c,1586820840.0,"Banks buy and sell individual mortgages from each other all the time and the clearinghouse for keeping track of who owns which mortgage is known as MERS. Many, many mortgage banks went under right around 2008 and it is very possible the ""owner"" of your mortgage simply went under or lost the data and paperwork that would allow them to assert first lien rights to your property. Since you have been ""openly and notoriously"" living in the home for 12 years, you have a very good chance of having an uncontested decision of ownership granted to you. Lawyer up and get your house declared yours."
