I think I was lucky enough to be clear enough about what’s around me but that does not take away from the hole that I feel I’m in getting deeper each day my issues remain. I like that you asked about a therapist. I have one and it  was long overdue when I did because it was like I finally had someone to talk to that wasn’t full from a base of narcissism and craziness. Thanks again for your response, it means a lot to me"

Take a walk, go see a friend and wear masks and don’t touch. Honestly, if I didn’t have a dog park to go to in the morning I would actually in the darkest place of my life. Extrovert struggle. Best wishes!"

It also uses a project structure that relies heavily on tree formation, interface/inheritance, and recursion. It’s a must take imo but I would suggest doing it with a solid partner"
