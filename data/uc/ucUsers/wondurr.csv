GrowingMarijuana,fpkb5c5,t1_fpjyc2p,1588691451.0,You can definitely train it to be against a fence just do some research on lst and tying down branches. You can really do anything you want with one of these plants as you can see in OPs picture
microgrowery,fph1nwh,t3_gdcl9p,1588613388.0,How good of a job the grower did constitutes quality of weed btw
UCSC,fpecrkh,t1_fpdkdxd,1588544945.0,"34,000 people died in the US from influenza 2018-2019, and so far weâ€™ve reached that number in a couple of months... if we kept that same rate it would be 6x more worse than influenza"
cannabiscultivation,fpd46ze,t1_fpchgsn,1588519475.0,If itâ€™s not getting meaningful light then pull the plant but if itâ€™s still getting a solid 12/12 then Leave it out as long as possible.
UCSC,fpblabz,t1_fpasp6n,1588472632.0,"How can you fight for liberty and freedom but simply put to the side 35k US deaths and 200,000+ deaths outside of the us? And if we resumed our normal lives more people would die for no reason."
cannabiscultivation,fp50ngi,t3_gbadv9,1588312599.0,Dope!
cannabiscultivation,fp296yw,t3_gawos7,1588257609.0,"Organic amended soil, outdoor bag seed, about 3-4 weeks into the grow. Using dr earth pot of gold plant food. Amended with coffee grounds on top of the pot.. this is happening to all 3 of my plants all the same age"
cannabiscultivation,fozjbek,t3_gafc3t,1588191619.0,Dope!! I hope my bag seed comes out like this
cannabiscultivation,fozj1yr,t1_fozbts3,1588191492.0,Yea and low quality picture this shouldnâ€™t be here
UCSC,fozie3b,t3_ga13rd,1588191170.0,"How can our university even allow this?  Seriously every student should refuse to use proctorU and send an email to heads of their department, Professor, etc until the school denounces proctoru"
cannabiscultivation,fotas1u,t1_fota5o7,1588048744.0,Not if you donâ€™t transplant it into a bigger pot with more soil asap. Look up transplanting from red solo cup on YouTube if you need a tutorial
GrowingMarijuana,fosp5u2,t3_g9cqtr,1588035178.0,Iâ€™m not sure what the issue is but you have to check every day to prevent these things from happening
cannabiscultivation,fosfxa3,t1_fos9oqo,1588029931.0,So if your temp is right how are you supposed to adjust humidity? I watched the video and I didnâ€™t see the translation to cannabis
cannabiscultivation,fos7hhe,t1_forv04h,1588025361.0,I have to disagree greatly. I didnâ€™t use a dehumidifier when drying and lost all the smell profile of my buds last harvest. Temp and humidity are insanely important when drying
cannabiscultivation,forqbo6,t1_forpzbp,1588016630.0,You need a humidity meter to keep humidity at the right point during the entire drying period. A dehumidifier would help as well
cannabiscultivation,fonvkvh,t1_fonuyeu,1587927324.0,If it consistently goes above 20C in the days then you should be fine. I would usually get about 4-5C at night which gave the plant some really beautiful purple leaves. But like I said this will really slow down the growth process. My first plant last season was a photo that took 6 months from seed to harvest. So It would be unfortunate for you to grow a photo just for it to get too cold eventually. But please try! Try at least a photo and an auto I promise you will learn a lot.
cannabiscultivation,fonv0nl,t3_g87cg4,1587927001.0,I donâ€™t see any balls just pre flowers I think thatâ€™s female
cannabiscultivation,fonuw3e,t1_fomya0z,1587926932.0,Definitely outdoor
cannabiscultivation,fonu0pq,t1_fontpj3,1587926443.0,"Yep, and honestly a plant will definitely survive cold nights as long as the daytime brings warmth. Growth gets slowed a lot if the plant has to spend all day at 50F or lower"
cannabiscultivation,fontj6s,t3_g8gzg9,1587926173.0,Root bound
cannabiscultivation,fontbpj,t1_fonqu6n,1587926056.0,"I donâ€™t know how successful you will be trying to control light outdoors, but if itâ€™s gonna be too cold (under 40 F) when itâ€™s naturally 12/12 then youâ€™re definitely gonna want to plant an auto"

cannabiscultivation,fol2src,t1_fokhxn7,1587853763.0,Yep kill all butterflies and moths
cannabiscultivation,foif7pv,t1_foi04zc,1587785249.0,Hell yea every grow is just another opportunity to learn and grow as a grower!
cannabiscultivation,foho1vc,t1_fofixeb,1587769302.0,Yea this grow space just seems like so much potential
cannabiscultivation,fodjd5w,t1_foddefv,1587685418.0,"I couldnâ€™t tell if your growing outdoors or indoors. Iâ€™ve never seen anyone use a humidity dome. If your plants are getting burned by the sunlight then theyâ€™re actually getting burnt by the temperature I donâ€™t think the sunlight is doing that. For example if you live in a place where temps are gonna be above 90 often those arenâ€™t ideal conditions for a plant, around 70-80 is good temps. The reason you donâ€™t use humidity dome is because the plant needs plenty of oxygen to grow. For an indoor setup this means plenty of fans to keep air circulation but for outdoors itâ€™s not something you have to worry about as long as the grow space isnâ€™t in a spot where thereâ€™s no wind. Idk what you mean by keep them clean but outdoors plants are gonna get dirty from pests and other debris you canâ€™t stop that. Indoor grows are usually controlled with no pests no hairs nothing and indoor is the only way you can truly keep the environment perfect"
trees,fodghag,t3_g6sovx,1587684388.0,But itâ€™s just a flower
cannabiscultivation,fo87s9h,t3_g672m8,1587591442.0,I see preflowers just wait
cannabiscultivation,fo87dqd,t3_g684p8,1587591230.0,I had the same experience during flower but you might want to look up whatâ€™s causing the brown spots on the leaves

cannabiscultivation,fo718tp,t1_fo714r7,1587570462.0,Yea it looks very possible if you check out my page I grew a smaller plant and still got almost 4oz I think heâ€™s got it
cannabiscultivation,fo710f8,t1_fo6dwnv,1587570342.0,I would put money down that heâ€™s gonna get a pound off that
