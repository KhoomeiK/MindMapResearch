ucla,fonhxr7,t1_fomc7ni,1587919830.0,Yeah but then I would have had Felker as my first ever chem professor here and that would be a pretty terrible introduction
ucla,fonhv36,t1_fonchf6,1587919788.0,I took it last quarter and didn't think it was all that hard tbh. Definitely sounds like it's a lot easier than it used to be.
ucla,fo6osl9,t3_g5spkr,1587563765.0,The real question is if you’re taking it with Eggert or not because that affects the level of difficulty by a few orders of magnitude
ucla,fip2bt7,t1_fiov5ol,1582596458.0,Several of my professors lately have been using https://onlinepoll.ucla.edu/ which is a pretty solid (and free) replacement for clickers
