Unless you can work out a payment plan with them in exchange for housing or possibly share an apartment with some friends who already rent a unit, you can try to figure something out. Have faith and something will come up, you just need to do your part. Fingers crossed, I send you well wishes!"
ucr,fp0gbty,t3_ga7ziw,1588208709.0,"Others have already answered your question but yeah this is def a good way to reset yourself in college. It’s sucks but some students switch majors even into their 2nd and 3rd years, but going cc gives you more lee way to figure yourself out and plan out the rest of your college career. Maybe other students will see your post and do something similar. Good luck and take care Cx"

ucr,fon0kzo,t3_g8a289,1587909334.0,"The best we can do is change our studying habits and try learning different ways and improve memory retention. We have to get creative with who and how we study so we can overcome these obstacles. Don’t beat yourself up over this, we’re all struggling with the same problems. We’ll figure this out together too
Good luck!"

Unless UCI bus admin major but not much to do out there 
Fullerton is nice college city 
Lots to do at night and chill"
ucr,fnwzrkh,t1_fnt9vil,1587328666.0,"Lol nvmnd then, and I love how I got like -12 votes xD 
Anyway yeah I would argue CSU over UC, not necessarily CSULB over UCR lol
But def pick a place where you will study in an environment you will learn best. Hard to make that call for a UC bcuz you will def have some debt leaving college, and you also want a college experience, not just the educational aspect. So, if you have other options, look into their programs, otherwise, I’ll see you somewhere on campus lol"
ucr,fnt6mfs,t3_g3r2gc,1587235620.0,"Broooo! CSULB hands down, much better college experience lol, don’t stress about the major. Visit both campuses and you’ll know instantly which college you would like to attend for the next few years lol
Look at the surrounding area and what there is to do, and other activities you can get involved with. Also, CSULB is great campus not sure why there’s so much baggage on CS major, at least not that I was aware of much to begin with. Anyway what are your priorities and also, do you value the college experience you will have? If so, then after doing some research, you’ll come to a conclusion that you’ll feel right at heart. Seeing as you’ve become conflicted because of hearing negative things about CSULB, your decision was compromised lol, we already have your answer. Just check some things out and you’ll reaffirm your answer. Good luck!"
ucr,fnkda24,t3_g1zza8,1587022799.0,"No no, that’s ridiculous. Nothing like pressing Start, Select, A+B, and sometimes LT+RT all at the same time on a Game Boy Advance. Also you can have the monitor set to have same screen as your first monitor, or become an extended screen display. It’s definitely a smart idea to use one screen for taking the exam and using the other one to go through notes and whatnot. Good luck!"

ucr,fn77bfa,t1_fn5marb,1586714690.0,"Welcome to UCR! Lol
You’ll be fine. Things have gotten better, but the road ahead is definitely something to consider. Tread carefully. Be mindful of yourself and those around you. Be aware of your surroundings and make smart/safe decisions. Also, make a few friends that live nearby or local to campus/riverside. It’s usually nice to be able to reach out to others in urgent situations for help. I hope you have a wonderful experience here at UCR Cx"
ucr,fn76x7p,t1_fn5mpse,1586714469.0,"Yes, the campus itself overall in top 10 (7th if I remember correctly) for public schools nationwide. It’s programs are top notch and great reputations, however, it’s extremely competitive there. Whether it’s an on campus or off campus job or internship, more than likely you won’t find anything to build yourself on, skills, experience, etc. networking will be alright, but nothing that does much to set up students for employment right after graduating. Here’s the thing. You’re going to learn the same content, all the same material for that degree or field of study at any other school. It’s the same degree, it’s just a different study environment. UC is intense, like nearly no social life, not a party college even with the frats, and not much time for yourself. Uci is more academically vigorous than UCR and most other California colleges. Seriously, it’d not worth the stress or health sacrifices you will make. These next few years of growth will impact you for the rest of your life. Education can be attained anywhere. Pick a place you will most be comfortable and enjoy yourself. Actually live the pleasant college experience. You will struggle, but not suffer mental, physical, emotional, physiological problems because of how absurd school study has become. Just like how income has been stagnant for economy and yet cost of education has been ever increasing. It’s unsustainable BS you will learn about. It’s not worth so much of our income when we haven’t had proportional increases. Don’t focus on the college you attend, focus on yourself and what you want to do with your time and studies. I much prefer CSU over UC. Your degree doesn’t matter so much where it’s from. At least for the most part. There is credit to it but unless it’s something particular, majority of degrees have little impact on your future after college. You have a degree, you’ll find employment, more likely in something different than what you studied for. But even with a BA, unemployment is crazy and getting worse because of COVID and very soon the recession. So, don’t make things harder for yourself. Think through this carefully. Select your best value for experience college. You’ll look back either with appreciation or resentment or something similar for your college. Look at it with the bigger picture in mind, you’ll realize that simple things in life have more meaning and make more sense than pursuing complicated, compromising things. I’ve rambled a bit, sorry. I can clarify whatever it is you may inquire about. Take care."
ucr,fn4rk6a,t3_fxe9m5,1586647433.0,"If you look up the stats, it’s not really a safe place to live, and I would def be concerned about taking measures to ensure safety while traveling around Riverside area. UCSC is by far a better choice and the financial aid packages are practically the same since you would receive similar packages. Don’t focus too much on trying to be close to home but rather your college experience and life in college. Do you plan to visit home frequently or not so often? College is an experience where you grow and become independent to an extent that prepares you to be on your own after college, although you may return home after college too but there’s nothing bad or wrong with that. So, reevaluate your reasons for choosing which college to attend, and you should already know where to attend. Just be honest with yourself and the rest comes easy. Also, I recommend learning some self-defense, take up a martial art class that actually practices self-defense and is not about competing or point based systems. Learn how to fight and how to fight well. It’s one of our most basic survival tools and the majority of us have no training or experience. Do yourself a favor, learn how to protect yourself. Walking around with Confidence is more assuring than walking around with fear or concern for your safety. It’s normal to a degree, but not as much when you have training and can protect yourself. You’ll be fine. Take care."

ucr,fn4pme7,t1_fn4pg1a,1586646257.0,"Don’t do CC and transfer after. Don’t do that to yourself or deprive yourself of the college experience and have that disadvantage when you transfer and play catch up with social life and networking. Most of your momentum starts your freshman and sophomore year. So, avoid CC, go all university : )"
ucr,fn4pg1a,t3_fyjizh,1586646148.0,"I’ll tell you right now, UCR is not the place for networking or prepping for after college. CSUF you will definitely have a social life, it’s a college city, plenty of things to do and night life is absolutely wonderful. UCI sucks, maybe more to do than UCR, except you’ll have no time or life for much, but their business school is great, except finding work afterwards will be just as difficult because networking is not much stronger so I would advise against both UCI and UCR. Really, I would say go with a CSU over a UC because you can enjoy yourself, your studies, and prepare for a future with more confidence. I suggest CSULB, great college that has strong emphasis for networking and internships. They have the College of Business Administration school specifically for business majors and a couple entities for students and grad students/alumni to network and help find employment. I would largely pick CSULB over all the other options in SoCal for UC/CSU, while CSU are generally a better overall college experience than UC. Let me know if you have any further inquiries and I will address them to the best of my ability. Good luck!"
ucr,fkk1m59,t3_fiy1z2,1584269688.0,"if you sincerely care about having the experience of walking rather than graduating, you can just have a family thing with friends and whatnot, i understand pride, but i also know that people invest too much care into the graduation ceremony when its not all that, in fact most of the time you'll be waiting to get it over with, similar to high school. what you will remember is after the ceremony. you will have a great time with friends and family, celebrating, eating, having a blast. the ceremony is just memories that most people record because they forget about it and it doesn't hold as much importance as they initially placed. yeah yeah, wanting to graduate with friends and have people come watch, i get it. 95% of students are like that so, my condolences, just remember the ceremony isnt actually the graduation itself, you dont need the ceremony to receive your degree, or to confirm you have completed college. what is important is that you made it and will have earned your degree with or without doing the ceremony. something will probably come up later anyway so dont beat yourself up so much so quick. enjoy what lies before you and you will see greater gifts than what you desire."
