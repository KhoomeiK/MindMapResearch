Target,fn5yg3g,t1_fn5xi7k,1586680410.0,"Thank you for trying your best. As a new hire, I could tell when someone was trying and deeply appreciated it. All I want to suggest to you for the next time you're in charge of training to please not assume someone knows anything. We can bear to hear something twice if it means being told everything once."
Target,fn5y8xk,t1_fn5xu61,1586680202.0,It's so unfortunate. I have never worked for a company where you have to just figure it out on your own. My scheduled fulfillment trainer flat out said he didn't want to train me and walked away. The employee culture (at least at my store) is horrific.
Target,fmyc0sa,t1_fmxdiov,1586482676.0,Very interesting. I'll look into it further and ask around. Thanks!
Target,fmyby8r,t1_fmx7k93,1586482629.0,Good to know. I will see if this is reflected on my first paycheck and ask my peers. Seems unfair that I wouldn't get the increase as I'm dealing with the same amount of public interaction/exposure

For a month she stayed ""bloated"" and I believe the notion that it was a fast growing tumor was correct. She ate very little for weeks. Five doses of prazipro and raised temp did nothing, so likely not a parasite. I ended up choosing to end her suffering with clove oil when she showed the first signs of raised scales."
