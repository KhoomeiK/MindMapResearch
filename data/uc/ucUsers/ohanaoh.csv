berkeley,fllkq7g,t3_e6zc7f,1585262280.0,"Hey everyone! Just got admitted to Cal for econ, and I'm looking to potentially pursue a per-med pathway. Can anyone give advice on the professors, which classes to take/avoid, and how lenient course selection is? And is it difficult to swap majors within L&S? Thank you!"
