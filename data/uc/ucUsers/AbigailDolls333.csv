I really want to ask some of the professors in the department of my major (physiological sciences) but I’m scared and unsure if it’s even allowed? It was what we did at my old UC (the research portal there was really bad, and everything was out-of-date). However I’m unsure if it’s different here."

I have a distant memory of once after school in kindergarten, he came to pick me up and I refused to go with him, I said “I want mommy to pick me up”. He ended up leaving and my mom came later after work (he was a lazy ass with no job). Good thing though that you are separated from him so your kids don’t have to be forced to live with someone they grow to hate. I HATE my father and want him to rot in hell. I certainly hope your daughter doesn’t grow to have such vile hatred like mine, but the hatred escalated for me throughout the years. It is ok though and completely valid for her to not like him or miss him! My mom is an idiot for making me have to deal with physical abuse for 18 years and not doing anything about it to help me. Anyway, I wish you and your kids the best."
