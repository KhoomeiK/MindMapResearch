discworld,fp61p69,t1_fp5tnrf,1588344395.0,"Idk about the critic bit, but the quote ""Those who can't do, teach"" is a complete bastardization of a quote from Aristotle. He said ""Those who can, do. Those who know, teach"" which is supposed to be illustrative of the in depth understanding required to effectively teach something to someone else. America (and possibly elsewhere, I don't know) has completely inverted the meaning of the quote, to devalue educators. It's a pet peeve of mine."
AmItheAsshole,fox8cvp,t1_fowxpvl,1588136631.0,"I'm not talking about teaching rules, I'm talking about impulse control. From a neurological perspective, impulses involved in emotional responses to situations are not something the average 2 year old can control. Hence the terrible twos, tantrums, etc. Those are part of the process of developing impulse control and tamping down the emotional responses that kids experience. Kids are raw emotion, and they can't be expected to act rationally at that age."

AmItheAsshole,fovh47h,t1_fov82h3,1588101219.0,"The likelihood of forming distinct long-term memories at 2 years old is pretty low. I'm not a development specialist so I don't want to say impossible, but pretty much. Not only that, but any memory from early childhood is going to be from the point of view of the child, which is not going to be accurate. For example this child, if they could have discussed the incident, would be unlikely to view this as ""grabbing "" or acting out. They would just think ""I want this"" and then ""this thing hurt me"", they don't have the same kinds of thought processes as older kids and adults. There's a pretty dramatic shift in how the brain works around this age."
AmItheAsshole,fov6xan,t1_fouyw9e,1588096371.0,"Are you kidding me? You can't parent a 2 yr old to not grab stuff. Their brain is not developed enough to allow them to curb their impulses most of the time, or even at all. Seems like you probably haven't been around kids much. The way one would effectively parent is to mitigate risks as much as is reasonable. Using a travel mug is a reasonable suggestion to avoid this *accident* in the future."

pitbulls,fo55kah,t1_fo4basx,1587517983.0,"I'm basing my comment off what your title/post said, which is that ""it's hard to hold her back"". I interpreted that as you are struggling to hold her, which to me means that you are on the verge of losing control of her.


I'm glad you have a trainer because training is really the only way to improve a circumstance like leash aggression. Your post did not say that, so I didn't know it when I wrote my comment. My advice and opinion is unchanged. You should not rely on a leash or a harness if she is aggressive and hard to control. You need a muzzle. I'm sorry if you're offended by my opinion, but it is what it is. Part of owning a bully breed is understanding what is necessary to control them. If she's aggressive, for her protection and that of other dogs, she needs to be muzzled. If it was any other dog breed I would say the same thing. I love pitbulls and I have had them all my life. They are fantastic dogs.


EDIT: 
>The leash doesn't make him look intimidating as a muzzle would.


>However, most dogs she does go after very aggressively but we have stopped her before she has ever bit any of them. So yes she is dog aggressive


Sorry if I'm blunt, I have a hard time being any other way. I'm basing this in part on what you say, and also on how I've seen other pittie owners act. And maybe I'm off base here, if so feel free to ignore me.

 It seems from your comments that you care a lot about how your dog ""looks""/how she and you are perceived. Like, how people might be judging you for having an aggressive dog. I get that, a lot of people make unfair assumptions about pitties because the breed has a bad reputation. But you need to face how your dog really is, regardless of how people will judge her/you. Not muzzling an aggressive dog is setting her up for failure. Maybe people are scared of the muzzle. That's good, they'll give you a wide berth when you're walking her. You need to treat your dog as she is now, not based on how you want her to be seen/perceived."
pitbulls,fo47ynn,t1_fo3hzgm,1587499746.0,"We use a gentle leader as well and it has helped, but it is no replacement for training. AND it will not solve leash aggression. You need to have training with a professional to address this. This may be an unpopular opinion here, but I think its incredibly irresponsible for you to take a leash-aggressive dog that is too big for you to control out on walks where you know you will encounter other dogs. If he breaks loose and hurts another dog or person, he could be put down. Maybe your description made this seem worse than it is, but it sounds like he's on the verge of attacking other dogs. You need a **muzzle**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit to add: Gentle leaders can be tough to fit correctly to pitbulls because their mouths are so big. If you don't fit the gentle leader correctly, there's a serious chance the dog will escape it. This would result in either choking the dog, or the dog literally escaping your restraint. So I strongly suggest you combine this leader with a muzzle."
RATS,fo0yq4e,t3_g4rkf4,1587422313.0,"Hey OP I hope everything turns out OK for your little guy. FYI, when I had an emergency with an exotic I took him to a normal emergency 24 hr vet. They say they don't treat exotics but if you bring it there, they'll examine him. They might not be trained in surgery for your rat, but they can do basic diagnostic testing and get the processes moving. (I hate saying this, but if the situation is dire, they can also put him to sleep, so at least he wouldn't suffer)"
turtle,fo0p66d,t3_g50s80,1587417191.0,"Turtles are expensive and labor intensive to keep. They require a large aquarium, usually 55ga is the minimum, the rule being 10ga per 1in shell length. They're very messy eaters and poopers, so the filtration required for a tank for them is almost always going to be some type of canister filter, often people run multiple filters on one tank. 

&#x200B;

They also make having a ""pretty"" tank impossible (except for some lucky few). My turts will eat or tear up anything that goes in their tank. They co-existed for a bit with some fish but ultimately they ate it :( 

&#x200B;

Be sure that there is an exotic vet near you, and get pricing if you can so you have an idea of what a vet visit might cost you. You need to account for this as well when considering whether to get a turtle. 

&#x200B;

So, in summary, be prepared to spend a lot of time and money on these animals. They're great and I love them, but they are more work than most people expect."
turtle,fo0n72r,t1_fo05x67,1587416146.0,"You took your turtle to the vet, for this reason? Was it an exotics vet? What did the vet say, exactly? You need to add quite a bit more info to your post, like what the turtle's living conditions are (pictures would be good), what they eat/how frequently they eat, how old he/she is, and any other relevant background info.

&#x200B;

As it stands, I agree that the shell is in very bad shape and the animal needs treatment. I disagree with the poster below that says to do iodine baths, I don't think that's enough. But, I have never owned a box turtle specifically. And you should not by antibiotics or anything else over the internet without a vet's prescription."

RATS,fnmoumy,t1_fnmm5wh,1587075353.0,"[Rabies in rodents and lagomorphs in the United States, 1995â€“2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5763497/)

While it is rare, it is not impossible for rodents to have rabies. In fact, the rate of rabies cases in rodents is increasing. That being said, the number of rats that tested positive for rabies is quite low. However the authors note several factors that might cause artificially low observed rates of rabies in rodents. What, in my opinion, is important to note is that there has not been a compelling biological reason to explain why rabies is not more prevalent in rodents, which (again, in my opinion) makes it more likely to be a sampling issue leading to low testing rather than a genuinely low rabies transmission rate in rodents. 

&#x200B;

 

At any rate, I stand by the comment. Its not wise to get in close proximity to wild animals, as they can carry and spread disease. This is of course true of all wild animals, not just rats. I hope that my comment did not come across as unfairly characterizing rats poorly, because I love rats. I think they are great animals and wonderful pets. But I would be wary of interacting with any wild animals, be it feral cats and dogs or wild rats. There's a lot of risk involved in catching and rehabilitating feral/wild animals and it should not be undertaken by someone without specific training."

Especially if you have other pets. Rabies in particular comes to mind, since you seem to be putting your hands in reasonable proximity to the rats themselves. I'd caution you to try to maintain distance if you want to keep feeding these guys. Also there is definitely going to be babies, rats don't go through life in a cushy place without breeding. So at some point, this colony will become too large and someone will have to deal with that. I'm also hoping that you live in a rural area, and that your house/garden is not in close proximity to other houses. Its kind of unsafe and unethical to be feeding wild animals in close proximity to other peoples housing. Teaching animals that humans are safe, when that is not going to be true for all circumstances, is just setting up everyone (animals and humans) for conflict down the line."
