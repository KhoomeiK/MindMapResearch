EnaiRim,fpeeh2v,t1_fp7bm4m,1588545947.0,You canâ€™t start with Mannimarco. When I built my necromancer I made it a pilgrimage search to find his shrine so it was part of my rp :)
NSFWskyrim,fp85wcx,t3_gbqi1b,1588384332.0,Love your work ðŸ’•
memes,fp7lkn2,t1_fp7g75o,1588372928.0,Comment history checks out. This is some high school bullshit
college,fp78o5t,t1_fp77sqr,1588366053.0,"This is really helpful, thanks so much. Iâ€™m planning to take Calc II over the summer so I can focus on that as much as possible. I guess my game plan is/should be to get Aâ€™s in my core and electives and just do as well in math as I can :)"
FeliciaVox,fp76nu8,t1_fp6xrh3,1588365025.0,"I hate using it on my face, it breaks me out. And oh my gosh can I just say that you are so talented and gorgeous and I love your work!"
goatvalleycampgrounds,fp6m063,t3_gbme55,1588354640.0,"My guess is that belief is what marks out the gods. Saint Nick is still worshipped and acknowledged, so he has the status and power of a god, while the rider with the deer (one of the Fae perhaps?) is forgotten as a myth or a story."
aSongOfMemesAndRage,fp6jrmc,t1_fp5epl7,1588353535.0,haha show go brrrrrrr
csMajors,fp1yd10,t1_fp1etwu,1588251077.0,maybe the dude with the porn addiction isnâ€™t the best judge of how men view women ðŸ¤”
berkeley,fp1xndw,t1_foormtu,1588250579.0,Itâ€™s rude to be a creep.
FeliciaVox,fp1sbfz,t1_fozafdv,1588246309.0,"Ah, I see youâ€™ve never worn greasepaint. As an artist who has both worn myself and applied  on others heavy cosplay makeup and theater makeup, theyâ€™re completely different. Theater makeup is intended to be worn under bright, hot stage lighting, and be visible from hundreds of feet away. Up close it looks greasy and harsh. 
Cosplay makeup is all about the closeups- it should look airbrushed, perfect, and detail oriented."
childfree,fp172jn,t3_ga850c,1588226248.0,"He doesnâ€™t sound super aware, but Iâ€™m not sure this is down to malicious intent. If he didnâ€™t mention his kids, itâ€™s probably equally likely that he figured you wouldnâ€™t be interested in caring for/interacting with them and didnâ€™t plan on bringing them into the equation at all."
muacirclejerk,for8es5,t3_g8mn3k,1588007929.0,uj/ youâ€™re so pretty girl!!
NSFWskyrim,fo615ht,t3_g5sowo,1587542632.0,the featureless white background and modern tattoos really make the Skyrim aesthetic
csMajors,fo18xrn,t3_fiuxih,1587428178.0,Late to the party but yeah!!
BDSMAdvice,fnf768j,t1_fndl613,1586902657.0,"Wait, so you would prefer to refer to all doms as he and all subs as she for ease of shorthand? Thatâ€™s pretty actively sexist."
BDSMAdvice,fnf6pg6,t1_fnd1tua,1586902412.0,"Being kinky has little or nothing to do with how het normative one is or isnâ€™t, honestly. The people who are involved in active kink communities are more likely to be woke and left leaning (and poly or geeky), but itâ€™s not a universal rule, and acting as if being kinky makes you better at being woke than other people is just an excuse to self congratulate."
BDSMAdvice,fn8asr4,t1_fn7hmly,1586737549.0,Ew.
dndnext,fn6w48j,t1_fn6jw6k,1586708503.0,I think what theyâ€™re assuming is that OPâ€™s player is taking a bit of advantage of OPâ€™s inexpertise and are explaining in that context what the impact on the game as written would be.
PublicFreakout,fn6uylr,t1_fn6orkf,1586707862.0,"Haha, I think itâ€™s hilarious. (Am American). We are gullible and easily manipulated first world people, if they can exploit it on Twitter that easily it seems like their win, no?"
AskReddit,fn5tt4g,t1_fn5ktfk,1586675643.0,"looked up some shots, she appears to be wearing a full face of foundation, light mascara, and eyebrow stuff."
