WatchPeopleDieInside,fplzmx0,t1_fplhd0w,1588722575.0,"Think of him kind of like Emperor Palpatine pulling strings behind the scenes. He is the most influential person in American politics. He dictates the agenda for not only the Republican Party but the entire senate. He gets to choose what gets addressed when the senate gets together so he can strategically choose not to address actual issues that might cost him politically if addressed and instead bolster his party’s strength by focusing on appointing conservative judges. He protects the Republican Party’s reps from flak through setting the agenda. 

He acts as a black hole of hatred. If there was a bill that was something like “Free money for women and children” and a representative voted no, then they would get huge blow back from their constituents. With Mitch at the head, he can just ignore the bill altogether and no one has to have that controversial vote on their record, and the only person people can blame is Mitch, and that’s assuming they’re even informed enough to know about the law or the political system in the first place. The average person probably doesn’t even know anything happened."
AmItheAsshole,fpllsbp,t3_ge1mql,1588715020.0,"NTA, I remember not caring about 9/11 since I was too young to remember what happened. We would make 9/11 conspiracy jokes and our friends would rib each other about it sometimes (Arab Americans). I’d seen footage of the plane crashing into the building and I was like holy shit, but it didn’t actually make me feel horrified. Then in 8th grade, my teacher showed us a documentary on 9/11, and I saw someone jump off a tower and slowly fall to their death. That clip changed my entire perspective on 9/11, and I don’t take the subject lightly anymore."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpjfozv,t1_fpipr24,1588666782.0,"No, it isn’t. There’s a potential human that could be born there, and you have the choice to either keep it or kill it. I’m not saying abortion is wrong, I’m just saying there is undeniably a little guy who won’t get to see the real world, and that’s tragic. That doesn’t mean I’m anti abortion or anti women or I’m trying to push some kind of agenda with the description. It’s an opinion, and a very wildly held one, that abortions are tragic. Perhaps it’s better than an alternative, but it’s tragic all the same."

unpopularopinion,fp8x8t0,t1_fp7lp0y,1588406200.0,"I’m confused as to what I’m going to do with this gun if it’s not killing or maiming something. The use of blanks could just be replaced by something else that’s loud and threatening. A gun is a tool of self defense maybe, but to call it a tool isn’t true to its purpose. I’m not going to be building a house with a gun."

I won’t like though, people at this school are beautiful, like way more than other places. I’m average looking and I feel out of place here sometimes, but it’s not because of anything anyone says or does. Everyone here is really friendly; it just so happens that a lot of them look amazing."

UCSantaBarbara,fnqxkho,t3_g3el08,1587174425.0,"This may be a hot take but econ is competitive and it feels in line for them to not do pass/no pass. Especially for prereqs in the major where your GPA matters and shows you a preview of how well you will do in the major. I get there are people who have their own struggles working at home, but there’s always gotta be losers."
