berkeley,fopbbvr,t1_fop6x2b,1587957292.0,E29 is a new course they’re offering starting spring 2021 that’s basically a combo of E25 and E27 in one semester for 4 units! It’s in the course catalog!
berkeley,fooy91b,t1_foovspl,1587949011.0,"Agreed I would drop E25 and wait until E29 - other than that it seems like a pretty reasonable schedule- E7 can be a bit tricky, so that might take a bit of time"
berkeley,foiomzn,t3_g7eywy,1587792208.0,"It's because they're changing E25 from the first freshman class to E26 - E25 is being combined with E27 into a new class, E29, so first semester freshman are just going to take 26 first semester now"
berkeley,fog2air,t3_g79y9p,1587746862.0,"This semester, they haven’t been making any accommodations for different times for exams afaik"
berkeley,fo8m32y,t1_fo8kphw,1587599233.0,There should be an IP at the bottom of the webpage!
berkeley,fnsogx5,t1_fnrot5f,1587225735.0,Sure!
berkeley,fnrgbuq,t1_fnr9msj,1587188106.0,Lower divs will be pretty much the same!
berkeley,fnrauvx,t1_fnr89g6,1587183673.0,"Outside of some smaller classes like general english ones (R1A and R1B), you’ll genuinely always get all of the mechE classes you want - I’ve never had any trouble!

Even if a class does fill up quickly, if there’s a lot of demand for it, they’ll open up more sections!

Everyone finishes in four years or less - there’s actually a form you have to fill out if you’re planning on taking longer - no need to worry about graduating on time!

Overall, mechE, the COE, and Cal in general is really responsive towards its students!"
berkeley,fm6f90e,t1_fm6cqe8,1585792753.0,"Cool, thanks!"
