If redirecting the funds from USAC's budget would require ""another referendum"" wouldn't that be just as difficult, but less expensive, as the CUB referendum? A lot of that money is just sitting there, not being used. Couldn't the CUB referendum then have three options? 1) pay $15/a quarter 2) divert funds from pre-existing USAC entities and 3) no CUB at all. I bet if they had a vote like this #2 would win in a landslide (because, despite what USAC likes to say, the majority of people \*want\* these spaces for black, Muslim, and transfer students. We just don't want to pay \*additional\* money when there's already plenty)."

ContraPoints,fgbrey5,t1_fgb0ls2,1580665395.0,Ours have a really funny misprint on them. It says something like “100 years of [whatever company]: 1915-1917” but i think it adds character.
