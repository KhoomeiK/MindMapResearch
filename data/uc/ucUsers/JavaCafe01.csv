unixporn,fpludro,t1_fplrt8q,1588719653.0,"Some programs don't work out of the box, you have to configure them. However, bspwm does come with examples for itself and sxhkd, and the archwiki shows how to use it. Here's the [link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bspwm)."
unixporn,fplrc08,t1_fplr4fz,1588717989.0,"That's how it works, you have to use a hot key demon like sxhkd and map out keys for certain bspwm commands and for things like spawning a terminal. You can also create a config file that autostarts applications like polybar and nitrogen. I recommend looking at the arch wiki for more explanations.

The beauty of bspwm is that there is no special syntax for it's config, it's just a bunch of shell commands."
unixporn,fplqxlj,t3_ge0nw0,1588717771.0,"Hey, just wanted to let you know, I also use a nord theme setup on bspwm, but if you want an even more nordy firefox here's one by dpcdpc11 [here](https://www.deviantart.com/dpcdpc11/art/Nord-for-Firefox-837860916)."
linuxmasterrace,fpdymfo,t1_fpdb5fu,1588536846.0,"Openbox isn't a tiling window manager, it's a floating window manager. But back to your question, I use a tiling window manager for my workflow. It's fast because everything I have is keyboard oriented and it's very minimal compared to a DE.   All it does is handle the windows, it doesn't contain any extra apps or features. I chose bspwm out of others (i3, qtile, etc) because of the way of how it tiles and how simple the config is.


(EDIT)A window manager controls the appearance and placement of windows while a DE has a WM and builds on top of it with extra apps, features, etc."

unixporn,fmvf431,t1_fmv7k5z,1586414813.0,"I've been ricing for around a year or two I think. I first started from Manjaro's standard i3 config, which is pretty amazing by itself. After getting used to it and adding little by little customizations, I took a breath and installed Arch with i3. 

My advice: start with prebuilt configs like Manjaro or Regolith, and get to know how they work (like polybar and rofi). Then, you can get some ideas from scrolling through unixporn and start fresh with your own custom configs."
