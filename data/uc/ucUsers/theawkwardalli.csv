AskWomen,fplmmxn,t3_ge1tsm,1588715469.0,"I had really strong feelings for one of my best guy friends many years ago. I’m a “heart on my sleeve” kind of person, so it was pretty obvious. We would flirt all the time and I was really crazy about him. We would occasionally talk about the tension between us and I’d ask him how he felt about me. He told me he liked me and I was great, but he’s a “free spirit” and we’re too different to date. 

His birthday comes around and he gets incredibly drunk at a party we’re at. I go to leave and he walks me out and kisses me and says “best kiss of your life” all arrogantly. The kiss was honestly a letdown considering all the buildup, plus, his comment was so unattractive. 

A few months pass and there’s another party. I get out the car to start walking to the house and this girl is trying to make a u-turn in the cul-de-sac and is having a hard time. I help guide her and she doesn’t say thank you to me or anything so I head towards the house and out comes my guy friend. Turns out, this was his new girlfriend. I was hurt because he had told me all these years that he “couldn’t date” but he found someone so easily. Truth is, he never really liked me. 

He’s still with her several years later. Our mutual friends don’t like her. I’ve had a couple relationships since then and I’m really glad I didn’t date him."

This quarter demonstrates professors’ abilities to quickly adapt and make appropriate accommodation for students. Universities are naturally progressing to online education anyway... I hope they take our CAPES into consideration! 🤷🏼‍♀️"
UCSD,fpkupwa,t3_gdy576,1588701362.0,Make sure to fill out your CAPES at the end of the quarter! There’s a specific question that asks if the professor starts/finishes on time. Many of my professors have said that their departments actually look at the CAPES and take them seriously!

FemaleDatingStrategy,fp137ki,t3_gafmx5,1588223172.0,"I know a man I used to work with when I was employed by a school district who dated single moms. I think it really depends on the man, honestly. This guy was highkey a predator, which is even more sickening that he worked with youth. He dated moms with disabilities who had children, so......... 

I can’t see why a young man would want to date a single mom, it’s a lot to handle for someone who’s immature. If single moms are a large portion of the dating pool at that age and he is ready to be a parent, that’s fine. If they’re seeking out vulnerability (like my former coworker), it’s problematic"

relationships,fo843go,t1_fo7deue,1587589547.0,I think it’s also important to note that OP should not be playing the role of his mother. He should absolutely be treating her space/belongings with respect and would try to be more mindful if he really cared. It’s not up to her to be “coaching” him to be better—he needs to have the intrinsic motivation to do it himself

He was emotionally abusive and always picked on my appearance. I know he never posted photos of me because he was embarrassed of me. He found someone new after we had been apart for two months (but still sleeping together) and posted photos of her ALL THE TIME."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fo1sfsc,t3_g57omu,1587440435.0,"Did you see the post about a girl finding her boyfriend’s porn folder on his computer where he PHOTOSHOPPED HER (white) FACE ONTO A BLACK PORNSTAR’S BODY?? She admits he has a fetish for black women. People commenting were saying that she should explore the fetish with him and “role-play.” Wouldn’t that be black-face???

I commented saying how incredibly fucking weird it is for him to do that and how he can still distribute these images with her face on them! I’m so shocked that she doesn’t seem nearly as bothered by this as she should be."
relationship_advice,fnyzts5,t3_g4j3xy,1587381716.0,"I’m going to give a different opinion than most commenters I’ve seen so far: if you don’t want to continue this friendship, you have every right to end it. 

I had a friend when I was 19 who started copying me the way your friend is copying you. She and I had only known each other for less than a year, but she latched onto me and I was basically her only friend. Her behaviors were differed from your friend’s in some ways... One time, she and I were walking around the mall and some cute guys passed us. She goes “did you see those guys? They were totally checking ME out.” I let it go because I knew they weren’t checking her out and I just didn’t really care. Another thing she did was always offer up her clothes for me to borrow... mind you, she was probably about 100 lbs heavier than I was. I was irritated because she didn’t have a drivers license and I was always driving her around. She was super clingy and kind of pitted me against my best friend. 

One of the last times I hung out with her, she told me how she saw her younger brother naked and how he has a big dick(???). Later, we talked about possibly making plans for the next day and I mentioned how I hadn’t been to a certain local attraction in a while... she immediately tells her mom that we were going there tomorrow and to buy tickets for us. I didn’t actually want to go there and found it weird that she was telling her mom that we made a plan, so I said let’s think about it since the tickets were expensive. The straw that broke the camel’s back was when she texted me that she bought the same new boots that I had. I had built up so much resentment towards her weird behavior and copying that I cut contact with her. She ended up getting a job where my mom worked..... 

Looking back on it, it’s so stupid but I got the creepiest vibes from this girl. I felt like I was losing my identity with her attempts at emulating me and general oddities. You have every right to end your friendship, if you feel like you’d be better off! Good luck :)"

While I don’t agree that he was right in being so vocal about his distaste for your hometown, you allowed him to bother you and got on his level. Everyone is entitled to have an opinion, but the way you engage with those who have differing opinions speaks to your character. I think it would’ve been better to say something like “I’m sorry you feel that way about NYC. I love my hometown and I’m proud of where I’m from!” Rising above the situation leaves him feeling a little uncomfortable and would’ve probably made him stop. It’s better not to feed into the negativity and reward his complaints. I’m glad you’ve decided to drop him, though!"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fnkjmqp,t3_g2bjuu,1587029568.0,"Men usually like to spend money on women, but the magnitude of these gifts is, personally, a little much for me. It’s one thing if you guys have been officially together for a little while, but the relationship hasn’t really been defined yet. If I were in your shoes, I would thank him for the gesture but decline. The worst thing would be if he ends up being a LVM and expects you to repay him for these extravagant gifts or uses it against you in some way if things go south. The smaller gestures, like ordering you food, aren’t a big deal, but the phone and plane ticket are. I think it’s best to protect yourself in this situation. See where things go first :)"

I had the opportunity to move back home early (Thanks, COVID) and I’m so much happier here! This isn’t really a place with tons to do, like being in a large city would be, but we definitely have some cool spots with people around our age! Commute time depends on where you’re commuting to and what time you leave... into LA is often congested (but that’s pretty standard). Thousand Oaks is a great place to be because we’re close to the ocean, surrounded by beautiful nature, and can easily drive into LA!
