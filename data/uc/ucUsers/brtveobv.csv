UCDavis,fn90tcw,t3_g0bnp6,1586755758.0,"if they don’t have in person classes, i don’t see why they would expect anyone to be in Davis at all. arc, dining commons etc would be empty with bored employees"
UCDavis,fmttsv3,t3_fxckrq,1586378882.0,"Its fine. The cabinets are cheap, windows and walls are poorly insulated. The shared bathroom has a sliding door to my housemates room but it doesn’t matter since it doesn’t work. Every other week they have to shut off the water because of plumbing work. The only thing that actually bothers me is the construction down the street waking me up every morning"
UCDavis,fm1oz7t,t3_fshn3j,1585682399.0,the 76 on covell and jon jones rd. highly recommend because it’s touch free and minimizes scratches. pretty efficient washes too
