berkeley,fpiqfto,t3_g9qvaj,1588646426.0,I'm in a similar position. Have you been able to complete any of the cs courses at your cc ?
berkeley,fpih2t8,t1_fpidev5,1588640766.0,"I might try. I think it would be awesome if I made the cap. But in the case I don't, would Berkeley DS be a better option over UCSD Math-CS ?"
berkeley,fpichbs,t1_fpic6d2,1588638079.0,"As a Junior transfer, I don't enough time to risk taking the remaining courses(61B,C, and CS70) and not meet the GPA cap. Taking all those courses in one semester would be a pain in the ass."

berkeley,fnstxh4,t1_fnrr6bq,1587228726.0,Bro I literally haven't completed any of the major prep for stats. I think only one class even articulates from the nearby cc's. Is it worth going to Berkeley?  I'm thinking I could do applied math or Data Science instead.

UCDavis,fno5g4e,t3_g2qx84,1587112769.0,I also just got accepted as a Stats major and am looking to take the either data science or machine learning pathways.
jawsurgery,fnfdhey,t3_g08ldy,1586905986.0,You look like a prime candidate for double jaw surgery.  I suggest consulting with an orthodontist or an oral surgeon
jawsurgery,fnfdcvp,t1_fnfd4kw,1586905919.0,"Are you posturing your jaw forward in those pictures, bc your profile doesn't look bad enough to warrant surgery. Your bite also looks fine, apart from the midline deviation, but so does mine when I posture my jaw forward. 

Regardless, please talk to a skilled an reputable orthodontist in your area. I wouldn't trust internet randos with advice about this topic."
