It's barbaric, gingers aren't discriminated widely anymore but I know a few people that find gingers discomforting. It's a global issue that takes time. I am aware it's a race but bro, ppl were killed when they looked like you"

ApplyingToCollege,fnmpy7q,t1_fn8hqrt,1587075938.0,"Why is a HS junior talking about college when they don't even know what they're talking about LOL

The fact that you even bring up the Stanfurd rejects website literally makes no sense since many rival schools have websites like these: [http://ucberkeleyrejects.com/] (http://ucberkeleyrejects.com/) which transfers you to UCLA's homepage.

You're just feeding into the rumors where actual Cal students say otherwise."

berkeley,fmdi4p5,t3_fulxc0,1585968416.0,Dating situation is like any other institution. You just need to vibe well with the person. Everyone here is smart as fuck and quite sociable. The stereotypes are overly exaggerated -- every person is different.
