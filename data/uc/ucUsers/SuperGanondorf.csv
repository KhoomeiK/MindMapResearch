AceAttorney,fpmrgxx,t3_gdvbu5,1588739792.0,"DGS-3 is far and away the best, in my opinion. It's a mystery that's not too simple and not too complicated, with some fantastic characters, and it does a wonderful job of cultivating a genuine sense of dread and unease. It's hard to shake the feeling that something is deeply and genuinely *wrong*, and that hangs heavy over much of the case. It's really unlike anything else in the series and the writing is just amazing.

As far as main series games go, I'm torn between 3-2 and 6-2. Luke Atmey is probably my favorite ""filler case"" villain in the entire series, and the entire mystery is a bit convoluted in a way that perfectly fits the batch of lunatics we come to know and love in this case. 6-2 is just a really smart case in general, with awesome characters, cool reveals, satisfying explanations and another delightful villain."
AceAttorney,fplcfns,t3_gdxpzc,1588710227.0,"Gant is one of the few characters in the series about whom I would literally change nothing. I think everything about his character is perfect. His personality, his motivations, his characterization, his intimidation... It's all just *so good*. He's simultaneously one of the most lovable and one of the scariest characters in the entire series."
AceAttorney,fplcax0,t1_fpkgg7z,1588710160.0,"> Now all that being said, he has one glaring flaw- There is no real reason for him to do the things he does. The Neil Marshall murder doesn't make any sense even if he was trying to get some power over the Prosecutors' Office, especially since he's already very well-respected and was on the fast track to becoming Chief.

He did it to have a willing puppet in Lana by ""protecting"" Ema. Having a competent, powerful person in law enforcement with the power to pull strings, who will do literally anything you want, grants an insane amount of power. Gant is nothing if not an opportunist; he saw his chance, put the pieces together, and executed his plan. 

> he got super lucky that Jake wasn't at his post that he wasn't immediately caught.

Jake not being there was certainly what enabled the murder to occur, but they had just entered the evidence room and he would have known there was nobody manning the security desk. 

> And the whole having Lana dispose of the body also doesn't make much sense since he already had the perfect patsy with Edgeworth, it's too needlessly complicated.

I disagree. Edgeworth would absolutely not go down for this crime, given that he has no motive, little connection with the victim, and no evidence linking him to it other than the existence of the body. Plus, the knife with which Goodman was *actually* murdered, combined with the evidence left behind at the real scene, would have been a glowing neon sign pointing directly to where the murder actually occurred, and therefore to Gant. Having his puppet tamper with the evidence to clear him of suspicion was actually a solid move that threw everything off for at least a solid day of investigation.

> And killing Goodman was frankly really stupid and OOC for him 

Goodman was clearly onto something with the SL-9 case, and it would only be a matter of time before Gant's involvement came into question. Killing Goodman was very much a ""now or never"" thing because he would likely never have such a clear opportunity again, and he panicked and took it. I don't think it was especially OOC, as he probably predicted that Goodman would soon be onto him."
AceAttorney,fplah1v,t3_ge2whb,1588709226.0,"Nice list! It was a good read. I just have a few random points I want to discuss, in no particular order.

> ~ 6-3 is a masterpiece. Everything about it is amazing. I’ve talked about this absolute gem of a case many times and it is what I would consider to be quite possibly the only truly perfect case in the series.

Interesting. Personally, I thought it was a very good case, but the pacing was all over the place and the Anon Imus (or however it's spelled) thing was quite possibly one of the worst court sequences in the entire series.

>~ 6-1’s villain kinda sucks.

Lies and slander, metalhead Jesus is amazing.

> The civil trial segment is also a fun time, it’s mystery is very well done and both Paul and Armie are great characters.

Ehhhhh... I thought the mystery and characters were cool, but the entire setup of the thing felt *really* forced to me. It also felt like it threw away Phoenix's entire character development from 2-4, by putting him in a similar situation and having him immediately buckle under the pressure instead of dealing with it *like he's already done before*. 

> ~ 5-3 kinda sorta sucks. It has some things I absolutely love, like Hugh and the confrontation with Means, but also has Juniper and Robin who are fairly mediocre characters that pretty much only serve to prop up the amazingness of Hugh. Some of the mystery moments create some weird difficult to explain plot holes as well.

It's funny that you say this because I think 5-3 is the only main case in DD that rises to the level of ""okay."" It's still not good, but it's better than every other case in the game except the DLC.

> DGS

I agree with a lot of what you have to say about DGS. It definitely has by far the most massive variation in quality in the series. In my case rankings I did a while back, I put DGS-3 as my third best case in the series (and best non-finale case), and DGS-4 as my fourth worst case in the series (only above a couple tutorial cases and AAI-3). It's actually kind of crazy how wide the gulf in quality is. That said, it's still one of my favorites because when it's good, it's *really* good.


> ~ Case 3 is also mediocre but at least has some things going for it.

Honestly I think AAI-3 is the single worst case in the entire series. I don't see *anything* it has going for it, besides the hilariously creepy opening and Kay's and Lang's introductions. It's predictable from the very beginning, and it is an absolute horrendous slog from start to finish. I *hate* this case so much.

> ~ While I do think it gets a bit more praise than it really deserves, 2-4 is still a fantastic and intense experience, especially considering it was the second finale ever.

Just curious, why do you think that? Personally, I find it to be extremely powerful and gripping, and I think it has some of the best writing in the series.

> >!This case also features Holmes as his absolute worst, I feel he improves quite a bit as the game goes on but this isn’t a great first impression.!<

Honestly, >!finding Holmes on the coat hanger is probably the biggest laugh I had in the entire game, and from that point on I absolutely loved him.!<

> ~ Full of awful characters, probably the most in the series (aside from the next game on here). Sal Manella, Redd White, April May, Yanni Yogi, the list goes on but those are the worst offenders.

No arguments on Sal or Redd, but I actually kind of like April May; she's used for a short enough time that she doesn't start to grate for me, and she's entertaining enough. And I think Yanni Yogi is actually a pretty solid character; he can get a bit annoying but that's exactly what he's going for with his senile old man act. 


My ranking looks something like this (haven't played DGS2): 

AAI2 > T&T > DGS > AA > JFA > SOJ > AJ > AAI > DD"

I think most people don't hate her for what she represents, though. I think most people hate her because she's a freaking cartoon. I actually *really* liked her throughout most of the game because she was genuinely but quietly intimidating and that subtlety was actually really scary. But then after she transforms her design and personality are deformed to such an incredibly stupid and overwrought degree that she ceases to be intimidating and it's impossible to take her seriously.

I like the role she serves in the story. I like the story itself to a degree, although I think it goes a bit too far in its attempts to raise the stakes. I just hate everything about her execution as an actual character."
AceAttorney,fpf77jl,t1_fpbnfnt,1588563453.0,"I actually really like her ""arc"" in JFA (or more specifically, her lack of an arc); to me, the entire point of her arc in that game is as a mirror and foil to Edgeworth's development from the first game. Edgeworth grew and changed, and began to value the truth over winning. Franziska never took the opportunity to grow and learn, and she stands in striking contrast to Edgeworth when he finally returns. This is really the entire point of their final conversation in JFA at the airport, where she claims that she can't change who she's been all along. I love that ending because she is staring her potential for change right in the face and casting it aside. But that's exactly the thing that makes her so interesting: the potential is clearly *there*, it's just that she refuses to see it. It's a really interesting subversion of Edgeworth's arc, and highlights the things that make both of them such interesting characters. 

While later on in the series she does find her path and figure out who she is, I love JFA for not just retreading Edgeworth's arc with her, but going even bolder and having her actively *resist* changing. It's a fascinating dynamic."

truezelda,fp8u812,t1_fp6mwkc,1588403152.0,"It's not just you. It's a combination of two things for me: 1, dungeons are just awesome in general (I don't think I need to elaborate because I doubt that's a controversial statement) and 2, most of the shrines in BOTW range from boring filler to absolute hot garbage. 

I know that second claim is controversial, so hear me out. 

First off, there are very, very good shrines. Some of them have clever puzzles with an actual trick to them; the most memorable one for me (for good reasons) is the one where you have to escort a block of ice up a huge ramp full of obstacles that can melt it. It required some clever planning and use of powers to get it up there, and it was satisfying to figure it all out. The other notable shrines for me were the Dueling Peak shrines, which had an obvious but nonetheless enjoyable concept (sad they never did *anything* like that with any other shrines in the game). 

There are some other shrines that were good (some of the physics based ones could be fun).  I also don't count the reward shrines against anything, as the challenges for those are mostly great and are found *outside* the shrines. 

If most of the shrines were like these, with creative puzzles and challenges, and requiring ingenuity for solutions, I would support the shrines much more than I do. However, these good shrines make up a definite minority of the game's shrines. 

There are so, so many shrines that are really just a matter of doing the thing you're very obviously supposed to do, with no further challenge or complication. They're filler in the purest possible sense and the game would not be meaningfully different if one of these shrines were simply removed from the game. I don't have a number for how many of these there are, but there's really a lot of them.

There are *twenty* ""test of strength"" shrines- a solid 1/6 of *all* of the shrines in the base game consist of nothing but a standard fight against a mini-Guardian with no meaningful variation other than the health bar. That is an *insane* amount of padding with no meaningful content to be found. 

There's a handful of shrines with gimmicks based on motion control and these are an absolute dumpster fire. These are so bad I sincerely have no idea how they made it into the finished product. The motion controls feel like I'm playing an early alpha of the Wii with significant interference, and the precision required for some of these segments is infuriating. There's absolutely nothing meaningful to be found in any of these, and I wasted *so* much more time trying to get the asinine controls to work than it was worth to finish these garbage trials. 

So... yeah. There are definitely some good, memorable shrines, but not enough of them for them to really be that much a point in BOTW's favor, if you ask me. The vast majority of them aren't even pretending to not be filler content- they're just there for the sake of having something to find- and there are a few that are just absolutely terrible. Give me dungeons over shrines any day."

truezelda,fp19it6,t1_fp17cyw,1588228348.0,"> It was the first Zelda game that really had significant, interactable NPCs. It originated the use of magic in the series. Saying it did nothing is pretty insulting to the game.

Did I say it did nothing? No. It brought some of these elements *to the Zelda series*, but none of these ideas were new to *gaming* at the time, which is what I was talking about. Zelda 1 has the reputation it has because its impact on the *entire gaming industry* is still felt to this day. Zelda II advanced the Zelda series, sure, but to say it had much of an impact on the industry as a whole is just not true.

The only reason Zelda II is widely remembered today is because it's a Zelda game. The same game under a different title would likely be one of those many NES/SNES era adventure games known to enthusiasts but forgotten by most. The same can't be said of the original Zelda, even if it never got any sequels. 

> And yet again, the difficulty argument: there are far harder NES titles that are even more well known, and well liked. Ninja Gaiden. Megman 1. Contra. Castlevania. These titles are all fairly popular and are far, far harder than Zelda II.

Throwing out names of other hard games completely ignores the *context* of Zelda II and its difficulty. First of all, notice how *all* of those are pure platformers with linear, action-oriented levels. That kind of ""NES hard"" difficulty is much more forgivable in games where the only thing to do is fight and jump through levels. If you die, your penalty is to play a relatively short segment of gameplay again, and that's pretty much it (except Contra, which *everyone* knows the cheat code for that takes the edge right off the difficulty). If you game over in AoL, you have to fight your way all the way back across the overworld to get back to where you were, possibly bleeding lives along the way, just to get another chance at what you were doing. It's tedious and punishing in a way most of even the famously hard NES games weren't. In an overworld that size, that can add up to a solid half hour of pure wasted time, if not more.

That kind of difficulty *works* in pure platformers with short stages and unlimited continues because the penalty for dying is relatively benign (not to say it's good design, but it works). It doesn't *work* in an RPG adventure because it halts all forward progress, often for 20+ minutes at a time, in a game that's ostensibly about exploring and making progress. 

Also, I definitely mentioned other flaws than difficulty. There's more context to Zelda II being disliked. I alluded above that your explanation was largely correct. People are going back to it because of the later Zelda games. My point of contention is that people dislike it because it's different. No, they dislike it because it's not a well-designed game on many fronts. The difficulty is just a huge component of that. 

So why are all these other hard games super popular? Think about it this way: how many people are going back and playing the original Mega Man or the original Ninja Gaiden? Probably not very many; they're well-known, but mostly to enthusiasts. I think most of the old NES hard games have held up very poorly to modern game sensibilities, but people just aren't revisiting them often because there's not much reason to; they remain in the realm of the Hardcore Gamers ^TM that value that kind of experience. Zelda II is an old entry in one of the most important franchises in the world; of course it's going to attract more attention, and its flaws will be criticized in more detail."
truezelda,fp15nk3,t3_gann0y,1588225090.0,"Not all games age well. Design standards change, and with them our expectations of what games can and should do change. Zelda II was a technical marvel at the time of release, and it was well-loved by many because it did a lot of things nobody had seen before, and it did them well. *Many* of Zelda II's flaws were very standard issues that plagued the vast majority of games at the time (the lives system, the extreme difficulty, the garbled translations being nearly useless, etc.), so they were more easily ignored; that's just how games *were*. 

> Here's my take. Zelda, while popular during the NES era, got far ~~more popular~~ **better design** duing the SNES/N64 era when ALttP/OoT released. This meant that a large portion of the fanbase likely went back to play earlier titles and didn't enjoy it. As time went on, more and more people started to play the series, and the same thing happened: they didn't enjoy it. ~~The differences were too much.~~ **The game's serious design problems stood out much more now.** And thus, over time, the game gained a bad reputation.

I've slightly modified your explanation to be more similar to what I actually think happened. I don't think people dislike Zelda II just because it was different, they disliked it because the issues with the game, while nothing special for NES games, really hampered the experience to a significant degree. Also, even if these flaws were common to many games at the time, they hit Zelda II particularly hard because of the type of game it is; the lives system is frustrating in Mario, sure, but in Zelda II it is a really soul-crushing system to abide by.

Frankly I also think the original Zelda gets a much more lukewarm reception from people who play it nowadays than its reputation might suggest. It suffers from some similar issues, but they're nowhere near as pronounced, for the most part (except the crypticness/randomness of various hidden elements). Also, Zelda 1 was absolutely revolutionary in many, many ways and changed video games forever, and that's not a reputation that is easily forgotten; Zelda II was just a sequel, and nothing more."
AceAttorney,fozl2vl,t1_foziohz,1588192456.0,"See I disagree with the Phantom even being all that bad in comparison to a lot of the other villains. He does some awful things, but those are all in service to some higher power that is the *actual* evil in this scenario. Given how he constantly seems under threat of death if his cover is blown, I'd actually go so far as to say he's one of the *least* heinous villains in the entire series; everything he's doing is just to save his own skin, while serving some power that has him constantly fearing for his life if he steps one toe out of line. 

Yeah Ga'ran is probably worse objectively speaking, but her motivations are just bog standard villain motivations; she just has a lot more power to wield over people. In terms of scope I think she's pretty undisputedly the worst villain in the series because she has an entire country under her thumb, but in terms of personality and motivation, she's nothing special compared to many of the others; she's greedy and power-hungry, and that's about it.

I think the main villains for... well... most of the other games, actually, have much better arguments for being the most evil because their motivations tend to be much darker and more sinister.

I think it's (intentionally) left very unclear to what degree the lost money was Jimmy's fault versus Papa McGill's fault. Chuck probably doesn't know the whole story, but his version of events likely has a fair bit of truth in it, especially given what we know about Jimmy's young adult lifestyle. 

Not trying to justify Chuck's actions, or claim he was completely right. However, even if he himself had a hand in creating the circumstances that led Jimmy down the path to Saul, the fact that Jimmy went down that path means Chuck really *was* right about much of what he believed about Jimmy after all.

Animesuggest,fovszo9,t3_g9nk0z,1588106999.0,"All of these have been mentioned once or twice by others but I feel the need to highlight them because your favorites list looks a *lot* like mine and these also fit in super well.

{Ergo Proxy} is probably my second favorite anime after Steins;Gate. It is an exceptionally deep psychological thriller that weaves in powerful philosophical and psychological ideas that really make you think. It's often joked that you basically need a Ph.D. in philosophy to understand it; of course that's a silly exaggeration, but it speaks to the insane depth of this show. 

I'm honestly shocked more people haven't been suggesting {Neon Genesis Evangelion} here. It's been mentioned a couple times, but seriously, if it's a very intensely psychological story you're after, that's one of the best. It deals very heavily with its characters' psychology, including entire episodes taking place inside their minds, and it dives deep into the issues holding them back. 

{Attack on Titan} is a lot of things, but probably my absolute favorite aspect of it is the strong sense of impenetrable mystery surrounding absolutely every aspect of the world. There's constant twists that simultaneously help us understand what's happening, but add tons more questions to the mix than they answer. The atmosphere of mystery is one of the show's greatest strengths.

{One Outs} is often described as Death Note but with baseball. It's seriously just a treat.

{Monster} is basically the magnum opus of the psychological thriller genre in anime. It's absolutely colossal at 74 episodes, but every single one adds another piece to the tapestry of characters, mysteries, answers, and questions hanging over everything. There's an absolutely incredible amount of depth and subtlety to every single aspect of this story, and it's worth pushing through the slow start to experience this epic (in the very traditional sense of the word) story."

Bioshock Infinite is supposed to be a story about a man redeeming himself from his violent past, and you're taking what is almost literally a buzzsaw to people's faces on a regular basis.

And yet this never even crossed my mind while playing the game because the story was focused elsewhere; the gameplay was there not so much to serve the story, but to provide a particular experience. I have a lot of problems with Infinite, but the over-the-top violence was never one of them.

I don't speak Spanish at all so I can only go by what other people say, but the only character whose Spanish I hear complaints about that doesn't primarily speak English on the shows is Don Eladio (and actually I've heard mixed things about his manner of speaking). I don't really know the story behind that casting choice; it might just be that they felt his fit in the role overrode the language barrier.

demisexuality,fnrlzo3,t1_fnpgb8o,1587193272.0,"> how intense squishes and crushes can be. That may be a helpful thing to talk about. 

Seriously yes. I have only had a couple crushes in my entire life but they were extremely intense, consuming feelings that were on my mind pretty much constantly. 

I would describe it this way. From the way I see it and the way people have described it to me, it seems many people have a spectrum of attraction/investment in a crush or potential love interest. From ""not interested at all"" to ""kind of interested"" to ""interested but not totally invested"" and so on, or something along those lines. There's degrees of attraction and investment, and it tends to increase as you get to know the person better and become more invested in their lives.

I don't work like that, and I never have. For me, it's more like a switch. There's two settings: ""not romantically/sexually interested at all"" and ""100% emotionally invested in pursuing a relationship with this person."" When I have that strong emotional bond with a person and that switch is flipped, I crush really, really intensely."
demisexuality,fnrllrr,t3_g33wod,1587192898.0,"> Demis don't like sex

I would elaborate further on this, mentioning the myth that demis have low sex drive. Libidos are all over the map for demis just like for everyone else; demisexuality purely has to do with attraction. 

> Hetero-/homo-/bi-/pan-/aromantic + hetero-/homo-/bi-/pan-/a-/demisexual

Demiromantic is also very much a thing, and it's defined analogously to demisexual, but for romantic attraction.

Also worth noting here is that demisexuality is not exclusive with the other sexualities mentioned. One can be both demi- and homosexual, for instance.

> Feelings of isolation and brokenness

This. So much this. This was my experience throughout my entire life, where it seemed like everyone around me was getting into relationships and dating like crazy, and I just didn't get it. I knew I wanted it, but I didn't *get* it. And until very recently I didn't have the terminology or the understanding of my own sexuality to comprehend what exactly that disconnect was.

This point very much deserves emphasis too because it seems like one of the first reactions of many people is that it's a perfectly typical experience; there are lots of people who don't want to have sex with people to whom they aren't connected emotionally. But this misses the whole point. It's not about *choosing* anything, and it's not about the importance of the bond; it's that without that emotional bond, there just straight-up isn't any attraction whatsoever. That attitude that this is just a typical experience further heightens that feeling of isolation because it makes you feel bad for feeling bad.

> Personal anecdotes are welcome!

This was before I was familiar with the concept of demisexuality, but it is extremely relevant to the experience. 

A little while back, some friends and I were at a bar. My friend was explaining how to go about meeting potential dates at bars and the like, and he was talking about how you just have to find someone attractive and go talk to them. He asked me about the qualities I find attractive in a person, or what my type is, and I just had absolutely no answers. I tried to explain that I don't really care about looks much, and that I care more about personality and how I connect with somebody. His response was that those are definitely important factors, but when it comes to initiating contact, there needs to be something that draws you together, something that ""intrigues"" you about the other person. Not once in my life had I ever experienced a feeling like that, of being drawn to a total stranger, so while I understood the concept he was talking about, the feelings he described were totally foreign to me.

That relates back to the feeling of isolation and brokenness mentioned because that's exactly how I felt. It felt like there was something that I was just missing somehow, that everyone else around me seemed to just get. Once I found the term ""demisexuality"" (on a random meme subreddit of all places) and started reading about it, it was like everything clicked for me."
BurnNotice,fnk4m0z,t3_g28mhq,1587014813.0,"I think it's a confluence of several factors. 

Part of it is that I think this was always the intended direction to take the show. The darkness within Michael had been teased and built up constantly over the course of the first half of the show. Just look at his encounter with Simon. It's always been inside him and I think they were always planning on trending darker as the show went on.

Part of it is that the plot kind of always had to go this direction on the trajectory it had been following. If anything regarding the overarching story was going to be resolved, it would have to go to some dark places because it just wouldn't be satisfying otherwise. Also, there's some really messed up stuff that happens over the course of even the earlier parts of the show. That eventually has to weigh on a person. 

Part of it is viewership and trends. This is just speculation on my part but ""monster of the week"" show formats felt like they were starting to fall out of style hard and fast around the time this shift occurred. Shows like Breaking Bad were ushering in a new era of continuous dramas and episodic shows like Burn Notice were losing popularity. Also, shock brings in views. One of the things I really *hated* about the show (that is now no longer relevant) is that the preview for the episode where Nate is killed heavily revolved around throwing in your face ""someone is going to die! But who?"" It felt like a really, really cheap advertising gimmick to draw in some viewers. So I think viewership definitely factored in.

And part of it is that as a story keeps going and building up mysteries and plots, raising the stakes is a must to maintain that emotional investment. Raising the stakes in serious stories quite often means going to some darker places, especially in a world as gritty and violent as that of Burn Notice.

So I think there were quite a few factors that led to a darker turn for Burn Notice. I think it worked beautifully though- that final season was *incredible*."

It's the same way coins don't really mean anything anymore except as guidance to the player. The extra lives are meaningless these days, but both of these things feel really good to collect. And in a game like Mario, which doesn't have anything in the way of resources to manage or a larger reward structure beyond ""collect the shiny things and finish the level,"" these little rewards serve their purpose well.

What I don't understand is how this plan- whose only apparent flaw requires both a natural disaster and extensive foreknowledge by the targets to take advantage of- is in any way bad storytelling or unbelievable writing. 

I'm just not seeing at all why it's a problem with the *story* that Morgan and Dahlia never considered this incredibly unlikely and specific possibility. Yes, it would have been easier to counter *if* they had predicted it and discussed accordingly, but why is it so unbelievable that they didn't do so?

What ended up happening was clever counterplay on the part of Godot, Misty, and Maya, taking advantage of something Morgan and Dahlia failed to predict. I actually think that ends up being a very well- constructed set up. It's a weakness in the plan, but it's an extremely believable one, and I don't see how having that weakness makes the story any weaker."
AceAttorney,fngkn59,t1_fnggh6e,1586935283.0,"I did have a whole response typed up of why it's definitely possible and justifiable that the topic of Maya's appearance never came up, but I thought it was a bit of a moot point. Reason being, I frankly find it just as believable that this discussion of Maya's appearance actually was had at some point. 

However, I would actually find it quite hard to believe that they ever felt the need to discuss Pearl's appearance. It's entirely possible that Dahlia didn't know that Pearl did *not* have dark hair, as she's never seen Pearl. As far as I can see, the only scenario relating to their plan where Pearl's appearance bears any relevance whatsoever is if someone else channeled Dahlia first, and that scenario is frankly so far out there that I don't believe there's any way they could possibly have accounted for that possibility. They had absolutely no reason to believe anything like that had even the most remote possibility of happening. As far as the plan was concerned, Pearl was just the vessel for Dahlia, and that was as far as her relevance went. Why would they discuss her appearance when Dahlia was just supposed to appear inside her body anyway?"

My first Ironclad A20 win was a pretty slim Searing Blow deck, which is exactly the opposite kind of deck that is usually needed for that ascension. Granted, I wasn't going for the heart. But that's one thing I love about this game- you can cobble together some really unexpected stuff that just ends up working beautifully."
AceAttorney,fnfio0w,t1_fneajd4,1586908788.0,"> Dahlia was marching right into a place full of mediums, and a way to tell who's who would have been incredibly helpful

You keep saying this, but that's just not true. Hazakura Temple is not anywhere even close to ""full of mediums."" It has exactly two people running it and a couple visitors, and Maya had the Inner Temple booked for training *by herself*. The identifying features were unnecessary because according to the plan, Maya would be the only person in the Inner Temple doing training. The only other people that could possibly be around there would be Iris, who Dahlia would obviously recognize, and Bikini, who is obviously not Maya, as even if there were other mediums there, none of them would be in or around the Inner Temple at that time. 

So yes, it might have been wise to clue Dahlia in a little bit more. But the way the plan was laid out, this was completely unnecessary because Maya could 100% be identified based on nothing but her location. I don't find it hard to believe at all that this information wasn't gone over.

Also there's the fact that posing as Iris would be incredibly simple and if there was somehow any confusion (assuming Pearl had channeled Dahlia as planned), Dahlia could have easily found Maya through asking around. 

Then there's the fact that Maya's description is pretty generic. ""Thin girl, average height, dark hair"" really doesn't narrow anything down in a way that would be useful to the plan.

It's not that what you're saying is necessarily wrong- Morgan could have told Dahlia about Maya's physical appearance. But I don't find it at all hard to believe she didn't bother because the plan was laid out in such a way as to make that information wholly unnecessary."

demisexuality,fnfeh95,t3_g1f38w,1586906510.0,"I'd been really depressed for quite a while at least in part because I'd never had a relationship. Every person I've ever been remotely interested in was a close friend, and several friendships had already been sunk over this pattern. Even though I've really wanted a relationship, the idea of approaching strangers or initiating romantic contact with people I barely knew just felt really off-putting to me. 

What really made me think was a few months back, when a couple friends and I were hanging out at a bar. One of my friends was explaining how people make connections at places like bars, and he was talking about how it mainly works by finding someone you're drawn to and going up and talking to them. I tried to explain that looks aren't really important to me- I'd much rather get to know someone, and that intellectual and emotional connection was more important to me. He rebutted that by saying those things are certainly important, but they develop over time; to make these connections in the first place, you find someone who has something about them that intrigues you, makes you want to get to know them a bit. I understood *conceptually* what he was talking about, but not once in my entire life had I felt anything like what he was describing. I wasn't really sure what to make of that.

Now, very recently (we're talking a timescale of weeks here), I came across a random reddit thread. I don't remember at all where I found it, but it was on some random gaming or meme subreddit, and I came across a couple people talking about these kinds of experiences that I could relate to. And the word ""demisexuality"" came up. And I read up on that, and found myself relating to almost every single thing I was reading about it. I read up on it over the next couple weeks, and read people's stories, and I found that it really fit me well.

I decided that I probably was demisexual, so I talked to my best friend about it last week. I told her about the term, and how I felt it suited me, and how I felt about relationships and whatnot. She was super supportive because she's amazing, but also for me it just felt absolutely fantastic to be able to articulate exactly what the disconnect I'd been feeling with the way most people engage with romance was. It was then that I decided that I really do identify this way, and it was such an empowering thing to acknowledge about myself.

So yeah. I hadn't even heard the term until maybe a month ago, and now I wear the demisexual label with pride. It's all still pretty new to me but I'm learning more about myself and the community every day."
