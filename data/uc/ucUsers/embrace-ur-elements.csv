&#x200B;

I say its gonna happen because once you stop dodging smaller barrels you'll start dodging the bigger ones. Then you'll beat yourself up for not pulling into those. Fond memories of great waves you missed... I would say we all have those haha"
surfing,fphy87p,t3_gdjzzw,1588630022.0,Maybe but it will be hard. There's not gonna be much room for 2 people on the board though when you're just laying out / paddling for a wave.
surfing,fphxq3g,t1_fpheu8t,1588629748.0,Yeah I agree. I noticed the reef breaks I surf in Hawaii can handle a lot more onshore than the California beach breaks I go to.

MLQuestions,fnexx08,t3_fyk88k,1586897883.0,I realize my suspicion is correct. The Neural ODEs architecture is a new architecture altogether (not only in the sense of it being a continuous time approximation of resnet).
