relationship_advice,fpc9lhr,t3_gcms8k,1588492357.0,"I can‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs unusual but if he‚Äôs not willing to do it then it makes you question why. Like, if you can‚Äôt kiss someone after going down on you, why should you expect said person to go down on you? Do you not trust your own cleanliness? It‚Äôs interesting"
unpopularopinion,fpanton,t3_gc6iz1,1588452011.0,"Damn. I thought this was a popular opinion. Sparkling water is gross most of the time. When they try to use flavors it just never works. The only time I‚Äôve had sparkling water that was good was from the dollar store because it had so much flavor, but now that I think of it it could‚Äôve just been clear soda. I‚Äôve never had sparkling water taste that sweet."

unpopularopinion,fp0ys0t,t3_gaoqfw,1588220024.0,"Yeah I agree it‚Äôs a preference, until you go as far as bringing down and insulting other races to justify your preference. Then it becomes racism"
unpopularopinion,foynib2,t3_gabx80,1588175712.0,‚ÄúAs long as you‚Äôre not taking advantage of someone‚Äù that‚Äôs what emotional manipulation is... playing on people‚Äôs emotions to your advantage.
unpopularopinion,foxf5uy,t1_foxezso,1588142117.0,"Haha no worries. They have their own accent in the Midwest, it‚Äôs kinda hard to explain :)"
unpopularopinion,foxekce,t3_ga49b0,1588141607.0,As an American I wonder what kind of American accent you immediately think of. Like are you talking about the California accent? A souther accent? Boston accent? Midwestern accent?
unpopularopinion,fox5njs,t3_ga2sa6,1588134677.0,"I agree with you in that people should pay their taxes, but in my experience people who are patriotic tend to lean more republican and don‚Äôt want much government intervention, therefore they don‚Äôt like taxes"
sex,fow7mzq,t3_g9xlqi,1588114515.0,"Don‚Äôt let that whole ‚Äúvirginity is pure and sexy‚Äù thing get to your head. That‚Äôs a socially developed concept that does nothing good for women but keep them from expressing their sexuality. You‚Äôre not dirty for sleeping with other people. As long as you‚Äôre having safe sex, you have no reason to feel guilty!"

sex,fotk5vd,t3_g9i65g,1588056446.0,I have no idea why (some) guys do this. It‚Äôs so confusing. The guys who do that are trash anyway though so don‚Äôt stress over him
unpopularopinion,fotk215,t3_g9i6uj,1588056347.0,"It‚Äôs all about that nostalgic feeling. It‚Äôs appealing to some, but not everyone (obviously)"

TooAfraidToAsk,foizl95,t3_g7q07h,1587802584.0,"Definitely varies per person. So if the guy has a very bad diet that consists of a lot of junk food, it‚Äôll most likely taste sour or just overall not pleasant. Meanwhile when I was fooling around with this guy who was very healthy, I found that his didn‚Äôt really taste like anything (which is actually nice if you think about it)"

NoStupidQuestions,fo9yeba,t3_g6jqw4,1587634907.0,Yeah it‚Äôs definitely not realistic. The only time I can see that happening is in a job setting where the boss wants to speak to an employee
sex,fo96prx,t3_g6f9pq,1587611817.0,"As a girl, in this context it‚Äôs safe to assume that the girl would be fine with kissing (just like when I hookup with a guy I assume he‚Äôs okay with me touching him) but I know someone could argue the importance of consent"

relationship_advice,fo1d6hz,t3_g555hl,1587430734.0,"I know this sounds mean, but what I like to do is distance myself from that person and whenever I think of them, I try to think about their flaws and focus on them"
NoStupidQuestions,fnr9873,t1_fnr8yry,1587182458.0,"Like I said to someone else on this thread, I‚Äôve heard British people not enunciate the T before. Like in the word water I‚Äôve heard them say it like ‚Äúwah-uh‚Äù so it‚Äôs definitely not just an American thing. Perhaps it has to do partly with specific accents."
NoStupidQuestions,fnr70rw,t1_fnr6wl0,1587180870.0,But even some people with British accents don‚Äôt enunciate the T. They may say it like ‚Äúwah-uh‚Äù so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just an American thing

UCSC,fnbs064,t3_g0ud0s,1586821161.0,One of my professors has a clock that makes a loud distinct sound every hour and it went off during a Zoom lecture. In the chat someone accidentally said ‚Äúawesome cock‚Äù and I thought it was so funny
relationship_advice,fnajvka,t3_g0ndbd,1586798768.0,You definitely did the right thing.

UCSC,fnab9pc,t3_g0lj0n,1586794445.0,I‚Äôm a first year so this is only my second time applying for housing but are we only allowed to choose one college to put down as a preference? Because it‚Äôs only letting me add one

sex,fn09ruc,t3_fyjo54,1586538005.0,"I‚Äôm not a man but I just wanna say I love that you had the confidence to ask for something that would satisfy you.

relationship_advice,fm2fyns,t3_fsnors,1585696708.0,Some people just prefer texting over phone calls. It‚Äôs probably nothing to worry about.
