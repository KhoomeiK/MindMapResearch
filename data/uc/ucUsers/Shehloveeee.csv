UCSD,fp0yily,t1_fp0xe4p,1588219844.0,Just wondering how many Units you took to get that amount?
UCSD,fp04xy6,t3_gaf5az,1588202565.0,You just have to keep trying. Itâ€™s hard for people even with experience to get a job during the pandemic. Iâ€™m sure that means itâ€™s even harder for those that are post grad. Businesses are up in the air and highly unsure what the future will look like right now. I think you just gotta give it some time for now.
UCSD,fozkm2l,t3_ga51dc,1588192232.0,"It was hard and not enough time. 
and I was having anxiety cause everything was loading  slow and it was all confusing when to take the test, or why things werenâ€™t opening...

Just stressful and disorganized. I hope she curves."
UCSD,foofngs,t1_fooed17,1587938102.0,No she didnâ€™t
UCSD,foodppk,t1_foiqcbt,1587937143.0,"So if we were to take 12 units during the summer sessions. Does that mean we have to pay out of pocket since each 4unit course is about $1.1k? 

And aid is $2.1k.

Am I doing the math right? Lol"

She might have also been one of the early ones to recieve it."
UCSD,foochmk,t3_g7l2no,1587936543.0,You can adjust and theyâ€™ll take a few weeks to update.
UCSD,fooc5hk,t1_foobsg0,1587936381.0,"Iâ€™m not totally sure. I believe it is based on needs. I think they use the financial aid / tax forms to determine youâ€™re eligibility. 

She said she didnâ€™t fill out any forms for basic needs, she just randomly saw it in her account yesterday."
UCSD,foed52y,t1_foc6ayn,1587700953.0,"I really wish that the protesters have to sign a waiver to waive their rights to medical help if they do find themselves sick. 
If theyâ€™re being selfish enough to protest in groups. They shouldnâ€™t have to take up someone elseâ€™s spot who gets sick while TRYING to abide by the rules."
UCSD,fo7xop1,t1_fo5slmh,1587586325.0,"Same but itâ€™s fine. Sleep and wake at my own hours. Are we even in real life anymore 

Haha"
UCSD,fo598v4,t3_g5jts6,1587520282.0,Set move in date for early summer sessions. Youâ€™ll likely get the first spots when a lot will move out after spring.
UCSD,fo593oc,t3_g5m1sd,1587520191.0,"I actually hope itâ€™s online. 
Just cause Iâ€™ve never had sleep like this in my life lol"
UCSD,fnfjnvu,t1_fnfhm2m,1586909358.0,Interested as well

Suppose to be an easy A"
UCSD,fn83tkn,t1_fn4nsge,1586733312.0,I think I replied to the wrong comment but it is LTWL 172 super boring but not difficult at all.

UCSD,fn4ea5r,t3_fz2hh4,1586639603.0,"Iâ€™m at 24, still at 24. 
And doing OK.. but sometimes I get a mini heart attack because Iâ€™m confused about the due dates but thatâ€™s just my organization skills could be better, 



My best advice is that if you wanna take on many units, try to infuse some easy courses with them. That helps out a lot. 

One of my courses this quarter is replaying to an email question about a reading/ or video..

Since itâ€™s an easy weekly assignment it actually makes me feel like Iâ€™m taking 5 courses instead of the 6.

Hope that makes sense and good luck"
UCSD,fmrqwn8,t3_fwx3y8,1586332201.0,"It will be the end of the quarter and then youâ€™ll wonder what happen to spring?

UCSD,fmmk3zu,t3_fw6v9n,1586206724.0,"Some of us who live in housing unknowingly walking around, using facilities for studying, etc could have contracted the virus because we were unaware of this. They also didnâ€™t announce that they would be housing covid patients BEFORE the deadline to opt out of housing. 

- They didnâ€™t announce closure of using the community facilities until after Spring Break. 

Do you know how many people were in group settings in those small places??? 
Especially since most of these residents are graduate AND FAMILY HOUSING.. kids, elderly.. 

Who is Sam Mitchell and how can we get in touch??"
UCSD,fmkj0sn,t3_fvrv52,1586156614.0,"Assuming youâ€™re talking about tech as in devices. 
If youâ€™re just looking to simple emails, notes, recordings voice memos, I would go with the budget iPad.  The one stated above is the 7th gen. Around $250-$400 which is worth it to me! I have the older model and it does everything in need.   It completely replaced my older MacBook Air.  


If you get the budget iPad + accessories (full laptop style accessories) you can still be under $500-$600 if you wanted. But you also stated money is no issue, I would still get the budget iPad. Lol

Probably just splurge on all the accessories like wireless keyboard, etc!"
