Cooking,fp3j9yi,t3_gavphs,1588280275.0,common but a food scale! better than measuring w cups and teaspoons haha. airfryers are really nice to have (even though they take a little longer than microwaving something) and makes food taste like it was just fried or baked! nespresso machines (if you like coffee) - having an espresso machine is nice when you like cafe drinks but dont want to stop by starbucks everyday. (also nespresso >keurig because pods can be recycled!)
UCSD,fode534,t1_fod5k4y,1587683554.0,try posting on the ucsd facebook page and explain your situation and ask if anyone would be willing to drop!

Cooking,fmyi46b,t1_fmybzeb,1586486714.0,"lmao bro if you search up his name, it literally says hes a chef. He created the recipes for the food at his restaurants, but hes probably too busy to be physically there at all of them, cooking the food."
Cooking,fmybifj,t1_fmy9ibv,1586482343.0,"lmao no not really it just stuck out
and hes not only in youtube.. hes been in the food industry for years and is one of the game changing leaders in koreas food business. He always looking for ways that would make cooking more approachable and easily accessible and to help farmers who are struggling with crops and avoid overproducing by promoting their products and food. Hes also one of the few people who got their silver button and gold button at the same time. Shows how much hes well known and liked in Korea."
UCSD,fmxo8dx,t1_fmxkfds,1586468695.0,"if i enroll later than today (after talking with my advisor), would i be able to make up the work at a later time?? i wonder how lenient professors are with that..."
Cooking,fmxnx4w,t1_fmxlk72,1586468526.0,"for someone with the username ‚Äúi never get mad‚Äù, you seem pretty triggered by all the comments about baek. Hes a humble man but I would say he is a chef because he thinks of a lot of his recipes and actively tries to make it easier for people who live alone or find cooking difficult or hard to approach. He has many cooking shows too. i would think he teaches his employees to cook the food he sells, but he‚Äôs probably way too busy with all the businesses he owns, the food company, three kids, his food related shows, and his research on dofferent kinds of food."
Cooking,fmxn8ci,t1_fmxlgsa,1586468157.0,miso is different from korean doenjang so be careful not to use it as a substitute for doenjang! It has a slightly sweeter taste and is less dense.
Cooking,fmxn28n,t3_fxsvw3,1586468067.0,"Î∞±Ï¢ÖÏõê is a great person, too. Always trying to help people; even has a show that is focused on helping out restaurants and making them famous (if they deserve it). He actively tries to help out farmers and the agriculture business (has a show on that too), showing how people can use that type of ingredient in different kinds of food and how it is beneficial/nurtitious to the customer and the producer. He is very respected in Korea because of his good deeds and how he actively tries to create new products that are beneficial to the people. A truly amazing human being."
UCSD,fm2qybl,t1_fm1ucth,1585703379.0,it probably wont because attendance isnt mandatory this quarter. The profs dont even know how itll work because they can‚Äôt drop students on the waitlist.
