Metroid,fpgvnep,t1_fp3y071,1588610329.0,"IDK.  While M1 is good, and it definitely earned its place in the NES lineup when compared to games of its time, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, and calling players who find its imperfections offputting 'lazy' isn't doing those players justice.  Beyond not having a map, its save system is extremely limited and obnoxious, the gameplay feels a bit clunky, and the world is a bit bland.  It's definitely better than many other NES games, but the game feels like it's constantly butting up against the NES's limitations.

Aside from 'laziness', there are plenty of reasons I'd recommend someone skip M1 in favor of Super or ZM:
- disabilities or time constraints that make DIY mapping hard (for whatever reason)
- frustration with the game's very punishing save mechanic (which all future games in the franchise dropped for very good reason)
- the world design being very weak and repetitive in places.
- The controls being clunky"
Metroid,fpgtxdr,t3_ga28rq,1588609448.0,"It's a decent remake, quite effectively using the GBA's power for a more fluid, more playable experience of the core design aspects of the original, though it does often stray from its source material into entirely new concepts.

While the game does suffer a little from the limited number of buttons on the GBA, and seems to have been rebalanced to be friendlier to on-the-go play at the expense of weakening the Metroid formula somewhat (case in point: the non-optional hint system), **Zero Mission is still a vast improvement upon the original**."

Ok, there are a bunch of moving parts in this.  The first thing I notice, is that your parents are attempting to shield your brother from reality, at the expense of denying him the human freedom he deserves.  This sounds like a 'golden child' pattern, and it has two main hazards - it near-guarantees that the golden child is unprepared for reality, and it denies the siblings the equal childhood they have a right to.

But he can't be entirely innocent in this either.  His sexism, while 'logical', seems to have been developed devoid of any moral framework, and thus is likely relying on horribly biased assumptions.  He can't necessarily control the fact that he doesn't understand other humans, but he can't just shrug off responsibility for the fact that he has written off large numbers of people as inherently inferior."

ProgrammerHumor,fp001gd,t1_foyrntp,1588199948.0,"IDK.  I think Rust's advantages extent a bit beyond the debugging of known bugs - C/++ code often has severe bugs (e.x. Heartbleed) for years before anyone notices, because many of its bugs aren't obvious until very specific conditions cause something to fail, and by that point the code likely is in widespread use and has been for years, threatening the user's stability and security that entire time.  Rust can be more effort under many conditions, but that comes with the confidence that Rust-derived code is vastly less likely to be a minefield of 0-day security holes and inexplicable crashes or silent correctness errors.  Especially for a compiler - a program whose correct operation is critical to the correctness of much other code across many systems - this is of substantial value."

rust,fnmrpb2,t3_g2lcym,1587076877.0,"If you're accounting for paging to mass storage, you're gonna have to worry about hardware and OS properties, and you'll need much more sophisticated systems than just userspace software scrambling.  Overburdened SSDs, for instance, will sometimes contain more space than advertised, and sometimes remap 'deleted' or 'overwritten' data to unused or more lightly used space instead of actually deleting the data.  Further, mechanical HDDs tend to leave traces of previous data when overwritten, that can be read by specialized equipment, though each successive overwrite makes retrieving earlier data harder.  Guaranteeing that paged-out data is overwritten securely will vary by OS, and might not be possible.

Your best bet might be to encrypt the page file and delete the keys when the app closes - though you've suggested that your current system can't guarantee deletion of keys.  It might also be possible to simply disable mass storage paging, though you might also have to guarantee that the OS doesn't quietly reallocate RAM, and you'll have to worry about microarchitectural side channels like Spectre and Meltdown (though this is mostly a matter of OS configuration and being careful with other concurrent software).

Depending on how sensitive this is, acceptable solutions range from ""don't worry about it"" to ""air-gap the system, write and formally prove every bit of code yourself, and use security-optimized hardware""."

We're past the exponential phase, and meanwhile the harms of lockdown are getting increasingly close to a real danger.  We keep lockdown too long, and people experience mental health deterioration, people starve, people fail to make rent, people fall into debt, people let their medical needs go unmet.

Meanwhile, lockdown isn't the only way to control a pandemic.  It's the nuclear option of pandemic control - it works, but it does a lot of real, life-and-death damage of its own.  If we resume some socialization while maintaining distancing (so some restaurants and maybe shopping malls, but no massive international conventions or concerts) and quarantining the few cases that do happen (with contact tracing), we can still control the pandemic without all those massive problems.

It's also worth noting that the US is a massive area, and the pandemic has an extent of locality.  A rural town with no cases and very little tourism can probably reopen immediately, while NYC's probably gonna be a disaster zone into June.  Reopening will depend on the current scale of the pandemic in the local area, available tests and medical infrastructure.  NYC still being in the exponential phase won't affect reopening in CA very much."

Under the South Korean model, a single positive test will get every contact quarantined, and all of their contacts.  Meaning that, for a case to get quarantined, only one of the following has to test positive:
- The patient themself
- Whoever infected them
- Whoever infected the person who infected them
- Anyone else who was infected from the same source patient
- Anyone they infect
- Anyone infected by anyone they infect

That's so many people, that even a somewhat iffy test is going to catch at least one of them, as long as it's applied widely enough - and this model has been proven to work.

Meanwhile, with an R0 of 6, just cutting down chances of infection to 1/6 through widespread free (or even mandatory) testing and quarantine will guarantee that the pandemic gradually fizzles out.

To be effective, lockdowns will probably have to be Wuhan-level quality and widely obeyed, neither of which are likely to be even remotely feasible in the US.  Getting to 1/6 with testing and vaccinations could actually work quite well with much less risk of triggering revolt, and it'll catch resurgences and foreign-imported cases quite effectively."
