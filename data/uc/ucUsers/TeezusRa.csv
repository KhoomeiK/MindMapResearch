That may or may not fit with what you need if you aren’t happy with App Academy giving you problems that are somewhat out of reach with what you’ve been taught. 

Also, as a last note- don’t get discouraged if something takes you a few hours and “should only take 30 minutes”. The time isn’t the point. Comprehension is, and some things will click, others are a pain in the behind to get. It’s going to be that way for the rest of your time coding.

Hope you find something that works for you and your learning style!"

learnprogramming,fp3n231,t1_fp3mtuu,1588282206.0,"Hm, well I wouldn’t say TOP necessarily does the same, but it might ask you to figure out how to even find the ^ operator on your own. So you might find it even more difficult when it comes to the projects or exercises. 

That said, the Discord community is really strong and incredibly helpful, and questions are more than welcome there when it comes to the curriculum."
learnprogramming,fp3jwrr,t3_gb43z6,1588280599.0,"I think you’ll hit the same barriers because TOP is pretty independent and throws documentation and articles at you- it doesn’t hold your hand step by step to tell you just how to execute something. It gives you the bare minimum requirements and maybe a hint at what methods you should look at. 

Might be worth slowing down a bit and digging into what you’re stuck on."

console.log(ComputerPlay());
console.log(PlayRound(UserPlay(), ComputerPlay()));

Do you think this is going to show you the computer play that you should expect when you `playRound`? You're calling it twice, so it's going to be something different when you call it in `playRound`."

Are you also using python3 instead of python to run it in the terminal? If you don't have an alias, using `python filename.py` is a good way to get some errors thrown, instead of `python3 filename.py` (although, when I tried this it pointed to the end of the string, not the beginning)."

learnprogramming,fp2l10t,t1_fp2kd3r,1588263576.0,"ATBS is more relevant to my current needs with Python as far as automating parts of my job and personal life. It, however, does not really teach the nitty gritty of Python and programming with Python, which is why I picked up Crash Course as well. It think they both serve different purposes, so it’s hard to say which I like more when they’re so different. I think ATBS is a great read for folks who have the actual need to create programs like the ones in the book (aka working with file structures, the browser). 

Python Crash Course is a little more about the programming aspect, if that makes sense. It goes over Django, you make a game with Pygame, classes, and some other pretty big projects too."

I haven't had any issues with clear instructions though or the like, and think it has helped me figure out what questions to ask and how to get things done as independently as possible. I think it's a great resource to build folks into independent developers. The Discord server is actually wonderful. I learn something new there every day, even when helping others."

learnprogramming,fp2dbmy,t3_gaxeue,1588259775.0,"So, your definition of parameters and arguments is interesting. I usually see them used to mean nearly the same exact thing. The parameter is the placeholder variable name you see inside of the parenthesis following the function name when defining the function, and the arguments are the actual values passed in when the function is invoked. Maybe I'm misunderstanding your definition of arguments, because it's not really much of an ""either or"" question here. You can use both parameters and arguments when dealing with the exact same function. 

So unless you mean specifically using functions that do not have a set number of parameters, and what you might pass into it is completely variable, I believe the rest parameter can come into play here. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters

In the beginning I didn't understand parameters and their use, and now I can't believe I ever went without using them. I would write functions like your second example, instead of passing in specific arguments to a function defined with parameters. Lead to a lot of spaghetti code, especially when I needed to do the exact same thing with multiple items.

EDIT: Thanks to insertAlias, I understand a bit more clearly what you mean now, so you can take what I said with a grain of salt since it was a bit off the mark from addressing what you intended."
