CUDA is limited to only Nvidia, but I have a Nvidia Mac that I can run CUDA on.  You will see more Nvidia + Apple support soon.   Metal is very nice compared to Vulkan, Vulkan reads like a Dostoevsky novel.   It's not perfect but it sits higher in the abstraction (yet it still let's us as close to the metal we we need, hence the name).   It is like Khrono's went the complete opposite direction than OpenGL where it was too high level..   Linux and Android are perfect places where Vulkan will shine (since they will never get Metal or DirectX, and Switch can use Vulkan 1.0 but you will get more power using Nintendo's GPU APIs. MoltanVK is fine, but it is still using Vulkan 1.0, and I can't use it because I need YUV support that is only available in Vulkan 1.1 for video decoding.    It just makes more sense to talk to Metal directly and use Metal Performance shaders or some of the custom APIs to squeeze out every drop of performance I can.

My point is that developers need to target the best APIs for the most popular platforms.   This is why DirectX is so insanely popular, and also why games for the Mac just never make it over.  For years we could have had game devs just target OpenGL, but they didn't, they needed or wanted to use DirectX.   This caused Apple to be starved of games, and Microsoft kept investing more and more into DirectX (wink wink Xbox) to make it so Windows became the defecto gaming OS (PC and Xbox) and they made it proprietary so no one could port their games easily.   Khronos was too stubborn to go after the performance DirectX had (they vote by committee for every new feature) and they never got OpenGL to where DirectX was.      This screwed Apple, and they lost a huge part of the PC market share because no one would use a Mac for gaming because devs didn't want to use OpenGL.   Now that Apple has made Metal that can match DirectX one to one.  We are seeing a resurgence in gaming on iOS/AppleTV and macOS through Arcade, and I am excited to see if Apple takes it more seriously in the next couple years by allowing more GPU choices and expandability for gamers on the Mac platform."

>Says who?

Says any developer that has used DirectX 12 or Vulkan, the APIs are very complex and are very verbose.  Metal is beautifully designed.   So the answer is any developer that has used all of them. 

>Vulkan is the odd man out here,  How so?

This is because it isn't officially supported on Windows, and it isn't supported on iOS and MacOS.   Thus it becomes the odd man out.  Developers will always choose DirectX over Vulkan, and if they want to target macOS or iOS, then they have to use Metal since OpenGL is deprecated.

Microsoft let's OpenGL on their platforms but it isn't maintained by Microsoft.  However I was talking about game developers not Microsoft.  Game Developers choose to make their games with DirectX because it supports the graphics APIs they want to make their game run and look better than the competition.   This caused OpenGL to be forgotten to devs, and this is why you didn't see many games ported to MacOS because the devs targeted DirectX and didn't have an OpenGL port.   Unless DirectX was on macOS (which will never happen) we won't see game developers adopt macOS unless the engine they are using supports Metal under the hood.

> You do not make a ""custom"" API. That's just not how this works... 

Here is an example of Custom APIs only available for A12X gpus.   https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/gpu_features/understanding_gpu_family_4?language=objc

If they targeted OpenGL or Vulkan they would have needed to work with Khronos group to deliver these, which is the external dependency I was talking about. 

> And in the process, alienate plenty of software altogether.

Apple doesn't care about alienating developers, because they want quality over quantity (obviously this has been very successful).   However cross platform code is always going to need proprietary ways of handling the same task on different hardware.  From the UI stack to the graphics API, they are not the same platform and you always need to adjust for the platform you want to target.  A good engine writes an abstraction."

apple,fob4u41,t1_fob4aow,1587656134.0,"Lots of developers use Metal.  Every game on the Apple Arcade uses it, and all the major engines use it with no work for the developer.   Microsoft and Apple  are hoping to keep Vulkan and OpenGL off their platforms and they are doing a good job of that."
apple,fob151a,t1_foauk4c,1587654930.0,yes but it only uses Vulkan 1.0.
apple,fob133t,t1_foauqa3,1587654913.0,"Most game engines will choose the correct GPU API for the platform, DirectX for Windows, Vulkan for Android, and Metal for MacOS/iOS/tvOS.  Also Microsoft does not install Vulkan drivers by default and it is a real issue to keep those drivers up to date on Windows.   It becomes a even bigger issue if you want to interface with Image or Video Processing that requires Media Foundation support.  Media Foundation doesn't interface with Vulkan directly while it works with DirectX with no problems.   Game devs will always prioritize DirectX before Vulkan, and they should do the same with Metal."
