We lived together well, rarely got annoyed with each other, and didn't get in each other's way. Both of us compromised and made an effort to be accommodating, and it was fine. 

She's awesome and I was really lucky to have her, but we just didn't click as friends. I think a lot of the time people only post the horror or amazing stories about roommates when there's a third, extremely common option - a completely neutral experience"

berkeley,fopk711,t1_fopimgd,1587963677.0,"So I actually started out as an MCB major and I'm in process to switch to chem bio... Honestly the courses are pretty much the same in the first year, with the only real difference that chembio majors need to take chem 4a/4b and mcb majors need to take chem1a/1b. I'd say the 4 series is a little more difficult but definitely doable! If you have any more questions lmk :)"

berkeley,fnn7mxf,t3_g2rvq7,1587086184.0,I think as a BioE major you can take chem1a/l instead of chem4a which is probably easier since chem 4a is intended for chem majors
