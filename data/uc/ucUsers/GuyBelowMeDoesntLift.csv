neoliberal,fphdjfs,t1_fphcs2f,1588619359.0,"I think you would really enjoy watching it again. I understood so much more of the comedy once I had a better sense of what was going on. Yes they’re irredeemable criminals, but they think they’re just hardworking Americans, and they really are just broken humans who were born into shitty situations and destined to become their parents, and this generates a lot of the commentary. Every single real-life family in the show gets completely destroyed by the end, the title family getting saved for last in maybe the most horrifying way. There is a deep tragedy when you hear the characters say at the beginning what they want and then watch again how it unfolds and how it ends for them, and how they never could escape it.

It is a complete indictment of patriarchy and greed, and in many ways of illiberalism, on top of remaining extremely well-paced, realistic drama spliced with riotously funny scenes and one-liners. It is absolutely worth the rewatch when you get the chance."

neoliberal,fpha9c8,t1_fph8eks,1588617703.0,"I would try watching it again, it’s extremely worth it. For one it’s a much funnier show than you remember, I seriously consider it one of the top 10 sitcoms ever written. The show becomes much less of a mob story on a rewatch and much more a story about actual families, and it dives onto such a human level with every single character. There is no musical score - so much of the show relies on just watching people’s faces and listening to the things they say. Knowing how it ends for every character, you start to realize why things happen in the show and why the people in the show react, and their attitudes align perfectly with how the country changes over time, and I think as a whole it is a brilliant comment on materialism and existentialism.

I’m watching it for the fourth time now. It gets better every time. It’s unreal how much more you pick up on a meta level every time you watch it, and the acting, writing and directing still holds up so well."
