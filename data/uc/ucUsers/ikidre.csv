The whole booster shtick is to give upper stages a good push and then fall back down. That said, we could conceive that maaaybe rocket tech is a bit better post-WW3, and a crew capsule for a very short-duration mission might be pretty light, so your idea is not completely implausible."

Even with fees staying where they are, we are looking at massive cuts to departmental budgets. This comes as we were just *barely* done with the last round of belt-tightening to balance the campus budget. It's not going to be pretty."
berkeley,fnyd47u,t3_g4flws,1587359618.0,"Let me turn your question on its head, if I may: ask not what Cal might do for you, but what you could do for Cal.

I'm not a student. I work on campus. I've seen so many of the same student (and I know some personally): mom's a doctor, dad's an engineer. They go straight for CS or Engineering, which get the most funding *because* they are so popularâ€”and that's still not enough to help the insane class sizes or competitiveness.

If either of those fields are your dead-set dream, I'm not saying you ought to abandon it. I'm just saying, if there's another quite-good school that would offer you the same education that's less of a grind and a better financial deal, to me that's kind of a no-brainer.

On the other hand, if your dream is in a less popular field (or if you don't have one yet), you might find way more support and resources (relatively speaking). The financial part is still important, but you might calculate that the better networking opportunity in less-impacted departments at a prestigious university is worth it.

More pointedly, and this is absolutely my personal bias, the *school* would benefit more from academic diversity. If your motivation is limited to ""get best degree, get best paying job"" you can accomplish that in many places, and it would only make the cutthroat insanity you hear about worse here. However (and forgive me for sounding like a recruiter), if you're motivated by working hard and making a difference in an area you're passionate about, this school would benefit from having you."
education,fny6jbm,t3_g4ktxy,1587354633.0,"> Is it essentially just another way of saying assumption? 

Essentially, yes! Add ""for the purpose of argument.""

Your example ""sunset is the best time to go for a walk"" all by itself is a proposition, an argument. You could base that argument on the *premise* that, for example, watching a sunset is enjoyable, or that walks are beneficial to one's health. If you voice an opinion and someone responds ""why?"" they're asking you to explain the premise of your argument.

It's also sometimes used less formally to mean *scenario*. For example: ""The premise of the 'Toy Story' movies is that all toys are secretly alive and want to be played with by children."""

The funny thing is, both OP's observation and yours are the result of the screenplay writing process. It just wouldn't be at all compelling to be told about a plot point instead of actually seeing; we'd feel like it was being ""thrown away."" The general rule for all kinds of writing is ""show, don't tell.""

And for Star Trek in particular, you have 45 minutes-ish in which to cram all your plot points. You're not going to waste it on meeting room small talk. If there's a meeting room scene, you can bet it's going to be important for the story, or at least some character development."

I took it to mean that OP was describing a situation where someone uploaded a copy of a performance that was in the public domain, and that it would be copyright infringement since OP wasn't the uploader (which it probably wouldn't). I should have listened to that tiny voice of common sense in the back of my mind that was saying ""any movie worth showing is probably copyrighted!""
