LandlordLove,fpknuyd,t1_fpkmgds,1588697973.0,"Again, patio doors do not shut properly. Screen has huge gaps that let in insects. These are things my landlord has ignored that need fixing. Spouse has deadly allergy to wasps. I am not going to risk his life to do what I pay my landlord to do. If I get stung and find out that I'm allergic I really don't want to go to the emergency room right now given that we are in the middle of a pandemic. I pay him to maintain the building. I mean I can install a toilet but why should I if I pay him to do it?"
LandlordLove,fpk2vak,t1_fpjp1ct,1588686874.0,"Yes, me as an adult who pays over $2k to live in my apartment and who has a spouse who is *deathly* allergic to wasps and has the slidding patio doors right next to the nest which do not slide properly and has a broken big screen could not do it myself. Especially when there are no hardware stores near me, Amazon is taking weeks to deliver and I don't own a car forcing me to take public transportation and risk my own health as I am compromised. Yeah, I'm a total man baby (I guess you missed the part where I'm female)."
ucla,fpfb2dr,t3_gd2snf,1588566197.0,"I am so sorry to hear this. Please contact grief services, it will help to talk to someone but also by virtue of being a first generation college student and person of color you qualify for AAP. I was a humanities major and eventual tutored for them. I was a first generation college student and am a POC myself. I get it. The only reason I was able to actually graduate from UCLA was because of this program. Especially when it came to taking STEM courses. They also have their own counselors. Please, please reach out to them. My partner used to be a TA at UCLA as well. Talk to your professor and they should be able to make arrangements as well. If you don't feel comfortable go to your counselor. I preferred AAP counseling as it is a smaller department and they had more time to spend with me as well as also having similar background as me. I can tell you that I was involved in a nasty car accident as an undergrad with my entire family (parents and siblings). They were a tremendous help.Please reach out. Your Bruin Family wants to see you do well, especially if this is something your family wanted for you. You aren't the first person nor the last to have something like this come up (even if this is all due to a pandemic). Please let them help you. If you need someone to talk to I can help facilitate as I still know folks that are counselors there.((((Big Hugs))))"

I feed the troops in mass, wait for their numbers to double and then I ceremoniously cull half the lot so the strongest survive. The culled lot have a lot of fight in them as their bodies let out a lot of rage in the form of carbon dioxide that is frozen in time in a complicated matrix of gluten. But I honor their sacrifice by eating their bodies. Ummm...bodies."

AmItheAsshole,fosquft,t3_g95klk,1588036160.0,NTA Hell no. I was rhe oldest of a bunch of kids as well though not as many. My childhood was over at seven because it was now my responsibility to take care of my siblings. I'm not mad at my parents because they had a different set of circumstances than your own but older kids should not be used as free 24/7 childcare. You need to have a life as well and you have your own responsibilities. Chipping in once in a whilw is to be expected but come on. If they can't take care of their kids the baby factory needs to shut down.

California,foc63fd,t1_fobcyji,1587667535.0,I am aware. I was just commenting on the area.

AskReddit,fo2bys0,t3_g53q03,1587456627.0,"I realized that the had no filter and could not be bothered to be polite much less actually do something nice for me after doing for her. The last straw was when she stood me up twice for an extremely elaborate dinner I put together. I blocked her in all my social media and my cell. When we first met she told me she couldn't understand why she couldn't keep friends, hated her coworkers and her job. If she didn't agree with you or flat out thought you were stupid she would roll her eyes at you and tell you so. Absolutely no filter. I just noped it out of there real quick."

It's not, but it's also not mine either :)"

LandlordLove,fnwdkm4,t1_fnvjlar,1587316341.0,They are idiots and I am taking a nice tone initially because it always goes south through no fault of my own. I actually have an email from him when I just moved in with everything that was wrong with the apartment that they promised to fix. I got a reply that I received a deal and I can move out if I didn't like it with 30 days notice. I was only there for two weeks at that point. Whether I am nice or assertive the reply will be the same. Absolutely no tact.
LandlordLove,fnwcz49,t1_fnvjyja,1587316012.0,Yo're right. Maybe inside his car next time?
LandlordLove,fnwcvri,t1_fnvp2rp,1587315961.0,"No way will he ever do that. He has a very mistreated 1-2 person crew whom I can converse with and he can't. In the past we have had MULTIPLE handymen who never showed up more than a few times. Our neighbors who have had convos with them and have been around longer have told us that they regularly don't pay them. I do believe that is true as the landlord once asked if I had a $1,000 cash on me to pay the handyman. I'm like you own the damn building and you think *I* have $1,000 cash floating around my place? In case you haven't noticed you don't own the Ritz!"

LandlordLove,fnv47kl,t1_fnv2v5n,1587279682.0,"Yes, imagine being weak enough to have a deadly allergy to wasps. Also imagine having a landlord who refuses to fix the patio doors and screen that leads into your bedroom and that separates you from the wasps by a few inches. Yup, no way those wasps are going to chase into my bedroom once I spray them. No way the wasps would make use of those holes in the door and screen. You sure showed me.  You must be my landlord."
