thebachelor,fo74pjg,t1_fo7437j,1587572205.0,mm not sure! it’s might be either “mom sex” or “sex love and vaginismus” or one of their postpartum episodes.. sorry i don’t know exactly which one

Sacramento,fo4r50f,t1_fo4krdc,1587509613.0,"its not ridiculous. I said the way they went about it is ridiculous, it is literally accomplishing the opposite of what they want. if infections rate don't stabilize and slow, no one is going anywhere anytime soon. & by gathering together in a large group, calling people from ALL OVER THE STATE to gather here, they are NOT slowing the spread. Asymptomatics / people who had very mild symptoms could've spread the virus to others who may not have had it, now they are going home and spreading it there. It's really common fucking sense. 

I also never said they can't protest, I said it was ridiculous that they were doing so."

also, his trip with Ian was amazing writing to me. These two men have seen horrors unbeknownst to most, and somehow were able to share a small part of that with each other in order to at least TRY to BEGIN their healing processes."
