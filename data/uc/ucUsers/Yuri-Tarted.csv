UCSD,fpf49t2,t1_fpeqdsv,1588561428.0,"I agree to a degree. Working with people across different time zones or parts of the world is absolutely essential, especially with how long todayâ€™s environment may last. But I think thereâ€™s a difference between this type of collaboration for school vs a real job. Itâ€™s really easy for people in this situation to slack since they wonâ€™t get paid for their work, and would produce very different results than a group getting paid for their work."
UCSD,fpezlmp,t1_fpey4zg,1588558394.0,Yeah thatâ€™s definitely it. My group mate has been pretty unpleasant overall and is using the time difference as an excuse to not work at all. I need group mates like yours lol
UCSD,fpey0dy,t1_fpeuxj2,1588557389.0,Deleted work? Good lord I would lose it if that ever happened to me.
UCSD,fpexxbw,t1_fpew94a,1588557336.0,"I donâ€™t think this is too extreme of a take. Thereâ€™s plenty of people in your camp who would prefer to work solo instead of feeling like they need to babysit others. Iâ€™ve dealt with groups whoâ€™ve had a fair share of laggards, so I get the position youâ€™re taking."
UCSD,fpexmsg,t1_fpewmay,1588557159.0,"To each their own, no two people will have the same experience. For me, having group mates with 15 hour time differences has really slowed everything down the groups work rate, and itâ€™s been frustrating at times"
