This is a good point, but these are exactly the sort of risks that doctors and nurses willingly take on when entering their fields. First responders shouldn't have to be exposed to the traumatic scene of two drunk drivers crashing head-on on New Year's Eve (including risking their own accident on the way there). Infectious disease is a unique category, because any practitioner knowingly takes a physical health risk (hopefully minimal with correct PPE) when treating their patients. People's negligence lead to their own infectious diseases all the time (anti-vaxxers, [people playing with dead animals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2015/06/23/plague-killed-a-colorado-teen-what-do-you-need-to-know/#3bf28fe355a7), even people going to work sick). Another key reason why healthcare workers don't even think about denying treatment is because they simply do not have the time and resources to make complex moral or legal decisions. In a disease where every hour matters, how much time do you want to spend figuring out whether somebody was acting negligently?

""I wish they could be punished in some way""
