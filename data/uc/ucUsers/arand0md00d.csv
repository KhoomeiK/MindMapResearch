worldnews,fpiq38t,t1_fpidn7s,1588646214.0,"I read some papers that seemed to suggest that the immune response generated to COVID-19 is inappropriately skewed towards IL-6 and that the virus ~~itself inhibits the interferon pathway which would theoretically be the appropriate antiviral pathway~~ (maybe?). I'm haven't seen anything about secondary bacterial infections in recovered COVID-19 patients though that would be a concern if you block IL-6 receptor.

The papers reporting the use of tocilizumab had limited patients that were on it for other reasons before maybe? I haven't seen any preliminary data from the trial, though I think Dr. Fauci alluded to it when he revealed the remdesivir results.

This is all off the top of my head, I could be wrong. I will go back and read them and link them below.

Edit:

Both of these papers say that there is a hypercytokinemia, especially of chemokines and IL-1b, IL-6, though they disagree on whether inteferons go up or down.

worldnews,fozdvfk,t1_foy2870,1588189015.0,"The only evidence we have of 're-infection' we had was positive PCR results from recovered patients. Regardless of the accuracy of the test, PCR will only tell you if the genetic sequence you designed primers for is present or not in the sample you are testing. It does not say anything about the viability of the virus or the ability of it to infect other cells. Severe infections of this nature are not nice neat affairs, they are essentially battlefields with debris and dead stuff everywhere. So it was never clear whether what was positive was alive or dead virus fragments.

If you really wanted to know if those patients with positive PCR tests following recovery had been 're-infected' or capable of spreading it to other people, you would then have to take the sample from that patient and test the viability of the virus. If that sample cannot produce infections in a dish or make animals sick in an animal model of COVID-19 then that sample is not viable, will not be causing infections in that patient and won't be able to spread to others from that person. 

I haven't seen any data that would suggest to me that re-infection is possible. Now all of this requires the patient to form lasting immunity during the initial infection, and so if the patient cannot form immunological memory (immunocompromised pateints etc.) then re-infection will be possible and many of these patients exist. But to say that blanket re-infection is possible is not supported by data right now."

Are you trying to imply that there is no silent transmission and we have found 100% of the people infected by COVID through PCR testing and the true death rate is exactly as described? Because it very obviously isn't. You are just as biased as they are. 

COVID IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THE FLU, however there is clearly a large spread of severity between mild symptoms and severe ARDS. And given the lack of PCR testing we had early on, coupled with the findings of community spread much earlier than we had thought. The true death rate is likely to be lower than is being reported, how much lower remains to be seen. And this study is just one piece of data from **one** part of **one** state of **one** country.

worldnews,fo3vxyn,t1_fo3oc09,1587493851.0,"Flu viruses are much more easily able to mutate than other viruses just by the way their genome is set up. Instead of 1 continuous genome with all of the genes, flu has a segmented genome with each segment containing 1-3 genes with a total of 9(?) segments. In the case where 2 different flu viruses infect the same cell, you can get mixing of these segments into dramatically different strains immediately. 5 segments of 1 and 4 of the other for example. 

Also the enzyme the flu virus uses to replicate its genome is more error prone (leads to more mutations) than the one SARS-CoV-2 uses. 

So those 2 factors make it much more likely for flu viruses to mutate and create new strains than SARS-CoV-2."
