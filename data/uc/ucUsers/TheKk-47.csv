hiphopheads,fpldwtt,t1_fplb4ao,1588710975.0,"I feel like that's simplifying it tbh. For example, I'm okay with Nas because he's not like that anymore. I'm okay with Pun or MJ because they're dead. R. Kelly is in jail so it's not like I'm helping him. Chris Brown has shown no remorse for his actions. I feel like he's the same man he was when he brutally beat Rihanna and he's done nothing to really show me otherwise. I feel like that's a big part of the reason why people shit on Chris Brown or say X (he died before he really had the chance to show change). 

If Chris Brown didn't do more shit like fight Drake or beat up Frank Ocean, threaten violence and get a restraining order by Karreuche, or that whole SWAT team thing on Instagram people probably would've gotten over the Rihanna thing by now. I mean, it's been 11 years, he's just done nothing to allow people to forgive and forget. I don't even think he ever apologized lol. 

I understand how it feels fake, but the situations and the people are different and there's a bunch of different circumstances such as media coverage (everyone knows about CB beating Rihanna but not everyone knows about Nas, Dre, Pun beating women in their lives) or the artist's other actions that play a part in how people respond to them."
hiphopheads,fpl98xn,t1_fpl85sc,1588708607.0,"Lmfao that first sentence is the dumbest shit so Ima just ignore it.

Now that is a completely different conversation. I'm replying to a guy that doesn't care about listening to abusers and I'm assuming you don't care either, which is completely fine but I found trouble with him being annoyed by people limiting it.

If a vegan is saying stop eating meat, or in this case a listener that avoids all abusers is saying don't listen to any abusers that's a different story and is a completely fair criticism even if moral grandstanding can get a little annoying. The meat industry does suck and abusers in the entertainment industry suck too. They shouldn't be supported but it's tough to avoid it when it's been your way of life since birth and there's so many at the top of the industry. 

So if you're one of those people that don't listen to any abusers and wants to criticize go for it. I just highly doubt you are so refer to what I said above."

> It's kind of like someone decides they're going to limit meat intake because the meat industry abuses their workers and animals. Then you say they're a hypocrite for still eating meat and they should just go vegan and not be so selective and fake about it.

> There's so damn many and I grew up listening to abusive people it's hard to cut it all out, I'm never not going to eat meat or not listen to an abusive person, but the more I can limit the better even if I'm a hypocrite I still feel like I'm doing more of the right thing."

I agree with what you're saying. The Drake co-sign is incredibly powerful. I'm just saying that that isn't people ""emulating"" Drake. There aren't a ton of songs or artists I hear and can say ""Wow that's biting Drake,"" or ""This sounds like whatever Drake song"" He emulates others and brings those styles to a larger audience."

In those cases he was emulating others, not getting emulated. And he also is not the biggest ambassador or face of rap right now. He is seen more of a pop star than a rap star by the world and he would probably consider himself more pop than rap now too.

survivor,fp5pw84,t1_fp42ruo,1588337056.0,"When did Tony get close to getting voted out premerge, he didn't get a single vote and the person who targeted him, Sandra, was immediately voted out for overplaying hard. Kim lost her alliance early and was at the bottom of the tribe. She was way closer to going out than him.

Tony's threat size was bigger than Kim's imo because of the way he played. He's a wildcard, no winner wants to put faith into a wildcard. Nobody wants to be in a tribe and wonder if he's making a spy shack or hunting for idols at 4 am. Kim's win was more dominant but she plays a much less flashy and paranoid game than Tony so she's someone you can actually work with without feeling on edge all the time. I don't see how Game Changers really reduced anything, he was only targeted by Sandra right before the merge specifically because of that season. 

I have no idea how his premerge was worse than hers when he didn't receive any votes like her, did not get to the bottom of the tribe like her, didn't lose close allies like her, and he came into merge stronger due to a strong premerge. What did Kim do that was better? She played UTR after she got knocked to the bottom of the tribe, and she wasn't targeted because she was alone at the bottom and no longer a threat. None of the moves she made premerge even worked and telling Sophie about her idol was stupid as Sophie said. Tony played UTR while not being at the bottom and fostering good relationships and staying in the majority with no incorrect votes. He successfully hid the Cops r Us alliance as well.

I think GC helped him adapt for sure but it didn't help his threat level directly. His threat level was high because he won Cagayan playing a flashy, untrustworthy, paranoid game.

Tony I didn't find to be extremely lucky premerge. The tribe won comps and he did very well to change his game style and adapt to manage his threat level. He played a good UTR social game where people really liked enjoyed his company and he didn't overplay like Sandra so he didn't get bopped by Denise. I don't really see what's especially lucky about his premerge than most other good players. And even if it was lucky, that's the game and he did well with his luck.

Idk, I've seen people lose their allies and be shit in early premerge and they usually end up fine because why vote them out. She was alone and there was bigger fish to fry. She did well on the bottom but she survived mostly because nobody felt like targeting her when she was alone.

I disagree, I'd say Rob, Sandra, Parv, Tony at least had bigger targets coming in. She didn't really maneuver herself that well in premerge, she got carried then once she got into a good position it was all down hill from that bad idol play onwards.

I don't really see how Tony living because of the tribe immunity win is relevant to her not really playing that great this season. He played a great premerge where he modified his game and played a great UTR social game. His target was so huge coming in his name would only come up because of that. If anybody maneuvered premerge best it was Tony (and Denise)

I don't really see how anyone can say she played extremely well. What did she accomplish this whole season besides just surviving? Premerge was bad and she got dragged as a bottom alliance vote. She did well to start climbing her way back up and getting an immunity, then once she got control she was thoroughly outplayed by Tony and she got voted out because her relationships with Ben and Nick weren't strong enough."

Premerge was a mess that she really only survived afterwards because she was alone and no longer a threat. She does well gaining trust and relationships UTR but then she just got absolutely outplayed by Tony the last few votes and makes more crucial mistakes.

A bad idol play she almost went out for (and ultimately cost her because she didn't have it tonight) 

Trusting Ben and scheming before immunity

Stepping down from immunity for peanut butter and cookies when she had no guarantee about her safety and/or other side having idols. She was going for her riskiest move yet and thought it was okay to not at least try harder to be safe?

I'd say out of the current top Next genners (Kyrgios, Med, Coric, Stef, Zverev, Khachanov, Rublev, Berrentini) who should be hitting their peaks soon, Med has the best shot. If he is mentally stable which we saw last summer, his game is just as solid as Novak's but with an elite serve, he's insane. If he could maintain that form at least for slams every now and then, I could see him getting 10+

Nadal is by far #1 on clay, but I don't consider him top 5 grass, and potentially not even top 5 on hard.

For me I still see him as the GOAT. I don't care about personal things like this when it comes to the debate. I'm sure all of these guys in all sorts of sports have some quack opinions or have done dumb stuff, if it's not cheating/fixing or doping it doesn't affect their achievements in the sport. LeBron is still GOAT (or tied with MJ whatever) even with the recent China issue, and Tiger is still GOAT despite being a scummy cheater. Neither are relevant to what they accomplished in the sport and I think the same for Novak. 

Also I don't think a 2 or 3 slam deficit is a big deal. It's not even a year worth of slams. LeBron vs MJ is a big debate and that's 3 vs 6 rings (it's a team sport so I get it's different but the principle of there being other factors is the same). He has way more masters and he was going to have most weeks at #1 before this damn virus lol. I also believe he accomplished most of this in a harder era (Big 4 era).

survivor,fnk6s1v,t1_fnjz5dq,1587016678.0,I mean all you did was summarize what we've seen then make an assumption on Nick and Michelle's allegiances. We have 0 clue why Nick and Michelle aligned with who they aligned and voted the way they did because we didn't see it. All it would take is some scenes of them talking/being recruited. Double agent is such a rare play I feel like they would have shown that as it would be entertaining so I don't think that happened. Them not showing what happened is because EoE takes up time. I'm definitely disappointed with the edit this season.

whowouldwin,fna9jb1,t1_fn9xwpb,1586793542.0,I've been reading One Piece for years and I've never really been impressed with Luffy's strengths. Reading his respect thread nothing pops out as something that will put Garou down without question.
smashbros,fn9jiim,t1_fn9j1se,1586775401.0,Thanks!
smashbros,fn9e1nh,t3_g0ax58,1586769344.0,Is there a bracket anywhere?
whowouldwin,fn9c23d,t1_fn9a466,1586767109.0,"I'll give you Luffy being stronger, Garou really doesn't have the strength feats yet tho I'm sure from scaling he should still be more than capable in that department as he can take down S tier heroes and demons solo.

But I think you're underestimating Garou post Genos fight. His speed and durability along with his technique and stamina/endurance surpass that of Luffys imo. Just look at his fights against Rover and Orochi.

https://ww3.one-punchman.com/manga/one-punch-man-chapter-92/

Seriously read these two chapters, realize this is back to back no rest, and he's already injured to begin with against Rover. Yet he's able to dodge a barrage of Rover blasts and Orochi's horns no problem. He also catches multiple bullets from Death Gatling pre Genos fight where Gatling has been stated to shoot 6000 rounds per minute. He tanks every one of those hits as well until the end. I really don't know what Luffy has that will actually put Garou down. Guy doesn't stay down.

I think he can hurt Luffy with counter attacks and redirecting Luffys force against him the same way Ussop did with impact dials."
