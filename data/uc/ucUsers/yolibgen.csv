I hope it's restored soon, shit was so convenient and helpful for so many of us."

UCI,fp1f74w,t1_fp073y2,1588233485.0,"Damn, I'm sorry that you're stuck in that environment. I somewhat have the same problem, though luckily the coronavirus has made her tone it down a lot so far. 

I realized a long time ago that I couldn't come out to my family, at least not until I could escape/was safe. At first it hurt, but I've begun to feel that I'm losing nothing if I rarely talk to them once I get out the door. I can build a support network through friends, hopefully. 

I'm sorry to hijack this thread, I've just worrying about everything a lot and being forced out has been scaring me. I wish this shit ends soon."

UCI,fo1uy6k,t1_fo1q2zl,1587442078.0,"maybe I'm mistaken, but I've heard proctor U is able to change settings/have remote access? And respondus needing admin permission puts me off (I'm no laptop expert but I've been told to be wary of those that do). The fact that it seems to fuck up and blocks the ability to shutdown like damn wtf.

In conclusion both are total shit"

investing,fmlwgwg,t3_fvxq1r,1586194480.0,"Does anyone know about what the tax situation would be for Airbus shares? Based off [adr.com](https://ads.com), for past dividend payments there's been a dividend fee and withholding amount. From my understanding, the withholding amount is similar to a foreign tax payment, so I wouldn't have to pay an additional foreign tax, correct? Thanks!"
stocks,fmlmsxa,t3_fvuswy,1586189450.0,"Does anyone know what the tax situation would be for Airbus dividends? Was thinking of buying a few shares but I'm confused about if I'd have to pay foreign taxes or not. Thanks!

Additional q: looking at adr.com, I can see from past dividend payments there's a withholding amount and a dividend fee (nothing for tax reclamation fees). From my understanding, the withholding amount is akin to paying foreign taxes right?"
investing,fm8ktup,t3_ftl8vm,1585851198.0,"Would like some opinions on fractional shares. I'm planning to buy a few through Schwab's stock bundle, and am thinking between DIS, JNJ, V, MA, PYPL (want to pick 2-3). Not planning to dump a lot into this, likely 100ish depending on how much leftover I have, as I'm planning to grab a few more shares of VTI. 

Which would you recommend? Thanks"
