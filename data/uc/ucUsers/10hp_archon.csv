berkeley,fpn2pqq,t1_fpmfrxh,1588748385.0,"this is indeed a good place to asks - i'd go with option 2, as air is so much more portable for college. if you truly need computing power, (running certain ipython notebooks), usually the course will show you how to run things on the cloud like AWS or use Google Colab.

i'm sure other cs majors will chime in too :)"
berkeley,fpiorm0,t3_gdmyy6,1588645391.0," ""If we tried, right now, to run a mixed effects linear regression on all the Data in the world, it would take approximately 15 BILLION YEARS. If we put ALL our Data in the clouds we can run 15 billion linear regressions in 1 seconds on all the data in the world. This is because C code compiles faster in higher elevations, so by getting our data higher, we can reach new levels of computability.

The More Linear Regressions The more answers we get, and I truly believe we can cure cancer this way."""

berkeley,fp55l4l,t3_gb84pk,1588317060.0,"Take Stat 140. Doesn't matter that Adhikari isn't teaching it, all the foundations are there and the staff will ensure the course is run smoothly. Especially that you've taken Data8, and presumably are interested in Data Science or Computer Science, 140 is a no brainer. Both classes will prepare you well for the latter half of CS70

Essentially, 140 was made to be the modern day 134, and if you have any coding experience it is precisely how you would want to be learning basic probability."

berkeley,fp0obvq,t3_gamwrz,1588213369.0,"sometimes they teach too fast in cs70, resulting in overloaded number of topics to learn and artificial difficulty.

you could try looking at prob140's free online textbook http://prob140.org/textbook/Chapter_15/01_Density_and_CDF.html

they cover similar material as cs70 (with a bit more care) and it helped me a lot."
