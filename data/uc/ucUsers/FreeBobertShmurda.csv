UCSantaBarbara,foyaja1,t3_ga8nam,1588168881.0,"10A difficulty overrated imo. I came into this school thinking I was going to hate it, but itâ€™s my favorite Econ class so far. Solving the MT practice problems is like a puzzle. Youâ€™re given like 14 practice midterms for each MT, youâ€™ll be fine. Just do them and take note of your weakness. Go to office hours, CLAS, and TSC tutoring."

UCSantaBarbara,fovt01q,t3_g9v3r1,1588107004.0,"While UCSB recruits more heavily in terms of accounting, I know a few people who manages to get big 4 offers from Cal Poly.

I think UCSB will prepare a lot more because the courses are pretty hard."
