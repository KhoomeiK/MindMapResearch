funny,fpkqkxo,t1_fpkf97g,1588699314.0,Employment rate doesn’t mean mean anything in this comic. It’s focusing on already having a job yet staying stagnant in wage and title after years of loyalty to the company.
LongDistance,fpjpczc,t3_gds6ng,1588676883.0,My boyfriend and I have been waiting 2 years to see each other. Trip got cancelled last year due to some unfortunate familial circumstances and we’re both students with different break schedules so we rescheduled for this summer but it might not go on due to covid :/

mildlyinfuriating,fpjigtu,t1_fpjhfft,1588669730.0,"I agree it’s not a one president issue— it’s an entire government issue. America is a democracy with a Congress and all, the president cannot just will for there to be universal healthcare or anything similar if he so likes.

If you knew anything about modern American government, you would understand that just one clog can screw an entire system up. ACA was filibustered so hard by a single senator that it came close to not passing. Obama had to jump through so many hoops for it to pass, and by then it was a watered down version of the original bill. 

Anyhow what I’m trying to say is that you can’t blame a large portion of Americans for not having universal healthcare, not then and not now. I sure as hell did not vote for Trump, and neither did I vote for the other buffoon senators  in other states (which I have no control over anyways.) a large portion of Americans want universal healthcare and it’s unfortunate that we are represented by the minority that is Trump and his hardcore followers. Go ahead and blame government inefficiency.  Blame the winner take all system. But do not blame the 48% of Americans who are so apparently being misrepresented in your eyes."
mildlyinfuriating,fpjfnao,t1_fpjfiwy,1588666734.0,I don’t know what you’re arguing. I’m merely saying that wanting healthcare reform isn’t an outlier. The majority of Americans want it based on voting records.
mildlyinfuriating,fpjd4oc,t1_fpjbvfb,1588664194.0,"46.1% of Americans out of 55% of eligible voters voted for Trump, meaning that in total, a whopping 25.3% of American voters can clearly and intelligibly communicate that they wanted Trump. 

Edit: He did not win the popular vote. There are many, many more people who would love to reform the healthcare system than you think."
politics,fpj4vvy,t1_fpilvgo,1588656682.0,"It reaallly depends on what state you live in. States were given the choice to expand the ACA but unfortunately many of them decided not to. I’m lucky to live in a state where Obamacare is half the cost of yours. Still pricey? Definitely, but all insurance is and I’m glad it’s not $400.

I feel really bad about your situation. I hope you find a job that covers your healthcare or make more money to get private, as long as the healthcare system remains broken as it is."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fp44rjn,t1_fp3i8l0,1588291668.0,"I apologize if I have more empathy for the common person than you. I feel as if a few petty mistakes, especially ones made while we’re young, shouldn’t practically guarantee a life of living paycheck to paycheck. Frankly this isn’t a discussion about getting free money but rather one of “Why are so many Americans paid so little in the first place?” and “Why does merely $600 cause many Americans to WANT to stay unemployed?”

I brought up college and other circumstances because we cannot look at things in black and white. The world is simply not about making mistakes or being deserving of money. Should plain hard work and decent choices in America truly equate to a good life then I know many people who would be deserving of one yet they don’t receive it, and I also know many people who haven’t done much yet are richer than gold. 

And I do have the ability to pay my bills, luckily. I am fortunate and lucky to have the ability to truly live in this world to my heart’s content but it was not always like that. I used to work at Walmart and I had many, many associates of great character and decency, all hard workers yet their cards in life simply weren’t dealt in their favor. Knew a poor girl who was immunocompromised, extremely hard working but always called out sick because that was simply how her body was built and eventually was let go for missing days of work. Can you say she does not deserve anything?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fp1jwo0,t1_fp12ptf,1588238039.0,"Can we stop with this shit mentality already? Do you really think that every single American has the privilege of obtaining a better or more decent paying job whenever they feel like it?

“Oh, you never went to college because you couldn’t afford it so now you can’t pay the bills with a stagnant job in retail? Well maybe you should have reconsidered growing up poor.”

“Oh, you went to trade school and had a decent job in construction but was diagnosed with a condition that leaves you predisposed to injury on the job and now you work as a secretary? Well maybe you should have reconsidered when you decided to be born without good genes.”

“Oh, you naively had a child at a young age and now have no time to go back to school so you’re working as a supervisor of a small company? Well you reap what you sow. You have NO right to complain whatsoever. Should have thought before opening your legs.”

“Oh, you were arrested for petty theft at the age of 18 and now you can only get hired at low wage jobs? Well, maybe you should have realized that a single stupid event at a young age would define your entire adult life and career before you stole that bag of skittles.”

Really it’s a blinding, ignorant and extremely un empathetic mindset you have. Not everyone is fortunate enough to simply change jobs."
VietNam,fozamsq,t1_foz6p30,1588187466.0,"Sorry if I sounded aggressive in the post, I don’t think anything bad of the communities in the USA, I grew up very practically in it as a Vietnamese American myself  and just wanted to know what Natives thought of it :)"
UCI,fnrxowm,t1_fnrsonp,1587205605.0,Oops! I checked a lot of schools so I’m probably getting numbers confused. Some school out there is getting $39 mil !  lol
UCI,fnrrnxj,t1_fnpfs9z,1587198992.0,"Hi,

I got the 39 mil mixed up with UCLA. I saw a master list of the amount of $$ given to each school (the one you linked) a few days ago and was looking at the numbers of different schools. UCLA is getting 39 mil, UCI is getting 36 mil. 

I forgot where I received that information and lost the master list so I created a post asking for details/if anyone knows anything about how UCI will allocate the money. I did admit in my post that I was not 100% sure of what the exact figure is. I was one of the first people to post about the CARE Acts in the UCI subreddit, so I didn't have any other posts I could rely off of."
AmItheAsshole,fnm0bfj,t1_fnlzllg,1587062857.0,"Honestly I agree, but in a different sense. The sister is the one who is making life hard for everyone. OP was generous and let her use the switch even before she created the commissioned drawings. But the sister never delivered and then it seems like she blew her top and lashed out (“She said she didn’t want to draw shit...”) which is why OP reacted so strongly by taking away the switch. 

I feel as if OP letting her sister play with the switch is the better option in the long run, but what are we teaching people then? That they should just bend over backwards when someone doesn’t uphold their part of the deal? I don’t know how long or how much effort needs to be put into 3-4 drawings but it’d be very simple fix if OP’s sister just made them..."
AmItheAsshole,fnkl44z,t1_fnkl0zl,1587031208.0,A 14 year old is a high school student. They aren’t the children you make them out to be. Yes we can’t expect them to be financially responsible like adults but they should have more insight than elementary kids
dataisbeautiful,fnbyoff,t1_fnbrt1e,1586824973.0,$400 a month for food is actually pretty high for only 1 person. He could probably easily lower it to $250 if he only eats out 1-2 times per month.
IsItBullshit,fn2g4x9,t1_fn27yco,1586587808.0,It can be reversed. It's generally better and easier to gradually lay of porn than quit cold turkey. Over time your brain will compensate for the new/lower levels of dopamine that you produce from slowly quitting porn.
worldnews,fmytuqt,t1_fmypqt7,1586495592.0,"Helping yourself though is quite debatable in this argument. Domestic production is almost always better in the long run for a country as long as they have the resources on hand. But on the flip side, letting products be manufactured in China nearly guarantees low cost items that that many, many Americans rely on, and those in poverty most likely will not be able to afford products if they shift manufacturing back into America in the short run. These are two different viewpoints of ""helping yourself"" for the same topic.

In which case, saying you want to ""hurt China"" is indicative of the first viewpoint-- that we should pull production back into America."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fmytap8,t3_fy39eq,1586495113.0,"I accidentally did it once. I was like 14, super bored and painted my face using leftover halloween make up for the hell of it. Didn't show anyone except for a few close friends.  I also accidentally committed red-face, brown face and yellow face the same day."
news,fmvfdsg,t1_fmv2fi7,1586415070.0,"Completely depends on your state. Most resources right now are in NY, CA, LA, FL, NJ and WA, the hardest hit states. Also depends on the time. Two weeks ago, we could only test people in the ICU. Yesterday we tested nearly 100,000, even those who displayed no symptoms and were only near someone with covid-19."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fmvehke,t1_fmut51m,1586414211.0,"WIT is under IG Port so they should be relatively fine financially. They're small but they work very closely with a much larger and sustainable company. However yeah, there might be some delays in the release of S4 and in the other shows they're producing due to COVID-19."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fmvebqf,t1_fmv6vlu,1586414055.0,"We don't know for sure but there's a lot of speculation based on a few points. One, it's been confirmed that the director, producers, and several key animators are working on S4. Animators almost never move studios once they become high ranking (i.e very skilled & very important) so it's more likely that they are just being transferred to another studio under the IG Port (WIT studio is included in that port).

Two, AOT is a massive money maker in Japan and no way that IG is going to dump it off right after one of the best seasons so far. They aren't struggling financially (compared to other studios) so they can continue to produce it.

Three, next season is the final season of AOT, and it'd be crazy dumb to not give it a proper send off, especially with all the things happening in the manga right now. If the director wanted to maintain the greatness of AOT, then it'd actually make sense to move to IG Productions since they have bigger teams, more resources, more connections, more money, etc. In my opinion, WIT Studio is an absolutely amazing studio but it may be a little too much for them to continue on AOT, especially since WIT Studio said that creating AOT has been grueling for them as far back as season 1."
shittyfoodporn,fmqu85b,t3_fwmi57,1586307166.0,Putting mushrooms into meatballs and pretending it's coronavirus is beyond ironic for me personally because it turns out that the mushrooms used in most of my county's local restaurants had been contaminated with coronavirus. My family hasn't eaten them in nearly a month because we're scared.
funny,fmqtr8s,t1_fmqldw4,1586306874.0,Imo watching Tiger King was like listening to gossip or watching true crime. We enjoy watching him because he's an interesting person. Not trying to justify his shitty behavior  but just offering a reason why he became famous.
HomeworkHelp,fmqt6au,t1_fmqi0q7,1586306514.0,i'm a tutor for 1st-2nd graders and most of them can actually read/write fairly well in terms of communicative vocabulary. i don't doubt this post *could* have been made by a 7 year old.
HomeworkHelp,fmqt09n,t1_fmqbdu8,1586306410.0,"When I was 7, I was also making accounts/emails etc and posting comments on Youtube by myself. Imo it was actually easier to learn how to use the internet when I was younger than today. And reddit is actually not that difficult to learn to use. I would imagine there's a small percentage of children who can use the internet and communicate fairly well; not many, but a small percentage for sure."
