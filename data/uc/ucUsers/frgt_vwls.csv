berkeley,foob3bi,t1_fonyrh9,1587935856.0,You’re welcome to take your 3rd paragraph to one of the other threads talking abt point A! I was only addressing your parent comment so I have no comment on this :)
berkeley,fonxb2i,t1_fonvbic,1587928303.0,"Okay, I can see where your comment is coming from if you just read the raw semantics of OP’s words. However, since you probably don’t share similar lived experience as OP and many women (perhaps some men too), you may have missed the ethos of what it’s like to be in OP’s shoes — just tryna have a “normal” platonic classmate relationship without ulterior motives.

Also trust me there are ways to be hit on that are respectful (for lack of better word I can think of rn) and ways that are not, and I get the feeling OP did not have humanizing experiences. I’m not gonna go into it tho bc I don’t have the energy to explain 😕"
berkeley,fonq7ju,t1_fommmcw,1587924328.0,"It’s one thing to be hit on, it’s another to cross boundaries that OP set and act entitled to OP’s attention, as it sounds happened."
berkeley,fomntla,t3_g8an1k,1587897179.0,"God damn I’m sorry :(

Also to point C — fuck those guys who can’t get a hint and feel so entitled to people’s attention 🙅🏻‍♀️"
piercing,fhqldlc,t3_f4dcc2,1581806261.0,"My piercer used a receiving tube to guide the needle (12 gauge), and the actual piercing HURT for a few seconds -- but as soon as the jewelry slid in, the pain subsided and it was just sore.

There may be bleeding for a few days. Might be nice to prepare a panty liner for at least your first 24 hrs after piercing.

It may be uncomfortable to walk around for several days, as your piercing chafes against your pants while it's initially healing and while you get used to having some extra metal down there. However, some people report not feeling anything after getting the piercing so I guess it depends on your body!
