dankmemes,fnrjfax,t3_g3harx,1587190836.0,"my oh my, they are still saying that when the majority of other countries are unfortunately reporting increasing numbers by the week..."

UCI,fng2l9h,t1_fnfhjel,1586920844.0,That's what I was thinking too... I am quite worried for her now :/
UCI,fng292l,t1_fn76ndc,1586920625.0,That's horrible they are doing that... Why would they want anyone else to get sick with such a disease?
UCI,fng2532,t3_g06bky,1586920554.0,"Hi! I would suggest you go to UCI first, as transferring from a state uni to a UC system is quite hard. Just join clubs and chat with classmates, and be active in your classes. Good luck!"
UCI,fng1qbh,t3_g0cuhn,1586920280.0,"Camino is nice, they have nice amenities and a cozy townhome environment. Plaza Verde is a more modern hotel-like feel. It depends on the person. After you sign your lease, you should be very specific about any of the issues with the building. They are very sharp with any small speck they find. Also, be specific about the type of roommates (like temperament, hobbies, sound level, major, etc) you would like to be with. Write it all down, it helps them organize things better. Write your sleep schedule or any details you like, it all helps :) Stay safe!"
UCI,fng13q4,t3_g0c8g5,1586919869.0,"UCI has a very good program and the professors are very attentive :) The first quarter you will be here, be prepared to take some summer classes for some classes you may not get into. (They give priority registration to your majors to major-specific classes to Juniors and Seniors).  Don't worry about it too much, you should have an easy time getting into your classes :>  Congratulations on getting in!"
