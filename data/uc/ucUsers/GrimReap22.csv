Freezing,fo8y60q,t1_fo87mcb,1587606333.0,"Yeah, I just heard that this author has already two manga's that he's started previously and never finished and the longest hiatus he's ever taken before for this manga was four months. 

An considering the last chapter he's released has been well over a year ago. I've been getting worried because I don't think it needs more than 2-3 arcs to finish it. 

I think that he shot himself in the foot for trying to take this plot in a million different places without having an underlying consistent theme for the manga. It honestly would be a shame if he didn't finish it considering he's been working on this for over a decade!!!

If he's not going to finish it he should allow someone else to give it a proper ending."
