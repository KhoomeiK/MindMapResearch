pcgaming,fmzq22o,t1_fmzphbh,1586527084.0,"I don't disagree, but that wasn't the point I was making. What I mean is that a company--even a company with the bankroll of Epic or ActiBlizz--will struggle to be able to ""bully"" a game into the esports scene.

We've seen throughout the lifetimes of esports like HOTS and OW and PUBG and Fortnite and Lawbreakers and Evolve and Paladins that sure, you can do something new and dump investor money into a scene but if it's not a game that the *community* (not just the streamers like Shroud or summit, who are always at the top of the new hype games as they're coming out) is willing to engage with long term then it will never develop a real successful esports scene.

I would like to use the OWL as a specific example: buy ins for league spots were millions of dollars, and no one cares about the OWL anymore. Players--not investors--are what drive the competitive market, and I don't think that the presently hugely inflated view numbers on twitch indicate that this game has any legs."
pcgaming,fmzhm2r,t1_fmzfny2,1586520659.0,"You mean cocky indie companies like Activision-Blizzard, who failed at bringing games like HOTS and Overwatch (which had 7 *million* players in its first week) into the esports market? Or a game like Fortnite (supported by Epic, another gigantic company) that was supported by the biggest notable streamers and pros on the planet and is now propped up by disproportionate prize pools?

I think that the esports market is very fickle, and while Riot absolutely has a huge pool of players invested in MOBA games, is there really that much overlap between LoL and a short TTK arena shooter reminiscent of CSGO? Will the players who are now playing CSGO be willing to move to a new game after playing CS for so long? I have my doubts.

It would be the safe bet to say that this game is another version of the Next Big Thing that becomes wildly popular for about a year or two and then just... falls off the face of the earth as the full-time streamers start seeing dropping view counts."
pcgaming,fmzh652,t3_fydt32,1586520244.0,">CSGO has had souvenir drops for years but I have never seen anyone complain about that...

I've definitely seen complaints about it in the past on both hltv and reddit.

[Valve even changed the souvenir drop system](
https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6114-IPXN-8770)  last year so that purchasing a ""pass"" was required for the major enabled drops, making viewbotting uneconomic."
