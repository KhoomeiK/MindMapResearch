Look at some of the numbers other people have posted- its not about 1 or 2 more representatives, its about how many people they each represent. If one representative has 200,000+ more constituents then another, then those 200,000 extra people do not have equal representation in the House.

Those extra 200,000 people have almost equal representation.  The discrepancy is usually a few percent.  

Also, the discrepancy is random.  A state that currently has their number of representatives rounded down might get theirs rounded up after the next census.  Some ""blue"" states will be rounded up, some will be rounded down.  Same with ""red"" states.  It's not like the senate, where there is a systematic bias in favor of one side of the political spectrum.

> The Senate for all its flaws was made in order to allow equal representation of states despite population. 

That is true, but remember that the senate was not intended to represent the people.  Senators were appointed by state legislatures, and were meant to look after the interest of state governments. 

> Considering it was established at a time when there was very little sense of national unity and there was a lot less mobility between areas of the country, I think its become a weight around the neck of American society and it cannot accurately represent the nation. But it wasn’t really built to, and it would be incredibly difficult to change. Pragmatically, I don’t see how you can except by splitting up larger states like CA, NY, TX etc. so that populations are more equal across the board, and I doubt that will happen anytime soon.

I don't think splitting up larger states will happen, and remember that splitting a state would require congressional approval, so small rural states could easily block that as well.
