victoria2,fp6jbvz,t3_gbeld6,1588353323.0,"In my unification game as S-P in vanilla I was stuck in the same situation as you. Pretty much how I approached this was to sphere every Italian minor so I could ally them, or at the very least, avoid having to fight them. With an important one-front war, I mobilized before declaring, and built my professional soldier division of hussars and artillery only (so if you can mobilize 10 divisions and build 10, I had 10 mobilized infantry and 2 professional hussars/8 professional artillery).

Since the AI is programmed to spread its troops among its lands, when you declare war (selecting a good general on your main stack), you have to quickly wait at the border and stack wipe any incoming Austrian stacks (which on their own will be smaller than your 20 divisions, pursue even the small 3k mobilized stacks to prevent them from coalescing). Once you see their military score is sufficiently lower than yours, you can start besieging provinces, which your allies will already have started doing for you. 

Don't worry too much about the UK, the naval AI is poor and as long as you have ~10 man of wars you should be able to counter any transports they send. For some reason, in one of my Greece games where I was allied to the UK, they never sent their 50+ squadrons of heavy ships into the Mediterranean to fight the Ottomans, they just perpetually sat at Southampton dock."

victoria2,foeh3r3,t1_foc7rla,1587703622.0,"Thanks for the counterpoint in the beginning there. Possibly (now this is getting idealistic) the puppets, upon release, retain and gain any resource extraction techs and that's it? While I don't have much knowledge on colonial adminstration, I would assume the European powers only cared about resources and markets for trade balance purposes, and to hell with the governance of the people. Implementing this with some drawbacks such as flat (or negative) growth rate would be neat"
berkeley,foe38t7,t3_g6xhyh,1587695143.0,"I'll be the first to rant about Berkeley's, and the Bay area's suffocating NIMBYism, but the proposed building height is simply obscene. From an environmental design perspective, I think any way they execute the building would still make it an eyesore and would alienate the neighborhood itself.

If anything this building height proposal is likely the developers coming in with a high offer. This way, when it gets negotiated down to let's say, the height of Unit 2, it'll be seen as a ""win"" for NIMBYs, but in reality it's the building height the developers/University were eyeing anyways."
berkeley,foe28gn,t1_foe1gah,1587694598.0,"Please quote when I said the very fact of the University holding remote lectures is bad. While it's a ""huge offer"" - I'll agree, if there were no classes at all, that would be ridiculous - the University is refusing to reduce tuition for a comparatively *poorer* offer. At the end of the day I don't understand why complaining about that fact is ""entitled and bratty."" 

Is it realistic for the University to reduce tuition? Of course not, it's snatching for pennies when there's no global pandemic - it's going to be hemorrhaging money now as it had been before Christ's improvements. Is it justified to be pissed, nevertheless? I think so. Is it justified to want to not take remote classes next semester to avoid this convenient, but still inferior offer? Yes, and not bratty."
berkeley,foe0xtw,t1_fodtfqm,1587693883.0,"I'll agree that remote lecture cuts out a lot of downtime between classes where it's too short to walk home and do something else productive. However, this is but a trifle. 

My main point was sure, you can listen to a lecture online and that doesn't drastically alter the learning format of just being talked at, but for other classes, remote instruction just doesn't do them justice. For myself, this includes physics 7B (missed lab component) and environmental design 1 (where in-person site studies in Oakland are/were crucial to the semester-long project). I don't see how this is bratty - experiential learning is key for some people and in other cases, critical to the study of a subject. 

Furthermore, on the notion that ""there are programs that are remote for grad school at Berkeley and other institutions and they need to be paid for"" - the whole principle in these is that they are *planned* remote programs. When choosing a grad school, this is something that is known upfront and can be weighed among the factors of quality of education vs. price when choosing where to go to grad school. In this case, when choosing Berkeley as a the undergraduate program they would go to, students, and especially OOS students, factored that the quality of education justified the cost of attending here. If they had known in May of their high school senior year that one, and possibly two or three semesters would be taught remotely, some might have decided that this is not worth the cost and would have attended a different university. The cost/benefit equation has changed away from what the student expected. Therefore, it's completely justified for the student to wish for a reduction in tuition, or at they very least, bitch about it on reddit. Likewise, the desire of withdrawing for one semester to avoid this expectation/reality mismatch of services rendered is also justifiable."
berkeley,fodseh1,t1_fodpzzi,1587689250.0,"People aren't confused, they take offense at the disconnect of paying money for a Berkeley education (which is normally in person) and instead receiving remote instruction, which is an objectively poorer learning experience. Sure, the piece of paper you will get handed at the end of four years stays the same, but what you gained along the way is measurably less."
victoria2,fo7c8lj,t1_fo6oqa7,1587575868.0,"I checked the decision, it's 50% progress and 20% literacy or just 75% literacy. The former isn't too bad, but I had released Sudan much earlier because when I had inherited it from Egypt, as the later had already civilized - I didn't want states in sub-saharan Africa. In the 20+ years they were my subject, they haven't taken the decision, and when I tag switched to them, they were sitting on 20,000 civilization points and the AI apparently wasn't choosing to take reforms. Furthermore, when you do take the decision, the nation starts out with no tech (and has a actively poor tech school and national value) which is worse because RGO production still ends up being decreased and won't change measurably.

It seems HPM implemented this poorly, skewing the costs/benefits to the point where it makes no sense to release the nations as dominions instead of directly administrating them. As for how historical it is, I think if you had released the nation outright as independent it would make sense, but if one installs a puppet government to simply make administration easier (and raise the % of clerks in the population of the home country for tech), the technology of the colonising nation should still be preserved.

More food for thought, is when I dismantled the British empire, among their African colonies that were released, Southern Rhodesia ended up civilized immediately.  Upon tag switching to them, their techs seemed to be the same ones as the United Kingdom's. What's causing the difference?"
victoria2,fo65m1o,t1_fo5z3kh,1587547378.0,"I don't think that works, I released Nigeria in 1918, tag switched to check their literacy, it's over 50%. Still releases as a primitive nation, see screenshot.

victoria2,fo1l8nt,t1_fo1jqj4,1587435740.0,"Yeah while I would've wanted to keep my republic (for flavor purposes, really), I ended up switching back to a monarchy, abolished the Fueros, and had the Carlists Pacified event around 1880."
victoria2,fo1dkq0,t1_fo1av0n,1587430978.0,"Also just found out apparently you can't Abolish the Fueros as a Republic - could you confirm this? However, I would still choose the republic at the Glorious Revolution because eventually you get the Restoration of the Bourbons event, but skipping the deposition of Isabella's son/Prince of Savoy/Prince of Hohenzollern"
victoria2,fo17fp2,t3_g50axe,1587427289.0,"I'm literally in the same position as you right now.

Currently I'm in the 1870s and things haven't been too bad - pretty much I've disassociated myself from Continental wars and politics and have exclusively focused on battering the Qing into oblivion. So far the rebellions have been comparable to an average vicky nation.

Where things did go south is I pursued the event in 1864 that allows you to puppet in your former South American colonies. I racked up a great deal of war exhaustion and debt, and subsequently had mass rebellions of 200 brigades every 3 years. Adding to the vicious cycle of militancy -> Carlist cells -> militancy was the war exhaustion (and militancy) from seiged rebel provinces. The game became unplayable by 1890, when I fell to Carlists (at last!).

I went back and decided not to war in South America (having puppets there at the end of the day is useless compared to the riches of Africa - I don't need more wheat, livestock, and grain) and have 3x60k brigades in Spain to quickly wipe out possible rebellions. Chose to become the republic at the Glorious Revolution event (earlier I chose Hohenzollern and he got promptly deposed, adding to unrest) and by spamming election events you should be able to get the Union Liberal in power, which is a conservative party with state capitalism and pro military. 

Had played Spain in vanilla before but was not expecting this charlie foxtrot. At the end of the day what makes Victoria II rebels so vicious is unlike EU4, where they don't rise up for ~5 years after their rebellion, my militant socialists are *relentless*. Which is historical, I guess."
