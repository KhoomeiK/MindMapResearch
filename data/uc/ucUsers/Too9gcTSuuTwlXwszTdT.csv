UCSC,fp548zu,t3_gb8vye,1588315800.0,I was working in Engineering 2 when they were filming. My office (actual software developers) would look out and see the actors (pretend software developers) shooting a scene. It was as funny as it sounds.

It's unlikely, but if you are caught, you are subject to fine.

> Would i get in trouble for that?

If you are caught, you would be found in violation of the statewide stay-at-home order. I recommend that you save your visit for another time."
UCSC,fnwprqr,t3_g4d25s,1587323038.0,"CSE100 is a ton of work, *and* you should be structuring the rest of your classes around only taking 1-2 upper five divs per quarter. 

But yes, CSE100 is notorious for sheer volume of work."
UCSC,fnje8hy,t3_g23tgu,1586997194.0,"Unfortunately not - individual major programs exist, but you can't do an individual minor. See Academic Senate policy 10.4.4"

UCSC,fmrfk76,t1_fmrdddw,1586321737.0,"Not necessarily - at least the upper division classes I've taken have been comprehensive and rigorous where deserved. UCSC's community in general has a healthier, friendlier, more collaborative, and less competitive academic culture compared to some of the ""flagship"" UCs, at least at the undergraduate level. (Anecdotally, from my coworker.)

Workload is pretty major dependent. I don't have a lot of experience with the education department"
UCSC,fmrb6ls,t3_fww6o1,1586318339.0,"Animals, location, scenery.

Campus culture. Anecdotally - speaking to people who have transferred here from UCB, UCLA, etc. - UCSC academic culture is a large progression for mental health.

Some particularly strong academic programs. Physics, computer engineering, and I think psychology."
