""Currently parking restrictions are lifted and you may park in any non-reserved space on campus without a parking permit. These restrictions will most likely be extended to coincide with the extension of the Shelter in Place order from the County of Santa Cruz.

If there is a need for a permit after the restrictions are reinstated, you can come apply for a permit at the TAPS sales office"""
