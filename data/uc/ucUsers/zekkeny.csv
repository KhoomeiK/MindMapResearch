UCSD,fplemtb,t1_fplcpzr,1588711341.0,luckily one of my classes drops the lowest quiz. Just kind of bummed that I had to use my freebee because I was irresponsible forgot to do it :/
UCSD,fplcmhr,t1_fpkm2qw,1588710322.0,Thanks for all the suggestions. I've downloaded some apps like Forest and ticktick to help me take inventory and help me stay focused. I've been doing task-oriented study and like you said my brain just gets overwhelmed. I'll be trying time-oriented study. Thanks again!
UCSD,fplc1x4,t1_fpkj4tt,1588710036.0,a checklist definitely would help. thanks so much for the recommendation!
UCSD,fplajs3,t1_fpkw0vo,1588709265.0,what's strange is that my grades on exams were all pretty decent so I thought I was handling it well. But suddenly I missed 3-4 hw/quizzes throughout my classes this past 2 weeks. Maybe post exam got me extra lazy and irresponsible.
UCSD,fplaat1,t1_fpk18h9,1588709140.0,Thanks for the suggestion. I don't think I have a whiteboard but I'll definitely make a list and cross off as I go!
UCSD,fpla6q0,t1_fpl0y11,1588709083.0,No I guess I just genuinely forgot. For one class the professor sent a week summary at the beginning of the week and somewhere in the email it mentioned the quiz due on Friday. I guess I just scanned the email and totally forgot that part. For other classes there were weekly quizzes on Friday and I forgot to do them because I was working on other assignments. Also thanks for the other suggestions. I'll try my best.
UCSD,fp8x2kd,t1_fp805gb,1588406022.0,"yep he's already listened to concerns and will be reducing workload and doing more practice problems. I can see he's a caring prof., it's just remote learning making the situation the way it is :^("

UCSD,fp7m4j1,t1_fp68knf,1588373232.0,"Mostly the format of the class due to remote learning and his teaching. At the beginning it was weekly exams, 3 quizzes weekly, 1 writing assignment, 1 (pretty difficult) homework assignment, group projects, textbook reading, and at least 5-10 pre-recorded (not that helpful) videos in addition to zoom live-lectures. Luckily exams are now bi-weekly and group projects have been dropped. Also, he has listened to student concerns and changed some things + in today's lecture he mentioned he will be doing more examples & reducing the workload a little (yay). He seems like a really nice prof., the circumstances just suck."
UCSD,fp5u1ix,t1_fp1ler4,1588339900.0,pretty sure op meant using chegg for hw. doubt anyone thinks using chegg for the exam is right.
UCSD,fp5s6sh,t3_gb8ztc,1588338673.0,the song at the start and end of the videos will haunt me for the rest of my time here
UCSD,fos5k3a,t1_fos4j6c,1588024368.0,oh that sounds rly good. I actually haven't checked the new format. I just think him prioritizing changing hw rather than test format kinda sucks especially now that hw is worth 20% less and exams 20% more..
UCSD,fos19pb,t3_g8q16g,1588022149.0,"honestly, the problem is in his test format, idk why he's choosing to change hw format. the written part for partial credit being an optional extra part that doesn't even get looked at when the answer is already correct makes no sense bc 1) if students got it right already then they wasted time explaining their work they had just done on paper and 2) it encourages cheating bc usually no work=no credit but he decided if you just have the answer correct you get all the pts.. Him reducing test time back to 50min with this partial thing actually sucks bc i know a lot of ppl didn't even get through all the questions on the last exam. He should make explanation mandatory + keep it at 60mins or just revert to gradescope imo."
UCSD,fnklj7k,t1_fnkjdrt,1587031671.0,mine added more..
UCSD,fnkajxq,t1_fnka6fh,1587020129.0,yeah.. just feels like watching lectures online takes so much more time vs in person classes? it's hard for me to sit through videos without taking breaks :/
UCSD,fnka00z,t3_g28zyj,1587019614.0,midterm next week and I havent watched a single lecture for one of my classes yet. hahaha... I'm in danger.
UCSD,fngv6r1,t1_fn4otmx,1586946176.0,how'd it turn out?
UCSD,fn44cgk,t1_fn3fcz4,1586633797.0,God's work. tysm!
UCSD,flzazid,t3_frxzdm,1585619467.0,honestly cant focus when I just see the ppt
