ucla,fp15j7j,t3_gam3d0,1588224995.0,I refuse to believe that Respondus is not malware. It modifies system files. It surveils you in your home. The program *acts* like malware. I've heard too many horror stories to even *partially* consider it an acceptable solution. They shouldn't be allowed to make anyone install that on their computer. There has to be a better way to evaluate students than putting their computer in a virtual chokehold. The usage of Respondus reflects a complete unwillingness to adapt. I'm extremely grateful to any professor who recognizes this and doesn't use Respondus.
