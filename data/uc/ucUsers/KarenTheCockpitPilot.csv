niceguys,fomldsr,t1_fomiiql,1587894415.0,"I think it's 100% okay enjoy movies like that, because movies are kinda like a riskless safe predetermined bubble of fantasy, but only as long as that viewer can make that hard distinction of real life. Otherwise yes, when the fantasy seeps in to cause harmful expectations and behavior then that's when it becomes a problem."
popheads,fomiir3,t3_g892rp,1587891296.0,"Many women artists (most of pop.) I used to be micro critical ie how Ariana has kinda put on mannerisms and aesthetic, how Taylor has a lot of unlikeable defensive tendencies but I've realized that I've been putting women on more of a microscope and just be more forgiving. So now I love Ariana, and greatly respect Taylor, and now have lots of love and acceptance to most artists. Pop and its adjacent conversations has opened my heart a lot <3"

PopHeadsGossip,foice7a,t3_g7m1pf,1587783415.0,"it feels like shit to armchair diagnose someone but i really believe Halsey has some serious issues with NPD. She reminds me exactly of my old friend, where out of extreme insecurity she'd twist even the littlest stupidest thing into something that boosts her ego, and it completely stunts any real growth. I mean everyone does this in small doses i guess we're human, but i've never seen it on such an obvious scale as Halsey where every single micro-movement or thing she says or supports just screams NPD. It's a sad circular problem to have so i feel for her."
