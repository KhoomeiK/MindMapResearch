NASCAR,fp2v588,t1_fp2ok9i,1588268406.0,"The only eye injury I remember is Denny Hamlin's. Is that who you're referring to? Is there some evidence he was ""coked out""?"
NASCAR,fp2bm49,t1_fp2armo,1588258888.0,"Nah. But I didn't say the n word. And I'm not injured. This really seems to boil down to PR, doesn't it?"
NASCAR,fp2ao92,t1_fp2almi,1588258399.0,Neither did I. Can I start the season right now and be eligible?
NASCAR,fp2agos,t1_fp29c89,1588258291.0,"If it's a matter of injury, then revert back to OP. Why Kenseth?"
NASCAR,fo56sbt,t1_fo56oxd,1587518743.0,I'm beyond jealous. Great show and tell
NASCAR,fo51vky,t3_g5ql0l,1587515728.0,Wow! When did Pearson sign that?
NASCAR,fo3undc,t3_g5k0nq,1587493233.0,Where is the dragon?
bayarea,fo30cyf,t3_g52nzy,1587478089.0,Fantastic photo!
UCDavis,fnzedd6,t1_fnzdzcl,1587392400.0,I re-read my comment to see where I said that someone wants Fall online. Can't find it. Where did you come up with that?
UCDavis,fnzblyn,t3_g4mslo,1587390745.0,"For what it's worth, I heard from one prof that they were told by their Chair ""unofficially"" that the intention is to have everything done online in the fall. That's hearsay of hearsay, but it seems likely that we'll be back to SIP in the fall."
history,fnvyra4,t3_g420ab,1587307842.0,"Check out the That Was Genius podcast. They make light of a lot of topics, but they're very funny (and a bit crass), but do make history fun."
NASCAR,fnvxrff,t3_g3zboc,1587307224.0,"You'll should watch that all the way through. Great history. Makes you wonder how in the hell ANY scoring was done - let alone done accurately. Nasty crash at the end too. 
Thanks a lot to OP. This made my morning."
UCDavis,fnoriup,t3_g2sju1,1587132156.0,"Try to remember how difficult it is to completely change to online study. These profs got handed a shit deal just like the rest of us. They're doing their best to accommodate us, whether you can see it or not. I know one of my profs was asked to reduce their content by up to 80% AND change to P/N for a required course. Profs are disgusted with how things have been handed down to them and have told me repeatedly that they think the students are being disserviced by the new university mandates. It's not the profs fault that we're all stuck in this. Try to be more compassionate."
NASCAR,fnl08rr,t3_g2ez8s,1587044275.0,"For me it was when Earnhardt moved Bobby Hamilton at Rockingham in 1996. Love Dale, but had never up to that point seen the 43 win a race."
NASCAR,fnixjdl,t1_fnhd890,1586988134.0,Don't go near that car again without a gallon of RoundUp! Poison ivy galore!
history,fn4nvd2,t3_fz5tb9,1586645224.0,"I definitely remember seeing somewhere a troop in the American Civil War on film talking about his experiences in the war. He was over 100 years old at the time, I'm pretty sure, when he was filmed."
NASCAR,fn4nlc1,t1_fn4mgcg,1586645055.0,Came here to say THIS. That dude was an abomination to the sport.
history,fmw1dt6,t3_fxpo0r,1586437211.0,"I recommend a podcast called ""That Was Genius."" The 2 guys on there tell classical histories in a very unique and funny way."
NASCAR,fmsbehh,t3_fx0m01,1586351742.0,Check out the Dinner With Racers podcast 2-part series on Smokey. You should find what you're looking for.
NASCAR,fml4kbl,t3_fvx4d6,1586178433.0,Hard Charger by Dale Earnhardt
NASCAR,fmhx3wt,t1_fmh3ki5,1586096484.0,Yeah that seems reasonable. But I would normalize these data by dividing the numbers by how many Cup starts they each had. Doing that would move Richmond and Davey way up the list.
