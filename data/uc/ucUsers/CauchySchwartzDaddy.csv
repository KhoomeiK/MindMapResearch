Also taking all next year off would mean you would have to reapply to ucla and there’s no guarantee you would be allowed back. My current understanding is that you can take a max of two consecutive quarters off without reapplying.  

Sure it sucks no one is having the experience but there’s no guarantee that you would get the spicy internship back home considering companies are still going to probably take it slow for a bit, and usually internships aren’t just things you show up for unless you know someone important in the company. Otherwise you would have to apply which they might not even be letting people do right now. Definitely look hard into this and make sure you just won’t be at home being a couch potato if things don’t go your way."
math,fpj0s0g,t3_gdoyq0,1588653477.0,"You can still continue to take a few courses from the major you don’t choose to carry on with. There’s also a chance you could do one of those “design your own major” things if your school allows it. 

I would recommend doing what you enjoy but also take a strong look about what your goals are for the future.  Jobs in academia are rough to come across in both fields and you’ll want to make sure that you have enough transferrable skills to do something in industry if your goals change down the line. 
Personally if your goals are an abstract background that will give you opportunities to work in industry then I think math is the better choice because you’ll get chances to take computing, numerical methods, mathematical finance, ect.  All of these give you enough background to at least get your foot in the door at a workforce job. 

I’m also in a very similar position. I went into college as a pure math major, and I’m also a second year at a large research university. Even though I’m sticking with the major for the flexibility in courses I feel that being boxed into academia wasn’t going to provide the experiences I wanted in life.  I still will have the opportunity to take a whole ton of advanced math courses, but still with the eye towards ways to use it in a novel way.

Whatever you choose keep your options open about your future and don’t have second thoughts, talk to people and make an informed decision that can only be you."
ucla,fpejwtj,t3_gcxl9o,1588548979.0,"Not econ and not wanting to go into consulting but keep your options open.  Explore many different career paths and take as many courses in as many different areas as possible.  You'll just box yourself in if you are average at something in a huge applicant pool.  

I would recommend taking a lot of the more mathematical courses in econ and econometrics and stuff.  This is kind of hard for a lot of people but math and CS are probably the most important thing for a econ person to have in their tool belt."
ucla,fp9kvjh,t1_fp96sd5,1588428745.0,Definitely interesting.  Everybody raves of Elman and it seems like Gieseker is teaching 110 honors series next year so that’ll be interesting even though I find he’s a fine teacher.  I’ll keep an eye out for him on courses then.
ucla,fp8ekzy,t3_gbyy6i,1588390339.0,"Well CARES I think is different from the initial coronavirus relief bill, which was aimed at small businesses and what Harvard and USC took flak for, but I dont know where we got our money."
ucla,fp89x0j,t1_fp7nmt2,1588387139.0,I have to take 120 as a pure math major but I think I want to just take three courses with 131 and 110 honors in the fall.  Given my pace I’m probably better just waiting until fall 3rd year to take 245 just so I can get 131C and hopefully 121 done also.
ucla,fp89mdk,t1_fp89bcs,1588386942.0,Cool I think I’ll just pass 115B by then. I’ve thought about whether or not to go the Basic route but I think I’m better exploring my interests in the upper divs and taking a few grad courses rather than going crazy and sacrificing my other mathematical interests.
math,fp11i02,t3_gamlyh,1588221912.0,"I really likes Shurman’s Calculus and Analysis in Euclidean Space. It is a bit less crazy than Spivak but it does all the necessary stuff and even goes pretty advanced into differential forms and stuff. Covers all the basics of multivariable analysis while still allowing you to know how to calculate multiple integrals, though our instructor supplemented actual integration with a chunk of the course between Riemann integration and traditional analysis and differential forms and generalized Stokes’s Theorem.
Also to note that this covers both differentiation and integration, so depending on whether this course is a two semester or two quarter long course that might be to note.
If anything I think this book is exactly the type of book you want, it wad designed as if not everyone had seen proofs before, it’s incredibly readable and has a ton of good problems."
me_irl,fp0yuoq,t3_gajix4,1588220075.0,"But that’s not really true.  He just wasn’t recognized until after his death, nothing about being less than other artists.  Basically he willed all his paintings to his brother’s wife who used the extensive letters and correspondences between the two to build up his legacy because kind of tragically they both died within a year of each other."
ucla,foyh6tg,t3_ga4oia,1588172457.0,Math department honors is just a paper that you have to complete. You could probably finesse your way into being allowed to do math department honors. I don’t know anything about stats but the depts are kind of similar and any courses in stats you took would be good background for a thesis.
ucla,foygs0s,t3_ga4wnh,1588172244.0,"Go to the math department website, go to undergraduate, select majors. They have all the info you could want.  Required courses should help you get an understanding of what your in for."
learnmath,foszcqg,t1_fosz9i9,1588041247.0,Yeah it’s “show T is injective”
learnmath,foszb7e,t1_fosz5r1,1588041220.0,The way Hoffman-Kunze defines linear operators is T:V->V so that makes more sense.
learnmath,fosyml0,t1_fosyi4p,1588040798.0,"The problem asks for linear operators, so domain and codomain are equal."
learnmath,fosyigl,t1_fosy7xm,1588040728.0,I’m working on a past exam that our instructor gave out so I assume it’s correct but this just seems out of the ordinary a little.
ucla,fora1ia,t3_g94p9l,1588008716.0,"From what I’ve heard music department has a whole ton of classes and also a whole ton of people who are amazing at their instruments. You might want to go for one of the bands on campus that doesn’t have so much stuff to do because physics also has a lot of classes.  You’re going to be competing with people who want to go into orchestras but I’m sure a minor could be doable. Usually double major works best when there is a lot of overlap in classes, ie math and stats, and in this case there are none."

ucla,fo1yaq6,t3_g54peu,1587444455.0,That’s probably an engineering question rather than a math department question. I don’t think they’ve sent anything or either I don’t remember. Depending on the course it probably won’t be too difficult just stick through it.
sailing,fo0nixo,t1_fo0lr86,1587416321.0,"People think that when they're going sailing it will be relaxing, but on a race yacht they'll just be doing hard work.  Joke sounded better in my head, oh well."

ucla,fnyd8s1,t3_g4m6em,1587359719.0,"Usually you have to do all the prerequisite classes for both majors until you can declare double major.  It doesn’t really matter until you get all those classes done. Then you go to the department office and get a major petition form and give it to them so they can approve you.  Take things slow, there’s plenty of time, explore other areas, don’t rush."
sailing,fnxp9mu,t3_g3p1lr,1587343446.0,Nothing would bring me more joy in life than to own and race a 8 or 12 metre.  I'm not too much into all the crossing ocean cruising stuff but racing is just so fun and you still get to stay relatively near land.

ucla,fng86l8,t3_g1f2jx,1586924724.0,"It’s not being a college student, but being a dependent. At our age our parents pay for the majority of the stuff we need, and as such we are not the ones who need the money. Perhaps unpopular opinion but your job working a few hours a week at some boba place doesn’t make you financially independent.  

Our parents, by claiming us as dependents have a roughly $4,000 tax break per child, which greatly exceeds a $1,200 check to us when they are the ones who front most of the bill and have for all of our lives.  

Sure this doesn’t cover all situations that people could be in, and perhaps someone feels like they’re getting the short end of the stick, but sadly that’s life. 

I feel like a lot of people just think they deserve to be handed out free money when that’s not the way the world works.  This money goes to people who really need it in this time of crisis, just because you want what is in all reality more money than you would make in a quarter as a government blank check doesn’t mean you really need it."

math,fn8g68m,t1_fn8frll,1586740909.0,"I'm far too early to say what I would want to study, but I've enjoyed analysis and algebra.  Next year I might take PDEs to see if I would want to take further grad courses in that area even though I worry that taking anything other than the first year sequences in analysis and algebra will get me obliterated."
math,fn89stn,t3_g03p3w,1586736941.0,"Current undergrad UCLA math student here.  It's a great program but you'll also be competing with a lot of other top rank students.  Take that as you will, but the professors are great and we have a ton of interesting classes in every area of math you could think of.  

Never close doors this early on, so really look into everything: take a few courses in areas of math you don't have exposure to yet.  College is too short to just only take abstract nonsense classes without ever seeing how these ideas could be applied if your career route ever changes."
