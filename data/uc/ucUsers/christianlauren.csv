puppy101,fnzmnp2,t3_g4skjr,1587396961.0,"I actually had a breakdown at my parent’s house cause I thought my puppy didn’t like me because she LOVES hanging out with my mom and especially my dad whenever I was over. At my apartment though, it’s a very different story. She gets so excited to see me after if I go outside to get the mail or throw the trash. It’s just a puppy thing really but dont feel like yours doesn’t love you because they really do!"
