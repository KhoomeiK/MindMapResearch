This is incredibly naive. You think MSM is gonna give a shit if a progressive plays nice with other Democrats? Seriously? Wake up, dude.

The media absolutely ***hounded*** Warren once she became a threat at the beginning of the primary, EVEN THOUGH she was a perfect example of your ""work with other Democrats, play nice, and hope for the best"" takeaway. So much for that.

Bernie didn't lose because people thought he couldn't get things done. **He lost because MSM painted him as unelectable.** Literally 70-80% of voters in every primary that vote agreed with his ideas / goals, but overwhelmingly agreed that Biden was the more electable candidate. Why? Because MSM forced that down their throats by painting a boogeyman out of Benrie w/ the Castro comments, being a spendthrift, the list goes on.

Honestly, the only way we do better next time is by outperforming the media's bias, which means choosing a candidate who can excite both younger and older voters. It's an enormous task, but that's our biggest barrier; not some fake ass explanation that Bernie is less likeable by the establishment."
