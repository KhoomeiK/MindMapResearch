It's obscene that they continue to charge us when, like you said, they can't even provide BASIC necessities like toilet paper. I've been upset about the rec/activities fee but that's truly small pebbles in comparison to not even having toilet paper, jeez.

I've heard bits of news here and there about the lawsuit against the UCs but does anyone think it will truly pan out? I can't believe in such a time of uncertainty when students, as well as their parents, have even lost jobs, they refuse to budge even an inch on this."
UCSD,fovvsxg,t3_g9uxgc,1588108394.0,"How are we not allowed to challenge this? I understand that it's still our campus and we're ""keeping it functional"" by paying fees, but I don't see how it's fair to charge us when we're not using these resources/facilities AND this was not the type of education or college lifestyle (for lack of a better term) we signed up for. I know no one could've forseen this but I just don't see why they act like it's out of their hands to refund some of these fees."
UCSD,fovt1t2,t3_g9kt8a,1588107027.0,"Tbh, you're not alone at all. It seems from most of the people I've talked to and the posts I've seen, everyone is in the same boat. You have every right to feel overwhelmed. We were put into a very odd situation in a short amount of time, and I think we're still trying to navigate all the new challenges we face. Try not to be too hard on yourself. I can definitely relate to feeling like I'm in school 24/7 these days, so I try to ask myself each morning if there is one thing I can do that day that will make me happy or make my day better. Tl;dr: you aren't alone, please try to take some time for yourself and don't be so hard on yourself, and I wish you the very best."
UCSD,fovj72w,t1_fov9nyw,1588102223.0,I'm also in this class and interested!!
UCSD,fkpi7ft,t3_fjtjzc,1584410751.0,"this is my prof, many of the people in our class have absolutely no idea what or how to study for this exam. she also gave us the option to take an ""incomplete"" grade and complete the final next quarter which is the most bizarre thing i've ever heard, even without the current situation. i pray that someone will come to their senses and stop her."
