science,fply5so,t3_gdxkxr,1588721747.0,Sounds like a great case where correlation doesn't not necessarily imply causation. Is it the diet? Is it the personality behind the diet? Is it the trend of living in more urban environments? A lot of compounding factors here that are certainly not studied.

dataisbeautiful,fpd8s9x,t1_fpc7xzg,1588522171.0,"I suppose I'd rather have a society that guarantees you a certain minimum quality or life in exchange for not being able to hit a certain max. Is rather everyone have somewhere to live and food on the table in exchange for there being less multi-billionaires. 

I don't think you fully lose out on motivation, you can still become very rich, but you don't have to stress as much that debt and medical bills can/will ruin you for the rest of your life."

dataisbeautiful,fpc7dvd,t1_fpc6zu3,1588490115.0,"I'm not trying to argue that going into this amount of debt should happen or is okay, I'm just saying to those who already have it and were trying to discredit OP, they should focus on some frugality.

I don't think college should put people into debt but I do think most Americans spend much more extravagantly and wastefully than necessary."
dataisbeautiful,fpc4bvz,t3_gcjqcm,1588487167.0,"All these people trying to say this guy makes a ton of money it must be easy.

He said he averaged $720/month in payments. I currently make $65k in a medium to high cost of living area, have my own apartment, and have been putting $1000-1500 into savings (not including 401k here) each month since I started working a few months ago.

I don't think it's unreasonable with some frugality to pay these loans off without making $100k a year.

Edit: OP corrected themselves that they averaged $1000 per month more like. My point still stands."

I think it's pretty short sighted for places like Newport Beach to try and keep beaches open since those people will probably come from out of town, go to the grocery store, interact with locals, etc. You're asking for higher infection rates across the board."
financialindependence,fp6mxkw,t1_fp6hh0x,1588355093.0,"Yeah. I wouldn't really call it a postponement either because we're not going to get two raises in 2021, just one in April and then every April after that. Either way, it's easier to continue having my normal pay than to get laid off and have to deal with that uncertainty."
financialindependence,fp6gblj,t3_gbe5t7,1588351853.0,"My work just said we won't be getting our raises this July (pushed to next April) and they will be suspending 401k matching till the end of the year.

I'm okay with these cutbacks and they are totally understandable and warranted. Gonna have to make some adjustments to my predictions but assuming everything goes well I'm sure I'll get a nice bonus and raise next April."

I love every other Bong Joon-ho film but Snowpiercer just felt too into itself and overdramatic, and the response of people reading into it just felt so over the top. I'll take The Host, Parasite, even Okja, before Snowpiercer."

I am enjoying it so far. Although I don't feel like I am being fully utilized currently, it is understandable with just an undergrad and I am slowly taking on more advanced projects. So far it has been almost all data analysis for PPts to show to clients. I just got assigned my first assignment to work on a model for a client. I was getting tired of the pure DA so I am excited to have to play around with the model and data. Overall, enjoying myself, excited to see where I can move up from here and make a little more money!"
datascience,fog7rao,t3_g766dj,1587749018.0,"I think it's the nature of a ""data science"" sub. As a field, data science is just too broad and has too much hype. I think people are better off going to other subs like statistics, machinelearning, learnmachinelearning, learnprogramming, etc.

There is certainly a level of data exploration and stuff that ""data science"" kinda revolves around but it's best to learn that elsewhere.

This whole sub is people who are attracted to the idea of data science but don't really know what it is or what they're doing. If they did, they wouldn't be here, they'd be in one of the other subs I mentioned."

CasualConversation,fodbse4,t1_fobxanm,1587682700.0,"This is how I felt about LoL. To make it worse, I never got above Gold in Ranked. All that time and energy, dreaming of playing, and I still kinda sucked and just got mad. 

Looking back I had fun and not much else to do but still feels like wasted time."
CasualConversation,fobnd1j,t1_foajlc9,1587661600.0,"I've been there with LoL in high school. I had nothing better to do at the time over the summer but once I was in school and still playing when I should have been doing homework, it got in the way. After over a year I eventually stopped playing but it is so hard when you get into a game like that. You can keep playing and even if you hate your teammates you still want to play. You start dreaming about it, craving playing after you haven't for a while.

Eventually I just stopped playing as often and then stopped playing altogether. Haven't played it in years now. But I understand how hard it can be to stop."

statistics,fnbe5to,t1_fnb6orc,1586813933.0,MS are never guaranteed funding or housing. There is certainly positions open to be a TA but if they accept more PhDs in year two then you can be kicked out of the position. There is a chance to get funding through this or a fellowship but no guarantees and they never do.
SandersForPresident,fnatj7t,t1_fnaslsr,1586803566.0,I think it's pretty easy to argue this was because of shitty government policies in response and not NHS. When you're overrun because the government did nothing to curtail infection then it's less your fault people are dying.
statistics,fn8ltwg,t1_fn8l3nv,1586744602.0,"Again, this is assuming it is funded, something almost all MS do not guarantee. Cut out the 50k stipend and you have X>72k and that is pretty feasible.

I appreciate the back and forth, I agree the Berkeley program is just there to fund PhDs. At the end of the day it's a risk/reward analysis.

Just for some insight I was also accepted to UCI Stats MS and went there for my undergrad. There is potential for a TA position and grad housing and stipend but they only guarantee PhD students and not MS so I could also have to be looking for housing in an awful housing market and not have any stipend income and find a way to make money and pay tuition some other way. This is why that isn't the obvious choice."
statistics,fn8g7i6,t1_fn8fb6j,1586740931.0,Yes because that year can be spent making at least $40k+ in after tax earning compared to even a funded Masters which I'm not guaranteed.

Now I'm building my emergency fund to about 6 months while keeping my 401k contributions to get the max match. Might put a little bit into my Roth while I build my emergency fund while the market is down but only after I pass 3 months (currently at around 1.5?)

I'm a little sad that I don't get a stimulus check since I was a dependent on my parents taxes last year since I was a student. I am no longer a dependent but it doesn't matter. It would be pretty handy right now to kick-start my emergency fund but I'm not complaining too much as long as I have my job."

I have Ally and they have ""buckets"" so you can just have a bucket for student loans. Keep making ""payments"" to the bucket, throw some extra money if there if you can, and consider it already gone. Then when the time comes you dump that whole bucket on your student loans. Mentally might feel better to separate it from the rest of your savings."
