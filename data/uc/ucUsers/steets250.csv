There are other comments mentioning how these other countries tend to focus on more rehabilitation and less just punishment, so hopefully the people can be helped and reintroduced into society in a safe way."

Americans are used to larger prison sentences for smaller crimes, so we tend to view other countries as having shorter prison sentences even though it's us who is the outlier. While not directly, it kinda does answer the question."
