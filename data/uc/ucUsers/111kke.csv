UCSantaBarbara,fp8wcrk,t1_fp8mgxa,1588405285.0,Iâ€™m looking forward to it! Thanks.
UCSantaBarbara,fp8wbtr,t1_fp8sk79,1588405259.0,thank you so much and great advice!
UCSantaBarbara,fooduxe,t3_g8msw4,1587937214.0,Yeah... I thought the whole point of her emphasizing the folded outer membrane of the gram-negative bacteria was to drive home the point that it gave it more surface area... make it make sense
UCSantaBarbara,fomc2xi,t3_g7zc51,1587884739.0,I feel where youâ€™re coming from. Today I realized I have developed burnout. I have been under stress for so long I just feel detached and desensitized about everything. Being at home really sucks because I have no one around that is also dealing with hard schoolwork. The work just seems endless and I just feel kind of helpless. I keep grinding and pushing but like... at what cost.  I know I shouldnâ€™t take school this seriously but I do.
UCSantaBarbara,foehuza,t3_g71g8c,1587704172.0,Iâ€™m thankful that I donâ€™t have to worry about biking frantically through dangerous bike traffic when I leave my apartment late for lecture ðŸ˜Œ
UCSantaBarbara,fo9khe3,t3_g6drzj,1587622164.0,"Lol might send a passive aggressive email that says: Gauchospace isnâ€™t allowing me to see my score, even though I know Gauchospace multiple choice tests are graded automatically. Is this a glitch with my account? Should I contact technical support?"
UCSantaBarbara,fo9kcpc,t3_g6drzj,1587622053.0,"I was thinking that too. I understand withholding scores until after the testing window has passed so that no one can share correct answers, but why not show scores after the testing windowâ€™s done? Itâ€™s ridiculous."
UCSantaBarbara,fn8dfq6,t3_g06ice,1586739178.0,Donâ€™t bother trying to find it everyone left because there were cheaters and snitches lol
UCSantaBarbara,fmvdwf6,t3_fxhz2l,1586413650.0,"Somehow I feel like I am a lot less stressed this quarter. I think not having to bike to and from class/work/other obligations has just opened some time up for me, and my teachers have been pretty reasonable about not overloading us with extra work. My physics and ochem classes arenâ€™t gonna have any midterms and I guess midterms are the major source of my school stress. However itâ€™s only week 2 and I admittedly havenâ€™t been as disciplined/productive as I am during a normal quarter, so hopefully I donâ€™t find myself really struggling in a few weeks. Best of luck to you and Iâ€™m sorry you are getting hit with so much work."
UCSantaBarbara,fmthrcv,t3_fxc11z,1586372938.0,Is it peanut
UCSantaBarbara,fmrmitz,t3_fx11q0,1586327881.0,Definitely donâ€™t add OChem lab to this. Maybe a bio lab but not OChem.
UCSantaBarbara,fmn2kx9,t3_fw6lmx,1586216877.0,In Lewis he gave us 90 minutes
UCSantaBarbara,fm66al4,t3_ftbu73,1585787199.0,"Give yourself some time to adjust; I know the quarter system is super fast, but still, itâ€™s only week one :). Trust that youâ€™ll get the hang of things in the coming weeks. Your motivation will probably return once exams/assignments start being due."
