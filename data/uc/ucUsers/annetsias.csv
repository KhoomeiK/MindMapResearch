I'd probably recommend 120 cause it's cheaper and you're more likely to use them all"

Cause you can depend on things like rpantry, food boxes distributed by local churches and apply to calfresh for food and household items. I'm not too sure what you can do to pay rent other than contact financial aid and take out any loans you may have been offered. 

Alternatively do you have a friend who left their apartment empty to go back home ( many people cant leave their lease so their apartments are vacant and paid) maybe you can ask to stay there while there gone in the meantime?"
