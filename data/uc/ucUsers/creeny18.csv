TeachforAmerica,fpdyxor,t3_gcuuf2,1588537027.0,"I actually think if you want to be a career teacher, I would recommend doing a traditional certification. You technically have a coach while in TFA, but the level of support you actually get totally depends on your region/school/coach. I think I met with my coach three times my first year, and it was not helpful. BUT, if you are interested in education as a field (beyond classroom teaching), then TFA does have a great network and a ton of opportunities and fellowships for alum to get you into more policy and advocacy roles"
berkeley,foi0es3,t3_g7ghw3,1587776181.0,Don‚Äôt ever give up! Cal was also my dream when I was in high school but I didn‚Äôt get in. I ended up having an amazing experience at another school that transformed me into who I am today (and saved me hella money) and now I‚Äôm going to Cal for grad school! Best of luck and always remember things happen for a reason and you will end up where you need to be üôåüèæ
