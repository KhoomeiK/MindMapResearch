But I‚Äôm keeping my iPhone 8 Plus for three years, since I want to get the iPhone 12 in the fall and my iPhone 8 Plus is still somewhat manageable for the next few months, despite me getting it back in 2017."

UCSantaBarbara,fnboajd,t1_fnbo0xr,1586819124.0,"hopefully! yeah i agree. but it‚Äôs most likely going to reopen during Fall Quarter, since he said B is most likely gonna be remote too. Also, it‚Äôs not until October which gives them more time and it probably makes more sense for them to fully reopen when a new school year starts rather than in the middle of summer."
