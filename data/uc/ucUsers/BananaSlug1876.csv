UCSC,fpmaehn,t1_fpm9uug,1588728848.0,That sounds like exactly what I need! Thank you!
UCSC,fplkw24,t1_fplkbbj,1588714549.0,"There’s a thing where you can request to have your grade immediately given as a NP. For example I was worried about failing math, but since I hadn’t failed it yet I couldn’t re-enroll in it for the next quarter until I received the NP. So in that case I could’ve chosen to just receive the NP immediately without taking the final so I could enroll in the class again. (I didn’t but it was an option for people who know they’re going to fail even if they take the final.)"
UCSC,fphpmc1,t3_gdjqno,1588625484.0,When you get an email saying your order was “closed” or “complete” this usually means it’s available to pick up. They have a pick up window open at the bookstore. I used this option a couple weeks ago when they first started doing this and it went smoothly. Just go to the window and give them your name and they should have your order!
UCSC,fpal107,t1_fpakvyf,1588450352.0,So I got the COVID pay from the school like everyone else but I already used all of it up. I applied for unemployment through the state website after I used all of my COVID pay up.
UCSC,fpabtjv,t3_gc94y9,1588444906.0,"I applied for unemployment and I’m not on work study and I got it. But I’ve heard of other people having issues.

Edit: Also forgot to mention that I work at 9/10 Dining Hall"
UCSC,fp3atc0,t1_fp3abap,1588276085.0,Hm. Maybe call them and ask?
UCSC,fp36d8w,t3_gb1rpd,1588273870.0,"If they sell batteries the express store is open, and the bay tree bookstore is doing online orders with pickup but it might take a day to process your order. 

I’m just 100% sure if they sell batteries."
UCSC,foxjfbj,t3_ga466a,1588145876.0,"Same. I started off really strong, thinking I’d do better since everything is open note. Now it’s hard for me to even sit through a lecture, and even tho it’s open note I can’t even focus on the content or what the quiz questions are asking so I’m actually doing worse. I’m just praying I can get my head out of my ass for midterms. What’s worse is 2/3 are major requirements so I actually need to know the material, and I’m definitely not absorbing it like I would in a physical classroom setting."
UCSC,fovcj8g,t3_g9rf8a,1588099036.0,I would say yes. I just took some pictures at OPERS the other day. Just stay off the closed parts and you’ll be fine.
UCSC,fo91yx0,t1_fo8n1ay,1587608724.0,The Crown/Merrill Dining Hall bathroom is for employees only. I don’t know about 9/10.
UCSC,fo8zcnc,t1_fo8z18i,1587607068.0,Yes because my grants pay for housing anyway so it’s not like I’m losing money and I tried online learning at home the first week and I focus much better here on campus because there’s way too many people in my small house lol.
UCSC,fo8nfyc,t3_g680x9,1587600016.0,"I am still on campus. I just got relocated from RCC to Crown on Monday. The moving process sucked ass, and the dining halls have literally the exact same thing every single day which is awful. But otherwise it’s not that bad. Pretty quiet, lots of animals hanging around. I can have my car to do grocery shopping which is nice. Pretty much chilling."
UCSC,fn9512b,t3_g0dia5,1586759651.0,"I haven’t heard anything at all except that we are moving. No location, no date, nothing. Very frustrating."
UCSC,fn1jpms,t1_fn1iast,1586563458.0,I would say do both because with the amount of shit you guys have been through this year you deserve to be celebrated twice.
UCSC,fmylo3d,t1_fmylk6j,1586489202.0,I noticed that! It says RCC is closed but I’m like ?? I LIVE here!
UCSC,fmvcngd,t3_fxn1fu,1586412497.0,Rachel Carson as well
UCSC,fmn7knh,t3_fw5l5t,1586219886.0,That’s weird! I’m in Rachel Carson and they put signs on our door handles saying if the rooms were still occupied. I thought all the colleges did this.
UCSC,fmdt6zg,t3_fumbnc,1585977169.0,I emailed them about this and someone replied and said that TAPS is discussing it but she said MOST LIKELY yes they will and to look out for emails updating the status.
