berkeley,fnpj9q7,t1_fnpgko3,1587146467.0,Cool. Thanks
berkeley,fnkemf0,t1_fnke8pr,1587024174.0,I ask cuz the academic guide still shows lab classes and I was aware April 15th was the last day to cancel them
berkeley,fnbtx4p,t3_g0ucxt,1586822254.0,Who said it's going online this Fall?
berkeley,fnb7pbm,t1_fnb7jz7,1586810670.0,YES. You take it last semester with Ferme and Yurchak?

berkeley,fmmyr20,t1_fmmt8jv,1586214648.0,"Found the DSL list, I don't even see the Chemistry classes let alone the lab classes. Does that mean classes like 3X are also canceled as well?"
berkeley,fmmsby4,t3_fw8265,1586211131.0,The lab classes are showing up on the Academic Guide though?
