UCSD,fpdcby8,t3_gck7ra,1588524189.0,"Right there with ya, buddy. Day in and out I spend much more time working only to see poor returns when grades come in. Every hit pushes me down that much more and I feel like my final quarter is going to be a complete failure in part because everything has been upended in a way that does not work with me.

Shout out to P. Tsai though as he's been doing a Lot to wrestle these issues. My other profs however are either holding us to standards they don't hold themselves to, or are hyper focused on time restriction and don't understand why 1/3 of their class is failing."
UCSD,fp2scis,t3_garycm,1588267080.0,If I knew what I know now I would have gone to trade school.
UCSD,fobi6vn,t3_g6adeh,1587660059.0,"I'm waiting to see what the averages were but so far its only been  a smackdown kind of quarter. So far its been either pedantic grading on take home quiz style things or time crunched hard af mc style where most questions have (A-E) A, B, or C, A+B, or all of the above. Like holy hell, profbro."
UCSD,fobh9cj,t1_fobdcbp,1587659778.0,Your dad is disappointed because you have a year of Uni left at 23? If that's what you mean I hope you know he's being dumb. My dad does similar where he knocks anything that isn't an A despite himself having dropped out of hs.

AskMen,flludhg,t3_fpeiph,1585267922.0,In the foreseeable future we'll have regularly interspersed designer babies ; ). For now this is why we have things like amniocentesis to get a read on genetic disorders before it's too late to make a more ethical decision.
