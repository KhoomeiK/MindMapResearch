Fauci's face on a stock ""man in suit"" (which is why his head/neck looks off, and stock ""hands with sign"" in front (hence the hands/arms not lining up) with the cardboard texture and text added to that."

And much of that mercury was used in the sierras to process gold during the gold rush, and that is also still coming out the mountains into the Sacramento River."

aww,fp0j1y4,t3_gai8lh,1588210258.0,"Not to be a Debbie downer, but you may want to start trimming Kitty's back paws. I see in the first picture what looks like a scratch/scab on the baldy spot in front of the ear. My cat would do the same to herself after she got arthritis and stopped tending to her back paws, so I had to do it for her, much to her consternation. 

If it's just a freckle or trick of the camera, ignore me. They are very cute, tho."

Regarding the fear of pregnancy. Get on a form of birth control now, so you are used to it and can feel empowered. Obviously talk to your doctor, but consider something long-term like an IUD or implant. Combine those with condoms (because Lord knows where his junk has been, anyway) and you're chances of getting knocked up are pretty low. There are always, of course, further options if it comes to that and you are willing to consider them, but it likely wouldn't come to that if you have safe and reliable practices. 

And have a drink with your parents. One or two drinks isn't the end of the world, and frankly, unless your family has a history of dependence, it's worthwhile to give it a try, see how it feels and how it affects you in a safe and controlled environment (ie: get your first light buzz with your parents)"
AskWomen,fosd0ms,t3_g96gmd,1588028315.0,"The reason for the trope of women being bad drivers has to do with the length of th fucking clutch pedal in manual cars. Older manual cars have much longer pedals, such that when I was driving, I had to scoot my chair all the way up, and point my toes to fully depress the pedal, then raise my leg so my knee about touched the steering wheel to fully let it out. Yes. I stalled out a lot the two times I tried to learn. I'm much better on my motorcycle, where the clutch is a hand leaver."

AmItheAsshole,fobzk1w,t1_foaigs6,1587665438.0,"SAME. swapping to conditioner was life-changing. It works really well to lubricate the skin, then the hair grows back the tips are softer so it feels less stubbly, you don't have to have an extra product in the shower, and I go through shampoo faster than conditioner, so now they go down at more even rates."

UCSD,fnr4h6u,t3_g39jb7,1587179077.0,"Sitting on the roof of the business school, right where it jus out towards the ocean, watching the moon set with friends. It was so peaceful up there. 

I used to go to Porter's pub after my last Friday class (11am, when they opened, also I really Porter's hasn't been there for a while. I'm old) I would get a beer and a burger, and the Friday bartender and I had a running competition for coming up for the worst girl's name, so it would be unusual for me to walk in and shout ""EUNICE"" and be greeted with ""HILDEGARD"" in return, or the like. I would take my bet and my number to the back patio and sit in the shade of the eucalyptus. My policy was to stay until I was alone and and of beer. But between ordering rounds with friends and the number of friends I had who ran through, we'd usually call it at 7 or 8 and a few of us would go have dinner together or get ready to go out. We were young and silly and sometimes studied, sometimes just talked shit. Stephen, the owner would roll in sometime in the afternoon, and bless his alcoholic heart, would usually busy into a case of good beer he got in a room and share it with some regulars. He frequently stopped by or table. It felt so nice out there, like this is how life would always be. 

Now I'm trapped inside, working my ass off more than I did in school, turning 30 next week,  and making my own tiki drinks."
aww,fnfukin,t3_g1ctan,1586915780.0,"We used to call that the ""where ARE you?!"" Meow. Baby girl would do it if she woke up alone, forgot people went upstairs to bed, or if she was looking for someone who wasn't home. I miss that dumbass."
answers,fnfu66f,t1_fnelkpz,1586915536.0,"I've always seen those called volcanos, and no, never mix. That's half the fun. I always mix a mai tai because (a) half the time the float is navy strength and it's more pleasant mixed in, and (b) if it's made with house orgeat, it and any lime pulp tend to settle and the drink will look ok like curdled milk I'd you don't finish quickly or stir. 

Basically do what feels right. If it's blended and has two unmixed blends (like the Miami vice/volcano) I wouldn't. If it's a simple float on top of a mix, admire it, maybe take a sip or two, and go ahead and stir."
AmItheAsshole,fmr5mm5,t1_fmopeiz,1586314435.0,"Piggybacking here, but not only that, but he may have done it not just to have a relationship with you, but you say in your post you had no one in your mother's country, but your father's extended family has welcomed you into the fold. Even when he's gone, you will still have a family and support network you wouldn't have had had he not come into your life. He's acted as a conduit between you and your extended family, so you will have people to support you when both your parents are gone. I don't know what his reasoning is, but he's giving you a bittersweet gift."
oakland,fmnx5lx,t1_fmn41g4,1586237930.0,"Not really. They are very thin, and see how they fit loosely around the chin and cheeks? Also not good. If you mean that they have any masks at all, fair. There are some great patterns out there to sew your own, if you have the time and inclination. Both these patterns could even be hand sewn, if you have the time. Both can also be made with elastic or string ties, thought the Kaiser pattern calls for fixed tapes (quad folded thin strips) you could just make a channel with a fatter tape and feed whatever through it. 

Shaped (n95 shape) mask with picked for additional filter material is [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Cloth-Face-Mask/)
