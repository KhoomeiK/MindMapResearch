UCSC,fphbkm8,t3_gdc8lq,1588618361.0,"I dont think it matters as much wether CA is easing restrictions if we still have outbreaks. We are currently seeing declines then surges, which will implicate further restrictions. 

Lets just hope we can prevent outbreaks and the cases will vastly decline, but if that isn't the case we should hope that the university makes the decision that keeps more students safe."

UCSC,fpapsoc,t1_fpapih5,1588453183.0,"First, when government actions incidentally reduce property values, but no rights are violated because nothing that belongs free and clear to the owner is taken, no compensation is due.

Second, when government acts, under its police power, to secure rights the restricted owner is not entitled to compensation, whatever his financial losses, because the uses prohibited or “taken” were wrong to begin with."
UCSC,fpamvz9,t1_fpakm0b,1588451450.0,"Compensation for closure of publicly owned property is not required because 

A) Property values may be lowered but the value of the property is not owned. The property remains publicly owned. 

B)The government by shutting down businesses/publicly owned property is acting to secure rights."
UCSC,fpajthr,t1_fpaim81,1588449645.0,Please elaborate.

UCSC,fp9sevr,t1_fp8jsdh,1588433579.0,They are posing a risk to themselves and others. In this critical time I'd say let authorities know. They'll thank you when they're not infected.
UCSC,fp7mxg0,t3_gbrqz5,1588373676.0,I emailed mine cause I had same issue and they said generally if not picked up within certain number of days they'll return to sender.
UCSC,fp7lfp7,t3_gbqca8,1588372851.0,I took MA100 with Junecue Suh. The hw was easy but midterms were very very hard. I'd say for these classes tailor your studying to match what may come in exam/ask for sample problems. Really try to study efficiently so you dont end up wasting hours on topics not being tested.
UCSC,fp6xwbu,t3_gbbsd3,1588360511.0,"Computer science. Very few employers care about the school you graduated from, but they do care about courses/knowledge. You'll be much more competitive for more jobs with a CS curricula."

If you are upset about his action, well criticize the action but don't use it as a reason to support your individual wants, especially during this hard time. Thanks"

UCSC,foka18b,t3_g7q174,1587838192.0,I vote online school because I pretty much assume that this will not get much better in the coming months. Please stay safe and help others in ways you can.
