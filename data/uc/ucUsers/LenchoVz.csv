ucla,fpn1qfb,t1_fpmupp1,1588747601.0,"Okay, so a cluster is 6 units + 9 units (2 core classes) which would bump it up to 15 leaving you space for one more class of 4 units. For fall quarter taking 4 classes would put you at the limit of units available, from that point on you would need to keep high academic standing so that your unit cap keeps growing. If you keep good academic standing for fall quarter your unit cap automatically gets bumped up to 21 (I believe) if not then you will need to petition to increase your unit cap. So yeah, for fall quarter you are looking at 4 classes, and afterward if you wish 5 classes per quarter to be able to complete 2 minors and possibly summer sessions."

Grade deflation doesn't really exist for LS majors since professors usually grade on a straight scale, so only you are responsible for your own grade. There usually is a curve for most classes, but they only curve to help students not hurt them. There isn't a ""toxic"" premed environment due to the straight scale grading, students at UCLA typically like studying in groups and helping each other out. It is heavily encouraged by professors, doing it won't hurt you, but help you. We don't really have premed advisors, but we have lots of premed clubs that can help with that. Most don't require applications and they are open to anyone that would like to join. The quarter system, some people hate others like it. I personally like it because you enter quickly and you get out quickly. It is only 10 weeks so you can't really slack off and it keeps you in check. What I remind myself of not doing is playing catch-up with assignments, it can definitely hurt you.  Hope I answered most of your concerns, feel free to ask more questions!"

Some professors give you their past exams, except LS7 series (everyone hates LS7 series) and they are really helpful.

Ultimately major in something that you like, you don’t want to end up with a major that you are not interested in, thus making it much harder to succeed in it. The constant ideology that you HAVE to major in science related subjects doesn’t align with what med schools look for in applicants. The reason Psychobio is popular is simply because it covers all bases of med schools requirements along with some MCAT subjects. But, with all honesty major in something you are passionate about, not because you feel that you HAVE to do it. Med schools will look for people that are passionate in what they did during college and if med school is something you want to pursue, then I recommend you to pursue your interests for the best experience possible."

I did CSI (College Summer Institute) and I like it because you got one of the best dorms at UCLA and you really had that close group experience in classes, something which can be difficult during the regular academic year. I would recommend either of the 2, they are both great programs, but during this time it is difficult if I would take the option to do the program at all. I did it with the idea of getting a physical grasp of campus and I loved it because I had a close experience with my professors and I figured where everything on campus was. I would heavily recommend during normal circumstances, but given the actual circumstances I wouldn’t know for sure what the experience will be online.

In terms of research, it isn’t hard to get research depending on what you plan to research on. Many people graduate every year and spots are open every year. You simply need to look and send a lot of emails. Some labs have GPA cutouts and others don’t. But mostly don’t.

Housing, if you apply for the first year you are guaranteed 4 years of housing. I haven’t had significant issues with housing.

There isn’t real premed advising, as far as I know. But there are programs and clubs that can help with that. Most premed clubs are open to anyone and only some are interview only. 

I will be pretty biased if you ask me if it’s worth it(This is a UCLA sub), but in my fair opinion it’s the best possible experience you could have. However, that’s when finances come in chief. I’m not going to be paying for your school so it’s easy for me to say “come to LA”. Finances is certainly something to weigh in when making a big move like this. Your instate school option sounds pretty good to me, but yeah UCLA is another experience, but is it worth the free debt? Mmm, I don’t know chief.

Online learning sucks, ngl. There are some courses that simply cannot be taught online, yet they are. It sucks cause this whole pandemic isn’t going away soon. We only have to hope that everyone follows the guidelines and makes lockdown shorter, but in a country with 330 million people there are a few that simply aren’t going to adhere to safety guidelines, screwing us all over. I think Fall is possibly going to be online, although not 100% sure on that one. We start next year on Oct 1 and that is a pretty long way from today. So I guess we’ll just have to wait and see what happens.

Hope I helped!"

So for a quarter, you are basically in and out pretty quick. You hate a class, you'll only have it for 10 weeks.

As a result of shorter class terms, it means that you take fewer classes. 3-4 (depending on what your major is).

Some people don't like it because it's really quick and you have midterms really often (most South Campus majors, midterms are around weeks 2-3, for North Campus majors it's usually around weeks 4 and 5).
