UCSantaBarbara,fpkqli5,t3_gdv00r,1588699322.0,feel free to pm me :)
UCSantaBarbara,fpj54aw,t3_gdrnj7,1588656873.0,Yes to both- but with some warnings about taking lower divs P/NP https://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/undergrad/major-requirements (there’s specifics about this quarter on the bottom of the page)
UCSantaBarbara,fp1956z,t3_gaq4y7,1588228014.0,"you can join them on department websites, there’s either a link/form or an email you need to ask about joining the list"
UCSantaBarbara,foz8fk9,t3_gad7tb,1588186414.0,"I don’t think that anyone would ever make rude comments about your weight and you would absolutely have a social life, but it can be very mentally challenging being around a ton of super skinny people all day. My personal confidence around my body has really decreased since I started going here. Also any sorority that would exclude you bc of your weight isn’t worth being in- but “good” (the most popular sororities) does basically directly equate to caucasian beauty standards/skinny"
UCSantaBarbara,folo9hp,t3_g860ey,1587866617.0,"i would guess you still qualify, but the ucsb basic needs website has a chat feature (might be closed til monday) w advocates who can answer questions"
UCSantaBarbara,fogrusz,t3_g6xd0d,1587756265.0,"UCEAP bases program suspensions on the State Department and CDC’s travel advisories. Once a country hits Level 3, they suspend programs and pull the students out. Currently, the whole world it at Level 4 and I would guess that’s unlikely to change before May 1st. I know it’s a huge bummer (my program was suspended) but hopefully you’ll be able to go another time!"
UCSantaBarbara,fo7hi4d,t3_g5trt5,1587578419.0,"Fullerton is also largely a commuter school, so the plan to transition to in class instruction is a lot more feasible for them. They have a lot less money tied up in housing infrastructure (literally a single dining hall) so not filling dorms is probably not as much as a financial hit as it would be for UCSB. Honestly, I’m not sure that UCSB could afford to leave its housing closed in fall"
UCSantaBarbara,fo7gv72,t3_g5wo5i,1587578114.0,"I’m hoping that even if classes are remote, campus resources will be re-opening. Having access to the library, SRB, UCEN and other spaces would make remote learning a trillion times better."
UCSantaBarbara,fnyc8cg,t1_fny8llu,1587358905.0,"The current EVPSA said on a student forum the other day that these funds (~$200,000) are not being used for USSA because it does not exist, and that it’s just in the general EVPSA fund for student activities- although there’s really no accountability on that seeing as the money is already not being used for its intended purpose"
UCSantaBarbara,fnloydf,t1_fnllba5,1587057234.0,the United States Student Association- they did lots of lobbying for federal student aid increases but now appear to be defunct
UCSantaBarbara,fnl7j8q,t1_fnko3rm,1587048496.0,in the AS elections
UCSantaBarbara,fnkauez,t1_fnk1mo9,1587020399.0,Can you provide any further information about USSA? The reaffirmation text really only contains the numbers
