ucla,fo8z4zm,t3_g6d5gh,1587606937.0,"GPA is calculated based only on sophomore and junior year grades.

I'm going to be honest. Because nursing is one of the hardest programs to be admitted to, the criteria for admission are likely higher for its applicants. A weighted GPA of 3.8 is on the lower side of UCLA's application pool (not just admitted students - all applicants). Same with the SAT. High 1400s and 1500s did not cut it for a considerable number of people who applied to even the college of Letters and Science (easier to get into than nursing).

Additionally, if your school offered any sorts of AP math or science classes, the decision not to take them is going to hurt you greatly. If AP Lang is the only AP offered at your school, though, then you don't have to worry about APs.

If you can write some absolutely god-tier essays about your volunteering (you should try and reach ~150 hours if you can) at hospitals and your passion for nursing, then maybe there's a shot.

What kind of background are you coming from? (Low income? First-generation college student? Immigrant?) Playing that up might be your best chance.

I'm really sorry to seem overly pessimistic, but there are going to be *a lot* of applicants with >4.5 weighted GPAs, >1500 SATs, >10 APs, >200 volunteer hours, >5 leadership positions, varsity sports, lower-level college courses taken at CCs, and some pretty impressive essays, and some of them are *still* going to get rejected.
