ucr,fmke98b,t3_fu0igt,1586152060.0,"Sorry if this is late, but I’m in that class this quarter and he seems really chill. A majority of our class grade depends on the essay & weekly discussion posts, but he’s super friendly from what it seems. There’s no real exam, and the only thing you need to get for the class is two books; the standard textbook (which is like 18 bucks) and a supplemental book for the essay. 

Someone asked him about his late policy & he straight up said he just wants good writing; he would accept essays a week after. 

If you end up taking it pm me! Maybe we could learn together lol.

Edit: Forgot to add he also has once a week Zoom meetings! But they’re 20 minutes and mostly comprise of him lecturing."
