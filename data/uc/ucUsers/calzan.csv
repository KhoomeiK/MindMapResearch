Electrical Detailer/Design Engineer

Project Engineer

Project manager

Inspector"

electricians,fok8jl0,t1_fok4qkp,1587837396.0,"I think the best way to get more men to be ‘allies’ on the job is to tell them what they haven’t been seeing.  The first post in this thread is a guy saying how he has to ‘walk on eggshells’ when a woman is on the job. That is bullshit.  We don’t want preferential treatment, we just don’t want to be harassed when we are working.  I didn’t want another electrician to run his hand up my pant let when I was standing on a ladder.  I didn’t want to be followed around by a laborer who kept telling me he ‘had a present for me’ for two weeks.  I didn’t want my foreman to text me to ask what I was wearing.  I didn’t want my apprentice to tell me he didn’t have to listen to me because I was a woman and didn’t know what I was doing because women don’t belong in construction.  I didn’t want a million other things to happen at work but they did.  The few times I’ve told my fellow electricians what I’ve experienced they didn’t believe me. Or didn’t want to.  

I think more men on jobs NEED to know what we go through on a daily basis so they can really understand what we mean when we say we want a non hostile work environment.  It isn’t about the crude jokes (although some of them get old pretty quick). It is about being treated with the basic level or respect that every person deserves.  So speak up.  Tell your coworkers what you have gone through and what to look out for.  That’s the only way to grow our base of allies."
electricians,fok4042,t1_fojzn2n,1587834986.0,"Look. This happens a LOT.  I happens way more than most of them men realize and are willing to admit.  In the past I have had to tell people ‘this kind of treatment/talk/behavior could cost you your job if you did it to the wrong person.  Don’t do it again or I will have to inform our supervisor.’  You can frame it as trying to help them avoid getting in trouble if you are worried about immediate backlash from them.  It sucks but if they are doing it to you they have done it before and will do it again unless they are stopped.  

Additionally, I would go to your supervisor and tell them what is happening.  Tell them who is harassing you and and what they are doing.  Tell your supervisor you are trying to handle it yourself so that it doesn’t turn into an actionable situation but you wanted them to be aware of the situation should it escalate.  This makes you look like you a can handle the normal level of bullshit that goes on on a construction site but have reasonable boundaries.   It’s sucks to say, but save any inappropriate texts they send you incase it becomes a he said she said scenario."
