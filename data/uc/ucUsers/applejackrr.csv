StarWarsBattlefront,fpj8fnn,t1_fpia6d0,1588659748.0,"Yeah I agree they are bad. Would’ve loved something else. My honest opinion would’ve been if they gave us a choice in who we wanted like they do with tanks and vehicles in Battlefield. Like you can choose between all these heroes that can do certain things. Like two force sensitive heroes, two gun slingers, one or two of another. Make it like the tank, planes, or anti vehicle options."

ifyoulikeblank,fp55aq5,t1_fp52xer,1588316776.0,"Yes No Mans Sky is epic, BUT you need to be ready to sink a lot of time into it to really enjoy the game. The only reason I stopped playing it was because one of the first updates after release broke my save of 100 hours on it. Another reason is university and to save my grades."
ifyoulikeblank,fp5544e,t3_gbak20,1588316599.0,"You would enjoy games like Uncharted, Spider-Man, maybe No Mans Sky, and Dreams is fun too. No Man’s Sky needs hours upon hours sunken into it. Spider-Man is absolutely fun but only PlayStation (as well as Uncharted). Dreams is fun if you understand modeling and designing your own games. It’s a lot to do and has other player worlds in it too."
DecidingToBeBetter,fp54q5k,t1_fp3az8t,1588316235.0,"It’s good to remove all social media for awhile (if you have any) and just remove yourself from the world to recalibrate yourself.

Told him he needed a appointment to get a genius to sit down with him when he insisted it was a virus. Told him I could text him when to come back and he argued he doesn’t text, but he only calls. Told him my system on texts and he demanded me to call him when we’re ready. I told him no, our system doesn’t let us. He then threw his laptop on the ground and left. Pleasant person."
LifeProTips,fp3hbbz,t3_gavmyw,1588279300.0,My cat likes to hide under the couch and/or the closet. My dog instantly runs to me and stays by my side. We had our alarm go off because a mouse chewed the wire and kept going off every hour for ten seconds a day.

AskReddit,fozcc8z,t3_gaarw1,1588188281.0,"All the redone transformers movies. It makes no sense to me to restart a series right after itself. If you don’t do a good job, just move on to the next series and don’t beat a dead horse."
vfx,foyrg6v,t3_gacjsw,1588177805.0,My only insight is maybe companies who censor would get less funding or loans. Another thought is that companies that censor can’t show movies in China anymore if they need to be censored. Like for instance Mulan can’t be altered for China and must be the same everywhere.
apexlegends,foymjjo,t3_ga1jpy,1588175205.0,The only way to make that jump is to place your jump pad on the ground next to the lava. I won a game by scaring someone with jumping over the railing.

suggestmeabook,foxv3fi,t3_g9owxy,1588157300.0,Just because it’s a anime doesn’t mean it’s not meant for adults. His films are multi layered and amazing. More story than most things out there today.
internetparents,foxv004,t3_ga1fjg,1588157211.0,"Anyone who doesn’t support gay marriage at this point is crazy. If believing it is a core value of yours, don’t settle. Settling will lead to depression and resentment from you."

StarWarsBattlefront,fovc6is,t3_g9qa0x,1588098868.0,This game is great if you put aside the controversy in the beginning. Dennis and the team did an amazing job bringing back the game and literally breathing new life into it. It make sense to stop support on a game after this long because now they would ( I assume ) a new game that has more content into it and will be much better than this one. We should start the conversation with Dennis and others ( again if they are making another one ) what we would want in the next game. I assume they do have a grasp of it after this though. So for now let’s give Dennis and his team a break and let them actually live their lives without hearing feedback on the game every day.
