UCI,fpmph7b,t3_ge9wqe,1588738367.0,"Excellent. When I took it he went over the latest and greatest in hybrid mobile architectures.  He‚Äôs young and it‚Äôs obvious he keeps up with the times. Totally refreshing and it helped keep me motivated. He‚Äôs humble and approachable and I can say without a doubt he was great to have as a resource during his office hours.  

Now compare that to dipshit Klefstad, dude has his big head so far up his ass despite being 20 years behind the times.

The course was a lot of work, and the learning curve on some of the topics was a bit rough but they are things you will realistically use in a future career. I have several projects that came from this class worth showing off to future employers.

Solo or group projects. You‚Äôre choice. 

I did not take 122b.  I did take 124 and would consider it harder than 124.  Also 124 used Java to create the projects which is not at all useful.

No midterms or finals just several quizzes."

I‚Äôm at 41% utilization. Down from 85%.  I noticed that I was paying 40-50 $ interest to CapitalOne every month. That‚Äôs insane. Luckily the more $ I save on interest payments the more I can divert to debt. 

So easy to push it up, takes forever to creep back down."

UCI,fo4jcvf,t3_g5md7w,1587505479.0,"International students are accepted at rates upwards of 60% at some UCs, so yes in a way he is absolutely right.  If he is an in-state applicant the rate is much much lower. 

Honestly it‚Äôs a condition of underfunding the UCs forcing campuses to rely on international tuition fees to subsidize in-state students. This is a well known issue with no known solution due to budgetary constraints.  International students should not get blamed. 

Here is an article discussing these metrics for reference:
