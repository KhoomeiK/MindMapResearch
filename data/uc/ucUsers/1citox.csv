UCI,fphttzr,t1_fp7gatj,1588627692.0,You're either really that dumb and clueless about how social media works or you're just pretending to be dumb to somehow push an agenda and either way I find it funny as fuck
UCI,fphg6yd,t3_gd42f8,1588620716.0,Maybe he thinks a curve means that people are guaranteed to fail? But typically when people say a class is curved they just mean there are free points given out at the end to raise everyone's grade lol
UCI,fp0r7jv,t3_gagjy3,1588215132.0,"Unless the policy is different for your school, since we have until week 10 to decide, I would literally wait until week 10 and see how your grade is looking before making that decision.

If you're stressed out, just keep it in the back of your mind that this is a no-risk quarter since you can always just switch to P/NP to avoid the gpa tank if you end up not doing so well :)"
GreenBayPackers,foky1pg,t1_fokxcpj,1587851121.0,"That's actually a common misconception. ""One hundred and ninety twoth"" is actually in the past perfect tense, and therefore would not work in the situation. I understand the mix up though."
GreenBayPackers,fokxmv7,t1_fokt2x7,1587850895.0,If you're so confident let's see a source
GreenBayPackers,foksx4r,t1_foksnu5,1587848332.0,Yeah that's a good point. One hundred and ninety seconth is just too formal for the situation.
GreenBayPackers,foksj5q,t1_fokrbk8,1587848117.0,Are you sure? I've heard it both ways
wallstreetbets,fnn9if8,t1_fnn1bjn,1587087367.0,"ðŸ˜” I'm getting tired of this nonsense it's like listening to a bernie bro whining that the primary was rigged just show me your all time chart that's the only chart that matters here you can send me these all day and it wont mean shit for various reasons. Apparently you're a prophet that should be managing every hedge fund ever I wonder why that hasnt happened ðŸ™„

If you're up significantly I'll give you the props you so badly want how about that. Not that it'll change anything."
wallstreetbets,fnd8n5s,t1_fnd8fe5,1586862880.0,"first of all its literally on their website, if all you found was a tweet... you didn't search very hard.

second searching literally ""jpm earnings"" or even just ""jpm"" results in like 20 articles about the report, so again... if all you found was a tweet, you really didn't search very hard"

UCI,fmy3rue,t1_fmv7erc,1586477494.0,It is absolutely possible to those creative enough. It's a high risk game but some people will play and when even a few succeed it already throws the integrity of the thing down the drain for those who dont cheat
MurderedByWords,fmpvhlg,t1_fmos2w5,1586288091.0,"It doesn't matter whether he's sick or not. He's the prime minister. There was always going to be resources set aside for him. Do you seriously think that just because he was healthy they would then use the resources set aside for him on someone else?? Its literally their responsibility to assume worst case scenario, and be prepared for that"

The fact that you wrote this shows your complete lack of self-awareness. In fact, that entire blurb you just wrote up was a pretty big turnoff. You're self-pitying while deflecting all the blame, and that is a pretty big indicator of an unattractive personality. I doubt you'll listen to this but hopefully, you take the wake-up call and learn to look within, and maybe take some time to work on yourself a little bit before you go out there looking for a girl.

Remember that it's all personality. Be a good person, be confident, you won't go wrong. Ever. Both aspects are very important. If you are a nice person but also the person that gets described as ""too nice"", that means you lack the confidence to stand up for yourself and doesn't even necessarily mean that you are nice- just that you are scared of confrontation. Be a good person, care about others, and have confidence. That's all you need to become a catch."
