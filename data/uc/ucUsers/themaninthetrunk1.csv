UCSantaBarbara,fpeax58,t1_fpe9t3g,1588543870.0,"My point wasn't to dissuade people from going to the hospital, I'm saying it's going to be insanely difficult to be treated for anything if America is reopened and a second wave hits."
UCSantaBarbara,fpe92hw,t1_fpe8s20,1588542798.0,A current low percentage doesn't mean that number won't drastically increase following reopening everything. That doesn't really help your argument; that isn't proof that social distance is ineffective or that COVID 19 isn't a concern.
UCSantaBarbara,fpe6zlf,t1_fpe6m95,1588541605.0,"Yeah. Literally, yes. Keep everything closed until a vaccine is released preventing widespread trauma dude. The consequences of a second wave is far worse than ""muh economy""."
UCSantaBarbara,fpe31r6,t1_fpe2gee,1588539362.0,"It's not just about the death rate, but the sheer amount of people who need hospitalization. What do you do when all the hospitals are full? I'm curious. Even if the death rate isn't high, the number of people will need hospitalization is too great to allow everything to reopen only for a significantly worse second wave *during flu season*. So not only is a second wave of COVID 19 possible, it, like the Spanish flu's second wave did, is capable of killing millions. The first wave of the Spanish flu didn't kill anywhere near as many people."
UCSantaBarbara,fpdkbvk,t1_fpdelhc,1588528681.0,"Even then, I'd still like to be able to go to the hospital, hard to do if it's full of COVID patients."
UCSantaBarbara,fpc0spf,t1_fpbzvae,1588484040.0,"I'm just curious, have you seen NYC's mass graves? Whack."
UCSantaBarbara,fmu9r4v,t1_fmu93cy,1586387199.0,"Thanks for the input!! I'm gonna just email Nguyen and my professor, I just hope more people end up emailing about this; the volume of emails the professor got in response to the readings definitely helped"
UCSantaBarbara,fkldx7q,t3_fj7gsh,1584304232.0,"Apparently 2/3rds of the class opted to take the final. I don't care if no one shows up, I'm taking it Wednesday lmao"
