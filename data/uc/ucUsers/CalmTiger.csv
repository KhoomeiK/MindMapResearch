nba,fpcbb0t,t1_fonfm19,1588494115.0,"This is too results focused, i think. The warriors played a system and this kind of fast break play is basically set piece for them. I believe you're saying he's in the wrong because he happened to turn the ball over in the play.

What im trying to say is that the play is extremely standard for them and we can only call it the ""wrong play"" in hindsight. With the available information from the time of rebound, I think the play was fine. It didn't work out in this instance, but it works out a lot of the time in the long run

(this is not to say KD is wrong here, just that both plays may have been viable and we cannot judge the decision making solely based on hindsight)"

leagueoflegends,fombgly,t1_foklw9n,1587884148.0,no one wants to watch the memphis grizzlies play the cleveland cavaliers and the nba doesn't force that down your throat because they know these teams are irrelevant
leagueoflegends,fombb1g,t3_g7tpdm,1587884005.0,i was 90% sure this is how it worked in LCK but now im not so sure
leagueoflegends,fomac87,t1_folt7x2,1587883124.0,That's pretty interesting if this is true. Do you have a source for this?
leagueoflegends,foma54w,t1_fol9wgc,1587882945.0,"chrome is a memory hog because every tab is rendered as a separate process and stored in the RAM. This is why you can switch tabs without the page reloading. However with the league client, you can see that the page reloads any time you change screen (loot page -> home page or home -> champ select, etc).

Makes no sense why the client should take this much ram"
leagueoflegends,fom9ufc,t1_folck06,1587882671.0,this happens occasionally in my soloq games. I dodged the first time it happened to me because I thought I was last pick...

worldnews,foe2h3e,t1_fodzzr8,1587694730.0,"Isn't this exactly how it works? You have to follow 'the law' or guys with guns come in and take your stuff by force. Contracts are only enforceable by the fact that the police (or some other power) can exert their power on you.

In international politics this is obviously a bit trickier, but we've seen superpowers bully small states for tithe throughout history, which is exactly what you're saying they can't do"

summonerschool,fnw0u6i,t1_fnvyq0b,1587309111.0,"Not exactly. the logic is that ez helps your team win by allowing support to roam. Because marksmen suck right now, it's better for support to have impact elsewhere than to help adc. Ezreal farms safely and gets carried. (But let's be honest, if you play adc these days, every win is adc getting carried)"
summonerschool,fnvvc7z,t3_g46iwq,1587305634.0,ADC meta is usually pretty clear cut. You could pick the same top 2 adcs every game (currently mf and ezreal) and it would be fine. Veigar bot isnt bad at all when you are full ad.

nba,fnonhhw,t1_fno8kce,1587129653.0,"This is the line of thinking I'm taking as well. If we interpret ""MVP"" as the player that contributed to the most wins per team, then I think the race should be between Harden and Lebron. This is simply because Harden and Lebron play insane minutes and/or have insane usage rates and therefore have more influence over their team's wins/losses."
