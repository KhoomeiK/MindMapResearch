I solved this problem by moving my entire storage to spawn chunks, which always are loaded. Not sure if this is viable for you. Perhaps another solution is to somehow permaload the chunks that your storage is location on (personally never actually dealt with permaloaders but I’ve seen tutorials online). Good luck!"

MinecraftHelp,fnpk0x0,t3_g36ldd,1587146853.0,"Two ways: mining and farming pigmen

Mining is easier but more labor intensive since you need to mine and smelt everything 

There are many ways to kill pigmen. The safest would be to build a pigmen farm in the nether. There are many tutorials online, so I’ll let you decide which farm you would build, as they range from easy to build to very complicated and resource intensive. 

I personally build the pigmen farm, because while it takes a much longer time to set up, it can be used pretty much forever and yield much more drops and xp as well

Ps: just FYI if you build a pigmen farm right now, it may not work anymore if you update your world later to the nether update!"
