I only know because I’m close to one of the professors being asked to teach CHEM 14AE. I don’t think many (if any) have really had much of an experience with it yet since it was so newly implemented."

ucla,fpg9q7t,t1_fpfoslx,1588597987.0,Lmaoooooo I’m a graduating biochem major and I have literally NEVER used a blue book in my 4 years here.
ucla,fpa9rpq,t1_foj99oq,1588443700.0,Oh I somehow completely missed this comment. Most people find Chem 156 to be a lot more tolerable than Chem 110A for two reasons: the math tends to not only be a bit simpler but more interesting given the biological applications. Sometimes it still takes some time to wrap your head around but the prof who taught me (Dr. Jose Rodriguez) was not really interested in making you do rigorous proofs/derivations but instead understand it conceptually.

ucla,fp8qy0i,t1_fp6ghmn,1588400100.0,"I think it really depends which plaza you get. Another user mentioned Hedrick Summit which is huge and majority freshmen, making it more likely to be social. But other plazas may not be as predominantly composed of freshmen, or may be more out of the way. Freshmen will be the ones who try to get out there and meet people while 2nd/3rd years are much more likely to keep to themselves. But with that said you can always go visit friends in other dorms, or go to events held in other dorms. I lived in a classic my first year and didn't have active RA's, so some of the ""social"" aspect of the classics was lost on me."
ucla,fp8ql0b,t1_fp6ytcy,1588399778.0,"I think how much time/money your CC credits will save you really depends on what classes you took at CC but if you want to do all that you mentioned at UCLA, it might be a year at best. 

As for financial aid, it's probably too late to ask now but I wonder if a financial aid appeal is possible for Stanford since there is a difference in how UCLA estimated your EFC compared to Stanford?

As for opportunities at UCLA (which I can speak about), it's probably true that you'll have better access to dance/performing opportunities here, speaking as someone who had a dance major as a roommate and who did a lot of creative projects on the side. The grading curves probably will be less generous, true, but for what it's worth I haven't experienced grade deflation as a biochem major (who took all the pre-req courses you'll need if you're pre-health). But, classes are not typically taught by TA's. Professors teach the vast majority of classes here, with TA's simply assisting in small sections for discussion. Both professors and TA's are nevertheless available through their office hours. There are some rare seminars where TA's (or even undergrads who specifically apply to do so) teach. But yeah. 

Unsure of how COVID-19 will affect undergraduate resources long-term, but there is supposed to be significant federal funding to assist with financial losses. I think at this time research in the foreseeable future will definitely be reduced, but as a matter of fact, reduced funding might mean research labs actually need more student volunteers... And there are plenty of labs at UCLA. As someone who's in the biomedical research minor, I know from my adviser that it's actually over 600 for the life sciences. So, plenty of opportunities particularly in biomedical research."

ucla,fp8p7vl,t1_fp7w6es,1588398596.0,"From memory of applying for financial aid for summer, this is normal. You’re supposed to confirm that nothing has changed after applying but I don’t recall if there’s a deadline to confirm once you’ve submitted. From what I remember, you’re actually not supposed to get the message asking you to confirm until after the deadline has passed."
ucla,fp48oks,t1_fp3p48z,1588293918.0,"Probs a fair assessment for any class though IMO it’s the least bad of the chem classes that are 3 weeks (all things being held equal, like assuming no prior knowledge which I know a lot of people do have for gen chem). I always felt like chem 14C had the least going on content wise and was mainly conceptual.

Also, to OP, I’ve sat in a few times on Pham teaching a 3 week course (although it was 30B not 14C which is honestly probably harder). If you really want to do it, he’s your guy. Very accommodating. He knows it’s crazy to do it in 3 weeks and constantly tries to adjust the course based on getting feedback from everyone in the class to make it easier and fair. He also curved the class more heavily in the end if I recall correctly."
ucla,fp0j5zi,t1_fp0id75,1588210322.0,"I don’t want this to come off as harsh, but definitely not easier for honors classes. Smaller classes actually tend to be harder to get because there are fewer seats. In larger classes there are more people who are inevitably indecisive and usually some people drown. Also, yeah unfortunately the honors college doesn’t restrict honors courses to honors college students. Sometimes you do have to get instructor permission to enroll though, but there are also so many people in the honors college that generally it’s just not very easy."
ucla,foykfmq,t3_ga74ff,1588174124.0,"Hey, a premed friend of mine interested in forensic science is doing anthro BS. For premed it doesn’t really matter what undergrad major you’re doing - what matters is your ability to demonstrate high achievement within your chosen major (through a high GPA and capability of balancing this with volunteering, research, extracurriculars etc.). The one caveat is that obviously those who chose non-conventional majors have to be really determined since there would be little overlap between their major prep/coursework and the pre-med reqs. 

For anthro BS, you would still have a lot of overlap. You’d be doing all of the bio (LS 7ABC + 23L lab). You’d be doing majority of chem (CHEM 14ABC +BL lab) and all of physics (PHYSICS 5ABC) and all of whichever math series you choose. 

But you’d need to add on chem 14D + chem 14CL, in addition to biochemistry (CHEM 153A) as pre-med reqs. And along the way get a year of English/Writing II done. 

Sorry I’m not anthro so I can’t speak to what it’s like, but hopefully that helps. Anthro lower div requires for its major that you do 4 anthro classes - maybe it’d be worthwhile for you to try the first to see if it pertains to your interests?"
ucla,forulgz,t1_forl8xi,1588018783.0,"I think MIMG and MCDB are pretty similar in difficulty and they’re kind of like “sister” majors. I think people tend to view physci as more difficult than the two but that may come down to personal preference. 

Bio definitely is generally considered less difficult, but I would consider whether it even falls within your interest as a lot of the reqs are geared toward ecology (although there’s flexibility in electives and whatnot). But those core classes from what I’ve heard tend to be more straightforward multiple choices / memorization type classes. 

IMO it’s more important to still make sure that your major is something you like learning so that you’re motivated to do well!"
ucla,fomtmr3,t3_g85r0h,1587903422.0,"LS 2 in summer because I was stupid and thought I could deal with 3 hour lectures. 
Also LS 3 b/c it was just a bad quarter. I literally cried during the final while talking to the prof about how bad I was about to do, and she told me how she had a literal F on her transcript and C’s in physics to make me feel better OMG"
ucla,fomsbyf,t1_fom4xcv,1587902120.0,"She just said that it tends to be tricky, but I guess I can’t really know what that means as I’m not an MIMG major myself. The only thing I’ve otherwise consistently heard is that the immunology class you have to take is really tough, but otherwise I think everything else should at least be manageable. Sorry for not being able to help more"
ucla,foj7dmi,t1_foi6tc3,1587811312.0,Congrats!!! Welcome to biochem from a graduating senior in biochem :))
ucla,foj7a68,t1_foihfqq,1587811204.0,"Yeah as another person said Berkeley and UCLA are about on par based on prestige. Honestly if you’re concerned about whichever is better you should look more closely at the individual department for which you think you’ll be going into. This will also have weight depending on if you’re going to pursue grad school. 

Also, this happened to my friend and TBH he made he decision mainly based on not wanting to wait a semester to go to Berkeley although he did like UCLA better."
ucla,foj72rg,t1_foio5lw,1587810969.0,"I haven’t experienced grade deflation here as a biochem major. Physics tends to get curved up in your favor, although it really varies by professor I think. As another user mentioned, the scaling for an A also starts lower for biochem. With that said, that doesn’t mean the grading isn’t sometimes a pain in the ass to deal with. But the grading itself shouldn’t get you. My friend has more trouble with how the MIMG department tests even though she likes the material."
ucla,foeohk9,t1_foemucu,1587709534.0,"Uh I was bored over summer and I found my passion in biostats so I literally read everything and did all of the textbook problems too. 

If you paid attention during lecture you don’t really need any of it unless you want it or just want to check something quickly. His course reader sometimes goes into more detail than you need for the exams, something that he confirmed to me when I spoke to him in office hours. But that is definitely essentially what he goes over in class, just with some extra bits that are obvious since he won’t have covered it. It’s decent review if you want but again lecture is sufficient. 

Also, I fact checked like everything like a freak so I can tell you that there’s a couple minor inconsistencies between how the book calculates IQR vs how he does it, so always defer to how Dr. Lee does it. 

Additionally, don’t always trust that things posted on CourseHero are 100% accurate unless they’re one of his keys. I say this because I found errors in grading, and although I know they didn’t mean anything of it, it started to annoy me when my classmates would ask me “why X was right” when it was wrong but marked right bc the TAs were lenient. I’ve seen T/F graded wrong on coursehero also. And my own TA originally graded my midterm wrong and I had to go ask for my points back b/c I literally wrote the same answer as the answer key and showed all my work  but a TA decided to go rogue my quarter and ignore it 🤪."
ucla,foelmu2,t3_g72mpy,1587707109.0,"Yeah, took it with him in summer and got an A+. You are indeed allowed a cheat sheet. My advice is always to make it partly conceptual and partly application, as in you should write down both important definitions / equations (concepts) and example problems. 

If you’ve done the sample exams and can not only answer them but justify your answers and convince yourself of why, I think you’re set to go. This is how I ended up being able to get a depth of understanding, and why I ended up getting 100% on both midterms and I believe nearly 100% on the final (which I know I must have as I asked him and he said 395/400 aka 98.75% is an A+ lmfao). 

Don’t over think it. The labs are largely coding and you just need to be able to read any data output from it, which is simple and not really any different from any of the problems you’re already asked to do. 

His first midterm exam almost always includes a question asking you to categorize data as ratio, interval, rank, nominal... one question on types of sampling... one question on sensitivity vs specificity, one question with T/F statements (which will be mostly definition questions from lecture), and some simple calculation questions. It’s super predictable."

ucla,fo99h69,t1_fo96cah,1587613690.0,"The math 31/32 series is calc for physical scientists / engineers and is more rigorous in terms of theory and proofs. If you’re not inclined toward math / fear being challenged then I’d either avoid this or take these classes during an off quarter. 

The math 3 series is calculus for life science students and is more application based as it relates to the life sciences. 

The LS 30 series is also math for life science students but is more coding than calculus. Also application based. People tend to tell life science majors to take this since it’s “the easiest.”"
ucla,fo8o0yr,t3_g67ftf,1587600353.0,"I’ve taken him for chem 14B in summer 2017. Very fair exams, with problems taken straight from the book / suggested homework problems. Pretty clear when lecturing. Never went to OH personally so not sure what those are like. I personally thought his attitude at times about lecturing us to do chem for X amount of hours per week was a little off putting but I always hate when professors do that. 

I don’t think he’s taught chem 14A in a minute but one of my friends who graduated took him for chem 14A CSI and really liked him."
nintendo,fnuu5z0,t3_g3ptch,1587271169.0,"Going back home as a graduating senior was deeply saddening at first.

In essence, I’m happy to get to spend at least 4 months consecutively with my family for the first time in 5 years, something I would not have been able to otherwise do in the foreseeable future.  Now I get to see my cute mom every day and we switch off between cooking for each other :)"
ucla,fnjdac1,t1_fnidsch,1586996652.0,"Well... if you’re undeclared physical science, you’re going to take physical science courses. The common denominator between most of those majors is going to be math and physics. Probably some chem too. And of course you’ll want to take all the series that are intended for physical scientists / engineers. This will tend to be heavier in workload/difficulty but if this is what you like, then I’d say stick with it. 

But you don’t need to decide too quickly. Everyone needs to do Gen Ed classes, and since you’re in the College of Letters and Sciences, it’s pretty simple and there’s a lot of variety for you to choose from."
ucla,fnf5w9f,t1_fnbtsh5,1586901983.0,"Hey, I’m OOS from MN too. If you’re premed you should really consider how much money you’ll have to sink into med school too, so financially staying in MN is probably the best decision. I have def loved UCLA though and I think it was the right decision although it came down to 25-35k/year w/ financial aid + help from parents for me. 

But I believe it comes down to what you value most. I honestly just wanted to get out of MN and had always been planning a move to California, and wanted the opportunities that came with UCLA where I felt like I would be inspired and challenged. I paid a lot for this, I know, but I knew I would have been super depressed at UMN."
ucla,fnf4n8w,t1_fndyjtb,1586901327.0,"Biochem major here. I have never taken a class here that has curved my grade down, only up. There are only a few of those here at UCLA, tbh, probably more clustered in engineering and a few here and there in other departments. That doesn’t mean the classes or grading is always perfect, and it can sometimes feel like they’re making you jump through hoops in lower div. But in numerical terms, there isn’t really downcurving in the departments you’re asking about."

ucla,fn6wvp5,t1_fn51cmf,1586708930.0,"Generally, I think so. I had the same sort of thing in Minnesota for a French class that was an equivalent course offered at the U of MN, and they counted it for French credit here (although I didn’t need it since I also just took the AP Chinese exam to get out of the language requirement). It just showed up on my DARS (degree audit report system) on my MyUCLA account."
ucla,fn6wdsr,t1_fn6dch4,1586708649.0,"Yep, 3 different types of honors. There’s the college honors program, Latin honors, and oftentimes departmental honors (which will be described on the department website.

ucla,fn44rpg,t1_fn4313z,1586634043.0,"The funny thing is the biomedical research minor is a huge GPA booster. The classes are meant to challenge you as a scientist, so that’s sort of the baseline expectation all the time, but the methodology they do to do that doesn’t translate to overworking you or damaging your GPA. In BMD RES 5HB, people do spend usually 40-60 hours getting experience writing a research proposal. But that’s a great skill anyway. Otherwise, it’s small problem sets, doing presentations, reading papers, participating in class discussions. It’s not bad in terms of work load, since you do a lot during class. If you check out the grade distributions, you’re essentially expected to get A’s in every class held in the minor. And 199 research also tends to be a free A from your PI."

It may be a challenge to transition - but know that there are definitely resources / friendly people here to help. And as others have stated, you were selected for a reason. So don’t count yourself out before you’ve even tested the waters! You may surprise yourself and realize, that just because you’re going to a prestigious university doesn’t mean that your strengths are no longer strengths for you. People do often talk about realizing how succeeding in high school was being a big fish in a small pond, but it’s very possible that you can still be a big fish at UCLA in some respects still. That happened to me for chemistry - although I also worked very hard to develop good study skills. And I think the reassuring thing is that that is something you can always improve, and can go such a long way even if you do need some time to catch up. Good luck!!!"

So you’ve worked in Robert’s office. Why is he a fool? 

“Mess up our GPA,” “take away letter grading, “make sure these shenanigans don’t happen again” - can you explain using less biased language (lmfao) what actually happened?

ucla,fmsk4xm,t1_fmnsnmk,1586357054.0,"You’re mainly going to have to apply to outside scholarships since UCLA apparently couldn’t afford to keep giving OOS students need-based financial aid (especially grants) after 2015. Source: was part of the 2015 admitted class that fortunately still had a non-resident grant, then deferred a year and was confused why all my OOS friends had no financial aid until I read up on it. 

There are still scholarships at UCLA that you can still apply for, so check that out. But like another user said, weigh your options carefully. I made another comment on here a couple weeks back, trying to let OOS admits that it’s true none of my many OOS friends fully regret choosing UCLA (except for one), but they didn’t fully realize what they were getting into. 

If you’re considering med/law school or a master’s where you’ll be funneling more money into your education also consider staying in-state to save up for those expenses. On the flip side, it is also true that there are phenomenal opportunities at UCLA and it has been a fun experience - but also definitely don’t come here with the mentality that the name of the school will do you any big favors. You still have to search for opportunities yourself, and there is definitely pressure to out-compete your already competitive peers to get those opportunities and make the most of your time here, even if the overall environment here is friendly."
ucla,fmsi2s0,t1_fmrltso,1586355902.0,"Hey, I’m a 4th year biochem major. You can skip the first (of two) gen chem course (CHEM 20A) of the physical science series with a 5 in AP chem, although they don’t recommend it because it’s supposed to help you transition into life at UCLA. Also not recommended if you’re premed, since many medical schools don’t recognize AP credit. As another person mentioned, get a 5 in calc BC and you can skip 2 out of 3 calc courses required. AP bio/psych would only give you units toward graduation, not anything specific toward the major (in other words, you would still need to take  all life science classes).
 
Source for the AP chem credit info: the chemistry department FAQ page, if you were wondering."
ucla,fmmqhs2,t1_fmhbhbh,1586210144.0,"1. I do think it can sometimes be a barrier but I believe there are places that accommodate for quarter system students and that generally there are enough opportunities for internships if you look hard enough that you can still make it work - whether it's during the year or the summer. But, I'm not absolutely sure since I'm in the life sciences and you're looking at CS/engineering I think, so YMMV.
2. This is of course gonna vary somewhat depending on you - your strengths, study habits, goals, class schedule for any specific quarter, and major. We have 10 weeks of instruction + 1 week of finals in a quarter. Midterms for STEM majors tend to come in two rounds, typically between Week 3-9 (but weirdly enough can extend to Week 2-10). I'd say the most common is Week 4/5 and 7/8. So, there's usually a lull at the beginning of the quarter, a lull between the two rounds of midterms, and  another small breather right after the second round of midterms before finals. It can be exhausting, but usually there's enough of a break between each set of exams that I can recover and feel all right. When you're taking GE's, you'll usually have a bit more time as they tend not to be as intensive. And as you get better at managing time, you'll be able to free up more time in your schedule. 
3. North campus and mid-campus (humanities, social sciences) classes tended to be graded on an absolute scale. In my south campus (STEM) classes, I've had a range of things. Math/physics classes tend to be curved, usually curved up since the scores are low although physics 4BL was notorious for being one of the classes that genuinely deflated grades. My chem classes have usually followed an adjusted absolute scale, where an A may be in the 80's, and can be changed to curve everyone up depending on how we do on the exams. Life sci usually leans more toward absolute scale. Inflation/deflation just depends but I'd say grades are mostly fair. 
4. Enrollment can definitely be tricky, since it's based on units and then you're randomly assigned a pass after that. You do have a first and second pass, so people are limited as to how much they can enroll in during the first pass. That way, everyone prioritizes 2 classes they want to get into, so you should get \*something\* your first pass. But it can often end up being a game during second pass and after to see when spots will open up, as well as asking professors for permission to enroll."
