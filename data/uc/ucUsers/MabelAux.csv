madlads,fpf6qtm,t1_fpf3q1t,1588563126.0,I have never had such a satisfying cackle as the one I got when I reached this part of the comments. Thank you.
ucr,fpe6d47,t3_gcxp5n,1588541250.0,I am really sorry this is happening to you. I was lucky enough to get a professor who cut down class time/recording time to accommodate students who needed to go to work or their next online classes. I hope your professor gets it together and makes it fair!
