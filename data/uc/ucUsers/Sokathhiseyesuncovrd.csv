datingoverthirty,fp4bom1,t3_gb4xqq,1588295653.0,"I don't function like that at all. I've stayed friends/friendly with all my exes in some capacity, even if we're just Facebook friends and wish each other happy birthday once a year.

That's the lowest level. I stay in contact via text/e-mail/phone with others if they live far away, or I see others in person if we live in the same area. Not all the time, of course, but lunch or dinner 2-3 times a year.

Why not still have some relationship since you *did* share so much? Cutting off contact has never made sense to me, unless there was betrayal of some sort involved. That hasn't happened to me (luckily)."

FreeEBOOKS,fozhew1,t3_g9r97p,1588190704.0,"To say this is a hodge podge is putting it mildly! I looked through more of these than I probably should have. As you get deeper in, you start seeing typos in the titles and legit broken English. 

I'm also filled with questions! Can people really make money publishing short stories, repackaged public domain material, and/or instructions anyone can Google for free? 

Not to hate, OP, I did find a few things. :) It is fascinating, though. Here are my top three crazy finds:

datingoverthirty,foz5f0u,t3_ga9p8b,1588184983.0,"I came from a family that ‘teased,’ and it seemed normal to me as I was growing up. In one of my first serious relationships in my early 20s, I teased my boyfriend in front of his dad. Teasing was usually based around giving someone shit for something they liked or took pleasure in, and my boyfriend had never called me out on it, but also never gave it back, so it didn’t escalate.

That day, though, my jape was met with an awkward silence and a sort of puzzled, horrified look from his dad. I can’t even remember anything else but my feelings of flaming embarrassment and being outclassed. That was when I started to realize that teasing wasn’t normal (neither is tickling!!) and could often be hurtful. I’d experienced that hurt myself when teasing went too far, but was always told that I was just too sensitive and ‘ruining the fun.’ I tried to be a good sport about teasing because of this, but was sometimes hiding pain.

Maybe this guy grew up in an even worse atmosphere and doesn’t realize how insulting he’s being. You can let him know without getting angry or taking it too personally. Just say, “it hurts my feelings when you say something like that.” It may not work out for you guys, but maybe he’ll get a clue later in life. I did."

Biohackers,fnqbnam,t1_fnq79hi,1587161476.0,"Oh, I am by far no expert.

I would suggest looking at some of the resources compiled by Fallon (like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQT786lOqIY) comparing 4 different brands, or [this review](https://gonootropics.com/modaheal-200mg-review)). He does sell some content, but he also puts a ton of information out there for free, and does monthly giveaways.

You might also try asking in the forum he hosts: https://gonootropics.com/forums/index.php

As always, please do your own research from a lot of different sources. I did, and he's one I've come to trust re. vendors and products."
Biohackers,fnq3ygk,t1_fnq311c,1587157224.0,"It's definitely legitimate. 

Technically, I think it is supposed to be prescribed, but especially in the Silicon Valley start up/nootropic stack culture, usage is extremely common. It's very easy to get.

Edit for clarity: usage without a prescription"

printSF,fmuqv2u,t3_fxexwq,1586396917.0,"This is a bit different than what you're asking for, but The Dead Zone, by Stephen King.

This is always the book I recommend to people who want to try King but ""don't like horror."" The characterization is excellent, and you really feel for Johnny after he wakes up from his 5-year coma. Technology can sometimes change a lot in 5 years. Imagine sleeping through the rise of social media, or the pandemic!

In Johnny's situation, he wakes up with abilities he didn't have before, so he explores what it means to live with them."

I feel lulled by the toaster ovens, though. They sound harmless, but can get much hotter than a regular toaster and may not auto-off, depending on the setting. You're also more likely to put something flammable in them because the items are flat. You can't do that with vertical toaster slots."
