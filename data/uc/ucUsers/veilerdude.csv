He wrote like a somewhat abstract definition of what discrete functions are, I think essentially he said that it looks like a histogram (the kind with a bunch of flat lines as a piecewise function) as opposed to continuous, which is like a curve (like normal distribution). Except all that in 3 rows of symbols that usually only math majors would deal with"

berkeley,fpi9jm4,t1_fpi90yz,1588636381.0,"Sorry, I actually read through the whole article via a de-blocker thing because the article was blocked for me, which only shows article text. That said, you did say ""the article mentioned,"" so I didn't even think to look at an image caption. I've lived in Berkeley for 6 months.

Thank you for your perspective though, now I'll look more into this type of racial violence to see if it's something I need to learn about.

Thanks for being understanding

Edit: What do you think of this?

I did also come across this, which was way more clearly as perhaps a hate crime than the one we're talking about:

[https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/police-investigate-video-of-asian-man-being-attacked-as-possible-hate-crime/](https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/police-investigate-video-of-asian-man-being-attacked-as-possible-hate-crime/)

Looks like a combination of ""cultures clashing"" and focusing on race, both in the Black and Asian communities. Black on Asian crime statistically looks to be not an anomaly, but maybe when it happens it could have a racial focus sometimes by the perpetrator (which is wrong ofc) and sometimes the victims (which is not fair) because of ""us vs. them."""

I couldn't find the mention in your first article. I also personally kept in mind that Asians are also the largest racial population there. I'm just questioning if this is really racial and has to divide people even more (which of course is warranted if it was racial) or rather a criminal beating up a weak, elderly person (which would lead to different action being taken to solve the problem). I don't know why it has to get so personal. I genuinely have not heard of *physical* racial violence against Asians being prevalent enough to immediately suspect that."

 I didn't say I don't feel bad for her. If I focused more on the news than the debate, I would just be talking about that. I'll admit that I'm numbed to media stories about horrible things like this, but I don't think that's my fault or at all unique to me."

todayilearned,fo62vcw,t1_fo2bcyq,1587544451.0,"I will ignore all the sassy one-word responses, if you don't understand what I meant there are respectful ways to say it. Overall, what I meant previously is that you are the one being pedantic by arguing over denotations. I had no intent of being pedantic, and I've already said that I would be happy to loosen the absoluteness of my opinion. What actually matters is the opinion and it's consequences, not any of the stuff you attacked.

I think saying ""billionaires shouldn't exist"" is more of a catchy phrase than a plan in any way. For example, I agree that individuals are too rich today, but not all of them. From what I can tell, Elon Musk has done more to advance society than the government ever will with his few billion. He's more of an exception though, probably, but these people have to somehow be taken into account. Also, when Bezos has $110 billion (which I agree is due to an almost monopoly these days) it's just unreasonable to say that he deserves less than 1% of that."
todayilearned,fo2a3lf,t1_fo29rys,1587454728.0,"You're right, I should have reread it carefully. I don't think any of what you're saying changes anything, you think generally you can't make a lot of money morally and I think you can, over even the opposite. Why is the whole body of all of your replies about pedantics, how am I being the pedant? Make a quick statement about it and then if you have a reply maybe we can discuss it"
todayilearned,fo29bff,t1_fo28u6g,1587453949.0,"Okay, if your absolute statement was about a general reality then so was mineâ€”my point is that there are multiple ways to make money without being immoral. Although you could always pay employees more, you're only immoral if you exploit a monopoly you have on workers (i.e. if you're the only big employer in a city then people have no choice but to take your low wages)."
