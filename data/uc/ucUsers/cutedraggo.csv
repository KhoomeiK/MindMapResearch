berkeley,foz2q03,t1_foxq6um,1588183677.0,"I wouldn't say they ""misreported"" data, but this is definitely case of improper interpretation of statistics.

The authors utilized a new antibody test to assay COVID-19 status in their volunteers (a huge amount of sampling bias already) instead of the traditional RT-PCR tests. The antibody tests are cheaper and faster, but there's a high false positive rate, which we know can be as high as almost 2% (i.e. if you take all of the positive hits from the test, 2% of them could be wrong). They used this test on their shitty sample and found that the proportion of people who tested positive for COVID-19 was an additive 2% more than the previous numbers reported using RT-PCR.

Subsequently, they use this to justify that COVID-19 is not very deadly because the number of cases is actually so much higher than we think it is, so we're all overreacting.

But wait! They're using a test with a 2% false-positive rate to show a 2% increase in positives. So...even if you ignore the blatant sampling issues, it would be completely reasonable to say that the only reason why they saw this increase in positives is because their tests introduced them as false positives."

berkeley,fowhdqd,t3_g9yy56,1588119812.0,"I wasn't pre-med, but I ended up double-majoring in CS and integrative biology. It's definitely possible (obviously), but it will be difficult to take any courses that don't satisfy at least one requirement somewhere. I usually found myself taking 4 - 5 technicals a semester. Signing up for classes also becomes annoying because pretty much every class is required.

If you're planning on doing this, you should start taking the pre-med/bio classes right away.

I believe you should declare your major before your third year, but I think this is a soft deadline."
berkeley,fow4fh4,t3_g9vxb0,1588112823.0,"Here's an [ars Technica article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/experts-demolish-studies-suggesting-covid-19-is-no-worse-than-flu/) that also describes a lot of similar issues with the Ioannidis ""studies"", with a little more detail.

I am still completely floored by the fact that they relied on a test with a 2% false positive rate to try and show an increase of 2% positives."
berkeley,fovxz0m,t1_fovx3oa,1588109493.0,"Because just 1 throwaway would be too one-sided, of course :)"
berkeley,fovxcnx,t1_fovtxfm,1588109175.0,"I don't think you have to worry about that here. Firstly, I haven't heard of any situations where people felt like the professors were trying hard to push a very single-sided agenda rather than presenting literature and evidence, and explaining the logical conclusions that others have made.

There are also a few things to keep in mind:  
1. Sometimes, a ""single-sided agenda"" is the correct thing to present. What may seem like an opinion-based worldview to us may be, in fact, incorrect based on scientific or sociological data/observation, so just because something seems single-sided, it doesn't mean it's suboptimal.

2. Even if a professor is presenting a single-sided viewpoint, it is arguably an intentionally beneficial style of teaching. These are researchers with training who have spent a long time studying a problem, and we as students learn from their point of view.  


In short, I don't think anyone should go into university thinking that some classes should be avoided because they only present one side of the story. Sometimes, that one side turns out to be the most correct. And other times, it's worth listening to these opinions that are informative themselves."
berkeley,fovhyjf,t3_g9kapr,1588101626.0,"""Bro"" is also acceptable. Of course, there are is feminine equivalent ""Bra"", and the gender-neutral ""Bruh"""
berkeley,fovhlh8,t1_foudqyi,1588101449.0,"If you're coming in with the mindset that there are some classes you want to avoid because you don't like the ideas being taught, then I'm afraid you're in the wrong place. If I were you, I'd do the opposite. Look for classes that are teaching something you don't understand and perhaps don't agree with, and take those classes to learn more. Remember, you're a student who is trying to pick up knowledge from people who are more erudite than you are."
berkeley,foo7nis,t3_g8fzd0,1587934091.0,I don't think math is a natural science...
berkeley,foici9j,t1_foi3wfx,1587783488.0,"In addition to all of the requirements of the major within the CoE, you'd also have to satisfy CoE's college breadth requirements (although the L&S breadth should cover that for the most part). Since CoE is not your home college, you'd also have to apply for the degree similar to someone who wishes to transfer colleges. If this is interesting to you, you should talk to an adviser in L&S and CoE!"
berkeley,foi3me4,t1_fohzj98,1587778038.0,"Have you considered a simultaneous degree with BioE? A simultaneous degree is just Cal's way of saying ""double major where the second major is in another college"""
berkeley,fo92wmw,t1_fo8xja7,1587609318.0,This took me way too long to figure out haha
berkeley,fo92tjr,t3_g6dqgk,1587609265.0,"I knew a few people in my high school who picked Cal over Stanford. One of them was an English major, and she felt Cal's English program was superior in quality. Someone else I knew was really interested in AI and ML, and he really liked the research at Cal for this. I think cost might also have been a factor (my high school is in CA)."
berkeley,fo4xe6k,t1_fo4w873,1587513096.0,"Believe me, the difference is obvious. Once you grade 300 exams, you'll also start to see the distinction between someone who knows what they're doing but has trouble remembering or has test anxiety, versus someone who coasted their way through the problem sets and has no idea what is going on."
berkeley,fo1skey,t1_fo1jll0,1587440522.0,"Not only do we track this, we also track your anxiety levels through the speed of your clicks as you navigate the course website and the Piazza posts.

JK. Gradescope doesn't show that information at all."
berkeley,fo0y86h,t1_fo0xanb,1587422035.0,"It varies. Similarity of answers is often the initial seed of suspicion. As the semester progresses, we might notice similarity on exams to other students, similarity to online solutions, etc. Another thing that often comes up is if a student usually does poorly on exams and homeworks, but does incredibly well on one particular assessment. That can also rouse suspicion."
berkeley,fo0xqwu,t1_fo0xfad,1587421768.0,"This semester might be different, I'm not sure. I'm not in CS 70 (or even Cal anymore). Regardless, even if there is no curve this semester, I don't think it should excuse any cheating in any way.

Edit: There's also the ""unofficial curve"", wherein future homeworks/exams will be written to be easier or harder based on how students perceive past assessments."
berkeley,fo0x2i1,t1_fo0usmi,1587421392.0,"If someone does something bad and they're afraid of getting caught, I don't think we should blame the system for causing extra stress. Not that cheating should be equated to crime, but the legal system in most developed countries also tends to give more leniency to those who confess. I think it's a very reasonable thing to do.

Furthermore, I think a pandemic or other crisis merits certain clemency, such as late drops and easier grading, but it does not excuse cheating, which harms the performance of other students and the integrity of the institution. Leeway should be given for a lot of things, but it doesn't include conduct violations."
berkeley,fo0ug1f,t1_fo0rw6j,1587419969.0,"Its exactly because the FN rate is so high that they send it to everyone. That way, they are able to induce confessions from people who cheated but did not pass the stringent threshold. It's a pretty good system, to be honest."
berkeley,fo0qixn,t1_fo0ov91,1587417908.0,"The cheating filter has very high specificity, not very high sensitivity (i.e. false positive rate is very low, false negative rate is very high), so it's very unlikely that someone who didn't cheat gets suspected/accused.

As someone who used to be on course staff for CS 70, I can say that at least when I was there, we were very careful to only flag someone if we were highly confident. There's a reason why these cheating notices only get posted near the end of a semester; it's because a lot goes into this. In my time, I have only come across one situation where someone was flagged for cheating when they didn't actively cheat, and it was because someone else copied their homework without their knowledge."
berkeley,fo0p504,t3_g51182,1587417174.0,"It has been serious before, so it is likely to be serious now.

My friend's roommate was flagged for copying on a CS 70 problem set, and he didn't ""confess"". He actually did get reported to the OSC. He did not get expelled, but he did fail the course and had to retake it. This was also back when you could retake a failed course to declare CS.

Empty threats are not useful, because if people know that the threats are empty (or even suspect they are), then they no longer have power. Threats of consequences are only useful if they follow through, at least in some capacity.

Personal opinion no one asked for: people who cheat deserve to be caught and face the consequences; cheating affects the grading curve to directly impact everyone else, and it cheapens the hard work of honest students. If this is you, 'fess up, take the relatively minor hit, learn from it, and move on."
berkeley,fo0a1ah,t1_fnyhzii,1587408751.0,"Funny story: about 8 years ago, there was an offering of Math 1B at Freshman Edge with a notoriously difficult professor. The course had only \~20 people enrolled in it. The grade breakdown for that semester was as follows: 50% Fs, 25% Cs, a handful of Bs, one A-, one A, and one A+.

Source: one of my friends, who was in that class and got one of the Bs."
berkeley,fo09s7i,t1_fnye2s3,1587408608.0,"There's a ton of queer clubs like QSA, CalQ&A, oSTEM, etc. There's also QARC (Queer Alliance and Resource Center), which can act as a hub for all of them."

berkeley,fny4n7b,t1_fny0f5j,1587353304.0,"Eh, it wasn't too bad. It was mainly just a less modern version of bCourses/Canvas. One thing I remember clearly, though, was that it was notoriously difficult to download multiple files at once. You had to install Cyberduck or something similar to do it.

berkeley,fnxjz34,t3_g4h0l7,1587340217.0,"I often reminisce about the bSpace days...

Wait, no I don't."
berkeley,fdc0tto,t3_ek9394,1578264921.0,"You can definitely do a double major in MCB/IB, with CS or DS. I would recommend it because the courses that each bioinformatics or comp bio specifically often don't go into enough detail into the underlying biology to foster a true understanding and appreciation of the problems/solutions. There are drawbacks, however. One of the drawbacks is that every class you take has to account for some major or graduation requirement (if you wish to graduate in 4 years), and that amounts to taking 4-5 technicals almost every semester."
