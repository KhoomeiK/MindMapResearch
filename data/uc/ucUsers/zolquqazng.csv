ucr,fpdk5a0,t3_gcqizs,1588528575.0,"This might sound crazy to undergrads who are used to being treated like shit, but hiring/admissions committees care about a lot more than just grades, and one quarter of S/NC is absolutely not going to make a difference on their decisions! Could you imagine them saying ""this student is dedicated and experienced and has excellent grades, but they have one quarter of S's that the university mandated. guess that invalidates the rest of their application!"" 

I know this because I'm a graduate student about 5 years out of college, with lots of friends who have either gotten baller jobs or into graduate programs, so I've heard a lot of the behind the scenes of these committees. Trust me when I say they're human and they're trying to take everything into account!"
ucr,fpbjeli,t1_fpbhoq7,1588471386.0,that's not true. graduate schools would absolutely understand that there's a global pandemic and that you had no choice over the grading system. it would also not hurt your gpa (especially Harvard's system). nobody is trying to punish you for stuff that's out of your control. source: am graduate student and talk to profs on the admissions committee

COMPLETEANARCHY,fovt4ti,t1_fov82gh,1588107068.0,">peak white leftism

this is liberal identity politics at its worst. all you're doing is advocating for preserving anti-democratic systems that have disenfranchised people of color for centuries. if you think voting for Biden means a step in the direction of liberation for women, or LGBT people, or indigenous people, or undocumented immigrants, or system-impacted people (ie prisoners), et-fucking-cetera, you are off your god damned rocker. you need to look at the material consequences of systems you're supporting, not just make declarations that people who disagree with you are somehow blinded by whiteness."

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,for693b,t1_for2zxr,1588006880.0,">healthy attitude to cultivate

completely irrelevant to the discussion. it's certainly not healthy for me to think about how capitalism is destroying the planet & millions of lives in various ways, but that doesn't mean it's not happening, and it doesn't mean there is nothing to be done about it. so responding to a critique (and coping mechanisms) of systemic patriarchy with ""that's not healthy"" does absolutely nothing for anyone.  so let people on the internet vent how they want and leave up to their therapists to decide if it's healthy.

>saying ""Men suck"" isn't just going to hurt men

as an AMAB, I have never related myself to the subject of those comments, in particular when they're in response to a screen-capped convo as they often are (edit: this first sentence is not my whole argument please read the rest of the comment before you go off). it's pretty clear to me that when people say ""men suck"" or ""male fragility"" they mean ""men who do X suck"" and ""this is a particular example of male fragility,"" and not that all men suck universally in exactly the same way. this is very different than the patriarchal rhetoric of ""man up"" or ""boys don't cry"" that *actually* reinforces the idea that men can't express emotion. instead, it's pointing out manifestations of male behavior that conform to toxic masculinity in an effort to both cope with it as those often on the receiving end, and to dismantle it by showing men that this behavior is not acceptable. sorry for what you're going through but I think you're blaming the wrong people here"

androidapps,fmmuddp,t3_fw2hkt,1586212259.0,"spotify worked fine on my s9 for a while, but I think there was some update about a year ago that totally ruined its functionality. I've figured out that it can't do anything while downloading and if I try it breaks the app and I have to restart my phone. if I wait until its done downloading, it's better but still pretty slow and sometimes just refuses to load certain playlists, artist pages, etc. if I want consistent functionality off wifi I need to only use pre-downloaded playlists.

I don't get it. my gf has a s10+ and its fine. It seems to just be a flip of a coin whether it works on your phone or not. Shitty app design."
