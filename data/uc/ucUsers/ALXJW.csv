WatchPeopleDieInside,fpbrqj7,t3_gch9a0,1588477070.0,"I gotta ask, with the insane amount of these I'm seeing is it some snapshot or Instagram filter or are people actually doing this that much.

If you can't tell, I don't use many other social medias."
berkeley,fpb2wm6,t3_g8an1k,1588460979.0,Its bad at my university. The ratio of guys to girls is 3 to 1 and I (as a guy) am always worried about how I act around the girls there because being openly kind comes off as creepy if I don't know them so I kinda just stick to myself. I think a good chunk of the guys are in a similar boat so most of what girls end up seeing are one of these three types and it hurts being associated with them but I do understand the mindset.
Advice,fpar3xb,t1_fpaqxmx,1588453959.0,Good luck!
Advice,fpaqfg0,t3_gcbkaw,1588453560.0,"Number 1 worst thing to do is to beg for attention. DMing people and constantly posting to social media like Instagram, Twitter, or REDDIT, just makes you look scummy as fuck and that you don't deserve to win outside bribing people. If what you are doing is worth being on top then you shouldn't have to beg people to make it so."
Advice,fpap5rx,t3_gcav22,1588452806.0,"Tell them straight up, No. You don't need excuses of any kind or any reason to not give it to them its your property. You aren't a bad person for saying no to this."
Advice,fpao6qh,t1_fpa8h0s,1588452225.0,I especially like the idea of drawing the attention of the feminist extremists towards it and seeing the chaos that ensues.
Advice,fpanoxs,t1_fpamb0v,1588451932.0,"You are definitely right about him being a jerk here. These schools are similar in price which would be the only acceptable breakpoint in asking for help. But if you aren't likely to change his mind I would put in some hard research on how much debt you would gain from going to your dream school and talk to your mom and maybe even grandparents to see if you can get any extra support. If you can't, then it will come down to how easily you will be able to pay off the debt with the degree you earn.

Edit: I should also emphasize that this amount of money is no joke for many people and its not always worth it just to get one school over the other."
Advice,fpamd63,t3_gcbhxd,1588451139.0,"I guess it depends on what the rejection was like but if he didn't give you the reasons then, whatever reason he could have is not a valid one. I would forget him and try to find someone who doesn't reject you."
Advice,fpalr2u,t3_gc9bv0,1588450778.0,"I had a friend who would do similar things and guilt trip you if you say you don't want to. At that point they are much worse of a friend than you are when you just ignore them and pretend to be busy, which is what I've decided upon doing to that person now."
Advice,fpale8a,t3_gcbjtd,1588450567.0,Do you mind me asking a little bit about what the schools are? Are they for the same degrees or completely different? I didn't even work up the courage to ask for the degree I wanted instead of the degree my parents recommended and I'm definitely regretting it.
Advice,fpaklr4,t3_gccdoe,1588450103.0,"Cheating is absolutely NOT ok in my book, my dad has similar tendencies and I've dealt with it for all of my life. I don't know your whole situation because mine started pretty much when I was an infant, but I've seen it happen so many times now that hopefully I can give some advice.

First off it sounds like your parents have been together for so long that it will be very hard on everybody. The longest ones tend to go very messy and I've seen how court changes people. It will become a vicious battle and even those who seem like the most kind people will use underhanded tactics to fight down to the last dime of property. It will be absolute HELL for everyone, but its almost inevitable that the information gets out there. If you don't have any really young siblings who will be absolutely traumatized by this, then I would advise getting it out of the way.

My best advice: Wait till after quarantine, tell your mom whats going down, then step out and let the parents deal with this. If your old enough then make sure you are only involved in the court system as much as you want to be and don't let either side try to take advantage of you, and its not the best thing to hear but be careful trusting either side in this. These kinds of things bring out the worst in people."
Advice,fpaj0pq,t1_fpacp3c,1588449175.0,"What she did was beyond dark humor. That can either be symptomatic of her actually dealing with issues and not realizing how bad her situation actually is, or she's a horrible person. I wouldn't want to scare her parents to death and a lot of people in those situations think that help is worse than suffering, but if you think its  a sign of some real problems you might want to get some advice from mental health professionals and maybe try having a serious discussion with her to set her straight. Either thats not an appropriate joke, or does she need help."

When I unlocked Mulan, the image was the space themed amaterasu skin which is a fair stand in. That helps face is probably the closest to babas actual profile and I think its a fair enough fit."
learnart,foyjvx2,t1_foyjovu,1588173847.0,"Then just draw what you care about. If you know the fundamentals but can't necessarily apply them to the stuff you don't like, then just draw what you want and try to find where the fundamentals apply. Just keep drawing."
learnart,foyjb8j,t1_foyikfu,1588173553.0,"Its never impossible to improve at art, and its not about what you draw to learn. Improvement takes a long time and you shouldn't expect to be better immediately or because you watched some videos, you just need to keep drawing even if it doesn't turn out how you want. Don't put off art until you get better and don't skip drawing because it isn't going to look good."

learnart,fo3gmos,t3_g5f8t3,1587486570.0,Don't be afraid of doing it piece by piece and making it look rough at first. Pencil can be erased and nobody learns to draw the fluid shape right away.
hearthstone,fnllpta,t1_fnlkuzf,1587055684.0,"Just making a joke. You seemed a little bit too salty about the game and I was hoping too brighten the mood. I personally crafted Liadrin and it's a little disappointing that the deck isnt ""viable"" but I dont go on super large rants because of it. I just play the game and have fun."

The mods hate witch hunt posts and not censoring the language is probably a nono too. I know you dont really intend a witch hunt post and even if you did personally I wouldnt even care."
learnart,fmp9v3l,t3_fwgyma,1586277078.0,"Good start, but it does seem very flat other than the foreground arm, especially the feet and legs. The pelvis region is front facing but the legs are pushed to the side as if the person was right facing. Try to keep the angles of the body consistent."
Smite,fmo06zi,t3_fw8h0g,1586240721.0,"I main Arthur and energy gain is hard to keep consistent. Best way to do it is max cooldown, good defense/lifesteal, and constantly be hitting 2+ enemy gods with every ability once it comes off cooldown. Auto cancelling also seems to help."
Smite,fmnzxxy,t3_fw5o3i,1586240483.0,That will happen in any game. That's what happens when over half the population suddenly has an excuse to stay home and play games all day.

learnart,fmbmmq4,t3_fu9nss,1585929322.0,"If the head is at an angle the size and shape of the eyes should change and will likely be different. For example in this drawing it would look more natural if the eye on the left (the characters right eye) should be proportionally thinner in length than the right as it will be more towards the background.

Edit: these changes should be very subtle, too pronounced and it will look much worse."
