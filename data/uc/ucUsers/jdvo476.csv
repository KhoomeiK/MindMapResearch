UCSD,fpdo5fv,t3_gcm6t5,1588530856.0,"To compensate for being at home, I try to do the majority of my work once I wake up or at least an hour after I wake up. I find that works for me since I feel like my willpower to resist the urge to procrastinate ebbs away as the day draws on.

Also, I've tried to set time limits in regards to when I should finish all my work. For example, I don't do any work past 10pm and consider that exclusively my downtime. I found this helpful when motivating myself to get work done. I think being without the ""need"" for sleep because you need to attend a in-person lecture the next day, can make you really push off your work for later; so it's important to set time restrictions for yourself to feel responsible for what you set out to do that day. The only exception I have for this rule is for exams, in which case I study past 10 since these are rare ocassions anyway.

Most importantly, *take breaks* . Personally, I like to take breaks halfway between lectures and between lectures. It really works to get the material hammered in, plus I don't feel overwhelmed.

I know different methods work for different people but I hope this somehow helps you or anyone else struggling during this difficult times. Best of luck to you!"
Cringetopia,fp9uu2b,t1_fp9np3h,1588435021.0,"Yeah, totally agree. It's kind of grating everytime I see a BTS ""stan"" post on this sub because it's seriously a gross generalization of a whole fanbase. A lot of ARMY on Twitter are grown-ups who obviously don't tweet this kind of stuff bc they *are grown-ups*. People just find it hard to understand that every fandom has their cringy 10 years olds, and because of that, kpop in general gets a bad rep. 

Also, I'm actually pretty open about speaking of musical tastes, especially kpop since it's something I'm passionate about. If someone perceives me as possibly being one of these BTS ""stans"", I just think of it as a way to inform someone how the BTS ARMY community *really* is versus what the vast majority thinks it is."
Cringetopia,fp7a95a,t3_gblg5h,1588366866.0,"I'm a fan of BTS and we do not claim these people. The majority of fans are well-educated and are either in uni or have jobs. This post probably represents a small portion of the community. (i.e. the ten year olds). It really sucks to have you fandom dragged in the dirt for the 5% of the community that are still developing their brains, but that's how it goes I suppose. Just wanted to get my two cents out there that a lot of us BTS ARMY are not like this."
Cringetopia,fp79sii,t1_fp75tw8,1588366627.0,Not the only one. I believe that some kpop fans are cringy but the cringy fans are really a small portion of the community. People need to really chill with the death threats to kpop stan 10 year olds that don't know what they're talking about.
cybersecurity,fous4vp,t1_fotfb7t,1588089491.0,I have done so and am now waiting with fingers crossed. Thank you.
cybersecurity,fourzh4,t1_fou74oo,1588089419.0,"Oddly, the alert functionality was disabled. I think I had actually turned it off long ago when I first created the FB account because I was annoyed every time I got a new login email and I forgot about it until now, so I really shot myself in the foot there. But I did realize and turned it back on yesterday when I noticed all this suspicious activity. 

I have already checked my computer for malware and didn't find anything. I've also since cleared all my history and cookies. What I've been suspecting as the origin of the hack is actually my iPad, not my computer. This is because recently I've been watching on a streaming site that has popups which I suspect may be the cause of the leak. I've since then factory reset my iPad. I'm also planning to factory reset my other devices today. I know I'm most likely being too paranoid and over the top, but I want to really make sure I get the source of the problem now."
cybersecurity,fouqq20,t1_fotr45n,1588088823.0,Many thanks!
cybersecurity,fotbqwj,t1_fotazd8,1588049464.0,"Hi. So, I've already checked and it shows my email as compromised. However, I also checked a friend's email and her's has been compromised as well (but she hasn't been hacked on any accounts). Does this mean that emails may be compromised, but its all down to whether the information ends up being used? Also, does this mean my email is now unusable or is it recoverable? Thank you."
UCSD,fmkktda,t1_fmkitoq,1586158433.0,Okay thanks!!
