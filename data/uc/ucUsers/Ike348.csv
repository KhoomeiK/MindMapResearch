baseball,foc7ld7,t3_g6paum,1587668041.0,"I can't believe anyone honestly thinks Chase Utley is deserving of a plaque in the Hall of Fame. The third paragraph of this article is really all you need to read. Utley had a nice peak from about 2005 to 2010, but Hall of Famers are at their prime for much longer. As the article says, his career stats would be a joke to anyone else in the Hall of Fame. Anyone who wants Utley in the HOF should go support the NBA or the NFL when anybody who plays for 10 years and has 3 good years can make the Hall. Thankfully baseball's Hall is a lot more prestigious.

That being said, this article still has value in pointing out that those Phillies teams didn't really have any ""great"" players. We had Howard, Utley, Rollins whom were all terrific at their peaks, but they all fell off hard (which is one of the reasons why we sucked 2012 and forward). We had our four aces, and one of them did make it into the Hall, but for the rest, you're going to have to be a lot better for a lot longer to become a Hall of Famer. Then of course we just had Pedro for like 2 months at the end of his career."
berkeley,fo7wen6,t3_g67cmm,1587585693.0,"This is my second year renting from them and I've had no problems. Yes, the owner is shady, but frankly I don't care whom I give my money to as long as I get good value for it. Our place is plenty big and its a reasonable price. Management is quick to respond to problems like broken laundry machines and the like. Although I will say that if it's not an ""urgent"" problem, it probably won't get fixed for a while. Overall no complaints here."

DataHoarder,fnic2fw,t1_fni9fh0,1586977464.0,"That's really interesting. Sometimes you'll see that when the server requires that youtube-dl include cookies or headers to ""pretend"" that it's really you accessing the m3u8 playlist, but I haven't seen that for GamePass streams. Are you running the command on some kind of virtual machine or SSH server or something? If you're trying to access that URL from a different IP address than it was originally viewed in then that could trigger a 403.

Perhaps if you posted your exact command and exact output (obfuscating any identifying information of course), then I could offer more help. But that command should work as is. Feel free to PM me!

One last thing I'll suggest is to use streamlink. You can install it the same way you installed youtube-dl. Then try streamlink 'hlsvariant://super long link ....' best -o output.ts

There are some streams that won't work with youtube-dl that do work with streamlink for me, (or vice versa) and I can't figure out a reason why. But it's probably easier for you to try and get youtube-dl working first."
DataHoarder,fni5fpw,t1_fngxfr9,1586974291.0,"That looks like the right URL! Make sure you put it in quotes when feeding it to youtube-dl. I always go single quotes ('') but double quotes ("""") will probably work too. You need to include the full URL, otherwise you're not going to be able to access it (403 errors).

For a more technical explanation‚Äîif you don't include the quotes, the terminal/command-line interface will interpret the & character as starting a new process, hence it looks for ""hdnea"" as some kind of program that you're trying to use. Of course that's actually not the case, which is why you need to put the whole URL in quotes to tell the interpreter to interpret it as one long string."
DataHoarder,fnfw3hb,t1_fmvv2un,1586916711.0,"My bad for not responding earlier. Looks like that extension has been taken off the Chrome store (which is too bad), but if you search ""URL sniffer"" you could find something similar.

If you're getting to the Inspect -> Network tab, you should be able to see the m3u8 URLs pop up. You won't see it in the page source. Make sure you refresh the page after you open the Network tab (or have it open before you start playing the game), as the Network tab will only keep track of the URLs once you open it, and if the video is already playing, it will have been missed.

""View"" is in my menu bar, at least on a Mac. Alternatively, you can open the devtools window by pressing command-option-I, again, at least on a Mac. But as I said, it looks like you've found the right window."

OOTP,fncnm5k,t3_g0wry7,1586841509.0,"What‚Äôs crazy is that this is an absurd season but he doesn‚Äôt break any records for individual stats. Ichiro had more hits, Bonds had more HR, Ruth scored more runs, Ted Williams hit for a higher average, Gehrig had more RBI, etc. Just all-around greatness"
berkeley,fnbsnhs,t1_fnbqww1,1586821531.0,"Not OP but I took it as a freshman a couple years back. Basically a rundown of California history which was really worthwhile for someone coming out of state like me. You learn a lot about the foundations of San Francisco, LA, etc. while also going through the ‚Äúdarker‚Äù side of history‚ÄîJapanese internment camps, genocide of Native Americans, redlining, environmental injustice, etc.

I took it with Lunine and he‚Äôs a really good professor, can be kind of awkward at times in a funny way but he lectures well and is usually open to talk to.

It was my first semester at Berkeley and coming from a math/stats background the amount of reading took a while to get used to, but compared to other classes it‚Äôs really not that much. Might not be as interesting if you‚Äôve lived in CA your whole life and been beaten to death with CA history, but if not then its definitely a good AC to take, especially if Lunine is still teaching it."
