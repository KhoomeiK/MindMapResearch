We were on a field trip and the teacher was furious and I had no idea why. I ended up getting detention or something like that and my mom was pretty pissed off at the school because it was a very small thing."
ironscape,fphzayl,t1_fphz2t9,1588630612.0,Lol tell me about it dude I have a ways to go before I get there.
ironscape,fphyu9s,t1_fphynzf,1588630356.0,Yeah I know Im saying with that additional accuracy boost and the damage boosting items it might come out to an additional like 5% dps which is pretty huge over an infinite amount of time.
ironscape,fphxwlf,t1_fphxqgb,1588629845.0,">to probably end up doing thousands of zulrah and at least

Ah I see yeah my goals are the same eventually, Im kind of a completionist so would probably end up doing it either way

Edit:

probably with all of the damage boosting items etc it might make it so that you get a little extra max hit right? Therefore it would end up being a 5% dps boost over time or something like that."
ironscape,fphfpoj,t1_fpgiyhf,1588620472.0,You could just do wildy slayer to get it though I'm pretty sure I got 5 on my reg account going from like 30-60 slayer although it might have just been really lucky...
ironscape,fphffly,t1_fph5b5n,1588620329.0,Oof well you could set your house to pollinveach and just bank a bunch from draynor village assuming that it's not oversold there too. Also assuming your not a UIM.

stopdrinking,fpdpwx7,t3_gcpkpg,1588531854.0,Yo what's up I've been sober just a little over 5 years now and just turned 25 the other day! Being young and an alcoholic is hard but there are a tons of young people to talk to! If anyone here wants to PM me I am in contact with tons of other young people as there are quite a lot of conferences for young peoples. The biggest confrence being ICYPAA which is International Confrence for young peoples in AA. If any young people want to PM me I would love to help you all to get engrossed in young peoples because it saved my life and I know it can others as well.
UCSD,fpauys1,t3_gcaa40,1588456247.0,"In my opinion I felt pretty burnt out doing summer session multiple years in a row by the time I got to my 3rd year with barely taking anytime off I was pretty wiped out. That being said I was in school full time had two part time jobs to pay the bills and an internship. So everyday I was driving all over San Diego, I was able to manage it for awhile but like I said I was pretty burnt out afterwards. For most people this wont be the case so you should be fine, if I had to do it again though I wouldn't have taken summer classes. There's no need to rush through school and I would be better off just taking my time. Mental well being is more important than all that shit."

ironscape,fp7le99,t1_fp7kzag,1588372829.0,"So that I have food and to go for the pet. Fishing karambwans will be super afk as well as anglerfish, since I am still in school best thing for me right now would be afk stuff. I made actually a full list of stuff to do as afk/non afk, so I might go back and knock out the rest of mining at mlm afterwords because I'll probably end up with a good chunk of food anyways from wintertodt. We will see I guess, it will either be continue fishing afterwards for the extra food and chance for the pet or it will be woodcutting/mining afk."

A glory and some goals, also like to donate a few tele tabs for easier ways to get around. Tell them to add me if they have any questions etc. Show them how to get 43 prayer safespotting the dragons in Taverly. I think this is the most helpful thing that I can do without spoiling the game too much for them. Glorys are super cheap and will be basically bis for a noob for quite a while."
2007scape,fox7jp8,t3_ga0nib,1588136037.0,Honestly tho 98-99 may have the most xp but it feels like the shortest level of them all. Just because you can feel how close you are to finally being done. Like you've already gotten 12m xp in the skill at that point so another 1.2m feels like a breeze. It's very satisfying to finally hit that goal for sure.
2007scape,fox6y36,t1_fox1ns6,1588135602.0,"It would take approximately 16-25 hours to do the aerial fishing method depending on your luck with with golden tench drops. Also Mulch Pearl's are recieved based on your fishing and hunter level so 16 hours is with 99 fishing and hunter. Unless you just catch 4 golden tench in a very short amount of time, itll take awhile."

ironscape,foq99z4,t1_fopaohu,1587987386.0,"Theres quite a few vids of it on youtube, people will even do it with the foot pedal (feel like I spelt that wrong). 

What you do is have inventory viewer enabled on Runelite, be in resizeable mode have the ability to have hotkey open/close menus. Have your mouse set up so that you can click the knight then open invent to empty coin pouches. Can set it up so that left click would be 1 on keyboard and open invent is 2 on keyboard and you just spam one hit 2 to open invent 1 to empty coin pouches and 2 to close invent.

This is in line with game rules its actually something you can do from the actual Runescape client as well but Runelite has built in feature to remap Fkeys to 1-9."
ironscape,foq86un,t1_foq5xln,1587986379.0,"More importantly karambwans are combo food, you can sip potion eat shark or whatever and karambwan on same game tick if need be. Also GZ on the pet dude"

ironscape,fol4cx3,t1_fol465a,1587854641.0,Yeah totally also depends on your firemaking lvl so damage is pretty much minimized at 80 FM. Which is super quick at the todt I'm actually planning in duoing it with myself on the reg iron and UIM
ironscape,foku1cz,t1_fok9trx,1587848940.0,"Concur with this my S9 has been more powerful than my laptop, seems to run osrs so much more smoothly idk why. Currently though I have the Lenovo Yoga 730 which does run Runelite pretty well only issue is playing on two accounts at once I have to knock gpu down to 20 tiles and I run it with low detail."
ironscape,foksz00,t3_g7ymdi,1587848360.0,"IMO Best way to do wintertodt is solo's because you get far more supplies and you get an easy 70 cons just from getting to 99fm. I'm currently doing solo's on my main iron with 47hp, I use 5 karambwans the entire time going to 13500 points. Two for setup and the other 3 are because its so afk that ill be looking at my other account and get hit by exploding brazier etc. Your always going to profit in terms of food doing solo's and it is significantly more worth it. To put it into perspective doing solo's at about 90 fm you might be getting 250k fm/hr with maybe 2k cons, 5k fletching and 1k woodcutting /hr.  Doing solo's its 220k fm/hr with 20k cons, 30k fletching and 8k woodcutting/hr. So overall you do get more macro efficient xp. Also Solo's are significantly more chill, personally I feel stressed to run back in ASAP and get back to it but with solos 98% is afk and its really chill. To put into reference as well you would probably be fine with using like 2-3 trout on a solo trip with 13 hp but you barely ever take damage/get interrupted by todt doing solos.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Also should add that I absolutely hate training cons the normal way and if you hate it as well this is the way to go. Best thing to do is get a few early cons levels beforehand and the xp will come flying in.

Also not sure if I mentioned that you get more rewards/hr doing solo's vs doing W307

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

Apparently I didn't read your post very well because I spent this whole time talking about how great Solo's are and you said you were already planning to do them so sorry about that."

BankTabs,fnqxyz5,t1_fnqjuw7,1587174686.0,Cool man thanks for the Advice was trying to get a pure started earlier today but transactions getting denied to jagex for some reason might just have to bond it up instead. been looking into it quite a bit though. maybe I will start off as a pure and move into becoming a void dude. Will check it out though.
BankTabs,fnq84x8,t1_fnq63qz,1587159516.0,"What do you think the cost of making a voider would be I do like the idea of having more def for sure and it seems like just swapping out helms might be easier. I could just try to learn on a pure I guess. Currently my main account has 75,83,70 melee stats 77 prayer, 80 ranged, and 70 magic. Would this qualify as some sort of Zerker? I could just learn a lil bit at LMS. But I like the idea of maybe anti Pking during wildy slayer. 

Sorry I have lots of questions just wondering what might be a good option for learning. Like if a pure would be better for learning than a voider etc.

Edit: also forgot to ask why is it easier to smite with a voider? Is it from the damage boost?"
BankTabs,fnpveal,t3_g30v6l,1587152701.0,"Have you thought about getting 60 attack I think you would only get like 3 or 4 combat levels at max 

Edit: seems like with 52 prayer 99 mage range and str,you would be 90.13 and would go to 93.43

Just seems like using the granite hammer is a weird one handed weapon


Also wanted to ask if you were to build a Pkingng account would you recommend a voider? Was thinking about making a baby pure to try out pking, so was going to do 60 attack 70/80 str, 85 magic 1 def 1 ranged 52 prayer. Just wondering what you might think. Wanted to start out with just one swap instead of triberding."
2007scape,fnmbinr,t3_g2cbdj,1587068457.0,I actually only use the vigorras chainmace/craws bow for wildy slayer in the long run if you die a bunch you might lose some money without bossing. But the items are super strong in the wildy. I usually meet up with them back in edgeville and either way if I die or if I manage to run away I tell them good fight or a solid try man. Usually not risking more than 500k. Also I use the ardy cloak and the kourend diaries thingy so free prayer bonus absolutely no loss there.
