ApexConsole,fpl0j72,t3_gdhy4q,1588704238.0,"Honestly, any monitor with an hdmi port is all you need. I bought a cheap monitor from amazon for about 65 bucks a while ago and it’s been amazing. Everything just feels sharper and my gameplay is arguably a lot better.  Since buying it I average 2-4 wins a day with my friends.

The specs don’t have to be all that since it’s a console. Do remember that you are most likely gonna be using audio through your remote since cheap monitors don’t have audio but that’s fine. There really isn’t any need to drop 200 plus on a monitor since the 125 and under range and pretty similar."

UCI,fmvkpmx,t3_fxmlxk,1586420506.0,A solid watch all the way through. Really puts into perspective how really “diverse” the OC area and UCI really are. Holy shit and the part with the guy talking about how the lady ran way screaming from help just hurt my fucking soul.
