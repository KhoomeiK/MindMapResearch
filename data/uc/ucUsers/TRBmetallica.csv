whiskey,fpkl3wu,t1_fphyv90,1588696616.0,"Yeah Toki is definitely meant to be mixed as its a pretty mellow spirit. There are definitely some great JP whiskeys to drink neat; Hibiki Harmony, Harmony Master's Select, Nikka Coffey Malt or Grain (personal preference), and I haven't had it personally but I've heard great things about the Suntory Yamazaki 12"
whiskey,fphtsrm,t3_gdfio1,1588627673.0,"If you're looking to get into Japanese Whiskey I would recommend Suntory Toki as a starter, if you can find it then Hibiki Harmony is fantastic. Otherwise great collection!"

canadianhighlander,fo0auqg,t3_g4lx2v,1587409306.0,Maybe a stupid question...but how do they do Canlan on mtgo? Is it a supported format now or a freeform game?
