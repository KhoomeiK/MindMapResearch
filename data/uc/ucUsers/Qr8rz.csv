A lot of geophysics research is typically writing code from scratch be it Python, R, Fortran, Matlab, Julia, Perl, C, etc. There's plenty of posts in this sub about who likes what language and for what reason and how to go about learning. Point is you'll get up to speed quicker and your application will be more attractive."

UCSantaBarbara,forxx7e,t1_fopucq1,1588020445.0,"Your visa should allow you to work outside the school in the summer with the requisite permissions, perhaps to do an internship or something. OISS will be a point of contact about this, I'm sure they have lots of info to hand. Also, there have been several thousand emails recently from the school and the GSA about hardship grants, emergency funds, etc etc. so keep that in mind too."
UCSantaBarbara,fopp8s0,t3_g8ukkz,1587967815.0,"That's a shitty situation for sure. If you're on a 50% contract and spending more than 20 hours a week on TAing then you in theory have a course of action you can take to address this with the course instructor/department/union/ombudsman etc. You're under no contractual obligation to do anything outside that contract regardless of the current shit storm, and the department should draft someone else in to help. I also recommend talking to the instructor and other TAs in your department about how to mitigate common issues ahead of time so that you don't have to deal with them. Easier said than done sure but it's useful to hear about strategies other people use. If you're having trouble with classes, say something to the powers that be, and/or get other people to say something too. There's power in numbers."

5. Also take a look at [this sublease check list](https://t.e2ma.net/click/5fpovb/96s8zj/x9eyof) and at this [UCHS presentation](https://t.e2ma.net/click/5fpovb/96s8zj/d2fyof)."""
UCSantaBarbara,fm960vj,t1_fm91a8h,1585862378.0,There are options for limiting who can screen share too. There have been some emails and articles recently about how to limit zoombombing so hopefully it'll die down. I assume these are students else I don't know how they get the meeting link. Unless they just have a script to try a bunch of different URLs / meeting numbers etc. till they find some that work.
