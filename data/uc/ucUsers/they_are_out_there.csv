HarryPotterBooks,fph5bqr,t3_gd8exa,1588615230.0,"The is zero basis for Lesbians being attracted to Veela anywhere in the canon as that is never mentioned anywhere in the books, the Harry Potter Wiki, or the Pottermore Wiki. 

There is solid evidence in those sources however, that they only attract men, although it’s fair to say that Lesbians might be attracted to their beauty and dances, albeit not due to their magical attraction which seems to attract biological males.

It is stated that they attract men, although some seem to be able to resist.

https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Veela

“Veela are semi-human magical beings who appear as young, beautiful women with white-gold hair and moon-bright skin, native to Bulgaria. Their looks and especially their dance is hypnotically seductive to almost all male beings, which causes them to perform foolhardy and impulsive actions to get closer to, and to receive admiration from the Veela.[1]”

“Veela are described as looking like incredibly beautiful women, with moon-bright skin and white-gold hair that fans out behind them despite the absence of wind. They have the ability to hypnotise and mesmerise most men with their seductive dance, who will then try to impress them.[1]”

The Pottermore Wiki also backs up that men are attracted, but women are never mentioned.

https://pottermore.fandom.com/wiki/Veela

“They have a strange effect upon the men in the stadium; Harry's mind goes completely and blissfully blank as their music begins and he watches them dance, and he feels the urge to do something very impressive, such as jumping from the Top Box into the stadium.”

I don’t doubt that as a Lesbian, many would find the Veela to be extremely attractive, but seeing as how their magic is focused on biological men, I don’t think the magical aspect would work on biological women, lesbian or otherwise."

assholedesign,fp6ykz3,t1_fp6u22v,1588360858.0,"That's my take on the situation. Nobody is so important or awesome as to where they are above reproach. When a company isolates itself, limits it's clientele to starry eyed sycophantic fanboys, and says that you can only buy a limited edition car if you have a history of buying at least 5 prior models new, then you're crazy. Ford does this too with the GT models and there's a contract rider prohibiting resale of the car for a specified number of years.

There's a lot of other awesome cars out there that don't require you to stick you head up the car company's butt to get a ride. Seriously, it's like a sickness with rich guys that they have to acquire certain cars to be relavent or important.

Any guy dressed like a bum can walk into a Porsche dealership and buy a 911 GT3 off the showroom floor if he's got cash in hand and if they have it in stock. You can't do that in a Ferrari dealership, you have to fit their image and they have certain criteria their clients have to meet to buy certain models. It's insane, especially considering the Porsches are arguably better cars and just as fast...and they tend not to catch on fire by the dozens and burn in traffic. 

Sure, Lambos, Porsches, and McLarens catch on fire too, but Ferrari should really pair up with Zippo to sell their cars as a promotion item since they light up so reliably.

Ferraris are great cars and they like to keep things exclusive, but imagine what they could do if they made their cars a little more accessible. They'd sell a ton of cars and maybe people would think better of them."

John Deere doesn't sell you the tractor. You don't actually own it. What you own is a LICENSE to operate their tractor. It's an insane concept. As a result, you can't work on major systems within the tractor, you're required to have a dealership tech show up with his computer to reset the computer when anything goes wrong. When you put a part on the tractor, you have to enter the serial number and other info to get the computer to reset or it will disable the system. You can't use an aftermarket part. It's just like Apple Computer and their insane policies about using aftermarket parts, except on a level that involves tractors that cost up to $1 million bucks each.

A bunch of guys are buying pirated software from Eastern Europe now just to be able to work on their own tractors. Farmers tend to be a pretty independent lot and don't like being told what to do.

I’m a huge fan of maritime knots and ended up working for a guy who did a lot of time in the teams. I mentioned to him that he probably knew a ton of cool knots after being in the Navy, in the hopes that he might show me something I was unfamiliar with.

He said he only really knew 5 knots. They had to learn to tie them instinctively, during the day and night, on land or underwater, with left hand or right. Each task has an approved knot and you’re not allowed to improvise as those specific knots are designed to work consistently. They don’t want variation. They want consistent results when performing dangerous tasks, so they drill it into you until it becomes automatic.

He was a cool guy but refused to talk about the job much beyond that. The only reason anyone knew he was in that prior job was because his father in law bragged about him all the time before he retired.

I'm a big guy and adding another guy and a little gear puts me up right at capacity. I can't really carry a third adult or a large dog and gear with the aluminum. That's why I sold my Grumman and shopped Craigslist until I found the Discovery. 

With the Discovery 169, I can carry 3 large adults, a cooler, tents, sleeping bags and gear, and I'm still under 2/3 capacity when completely loaded. That extra insurance is nice to have when putting a lot of weight into a canoe.

Aluminum would be nice when dragging the canoe over rough terrain, paddling solo or if you're a lightweight person with another light person.

I’ve got a Discovery 169 and it’s very stable, especially when it’s really loaded up. It’s heavy at 81 lbs, but that’s not really a problem unless you need to portage. 

For lake use and canoe camping with a lot of gear, it’s the next best thing to a comfy pickup truck that you can paddle across the water. Just off load it with a friend, roll it to the water with a cart, or just slide it across the grass.

It’s not a sports car for sure, but with a little effort, it’ll get you and all of your gear where you want to go and it’s a really durable canoe. It’s made of the same 3-ply poly as the current 174 Penobscot.

The calculator is helpful to give you the end result, but knowing how the calculator got to those results is really the important part.

When you enter the workforce, it isn’t always necessary to do things the long way, what’s important is to know and understand why things work in a certain way or process. Your past experience will click and help you understand and you’ll intuitively know what to do from past experience. The longer you work and the more experience you gain, the easier the job becomes. Those associations may not be coming quickly now, but they’ll develop as you understand and recognize how things fit, allowing you to put those associations together.

What you perceive now as overwhelming will seem much easier as your experience grows and you continue to build upon those foundations."

MaliciousCompliance,foygwr4,t1_foy1gr0,1588172312.0,"Having the Mustang name attached to anything other than a 2-door coupe with sport styling in a tragedy. Even with that said, sometimes that doesn’t even work, for instance the Mustang II.

Chevy did the same with Malibu and Impala and attached the names to bloated 4 door sedans. The SS Impala was a boat but at least it was a fast boat.  The new Dodge Dart was a mess.  

Sometimes it works though. Pontiac had a cool GTO that was fast before closing down the entire Pontiac brand. The Challenger and Charger are available with Hellcat engines which is also super cool.

Hopefully Ford does the right thing and doesn’t mess with the Mustang tradition too much."

Whatisthis,fox4auv,t1_foun4fs,1588133736.0,"Fair enough. It may be called pipe in Sweden, but in much of the rest of the world, it’s called conduit for a reason.

The reason there’s a specific difference between the two is because conduit is not pressure rated, whereas pipe is. 

Water and sewage goes in pipe. Steam and condensed chill water return goes in pipe. Hazmat waste goes in pipe. Irrigation goes in pipe. It’s typically rated for the specific pressure needed by the application.

Electrical goes in conduit. It can be made of steel (EMT) or PVC among other things, but electrical never goes in pipe. Conduit is designed to protect the electrical wires and cables from abrasion and penetration of the insulation surrounding the wire. Pressure ratings are not an issue.

The difference in terms are important. If you walk into a supplier and ask for pipe, they’ll think you’re asking for plumbing supplies. Ask for conduit and you’ll get sent to the electrical department. Blueprints and engineering specs also use this terminology.

Are you an electrician or an apprentice, or involved in data and IT work? I’m just wondering what trade you’re working in. Cheers."

IAmA,fosd95a,t1_forwpvl,1588028447.0,"Sure, there's still a lot of holdover results even today. Large lands and titles were seized and distributed among the Norman nobility. Many of the people in the peerage today are directly related to those who received titles and lands in 1066.

The Saxon citizenry refused to learn French in large part, frustrating the nobility. After about 300 years, the ruling class decided to allow the court system to operate in English, which was the catalyst to eventually allow the country to return back to an all English speaking land. They essentially won the country back by returning to their cultural and linguistic roots. England went back to being English, and it was the Normans who were eventually assimilated."
IAmA,foru38w,t1_foqjeqc,1588018530.0,"I wouldn't say that French failed to penetrate. English is a West Germanic language, but with so many words adopted from the French (largely due to 1066), many people mistakenly believe English is a Latin based language. Add the Spanish influence in, especially in the United States, and it becomes even more Latin influenced.

English grammar is heavily Germanic, but the vocabulary is full of Latin based French."

It usually happens when a Freshman approaches the traffic circle and instead of merging smoothly, they just slam on the brakes in the middle of the lane and stop before moving into the circle. 

Practice entering traffic circles in light traffic and build up your confidence if you must. Things can get crazy around the Bike Barn and the Chem building. People are juggling drinks from The Silo and everyone is in a hurry.

MilitaryPorn,fop9tfb,t1_fop8fe8,1587956299.0,"No doubt. I’m loving the idea of a Zeiss Harpia 95mm which has a specialized design that has features way beyond everything else out there, but at $5,000 - 6,000 fully outfitted, it makes the 85mm Vortex pretty amazing at $1,600. Seriously, the Vortex is 90% as good or better as the Zeiss, and fantastic at that. 

The lower end Zeiss products are also made in China. I know their mid-line Conquest series items are made there and assembled with some German parts in Germany. Their high end stuff is all German. 

Zeiss keeps a 50 years part inventory, but it’s going to cost you down the road if you need work as they only have a 5 year no fault warranty and limited lifetime against manufacturer’s defects. Awesome stuff, but you have to send your gear back to Germany for weeks for repair. 

Vortex usually just swaps it out with a new one and drops it into the mail. I’ve never had to warranty anything but I’ve heard and read some pretty crazy stories about how well they back their product."

I used to be so careful with my 27-60x-85mm Razor HD as it cost just under $1,800 but once I realized how tough it is and how Vortex backs their products, I spend my time enjoying it without being overly paranoid about how it's used. I'm still careful, but I don't worry about it at all. That frees me up to pay attention to other things instead of focusing on my gear. Riflescopes take a ton of abuse and I can see why it would be nice to not have to worry about your gear."
