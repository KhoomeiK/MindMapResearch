If you had actually bothered to read it, you would have noted it explicitly states that UV radiation treatment is highly controversial and that it has fallen out of use due to the development of antibiotics. Moreover there have been *zero* mass clinical trials to prove its effectiveness (you know, the one think anything medical is required to undergo), and that evidence has largely been from small scale tests or anecdotal evidence. Which is why the overwhelming majority of people actually qualified to talk about the subject - including medical groups that actually support the treatment in general - are outright stating that you should absolutely not be trying to irradiate yourself. Current small tests have show that at levels necessary to kill COVID, it would also kill an excessive amount of healthy cells as well. 

But of course don't listen to anything I have to say, keep listening to the loony in the sky. Because if you actually think he's right then you should 100% put your money where your mouth is, IE you should go irradiate yourself with UV right now, to prove your hypothesis. Heck inject disinfectant into your veins while you're at it, two treatments can't hurt right? Do it, show to the world that it's perfectly safe, and we'll all applaud you. Or keep talking out of your ass beacuse you're not willing to put your beliefs on the line to prove you're actually right."

However one, the most expensive one, kept getting delayed and I never got a pick-up email. 3 weeks into the quarter I just called them, only for them to tell me ""good luck, its not coming so we'll just cancel the order for you now"".

UCSantaBarbara,fows0d6,t1_fowpl00,1588125901.0,"The issue with pass/no pass is that it doesn't tell Grad schools anything, only that you didn't suck enough to fail. So most grad schools have in the past treated a P/NP regardless of what you got as an F beacuse they can't be bothered to try and guess what your actual proficiency in the class is. However this is not necessarily an extreme issue - if its a p/np for a class outside your major often they'll just ignore it. 

However due to COVID the decision making process is potentially changing, with Grad schools looking more holistically and being more accepting of p/np grades. But nothing has actually been set in stone - they've commented they're looking into it but nothing further. If you think grad schools will change then go p/np if thats what you want.

history,fo3ikcx,t3_g521dr,1587487493.0,"This is actually a very complex issue in which there in no specific answer due reasons below. However, a lot of the other commentators who are making this out to be more black and white than it actually was - so I'll try and clarify. 

It is important to understand that, as a constitutional monarchy, power and responsibility ultimately rested with Emperor Hirohito. However, like most heads of state, he had a retinue of advisers and state officials that all affected his view and actions. This played into the popular belief that he had no real power, and these other powers were simply using him as a figurehead (more on this later).

During the war, Hirohito was often equated to Hitler or Mussolini in Allied propaganda. It would suggest that the Allies held him responsible for the war. However during the end times of the conflict, this dramatically shifted in Allied propaganda - it was now Tojo who was directly responsible. Similarly during the Tokyo Trials, those charged affirmed this relationship - that they were responsible and not the Emperor. This belief of course is what held out for the next 40 odd years, even to historians

However, later and more modern historians have addressed this more critically. Importantly, as you noted in your question, the Emperor was shielded from liability beacuse he was an important figurehead for Allied control. Yet this went further - Japanese officials tried during the Tokyo Trials were conspired with prosecutors to protect the emperor. One notable mistake during the trials came from the Tojo himself - although he had stated that ultimate authority was with him, he made a mistake and said that authority was actually with the Emperor. It caused a major disturbance and prosecutors had to deliberate with Tojo to allow him to recant. It would seem that Tojo, at least, still knew what role the Emperor was playing.

So the real problem we've run into is that Allied propaganda, document burning, and time have drastically changed what we know about this relationship. It's clear that the Emperor was probably not as unaware as was popularized, and there's fairly convincing evidence that he knew of (as most Japanese would have) the war crimes being committed and authorized them. It's also probable that he was aware of the military actions being undertaken, and authorized them as well. But this comes under the influence of his advisers, who also probably fed him false information, as well as manipulating his power to their own needs. So while authority rested with him, and he knew of what was going on, he was certainly being manipulated. But the issue therein lies that we'll never know the full extend beacuse the evidence just simply no longer exists.

It should also be noted that the people to, believed that ultimate authority rested with the Emperor. There was no debate about whether or not he had power, they just knew - and they blamed him for the war and the troubles it caused. Post-war Japanese hate to the Emperor was very noticeable, and only threats of U.S. troops attacking the protesters really stopped it devolving into full on riots.

So to your original question, Hirohito definitely had power of a kind, and knew of the war crimes being committed as well as authorizing them. But he was also probably being manipulated by his advisers who were managing the empire. Thus we'll never quite know about the true nature of the relationship beacuse the evidence no longer exists. 

Hope this helps!"
history,fo1bhtg,t1_fo19opi,1587429701.0,"Although Japan was initially planned to be divided among involved powers (much like how Germany was), it was eventually decided that the U.S. would take a primary role in control over the main home islands of Japan. Although other states were involved (especially British/Commonwealth forces), they largely served under U.S. leadership. The reality was, the appetite for dealing with issues did not materialize as post-war reconstruction efforts were seen as more necessary, and so U.S. doctrine was the only followed. Other post-imperial issues also ate into their time. Any inclusion such as at the Tokyo Trials was far more of a formality than anything else. 

That is not to say they didn't have ideas on what should become of Japan post war. Unfortunately that information has either been lost or is stuck in some national archive. It would be interesting but difficult to find such records."
history,fo17ubi,t3_g501jj,1587427527.0,"Some people have stated this more succinctly, but for more context:

The Tokyo Trials were never actually completed. A further two rounds of trials had been prepared with such individuals being accused, however following the first set it became clear that China was firmly Communist - as such, the U.S. direction had shifted in opinion in what to do with Japan. 

Immediately post-war, the U.S. doctrine had been to shift Japan to a state in which it could never again become a significant power, even going so far as to halt food supplies (beacuse many Americans were wary to ""feed the enemy"") resulting in mass protests aimed at the emperor. However beacuse of changing regional power dynamics, the doctrine shifted: Japan needed to re-industrialize quickly so it could be a check on Asian communism, and even so Japan would not become communist as a result of the U.S.-imposed economic strangulation. This would prove incredibly important during the Korean War when Japanese manufacturing significantly supplied the actions ongoing there, thus justifying this shift. 

However, in order to accomplish this, many of those indited under the Tokyo Trials (including all those from the second and third rounds) were released to help fuel Japan's rapid recovery.  Some like Prime Minister Kishi rose to significant power after their release (he was an important figure for the U.S. who affirmed the relationship between the U.S. and Japan, leading to the Anpo protests). However, this fueled the change from victimizer consciousness (in that Japan had actually committed war crimes) to victim consciousness (In that Japan had been dealt ""victors justice"" by the U.S., as evidenced by the cancellation of the remaining Tokyo Trials).  Another way this was accomplished (but irrelevant to your question, sorry) was through war reparations which was done through economic projects in SE Asia which helped jump start Japans economy.

It should be noted however that Japan had far from ""settled down"" by the 1950's. A number of protests/issues plagued the period that reflected poorly on the U.S.-Japanese relationship. One of the most issues was the idea of subordinate-independence, in that Japan appeared to be separate but was still under the control by the U.S. Moreover, many of the released war criminals posed complications as well, the aforementioned Prime Minister Kishi appeared to be shifting post-war Japan back to Imperial Japan which led to the Anpo protests beacuse Japanese people were all too aware of the horrors of war and wanted none of that to return. The relationship between Japan and war memory never really went away either.

tldr; As a result of Communism, the U.S. needed an ally in Japan and not a subject, resulting in the cancellation of the Tokyo Trials and the release of a lot of people.

Hope this rambling mess helps!"
