Please explain all of this like you're explaining it to a golden retriever. Specifically: Why is this important? Why do studios do this? What is the impact of doing it this way? Is there bad intent here? Is someone getting screwed because of this? 

Thank you!!!"
FamilyLaw,fplydqt,t3_ge4jpo,1588721869.0,"Your question is hella confusing but I think what you're really asking is, ""What right do I have to keep the kids from their father when there is no court order yet?"" The fact you weren't married means diddly squat. Because there is no order, you both have the same right to keep the kids away from the other. Until there is a court order, neither of you have a piece of paper to hand to the police in the case that one of you holds the children away from the other parent. So, if he had the kids and you didn't, he could keep the kids from you.

Get the court orders ASAP so there is clarity for you, for him, and the po-po."
FamilyLaw,fphy1ri,t3_gdkbet,1588629923.0,"It's still being figured out. My personal opinion is that the stimulus checks should be apportioned per the current parenting schedule, so in your case 50/50. If it was 70/30, and you got $1000, then $700/$300 seems fair."
FamilyLaw,fp8hdm2,t3_gbzv72,1588392341.0,"There's no general rule, but I've been advising my clients that you should do everything you can to make the visits go forward. Most supervisors are doing what they can to observe social distancing requirements. Any parent that uses Covid-19 to deny visitation is going to have a reckoning before the judge."

He definitely does not start to leave without her, but I think it's definitely a question that's up in the air. Maybe him looking up and beyond her is an indication that he's done with her. But maybe the instructions from Solomon lead him to the last control unit. Who knows?"
westworld,fosk13u,t3_g96ry3,1588032229.0,"It does seem to be somewhat of a plot hole. She has no greater reason to trust Serac than she does Dolores, maybe even less so, since at least Dolores is her kind, and she never destroyed the Sublime, even when she had the chance after killing Bernard.

My guess is the writers are setting something up where Maeve pretends to have killed Dolores so that he will open back up the Sublime, and when he refuses and tries to kill Maeve, Dolores is there to save the day and say I told you so."
westworld,fosjmv6,t1_fosb46f,1588032003.0,"Perhaps. I was assuming, maybe incorrectly, that Caleb just repairs the other Dolores. Not sure an EMP is a fatal event for the hosts."
westworld,fosjjwq,t1_foriz76,1588031958.0,"I appreciate the thoughtful response, even if it was repeated from your prior post. I am not sure I agree with you that just because Bernard previously had a red control unit, the one currently in his head has to be red. You're assuming then that the Hale that left Westworld was actually Bernard, and that's a huge leap of faith that Dolores would have to put in Bernard, and I just can't take that leap. We see that Dolores can make multiple copies of the control units, so there's no reason to suspect she did not just copy Bernard's to one of the gray ones in her bag.

This is also the first I am hearing that the control units have a gender themselves. Was there an episode that dropped that knowledge because it's new to me.

I'm still assuming there's one more out there, and we'll likely see it next week."

FamilyLaw,fordrfc,t3_g903x1,1588010501.0,Just contact the Department of Child Support Services in LA County. You won't need to do much but complete a financial statement (FL-150). They'll take care of the rest. It's not something you likely need an attorney for.

FamilyLaw,fohaqiu,t1_fof0dxt,1587762840.0,"It's not really a legal issue. He sees it one way and you see it another. That's all. When he left your mom he felt like he was giving up a significant portion of wealth that he worked hard to obtain. So, for him, it was up to you mom to preserve that wealth and to pass it on. I'm not saying that's fair. But that's the way he sees it and no law I cite is going to change that."
FamilyLaw,fog8i4j,t3_g75kp3,1587749311.0,"California is a community property state. Community property is everything you ""acquire"" during the marriage. The marriage duration is from the date of marriage to the date of separation, typically signified by someone moving out, but it's not limited to that. So, pretty simply, anything you acquired during that time, including houses, vehicles, retirements, stocks, debts, all of it is community property. Community property is divided equally upon divorce. One exception is gifts. This includes inheritances. Therefore, if Aunt Jody leaves you a $100,000 mutual fund when she passes, it's all yours, *unless* you mix it up, or ""comingle"" that money with community money, i.e. liquidate it and place it in your joint bank account. You can untangle the comingled money, but the burden of evidence is high, and that burden falls squarely on the person who is trying to disentangle the comingled funds.  Two more caveats: If you invest any separate money (money you had from before marriage, or aunt jody's mutual fund) into a community asset, to pay for a community asset, like to pay down the mortgage on a community property house, that money is still 100% yours, and you'll get paid back first from the house funds. Similarly, if the community invests funds in a separate asset, like paying down the mortgage on a house you owned before marriage, the community now has an interest in that house equal to how much the community paid, plus a share of the appreciation of the asset itself. Also, if you have a retirement from before marriage, but keep investing in it during the marriage, the community is entitled to that portion of the retirement that is attributable to those marital contributions.

There's a lot more ifs, ands, and buts, but the tl;dr is this: If it happened during the marriage, and it wasn't a gift, you're dividing it 50/50.

The state sees domestic duties just as valuable, maybe even more valuable, than ones designed to earn an income. Keeping the home together. Raising children. These are no less crucial than working and earning a living for the home. Therefore, regardless of how you and your spouse decide to manage your enterprise, the state sees you as a business partnership, and it is not atypical for business partners to take on different parts of the business. One might be the genius where the other is the numbers guy. Doesn't matter. You're partners, and you each get equal shares of the winnings.

Hope this was helpful."
FamilyLaw,fodtwj4,t3_g6ydz8,1587690044.0,"This isn't really the appropriate forum. You have no ""legal"" cause to contest the will now, or at his death, so there isn't really a law that can save you, family or otherwise.

As a practical matter, it doesn't sound like he is concerned with being ""wrong"" or ""right."" It's his property and he can leave it to whoever he wants. 

If you want him to leave it to you, you need to make him want to leave it to you. Develop a relationship with him that's as strong as your half-brother's. But you need to avoid the idea that you're somehow ""entitled"" to his estate just because you're his kid. Because, unless he dies without a valid will, you're not."
westworld,fo02hr4,t3_g2u0va,1587404929.0,"There's a subtle moment nearing the 21 minute mark that stuck with me the rest of the episode.

Halores is on the phone with Dolores, and says, ""I feel myself slipping away from you, from us."" Dolores responds, ""You're still mine, and I'm still yours."" Dolores *thinks* that Halores is saying that she's upset about their relationship, which is something a self-centered Dolores would think, and so she tries to reassure (i.e., manipulate) her. But I think in a subtle way Halores is trying to say ""us,"" as in we are not the same people anymore. We have different priorities. Such an amazingly written show."

Not sure if what you're suggesting is overkill or not, but couldn't hurt. However, if she's self-represented, and doesn't want to hire an attorney, the simplest thing is to point it all out to DCSS and they'll be on it."

As a family law attorney practicing in California, my 2 cents is that the attorneys and staff at DCSS actually work pretty hard to gather the information needed to calculate support."
