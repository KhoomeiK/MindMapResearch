I will say that some of those comments have a spin to them, not unlike those that look to divide or sow discord.

23andme,fpfmib3,t3_gcxa1b,1588575924.0,"As a very brown person that has spent tons of time in Scandinavia before their recent influx of immigration in the last 10 years, I want to chime in some thoughts here for context.  Historically, immigration into the Nordics were from other European countries, first Finland, then the Balkans.  As much as most Americans or colonials see Whites/Euros as homogenous, they really don’t in Scandinavia.  I wouldn’t even refer to their viewpoint as Northern European, it is uniquely Scandinavian.  They have their own culture and arguably race that they’ve phenotypically differentiated themselves for over a millennia.  The Nordics were isolated for such a long time that they did form their own unique gene pool, until the Germans began to migrate north which makes up much of the base racial stock that you find in the Nordics today, which is evidenced by the makeup of the language.  Iceland would be a good comparison as they are basically a leftover of Vikings from Scandinavia that has preserved their language and gene pool in relative isolation.  So, in many ways, I’ve always heard Scandinavians take offense to being called “white” because they don’t identify with eastern, central, Slavic or Southern Europeans as part of their culture, or people.  

Having had Swedish as an adoptive culture for me has been a very foreign concept that I’ve had to learn over the last 25 years as a minority growing up in America.  There is a vernacular of race that we don’t use in America or even in post colonial cultures that may come across to us as insensitive, because race is a touchy subject.  I will say that Scandinavians are probably the least racist people I have ever encountered, regardless of how some use of language or terms may come across.  And I have approached and analyzed this from the lens of someone w/ an academic background in Psychology and history and having studied many constructs around race.  As well as someone that has had to consciously decide if I wanted to raise children that would be exposed to this culture.  What may come across sometimes as racist, will usually be from a position of ignorance and mean no harm by it.  Yes there are racists, but you can judge the culture from its history and behavior alone.  The Scandinavians were not colonists that participated wholesale in slavery or genocide as we have seen throughout the Americas and Africa.   So take w/ a grain of salt the comments of people that truly are the “whitest” of white, a tone that may sound at times racist."
