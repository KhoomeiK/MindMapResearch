AlanWatts,fp8l5rt,t3_gc0hve,1588395236.0,"I think he’s trying to get across the point that everything is happening at once, but our consciousness can only view time linearly and things one by one. We literally can only focus on one thing at a time, even tho we’re very good at switching between things in miliseconds, it’s still just one at a time. Things are happening all at once, we just can’t comprehend it w our mind :/ it’s like trying to imagine a color you’ve never seen before, you can’t. Same w comprehending that everything isn’t happening in a linear fashion. Our mind must only view things in a linear fashion in order to make sense of the world, it’s just how it is haha. In one book he said it’s like looking through a hole in a fence. You see a cat walk by, but since you’re looking though the whole you first see it’s head, and then it’s tail, and so you assume the head CAUSES the tail. Sounds silly right? You know the cat is whole, the head does not cause the tail, but since you see it through a small whole (our conscious attention) you assume that the head causes the tail. Our conscious attention is narrow and singular, that’s just a part of being human haha so in reality there are no causes and effects, everything is whole (like the cat) but our minds create time and order and separate things/events in order to interact w the world, it’s automatic and we can’t really help it. I’m reading his book ‘man woman and nature’ now and in it he says the flowers don’t bloom to attract bees and bees don’t carry pollen to help flowers grow. They have no agenda or goal or purpose at all, there is no reason and no order to nature at all, it is all meaningless and purposeless. :)"

Meditation,fop52ob,t3_g8qz5k,1587953255.0,"The way i see it, When you feel free to get attached as hard as you can, then you’re truly “detached”. Detachment gets confused with not wanting to get hurt or suffer, it stems from a fear of suffering, we have lots of resistance to suffering haha, but we can never escape it no matter what, so the trick is to learn to suffer freely. Let yourself get disappointed and heartbroken and depressed, don’t resist or avoid any of it. I think detachment is when you no longer prefer the Highs to the lows but rather accept them BOTH equally. Learning to suffer freely is honestly a challenge, it’s our instinct to avoid it at all costs ahaha and yeah it’s not pleasant to suffer :/ also you don’t have to decide, you’re not in control of anything, not even your thoughts, they all spontaneously arise from nowhere and go to nowhere. Who controlled your thought of controlling thoughts? There’s no controller and no one to be controlled, no hierarchy at all. Just go with the moment. But also remember there is nothing to be gained at all. Not peace not happiness nothing. No goal to be reached. You’re already there, as a zen quote says “everything is perfect, and there’s always room for improvement” :)"

I’m also in it and you definitely should, the people apart of it are 100% the kindest ppl i have ever met like they are there bc they want to help people and it’s so nice to be around nice people ahaha, they’re all friendly and make you feel welcome, and also you really get to help others in need and learn about important issues like student homelessness. It’s my favorite thing I’ve done at UCLA so far :) the time commitment wasn’t too bad tbh, and i think it’s worth it bc in the end what better way to spend your time than helping others alongside nice people? hope you join :)"

ucla,fo6wo2x,t3_g5ymvx,1587568120.0,"being someone who also came into ucla hoping to one day get a phd in stem field, i kind of feel you. you know what my plans are now? graduate in more than 4 years (im taking my time lol) and then find a normal job n start paying off my crippling loans haha. No grad/med school for sure tho. Sure a lot of people think my ambitions and goals died, but i dont see whats so bad about that. There's so much happiness in simplicity. Trust me I was very ambitious, trying for good grades, joining clubs, etc, but honestly now i take about 12/13 units a quarter, am part of just 2 clubs only as a normal member and spend the rest of my time reading, hanging with friends, watching movies, doing things i ENJOY. sure i wont have amazing grades or be president of something or graduate on time, who cares? For me at least, happiness no longer lies in the promise of a good future, it's right here right now. For some people being a doctor or being 'someone' means happiness and thats awesome! But if you continuously have to look forward to something, you miss out on life Now. My mom also wants me to be rich lmao but i tell her i dont need fancy things, a subpar life spent w ppl i love having free time to do what i like will do just fine. Doctors work a lot, and if you find enjoyment in that then thats great! But you dont wanna dedicate your life to something you dont genuinely enjoy. Trust me, if you become a doctor bc of your parents, money etc, it wont bring you happiness or fulfillment :/ sure itll suck having your parents be disappointed but whose parents arent disappointed in them? lmao, ik ppl look down on others who 'give up dreams' but you DESERVE to be genuinely happy in your life, right now AND in the future. if you dont wanna spend months studying and stressing about the MCAT, its ok you dont have to! you can relax! you can enjoy yourself! Whatever you decide, best of luck to you :)"

MadeMeSmile,fo33628,t1_fo31tpv,1587479662.0,"Hey just wanted to say there is nothing wrong with needing help sometimes, please do not feel embarrassed or anything at all, we all struggle sometimes and that’s okay. It is wonderful to see this sweetness in the world tho ur right! :) but also remember, for kindness to exist there has to be someone giving AND someone accepting, if there was no one to accept the gifts, there would be no kindness and sweetness around, so whatever role you play, both are equally as valuable and important for there to be generosity and kindness, wish you and your family the best !! :)"

AlanWatts,fnwbd2z,t3_g49tah,1587315125.0,"A lot of his books are about Taoism, not sure if youve heard about it, Taoism is a chinese philosophy based on the Tao, but the Tao is this Undefinable Un-namable 'thing' that underlies all and is all. To call it even a thing is misleading as that's still a definition lol, I dont think he meant that there's secret, but rather that we are never ever going to be able to describe or define IT. What is IT? well you cant logically/consciously know IT. Its there for sure, but words cant grasp it, neither can logical thought. The Tao is also described in this way, never being able to define it or consciously grasp it. However we can intuitively feel IT by not feeling it. The catch 22 is that the more you try to feel it the less you do. Even purposely trying not to feel it doesnt help, yet even trying and not trying is still feeling IT all along. As to the 'waking up' I think he's referencing from Zen the spontaneous awakening called Satori that comes about naturally with no effort involved at all, it can be brought about by even simply seeing a crumpled piece of paper, and any effort to reach this awakening doesnt help, it has to be tzu jan (of itself). So all along yes, deep down, we can simply be awakened by any simple thing but no method can get us there, it just happens of itself. I think fooling part is us thinking we're just the conscious thoughts and logical thinking is all there is to us, without identifying with our intuition and spontaneous actions as well. But thats just my two cents on the thought :)"
Meditation,fnvziv1,t3_g48s5n,1587308317.0,"I’m so sorry about your loss :( one book I think might be good is “when all is not well” by Om Swami. It’s written for modern western people, and discusses depression and other hard topics in a mindful way. And also does not force the Buddhist aspect although written by a Buddhist monk (who was actually a business man before i believe) i think it would suite a person from any religion. But again, I’m sorry about your suffering and wish you and your family the best !"

Don’t feel bad if you can’t help right now, there will be a time when you can as well as when u can’t. Also, the person being helped is just as important and necessary as the helper when it comes to kindness existing, so no matter which role you play in the kind action, you are equal in its creation :) as for how to go about doing it, it’s up to you! Good luck w everything :)"
taoism,fnqyegv,t3_g2glmm,1587174972.0,"To me wu wei has to do with trusting yourself and not having a fear of ‘messing up’. Sometimes when texting people i plan a text reply or think it over to make sure i say the ‘right’ thing, but then i catch myself and just type the first thing that pops into my mind (wu wei) same with in person conversation, not thinking about what to say but just saying it, never second guessing. Conversations seem to flow smoothly :) but also it means not being afraid of ‘messing up’. Maybe something u say ends up upsetting someone, that’s still wu wei, there are no mistakes. Sure maybe you’ll be sad that you said something u think is ‘wrong’, but it’s still the Tao, and not wrong. I also find it in my school work, less straining and forcing myself to study when i am tired, and more just studying when i feel like it and have the energy has actually led to better grades, and i actually feel as if i did less work than before. And on exams, not overthinking my answers, just writing what comes to mind and leaving it. I guess to me Wu Wei means letting your words and actions flow smoothly, without a part of you standing over second guessing or planning everything you do."
ucla,fnozoju,t3_g2z1uh,1587136634.0,"I’m sorry but if you can’t be completely honest w them n feel comfortable saying no then maybe you should find different people :/ the social class isn’t the problem trust me, you can have loads of differences w friends, it’s the understanding and honesty that matters. Freshman year i did random roommates for a classic triple (ddnt know anyone going in) n I had 11R, meaning i could barely ever go eat w people unless they swiped me in, and my friends who ddnt have P were understanding and said it’s fine we can do something else, and my ones who did have 19P always offered to swipe me in and would go out of their way to invite me for food sometimes. Also going out was also rough bc yea my bank account was constantly under 20 lol, but w understanding friends we still took the bus to the beach, went to frats parties, got iced coffee on a walk, even tho theyyy did have $$. Yea it kinda sucked seeing ppl b able to go to Cafe Gratitude n uber everywhere haha but w real friends sitting outside on the curb talking is more than enough :) also i met these ppl after school started so don’t worry too much about making good friends, it’ll happen. Be honest w them, n don’t be ashamed, once i even had to borrow $ from a friend to buy a swipe bc i was out of swipes n money n ddnt have any food to eat that day lol, but she was understanding n happy to help. We all need help sometimes n that’s okay. Now I’m sooo much better, n don’t ever hesitate to help my friends who need it. I hav friends who can’t go grab food on campus bc $, so i offer to pay. But also maybe you can get a job that’ll help you get pocket money this summer or during the school year? Anyways, hope everything works out! :)"

depression,fnjb7gu,t3_g23k19,1586995487.0,"ahhh im sorry she put that burden on you :( I think there is great misunderstanding on her part about depression; i dont think depression can be caused by a single person, it's usually more complicated than that. So at the same time, you are NOT the reason for her depression, at all. Please do not blame yourself for her depression or hold yourself accountable for her feelings, they are not your responsibility. I'm not saying that to be cold or heartless, you can obviously still care about her and want her to be happy, but you cannot cure her depression just the same way you cannot cause her depression. If people were behind eachother's depression i feel like it would be a lot easier to deal with lol but it's by far not that simple at all. Most likely a lot of different factors played into it but we usually tend to blame the easiest thing, which in this case was most likely you. I doubt you could change what she thinks, so don't focus on changing her mind, just try to keep yourself safe. best of luck w everything !"
