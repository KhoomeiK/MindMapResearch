However, if pre-med is the goal, do keep in mind that UCR has its benefit in that it would be easier for you to earn a high GPA and to stand apart from the rest of your class. And medical schools don't differentiate between the UCs - frankly, they just don't care. UCR medical school does take half of its incoming medical students from it's own undergraduate graduating class...However, with so many students know that this would be far from a guarantee. The students here are less social and can be pretty conceited at times, but of course with so many people, you're bound to find a few people you like..."

The weird thing though is that I feel like I got to know a few of my professors better than most students, received compliments from some of them and some knew my name..talked/joked a bit in office hours....but still it felt like it wasn't the time to ask for a letter. It's just 10 short weeks and the professors don't have the opportunity to witness anything other than your overall grade and the questions you ask...

 I feel that I have to IA for a couple professors and do research with a 3rd or 4th to get a more personal letter, but everyone's trying to IA aren't they?  Not sure what to do."

UCSD,fnohipk,t1_fnof5wh,1587125211.0,"A ""spike"" is likely to occur but not at the same height as in late April/May. A % of people will have immunity -slowing the spread somewhat- and testing/PPE production will hopefully have improved. Also high temps of summer could slow/weaken it. If it takes off again, it's more likely to really do so in winter. Most URIs take off in winter, regardless of vaccine availability.

Flu vaccines aren't offered until about mid-October or November and we see there's little spread of flu in October or November: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm

UCSD,fnnymq1,t1_fnny3yt,1587105889.0,The incentive for them would be that they would get some money from the people that choose in-person...also if they open food places/bookstore on campus. I don't think they could be held liable unless they made attendance mandatory. Otherwise people go in on their own volition. Even professors. Some prefer in-person and others could choose to teach a following quarter or year.
UCSD,fnnyfbq,t1_fnny1ku,1587105695.0,That's not as bad because they focus less on one face out of many. But if it's a small class the professor could literally just sit and stare at your face for two hours if they wish...for whatever reason lmao

UCSD,fnnwdc4,t1_fnnvpwk,1587103790.0,International travel shouldn't matter if they allow students to choose. I think this would be a great way to ease back in to school and work.

There's no option to upload a resume and I haven't worked for UCSD before..have no teaching experience...So the two main sections on that application will be blank.

 Should I treat the ""Is there anything we should know about you..."" section as an About Me section/an opportunity to further present myself? IAing will allow me to help others and further solidify my knowledge, but I also see it as an opportunity for professors to get to know me better. Thanks."

1. Far better organization - it's easy to title each set of notes and to pull these out again for review.
2. It's easy to cut and paste, add in photos, change colors, etc

You don't need the most expensive iPad just to take notes. Don't pay $1000 for the newest model lol. Not worth it, especially if you already have a laptop for watching vids, social media, games, etc"

UCSD,fnmcx1x,t1_fnkken7,1587069167.0,"If classes are in-person in the fall, it would clearly be optional.

It's definitely tough. More than the social aspect it's the lack of motivation for me. Having to stay at home 24/7 makes me want to just lay in bed all day. I'm ok with a couple hours of studying at my place but I'm not used to doing it for an entire day...

Of course, I prefer everything in person, but right now that's not hitting me quite as hard."

UCSD,fnhetbx,t1_fnhbmv9,1586961036.0,"Nice. It's great that at least you can believe in yourself.

Why do you inquire about my gender so much? Where did I list my gender? You're more interested in everything else about me than the actual subject above.

UCSD,fngya2l,t1_fngqqzo,1586949346.0,"Simply because the policy has been implemented before doesn't make it reasonable.

UCSD,fngd67j,t1_fngaby2,1586928672.0,"Of the hundreds of professors that have some semblance of power at this school, *very few* implement such a policy. 

This isn't a job wherein an employer expects labor in exchange for a wage. This is a service that the students are paying for. If a consumer requires a break from spending, it would be illogical to prevent them from returning.

Typically, the one in a position of power is the individual with the money. Students do have the power to change things if they ever were serious enough about it. For now, I'm merely looking for discussion."

It may feel discouraging to have a small crowd attending discussions but this is rather petty. Strict policies just to appease the feelings of the TAs?

Further, you have a worsening economy that will lead us to even more problems than we have now if we all sit in our houses for a year. Know that the economy does affect healthcare and the quality of healthcare that citizens can acquire and medical professionals can provide. Do you think everyone is having an easy time paying rent and groceries right now? Many in our nation will end up evicted, families homeless and unable to feed themselves. This *will* happen if this persists. How do you expect people to continue jobless through the year? Such a nice luxury as a young student to forget about this major detail...No, bills do not disappear. If we continue this way per your plan, what is the point of you remaining in school? You won't be able to get a job in a major depression. Businesses will have shut down and all markets will be too competitive for a young, naive new hire. Even if in pursuit of medical school, we can't guarantee that the usual, necessary loans will be available.

Cautious steps forward is the key. The elderly, who are mostly retired, must still remain in lockdown. The immunocompromised should remain in lockdown. Slow return with cautious steps by most others is necessary. Frequent testing and increases in mask/glove production will give us some control of this virus spread but know that we will not be able to stop it entirely...not anytime soon at least. If there's immunity to this (we'll be able to track this if we can get antibody tests going), then these people should be the first to return. Very frequent testing and required 2 week isolation period for those with positive results will make a big difference!"

UCSD,fn2zlt9,t3_fz3isj,1586608793.0,Yes it is true. Try to complete the courses listed for your major on assist.
UCSD,fn24ncq,t3_fyugdg,1586577737.0,"Sleep/study schedule, party habits, alcohol/drug use, preferences as far as friends coming over, cleaning frequency (if you're a little messy don't room with someone that is a neat freak or you'll have problems...same if vice versa). If you have any weird requirements like sleeping with a sound machine or a loud fan, using fragrances/incense(someone was on here complaining about this a while back), etc. Snoring? Not fun...there's a chance they wouldn't admit to it.

Also general questions about interests - hobbies, music taste, tv shows, sports/gym, etc anything that you could potentially bond over while rooming."
UCSD,fn0m20l,t1_fn0buxe,1586544438.0,Thank you!!! :)
UCSD,fmzlql2,t3_fy8reu,1586524059.0,Please fight for in-person fall quarter or for them to at least not rush the decision to do fall quarter online...Things may have changed significantly by then in any number of ways.
UCSD,fmze0kl,t3_fydp9c,1586517009.0,"Keep waiting, you're allowed to add a class until next Friday."
