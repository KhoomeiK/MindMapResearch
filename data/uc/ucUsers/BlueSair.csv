AnimalCrossing,fopy5tb,t3_g8web4,1587976127.0,"blathers: This specimen flourished long before the dinosaurs and was a sort of armored fish. Curiously, only fossils for the head and shoulders have been found. We must simply imagine the rest!

blathers: This specimen, also called the striped beakfish, is a lovely fish with a distinctive striped pattern. It is reportedly also a very curious fish in that it has been known to approach swimmers to “greet” them!

also blathers: it’s called a stinkbug because it stinks and i hate it"
