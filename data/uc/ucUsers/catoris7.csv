A couple of folks have mentioned that lying on the stomach is supposed to help, so Iâ€™ve been trying to do that as much as I can. 

My roommate has been the best, and has been taking incredible care of me this past week. Beyond grateful for her"

The only other time Iâ€™ve left my apartment in the last month has been to go grocery shopping two weeks ago when I was healthy. I did so by staying as far away from people as I could, while wearing a mask"
