lawschooladmissions,fp8w2nj,t1_fp8ut9a,1588404998.0,I did but it wasn't as good as someone whose been out of undergrad for a couple of years
lawschooladmissions,fp8ucw5,t1_fp8ra6y,1588403282.0,I think work exp is extremely important. I had 50th lsat and 75th gpa for many of the T14s and was waitlisted everywhere except 1.
lawschooladmissions,fp8nynr,t3_gc0xnw,1588397537.0,Where ru going?

lawschooladmissions,fp4dzs6,t3_gb8ulq,1588297022.0,Keep in mind that BL salary isnt permanent. After a couple of years many people burnout
lawschooladmissions,fp1y8of,t1_fp1xmw5,1588250996.0,Love it! So true
lawschooladmissions,fp1uqt8,t3_g9p4e2,1588248360.0,Where are you going? congrats!
lawschooladmissions,fp1l5o5,t1_fp1l01y,1588239308.0,OP’s school does not have -/+. So lets say he ends up with a 90% in one of his classes. On his transcript it will show A and LSAC will read A. LSAC would not know he actually got an A- because the school doesn’t give -/+.
lawschooladmissions,fp16cnb,t3_gaphxh,1588225654.0,It can also be advantageous to you since if you get an A-(3.7) they will count it as an A (4.0)
lawschooladmissions,fp12yrp,t1_foyewtk,1588222984.0,Holy shit that convicted sex trafficker is probably making bank.
lawschooladmissions,fp0oi2z,t3_gamsqo,1588213469.0,Congrats on your cycle!!! Thats very interesting how u didn’t apply to any east coast school.

lawschooladmissions,fp00th6,t3_gagzx5,1588200363.0,Why not just join r/lawschool?
lawschooladmissions,foxfiin,t3_g9s8hz,1588142418.0,"If it makes u feel better, I've never seen anyone go UR3 and get a WL afterwards. So I think ur either accepted or rejected"
UCSantaBarbara,fovwttr,t3_g9veoo,1588108910.0,I know some transfers who have thrived in Econ. U can do very well in it if u put in the time.
UCSantaBarbara,fotspk1,t3_g9hi89,1588064752.0,Ur totally fine. Majority of the people in my classes were asians
lawschooladmissions,foqys1z,t3_g92bga,1588003186.0,Is $$ for ucla 75k roughly? Congrats on your cycle.

UCSantaBarbara,foe8jgz,t1_foe869o,1587698215.0,"Also its just incentivizing everyone to cheat.
Many of these classes are on a curve and im sure students are taking tests together so ur practically at a disadvantage if u don’t cheat."
UCSantaBarbara,foe7rnh,t1_foe7jau,1587697753.0,But pstat changed its mind after people complained.
lawschooladmissions,focvhli,t3_g6v2s5,1587676427.0,U just got waitlisted right now?
UCSantaBarbara,fo8vgsa,t3_g678us,1587604682.0,I just emailed them!
lawschooladmissions,fo820ph,t1_fo7exe6,1587588499.0,"just in terms of BL correct? Part of why I am struggling is because I don't know whether I would like BL and would want to work in that environment. Ideally i'd like to have that option though. Also, isn't there a value of having all your connections in the city where you want to practice?"
lawschooladmissions,fo7ea8m,t1_fo75hnt,1587576863.0,But its random....
lawschooladmissions,fo5u1yf,t1_fo5t9x7,1587535691.0,Sorry i edited to add a bit more info
lawschooladmissions,fo5tzmo,t3_g5vs05,1587535634.0,Someone call the bot!
lawschooladmissions,fo5mxmg,t1_fo5mhwo,1587529723.0,I see. So it would be kind of pointless to go to Duke only to come back to LA and get a small firm job basically? I think the issue I'm having is i'm not 100% sure I want to do BL but unfortunately it seems like I have to plan my career before I choose a school :/
lawschooladmissions,fo5mdod,t1_fo5lgk7,1587529291.0,"So by non-big law LA chances, i'm assuming that just means small/medium sized firms. Why would it be difficult to obtain these jobs coming from Duke? I know Duke probably won't have any connections to them but if I just apply myself, would they likely not hire me?"
lawschooladmissions,fo5lv87,t1_fo5jtih,1587528898.0,Not sure yet since I don't know if I will be continuing to live with my parents in LA. Pretty certain I want to come back here though.
lawschooladmissions,fo5l2u7,t1_fo5ks03,1587528309.0,but..... the weather :(
UCSantaBarbara,fo1al92,t3_g548oq,1587429159.0,"Also, at least they should do it for the people already in the major."
UCSantaBarbara,fo19pwv,t1_fo17qpz,1587428641.0,I signed!!
lawschooladmissions,fo11um1,t3_g53g09,1587424069.0,Kind of! Im open to practicing law for a few years after law school but probably want to go into business afterwards.
lawschooladmissions,fo0ti5u,t1_fo05ji9,1587419469.0,following
lawschooladmissions,fnwtedm,t3_g4ag4h,1587325078.0,"I think it really depends on what u wanna do. Im in a similar boat except i have 1 T14 acceptance and ucla. I dont really think im interested in doing BL or any of the exit opportunities that come from it. Ideally want to be an entrepreneur working in CA. Don’t be afraid to carve out your own path. Just because everyone wants to go to BL, doesn’t mean u should follow"
lawschooladmissions,fnrugk9,t3_g3jupq,1587202009.0,For the t14 having the stats will just get ur foot in the door. The rest is a crapshoot
UCSantaBarbara,fnq53kj,t1_fnq2al2,1587157846.0,Depends when u send it. I think around June they were going thru WL people
lawschooladmissions,fnnqegs,t1_fnnpg8n,1587098764.0,Qoi?
LawSchool,fnn0pjn,t1_fly3ayp,1587081950.0,Is mid-sized generally easier to get than BL? Im looking at a T14 school that Im considering going to but everyone goes to 500+. Then I looked at a regional school and there are more chunks of ppl going to midsize. I've also heard midsize is same hrs as BL but less pay? Is that true?
lawschooladmissions,fnm46jp,t1_fnlwxl4,1587064789.0,There are already some online law schools that operate that way (no in-person)
lawschooladmissions,fnk6p71,t3_g293zf,1587016609.0,I think people really overplay how much their school name will matter in the long run.
UCSantaBarbara,fnk6iu4,t1_fnk5dst,1587016455.0,Who do we email?

UCSantaBarbara,fnjvxmx,t1_fnjuptc,1587008265.0,Pstat did also but they changed their mind
lawschooladmissions,fnjozuq,t3_g25iuf,1587003679.0,"Hopefully none

Edit: i love how i get downvoted. I guarantee if u guys chose a lower ranked school at full ride over HYS for example and they cancel all student debt the next yr, u’d be bitching like crazy that u had to pay for someone else’s education and that u got penalized for making a wise financial decision."
lawschooladmissions,fnisi54,t1_fnipvu2,1586985591.0,Nah not sticker.
lawschooladmissions,fnionyy,t3_g1hx5a,1586983646.0,If u had USC/UCLA I would take one of those and move on with my life since ur trying to work in CA anyways. But with ur stats I wouldn't settle for less tbh
lawschooladmissions,fniogvx,t3_g1cxd1,1586983547.0,I pm'd u congrats!

UCSantaBarbara,fnemnww,t3_g15l7a,1586892091.0,What type of grad school?
lawschooladmissions,fnem97c,t1_fne6s58,1586891886.0,I plan to practice in LA. Not 100% sure about BL. Might prefer a midsize. Just worried I fly across the country and all the connections I make will be on the east coast
lawschooladmissions,fnd32fb,t3_g0zsyv,1586856800.0,Same dilemma for me but with UCLA/Duke. Not due to cost however but due to where i wanna practice :(
lawschooladmissions,fnd0zoq,t3_g0y7am,1586854456.0,So weird how u got Cal but got WL to UCLA.
LawSchool,fn5sep6,t1_fn53ra2,1586674280.0,"Im referring to Duke vs UCLA. Have a small scholarship at UCLA so cost difference is not significant. I think I'd prefer transactional work. Its around 40% for UCLA BL, whereas Duke has 65% and 15% do FC so it is a safer bet. Going to UCLA would also be very convenient for me since I live in LA and plan to practice here. My goal after law school is to learn as much as I can then go solo (prob as a transactional lawyer). Not really sure if BL experience will help me in that respect."
UCSantaBarbara,fn5pj6o,t3_fzqu6j,1586671594.0,What did u say?
LawSchool,fn5hy5q,t1_fn4zmxq,1586665345.0,UCLA and Duke
lawschooladmissions,fn4i3vw,t3_fzim6f,1586641843.0,"Due to taking a lot of APs in high school, I was able to take some time off to study for the LSAT and still graduate on time."
UCSantaBarbara,fn3rcak,t1_fn2ii4w,1586626414.0,I thought it was harder than 10A lol
lawschooladmissions,fn2fj9c,t3_fywdct,1586587219.0,"It all depends on you. Some people are naturals at the LSAT and they start with a diagnostic higher than what I scored on the actual test lol. For me, I sucked at it so it required more time. Only reason why I was able to go straight into law school was because I didn't have many classes to take my junior/senior yr."
UCSantaBarbara,fmz55jg,t3_fya9h8,1586506793.0,"During my freshman yr, my first and a bit of my 2nd quarter at ucsb, I was completely miserable. Actually applied to a few schools to transfer out and got into them. I didnt really make friends with the people in my dorm. Every club i joined was a complete bust. I decided to rush that yr and eventually made some close friends. Also at the same time I started making friends in my accounting classes and drinking with some of them on the weekends. UCSB is a big school and it can be hard to make friends if u don’t put in effort. I would keep working at it and eventually u’ll find ur group. As a senior, I can definitely say ucsb was the best time of my life and I am so happy I didn’t transfer out."
lawschooladmissions,fmyuq8e,t3_fy8jxp,1586496347.0,"This right here is my biggest nightmare.

UCSantaBarbara,fmoo4is,t3_fwf886,1586264643.0,"136c- ru used to Harmon's exams? Felt it was the same as 3b/136a 

140a- it was chill but didn't take the final cause of corona so not a good person to ask

118- I really liked this class with Fulkerson. The good thing about this is you can't really study it(which Fulkerson even admits). Just interpreting financial statements.

101- took it over summer with Birchenall a few years ago. I thought it was so hard. FAT curve though. My C- or D+ in the class got curved to an A"
