UCSantaBarbara,fpbzaf7,t1_fpbykr3,1588482765.0,">Really?  The second point is a bunch of cliches in a row, and if you look at the people commenting in agreement with OP, their comments don't sound anything like that.

That's literally the point. OPs tone is totally indicative of this paradigm "" This does NOT look like social distancing. ""

Again:

>This does NOT look like social distancing.

Ok? That would be correct. Ok? What are you going to do about it?

Do you understand now?"
UCSantaBarbara,fpbxuc0,t1_fpbxi8n,1588481596.0,"I totally disagree. His second point is hardly an exaggeration, and his entire post is a poignant criticism of reddit outrage culture leading to absolutely no results.

In fact, his comment gets to the very root of the issue, which is that it's probable that this post was made entirely for validation, as the OP has not displayed any *actions.*"

UCSantaBarbara,fnu41mu,t1_fntwidm,1587254123.0,"Yup, the admin staff send out about 10 emails each year for events that literally no one shows up to, and make $50-200k for it depending on position. It's ridiculous--I wouldn't be able to look myself in the mirror if I were them.

I was on an AS board here, guys, we spent thousands on booking fees for events we expected no more than 5 people to attend). I gotta tell you, seeing it purely objectively, admin serves to:

1. Eat public funds
2. Give public funds to the ideological speakers they prefer, with no recognizable benefit to the school"
