I posted a snippet of my island people loved it but i still can‚Äôt shake that mine is just kinda boring and not as cool as other people‚Äôs!! I think the comments got to me too. I chose an urban/ Japanese influenced (but tried not to make it TOO Japanese) theme just because I love city life. I love organized chaos and busy streets, but then saw comments saying ‚Äúthese are overdone‚Äù :/ makes me feel insecure about it"

AnimalCrossingTours,fp01ss9,t3_gaeatz,1588200882.0,I love my urban/modern island but I get what you mean. My boyfriend got tired of his animal crossing so as soon as I‚Äôm done with my island I‚Äôm gonna make a second island that‚Äôs v natural on his switch haha

AnimalCrossing,foogsv4,t1_foo1621,1587938693.0,"I have, and only twice where I skipped one day. Once on the first day so I can visit friends, and another time where I was super impatient about a renovation lol. So don‚Äôt feel bad that it‚Äôs ‚Äúslacking‚Äù haha.

AnimalCrossingTours,fooapev,t3_g8jvom,1587935666.0,"Thank you all for the comments :) I really appreciate it considering the laboring work it took lol. My first attempt at this, I made the streets too narrow. I literally had to pick everything up, terraform, and extend it an extra two blocks. In order for me to do that I had to adjust everything that was in those two blocks and also move it two blocks to the left lmao. Took FOREVER."

AnimalCrossing,fonz8ox,t3_g8kl6q,1587929393.0,Sorry I can‚Äôt find the comment but I believe someone had mentioned it depends on the personalities you have at your island right now. For example if you have 2-3 jocks you‚Äôre less likely to get them in the nook island
AnimalCrossing,fonyzpn,t3_g8knjd,1587929252.0,bruh burn the whole island down
AnimalCrossingTours,fonxi1g,t1_fonvg9z,1587928412.0,Thank you! That‚Äôs what I was trying to go for. I wish AC had more buildings so I could have added it and by the time I decided to make this I already had my villager residential area set up so I had to improvise.

PublicFreakout,fok3eqn,t1_fok2pou,1587834666.0,Yeah I agree with your first point. I‚Äôve worked in customer service and I‚Äôve laughed out of how ridiculous a customer is being. Granted I got in trouble cause the customer got more infuriated when I did laugh a little. But it happens

acturnips,fogsdr4,t1_fogrj3w,1587756436.0,"sure that‚Äôs fine. But it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt in the games mechanics‚Äù to trade I‚Äôm large platforms like this either. People make the argument that TTing inflates the AC economy but simply participating in these types of turnip exchange forums inflates it. You‚Äôre ‚Äúmeant‚Äù to play with your prices, so by selling at someone else‚Äôs island you‚Äôre technically cheating too. 

Look I don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs considered ‚Äúcheating‚Äù but I don‚Äôt like the elitist thinking that it‚Äôs inherently bad, when let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîeveryone on this sub is cheating. Also it‚Äôs cool to know you go for insults than a respectful debate, really shows the kind of person you are."
acturnips,fogposo,t1_fogn88n,1587755542.0,"Hm So you wouldn‚Äôt go to an island selling at 500+ to sell your turnips if you knew they had time traveled? OP here TT to stay on the same day so people can come in, and you wouldn‚Äôt have taken advantage of that? If you wouldn‚Äôt have then I respect your opinion. If you would then piss off cus you‚Äôre also a cheater."
acturnips,foggwls,t1_fogebuz,1587752432.0,"Yea man, they‚Äôre no better. They‚Äôre cheating the system by taking advantage of trading platforms like this. ‚ÄúiTs nOt hOw tHe gAmE iS mEanT to Be pLaYeD‚Äù üôÑ ppl need to get off their elitist high horse"

When it‚Äôs with free porn men don‚Äôt give a shit, they jerk their meat, finish, and go on with their lives. But when a girl has an onlyfans it‚Äôs somehow bad that she‚Äôs taking advantage of the objectifying culture that men has put women in.  And why only mention women? Men have onlyfans and are ‚Äúhoeing‚Äù around. OP is gay and is specifically talking about men here but you‚Äôre only pointing fingers at women. Check your misogyny."
