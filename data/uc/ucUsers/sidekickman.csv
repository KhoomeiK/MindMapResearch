Games,fpdhymj,t1_fpdcw5y,1588527345.0,"No. I encounter this problem at 5'7"" 135lb. It's bending over, crouching, and leaning that causes it. No mainstream VR systems track your true body orientation - they interpolate it from your controllers and HMD. This means that exceptional positions (ie, crouching low and leaning far to the side) will have your body vastly misplaced.

I think foot tracking points *might* solve a lot of it, but frankly some sort of computer vision tracking like what Leap has or what Kinect had would be pretty significant."

Games,fpbinhe,t1_fpb0zzy,1588470885.0,"Yeah, I agree on this.

We need to look at Frontier's track record. It's below bare minimum consistently. The updates are broken on launch, and the additions always feel like quarter-measures.

And, even more importantly, Frontier tends to promise a lot for the distant future, then slowly backpedal as the time comes closer. In truth, Elite Dangerous has changed precious little given the massive amount of time elapsed. The ""significant"" additions - engineers, guardian tech, thargoids - end up being tiny carrots on long sticks. It's not clear how little the players got until after they've sunk dozens of hours into getting it."

In most ways, Elite is at best a novice in all of its mechanical features. The fact stands that, even as one of the main space games out there, it's just not that great. And not even forgivably so - anyone who's played it can see that there's a ton of obtainable potential being left on the porch because Frontier isn't interested in applying the effort."
Games,fpai7tl,t1_fpag42g,1588448704.0,"This is true. I'm seeing it a lot in games lately: The community has pipe hopes of *the next big update* fixing their problems. And of course, they never do. Because the company got them on the hook anyways. They just need to promise the next one will fix it to get another six months to a year out of their playerbase. Like heroin addicts or something.

Games,fpai0iq,t1_fpaezpd,1588448583.0,"They don't make much money on elite because the gameplay is poorly designed. It actively pushes new players away and turns old players against recommending it. It can be beautiful, but beyond that, the systems in place are very poorly thought out. Had they approached it with a little more insight, Elite would be a go-to VR title and a staple space game.

I mean, look at how *thin* the paint is in Elite. You can't walk around your ship, you can't land on planets with atmospheres, you can't customize your pilot or ship without a microtransaction, quests are ridiculously simple and player organizations are more for roleplay than anything."

That said, Ikiru is kinda like a blend of A Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life, in that they all regard the redirection of a broken sense of humanity.

I never felt that the main character in Ikiru was suicidal, at least not like the protagonist of It's a Wonderful Life is. He's not really shown the value in his own previous actions - he's just trying to figure out what the little time he has left should look like. He's more nihilistic, with the lens of his unavoidable mortality crushing his sense of humanity.

His change does take the form of embracing the general joy of life, the same as Scrooge and the main character in It's a Wonderful Life."
AskReddit,fp8rzpz,t1_fp8is7a,1588401052.0,"You missed the point, I'm afraid.

My guess is that Kim just divorces him and ends up working at HHM, hence that one flashforward where Jimmie tells his secretary to ""Tell 'em **Jimmie** sent ya,"" instead of using his new Saul name.

What we should try and figure out is how Jimmie finds the vacuum guy in the first place. Who would know about him without screwing up BrBa's events? Can't be someone who would intercept him or use his services that didn't. That rules out Lydia and Gus, maybe even Mike.

This leaves me with Lalo. He gives Jimmie the contact, says he can use it if he's worried about Kim. Somehow, Lalo ends up buried, which leaves Saul as the only guy with that ace in the sleeve."
