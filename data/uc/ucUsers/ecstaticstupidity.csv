UCSD,fn0jysg,t3_fydo0c,1586543325.0,"I don't know about the rest of The Guardian, but I went ahead and read through a good chunk of the articles that the guy who wrote that dogshit article wrote. Conclusion: the guy writes pretty dogshit articles in general. He's the type of guy who'd write for some dogshit news org like Buzzfeed. It's best to not take him seriously."
UCSD,fktljqq,t1_fktki2r,1584525364.0,"I'd also question whether it really is a majority of professors that are giving out harder finals to compensate for academic integrity issues.  So far, I feel that my professors have given more than enough leniency in light of the current situation. My professors have shortened the duration of finals ans made them open book as well as even make them completely optional. I've also heard similar stories in my circle of friends who take different majors from me."
