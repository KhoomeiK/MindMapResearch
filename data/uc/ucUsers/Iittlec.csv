AskReddit,foseyzb,t3_g8sx1g,1588029400.0,"broke into my house. literally. 

i was sleeping and i hear my window open and immediately sit up and see a body CLIMB THROUGH and come into my room. 

i freak the fuck out obviously only to hear a familiar voice. turns out this weirdo took my NORMAL ASS text messages as an indication that he should break into my house.... 

i immediately told him to leave and he had the nerve to ask for a kiss... i obviously said no and he had to climb back through the window to leave and he never texted me again LMAO"

I have weekly quizzes for each of my classes and a TON of readings ): sometimes the lecture videos that are posted go over the time limit of the class and due dates are being moved around where they don't even fall on the days that they would have been due if we had class in person. Totally fucks with my ADHD and sense of organization because I picked these time slots for my class for a reason
