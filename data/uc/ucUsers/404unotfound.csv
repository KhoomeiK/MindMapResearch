AmItheAsshole,fpbqfkl,t3_gcbhc6,1588476151.0,"ESH. Obviously your step mom was incredibly bitchy. But of my God you don‚Äôt use an eating disorder against someone in an argument. Do you know how obsessed with it they are, how much they hate themselves, how much they struggle, how much time it consumes? Oh My God."
AmItheAsshole,fpbpl1d,t3_gcb2nb,1588475550.0,"Gentle YTA. This is wrong, and it‚Äôs good to realize it, but we all do stupid things. I think if you come clean to the mother and apologize, all will be okay."
AmItheAsshole,fpboq01,t3_gcclg9,1588474952.0,LMAO YES YTA HOW CAN U NOT SEE THAT
AmItheAsshole,fpbn90m,t1_fp8prud,1588473958.0,"I‚Äôm not saying that he shouldn‚Äôt be called on his shit, or that OP was wrong in saying what they said. But it‚Äôs 1000 times harder for people on the spectrum to learn how to ‚Äúnot be a jerk‚Äù, and although it‚Äôs really frustrating we need to know that it‚Äôs just as hard for them and it‚Äôs important that we stay patient and kind. And actually some degree of sexism is common among ASD males, usually stemming from lack of understanding of gender relations or frustrations about rejections. However this and other jerk-y behavior should not be tolerated, and should be gently corrected. 

Neurotypical people are jerks because they lack empathy. ASD people are jerks because they lack understanding. They should not be treated the same."

Also my friend who works in computer engineering verified my theory"

AskWomen,fnmlee3,t3_g2dxgq,1587073541.0,"No offense intended because I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a lovely person, but I disagree with your profession. I think pandering to misogynistic men and proving to them that women are only good for their bodies is not productive. However, it is not my place to judge you and that‚Äôs not my intention (just telling you my opinion!)"
AmItheAsshole,fnm7epo,t3_g2gh5m,1587066392.0,ESH: sure it‚Äôs a sexist tradition but it wasn‚Äôt negatively affecting her in any way and to bring it up months later it just a ridiculous overreaction. But YTA too because it would‚Äôve been easy to solve this problem which obviously upset her
