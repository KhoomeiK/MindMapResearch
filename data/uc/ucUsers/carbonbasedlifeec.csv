For social isolation... I mean cs classes are intense, so do you actually have time to have fun :/ for me it's pretty worth it"

berkeley,fmh5yhf,t1_fmh4trs,1586067837.0,"One thing I found helpful is paying attention to questions students ask during lectures, some of them are really good for understanding the concepts clearly(they are probably those ppl who think of all the ways the solutions could break lol). Denero himself is a very clear lecturer thus concepts are generally not too hard to understand."
