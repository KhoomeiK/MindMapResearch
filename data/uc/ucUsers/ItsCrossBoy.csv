LeagueOfMemes,fpjombi,t3_gdosrn,1588676165.0,Am I the only one who has the opposite happen? The timer hits 0 and I'm still able to lock in and ban for an extra 5 seconds every time (which is when I start to panic and choose the first champ I see)
LeagueOfMemes,fp5jaya,t1_fp5croz,1588331413.0,It seems like some got it wrong and somehow it's spread like crazy. I wonder if there's some oldest video that refers to them as Meeps be accident or something
LeagueOfMemes,fp53soe,t1_fp3nsgx,1588315380.0,"I'm shocked how many people call them Meeps instead of chimes... If people just didn't know what they were called, that'd make sense. You don't play the character, haven't read their abilities closely. 

But how do you know that a Meep is something that relates to his kit without also knowing which thing it is? You would have had to read his kit to figure out ""Meep"" (or see a video on him, etc)..."
leagueoflegends,foi5g5g,t1_fofy0fw,1587779096.0,"Am I the only one who hopes/thinks they'll move to a single window for both the game and client? They're doing it for their other games now (valorant, LOR), and it's pretty much the only way people are doing games now (csgo, dota, etc. I feel like it'd cause fewer issues and be better overall."
pcgaming,fntxdrp,t1_fntqkzi,1587250422.0,Did you even *read* the OP link? It literally makes a case for both kernel-level permissions AND why it needs to be running at all times...
UCSD,fnrxexp,t1_fnqfdyx,1587205296.0,"ucsd doesn't control enrollment numbers, the uc system in general decides for each college, then ucsd decided to build more colleges to lower the number of students per college, not to accept more students"
pcgaming,fnr9lhh,t1_fnpjckc,1587182730.0,Any chance you were able to find it?
pcgaming,fnr9gpi,t1_fnpg8cu,1587182634.0,"Dunno if you're still going to do so, but I'd love to see a write-up about your take on this."
Games,fnr8nk0,t1_fnr5tqy,1587182040.0,"I definitely don't want to get too ahead of myself, as games can easily turn out to be much worse than they seem, but they have revealed lots of early gameplay clips (in addition to the tools they are releasing for others), so so far the progress seems to be pretty great."
Games,fnr5vku,t1_fnmt40v,1587180045.0,"They are remaining independent still. They were purchased as an independent studio, so I don't think they'll have as much influence as most people think they do. 

Really, not that much should actually change, since Riot has been funding them for years now."
Games,fnr5rd0,t1_fnolxf1,1587179964.0,"Except that they are remaining independent, and from what their blog posts made it sound like, they hadn't even decided on a monetization system yet, but it still sounds like it is THEIR decision. If they make it FTP but sell premium skins for the game (which seems like it wouldn't be a good idea given how much they've made it sound like anyone could already make them), it would be their decision."
Games,fnr5jtx,t1_fnm4hj8,1587179819.0,"Also if the game ends up being trash (which I \*severely\* doubt will be the case), chances are it wasn't Riot's doing."
Games,fnr5d4k,t1_fnm6hex,1587179691.0,"I sincerely doubt this would happen tbh. If you look at their devblogs, they pretty much baked mod support into the game. From what I can tell, it seems like they made tools for mod makers to use, and then used those tools to develop a lot of the content in the game itself."
Gamingcirclejerk,fnr4xy3,t1_fnparev,1587179397.0,"I think my favorite part of this is the literal next 4 words change the entire tone of that quote

\>  as an independent studio

The entire quote is literally

\>  Hypixel Studios is being acquired by Riot Games as an independent studio."
deadbydaylight,fnk9uyd,t1_fnfsid3,1587019482.0,"Oh fair point. I suppose I just read it as ""exact numbers"", as that's what people normally say. Granted, for exceptionally small %s, they may be confusing as well. Seeing that something increases your luck by 2% doesn't really make sense. For many things I like percentages, but I think some things make sense to be ""moderately"" or etc."
VALORANT,fnfrh0w,t1_fne8s9k,1586913931.0,"Then it would just be an exploited driver - not a rootkit. A rootkit is specifically something unauthorized that you didn't want to have that access installing without you knowing. 

The concern that it could be exploited is real (sort of, it's pretty unlikely), but that doesn't make it a rootkit."
deadbydaylight,fnfgjaa,t1_fnf9lqf,1586907621.0,"Probably a poor example. Instead, think of it saying a .5s reduction. That isn't helpful for new players. They don't know how long things are to start, so having it say that doesn't mean much."
beta,fnfceaj,t1_fnfc5dt,1586905410.0,"SSL =/= the website is safe 

SSL means that anyone else looking at your web traffic cannot see what you're doing. It doesn't mean the website you're on won't try to take advantage of you, just that no one else can read the information given from or to the website via your internet traffic.

It makes the internet much more secure."
beta,fnf92j5,t1_fnf6yx2,1586903658.0,This is completely untrue
deadbydaylight,fnf8zw5,t3_g16cd6,1586903619.0,"I think the main reason they don't is because a 3% decrease or .1 second increase or 50% reduction means nothing to a new player. They don't know what's good or not, so seeing ""significantly decreases stun time"" is more helpful than ""reduces stuns by .2 seconds"""
LeaksByDaylight,fndh4pg,t1_fncrqix,1586869869.0,"I think part of the problem is both killers and survivors have gotten used to really long chases. These changes are (probably) going to significantly reduce chase time, which may not be a bad thing, people are just going to have to realize they can't loop for ages anymore."
VALORANT,fncok8v,t1_fncg5cc,1586842294.0,"You should probably google what a rootkit is before using the word

rootkits are specifically unauthorized access - you authorize the access when you install it"
UCSD,fnbrn4p,t1_fn9pwb0,1586820957.0,"I have one that just updates the syllabus page with updates, announcements, links, and etc rather than having them on their own page. It's like 3000 words now. 

I almost missed a homework assignment because I didn't see it in the giant wall of text that is that page until the day it was due."
discordapp,fml1p7u,t1_fmky1qd,1586176223.0,A screen reader just reads the information on the screen... Aka it reads the messages discord has. So you're worried because discord could use the screen reader to read... Discord?
Fallout,fmgggyb,t1_fmg2xsq,1586048499.0,"That doesn't work with all games, only ones that support it. Plus I believe I used a poor example - Microsoft has done work to make it so Xbox games can generally be run on windows. It's more like PS4, you'd need an emulator to get it to work

Regardless, the point is, they may be the same game, but that doesn't mean you can just drag and drop them. Some of the content may be the same, but one has steam integration in it"
