UCSC,fnxb2wk,t3_g4d25s,1587335047.0,If you wanted a confirmation then yes CS upper divs are a lot of work.

UCSC,fn2do6u,t3_fyvih7,1586585426.0,I'm just taking BA now and am set for an easy 3rd year graduation
UCSC,fmyasxa,t1_fmx43na,1586481880.0,Just a word of warning that you will still smell weed at Crown. Just far and between at Crown but I definitely on multiple occasions smelled it.
UCSC,fmyao9f,t1_fmxi432,1586481795.0,"tbh crown isn't that bad considering a lot CS classes take place at Classroom unit but other than that 9/10 is closer to a lot more things and the dining hall is one of the best imo. Also it's near the humanities buildings, where a lot of my GEs happened so that's anotha good thing for crown."
UCSC,fmya8ur,t1_fmy07zc,1586481520.0,I live like 6-7hr away from SC. I know usually it's good advice to actually go to the place to check it out for yourself to make descriptions and sizes are accurate and to your liking but obviously can't really do that. I guess I just trust the listings?
UCSC,fmy9qk9,t3_fy3rsx,1586481194.0,I'm changing my major curriculum so I am going to have a dead easy  schedule. Also graduating next year so that will feel very nice starting fall.

UCSC,fmaa7wq,t1_fm91fi9,1585887927.0,Yeah this is pretty good. It's what what my professor used for coding examples for Computer Architecture
