DJs,fpmx0qs,t3_ge7db2,1588743961.0,Most House and Techno DJ's that I follow love dropping breakbeat tracks. Especially later in the night.

MapPorn,foxhj88,t1_fox4k0e,1588144183.0,"People are only leaving California because everyone from different states moves here and pushes them out.  For example, between 2011 and 2015 the Bay Area added 500,000 jobs while only issuing 65,000 units of housing ([source](https://www.bayareacouncil.org/issues-initiatives/housing/) ). San Francisco is still one of my favorite cities, but the displacement caused by the tech industry is extremely sad to see. 

It’s also bad in LA with all the influencers moving from all over to become the next big thing. Salaries in LA for typical jobs such as engineers or teachers are low to average, yet the prices for goods and services are extremely high due to this inflated demand created by unskilled people moving here. People looking to work in the entertainment industry will basically work for free for years because they think it’s going to lead to somewhere better.

Besides many people migrating here to follow their dreams, it’s also the state and local governments’ faults for not building enough housing and infrastructure over the years. I also blame [Prop 13](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13) in 1978, which fucked over future generations in multiple ways. Mainly because it limited the housing supply over the years, while also dramatically reducing the revenue the state should receive from property taxes. This caused the state to raise taxes in all other categories.

Sorry for the rant but I’m tired of seeing Californians being hated on just because they are moving somewhere new to make a better life for themselves. Californians would stay if they could but it’s simply too expensive for a lot of families and young people, and it’s not their faults."
Techno,fow97qz,t1_fow148x,1588115357.0,She was doing a lot of shows until COVID and I was supposed to see her play in LA at the end of March. She’s been promoting her [Buy Music Club](https://buymusic.club)  website lately which is a cool resource. The last music she released was the Teenage Birdsong remix.
FourTet,fow38hz,t1_fow0o93,1588112188.0,Damn was just about to download it too.
nathanforyou,fovpgrq,t1_fovny3l,1588105269.0,Those are my go to as well. Never fails to get people on board the NFY train.

college,fomkvy5,t3_g88d12,1587893865.0,"I started out at a UC but left to attend a CC after my first year because my financial aid was completely cut. The tuition and living expenses were way too high to justify attending UCSC. I am now at CSULB and am extremely content with where I am at.
  
Besides costs, another thing to consider is that there is less risk in CC to take classes in other majors and help you decide what you are mostly interested in.  I am now in a completely different major than the one I applied to from high school because I was able to take many classes in different fields. Not having to worry too much about cost or time constraints when choosing a schedule is a huge relief.

  Also nobody judges anybody for attending a CC anymore. Unless you were accepted into UCLA or UC Berkeley, and you are 1000% sure on what you want to major in, I would recommend attending a CC after high school.

Edit: a word"

dataisbeautiful,fo5tmre,t1_fo5qvd6,1587535309.0,Thanks for the advice! I’ve taken some cs up to data structures but haven’t done any scripting in ArcGIS other than some simple calculations. Going to learn python this summer so I can start applying it to my GIS projects.
dataisbeautiful,fo59l4g,t1_fo4zkji,1587520500.0,Cool map. I’m a geography major and I can’t wait to get my GIS skills up so I can post here :D
electronicmusic,fo4z0f2,t1_fo4tons,1587514029.0,I’m in the LA area so I have a lot of options around me. I use Resident Advisor and [19hz.info](19hz.info) to see what’s going on. Even if you aren’t in a big city I’m sure there is an underground scene near you but you have to search for it.
electronicmusic,fo4pfn5,t1_fo4dgby,1587508684.0,I can’t wait to go stupid to it at the club someday
MyBloodyValentine,fo0tbfe,t1_fnzmk5i,1587419369.0,"If Kevin gets paid to finish the album, and more people start listening to MBV then it’s a win-win. I personally think supreme is lame and I won’t be buying anything but people here are overreacting."

LosAngeles,fnqzbp7,t1_fnqqdaw,1587175580.0,"I grew up in the Garden Grove-Santa Ana-Westminster area in OC. It’s a pretty neat and diverse place, but also still very conservative due to the older Korean and Vietnamese population."
starterpacks,fnkjdgf,t1_fnkcp6h,1587029281.0,Switching to handheld!
indieheads,fniwr9t,t1_fniv2y3,1586987734.0,"I know exactly what you mean! I used to listen to mostly rap and Indiehead type music until I turned 21 and started checking out some of the after hours parties in LA. Now I ‘get it’ and mostly just listen to mixes from my favorite DJ’s now. This set by Avalon Emerson almost entirely influenced my taste of electronic music I listen to now and I highly recommend to anyone trying to get into more club music.

indieheads,fniunxm,t1_fnitvul,1586986670.0,"Check out Burial, Four Tet, and Floating Points if you haven’t. They are known for an unconventional style of club music that sets them apart from others in their genres. Not the same as In Colour, but really good stuff."
DJs,fnfz2v9,t3_g1hj69,1586918577.0,I don’t listen to a lot of electro but DJ Stingray is one of my favorites. He plays electro and with some hard techno thrown in. [In Session: DJ Stingray](https://soundcloud.com/mixmag-1/in-session-dj-stingray)
evilbuildings,fmvglxx,t1_fmvc7ub,1586416271.0,That too I was just referring to how rapidly the building density drops off near DTLA. Reminds me of dodger stadium area.
evilbuildings,fmurar2,t3_fxeqh3,1586397184.0,This is basically how LA still looks 1 mile outside of downtown.
UCSC,fmq0tmt,t1_fmpf4ei,1586290821.0,I do a #1 buzz every month or so because I like how it looks. People our age (early 20s I’m assuming) don’t really associate a buzzed head with neonazis anymore tbh. I’ve definitely gotten joked about and comments from people who are 30+ since that was more of a thing when they were growing up. Just don’t wear combat boots and chains and you will be fine.
