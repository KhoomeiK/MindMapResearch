berkeley,fp7mk4c,t3_gbokbo,1588373471.0,"One of my professors at Fresno State ""forgot"" that the doc camera was on during a test and happen to put the test solution under the camera. It was technically correct but if people forgot to do the problems on the back, well a lot of people had to go to his office after and answer for the incomplete tests. He also found an error in the solution manual, assigned that problem and then proceeded to have a conversation with anyone who matched the solution manual."

AskReddit,fopwoov,t1_fopvlon,1587974660.0,I would assume the effect stays the same. Nobody drinks less because of the taste. Long island ice tea already doesn't taste like alcohol. The only thing a lack of taste would do would allow you to down moonshine and then the obvious answer is the ER for alcohol poisoning.
AskReddit,fopujbq,t3_g8vswu,1587972589.0,Bob usually leaves the office around 4:37 pm. He always parks in stall 37. Step one is too secure funding for a city project to redo the side walk. This will divert Bob to the other side of the parking garage and force him to walk by the apartment buildings. The project should take about 2 years for approval and to go into construction. During said time get proficient at the piano. Right as the project goes out from construction start giving free piano lessons to said apartment residents with an emphasis on residents on the third and fourth floor. During this time befriend a crane operator and assist with some odd jobs. Slowly begin fraying some of the equipment. Next donate an upright piano to a resident at the apartment building on the third and fourth floor. Schedule the delivery to coincide with Bobs leaving of work.
