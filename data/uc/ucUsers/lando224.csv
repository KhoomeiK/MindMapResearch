popheads,fpkvbqn,t1_fpki6xm,1588701664.0,I’m highly interested in hearing you name more than two filler songs on Speak Now and 1989. Hell actually name more than 1 on 1989. I would argue Red has 2 or less also( but I can at least understand the argument it doesn’t). There’s a huge difference between 1 or 2 filler songs and half an album and I don’t think this should take an album out of magnum opus conversation if the rest of the album is amazing.

However, considering the CUB referendum and its main aim to create the black resource center is brought up in the email, and there is a link to vote in there as well (when the email wasn’t even originally supposed to be about the election), it’s no stretch of the imagination to think this sentence is suggesting that voters click on the link and vote yes on the CUB referendum.

Really the only black artist that's actually a pop artist that gets treated this way is Drake (please enlighten me if you have other examples). As for Drake I think its because his songs are less poppy than they used to be and because he's just been so prominent in the media and the radio without taking breaks that we're all kinda tired of him (plus hate regarding Millie Bobbie Brown etc.). As someone who usually dislikes trap music quite a bit I would be completely happy in a world where the four artists I mentioned at the start ruled the charts.

popheads,fnma0vn,t1_fnlx7os,1587067696.0,"Personally I actually really like the second half of rep and think lover is good but not great. If I could split Rep into two halves (first seven and last eight) the first half would get a 5 and the second would get a 9. But strictly talking about production, half of rep hasn’t just aged horribly, it also sounded horrible when it came out. Cohesiveness doesn’t automatically equal good- I could put fart sounds all over my album and say it makes it more cohesive. And that’s essentially what Taylor did on rep, she took thwarty fart sounds and littered the entire first half of the album with them. Without those sounds the album would easily go up a letter grade for me. Songs like Ready for it would be awful either way, but there are some songs like King of My Heart that would be so good if she had just cooled it on the  sounds like you hear at the 0:25 and 2:29 marks in that song. Perhaps that’s why I hate the first half of rep- it’s like if someone went to be the louvre and splattered black paint on the paintings so you could tell something that was once good underneath was ruined by one stupid choice.


Now lover, on the other hand, has some songs with really strong production. IFTYE for example has all these cute quirks that all come together at the end and really win over the listener. The production on her voice in the final chorus is immaculate. I think he knows has absolutely insane production from Jack Antonoff, it sounds straight off Emotion. The production on Cornelia street is similar where it slowly wins you over, and at the 4:00-4:25 mark it really takes it home. Death by a thousand cuts has the awesome piano part. I don’t like YNTCD but the production is top notch. But perhaps most importantly, on the tracks that aren’t as focused on the production but more on the storytelling, like Miss Americana, the production stays out of the way and isn’t a blight on the song. 

Overall the production on Lover is fresh. You could argue it’s safer, yes, but man Rep shows that not all risks pay off. The second half of Rep saves it bc the production stays out of the way more. Lover definitely has its problems (Taylor seems kind of faceless in it and the songs lack the personality her other albums have, rough singles, filler near the end, lack of a true connecting theme) but production is not one of them. In 10 years I could come back and listen to it no problem."
