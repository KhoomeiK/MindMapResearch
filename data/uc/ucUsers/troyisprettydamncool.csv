StarWars,fpfhovo,t3_gd20bw,1588571561.0,"Totally agree. I'm reading Dark Disciple now and a big part of it relies on the reader hating Dooku and viewing him as the worst person in the Galaxy, but like ... That's not really clear anywhere? He's literally a Sith Lord, on par with Maul and Vader at least in title, but he feels more like a lackey and doesn't really have anything to him."
PartneredYoutube,fp1f0tw,t3_gar1q2,1588233325.0,"I would first start with places like Audible, NordVPN, and other affiliate sites that have a clear application process. It might be difficult given the type of content you make but it can be done. I would suggest FameBit to apply to smaller companies, as that was my go-to for sponsorships for a while but they just announced that they would end that as a service.

Basically just apply to a bunch of different places and hope something sticks. It might be a good idea to slowly transition to being more of a personality on your channel, using your voice and adding commentary so that you can more effectively dispute copyright claims as Fair Use, and then also sponsors will more willingly accept. It's tough because the type of content you make isn't really conducive to sponsors, so making that transition overtime (obviously you can't right off the bat) might be a good idea. Invest in a simple USB mic and record a bit of commentary and see how your audience reacts. They might even prefer that format."
PartneredYoutube,fp0x98y,t3_gabltk,1588218996.0,"They're definitely down, but my past few videos have done better than the ones I posted last month and the beginning of this month. 27k subs I used to be capping out at around 2k views but now I'm getting roughly 8k-10k which isn't what it used to be but it's better than it was."
FlashTV,foxpwk6,t1_fowgz1u,1588152110.0,Ramsay was a good villain but I don't think he's good enough to carry an entire season. Previous seasons have shown that it's very difficult for one villain (unless if it's Thawne) to remain a consistent threat for that amount of time. Ramsay was great but 23 episodes of him would have gotten old. He played his part and I would rather they underuse him and bring him back as a guest role like this episode as opposed to overusing like they did with Cicada.
FlashTV,fotrh4h,t3_g9e9ll,1588063511.0,"You mean the entire Flash series? And all Flash stories in general? This character forces itself into logical issues and plot holes there's no getting around that unless you play everything super safe, that's part of the fun imo"
PartneredYoutube,fooijj3,t3_g8e62c,1587939649.0,"I curse like a sailor on my channel (fuck is my filler word, it's a bad habit I'm trying to work on). It really depends and stuff. I've been pretty lucky for the most part, and only one video of mine has been demonetized (it's not fully demonetized, just changed to ""limited"" which means you still get revenue from YouTube Premium and certain advertisers) and I think because it was in the first 30 seconds. So in my experience, yes it does, but YouTube can still always demonetize it for any reason they want, so don't treat it as a be-all end-all rule."
LegendsOfTomorrow,fogu6w5,t3_g7byxk,1587757023.0,I think they might pull a Superman: Reborn where they essentially merge the two of them.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fo5pwtl,t1_fo5pj0u,1587532097.0,"If you're going to talk about systematic racism you inevitably have to talk about white people, just like you have to talk about black people. The conversation can't really continue when you try and tiptoe around calling a group of people by their name, and there's no way there's going to be any progress or improvement if you don't address it properly.

I'm not saying all white people are the problem, nobody is fucking saying that and if they are they're a fucking idiot. But you have to address the overall problem that is how white people are treated by the system, not just ""this white person"" or else it's viewed as a case by case problem and not systematic"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fo5p306,t1_fo5lmih,1587531418.0,"It's not generalizing. ""These"" white people isn't a generalization, they're literally white people and there's a group of them and that group is ""these"" white people."
PartneredYoutube,fnxu6pd,t3_g4jo78,1587346418.0,"It's not my area, but in my experience music has been the most difficult aspect when it comes to copyright claims. But since you're reviewing the music, you have the legal right to use it in your videos since it's transformative by applying your own commentary and criticism of it. So worst case scenario you have to go through the dispute and appeal system (which is a huge pain in the ass, believe me I know) but if you sort it all out before the video goes live then it shouldn't be too big of an issue for you. It's a huge pain though, so just keep that in mind"
PartneredYoutube,fney7fr,t3_g15amy,1586898030.0,"If your channel is doing well and the videos are all monetized, then it should be instant or at least 1-2 days. However you don't get paid until you reach $100 and even then you have to wait for the 14th (or 13th) for the money to go into your AdSense account and then another week for it to be transferred into your bank account."
PartneredYoutube,fnexzwx,t1_fnep59p,1586897923.0,You can but $100 is the minimum. Probably different for different currencies
UCSC,fnc3z1m,t3_g0pogn,1586828121.0,Nah we're slugs. Snails at least have housing.
AnimalCrossing,fn8tqm0,t1_fn8mtrw,1586750010.0,"That makes me SO annoyed. I recently got paths and terraforming and I had planned on having all my villagers' houses in one area with a street on a grid and stuff like a city, but I messed up and misaligned a few houses and it's gonna cost me like half a million bells to fix it"
DC_Cinematic,fmnw6r3,t1_fmmxt9l,1586237077.0,"For sure! BoP did her great but it felt like we only got a little taste of the character so if that's all we get of her, specifically of Jurnee's portrayal I will be so so disappointed. At least give me a Green Arrow/Black Canary movie or something"
DC_Cinematic,fmnvxxq,t1_fmlj9i3,1586236862.0,Holy shit you're right I didn't even notice
DC_Cinematic,fmlj4ys,t1_fmlg9ug,1586187443.0,She really doesn't. Her and Jason don't really have any chemistry and the character spent most of Aquaman rolling her eyes. Get someone like Emilia Clarke who can actually do the role justice
UCSC,fmdrt97,t3_ful72h,1585975979.0,"I made this exact mistake when I got accepted. You can email BSOE advising, or at orientation (assuming you're going and it's not cancelled) you'll have a chance to  talk to someone in person and explain it. Don't worry, there's a reason it was super easy to accidentally switch so it's nothing to stress about."
