Psychic,fpa5d1l,t3_gby5ys,1588441138.0,Hi! I'm sorry to spam you as I commented on your last post but I was wondering if it would be possible to take you up on this offer still.
KoreanBeauty,fot8rjf,t3_g9g94e,1588047292.0,It looks great! That lip color fits you really well!
BeautyGuruChatter,fop4gaa,t1_foozpix,1587952865.0,"You have a good point, which is a damn shame because Chris already has a loyal viewership and a decent amount of views. Even though I \*firmly\* believe he really fumbled the Onision case, so many anti-Onision people really became devoted to Chris and are still staunch supporters of him. 

And honestly? He would have received more views/followers if he was tough on j\* and fought for the truth. The inconsistencies are too blatant in his story. There is so much evidence. What a travesty."
BeautyGuruChatter,foow5uc,t1_foouaxj,1587947741.0,"Yeah :( I had followed Chris during his Onision saga and while it started strong he and his team made very severe missteps that compromised the investigation at the expense of the victims he claimed to advocate for. 

After seeing this interview, it seems very clear that similar mistakes will be made. Jeffree kept steering the conversation and the talking points and Chris let him. Did not push back at all when Jeffree made horseshit excuses his involvement and behavior."
BeautyGuruChatter,foonyho,t3_g7yzhi,1587942807.0,Chris really showed his weakness as a journalist and interviewer by letting Jeffree take control. It was disturbing and it's become increasingly clear that Chris is inept to handle this. Shame on them both.

UCI,fodtt2i,t3_g6rl93,1587689993.0,"Hey, I know this is a luxury/privilege but if you have health insurance/the general means I 100% rec a therapist and/or psychiatrist. A lot of people ik have started phone appts w therapists and it seems like its helping."
community,fnmj36c,t3_g2innd,1587072334.0,I liked all the concepts but the execution didn't really stick. I wonder why /s
community,fnfsktw,t3_g1ac95,1586914581.0,I'm just glad they saved Garrett
KoreanBeauty,fn75cll,t3_g00ww7,1586713599.0,"Lol I mean this might be a hot take but I think that glossier is american version of a lot k-beauty philosophies but maybe that's just me idk 

But thanks for introducing this brand! I'm interested in their products"
AsianBeauty,fn75473,t3_fzssvq,1586713469.0,"I used Klairs Vitamin C serum and I didn't really notice a difference on my skin. It tingled but otherwise, it didn't really improve my hyperpigmentation. 

On the other hand, I notice that my skin looks a lot brighter when I use Innisfree's Brightening and Pore caring sleeping mask (its formulated w/ vitamin c) but b/c I use that every now and then I can't say for certain if it can provide consistent improvement like a daily serum would."
AmItheButtface,fn54qm9,t3_fzlok2,1586655884.0,"INFO: I'm sorry, I'm so confused. Do parents typically also give each other gifts on Easter? Like a mini Christmas? So did your wife secretly give you something and was upset when you didn't give her something? Could it be possible that your wife took a cue from you about continuing with Easter and decided to still celebrate too?"
tarotpractice,fn4wq72,t1_fn4w72u,1586650641.0,Thank you so much!
