Evening everyone!
I'm going to be opening up my (NH) island for a bit, so feel free to come and visit. :)(
Although I may be afk on and off)
It's currently 8:10 pm (20:10) so both Nook's (second lvl) and Able's are open; the hot item is a bamboo bench.
My native fruit are peaches and flowers are lilies and it's currently raining.
I also have some DIYs available:
Sadly there's no special guests tonight. :(

No entry fee or tips required; if you \*really\* want to water my flowers, you can, but there's a lot, so I don't expect anyone to. xD

I'll be using turnip.exchange in order to make this easier:  


*Edit: Bunnie is making a cherry lamp"

Unfortunately, it's not a clear night, nor do I have any special villagers, but you can fish and bug hunt for a while. :)  
There are some DIYs left on a rock close to my house, if anyone wants those.  
**(No entry fee)** \- bolded to make it clear

DM or send me a chat if you want to say 'hi'!

Hopefully your fruit and flowers have grown back. :)  


I have some iron nuggets and other materials as well if that would help. I'm also in the northern hemisphere, but whether you are or aren't doesn't matter to me.   
You don't have to give me anything in return; I just like to help and meet/talk to people.   


I'll also send you a pm. :)"

I don't per se have a small community (just some friends), but I'd love to hang out with you. :) My character goes by my (actual) nickname and she lives on Tè Isla in the northern hemisphere.   


I'm 25, living in California, and have been to the Netherlands; I have a friend there as well, hence why I went. (But sadly, I don't speak Dutch, although I can kinda read it. :S ) Don't know if this helps with hanging out, but I tend to be on and off throughout the day until about 11am CEST as a lot of my friends (and my boyfriend) live in/near that timezone.   


Feel free to message me if you'd like to be friends. :)  


And on a random note, if you live in/near Amsterdam, there's a lovely cafe that I'd recommend (and is hopefully still there)."
