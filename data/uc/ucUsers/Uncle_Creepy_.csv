Idk if English isn’t your first language but your responses almost make no grammatical sense I can’t even respond to them. 

Like what’s your point with this 

>	now quit playing now sure when you beat this or that person you can say matters and not top 15 or 20 what does that matter

Or this

>	names mostly male camps if you haven’t realized

Also learn how to use a period! How is this one sentence?!

>	I’m willing to bet Ngannou could beat Cro Cop and Noguiera in there prime and you know that also, now quit playing now sure when you beat this or that person you can say matters and not top 15 or 20 what does that matter, just Bc they ain’t got Jon Jones, Masvidal, DC, Stipe they are not a top camp, names mostly male camps if you haven’t realized also if you haven’t realized a lot of fighters are now stopping through there so you are clearly just hating and why hate on a camp

seriously? so do you think Clay Guida beating BJ Penn (who is on a 7 fight losing streak)is just as impressive as Frankie Edgar doing it when he was Champ?

>Name someone else who has even so much as beat Blaydes?

is this supposed to be impressive, considering he's never fought for a belt in any organization ever?

>Ngannou clearly beat him worse than Stipe did.

it's odd how much emphasis you put on if someone beat someone worse than someone else but not on where they were in their career.

>the only goat Ngannou hasn’t beat yet is Werdum

and you know, the actual GOAT Fedor, along with Noguiera, and Cro Cop. I'm sure Ngannou would beat them now and not in their prime, which doesn't matter to you. 

>and Stipe

yeah that's gotta be killing you if you're trying to say that him training at Extreme Couture MMA is really good when in fact it's not even a top 15 or top 20 MMA gym lol

Absolutely disrespectful that Stipe was the underdog when he was on a 5 fight T/KO win streak, 4 of them in the first round. 

Francis was also on a 6 fight finish streak, with 4 in the first round but you would think the odds would tip In Stipe’s favor considering he was the reigning champ and was tied with most HW title defenses in UFC history and had better quality wins."
