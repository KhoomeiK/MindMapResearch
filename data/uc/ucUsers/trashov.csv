AncientCivilizations,fnlixkq,t1_fnleozr,1587054340.0,"Also, the Aztecs were CRAZY from the start. This is a mix of legend and history, but I love also breaking this one out because my advisor told me this as an undergrad and I always go WHAT when I think about the audacity of the Aztecs. 

They were actually driven out of their area because they started as a band of mercenary warriors. The main Aztec warrior asked a local king to marry his daughter, the princess. He agreed. So the king sent his daughter to their city to be prepared for marriage and he would meet there for the marriage festivities and celebrations. Well, when the king showed up, he saw the priest standing atop the temple... wearing the flayed skin of the princess. Yup. The Aztecs sacrificed the princess and flayed her so the priest could appease the gods for a good harvest. The king was not pleased and drove the Aztecs to the swampy lands of Texcoco and this is where we get some base of their migration story :)"
AncientCivilizations,fnli1py,t1_fnleozr,1587053907.0,"Ooooh okay i really love breaking this one out because people always go “WHAT, really?!” because it’s something you don’t typically see portrayed or discussed within the cultural context of Mesoamerican societies so, but anyway, I digress. 

Many captured sacrificial victims of the Aztecs were actually willing participants in sacrifice and many warriors actually viewed this as their “endgame” result as being involved in the military. What I mean is that Aztec warriors were raised with the mentality that, eventually, they would be captured by a rival group and would be sacrificed atop the temple. Capturing rival warriors for sacrifice was definitely a big incentive for the Aztecs, and many other Mesoamerican societies, but not to “stick it to their enemy” as we might think of it. It was blood payment. 

This ties back to the stories we see on the Aztec Sun Stone! Yes!! Super awesome. I love this stuff. Anyway, the Aztecs believed that the gods who “became” the suns willingly sacrificed themselves by throwing themselves in the fire and rose to become the sun of that world. Some scholars say one of the worlds, none of the gods were willing to sacrifice themselves. Except one. He was an ugly god, marked with sores and pus-filled. He stepped forward and flung himself into the fire. No debate. No question. He just launched himself into the fire after witnessing the hesitation from the other gods. Here was this grotesque god - the Poxy, Purulent One - and he understood what it would mean if none of the gods willingly sacrificed themselves to become the fifth sun. The universe would collapse and existence would no longer be; so it’s a pretty immense gesture for Tonatiuh, this grotesque sun god, to throw himself into the great pit of fire and rise to become the sun. Another god, recognizing his selfless act, launched themselves into the fire soon after and became that moon’s incarnation. 

I guess what we see here is *why* sacrifice was so tremendously vital and a fate many accepted - even despite how scary it must have been to be prepared for the sacrificial stone atop the temple and have one’s heart removed. It was a duty, no matter what, to provide the gods with sustenance - much like they had done when they became the sun and allowed the earth and world to continue on. Captured war victims understood this and willingly braved that act of sacrifice.

I’d like to point out that “sacrifice” was a term coined by the Franciscan friars and priests who had traveled to the Americas and wrote down their own accounts and there has been no term in Nahuatl which we can translate or could have translated to mean the same thing. Clendinnen - a great read is her “Aztecs: An Interpretation” - mentioned there were three word clusters and the one I really find to be the most fitting is “all those who were to die before the gods.” So, what we view as sacrifice... the Aztecs didn’t really view it as such. It was more of a “replacement” for the gods. Death promotes life, and the death of a victim atop the temple was meant to fuel the earth and nourish the gods, who had died and became the universe. Clendinnen has a really fascinating chapter on this notion of “feast for the gods” and the involuntary debt of humankind to the gods, which I always encourage anyone to read so they understand why human sacrifice is really misinterpreted."
AncientCivilizations,fnlegvc,t3_g2g1tc,1587052126.0,"Yay! This is what my research focus is (Aztec, Zapotec and Mixtec) and I love the Sun Stone. It’s really weird to call it a calendar in the traditional sense because it actually represents previous incarnations of the sun & how that world was destroyed by that sun’s incarnation. I could talk about how weird and cool this Stone is every single day and the thing is freaking HUGE in person. 

I particularly love the debate about whether or not it was mounted or if it was actually laid flat, because it’s certainly a modern perspective for the stone to have been vertically mounted. Some scholars believe that the stone was potentially laid flat and served* as a sacrificial stone altar. Another cool example of this to really back up this claim is the Coyolxauhqui Stone that was found at the base of the Templo Mayor which has a super cool backstory and was probably the Aztecs way of saying “f you” to a local neighboring state whose patron goddess was Coyolxauhqui (their name escapes me but I’m sure I can dig it up). 

I’ll stop myself because I get super excited when I see stuff pop up on civilizations of the Americas. Such a fascinating region."

Current students might be able to help you navigate what's the best schedule set up? If not current students, maybe the advisor for your specific graduate program might able to offer some sources on how to help?

AncientCivilizations,fnj0w3r,t1_fnilnf2,1586989877.0,"From an art historian perspective (hi!), I'd say we consider the Narmer Palette a piece of ""art"" because it showcases Egyptian iconographic symbols that are utilized throughout Egyptian art and/or architecture. We see certain signs - i.e. the king ""possessing""/conquering captives - and are able to see them as encoded with specific intentions/meanings.

There's a whole lot of methodology that I could get into here (Panofsky is a great staple in studying iconography & iconology), but the underlying point is that these visual images and motifs stand in as cues for particular interpretations. We see the king conquering these foes on the Palette, and its read as victory, power, etc. This stance on the Narmer Palette is one of our earliest examples that defined how Egyptian kingship was displayed and represented in Egypt. The Narmer Palette is a visual tool that communicates and reinforces that strength of the Egyptian king at having conquered and united both upper and lower Egypt; it's a powerful tool for succeeding pharaohs to use this same visual cue because it ties back to Narmer.

If you also compare the Narmer Palette to earlier art objects, this is a pivotal moment in visual representation where the king is no longer presented as a creature of nature, but must be transformed. Its unsatisfactory to view the king as a possessing qualities of an animal - the strength of a lion/ox, etc. We shift away from human-animal visual hybrids and see King Narmer (or Menes) as a human in order to start elevating the king as the divine manifestation upon the earth. Hence why if you look at the other side of the palette, you'll see motifs that are not very similar to the other. What the Narmer Palette does is show this development of visual cues and the defining motifs of Egyptian art. Narmer is presented as a human, not simply because he is human... but he is a powerful human, victorious and immensely impressive that he above all others - including enemies. So much so, he has dominated them and is elevated above them. Here is a point of departure in Egyptian art that leads to the development of the Egyptian pharaoh as the god-king.

This is kind of a shortened version of why the Narmer Palette is considered an ""art"" object. I hope this helps :)

ETA: I'm by no means an expert in Egyptian art, but I study ancient civilizations predominantly and Egyptian art was one of my first loves (thanks to my dad, who has been obsessed with Egypt since I was born) so I welcome anyone to critique and counter me since it isn't necessarily my area of expertise!"
UCSD,fnfgu36,t1_fnffik9,1586907784.0,"These TAs are students as well, I'd keep that in mind as well. They're under a tremendous amount of pressure and stressors as well; it is not simply undergrads who are suffering, but grad students as well. 

To counter that, these policies might not be up to them, they might be enforced by the professor. I haven't a clue. I cannot speak for them. 

You asked for an insight. I offered one. I feel that you only wish to rant and whine about the situation *which I get*. But don't get hostile or passive aggressive yourself when you wanted a possible explanation."
UCSD,fnfcu5l,t3_g1frsd,1586905643.0,"Well, speaking as an incoming grad (and future TA) as well as knowing some of your writing program TAs, I can try to offer some insight.

A lot of these TAs are PhD students who rely on these classes as getting their feet wet. That is, they TA these writing program classes because they typically pay more; however, they require much more effort from them (their OH often run longer than they allotted time for, they have to engage with students one-on-one more, etc.). I know a few TAs who really utilize the writing program classes as figuring out the most effective ways to teach, figuring out what doesn't work, and so on... because once you get to a certain point in your program, you have the option to teach classes at UCSD as a PhD student (some of your SS classes are taught by nervous PhD students who need these teaching gigs to put on their own CV because its the equivalent to having research & internship experience as an undergrad). 

It's a lot of time taken away from research and, based on what I've seen, it is a lot of work that they put into being writing program TAs.. Stipends are awarded based on how much you work, but often these TAs are working way above that amount. So yes, I can see why it bothers them. Especially when many undergrad students wait until the last minute and suddenly reach out for help. 

I would be super disappointed if I held discussions and participation as a TA and no one came. TAs are largely trying to do a bulk of the extra teaching outside of lecture, and I can imagine I would be bothered if students said ""fuck this, I don't care enough to utilize this resource."" Idk. Maybe I can be super sensitive, but a big reason why a lot of TAs are there is because they genuinely want to teach & need that experience."
UCSD,fncbiw5,t3_g0sq3d,1586832827.0,"I worked 25-40 hours per week while taking 4 classes a quarter and I will say that it is a struggle at times. I mainly worked so much because I had to pay bills and help send money back home to family, so I wouldnt recommend working more than 30 hours a week IF you want to enjoy a social life. I had none; the most socializing I did during my two years at UCSD was checking books out at Geisel and ordering coffee. 

Stick to a schedule and don’t let work interfere with class. I will 100% always say that school and anything to do with your academics comes first. I graduated with a high GPA but the quarter I took a basic chem class & calculus, along with two other major classes did knock me on my ass.

UCSD,fmwzmni,t3_fxoirp,1586455840.0,"I posted about this awhile back because I did two online classes winter quarter & worked full-time and I 100% sympathize with the productivity issue. 

I'm a morning person so after work or on weekdays off, I would section off a 2-4 hour block *just* for school-related stuff. Reading, watching/listening to lectures, answering posts & writing discussion stuff, etc. However, I wouldn't recommend working through the entirety of the chunk. Breaks are okay. So I would work for thirty minutes to an hour, then spend 5-10 minutes doing something dumb and unrelated to school. Whether it was just mess with my dogs, read a dumb ass gossip article, stare at Instagram, answer texts, etc. However, after that break I would immediately toss my phone on my bed and only reach for it if it was a phone call. 

I did section off certain days for certain things - so Monday would be ""let me make a schedule for today and just review what HAS to be done by this week and what days"" day. I have a dry-erase board over my desk that I write down due dates. I also have a bullet journal that I've utilized since I transferred to SD a few years ago where I would log all of my due-dates and write weekly schedules. I think that also helped me be productive, to have that creative outlet *but* still using it to keep my schoolwork in check. Hold yourself accountable but don't beat yourself up if you don't follow your routine 100%.

Online classes are a fuck ton of work and I've done it in CC & when I came to UCSD. It is NOT easy and I get the frustration. But my biggest piece of advice is to determine when you're the most ""productive"" - morning, afternoon, evening - and use that chunk for your classwork/school-related activities. You wouldn't let a physical lecture come in between you and study time at Geisel, right? Or studying so much that you forget to have hobbies? Don't let time seep into other time, if that makes sense. Allocate certain times for school, other time for extracurricular stuff. Building a routine isn't easy and it sucks ass. Good luck!"
