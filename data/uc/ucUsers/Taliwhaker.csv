berkeley,fp72iju,t1_fp6znu0,1588362860.0,">If you’re approaching a CS major who’s taken advanced data structures and you’re asking if they know what a queue is, that can very frequently be construed as condescending because it makes the implicit assumption that they are not competent.

I guess this is what I fundamentally disagree with. Especially if you replace ""what a queue is"" with a more relevant question like ""how queues can help with an algorithm you're asking me about"".

I'm saying this because your scenario is very extreme in the same way you don't see students in complex analysis get asked if they know what derivative is.

>that can very frequently be construed as condescending because it makes the implicit assumption that they are not competent

I once again don't see why I have to tiptoe around people's feelings if they reach out to me asking for a question. Especially for matters as simple as making sure you know enough to understand my explanation. I mean, no one's making fun of anyone, I'm just trying to find out what you know so that I can tailor my explanation, which *you* requested. I'm struggling to see why it's considered insensitive on my end, rather than oversensitive on their end. 

As a side thought, I guess it's the implicit notion of ""more knowledge makes you superior"" that I hate. When I ask a question to someone, I expect them to know more then I do about the subject. I'm basically admitting I know less than they do, so why should I get offended if they assume I don't know everything they do? What I'm trying to get to is: if knowing less about something wasn't seen as such a bad thing (less knowledge doesn't change your value as a person) then we would finally be able to learn without fear of ""feeling stupid"", or whatever that means."

It's the same with asking questions. If I'm about to have someone explain something, I absolutely don't mind being asked ""You know x, right?"" Or ""are you familiar with x before we start?""

I'm really not getting why I need to tiptoe with my words if the answer I'm looking for really is just a ""yes I know that"" or ""no I don't know that"""
