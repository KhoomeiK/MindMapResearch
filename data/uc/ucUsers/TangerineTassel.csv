sandiego,fphm8sc,t3_g7gf40,1588623760.0,"I made roasted potatoes for brunch today.  Took a pot of heavily salted water, a teaspoon of white vinegar, and 2 potatoes in cut into large pieces.  Once par boiled, I strained the potatoes and placed them back in the hot pot.  The heat from the pot continued evaporating additional moisture.

Using a fork I broke a few of the potatoes into smaller pieces, added diced green bell pepper, and diced green onion.  I tossed everything with butter flavored olive oil, pepper, rosemary, onion and garlic powder and roughed up the edges of the potatoes (this helped created texture as the surface crisps in the oven.)  

Oiled sheet tray and spread everything on it, put in a 450 degree oven, and baked until the potatoes were golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.

Turned out great!  (If I could figure out how to link a photo...)"
UCSD,fpasv1h,t3_gcaa40,1588455003.0,"I took summer sessions for two years.  I actually liked summer sessions better than regular quarters and took some of the harder classes then because it was condensed and you get it over with quickly.  The professor for my practicum said we were lucky to be taking it during the summer because although there was a lot of required reading, it was less than what was assigned in regular quarters."

family,fp1dq3u,t3_gamlfq,1588232117.0,"My (27M) son and only child and me (49/F), sole parent managed by planning a few things when he left for college.  After he moved in and we said goodbye, I picked my boyfriend up from the airport and we drove on Highway 1 from Monterey to Morrow Bay.  It was a good distraction, a lot to see but I also had to stay focused on winding single lane road on the cliffs the ocean.  

I was working full time and taking community college classes at the time so I enrolled in a class that required more work (required reading, homework, writing a lot of papers)/focus.  My schedule of working and going to school sustained his time in college.  When I transferred and college became more demanding, it helped to have to really only have to worry about myself for the most part because my son took over managing himself (welcome to adulthood!) 

Certain things took some adjusting, I wasn't used to coming home to a quite and dark house but I was able to start using the living space to study instead of being in my room.  I also discovered leisure cooking instead of the grocery shopping and meals involved with a household with a growing teen.  I learned how to shop and cook for 1.  Sometimes I'd eat cereal or toast for dinner. :)"

I love watching concert performances of Billie doing this song.  I always listened closely to the cutting in and out type of effect and wondered how it was done live.  I thought something was up but she simply moves the microphone to get the effect which is so simple but so cool that it makes it super dope to me."

UCSD,fnu0xgz,t3_g3r34v,1587252401.0,"I'd be shooting for a good education that is also as cost effective as possible with in state tuition.  Once you graduate loans are an expensive long term commitment in addition to other living expenses.  The 6 month forbearance period from the time you graduate and have to start paying your loans back goes quickly.  You may also want to go beyond undergrad which requires more of an investment you have to afford.  I'd use the $125k your parents are willing to provide and make the most of it.

My son stayed in state and was an 8 hour drive away.  He majored in CS, took out loans and I had parent plus loans.  When he was a sophomore, he lowered his housing costs for a a year by being a peer mentor (not RA). He also tutored on the side to make $. He graduated early in 2014 (which shaved off 2 quarters of tuition.)  He has worked in the Silicon Valley ever since for a major tech company.  He is paying back his loans, my parent plus loans, since married and has a child now.  His wife is finishing her accounting degree (more loans for now).  So it can be done, it just depends on how much of a financial burden you are willing to carry long term especially when you are just starting out.

For me, I did a lot of community college and transferred IGETC certified which significantly cut cost/time significantly before I was at UC San Diego (graduated 2018).  Several of the CC classes were online which gave me more flexibility and cost far less then a university.  You can also do cross campus enrollment (university and CC classes).  I'm currently paying my loans back (for the second time in my life) and don't have any other debt but it would be super helpful (especially right now with all of the uncertainty) to have lower expenses.  Currently I'm also paying for online professional development classes (forbearance doesn't apply so loan payments continue) to help further my career.

Best of luck to you!"
sandiego,fntx3tb,t1_fns3fdr,1587250270.0,Thank you for the update and checking.  It seems to be multiple nights.  It circles the hill south of Mt. Soledad around 1 am which seems odd.

UCSD,fng6g6n,t3_g1cx0w,1586923471.0,Living alone and staying in one location for activity is a challenge.  I'm normally good at keeping many things moving but this has been a curve ball to figure out.  This week I got a white board so I can keep running notes on what I'm working on and a basic check off list so I can be more engaged and pick up productivity.  Lack of structure/too much time can end up being too free and too open ended to get anything done.  I'm sure I'm not the only person who has binge watched a whole couple days away.  Time to snap outta it!  Good luck and here's to prospering friends!

UCSD,fmrcmya,t3_fwx3y8,1586319441.0,"I was a long term community college student and took several online classes before transferring.  A lot people assume online classes are easier but it is really the opposite.  Engaging and learning relies solely on your effort so if you aren't motivated or fully making it happen, you'll minimally accomplish learning. 

It helped me to use the syllabus to schedule your classes and classwork on a calendar that includes when work is assigned, work time for each assignment, due dates, time for required reading, lecture, studying for tests and taking tests.  The key to online learning is stepping up your own engagement and making all of those components happen instead of rolling up to listen to lecture and performing minimal effort to study the material.  

I also used to minimize distractions before starting so I'd set myself up in a comfortable spot with good light (standing desk in my dining room), get a drink and snacks, and stay off social media, texts, watching stuff online.  It sounds easy enough to say your going to do a little and turn it off, but once you've engaged it is like a rabbit hole.  Also, I figured out the worst time for me to do certain things like required reading at night after work.  I didn't retain anything and it almost guaranteed I'd fall asleep.  Since I worked full time on weekdays, I'd wake up early and read before getting ready for work.  Sometimes I'd read on my lunch hour or work on papers.  So if you know there's a time or circumstance in your situation that doesn't work for you, make adjustments now so you set yourself up to  succeed.

Best wishes to everyone having a good quarter!"
