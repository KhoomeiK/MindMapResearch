I found a friend‚Äôs keys on the lost and found page once! Currently looks a bit filled with housing?? But during the year it has been helpful"
berkeley,flq5hfp,t3_fq46hq,1585379910.0,"Cal had been my dream school, but when I got waitlisted, I SIR‚Äôd to UCLA and got super hyped  for a month. I had a friend I was gonna be roommates with, I was in love with their marching band, LA was somewhere new and different! I visited Cal again after I got off the waitlist, wandered into the Civil Engineering building, ended up chatting with a counselor, and many lovely students on the engineering competition teams. The final pull for me to choose Berkeley was the department itself, and the kind people within it.


Of course, there were other things I liked about Berkeley. I love the weather(temps in the 60‚Äôs alll the time) and the vibe of the Bay Area. It‚Äôs closer to my hometown than UCLA, I would have missed my mom :,( I like the campus itself, how it‚Äôs a little more spread out and the buildings are goofier looking than UCLA‚Äôs campus. Engineering at cal?? Like WOW. I talked to a few people I knew from both schools, and in general my own personality seemed to click with the kids I knew here better. 


Going to school here is hard, but I am so grateful to be a golden bear. I have met my lifelong friends, one pretty cute boy ;) , and so many passionate and driven individuals that have pushed me to be a better person.


For anyone trying to decide, take your time! Talk to people at each school, talk to your family, talk to your teachers, talk to your friends. You‚Äôll find your fit :)"
