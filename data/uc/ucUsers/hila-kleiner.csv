ucla,fpfox8s,t3_gd5q84,1588578261.0,Don't be sorry this hasn't been brought up yet and it is super important. Slates make sense but you shouldn't vote down the line just to. I didn't even know that some of these candidates are so unqualified so thanks for getting the word out!
ucla,fpfo9am,t1_fpfau5e,1588577605.0,"OP feel free to DM me your email; I took Econ 11 last quarter and would be more than happy to share my notes, old midterm, and final."
ucla,fpfnm1m,t1_fowspfh,1588576975.0,I talked to them recently and they said 8... What is the truth.
ucla,fpenr52,t1_fpel0sm,1588551120.0,How many hours a week? And so there's only just one midterm? How was that? Thanks!
ucla,fpeejk5,t1_fp6zn0p,1588545988.0,How's the class? Looks like it's only offered sometimes I guess.
ucla,fp8avbo,t3_gbyk37,1588387777.0,"I have Tomas now and he's pretty good, all his discussions are relevant and go over important problems. He sometimes goes too slow on the easy parts and then fast on others but it's all documented together at the end so you can look at it. He knows his stuff though so if you're ever confused OH works. The one thing I would advise is that if you are terribly shy or nervous then maybe don't take him because he's outgoing and sometimes calls on people (except never on anything hard so you can probably get the right answer easily). From what I can tell Yuta seems to be the lead TA since they are always in our Zoom lectures so I'd assume they're pretty good too. Good luck!"
ucla,fp09k43,t1_fowfj6h,1588205039.0,I know this sounds weird but in that case is 12 units cheaper than 8? I asked around before and someone told me that happened to them because they took 12 units one year and 8 the next so I'm not sure if that was because of a change in pricing or units. Thanks!

ucla,foweh6l,t1_fhwx7jd,1588118200.0,"I have blue and gold and barely qualify for the pell grant but the summer calculator estimated I'd have to pay 3000+ for 12 units. How did you pay 930? I would be totally willing to do that, but certainly not 3000+"
nintendo,fokomsk,t3_g7vuf0,1587846004.0,I just want to go to a pool party and play games with all my old high school pals
ucla,fo8xm7f,t1_fo79p06,1587605991.0,What jobs can you get with EPS SCI? I took an intro class that was super interesting but IDK about career options
internships,fnmrdjl,t3_g2n45d,1587076701.0,"Great advice! I am a freshman and desperate for an internship because even without COVID-19, employers are a lot less likely to take me. I have found SO many internship websites that are asking ME to pay thousands of dollars to get one. Even realized a LinkedIn connection MADE a site for this purpose in light of COVID-19. Ridiculous. If they are asking to be paid, they are getting free labor and don't care much for training you well experience-wise since they aren't investing in you to possibly come back and work full-time. They should be paying YOU."
slavelabour,fnk9y72,t3_g27yh6,1587019565.0,$bid any examples of real life people edits?
CPA,fkzeh55,t1_fkzdm9d,1584669100.0,Thank you! I was planning that due to the flexibility. Would it be ok for me to do that after I graduate undergrad?
