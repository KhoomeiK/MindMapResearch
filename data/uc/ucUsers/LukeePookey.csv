DSM,fp7scua,t1_fp7omkb,1588376789.0,"Oh shit my bad, I have a 2G that’s why. I’d still recommend going on car ID tho and putting in your specs. The best starter mods you can do without building your engine is gonna be an exhaust, intake, coilovers and retune."
DSM,fp7inl2,t3_gbdg8v,1588371338.0,"If you’re interested in doing forced induction on it Hahn race-craft sells a turbo manifold for the 420a! You’ll have to install a turbo online and buy your own turbo but it’s a start. Besides that you can go on car id and pick up a short ram air intake, a cat back exhaust and some coil overs. Those are the best starter mods for a beginner car. CarId makes it really easy you just put your make and model year in and it will show you compatible parts or specific parts."
simracing,foxh1gd,t1_foxgtke,1588143747.0,That’s not a bad idea! I might have to do the same.
simracing,fovyabk,t1_fotyw30,1588109652.0,What you can do is get the T300rs GT which come with the T3PA’s as does the T150 Pro. And because it’s bundled it will be a little cheaper.
simracing,foto34n,t1_foqpacg,1588060127.0,"Currently, a lot of the prices are inflated so you might need to wait for them to come down in the next few weeks, but the Thrustmaster T300 or even T150 are supposed to be great contenders to the G29. If you look up reviews you'll see that both end up have better FF and both are--to an extent--belt driven--which is a step up from the G29."
simracing,fotnxeh,t1_for021q,1588059974.0,"Pretty much everything atm is super inflated. It's a combination of lack of stock and increased demand. I feel the pain, I ended up paying $50 dollars more than a new wheel would typically be just for a G29 that was refurbished because I couldn't find any price lower than $300."

askmath,fnm3ldv,t1_fnk7o11,1587064496.0,Thanks for the resource it was pretty helpful. This integration by parts looks very similar to the u substitution we learned but I don't think it was the same. In any case it helped me with the integration! Turns out the question was asking for the derivative not the integration and that's why I got it wrong smh.

cars,fn4m8k0,t1_fn2ny2j,1586644285.0,"I've considered the E90 and 1 series but I don't really trust newer Bimmers :/ the Acura TL/TSX is the only FWD car I have liked throughout all my lists. I know there a lot of other great FWD sporty cars but the Acura is the only one that checks all my boxes. It is fun, reliable, good looking, and option packed! I just like the maturity of it over civics or celicas. That's a good point on the emissions aspect of the WRX. I'm really into outdoors activities like hiking and biking and roadtripping which is why I like the idea of the WRX. My biggest concern with the WRX is finding a car in my budget that hasn't been thrashed and modded to high hell :/ I think that I'm going to continue the hunt for the WRX but I'm leaning more towards the E46 in terms of cost effectiveness.

Edit: actually I didn't have any idea about the legacy GT! Looks like it's wayyy cheaper than a WRX and its got mo powah bebeh! Looks like this is the car. Thanks man!"
whatcarshouldIbuy,fn4lkdk,t1_fn3mvez,1586643879.0,"Yeah there's practically no corrosion for cars over here, even out close to the coast :D"
cars,fn2kwp5,t1_fn2klen,1586592823.0,Thanks for the pretty comprehensive list! I've had a lot of these cars on lists before but a lot of them just don't tick the practicality or ease of repair that I'm looking for. I'll do some searching around my area and see which of these I can find for an ok price tho!
whatcarshouldIbuy,fn2jozn,t1_fn2ivv9,1586591502.0,I really like the idea of high gas mileage on the Acura but the only thing preventing me from pulling the trigger is the fwd :/
cars,fn2htbt,t3_fvwxdw,1586589523.0,"Bay Area California 

Looking to spend max $6000

I’ve been torn between these three cars: WRX, E46/36, or an Acura TSX/TL

must be manual. 

I know this is a weird mashup of cars but here’s my reasoning. I want a practical yet sporty car that can be had for my budget and these are the three that I’ve found. Reliability is a factor to an extent which is why I have my doubts about the first two, but I am capable of doing my own work on the car so if the WRX and BMW are fairly easy to work on I have no problem with that. I like the idea of the bimmer for the AWD aspect, the WRX for the sheer fun and practicality(I’m an outdoors kinda person) and the Acura for sheer reliability and cost effectiveness."
buildapc,fn1tzsq,t1_fn1tqvo,1586570067.0,Damn. I finally decided to build a PC and now all the good monitors are too expensive :/
buildapc,fn1qtax,t1_fn1qn5z,1586567968.0,Awesome thanks! I was thinking the same thing for storage. I think what I’m going to do is wait till I need it because I can’t quite afford the 1 tb one rn and I have an external drive to tide me over.
buildapc,fmy0tsc,t3_fxrb2f,1586475741.0,Looking to build an AMD gaming PC and am looking at the Ryzen 5 3600. My question is if I should buy the 3600 now or wait until prices drop when the 4600 comes out?
