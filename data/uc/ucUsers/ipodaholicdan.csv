NintendoSwitch,fp4kkup,t1_fp4js6j,1588301093.0,">I've been having similar issues. I was playing Animal Crossing last night and put my Switch to sleep when it was on the home screen (after saving). When I powered the console back on today, I saw a white prompt asking if I wanted to update or if I wanted to open the program. I unplugged the console (after it had been charging all night) and chose to update the system. I walked away for a bit and came back a couple minutes later, but the screen was black and refused to turn back on. I've tried to reset by holding the power button for 15 seconds and pressing it once more but that hasn't worked. I also tried to reset the AC adapter and tried using a different wall outlet. Tech support from Nintendo pretty much told me to repeat the previous steps, and that I may need to send the console in for repair once their repair centers reopen.

>I am also unable to put it in Maintenance Mode and don't use any third party accessories. Since they offered to repair it for free despite it being outside of warranty, I have a feeling that it is already a known issue.

I posted this earlier so I'll just quote it here. I am unsure if any error codes were displayed since I stepped away from the device while it was updating, but I was only gone for about 2-3 minutes. By the time I came back the screen was off/black and has not turned on since then. 

The serial number is XAW10107209619 and the model number is MOD.HAC-001. The device was purchased in late March 2019 from Amazon."
NintendoSwitch,fp4j7wf,t1_fp3xw4b,1588300239.0,"Hey, would you mind verifying mine as well? I'm having a similar issue where mine stopped working after the update, and no 3rd party accessories have been used."
NintendoSwitch,fp4iivm,t1_fp4hiql,1588299807.0,Could I ask for some info regarding your system? I think it might be due to a faulty component that was fixed in later versions of the Switch. Mine was purchased in late March of 2019 from Amazon and is a V1.

NintendoSwitch,fp3wsmo,t1_fp3skp4,1588287267.0,Is it residue or is the joycon surface just worn down?
NintendoSwitch,fp3wnz2,t1_fp3t7r9,1588287197.0,Someone else responded in this thread [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/gatjzi/rnintendoswitchs_daily_question_thread_04302020/fp3tte5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Not for your specific controller but the electrical contact cleaner might help.
NintendoSwitch,fp3wf9i,t1_fp3uweh,1588287067.0,Yeah mine isn't a V2 either. Do you think that makes much of a difference?
NintendoSwitch,fp3volw,t1_fp3cllk,1588286673.0,This made me crack up lmao
NintendoSwitch,fp3tmwu,t1_fp3t5ye,1588285586.0,"I think it may depend on each specific unit. When I asked Nintendo Support, they asked for the date of purchase and the retailer it was purchased from. After I tried all troubleshooting tips,  they said it would be free to fix if I sent it in despite my unit being outside of the warranty period. They probably have an idea of what went wrong imo"
NintendoSwitch,fp3rctz,t1_fp3pkbx,1588284401.0,Hopefully. Has your son's Switch been functioning fine after the update?
NintendoSwitch,fp3pflb,t1_fp3oc8h,1588283418.0,Maaan. My village was just starting to pop off too. Thanks for the input
NintendoSwitch,fp3j03t,t1_fp3fw4l,1588280137.0,"Mine won't turn on at all, there definitely seems to be something wrong with the update. Nintendo said they'd be willing to repair it for free even though it is outside of the warranty period."
NintendoSwitch,fp3ivcj,t1_fp3i0ed,1588280072.0,"Mine just got bricked, you may want to hold off. Nintendo said I'll most likely have to send it in for repair (at no cost) once their repair centers reopen."
NintendoSwitch,fp3gr1t,t3_gatjzi,1588279020.0,"Has anyone else's Switch stopped working after the software update today? I was playing Animal Crossing last night and put my Switch to sleep when it was on the home screen (after saving).

Any tips or helpful suggestions that I may have not tried yet? Has anyone else had a similar issue with today's update?

Also wondering if this could be made into its own text post, I didn't see anything against it in the subreddit rules.

Edit: I am also unable to put it in Maintenance Mode by holding the (+) and (-) buttons and pressing the power button at the same time. I also do not use any third party accessories and almost always use my Switch in handheld mode."
