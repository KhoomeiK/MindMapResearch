Economics,fpmxqh8,t1_fpkn5ay,1588744474.0,I'm in grad school and so much of the badeconomics crowd. Head there if you want higher quality discussion.
Economics,fpmxhtv,t1_fpl9op3,1588744303.0,Land or gold are bad examples. Nothing appreciates for sure. A government bond doesn't really appreciate so much as you get the coupon over time and can sell it on the market for above what you paid (but this isn't guaranteed + assume no arbitrage etc.)
Economics,fpmx1hi,t1_fplok00,1588743977.0,"While what you are saying is accurate, regulation has made it harder to find small housing. There was a econ talk on this but you can't really get like a dorm at the Y anymore in big cities. Everything has a down payment/deposit etc. Housing is much improved but the bottom of the market has few options."
nba,fpmwexe,t1_fpmvcn3,1588743528.0,Probably money
nbadiscussion,fployh9,t1_fpldvb6,1588716713.0,"If I were Utah, I'd push that out to like 2023 or after Beal leaves. Washington's future doesn't exactly look amazing."
nbadiscussion,fplouoa,t1_fplhrjy,1588716656.0,You don't have to give him the supermax. I'm just saying your package is bad because the Wiz don't have good picks or players to trade. This team has 0 wings who can defend or competent bigs.
nbadiscussion,fpleyn3,t1_fpldt11,1588711509.0,"Bigs who can defend are still very valuable. Washington was apocalyptic on defense. Bigs lose value at the highest levels against the best teams. Washington is far from that stage and Bryant is not good enough to play versus a KD+Steph GSW either. 

I also believe Utah's postseasonissues have been on the offensive end where their wing players couldn't hit shots."
nbadiscussion,fpl3p6j,t1_fpkwqgy,1588705811.0,That's really bad. I'd ask for at least two picks or Rui. Bryant is a fringe starter who can't defend so he's worth little to a playoff team.
nba,fpl2t8w,t1_fpl19vl,1588705367.0,Too short of prime and no defense hurts.
nba,fpl2pxi,t1_fpl28mm,1588705320.0,Ginobili in his prime was better IMO even if he played fewer MPG. He was a better shooter.
nba,fpl2g4z,t1_fpl1kji,1588705186.0,"I agree at the time no one thought Johnson was better but it can also be true that Johnson had a larger offensive impact. Simmons list is overall pretty awful and I trust people like Ben Taylor about 50 times more. Simmons is all about narrative and not on court impact.

Johnson had like no longevity and injury issues but was an elite level offensive engine in his prime which is why I give credit. Thomas is IMO overrated offensively because he gets title credit for those Pistons teams which were mediocre offensively. People overrate titles and give credit for ""best player on a title team"" which is lazy."
nba,fpl1qp8,t1_fpksqts,1588704837.0,Johnson also had a better TS% relative to the league than DeRozan does now. Efficiency is up
nba,fpl14d2,t3_ge3c64,1588704530.0,Ginobili > Parker pretty easily imo. Both have cases but Manu was All NBA offensive impact playing off the bench. I'm surprised he is still underrated.
nba,fpl0sue,t1_fpl0d8g,1588704372.0,It's possible people could have been wrong in 1990. We can statistically argue Johnson had a larger offensive impact. Maybe people didn't realize it at the time or Johnson/Thomas didn't know how to optimize the offense like we do today but we can infer impact. Thomas' best offensive seasons came before the titles.
nba,fpkzok8,t1_fpkp65k,1588703815.0,Kevin Johnson was a better offensive player and had worse teammates pre Barkley. Thomas was not efficient.
nba,fpj6lmc,t1_fpj3uuc,1588658112.0,"The ""remembered with X team"" makes it subjective. If a player played on team X, the team should get credit for how good he was while on the team. This prevents janky stuff like Hakeem on Toronto."
nba,fpj3hxg,t1_fpj3dpj,1588655549.0,"Magic/Kobe/Baylor/LeBron/Kareem with Shaq, Jerry West, AD and Wilt off the bench? Nah fam."
stunfisk,fpj35lw,t3_gdq3mf,1588655284.0,"I got into the game in 2007 by watching a ton of YouTube videos. Thankfully for you, it's even easier to learn now with channels like WolfeyVGC and PokeaimMD who produce tons of long and high quality videos. Read Smogon articles, join Discords, etc. It will seem overwelming at first but grab a sample team from the forums or steal an RMT and try it out! 

Playing on cart legit is a lot more difficult but most serious players test their teams on Showdown anyway."
nbadiscussion,fpi7vly,t1_fpi2i91,1588635428.0,You are seriously underrating Dirk. He was the best offensive player in the league along with Nash in his prime. He was insanely efficient and helped with spacing. Reggie Miller should also be considered.
UCSD,fpi74wl,t1_fpi6ous,1588635001.0,Point is school has 10s of millions of dollars at stake to keep dorms open. I anticipate a hybrid option at least at first.

nbadiscussion,fp8kxay,t3_gbsvau,1588395048.0,"This team also needs a coach. It sounds like Durant wants a former player coach who gets along with elite players like Kidd or Lue (ehhh) but that will determine a lot in terms of scheme etc. I think LeVert is most likely to get traded given contract, injury history and his poor fit next to KD and Kyrie. I think Jrue is a good target but they really need a wing stopper. Prince can't be your best wing defender and KD isn't guarding the best players one year after Achilles injury at his age"
UCSD,fp766tp,t1_fp37yk4,1588364780.0,"Grad student here. I think they are trying to mitigate the number of emails we get from students who are on grader borderlines from submitting appeals and complaints. If you are gonna do bad and you do P/NP instead, you really can't bitch about the percentages or points if you still Pass. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This is cynical but like I say, TAs and professors treat grading like a third priority honestly. College is weird and there are mismatched incentives."

UCSD,fp1dfad,t1_fp1bxwj,1588231836.0,"Again, if we suspected a lot of students cheated on an assignment, it's a lot easier on our end to just report the whole cadre of students who we think cheated than to the investigation ourselves. I would suspect--and don't quote me on this--this is what the school wants to do as well. The people in the AI office are trained to do this thing and people like me just grade assignments and exams as a more-or-less side job.  


Only the AI office knows what percentage of student reported there have actual negative repercussions, etc. There is also an appeals process afaik and the cheating I've suspected or seen here at UCSD has been blatant. It's a lot more innocuous to Google a homework question especially when the problem is incredibly common and easy e.g. ""prove the polynomials of degree 2 form a vector space under these defined operations"" but don't like publish your homework code on a public Google Drive or copy exam answers from Chegg on a take home. I'd advise being extra careful to avoid online sources on a take home. Better be safe than sorry IMO."

nba,fp19jqv,t1_fp0xfr1,1588228370.0,His defensive system with switching masks his flaws more than a traditional set up would. He's basically like a 4 on defense which is okay but he's not really going through screens or whatever.

UCSD,fp16lac,t3_gaoxa8,1588225847.0,"Grad student here. It's basically the only recourse they are allowed and encouraged to use. I think undergrads overrate how much time professors can and will devote to undergrad teaching and especially grading.

Like in my Dept, TAs and Readers do all undergrad grading and if we assume academic integrity violation took place, it takes time to report to the office of AI and have them handle it. That's their job and we are often overworked and prefer our time be spent on research. No professor or TA wants to give a student a violation because doing so actually takes extra time. We aren't dumb and know cheating is happening. Don't be an idiot about it and get exam answers from Chegg or share code smdh."
badeconomics,fox7ep2,t1_fouq8q3,1588135937.0,"Not sure I agree. I think looking at year over year GDP growth or unemployment rate is a better one number view of the macro economy. Of course, these are all incredibly blunt instruments that suffer from heterogeneity effects and measurement issues."
