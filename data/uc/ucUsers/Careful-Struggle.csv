UCDavis,fpbieth,t3_gc2f3d,1588470728.0,The units will transfer over but don't expect to get language credit for it.
UCDavis,fp8aygi,t3_gasd8v,1588387837.0,Enroll at the CC then tag to UCD. Tag guarantees your enrollment to any of the UCs except Berkeley and LA (for obv. reasons).
UCDavis,fonxwo2,t3_g84sxq,1587928641.0,"Can't relate, I'm absolutely killing it. It's my most intensive quarter I've ever taken at UCD (20 units), and I'm virtually stress-free. Guess that's one advantage of being a transfer student who took online classes for the past three years :P."
UCDavis,fonwzou,t3_g7ttjk,1587928123.0,"Former transfer student, I chose UCD over UCLA as I didn't want to be that far from home-- bay area native. UCLA gave me a tuition-free financial package, UCD only covered about 75% tuition-- take that as you may. I would have taken any offer from UCB tho."
UCDavis,fonw47v,t3_g8hxlp,1587927628.0,"Super easy, poli sci that is."
UCDavis,fo29svd,t1_fo29db3,1587454433.0,You should be fine. All that is going to happen is that they will not count whatever classes/units that go over that 105 unit mark.
UCDavis,fo29llm,t3_g4ziqb,1587454231.0,"Would hate to spend my last quarter, really my last 2 quarters (spring and fall), at UCD doing online classes."
UCDavis,fo29eoi,t3_g3xj8f,1587454040.0,"Transfer student here. The classes are pretty manageable, class averages are about B/B+ Workload depends on whose teaching, generally just a midterm, paper, and a final. Professors are ok, Adams, Engstrom, J. Andrews are my personal favorites. Can't really speak on internships, not my cup of tea."
UCDavis,fo293wm,t3_g4ntgy,1587453742.0,"The maximum units allowed for transfer are 105 quarter units. To convert semester to quarters, use a 1.5 multiplier, e.g 60 S units x 1.5= 90 Q units."
UCDavis,fo25zkb,t3_g3bz26,1587450813.0,"Take it from me, I transferred this fall from a CCC and also commuted for the FQ, do not take more than 3 classes as it will really wear you down. I commuted from San Jose, CA, about a 240 mile round trip, to Davis every T and R and it really did a number on me and my lower back. Scheduling your classes takes some careful maneuvering, e.g. making sure midterms occur on the days you commute, finals, etc. Do not expect to get goods as you will lose a lot of time commuting back and forth; if you don’t think it will mentally fatigue you, it will trust me on that. One last thing, if you plan on working, don’t work a lot. I worked about 32-40 hrs a week and it wasn’t worth it, prioritize your school work."
