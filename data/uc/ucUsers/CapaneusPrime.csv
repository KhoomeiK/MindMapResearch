I am a Stats PhD student who TA's a lot of intro R classes as well as other upper-division Stats classes which use R.

*If* you are using Base R with no packages, you are 100% correct, it won't matter.

Going beyond that, if you just want to *use* R, I've experienced far fewer problems with Windows users.

On OSX, if you're not on the most current version, you may not be able to easily install the current version of R. If you can't install the most current version of R, you might not be able to use up-to-date packages. I have this issue every quarter with students on older versions of OSX. Also, since OSX, by default, installs packages from source, I've had to help students with xcode issues. That's not to say OSX is *bad*, it's fantastic, it's just I've had easily 20x the problems with new users on OSX.

Of course, all of these issues are easily solved once you know how to solve them, but people new to the language will, on average, struggle more on Mac than on PC.

If you're a ""power"" user, especially if you need to do anything system related, you'll want to be on some flavor of Linux. I use the system grep command a lot in some of the utilities I've written for grading, and well, both Windows and OSX are very bad and should feel bad. Every version of grep on Windows is fundamentally broken in some way (at least if you want to use Perl style regex), and OSX uses BSD grep which is just terrible.

You'll also need to be running Linux is you want to run your own Shiny Server.

Then there's differences in how Windows, OSX, and Linux handle things in the file structure, think whitespace and special characters in file paths, or even worse--user names... Pro-tip: don't.

There's also the fact Windows users the backslash in paths which is just wrong... And Linux is the only one where file paths are case-sensitive.

There are *so many* minor, niggling, differences in how R works on the three major platforms I can't even remember them all...

Hell... While writing that sentence I thought of two more. RStudio on Windows is a million times better for being able have multiple versions of R installed and to quickly switch between them, and R on Windows gives a different answers for `1 %/% 2` then you'll get on OSX or Linux...

But, in the end, a person will become comfortable on whatever system they choose and it ultimately won't matter because most people will forever remain blissfully unaware of the various quirks each implementation suffers under."

I wasn't awake at the time (it was set to happen every morning at 7:30) so I never saw it, but I'd show her the thermostat schedule every time she would complain about it... I was convinced she was doing it herself half-asleep.

So, the other day she brought it up again and I didn't believe her again... So, you know, fight time... And I'm like fine, let me install IFTTT so I can set an alert to inform me when the thermostat changes and there I see it...

Ages ago I'd set IFTTT to raise the temperature in the morning for her then lower it back for me because she was getting up before me and I usually work from home. But, the last couple of months I convinced her to keep the thermostat lower at 68 overnight and our schedules changed a bit, so the heater running for 30 minutes in the morning was driving her nuts.

Coming clean was so painful...

tl;dr: I accidently gaslit my poor, innocent, lovely wife with IFTTT."

ucla,fncbm8x,t1_fnbp6v6,1586832887.0,"Well... I didn't see anything suggesting they're going 10 minutes past. It \_might\_ happen, but I'd be really surprised if it were anything more than a rare, one-off thing if it has. I've personally never experienced it myself as a student. I did have a professor who routinely went over by a few minutes when I had another class 10 minutes later at the complete opposite end of campus. I would be pushing it to get to my next class on time if I left at :50, so I just made a judgment call, when it happened, to stay for the end or try to make it to the beginning. I don't see why students in a virtual class can't do the same, especially since it's so much easier to do.

I mean... you paid for 50 minutes and you're getting more, take the win!"
ucla,fnblo1g,t1_fnbgezv,1586817746.0,"Well...

It's *very* easy to go over without it being a pacing issue.

If students ask questions, especially off topic questions, or if you notice the students don't seem to be getting a point you may go further into it than you planned. You might even think of something in the moment which could be helpful to their understanding.

It's also very possible they aren't keeping a close eye on the clock.

The switch to online instruction might also be throwing people off.

Myself, I've found my discussion pacing out of whack now that I'm doing everything online. I am usually fairly active, moving around the room, trying to keep it dynamic with a higher energy level. I am finding that difficult to do sitting in my chair at home, looking at a camera.

So, while it was definitely a problem for some professors (and TA's, guilty) before, the move to online education it's almost certainly exacerbating it.

You should try to be as understanding as possible as we're all navigating these uncharted waters together."
