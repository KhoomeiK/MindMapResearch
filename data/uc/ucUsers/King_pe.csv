UCSC,fphdseh,t1_fpglix4,1588619486.0,I'm worried cause I already took spring quarter off. On top of that I'm out of state so if things are online I'm paying an extra 30k for classes in a different time zone. But if I take another quarter off that means pushing my degree back even farther. God damn does this suck

UCSC,fnegt4n,t3_g1abcb,1586889107.0,If your interested in data modeling and machine learning I'd check out R. It's used for a lot of statistical analysis and do a lot of similar things to python in the department of AI from what I've heard

DrugNerds,fn5dgdc,t1_fn5crrv,1586662002.0,"Im just trying to be optimistic dude you don't have to be condescending about it. I'm not here to fight about technicalities of one scientific discovery or another. Im just trying to say that we have discovered more in the last hundred years as a human race than in the couple thousand and I don't see that trend slowing down. 

Ya the hard problem of consciousness is ""hard"" but so is general relativity. Maybe I'm just being hopelessly optimistic but hard problems get solved eventually by smart people. Just give it time"
DrugNerds,fn5c4ya,t1_fn5abga,1586661051.0,"I'm not 100% sure what that first half means cause of the jargon but I think I get what you're saying and I guess I'm saying they're all one big tangled system. Maybe we will never totally understand it but I think the reemergence of psychedelic research in tandem with all the other advances in modern neuroscience are gonna make that gulf a lot smaller. 

Or maybe it's just gonna keep widening in front of us and it wont be for 100s of years that it ever starts to close. But I do think that one day we will make that leap. Sure we couldnt imagine now what that might look like but a mere 100 years ago we hadnt even started to imagine that we would be taking a glimpse at the smallest particles in the universe or even imagining that the brain was driven by chemical processes."
DrugNerds,fn4p2ev,t1_fn4o7uz,1586645921.0,I think the big thing we are going to learn is that deep down there isnt a difference. The pharmacological effects cause psychological effects and vice versa. The real future is understanding how deeply they connect and are ultimately the same thing
DrugNerds,fmr7i8c,t1_fmkjmvt,1586315708.0,2c-b is kinda selective for 5-ht2c. Dont think its gonna be a reliable treatment for depression however
DrugNerds,flmmjz1,t1_flml40i,1585288349.0,"I'm confused. Were not talking in theoretical terms here. S isomer ketamine has been thoroughly researched for its use as an anti-depressant. And although r iso ketamine has shown to be more potent of an antidepressant this has been exclusively in mouse studies. Potency isnt just a piece of common language but used to describe the pharmacology of a drug all the time. Just look at all the times shulgin discribed one compound or another as X times more potent than mescaline. 

Sure potency doesnt have a well defined meaning at a receptor level but it's not hard to intuit. Something with more potency will have a higher affinity for that particular receptor. It's not exactly linear but I dont know of a case where a drug requiring a lower dose wont have a higher affinity for the receptor causing that action."
