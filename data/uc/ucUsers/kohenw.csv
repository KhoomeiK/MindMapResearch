berkeley,fotcghn,t3_g9avi4,1588050005.0,"Thank you for sharing this.

Honestly I feel really ashamed after reading it! I was never able to study the way I wanted to and I hope I had spent more time studying.

Well, I guess I can still study harder since I am still in (grad) school. Sigh."
BingeEatingDisorder,fohnm9b,t1_fohbh8n,1587769058.0,"Thank you for understanding! I think that most providers are so burned out that they are not always willing to learn about new therapeutic methods or research. Vv definitely has an off-label proven therapeutic effect for BED and it is unfortunate that they are unwilling to consider it. Anyways, good luck! Hope you find someone caring and knowledgeable."
BingeEatingDisorder,foenqo9,t3_g6xmwx,1587708883.0,"I don’t mean to come across as insensitive or invalidating here, but perhaps the NP’s reluctance comes from vyvanse being a stimulant and any patient asking for a stimulant prescription could be viewed as alarming.

Prozac worked for my BED a while ago-but it may not be the case for others, as the roots of my BED lie in depression and anxiety.

Anyways, sorry to hear about your experience-hope you find a caring physician who understands ED."
