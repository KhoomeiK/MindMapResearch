ucsccola,fmo7odu,t3_fw81nq,1586248464.0,"Why is this even a thing like if it’s that bad dip for good or for a quarter, ya tuition fucking sucks but I’m still paying for the professors time, I know that’s not where most of my tuition goes but still. 

I hate that they’re trying to continue this cola strike (albeit in more subtler ways)"
UCSC,fmmrxdc,t3_fw4dnb,1586210914.0,This is dope
ucsccola,fmmqf5c,t3_fw5lgk,1586210104.0,No surprise there
ucsccola,flzuwb4,t3_fs4j06,1585634329.0,Do they actually think an online strike is going to work? Online no one gives a shit and they don’t even have to show their face about not caring.
