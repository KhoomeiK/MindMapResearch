speedreading,fpn66fi,t1_fpn3sxf,1588751607.0,Yes I’ve heard that’s a good book. The only issue is that it’s hard to buy books at this time so I’m trying to opt for something you can get online instead.
AskReddit,fpdu7zq,t3_gcna0k,1588534330.0,"I think old me just really lacked confidence, largely because I hadn’t done anything to make me feel good about myself. Today’s me isn’t a world renowned scientist or a professional soccer player, but I have hobbies and strengths that I’m proud of and that has manifested into more confidence. After I perform in a play, I feel like a million bucks and it’s a lot easier for me to approach and meet women. **TLDR: I feel like my previous self just hadn’t gotten out of his shell.**"

ADHD,fp8871p,t1_fp4xcdp,1588385955.0,"Hey! I'm also going through something similar to OP's dilemma. If you're open to sharing, can you say (1) how therapy sessions usually went, (2) which symptoms you developed coping strategies for, (3) how long it took before you had effectively developed coping strategies for your day-to-day use?"
speedreading,fp6qiww,t3_g3g2dr,1588356851.0,"This is a good idea. I will certainly give it a try. Counting words sounds fun, and since you don’t want to actually subvocalize, a little music while you count can’t distract you."
mentalhealth,folnzof,t3_g7zq6x,1587866440.0,You make us all proud. Great job!

Instagram,fo0f12c,t1_fnzpfg3,1587411938.0,Yes that makes sense. Thank you

Showerthoughts,fnyfmuz,t3_g4d0ij,1587361660.0,I can tolerate my voice 100% but it’s hard for me to look at myself in videos
socialskills,fnq0372,t1_fnpxojg,1587155153.0,"> When you have the urge to dampen someone’s fun, identify the feeling and quash it before you say or act in a way that is negative.

That's good advice. I'll always be on the lookout for that feeling and I'll try to quash it when it happens.

Thank you!"
UCSD,fnpyvmy,t1_fnnwa54,1587154516.0,Haha!! I thought I was the only person who did that!!! You’re talking about the black mirrors on the glass wall when you’re walking into the entrance right?
Blogging,fnmsic9,t1_fnmgklb,1587077316.0,"Charli D’Amelio, your secret Reddit account has just been exposed! ;)

Haha in all seriousness, thanks for that advice! Tiktok might be a lot better than Instagram is for my purposes. I have no idea how tiktok works but I certainly will look into it with all the time I have. Thank you so much!"
Blogging,fnl3dd1,t1_fnkc6mg,1587046166.0,So you mean look for other users who use similar hashtags and connect with them through that?
Blogging,fnjq0vt,t1_fnjo7is,1587004345.0,Good idea
driving,fnien9c,t1_fni4g3s,1586978701.0,That’s a really interesting idea!! I am going to try it. Is there a YouTube video or something you’d recommend that explains it in detail?
UCSD,fna2nlm,t3_g0ddl3,1586789846.0,"Nope, never have. It shouldn't be awkward though. Just say ""Hello Professor!"" and they'll say ""hi"" back to you, no different from seeing your professors around campus."
AmItheAsshole,fmydrhm,t1_fmxovef,1586483795.0,"Yes this was in the United States too. He calls everyone else by their first name except for me, which is why it's so awkward."
AmItheAsshole,fmx8hr1,t1_fmwvzhn,1586460384.0,You're right. I'm just being petty.
AmItheAsshole,fmwwfwl,t1_fmww7pp,1586454237.0,"That’s not really an option for me. He does if when I ask a question. He’ll say “Good question, [my last name]” before proceeding to answer it."
