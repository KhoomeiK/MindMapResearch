ucla,fpezvo0,t1_fpey4ug,1588558572.0,"Yeah, I'm totally down! We can start our own UCLA VTC lol."
ucla,fpezue0,t1_fpex8j6,1588558550.0,"Oh shit, I did the exact opposite. I was born and raised in New York (about 1.5 hrs north of NYC) and moved to Orange County a few years back, then ended up in Westwood last summer for grad school.

I've only been down Mulholland Drive, but would love some recommendations."
ucla,fpevmrk,t1_fpessve,1588555921.0,"Thank you! Driving is my absolute favorite pass time. The hardest part about moving to Westwood for me was not having to drive anymore.

I just looked Unitrans up. They have double decker buses...WHAT. Definitely chose the wrong grad school."
ucla,fpev7ut,t1_fpetubb,1588555659.0,"Would you rather have an unpaid internship?!?

Good catch on the typo though. Whoops. I'm such a dumbass."
ucla,fpeokk3,t1_fpenx5g,1588551617.0,Your wish is my command! I'll see if I can get a run to LA tonight. Currently docked in Mormon-land.

ucla,fpek661,t1_fpej9km,1588549119.0,"Lol go for it, as long as you credit me. I'll pray I don't get a C&D letter from UCLA."
ucla,fpek3pl,t1_fpej6xq,1588549081.0,"That would be my dream, you have no fucking idea. I've thought about enrolling myself into CDL school as a graduation present to myself."
trucksim,fpaucjd,t3_gcel5a,1588455882.0,Mods seen here are: Filmic Lighting and Project Next-Gen USA. Skin is a current WIP.

trucksim,foz20on,t3_gae5ks,1588183324.0,This is a fictional UCLA-themed skin I'm working on. Might be a while before release since I'm working on this in-between exams and papers. Other mods seen here are: Filmic Lighting and Project Next-Gen USA.
trucksim,foz1ier,t1_foxpwl8,1588183070.0,Glad you like them! They wouldn't be possible without your hard work ðŸ˜€

ucla,fow7r23,t1_fovszsy,1588114574.0,On-ramp to off-ramp is already being done on a small scale. The real challenge is the last mile.
ucla,fovduxa,t1_fovb5nc,1588099665.0,"Yeah, working for the retail side of Walmart absolutely sucks, but Walmart Transportation is one of the top trucking companies to work for. Hard to sign on with them though. You need years of experience with a spotless driving record to even have a chance. Otherwise, you're stuck working for Swift (See What I Fucked-up Today/Sure Wish I Finished Training)."
ucla,fov6u0m,t1_fov2oen,1588096328.0,"It unfortunately does not. It's something I made in American Truck Simulator. I wish it did though, it's always been my dream to drive a truck."
trucksim,fossc8f,t1_fooaiib,1588037036.0,I am! Somewhat. Quarantine and lack of motivation for coursework has brought me back.
trucksim,foss8ta,t1_foooxmx,1588036982.0,"Thank you! I have thought about it, but I just can't get into Euro trucks (no offense). I've only loaded up ETS2 a handful of times since ATS came out."
trucksim,fonp4go,t3_g8ix53,1587923735.0,"Finally got around to making a version for overfloater's K100E...9 months later. I just uploaded it to the Steam Workshop, so if you're already subscribed to [the skin](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1553747903), you're good to go.

trucksim,fokyqdh,t1_fokwfgc,1587851498.0,"The most jarring issue was that the stripes on the back of the truck didn't line up anymore. I fixed that last night thinking that was it. But then I noticed that there are some alignment issues throughout the whole skin. Nothing game breaking by any means, but just looks sloppy, so I'm working on fixing that up."
trucksim,fokrhrz,t3_g7vqi8,1587847550.0,"Hey, glad you're enjoying the skin. I'm in the process of updating the K100E liveries to the new version. Sorry it's been taking so long, grad school has been keeping me busy."
ucla,fnp5hnn,t1_fnnwhh0,1587139564.0,Do you know if that applies to grad students as well? How do you find out? This would take a huge amount of stress off as I cram for my peds exam.
ucla,fngkmbp,t3_g1kqt5,1586935261.0,"Fuck me in the ass if that happens, god damn. On the bright side though, Dr. Fauci said last week said that there was a decent enough chance that schools could [re-open in the fall in some form or another.](https://www.10news.com/news/coronavirus/will-schools-remain-closed-in-the-fall-dr-fauci-thinks-schools-can-reopen-this-fall)

Although Gov. Newsom has banned mass gatherings in the foreseeable future, he has mentioned [staggered schedules for schools](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/14/us/14reuters-health-coronavirus-california-gatherings.html) once the Stay-At-Home orders relax a little bit, but he understandably didn't give a timeline.

I know they're mostly talking about primary/secondary schools, but I can't imagine colleges being far behind. Gotta try to stay positive somehow."
ucla,fmz8eiq,t3_fyax3m,1586510471.0,"WHAT NO. I guess knock off donuts from Ralph's will have to do.

On the bright side, maybe I can fit into my favorite pair of pants again."
ucla,fl008ln,t3_flpe10,1584686368.0,"Yes, please. 

I'm a registered nurse. Tomorrow will be my first day back at work since Covid 19 took over California. I don't think many people truly realize how taxed our healthcare system is on a good day. Although I'm lucky to be working at one of the top hospitals in CA, I've been at facilities where it was difficult to find basic working equipment and supplies on a regular basis. Staffing is also bare minimum at many hospitals around the country. At my previous facility, it was not uncommon to have an RN be responsible for 7-8 patients with CNAs having 24+. Emergency room RNs in NYC regularly care for 11+ patients, including critical care holds, which is absolutely insane. Throw in a pandemic and we're absolutely fucked.

Because of ""budgeting,"" hospitals don't like having extra supplies. So, when something like this happens, you see staff having to reuse single-use face masks and N95s, if they even have them. Some facilities are even telling their staff to not fully gown-up for other patients that require contact isolation in order to ""conserve supplies."" 

It's a fucking shitshow out there. [This](https://assets.change.org/photos/9/lg/de/EnLgdevIxVJYdMK-800x450-noPad.jpg?1584504087) picture should sum it up.

Stay home. Wash your hands. Social distancing. Stop hording masks and save them for the professionals/patients that actually need them."
