cscareerquestions,fkwoyl7,t3_fkz06r,1584599836.0,"I landed my first internship by attending my campus information sessions. They’re super helpful to get your resume in and helps recruiters put a face to your name. Asked for a business card and emailed with a follow up and then got offered an interview. 

My GPA was average. 

Advice to my younger self is to go out to more networking events. It helps build your confidence and practice your networking skills because it goes a long way. 

Good luck :)"
