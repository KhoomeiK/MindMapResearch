NewSkaters,fpmkp75,t1_fpmkijc,1588735215.0,It came out to around $180. It’s a Santa Cruz VX deck which is a pro model so that was $75 itself and the trucks are indys so they were $50 and the wheels $25 and it just adds up. But it should last me a while

NoStupidQuestions,fnodidu,t1_fnoddry,1587121449.0,"Thanks for the answer! It’s just confusing because it seems totally stupid to make them different, but then it’s like the advertising makes it seem like we’re supposed to think they’re different, but then you think it’s just satire, but then again, what if it’s not."
AskReddit,fngu5g0,t3_g1nwuv,1586945060.0,"I worked at a grocery store one summer, and even though my tasks weren’t exactly hard (bagging groceries, cleaning floors, bringing carts in etc.) by the end of an 8 hour shift I would be exhausted. Most of my grocery shopping however, was done after my shifts, because I didn’t want to come back there on my days off. Anyway, after one of my shifts, I took off my apron and tie and put them over my shoulder and went to go grab a couple things before I went home. Well I already had a couple items in my hands when a lady came up and told me that something was out of stock and she then asked if I could check for more in the back. I politely told her that I was not currently working but I could ask another employee to check for her. She responded clearly upset asking me to PLEASE check for her because she was in a hurry and asking someone else would take too much time. I just straight up told her no and that I was just another customer like her at that point. She did not like that answer and decided to tell the entire store that she would she would shop exclusively at the other grocery store in town because “their employees actually care about serving their customers.” Good for her."

NewSkaters,fmhm8m3,t3_fv5866,1586085985.0,You’re sliding your front foot up the board enough but you also need to slide it out. That is how you level out the board. You slide up and then out in front of you.
