RenewableEnergy,fp5jdno,t1_fp5h16i,1588331489.0,"no worries, English isn't my native language either ^^

That's fair, I am just personally not convinced that photovoltaic power generation can effectively replace our current grid and I would argue are a step down from nuclear (a step up from fossil fuels though, definitely). The issues of land use and resource use, most of which are imported from abroad, do not justify the relatively low amount of power yielded from solar. In my opinion the same applies to wind. I appreciate our conversation though!"
Physics,fp5ho6t,t3_gbdzmn,1588329759.0,That looks sick!
RenewableEnergy,fp5fp41,t1_fp53ad1,1588327669.0,"semiconductors and conductors are indeed ""recyclable"", but doing do requires specialized plants that tend to be pretty expensive, plants that the US also doesn't have at the moment. electronic waste is a huge problem and one that will get orders of magnitude bigger with solar and to a lesser degree wind. I highly doubt more than 96% of PV cells would actually be recycled. That's like saying plastic is 96% recyclable. It may be but we sure as hell don't do it and that's a big problem. 

Moreover, what about the short lifetime of these plants. how can we really say PV is the future when it lasts a couple of decades? In what world is that sustainable?

And on uranium enriching being extremely energy costly, could you show me a source or go more into detail? I doubt it takes 6-14 gigawatts of power to enrich uranium to several percents higher, especially nowadays that we don't use cold war methods anymore."
RenewableEnergy,fp3zg5g,t3_g7riw1,1588288715.0,"I just went through all the comments here and couldn't find a single person answering what I think is the most important 2 points in the documentary. IMO those are the fact that photovoltaics and wind power installations have a life time of a couple of decades before needing to be replaced and managed (managing the waste that is), and the other being the materials required to build these systems themselves require extremely high energy processes which we can't do in a sustainable fashion as of now. Can someone please tell me why this isn't a big deal? 

If we get to 100% solar and, yay! but what do we do in 20 years when we have more waste than nuclear has ever generated and a faulty power grid?

I honestly want environmentalists to be right about supporting PV and wind but I just can't see it for those reasons and a few other lesser reasons.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk"

berkeley,fo2yz8n,t3_g5bt0f,1587477274.0,Anyone else in Europe? I go to sleep at 4am wake up at 8am and go back to sleep at 10am till 12pm. Hurrray
nuclear,fo1e8tg,t1_fo1ce6s,1587431388.0,I appreciate the effort but I think I'll pass ^^' it's getting pretty late here in France XD

nuclear,fo12pij,t3_g4yk95,1587424554.0,i don't do econ... is that good for the nuclear industry? sounds like uranium is just more expensive
EngineeringStudents,fk5rqix,t3_fgja0x,1583886595.0,"Im in a california school, and tbh I don't mind all that much. Sure lab and research will be a hassle, but I think it'll be a lot more chill and I could use a breather"
