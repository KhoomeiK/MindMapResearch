ucr,fplpsjw,t3_ge5qp7,1588717159.0,"About a week and a half iirc. If you’re receiving admin leave still, don’t forget to report that as income. Right now they’re sending your normal benefits, plus $600 per week. Feel free to DM with any questions along the way"

ucr,fp7l2un,t3_gbpp1n,1588372654.0,"So many students, including myself are feeling this way. Over at r/college every other post is like this. I’ll share what’s been working for me. Really try to get into a routine. I know it’s tough, but waking up at a somewhat set time and doing a series of small tasks you accomplish (even as simple as brushing teeth or making the bed) helps to set the tone for the day. Exercise has also helped me tremendously to break out out of the sluggish feeling you get by sitting around most of the day. Maybe try posting over at r/getmotivated ? They probably can help you out too. Try not to be too hard on yourself, and if you feel the need to talk feel free to message."

Being a Junior, I'm so close to graduation, but yeah everything feels impossible. I'm usually a good student (A/B) but idk this quarter is killing me. I'll update if i find anything that works to change this."
