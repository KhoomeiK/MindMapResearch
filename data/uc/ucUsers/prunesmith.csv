I don't dig on tanks and ""normal"" crew neck tees make me feel like I'm choking. I'd like to support but I'd also like to be able to wear and enjoy the final product!"
knitting,fot3xx8,t1_foss8oe,1588044098.0,I would love to know what mods you used!!! I have had this in my queue for ages and have been too overwhelmed by all the FOs tagged with life rings to figure out the “best” way to make it.
