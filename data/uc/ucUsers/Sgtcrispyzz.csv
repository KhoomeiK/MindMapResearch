UCSantaBarbara,fpbfue1,t1_fpbedff,1588469034.0,"Maybe I'm just better at lecture than lab I don't know. I feel like it's easier to predict what will be covered on the quiz. He'll normally have 60% of it be straight forward concepts, one concept that's trying to be a molecule you haven't seen before but follows the same rules we learned about that week, and then a then something more conceptual. I would really suggest reviewing his clicker problems, the textbook questions, and the mastering chem HW.

I tried to follow the same advice, of reviewing clicker problems and material we went over that week but it doesn't seem have as much of a yield for lab quizzes unfortunately, at least for me."
UCSantaBarbara,fpb8syv,t1_fpaupm1,1588464562.0,"Honestly I don't think his Chem 109C quizzes are nearly as bad as the 6AL quizzes. I average like 90% plus on his 109C quizzes and his 6AL quizzes I average like 65%-70%(except this one was probably way lower, I got fucked harder than usual), it's brutal stuff.

I think it's just because there's so much more opportunities to practice for the 109C quizzes. For those there's book problems and mastering chem, so by the time you take the quiz the problems aren't really anything you haven't seen before, though they might be with a new molecule. This isn't as much the case for lab.

This weeks quiz was especially brutal because the stuff we went over in this week's lab lecture and section (hybridization of the nitrogen's in caffeine, calculating % yields and K values) was not on the quiz at all. He even said this week's quiz would cover chromatography which wasn't there either. So it feels like I ended up wasting my time studying for the completely wrong stuff."

Most TAs are great and I don't even dislike my TA even if I think he grades a bit too obtusely; he's a cool guy otherwise, and I'm sure they're dealing with their own troubles. I just thought that particular post comparing a short answer quiz response to a formal academic manuscript, or official Tweets from the POTUS was absurd, and not getting lab reports back is seriously annoying."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4j6pc,t1_fp4harb,1588300218.0,"I'm the guy who actually got the point knocked off for that typo, and a comparison between a twenty minute timed quiz short answer and a formal publication is a completely intellectual dishonest comparison and you know it. I'll accept the grade, but it's total BS and it's hardly due to a ""lack of understanding of the subject,"" that my finger slipped on the key when I was rushing to get to the next question.

TAs literally not having graded lab reports though is a bigger issue than a point being taken off a quiz for obtuse reasons. It's also massively hypocritical that you would ask people to understand and empathize with the tough situation the TAs are under and then accuse a typo on a timed Chemistry quiz to be a signal of laziness and apathy towards the subject.

I'll take the grade because I can still do better and I could've done better in other areas where I deserved to get points knocked off, but this entire post is such BS."

todayilearned,fosah2q,t1_fos8jo2,1588026931.0,"I have no clue about Harvard’s admissions transparency and it wasn’t really related to the reply I posted, but I find the claims that they’re turning away people for being Asian nonsensical when a large % of their class is Asian. They’re not turning people away for being Asian, it just doesn’t benefit them unless they can show how being Asian has provided them a particularly unique perspective that would benefit the school, which again is hard to do when there’s so many other Asians applying. However a black student can do this more easily in a way that makes them unique. Harvard’s spots aren’t unlimited and someone is getting denied here, so when you have 10 Applicants for 10 spots and 10 applicants  are Asian-Americans with 4.0 and one is a black guy with a 3.8 it benefits the school more to take the black guy over the tenth Asian applicant because he offers a more unique perspective to the school.

Of course, there’s more to applicants than race alone. But the point is Harvard isn’t “denying someone for being Asian,” it’s more that being Asian isn’t a unique trait for Harvard applicants like being black is, and this is an especially important quality for Harvard to consider when they’re trying to train the future leaders of all of America, which is a very diverse country. It’s not about helping disadvantaged applicants as some sort of individual charity, it’s about how that applicants acceptance contributes to the schools mission."
todayilearned,fos6900,t1_fos5rfy,1588024723.0,"Because Harvard wants to make their campus a more interesting place and their goal is to provide leaders for all Americans, and having a diverse student body helps accomplish that.

Harvard has people who will get good grades to choose from in spades. So they look to other qualities to weed them out.

todayilearned,fos571i,t1_fos4pa4,1588024181.0,"Hard work absolutely a major fact that determines what gets in. The issue is that everyone who applies and gets in most likely is hard working. You're competing with a  million different hard working better. However the Uni wants more than just ""someone who works hard"". Because again, as explained that's a character trait they already have in spades to choose from, and most of their applicants are overqualified for actually getting through the school academically. The school wants someone that can provide something aside from just ""being a hardworker"", because again that is a bare-minimum prerequisite, not something that makes you stand out.

Oh okay so we're using your sacerdotal observation of Reddit posts as our official statistics for cheating students. Real nice analysis there.

>Second, ""can you read?"" (I'm quoting you by the way). You're missing the entire point. I'm not saying it's okay to cheat and I'm not ""justifying it."" Literally said that in the post.

Your entire post is implying that cheating is somehow more the fault of the professors and administration for assigning so much work to the students.

>Third, this ""mental gymnastics"" you're referring to is simple logic and empathy. You've commented on a few of my other posts saying how this online stuff is super easy, people are making a bigger deal out of it than it is, people need to stop complaining, etc. As happy as I am for you that you're not having a hard time with this, many other people are struggling and for several different reasons.

That sucks for them. Personally I struggle more with in-person stuff, but I would never use it as an excuse to cheat because other people who prefer in-person stuff need to check their privilege.

>Some people were forced to move out of their homes, some people were forced to move back into abusive households, some people are parents, some don't have wifi, some don't have a place to study, some people don't have laptops, some people can't afford to buy textbooks and relied on checking them out of the library, some just lost their jobs, some people need more instruction and tutoring than what is being offered, etc.

Dude I significantly doubt the majority of people cheating are in abusive households or don't have wifi. Come on, you're reaching now.

>Being inside and social distancing could be aggravating some people's mental illness or causing them serious emotional distress, all this extra work could be aggravating certain disabilities that people have (it's worsening my tendonitis, arthritis, and migraines for example), this could be affecting people's families directly, etc. Stop being such an angry, judgmental person and try to put yourself in other people's shoes once in awhile. Your privilege and arrogance is showing.

Again, the same can be said for in-person classes. This doesn't make cheating okay. I never said that doesn't suck for that person, what does this have to do with anything? I'm not angry in the slightest, and it's ironic that you're labeling me as judgmental while accusing me of being privilege and arrogant in the very next line without knowing literally anything about my life. Dude three members of my family work in an ER, two are immunocompromised cancer survivors who will certainly die if they get this thing and one is trapped in an entirely different country. Yes, this disease effects me directly if you really need to know, but that has little to do with academic dishonesty. You can't use mental health as an excuse to cheat, and using it as some weird shield to blame professors for giving you the work of a full-time student is stupid. Everybody is going through shit."

SubredditDrama,fn5vtuj,t3_fz6ms8,1586677680.0,"Skyler is disliked because the show is told from Walt's perspective and she comes off as an annoying obstacle, not an actual antagonist like Gus or even Hank. She was just generally irritating because it feels like all her character existed to do was nag Walt about doing the the thing that had most people watching the show for, because beyond her increasing disapproval towards Walt her character did literally nothing. Even if realistically she wasn't irrational when you consider the entire scope of everything. Kim in Better Call Saul doesn't get the same amount of hate despite serving a somewhat similar role probably because she has an actual character beyond just badgering the protagonist.

Carole Baskin is disliked because the show literally painted her as a hypocritical murderer. If you think that's true or not that's a different story but it's blatantly framed in such a way to lead the viewer into thinking she killed her husband for money.

Hilary Clinton is an obvious entirely different bag of worms."
UCSantaBarbara,fn5ln6i,t1_fn5kejg,1586668265.0,"Do you have the stats to how many people are cheating or something? For the MCDB 1B Final I saw like 5 different groups in the library all taking it together even though it was a ridiculously easy Gauchospace quiz. Like if you're going to cheat sure, whatever. A bit of a dick move but you do you, but let's stop with these mental gymnastics of trying to justify it."
UCSantaBarbara,fn59gjc,t3_fzejge,1586659158.0,I was definitely thrown off by the random gen chem throwback problem. That honestly felt unfair given that it's not something we were suggested to review.
UCSantaBarbara,fn596yg,t3_fzccd6,1586658973.0,"Lol, cheating is increasing because all the courses are online and it's easier and less pressure to cheat in an online course than on an in-person exam. Let's not pretend like this is some retribution against the professors."
UCSantaBarbara,fmusjlf,t3_fxhwgb,1586397938.0,That's the same as dropping out.
UCSantaBarbara,fmrjt8e,t1_fmrilv8,1586325383.0,"If that questions helps the student understand it better then it's not unnecessary, even if it seems dumb or trivial to you, it's not to them. Maybe he just didn't really get what the professor said."
UCSantaBarbara,fmrify9,t1_fmrgzfw,1586324177.0,"How do you define unnecessary? A question that is completely irrelevant or obvious to you might deepen the understanding of the subject for another student. Few questions are universally ""unnecessary"". Personally I think lectures entirely are borderline unnecessary for basic undergrad subjects and everything can be learned from the books and students should just them for questions."
UCSantaBarbara,fmrd0kj,t3_fwvqsv,1586319725.0,"I don't understand, you're getting mad at people  for asking questions in a classroom? I mean I get if it's a question that's already answered on the syllabus but come on dude."
UCSantaBarbara,fmnedac,t1_fmnco3l,1586224155.0,"My bad, I was actually totally full of shit. I'm registering for Summer Sessions at UCI and UCSB and mixed them up and thought I registered for UCSB when I've only so far registered for my UCI classes. I haven't actually registered for my UCSB Summer classes yet because Junior Pass times don't open until tomorrow morning. I'll let you know how fast it's filling up then though."
UCSantaBarbara,fmn383h,t3_fw6lmx,1586217263.0,"A lot easier than I thought it would be for some reason I thought it’d be over all of Ch. 18, but we’ll see when grades are out. Hopefully it’s graded quick."
UCSantaBarbara,fmmgl37,t1_fmme4yb,1586204885.0,How is it not empathetic to say I enjoy this structure of classes better than normal when people on here are trying to start petitions to stop it?
UCSantaBarbara,fmm6z09,t1_fmm0nzq,1586199930.0,Yeah I don't get all the complaints about online this quarter has been completely chilling so far. I wish every quarter was like this.
UCSantaBarbara,fmm6s7h,t1_fmm2on5,1586199829.0,"I'm registered for it right now, but like others have said it's only open to Chem Chads atm. I honestly doubt they'll cancel it because Gainer said that the entire reason they didn't cancel the Ochem labs for this quarter was because they knew it'd be a mess for people trying to graduate on time."
UCSantaBarbara,fmj24f6,t3_fvjywu,1586121494.0,I don’t really get the point of why you guys keep spamming these type of threads on the front page. I doubt the people hosting these parties browse here and even if they did I’m sure they’re already fully aware of the situation given that it’s World news; a Reddit post isn’t going to suddenly flip a switch in their mind.
