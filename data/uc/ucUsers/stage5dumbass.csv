ApplyingToCollege,fpj5v43,t3_gdjstj,1588657491.0,"Hey congrats! I was in the same situation last year, got really attached, had roommates picked out and everything. It's kind of weird to think about now, because I literally can't imagine not being where I am now. Really was the best choice for me. I'd try to think about it logically bc if I went with feeling back then, I think I would've regretted it.
You're gonna make the right choice."
berkeley,fp76mzo,t3_gbmyi3,1588365013.0,Do the traditional pathway my boy
berkeley,fp559vo,t3_gbb4gg,1588316753.0,berkeley is Hella well-rounded. especially if you want it to be.
berkeley,fp3l52u,t3_gasyq9,1588281226.0,"This is very doable. I'm pretty on track to graduate on time (with space) with CNR and LnS majors. I'd say plan out the requirements and see if it fits. CNR and L&S are probably the easiest colleges to do a simultaneous degrees. CRS and English I think you could do easily in 8 semesters, especially if you have R1A/B and/or math credits already. I think many of your L&S breadths could be filled by CRS or Forestry requirements. The whole english major is around 12 classes, CRS is pretty light in terms of required courses. 
EMF is a bit more though. You could probably minor. If you have AP credits to get you out of most of your lower divs, you could possibly do the whole major. But EMF is less flexible than CRS."
berkeley,fp2q2fv,t1_fp2ped5,1588265985.0,Yeah and dining halls aren't relevant after your first year unless you really want them to be.
berkeley,foyt2wv,t1_foxip2l,1588178660.0,we love when a class is a requirement for everything but no one can ever take it :)

berkeley,fory61s,t3_g8pqve,1588020568.0,"I don't party (do not like being crowded) but I'm very extroverted and love it here.

Berkeley has an everything scene. Big public school = every type of person"
berkeley,forwf01,t1_forbuhd,1588019691.0,"Four classes won't be too much if you're replacing a decal with a lower div class for exploration tbh, provided it's not a very heavy workload. Like maybe don't add chem. 
Also there could be freshman seminars in departments you'd want to explore. These could be hit or miss, probably research your professors."
berkeley,for0eb0,t1_foptq67,1588004000.0,thanks!
berkeley,fopepuc,t3_fqdm9d,1587959607.0,anyone know if there's a place to find official pre-reqs for classes? is it only on Berkeleytime? very few classes I've found publish their actual prereqs on the class schedule and I'm wondering where berkeleytime gets that info if they're the only one with a seemingly comprehensive guide.
berkeley,footyu3,t1_fokugww,1587946411.0,"MEB is where all the wildlife bio people go. Lots of options. worth it to come here, there's gonna be wildlife and ecology research going on here you can get involved in that you don't want to miss out on. And berkeley is close to more nature stuff!"
berkeley,footqgu,t1_fom15a3,1587946271.0,"yeah so essentially just a bio breadth and a physical science breadth. shop around for chill, easy bio breadths (usually just some memorization). L&S discovery courses have cool physical science breadths. I hear living on the edge is cool"
berkeley,foog0js,t3_g8c06k,1587938287.0,"I didn't take environmental science but I did talk about what I wanted to do relating to the environment. Also, everyone I know in CNR had environmental extracurricular activities to some extent, a lot being leaders in environmental groups, volunteering, related jobs, etc. CNR does accept people into majors, unlike L&S. People come in declared, unless you apply as undeclared into CNR. If you're applying into CNR, do talk about how your extracurriculars would translate into CNR-type stuff, even if they're not directly related."
berkeley,fonld2h,t3_g8bin9,1587921715.0,Welcome to the family!
berkeley,fol77c8,t3_g835j4,1587856235.0,"Congrats!
I think you can. Although if you can't, there isn't really any difference because the requirements are the same.
Are you taking EEP 100 in the fall?"
berkeley,fok6yu2,t1_fodj47u,1587836547.0,to be fair espm 6 takes 0 time and 0 effort
berkeley,foed5p4,t1_foecxcy,1587700964.0,"1A is chill, especially if you've done AB already. Chem is much less chill. Chem+physics might be the killer there. I think most bio majors usually wait to do physics."
berkeley,foecisa,t1_fo9o82i,1587700569.0,I think you gotta take the 1 series and then stats if you're gonna also do Econ
berkeley,foe24jt,t3_g6ygdo,1587694537.0,the units! 1st year your classes are everywhere. There's plenty of eecs majors in the units. There were at least 3 on my floor.
berkeley,focs9mv,t1_fnr24mj,1587675174.0,there's a lot of downsides to smaller schools. I think they've found a hard time finding their people and new things to try and such. Also a less urban setting? They probably would've fit better at a big school imo. I'd say most people can find their community at a big school like Berkeley.
berkeley,focfzdo,t3_g6gvpa,1587670879.0,The bulk of the work on a regular week is just a Lot of reading. It's manageable if you're strategic about the readings. Skim for understanding during lecture and find a few important passages to participate during discussion. Workload depends on how you read (I am slow it takes me a while). Humanities classes also tend to have final papers instead of an in-class final.
berkeley,fo5r67w,t3_g4jvei,1587533157.0,hit up the course advice facebook group!
berkeley,fo4a1sa,t1_fo48u37,1587500767.0,you're on a show with reese witherspoon and kerry washington?? holy crap that's so cool!
berkeley,fo0r4ws,t3_g4to3p,1587418223.0,also hit up course advice (facebook group)
berkeley,fnx7fz2,t1_fnwqb91,1587332970.0,same experience here. felt very lucky
berkeley,fnuyiod,t3_g3drtx,1587274625.0,there's something about good watercolors :)
berkeley,fnqwlbl,t1_fnqvin3,1587173811.0,"I am no expert on anything I have just heard of many people double majoring in econ, and polisci people often say that is pairs well as a double major. I think polecon doesn't require as much quantitative econ as econ would (I was looking into it for a friend), but of course idk what you're looking to get out of it."
berkeley,fnqsbr6,t3_g3cdrk,1587171155.0,It would not be too much. I met someone who did that. I honestly think you'd get more out of it if you did both instead of political economy unless political economy is specifically what you're looking for.
berkeley,fnpy5mm,t1_fnnhhv1,1587154132.0,pre-med major isn't a thing the main issue is there isn't a med school for like advising/shadowing/whatever resources that are really good for pre-meds.
berkeley,fnpf7v0,t1_fnpbx54,1587144455.0,DO IT
berkeley,fnpf3bc,t1_fnnj0vb,1587144392.0,Wait how
berkeley,fnpf1aw,t1_fnlvniu,1587144365.0,Go with the Units! U n i t s. Meet biggest variety of people. There were 3 EECS people I knew just on my floor and they were a lot more social (still super smart and hard-working) than the foothill people I encountered. And units are not far at all from campus. No one in the units ever complains about distance haha. Definitely consider putting units for your 4 choices. Blackwell isn't very social.
berkeley,fnpe64m,t3_g2uuz1,1587143933.0,"I do have a friend who loved Tufts and goes there now who absolutely regrets it. This is anecdotal of course but I think a big school like Berkeley yields a lot more opportunities for someone who doesn't know their criteria because whatever you end up looking for, Berkeley will have it."
berkeley,fnmz3bz,t1_fnmncla,1587081007.0,what was the content/coursework of 167 like?
berkeley,fnmdvsy,t1_fnkst79,1587069667.0,"yeah so in big classes without much access to professors, classes have discussion sections. It's a very important part of the class. Like for calc for example, that's where you turn in homework and take quizzes. GSIs (TAs but the berkeley term) are very accessible to explain topics and answer your questions. Also your professors do have office hours, as do GSIs. There's also a lot of resources like the Student Learning Center. And other things you will hear about on campus and through emails and stuff that I can't remember right now. It's a big school with all the resources you need to succeed, some things just take a little finding."
berkeley,fnili9j,t1_fni0t49,1586982073.0,"I think I expressed interest in Global Edge. When I got off the waitlist, I was offered the normal pathway but they also were like ""hey do you want to do global edge"" and I was like heck no

FPF is different though. FPF probably increases your chances of getting in at all"
berkeley,fni6ldv,t1_fngo9nf,1586974852.0,"I personally do not feel lost and lonely. In fact, because it's so big, there's so many people to meet and make friends with. Plus, if you meet someone you don't like, you can probably avoid ever seeing them again with minimal effort.

Homeless people are not dangerous. They are just people who live outside. 

Be careful and you won't have to be worried. Don't be out in the middle of the night. When it's getting late, don't travel alone. Your bike WILL be stolen. Practice basic city safety stuff. Berkeley is not Gotham. Be sensible and you'll be fine.

Dorms are clean. 

Go bears :)"

berkeley,fn83n8h,t3_g06i19,1586733206.0,Sooo many people double major and minor at Berkeley. Definitely also a Berkeley pro. Not hard (plan)
berkeley,fn16dl3,t1_fn03o4u,1586555689.0,"I would not worry about the lack of social life. It is very social! If you are not a social person, you might have a lack of social life. It's not really dependent on Cal. Classes are not easy but Berkeley students enjoy complaining about classes. Workload is manageable (some majors require more management than others). Cal >>> USC any day (unless you had major USC scholarship or you're acting or something)."
berkeley,fmcl6ml,t1_fmckepc,1585947791.0,You'd just also have to take Stats.
