Futurology,fowqchw,t1_fowhn4l,1588124928.0,"In a few years? Modern panels are rated to last 25+ years and that's usually just for the warranty. Panel degredation is usually warrantied at 80% of original capacity at the end of that 25 years. That means that there isn't even a need to recycle them even after 25 years, they will retain second hand value. Further, they are made predominately of silicon, glass, and aluminum. All highly recyclable materials. Yes they have pollution associated with production, but so does any other alternative so I don't see how it is all that relevant."
