Cplusplus,fnjqr65,t1_fni13kd,1587004813.0,"Awesome, this makes a lot of sense - I think the specifications on my assignment were implying a unique_ptr instead of a shared_ptr and I got confused between the two. The convenient array access of a smart pointer was where I was confused too since it's not the same with a shared_ptr. Thanks for this response!"
Cplusplus,fnjnegk,t1_fnhzozu,1587002662.0,"Unfortunately yes, as per the specification I need to use a smart pointer - initially I was under the impression that I would need a shared_ptr however after reading the other response in this thread I think a unique_ptr would be more useful. I'm not sure how to use the unique_ptr to access the array however, which is easier with raw pointers."
