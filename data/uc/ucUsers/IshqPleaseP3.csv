Screenwriting,fpbutsp,t3_gci7dc,1588479296.0,"I’m currently in a very similar position as you. First, I would agree with everyone else that I wouldn’t go unless you can afford it because having student debt for the next twenty years is worth no degree. 

However, the economy is in a place right now that for me - because I don’t have many connections - in not traversable. Right now grad school feels like the best option because it will give me some time before I start my career and I’ll be able to network at a big university. But you are already at USC so maybe you can take advantage of current connections. 

It really depends on what you want. If you’re going for more networking purposes maybe you can take advantage of current networking at your university. But if you’re going because you want more time to develop your writing/ expand your portfolio, and it won’t put you into serious debt, then go for it!"
AmItheAsshole,fp4p0gv,t3_gazw45,1588303924.0,"NTA. I am a current student and if the university refunded us, it would go straight to my parents. They paid for it. It’s not mine to claim just like it’s not your daughter’s to claim."
AskWomen,focpid7,t3_g6l3wn,1587674170.0,I got into a grad program at NYU Tisch! I was on the waitlist and I got off of it. Just have to figure out how to pay for it now lol
UCSantaBarbara,focp2qd,t3_g6spli,1587674015.0,"If the artist brings it back, they could probably make some money! I’m sure a lot of ppl would be super interested in this. I would be lol"
UCSantaBarbara,fnhrib6,t1_fmd8r02,1586967583.0,"Totally missed this. I’m actually waitlisted right now, but I’ve been told I have a good chance. I’m hoping to study screenwriting at NYU. Wbu? Where would you go/ what would you study?"
UCSantaBarbara,fmcr7q9,t1_fmcq6t6,1585951208.0,Yeah I had applied to grad school and then decided to find work but I think it’s back to grad school for me.  Entering the job market in a recession can impact your career for a lifetime
