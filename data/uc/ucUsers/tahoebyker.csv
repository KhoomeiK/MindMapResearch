DotA2,fp78vx8,t1_fp5saem,1588366162.0,One of Midone or Sumail could conceivably leave OG before the end of the year in order to compete in regional leagues and tournaments in their own time zone as adjustments are made to the DPC and Dota 2 scene as a whole.

DotA2,fo2m2bc,t1_fo2kp6e,1587467442.0,"I don't think I was spouting lies or incorrect statements. And I have an Ember Spirit flair.

Up until TI8, I actually thought Fly was the best captain in Dota 2 considering his success with OG and taking a **bad** Complexity team to a reasonable TI finish. And then OG won two TIs without him and I had to reconcile that. N0tail is the only constant on a staggeringly successful OG team, with Ceb being the 2nd most consistent member of it.

If we are talking about the all-time great leaders in Dota 2, #1 and #2 are N0tail and Ceb and I have yet to hear a compelling argument to convince me otherwise."

I love how people try to argue with ad hominen attacks. You raised some good points that I would've been happy to discuss further had you not called me, and anyone who agreed with me, sheep.

Moreover, you will note I made no claims about N0tail being the best captain of all time, nor did I make any claims that Ceb's influence on OG was to be overlooked (In fact, I made sure to emphasize Ceb's contributions to OG's success). I only claimed OG is the most successful Dota 2 team of all time."

Emphasis mine. 

My conjecture: Cat is fully aware that the Bard's plan is related to the tune stuck in her head and is baiting the Bard with it.

Edit: 

As I thought about this, I realized it reminiscent of the very first trick we ever saw Catherine pull.

Chapter 1: Knife 

> Now that got a reaction. The stocky man’s eyes narrowed and he grit his teeth. It was funny, the way most of the fighters who tried to bait me were so easy to bait themselves. He wasn’t stupid enough to up and charge me – he wouldn’t have the reputation he did if he lost his head this easily – **but he went on the offensive the moment I (g)ave him an opening. I guess it didn’t matter how predictable you were when you hit like a horse’s kick.**

 I don't think it's an accident we were reminded of the Callowan fighting pits:


Interlude: Set Them Up
> she cracked her neck the sa(me) way she had back when she’d still fought for silvers in the Pit.

The Bard is threatening a knock out blow; hitting Cat, The Truce and Terms, and Heirophant all at once. But it's an over extension Cat is expecting and will barely deflect, giving her an opportunity to land a winning strike of her own.

Chapter 1: Knife
> Apparently my little comment had gotten a fire going in Fenn, because when he swung at me it was the fastest he’d been so far: I barely managed to slap away his fist at the last moment and he still grazed my jaw. **If that had landed, I’d be out cold on the ground**. I got in close enough that I could smell the sweat of him and threw a haymaker, but it didn’t even faze him: not enough force behind it. He took the hit and tried to wrestle me down, much to my panic. Getting into a grapple with a man that size would be… bad. Shit shit shit. **I landed a desperate uppercut right in his chin and felt a few teeth come loose, which bought me a moment. I got in a kick on the side of his knee and it gave. He dropped into a half-kneel and that was my in.**

Cat hums the fox song right as she plays the Kingfisher card. This is the Bard's opportunity. Taken as soon as given the opening, she goes after Masego. 

Now we wait and see if the desperate defense and counterattack is enough to best the superior foe."
