If that's the case then taking GEs to boost credits this summer won't help you for fall classes since that class will probably fill up on senior day (maybe junior day) of first pass.
That being said it might be different if a lot of students choose to take a leave of absence."
UCSC,fpit01n,t3_gdptga,1588648035.0,"As of I think 2018, people cannot switch into the CS major unless they were admitted as CS."
UCSC,fp7b95a,t3_gbl9t5,1588367382.0,"Yah it definitely is tiring.  There's definitely reasons for why we have grades vs getting rid of them.  Of course there's lots of improvements to our education system that could be made.  First, its important you don't define yourself by your grades.  Often I feel like people put a passionate amount of work into their major because they're good at it rather than actually interested in it.  Its good for a short time but at some point everybody gets graded badly because eventually, at some point there's a human grader with their own biases.


Secondly, remember that everyone is under stress given the global pandemic.  We're taking online classes which means some people who do better at in-person classes may perform worse at online classes and some who are better at online classes will now perform better.  Graders are people too and you don't know what difficulties they've had to go through in a current week and how that may impact how they choose to grade for that week.


Given all those circumstances hopefully that helps explain why we should not always view our grades as direct, for sure, accurate assessments of our work.  If you're proud of your project then be proud of it for the beauty you out in it and define yourself by that.  I know that doesn't help the fact that eventually every person wants to pass a class, but hopefully what I said helps in some sort of faucet in receiving a grade lower than expected.

I also have been disapointed in lower grades I have received this quarter."
UCSC,fp44tv5,t3_gb6v6t,1588291704.0,"I don't know anything about the Lit department, but this is week 5.  Professors are helping students prepare for midterms, and are most likely even rewriting and changing questions since its in an online format or is at least trying to help answer students questions about midterms.  They might be very busy due to this and honestly might be very busy this whole quarter due to a lot of classes having to be reexamined and changed over spring quarter due to moving online.  I would prepare to have a senior seminar as a backup."
UCSC,fnuyxpl,t3_g424vc,1587274977.0,For surfing you'll have to go off campus so that leaves hiking and mountain-biking.  I'd recommend college 9 or 10 since thats upper campus (theres a forest with good hiking/mountain biking trails right behind those colleges).  Probably some of the colleges least known for partying and drugs.
UCSC,fnlzwpp,t3_g29zol,1587062652.0,It could simply be that they received a lot more applicants this year
UCSC,fnjiiiv,t3_g1abcb,1586999673.0,Stay in Python for AI.  Lookup youtube videos that walk you through Python AI projects and do those to start getting the hang of it.  Then try putting in your own data/photos and messing around with ML in that way with the projects on Youtube.
UCSC,fn24ai5,t3_fyu53b,1586577467.0,Yah i wish
UCSC,fn248xm,t3_fyvih7,1586577435.0,"Yah true statements but the UC has been slowly dropping the more research based classes from the CS major requirements.  In the past I think we had to do a lot more theoretical classes that have been dropped or restructured.  
OS has become Design Principles.
CS 101 with Algorithm intros has now become just programming as CSE 101.  I think in the past we had to do either Chemistry or Physics classes.
Its happening slowly."
UCSC,fmk849c,t3_fvrj7h,1586147019.0,"That's amazing how you accomplished that.  UCSC may have its problems and a collective of students may just say that this college experience is bad, but that says nothing about individual experiences in this school.  Don't let what the collective narrates about the school and how they define their experience cause you to do the same.  UCSC has been a good experience for me and I hope you do too.  Define it that way because you individually experienced it that way.

I don't know about the whole commencement situation and if you will be able to walk at a later time at UCSC (like the next time they have a walk after corona virus), but this is a huge accomplishment and you should be feeling just as accomplished as when you stepped onto campus.  I know consciously it makes a big deal to actually physically walk on that stage to physically act out your accomplishment in the world.  Even though you can't do that with corona definitely try to do something for yourself when you graduate to make it feel different and monumental.  Maybe take a trip through memory lane and make a collage or camera roll of some of your best pictures of memories in college or write a book or short story about your college experience.

Don't let this shelter in place stop you from relishing on your experience and sharing it with your son.  Life is gonna through some stuff at us and deal us some bad cards.  Its about how you use those cards.  Celebrate your UCSC experience and cherish it, in the way you know you have exceeded."
