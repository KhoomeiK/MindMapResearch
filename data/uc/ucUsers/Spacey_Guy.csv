Braves,fplxelx,t3_ge3b1p,1588721321.0,I never knew the Modesto Nuts were a Mariner’s affiliate. I remember watching them play the Ports all the time when I was younger and never knew. I guess it’s not as obvious as like the “San Jose Giants” but still
VALORANT,fp89gu7,t1_fp85vpg,1588386836.0,"Yes but not as much. I think I pointed this out in another comment, but let me preface this saying I don’t know what the solution is, and I don’t know what the actual calculation is, but higher combat score appears to be the strongest factor when determine the MMR from performance. At least from what my group of friends and their groups of friends have seen, higher combat score leads to higher ranks even if you play all your games with the same group of people. 

I’ll begin with an unrealistic situation first that I think helps point out the problem. If I’m sage and I were to deal 80 damage to every member on the enemy team by spraying 2 through a smoke on one person, getting some shots on someone when they run by a tight angle, and then peeking a 2v2 with teammate 1. Teammate 1 kills one person in the 2v2 after I tagged them, but the other is hiding and waiting to repeak. I heal teammate 1 back to full health after he got extremely low, and then he gets the kill when the 2nd enemy repeaks. Let’s say we’re on attack. I wall off one line of site, and so teammate 2 can plant. Meanwhile teammate 3 and 4 are holding other angles. It’s a 5v3. Teammate 2 dies to one of the other enemies and I see where he died from. I throw a slow orb, which allows teammate 4 to get the kill. It’s a 4v2. Teammate 3 and 4 see the last 2 people coming, teammate 3 kills the first one, and damages the second, and then teammate 4 kills the last guy. Me, the sage, did 80 damage to everyone, helped get the plant, healed teammate 1 so they could get the second kill, and slowed another to help someone else finish that kill. Yes I should have gotten kills, but I didn’t, instead I enabled all of them to happen. Teammate 1 has a higher combat score than I do. Teammate 3 has a higher combat score that I do

This is obviously unrealistic, and some people will see it as “well you didn’t get the kills so you’re not as good” but this is not a pure shooter. There’s more to this game then just getting kills, there’s plants, angle holding, abilities, and ultimately kills are just dealing the last bit of damage. Some characters have a stronger ability to frag, some have an ability to provide information, and some are better at enabling the fraggers and supporting. There seems to be a focus on getting kills earlier than others and getting the most kills in most of the performance related metrics and that is not a good indicator of skill, and not a good indicator of how much you did for the team. Even if there were no abilities and roles, it still wouldn’t be a perfect measure for what people are doing for the team. I do think there needs to be a way to allow performance to help in MMR, but the system needs adjustment and that’s all I’m trying to point out. 

A real example is only anecdotal evidence, but given equal skill games, more often than note the Sage will carry in terms of assists simply from her abilities, the Raze will carry in kills and damage and thus have a high combat score, the Phoenix is the entry fragger so maybe his damage output is lower the Raze but his combat score is high. I’ve had only done ranked as a full stack and can’t play ranked with 2 of my friends anymore because they “performed better” meaning they had more kills. I main sage, they main Phoenix and Raze. Obviously they will have more kills. Their skillset is designed to get more kills, but sage is designed to help them get kills.  I don’t know what the calculation is doing exactly or how it’s working but it’s not as it’s intended I think."
VALORANT,fp7in2k,t1_fp7g34q,1588371329.0,"I know it’s something to improve and I get that. I’m working on it. 

My headshot rate is a little low, I wouldn’t say I’m a great player, but my whole point is that relative to my friends and the people I’m playing we’re all about equal, but I’m ranking up slower due to a lower kill count/less entry fragging even though I have much higher assists and probably more damage and am supporting them.

I don’t know the exact way performance is being calculated, but Im assuming that it’s related to average combat score, and that awards entry fragging/multi-kills much more than say 5 assists. Call outs, and tactical plays can’t be measured. If I do 80 damage to everyone, and then my friend gets the kill, and then I heal him, and he gets a second kill, I use my wall to allow us to plant, then slow orb another person that our other teammate kills, and then another teammate gets the other 2 kills. My friend ends up with a higher combat score for that round. I don’t know the way to fix it since help like that is hard to measure and quantify. Yes, I should have gotten the kills, but the help that I did that whole round is considered worse than entry fragging for 2 picks on people at less than half health."
VALORANT,fp7fnj1,t1_fp7fhcn,1588369735.0,"I land hits on them when they peak, but not a headshot so they survive and don’t repeak that angle. 

I take damage in a gunfight when I peak and rather than try to win it, I unpeak to stay alive.

Edit: I know getting headshots is something I need to work on, but in pistol rounds, ecorounds, with a phantom from long range etc. it’s very easy to do damage and either you step away or the enemy steps away. Sage is valuable and it’s better to stay alive than to risk death even if I’m likely to win the gunfight. Often times too I’m sage so I’m WITH someone and it’s a 2v1 gunfight where I do damage but don’t deal the finishing blow. Sage is ultimately a support character and although she is a powerful soloist I prefer to play her to help others"
VALORANT,fp6d8qh,t1_fp6crw6,1588350342.0,"Because I heal him, deal damage to all the enemies so that they can be more easily killed, wall off things so he (and the rest of my team) can fight in a more advantageous situation. I might not be the fragger getting the kills, but I guarantee you the team would have significantly less kills if I was trying to be the fragger rather than supporting their ability to frag.

Edit: in this game, most kills does not mean best player in a balanced game. Most kills means more opportunities and maybe a role on the team that is more likely to get picks. I play sage, so I do my best to help everyone else do good, and then clean up enemies when they die. I’m never the first to push because having me alive to continue to help is much better"
VALORANT,fp65lqd,t1_fp64g52,1588346494.0,I think this is how it works. It sucks because I’m the type of player with a KDA of like 15/13/15 and my friend if the type of player with the 25/8/5 stat line and he’s definitely ranking up more than I am.
VALORANT,fp40evq,t1_fp3xvng,1588289242.0,"The way they’re calculating MMR is new and fresh and they need to get player feedback on that. They’re factoring in your performance. But how exactly they calculate your performance matters a lot. Finding bugs like another game I play (Rocket League) had that allowed high ranked people to force matches against low ranked people is something they need to test. They need to test how they identify boosting. They need to test how they matchmake for parties. They need to test a lot of things. There’s no copy and paste they can do for ranked, they have to test not only for bugs, but for how exactly it’s implemented so that people are the most happy with it. Not a single feature of any game is magically perfect on the first try. They need to look for bugs, and they need to have things play tested in order to try to make it perfect when the game goes fully public"

ucla,fosdedd,t3_g9b3bx,1588028525.0,"Take what I say with a grain of salt because I took all these courses during the regular quarters (not summer). But I took 1B and 4AL at the same time (along with 2 other classes), and then 1C and 4BL at the same time (along with 2 other classes)

4AL and 4BL have been reworked, they used to be nightmare classes and now they’re really really friendly workload wise. They take up a little bit of time, but shouldn’t be too bad. Aside from the times around the few reports they’re not a heavy workload at all. Of those 2, 4BL is a little more time consuming. 1B isn’t too bad if you feel comfortable with single variable calculus. 1C can be difficult at times. I think that the 1B/4AL session would be no problem. The 1C/4BL session might be a bit less manageable. It’s definitely doable if you treat the summer session as basically just another quarter of classes. If you do 1C/4BL expect to have the same amount of workload/downtime as you would with a normal quarter of 3-4 classes"
3Dprinting,forc0lt,t1_forb5rv,1588009669.0,"It doesn’t save filament but it ensures solid prints on the first try. With the skirt I can fine tune the level without stopping the print. Even if it’s the smallest of adjustments, as long as I was close with my bed leveling to begin with I can make my first layer near perfect every time. Without the skirt I have to watch my first layer, and if my first layer isn’t perfect then that’s a part of my print that is imperfect and usually has to restart. The time it takes to stop the print, clean off the bed, and then re-level is much more than it takes to print a skirt and the extra tiny bit of filament is usually negligible. For large prints 2 rings on the skirt works just fine. For someone without a BL touch having the skirt saves probably 1 in 10 prints from having to be stopped and restarted, and those other 9 go from decent leveling to near perfect first layers every time"
3Dprinting,for96ni,t1_for8d9k,1588008305.0,"I use a skirt to prime the nozzle and to double check bed leveling. 

If the skirt comes out really nice, then you know the first layer should be decent. If the skirt has parts that aren’t sticking as well, or parts that are two close, you can make minor adjustments while the print is running before you start the actual part of the print to get the level just right."

Optional is good because if I need the graded class, I can have it, and if it’s an issue for others they can go p/np.

changemyview,fo7aj89,t1_fo75rhl,1587575042.0,"I guess my point with the initial cost thing is that the initial cost is too high. There are a lot of people getting college degrees, but there’s a lot of needless unhappiness, debt, and regret that come with those degrees that could be avoided by reducing the price or making it free. The investment should be the time and effort, not the money and the weight of debt looming over your shoulder. If college degrees were free or significantly reduced in price, I think it would increase the value of degrees from good schools, while increasing the average knowledge level of general society. The point of college degree is to prove that you are educated in a certain field so that when you go into that field people can count on you to do things correctly. If college was free or significantly lower in price, it would still do exactly what it’s meant to do. People would still be trained in their fields, still be required to put in all that effort to learn their stuff. Schools would get more competitive at the highest level, but most importantly college would be accessible to everyone in an equal manner. Charging ridiculous prices for education limits education to those who can afford it in the first place. It leaves no room for growth as a society, and it doesn’t as easily allow those from a poorer background to make something for themselves. Of course we need people to do all jobs, but having more educated people is never a bad thing for anyone but dictators and making education more accessible is the only way to achieve that"
changemyview,fo71xan,t3_g5ivea,1587570801.0,"While I don’t think you need to consider it a right, I do want you to take something else into consideration. The cost of college is way too high, and maybe college isn’t a right, but for many jobs necessary to our society in the modern  day it is a requirement. I’m currently studying to be an engineer.  I spent many years as a kid working hard just to get into college. I’ve spent 2 and will spend 2 more years studying for a basic degree that says I’m qualified to be an aerospace engineer. Because of the price of college I will then spend 5-10 years of my life paying off loans before I see any of the benefits my work. I spent years of my childhood working to go to college (just considering high school thats 4), will spend a total of 4 in college, and then to be generous another 5 after that paying it off. So for a better future, and to do a job that is a necessity to society I have to sacrifice 13+ years of my life before I see any benefit. That’s only for an engineering degree and it’s all necessary so that it’s assured I’m qualified. What about doctors and nurses that spend 8-12 years in college, then a few years with lower salary and then a few years paying off all that debt, and then actually getting the benefits. For them it’s something close to an investment of 20 years of their life in order to save people. How can that be justified. If you could cut back even just a few years of that investment for those types of people wouldn’t you? Not all college degrees are worth the same though, not all people go into society benefiting fields, but the vast majority of college degrees are necessary in our daily lives. We as a society need educated people. The cost of college makes it harder and harder for us to get those educated people into the work force in those fields, and the cost of college makes people in those fields disproportionately come from wealthier families who didn’t have to worry about that added time commitment. I’d argue college education is not a right, but it’s a requirement that people do it in our society, and at the current price is limiting/deterring people of lower income from obtaining those jobs. This causes systematic poverty/low-income which is not what “the American Dream” is supposed to be about for anyone. College is a large time investment already, why do people who commit to that time, make it through, and ultimately go on to benefit society, have to give up more of their time to pay back loans."

ucla,fnbp7d8,t3_g0tjw9,1586819616.0,"CS31 was a rigorous class and it taught me a strong amount of CS to be able to continue learning. I’m taking CS32 and CS33 over the coming 2 years (CS is my tech breadth so they’re not immediate concerns) so I can get back to you on that later. From what I’ve heard from my EE & CS friends, CS31 is the solid foundation and from that alone you can continue with C++ and coding in general, and 32 is the more advanced stuff and teaches you more applications and more ways to use tools you know in really complex ways. 

From personal experience CS31 has been useful not from the C++ knowledge but from the coding knowledge. C++ is a pain to work with, but working with it helps you to program in other languages later. C++ helped me to pick up some python for the Physics 4 labs pretty quickly, and now is helping me to pick up MATLAB really fast too. The languages are different but once you have a strong foundation in C++ which imo and in others is a lot more of a pain and requires a lot better coding practices, MATLAB, Python, and other languages are easy. I tried learning Python prior to C++, and I got too busy and wasn’t getting the hang of it, but picking it back up after CS31 has been a breeze. 

TL;DR 31 gives a strong foundation for not only C++, but for coding in general. CS32 I have no personal experience in, but from others know it’s the more advanced applications of the C++ knowledge and isn’t as essential, but still useful."

Yes attending UCLA obviously comes with a high financial cost, but the cost is for good reason. If the US government suddenly went “we want an extra $50 from everyone just because” you’d be pretty pissed. Sure you don’t have to live in America, you could pack up and leave to another country after you do all the right paperwork just like you could do for UCLA, but why go through that trouble when everyone here earned their stay, has invested time, and has already acknowledged the financial cost PRIOR to this extra charge. If my options are fight this unnecessary charge that does nothing for me, does nothing to improve the quality of my education at UCLA, and does nothing for anyone in need, mindlessly throw money at something useless, or leave UCLA where I’ve invested time and money into to earn a good education obviously I (like 98% of students) would choose to fight this unnecessary charge"

Practice in towers (not so much towers of time. They’re fun but the modifiers don’t assist too much in real games) or just in regular training. Practice combos but don’t just look them up, try to figure some out. Learn what moves for your character pop up the player, learn how fast they hit (by looking at frame data), learn which ones are powerful combo enders (not very fast and usually only safe if it is in a combo, but with nice damage or puts positions you well). Doing that will give you a feel for your moves of your character. Once you have a character mostly understood yourself, then I’d say you can move to watching videos of people play or videos of people doing combos with your character or online tutorials. A big problem I had in MK9 and MKX was I jumped straight into practicing 2-3 combo strings with the characters I learned and never really learned the ins and outs of that character. It was like brain dead if I could land the combos I won, otherwise I lost. MK11 I’ve avoided doing that and been playing better.

 Practice with the tournament variations and pick the variation that has the moves that you like the most/that you think are the best. Once you have that down, the only way you will get better is playing online more and learning how people play and what the meta is like. You’ll learn to play “footsies” learn what moves are coming and how to block them, learn the basics of popular characters and how to counter them, and so on. Practice or regular matches vs AI will give you an understanding of the moves of a character, but only playing more can help you learn how to beat other people."
