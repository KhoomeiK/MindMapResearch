There is no good excuse for keeping tuition the exact same while most students cant access most things on campus.  If they want online education to be a thing they should make it more affordable for students to be able to buy laptops by lowering tuition to an actual fair price so students can afford cameras, and mics, or at least they should be giving us all those tools, they have no lack of funding and money from our tuition right now. I cant wait to see how far the chansolors pay raise is going to be while the argument of not being able to give everyone the tools they need to be successful in online education. Maybe starting at least somewhere and maybe actually buying some tools for some students is better than helping no one and keeping all of the money from tuition and refusing to lower it so students cant buy what they need to be successful, but that's just my two cents."
