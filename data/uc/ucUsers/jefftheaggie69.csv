UCDavis,foxtsgy,t1_foxtke8,1588156032.0,"Thank you 🙂! The program’s really fun so far. The first day was were we introduced ourselves with members from the product analytics team and had a quiz on that day too. On the second day, we also had a movie night with them watching “The Social Network” where it was about how Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook."
UCDavis,foxs1y0,t1_foxrq8q,1588154294.0,"Of course. We Stats majors always gotta stick together 🙂🙂🙂. Another insight regarding the major is that, this also helped me get in for my current Apprenticeship at Facebook for the Facebook Data Challenge 2020. It’s a 4 month program where I get to work with a mentor group (my mentor is a Data Scientist on the Instagram team at Facebook) where we go through the process of project development, mock interview prep, and have a SQL boot camp in the end. I get to meet fellow finalists from UCI, UCSD, UCLA, UC Berkeley, public Ivy’s, and regular Ivy leagues (another student from UC Davis got in as well 🙂). If you utilize your resources well enough. You can thrive within the major 🙂🙂🙂."
UCDavis,foxnmoa,t3_ga4qdo,1588149839.0,"UC Davis would be a better option of the 2 because the Statistics major has a lot of applied programming coursework in R, so you’ll get the fundamentals of statistical computing and you’ll be able to translate that into Python to use more of the statistical libraries to open more doors for companies. You can also take CS classes to supplement the degree whether it would be for a minor or a double major. The Stats major at SJSU, isn’t very applied. They only have one programming class in R and one programming class in SAS, so the major alone at that school won’t really prepare you as much compared to Davis. Also, in the Data Science track, you can take Computer Science major classes/electives such as Intro to Programming in Python, Data Structures in Python, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Database Systems, Programming on Parallel Architectures, Information Interfaces, and Machine Learning. I’m currently a sophomore at UC Davis doing the Statistics major with an emphasis in Data Science, so I’ve already taken some of these courses already 🙂🙂🙂"
UCDavis,foxn5ec,t1_foxmwvs,1588149368.0,Thanks for the shoutout. I would be glad to answer any questions 🙂🙂🙂
UCDavis,fonzx5h,t3_g84sxq,1587929774.0,"For me, it’s more like I’m doing slightly better than the other quarters, but that’s only because I don’t have midterms, but instead, bi-weekly quizzes and only one legit final."
UCDavis,fo40d7v,t1_fo405yd,1587496029.0,Really? The Calc room TA’s literally show you how to do the problems on your homework. The only real issue is impaction because there are times where there could be hella students in the room and you only have around 3-ish TA’s that are available at a time.
UCDavis,fo3zgjb,t3_g5kbnc,1587495583.0,"I second this (even though from what I experienced in the MAT 21 series, the TA’s actually know how to explain the homework to you, so they’re my top resource). Symbolab literally can do integrals, derivatives, and it’s even doing me favor with my Linear Algebra Homework with matrix calculations and at times, systems of equations. It even shows you the steps on how to calculate the expressions given to you as well rather than just giving you the answer."
UCDavis,fnqe813,t1_fnq1ll6,1587162873.0,Exactly. It makes sense to find a role in this industry whether it matches your current skill set or interests
UCDavis,fnpf8di,t1_fn8oip4,1587144462.0,"I can somewhat confirm this. I remembered during my first video call with the members of the Product Analytics team for the 1st day of the Data Challenge, I asked them to differentiate between the roles of a Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Data Analysts at Facebook and the response I really got was the Data Engineer is the primary cider of the group in which they have to do a lot of the organization of messy data through SQL and create pipelines, whereas the Data Scientist is much more like the applied Statistician in the group (never explained the Data Analyst role during the conversation)."
UCDavis,fnpeawb,t1_fnoa0zw,1587143999.0,"It could be possible, but you would have to do a lot of self-studying on the side as well. I wouldn’t fully know because I never had an internship before. The closet “work” experience that I have is being a Developer for the Bit Project and my current apprenticeship with Facebook for their Data Challenge (for those that don’t know, it went from a weekend long Hackathon to a 4 month Apprenticeship Program)."
UCDavis,fn5wr9j,t1_fn5wpma,1586678637.0,I see. I’ll look into that class as well
UCDavis,fn5vsna,t1_fn5vcsg,1586677644.0,"The thing is that the technical writing class is more like it’s useful if you’re an engineering Major because you have to paten a lot of physical inventions that you create and since I’m trying to get into Data Science/Data Analytics (which is software oriented), I’m mainly going to be organizing large sets of Data, so I’m not really going to be making any inventions. I’m just here to help build inferences on how the company can approach their problem regarding the consumer data."
UCDavis,fn4gn29,t1_fn4gaxm,1586640991.0,"That’s really great to know. I really hope I have him as a professor because honestly, my biggest struggle is developing a deep level of conversation with recruiters in terms of why I would like to work for them. Usually, whenever I encounter recruiters, I just specifically ask about the role and the basics of what their company is about, but nothing else more. I hope I’ll gain something from this course after completing it."
UCDavis,fn4fiai,t1_fn4fenb,1586640325.0,I see. I’ll take a look at that and keep the class in mind. Thanks for the tip
UCDavis,fn4f807,t1_fn4f6r4,1586640157.0,Why?
UCDavis,fn4cytq,t1_fn4ct38,1586638826.0,"Oh ok. That’s great to know. As long as the class is nice and straightforward, I’m all for it."
UCDavis,fn0xip5,t1_fn0xc6g,1586550681.0,"Of course, which is why I’m taking on various project opportunities to further myself for the career and I’m also taking to time to train myself through online courses as well."
UCDavis,fmyaza1,t1_fmyaknk,1586481995.0,"I plan on taking the STA 141 series my Junior year and I do plan on taking more ECS classes in the future. I’ve taken ECS 32A (Intro to Programing in Python), ECS 32B (Intro to Data Structures in Python), and I’m currently taking ECS 20 (Discrete Math) as a prereq for ECS 122A (Algorithm Design and Analysis). I also plan on taking ECS 171 (Machine Learning), ECS 165A (Database Systems), and ECS 163 (Information Interfaces). Thanks for giving me your insights on what to expect when I enter a field like this."
UCDavis,fmx8qtf,t1_fmx8mqr,1586460515.0,Ok. I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you
UCDavis,fmam80o,t1_fmam6je,1585899093.0,Thank you 🙂
