UCSD,fo0h0gg,t3_g4j7rs,1587412976.0,"I love the HCI and ML communities here. I am pretty much doing what you‚Äôre considering - I do projects, extracurriculars, and the odd class with the HCI peeps, majoring in Cogs-ML, minoring in math and CS. I‚Äôm taking COGS 118C right now and it feels fulfilling.

At the very least, join UCSD Design Co!

I really appreciate the electrical engineering perspective when it comes to CS and ML / signal processing & info theory, and I heartily recommend that to someone at the start.

It is easy to water everything down and lower one‚Äôs expectations within CogSci, and that could be a frightening realization upon graduating.

I believe it will work for me because I naturally pursue my own growth goals, and am excellent with risk and networking. I can‚Äôt recommend it across the board. In high school I got a mechanical/mechatronics engineering internship, and transferred with an associates in Physics. I won‚Äôt get a great opportunity without leveraging every bit of my experience.

That wouldn‚Äôt be the case with a CS or engineering degree - but that‚Äôs a double edged sword! Many engineers become dissatisfied exactly because they are so very formed."

UCSD,fntx6bg,t3_g3r34v,1587250308.0,"no it‚Äôs not lol. find any accountable way to study math and cs fundamentals. become an urbit dev on the side.

HOWEVER seeing your success so far, i highly recommend you do not do community college, and take the most elite free ride you‚Äôve got.

Community college could stifle your momentum and water down the achievements that have prepared you for a full blooded college experience. They are also highly impacted with CS, and can have inefficient and limiting attitudes for education."
