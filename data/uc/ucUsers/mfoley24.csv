I finally realized I have to do something for myself.  There's plenty of advice online about how to be productive and stay sane in quarantine so I am not going to put it all here.  There are 2 things that have worked for me. 1- setting a timer.  I work for this amount of time on this thing without looking at anything else.  Start small and build up to 1 hour spans then take a 10 minute break.  The other thing I am doing is more about the mental aspect.  I write down 2 things I am thankful for. They don't have to be earth shattering.  The small things make a big difference.  I hope this helps."
