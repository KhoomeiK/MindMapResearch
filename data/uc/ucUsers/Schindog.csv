LateStageCapitalism,fplwiev,t1_fplm861,1588720820.0,"My god I sympathize so much. My parent friends are barely holding it together. They've been finding it helpful establishing beneficial routines with their kids, as the other commenter was suggesting: perhaps a half hour of yoga, 5 minutes of meditation a few times a day, some Scrabble or Boggle here and there, an hour of a mentally stimulating video game here and there, each learning a different instrument and trying to play sections of songs you both know straight away (without caring how they sound, it'll be fun to look back on!); any selection of activities of that ilk, and you and the will both be able to maintain and develop coordination, cognition, vocabulary, fitness, mindfulness, musicality.

I suppose the hard part is getting them to commit or engage, but rather than shoving it on them, you could ask them when they'd like to sit down for a ""grown-up conversation"" (if they're small) to plan around things they like to do. Perhaps each involved can expand their comfort zone and interests, or at least you can expand on common ground!"

Little bit of advice that's also hugely applicable to music: try to avoid comparing yourself to somebody whose circumstances you don't know; it could be Joshua Bell dressed up like a homeless guy, and you just convinced yourself you could never be a violinist because, ""well, even that homeless guy can play like a pro, and he's still homeless."" 

I've got like a decades head start on you! I'm a 26 year old who just got laid off due to Covid-19 taking the time to learn a new skill (web development), using the savings I've accumulated from a few years in the workforce, to try and come back stronger afterwards.

lingling40hrs,fo4nwx2,t1_fo3swpo,1587507861.0,"Watching this, I think he was, consciously or subconsciously, communicating the subdivisions and specific emphasis with his body; notice how his vibrations change when the subdivision changes from simple to compound at 1:15. I know when I conduct stuff as rhythmically angular as this, I can't help but vibrate to the subdivisions, almost as a means of regulating and contextualizing my larger gestures. Obviously, Dudamel is on another level, but perhaps a bit of insight!

Also, one instructional note for aspiring conductors out there that's not necessarily intuitive, but exemplified here in that same subdivision change at 1:15. Notice that in the simple feel prior, he divides time very evenly in halves (and each half in half, down to his seizure-like vibrations), freezing for the same amount of time that he moves, and moving at a consistent speed. Then, when the feel changes, his rebound (going up) becomes twice as quick as his descent, communicating the triplet feel. With this approach the bottom of the beat shows the beat itself, the first subdivision, the top of the beat shows the second subdivision, and because two points make a line and musicians' brains can count to 3, the third subdivision is implied as he returns to the bottom of the beat. (though in this case, he returns to the bottom very quickly and freezes there to maintain the angular feel)

One mistake new conductors often make when conducting a compound feel (6/8, 12/8, 9/16, any time signature with a triplet subdivision) is to make the ascent slow, and then snap back down to the bottom to give the next beat. The issue is that the two points of information you are giving per beat are subdivisions 1 and 3, and leaving each musician to guess at the placement of 2. This will cause your ensemble's rhythm to suffer, and they'll often drag because with each beat, they're waiting for information that you're delaying. Try each so you know what they both feel like, so you can catch yourself, and then work fast ascent, slow descent into your muscle memory.

Turned into much more of a rambling comment than I'd intended, but that's what happens when I get on this topic lol I hope it was useful to somebody!"
