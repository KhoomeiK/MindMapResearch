However, if you are extremely fat/obese you will definitely stand out. There are two obese girls that i ""happen"" to run into often when im out. By ""happen"" i mean that i don't run into them more or less often then say, my friends, I just think that I run into them more often than i do because they are very noticeable =/ i don't really know them as people so i can't say for sure but one of them is in a latinx sorority and I have run into them with friends about as much as alone. I also see them at a lot of the parties i go to, so they are definitely not excluded. Both of them seem to be very confident with who they are so that might also be a factor"
