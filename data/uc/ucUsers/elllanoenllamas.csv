In Gesthemane one of the apostles (forgot which) striked one of the roman guards' ears (was he roman? can't recall), and Jesus condemned that act.

Why did God in the Old Testament require war at times? IDK yet I haven't read the Old Testament. But I know personally that in my life I must never take another's! It is not required of me nor is it good."

I had one prof who did a masters in chemistry only to say fuck it and start from scratch to end up becoming a full time russian studies prof (went thru undergrad and grad studies). Especially in your case, if you do math this or math that in my honest opinion it's only technicalities, and you'll end up in more or less the same place after 4 years.

We're all part of the same generation and the internet screwed us all in one way or another. Knowing how disgusting it feels, you should do your part in helping others heal from our mistakes, and one of the best ways is for you as an individual to stop! I'm doing (or trying to) do mine!

OrthodoxChristianity,fow9dbi,t1_fovq6fo,1588115441.0,"hm looking at this guy's videos, his way of thinking definitely doesn't come from an Orthodox vein, I doubt you should be basing your opinions about Orthodoxy from this video alone, or from any of his videos. In any case I don't think any youtube video would do justice Orthodoxy justice, since they're just that, youtube videos lol. Anyone can go on there and speak what they want. Christ receives slander on the daily.

But if u wanna watch yt videos, try this one! This man is an example of a saint, and a saint is simply someone who really tried hard to understand love and compassion, and did his best to be in good standing with God. Cared for the youth of tomorrow, the animals the trees and all that u know, and went to Church when he or she had to for, the love of God!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q\_ifoznlb6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_ifoznlb6M)

Honestly St Porphyrios is an incredible person and if more human beings would be as simple and loving as him, I think the world would indeed be a better place.

And there's so many incredible examples of saints. St Maria of Paris, St Moses the Black, etc.

Also on the subject of icons I don't think early icons had reversed perspective, but they were still venerated (look at the icons in the roman catacombs, or the ones from the Hagia Sophia). Icons come in many styles. Many don't have reversed perspective."
OrthodoxChristianity,fovqfac,t3_g9kb3y,1588105738.0,"My friend!! Orthodoxy is about love. Can't make it any more difficult than that. And to think that God is Love is too idealistic of a view, to quote what you said below, is correct - it is illogical to believe love exists haha. But this is where faith comes in! To believe love is true, that humans are capable of goodness, that God loves us, that God is Love and only Love! We just need faith. We just need to give other ppl a chance, and we need to open up our hearts to God.

To give credit where it's due, I'm kinda paraphrasing what Fr Seraphim of Aldea said (a monk who settled in Scotland) - but it is something I've always personally already agreed with, and I think many of us internally do, since we yearn for love and compassion. Fr Seraphim, a man who has been through a lot of internal turmoil, just confirmed my - or I hope our - thoughts.

Forget all the dutch thinkers with their in your face intelligence, and all the Lovecrafts and all that. Just love God and our neighbors, what more! There can only be joy in helping others and trying - because it isn't easy - to follow God's will.

Much love!!"
OrthodoxChristianity,fovkw9e,t1_foss704,1588103046.0,"I agree with this! 

Don't just see her as ""satan girl"" or something as degrading as that. She is very lost, but she's still a human being and therefore there's still a chance for her to be redeemed. You might've screwed up by being harsh and holier than thou as you say, but you can always pray for her salvation!

In any case your situation was very difficult and taking time for yourself to figure things out was the best thing you could've done.  I was in a situation kinda like that. Not easy!

I was referring to ppl in eastern europe and the likes, where they embrace their country's predominant religion more to espouse a xenophobic ideology, in the sense that the religion becomes just one of many emblems in their background. This sort of thing spews over to our hemisphere of the world, and mainly online. That's my 2 cents !

The priest generally is the more understanding of the lot since he has basically seen it all - and like others who urge you to go talk to one, I do as well!
