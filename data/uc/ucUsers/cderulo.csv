BlackPeopleTwitter,fp1bkvn,t1_fp16wxj,1588230160.0,might be major dependent too. I could see AP English lit or lang being harder than some English writing GEs for sure. STEM classes however (and upper divs) have been way harder than high school ap classes.

VALORANT,fo7rvfm,t3_g5katp,1587583475.0,Bro one time on split I was defending in B garage while the enemy team was mid. I thought I heard them coming back from mid to B but it turns out they were pushing heaven onto site and I legit did not know what was going on until someone pushed B garage themselves from B site. I’m DMG in csgo and the directional sound and radius are fucked in some cases.
smashbros,fnyeb6k,t1_fnxy4ib,1587360592.0,usually when they say they’re mashing it usually means they’re just throwing out attacks/hitboxes a lot without having a solid game plan.
Unexpected,fny2u7t,t1_fnxebj8,1587352051.0,tik tok bad. reddit good.
