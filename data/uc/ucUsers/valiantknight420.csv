You not only learn to build a project by yourself from scratch, but the intricacies and painstaking debugging really give a real life experience. Now we’re almost to the finish line... just the final exam to go!!"

berkeley,fpjf1fg,t3_gdrpzu,1588666117.0,Maybe you will be able to clutch a point from the course evaluations and then email course staff because you would be a mere one point away??
berkeley,fpjexn3,t3_gdrr2x,1588666008.0,"I’m really sorry to hear this and really hope you’ve been able to get some progress with the help of the above comments.

Likely if you’re code is getting a 0/28, the main problem may be with your Main class or you may not have implemented persistence entirely correctly. I would highly recommend checking out these two concerns and ensuring these work.

Next, try to see what’s going wrong with your basic commands (init, add, rm, commit). These tests are nearly 1/3 off all of them so you would be able to salvage a hefty amount of points from this.

I understand you are stressed but trust me you can do this. You are very close to finishing and just keep trying. If you need assistance, please feel free to reach out (i’m in 61B right now and would love to help you out)."
berkeley,fpgveiu,t3_gdbppj,1588610205.0,"would highly highly recommend you take CS61A... the class not only builds your coding skills but makes you a better problem solver. Most of the questions in this class are logic based, so if you take a step back and really try to understand what each question is asking, you will be able to do it as the coding part is fairly straightforward.

My roommate decided to take CS10 (The Beauty and Joy of Computing) and regrets doing that because that course didn’t help him too much in 61A.

Through discussion, office hours, and CSM(really recommend you do CSM), I’m sure you will be able to not only survive in 61A, but excel."
berkeley,fp7b2yu,t1_fp75uv0,1588367293.0,"The only reason I said that grading system is usually a bit easier is because the class is run by TA’s in the summer opposed to the actual professors in the fall/spring. 

Because of this difference, I believe that the grading becomes a bit easier, as well as the fact that you will likely focus only on 61A in summer, without any classes to worry about, which will likely translate to you performing better since your attention is solely on one class."
berkeley,fp6a5zg,t3_gbckl8,1588348815.0,"Likely, Fall will also be online so I’d recommend taking it over the summer. Although you wont have the delight of learning for DeNero, the class in summer had a better grading system (for the last few years afaik). 

You’d only be one step ahead if you took in summer, so if it is financially ok and you are fine with having a small workload over 8-10 weeks definitely go for it!"
berkeley,fp69tut,t3_gbi5sj,1588348646.0,"I really recommend against taking 61A and 61B together, as the concepts kind of reinforce each other. 

Take 61A in summer or fall (as soon as you’d like) and then take 61B the semester immediately after. 

61A teaches Python which a fairly simple language to understand, which will really help you get a better gist of CS and some of the kind of questions that are asked on tests and stuff.

61B delves deeper into the various data structures from 61A (and more) while introducing a new language, Java. 

After these two classes you will feel much more confident in CS and will likely even intend on taking some more CS classes, I assure you.

But do yourself a favor and don’t take both together..."
berkeley,fp56jkq,t3_gb6sr5,1588318018.0,this is the epitome of beautiful poetry
berkeley,fo96xri,t3_g6cyr6,1587611968.0,"i would highly highly recommend trying to grasp persistence first and then moving onto commands. watching the videos and looking at the pictures in the spec really help with that. 

once you have persistence done, you will be able to understand how to structure your commands and files and blobs.

trust me you’re not the only one struggling, but feel free to reach out if you still need some assistance."
berkeley,fo8ptlk,t3_g6azrq,1587601377.0,"I was personally in the substance free dorm myself and I had a really great experience. The activities in the substance free dorm are the same as other dorms. if anything substance free is a lot cleaner.

i found a good group of friends who i’m living with next year, so its totally what you make of it"
berkeley,fo7vben,t1_fo7rf72,1587585162.0,"I personally took 16a last semester and although i didn’t like circuits or didn’t understand them by midterm 2, preparing for the final really allowed me to grasp some of the core ideas which really helped during the start of 16b"
berkeley,fo7jxu9,t3_g632e7,1587579607.0,"ee16a will give you a background in circuits which is very helpful for ee16b. if you are doubling in math, then take 54 and then you would just have to study circuits a bit for 16b. 

overall though 16a/b cover a lot of the material that will be foundational for future eecs courses, so i would highly recommend 16a over 54."
berkeley,fntxf9v,t3_g3d4th,1587250445.0,"Gomez is a great teacher. He sends out lecture notes days earlier and plans out the semester very fairly. Homework is not too heavy and he is very fair with midterm content. I have him for Math 53 right now and he has been super helpful during this tough time.

On top of this, Gomez also offers clobber policy(use grade on final as grade for midterm).

Would highly recommend!!"
