You pay August 2019-July 2020. But you dont have to pay August 2020 because you move out near the end of August 2020. (Unless you renewed). Think about the first August 2019 payment as establishing your financials for the first month of rent, it's just so ACC knows you have money to pay for the lease. So nope we dont get that first month back ever. You do however get the $250 security deposit when you move out. That's if there is no damages or repairs needed to be done."
