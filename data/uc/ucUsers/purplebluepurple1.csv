Just need to pass math 3A/b and PSTAT 109. Prioritize the econ classes! Grind hard the first couple classes so you can easily reduce the stress later! Getting an A in Econ 1 means you only need a B- in 2, 3A, 3B, and 10A, but still grind for those boys too!"

However, I’ve had friends who needed to spend more time studying for that class. 136a teaches some of the material that is the foundation of 134a, so it could help that you’d learn about discounting cash flows before both of the first midterms. Reinforces the material 

137a is not as demanding as 136a. 101 is not too bad either. But I don’t think 137a is a prerequisite to 136b anymore so you could take that at any time in the major. 

Definitely take 136a, 101, and one of the others if you don’t do both by doing all 4. If 137a is a prerequisite to 136b and I was incorrect, take 137a over 134a. 134a isn’t a prerequisite to any of the required classes left in the major. But since you’re able to take 134a, that means you got through 100b and 140a which are both more difficult than any of the classes you listed here.

134a is often taught by TA’s, but Hartman advises them and he writes the final. Went all quarter with Ryan just to see Hartman’s name on the final as the author. We were betrayed! It’s his class, but he sends out his army and commands from afar, spreading his blessings to us all."
