It's much, much harder to stay motivated doing this and you're more likely to lose focus after a month or two.

What you could do is try to meet people who are currently teaching, ask them how they got there and decide if you want to take the same route.

I minored in German in college, and sadly I'm still at a B1 with great reading skills but barely any listening skills.

exmormon,fpfvroi,t1_fpfc28e,1588585356.0,"Well, sort of.

""Proof"" isn't a thing in science. Except for formal sciences (math, theoretical physics, computer science, etc.), you never really prove anything. Modern science is built in the idea that we don't know anything for sure about the universe, which is why we create hypotheses, test our ideas, analyze data and end up with theories. Even when our theories are completely sound, like with germ theory, we still call them theories, not proofs, because we know that scientists are human and we're still learning.

Sorry to correct you, but it's a huge misunderstanding that fuels (Mormon) ignorance. I've had so many TBMs tell me that evolution is just a ""theory"" and that science hasn't proved anything. Well, they're technically right but completely wrong. Just because we haven't ""proved"" that vaccines cure diseases doesn't mean there's not a >99% chance that they do. Similarly, you can never ""prove"" that Joseph Smith was a fraud, but you can know through evidence and reasoning that he totally was one."

dankchristianmemes,fpec62a,t1_fpeb5xm,1588544603.0,"I don't see why not. Jesus frequently taught through parables and symbolism, and many of the prophets were shepherds or fishermen who didn't write the detailed, didactic lawyer-esque style which Paul used. So even though we have a portion of the Bible written by a lawyer-slash-ex-pharisee who gave a detailed explanation of salvation, most of our Bible isn't like that. When Jesus fulfilled the Law of Moses, He taught that a personal connection to God was more important than a detailed list of do's and don'ts, and thus modern Christians have to rely on the Holy Ghost and their God-given intuition rather than having prescribed answers for every single question.

Unfortunately, that has resulted in a fractured modern Christianity, where different denominations have vastly different answers for some important questions. Some churches rely on apostolic succession, some on sola scriptora and some on personal judgement. But overall, there is no one answer for every question in the Bible."

I think you can also get a recommendation from your doctor, they should have a list of references.

There's also a website I found later on that looks good where you enter your zip code and it gives you a list of licensed practitioners in your area. It looks pretty solid, at least at a starting point: https://www.therapyden.com/"
exmormon,forf7wg,t1_fords8o,1588011212.0,"Same. I wish that the church was a little more introvert friendly, since it tends to force members into socializing and public speaking. Then again, I guess that makes leaving easier for introverts which is better in the long run. I feel like the quarantine is for extroverts similar to a mission for introverts - being forced into a long-term uncomfortable lifestyle where your biggest destressor is taken away from you. Hopefully it all ends soon."
exmormon,foreg75,t1_foqvmsx,1588010838.0,"Genealogy itself isn't a waste of time, and I love the fact that I grew up knowing about my ancestors, where they lived and what they did over the past 300 years. Indexing, on the other hand, is the biggest waste. Hours and hours of trudging through old census records, doing basic data entry that'll be done automatically by computers in a couple years anyway, and making enough mistakes to make any ordinances invalid anyway. Especially when you find out how the church sells indexed data to Ancestry."
exmormon,fordx8m,t1_foqz4cf,1588010579.0,"One of my biggest surprises on this sub is how many people leave the church when they're in their 40's, 50's and 60's. I left in my early 20's and had friends who left as soon as they left home, and I heard over and over from parents and church leaders how leaving was the result of immaturity and inexperience, something I wouldn't have done if I'd married in the temple and raised a family in the church. Turns out they're wrong."
exmormon,forcxic,t3_g95lc6,1588010105.0,Yes; it's grown steadily for the past few years since I started following it.
exmormon,forc8ij,t1_foqn48q,1588009774.0,"In my experience, a lot of members really rely on the church for their social network and a lot of my friends/family miss going to church and seeing their friends. Even my family members who were complaining about their ward or the drama seem to have romanticized it all when they talk about wanting to go back. For people like them, they can't wait to get back to church or institute or activities and be around their social circle again."

cscareerquestions,for9ym8,t1_for5g1v,1588008678.0,"I second therapy, especially after I went to therapy during my first internship and it was amazing. I was really struggling with stress management, and through my work I found a therapist who had worked in the tech industry for years before switching his career and he specialized in career issues. I didn't even go for a long time, but the couple of sessions we had helped me realize some patterns in the way I reacted to stressful situations, and just helped me understand my emotions in general."

askgaybros,fonzexb,t1_fon5ega,1587929490.0,"I wouldn't call it a 'better' version of gaybros, or a 'worse' version. It's like you said, gaybros is more moderated and has more pictures and memes, while this sub is undmoderated and discussion-based. For me personally, I like both for different reasons."
Coronavirus,fohvnc6,t1_fohn2l1,1587773525.0,"Hopefully it's healthy food. I've worked in both a restaurant and a kitchen for the elderly (shoutout Meals on Wheels!), and they are so opposite when it comes to certain things. Salt? Bare minimum for elderly patients, throw it all in for restaurant food."

A lot of people go into computer science in college and are really surprised to see that kind of math pop up, especially for stuff like image processing and text processing. Google Translate? 5% linguistics, 95% calculus and linear algebra (meaning RIP my linguistics degree)."
news,fohuh4n,t1_fohpka9,1587772878.0,"Makes sense. I'm sure that there are a variety of crimes considered to be domestic abuse, some misdemeanors and some felonies. Sexual assault and assault with a deadly weapon can both be domestic violence, and I really hope there aren't states where those are only misdemeanors! But even some of those misdemeanors, if properly tried and convicted, should prevent you from being given weapons and opportunities to use them on a regular basis."
mormon,fohtuja,t1_fohqd5l,1587772535.0,"Disclaimer that this is what I commonly hear and not my own beliefs or reasoning. Essentially, the idea is that Adam and Eve symbolizes humans' relationship with god and that the creation story symbolizes the creation of human beings, however that occurred. Other Mormon beliefs don't hinge on it being literal, but they hinge on the things it implies - the existence of death, separation from God and an imperfect world. Even the references in the Book of Mormon, like ""Adam fell that men might be"", don't require a single human named Adam to have existed, but the human race in general to be fallen. People who I hear this from tend to say that similar events and references in scripture, like the flood, must have some degree of nonliteralism as well and that it's not possible to know where the literal history starts and the figurative history ends, and that it doesn't really matter.

In my opinion, I don't see it as a lack of critical thinking, more as a form of theistic agnosticism that's waaaay on the theistic end of the spectrum."
Coronavirus,fohsnp0,t1_fohlysp,1587771872.0,"What do you mean by ""move the timeline up""? I work with ML/NLP, and even though this field has made huge advancements in the past decade, state-of-the-art language models are still nowhere close to accomplishing some basic human tasks. Since we're reaching the hardware limits of Moore's Law, we won't be able to keep up our gains in computational power, and since most NLP gains have been made using massive deep learning models, hardware limits means there's an upper bound to what these models can accomplish. These models also aren't reliable and have many edge cases that are really tough to fix, and even the tasks they can do are still better performed by humans. Most importantly, these gains aren't cheap, meaning even the NLP tasks we can automate are still done by humans 99% of the time. It's like how most people use $1 hammers instead of $40 nail guns - just because better tech exists doesn't mean it's as cheap, available and versatile as the existing solution.

This means that simulated human speech - a basic, crucial task for most jobs - is still at the best decades away, and that's something that a five-year-old human can do. And this is just one field, a field which researchers have been working on since the earliest days of computing. If we've spent eighty years on this and we're not even at the skill level of a five-year-old human, how are we going to automate the dozens of ""soft skills"" that are infinitely more complex than this?

I don't see how the current situation is going to make this happen any faster. If anything, a rise in unemployment will increase the supply curve for the labor market, meaning companies can get labor even cheaper compared to investing in any kind of automation."
Coronavirus,fohqyns,t1_fohcd4d,1587770946.0,"Not to the same rate, but poverty will increase everywhere. To date, no country has actually implemented universal basic income, and even with safety nets, this pandemic will result in loss of jobs and thus increased unemployment. Of course, the wealthiest countries on the planet won't feel the pain as much as less wealthy countries, and less wealthy nations with socialized medicine and strong workers rights will still suffer. 

Even though the U.S. has horrible workers' rights and healthcare, it still has a lower percentage of people below the global poverty line than most other countries, including nearly half of the E.U.; infrastructure and policies can only go so far to curb poverty."
