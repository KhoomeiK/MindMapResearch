AnimalCrossing,fpmnxw6,t3_ge6ve9,1588737321.0,this happens to me more often than i’d like to admit
memes,fpceit1,t1_fpce3mh,1588497554.0,"Yeah this will definitely make governments rethink their pandemic response capabilities, and hopefully make them realize the value in investing in domestic threat prevention. But I think comparing the flu to coronavirus is minimizing the situation. The coronavirus is much more contagious, where an infected person can spread it on average to 2-3 times more people. So even if it has a lower chance to kill an individual, it has a much higher chance of spreading to someone who may not be able to fight it off. Plus a flu shot is a great prevention to the illness, and obviously we don’t have a covid cure yet."
memes,fpcdw9h,t1_fpcdjlf,1588496870.0,"Right, sure, but what even is? I don’t think that’s a good comparison. I’m sure most parents wouldn’t let their kids outside if their doctor told them they had a 1% chance of dying that day, so why do it now?"
deathgrips,fpcdbr1,t1_fpc930i,1588496247.0,yeah there’s a way to download files onto the desktop version which can be played on mobile. [Here’s a link to an article that gives steps.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/aminoapps.com/c/rap/amp/blog/how-to-add-mixtapes-to-spotify/V0r2_aWVI7u3DbrNjxzQP6w1xY2Jz04bjzp)

ucr,fod93qi,t1_fod8fkz,1587681794.0,Ok so then transfer to Berkeley since it has more “opportunities”
ucr,fod8897,t1_fod7jdf,1587681505.0,highest student homeless population XD vs having affordable housing at most other UC’s. Do you not like UCR or something?
ucr,fod7g9n,t1_fod6jrv,1587681191.0,"From the horror stories I heard from my high school teachers about Berkeley, I wouldn’t want to go even if I got a good scholarship."
ucr,foctnka,t3_g57gon,1587675709.0,"The housing portal is a good way to message people and start a conversation with people that have similar habits. But whoever you end up rooming with, make sure you get to know them pretty well before you commit."
ucr,focssxf,t3_g6e5z7,1587675371.0,"Undergraduate business degrees don’t really change from school to school so that shouldn’t be your basis for decision. I can’t speak on UCI or CSUF, but I know UCR has a lot of ways to connect with people through fraternities, clubs, and organizations. You should look into what kind of school environment you want before making a decision because those three schools have different cultures."

ACTrade,fnuqzc7,t3_g40a7q,1587268826.0,Walnut. I had Lolly as my first camper and I couldn’t be happier. She’s super cute and is always singing in the plaza or eating a sandwich under a tree.

ACTrade,fnjmoi8,t3_g24ufv,1587002210.0,"I really love Lolly she’s always singing around town and her catchphrase is super cute. My least favorite so far is Lionel because of his personality and design, but hopefully I can get him off my island soon."
ACTrade,fnjmepd,t3_g24ufv,1587002045.0,"I really love Lolly, she’s always singing around town and has different outfits every day. My least favorite so far is Lionel, i don’t like his personality and his design isn’t very nice."
Whatcouldgowrong,fniv3jh,t1_fnhwvym,1586986887.0,Good thing he had his face to break his fall.

AnimalCrossing,fmobq8k,t1_fmnygxt,1586252985.0,You seem like the type of person that buys a game and thinks it’s the best it can possibly be right out of the box. Plus your play style isn’t very appealing to a large majority of players.
deathgrips,fm8qcav,t1_fm88f67,1585854050.0,sounds fake but ok
