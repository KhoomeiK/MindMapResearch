I originally got into programming because I wanted to make video games but I ended up going with the standard software engineering job after getting a nice offer and learning what the game industry is like."

csMajors,fmpi7yp,t3_fwo9zw,1586281295.0,"TLDR: I made games and had fun. Make what you actually want to make so you have fun.


All of my side projects were video games. They were made in Unity, OpenGL and plain C++. I loved working on them and would often get lost in making them and end up working several hours in one sitting accidently. While I didn't learn any ML/Blockchain/yourfavoritebuzzword, I still learned a lot of other relevant things that I can now explain in depth.

Make your side projects what your passionate about instead of trying to show off some cool technology you learned. Makes talking about them to recruiters way easier and as a result you show some personality.

If you need to use some popular technology for your side project then great, but I know that if I forced myself to make a project using one of those it would be terrible. I would dread working on the project and I honestly probably wouldn't even finish it."
