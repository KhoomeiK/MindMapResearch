headphones,fove6sx,t1_fo3msz3,1588099822.0,"I returned mine right away, rash is still there but subsiding (7 days out). Did you find another pair of over-ear headphones that didn't give you a rash? I'm nervous to purchase any now for fear that I'm allergic to the pleather material."
UCDavis,fovcr6a,t1_fos28l1,1588099140.0,"Funny thing, but some insight from professors I'm friends with (I'm a grad student at UCD) - they don't always make very much money and can struggle with rent just the same as students. Especially lecturers (whose only job is to teach AKA no research) like Dr. Ochoa and Dr. Enderle - they probably get paid closer to $60k depending on length of time they've worked. And with possible families to care for, that's not much in California. So they seriously deserve a job-well-done if they're trying to handle the situation the best they can rn."
headphones,fo3h4t6,t3_f7fk91,1587486813.0,Any updates on figuring this out? I woke up this morning with the same rash from the same headphones and I'm really bummed that it may be the headphones. How soon did the rash clear up? Did you have to get a prescription to clear it?
