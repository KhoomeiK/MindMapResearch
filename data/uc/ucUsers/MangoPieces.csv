gradadmissions,fo7vej5,t1_fo7rt3o,1587585205.0,Please PM me HAHA
gradadmissions,fo7kxui,t1_fo7gufu,1587580094.0,"Thank you for such a thorough answer! If you feel comfortable sharing, which program are you attending?
I’m debating whether to take the GRE because most programs here doesn’t require it. I also don’t have any relevant experience other than working as a PTaide (since I was pre-pa) before. But through that I got a lot of patient care experience. Is that relevant?"
GradSchool,fo2ffwd,t1_fo2efs2,1587460355.0,Does it matter who you get the letters from as long as they’re good? I go to a pretty big public uni so it’s been hard trying to get close with any profs. I did take a cc class where it was a much smaller size and I feel like he can write me a good letter. I also am planning on asking my supervisor from the PT clinic I work at but I’m not sure if these are good enough?
love,fnzzy5p,t1_fnyz59o,1587403668.0,Then I think you should choose to believe him because this would just make you more stressed out
UCSD,fnyv1a0,t3_g4oy3q,1587376729.0,I would highly recommend to talk to the financial aide office through their virtual advising hours. HDH is kind of a mess right now but I think everything should be processed at this point
LongDistance,fnyuypp,t3_g4iqbt,1587376652.0,I used to feel this way until I got busy and I understood why my SO didn’t have the time to reply to me in such a speedy way. My solution is to just text him what’s on my mind and have him text me back whenever he is free. I also feel like some ppl prefer calling/FaceTiming so that’s what we substituted instead.
love,fnyussd,t3_g4mxvf,1587376473.0,I think you should talk to him and communicate exactly what you’re feeling. Tell him that you do feel this shift in energy even if he might not be doing it on purpose.
love,fnyuo0m,t3_g4p6oz,1587376328.0,I would recommend to give her some space and kind of figure out when is the right time to talk to her and not end up as a rebound. Also be confident! I’m sure she’s not just dating them for superficial reasons even though it may seem like that’s the reason why everyone is dating in hs. I’d recommend giving her time
love,fnyuedj,t3_g4nu6b,1587376037.0,"I used to believe that soulmates existed until I met my current SO and I think that soulmates are created. You adjust to your partners’ needs and become a better partner over time, which increases that compatibility."
psychotherapy,fnxoll3,t1_fnnjadp,1587343039.0,Are these programs competitive to get into (I.e. is there a place where I can find applicant stats on this Reddit for MFTs)?
psychotherapy,fnxnn9y,t3_g1u70j,1587342456.0,"I’m currently majoring in Clinical Psychology and Minoring in Bio. My original plan was to pursue a masters in physician assistant but after completing clinical hours I realize that maybe that career path is not for me. It’s not what I envisioned myself doing and the stuff that I’m learning to fulfill my pre-reqs are not things that I’m interested in learning for another 2 yrs. 
Since I’ve only made this decision recently, I wanted to get more information about this career path so any advice would be helpful! 
- I’m a current third in college 
- I’m not planning on taking a gap year so I’m probably going to study for the GRE during this summer 
- my major GPA is higher than my overall GOA bc because of orgo and all the pre-pa classes I had to take, so my overall gpa is around a 3.2 rn (without some classes I took at a cc) but I’m confident I can get it to around 3.4 by senior year. My major gpa is at 3.85+ 
How much does GPA matter for MFT programs because I know my general gpa is on the lower side for PA programs 
- Are there pre-requisite courses that I need to take? Or should they mostly be covered by the courses I’m already taken? 
- What’s a “good” score for the GRE? 
- Are there more competitive programs than others or are all programs good as long as you get into one? 
- I’ve been in therapy for a couple months now which helped me realized that I enjoy talk therapy a lot. Before quarantine, I also worked as a PT aide where I learned that I value patient interaction a lot and frankly, being a PA is not going to allow me to have this kind of relationship with my patients (around 150+ hours).
I have been a RA for the past two years and I’m also serving on leadership for a pre-med org and work as a illustrator for a magazine on campus. Previously I also have experience as a intern for the administration office on campus. 
Any other advice would really be appreciated because I’m not sure where to look right now. Thank you!"

Unemployment,fmamvvv,t1_fm5qa8w,1585899797.0,I think you will. I filled out the form online and it gives a option for that.
