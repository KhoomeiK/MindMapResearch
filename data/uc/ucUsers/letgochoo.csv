Alot of people are struggling and alot of people still have to go through classes with a letter grade, you guys are not the only ones suffering. Everything has its time and place, this is definitely not one of them."
UCSantaBarbara,fo4cfj4,t1_fo4bo26,1587501939.0,"Biggest advice for 1A is to just stay on-top of your work. Whatever you do, don’t start to procrastinate because then it will just be a downward spiral from there. The class itself is not difficult, its just dense. Start preparing for your exams REALLY early on and you should be fine. Never went to CLAS and still did pretty good in the class"
UCSantaBarbara,fo35rak,t3_g5e5sp,1587481060.0,Please dont come here rn. Take a virtual tour. Literally everything and anything is closed
UCSantaBarbara,fo35j85,t3_g5bu6s,1587480941.0,Econ is not is not the only department sticking to letter grade. The bio department (eemb/mcdb) didnt cave in
UCSantaBarbara,fo28sin,t3_g5aihi,1587453434.0,"Its kinda dense to study all last min but honestly, it depends on how she decides to test us. It can either be a super easy A or actually quite difficult. The good thing is that she lets you know exactly what to study"
UCSantaBarbara,fo26any,t3_g5a20x,1587451093.0,"Literally book problems, book problems and book problems. I never really did them until the ladder half of gen chem going to ochem, and looking back I highly regret. Exposing yourself to the material over and over again is your best bet. It may be time consuming but in the long run its worth it."
UCSantaBarbara,fo0d7wn,t1_fnyk7bi,1587410806.0,"I take my word back, bless Kelly. That was actually a super reasonable exam"
UCSantaBarbara,fnyiunw,t3_g4myfg,1587364448.0,I already know kelly about to fuck us over
UCSantaBarbara,fnx3i5a,t3_g4espb,1587330756.0,"Im not to too sure if its possible. The only way to do it would be to withdraw before the start of the quarter and apply for the readmission for winter. The catch is that for readmission to ucsb you have to have an established record with the school and be in good standing, ie atleast 1 quarter with above a 2.0 GPA

UCSantaBarbara,fnll49g,t3_g26t3k,1587055393.0,I dont know if ft has surf racks but its a straight shot to sands which would be ideal

UCSantaBarbara,fnffout,t1_fneqgzx,1586907162.0,Its a whole other breed
UCSantaBarbara,fn82thc,t1_fn7u6po,1586732716.0,Why didnt you take physics at a CC? Where you not able to or just chose not too?
UCSantaBarbara,fmnfc9j,t1_fmmlmrj,1586224777.0,Its so unfair that we basically had the same quiz yet we had 20 min while lewis gave his clas like an hour and half
UCSantaBarbara,fmmzsfv,t3_fw6lmx,1586215245.0,Definitely harder than I expected. Went in very confident and came out feeling like shit
UCSantaBarbara,fmlzjsa,t3_fw27jg,1586196024.0,That sounds like a headache waiting to happen
UCSantaBarbara,fmkjt73,t3_fvtxmk,1586157401.0,"Im in gainer but we have relatively a similar structure. We have weakly videos that correspond to the readings in the text book. Our grades are broken down into 48% weekly quizzes, 20% mastering chem, 20% participation in a weekly section, and 12% essays. The grading scale might change though depending on if we have a final or not"
