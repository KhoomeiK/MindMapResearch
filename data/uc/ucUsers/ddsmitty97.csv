Our university is so blind to making money that it's going to cause more damage than good. Our state leaders made a bunch of claims they can't fulfill. And then Our Federal government has botched this in too many ways to count. With all of this in mind, most Americans are no longer rational about this. They want a test, but can't get one. They want to get unemployement but can't. I believe that the cost of this alone already has been so high that it's going to be difficult to get more aid. Instead, you will see the Duffus in Chief demand people back to work (for example, meat workers). All virus facts and data aside, people are no longer being rational about this. They are no longer thinking about what the virus is and can do their bodies but what it's doing to their wallets. 

Additionally, I really would be super careful about the university continuing to claim online education is the way to go because of equal access to education. Simply put, digital and economic gaps exist where they can create situations where students are being deprived to equal access to education. 

As sad and despotic it's going to sound, the best metric for our country opening up is how much economic damage has been done."
berkeley,eol0khw,t3_bqznor,1558664147.0,I am having the same issue. It's not because you have to do extra tasks for your loans. I am going down to talk to FinAid to sort it out.
