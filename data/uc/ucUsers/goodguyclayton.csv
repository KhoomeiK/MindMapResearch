UCSC,fovhjfj,t3_g9t4q5,1588101422.0,"Itd be easier to answer if we knew more about interests you career wise or in general. Not gonna be one of those people that just throws out ""everybody should learn to code"" and I dont know much about BME. Regardless in many engineering fields especially more on the research side knowing how to code is a extremely valuable skill. for example when analyzing large amounts of data it will give you a big leg up as I'm sure sometimes just dropping it all in a spreadsheet wont be enough. If anything it will definately boost the resume so I'd say if you're interested give it a shot"

UCSC,fn2bzjj,t3_fyvih7,1586583876.0,"I agree for the most part but after all computer science != software engineering, we are being exposed to a much wider variety of knowledge than we would have in a software engineering program for better or worse. However I personally believe the most important part of college is just learning the basics and learning how to learn. The theory can really force you to think hard sometimes, feel really stupid, maybe question your existence, but I think the benefits you gain from that mental tortur are those you just dont get when your googling how to do this or that In python"

UCSC,fmy5nn5,t3_fy10rz,1586478647.0,I've noticed the few black students that I know tend to all hang out in groups together so if ur talking finding circle like that it might be ok but honestly like others have said its overwhelmingly white and the worst part is liberals use your skin color to push their agenda you can expect to constantly see white kinds talking about what's its like to be black and trying so hard to not be racist it actually backfires and becomes racist lol
