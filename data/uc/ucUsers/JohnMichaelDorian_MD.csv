nfl,fpjhio8,t1_fpjfhgb,1588668705.0,I mean the same could be said about working for a prestigious tech company. But sometimes with prestige comes demanding bosses. I’m sure it’s great winning rings though so I can’t speak to that
nfl,fpjhd2k,t1_fpjgnde,1588668537.0,Ay let me weave my metaphor haha
nfl,fpjbc6m,t3_gdncn5,1588662442.0,The Patriots are the Amazon of the NFL. Looks great on your resume (if you’re in tech) but the pay is shit and the management is demanding

nfl,fphyzh8,t1_fphx42s,1588630437.0,"Don’t kid yourself, Josh Allen has a way higher ceiling than Dilfer ever did. He has potential to be a good or great QB. If he needs a stacked team to get the job done, so be it"
nfl,fphrq0m,t1_fph2s1d,1588626592.0,"Jim Kelly is a hall of famer. If JA ever reaches that level and leads a stacked team to many Super Bowls, then I’ll call that a win."
nfl,fphreze,t1_fphibm7,1588626430.0,"It’s just a meme, your fanbase is young and Seattle is full of young people. It’s an easy assumption to make"
nfl,fph1588,t1_fpgw4ca,1588613126.0,"I’d argue that lots of QBs went from being inaccurate to good. Jim Kelly for example. His first couple of seasons were abysmal on film. JA has a long way to go, but he also has arguably the strongest arm in the league, spiral or not. If he had a noodle arm and was lazy and didn’t want to be coached, yeah I’d write him off. But he’s got lots of physical and mental aptitude. I could see him reach Wentz levels in the next few seasons."
nfl,fph0lwt,t1_fpgp2sk,1588612857.0,That “some” was Randy Moss too haha
nfl,fph060k,t1_fpfpgjz,1588612630.0,It’s an internet meme from back when the Seahawks were the best team in the NFL. I think the “We Are 12” slogan the team used didn’t help
nfl,fpf786y,t1_fpdrqs7,1588563465.0,Thanks :) we haven’t been to too many playoffs in your lifetime sadly

nfl,fopsd0l,t1_fonvk0s,1587970561.0,"To be fair to him though, he’s one of the best recruiters in the country which *is* important in CFB."
nfl,footom4,t1_fooj3u8,1587946241.0,"I dig Asiasi he torched my Cal Bears and he seems like generally a freak. And NGL I wanted the Bills to take Dugger. My one pause about that pick was that he went about a round higher than I anticipated. But that’s ok I guess, if he ends up being a stud none of that matters."
nfl,foob0wg,t1_fonjsig,1587935821.0,Lmao as if anyone in Bill B’s defense “has a position.” I don’t think the Pats had a great draft but Uche was a great pick
nfl,fooaiuh,t1_fonmd0g,1587935580.0,Hmm sounds like a receiver name... /s

buffalobills,foltwij,t1_foki6de,1587870378.0,"Per Sal Capaccio, the roster increase to 55 this year only applies on **game day** and only applies to players on the practice squad. So effectively, a player on the practice squad can be called up for a single day and then sent back down. The effective roster limit is still 53"
buffalobills,fol29dk,t1_fok6tr8,1587853462.0,"To be fair, back then retweets were glorified copy pastes. So they “looked” more like he wrote it."

AZCardinals,fokxg3d,t1_foksn82,1587850792.0,Go Bears!
AZCardinals,fokxf0s,t3_g80zq7,1587850776.0,"Yooooo you guys got a dog! Cal fan here, I loved Weaver so much because he plays old school. He plays like he’s got a screw loose and just wants to kill everyone who gets in his way. Led the nation in tackles and set a school record. His coverage was solid at a college level, might not translate to the NFL because he lacks elite athleticism. But that said, he should’ve never dropped to round 6."
buffalobills,fokmddn,t3_g7uvok,1587844771.0,Please Evan Weaver
buffalobills,foklrt3,t1_fokhwub,1587844447.0,I don’t think many people had him as an early second. I don’t remember many mocks with him that high.
buffalobills,fokhmtj,t1_fokh79a,1587842232.0,Yeah and I guess he’s only basically a 6th round pick this late in the draft. Still I wish we had picked up a linebacker or OL
buffalobills,fokhhuc,t1_fokh55q,1587842160.0,Yeah fair point. I wasn’t sure how many extra spots got added. 3 is possible but that might mean having to cut a talented WR or OL which is kinda scary to me. I guess Yeldon is long gone so that’s good at least
buffalobills,fokhc30,t1_fokh443,1587842076.0,I’d rather keep Barkley as happy as possible because he’s been an awesome positive person in our locker room but I do see your point
buffalobills,fokh2xi,t1_fokgokm,1587841938.0,"We’re a playoff team, no way in hell do we carry 3 QBs unless rosters get significantly expanded"
buffalobills,fokgxbk,t3_g7uvok,1587841857.0,"Not a fan of this pick tbh. We already have Barkley, who may not be an elite backup but is a great locker room presence. Plus I don’t really think Fromm is very good at all from what I’ve seen of him. He’s a winner, sure I guess. This feels like a waste of a 5th though and I’ve loved every pick before this one"
buffalobills,foibzm9,t3_g7hlni,1587783151.0,So pumped for Zach Moss. Exactly who I wanted us to take. He'll be a good compliment to Motor.
buffalobills,foibqul,t3_g7hlni,1587782992.0,"Lots of people said we were moving up? That never happened, I'm confused lol"
buffalobills,foi6e5o,t1_foi647h,1587779664.0,To be fair Davis is not really a safety. More of a gadget ST player who plays defense. Can play WR too lol
buffalobills,foi67pz,t1_foi64l2,1587779555.0,He's half white iirc
buffalobills,foi62wy,t3_g7hlni,1587779474.0,Fuck the Jetes picked my man Davis.
buffalobills,foi4y25,t3_g7hlni,1587778797.0,Jeez Ashtyn Davis is falling hard. That's surprising.

buffalobills,foi1psh,t3_g7hlni,1587776924.0,I love how far Mims is falling. He was PFF's third ranked WR and clearly NFL talent evaluators disagree.
buffalobills,foi1man,t1_foi1i6m,1587776868.0,Or pick up Hyde
buffalobills,fohzsld,t3_g7hlni,1587775836.0,Epenesa learning from Mario Addison is gonna be legit.

Edit: pick is now in guess nothing blew them away."
buffalobills,fohy9yq,t3_g7hlni,1587774995.0,Zach Baun would be a pick I wouldn't mind. Epenesa and Dobbins too.
nfl,fohuelp,t3_g7jiro,1587772840.0,These dead relative stories just get more and more absurd. Slipped on gravel and got hit by an oncoming car? Struck by lightning? Wtf
buffalobills,fohqpix,t1_fohq50d,1587770806.0,I think it’s just awkward standing in front of a TV screen announcing picks. He’s used to having a crowd in front of him. Must be a awkward adjustment

buffalobills,fohq8ci,t1_fohq5j4,1587770544.0,I bet they’re pissed about having to wait this long to be picked. I’m excited for chips on shoulders kinda guys

nfl,fo9tfus,t1_fo9d73q,1587630545.0,Connor Cook was one bust that I actually called. I’ve been terrible at evaluating QBs but Cook I had a gut feeling about and was actually right. Something something broken clocks..

nfl,fo250jc,t1_fo0hapr,1587449922.0,I feel like Yannick was digging his own grave perfectly well before Khan replied. This feels like when someone is about to self-KO in Smash and some other guy comes in and tries to spike them and dies in the process too. It’s just a shit show for both parties
nfl,fo24v26,t1_fo06221,1587449788.0,Meh Jerry is all about his clients getting paid. Khan’s interest isn’t quite the same here
nfl,fo24p91,t1_fo1wijt,1587449643.0,"I agree. I think he had the opportunity to make Yannick look really bad by just letting him dig his own grave. But he dragged himself down to Yannick’s level by engaging in the back and forth.

nfl,fo1tps9,t1_fo0iy3h,1587441296.0,"NFL teams also use GoToMeeting internally. My guess is that they’ll use MSFT for the draft tho, as a sponsorship/publicity opportunity for MSFT teams. Or perhaps some AWS solution like Chime because AWS is also a sponsor.

nfl,fnwjler,t1_fnvmv7u,1587319616.0,"I guess my point was that if you picked an arbitrary series of 13 wins and losses, you could make the same “1 in 8192” claim and I kinda wonder if you could get upvotes from people who don’t think too deeply on why that is.

You are right though, I kinda did miss the point of the post. I suppose I was just baiting someone into replying to me like /u/iamaiamscat, who clearly failed stats"
nfl,fnwisit,t1_fnvowoc,1587319175.0,"Yeah that’s fair. It’s 13x more likely to have a single win than go winless. I wouldn’t say it’s pointless though, any single specific series of wins and losses is very “rare” but we usually don’t “care” about them unless it’s all wins or all losses. No one cares about the specific order but if we did then we’d be lauding other combinations as rare. I guess my point is that the headline/title  isn’t as interesting as it tries to be."
