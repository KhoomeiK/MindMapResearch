Dogtraining,fpl0t67,t3_ge2a5t,1588704376.0,"You wrote a little too much for me to digest, but here's some thoughts.

Dogs in a shelter can be very nervous. It's an unfamiliar place with a lot of noise and people. Not even taking into account the dog's background, many dogs are nervous, use submissive posture, and display anxious behavior.

It can take months after you bring a shelter dog home for them to warm up to you. Some may relax and a whole new personality shows through! Others will not and will remain anxious for a very long time. I cannot tell you which of these the dog may be.

My thought is that you need to seriously consider this before taking the dog home. You say he is 'perfect' but I'm not sure what your basis is there.

It will likely take this dog a very long time and a lot of patience to come out of his shell. A few visits at the shelter will not be enough. Judging by your lifestyle, this may not be the right dog for you. Maybe you could talk to the shelter about transition time? (Many understand that it takes some time to learn if a shelter dogs personally fits into your family. Some will allow you to return them or help find a new owner is it's not.)"

It's as nasty as it sounds, but it is alcohol"
HomeImprovement,foq2wty,t3_g8rqmg,1587981033.0,"Been trying to get my patio garden usable. It's on the North side of my condo, has fence around it, and two trees on the East end. Been feeding the pillbugs there to get it nice & already spread in the fertilizer, but the dirt patch doesn't get any sun. After clipping the hell out of the trees, I think it's a complete lost cause without pulling them out and there's no way landlord would be down for that. Oh well for my vegetable garden, guess I got to look up ""Plants that grow in full-shade."" ðŸ˜©"
college,foq2co3,t3_g8l0m6,1587980444.0,"I majored in -thing that would make me money- and I really hate my life. Wish I followed my dreams, but I was tired of being dirt poor. Felt like I didn't disserve it. Basically learned from college with a great engineering program that no one -deserves- better pay based off their major. The majority are blessed that their high school offered advanced math/science programs that got them here, parents who studied engineering and taught them, and financial support from said parents. I don't know any engineers at my school whose parents are not either engineers or doctors.

Computer science engineers don't work harder than fast food workers, they aren't better than someone else, just someone values their work more. It's more 'niche'.

Glad you're doing what feels right."
Skincare_Addiction,foew392,t3_fyt3b2,1587716798.0,I use a hand sanitizer with aloe vera in it. Really seems to help prevent this. You could also try wearing gloves instead of sanitizing for a little while.

alexa,fnv83fz,t1_fnh2re0,1587283518.0,"My Amazon music subscription for my Alexa is $4 a month.

Honestly it's worth it to get her to play the song I actually asked for and not a cover band.

Are you frustrated enough to get Alexa to shut the hell up for $4?
The selection on Amazon music is pretty decent. Honestly like them better then Spotify because they don't spontaneously change my music playlist to top 10 pop songs on repeat without me ever asking thanks Spotify."
