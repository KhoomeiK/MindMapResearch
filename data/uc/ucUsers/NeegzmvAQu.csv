UCSD,fpixtaa,t3_gdq640,1588651290.0,"Honestly I think you should not worry as bio isn't as gard to switch into as some other majors, namely any major under Jacobs. That being said just get a solid GPA in the screening courses and you should be set. Also I would not say Bio, or human bio, is particularly difficult compared to some other majors. I am not saying biology is easier than Physics, math, engineering, or other more quantitative disciplines, however,  most more memory based courses are easier as long as you put in the effort. Do not be discouraged and pursue your passion. Gl!"
UCSD,fpfopeu,t1_fpfoj67,1588578048.0,Oh that's unfortunate. Tough professors are a bummer but don't worry 1 class doesn't determine who you are. Honestly I would just suggest you take as much math and statistics as possible. UCSD requires you take 3 Econometrics courses (120abc) however they let you substitute 120a with math 180a. Make sure to do this. Also if you can pick up some coding/programming knowledge. Software like R is very useful in Economics and you will encounter it later on. If you have any more Qs feel free to reach out. Gl!
UCSD,fpfnx1l,t1_fpfnocs,1588577271.0,"If you plan to go to graduate school as you say I highly recommend a minor in Math. I would recommend these classes specifically: Math 20CD, Math 18, Math 109, Math 140a/142a (142 is less rigorous but both are good for econ grad school), Math 170ab, Math 180a, Math 180b. Also what do you mean your professor is tough? For which class?"
UCSD,fpfn9ko,t1_fpfn3kf,1588576646.0,"Well I can speak for a PhD and most masters programs. 10C will not suffice for any graduate work in economics. The bare minimum math needed for Economics graduate school is single variable calculus, multivariable calculus, ODEs,  and Linear Algebra. Remember this is the minimum. Most take classes in proofs, analysis, algebra, statistics, probability, etc."
UCSD,fpfmzlr,t1_fpfmx9l,1588576383.0,And a phd or masters?
UCSD,fpfmn3o,t3_gd6j8l,1588576051.0,What is the grad school for? Econ?
UCSD,fpaggwz,t1_fpafkrj,1588447666.0,It depends. A W is better than a D or F if it is for grad school purposes. Even though it can later be replaced in your gpa Grad schools look at transcripts. A couple Ws mean nothing in the long especially during a time like this.
UCSD,fp7fxm4,t3_gbr045,1588369885.0,"I would probably suggest being proficient in programming (Python , C++, Java) while also being familiar with data structures and computer organization. Algorithms are also useful especially for genetics and molecular biology.

Courses at UCSD would be: 
Programming (Java): CSE 8AB/11
Computer organization: CSR 30
Data structures: CSE 12+15L, CSE 100 
Algorithms: CSE 101 

If you can't take all those then I would take CSE 8AB/11, CSE 12+15L, and CSE 30. Then I would simply read up on advanced data structures and algorithm design. Gl!"
UCSD,fp5040z,t3_gbcgtx,1588312146.0,I'm really sorry for what happened to you. I'm not sure what advice I can offer but I would say just hang in there and be tough. You've got this.
UCSD,fp3xvqy,t3_gb564t,1588287852.0,I dont think it is a 0.0. 0.0 would mean it would impact your cumulative gpa. It is simply NA.
UCSD,fp3qwf1,t1_fp3qayg,1588284168.0,I wouldn't worry too much. Maybe you could explain tjat you in fact did achieve an A in those classes and even get a professor to vouch for you. Don't worry!
UCSD,fp3pvk0,t1_fp3pqlt,1588283644.0,"Hmmm a PhD likely requires a fair amount of statistics therefore math might be an issue, however, you can address this and take another math class now. Science it depends but generally Biology/biochemistry/ etc are useful for psych grad school."
UCSD,fp3po0q,t1_fp3plx0,1588283539.0,Are you going for a phd or masters?
UCSD,fp3pefz,t3_gb50hf,1588283402.0,Depends on what they are in and depends on the specific programs you are referring to.
UCSD,fp3ng25,t1_fp3klv8,1588282403.0,It was moved I'm pretty sure?
UCSD,fp3hchi,t3_gb32m0,1588279317.0,Layout is like HW and quizzes. I'm not sure why but an email was sent.
UCSD,fp3gqr1,t1_fp3f7cm,1588279016.0,Your schlong lives in R1 :) no width or thickness
UCSD,fp3frt9,t1_fp3f7cm,1588278537.0,No i just prefer perpendicular schlong

UCSD,fo9dqbp,t3_g6ga4x,1587616739.0,"I don't know too much, however, I do know that UCSD has a well respected Political Science department with excellent faculty and is usually ranked highly in the nation (US News has it as a top 10 department). Data analytics is not a math heavy major at all, but I believe you will be exposed to some statistics. You could also take Political science courses on game theory."
UCSD,fo5d6ps,t3_g5sobf,1587522841.0,If you plan on going to grad school then yes it seems necessary. Math graduate school is rather competitive with many students taking graduate courses in their undergrad. The Math GRE subject test also tests content from the 3rd quarter of analysis and algebra so you should take it if you ever decide grad school is what you want to do.
UCSD,fo1im35,t1_fo1ikkf,1587434091.0,Np!
UCSD,fo1ie90,t1_fo1i7e7,1587433954.0,If the application isn't running then no they can't. Since you said you cleared it then in fact they could not. That is the equivalent of you shutting down the app which also would mean you left the meeting as leaving the meeting is a subset of closing the application such that if the app is closed and no longer running then it follows that you have left the meeting. Hope that helps
UCSD,fo1hv3c,t3_g5644w,1587433624.0,"What do you mean by still see you? Was your camera enabled? If so and you were still by the iPad then technically yes they could. However, by default most zoom lectures have the camera disabled so if that is the case then no. Don't sweat it though."
memes,fno1thm,t3_g2xbaf,1587108991.0,Wrong subreddit

UCSD,fnj7wjm,t1_fnj7hjw,1586993654.0,I'm curious what book do you guys use for this class
UCSD,fnivy27,t3_g21hff,1586987312.0,Ling 8 is fairly low in workload
UCSD,fnip0o2,t3_g20bu4,1586983824.0,"If you have taken the 31 series there is no need to take Math 109, you already have exposure to proofs. Judging by the fact that Math 120a does not have Math 109 OR 140a prereqs, in fact you have more exposure than is required. You should go for it if you are interested in taking it."
UCSD,fn1kkta,t3_fys6qu,1586563995.0,What classes are you taking damn
UCSD,fmt8wxn,t3_fxb0vy,1586368747.0,"The Management Science B.S. is a more quantitative and finance focused version of the Economics B.A. It is not a Business Administration degree by any means, it is simply an Economics and Finance Bachelor of Science. The degree requires Math 20abc and math 18(linear algebra) so Single variable calculus and some of multivariable calculus along with linear algebra. The degree also requires some finance/accounting courses which can be practical and help you get a job. Hope that helps and if you need anything else feel free to Pm!"
UCSD,fmhd62v,t3_fva7jz,1586075308.0,And why can't you dress like this lol?
