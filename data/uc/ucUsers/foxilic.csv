UCI,fp3s43e,t1_fp3s0hc,1588284796.0,It‚Äôs ridiculous! Might as well use respondus cause I literally have no time to look at my book or notes lol
UCI,fp3pndd,t1_fp3mged,1588283529.0,"By the way, we have an exam tomorrow in Sato‚Äôs class and he is administering it in the most torturous way ever. This man gives us a 45min exam with vaguely worded questions (he says it‚Äôs made to be a 30min exam). Open note open book which honestly does not matter because we do not have any time. Why do we not have any time? Oh i‚Äôll tell you check this out. In efforts of preventing cheating, he expects us to have a word document open on the side to explain our answers and turn in before the 50min mark into ‚Äúturnitin‚Äù. AND if we are not able to turn it in by the deadline (before exam time runs our) we get half credit on each question we got right. So say you got all the questions right but your wifi goes out trying to turn in the document.. you basically fail."
UCI,fp3o4da,t1_fp3mged,1588282753.0,"Nah this is molecular bio lecture. Basically the professors are not giving any info about the content, and if they do it is very basic stuff we already know that does not prepare us for exams. Lectures are 10min long videos of them reading off slides and not answering their own questions or explaining the important details of mechanisms. The exams on the other hand are tricky: majority of questions are experimental based questions that are ‚Äúselect all answers that apply‚Äù. Sometimes you will see an answer that is correct based off of lecture content but based on the experimental data you can‚Äôt fully assume it‚Äôs correct even though it‚Äôll show small pieces of evidence saying it is, leaving us in a mental battle to gamble whether it‚Äôs right or wrong (most of us guess wrong). For example we had a question that shows data of 5 cases of adding different dNTPs to have replication in vitro. Case 1: dCTP (no DNA) = 0umol replication. Case 2: dCTP + dATP + DNA = 2.5umol . Case 3: dCTP + dGTP + dATP + DNA = 7umol. Anyways you get the trend. I chose two answer choices to explain this data: 1) You need template DNA for replication (since case 1 had no DNA and there was no replication)
2) you need all four dNTPs for replication


Apparently my first answer is wrong even though the experiment clearly shows what happens when we do not add DNA. 

That‚Äôs just one example of a question. Imma stop here because i‚Äôll start venting. 

I‚Äôm paying these professors to teach me, and they have the easiest job in the world. They don‚Äôt teach, canvas grades everything for them, you ask questions and instead of answering they sit back and tell you to think about it and then give you a basic answer that isn‚Äôt even close to an exam level explanation."
UCI,fp3ls6j,t3_gb2qaq,1588281555.0,Literally the same thing is happening in Sato‚Äôs class. I hate it
UCI,fow87yk,t3_g9v1br,1588114822.0,I sent them an email and they said they automatically refunded a while back if you purchased one
UCI,fomonlm,t3_g89peu,1587898125.0,I‚Äôm a bio major who took 5 classes last quarter and part of two research groups. I excelled last quarter given that i studied 80+ hours a week. This quarter i‚Äôm only taking 3 classes and feel like i‚Äôm working MORE than i did last quarter. This online bullshit is honestly pissing me off. Professors are definitely assigning more work than before.
UCI,foj15ho,t3_g7pcmb,1587804267.0,"Last year i got the email on April 2nd. It‚Äôs probably different this year with this whole situation happening so i wouldn‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll get it :)"
UCI,fnbyg8v,t1_fnbxxr8,1586824842.0,Yes but if my class is supposed to only be 50min long.. they shouldn‚Äôt post two 40min long mandatory yuja lectures on each day of class lol. They should be limited to the time frames listed on the schedule of classes.
