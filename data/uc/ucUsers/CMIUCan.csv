Pros : 

-Amazing instincts

-Gets to the ball on pretty much every run play/short passes


Cons

-Slow

-Often gets beat at the point of attack. Lots of third and short situations that gets converted because Weaver doesn't have the physicality to put the guy on his ass like every nfl LB can easily do"

The Real Salesian High School in Richmond

i was a student at Salesian high school in Richmond and graduated in 06. the story actually goes that a priest hung himself on the fourth floor, God knows how long ago. but the staff and faculty block off the fourth floor and students are NOT allowed up there at any time. even thought most people do at one point or another during their time there. It is REALLY creepy. but you feel like whenever the halls, on any floor, are empty you are being watched or followed. and if you leave the school when the lights are shut off mid-day...well i never walked out of there...i literally jogged. my old health/P.E. teacher actually told us that she was working late one night and the lights on the second floor flickered on and off and some of the doors opened and closed again on their own. even one of the other teachers, who is a BIG but sweet, funny guy, hates it when he forgets papers at school and has to come back at NIGHT and get them...he told our senior religion class he gets scared....salesian high school may look pretty...but if you know the building and you have psychics in your family...you learn a little more there than just what they teach out of the books. ACTUALLY, sorry i know this is long but i have another story :) they take roll before each class to make sure nobody ditches, but one day an off duty teacher was getting the roll sheats from the class, and she was going down the stairway closer to the deans office, on the third floor going down, but she saw two young boys in old lettermen sweaters...but it didnt click in her mind at the time...she asked, ""why arent you two in class?..."" and this story was told to us by a teacher who has NEVER lied to his students. but he told us that they looked at her, laughed, and dissapeared........SCARY!!!!! i would have ran out...but i found this out the end of my senior year....so i just decided to stick out the last couple months and when the bell rings get out...first LoL :) but thats¬† what i know about my high school...if you would like to email me back you are more than welcome to :)"

I'm not exactly sure why that is, but the only reason I can come up with is that I saw Quarantine first and REC after. Otherwise, REC is pretty much universally acclaimed while Quarantine is often mixed/hated.

Edit: alright cool so I'm definitely not the only person on the planet who thinks so, cheers üòÅ"
