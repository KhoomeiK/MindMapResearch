ucla,fpmrk8z,t3_gedbgj,1588739858.0,Having old tests isn't cheating. It's a common study method. UCLA literally has a test bank and professors usually offer old tests to study with. There was also a ring of students cheating a while back who got caught but cheating isn't very common at UCLA as most students understand that cheating will just hurt them in the long run.
ucla,fpiu8vu,t1_fpitg8p,1588648842.0,You took our conversation too literal. We weren't commenting on the voting system. We were mocking how political parties say things are rigged when something doesn't go their way. Please learn how to read social situations Orion.

ucla,fpi1fr3,t1_fpi08go,1588631784.0,This subreddit doesn't represent the entirety of the student population. I could go on FTPs Instagram and say its fixed if CUB doesn't pass based off of their comment section. Whichever way it goes let's be civil and not shout out that something's rigged.
ucla,fphvvtn,t1_fphqtel,1588628768.0,Just because something doesn't go your way doesn't mean its rigged.

ucla,fp50650,t1_fp4zvp6,1588312194.0,I don't support USAC all that much. I do support CUB because I recognize the fact that marginalized communities need to receive their own spaces. If there's an alternate solution that is more cost effective I'd gladly support that instead.
ucla,fp4zh2j,t3_gbbgnw,1588311616.0,"Orion was pretty bad imo. So was Aniq. Orion is essentially the same as Aniq just nicer about it. Josuel definitely has the heart but I could not see him as a strong candidate. Naomi and Joshua are the top two choices in my book however no one seems all too great. 

Side note: 
The best debate was between Carl and Aiden by far."
ucla,fp4z43n,t3_gbc5f2,1588311318.0,"No where close. Orion and Aniq are tied for the worst candidates. The top two are Joshua and Naomi. Then Josuel is just that awkward middle child, not good not bad just there."

ucla,fozjfj1,t1_foziypw,1588191673.0,"Look at my response below. I said if $45 is too much for you to pay, I understand it just leave it at that as your reason. No need to go out of your way (I know you're different from the person I originally responded to) to try and act like marginalized communities don't need their own spaces to be amongst each other. Just leave it at ""raising student fees by $45 is too much for me to afford."""
ucla,fozilp1,t1_foyywni,1588191274.0,"It doesn't have to, its still a democracy. But don't try to paint CUB as something that is wrong. If you just don't want to pay $45 to help out marginalized communities because you don't have that much money to spare leave it at that. No need for anyone to go on about their hatred towards Muslims (I'm aware you're not the same person I was responding to) there's no need for them to act as if everyone experiences life the same and that certain communities don't need extra assistance in order to combat a system that held them down for so long."
ucla,fozhvxh,t1_foyqxw6,1588190927.0,"Those in power should help those in need. Your reaction towards looking at something that will benefit a great amount of people and over time create a better world shouldn't always be ""but how will I benefit?"" Its selfish."
ucla,foxuz5u,t1_foxsxfw,1588157188.0,"Unity does not mean we all need to be integrated as one. We all have our different identities and therefore need our own spaces to be among our own. 

Your criticisms towards Islam and MSA are completely biased. You surely must understand that separation of gender is common practice in many cultures. 

Do you also believe we should end all greek life for fraternities being all male and sororities being all female? Of course not. 

Do you believe the Hermanos Unidos and Hermanas Unidas should be disbanded due to separation of gender? Of course not. 

Do you believe we should integrate locker rooms regardless of gender? Of course not. 

I myself am not in MSA nor do I practice a religion. But you must understand that the separation of genders makes others feel safe and leads to different social interaction. 

Would you argue that because California and Texas are different states that we are not united as the US?

Would you argue that we should disband the Veteran  center and cut its funding because most students have never served?

No you wouldn't, because you recognize that even though there may be divisions set up between smaller communities who need their own space to be around like minded people we can still be united. 

You must have also notices that many Muslim students around campus have had to pray outside behind buildings due to there being no mosques or designated areas of prayer near or at UCLA. 

Islam is a popular religion at UCLA, and this accommodation still has not been met.

The transfer community I am not completely aware of however I am aware that many transfers need additional resources in order to completely flourish like other students. They also need a space to be around those who went to community colleges and have experience in the real world.

I have never heard of an issue with ASU rejecting students for being ""indigenous black"" and I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that term. From what I've seen ASU has welcomed all black students and has provided a place for black students to be among each other and express themselves in ways that those of different identities could not relate to. 

Please also understand that black students are a very small minority at UCLA and have a lower retention rate than most at this campus. 

In order to combat this CUB would be perfect as it would establish an area on campus for black students to feel safe and receive guidance from those who have been in similarities situations and that share similar identities. 

Just because we are divided into smaller sub groups, does not mean we are truly divided. Unity does not mean we must all come together and identify as one. It means we must come together and stand as one. We must stand up for one another and see the struggles of those we are uniting with just as they would our own, and one of these struggles for these marginalized communities is needing a place to truly be free without judgment from those who do not identify as they do. 

CUB is unity."

ucla,fo8ysv0,t1_fo8rjk6,1587606725.0,There are classes for those who didn't quite reach those levels in HS. Chem 17 and Math 1 are both introductory highschool level courses for their respective fields.

ucla,fo5vhab,t3_g5vqwn,1587537022.0,Its because they know they'd be eaten up for loudly showing support for Trump at a prodominatly liberal campus. They're smart for choosing to avoid conflict. But you're stupid for thinking a great way to pick your politics is basing it off of who annoys you less.
ucla,fo542s4,t1_fnujhgj,1587517064.0,After talking to my roommates for about a week asked them about hook ups and how we'd go about clearing out of the room for it. Its awkward to bring up since they're most likely a stranger but it makes things easier.
ucla,fo53kpf,t3_g5rbao,1587516757.0,"It all depends on the kind of person you are and how you insert yourself tbh. Everyone has a different UCLA experience, if you feel like you'd be happy at UCI go to UCI but if you feel you'd be happier at UCLA and feel like you can get in and risk your UCI acceptance for fall 2020 go for it."

ucla,fnuhfix,t3_g3kuno,1587262167.0,"Hookup culture is very alive at UCLA, but your issue with it would just depend on the roommates you're assigned. When you're first put together ask about their sex life and come to an agreement on how to handle if someone wants to have the room to themselves for a bit. If you can't agree on the terms then participate in roommate swap."
