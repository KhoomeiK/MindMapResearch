UCSC,fp1d6b9,t3_gaq8lt,1588231600.0,"197 is writing based, 104 is stats/ math based. I only took 197 because Julie Gonzalez was teaching."
UCSC,fofempv,t3_g6s1mu,1587734162.0,"I got mine yesterday. I didn’t “submit” anything. But I did email them and ask, and my last name is toward the front of the alphabet."
UCSC,foa0t81,t3_g6iicx,1587636789.0,"You should get your refund soon unless the amount you are receiving anyway is greater than or equal to your rent for the quarter. The financial aid money conveniently goes to tuition and school fees before it goes to housing and dining.

But, you should check with your housing office and ensure that they have processed your leave."
UCSC,fo3pwze,t3_g5i80j,1587491013.0,Where on the portal are you seeing this? I didn’t receive an email but now I’m worried...
UCSC,fo0gk5r,t3_g4z5gu,1587412743.0,I moved out on the 4th and mine just came through today.
UCSC,fnnd1zu,t1_fnn6phs,1587089589.0,"Update: I received a negative charge on my account for the housing cost, but no refund and no direct deposit yet ??"
UCSC,fnn6phs,t3_g2qb60,1587085600.0,"Don't pay the negative charges, refunds are still being distributed. I haven't gotten mine either..."
UCSC,fkfic1f,t3_fi6bdl,1584135034.0,It’s open.
