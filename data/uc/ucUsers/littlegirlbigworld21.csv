PlasticSurgery,fpm3m39,t3_gdcux7,1588724873.0,"There are some surgeons who specialize in it, like Dr. Guichet (I think that's how you spell it). But, it is very uncommon because of the risks. That said, it may be worth it to you to be taller, but you must weigh the risks of nerve damage and leg pain. Personally, I wouldn't, even though I did consider it in the past. But maybe that's because I'm a petite woman so I can just wear heels."
tretinoin,fpcwedy,t3_gchb1g,1588514447.0,"I am having a 2nd purge now, but idk if it's because it's almost that time of the month. But it wasn't nearly as bad as the 1st. Just give it time I think your skin will settle! üòÅ"
tretinoin,fpcw7s0,t1_fpb5qj3,1588514321.0,VANICREAM. I haven't found anything better! My skin loves it and it actually helped with redness. It's basically liquid gold lol
tretinoin,fpazlhz,t1_fp86g3z,1588459012.0,"I checked and it's not capillaries, just redness. It looks like I've been out in the cold for a while, if that makes sense. I'll try putting tret on the nose to see if it helps. Thanks!"
tretinoin,fpaygrb,t3_gcakpa,1588458339.0,Honestly Differin SPF has helped. Also Vanicrea if you have super sensitive skin
tretinoin,fpay7h6,t3_gcex8t,1588458185.0,Following because I'm getting the same thing!
ifyoulikeblank,fp7mdf2,t3_gbga8s,1588373369.0,"Money and Cigarettes by Clapton... it's an album, and the lead song is I've Got a Rock'n'roll Heart. Clapton is usually consistent to the type of music he puts out, very blues, BB King inspired"
booksuggestions,fp7luwu,t1_fp6ax1d,1588373084.0,"Loved this book for that reason! All of Gladwell's books are fantastic and have changed how I observe myself. He uses great examples to tell us that we aren't as smart as we think we are, but in a nice and not condescending way."
BeautyGuruChatter,fp7c62a,t1_fp769lx,1588367868.0,"Ah, that makes sense. Thank you for educating me üòÅ"
BeautyGuruChatter,fp7669c,t3_gbfhv6,1588364772.0,Lisa Eldridge or Charlotte Tilbury because WOW... I guess they count as gurus

Mercari,fog35av,t1_fog2yuw,1587747230.0,"I have a tracking number that I sent, as well as the original USPS receipt with said number. This is so frustrating that he would do this, even with good reviews on his part."
Mercari,fog1lsk,t1_fog1heq,1587746548.0,I shipped on my own.
Mercari,fog1krr,t1_fog1bas,1587746534.0,"I have screenshots and everything, so I will send it to Mercari when they get back to me. This is so frustrating because the buyer has good ratings too."

ifyoulikeblank,fo8f58a,t1_fo8eqh4,1587595369.0,He captures nostalgia perfectly. When I listen to him I feel like I'm 5 again sitting with a bunch of old schoolers telling me stories about their lives
ifyoulikeblank,fo8etel,t1_fo7eejx,1587595192.0,Anything Clapton honestly. He has no bad songs

ucla,fn0qafi,t1_fn01tak,1586546705.0,Lmao the chicago Stan's taste nothing like the original. The Chicago ones are too heavy and thick
LosAngeles,fn0q01j,t1_fn0jrdu,1586546551.0,"I don't think it's the same owners though. I'm from Chicago and go to ucla, and I can say the Westwood location tastes SIGNIFICANTLY better than Chicago. The Stan's in Chicago has a completely different recipe, and they are mostly cake donuts versus Stan's light and airy donuts."
booksuggestions,fn0poiw,t3_fy43pk,1586546378.0,Indiana by George Sand!
ucla,fmzqi2f,t1_fmzq3no,1586527374.0,Same here! When I came to ucla from chicago I was surprised that the Chicago Stan's were a knockoff of the original one in westwood.

Coronavirus,fml5yqu,t1_fml52wb,1586179433.0,"I never said it was right. They just have nowhere else to go. It's not like some women can just get up and leave with absolutely no money or assets. Believe me, I have seen it firsthand."
