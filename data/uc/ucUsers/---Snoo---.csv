PublicFreakout,fnpd1sl,t1_fnp51r0,1587143368.0,"> You’re kidding yourself if you think selling loose cigarettes is a drug bust in any sense. 


Drug Bust

noun

a seizure of illegal drugs by the police or other law-enforcement agency.

If it’s an illegal drug that is confiscated, then it’s a drug bust. Notice how it doesn’t say in copious amounts.

> Also if you think people should get choked out for selling or using drugs, then we’re just very different people I guess. 

Never said this, but alright. You can assume whatever you want

> whether a person goes to jail or not depends on “respect” (which I owe the officer none)

Is it wrong to treat everyone with respect? If a person’s occupation makes you not respect them, then that’s your problem.


> The whole point is, the people who have a monopoly on violence shouldn’t arbitrarily enforce the law.

Would you rather them beat up on the guys and shoot them, or do something like this and strengthen their bond with the community? Pick a side. You can’t have them both. If officers do something bad, you rightly complain. If officers do something good, why do you still complain?

> Scroll through the thread, I’m far from the only person who had this takeaway.

I know, that’s how I found this comment. It’s obviously a largely controversial opinion, judging by all the downvotes, btw."
PublicFreakout,fnp3j64,t1_fnp18x4,1587138586.0,"?????????? I’m just answering your hypothetical with an example since you’re the one who brought it up. What am I supposed to do, ignore it??

Sure, it can definitely be lighthearted, and in many cases, officers let them off with a citation or a warning. The ones who don’t cooperate are usually the ones who go to jail. Watch some LivePD, and you’ll see what I’m saying.

Also, you’re kidding yourself if you think a noise complaint is on par with a drug bust."
PublicFreakout,fnp0h63,t1_fnoztp7,1587137047.0,"What’s the point of bringing up hypotheticals? Just because one call went bad doesn’t mean every call goes bad, especially when the situation is so lighthearted, like this one is. Also, it doesn’t look like anyone was going to say no. If they didn’t make the half court shot, they concede defeat and get off the court, at least that’s what my friends and I would have done. It’s such a trivial situation that there’s no point in arguing about it."
