It's a good way to do a bunch of things at once.  I use the custom groups, ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", etc.  Usually I number them in the sequence I use them on missions.  Like for a lander, 1 would prepare for landing, 2 would shut everything down, 3 would prepare for takeoff, etc."

OaklandAthletics,fnd6y7q,t3_g0z4it,1586861139.0,"1988 extra innings game against the Brewers.  We would sit in the center field bleachers every night and yell (positively) at Dave Henderson.  This was before the bad boy club.  We sat next to the gal with the K signs and her brother.  Anyways Hendu was our boy and I think he was at least amused by us.  He had the night off and I think Javier or Polonia was in CF.  

All night long the outfield plays the Brewers' big slugger Rob Deer to pull.  Huge shift.  Game goes to extra innings and Hendu pinch hits (walks I think) and comes to CF on a double switch.  Deer comes up and Hendu plays him straight up. 

 We really start yelling and motioning him to shift.  He keeps looking back at us like we are idiots then finally comes over between pitches and gets the idea.  He checks with the LF and he motions him to shift.  He moves over and looks back and gives us an OK sign and a big goofy grin.  

Anyways that was the time we positioned the defense.  Deer grounded out sadly, but Hendu drove in the winning run in the bottom of the 14th, and we gave ourselves full credit and vowed never to leave an extra inning game."
