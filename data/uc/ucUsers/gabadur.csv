imaginarymaps,fpcdges,t1_fpcdcyy,1588496387.0,"Well the reason mandarin stayed how it was is that china uses a script based on characters and not an alphabet, meaning that it doesn’t matter if you can speak the same language because a character would have the same meaning, if a character is a word, it doesn’t matter how it’s spelled. Besides that I see your point."
imaginarymaps,fpccrcj,t1_fpccln4,1588495663.0,"Yeah but if rome survived do you think they’d speak latin? The papcy still exists and they use ecclesiastical latin. I think as time went on rome would go on to have different languages. Like an italian emperor or a spanish one. Without modern communication and education, keeping the languages together and stopping them from becoming different languages would be impossible. Basically what I’m saying is that even if rome existed today there is no way that classical latin would survive as a spoken language."
