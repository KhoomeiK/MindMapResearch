But, when the professor pushed and told us to take a mindset as though the demon was telling us the truth, that changed the room a fair bit. Most people ended up taking one of the two positions Nietzsche prescribes, with a few exceptions.

Those who held onto indifference justified it under the idea that such a relevation wouldn't change their lives in any way. Now, I sympathize with this a little - their argument went something like, ""if we know this, it really only tells us we should be living the subjectively best life we can, because that's what we'd want for eternity. And, if that can be achieved, then we should already be doing it, regardless of the fact. If it can't, we should already be mourning over that fact.""

I think their argument had issues, but it facilitated good discussion about the question at hand: ""what does recurrence change compared to our normal situation?"""

But the biological and social concepts of race are at a mismatch in our current society.

DebateAnAtheist,fp48vmn,t1_fp48qag,1588294027.0,Sounds like you've got your answer then. The problem of evil does not apply to the higher power you concieve of
DebateAnAtheist,fp46onu,t3_gb45lw,1588292765.0,"The problem of evil is meant to point out issues in an omnipotent and omnibenevolent thing. As I've always heard it, if a God has the power to do anything, and wills the good, why isn't all of creation good? 

If we want god to be both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, it seems that there are two answers that most christian sects have to go with:
1. This is the most good version of things. (Or, all the bad is just us, and God lets us do that, because it'd be worse if god didn't) 
2. God gets to pick what's good and bad because he's omnipotent, therefore anything that god willed is actually good. I.e. you may not see it, but it's all part of God's plan.

These aren't the only ways, but imo, they are the two most coherent ones, and lots of other arguments boil down to those two. They have their flaws though (especially with regard to the idea of omnibenevolence)

I'm sure you can imagine a few issues with people blindly assuming that either we live in the best of all worlds or that all is within some greater plan. But that's neither here nor there. The point is, the problem of evil only applies if God is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent. 

Now, seeing as how you've left LDS, I think there's some more options for you if you'd like to consider some alternate higher powers. I'm much more experienced in ethics than metaphysics, so just know I'm not going to be your best guy here, but I've heard some options.

You could, for instance, go like how Unitarians go, and say that God isn't actually omnipotent. That toasts the problem of evil because a God that's not omnipotent couldn't fix everything. This has it's own issues down the line, but, it can work.

The other way is to reject the idea of an omnibenevolent god. An example would be a God that created everything, but has no stance on it. Just letting the universe tick away for however it goes.

Now, both have issues, but they are fix-alls to the problem of evil. 

If you want to stick to a God that's both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, you will have to make some weird assumptions about what's good - not that people haven't made them, they're just unusual."

And because of that, even if there were a god that could command what is right and wrong, our world does not show that to us. One can accept this and maintain their faith, but cannot know they are in line with that God's teachings. 

The hypothetical is meant to provide the most favorable conditions for the faithful to know, but even then, one can't know. And that's a way to do morality, it's a well-documented and studied one, actually. But it's not objective. And that's fine, there's nothing wrong with that. But if two people can read the bible and have radically different views on moral laws derived of it, it stands to reason that, if it really does contain moral truth, we are far from accessing it objectively.

We don't have the voice of God in our ears, we have translations of translations of an oral tradition that is thousands of years old. All through that, there is human error.

But, suppose God wills you to murder. And you know God has willed it. Is such a murder good? 

All this boils down to that point in the Euthyphro dillema. If God can will anything, then God can will what is and isn't good. What God chooses is irrelevant to this, the fact of this power makes goodness arbitrary automatically, because, were God bound by some set of rules, God would not be omnipotent.

If such a God were to alter the value of human life in general (making it more or less morally important) then it stands to reason that human life's value would change. It is not a contradiction to say something like, 'life has negative value,' so it's hypothetically possible for God to will human life such that it has negative value.

NoStupidQuestions,fp2rgv5,t3_gauk3v,1588266659.0,"I'm a little late to comment here, but something worth considering is what is meant by freedom. In my experience discussing with people, it can often be a meaningless political platitude that's akin to saying, ""I support the troops"" or ""hate has no home here."" In both cases, they have very little real semantic meaning; it'd be unusual for a politician to say, ""I hate our troops"" or ""I endorse hate"" or ""I hate freedom"" more often you see accusations about those phrases thrown about.

In that sense, freedom is a useful political tool for politicians to swing around to get people who don't think about things onto their side. But it isn't always like that.

Using the troops example, suppose someone said something substantative after it, like, ""I support the troops, I think we need to reform VA care to be more effective at..."" now it's not meaningless, it's a slogan for a platform. Freedom, though, is used a lot more often and is built into the national identity of this country. Put simply, freedom is a thing we care about because it has always been something we care about, even if many people do not know what they mean when they say ""freedom."" In this sense, it could be synonymous with ""american values"" or simply ""american""

That doesn't mean that ""freedom"" is meaningless. Most Americans, I'd wager, would agree that North Korea isn't a free country. But then again, if primed the right way, I'd also wager that a fair portion would say Germany isn't a free country.

I think that about answers the first question, but the second one is a lot more tricky, because we'd need a solid definition of freedom to work with. To some people, the draft is something that makes us less free. To others, it's an integral part of defending freedom. (I'll be upfront and say that I think defending the draft is stupid, but that's just me)

If we are talking about voter franchise, do we mean the right to vote or the access to the vote?

I think it's worth considering that there are multiple schools of ethical thought which make an appeal to an objective morality that do not require a God or ""mind outside of human minds""

But, before we do that, let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you needed a supermind or something like that. Full disclosure, I don't think you do, but that's besides the point.

So, assume we did, what would that being pick and choose as moral, and why? I know others here have probably mentioned the [Euthyphro Dilemma ](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/#AncGre) but let's just dig in to it for a moment, because it really does hard work to answer this question you've posed.

So, if we have a God that picks what's moral, and they tell humanity, and it's perfectly clear to all people at once, we would have a claim that we know that ""X"" is moral. 

What X is doesnt matter here, but if god said, ""X is moral,"" we seem to have reason to believe it's so. But, would it be the case that God relayed that knowledge to us from some higher moral code or would it be that decided unilaterally that it's moral and made it so.

If God relayed it to us, it begs the question, ""what is the cause for X being moral?"" Because if God relayed it, then there must be something they're getting it from. And if we could know what that is, it kinda makes the whole relay-via-God thing pointless - we'd just get it from the source, so to speak. If we couldn't know what that is, then we really wouldn't know that X is moral.

In the other case, God gets to decide what is and isnt moral. Therefore, it becomes a brute fact of the universe that X is moral. This yields a bigger problem, that is that it's also possible for God to make things that seem incredibly terrible into moral facts. Suppose a God that is omnipotent that deciedes that an element of benevolence is slaughtering as many children as possible. This seems ridiculous to us, but this case already assumess a God that is already making itself known to humanity in a direct, universal fashion.

We don't seem to live in a world like that, and with multiple theistic worldviews that claim omnibenevolence in their dieties, and changes to what qualifies as benevolence over time, it gets rougher. Suppose you heard the voice of God, and knew that it was God, and it told you to kill your son? Would you go like Abraham, or would you have reservations? This is hypothetical, [but there's a famous bit of philosophy on this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Trembling)

Now, there are alternative moral theories that defend pure objective morality as you've put it, and I'll set a couple forward that I've seen thrown around:

[Cornell Realism] (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/#CornReal) is the theory that Morality is a strange fact of the universe that is as real as something like health. We all can generally tell if something is healthy, but it's difficult to explain why someone is or isn't healthy without investigation. Similarly, we can generally see whether an act is moral, and our view (intuitions) is affected by cultural upringing among other things, just as with health.

[Kantian thought](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/#NET) suggests something different that works well enough here. All minds are governed by ""reason"" and as such can form goals which are instructed by hypothetical imperatives. These would be things like, ""If you want to get rich, invest in widgets"" or something like that - a means to an end. But, reason is an end in itself, ergo minds are ends in themselves, and we get the Categorical Imperative, which is more of a ""do this"" kind of thing. I'm not a Kant scholar, so you'd be much better served looking at his Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry about this.

But, these are just two of many theories! There's lots of scholarship on this just waiting for you to read it. Now, one last thing worth considering:

Suppose, if you will, a world where we actually can't demonstrate any purely objective moral theories. All of them either fall for one fallacy or another, and we are left to ourselves to decide what is and isn't moral. How would we be able to distinguish this hypothetical world from our own?

I'm gonna go on a limb and assume you believe in a higher being like you've described in your post. What drew you to that belief? Was it a mathematical proof that showed you beyond the shadow of a doubt that it must be true? The truth of the matter is, unless you can demonstrably show that such a being exists and dictates morality, it seems to me that you have chosen to believe in it, not that you know it exists.

Belief is choice, you could have chosen another version of things with another set of beliefs. If your demand for objective morality requires something that is as true as 2+2=4, then I'm afraid we may be out of luck forever, and doomed to subjective morality.

[Of course, that may not be as bad as I'm making it out to be...](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#FreVal)"

Before I say anything, I'm gonna make it clear that I'm an atheist, but I'm not neccessarily trying to get you to believe/disbelieve that a god, God, or gods exist.

Suppose I walked out into a field and saw, in the middle of nowhere, a rock with thousands of words written in plain english for me to see. Millions, maybe. Some connect to form sentences I deem reasonable, others not so much. Perhaps, if I loom at it long enough, I could try and interpret what it's saying, if it's saying anything at all.

Yet, no matter what I do, no matter the tools I use, it wont just tell me what to do, or what to think, or how to react to it. Perhaps it was created by accident, perhaps because of some purpose, I don't intuitively know. It's a puzzle box that has no apparent answers that aren't some creation of mine.

Hold onto the idea of that rock. If we believe that a higher power gives the world moral value (and we get over issues like the metaphysics of the divine, and other basic ethical issues such as the euthyphro dilemma are answered) we have an issue similar to the rock. We live in a world which is full of things which have no apparent interpretation in them, but instead invite interpretation. 

I want to answer your concerns in the post with this. If one takes the Christian God to be real, and interprets it to be a thing which created the problems of the world such that it could solve them, in a net negative sense, we have two issues at hand. Others here have already pointed out the metaphysical absurdity of such a thing, but I think there's a moral absurdity to it too.

If I may, I think you have seen the problem of evil, and concluded that the divine must be evil itself. The issue is, we have no reason to believe in the divine to begin with. This thought alone would leave one in a sort of nihilistic vacuum, where the world is full of evil things, and there is nothing to be done, no gods, no value, just badness. 

Yet, we return to the rock. We can interpret it to be something we find good. The world and our relationship to it is governed by our interaction and interpretation. In a sense, you can choose to create value for yourself. You can write what the rock says, you could always do that.

Basically, you don't need God to tell you what's good - you can create value. And, for people who interpret the world to be governed by a God which is good, one can ask the most powerful question, ""why"""
