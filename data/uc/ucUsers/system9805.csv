This shit isn't going to stay like this, you're gunna get that grade change. That lazy sack of shit professor is going to get off their fat ass and change that grade."
ucr,fpal40s,t1_fpakrf2,1588450401.0,"Then immediately send an email to your advisor, to the registar and to the dean of students. Or any higher up should do. This shouldn't stay like this. Unacceptable on your professors part.

Imagine putting in a lot of work for some class just so the professor can give you a grade you don't deserve based off a miscalculation. Email a higher up please."
ucr,fpa94ma,t3_gcapz9,1588443323.0,"If you have evidence that she miscalculated go ahead and email your advisors or dean of students or some higher up. They'll take care of you if there is a miscalculation.

If in the emails the professor says it's a miscalculation go ahead and foward that to some higher up explaining the situation 

Ans don't forget,, what Professor Vihad, be polite but be persistent."
ucr,fp344o8,t3_gb1lhl,1588272756.0,"I'm super sorry about your situation. You should absolutely talk to your professors and your advisors to talk about your grade situation. Your academic success should not have to be determined over things out of your control. If you need to talk PM please!

And UCR, why the fuck don't they just give an option to S/NC or pass/fail every class? Just make it optional as some people still need grades for graduate school. Did it ever cross their minds that people would be coming back to shitty households??????

Everyone should email Professor's Vihad's video ( https://youtu.be/DAqgSUaX8fA) to all their professors and Wilcox. They should also send them a link to this thread to show them the reality of things."
nba,fp2uhzs,t3_gb090n,1588268101.0,"Its been a a few weeks since the NBA season has returned after a grueling few months without NBA action. The NBA finally decided (after months of deciding) to continue the season at the Disney Land World Resort in Orlando.

LeBron James and the Lakers after beating the Oklahoma City Thunder on court number 4 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, in what was a game full of technicals, flagrant fouls, and players getting into a shoving fest, decided to go to Epcot in a suggestion by Coach Frank Vogel.

LeBron is having a deep conversation with AD about what it's going to take to win a championship. Danny Green overhears the conversation and buds in. Other Laker players are admiring Epcot while Jared Dudley and Dwight Howard are cracking jokes with the rest of the team. Javale McGee and Kyle Kuzma are somewhere trying to figure out where Walt Disney's frozen head is. Rondo on some random bench is talking to himself, isolated from everyone, the coaches, players, and medical staff. 

""That fucker. That mother of a fucker. Stupid bitch. I fucking had him!"" Rondo says to himself. During the game with OKC, Rondo had his ankles broken by Chris Paul, and the play is trending all over Twitter all while Chris Paul dropped 40 on Rondo's head.

The time is now approaching 9 p.m just enough time for the team to look around. Coach Vogel says, ""Alright everyone wrap it up, take your last pictures, we got a game tomorrow against the Warriors to clinch the first seed.""

The players start to walk out of the Epcot area, when they run into OKC who were coming from the Beach Club Villas from the Northside. The teams in an awkward run in don't say anything, but there is a lot of tension, but teams are holding themselves back. At this point Rondo is beyond mad, he's absolutely fuming, he sees Chris Paul. From 10 feet away, Rondo spits at Chris Paul's face. ""WHAT'S UP F*CK N***A"". Steven Adams in quick response, holds Chris Paul back, ""Mate it's not worth it."" All of a sudden, Dennis Schroder smacks the hell out of Quinn Cook

Absolute hell breaks loose! Teams start to beat the living shit out of each other. It's a rumble between players and coaches. Dwight in one corner is fighting Nerlens Noel, Chris Paul and Rondo are on the ground beating the living hell out of each other, Billy Donovan is smacking the fuck out of Frank Vogel, Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma are fighting off Danilo Gallinari and Terrance Ferguson. LeBron and Steven Adams are trying everything possible to stop the fights, when in comes Adam Silver in a golf cart accompanied by a few bodyguards.

""The fuck is going on here"" Adam Silver says. Everyone stops what they're doing. Adam is in a leopard dress with a diamond necklace and gold earrings on. ""What the fuck"" exclaims Chris Paul.

Adam Silver shouts, ""Everybody get the fuck back to your rooms! I was in the middle of my photoshoot and you guys ended it for me. I don't want to have to come back or you'll really be shocked. ""
Everybody in a state of shock, gathered each other up and walked off. 

Now that's that the story of how day 15 of the NBA at the Disneyland World Resort in Orlando, Florida went."

ucr,fo57ufj,t3_g5rm7e,1587519402.0,"I'm withdrawing for the first time as well. 12 to 8 units. I emailed the financial aid office and they said I would owe 3,000 since I'm going from full time to part time BUT I don't think they're telling the truth. I've researched all day from other UCs and other colleges and there is this thing called the 60% completion rule. Basically if you complete more than 60% of the quarter and then withdraw you don't owe anything back to financial aid. Its like you've fulfilled the entire reward for financial aid. The 60% completion is mentioned here for UCR https://registrar.ucr.edu/registering/cancellation-withdrawal-absence-readmission#withdraw

At first I thought this was for withdrawing from the entire university (withdrawing from all classes) but someone from another UC did exactly what we're thinking of doing (dropping one class and going to part time) and they didn't get charged based off of the 60% completion rule. I don't think financial aid is being honest with me. I mean it benefits them more if I pay 3,000 rather than withdraw after 60% completion and not pay anything.

Not to mention, this financial aid office has a history of incompetence


Just to add on, during the spring quarter 2017 I failed one class, thankfully I did not have to pay back financial aid, but here's what I'm trying to say. If whoever I talked to in the financial aid office is right (which I don't think they are) it would be better to fail a class and not owe anything, than to withdraw from a class you're going to fail and owe something. But this doesn't make logical sense if not nobody would withdraw or atleast most people would just take the F instead of the W for fear of paying back.

I'm going to withdraw from the class after I completed more than 60% of the quarter     (60 percent of the quarter is somewhere at the beginning of week 8) I'm still going to show up to class just so the professor doesn't drop me before the 60%. I'll still do assignments but not very well."

nba,fo40kxi,t3_g5lbuy,1587496134.0,"We all know what Kyrie Irving did against that Warriors defense. Now imagine Michael Jordan in that position. If Kyrie got his fair share against Klay, Draymond, and Andre, I'm quite positive that Michael Jordan would completely dominate these guys and one of those reasons would be MJ's post fadeaways. These guys aren't used to defending that and would get killed

I got the Bulls in 6. I wouldn't underestimate an ultra competitive psychopath that is MJ and I most certainly wouldn't underestimate the great coaching of Phil Jackson. Then you got Scottie Pippen giving Steph Curry work and then you have Rodman giving Draymond a taste of his own medicine. Not an easy win for the Bulls in anyway, but they would get it done."

Ben Wallace slowed Shaq down, he's going to slow the hell out of Dwight Howard.
