UCSantaBarbara,fp4dvss,t3_gad7tb,1588296956.0,havent been to the beach in over a year and i never get pressured to lol it's super common for people to not go to the beach or party and very few students actually join greek life
UCSantaBarbara,fnub1in,t1_fnu29cb,1587258245.0,"I asked because I was in a similar position to you and ended up sticking with chemistry. Though your career goals makes me feel as if you'd prefer the physics program. Here's something that may or may not make the decision easier but the chemistry program goes something like this.

1st quarter: Chem 1A (heavily centered around the things you seem to enjoy about chemistry) + Lab

2nd quarter: Chem 1B (extremely centered around the things you seem to enjoy about chemistry) + Lab

3rd quarter: Chem 1C (has a decent amount of topics you'd seem to enjoy but much less so, this is where the organic chemistry starts which I have a feeling you wouldn't like) + Lab

4th-6th quarter: Chem 109A-109B-109C + 2 labs (organic chemistry series: there's definitely a handful of topics I know you'll enjoy but there's also a huge number of topics people with your skillset and interests seem to consistently dislike)

After that the program seem to be a bit more scattered between organic, physical, and analytical chemistry topics (I'm not there yet so I'm not entirely sure what the program looks like)

If you majored in physics at UCSB you would be required to take chem 1a and chem 1b which would probably work out really well for you. I'd still choose UCSB because it seems like you're set on physics and if that doesn't work out we have a pretty good chemistry program. I am a little biased though lol. 

Don't think about this now but when you do arrive at whichever university you choose you want to think about just how much chemistry and physics you want in your education. Like would you prefer a program that goes further than chem 1b or stops there?"
UCSantaBarbara,fntqmtp,t3_g3jees,1587246887.0,"Extremely hard and you'll definitely struggle a lot. Other students in your lectures might be entering with significantly more preparation than you. I'm telling you this so that you know that if you do end up struggling and/or failing, it's most likely due to the rigor of the program and not your academic abilities so you shouldn't feel bad. I'm curious though, have you ever considered majoring in chemistry? Because based on my experience taking STEM classes and talking to students who excel and struggle in them it sounds like you'd excel as a chemistry major"
UCSantaBarbara,fnjmh67,t1_fnissii,1587002086.0,it's spring quarter even if youre a freshman how would you not know this by now???
UCSantaBarbara,flrk5fp,t3_fqleuk,1585421869.0,CLAS will be offered online!! Idk if they'll still have the same classes tho
