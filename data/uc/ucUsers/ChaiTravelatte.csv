https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J80PQoPsH-I

I have wrist issues so I switch out the ones that hurt my wrists. If you don't like these ones, you can search '5 minute XYZ' (where XYZ is whatever you want to work on, for me I searched 5 minute triceps to find the one above). So you can search 5 minute cardio, 5 minute abs, 5 minute glutes etc... If the workouts are too hard, don't get discouraged; I'm pretty fit and sometimes have to cheat during these videos. Also, if you really hate a certain exercise (I  HATE jumping jacks), switch it out for another one; try different videos with different instructors. You'll like some of them more than others, and you're way more likely to do the workout if you like it more.

I haven't done these, but theyre from the same person.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDFOS4n7hFo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efGY4txBxTU

Cardio one:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDD4GxHVess

10 min cardio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spc5yl47h1Y

Try to find videos with instructors you like, who match your vibe, and whose exercises match you. Like I mentioned above, certain moves/exercises aren't fun to me or they are a poor match for my flexibility/current strength, so some exercises/videos are really unenjoyable for me. If you're just starting and you really don't like a certain workout, definitely try others and try to find the kind you like!

If they're hard in the beginning or you feel like you're not doing them fully,  THAT'S OK! I have come back from injuries before and it's hard to start from scratch... It can feel a bit wobbly or like you're not doing 'enough' but be patient with yourself and give yourself a couple months of building muscles up etc. It will get easier the longer you do it, but it takes time and that's ok!!
Good luck!"

I personally don't regret working there, I have opportunities now that I never would have gotten if I hadn't taken the job and done as well as I did there in the 80-hour week role.

I know a lot of people who really liked working there, and a lot of people who were miserable. A lot of it depended on your individual project, and your manager. you should be able to go online to websites like Glassdoor etc and get a feel for your company.

I think this is true of a lot of jobs, not just consulting

Also, a lot of consulting firms are designed to have high burnout and turnover. They purposely want to keep the majority of their workforce as new hires two to three years out of college because they're cheaper on the contract.

Cara smirking and pretending to comfort hunter because she never thought she and Marie could win anyways. Marie and Cara just standing side by side silent for their team confessional... It's so perfect"
MtvChallenge,fo570jt,t3_g5mmo6,1587518886.0,"When Hunter and Ashley win, he looks so euphoric and makes a comment about how happy he is. Ashley gives him this look, like oh honey I am about to end you. Someone please grab it and post it. It is amazing. It's so quick but so intense.

(I felt bad for Hunter, but her expression is just... wow)

This also reminded me how much I loved Dirty Thirty. Semi related, Cara looked great that season.

And I want Marie to come back. That is all."

Like have only the bottom half of the wall painted a pastel, or paint the corner a deep jewel tone. I think painting the wall or using removable wallpaper would do a lot. You could also do a mixture of prints and photos like a gallery wall. I like your plants!"

I'm pretty well-rounded, so I think I could be competitive with anyone in a final, and bananas' strategy for years was to align with strong players and assume the game would take out a couple of them. I think this is a good strategy.

Bailey and Kaycee help with the big brother group, and Jenny Tori and Dee are all good competitors"

AskWomenOver30,fnv3akg,t1_fnqp4zp,1587278822.0,"in some things that I have read, the difference between intention and goals is that you put more detailed criteria when you're being intentional. Instead of saying I want to learn to play cello, you say that I am going to sign up for my first lesson by the end of the week, and take 1 lesson a week for the next 6 months. Having a 'plan' makes it much more likely that you'll follow through, because it breaks bigger goals into smaller pieces"
