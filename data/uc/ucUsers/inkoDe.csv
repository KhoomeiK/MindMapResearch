Basically what this means is a patient presented with symptoms that could be bipolar or something else, was treated as bipolar and they showed improvement and the label stuck. Further he said this is how a lot of psychiatry ends up working, not just for bipolar disorder and the issue is further complicated in that someone may present with multiple symptoms that are treated simultaneously (which was the real cause of the ""issues?"") and also people may have axis 2 psychiatric disorders that symptoms that superficially mimic axis 1 disorders, etc. and of course a lot of malingering goes on.

There seems to be a huge disconnect between what you think happens in the United States and what actually happens. You do seem to grasp the fact that the popular vote is completely meaningless, that is a good start. Lets tackle Americanism. It looks backwards, not forwards. It is a mix of mythology and history and it includes nationalism and a lot of other negative shit. Progressiveness in this country is a struggle against the vary nature of our national identity which if you are familiar with our history and our constitution is rife with really dark shit. Note, I am not even discussing parties at this point. Another huge element of Americanism is exceptionalism, that as Americans, our set of customs, culture, and belief (note I am purposefully using singulars here) we are a special people. This is why progressives are a threat, they want to ruin this. Yes I am oversimplifying by I am not going to take the 20 pages it would take to properly explain this. Now we will get to parties. THIS is what republicans have a monopoly on culturally, though at the top they have another agenda (spoiler, they work largely for the same people as democrats).




I am not going to get into Democrats too much because I know what the audience is here, but I will say a couple of things. It sends really mixed messages when Democrats and their sympathetic networks propagandize constantly against the popular progressive candidate, then yes, conspire with the dropping out of other candidates right before a crucial election day to bolster their chosen candidates numbers, and other nonsense. But they want us progressives on board, like we are family. [And why Joe?](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/02/joe-biden-history-republicans-tax-cuts-barack-obama-yesterdays-man) Yes, the election platforms have gotten more progressive, but shockingly the candidates themselves have gotten way more conservative. I honestly don't give a shit what Joe says. I have watched his senate career. He is neoliberal to the bone. He is not a friend to sexual minorities, or really minorities of any kind. Not a friend to the environment, not for justice system reform he fought to make it worse, etc. etc. He is lying to get elected. Image that. A corporate shill authoritarian lying to get elected."

I am overly reductionist because this is reddit not a job. I am not going to write a detailed essay on the topic.


As for the strawman no... Here is the deal. Republicans have a monopoly on Americanism whether you like it or not. Your party and agenda will always be seen as at best strange or at worst a threat to the American way of life to many if not most Americans. The exceptions are those times after periods of Republican rule where people wake up and see the destruction they are doing, then they panic vote Democrat. Yes, I know this is a sweeping generalization. Anyhow, what I want to see happen is that same pattern but for the system as a whole not either party. Not even a lot of progressives agree with me on this point, but they are voting third party and helping it happen anyhow, so they don't need a lot of convincing. Democrats are helping it along by basically ensuring people like Hillary Clinton and worse Joe Biden win Primaries. Honestly, at this point I don't have to convince a whole lot of people.

ChicoCA,fo9y2zl,t1_fo7jgq3,1587634641.0,It IS possible to want both lower taxes and a community that isn't socially backwards.
thedavidpakmanshow,fo9w7r9,t1_fo9v6k3,1587633127.0,"I agree Trump Virus is bad. Further, with the constant toothless bitching by Democrats even me, a vehement Trump hater, am getting sick of the Trump blame. I agree, Trump screwed up. But honestly what good does it do to have a strongly worded conversation over and over about what he did several months ago aside from make me mad at my governor for not enacting social distancing sooner? In California we used to have an AM radio host, and honestly he was perfect. Gay man, been through a lot of shit, he was charismatic funny, smart (but he didn't try to play the intellectual), etc. But most importantly HE HAD TEETH. He would not hold back. Democrat leadership needs a lot more of that kind of thing. People that at least SEEM relateable. You don't have to out Republican the Republicans, out people them."

I am not even going to try to touch the subject of speaking for black people. Just... not going there."
thedavidpakmanshow,fo9ulw0,t1_fo907op,1587631734.0,"No, this is the problem right here exemplified. The Democrats overthink think their marketing, when it is just that-- marketing. Just like in social interactions you have to know when to quit being clever and call someone an asshole, or I suppose in the case of Democrats cower away. In the spectacle of political theater you have to know when to do the equivalent. Republicans win elections because they grasp this simple fact. They understand marketing. Say what you want about them, but getting well meaning God fearing people to consistently vote for some of the most sadistic, evil, and corrupt people in the world is a pretty damn astonishing feat don't you think?"

It is what it is and our state governments need to find ways to work around it. So at this point I am started to get annoyed with my governor."
