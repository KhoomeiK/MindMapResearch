UCSD,fmtszvk,t1_fmthopt,1586378485.0,"Oh, I didn't move out until the 27th.  I'm worried it might be awhile.  When I try to go to Billing it gives me a 404 Not Found error, so hopefully they're working on it."
UCSD,fmsb220,t3_fx344x,1586351501.0,Mine still says on-campus.  When did you officially move out?  Have they refunded your housing yet?  I wrote on my housing cancellation that I was moving off-campus so I'm hoping it won't be an issue for me.

UCSD,fm3881i,t1_fm26nw3,1585715491.0,In the class I tutor for the professor made all of the attending tutors co-hosts and then we just had to switch the chat so that students could only chat will the hosts. It worked really well.
