ucr,fmo1ct7,t1_fmo11tu,1586241847.0,Thank you so much!
ucr,fmnw5iu,t1_fmnvsow,1586237047.0,Thanks! Sorry follow up question. How hard is it to get an on campus apartment if the school only offers 1 year guarantee?
ucr,fmnutue,t3_ffl8oj,1586235922.0,"Hey! So I was wondering how many years of housing guarantee does ucr offer? Is it possible to stay at the dorms or maybe an on campus apartment as a second or third year?

Also is it hard/competitive to get a triple dorm, meaning do they fill up quick?
Asking for my lil sis, thanks! :)"
