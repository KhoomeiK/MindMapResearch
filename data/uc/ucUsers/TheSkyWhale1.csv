Also fried stuff like chicken or pork would be great!"
Cooking,fmk6y78,t3_fvmyan,1586146129.0,"Kare Kare is a Filipino beef stew that uses peanut butter. It's pretty hearty and it uses beef oxtail, which sounds gross but is actually really nice and probably in stock. (Otherwise I'm sure other cuts will do fine) 

Goes well with a bit of cold shrimp paste or anything super ""sharp"" like that and some rice. Either way I think peanut butter is only used extensively in Asian dishes so that might be where you should look.

Good luck!"
