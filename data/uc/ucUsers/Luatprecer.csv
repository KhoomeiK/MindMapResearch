UCSantaBarbara,fopen38,t3_g8s0f8,1587959555.0,"If you are anxious about what you got in the class, I’m sure you can ask the TA to unofficially tell you the grade.
The point of the strike is to put pressure on the uc administration and gold, not on you. So that’s why they’re really willing to bend their strike “rules” if a student needs it for pre-req or other things. Other TA’s are submitting either because the grading is not in their direct control or they weren’t part of it to begin with or they’ve given up on that part individually.

So if what’s making you nervous is not knowing it, just ask for it unofficially. If what’s making you nervous is not having it in your gold transcript, I don’t know what to say."
UCSantaBarbara,foewtaz,t3_g742hg,1587717546.0,"how Israel is able to cope with their effects of the virus is not correlative to our capabilities... that’s why people are looking at other UC’s or even other state colleges with similar “curves” as California. Oh also primary schools will adapt much differently than colleges.

It’s not clear whether Israel is a good example applied to California, which it likely isn’t :(
Keep your hopes up, but this is a reach, I think."

korea,fn7o3d1,t3_g040om,1586724200.0,"Probably for the same reason that US people get salty when people overstay their visa then receive benefits in some way. As an antiquated feeling of self-survival, people are naturally selfish about the resources they have and get a bit upset when they are used on someone who doesn’t live in the country, *who isn’t paying taxes in to the system that benefits them.*

But also: who in the hell is traveling somewhere else to get treated for COVID19? that’s highly irresponsible and I’m not sure how that’s happening. I’m sure not many in korea are mad at people who’ve contracted the virus in Korea while living/visiting Korea."
UCSantaBarbara,fmyvy85,t3_fy8iwq,1586497435.0,"There’s a flat ~450$ charge for enrolling in a summer session among other “campus fees”, as well as cost per units taken. So it could be said you want to make that flat fee as worth as possible. But being enrolled also brings rec cen membership and bus access and maybe other things, which could be worth it for you.

I’d recommend two classes in the summer and you’ll still probably have an easygoing time, depending on classes."
