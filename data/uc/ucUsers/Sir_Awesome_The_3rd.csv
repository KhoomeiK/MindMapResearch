I couldn't find any Anki decks specifically for LS 7C, but there does seem to be quite a number of Quizlet decks for the class.

What you can do is just download the Anki/Quizlet Importer add-on to make/combine your own deck out of the multiple ones on the Quizlet. 

(Or just use quizlet but no spaced repitition, so what's the point haha)
