I ended up doing a few rounds of P90x just because i loved it so much. Just stick with it—some days you’ll feel off or weak and you might even skip some days, thats ok—but try to be consistent and your body will adapt pretty quickly."
carnivore,fmnzdhe,t1_fmmlo3b,1586239950.0,I went into carnivore right before this whole corona virus thing. And I’d do it again! It wasn’t that bad—it took me a couple weeks to adjust but definitely never felt like a full-on flu. Just tired and some headaches in the beginning. I didn’t even know about drinking salt water for the first week lol. That helps!

A few kids at the playground seems pretty insignificant."
