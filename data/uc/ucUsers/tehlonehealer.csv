Sleep in a little early or spend time doing something that makes you happy/distracted. Once you feel like you are ready, start going through the answers for the test whenever they are released or go through topics that you know tripped you up. If all of this doesn't sound good then attend the professor's zoom hours/request one. 

 The thing about failing the first test is the fact that you literally have nothing to lose for the rest of the quarter. You have to learn from your mistakes and go into the next test with a different strategy. Was time the issue? Pace yourself when practicing. Certain concepts tripped you up? Make sure you have a plan for every concept. Didn't do the easy problems first? Do those first on the next test. 

These are strange times so Aras's past doesn't really apply and this goes for practically anything academic nowadays so who knows really.

Don't burn yourself out. Take breaks. Walk around. Just realize you are doing your best in the middle of a pandemic."
