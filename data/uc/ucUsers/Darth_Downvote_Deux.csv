Then you haven't watched much good tv."
DanLeBatardShow,fphctfj,t1_fph8m9f,1588618990.0,The dude would be flipping burgers somewhere if he had a different last name.
UCSC,fp3k6os,t1_fp07h1c,1588280739.0,"What a load of bull. YOu have no idea how much work is being done right now to serve the students as we try to ride this storm out. Do you even understand how much staff work went into throwing everything online in two weeks? No, you don't. YOu don't know how overworked staff are while also contending with the fact that layoffs and furloughs are coming. 

You're mad about not getting your grades, but your conclusion is ""fuck admins""? It wasn't the admin withholding your grades. Perhaps place blame where it's due instead of taking the easy and most lazy stance. If you support COLA, you wouldn't be advocating for massive budget cuts to the school either."
UCSC,fp214r3,t1_fp0jhmv,1588252915.0,Profs have a specific course workload. You cant force them to just take on a summer quarter like that. They have research and service obligations too.
UCSC,foyiseo,t3_ga466a,1588173284.0,Can I just advocate for online teaching a bit? What is occurring this quarter is a hasty response to the pandemic that forced all teaching to go remote with incredible speed. I foresee that there will be more classes offered online in the future as we have some severe space constraints on campus. I hope people realize that the remote instruction this quarter is very different in quality and structure from an online course that is planned and developed in collaboration with the folks who are in charge of online education.
DanLeBatardShow,foy5kba,t1_fowbhor,1588165821.0,No way. Did you see Billy run?
UCSC,foui2zm,t1_fositte,1588084463.0,"Ah, thanks for the different perspective. It wasn't required in my program."
UCSC,fos3wjv,t1_fos01yb,1588023512.0,Sure. You dont have to TA if you dont want to. If you can afford to pay your own way youre golden. You could just do your research. It really depends on what your goal is. If you want to go into academia you're going to want to get some teaching experience.
UCSC,for71gn,t3_g94lc1,1588007263.0,Being fired as a TA doesn't have to end your time as a grad student. They'll just have to come up with funding another way. A lot of the striking grad students who were fired were already on the cusp of graduating so it doesn't really hit them as hard. Others may not come back if they can't get funding.
UCSC,foio5wn,t3_g7h2mr,1587791818.0,Why would you go to reddit with this question? Asking strangers for their opinions about something so important? It's your future. Do some real research and make a choice.
UCSC,foio1g9,t1_foidtnn,1587791718.0,They arent the ones losing their jobs asshole. It's going to be staggering making 50 and 60k a year. Others will be furloughed. You think everyone is making 400K? You're a clown.
UCSC,foinz16,t1_foiavfs,1587791665.0,Insane profits? You're talking out your ass.
UCSC,foinw6u,t3_g7hv5e,1587791601.0,If you're learning nothing then that's on you. Take some accountability and stop whining. Your generic the UC has a ton of money isnt worth bothering with either. You think it's that simple?
DanLeBatardShow,fnmew88,t3_g2j68j,1587070182.0,"In fairness to Stugotz, that product has a really stupid name."
UCSC,fn554s1,t3_fzkcrb,1586656156.0,"So much for going to university to encounter new ideas and people who may not see the world exactly as you do huh? Instead of avoiding people who may have different views, why not try engaging with them? Your post suggests you want anyone right leaning as far away from you as possible. They're not radioactive."
UCSC,fn41a3d,t3_fyu53b,1586632021.0,Is it time for that? You do realize there are massive budget cuts that are heading our way. People are going to be laid off.
UCSC,fmuyuod,t3_fxbdih,1586401988.0,The animals are all coming to take back their stuff.
UCSC,fmjn4jp,t3_fvko1e,1586133677.0,The answer is because faculty and staff are scrambling to address this curve ball we've all been thrown while working from home (which makes basic tasks take so much longer). You're not the only one sending that email to your professor. Their inboxes are ungodly full during normal periods so you'll have to just be patient while we all try to navigate this clusterf\*\*k.
