UCSD,fnbm5gd,t1_fnaow3f,1586817998.0,Side of the road. Street parking is for everyone. Just find the bus route you need to take. Park to the closest bus stop before the bus goes to school. Then youâ€™ll have an easy ride to campus
UCSD,fnamqbn,t1_fnam9et,1586800168.0,"I live 30 minutes up north of campus so on the days Iâ€™m in a hurry, I park my car somewhere close to the bus stop thatâ€™s direct to campus and get on the bus 5 minutes later. Itâ€™s always clear on the way to school and back to my car. Also, itâ€™s important to choose the right bus route to school where you only have to take 1 bus. Yes, itâ€™s all relative to where he lives and where his class is."
UCSD,fnacvse,t1_fn9p6mt,1586795275.0,"Iâ€™m a commuter myself. I also have a parking permit. However, I use the MTS buses more frequently. The MTS buses always took a total time of 10-15 min while the shuttles took 20-30 min. It also depends what time of the day you are trying to get on campus for both modes of transportation and where your class is. If youâ€™re trying to go to York Hall then the 202 gets you there in 10-15 min (waiting and riding), while the shuttle takes 20 (waiting and riding) and a 10-15 min walk to the other side of campus. Itâ€™s not cut and clear. You gotta see where your class is based on campus and decide whether a bus or shuttle is the move. In my experience, the MTS buses are the move because they are bigger which they carry more people (50+) rather than the regents shuttles that carry less people (20-25)."
UCSD,fn7uhqb,t3_g02a75,1586727891.0,Your best bet is to park somewhere close to campus and take the MTS buses. Students get free bus passes for the quarter (part of our tuition) and itâ€™s honestly faster than the shuttles or finding space.
xboxone,fn2ou36,t1_fmzufgr,1586597270.0,I hope itâ€™s me. I really wanna play this game
UCSD,fmri89x,t1_fmrght4,1586323991.0,"Lets say there's a possibility of everything going back to normal before the deadlines for housing for Fall 2020. I would recommend that you just make an executive decision and live off campus but close enough so that your commute isn't long and you can easily see your friends or have them come over. This will also be cheaper than the $1000+ rent you have to pay the school for a shared room when you can pay less and have your own room. On top of that, your RA is going to be different every year so they might not be chill like your last one. But if you live off campus then you don't have to worry about having a chill or uptight RA because you live off campus. Also, you get to choose who your housemates are unlike living on campus. You also get to do whatever your want and not have to worry about quiet hours as long as your roommates are chill."
UCSD,fmrdup9,t1_fmrdnha,1586320385.0,Do you mind sharing your website so I can take a look at it? Also who was your professor? I'm taking it with Bigham this quarter
UCSD,fmqp6xa,t1_fmqk93c,1586304112.0,"Not necessarily, if the government gives another order of lock down or quarantine then business (including pro sport teams) are required by law to follow. They also wonâ€™t open back up if the public (their major source of revenue) doesnâ€™t show up to their games"
UCSD,fmqfbq5,t3_fwtowd,1586298529.0,"if the rate of quarantine continues then probably yes, but if it lowers by mid June and locations open up again, then we're back in business :)"
UCSD,fmqf2cj,t3_fwtmd1,1586298389.0,body weight workouts have proven to improve muscle growth and stamina as well. And there is no requirement to spending money
UCSD,fmqete5,t3_fwopo4,1586298256.0,"you just gotta make a decision on your own. I prefer off campus housing because its cheaper, more freedom, and no RA"
UCSD,fmqeekc,t3_fwrh5c,1586298039.0,"Unfortunately not, you just have to turn down your volume until they're done talking"
UCSD,fmq8snp,t3_fw7kav,1586295020.0,I feel as if classes are requiring more and more work. I would like to think its because of the competitiveness of each new graduating class but sometimes professors are tough too.
UCSD,fmq3mj3,t3_fwquw3,1586292262.0,You should contact the financial aid office and see what the hold up is. It should have been deposited for most by now
UCSD,fmq0ew3,t3_fwbgqv,1586290612.0,Give them likes on the chat
