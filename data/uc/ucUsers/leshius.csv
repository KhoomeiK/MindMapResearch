Edit: https://twitter.com/vsarveshwar/status/1257843503368769538 So if you don't see it and you are an undergrad, you did not qualify for the CARES act funding. So you're telling me people who need the money get jack shit whereas people from better off families get a slice of the cake?"
berkeley,fpmzxid,t1_fpmuvvs,1588746172.0,Did the reward actually show up and says $0 or did it not show up at all. I have an efc a bit lower than yours and its not showing up in my Cal Central.

berkeley,fpmhd0t,t1_fpm1i9t,1588733102.0,"Confirmed that there will be one wave only for undergrad. So if you don’t have it, you won’t get it."
berkeley,fpmabgw,t1_fpma89j,1588728797.0,Let me know what they say. Maybe the ASUC External Affairs VP is wrong about there being one wave for undergrad and one for grad.
berkeley,fpma58z,t1_fpma0d2,1588728693.0,"No problem. I'm confused too since I'm EOP and low income, so I thought I would be able to get the money. But I got nothing. And then there's people with efc of $24k getting $500, which just makes no sense to me. Unless the school went ""Fuck poor people"" mode, I just do not see how? They even said it has no impact on financial aid, so it can't be because they gave us more financial aid so they won't give us the money."
berkeley,fpm9yph,t3_geannd,1588728587.0,"According to this, https://twitter.com/vsarveshwar/status/1257833856989720577, there's one wave for undergrad and one wave for grad students. So if you didn't get anything, you're out of luck. That at least counts out the waves theory."
berkeley,fpm6o3k,t1_fpm6f9w,1588726655.0," Well, according to this comment thread, https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ge8fx1/cares_awards/fplw3je/, people with efc of $24k got $500. How can this be a needs based award if people who's family are better off get the money and people who are worse off don't?

Also, people with efc of $0 didn't get the award. https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ge8fx1/cares_awards/fpm19sj/

And this twitter post, https://twitter.com/vsarveshwar/status/1257833856989720577, seems to imply there's only going to be 2 waves. One for undergrad and one for grad students."
berkeley,fpm64ke,t1_fpm5k98,1588726342.0,My efc is $1434.
berkeley,fpm61r5,t3_ge851m,1588726296.0,Nothing although I'm EOP and low income...
berkeley,fpm5881,t1_fpm0ms0,1588725818.0,"EOP low income. Nothing shows up for me.

Edit: According to this, https://twitter.com/vsarveshwar/status/1257833856989720577, it sounds like there's only going to be 2 waves. One for undergrad and another for grad. Hope I'm wrong though."
berkeley,fplsh7e,t1_fpls9w3,1588718609.0,I am looking in 2019-2020 and it's not there. I really hope I get the money because it will be of great help right now.
berkeley,fplrvyh,t1_fpl1x36,1588718287.0,Weird. I qualified for financial aid since I’m considered low income and it does not show up on mine.
berkeley,foyv6om,t3_ga7oqc,1588179769.0,"Just curious, would you still be coming to Berkeley even with the optional online and highly likely online only semester?"
berkeley,fovld08,t1_fovl8oq,1588103273.0,Way bullshittier than MT1 and MT2. We only got 80 minutes and 20/25 isn't a hundred percent.
berkeley,fovjqi2,t3_g9tt35,1588102486.0,F
berkeley,fody1bt,t3_g6rwvu,1587692288.0,"RIP to the people living off campus. So essentially, would labs for all classes be cancelled then, since if students are given the option to go remote, I doubt classes like Chemistry, Bio, and Physics can hold their in person labs."
berkeley,fngmsrn,t3_g1mze2,1586937416.0,"The good old if you think it might be a scam, might as well treat it as a scam."
PS4Deals,fnamnpf,t1_fna3rdb,1586800133.0,Me too. Just waiting for the price to go down for summer where I will finally be free from college and can enjoy myself.
PS4Deals,fn79hhx,t1_fn6b6wq,1586715911.0,"This is what I’m talking about. I preordered FFXV, and then like a month or two later it went on sale for about $30 dollars. Then they came out and announced the Royal Edition and I just felt burned."
PS4Deals,fn5sz6v,t1_fn5r7ix,1586674824.0,"I didn’t mean that. What I’m saying is that in the past, I purchased Lightning Returns and FFXV at full price near release date, and a week later their price dropped significantly."
PS4Deals,fn5i7zr,t3_fyoach,1586665557.0,Out of stock... But I'm probably gonna wait a bit and see if it drops any lower. I've been burned twice by Square Enix where Lightning Returns and XV both get like massive price drops like a week after I purchase for full price.
berkeley,fn4c0d3,t1_fn4bojx,1586638264.0,"Well, they first started off by saying “Mr. Paul is cute.” There was only one guy who was shouting slurs. Others were praying Hilfinger for his “cuteness” and begging for acceptance into our university."
berkeley,fn49tw3,t3_fzda70,1586636990.0,He used cute so much in that lecture. He was probably inspired by the zoom bombers who called him cute.
PS4Deals,fn1f376,t1_fn1bnia,1586560688.0,"Also, the design choice that they made so that to fill up the bar, you actually have to be aggressive and attack is huge. Especially when it is a boss fight, unlike in FFXV where I feel like no way in hell I'm going to die, in FFVII remake there is actually risks and you have to be smart about when to attack and dodge and stuff. Combat is even more strategic in VII although it is way more action game esque than XV cause you actually have to command your party members to do stuff."
PS4Deals,fn181u3,t1_fn0osif,1586556639.0,"I really like how to use items, you have to fill up the bar first. Really gives the game an actual difficulty."
PS4Deals,fn17zpk,t1_fn0ysgy,1586556606.0,"I beat the optional end game dungeons and adamantoise by holding attack and popping my x99 potions and elixir when I’m low on health. Besides, the end game dungeons were just copy and pasted cave rooms, so don’t see much of an appeal in that."
PS4Deals,fn0arpp,t1_fn0agxr,1586538522.0,"I’m guessing you liked FFX because of the story? Well, if so, steer clear of this one cause not only do you have to watch a movie and an anime series to understand the story (which is still absolutely riddled with plot holes and hard to understand), they cut out portions of the character stories and sell it as DLC. Many of the characters aren’t memorable at all, and they try to tell a love story but absolutely fails at it."
PS4Deals,fn09tvx,t1_fn09a6r,1586538035.0,"If you enjoy a game where you hold attack and the game plays itself, then you would. There’s no strategy to this game. Just hold attack when attacking, hold dodge to dodge 100% of attacks, and if you’re gonna die, just keep popping your healing items that you have no cool down on whatever. Story is absolutely a mess as well."
berkeley,fmu9kmq,t3_fxgwps,1586387101.0,They must love Mr. Paul... Dumbass had their face cams on...
berkeley,fmu2aly,t1_fmtwqtm,1586383242.0,"I’m on Cal Central and it does not seem to be letting me change housing options. Are you talking about changing it for the 2020-2021 school year? If so, financial aid haven’t been applied yet."
mildlyinteresting,fmn1w2o,t1_fmmucjb,1586216474.0,Right...
CitiesSkylines,fmilz1l,t3_fvheeg,1586112236.0,I’m disappointed that the roundabouts didn’t combine to form an even larger roundabout.
