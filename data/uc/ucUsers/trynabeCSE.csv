UCI,fp4v1c9,t1_fp15ryy,1588308120.0,"Oh I think you‚Äôre already off to a great start! Since you‚Äôre just starting I would suggest you follow the given course plan for now. Not to deter you or anything, but many CSEs drop before they even get to their 2nd or 3rd year so, as a precaution, just take the recommend courses just in case you want to switch majors later and you‚Äôre not too far into CSE path."
UCI,fp15k0i,t3_gakpzz,1588225012.0,"CSE about to graduate soon! What year are you? What have you taken? If you really don‚Äôt have a clue, really try to stick to the plan they already made."
UCI,foliszb,t1_fokr4sx,1587863140.0,"If that‚Äôs the case, you should try switching to CpE (computer engineering) instead as they take more EECS and physics courses than we do. Hmm social life is really what you make of it. It‚Äôs a little hard if you don‚Äôt have a car since we‚Äôre CLOSE to cool things but Irvine itself is not particularly fun nor is there anything super fun within walking distance. The people are nice and there are parties if you look for it. So, as cheesy as it is, it really is what you make of it. Feel free to message me for more questions, I‚Äôm totally down to help in anyway! :)"
UCI,fokqxkm,t1_fokmb06,1587847243.0,Good luck! 112 was a fun concept but teachers were awful. 112L was also a joke.
UCI,fokqkwy,t3_g800a4,1587847057.0,"I‚Äôll say this, I‚Äôm about to graduate with a CSE degree and it‚Äôs truly whatever. It‚Äôs self taught here and there is more of a focus on the CS part of it all. We are also split between school of engineering and school of ics for counseling and it can be a hassle at times for admin issues which can be very annoying."
UCI,foeqk7n,t1_foe6r1w,1587711407.0,He‚Äôs actually turning 9 in a couple of months so he‚Äôs not quite a pup anymore!
UCI,fnx40sd,t3_g4ce52,1587331049.0,"Is this for Douglas? Have you ever had him before? If no, he is usually not a ‚Äútechy‚Äù Professor. He rarely ever does anything online. His tests are usually like this. Albeit, this one is a little tougher but it doesn‚Äôt stray too far to how he usually teaches."
UCI,fnexioz,t3_g12a3r,1586897682.0,"Sorry, not much help here but for ugrad, Prof. Healey was the only saving grace for EE tbh...what a sweetheart and incredibly smart"
UCI,fhgad42,t1_fhga99v,1581562240.0,"Oh no I completely agree with you but yes, for the sake of seasonal items and supporting children I‚Äôm looking for that Girl Scout brand üòÇ"
