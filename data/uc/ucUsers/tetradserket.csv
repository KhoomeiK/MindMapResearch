Minerva can’t help you for some reason at the beginning, and Lorenz (an honorable enemy) straight up kills himself in fromt of you, all four members of the Wolfguard fight you, Gotoh locks Tiki in the Ice Palace to suffer recurring nightmares for eternity, Katarina tried to kill Marth. At some point, Maria, Lena, Elise, and Nyna get kidnapped, and though it isn’t mentioned, Marth would know that Minerva, Michalis, Julian, Merric, or Sirius could have their alliances swayed by using the healers as leverage.

Robin and Chrom are different sides of a coin. They’re like reflections, and they’re supposed to be opposites who are on the same level. Chrom is the heart and Robin is the mind of the Ylissean Army. Therefore, their appearances are opposites as well.

Kris is, on the other hand, Marth’s shadow. He’s meant to be a loyal soldier to Marth, sort of following in his footsteps (Marth is much more experienced than Kris, having gone through an entire war already before the events of FE12).

shitpostemblem,fn67sm6,t1_fn5spt2,1586690778.0,"I enjoy fixing plotholes in stories, so let me take a crack at this one:

Maybe the way Divine Pulse works is that you have to manually set a “return point” to the current moment before being able to rewind time. Just before each battle, Byleth marks that instant as her return point, so she can return to then as long as Sothis hasn’t run out of Divine Pulse energy. 

With Monica, Byleth only realized something was up a few seconds before the stabbing. She quickly set a return point to that specific instant. Thus she was only able to rewind time by a few seconds, and was only able to return to the moment she realized Monica’s plan. I’d like to imagine she tried rewinding to save her father more than twice, up to her current Divine Pulse limit, and failed every time— to the point where Sothis ran out of Divine energy and told her to stop.

In the scene with with Rodrigue and all the others, Byleth didn’t know that something bad was going to happen, so she couldn’t set a return point, and therefore couldn’t rewind. The difference is that those events were a complete surprise to her as well."

As any good poet knows, the meaning, syllabic content, and syllabic emphasis of each word is vital to the overall construction of a work of literature. Yet the word sprog only has one syllable, no differences in emphasis. This, of course, is because the simplicity is in itself a clue. 

The word must actually mean something greater: an acronym, if you will; a poem of its own, contained in a single word. The first word of the acronym is clear: it refers to the Society itself with that initial letter ‘s.’ The other four letters, then, cannot be a description, for why would they hide a description within the name of the organization? This is too mundane, we must look deeper. The only conclusion is that these remaining four letters refer to the names of the organization’s members. Thus there are four members. I rest my case.
