According to game mechanics, it's treated like a position change, which is why you can't flip it face up after setting it in the same turn. This is also why you can flip summon the same turn you normal/tribute summon another monster."

Yugioh101,fnm44x5,t1_fnm2xc4,1587064768.0,"Of course, my guy. It's very unique considering it's one of the few trap-heavy (heavy being like >15 main deck cards) decks out there. Keep in mind, it's really only good for messing with at the kitchen table or with some friends for a small game night. I really wouldn't recommend taking this to a locals or anything, but don't let that stop you from having fun. The casual vs competitive worlds or yugioh are separate for a reason, and it's fun to always retreat to something dumb or fun in the casual world. 

If you can, I'd also advise picking up a copy or two of the old Sanctuary of Light structure deck (the one that had Hyperion as the flagship monster) since it has cards that also work in the deck. Have fun with it, and feel free to talk to me or ask more about it!"
Yugioh101,fnm3jpf,t1_fnm2rvn,1587064473.0,"I think the point of playing true casual is to dismiss the idea of tiers altogether. I agree that according to conventional standards, the deck essentially sucks, but he's asking for something cheap to play with. 

And I would venture to guess that from his previous posts, he's likely playing with friends he already has. Not exactly aiming to win over some friends by flexing a deck. It's just a fun deck to mess around with. It's a fun crapshoot, something to crack out when even rouge decks get boring. When I started this deck, it was hours of fun with a couple friends who all had their own casual decks: Timelords, cyberse, blue-eyes, etc."

Yugioh101,fnm1jn2,t3_g2j842,1587063470.0,"Hey dude! This was one of the first decks I picked up coming back into the game a couple years ago. It's a fun deck to play around with some friends. When I played against my friends' decks, it worked like a glass cannon. It all really depends on the opening hand you get. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a good deck, but it definitely needs to go first, considering (if you go the 3x structure deck route) half the deck's gonna be traps. 

When I first built it, it was modeled very much after Cimoooooooo's build on his [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p69mLNi0dvw) on the deck. Keep in mind the banlist has changed significantly since then when you put stuff like the solemn brigade into it. 

Some additions that could be good to make would be stuff like {{Broken Line}}, {{Grand Horn of Heaven}}, generic Rank 4 XYZ monsters for the extra deck (like {{Tornado Dragon}} ), and other solemn cards not included in the deck. If you have any questions at all, I'd be more than happy to try and answer! Just dm me or reply to this comment!"
Yugioh101,fnm0mpa,t1_fnlsdja,1587063012.0,"my guy, at least read the post. He's asking about casual play, where there's hardly a meta. You're right that it's not good but he's not even asking about locals or anything."
AmItheAsshole,fnlp038,t1_fnlihr3,1587057257.0,Or just create that subreddit
AmItheAsshole,fnlo6lj,t1_fnlihr3,1587056862.0,"Well, then you are more than welcome to petition a rule change (see rule 14), or create a META-tagged post, rather than complaining about rules you've neglected to read. 

Not saying it would be bad to have some rule changes, but to complain about and actively approve of rule-breaking like this in the comments is a bit wasteful."

AmItheAsshole,fnl7en6,t1_fnl48zc,1587048428.0,"It honestly should. Like the ""verdict"" is the same here, but according to the rules' meaning, it's ""Not the asshole"" which by itself can imply no one's an asshole (yes, the rules clear it up, but not everyone reads the rules and just sees NTA). NAH is a judgment I don't see used often enough when it's clear that there's no wrongdoing or ill intent, and people still put NTA instead anyway. It bugs me, and there should honestly be a sister subreddit poking fun at people clearly using the wrong verdict and getting roasted for it."
AmItheAsshole,fnl2s4e,t1_fnl23st,1587045812.0,Thank you. Too many people here put NTA when their explanation better fits NAH or something.

But seriously, I've seen way too many praise team vocalists pretend like they're on the Voice or something. It's one thing to be a talented singer, and let your voice to the work, but another to force it. It makes it sound way too cringey and forced, and in all honesty, undermines the whole reason of being a praise team for God."
