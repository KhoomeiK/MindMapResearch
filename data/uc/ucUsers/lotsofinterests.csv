Try going to r/duolingo and they might be more enthusiastic, or find a Basque sub and post there

En caso de que OP hable el español mejor que el inglés, no soy hablante nativo de español pero intentaré a traducir. Yo haría un curso de vasco si era ofrecido por Duolingo, pero, como lo he visto, a la comunidad aquí no le gusta Duolingo mucho. O, a lo menos, las personas de este sub no creen que Duolingo debe ser el único recurso (y sí, tienen razón, debe ser un punto de empezar, pero nada mas)
