berkeley,foma7fk,t3_g85fi5,1587883003.0,"In my opinion, cherry picking can come of as taking advantage of a bad situation. If you pass a class that’s not known to be difficult and leave your other more difficult classes, as graded, - that’s more understandable imo than pass/not passing classes like, Math 104, and having classes like Data 8 be graded."

berkeley,fognqqc,t3_g7c1so,1587754885.0,"Took Gu for 54, alongside the adjunct and got an A. But that’s mainly because of the adjunct. I wouldn’t take Gu again for any class to be honest."

berkeley,fnwkt1q,t3_g4cazt,1587320289.0,I always found on campus to be too expensive. You can pretty easily find a single room if you’re diligent enough to start early. But any housing in Berkeley is not cheap. I payed about 1300 a month for a single two semesters back. And that’s usually the going price for a single 10-15 minutes away from campus.
berkeley,fnwk7dm,t3_g4bw6h,1587319955.0,"Although many people in the major don’t take 53, or 54, I highly recommend new Econ majors to take those classes regardless. By the time econometrics comes around, or some interesting class that has a 53 or 54 prerequisite, it’s always been helpful (especially if you wanna do stats too)"
berkeley,fmduqo5,t3_fumww9,1585978586.0,There’s this guy that keeps showing up in my Facebook feed that paid to advertise his campaign for the ASUC senate. Is this normal? I’ve never seen anything like this before.
