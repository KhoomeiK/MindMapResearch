It has since completely obliterated the pot it used to be in, devoured all of the soil that it shared with the other plants, and continues to grow parallel to the ground because it is too heavy to support itself vertically. The thing is fucking huge compared to the tiny pot it used to be in. Today I finally chopped off some of it to take with me to my apartment, was a spiritual moment"

UCDavis,fozihsb,t1_fozhmbf,1588191221.0,"Ok, then take a quarter off. They have explicitly said multiple times that if online learning isn't for you, then don't. You are under no obligation to pay them that amount if you don't think it's worth the money you are paying."
UCDavis,fovvfxu,t1_fovva63,1588108211.0,"Good point, edited my original comment. Still believe the rest stands though."
UCDavis,fovudu3,t1_fovru3n,1588107683.0,"I understand these are hard times, but I would encourage you to sympathize with the university's dilemma and look further into the complexity of the issue.

1. They are offering webcams for students in need. [Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd2Xsj3raCYF3gpDcTXwveTppaa1CIJ81tUGANsuGxJYIsqg/viewform) is a link for people in the engineering department, and I assume you could email counselors in your respective department if you are not in engineering.
2. They have sent several emails on students with financial issues being able to request laptops from the university. The Chancellor's email from March 27th is one of them.
3. If they lower tuition, you are 100% talking about laying off hundreds of university employees. That includes your ~~professors,~~ counselors, janitors, and fellow students. From the Chancellor's last email, we lost $80 million in the last month alone. The government gave the school $34 million and half of the is going to students. So you have $63 million that is not there. Let me emphasize that, **$63 million dollars that the university usually has, was lost in 1 month due to the coronavirus.** 
4. The Chancellor makes ~~$325k~~~$800k/year. Let's assume he lowered his salary to $0, should we distribute $20 to each of the 40,000 students? 

I get the frustration, but I think it's important to understand that **everyone** is frustrated, the faculty at our university included."

thinkpad,fmf5t4o,t1_fmep48t,1586020518.0,I second this question. All the info on battery I find has to do with 4K versions
