berkeley,fpfxfyr,t3_gcy5hm,1588587175.0,Try just emailing the housing office. Also I think you can add roommates on the housing portal if you’ve already submitted without having to resubmit.
berkeley,fpfwr3l,t1_fpdv2z5,1588586428.0,Most people I know took it spring of sophomore year (and a bunch got in haas). Some took it fall of sophomore year.
berkeley,fpfwnrd,t1_fpeq59d,1588586329.0,Have heard it’s pretty easy and there are plenty of easy haas classes you could take to pad GPA. I think the ugba equivalents to econ 100ab are also less mathy.
berkeley,fp9amoi,t1_fp99vpj,1588420502.0,"1.	 I did that too. worked out well
2.	U1 and 2 are identical. They both have study/academic centers in the central basement as well. I recommend them. U3 has only one central laundry amongst the buildings I think (vs U1/2 have them every other floor in each building. U3 has bear market in the middle where u can buy snacks w flex dollars and cafe 3 is right there. U3 also has older facilities from what I hear."
berkeley,fp99mss,t1_fp99hac,1588419523.0,"Just split it equally. There are three desks and three beds and just divide the number of clothing drawers/closet space by 3. It’s a little more hassle to split but it was never really an issue for me or other ppl in triples. Each persons desk is kind of their personal area. 

If you have considerate roommates (most people are considerate) I think it’s really great."
berkeley,fp996da,t1_fp58ezw,1588419055.0,No
berkeley,fp995ws,t1_fp73s1v,1588419042.0,"It’s all luck tbh. I requested only doubles but got put in a triple. 


As for mini suites, it doesn’t work like that. They assign you the room within your minisuite. Tbh triples aren’t that bad and have their upsides as well. I enjoyed it a lot."
berkeley,fp991y9,t1_fp78let,1588418928.0,"No idea I’d guess they’ll probably just take one of the two people and put you with them. 

Why not just get a triple and room with both of them?"
berkeley,fp9903n,t1_fp88z4w,1588418873.0,No that’s only if you sign the housing contract they give you.
berkeley,fp98ysk,t1_fp8vp2z,1588418835.0,Calcentral is slow to update. Give it a few days or email them if you’re worried about it. The email confirmation should be enough though
berkeley,fp98xt3,t1_fp96ca5,1588418806.0,It can be. Depends on how much you personally value your living space. For your last question: no idea but I don’t expect it to make a difference
berkeley,fp19d53,t3_gapxkm,1588228211.0,"1 and 2 I don’t know 
3.	Only bear pact is mandatory, everything else you don’t need to go. Most people I know went to just the events that sounded fun/or if they had nothing else to do. Some go to all events, some go to none
4.	It was pretty fun for me. I met a lot of friends through GBO and we just hung out together doing our own thing. I know people who stuck with their group the whole time and had a bunch of fun too and became good friends with the other people who went. GBO might have some shitty or boring activities but it does it’s job pretty well imo."
berkeley,fp177c5,t1_fp14fbo,1588226358.0,E(X) is expectation or expected value
berkeley,fotz35v,t3_g9kdix,1588071216.0,"Like 61b. There’s no hardware in the class, the closest you get to hardware is using some Java app where to draw circuits."
berkeley,fotxi5x,t1_fotx99a,1588069642.0,"Yes. Dropping before deadline will be in the first three weeks in fall/spring. 61A specifically usually tries to schedule midterm 1 early so you get ur grade before this deadline. And dropping after this deadline is once in 4 yr

Yes you can only take them once unless you fail (NP or below a C-). I think this goes for all classes at Berkeley. But with CS only the grades from the first time you take them count toward declaration. 

Yes seems right unless you fail and retake but I don’t recommend that bc it will be impossible to declare then."
berkeley,fotx8mx,t1_fopuiqt,1588069380.0,"To add on, it’s not that rare but you don’t always get your preferences. I was put in a triple but I only requested doubles too. I think around 30-40% of the rooms on my floor was doubles if that helps (I was in the units). I think blackwell is all doubles too."
berkeley,fotx3fx,t1_fosx5z4,1588069236.0,I know someone who’s doing that. Def possible. Haas is a really light major once you get in anyways so a lot of people try to double or minor in something else.
berkeley,fotwzip,t1_fotwm23,1588069126.0,"In general, you can drop as many classes as many times as you want until the add/drop deadline (like 3 weeks into the semester/some classes have earlier drop deadlines so watch for those) and you pay like 5 or 10$ per class drop. After that you can’t drop any classes unless you use a **one time in your four years** late drop pass, which lets you change grading options/late drop I think up to two classes. This late drop form can be submitted up until like end of dead week. 

Not sure about the summer thing never heard of it. I’m pretty sure the normal rules apply. I know you can withdraw from summer classes up until finals to void all the classes you’ve taken in summer. Some ppl take only one class over summer for example and withdraw if they don’t like what they think their grade will be."
berkeley,fokqlx3,t1_fokmx0c,1587847072.0,Econ 2 has more lecture in lieu of discussion. I think it’s usually only offered in spring as well
berkeley,fo8ovny,t1_fo8nmpm,1587600837.0,"Both are fine as “first CS upper divs”. Both have lots of resources and don’t require knowledge from any classes besides the prereqs 

I personally took 170 bc I was more interested in algorithms but maybe you like AI more, in which case take 188"
cscareerquestions,fo8l8g3,t1_fo8k91i,1587598748.0,"Junior, I’m graduating next year."
berkeley,fo63coo,t1_fo5xxab,1587544962.0,"It’s hard to put a number on it, and it’s very varied. I’d say to do pretty well on an average courseload, maybe 25 hrs a week? including lecture and discussion. And this will increase around midterm and finals season

But it really depends on your goals and priorities and aspirations. I have engineering friends who don’t have to put in that much time to do pretty well and are taking balanced courselods, and they’re in a frat as well as some clubs. I have some engineering friends who spend much more time and really challenge themselves with heavy courseloads and do research."
berkeley,fo5i4wj,t1_fo5cw10,1587526211.0,"For lower divs, 61A and 61B overlap. You can also overlap some upper divs if u pick CS electives. There’s a lot of overlap tbh, most people don’t actually go for a CS DS double they’d rather go for CS and stats or some thing. 

The reasoning is that a serious DS career usually requires high levels of education that u can’t really get from a DS major alone, bc it’s kind of an almagation of basic CS and basic stats (vs a pure CS or stats major where u get a lot more exposure to the concepts and theory). At least from what I’ve heard."
berkeley,fo4vsqk,t3_fqdm9d,1587512196.0,Is data 100 safe to phase 2? My only other phase 2 consideration is 162 but I think that fills up faster.
cscareerquestions,fnjly13,t1_fnjhbvw,1587001760.0,This was really helpful and that blog is great. Thank you!!
berkeley,fnd3u1q,t1_fncnqv3,1586857674.0,"No one knows. Hopefully it’ll be on campus since things will hopefully improve by then. I think you should just keep everything normal, the school will contact you if there will be issues. Keep in mind that like 15% of our school is international students so you’re not alone at all in this."
csMajors,fncmsnu,t1_fnch86x,1586840847.0,They expanded their intern program recently
berkeley,fnarm0e,t1_fnaphwl,1586802594.0,"Lol I think it’s on the first page after you select your application. Same page as your name, phone number and all that info. If u really can’t find it just email them."
berkeley,fn9fo38,t1_fn8m8ie,1586771156.0,"If it’s what I’m thinking, not that much bigger. I think the large ones are on the top floor so they have taller ceilings. 

Obviously pref those higher than the small ones, but it really is not a big size diff"
berkeley,fn9ehti,t1_fn93ywb,1586769852.0,Also double check that you both put your genders M or F down. That happened to me in the past when my roommate put unspecified.
berkeley,fn7q5wd,t1_fn6ywtx,1586725388.0,"1.	 Freshmen get housing if they apply by the priority deadline. But no, housing is not guaranteed. Possible to get it for their second year, but most people move off campus after first year. 
2.	it’s fine. I’m not international so many others can speak to it more bu there’s plenty of clubs and orgs they can join"
berkeley,fn5z3z6,t1_fn2tyd6,1586681120.0,"I wouldn’t say it’s deflated. Definitely isn’t inflated though. Most stem major classes are curved to a B/B- avg, which I hear is normal for a lot of colleges. High GPAs (3.8+) are still very possible and common here though, if u study hard or are naturally very smart 

It might be harder to get a 4.0 here vs grade inflating schools, but you graduate with a pretty high GPA, it’s much more impressive to grad schools."
berkeley,fn5yyvy,t1_fn44nub,1586680970.0,Yeah consider it for sure. I think I would hate the quarter system. It’s just too fast and semester gives u enough time to better understand content/give leeway if u fall behind for a bit. Also it gives us time for dead week before finals (no instruction the week before finals)
berkeley,fn5yw5s,t1_fn4qdrp,1586680891.0,"I Also definitely say Berkeley. Recognized for a better CS program and better overall school brand, better recruiting location bu the Bay also. Social life here is much better than GTech form what I’ve heard about them too."
berkeley,fn4boc0,t1_fn4am7q,1586638071.0,"1.	Don’t know regularly since this was a pilot year. I’d wager 20-30 in the future?
2.	Yes u do. Double check when you apply though"
berkeley,fn2p875,t1_fmy08l8,1586597727.0,"To answer 2, a lot of people recommend either units 1/2 or blackwell. Clark kerr potentially too (it’s just far), unit 3 (just old) are good too. These are all pretty social and people like them the most. Def recommend res hall over apt or mini suites as a freshmen bc you meet way more people 

Foothill is least desirable usually."
berkeley,fn2p4ci,t1_fmyj1vt,1586597602.0,There’s usually at least a few fb groups for incoming students. Try looking up “Uc berkeley class of 2024” or something like that
berkeley,fn2p361,t1_fn16dl3,1586597561.0,"Agreed 100%. In such a big school like cal, there will be so many people who are social, and so many people who are not. If u want to have an active social life, just find that group of friends who want it too. 

And yeah UCB has better name recognition and programs than USC save for some very specific majors"
berkeley,fn2oztd,t1_fn1olfu,1586597455.0,"Agree w the other commentator. Any English sounding department (complit, English, rhetoric etc) is usually harder. For easier, the ones offered by other language departments (German, french, Scandinavian, etc) tend to be seen as easier. You don’t need to know that language btw, they’re all translated english texts taught in English, just written by authors of other cultures or set in those countries

But R&C difficulty varies a lot bc grading is all from your GSI. So just bc it is German r5a doesn’t mean it’s easy, look up reviews for your GSI if u can find them"
berkeley,fn2os3l,t1_fn22xpi,1586597206.0,"Have some friends in it. Basically more personalized and special advising, industry contacts/direct connections (since the program started from some people in industry). I think there’s like another seminar course or two they take (not 100% sure but it’s not a difficult class). 

Overall it’d def be worth it over regular Haas if you’re looking for that bio business intersection and like both majors, but not just for program name if u really aren’t interested in bio (mcb is not an easy major)"
cscareerquestions,fmyynxs,t1_fmyuzz3,1586500002.0,Definitely send an email to follow up and ask
csMajors,fmya4qp,t1_fmxxfs3,1586481447.0,Yeah I just had strings and array summing. My friend said he had a bit manipulation and some prefix/postfix thing.
csMajors,fmya1ca,t1_fmxzpf2,1586481385.0,Yes. I wouldn’t have gotten the last one if I hadn’t seen something like it before though. Some tricky math trick
csMajors,fmxqv8s,t3_fxnlu3,1586470112.0,I had one easy one medium one hard. But my friend who took it had diff questions from me. Nothing crazy though

berkeley,fmvntd2,t1_fmu7hd0,1586423934.0,"There’s definitely a thriving social scene. The schools big enough to find your own community. While greek life isn’t as big here as other schools, they’re still the go to place to party for a lot of students, especially underclassmen. Theres also a few bars around campus that upperclassmen go to. 

There’s always huge groups of students on thurs-sat nights roaming around frat row or up and down Durant 

If you join any clubs, most of them have their own parties too

Tldr If you want to party, you’ll be able to do it. If you don’t that’s very possible too"
cscareerquestions,fmuly75,t3_fxcwgx,1586393997.0,"Recommend a CS minor. I go to berkeley. With the minor you’ll have proof of accomplishment, and I don’t think it’s worth doing EECS minor and 16ab bc they’re not very well structured and the stuff you learn isn’t that applicable to most CS upper divs that people w minors would take. 

Getting into 61ab and 70 shouldn’t be a big issue bc they’re huge, and I agree w the other commenter on 170 and 162 and maybe 184. I don’t think you’ll have too much difficulty getting into the upper divs if ur smart w enrollment bc they’re all still decently big."
berkeley,fmr4h2y,t1_fmr3k6w,1586313670.0,"Yeah I don’t think it’s hard to declare. But it’s much easier to sleep easy when you know you have a major already. 

I agree that an Ivy like Cornell doesn’t help that much w recruiting, but if it’s the same cost and all, and you’ll get easier access to more resources and you tend to get more facetime and care put on you when you go to a rich private school, then I think it’s something to heavily weigh 

Also some industries, especially in quant and finance only like to recruit from ivies and east coast schools if that’s something OP is interested in. Still possible to get jobs there from cal and I know ppl who do it. It’s just much more work on your part to get there 

I think at the end of the day it’s up to school culture and location as well and especially cost, but resource-wise I feel Cornell is a pretty obvious choice all things considered"
berkeley,fmr3855,t1_fmqy04t,1586312838.0,"Usually CS 61A or premed classes (like chem 1a) are tough. Math 1B is too. I mean it really depends on your background and interest and major. 

At the end of the day though you’ll do fine. Think about all the people who’ve come to this school in the past 150 yrs and graduated in your major. They all took the same classes as you will and they all graduated to go to great places."
berkeley,fmr2v4y,t3_fwxe9k,1586312595.0,"If cost isn’t an issue then tbh Cornell. You get guaranteed major (it’s not that hard to declare if you’re on top of your work, but you don’t need to worry about it if ur guaranteed ), smaller class sizes, more care put on you bc it’s a smaller school w more resources. I mean I love cal and wouldn’t want to be elsewhere but these are things to keep in mind depending on the person 

And it’s an Ivy so it’ll help in case you go to a job/industry that cares about that sort of thing."
