I think she thought that I came in late and just wanted credit, so she just feigned ignorance and told me that there was no sign in sheet. I ended up getting a hold on my account, because I 'didnt' go."

The CC I went to before has not decided to go online for the Summer yet and the schedule doesn't come out until May/June. Most CC's has at least one course that will transfer to UCR, so the first thing I would do would be to pick a CC then do some research around that CC. gl!"

All the lectures are prerecorded and are made available at the start of the week. To be honest, I don't really like the way she is formatting the class, maybe someone in Becker has a better experience."
