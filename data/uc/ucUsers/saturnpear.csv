ucr,fp972fm,t3_gc3dj9,1588416834.0,No offense but I don’t really think anyone should be planning parties rn...don’t be those Florida kids y’all
ucr,fp8myb9,t3_gc0qxd,1588396694.0,All I know is that the overall cost was 1 million dollars which is absolutelyyyy insane
ucr,fn90xok,t1_fn8z9j9,1586755862.0,"Omg yes twin!!! 
us being in the same boat is honestly kind of comforting. I always felt like I was dramatic for getting sad about this stuff but I really do want to live my life to the fullest. I’ve tried pretty hard to come out of my shell and put myself out there and all that but I still haven’t forged a lot of good relationships. (sure would be nice if us hermits on reddit could all meet up with each other haha) 
You make a really good point though - I came to ucr to learn and that aspect of my life is going well, so I guess that’s good enough for now. 
So thank you and good luck to you! I hope your third year here goes a lot better for you."
ucr,fn90duf,t1_fn8zd4q,1586755372.0,"ahh sorry i made that unclear!! i meant that my friends party a lot but never invite me to come along so i’ve just never gotten to experience it. i guess they don’t include me since i don’t come off as the partying type. i’m pretty introverted, but it makes me kinda insecure sometimes since everyone around me is super social. thank you for the reassurance though, i think i really just needed to be told that it’s fine to do my own thing and not compare myself to others. and yes i’m totally NOT mentally stable enough for a boyfriend rn lolol but i’m gonna do my best to work on myself too. thank you so much for being so sweet! gn to you too :>"
ucr,fn8xkpf,t1_fn8wlfr,1586753005.0,"I really appreciate this wisdom, you’re like the first person to tell me something like that. Everyone else kinda has this carefree attitude or tries to pressure me into stuff but it’s just not me. I don’t wanna do things I’ll regret in the future, so I’m gonna go at my own pace. And thank you! I hope your quarantine is going well too :D"
ucr,fn8x7zp,t1_fn8vijw,1586752718.0,Right! I’m glad I’m not the only one who feels like this. I’m really sorry you haven’t made friends though ): I’ve found that making friends in college is way harder than high school and it sucks. I know it’s easier said than done but try to put yourself out there for that last quarter! I hope you can make it memorable and you won’t be stuck in the same spot.
ucr,fn8uvxg,t1_fn8u08j,1586750868.0,"This is a good point, thank you both. I’m hesitant to do a lot of things in college because I’m worried about the consequences, but then I see everyone else doing it and getting away with it and I just feel like a prude. But honestly it’s better to just do my own thing for now and wait until I’m older with more money lolol"
ucr,fn8uiw7,t1_fn8sd5s,1586750594.0,I can’t express how reassuring this comment was lol thank you for validating me. just watching everyone talk about how much fun they had at school made me feel so left out but I really shouldn’t be comparing myself to other people. I’ll try my best to keep busy (:
