Not true. The vast majority of research money comes from external research grants that professors have to apply and secure themselves."

Tell your landlord to sue you if he wants to see the money. And use that as a negotiating tactic to greatly reduce what he would charge you. There's 0% chance he will find someone so he has the incentive to reduce it."

GradSchool,fkmz1xl,t1_fklleoz,1584345937.0,"Couldn't disagree more. The overworked culture of academia is so bad, being a ""lower class worker"" is still better in terms of money. Gradschool pays worse than minimum wage.

Don't get me wrong, unemployment goes up a lot, so if you are unemployed that's worse. But I can also point you to all the grad students that get paid less than the cost of living for their area and have to take out loans, or the PI's that threaten to cut your pay (and do) if you dont get enough results or when funding ends and theres not enough TA-ships to cover you, etc."
