UCSD,fpahwee,t3_gcaa40,1588448515.0,"In my opinion, they're much harder. Professors try to compensate for the duration of the class being shorter but more often than not, end up over compensating. Add that on top of the fact that it will be online only, I wish you the best of luck.

Sometimes the school hires teachers from other schools (SDSU) over summer session and the class is generally easier. Look into the professors online resume and see if they're tenured at UCSD or coming in from a state school. If that's the case, always go for it."

Never forget the university is a business and will always treat you as so, even when you are at your most vulnerable."

UCSD,fklcttf,t1_fkla4rh,1584303542.0,"I get the idea of it being open note but you have to keep in mind certain people at this university (Especially STEM oriented classes) have a large amount of financial resources. In one of my classes, a survey was taken and about 60% of the class were international. Last time I checked international students pay about 50k in tuition per year at a minimum. 

The thing I would be most afraid of is people straight up paying other people to take their tests for them. What's stopping the rich kids from hiring people to just do their tests for them? I've heard of people paying $200+ for a single assignment in CSE 8A (An intro course). With a moderate amount of IT knowledge and camera angles, you can figure out how to do this fairly easily. 

I'm not saying you should do this but it certainly is a possibility. I think it would be foolish to assume people wouldn't go this extent as well since this isnt high school anymore and GPA matters (to an extent). Maybe to kids who dont care about working at Microsoft or Goldman Sachs, their GPA's wont matter but to others, it will and people will do anything for that."
