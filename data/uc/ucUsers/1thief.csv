Bro a job is voluntary. If you want a half a year off to fuck around go for it. Hell get some savings and take a year or two off. Just remember that during this time you won't be getting paid and you won't be maintaining or growing your skills. When you work a few years it's not even that hard to save up your vacation time and take even a month off every year, that's with getting paid."

Coronavirus may or may have not been designed in someone's lab, that doesn't really matter at this point. What's more important is that a virus like the coronavirus could be designed in a lab with just the right virulence, just the right lethality, just the right incubation period produced in sufficient quantities and released in enough locations at once to overwhelm containment efforts. Poof there goes salvation by vaccine, get ready for another year or two of health crisis, economic crisis, society grinding to a halt. Biotech is getting pretty damned good, I bet a reasonably intelligent person could bioprint sarscov2 with some commercially available equipment and a few months of research from its genome. I wonder why bioterrorism events don't happen more often."
