UCSD,fph3e2g,t3_gd5s4k,1588614258.0,"Mixed bag for me. Some of my classes (MMW 15, DSC 160, ANSC 165) seem more lenient/fair. On the other hand, DSC 100 and MATH 189 seem way more unfair due to the at-home nature of everything (more difficult exams, vague instructions, lots of points taken off for minor things). Or maybe I’m just dumb lmao."
UCSD,fph2q28,t3_gd10sz,1588613921.0,"I think that working across time zones is an essential skill in today’s day and age and having group projects rn seems like a good way to practice that. For me, the issue with group projects during all of this is the fact that more classes are now P/NP, which can be a bit worrying if a group has people mixed between letter grade and P/NP as some of those taking a class P/NP might not put in as much work as they don’t really need to to hit their desired grade (this was explained as the main reason why COGS 120/CSE 170 was not allowed to be taken P/NP last quarter)."
TrueCrime,fp34wc2,t3_gaxa88,1588273133.0,"The Devil in the White City is an interesting book. I read it for AP US History back when I was in High School and from what I remember, I revolves more around the Chicago World Fair than it does on the Holmes murders. Definitely not as much of a dedicated “true crime” book but still a very interesting read if you’re into history along with stories about Holmes and his crimes."
interestingasfuck,fopwlwf,t1_fopedvk,1587974584.0,My mom grew up there and my grandparents live there! So crazy to me to see that this picture is from somewhere that has a lot of significance to me.
whatisthiscar,foniqku,t1_fonhh1w,1587920271.0,"911 is the model name, 992 is the generation. Most cars that are updated throughout the years have generation names. Take for example the Corvette, which use C1-8 for its generation names, despite being a Corvette throughout all those years. In this case, 992 refers to all the Porsche 911s of this generation which started being made late last year. This allows you to differentiate between it and older generations such as 991, 997, etc."

UCSD,foix2co,t3_g7hf1e,1587799948.0,There’s this one dude who has been in almost all of my Data Science classes that consistently answers student questions on Piazza quicker and better than most TAs do. Absolutely insane.

UCSD,fnsynxw,t3_g3r34v,1587231300.0,I don't think it's worth it if you have to take out that much in loans.
whatcarshouldIbuy,fnsy1hz,t3_g3moiy,1587230963.0,"I have an A6 3.0T and it definitely fits your bill. It's really quick (definitely quicker than what it's rated from factory), very comfortable, and reliable for what it is. Steering is a bit numb, even in Dynamic, but it's very fast for what it is and will probably last you a while."
cars,fnsseze,t1_fnsrwjp,1587227912.0,I personally find R to have one of the lower barriers to entry in terms of learning. More advanced stuff will definitely be harder to figure out without a programming background but by the time you get there you'll hopefully have a solid foundation in the language.

cars,fnqtx1u,t1_fnqsjxj,1587172139.0,I've actually been looking at these. They seem really interesting and they're way more affordable now (and I assume they'll be even more affordable in 2 years). Don't have much experience with Cadillac apart from riding in my friend's CT6 a few times but could be nice to check them out!

frugalmalefashion,fnj839v,t1_fni2iow,1586993758.0,"They definitely have better sales twice a year. I personally would wait out for those because you will find a lot of stuff >50% off. However, there are some of the newer season items that are not included in that sale and if that’s up your alley, maybe this sale could help out (but probably not much if SSENSE is raising MSRP figures)."
UCSD,fngl598,t3_g0f99c,1586935765.0,I really wonder what this stock image was intended for.
