Especially pupil size and position. Or mess with photo contrast and light and shadows to see if you can bring this detail out in the photo.
learnart,fn77klu,t3_g00b9y,1586714834.0,"What medium is this? Is it one where you can pencil sketch in things (pupils, eye shape) first to make sure they “look right”? With acrylics this is what I do. They are opaque enough to cover it. 

If you are not going for a really realistic look, which is totally fine and can even be more interesting, then I won’t add any more advice. Right now I would say it’s approximately realistic. And for what it’s worth, it looks good and I encourage you to keep going with art if you enjoy it!

But if you are going for more realism then I think you could benefit from practicing drawing more first, specifically matching shapes and proportions to those in the reference. Look back and forth from reference to drawing a lot, looking at each specific feature (face outline, ears, eyes, snout, nose tip, etc.) to see if it matches in angles and relative size. Grid at first if you need to. 

In short, when you copy things accurately they “look right”. When they don’t you have to go back and find all the ways in which they don’t match the reference. But this is only one style is art."

Also use photo editing software to emphasize shadows and increase contrast. Helps you see more than you can see :) 
(Assuming you are working from a ref)"
