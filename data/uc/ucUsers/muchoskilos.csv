My top choices would be a single-speed road bike or a city / hybrid bike. Mountain bikes are a decent choice but they are slower and unnecessary in Davis. Avoid cruisers at all costs.

Also, invest in a good U-Lock because it decreases the likelihood of bike theft. Getting your bike stolen is not only a financial pain, but it's frustrating and a waste of time to deal with."
UCDavis,fo9biss,t3_g6fv8d,1587615134.0,"First of all, contact your landlord and explain your situation. You are willing to stay on the lease and pay rent, so make that clear. I believe that you cannot be evicted at this time, so you should be safe for a couple of months or so. Make sure to check the law and see if you landlord is allowed to boot you two for not contributing enough rent. Best of luck!"
UCDavis,fo4cv4z,t3_g550jc,1587502157.0,Spend about as much as you would on a Walmart bike but instead get an old road bike on Craigslist. Getting a good U-Lock is a good idea but it's best to not leave the bike on campus overnight. Most of my friends who did that had their wheels or bikes stolen at some point.
UCDavis,fo4cgpz,t1_fo46x7p,1587501955.0,MATLAB is really useful if you put in the time to truly unleash its capabilities :)
UCDavis,fnb2y9j,t1_fnb1cig,1586808294.0,"In this case, it is 100% a scam."
UCDavis,fnb0te6,t3_g0pmpp,1586807241.0,"Is it something that you applied for? Can you get in touch with the company through some other means? It doesn't look legit and the pay is insane for 2-6 hours of work a week. However, in the slim chance that it is right, do not give out any information until you know more. Good luck!"
UCDavis,fnb0iy0,t3_g0pt3j,1586807099.0,"The dorm assignments are random this year so you can't choose between Segundo, Tercero, or Cuarto. Tercero and Segundo are on campus and will give you a similarly social experience as well as similar proximity to class. Cuarto feels more like apartment living with suite-style dorms and common areas."

UCDavis,fn4etrq,t3_fywqur,1586639925.0,"That's not a very low price for 1050 sq.ft. with only 3 bedrooms. Also, this post belongs on the Facebook housing group."
UCDavis,fmxmblh,t3_fxqg9s,1586467670.0,"As much as you would like to know, all I can say is that whether there is a curve or not, you should do your best and the grades will figure themselves out."
UCDavis,fmn2e9x,t1_fmmg3s9,1586216771.0,Maybe you're confusing miles and kilometers? 30 km/h average is pretty quick in the city for most fit commuters. 30 mph is peak Time Trial / Criterion speeds for professional racers.
UCDavis,fmltpg7,t1_fmjdcxx,1586193046.0,"That is correct. However, I am pretty sure that a lot less than 1% of people are capable of reaching those speeds, let alone willing to go that fast on campus."
UCDavis,fmltdrj,t1_fmlof9n,1586192876.0,"That's a good move. While many people say to avoid housing with friends, I found that knowing your roommate helps reduce the risk of getting someone insane."
