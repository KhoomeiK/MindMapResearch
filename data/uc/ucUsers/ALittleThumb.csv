berkeley,fnfzxaf,t3_g1ece9,1586919111.0,"I think 188 would be a nice first upper div. Do be careful, the class has changed ALOT in the last few semesters... I’m in it rn, but I’m about to late drop it lol. The content is not very hard, but the sheer amount of work makes it feel very much like a lower div. There are back to back homework’s and projects the entire semester, and the homework’s are honestly long..... if anything, you’re not very likely to fall behind cuz all the assignments. 

On the other hand, 188 is probably not going to be one of those core upperdivs you have to take to get jobs or whatnot, but I think pairing it with 61C is a nice transition to upper divs in general. 

I wouldn’t take 162 without 61C. Having taken 161 and 168, looking back, I think 168 would be a very nice class to take with 162 when Spring comes around. 162 covers networking stack pretty well, but it doesn’t put the entire computer networks  into perspective, combining it with 168 would make the very important networking concept easier to understand. Also, 168 is pretty lightweight imo

Afterwards, you’d be very well prepared to take 161. And you can take it with 170 if you want (a busy schedule, but you’ll be used to the vigor)"

But the sheer amount of work, back to back nontrivial homeworks AND projects for the entire semester...., feels very much like a lower div...... tbh, I think the class has become a really nice 1st CS upper div to take because it still throws at you assignments to make sure you’re on top of your learning.

TLDR: treat 188 time consumption as a lower div"

berkeley,fkmyj91,t1_fkmygj9,1584345291.0,I agree. UCI already cancelled their grad ceremony too...
