UCSantaBarbara,fnqco35,t1_fnnwpcd,1587162027.0,"This so true, physics lab grading is almost predetermined. When I compared labs with other ppl they had pretty much the same thing and they got 3 grades lower... The only thing separating good lab grades and bad lab grades are picky grading and sig figs."

UCSantaBarbara,fmxrnb1,t1_fmxjxdl,1586470539.0,"Why are you speaking for other people, when you don't even know what they're going through? Maybe your professors aren't assigning extra work, but some are overwhelming their students. Smh."
UCSantaBarbara,fmqtwhb,t3_fwvx4o,1586306964.0,"So far from what i know, everyone feels the same damn way. A bunch of us has emailed him for help, and he just laughed at us so... Idk is there a way to report him to the department or something? Hes being unfair in terms of regular standards let alone in times like these. Were honestly being so fair and patient with him and it seems like he just doesnt give a crap. Its just saddening we have 8+ hrs of lectures and no idea what were being tested on :( Really wish I had prof Lewis right now :(((("
