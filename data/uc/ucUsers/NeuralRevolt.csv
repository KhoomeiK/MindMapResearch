Psychology nowadays is shifting more towards brain sciences; if you think you would enjoy taking some basic science classes and then transitioning into a more brain science oriented field of study, i would recommend it.

I think that, in general, psychology is going to continue to shift towards the sciences until it eventually won’t be available as a Bachelor of Arts degree anymore.

I am not studying sociology, but I imagine there are less “hard science” classes involved. Perhaps if science isn’t enjoyable for you, you can consider this."

UCSantaBarbara,fnn8fm7,t3_g2r108,1587086688.0,"All of my professors (PSY department) have been pretty realistic about it and just told us that the quizzes (haven’t had an exam yet) are obviously open note and they obviously can’t stop us from using them, but that we should still study beforehand just like a regular quiz so that we don’t end up sifting through all the material and run out of time.

I think it’s a fair and realistic compromise. Professors using ProctorU is insane to me.

Just a side note; I used to work for a company that did proctored exams (I was a proctor a few times when I needed to fill in), and the proctoring process was kind of a joke. I haven’t done ProctorU, so maybe this is off base, but I will share my experiences. 


If you obviously cheated it would show up, but just think about the logistics of proctoring.

You’ve got hundreds, thousands of students taking exams and turning them in all at once. The number of staff that can ever go through all of these sessions will be limited, so a lot of the “proctoring” is just making sure you don’t do anything OBVIOUS. During heavy workloads, some of our proctors were proctoring multiple people at once, there was no way to keep up with the number of students and truly give attention to each and every exam. 

Especially with all the increase in volume ProctorU is experiencing, I don’t see how any realistic business model could ever genuinely say that there wasn’t any cheating on exams that didn’t get flagged 

Since professors should know about these poor logistics, it makes more sense for then to just design the exam to still be difficult even in its open note. I think it’s absurd for them to use this system, and of course all of the privacy issues that have been brought up on this sub are also major concerns.

Last thought ( I know this is a long post), but AS senate seems to be trying to push for administration to end ProctorU for the quarter and permanently.
Apparently, the faculty association also released a letter in opposition to ProctorU, so there is some heft behind ending it."

I mean, labor value is a function of physics. That’s why Einstein was a Marxist. Capital has value in its physical properties, and labor value does as well. It’s literally energy being combined.

Let’s say that there’s a taco stand with one employee.

Ingredients, advertising, equipment = capital 

Labor of employee = Labor

Capital + Labor = Production 

Let’s say the combined value of the capital is 50 units of value.

And let’s say the value of the labor is also 50 units of value (literally kinetic energy)

50 units of capital value + 50 units of labor value = 100 units of value in the product or service created.

Then we sell that product for its market value; let’s say it’s worth 100 dollars.

100 units of value —> $100

Now we need to give the $100 to the capitalist and the employee. If the capitalist and employee each received what their input was (the relation between value and market value):

The capitalist receives $50

The laborer receives $50

The capitalist hasn’t made a profit; all he can do with $50 is buy back the same capital (50 units of value) so that production can keep going; under capitalism, this cannot occur.

Therefore, for him to make... say $10 of profit, he must take $10 from the worker.

So the capitalist puts in 50 units of value, and gets $60 market value for a profit of $10

The worker receives $40, despite the fact that their the market value of their labor was $50

Then we get into stuff like falling rate of profit; capitalist have to grow their profits due to a number of factors (inflation, competition, greed) and thusly, the laborer will still procure labor value worth $50, but the amount they receive over time must decrease for the capitalist to feed his ever growing profits. 

So, the $40 becomes $30, and then $20. Sometimes the value taken is not in the form of wage, but in working conditions. So I might still make $40, but now I get shorter breaks, stock options removed, etc. etc.

This is why people say that capitalism doesn’t make sense; you cannot have infinite profit on a planet with limited resources (and those resources include the labor value of the workers). 

For someone to say that labor doesn’t have value literally defies physics. I always find it easier to convince people of this truth by actually writing out the simple equation above (capital + labor = production), since it makes it more factual and not some subjective conversation.

Labor has value. Period."

You say that Adam Smith and Ricardo we’re wrong; so what makes you think modern day capitalist economists can’t be wrong?

Dude, look at the COVID crisis. The economy is crashing because the methods of dealing with COVID pull workers out of their jobs and stop them from adding their labor value. When their labor value isn’t added to capital, there is no profit to be made because you can’t underpay your workers less than what they produce when they aren’t producing anything.

That’s why your economist buddies are going on new channels and saying we need to end the social distancing and lockdowns. Because they need workers to go to work and add their labor value, and if that doesn’t happen, this whole system doesn’t work.

You are literally living through a situation where the LTV is being put on display right in front of us, and you refuse to see it. That’s crazy dude. Open your eyes. It’s right in front of you"
PublicFreakout,fn3tlo0,t1_fn3tbc2,1586627659.0,"Really? Because Thomas Piketty proved that the LTV is true with his book “Capital in the 21st Century” and it’s lauded by economists, even capitalist economists.

His solution isn’t a Marxist solution ( he proposes a wealth tax), but the contention he gives:

Income inequality is when r > G

Is literally the labor theory of value, rewritten. Profit ( r) is based on paying workers less than their value; when capitalist make too much profit, it creates income inequality, with G being the sum total of value produced by workers.

Again, all you do is keep saying stuff but there’s no argument there. If there are three ways to disapprove LTV, I welcome you to take the time to post those in a reply.

And when you say it’s not accepted that’s nonsense; I have spoken with university economic professors that are absolutely neoclassical ideologues and even they admit it’s true. They don’t like that it’s true, but they admit it."

It’s not subjective; if you have capital worth 50 units of value, and I add my labor, my labor also has value. Let’s say it was 50 units of value.

50 units of value of capital + 50 units of value of labor= 100 units of value of the product of service produced.

You are aware that Adam smith and Dave Ricardo has labor theories of value, right? All Marx did was use their LTV to show that capitalism was unsustainable and explorative. Albert Einstein was a Marxist because LTV is objectively true.

HistoryMemes,fn3ip3x,t1_fn3ic2t,1586621533.0,"There are three major economic schools. 

Neoclassical is the right wing economic theory that espouses free market capitalism.

Kanyesian economics is the moderate form of economics that espouses government involvement in the economy. Richard Nixon, a conservative, was a believer in Kensyian economics. FDR was considered “the man who saved capitalism” because Keynesian economics was required post Great Depression to stop revolution and shore up the inherent instability in free market capitalism.

Marxist economics is the left wing economic ideology that espouses government ownership and, in the case of non-government production, worker co ops in the market.
