UCSD,foze69v,t1_foze42z,1588189158.0,No :(
UCSD,foy9392,t3_ga6hid,1588168024.0,"What helps me is I maintain a strict sleep-work schedule. I wake up at 6:45 am, start doing school work at 8 am and keep working till 9 pm. Then I got to sleep at 10:30 pm"
NoStupidQuestions,fovxllw,t3_g9vzzh,1588109302.0,"I’m a sophomore in college so I don’t know how this works for high school, but at my university (UCSD) a P (Pass) is an option you can take for non-major courses that you essentially just need a C- in the class to pass. You get units for it, but there is no effect on your GPA. So essentially, A C- or an A+ isn’t worth any different other than you pass"
UCSD,fo8t17s,t1_fo8szzw,1587603236.0,no idea
UCSD,fo8lbq2,t3_g69vc6,1587598800.0,You’re not alone. I felt like I understood things really well and ended up getting 45/60 :/
UCSD,fo8l76y,t3_g6adeh,1587598727.0,"Same! I watch all my lecture vids for one class, understood it, took the test, 75%. At least the average was 68%"
UCSD,fo6sor7,t3_g5w8wn,1587565981.0,Cheating in the first place is not smart but cheating for BILD 3? When I took it we didn’t even have homework

UCSD,fnl1asb,t3_g28zyj,1587044929.0,"Struggling, Took a quiz worth 18% of my grade on Monday and felt absolutely destroyed by it even though I studied like crazy.

Taking my first quarter of Ochem and it is extremely difficult because the HW and lectures do not match up, MCWP 50 is very time consuming. Only class I like is Opera"
AnimalCrossing,fnjybm5,t3_g27p95,1587009924.0,Dude where are you getting such cool stuff! My nook’s cranny has had the same toaster for 3 days :/
AmItheAsshole,fng900r,t3_g1asrw,1586925340.0,"100% YTA

This is essentially the same thing as getting mad at someone else eating a donut while you’re on a diet. Don’t force others to sacrifice stuff for you"
UCSD,fng5t9o,t1_fng56yu,1586923027.0,Thank you!

UCSD,fnfomnn,t1_fnfn8om,1586912252.0,"My 40 TA was just not a nice person. I remember I accidentally did not cite sources properly and she did not mention it EVEN THOUGH I wrote 2 papers THAT SHE COMMENTED ON before I got an email threatening me with possible expulsion from the university via the Integrity office. 

This was during my first Quarter at UCSD. I was fresh out of high school"
UCSD,fnfjngw,t3_g1frsd,1586909351.0,"My TA is actually really nice! Nothing at all like my MCWP 40 TA. I’m sorry to hear your TA isn’t the best, I know how that is"
UCSD,fnc3osb,t3_g0vwxn,1586827953.0,"Human Bio Major here, I just finished all of BILD last quarter and based on my opinion this is how I would rank the BILD Classes from hardest to easiest along with the grades I got in each for reference.

1. BILD 2 (A-)
2. BILD 1 (B+)
3. BILD 4 (A)
4. BILD 3 (A+)

For some odd reason most people don’t like BILD 3, which focuses on evolution and ecology but I think it was very straight forward. BILD 4 is a lab class that relies heavily on group work, so it really depends on who you end up with. Personally I think BILD 1-2 are the most memorization and content heavy, so I think if you did fine in those two you can definitely do well in BILD 3"
UCSD,fnb7kjn,t1_fnb70wk,1586810603.0,Dude I was so thrown off by the questions. I felt that the practice test and problem sets were 1000000x easier to understand than any question on that one. Really bums me out because she is NOT a bad prof but the test do not reflect class that well
UCSD,fna7var,t3_g0l8gl,1586792673.0,Yup
UCSD,fn7d7dq,t3_g02a75,1586718019.0,Yes. It is Awful. 100%. I live 30 minutes from campus and I get to school at 6:30am just to get a spot
UCSD,fn4x7c1,t1_fn4x25t,1586650947.0,I honestly don’t remember but my Ta (who is awesome and has no control over it) mentioned it. Needless to say she was also not pleased
UCSD,fn3tftp,t3_fyvuh2,1586627568.0,"100000%. I’m in Ochem rn and I’m actually AHEAD (podcast wise) but I STILL AM struggling. Also in MCWP and the Muir Writing department decided to make our lives easier by increasing the word count on my assignments :)

I seriously do not understand why this quarter has to be as difficult as it us."
UCSD,fmudvfq,t3_fxh6nn,1586389470.0,Dude for your own sanity I would drop down to 16. I’m only taking 2 major course this quarter and I’m dying
UCSD,fmudfkq,t1_fmu57qi,1586389224.0,Dang I’m in the wrong major

UCSD,fmmpads,t3_fw7kav,1586209493.0,"YES! I’m glad someone else sees it! It’s only week 2 and I feel extremely behind even though I watch all my lectures, do my HW. I really feel like I’m failing right out the gate"
