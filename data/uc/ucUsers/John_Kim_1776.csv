ucla,fphwtyc,t1_fphwj40,1588629273.0,I've said this before and I'll say it again - I wouldn't be surprised if the use of racial slurs was done by USAC or one of their cronies trying to garner sympathy or manipulate the vote.
ucla,fphvii1,t3_gdjy6y,1588628574.0,"Apparently, there were people using racial slurs in the chat at one of the zoom meetings.  USAC decides to make huge leaps of logic by observing racism at a meeting, conflating racism with opposing the referendum, and calling those not supporting the referendum racist."

ucla,fpdv631,t1_fpdq19a,1588534875.0,"- The education we're receiving is pretty bad and not worth the price we're paying right now

- Learning material should be based on the fact you want to learn, not because of an incentive or lack thereof; that's why we're here at UCLA

- Agree with the point that a solid knowledge base but is necessary for all jobs, not just jobs where lives are at stake

- It matters that every working professional knows what they're doing, no one ever made an argument stating otherwise

- No one is loading up on classes right now, as classes are pretty much full right now, and it's too late in the quarter to catch up anyways

- There are measures in place so that grades aren't the only determinant for admission to a profession or graduate school

- Grades from quarter to quarter don't somehow ""taint"" each other; if anything, excelling in or failing to master material and bombing out in your next classes will demonstrate the extent to which one actually mastered the material during this time"
ucla,fpc6urc,t1_fpc6ad1,1588489584.0,"I see your point, but there are other things to consider:

(1) Potential adoption of this by other universities will raise grades throughout the country.  If graduate schools consider these circumstances and decide to basically turn a blind eye to this quarter, inflated grades across the board won't make a difference.  If graduate school do not consider these circumstances and look at grades, UCLA applicants will be at a disadvantage.

(2) Lowering the minimum significantly will still fail to account for individuals who are completely locked out of access to technology.  Abolishing optional or mandatory P/NP in favor of this system COMPLETELY eliminates any unevenness on the playing field.


And I would also like to say that I do acknowledge your personal point that many of my classes this quarter will easily be passed and acknowledge you make your point in good faith.  However, given these circumstances, I think that it would be best to treat everyone with the perspective that they could potentially be in a worse case scenario."
ucla,fpc5yfb,t1_fpc5si0,1588488712.0,"I definitely agree with you in this regard about being able to do well in easy classes.  However, I feel a double A system would be a great idea to alleviate stress on people who need grades for graduate school, those who are unable to access school materials due to inequitable conditions, and those who are just struggling in general (which I will say is most if not all of us)."
ucla,fpc5k77,t3_gck03j,1588488331.0,"An idea that's an alternative to mandatory P/NP would be a double A system, whereby a student receives an A or A- with grade distributions being done at the professor's discretion.

This eliminates problems faced by two types of students.  The vocal pre-law, pre-med, or other graduate school oriented student gets their well-needed GPA boost and not need to worry about a P/NP scheme.  Meanwhile, the student who intends to work after graduation gets a much needed grade boost.

That being said, there will always be the ""hErP dErP mUh gRaDe InFlaTiOn mErItoCraCy"" person when

(1) People are not equitably set up to succeed technologically, emotionally, physically, financially, etc. and should therefore not be graded / judged based on circumstances outside of their control.

(2) Other schools are doing this, putting their students at an unfair advantage when comparing GPAs across when the time does come to apply to graduate school.

(3) This person will point out that students will just stop giving a shit and do something to barely scratch and A or do absolutely nothing and get an A-.  That being said, I believe that spending time with family, friends, and one's community is far more important during this crisis, and choosing one's people over studying is understandable given the unique and trying circumstances.


To be honest, I'm surprised this hasn't come up in this subreddit too often, and I really wanted to throw this idea out there.  Here's a link to an article by Harvard explaining this system more in depth (though I don't know if Harvard students actually need it given their already massive grade inflation to be fair).

TLDR: The ""Double A"" grading system is the way forward and does not pose many downsides given the current situation."

ucla,fox21s0,t3_ga03r5,1588132218.0,"In this order:

(1) Test Scores

(2) Class Rigor & Grades

(3) High quality PIQs

(4) Active involvement in club(s) or activities, QUALITY OVER QUANTITY; cannot stress this part enough

(5) Ethnic / Regional / Generational diversity"

Agree with the optional funding though, especially given people's (including my own) financial situation."
ucla,fnk80up,t1_fnix7tf,1587017794.0,"Totally agree with the fact that people who bombed the zoom meeting were disgusting.  That being said, I also wouldn't be surprised that given the brigading and previous accusations of racism that USAC had someone on the inside do it so that they could further accuse the student body of racism and promote their agenda in an even more self-righteous way."
ucla,fnk6ruz,t1_fniyiy5,1587016674.0,"No one is brigading or harassing people other than you and your USAC cronies.  It doesn't help the fact that you beloved USAC leveled accusations of us so called online trolls as conducting a ""hate speech"" campaign.  Just because we want accountability and transparency for your spending habits, that doesn't make us racist.  In fact, trying to use being ""woke"" as your shield against all criticism is quite disgusting in my opinion.  And if you want to talk about empathy, please show some empathy for the children of parents who are struggling to pay for rent and put food on the goddamn table.  Us UCLA students are fed up with your taxation without representation crap, and our expression against your policies is perfectly justified.  Notice how I can criticize you without being a hateful POS, unlike your condescending, patronizing attitude.  So please stop brigading our sub and leave our wallets alone."

The plates are hex plates on the racks (2.5, 5, 10, 25, 35, and 45 lbs).  The plates on the deadlift platform are round plates (10, 25, 45, 55).  There are safety clips on every rack and on the j-hooks on the deadlift platform.  There are primarily power and some olympic bars with a single trap bar. 
 Bench area is comprised of three benches, one decline bench, one incline bench.
