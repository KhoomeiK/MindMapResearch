But honestly, I'm a firm believer in that some people are exponentially better when they study. People sometimes like to say ""the only reliable improvement you can expect to see is an increment of 10 points"" or something but I don't think that's true. Some people start really high, but then their ""cap"" is not particularly high for some reason (e.g. people starting at 166 and testing 171). But then there are students who may start low, but their cap is much higher. Basically, everyone is different and you shouldn't be discouraged by your score."

Being in school trains your mental rigor and endurance, so I'd imagine not being in that environment for 4 years may cause you to lose some ground.

unpopularopinion,foj3wqa,t3_g7lowt,1587807370.0,"women do approach men, it just doesn't happen as often. But I feel like nowadays it's getting more and more common for women to make the first move. I'm not even trying to brag when I say this but there have been a couple times a girl tried to pick me up at a bar the same way a man would w/ a woman 

Also, it makes sense for the norm to be how it is now. Basically, there's a reason why this happened, it wasn't all by chance. A man's commitment to passing his genes is very, very small. Basically as soon as a man ""finishes"" inside a woman, technically that is all he has to do. But for a woman, passing on her genes is at least a 9 month commitment where she has to literally nurse a child inside her body. So in this sense, in the ancestral environment a male sought to have sex w/ as many women as possible, as it secures the best chances for him to pass his genes to the next generation. But for a woman, it was advantageous for her to be selective and find a man that had high quality genes, and was committed/capable of protecting her. Remember, this is the ancestral environment where there were not any laws, and killing another person for their resources was common and necessary practice. Thus all in all, it makes sense that as our ancestors evolved and civilization came into fruition, that women be the selectors and men be the ones asking."

But honestly I think the majority of the decision they make will be based of how many people enroll vs. decline (the more that decline for your major, the better it is for you).  So your letter won't have THAT much of an impact unless you're providing significant new information. regardless, I'd personally recommend doing a bit of research on the different departments and features, and then writing a letter that shows why you would need those resources.

I think a big reason why sentiments have been changing is the ease at which we can access info. Of course the Internet has been around for a while now, but it's so easy to get  medical information anywhere nowadays. So what you have are patients who think they know more than doctors who are highly trained professionals. This is often what you see w/ the anti-vax community, I was watching a debate and the anti-vax side kept saying how their opinion shouldn't be trumped over by a doctor and whatnot. at the end of the day, it's good to be curious and skeptical to a certain extent, but people should understand that not all the info they get from forums and google searches is legit"

yeah we all complain, but I know when to stop. It's fruitless to spend so much energy on this... so are you expecting them to redistribute their wealth or something? Where does it stop? What about people who were born into wealth? Trust fund babies? Should we start taking their money and redistributing it based on the amount of hours they worked? How would you even begin to quantify what ""hard work"" means? Would it be based on the amount of hours, or the quality of work? Cuz theoretically, someone who is just more intelligent and talented than everyone can work significantly less and achieve more merits than someone who worked 3x as hard as them in the same job. What should we do w/ that person? These are all questions to consider when trying to find a solution to your implication. 

and yes, there are things I bitch about too. Just so you know, I've been on the butt end of having to work harder than others to achieve my merit. I am asian and I attend an elite university in America. As you may know, East Asians have to have significantly better grades and test scores than other minorities to get into the same colleges. I complained about it too initially, but I realized the issue is very, very deep. It's a dangerous game we play when we say everything should be about merit and hard work, cuz while that should be the DOMINANT factor, human beings are intrinsically not equal... some are more privileged than others, it's just the way it is."

Start putting castor oil on your eyebrows. the distance between your eyes and eyebrows is actually good for an asian (most of us have our eyebrows very far apart from our eyes), but your eyebrows are thin. I wouldn't recommend putting rogaine on them yet at your age, so use castor oil for now."

From children of nobility inheriting mass wealth, to reality tv stars, to now social media figures, there have always been people who became wealthy w/o putting in effort. 

tbh I don't think it's that bad, and I don't get the hate they receive. I mean, I don't think it's a respectable profession per se, but the advertisers want to pay them the big bucks so be it. 

it's great that you're a nurse but plenty of other people have worked just as hard as you for their profession. it is what it is. Life's not fair, I think about it too when I'm slaving away in college but what am I gonna do? You make the best of what you have and run w/ it, you're wasting energy by complaining about how unfair and ""not right"" it is. And for what it's worth, no one is stopping you from trying to achieve that career. There are social media influencers who work as nurses and doctors, ""influencer"" encompasses a broad category of people nowadays"

But still, a cashier is an expendable position that is becoming more and more scarce as self-running stores are becoming a thing. It's not necessarily bad to tell your kids to work hard to avoid being RESTRICTED to working these jobs"
self,fo0snsx,t3_g4yxkd,1587419024.0,"lol this is horrible recommendation... people really should educate themselves just a bit before spewing from the hip. everyone in America has the right to be treated. Literally even people in prison for murder maintain their right to receive necessary medical treatment. Yes, it is incredibly irresponsible for someone to violate these orders. But how do we even police this? What if someone is on a hike and momentarily forgets the 6 feet rule? Also, should we really let someone die from a disease just because they were irresponsible for one day? 

  
I really understand the frustration directed towards these individuals, especially considering how contagious this disease is. But this is a horrible recommendation... not only does it violate basic rights, it would be a net negative for society. Since these individuals would be waiving the right to receive treatment, they wouldn't be isolated in the hospital, receiving care. Considering the fact that they already violated stay-at-home orders, this increases the probability of them spreading the disease even further"
