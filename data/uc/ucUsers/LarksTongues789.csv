“stay-at-home” orders on the spread of infectious disease. NPIs are associated with
slower growth of Covid-19 cases. NPIs “spillover” into other jurisdictions. NPIs are not
associated with significantly worse economic outcomes measured by job losses. Job
losses have been no higher in US states that implemented “stay-at-home” during the
Covid-19 pandemic than in states that did not have “stay-at-home”. All of these results
demonstrate that the Covid-19 pandemic is a common economic and public health
shock. The tradeoff between the economy and public health today depends strongly on
what is happening elsewhere. This underscores the importance of coordinated economic
and public health responses."

When she said that the virus was low risk to Canadians (at least 2 months ago), that was very much true. And as I've repeatedly mentioned using scientific evidence, [travel restrictions are not as effective as one might think, and there's better ways to handle a pandemic.](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6489/395). See [this source as well](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/488167-travel-bans-cant-stop-this-pandemic) (I keep linking sources about why travel bans aren't that effective, and you just keep ignoring them). And she did advise people to [self-isolate after travel](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-coronavirus-outbreak-prompts-canadian-officials-to-weigh-asking-all/) . The worst thing she did was dismiss the idea of using masks, which is admittedly a questionable mistake of hers.

> And its a problem because it's wrong, and because it's not just similar to what the WHO advised, it is what the WHO advised, for the benefit of China and no one else.

As I've outlined above, much of what she's said and done is evidence-backed by non-WHO sources, and she could very well have arrived at her conclusions without consulting the WHO. So it honestly doesn't matter if it's coincidentally the same thing as what the WHO advised.  

> It's an insult, not an assumption because of her race. 

Unfortunately, anti-asian racism isn't taken nearly as seriously as other kinds of racism. It's disappointing, but that's the reality.

Dr Tam once [calmly, intelligently posted about Anti-Asian racism on her Twitter account](https://twitter.com/CPHO_Canada/status/1222704579172864002) (which is appropriate, as epidemiology is a bit more complicated than ""avoid asian people"" even when a virus originates from China), and the comments section was full of emotionally-driven, whiny, hate-filled snowflakes who have a problem with people condemning racism. So there's reason to think that race comes into play here. 

Anyway, Canada is doing well compared to other countries. So I really don't get all the melodramatic whining from everyone about [how Dr Tam is pure evil and has ""destroyed Canada""](https://twitter.com/TRCan66839023/status/1244434684148436995). And it's noteworthy that out of all these hateful people, I haven't seen many doctors or medical experts or scientifically literate people.

Mr Sloan may have been confused, because he asks Dr Tam ""Do you work for Canada or for China?"" She obviously works for Canada, as she's employed by a Canadian entity in Canada. It's reasonable to assume that Mr Sloan just took a glance at Dr Tam and assumed (incorrectly) that she works for China.

I don't think you know how the government works. Dr Tam could make the strongest, most reasonable recommendations she can to the gov based on the latest science, but ultimately there are policies and decisions that she has no say in making. That's how every single gov employee works (including the military). If everyone's a lacky/careerist, then nobody is a lacky/careerist.

Why do you attack Dr Tam's plans anyway? Not her press conference performance, but rather her management of this entire pandemic. What recommendations do you have for her? Do you think Canada is doing badly?

EDIT: I've been looking online, and it appears that a lot of the criticism has to do with the fact that Dr Tam is not omnipotent and didn't have the benefit of hindsight way back in January/February.
