cscareerquestions,fpmtfhp,t3_gebgsv,1588741251.0,"I see this question a lot on this sub. The short answer is: while you don't have to be a math whiz to get a CS degree, it's important to have a strong understanding of math.

Especially if you're planning to go into any math-heavy fields like AI, which are all largely based on statistics/math and a little bit of CS.

/u/Alyssa10001 is right though, it's largely based on your university. My two years at a UC have been very math heavy, even in CS courses."

UCSC,fpb617e,t1_fp7hnss,1588462854.0,"No problem! Learning Python is extremely easy and since you have experience with Java/C from 101, you'll have no problem with it :)"
UCSC,fpb5uu7,t1_fpavbyd,1588462748.0,"Yeah, that's a better way to put it. Reply All tells great stories and honestly brought a new, refreshing source for investigative journalism"
UCSC,fpaktqe,t3_gcarl5,1588450233.0,Reply All by Gimlet Media is one of my all time favorites. Dunno how to explain the premise... I would say it's like a podcast about the internet. Strongly recommend!
UCSC,fp4cy94,t1_fp3k7ip,1588296399.0,"Well, I took AM10 last quarter with Tenavi (amazing prof) and he had us do a lot of data cleaning/ML related stuff in his MATLAB assignments, so the coding involved in CSE 144 isn't really new stuff.

Overall, the coding isn't difficult but the kind of coding you do might be new (a lot of data visualization as opposed to writing algorithms). They do take pretty long though, as there's a lot of debugging and learning involved. However, the coding assignments have been implemented this quarter I believe to replace the big group project (due to the class being moved to remote).

Honestly you should be okay with just experience from those classes so long as you put in the egfort but I think it's recommended to either take AM10 or CSE107/AM131 prior to CSE 144"
UCSC,fp311ut,t3_gaxthp,1588271266.0,"Currently taking 144 w/ Narges. Really great class - both Narges and the TAs really care about the subject and the students, and really put in effort to clarify any confusing topics. This class has probably been one of my favorites so far at UCSC.

As for prior experience, I came in with virtually 0 ML experience (I actually never wanted to get into ML a while back), but in the previous quarter to taking this class, I took both AM10 and CSE107, which both serve as foundations for a lot of the math in this course. So, you don't necessarily need any ML knowledge so long as you have a decent foundation or experience in linear algebra and statistics/probability. Oh, and make sure you're a little bit familiar with Python; the class is project/application based so you'll be doing more coding than hand calculations.

That being said, it's a really fun course and Narges is a really good professor. Don't be intimidated by the labels 'machine learning' and 'artificial intelligence' :)

EDIT: As for differences, you can refer to them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/f00tib/cse_140_142_or_144/)"
UCSC,fp1hvjc,t3_gane5r,1588236068.0,"Congrats on finding a new skill to learn that you genuinely enjoy! It's always great to see people pick up programming and finding it fun :)

When I started in high school, I used a lot of CodingBat and some small projects to help me learn the basics of Java, and there are plenty of free courses on YouTube for that stuff."
UCSC,fotf8xu,t3_g9g8zb,1588052214.0,"Graffix used to sell them but ""not anymore"" (except for the tobacco flavors)"
csMajors,fooxadf,t3_g8lnvy,1587948418.0,"Yeah, honestly just from reading your post I have to agree with everyone else. CS is VERY math heavy, which a lot of people don't realize. 

Although I wouldn't recommend getting a Masters, have you considered/looked at bootcamps? If you just want to pursue a career in tech/programming, you can either go the bootcamp route or go into an adjacent field like IT/CIS."
UCSC,fnulznk,t1_fnik2qd,1587265298.0,107 is heavily proof/theory-based so you learn a lot about the intuition behind things but not too much applicable stuff (didnt really touch on any stats stuff other than probability/variance/expected values)
UCSC,fnhl7um,t3_g1abcb,1586964450.0,"Keep doing stuff in python, if ur interested in AI maybe start getting familiar with python libraries like pandas, tensorflow/keras, pytorchch, and numpy (used in ML stuff)"
UCSC,fnhl30u,t1_fng20gg,1586964381.0,"^ can confirm, altho imo 131 more useful for classes like the ML/AI series"
cscareerquestions,fncbibx,t3_g0x9xs,1586832818.0,"I'm in the same place you are!

I just started applying to internships, and I noticed on my first couple of OAs that I really struggled to break down what the problem was asking for and how to start solving it.

One thing that really helped me was what my professor said in one of my Algo Design/Analysis course:
> ""Try to understand the problem, and break it down into smaller problems

One thing I'd suggest is start doing LeetCode problems and start by drawing out the problem, solving for the base cases by hand, and jot down any patterns I see as I do more base cases. There's a lot of stuff online that kinda show you how to intuitively approach problems. I feel like I've improved on my OA performance a lot since I started doing this."
UCSC,fmtscvh,t3_fwuze4,1586378166.0,"CS major here.

Your cons about UCSC being ""inferior"" to other UC's is a perfectly normal mindset to have entering college, but that mentality is going to disappear after a couple months here.

I also came from a competitive high school where most of my peers ended up at Berkeley or Irvine, and even though I was sad I didn't get into either, I found myself never thinking about ""this UC > this other UC"" ever again, and I'm nearing the end of my second year.

Choose what you will, but I know many people at UCSC who go on to receive internship offers from FANG companies, and other high profile ones. College returns what you put into it, except money lol."
