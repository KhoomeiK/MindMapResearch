I recognize that I've always had a weirdly open door policy with bathroom time, but from what I've heard from other moms,  that's just expected by most toddlers anyway. My mom had a similar open door policy and I was freaked out seeing blood on the tp (this is after my mom had a placental abruption with the birth of my younger sister and I was witness to it) so I may have been more sensitive to the idea with my own kid."

I think you know that he needs to see a dr, and honestly, you can't make him do it. But if he won't and you can leave, I would recommend doing so.

I have stated multiple times that I don't understand why someone would risk the heat treatment damage to the hair caused by heated curling when falsies are so good and easily obtained at this point. Your point,  as best as I can ascertain through your aggressive comments, is that the human body is also warm? But you aren't giving me any data concerning how heat impacts either head hair or lash hair. In fact you responded to me clarification with nothing more than,  ""are you being willingly obtuse."" So no, it's not willingly. If you want to clarify at any point it would obviously inform me. Do you have anything to support that heat treating lash curlers is damage free? Do you have a curve to compare it to the perceived realness of modern fake lashes?

While it has a follicular base that protects it at the point of connection,  clearly regular heat treatments or instances of excessive heat have proven to damage the shaft of head hair. Then there's the fact that a fire-heated rubber or metal product will be more than 98 degrees, or at the very least,  it popwill be difficult to control for this. I am lucky to have eyelashes that curl on their own, so maybe I'm not as versed in this trend,  as I don't curl my lashes to begin with.
