politics,fphfm8s,t1_fph9eyc,1588620423.0,"I'd respectfully say that i think his success had less to do with a classic example of charisma (elequence of speech and oratory skills, for example), and more to do with his ability to tap into that primal, unfiltered anger White people felt deep inside as they watched a member of a population they viewed as inferior ascend to the presidency. When Obama took the White House it invalidated their reality, which stated they were superior and in charge. All Trump had to do was tell them what he knew they wanted to hear, tell them it was okay to be angry, that the anger was warranted, and he was in. He could say it in crass, uncharismatic, and offensive ways, but if he just validated the ""pain"" they were in, he was their guy. His success is a direct result of the worst parts of American culture being given validation."
politics,fph70bi,t1_fpgt39e,1588616080.0,"And Obama won a Nobel Prize and has an advanced degree. Trump is under the impression that he is owed everything in life without having to work for it because that was how he was raised. He never had to really work, but he still thrived because others did on his behalf. The fact that a Black man has something he doesn't INFURIATES him and attacks his fragile ego in ways I imagine would be difficult to put into words."

PoliticalHumor,foqx9z8,t3_g8zavn,1588002443.0,"Yea, Imma call BS on that. If it were true though, I've occasionally noticed him coming to the briefings a little more orange than the day before. Perhaps, instead of laying on another coat of paint, he could eat lunch then?"
PoliticalHumor,foku90k,t1_fok4k0q,1587849054.0,They are for sure both idiots and embarrassments. And that definitely sounds like something Steve King would say. But I'd assume there would be much more racist and white nationalist sentiment included if it came from Steve.
PoliticalHumor,fojqjen,t3_g7jnr7,1587827247.0,"""There's no way, I don't think, any of us can excuse what the president did yesterday. I mean, you have the world watching.""  - Rep. Peter King after Obama wore a TAN SUIT.  

Let's be realistic here, folks. They would have begun articles of impeachment before any Americans died. They would have begun the process when the virus first popped up in China and somehow blamed it on her."

insanepeoplefacebook,fn4n1ru,t1_fn4lloe,1586644754.0,"Well that's just a nasty question from a nasty reporter. I'd say you're a horrible reporter is what I'd say. I've answered that question 15 times. Sad. 

I think it's probably because Fox ""news"" or Nazi Radio, sorry, One America ""News"" Network, hasn't told them how the name was created or what it means, and they haven't bothered to look it up because Trump supporters collectively stopped using their minds 3 years ago."
insanepeoplefacebook,fn4m25c,t3_fzbwey,1586644179.0,This sounds like something Michael Scott would say. Go ahead - try thinking it in Michael Scott's voice and see if it doesn't totally work.
santarosa,fn4ln92,t1_fn3ws1l,1586643928.0,Yes. Hopefully at the VA once I'm done with school.

Coronavirus,fmm84fs,t1_fmlie8d,1586200549.0,"My dad, a dentist, was getting into an argument with his sister about something medical related at a family get together several years ago. He finally said ""I'm not going to to argue with you anymore about this. You're not qualified and you don't know the difference between opinions and facts"". She replied, ""you're not smarter than me. I have a degree too!"" 

He just laughed and walked away because she has no degree. She has a certificate...in real estate. 

The most ignorant and unqualified are often the loudest and most aggressive."
santarosa,fmlms6p,t1_fmjxn6t,1586189439.0,"You're very correct. Maintaining a good diet is important for improving mental health as well. Apologies for not mentioning that in my post. 

Thank you for pointing that out!"
santarosa,fmi67ip,t3_fv9u6t,1586103252.0,"Hi. I'm a current grad student at UC Berkeley going to school to become a psychotherapist, and what I'm seeing from how this post is written is a thought pattern we call ""catastrophising"". It's where the mind goes to the worst possible place, and assumes the worst is going to happen or is highly likely. It is often seen in those with depression and anxiety, which it sounds like you're coping with as well. Both are completely normal when people are overly sedentary (i.e. quarantined) and feel like they have no control over key aspects of their life. 

I could say ""don't worry, it will all return to normal and your child will absolutely be able to go to school"", but I believe that would help you about as much as a flat tire. I could also say ""don't be so pessimistic"", but that would probably be counterproductive because it implies that you're just ""being negative"". You're not just being negative. You're dealing with a situation that nobody taught you how to handle. It's normal to feel sad and anxious in a situation like that.

What I'd suggest is mentally reframing this situation. For example, life (in some regards) has effectively been placed on pause. This is an excellent time to take up a hobby you've always wanted to try or learn but didn't have time for. Painting, crocheting, drawing. Learn how to speak another language, or how to write computer code. Got an old guitar or know someone that does? Learn to play it. You could read that book you've always wanted to read that's been sitting on your shelf for the last few years. I, myself, have taken up running again, have done all my spring cleaning, and have decided this is an ideal time to modify some of my own behavior that I didn't have time to do while a full-time student/intern. 

As important as it is to do keep yourself busy with healthy activities, it is also equally important to not fall into maladaptive coping strategies. I recently read that alcohol sales have gone up 55%. Alcohol, significant amounts of TV, sleeping all day, etc. While they make you feel better right then, in the long-term they will hurt more than help. Try setting an alarm, waking up every day at the same time, making a schedule, sticking with said schedule, and limiting alcohol to only on the weekends. Oh, and I'd highly suggest we all limit our news intake. All that doom and gloom is a surefire way to feel depressed. 

I really hope this helps. If you have any questions, let me know. I'm kind of bad about checking this, but I'll try."
