berkeley,fpfdkso,t1_fpfc6j0,1588568150.0,just put berkeley. or cal. it's sexier
ApplyingToCollege,fpfczib,t3_gd4cdl,1588567680.0,"Hey don't worry. I was in the exact same boat as you. I fucked around freshman and sophomore year, joined random clubs that I didn't care about, and didn't really know the direction I wanted to go in yet at all. After that though, I put 100% of my effort into this EC stuff my junior year and the summer after junior year. I ended up at my top choice."
ApplyingToCollege,fpfchmb,t3_gd4t45,1588567292.0,"Hi! I know the period from junior to senior year is extremely stressful. I know it, I went through it just a few months ago, and at the time, I didn't feel like I was at all ready for college applications either. I had no idea where to start. It felt like everyone was already ahead of me and had figured everything out, written essays, when I hadn't even started. Let me just give you a reminder to breathe and to not be so harsh on yourself. You still have over half a year to get everything ready, and I have no doubt that everything will fall into place for you by then :)

Around this time spring of my junior year, I was in around the same boat as you where I wasn't confident in myself at all. I didn't think I was going to get into a UC at all and was preparing myself for the worst at a community college! Of course, it all ended up working out and I learned that I didn't need to be so worried/harsh on myself. It may seem like everyone else has it together at this point except you but that's not true. You have so so so much time to grow as a person, develop yourself and your skills, gain confidence, and write your essays. The essays that you're writing right now for class, I can almost say for certain, will not be what you end up submitting. You might go through tens of drafts, or end up scrapping the whole thing just to write a brand new one. The point is, it's ok to feel like you might not have everything ready yet. College applications are a very very long process, but the thing with this whole quarantine is that that means you have much more time! Take it all step by step. Around this time last year, I was only ready to fill out the basic information about myself in the commonapp. It was only after my summer that I felt confident enough in myself, my experiences, and my abilities, to write my essays. I started them around September/October, grinded every day, and it all paid off as I got into my dream school--something I never even thought was possible to achieve. I didn't even think of it as a reach school but more of an unreachable ,impossible school.

For now, I'd recommend just loosely brainstorming everything about yourself and writing it all down! At the end, you'll kind of see what direction you're kind of heading towards. I know it's really tough to figure out what to write when there's so many components that make you *you*. But it will all come together! P.S. don't be discouraged by the whole stats thing. Holistic admissions is such an overused word but it really is true. Portraying yourself authentically is worth so much more than just your hard gpa and SAT score."

berkeley,fp6s82m,t1_fp6pdyy,1588357699.0,Yes! Ok that makes a lot more sense. I was wondering why it showed only like 2 bio classes that qualified. Thank you so much for the help!!
berkeley,fp4d0kg,t3_g1wa0w,1588296438.0,Hi! I was looking at the course selection and was thinking about taking Geog N50 and Buddstd 50. Under both of these it says that the courseload would be up to 20+ hours of outside work per week. That sounds super intimidating! Any thoughts on whether this would be too difficult?
berkeley,fp49y9h,t1_fp44y88,1588294638.0,"thank you so much for all your advice! 

I just checked my cc and basically almost all the classes, at least the ones with transferable credits, are already full. rip. berkeley classes it is"
berkeley,fp3zej0,t1_fp3xnxp,1588288691.0,"ah, I see :( rip 

scared that that might hurt me in the future"
berkeley,fp3wgw5,t1_fp3lhk6,1588287091.0,this is very cool! I might just do that. do the grades carry over as well? as in the A u get in a CC will be factored into your GPA
ApplyingToCollege,fnv1ffp,t1_fnv1ej5,1587277147.0,Oh really? It was pinned for a while :(

berkeley,fnqvin3,t1_fnqsbr6,1587173147.0,"Thank you for your insight! I was looking at the poliecon major and it seems very interesting, like a good balance. Why do you say polisci+Econ is better though? I’m just worried about being overworked"
berkeley,fnqns4e,t1_fnqjbew,1587168343.0,How do you like the poliecon major so far?
berkeley,fnqh491,t1_fnqg54x,1587164490.0,Oh shoot. I hadn’t thought about that. I didn’t realize that was a major here
berkeley,fnf5gu2,t1_fneqjzo,1586901755.0,omfg drunk barbie movie weekends- that sounds amazing and exactly like my scene
berkeley,fn50lhf,t1_fn503ks,1586653121.0,Can mods put it back? :(
berkeley,fn4egnn,t1_fn490lh,1586639710.0,"It’s nice and fine, the blue and gold is pretty. I think adding just any indication that this is a college sub would be nice though. Even r/Ucla has a go bruins in the description"
berkeley,fn3xna5,t1_fn3ud8k,1586629937.0,Bruh that is so lame
berkeley,fn3r7ra,t1_fn3qlpq,1586626344.0,Also this is adorable!
berkeley,fn3r526,t1_fn3qlpq,1586626301.0,Is there a way to see this on the new reddit? I’m on mobile most of the time
berkeley,fn3r2si,t1_fn3q0wz,1586626266.0,"On yeah I don’t see that. I’m on the mobile app and there’s no banner, no logo. Just a plain default spaceship and a blue background"
berkeley,fn3ogoe,t1_fn3msa4,1586624796.0,"No, there’s no need for anything I guess. But I think it would be nice to at least put _something_ other than what’s default. I was also a little bit confused when o first found the sub bc I didn’t know if it was for the city or something. A little description couldn’t hurt. Where’s the school spirit ?"

berkeley,fmo1t7b,t1_fmnpeyn,1586242294.0,Wdym by Cal opens up a lot of things that people don't know exist?
ApplyingToCollege,fmntyy4,t1_fmnsope,1586235222.0,well obviously it depends from person to person. I'm middle class and privates will barely give me any aid. so public is the best option for me
ApplyingToCollege,fmnsa92,t3_fwdt7f,1586233870.0,public school if you're middle class. private school if you're poor
ApplyingToCollege,fm6aj8w,t3_ftchdm,1585789805.0,Cal is renowned for data science. Like top in the country
