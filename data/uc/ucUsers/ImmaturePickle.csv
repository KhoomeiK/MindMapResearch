UCSantaBarbara,fp1b8np,t1_fp1ap98,1588229858.0,It makes me feel like I need to have my boyfriend with me just to feel safe :( I feel you so much
UCSantaBarbara,fp1b76n,t1_fp1aayr,1588229821.0,No for me today it was a guy on a bike and then a couple days ago it was some guys in a sedan :/
UCSantaBarbara,fp13i43,t1_fp12zun,1588223394.0,So gross üò∑ I'm sorry it happened to you :(
UCSantaBarbara,fp0y17w,t1_fp0xuox,1588219517.0,"I'm looking to see if anyone else has experienced this too, and who knows? I don't think they are bad people who are catcalling, likely just bored. I'm trying to discourage this behavior by speaking out."
horror,foeto2t,t3_g6x3r1,1587714378.0,I thought the first one was so bad it was nearly unwatchable. Count me out.
horror,fo9t3r7,t3_g6io1s,1587630209.0,This is one of my favorites of all time! I can't recommend it enough üôè
Embroidery,fnyphee,t3_g4h39m,1587370797.0,"This is somewhat unrelated but I was gonna do one of my dog that looks exactly like Walter, so thank you for this haha. [Lizard](https://i.imgur.com/Aju2iie.jpg)"
HealthAnxiety,fnkgdo5,t3_g28xid,1587026037.0,"I just wanted to say I seriously relate to this fear, I'm constantly afraid of getting rabies. Is the raccoon acting okay, like a normal raccoon? Is it drinking water? It probably doesn't even have rabies, I'm sure you're fine regardless. :)"
HealthAnxiety,fnkg9n2,t3_g29t5v,1587025918.0,I think at this point it would be best for you to schedule an appointment and get an allergy test panel. Then you can be sure of what it is and that avoiding it is the right thing to do - I think the uncertainty is probably causing a lot of the anxiety.
AskReddit,fne1qsf,t3_g0y6j9,1586881521.0,Oblivion. I played that game for years.
horror,fn96zio,t3_g042us,1586761623.0,"I just finished RE4 and the scariest moment for me was when one of those regeneration guys snuck up behind me, I just about shit my pants. 
I'm a huge horror game addict so most games don't scare me too badly anymore, but the remake of RE2 was actually really good. The slickers are the scariest, along with Titan's footsteps in the hallway stalking you. 
Also a moment I always remember was in the first Bioshock when you are just starting, you walk into a bathroom to loot it and a splicer jumps out of the stall. That always scared the fuck out of me as a kid."
Embroidery,fn96iyn,t1_fn8lgj0,1586761159.0,I'm watching that during quarantine right now! I love your embroidery!!
interestingasfuck,fn2cz9p,t1_fn28rxf,1586584774.0,My first pets were two fancy mice being sold as feeders. They lived long happy lives (for mice). Thanks for doing that.
horror,fn2chj3,t1_fmonxln,1586584322.0,"Hey, I'd love to but I don't have an Instagram! Would email work?"

ChoosingBeggars,fn2c2x5,t1_fn27b4u,1586583959.0,Go live in Denmark and tell me how awful socialism is.
ChoosingBeggars,fn2by6b,t1_fn290d0,1586583841.0,"It's exploitation because people *need* the job. Especially now, of all times, you should understand that people are not free to choose their job and how much they get paid. Oftentimes they have to take what they can get. Your friend (if she exists) is a single anecdote. If it was so fucking easy to get rich by working hard and pursuing promotions, don't you think that it wouldn't be 1% of the people with 90% of the wealth? You think people *choose* to be poor? You're out of your damn mind, or willfully ignorant."
horror,fmz4cdq,t3_fy9j6m,1586505899.0,Aliens
horror,fmz49oy,t3_fy3bg6,1586505817.0,"God bless RE 7 üôè here's to hoping they make 8 soon. Have you played RE 4? It's not like 7, but I think it's great fun and scary."
crochet,fmz3pys,t3_fy3jjj,1586505218.0,I love this. Is there a pattern??
horror,fmrrmck,t3_fwyr8q,1586332945.0,The Descent is what you're looking for my guy üëç
horror,fmrrfxg,t3_fwy7xj,1586332760.0,"Not a movie, but I just love Jill Valentine from Resident Evil 3. She's just so badass. Same with Lara Croft, although I'd say calling tomb raider a horror is probably debatable."
UCSantaBarbara,fmrjsy9,t3_fwx658,1586325376.0,This is so frustrating because everyone knew having people return to get their stuff would spread covid. I sent an email and even called about it and they told me to pound sand.
BrokeHobbies,fmpd0r2,t3_fuu5ia,1586278657.0,I love this
horror,fmo5m5f,t3_fw4guk,1586246240.0,"I'd be totally down for something like this, sounds like right up my alley. I'm very experienced with mental illness in particular if you wanted someone for that specifically. Hit me up if you're interested!"
horror,fmo5ccd,t3_fw73h8,1586245951.0,"The Crazies. Good infection type movie for during this pandemic, one of my favorites ever."
