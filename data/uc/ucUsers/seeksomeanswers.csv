russian,fom78ws,t1_fom3izx,1587880360.0,"You look like a diligent person who really knows what he wants. Congrats on you being able to learn to read and understand Russian. üï∫
grammar for a foreigner is hard, it sounds weird but hey, have you tried using some books for kids?  There is a ton of educational books/ practice books for 5 year olds or less. At least this is how we all began to learn Russian grammar.
You can also try to use resources e.g. YouTube. There is a channel called ‚Äú—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —Å –Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–º¬ª. A woman speaks in Russian +has  English subtitles. She teaches foreign students how to be grammatically correct in speaking. Learning will take time, it won‚Äôt be easy, but if you are committed you‚Äôll find those videos very helpful and rewarding. 
Aside from YouTube and educational books, really  just spend more time with friends and listen to their speaking while engaging in conversation. Russians love to help, so take advantage of that and ask many questions on pronunciation. 
Practice, Practice and practice speaking. You will learn through making mistakes. 
Also, a tip: get a thick journal or something you can utilize for new words. 
When I was learning English (I am a native speaker in Russian) I didn‚Äôt have many resources, but I had English books with me. 
So I would write out unfamiliar words and then quiz myself until I would learn to pronounce them to sound grammatically correct. And obviously the big thing with Russian pronunciation: every letter in the word should be pronounced.  the rhythm and the flow of certain letters combined into a single word can be hard to pronounce, especially when speaking fast. 

Hope that at least some parts of this long message will be useful to you in your pursuit of Russian language. :)"

russian,fofruni,t1_fofp7gc,1587741711.0,"Literal translation. 

Mom: ‚Äúopens a window‚Äù
Mom: ‚ÄúSon, is it not cold?‚Äù 
Me: do it :)

The word –¥—É—Ç—å-–¥—É–µ—Ç(sounds like do it) is ‚Äúto blow‚Äù. In this context, this verb is used to describe movement of the air, particularly the wind. 
mom opens a window to usually ¬´–ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—Ç—å –∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç—É¬ª and asks the son, if he feels the wind blowing thereby implying  whether he is getting cold as a result of an opened window in the room. 
‚Äú–î—É–µ—Ç‚Äù sounds similar to ‚Äúdo it‚Äù. the guy replied with ¬´–¥—É–µ—Ç¬ª, ultimately implying: –¥—É–µ—Ç, that it is indeed getting cooler in the room.

lonely,foemg33,t3_g701kk,1587707786.0,"Come to Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ came once so that you may have life and have it abundantly. Once you turn to Him and confess that He is the Son of God who came on the earth 2000 something years ago as a Son of Man. He lived on the earth for 33.5 years and died on a cross for everyone‚Äôs sins in this universe. He was convicted and died as a criminal, even thou He wasn‚Äôt One. This sacrifice was done so that YOU, yes, YOU may have LIFE! 
He wants you to live. It is Satan who wants you dead. But God is so merciful He sent His Son. 
But if you believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is God who was manifested and became a Man , who died for you sins and you confess with your mouth that you will be saved. The Bible says: you will have eternal life.
Come to Him. For God desires all men to be saved. 
Be saved from this condition of yours, be saved in  and by Him. He wants to take care of you. 
Have faith and confess. The time is short anyway. Don‚Äôt lose this life so Satan can win another soul. 

Romans 10:9-10 
That you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him form the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation. 

i will pray for you. May you find peace and rest in Christ from this very complex situation."

russian,fobc5r6,t1_fobbsea,1587658328.0,I actually don‚Äôt know how to answer your question  because I have no knowledge about Colombia in general. Sorry. Not credible. And I do not speak Spanish. :(
dating,fobbhtl,t1_fob8a43,1587658126.0,"I know during this covid 19 it is harder to socialize, so if you are looking for a relationship that will be fleeting but satisfying for some time, then I think you can find someone from a dating app. But you  said it yourself, you know what you want and you won‚Äôt settle for less, this is the right mindset. 
Regarding the experience and inexperience. Although we as humans have a strong culture of ideas about dating, life, marriage, how we should act in our societies, etc. it doesn‚Äôt mean that to have a stable and strong relationship you have to have experience prior. I know a lot of young people who dated one person and after dating them, they got married and live a content life of a normal couple. Besides, if a person who is experienced in relationships and says that he wouldn‚Äôt date someone inexperienced that sounds arrogant and ignorant. 
Okay, I am 20 and maybe I have traditional views, but I would definitely say for myself, I want my person to be just as inexperienced as I am in relationships. I have never dated before, and I save myself for marriage, for the only one there is for me. I will follow this idea that two inexperienced people (those who never dated before) go into a relationship start from a ground 0 to learn to grow in a relationship together. I intentionally want this experience to be like this because I will know it will be rewarding. There are some reasons for this: 1) you will not compare your relationships to other ones you had with somebody else
2) learn to really work on your relationship not just because ‚Äú I am no longer alone and it‚Äôs all cool‚Äù but because it is better to be together than alone learning together how to grow up in a relationship. It is a work of a lifetime after all. 

Sorry I guess I talked a lot about myself. But for you, I think you should set your priorities straight and know exactly what you want from a relationship you will get into."
dating,fob7n62,t3_g6ovao,1587656966.0,"stop right now and think about it. 
Is it worth to be desperate? 
That is all I am going to say. 
Trust in the time, and place. Keep focusing on your life apart from this. Once the time is right, and when you are ready to fully commit to a relationship for a lifetime, you will find the right person. Try not to rush things, because in today‚Äôs age everyone is rushing and at the end they don‚Äôt get satisfied with their life. Learn to appreciate time and don‚Äôt stress about it.
And also I don‚Äôt think that apps is a good idea for a partner for a lifetime... but that is my personal opinion."

I am a girl and by reading your comment, you seem like a very insightful and sensible person who learned the big and hard lessons in life.

Find a hobby that really makes your life easier but also allows you to think and reflect. For me it is reading. 
Yes, relationship is a big commitment (I have never been in one) but I do take the accountability that it is a work for life. I actually think once you get into a relationship, you might recall those days and nights where it was only you and your thoughts :)) 
Anyway, enjoy your time now, when the right time comes, you will meet the one and build a strong relationship together.

however, sometimes it might happen that a student might drop a class his last semester (spring if you are transferring for the fall) prior to transferring, hence not fulfilling the 60 units requirement. so the option to get those units would be to take the classes in the SUMMER. yes, the universities don‚Äôt tell you that, (I don‚Äôt know what is the reason behind it) but you can take the classes in the summer before transferring in the fall. so the person who told you this info is correct."

Take your time, apply for fafsa, receive an AA in fashion or in a field that makes you excited. 
And if you end up not wanting to transfer to a university (or for any other reason why you can‚Äôt go to uni); I know that if you talk to counselors at cc, you can actually graduate with a bachelors at cc. Maybe ppl don‚Äôt know it because it is not as advertised.

while I am impressed that you went to study Russian in US, (I am a native speaker in Russian transferring from a cc in Cali to a uni this fall), 
I am going to be honest, in US there is not much opportunity unless you work in fbi or something. (but if you get in you get paid a lot, I know one person he is an American who learned Russian and worked for translating at the fbi level). 
Nevertheless, I could tell you that if the covid-19 wasn‚Äôt an obstacle, another seemingly scratchy option would be to actually go to Moscow, and find a job teaching English to students in special schools (be like a tutor in English). Even though ppl are scared to go to Russia now, and for good reasons, it could give you very good salary and an interesting experience. You could even teach extracurricular courses (in Moscow you would get more money as a native speaker for sure; ppl would prefer you to Russians who speak with a broken English lol). 
But with the current situation, it‚Äôs not an option for you and honestly, I can‚Äôt see this degree as useful because it is not in the USA. 
Maybe consider going back to school for receiving a masters in something that inspires you but that will also give you a job with a good salary.
