UCDavis,fp59w60,t3_gbcjtz,1588321456.0,High chance it will be online but nothing confirmed yet. Hopefully they will confirm by the end of spring quarter.

UCDavis,fox2fxb,t1_fowz5m6,1588132481.0,You won’t be kicked out. You will have summer to make it up and graduate
UCDavis,fotb8t0,t1_fotas4d,1588049087.0,Doesn’t matter if the schedule fits or no but the max units is more than 8 so how about you do a little research first and then come back here to prove me wrong.
UCDavis,forjond,t3_g91spw,1588013368.0,It’s 15 I believe since it says on schedule builder that you can’t exceed 15 units.
UCDavis,forjl8w,t1_foqwr0g,1588013323.0,If you don’t know the answer just don’t reply with some BS.
UCDavis,fo59xl3,t1_fo59s5v,1587520716.0,They changed it for man Econ that we can take major classes as P/NP but I was just wondering if we allowed to take 12 units as P/NP this quarter

UCDavis,fnk5xjh,t1_fnj2hv9,1587015937.0,"How about just saying “interesting”, you tell him if you are interested or no."
UCDavis,fmtkwro,t3_fx0eqg,1586374486.0,This is actually so true. Professors should be more lenient atleast this quarter.
UCDavis,fmn225y,t3_fw7eb5,1586216573.0,Dumb enough to do it? Definitely go for it.
UCDavis,fmdu3t0,t1_fmdtc95,1585977994.0,Thanks!! Book is required for homework 1 that is due on Monday and I know a lot of people don’t get their books until next week and professor is not helping at all so just wanted to help.
