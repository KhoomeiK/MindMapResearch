Please always remember to put your mental health first. As much as it may suck to have to push back to winter, this is just temporary. Would you rather finish by spring quarter while struggling and being overwhelmed or give yourself some room to breath? We all need to assess everything on an individual basis and I am happy you chose to do what was best for you. Hopefully with this situation, they will sympathize a bit. Stay safe and healthy. xo"

If it is easier for you, try write all assignments as you are assign them and be happy over the little successes. Hopefully this will pass soon"
