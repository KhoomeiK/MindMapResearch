UCSC,fpn3gap,t3_geewrn,1588748984.0,You don't need to repay the aid since you are still considered full time. You should contact advising about other consequences regarding taking this W since everyones academic situation is different.
csMajors,fpb97lp,t3_gcgetw,1588464815.0,"I believe you are asking the wrong question? You should be assessing if you WANT it badly enough to put in the time and work no matter. It can take me twice as long to understand a concept but i'm enjoying the process and have the discipline to put in the work, it really doesn't matter. If you aren't prepared to feel challenged and even feel stupid at times, you may want to consider a major that 'seems' easy all the time."

UCSC,foc4e0x,t3_g6rcgr,1587666974.0,"From my experience, there is financial aid available for the summer but you usually still need to take out loans to cover your housing and food. There are usually no late fees to pay off your summer classes, so you have until the end of summer to pay. I am unsure about the prereqs situation, you should reach out to an academic adviser for that. But, I believe you will be able to enroll in those fall classes, I remember something about the portal saying it is a conditional enrollment in the course, if you fail the prereq in the summer, it drops you from the fall class. Hope this helps."

It has one of the biggest residential campuses, you should give it a try before living in a random apartment in the town. I've always heard it's easier to make friends and socialize on campus."
UCSC,fnuasg8,t3_g3v8cc,1587258093.0,"All it says is it 'might' be online. We all already knew fall quarter 'might' be online.

UCSC,fn2akxq,t1_fn1qffy,1586582629.0,What if the grade I am missing is for a major requirement? Will it still count towards my major?
UCSC,fmv0hn7,t1_fmuw43d,1586403084.0,"CSE 12 has been offered every year during the summer, but this summer it's not listed. Do you know if maybe they are just looking for an instructor or if it just won't be offered?"
