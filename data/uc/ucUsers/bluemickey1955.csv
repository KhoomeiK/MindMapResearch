Whatever feeling of self-doubt and hatred you're going through will pass, I promise you. Trust me, I've been there and I know it isn't easy. Sometimes pent up tension just builds up and you feel as if the world is weighing down on you, thus enabling  you in wanting a way out. But you will get through this. Just please listen.Take your time and realize that you have so much to live for. Do nice things for yourself and put this in the back of your mind to calm down those voices: you is smart, you is kind, you is important."
