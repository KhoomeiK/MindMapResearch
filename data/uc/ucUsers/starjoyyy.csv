buildapc,fpdz4e9,t1_fpdy9a6,1588537135.0,"When I first got it and had problems with cooling, my roommate and I adjusted it to constant 100% fan power to prevent rather than remedy heat. I also tested it right after posting this to confirm the issue being Vanguard. The fans were completely off, I uninstalled Vanguard and restarted my computer and the fans started up immediately despite still being barely above room temperature still. I'm thinking now that this is definitely not a heat issue despite the perfect timing. I'm hoping the deep clean will fix this..."

buildapc,fpdfrck,t1_fpdeyf0,1588526120.0,"Forgot to mention, when we first set up my computer, my roommate was super pushy about getting me to overclock my PC and I think he did? And in return we set the fans to constantly work at highest (probably a waste of energy I know) to prevent heat instead of just dealing with it after it gets hot. But the overclock doesn't seem to heat up my PC, and the entire shutdown of the fans are from the disabling of cpuz149 which a lot of people who are playing Valorant are experiencing."
trashy,fpd79mx,t1_fpd0ko0,1588521298.0,"Thank you for these perspectives. When I saw the picture my first thought was ""don't blur her face, she's just as bad and an enabler"". Now I'm considering all the scenarios- he could've been a clear abuser leading up to this and her friends didn't intervene. There are so many things I didn't consider and this was an eye opener."

blackdesertonline,fp3n6ay,t1_fp350xc,1588282264.0,"They're visual bugs and don't have any effect on the player other than lookin weird. You can walk right through them, and they disappear when looked at in certain angles usually. I also played around 2017-2018 and it would happen to me all the time with different things like fences or trees."
Advice,forq2zk,t3_g94bhx,1588016511.0,"That's the logic that supports keeping kids in Vietnam working in factories sunrise to sunset for literal pennies. We should be paying people what they deserve and let them make a reasonable living wage. Thinking like your father supports keeping the poor people poor for the sole fact that they were born poor.

You shouldn't be taking into account their origins at all when you make your decision. The connection is a problem and the language barrier is as well, and THOSE are the things you should be taking into account, not how high his rent is. Also I wouldn't know whether your dad is racist or not, but this situation is more of an example of classism and not racism. Classism is the idea that people in a different wealth range are entirely different from them and deserve to be where they are- thinking billionaires should stay billionaires and poor people should stay poor, or that they are lesser human beings."
UCSC,fo75561,t3_g5vp04,1587572422.0,"I'm fucking losing my shit at #5. 

Also I remember though one of my first impressions of UCSC was during orientation. There was a HUGE line of cars stalled on the road. At the front was a flock of turkeys slowly making their way through, aggressively gobbling at each other and the cars. I'll never forget it. The faces on the drivers were priceless, parents and incoming frosh late for orientation, dying inside as they watched the turkeys live their best life in the middle of the road."

Advice,fnugrqj,t3_g3v7nd,1587261724.0,"I was actually shocked when I found out it wasn't completely normal to be comfortable naked with each other!! I'm 21 and my sister is 25, and we freely use the bathroom with the door open and are naked around each other and my mom. It's always just been my single mom and my sister and me, so there's usually no discomfort, with some exceptions. It's great that your daughter is okay with it, it's a huge positive sign that she's comfortable with you in that ""vulnerable"" state. 

Especially when she's going through puberty and learning her way around her body and sexuality, it's an invaluable resource to have a mother that she trusts with her body. She'll be able to open up to you if an embarrassing ""private"" health concern arises which is so important!"
MakeMeSuffer,fnahgie,t1_fnad8rx,1586797576.0,"I'm caught up with the manga which is much further ahead. From what I take away from it, Beastars is a commentary on predator/prey dynamics (applied to relationships, job position status, etc), fetishization/exoticisim, and ""unlilely couples"". By unlikely couples, mostly how certain couples are EXTREMELY shamed whereas others are revered as holy and traditional and ""right"".

In their world, traditional power dynamics work based on their actual biology and species. The series is about certain characters that will go through insane lengths to overcome and step out of the society mold for their species."

Twitch,fmy4r7g,t3_fxug6k,1586478097.0,"I think a good alternative if you're wanting to support her passion is to just invite good friends to actively watch her with you! Even for 5-10 minutes, that means the WORLD to a streamer starting off. Engage her, talk about her game and your day, etc. 

As for donating, what you should do is donate to her without hiding it, however DO IT WHEN PEOPLE ARE WATCHING AND ENGAGING! Let's say there are a few people chatting at the moment, even if they're your friends or her friends, drop 5$. That will get the viewers' attentions and they will 100% talk about it. When she has a donation, it makes her look and feel like a more established streamer. Every streamer starts with donations from family/friends and that's normal! ***But dropping any amount of money will mean SO MUCH MORE when viewers talk about it!*** It makes it more likely that those viewers will come back since it makes her look established and her reaction is good content.

Then along the way, I think you should gift random subs to whoever is currently watching. Just a few would be good, even if Twitch halves what you give her. When you gift subs anonymously, they stay 100% anonymous to her and the viewers, and it will really help her start off. I think that after this point is the best time to donate larger sums if you'd like. You can keep them ""anonymous"" on stream, and even if she'll know, she'll at least appreciate how it made her stream look really well off!! Even if you're looking to support her through money... Trust me, as a gamer, helping her start off her stream will mean WAY more than just money.

Good luck, and you're an amazing brother for looking into this for her. <3"

fountainpens,fmxv4r7,t3_fxt000,1586472474.0,"Hello! Complete amateur here looking for advice! I've been wanting green ink for a while now but was too lazy/cheap to buy a nice new bottle, and came across an old broken ballpoint pen with nice green ink... I want to try breaking the pen open for the ink and put it into my converter for my fountain pen. And following this thought, I'm feeling like a mad scientist and I want to combine nice colors (like blue and green) from old ballpoint pens and make my own colors.

My worry though is that by doing this, I'll ruin my pen or converter somehow... It's not a big deal since it's not expensive but I'd rather not have to buy another one. Do any of you have any info on whether this is a fine or disastrous idea? Thank you!

(I'm currently on my second fountain pen, a cheap 10$ pen with an ink converter. I currently use blue and black Iroshizuku ink)"

maybemaybemaybe,fmt08d1,t3_fx094n,1586364777.0,Did anyone else find it oddly satisfying when the cats finally knocked everything over? There was something deeply unsettling about how perfectly untouched everything else was. Seeing the chaos was like sweet sweet release.

Hope to see some of you there!"
