ucr,fpbny71,t1_fp0zx5y,1588474428.0,The news came from the CNAS chairs and directors meeting in April.
ucr,fp055vx,t1_fozy4v5,1588202683.0,Agreed! It seems like they are only announcing the shift to online quarter by quarter so far though. I hope they can rip the bandaid off and just tell us if everything will be online or if will be just 1-2 quarters online.
ucr,fozbtys,t1_foz8ec9,1588188037.0,I just opened permissions for everyone to fill out the form regardless of if you have a UCR email address or not. :)
ucr,foyz22j,t1_foyxm3r,1588181821.0,Agreed. The worst part is that there's no scientific backing to this claim. It seems like this is being suggested as a way to cut infrastructure and building maintenance costs.
xxfitness,fo72c21,t3_g5tsze,1587571007.0,"I bought a wall calendar and get to cross off a day if and only if I workout for 30+ minutes. I got so excited to cross off a new day and continue my streak that I've worked out every day for 5 months now! Some days are easier (30 min power walk), other days are more strenuous (60 min HIIT), so there's still a lot of flexibility in the schedule.
I'll second Peloton digital and Dog Dog, too :)"
xxfitness,fo3bogv,t1_fo3bajq,1587484131.0,"I leave it in for 28 days then replace it with a new one. After my first 3 months, my doctor checked in to see if I had spotting, in which case she recommended that I replace the NuvaRing at 21 days (but I didn't have spotting so I'mon the 28-day cycle). I hope this helps!"
xxfitness,fo37kk7,t3_g5cqt9,1587482026.0,"I've been using NuvaRing for 3 year now and love it! I do continuous birth control for health- and work-related reasons and NuvaRing works great for that - I just leave it in for an extra week and have never had any spotting. I was on several different hormonal pills before this and had terrible side effects like mood changes, heavier flows, depression, migraines, weight gain, etc. (around 5 years of trying different options). I'm so glad I found the NuvaRing! Please do what's best for your body - try it out for a month or so and assess how you're feeling as you go. Best of luck! :)"

YouShouldKnow,flm5pzp,t3_fpdxob,1585275195.0,Down Dog is a great yoga app that extended it's free trial to 90 days for teachers and students.
