funny,fp3i6zu,t3_gb0y6w,1588279738.0,I’m ordering this book for my mom.

Ymmv."

But when everyone already carries around a computer in their pocket that’s capable of all that and more, it makes it kind of sting to pay another hundred bucks for that same functionality. 

It’s like how people stopped buying ipods and mp3 players once phones had comparable storage and capabilities."
funny,fot04p2,t1_foskbsh,1588041716.0,"Don’t worry, they still cost a hundred bucks and are still required."
aww,fo4eevj,t1_fo4brfo,1587502926.0,"Looks like the HyperX double shot PBT keycaps, they’re available on Amazon and Best Buy. That style with the transparent sides are “pudding” keycaps, and Ducky just released their own set as well. 

The spacebar came with the keyboard, they release a different one each year based on the zodiac animal."

AnimalCrossing,fnryn0j,t1_fnrxeqy,1587206639.0,Thanks! That’s what I’m trying to do but I’m tired so I wanted to see if it was actually necessary or if it could wait. Glad I’m not doing it now for no reason at least!
AnimalCrossing,fnrxzpx,t1_fnrxlfq,1587205934.0,"No, actually. You have to completely quit out of the game before adjusting, but I’ve never messed with the network settings. Friends can visit my island fine and everything."
AnimalCrossing,fnrx8fe,t3_fvzvei,1587205093.0,"When you build a new plot of land, sometimes a random villager will just move in. The last plot I added sat empty for a day and then was marked as SOLD the next. Does this happen at random, or is it always after the same amount of time? Wondering whether I need to rush out to recruit somebody for my next plot before it automatically fills."
AnimalCrossing,fnrvh9z,t1_fnrm72s,1587203141.0,"I would suggest maybe setting your Switch to a different time zone that aligns better with your schedule. As others pointed out stuff you can still do right now, give it a few days to kind of get an idea of the flow of the game and how activities are affected by the time, so you know what would be ideal. 

For example, I changed my Switch to a time zone three hours behind my own because I found I frequently could barely get on before shops closed in the evening. Now I have plenty of time and don’t have to worry about it, but also still get to engage in nighttime activities. 

Compared to the time traveling people do to skip ahead, etc, once you find a time offset that works for you you don’t need to mess with it, and still get to play the game at the pace it was meant to be played."
