pathofexile,fmxal1b,t3_fxxqlr,1586461467.0,"People typically build their characters around a skill rather than an ascendancy. For instance, someone might really like venom gyre, so they pick assasin as their class because it helps scale the build. It's not so much which ascendancy is the best but rather which skill is flavor of the month and which ascendancy would best compliment that skill.

So I wouldn't worry about which is class is ""better"" but rather find a skill that looks really fun to play and then choose the class that's best for it."

pathofexile,fmlka1l,t3_fw0y7j,1586188073.0,"They're deep delving builds once you pass a certain depth, there's no amount of defenses you can build that will protect you even from getting one shot by one white mob. These builds take CI to be immune to chaos ground effects and spec only in to damage and just dont get hit by moving faster than mob action speed"
