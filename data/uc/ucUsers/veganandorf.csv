cscareerquestions,fpmh8c4,t1_fpleabb,1588733020.0,"Not OP, but many comments ITT are in agreement that omitting Linkedin and including Github is the way to go (without explanation). Can I ask why you think the opposite is better?"
UCSD,fpj910i,t1_fpinjkt,1588660290.0,Yoooo same here! I've been doing 3-5 leetcodes a day while also learning Ionic to make a cross platform app! And this might honestly be my very first straight A quarter. I'm in heaven.
UCSD,fpfj82k,t1_fpew94a,1588572907.0,"Sounds like your team was poorly managed, tbh. We assigned the deadweight in our team to documentation duties and it worked out fine. Skills varied, but everyone did what they could, and our app was even voted up to the top 4. Mind you, it was a website, and exactly 1 person actually had previous webdev experience lol. The whole ordeal was really empowering, and I'd hate to see classes like these get watered down to soothe all of the butthurt souls."
nutrition,fowclxf,t3_g9to39,1588117185.0,Surprised no one has mentioned B12 yet. B12 and D3 are the two that the majority of the population are deficient in.

Supplements,fo1khgs,t3_g53p51,1587435263.0,"I‚Äôm in your boat OP. Also doing IF, also highly sensitive to caffeine. I hear you drink water, but what about HOT water? This is my #1 trick for quieting the mind when it shouts at me about food. After 4pm, it‚Äôs hot water for me until 8am the next day. My appetite is nuts and the warmth really does it for me for some reason.

Anyway, in case you‚Äôve tried that and it‚Äôs not for you, the saffron extract someone else mentioned seems promising. At 30mg and 100mg doses, it‚Äôs been studied to treat depression, which is cool. Kinda eyeing it myself tbh"
vegan,fny874p,t1_fny5uay,1587355827.0,"Her top lid rests quite low on her eyeball. Note, however, that her bottom lid is also quite low, exposing much of the sclera. A high person would appear to be squinting, and so their bottom lid would rest higher, revealing less of the sclera. You are mistaken. QED"

Maybe they weighed the liquid ingredients before and after dressing the sprouts and used the difference to figure out how much was actually used. Otherwise, they‚Äôre definitely undercounting. Definitely."
