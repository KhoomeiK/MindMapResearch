UCSC,fnqsmaf,t3_g37i8u,1587171340.0,I have literally never studied anywhere else besides my room and it has worked out great so far and I’m about to graduate. If it works for you it works for you. Most of my roommates study elsewhere. Part of the reason I stay in my room though is I have back issues and I have an ergonomic chair that helps with that. Can’t bring that to a library. Also I don’t own a laptop so...

UCSC,fnkyyns,t3_g2ain7,1587043436.0,There’s currently a project that just started which is attempting to build a 1 to 1 replica of earth inside of Minecraft. You could find it on YouTube easily. If you make or contribute to a UCSC build you should submit it to the project.

UCSC,fnetyx4,t1_fnetehu,1586895808.0,"Instead of one campus community that would rally behind anything we have colleges which inherently divide us so we rarely unite behind anything as UCSC. It’ll be discussions of Porter or Cowell, never UCSC. It should be UCSC and they should create events as you say that would give us something to rally behind. That is completely non-existent here."
UCSC,fncmkdb,t1_fncm9ot,1586840665.0,"People get hella bored. The best advice I can give anyone coming to Santa Cruz is find something on campus to pour hours into. For me it was sports, but if that’s not you then there’s a reason we’re such a big research school. It’s a pain in the ass to get into town and once you’re there you have jack shit to do. That’s why it’s essential to join a club, do rec activities, and why sports should be supported to a greater extent. I don’t even know if we have a basketball team. Our biggest sports are swimming and probably ultimate frisbee. Biggest as in number of participants because it’s not like anyone watches either."
UCSC,fnciyyu,t3_g0wjhs,1586837955.0,Lmao at colleges 9/10
UCSC,fnbzz9v,t3_g0nubc,1586825739.0,UCSC should actually invest in sports and support athletes.

UCSC,fn81bsi,t1_fn7sr3n,1586731843.0,"Hard agree. It’s kinda hard to change any of the culture surrounding sports at Santa Cruz because most people come here knowing that sports are not a big thing here and so people who want to play will be an even greater minority than normal colleges. It kinda fucking sucks. Even fucking high schools have better fields and turf if it rains, here sports can be stopped if it rains heavily like it did last year where we weren’t allowed to use the fields for two straight months of our season. It fucking sucks to be a student athlete at UCSC."
UCSC,fn5dtu0,t3_fzmrl4,1586662274.0,"Idk if there is such a thing as a “strong philosophy department” anywhere in the US. I think you can go to the school you want and get a degree in philosophy and not much will change for you after college. That being said, I’m graduating with highest honors in philosophy this quarter and I’ve loved philosophy here at Santa Cruz. If it’s the best school you got into them for sure come here. The philosophy department is really good. If you also have the option of graduating from Berkeley though or somewhere equivalent then consider going there. What will matter most for a philosophy degree is where you graduate from. That’s for law school or grad school. Santa Cruz is a really good school too so if this is where you want to go then for sure come here."
