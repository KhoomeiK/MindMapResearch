Then you have the corporate restaurant chains who control 80% of the market who like the lower wages and would never increase their labour costs willingly.

So, you'd have to legislate it. Good luck with that."

This isn’t the real issue. Most waiters would say they’d hate to switch to a minimum wage job. No one who works a tipping job would want to switch to minimum wage. It’s benefits no one in the industry. They make a Lot more money with tips Per night then they ever would With min wage"

(Edited accordingly.)

Editing again: I'm not saying it SHOULD matter - it shouldn't, because refusing to pay your employees a living wage is not okay, and your employees shouldn't have to rely on inconsistent tipping from customers to figure out if they'll manage to pay the electric bill that month. Some have assumed I meant otherwise and I apologize for not making that clear. But, until we abolish tipping as a part of wages, tipping does matter. It will be nice when it finally does not."

Hated the “if you can’t afford to tip, you can’t afford to eat out” mentality. Especially since Canadian waiters/waitresses are paid minimum wage. 

As a student I didn’t have a lot of money. Even tipping the 10-15% always hurt cause believe it or not that was money I could’ve used on a shit Tim Hortons coffee to help me pull of my all-nighter. Now just cause I can’t shell out and give EXTRA money as tips, it shouldn’t mean that I can’t eat out. 

As for the “oh but waiters/waitresses deal with such shit customers and have to smile throughout” so does literally every other profession which deals with customers!!!!

I also still have to maintain my smile and be nice but I don’t even get an extra 10%+ for doing that what the fuck.

Itd make sense to replace it with a commission based job. 

Because at the moment theres base pay plus tips. 
A customer pays the price of the item plus the tip plus tax. 
The price of the items should be increased to reflect the commission going to the worker

Downside for those workers is that all the 'tips' will have to be effectively taxed.

I don't get how this is supposed to work. Apparently, according to other people in here, the employer is meant to compensate but it also doesn't happen often. 

In England, £2.50 is just a death sentence. You're effectively homeless, starving and have zero financial security. But then again, the tiniest and shittest houses cost upward of £350,000. Which is like $400k - $450k.

Also.  This applies to the pay period, not each hour. 
At the end of the pay period, if a server does not make 9.15/hr the restaurant is supposed to make up for it.

So I guess this cannot be change that easily"
arabesuku,fe5rmp0,t1_fe5g6ks,"I worked at one of those restaurants. It had its pros and cons. It's really hard to retain employees because employers just could not match what they were making in tips, therefore employees would go elsewhere. On top of that we still weren't receiving any benefits so why work somewhere where you are paid less AND don't get benefits? I think a lot of people forget that servers don't commonly receive them, so they rely on tips to pay for healthcare etc. 

I would agree with no-tipping a lot more if it meant fair wages plus benefits. Tipping isn't common in EU, but then again they have free healthcare and education."
Moosicled,fe66dv1,t1_fe5rmp0,"The UK has free healthcare, many other European countries don’t. You need health insurance.

noahch26,fe7nylt,t1_fe5rmp0,"This is the thing nobody really talks about when they talk about getting rid of “tipping culture”. 

If you have a system that relies on tipping, it gives the employer the potential to have a lower cost of paying the employees, and the employees usually make more than they would off of an hourly pay. 

If you get rid of the tipping system, prices will be raised so that the cost of the tip is included in the initial price, so customers will still be paying the same amount. So then the employer has to spend more on labor cost while the employees are likely making less money overall. 

In either system the customer is paying the same amount for their meal. But in the tipping system, it’s maximized for the business owner and the server to both potentially make the most money."
Anti-Fairy,fe69bx4,t1_fe66dv1,It's free as in there is no tuition persay. Public school is paid with a school tax homeowners are required to pay whatever town they live in.
Subtletequila,fe6ajgx,t1_fe66dv1,"Just like ""free"" national healthcare is paid for by taxes, so is public education (1st-12th grade) in the U.S. Typically it is paid for by property taxes."
arabesuku,fe6ddu5,t1_fe66dv1,"I should say ‘single-payer’ rather than free, which holds true for most Europe and tends to be significantly more affordable than privatized insurance. The US has the most expensive healthcare in the world.

Switerzland, like the US, isn’t single payer and requires everyone to purchase privatized health insurance. It has the most expensive healthcare in Europe yet the US still spends more. Switzerland has caps so that people won’t spend more than 10% of their income on healthcare. 

Public primary and secondary schools are free here, public higher education (universities) are not, unlike most of Europe. In the UK public university prices are capped at 9,250 GBP (or 12,000 USD) a year for full time students. No such cap exists here. Even the most expensive private college in the UK is only 17,500 GBP, or about 23,000 USD. That’s honestly considered an extremely fair price in the US. The average student here spends $30,000 a year on tuition, and most of the top private universities cost $50,00 a year or more.

CountPengwing,fe4lq48,t3_enrpda,"As someone who tips on all my services (food, spa, delivery  etc) I would prefer to pay higher menu prices and not feel compelled to tip unless the service is exceptional.

I wish employees were paid enough without tips so that a tip could become recognition for great service."
trawler852,fe51djg,t1_fe4lq48,I think this the correct opinion. Just work the tip into the cost of the item and pay a proper average on the payslip. No one need worry about bad tippers when there is np choice.
AnswerIsItDepends,fe55yaa,t1_fe4lq48,"Personally I am of the opinion that it is fine to not leave a tip if you get crap service.

I have done tax returns for restaurant's and bars, so I have seen ALL the W-2s for the waitstaff.  The full time ones are making $50-$80k per year, and this probably doesn't include all of tips left in cash.   I realize that it may be different in other places, and there are certainly exceptions, but I am not buying that these people are poor because they don't make enough money."
nomnommish,fe6nnz6,t1_fe4lq48,">As someone who tips on all my services (food, spa, delivery  etc) 

Actually we don't. Tipping is completely arbitrary in America. You don't tip supermarket workers or the guy who checks you out or bags your groceries. You don't tip the UPS delivery guy even if he delivers your packages in snow.

You don't tip your bus driver or train conductor. Or the doorman in your building. 

You don't tip the cooks and chefs  who actually cooked your food and instead tip the person who just fetched it from the kitchen to your table."

Anomalousalienx,fe688r3,t1_fe4lq48,"Agreed.

Kalgor91,fe78mk1,t1_fe4lq48,"I also wish that the prices were just higher. Some tipping doesn’t even make sense. I go to subway for lunch since it’s close to my work and I catch with this one employee and I just asked how all the workers split the tips since there’s an option when you swipe your card to add a certain percent tip and I was wondering how they figured out who made which sandwich and got the tip. He told me they didn’t get any of the “tip”. The only money they receive from tips is if it’s directly handed to them, all the money tipped when you use the card just goes straight to the manager."
MetaKazel,fe6io3n,t1_fe51djg,"Transitioning to the model is unfortunately tricky. If you raise your prices so that people don't have to tip, your prices just end up looking higher (at a glance) compared to the places next door, and you start to lose business. It really has to be a widespread effort, because the incentives to switch right now are pretty low, and the detriments are high.

Edit: I should point out that even as a former waiter I think tipping culture should be abolished."
localnatives3,fe5smmu,t1_fe55yaa,"I live where the minimum wage is $7.25 and if you dont tip its seen as an asshole move because where i live the rent has gone up double in ten years but minimum wage hasnt changed and most young people are working 2-3 jobs(either share tips, personal tips or none and pay is $8-10) just to afford a two bedroom apartment with a roommate. Not mention the ones in school tryna juggle two jobs and workload/classes. I would MUCH rather be PAID and not tipped because tipping is so unreliable you could be the best server with best attitude and still have 20/50 customers tip less than 20% or nothing. I wish tipping was done properly here for recognizing exceptional service instead of what feels like them dangling a living wage above us saying its our fault if we cant survive."
lakazepo,fe6f2lw,t1_fe55yaa,Agree with that last part 100%. I worked in retail with a roommate who was a waitress at Dennys. Our min wage was 11 or 12 an hour. She was ballin compared to me lol.

Asydra,fe5awwn,t1_fe54kel,"I live in Germany and we usually go by ""tips are for exceptional service"" so when you think your waiter was nice you give then as much as you think is appropriate. A friend of mine had a part time job at a little bar and got a normal wage (I don't know how much exactly) + the tips shared across the staff members and she did say it was the most appealing part of the job since there was plenty of tipping without it being obligatory. So I think even the people who like working based mostly on tips could still do so while getting a reasonable wage from their boss"
LordofKobol99,fe59u2g,t1_fe54kel,Sounds like they should give consistent excellent service then

abcdefmariah,fe6bsa5,t1_fe5bvoi,"This. I’ve been in the industry since I was old enough to legally work, and I would never bartend or serve if I got paid a “living” wage people keep talking about. When I worked 16 hour days in a very busy college bar I would leave with close to a grand. We were only open on football saturday’s so that would be what I made a week including maybe a $50 paycheck. Most people don’t know we don’t get breaks. If we’re busy and there are tables to be served, I do not get a break. It’s normal in the industry. Customers are the top priority, not me, and that’s ok as long as i’m making the money I need. We don’t get benefits. No healthcare(not all restaurants, but a large majority of them do not offer any healthcare). All of my tips cover my copays to urgent care/any emergency room visits/dental and vision plus any other obvious expenses. If restaurants paid a “livable” wage I wouldn’t work for less than $30 an hour and I would want benefits. That’s how *most* (not all) people in the industry I’ve spoken to feel about it as well. Burgers at chain restaurants like Applebee’s would skyrocket to prices no customer would want to pay and restaurants would start to close. As much as people want to abolish tipping culture, as someone that would be directly negatively impacted because of it, it’s something I do not want to happen. I would be fucked."

thrasha666,fe7kb72,t1_fe5bvoi,I had the same experience when I was working as a server in college. The only people that have this opinion are those that never worked in a restaurant or are cheap tippers. On good nights I’d make $60 an hour. No one would pay that high if it weren’t tips
iceflame1211,fe7q96t,t1_fe5bvoi,"I'm in this boat, but as a server. A lot of servers in my state fought against being paid minimum wage/repealing the tip credit, because with tips we make a whole lot more. I understand not every server in America is in this boat, but many are. 

It's very difficult for a restaurant to transition to paying full minimum wages to FoH staff. Price of food will go up significantly, leading to loss of customers due to the elasticity of demand in the restaurant business. There are several other nuances that I studied before making a presentation to my state legislature about it. 

If there was a viable way to transition servers to making a full minimum wage plus tips I'm all for it, but I've still yet to see a place do this successfully where servers actually make more after the switch to this."

Arkhaan,fe6o94n,t1_fe6fd1c,So? We like the way it works here. Most servers make FAR more money than a “living wage” off of tips and taking the pay cut to deal with people like you isn’t worth it.
keepkraken,fe6q6as,t1_fe6fd1c,"No. Not with the culture now. I have also worked in restaurants (front  of house only) from foodrunner to bartending.  There is no way any of the solid employees would do the job at the ""living wage"" when they can walk with $300-$800 a night depending on job and company.  Commission in the form of auto-gratuity based pay is the only compromise between both arguments that makes practical sense. 

Side note: if you are in America, most of us get payed $2.13  an hour. Tip your servers and bartenders at least %15 but %20 is standard for good service. Telling us we did a great job does not pay our bills, money does."

I think you’re the one who needs to “get real” friend."
aliahanne,fe6s8j7,t1_fe6htvv,"To say bartending is not skilled work is proof you have never worked high volume bartending or been in the industry at all. Being able burn and turn drinks, keep pour counts spot on, craft cocktails, maintain stellar customer service dealing with often times drunken assholes is hard. There are shifts you don’t stop moving for hours on end. No breaks. People make careers off this because being a fine bartender is a skill. You can go to school for mixology too. Flair bartending is an amazing skill too. Not everyone can handle the stress both mentally and physically that comes with this job. 

We make good money because people come out and spend money. An average night I am making thousands of dollars in drinks a night. Serving hundreds of people. If people did not come and spend their money, we wouldn’t make money. It’s simple supply and demand at that point. If my bar is selling over $25,000 in liquor a night, the people making those drinks are going to see good money."

I had to move and now work 50 hour weeks making half of that because in the town i lived, working there and making that money, I still couldn’t afford the rent and cost of living. I worked one day a week because I was in college. Yea I was spoiled there, absolutely, I had time for my studies but even with that money I couldn’t afford to live there and didn’t have time to get another job. Where did I state in my comment that I think trades or other professions shouldn’t be paid more and that I deserve more because I work at a bar, though? I made that money and got that job because I’m good at it. You think making that kind of money doesn’t bring in hundreds of applicants and college students that think they can do it and that it’s easy? It’s not. I’ve had glasses thrown at my face, I’ve been decked in the face by drunk men, groped. It’s a hard job and I work hard for my money. Servers and bartenders work hard for their money. I can type all night about the negatives and positives about working in the service industry and none of it would matter. Because your comment right there says it all. People will demand a service such as someone taking care of them on their nights off but then disrespect them and call them spoiled for wanting to be paid the wage they deserve. Grow up.

Nash015,fe8jrgw,t1_fe6ituu,"Ya I've tried to reason with people who know nothing about this industry, but want to be involved because they think they know what would be good for everyone.

Going to a no tipping culture would mean loss in quality of service (the really good servers would get out of the industry/there would be less servers working the floor on a given night), raised prices (most restaurants need to run about a 60% margin to survive and be profitable, throwing 6 of 7 20/hr employees in will greatly hurt those numbers), and decreased quality (full service restaurants would die out at a faster rate than they already are)"

Your server at Chili's isn't making ""far more than a living wage"" unless you think the federal minimum is a living wage. And don't forget the lack of any benefits whatsoever. Want a one week vacation? Gotta save up enough to pay for your vacation, and cover all your regular bills, and a lot of managers make you find someone to cover all your shifts while your gone or you won't have a job to come back to.

No, I literally don’t stop moving from the second I clock in to the second I clock out. People that say bartending isn’t a skilled work are out of their minds. We train and hone our craft for years to give the quality drinks and service that we do. I have regulars that come to see ME, they don’t care about the restaurant I’m at. They follow where I go."
Arkhaan,fe6pj5f,t1_fe6ozn5,"Born and raised in Eastern Europe, emigrated here as a teen, have since traveled much of Europe, and boy let me tell you, I understand why they don’t like tipping, because they are thinking about European servers, and they suck. Hospitality doesn’t exist. American and to an extent Canadian servers are LEAGUES better, they are more attentive, they solve problems with alacrity, and they get your food to you quicker as well and I am almost certain that the reason is because of tipping, there is an incentive to actually bust your ass for every table"
PM_ME_UR_ALLIGATOR,fe6tnsv,t1_fe6pj5f,"You're making one big mistake here, and that is assuming everyone *wants* the American style of serving; incredibly hands-on and rushed.

When I'm going out to eat, I want to be able to quietly sit down, not have someone come to me every five minutes asking if everything is alright, and not be rushed to eat as quick as humanly possible and be out the door again as soon as possible."
edafade,fe746il,t1_fe6tnsv,"There's the major difference. Eating in Europe is an experience, not a rushed chore. They aren't trying to flip the tables as quickly as possible. I like being left alone with my food, my friends, and my date. I don't need someone to check on me every 5 minutes to see if I need something to drink or the check. I'll call you over when I need something.

Let's be real for a minute. The faster a server flips a table, the more tips they stand to make. It all comes back to tipping."
Arkhaan,fe8lh91,t1_fe6tnsv,"Lol. No I am not assuming everyone wants American style service. Europeans are quite happy with their service culture and that’s good for them. Europeans running their mouths about American preferences when they don’t understand pretty much anything about Americans pisses me off though. 

Also, you aren’t being rushed in an American restaurant, they are perfectly happy to let you sit your ass there for hours. Your food and orders happen quickly because usually Americans like to be in, eating, and out in under an hour because they typically have things to do or other plans for the day. 2 and 3 hour tables that are friends just sitting around talking happen regularly, no one cares, if you want to sit then sit, if you personally feel rushed, from a spine and mention to your server “hey I feel like you are rushing me a bit here, can I have a few mins just to sit and enjoy the evening? I’ll flag you down when I am ready to order.” And I can almost guarantee the server will happily let you be till you want something."

Sailor_Callisto,fe61tiq,t1_fe56vmk,"I’ve started noticing more small “fast food” food service places doing this. My local donut shops, coffee joints, fro-yo/ice cream/gelato shops, taco spot, poke bowl places, ALL have a tip feature. It’s ridiculous. It’s especially frustrating when the cashier asks you if you want to leave a tip or when there’s no button to decline a tip. 


I also can’t stand that retail, drug and grocery stores all ask if you want to donate money to something. It’s a easy, instant guilt trip every time. Oh, you don’t want to donate to a charity for kids with cancer? Oh, you don’t want to help our vets? Oh, you don’t want to help starving, under-privileged children? You’re an asshole. Goodwill has even started asking you to donate your change and round your purchase price up to the nearest dollar. Because it’s “change,” most people say yes. Just think of all the money Goodwill racks in because of that “donated” change.

Edit: changed the service type to food places that are considered fast food."

If you got rid of tipping then businesses would up their pay only to the minimum wage, and every server would be taking a pay cut.

The people who actually cooked the food don't even receive the tip money and they work even harder and are paid shit wages too.

20% is considered the average tip where I’m from though as few as 5 years ago it was seen as an extra-good tip, because 15% was average. 

Nobody has an issue with the fact that they got tipped 20%... it’s the fact that they got tipped $5. Even though it accounts for about 20% of the tab, a lot of people consider a $5 and less to be a poor tip, regardless of percentage when the tab is above $20."

Most recent place I owe 1% of my food sales to the food runner

2.5 % of overall sales to the busser

And 3.5% of alcohol sales to the bartender

Say your check was $80 in food and $20 in alcohol , I owe $1( it get rounded to nearest dollar ) to the food runner , $2.50  rounded to $3, to the busser, and the bar $1. Of you u don’t tip me at all I have to pay $5 out of my pocket to be your server.

I am just going to talk about the most common tipped industry, restaurants. First, restaurants run on very thin margins between costs and profits from sales, if it went to the standard hourly wages those wages would be really low. Second depending on the establishment servers may be doing really well on tips. I worked in crappier places and the tips sucked, but I paid my dues and got into nice establishments in which I averaged $25-35 an hour on tips, which was great for part time work."

There's lots of other competitive industries with slim margins, and there's no tipping culture in them. If you can't find a way to do it, your business deserves to fail. Other people will find a way."
stoichistorian,fe48c7k,t1_fe484uz,If you don't make the minimum through tips then then a restaurant is obligated to cover the difference. I think this rarely happens.
anonymousforever,fe5atmi,t1_fe484uz,"the way it works in the US, the employer is required to make up the difference if the persons tips for the *week* don't average out to minimum wage. so if they work 5 days, make almost nothing in tips on monday, is off tuesday, makes minimum wage worth of tips on wednesday and thursday, but does really well in tips on friday and saturday, and the *total* amount in tips for the week adds up to exceed minimum wage when averaged across the total number of hours worked for the week... the employer doesn't pay anything extra to the employee, and the employee owes the government their income taxes on those tips they were given by customers.  

but on the other hand... if the employee worked sunday-thursday and their tips averaged out to less than minimum wage over those days, the employer would have to add in enough money to make up the difference so that their pay equals minimum wage for every hour worked. Then taxes are deducted, of course.

Does that clarify the strange way they pay servers in the US for you a bit?"
slippy204,fe48o5n,t1_fe48c7k,"oh okay, thats not as bad as i thought then! though i still think it should be the employers responsibility to pay at least that minimum wage no matter what, that’s just the job of an employer in my personal opinion, any tips on top of that should be a bonus instead of an obligation to customers"
aiydee,fe5zioo,t1_fe5atmi,"Which is just crazy.  It's adding extra work and extra chances to mess up.  I mean I know the US are crazy complicated for their tax system and all that, but this just sounds like pointless bureaucracy for the sake of bureaucracy alone.  
The customers are paying just as much because of the compulsory tipping culture.  If they increased menu prices by about 15 - 20% and did away with the tips, the customers would be paying just as much and the extra money means that they can pay the staff properly with a fraction of the faffing about.  It just boggles my mind.  (Australian who has worked retail and in a restaurant in the past)"

krazykakes262,fe64luz,t3_enrpda,Japan doesn't tip. They have a lot of great service at the local places I went to.

fritter_rabbit,fe62wd4,t3_enrpda,"This history of tipping in the USA is kind-of interesting.  The short version is, it started with prohibition.  Alcohol was the big profit-maker, and once they couldn't serve alcohol, owners started paying their staff far less.  They guilt-tripped the customers into making up the difference with tips. 

It's complete bullshit that it's still around, but the USA is super resistant to any kind of change.  Metric system.  Roundabouts.  Universal health care.  We're a bunch of damned Luddites."

She came back to me and said it made her day.  And that made me happy so I bought a meal for the homeless guy outside of the restaurant and gave it to him with a 50 bill. And you know what he did?  Omg it was so funny because it’s true. He actually asked me if I had eaten any of it!  Lmao. Or touched it!  Lol. I’m very particular about my food so I laughed and said “No man, it’s all good!”  And he had a toothless smile and I walked away happy.  I went home feeling so good and never told anyone about it.

Yippee614,fe5npoj,t3_enrpda,"Totally.

My best friend was against tipping. Then she became a waitress. All of a sudden, we went out to eat for a $10.99 lunch meal deal at our local sit down chain restaurant and basically made a scene because I wouldn’t tip $5 on a $12.30 check.....soon it became complaints that she only made a hundred dollars on tips for that night—instead of being grateful that some customers tipped at all.

I worked a minimum wage retail job and I was directly in customer service. My job didn’t get tips. I busted my ass just as much as she did. The way I grew up was, tipping is the tax percentage unless that server did an exceptional job and then you would give $2-$3 above that. Tipping was just that. A tip. Not an expectance for (most times in my experiences) minimal service. 


I know servers work really hard. But to me, when they are getting paid the same wages I am, I’m not going to tip 30-40 percent when they just basically did their job. You know why? Cause I also worked minimum wage and didn’t have the extra 30-40 percent to give to them on top of basic gratuities. I too understand the struggle of making ends meet while taking all the hours and shifts you can. 

On the other hand, when I go to my esthetician or tattoo artist, I give a hefty tip. Because unlike servers who you see for less than 2 minutes of your hour mealtime, this person who is giving you a direct service is with you, and you alone, for the entirety of your stay at that place. That kind of service is just different to me somehow.

Maybe I’m a bit of a hypocrite but I do agree with your statement, OP.

EDIT: this is not to say that restaurant staff are paid well, because they most definitely are not and put through the wringer almost daily. I just personally don’t like the stigma that tipping is becoming an expectation.  I would rather pay higher prices on restaurant experiences than feel obligated to give a server a tip if they didn’t do more than the basic stuff."
ServantLix,fe61kr8,t1_fe5npoj,"The servers generally make way more than people in the kitchen because of tips, sometimes more than the managers at high end places."
Swergerberg,fe6wm53,t1_fe61kr8,"> The servers generally make way more than people in the kitchen because of tips

Which is actually really irritating.  If I'm tipping anyone I'd rather it be the person who cooked my food than the server.  There are very few situations where it's fair for the server to make more than the cooks."

As a customer it means you are paying for your food and then paying the wait staff on top of that. Which one thing most people dont realize is there are some places where those tips dont just effect the waiter but host's and the bar as well. 

My gf worked at a Outback Steakhouse as a hostess. The waiters and bar tips were all added up and Outback would pay her a percentage based on that amount. So even if she did everything right, her pay to an extent was based on the performance of the other employees or happiness of the customers, in other words things that were completely out of her hands after seating them. Its baffling to me we still have a tip culture when there are countries in which it doesnt exist and even in some places its rude to a degree to try and tip."

kittyzoomer,fe5m7gp,t3_enrpda,"This isn’t really plausible in a lot of jobs because of labor. Labor *has* to be under a certain % or else corporate will get involved and cut down everyone’s hours, thus making even less money. If everyone gets paid more hourly, labor gets higher. 


We have this one lady at my job who makes more than our GM due to having been working here for 10+ years. As long as she’s on the clock Labor sky rockets and we’d have to be insanely busy to meet the sales requirements to make labor under 20% which is ideal. 

This isn’t really the case for waiting jobs where they’re paid 2.50ish an hour, but it is the case for most food service jobs where you’re getting paid base minimum on top of tips.

Just tip people if they weren’t an asshole. Really any decent server will be fine with a less than 20% tip as long as they’re not already being paid dogshit to begin with. Honestly just tipping a fucking quarter helps and every little bit adds up."

I’ve also heard from foreigners that service in the US is better than their home country. Sure, not every waiter is going to give you 100%, but you’ll get better service in general. 

Though, I hate tipping culture and wish it wasn’t a thing for services outside the food industry (haircuts, spas, etc.). Those services already have a person’s labor calculated into the cost, where restaurants don’t include that so their menu prices can stay low."

I've had really shite experiences that I'm not gonna pay a damn cent extra for. And at the same time I've also had really good experiences that I'm willing to be almost double for. But why should the customer ever have to pay the employee for doing their job? That doesn't make sense, as far as I've always learned tips are meant to show someone that you enjoyed yourself more then usual.

8636396,fe5gbqs,t3_enrpda,"I recently became a server, and there are two points that I feel are very important here. Firstly, our base hourly is $2.85. By law, employers are required to pay us the difference if we don’t make the equivalent of minimum wage for a week, however this requires the effort on our part of counting our tips, doing the math, then going to our managers and telling them we didn’t make enough for the week. They naturally assume that we’re not doing well as servers, when the truth is that many people (I’ve noticed, many foreign people who maybe aren’t familiar with the system) just don’t tip. 

The second is that when we finish serving and it’s time for sidework (cleaning dishes, wrapping silverware, whatever), we’re getting paid below minimum wage for this work. Sometimes the dishes stack up so bad that it can take up to an hour to clean them all, keeping us from our families, personal rest time, or other responsibilities. For $2.85/hr. How fucked is that?"

We were a table of 5  ( 2 of us worked in this very kitchen )and we still left a 10% tip instead of nothing.

I served and tended bar all over the US for years until I left that line of work. It can be a great job. There’s nothing more demoralizing than working to ensure a restaurant guest has a great experience, only to get NOTHING out of it.

When tips don’t come in it effects the worker trying to make ends meet and NOT the business.  The individual people who hard providing services have hard jobs with long hours, etc.

I agree with you, thank you for saying this"
magic_gazz,fe68z14,t1_fe53yb3,"If you are a server and you are expecting a tip, you shuould be doing your job well.

You shouldnt expect a 20% tip for very little work done poorly just because your base pay is bad.


Think about it this way. How much time are you spending with one table? Do you really think those people should be giving you $50 for less than an hour or even half an hour of your time? Why do you think you deserve such a high rate of pay for doing one of the most basic jobs?

If you want the good tip, do the good job, dont act like you deserve it just for showing up."

I find it amazing how people in the US don't understand why it's a stupid culture. I've also been told that the servers start to try to make people leave after they eat. In other places of the world, you get to stay at the table and talk, maybe order a coffee. If the server starts to get pushy for you to leave, he will look like an asshole. If they demand a tip or bitch about it, they will look like assholes.

And they expect a % of what you paid for. Why should you pay more for the service when you already paid more for what you actually bought?"
complexluminary,fe69ebn,t1_fe68z14,"Agreed. Totally accurate. My point was that not tipping doesn’t actually affect the restaurant. There’s always younger, poorer, more exploitable people willing to work for less money. The qualified, old-school, career waiters will just move on to better restaurants where people tip. It happens; you follow the money. 

I did it several times before I left the service industry.

I use my waitressing job as a way to make more than minimum wage. I think that if we were to move away from tipping culture, I couldn’t make enough to pay rent on minimum wage or similar (because I work part time while I’m taking classes), which seems to be standard pay for the restaurant/food employees that don’t make tips. I also like that waitstaff can essentially control how much we make based on the quality of service we give. From the customer’s perspective, yeah, it sucks sometimes. We’ve all been there, especially when we feel obligated to leave a tip rather than feel happy to tip your server as thanks for good service. I don’t particularly mind tipping anyway, though, because I know what it’s like to benefit from that system, and I personally believe it’s just the nature of the industry. 

Now, granted, I wouldn’t mind being provided a living wage and then adding tips on top, but I don’t think that most businesses would be willing pay all of their staff actual living wages, since they benefit from only paying, in my state, ~$2.13 per hour for employees that make tips. Would it be nice? Yeah. But I don’t know if that’ll happen so long as greed is the loudest voice in the room. :/"

Most restaurants that open go out of business. Profit margins are so incredibly thin that they can barely afford to pay min. wage, let alone ""living wage""."
Lt_Doctor_Goober,fe5ojjf,t3_enrpda,"As someone who was a server once, I agree: the US needs to pay servers and waitstaff so much more. I got paid $2.25/hour, and the shifts I worked had close to no customers. I made about $25/week on average. The boss let me go because he felt bad I got close to no money...

He could have just paid me another $6/hour so I could at least make enough for gas money a day.

To be honest, I think they should get paid enough to live off of, but tips should be only done if you truly want to tip them. If they went above and beyond with serving you and making your experience good, fuck yeah they deserve a tip! But they should be paid well hourly too, about maybe $10-12/hour on average rather than $2-4/hour."

And I noticed they will offer free delivery to try to intice you to use their service. The delivery fee is the driver fee. So they're saving cost by cutting driver's pay.

TruCat87,fe61pi7,t3_enrpda,Honestly I've been a server for several years I wouldn't do it for minimum wage.

Although I will say tipping is very expected since we have to give 6% of our total sales back to the restaurant(it gets divided up between kitchen and support staff) at the end of every night. This is a regular thing at every restaurant. Although what’s NOT regular at my current job is once they tell us we’re “cut” which basically means we stop taking new tables and start working on other duties (called side duties) we only get paid for a half an hour longer when usually I end up staying at least an hour after being cut. So if I stay late to finish a table and they don’t tip it fucking blows. I will say I would never put up with working nights, dealing with some shitty entitled customers, and the incredibly unguaranteed hours if it wasn’t for tips."

maddyya,fe6f7ok,t3_enrpda,"I’ve started traveling when I finished High school and I’ve seen many different cultures by this point. When you go to Restaurants or bars in Europe, the service is nothing more than ordering, eating, paying and leaving. There’s rarely any connection or memorable experience with the server. here in the states, people are expecting to have a memorable experience when they go out to eat. Here’s where the tipping comes in! In Europe, tipping doesn’t exist unless you feel the need. European servers get paid more as if they’re getting tipped on every table. The servers in the states get paid less than minimum wage since we are relying on our guest to tip us based on our work and the experience they had.  (Don’t forget some of the tip goes to the bussers, food runners, hostess, etc) 

I get your sentiment. But Americans LOVE good service. The hospitality industry can either bump up our pay so that we make more than minimum wage and you can get shit service. Or, you can have a memorable experience from your server when you go out to eat. Because Eating out here is a luxury, not a necessity. if you don’t want to or can’t afford to tip, make yourself dinner at home. 

(I work as a bartender and I ALWAYS try my damndest to make sure each and every one of my guests are happy. Since I am ALWAYS expecting a 20% tip.)"
zbspeaksalot,fe6g9u6,t3_enrpda,Yes but working in the service industry in America has shown me you need to tip when people ask for it or there is an option too. It’s not a culture or a lifestyle.

Yes it sucks I don't get vacation time, sick pay, or health insurance (what american can afford healthcare anyway?). However, for me, the benefits of tipping far outway the the benefits of not. Tipping gets bad press. There is no way my boss could afford to pay me $60+ an hour. Adding all those benies and PTO doesn't add up to that either. I am just providing a counter argument. My experience has been a good one. If it wasn't worth it I wouldn't have been doing it for 2 decades and still be happy doing it.

The rest of the world advertises the actual price and it all seems to work fine. Servers etc who go above and beyond (or just give good service to someone who is feeling generous) still get tips. Often quite good, in fact. 
No one is ever really surprised or upset about the price when it comes time to pay, and servers still get paid whether the customer is feeling generous or not (or, say, if they've had a rough day and can't quite manage to be as ""on"" as usual). As for those servers who just can't be bothered, they generally won't last long before management intervenes."
grumpygusmcgooney,fe6p7ly,t3_enrpda,"My problem with anti tipping people is they aren't willing to fucking eat somewhere that doesn't do tipping. If you don't want to tip, take your food to go or go eat at McDonald's. 

By you eating in a sit down restaurant and not tipping you are 1) giving your money to the owner and boss you claim is causing the problem and 2) causing your server to LOSE money at the end of the night because they have to tip out the bartender and expo based off of their sales, not a percentage of their actual tips.

If you had problems with a server, I will assume your being entitled and rude. If you require extra service like you spilt water or don't feel like getting up to grab a sauce I will happily help you. You are not required to tip for this but i know I would. Furthermore if you want the servers to get paid more, than you will have to charge more for food. Tipping isn't just for food neither.

Servers aren't the ones who make the rules, and they're not rolling in financial security just because they make good tips sometimes.

That being said, restaurants are the real issue. Restaurants should merely pay their employees, even if it's via gratuity or raised menu prices. That I couldn't agree with you more on.

Edit: to clarify, I know very few servers who treat their customers poorly after receiving a bad tip (publicly anyway, most public expressions of dissatisfaction by a server result in immediate punishment or firing).

In my opinion it was well deserved and I’m happy to tip 20-25% if it means other people doing this job trying to make ends meet can actually make a living wage.

If it was minimum wage instead my earning potential would be cut in half. The business would charge much higher prices and then pocket it... Everyone would lose.

Waiters are barely paid by their employers, they're mostly paid by patrons so this whole being ""grateful"" idea is like saying you should be grateful that your boss pays you for the hours you worked under your employment contract, which is *the law*.  

It's a antiquated system, I agree, but if you aren't planning on tipping go somewhere that doesn't utilize the practice, don't punish the employees who are just taking the best job they could get at the time pay-wise because you disagree with the system.  You're only empowering the companies that continue to take advantage of tip culture and depriving employees of their wage."
Shigo96,fe5a1u4,t3_enrpda,"Exactly what I'm thinking. This is why I wouldn't go in a restaurant in America (I live in Germany). I know they have bills to pay, but it shouldn't be on the costumer to make up for that. When I tip, it's because I want to, not because it's expected of me. That this kind of stuff even is legal to begin with is astounding."

chermk,fe53ds7,t3_enrpda,"You may be right about how it should be, however as it is people should always tip. Figure the tip into the price to see if you can afford it. If you can not afford to tip, you should not go to serve at the table places."
vicorrin,fe6e6er,t3_enrpda,"Tipping culture exists because it’s just like every other service, you come in KNOWING you are requesting a service, so you pay for that service. You pay the neighbors kid to mow your lawn, that’s a service. You pay the barber to cut your hair, that’s a service. You pay me to refill your drinks, bring your 17 cups of ranch, and make sure your food is right, because it’s a service. IF YOU DONT TIP SERVERS, STAY THE FUCK OUT OF PLACES THAT HAVE THEM!!!"

TheJediPikachu,fe6h6fp,t3_enrpda,"I'm a full-time server in the Southeast US where minimum wage is 7.25 and server/tip wage is 2.13. My place of work does evaluations on our tip percentages because of this. I could lose my job if people aren't tipping. 

There was one time I got a stiff (a no tip) on an over 50 dollar bill and decided I'd return the check and ask if my service was ok. The response:

""Your service was amazing! We had a great night. I just do not believe in tipping."" 

My eye twitched as I nodded and walked away. Him not tipping meant I didn't get the extra 10 bucks for my groceries that night. My tip percentage went down, possibly pushing me forward in losing my job, because he did not believe in tipping. 

Y'all, if you don't believe in tip culture, the best way to boycott is don't go out to eat.  Don't go out then stiff your server. All that does is support the system and the owners paying their servers below a living wage and it further puts a server in poverty. 

Yea, plenty of servers make plenty of coin, but I do not. I'm lucky if I make 25k a year and that includes non-claimed tips. Please, either don't go out, or tip your servers."
Dannypan,fe6log1,t1_fe6h6fp,"How unfortunate that you were unable to buy groceries because your customer didn’t want to pay extra, instead of your employer paying you a fair wage.

Last year I had 2 PhD's, 4 Master's, and so many Bachelor's degrees on my staff. These employees were clearing 50k as servers and bar staff, the tip is the best part of the industry.  As an industry vet, I know it can also be the worst.  Hear me out.  I also know that if I cleared $100 on a Tuesday, I did a damn good job.  My tables were cared for, my guests were happy and it reflected in my tips.

I have a love/hate relationship with tips.

Also, there is a lot that goes into it from the restaurant side.  
If servers made $12/hour that simply comes out of the restaurant, which means the prices of things goes up drastically. Which means the cost of living goes up, which means minimum wage goes up."

It’s a fallacy that the boss is getting rich off not paying labor. That cost isn’t factored into the cost to the guest so until everyone is ready for a major increase in restaurant pricing to compensate the labor then we can’t move away from tipping.
kliftwybigfy,fe6puqu,t1_fe63cvf,"How do you figure? I've been to plenty of countries with no tipping culture and found both the total cost of eating out and the level of service to be better than in the US.

ChazzLamborghini,fe69hxc,t1_fe645kn,"You vastly underestimate the actual rate of tipping and the overall impact on labor cost. 15% of sales hasn’t been the average for some time, first of all. Then there’s also the fact that higher hourly wages are how both kitchen staff and management are retained so if the front of house (server) wages are increased to a living wage, then the cooks and managers will need commensurate raises or they’ll find other work. Additionally, tips aren’t legally consider wages so employers don’t currently pay payroll tax on that money. I can promise the difference will be passed on to the guest. By the time you factor it all in, you’re looking at significantly more than a 15% increase in menu pricing. Sure, $28 may be an exaggeration but the point remains, we have tipping because it keeps the cost artificially depressed. Every restaurant meal would become significantly more expensive. Not to mention the loss of skilled servers who have now lost the financial incentive that keeps them in a high stress and often thankless profession. The restaurant industry is one of the few service sector jobs where people can make better than minimum wage and if you brought it down to that, they’d find far less challenging jobs to do. Good luck getting 5 star service if you get rid of tips and don’t pay any better than minimum wage."

If you go eat, take up a table in a section, and don't tip, you're taking money out of that server's pocket.  Doesn't matter how you feel about tipping, if you choose to eat at that restaurant you are accepting that a tip is part of your cost.  If you go to a place like that, take up someone's time and prevent them from serving another guest that does tip, you're an unrelenting asshole.  If you don't like to tip, don't go eat at those places, or move to Europe."
lisasimpsonfan,fe5tffb,t3_enrpda,The reason tipping culture still exists because customers don't want to pay enough for food to cover a livable wage for the staff.  People like to blame servers for being greedy but but they are too cheap to pay $20 instead of $12 for a plate of food.  It is kind of funny because the ones that bitch the loudest about tipping are the ones that usually treat servers the worst in my experience.  During part of college I kept a roof over by head by waiting tables.  It doesn't matter if you work at an upscale place or a greasy spoon there are always people who bitch about the price of food and tipping.
just03_,fe5w5fm,t3_enrpda,"I think a lot of people don’t realize that as an entry level job with no education or experience, someone can make 50 or more dollars an hour as a server if they are good and work in the right place. No good server wants to work for a wage over making what they make in tips.

It’s not about restauranteurs not wanting to pay their servers, it’s actually the opposite, much like every other industry restauranteurs want their sales staff happy but servers incur no risk and no cost and make 10-20 or more percent of all sales.
Which is good for the customer because they get cheaper prices and better service. Service anywhere else in the world is horrendous as a result of a wage over tipping. It’s a winning situation for all parties."

throworht_awayawa,elsmsa,top_level,"After spending around $600 in textbooks in my first semester, I thought about what I could do to never deal with that bullshit again. If I couldn't find a PDF of my required textbooks online, I always went out of my way to get an electronic textbook every semester so I could utilize a simple Python program I wrote up that screenshotted every page of the e-text. From here, I scanned the images for duplicates and compiled them into a PDF if everything looks good. The whole process only takes like 17 minutes for fully copying and compiling an 800-page textbook.

After doing the do, I simply returned the textbook by saying that I purchased the wrong book or I dropped out of my class, and I get my refund immediately. Never once questioned about it in my four years.

I don't feel bad at all considering how shitty textbook publishers/college bookstores are for their ridiculous initial prices/buyback prices, as if it already isn't hard enough making ends meet with all the other expenses every semester.

But hey, anything to alleviate insane college prices nowadays.

&#x200B;

EDIT: For those asking if I can post the .py file, I don't have it any longer. I got rid of it shortly after I graduated so it couldn't be associated with me anymore. Also, it wouldn't have been much help since the program was slightly modified on a class-by-class basis since each e-text was typically from a different provider and had a slightly different e-text format. The main gist of my program was using pyautogui for screenshotting and pynput for mouse/keyboard controls, and you alternate between those two. I'm not encouraging anyone to go out and try this for obvious reasons, so do it at your own risk.

EDIT 2: It also sounds like u/uncommonprincess has got the .py file questions settled down! Another u/CurseDHeX has also pointed out the use of  [https://b-ok.cc/](https://b-ok.cc/). This can be a pretty great place to turn to at first if your professor doesn't care about certain textbook volumes, but I've personally had bad luck finding what I need on there.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Trump_Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Trump_Foundation) 

> On three occasions, Trump used the foundation's money to purchase artists' portraits of himself.

> In 2007, Trump spent $20,000 in Trump Foundation funds to purchase a six-foot-tall portrait of himself by artist Michael Israel at a benefit for a Florida charity, the Children's Place at Homespace, held at his Mar-a-Lago country club in Florida after his wife Melania Trump made the highest bid.[49][70][97] The painter's former production manager told The Washington Post that he had, at the request of Trump's wife Melania, shipped the painting to the Trump National Golf Club Westchester in Briarcliff Manor, New York, allegedly for display in the country club's boardroom or conference room.[49] The charity paid half the proceeds, $10,000, to the artist for the painting, which established that the painting had a fair market value of at least that amount.[98] Tax experts told the Post that if it was displayed at the golf club, it could violate Internal Revenue Service rules prohibiting non-profits from self-dealing, i.e. charitable funding of a noncharitable purpose.[49] In September 2016, President Barack Obama publicly criticized Trump's purchase of the painting.[49][97]

> In 2019, former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen testified to the House Committee on Oversight that in 2013 Trump had used a straw purchaser, billionaire Stewart Rahr, to ensure a portrait of himself would be sold for the highest price. Rahr paid $60,000 for a 9-foot tall portrait of Trump by artist William Quigley. He was reimbursed with money from the Trump Foundation. After the sale, Trump tweeted ""Just found out that at a charity auction of celebrity portraits in E. Hampton, my portrait by artist William Quigley topped the list at $60K."" Trump kept the painting.[101]

> In 2014, at a charity for the Unicorn Children's Foundation, held at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump purchased a four-foot-tall portrait of himself in the 1990s by Argentine artist Havi Schanz and paid for it with $20,000 of Trump Foundation funds.[48][70] A photo of the portrait was found on a TripAdvisor review of Trump National Doral Miami. Later, a reporter for Univision went to the club, asked the various staff about the painting and eventually discovered it hanging on a wall at the golf resort's Champions Bar & Grill restaurant.[102] Trump presidential campaign spokesperson Boris Epshteyn explained to MSNBC that Trump's use of the painting at Trump's Champions Bar & Grill was not only proper but beneficial to the foundation based on IRS rules that allow individuals to store items ""on behalf of the foundation—in order to help with storage costs"" and that its use at the restaurant is ""absolutely proper"" in that Trump was ""doing his foundation a favor"".[103]"

fresh-cucumbers,fdjwvuy,t3_elsmsa,I currently abuse the snipping tool to save money.
JuliusSnaezar,fdk8dtn,t1_fdjwvuy,"I love the snipping tool, underrated af"
zabaattack,fdk9kye,t1_fdjwvuy,Win + shift + s opens it right away
addocd,fdkq391,t1_fdjwvuy,"I use the snipping tool to cheat on online tests.  Not like in school, but the dumb ones I have to take at work.  Like the annual fraud or harassment training where I'm supposed to remember which states have a short reporting period or do not acknowledge the McSomething-Harper Act of 1980 something.  There is zero chance that I will ever need to know this off the top of my head."
throworht_awayawa,fdkw4bf,t1_fdjwvuy,"Considering textbooks are hundreds, sometimes thousands of pages long, that's why I turned to automating this shit haha. Anyone interested should check out Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart."

the_cucumber,fdkmebb,t1_fdk9kye,I just keep it pinned to my taskbar. I use it a ton at work and do the same for every new colleague and they always act like I've changed their lives.
48151_62342,fdkixhc,t1_fdk9kye,I guess that's only for Windows 10? I'm on Windows 8.1 and win+shift+s does nothing at all

motsanciens,fdpdisc,t1_fdk9kye,"Is there a kb shortcut for ""new snip""?"
say_whaat_,fdklq0z,t1_fdk9kye,"hey I just changed my printscreen button to it, use the snipped wayyyyy more than printing"
TombstoneAintThatBad,fdm3asz,t1_fdkw4bf,"I'm a bit confused.  Did you buy digitally, and automatically scan that?  Or did you buy physical, take a picture of each page, and the code automatically snipped them?"
pizzaninja199,fdk7ia8,t1_fdk7c3q,It's a screenshot tool that allows you to highlight a chosen area on your screen within Windows
kungfucuck,fdkjbop,t1_fdkhyv5,I fucking love gyoza
zabaattack,fdkt594,t1_fdkmebb,I took a basic computer class because it was required in school to move on to others and I watched my teacher struggle to screenshot something for like 10 minutes before I told him about it. Life was changed
gettingassy,fdkjnhq,t1_fdkixhc,"As one of the masochists who liked 8.1, why are you still on that version?"
throw_away_dad_jokes,fdks9af,t1_fdkixhc,use [greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/). more functionality than snipping tool and open source.
zabaattack,fdkj5sl,t1_fdkixhc,Yeah on Windows 10 sorry bud
zabaattack,fdpdm12,t1_fdpdisc,maybe ctrl + n when you have the snip tool open. Win shift s lets you take one immediately
zabaattack,fdkszw9,t1_fdklq0z,You can do this?
throworht_awayawa,fdm3f8f,t1_fdm3asz,"Digitally, then scanned that. Then compiled all the images into a PDF."
Imabidinghere,fdk7uwr,t1_fdk7ia8,Oh that's awesome. Thanks
MrNimi,fdkmbrk,t1_fdkjbop,I searched up gyoza instead of gyazo the first time and spent like 2 minutes scrolling through recipe websites
48151_62342,fdkldq6,t1_fdkjnhq,"idk, I was too lazy to upgrade when they were offering free Windows 10. I didn't want to have to store all my shit on an external drive and transfer it over. Plus I see nothing at all wrong with 8.1. The weird application stuff they added is terrible, but I never use it, so who cares"
FujiGoatBS,fdl196w,t1_fdkszw9,Probably a macro
TombstoneAintThatBad,fdm3qxu,t1_fdm3f8f,"How hard was it to write the code?  I'm a pretty inexperienced coder, and I havent used Python before (just C++ and Java).  I'm currently in college for programming

I am comfortable with handling file input/output in Java/C++ so it doesnt sound too bad if it's just a digital file that you downloaded and read into the program"
Anonymous18650,fdkd8ow,t1_fdk7uwr,"as someone mentioned above

very handy tool"
hairetikos,fdkmwzw,t1_fdkmbrk,did you find any good ones though
kungfucuck,fdkmufm,t1_fdkmbrk,"Sorry, bad joke.. shits delicious tho"
throworht_awayawa,fdm4kw7,t1_fdm3qxu,"It was a pretty simple program from what I remember, usually around 10-15 lines of code depending on the e-textbook format. Sounds like you already have experience with OOP, so Python should be a breeze for you. For each page, I used pyautogui to take a screenshot of a specific region of the screen and moved to the next page (usually with the right arrow key or clicking the left mouse button) using pynput, which are both modules for GUI automation and key/mouse automation, respectively. I then compiled all the saved images into a PDF using the built-in Windows 'print to PDF' function."
Disgruntled-Cacti,fdmf1m6,t1_fdm3qxu,"It would be very easy to do this with python. You would only need a few libraries and a couple lines of code. If you know the basics of Java/C++, this would be a breeze to recreate.

Personally though, I've always been able to find all of my STEM textbooks on [Libgen](https://libgen.is/) quite easily."
TombstoneAintThatBad,fdm4quv,t1_fdm4kw7,"Interesting.  I'm definitely going to give this a go, it could be really useful.  I'll probably fail miserably but that's how it goes haha.  Thanks for the info"
CryoClone,fdkbx32,t3_elsmsa,"My wife was in grad school and was in a very specific field where they charged through the roof for the textbooks she needed every semester. It would have easily been $1,000 a semester for books. 

I would buy an ebook, rip it to a format she could easily use (epub or PDF) then I would return it just like OP. Then, as a final FU to the textbook company, I uploaded it to Libgen so that anyone else who ever needed it didn't have to go through the trouble. 

I feel no remorse pirating a book they feel should be $300-500 because you *need* this year's edition instead of last year's $30 edition. 

It's why I love the history department of my college, they refuse to use textbooks in the traditional sense. They use either first person books (such as biographies or first hand accounts of events) or open source and free online resources. No one is required to buy a textbook ever, unless you just don't want to use a PDF (which is free) even then, the hard bound book is $50.  The other books are like $15 new and can be found for chump change used on Amazon. 

The only hiccup you hit is when the course is taught by the author of a textbook. When that happens, they got ya. No way around it then. Hard copy. Only available in the bookstore. Obscene cost."
mingus-ah-um,fdko7p9,t1_fdkbx32,I've had the authors of textbooks give PDFs or print outs of their textbooks to classes. But I've also had to buy other Profs textbooks. About a 50/50 split in my experience.
throworht_awayawa,fdkxabi,t1_fdkbx32,"That's awesome man. I typically hated the textbooks written by professors as they were always out of touched with their students, so having those be mandatory made me feel trapped like a rat"

rrr_zzz,fdkd5ps,t3_elsmsa,I stopped feeling bad about using free PDF versions or people making copies after a professor in collage made it a class requirement to buy five text books (two written by him) and then never actually using the two books he wrote in class. The next year he discontinued the use of both of his books and wrote another text book. Everyone in class had $800 worth of book that no on needed/wanted. Fuck that professor.
zorinlynx,fdkxogn,t1_fdkd5ps,"Never, ever, ever, EVER buy a book for a class until the first time it actually gets used in the course. Sure, you might have to take extra close notes that first day since you don't have the book but it's worth it for the vast money it saves. And these days with ebooks you can probably buy the book right there in class and download it to use in five minutes.

For some reason professors love putting books in the required list and never using them. This was a constant epidemic through all four years of my time in college. Saved thousands by not buying books that weren't used."
rrr_zzz,fdky0wt,t1_fdkxogn,"It was never an issue before because you could always resell them after the class, this professor was just looking to make some money off of his students."

CurseDHeX,fdk86e3,t3_elsmsa,hey op you can check out the site [b-ok.cc](https://b-ok.cc) you might just find your coursebooks over there and can avoid the hassle of screenshotting the textbooks
throworht_awayawa,fdkx0bx,t1_fdk86e3,"Yeah I addressed this in my post. I checked that out a while ago and my professors typically required the most recent volume, which the website was not the most up to date with.

hlh6563,fdk7byy,t3_elsmsa,"I tried this a few years ago, My school wrapped theirs (the cards that had the passcode for ebooks and the actual hard copy books) in this super flimsey plastic wrap and if the wrap was “broken” or opened you couldnt return it or even exchange it 🤡🤡🤡"
hfuga,fdkczrk,t1_fdk7byy,"Same. Also, we couldn't sell the books after the course or buy a used copy because each book was 'specially printed' for that year and that class. Each book contained a code that you used to do your coursework. My Algebra teacher straight told the class first day that we HAD to buy the book to have the access code to complete the coursework for the class...but that we would literally never use the book. The book was over $200. You could not purchase *just* the code, you had to buy the entire book. Utter bullshit."
MakeoutPoint,fdkev2n,t1_fdk7byy,I wonder if a shrink wrapper would be cheaper than the price of the books?
The-Only-Razor,fdknufb,t1_fdk7byy,"My school did this. Also, half the books were written by the profs teaching the class. Also also, they were mostly loose-leaf, handwritten pages."

throworht_awayawa,fdkxu8c,t1_fdk7krd,I added an edit to my post if you're curious about how it worked and any alternatives stated in the comments.

isactuallyspiderman,fdl38b1,t1_fdl27in,ppl get so gullible anytime someone mentions “coding”

daniellederek,fdk8hvy,t3_elsmsa,"I wouldn't feel bad either. The whole ""higher education"" field is a quagmire of kickback schemes and scratch my back I'll scratch yours.

Many many times I've heard of professors insisting on upgrading from ver3 to ver4 of a science book and the only changes have been cover, forward and 2 pages.  The reason, publishers leaned on them or offered a cruise/conference all expense paid, or $5k kick to dean of science."
NemoC68,fdkb99d,t3_elsmsa,"Higher education is weird.  


You have incredibly useful courses that teach practical skills and contribute greatly to science. You have courses that are the antithesis of education and literally spreads misinformation, you have programs that exist to save students money and help them earn money, and you also have programs that royally rip students off.  


It's a mess."
throworht_awayawa,fdkykyg,t1_fdkb99d,"It really is a fucking mess. It initially took me a lot of courage to want to even go to college in the first place, wanted to go to trade school or a technical academy at first, but I'm glad I stuck through with college in the end despite the crippling debt lmao"
AGirlhasnonaame,fdk913f,t3_elsmsa,"$600 for fucking texbooks?? Damn I think I only spent less than $40 for 2nd hand textbooks. We barely used textbooks in my univ, especially in my department."
MakeoutPoint,fdkes3d,t1_fdk913f,"Freshmen come in thinking you have to buy the book because that's what everyone tells them. 

Sophomores realize they can share the books with each other. 

Juniors find PDFs online. 

Seniors don't even look at the book list."
throwawayu72ui2i2u,fdkhq9k,t1_fdk913f,"I would just go to the secondhand books section of the website and buy one from a classmate because I like having physical copies (much more efficient imo when it comes to switching around pages quickly, or moving them around without having to rely on a laptop [phones are way too small and drain fast if the screen is always on]).

After the semester is done and I treated the book well, I'd sell it for pretty much the same price or a net loss of like $10"
Appropriate-Payment,fdkqso2,t1_fdkes3d,"What kinda dummies are you going to school with? People know that shit on day 1. Fuck I pirated all the books for every class we shared like 10 minutes into the first class on the first day. Set up a little shared folder for a bit, let everybody get it all.

There, you're welcome, rest of class. Now one of y'all go buy me a beer after class and we'll call it all even.

On a related point, one of the professors gave the barcode number or whatever for a book out to the class and said ""I'm not gonna tell you what to do with that, but I wouldn't pay that much for that shit"". You should've heard all the virus warning sounds popping up on every computer in the room."
zorinlynx,fdkxiq1,t1_fdkes3d,"I went to college in the 90s before all this access code and online assignments nonsense, but I had a policy that I'd not buy a book for the class until it was actually used in the course.

You wouldn't believe how many professors and instructors had a big list of ""required"" books and never touched over half of them during the class. Saved BIG money that way."
sassyandsweer789,fdk6uog,t3_elsmsa,This is genius. Unfortunately a lot of collages are now forcing you to buy access codes for assignments so you can't do this. My husband is taking a chem class where the teacher provides a free e book but makes them buy an access code to do homework. Whats the point of the free book when the access code comes with a book?
kingbradley1297,fdkgqt0,t1_fdk6uog,What? So now you've to pay to do homework given by your Uni which you already pay for? This is the first time I'm hearing of something like this
seacookie89,fdk7avp,t1_fdk6uog,"Requiring access codes unfortunately isn't a new practice, it was alive and well when I started college 10+ years ago :("
throworht_awayawa,fdky8k4,t1_fdk6uog,I seem to remember an econ class I took as a freshman where I got a refund by saying I purchased the wrong thing and they believed me lmao. They can't stop us
TheOriginalJoughe,fdlgcg8,t1_fdk6uog,"i misplaced my access code for a spanish course and despite having the receipt and a picture of the literal barcode numbers on the bottom access slip (not the code itself), nobody could help me and i had to buy another. Thought I lucked out because i had a snapchat with the info because I wanted the school to burn for making me pay $250 for online access to a non-major course. Still want it to burn."
GreenArcherNeedsFood,fdm1hkx,t1_fdk6uog,Ctrl+F might save him quite a bit of time at least?
KhaiPanda,fdkgofv,t1_fdk6uog,Yea I was about to say this is awesome except that I have to have access codes to do assignments. Freaking frustrating as hell.
Nerd-of-all-trades,fdk7gtp,t1_fdk6uog,I think I took that exact same chem class. It was ridiculous.
sassyandsweer789,fdkh1x2,t1_fdkgqt0,"Really? It's becoming pretty popular in basic courses. Especially Math, Science, and Bussiness classes. I live in America so it might just be an American thing. The courses are pretty helpful helping you understand things and have a lot if resources but the prices are always over 150 and its ridiculous. I can't do anything to get any money back after the course because it can't be resold"
sassyandsweer789,fdkh5p5,t1_fdkgofv,Yep. The access codes are always more expensive than just renting the book. It makes me wonder how much money the colleges are making off these codes
mekromansah,fdku040,t1_fdkgofv,"And most access codes give you access to an electronic version of the book anyways.

Sometimes I would be able to find the access code separate but later in my college years they wouldn't sell them separately which is such a shit move."
kingbradley1297,fdkharn,t1_fdkh1x2,Most probably is. It's not like that where I study. We get assignments that we have to upload onto a portal. We do some value added courses like from Coursera so paying for that makes sense. But to pay to do homework is really crazy imo
littleredteacupwolf,fdkcr67,t3_elsmsa,"I had a photocopier at my job and no supervision, so my best friend and I went halfies on our textbook and one night I just photocopied the entire thing, hole punched it and raided the supply closet for a binder and viola!

doesnt_matter123,fdk6q01,t3_elsmsa,My unis bookstore doesn't do returns or exchange. It pisses me off at the extent the school goes to rip us of the money
jreyn018,fdk7sb4,t1_fdk6q01,I didn’t buy anything at the bookstore. Always went online to different websites. There was one website I forgot about but it’s like bookzzz or something like that where I could find books for my non-science/math classes. I would also rent books out from different libraries. It was a whole process and I always had to be proactive about looking at the syllabus ASAP.
doesnt_matter123,fdk9go5,t1_fdk7sb4,Most of my books need to be bought at the book store since either the professor has written it or the book contains an online access code which is only good for one time use. I have maxed out my credit card for buying books for a semester
Envi_Sci_Guy,fdkhdf0,t3_elsmsa,"I accidentally bought a loose leaf chemistry textbook which is just as expensive as a normal textbook but can't be returned at the end of the semester for a pittance. I didn't know that until I went to sell it back to the book store. After being refused, I turned around to the photo copier, scanned the whole textbook, and uploaded it to the pirate bay."

CreamyPeanutButter14,fdk7cyt,t3_elsmsa,You could either make a business out of this or put it out on the internet so others can use it because man this sounds pretty useful
throwawayu72ui2i2u,fdkiiql,t1_fdk7cyt,"This has existed for over a decade. Not trying to downplay OP, but ripping textbooks is likely older than quite a few people who browse this website. Afterwards it's also a good idea to use an application and turn the images into a real (searchable and highlight-able) pdf to decrease size and add hyperlinks/make the TOC usable before publishing online on reddit or a torrenting website (Adobe has official documentation and standards on this)

It just isn't really popular nowadays for some reason, likely because its often not worth the effort since you can get secondhand books for almost free by buying and reselling.

Obviously, a physical copy is harder to convert"
CreamyPeanutButter14,fdkj9km,t1_fdkiiql,A lot of the textbooks I've had to get also require an online key as well so you have to buy the stupid thing
throwawayu72ui2i2u,fdkjq6p,t1_fdkj9km,"The price is the most absurd thing imo for the online access. It's like they know that no one is going to buy a brand new copy of their textbook so they sell the access codes individually for like $60+

Thankfully I just dropped the one class I had with that and the next teacher was great. I've also had teacher put links on their websites with textbook pdfs occasionally (one of them even scanned an entire textbook problem set section and sent the pdf to the class with the relevant problems circled in pen)"
NataliaMarie8,fdkgie1,t3_elsmsa,"I think this is deserved, colleges/universities make it their mission to take as much money as possible from us (to the point it's almost criminal). Then once every couple of years they add one new chapter in so you ""have"" to buy the newest edition which coincidentally costs the most. It's one big scam and good for you for figuring out how to outsmart them, they deserve it."
tresor711,fdkjzms,t3_elsmsa,"You can also buy cheap versions of the same textbook made for people in other countries. 

For example, I got a heat transfer textbook that's  normally at least $100 but got it online for $17 because it was made for students in India."
lettersfrommeme,fdkw9vs,t1_fdkjzms,Can you give an example of how to find the books?
tresor711,fdl3zb8,t1_fdkw9vs,"Just look up the international version of the textbook. You might find it's identical to the American version, except that it's a soft not hardcover and it might be smaller and also cost 1/10 the price."
Ryugi,fdknogm,t3_elsmsa,"To be fair the educational industry is a huge financial scam for anyone daring to better themselves.

Don't feel bad for it. 

I also recommend trying something like www.b-ok.cc (it's an international digital library with a ton of usually-behind-paywall studies and paper reviewed data, books, and yes textbooks)."
Vesuviate__1,fdlbto5,t3_elsmsa,It costs that much 😨
throworht_awayawa,fdlc702,t1_fdlbto5,"Yeah, depending on your major of course. I've noticed that social/biological science majors end up spending more in textbooks as opposed to, say, CS/data analytics majors as most of their coursework is through lectures, in my case."

UnlikelyPerogi,fdknvzp,t3_elsmsa,My friend and I did almost this exact thing eight years ago.

Returned them with the exact same excuses as you next day. Gotta be hustlin.
5l339y71m3,fdkouxx,t3_elsmsa,"This is brilliant. If you want bonus points after you graduate publish them to free education sites. I’m on phone not desktop so I don’t have access to my bookmarks but there are sites that have full courses and text books uploaded to them and accessible for free so under privileged ppl can still access degrees by studying free at home and paying a local college just to take the tests.

TheGabyDali,fdkqu84,t3_elsmsa,I was a little older than my classmates and consequently had more money. I’d always try to get a copy of the book before the semester even started and shared the pdf with my classmates through a group chat. Fuck these publishers.

Cybeary19,fdlsgr9,t3_elsmsa,I only needed two textbooks which only cost about £20 altogether. One of the good things about going to university in the UK

Setto_Arisaki,fdmaji5,t3_elsmsa,"Yup nothing wrong here.
I also pretty much don't pay for most electronics, since they often fail before my warranty which is 2 years by German law Rand out I just push them to replace or give me the money back. I am fine with only getting back a portion like like used value of it at that time, but what's the point of buying headphones so they break after 6 months and you have to pay 100 bucks again?
Make better products or lose money, but I am not your charity.

If the product didn't brake or I brake it myself I don't send it back obviously.
A some weeks old watch I got broke accidentally and I still need to get that watch repair kit to fix it.
I just had way to many tech products brake way to soon on me, and stores usually didn't take them back after 14 days. Since then I pretty much only shop on Amazon. I will much rather pay some bucks more than to deal with stupid excuse why they don't have to obey the law."

One of the textbooks had a return date for a week before the classes final. I obviously didn’t return it by the return date, and I had a $150 fee because of it. The book store also called and emailed me and my “emergency contact” 5+ times a day and said the late fees can only be excused if I were in the hospital or dead, me needing the book to study didn’t count.
A $25 rental turned into $175. Still not as bad as a new, hard back copy of the same book, but still highly unnecessary."
ramennumerals,fdkcung,t3_elsmsa,"At my school, not only do we need the books but we also need an access code to even get to our assignments. Where can you find the access codes? They’re inside brand new books that you have to buy, and once the access code is used the books can’t be returned or even resold afterwords because they’re worthless without the access code. It’s such a a waste of paper and money and I’m pissed all over again taking about it."

_LooneyMooney_,fdkdysz,t3_elsmsa,"Now if only I didn’t have to drop close to $200 for a textbook code for one semester of intermediate Spanish...my school wanted $250 for the code—that provides virtual text and access for homework that goes to the grade book—and looseleaf pages. I was able to just get the code straight from the publisher for 165 but they tacked on a $13 tax for it making it nearly $180. For a code. That I only need for 4 months. 

I have one professor that requires 4 different books for readings over the course of the semester. The total for that class alone would’ve been $60 but I found 3 of them on Library Genesis for free. So I ended up only spending $10 for that class. 

I found like half of my required textbooks on Library Genesis. Found one book for $4 on Thriftbooks. And hopefully I can get away with using a PDF of an older edition I found for another book. 

Surprisingly, my school does offer the lowest price when it comes to rentals. Even on Amazon it’s more expensive. So everything I needed to buy from my university bookstore only cost me about $65. As opposed to the $300+ I would’ve spent buying everything direct from them. 

Still spent like $250 overall because FUCK Vistas Higher Learning for charging so damn much. Better than it could’ve been but my bank account is still crying."

If a professor required a new version, the dean of their department and the textbook center needed to approve it. The center would then buy enough for the classes, with the cost distributed across multiple years' fees.

I only had to buy a couple paperbacks and get one professor's in-progress book printed at the University print shop, for well under $100 total."

When I taught, I fully endorsed stealing electronic copies of the books for my classes whenever possible.

You simply can't be ""pro-education"" and not find taking advantage of students in this way disturbing. And if you're in education, you have an obligation to ensure students whose educations you are fiducially responsible for have access to all materials necessary for your class.

I broke up with him in March but didn't have the heart to kick him out because he has no friends or family. He has no job. I couldn't bring myself to kick him to the curb knowing he would be homeless.

So I told him he could stay until the end of the lease when I moved out, and he couldn't come with me to the new place. He's known for months that this day was coming. It is now 10 days from now and he has made no arrangements. It's killing me to think about him sleeping under a bridge. I want to stay strong and not cave and let him come with me. I feel so guilty though. Thinking about him shivering in the cold really hurts. 

But I if I let him move with me, he will be with me for the rest of my life, and I don't want to be with him. He's 37 years old, and he has no job still. I don't want to pay for everything anymore. I just don't want him to be homeless."

This dude is just using you. He is not taking you seriously and he is probably planning on manipulating you into taking him to your new place. And you feel guilty? Thats exactly what he is counting on. Listen he is a grown man who got dumped and instead of getting his shit together decided to do nothing. You have nothing to feel guiltt about. If he ends up homeless its his own fault and its his responsibility to take care of himself. Be strong and hold your head up high. Don't let this guy drag your life down.

What I have found in my lifetime is that people will find a way.  I would bet my life that if he had to find a place to go and other people to manipulate and take advantage of, he can.  This person will literally not die homeless in the streets.  Unless they are so cognitively challenged that this person is not a partner, but someone who needs social services involved.

You are NOT his parent.  If he couldn't even make an effort in the last year to get a job or be responsible, you need to move on.  I hope to GOD he doesn't know where you are moving or he'll show up on your doorstep in a few days saying he has no where to go.

mayidescend,fdhhk1y,t1_fdgxftd,"There was a guy I met on Tinder around 3 years back and we seemed to hit it off extremely well.
He tried to cancel our first date ten minutes prior to it because he couldn’t drive to pick me up from a location of our choosing (what he planned to do, and I agreed).
He couldn’t drive due to not being able to afford a car- okay, reasonable, but unreasonable how he planned to drive and pick me up with no license or car... So I would drive everywhere when we were together, no biggie.

Him and his sister shared an apartment and he was working at a local restaurant a block away from the apartment. After he and I had been dating for about 2 months (nothing official, it was a lot of causal dates and movie nights) he quit his job because he said he didn’t feel like going. I found online applications for him to fill out of jobs I knew he would get based off what he told me his work experiences were, he just had to fill them out and do all the necessary steps after if he got a call back. He told me no, he doesn’t want to work anymore.

a week or two later, I tried to phase out talking to him (shame on me for not confronting the issues directly, but he did know that we weren’t a serious thing or whatever yet), he told me he didn’t have the money for his half of the rent, groceries, and utilities. He asked me to pay it.

When I told him no, he insisted he had to move in with me. I told him no. He called the police and told them I kicked him out of my house in attempts to gain entry and basically become a squatter in my house.

At the time i was living with others that could vouch that he’s never stepped foot in my house.
Everything he and I did was super casual, and I loved how he and I shared the same hobbies, taste in video games and music, and i got along with his friends, and him with mine. Like chemistry wise it seemed perfect, but he was trying to use me as a sugar momma when I don’t even have enough money for myself majority of the time.

We also kissed once (one of those short goodbye style kisses) and he came instantly.

It was a nightmare of a relationship, or whatever it was.

Like 4 months later I met my current boyfriend and changed my relationship status on facebook (something I never did with him, but i did tell him I wasn’t ready for anything serious, I wasn’t with him, though). The tinder dude sent me messages upon messages saying that I’m the reason why hes homeless, has no job, and that he is now suicidal.

Then he asked me for money not even two hours later as compensation for his pain.

I blocked him (something I should’ve done before).

Some people just want to live off of others.


He was also 24 at the time and I was 19 and working full time."

eltibbs,fdioga5,t1_fdgxftd,"My best friend is going through a divorce because her husband has such a bad drinking problem and gets violent. He refuses to get help. They split last year and she got an apartment while he rented a small house. He lost his job last month and didn’t look for other jobs. Then showed up to his work drunk as hell to beg for his job back and had the cops called on him. He had the balls to call her and beg to move into her apartment with her so he wouldn’t be homeless. Nope, not happening. When she refused he told her he hopes she dies a miserable death and called her a selfish bitch. Told her she will never find another guys as good looking as himself.

He doesn’t know of my reddit, but at the time when we did hang out and go out and about occasionally, he talked about reddit quite a bit. I had a different account then but wasn’t crazy about it (obviously has changed now with me cruising it daily or every other day).
He was obsessed. Always on it, discord, or steam.

If he comes across this comment, oh well.
I don’t want to bring more attention to his bad attitude.
Knowing him, as well, he would call himself out on it in the comments. He’s bad at that.

He had an ex girlfriend that told me that when she made tweets about their relation (bad ones or not) he would respond to them. Even when she didn’t have a name and left it anonymous, he would claim ownership.
Its weird.
She came to me after he called the cops, and after I was in an actual relationship with someone else though. I had already blocked him on everything. Apparently he still talked about me. Which was super weird, imo.

I don’t want to fuel his ego anymore, though. He really likes the attention, negative or not."

He’s never been abusive, but he clearly has mental health issues and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he’s suicidal—he seems to be in either extreme denial or has no plan for his life for a reason. It’s not worth chancing how his brain reacts when he finally gets that fight or flight response from facing the impending doom of homelessness. Better safe than sorry.

anonymousforever,fdh2cpm,t1_fdgzk9n,"Look up the landlord tenant laws where they live, maybe find an attorney and see if you can get a free phone consult. Technically most situations like that the mother may legally be considered a month to month tenant even if she don't pay rent, and daughter would have to serve her the appropriate notice to vacate as required by the laws where they live, may be 30 or 60 day notice. After that if she refuses to leave then she'd have to file an eviction in court and after that's awarded the police can make her leave. Realistically it's a several month process, but can be done."
Nurs3Rob,fdh0xa3,t1_fdgzk9n,Depends on the state but in general she'd be considered a tenant and you her landlord. So you'd have to serve her with a notice to vacate (law typically requires 30 days) and then file for eviction if she ignores it. Calling the sheriff will likely do nothing as they'll say it's a civil matter. If you can talk to a lawyer about this. Every jurisdiction has their own laws and this is not the sort of thing you want to fuck up as it can open you up to a lawsuit.
the_almighty_walrus,fdhbg9k,t1_fdgzk9n,Depends on the county. Call sheriff or lawyer.

TheLilacOcean,fdh1khx,t1_fdgzv10,"I had a parent who was a hoarder and honestly the best advice I can give is start with the smallest room you can get to. 
Kit yourself out with a face mask and rubber gloves and aim to do one small section at a time. The amount of crap that can accumulate in the smallest of spaces is baffling but it can help to focus on literally a metre at a time - bin it, scrub the tiny bit of wall or floor and then rinse and repeat. 
Put blinders on to the rest of the house - don’t think about it or acknowledge it - just that one bit you’re working on at a time. 
I had to do it in short bursts - setting timers for regular breaks is good too. 
I also liked having a “keep” tub and a “salvage” tub for the stuff that needs cleaning or repair but will be kept - then only deal with the tubs once they’re full so you don’t get stuck on them. 
The feeling of shame, even by proxy, can be intense but good friends can be surprisingly understanding and help share the burden if you have some around.
Good luck! You will get there."

UnLuckyKenTucky,fdh2hc4,t1_fdgzv10,"Sherwin Williams sells this amazing oil based primer. Its normally used in houses with smoke damage, to seal the singe or scent. It works *wonders* with animal smells. The floors are probably gone, plan on carpet/tile/whatever. Before the new floor goes down, use that primer on the subfloor. The walls, ceiling, floors, all of it will likely need to be bleached and primed over. Good news is it isn't *that* expensive, and covers amazingly well.

We were trained to keep important things, donate usable but unwanted things, and trash the rest. They don't get overwhelmed at the task because that's what they do for a living. It was a single bedroom single bath apartment we cleaned out that was literally stacked floor to ceiling with stuff. The owner had a path from the door to the bedroom to the bathroom. We cleaned out the whole apartment in three days. It might lift a weight off your chest."

There was a small couch in there for her to sleep on. Everything else was completely covered with boxes and boxes full of stuff. Even her bathtub and oven were full of random things. We emptied that apartment in a single weekend because there were so many people helping. My boyfriend asked some of our friends from church for help and a lot of them showed up and spent hours helping her. Even if you are not religious, it might be worth a shot to reach out to a church and ask for help. Some people might be willing to help you with this."

she's gone from the house now, right?  so you can move back in.

but the place is a mess, a HUGE mess.  that's okay, you can deal with it.
you need a place to sleep and a bathroom.  so get a bathroom (toilet and shower) cleaned up and usable (might have to pay for a plumber, or you might have friends who can do basic stuff.  ask)  then maybe you can clear out a bedroom or just enough space in the garage to camp out there while you start working on the rest of the house.  

okay, you've got a place to sleep and a bathroom, and now you've only got the mortgage to pay instead of a mortgage and rent.  so the financial pressure should ease somewhat.  

then pick a room or a problem.  you got mice?  google and find out how to best deal with them.  or clean out the kitchen and fridge.

Mishishi_Kiseki,fdgs1fi,t3_elam6b,"I had the same situation but it was my ex girlfriend. Her family kicked her out of her house because they had more kids (6) and there was no room left for her. She failed all her classes in college and they kicked her out. She had a part time job a couple hours a week. No money and nowhere to stay.

I begged her to get another job or go back to school but she refused both because any job that was hiring was “beneath” her and it “wasn’t her fault” she got kicked out of school. She believed all the teachers purposefully gave her bad grades because they didn’t like her and the admin office lost all her personal info.

I tried many times to kick her out as it was me who was on the lease and all the furniture was mine. But she’s cry and beg me not to make her homeless. 

She stayed home all day and just watched TV and read vampire novels while I was working full time, then came home to cook and do the chores. Then she’d complain when I played games for 1 or 2 hours.

I finally got a job out of the country. I told her she had half a year to find a new place and a job. She didn’t. I sold all my stuff and left the apartment. 

While I was driving off, she was standing outside the building with nothing but a suitcase of her clothes.

puss_parkerswidow,fdgujro,t3_elam6b,"I have to evict people from storage all the freaking time, and many of them are homeless and were looking at storage they couldn't pay for as some sort of lifeline and a charity. It's neither- it's more of a useful tool if it fits your budget, a necessary evil if you have to move suddenly, but a 10k lb anchor if you can't afford it and are viewing it as a lifeline to holding on to things. It's also a multi-billion dollar industry that is growing all the time. It's not a charity, and I'm not a caseworker.

Many of the people I evict do have mental health issues, addiction, and almost all of them have managed to reach the limits of their own family's and friend's patience and tolerance. A lot of the time, I am evicting them because they can't/won't follow a very simple set of rules involving : do not try to sleep here, and do be out by the time the gate closes; don't bother other people; and don't smoke anything in the buildings. They do all of that, get caught quickly, and then cry big huge tears and call me names because I'm so goddamned mean to them for expecting them to follow the same rules as everyone else.

If I feel sorry for one of them and let some shitty behavior slide, they will absolutely take advantage of me and do something shittier. It happens every single time I feel sorry for someone.

I wish I could offer them real help, but they don't want it. I hand out a referral sheet with resources, and almost no one will take it. There's always an excuse for why this or that doesn't work, but me giving them free stuff and letting them shit all over everyone is what they want. They don't want a job like the one I have. They don't want the responsibilities I have. They just want to take what's given to them and ask for even more. 

It makes me sad, and I have one right now that's dragging it out and making it so horrible. She will likely die in less than a year if she does not seek actual help and get her own shit together. I could literally give her a house, a car, and money-or bring her into my home and she would destroy it all within a few months.

Whatever you do, DO NOT allow him into your new home, not even ""just for one night."" I guarantee it will not be just for one night. He will refuse to leave, and you may have to spend a lot of time and money in court to get him out.

Why? Because it may be his place of residence as much as yours. Even if his name is not on the lease.

You may need to evict him, even after your lease is ended. And until that happens, you may be legally accountable for the rent and utilities (because your leasing company can't rent to someone else).  

Reasons to worry. 

1. He's lived there more than 30 days. 
2. He may have mail delivered there. 
3. He likely has his possessions there. 
4. He isn't paying anything for rent so he has no financial loss to just stay. 
5. YOU let him live there. 
6. If his name is not on the lease, you likely violated your lease agreement. 
7. If it is, even if he's not primary on the lease, you can be held financially accountable till he leaves. 

Check with your local laws. I would caution against talking to the leasing company as you might already be accountable.

You will always be his nanny, even if you made the mistake of getting back together with him.

He needs to live on the streets, I can't pretend I know him but I've known people like this and a harsh reality call is what he needs or he will never be able to do anything for himself. If you still feel guilty, think of it as tough love. He needs to understand the situation he's gotten himself into and learn from it. With people like that, there's no other way."

Canigohomenow2,fdhbe6u,t3_elam6b,"Unfortunately, he has made plans.  He plans to take advantage of your kindness and compassion, and he expects to move with you.

Why would you get your shit together if your lifestyle is paid for?"

There is nothing more to be said than this. There are some decisions in life that do not offer a happy ending it's one shitty choice over another. You have gone above and beyond what any girlfriend/friend would do.

Some people can't unfuck their lives and there's not a single thing you can do about it. A drowning man will take you under with them wether they mean to or not."

Finally gave him a solid deadline but he still did nothing to get his shit together. The night before the deadline he asked ""you weren't serious were you?!?"". He spent ONE night in his car then got a job and an apartment. Sometimes a little motivation is all that is needed. We are still friends btw."
likeaMFfromhell,fdhb4cy,t3_elam6b,"He won’t be living on the streets.

I'm not a professional or anything, but that's my 2 cents. Go be happy."

Don’t give in; he is expecting it.

He is using you.

He will continue to use you until you stop enabling him.

Whatever you do, don’t give him your new address.

You won’t be able to say no if he shows up in the cold, in the rain, begging for help. But he is not your responsibility.

He is 37 years old. It’s time he becomes responsible for his own life.

With 5 days until he had no where to stay and talks of suicide, I helped my ex (with bad credit and no job) find a place to sublease through a Facebook group for housing/roommates in my city. He moved in within 3 days after selling his gold on Runescape to afford it. 🙄

I suggest yours does something similar after he’s living under a bridge for a few weeks and decides to human up and get a job so he can afford a place to live.

Please stay strong and feel free to shoot me a message if you need to talk with someone who knows what you’re going through. ❤️

Hrynkat,fdh3y64,t3_elam6b,"I once had an ex who never paid rent or bills, and just sat around doing nothing but keeping his paychecks to himself to buy more guns and guitars and scream at me. I told him to leave, gave him TWO MONTHS, and he didn't do anything. I had to live at a friend's place to get proper sleep, and had to relocate my cat since his cat abused her. The week before he still hadn't found a place so I had to call his mom to get him out of there. Gave her a big fat bill of what he owes me and proof of how he talks to me. He was out a day later. 

It's not your fault, your responsibility, or your job to worry about him. You sound like a good caring person so it makes sense you worry, and is natural. Accept that feeling of kindness, but apply it to other people who deserve it. You have to show yourself the same kindness and get yourself out of there. You've done what you could by giving him time to get his crap together and he didn't. It's on him, and him only. You just can't convince other people to be better, and it causes too much stress to try. 

My most recent ex paid half of his bills, and yelled at me for asking him to pay me in full. He wouldn't get another job to afford his living, and just sat there complaining about his job (that he never showed up to on time, that paid him very well). I broke up with him, ended the lease, he got fired for his attitude, and his life was in shambles. Now he's found a place, has 3 jobs, and found new friends. He did it all by himself after I kicked him to the curb. Your ex will do the same."

ishyash,fdh4vqy,t3_elam6b,"OP, I was in a very similar situation. Broke up with my bf of 5 years after some issues that we just couldn’t work out. He moved out for a month and then came back because he messed up the new living situation he was in (I always felt he did it on purpose so he could come back). My bleeding heart took him in, but made it clear he wasn’t staying for long. A week later and I had to kick him out. I was on the road to healing and it wasn’t helping either of us to keep going the way we were. 
He at least had a car to sleep in, but it still broke my heart. 
Just remember that you’re responsible for you. He has a head on his shoulders and you did all you could, probably even more. Stay strong."

psmdigital,fdh7dky,t3_elam6b,"If you are truly concerned about him, point him to the right direction of social services. Depending on where you live, there are places that will give him a place to stay, food to eat, mental health services, and help with job placement. It will be up to him to follow through. You cannot carry someone through out their whole life."
Weaponxreject,fdha0lg,t3_elam6b,"I've been in a similar position as your boyfriend before. Had moved in with my girlfriend at the time (together less than 6 months but she was getting me out of a real shitty spot). Hour away from where I was, 3 months looking for a job, no car, no savings, struggling with staying sober, and had just lost my brother to an overdose. 

I royally fucked things up further; she ended our relationship but offered to let me stay with her until I could get back on my feet. Instead I moved back in with my family vs. going homeless or staying with her. 

Stand your ground and commit to the decision and offer you made. It's on him to figure his shit out, not you. You're his ex, not his mother. Tbh you did more than you even should have letting him stay under your roof as long as you have."

ewokalpyse,fdioph9,t3_elam6b,"**You're his Ex - not his Mother. For the love of everything - don't even let him know where you move to.**

You owe him absolutely nothing. He's an adult and this hasn't just fallen out of the sky on him. He's had plenty of warning. If he was ever going to get his arse into gear, he would've done so last year. He hasn't. He's made his choice - banking on you being a softy and caving in to continue being his Mummy. He's also banking on the fact that it's very awkward for you to go out and find yourself a new partner, so one day you'll cave in on that respect and you guys end up back together again. If you cave in on this ultimatum you've given him (""you're not moving with me to the new place""), you are lost. If you let him in the front door of your new place you are lost. You'll never ever get rid of that millstone around your neck. You cave on this, even slightly, he'll know for certain that you will cave on anything eventually. And you'll have that sponge living in your space forever. You've given him enough of your life. He's trailer trash, or sleeping under a bridge. Because that's the choice he made. You didn't/aren't forcing him to sleep rough. His choice. He's emotionally blackmailing you into being his Mother. Don't accept it.

And you know what? There's a very good chance that once he realises this gravy train is over, he'll latch onto the next poor young lady that crosses his path and worms his way into mooching off her."

He probably needs the harsh reality of being homeless to get his shit together.

It's time to look after yourself now, it is the kindest thing you can do for both of you. You may feel bad short term, but the long term benefits will be worth it. It may also give him the motivation he needs to actually live his own life.

I hope it all works out for you, you sound like a very selfless person, but enough is enough. Put him out of both of your miseries. Good luck ❤"

She crashed on peoples couches, rented rooms in the worst parts of town, I heard she was homeless. But this was on her and not me.

This guy seems to have been entirely dependent on every person he's been with regardless if it was family, friends or ex lovers. He feels no shame and in my mind he's a loser and a failure as an adult. We all need help even as Adults but he has taken this to a whole other level. He could easily work at any restaurant, any gas station, any retail or grocery store, a call center or even do landscaping like trimming grass and bushes in a company. There are soooo many kinds of jobs out there, not all pay well but a job is better than no job. But he has no ambition and no sense of independence. The sooner you cut ties the better. You will hate your life and regret ever meeting him if you keep in contact. He will have the options of getting a job right away when he is kicked out which he might blow up your phone or worst case stalk you, he might find a new victim or just give up and act like the world is out to get him and just be homeless without trying. I've known people who have lived out of their cars for a year or so until they had enough to rent a place and even my sisters Ex was living in a hotel for months while he worked but he is a terrible man and got her to pay for his new place and take him to and from work and even cosign on a car loan, he was a leech too just not to the extent of not working. 

Please dont let this man ruin your life anymore. Karma is coming to him and its gonna come hard but it will come to you as well and might bring you the one true thing that your life needs, if he's out of your life.

Not only would I move without him, I’d move into the new place as soon as possible. I wouldn’t tell him, I’d just start moving things as soon as I could. Basically avoid the “big moving day” when he’s definitely planning to try to guilt you into letting him come to your new place. I’d also spend as little time at home as possible until I moved. Create distance ASAP. Good luck!"
drfulci,fdhr2gj,t3_elam6b,"I had an ex like this.  After we broke up we saw out two year leases.  He deteriorated quickly after losing his job.  He told me he wasn’t going with me to my new place when I moved.  Said he had it taken care of.  He didn’t need me.  

Guess who decided to walk off & run when it came time to go with his ride to his new situation?  The day he was to leave he had all his stuff ready.  He was almost gone.  Then he started a fight with the guy giving him a ride & took off, leaving all his stuff in the lobby of my apartment building.  

Sp I had his friend pack it up as if that was still the plan & let him take it to his new situation.  Not long after that he popped up & acted like he didn’t need help.  So I went with it.  I knew he was homeless.  But he’d done nothing to prevent it & everything to place himself in a position where I’d feel guilty & offer.  I didn’t & I felt like shit for weeks.  Couldn’t reach him.  Thought he was dead.  

Turned out he’d gotten a car.  Found a couch to stay on & made some money in that time.  But I had felt so bad when he asked for a night I said yes.  About 10 months later that night finally ended.  I got an efficiency & told him I didn’t have room.  

It’s true.   You will end up helping him til you can’t anymore.  He’s had time.  There are shelters & public assistance he can qualify for.  He’s counting on you feeling guilty.  He won’t plan or find a way for himself until he has to.   Not “you need to”.  Streets or work has to.  

Don’t give in.  Stay strong."
Popular-Uprising-,fdhshpi,t3_elam6b,"You're not guilty, you gave him time, you gave him a date, and I'm sure you've reminded him at least once. It's his responsibility to make arrangements on his own. Some people just like to ignore problems and hope they'll go away. 

Stay strong and stick to your timeline. However, it's a good idea to have someone you trust with you when you do it. People can get very angry when they're backed against a wall. 

I cut off my ex financially in much the same way and she hasn't spoken to me since. That was 5 months ago."
NathanDST,fdhss28,t3_elam6b,"When in my twenties I was the roommate who knew the lease was coming to an end and did nothing to get a job or make arrangements. I wound up sleeping on the streets, trying to find a place the cops wouldn't kick me out of.

It was a real low point, and exactly the kick to the ass I needed. I hated it, and started really working on getting my act together because I didn't want to live on the street anymore. My former roommate kicking me to the curb was the RIGHT DECISION. 

Let your ex face the consequences of his inaction. It may just be what he needs. He may improve as a result. Might not, but that's his choice. He is not your responsibility, and his inaction is not your fault."
FecalToot,fdht69t,t3_elam6b,"He'll find somebody else to leech off. He'll probably end up couchsurfing for a while until he realizes he's a grown ass man and needs to get his shit together.

You've been more than accomadating and have given him more than enough time to sort things out by getting a job and saving money for rent at a new place... which he didn't do. 

As guilty as you may feel, any repercussions are directly caused by his own actions and you aren't responsible for that."
UPCBRO1,fdhv48z,t3_elam6b,"I’m in the same position OP. I split with my ex (33) and she moved out and got her own place and continued working.  She lost it all within 6 months and was considered homeless. I stayed friends with her ( no physical relationship or anything). I allowed her come stay with me until she got on her feet again, as she was always good to me. It’s 4 months later and nothing has changed. She only has a mother who lives out of state, who doesn’t help.

I’m done paying for everything as well. I was dumb to let her come back and stay here and become my problem. I gave her until next Saturday to find a place to go and she’s not made any arrangements. She takes my explanations of why she has to go as threats. It kills me that she will be homeless but im done dealing with all this. I’ve done enough and been too nice."

tarakiller22,fdi7hn3,t3_elam6b,"Holy shit.. so I met a guy in Sept. We had a nice date, I ended up bringing him home. Little did I know I was literally 'bringing him home'. He came back to 'see me' the next day, and stayed again. And then again... and then didn't leave. Mind you he told me he was renting a room in the city, and had a job as a bar back. I finally got out of him that he had been sleeping in the woods prior to our meeting, and that he had been fired the day before we met. Well, this turns into almost 3 months of him ""looking for work"" on craigslist via the gigs section. He didn't want to work a normal job with normal hours. Oh, did I mention he was waiting for a lawyer to win a case against Lyft? He had been in an accident a couple months prior and thought he'd be getting some huge payout from the case. He didn't want to work a regular job, cuz it could be traced and they'd see he wasn't hurt enough to not work. Insert eye roll. I was so unhappy and had no idea how to deal with this master manipulator narcissist. I also felt bad he would be homeless if we broke up. He worked two one day jobs while we were together. The rest of the time was spent laying in my bed watching tv all night and all day while I worked, and sleeping the rest of the time. I finally mustered up the balls to say something when he started another fight with me, and threatened to leave. I told him I had been acting so 'mean' recently because I was unhappy. I didn't want to be with him any more. He left that night, and went to his foster dads. (his childhood was a wreck, not surprised it produced such a piece of work). A week later, he's back out on the streets, begging me for money, begging me to let him come spend 'one night'. He checked himself into a psych ward, then the hospital because he had gotten frost bite on his toes while being drunk outside the night he called crying and begging. Did I feel bad? Yes. Was his lack of any effort MY fault? Not at all. Nor yours. You have to get past that guilty feeling. He's a full grown adult. This is NOT YOUR PROBLEM. Do NOT give him a key, do not let him into your new apartment. Tell him he has to go, and recruit a friend or two for back up if you have to. Be strong! He'll figure it out. Mine already is leaching off someone new (I'm pretty sure). I blocked his number and told him to email me when he's getting the last of his shit out of my apt. He's got til the end of January, then he really isn't my problem anymore! GOOD LUCK!"

I'm sorry you're going through this, I'm with you... it's hard. He will find a way to survive, they always do. You need to get on with your life, and let him live his.

sdsurunner07,fdisjcl,t3_elam6b,"Don’t feel bad for taking care of yourself. 


Don’t light yourself on fire to keep him warm. You gave him a timeline, something most people don’t get. There are shelters in place. There are resources he could go to and friends I’m sure that he could couch surf with. He probably doesn’t think that you’re serious in leaving him.  He will call you so many things or start crying and whining about how you didn’t give him enough time. 

Is he home all the time? Is there some way you can get all packed up when he’s gone somewhere? Do you have any friends that can help move you out? That way you’re not alone and you have a witness in case something happens?"
Double_Minimum,fdisp73,t3_elam6b,"Ok, so I have been in a somewhat similiar situation.

There may be a reason he is like this, but thats not important.  What you need to do, or I suggest doing, is not only remind him that this is happening, but that there is no better time than now to start planning for it.  I know that sounds like some BS self-help, but hear me out.

Once he is on the street, where will he get internet? Where will he charge his phone/computer if he has one? Where will he store extra clothes (you cannot carry but maybe 1.5 extra outfits, and none of that works for any interviews.  Where will he use a printer? Where will he sleep? Eat? Does he have medicaid yet? How will he get there to sign up?

I mean, this sounds obvious, but once you are on your own, and on the street, even simple things become a million times harder.  He can lounge on the couch, watch TV, but still complete one of these items/plans/decisions per day, using 1 hour of his time, and it will save him weeks of living on the streets.  Literally, 1 hour of planning can save a week of figuring out shit once all those normal 'home' things vanish.

I understand he may not listen, but its still worth it to pass on the message.  

And as far as an moral qualms about what is going on, not sure I can help you, or that you can help him.  Some tough times might change things for him, and if not, maybe then you help him by finding a shelter.  But the more he prepares from the comfort of your home, the better off he will be.  Like the difference between making it and not.  Basic stuff becomes almost impossible, especially if you are already lazy/depressed."

He said things about having depression which made it harder for me to just stop supporting him. It took almost 4 years before I said fuck it and finally moved out (far away lol) and even then I still sent him rent money for a little while because I felt guilty about just leaving him on his own like that and had fear he would become homeless otherwise. 

I told him I’m done sending money for good at the end of last year and actually followed through with it. Thought there would be complications and struggles.

Nope. He found a job immediately and is doing fine. My bro is like my best friend but damn if that didn’t cause some resentment. But whatever, he’s good now.

I think to some people it's like a game and to others, it's just that they don't want to plan even if it does mean sometimes being homeless.  They'll leech as long as the target will let them.  Then they'll find someone else to leech off of when they have to.  And they know they're being like this.  They consider the pleading and lectures part of the deal.

kerrys_chairs,fdgzbwf,t3_elam6b,"OP, it is not your fault that he would be homeless. He has had all this time to research resources, look for work, and build a plan. HE CHOSE NOT TO, and that is not your fault. You can't - and shouldn't - protect him from his own bad decisions. 

He is in this position because he chose to be. He can be an adult and find resources to help himself stay afloat, but he doesn't want to.

Read that repeatedly until it starts sinking in.

What he does or doesn't do is not on your shoulders.  You gave him ample opportunity to help himself and he chose instead to whittle it away uselessly.  

You feel guilty because you have a kind and loving heart.  But you're also not his mother.  You're not even in a relationship with him any longer.  You owe him nothing.  Everything that you've given him post-breakup has been out of the goodness of your heart.  It's commendable, but you are not beholden to his future.  

Move on.  Give yourself the freedom you need.  Give yourself self-care.  Letting him continue to cling to your coattails will do neither of you any favors, and only bring you both down in the long run.

&#x200B;

My best friend went through this exact situation with her brother. He was 'in college' and ""couldn't help pay rent because he was a student"", he did this for 3 years, and on the 4th year, when everyone began asking about his graduation, he broke down and told us all that he had dropped out of college and has basically been a NEET this entire time, and he lied to ""get everyone off his back about school"". He didn't bother to get a job and when she met her boyfriend and they wanted to move in together, she gave him a 6-month notice to find a new place to stay because she wasn't going to renew the lease.

&#x200B;

He did the SAME shit you did, and when the ""move out day"" approached, he didn't move his shit out, he basically tried to squat there. The apartment's landlord reps called the Sherrif, and he came and showed her brother out. He didn't bother to move his furniture or clothes out and my best friend was sued for $1,500 in damages to the property and having to repaint and move her brother's shit. Her brother then blocked her on everything for failing to enable his NEET lifestyle and for failing to be responsible for his life. He then called their father, who was told by his wife that this boy couldn't move back in because he was almost 30 and unemployed, and the wife knew about his sister paying for everything for years and him being a deadbeat. This was 10 years ago. He tried to leech off of family and friends and basically burned every bridge he crossed because he'd manipulate sympathetic, kind people into ""helping him"" for as long as he could, and then treat them like garbage and block them once they put their foot down and asked him to be responsible for his own life. He was forced to get a job after he burned his last bridge and got a reputation for being a leech who used people.

&#x200B;

Look, OP. 10 years from now, you and your ex will not be on speaking terms. He won't even bother to treat you with dignity or respect and he WILL resent you for failing to pay for his life. YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM. If you're going to end up blocked on every platform, be blocked on every platform with your money that you didn't waste on helping him all these years. My best friend wishes she could go back and never ever agree to help her brother out to begin with. She says it's her single greatest regret of her 20s. That she wasted over $8,000 basically being a single mother to a grown ass man who treated her like garbage and blocked her on every platform in the end. If you're going to be treated like shit and blocked on every platform, at LEAST don't lose money doing it :/

&#x200B;

if you feel guilty, take steps to contact his parents and let them know that he's 10 days away from being homeless, and when moving day comes, and he tries to guilt you into being his mother and bangmaid, then you can tell him that you went as far as contacting his parents to make sure someone knew he'd need help. Leave it at that. DO NOT GIVE HIM MONEY. DO NOT TELL HIM WHERE YOU'RE MOVING. DO NOT ENGAGE OR ACKNOWLEDGE HIS MANIPULATION ATTEMPTS!

&#x200B;

Leave and block him on everything. You might be sad and cry nonstop for a few weeks but then your life will improve."

Choleycupcake,fdhps8e,t3_elam6b,Do not let him come with you. Hes using you. Its incredibly easy to find a min wage job.
DreaminginCali,fdhq277,t3_elam6b,"Girl stick to your plan!! I was in the exact place about 4 years ago. My ex and I were together for 3 years and I was convinced I was his only support system. He couldn’t keep a job, was horrible to his mom and called his dad his sperm donor. He threatened suicide multiple times and I knew I would be making him homeless. I went back and forth for that last year of our relationship because I felt like I was such a horrible person leaving another human like that. But you know what? HE was driving me into the ground emotionally, financially, socially, literally in every area of my life. And none of my support was really helping him. 
I signed a new lease for myself and never looked back. I’m in a much better place and really so his he. He was only homeless for a short while and it made him get his ass into gear. He now lives abroad and is on medication I believe for his mental illnesses. 
You do need to go to therapy though. It’s hard but you’ll thank yourself for it. You can’t save him. You can save yourself."
baskarcoyote,fdhq2q6,t3_elam6b,"He dug his own grave so let him lay in it. I know that sounds tough but he is just using you, don't let him. He is a grown ass man and can get his shit together all on his own if he really wants to.

You gotta look out for yourself first."
AltRye,fdhqq56,t3_elam6b,Does he spend all his time posting in r/politics?

HerbalDreamin1,fdhtbqp,t3_elam6b,Does he have no family?
DrummerDooter,fdhtps3,t3_elam6b,"Stand up for yourself, no matter what. If you truly don't want to be with him, definitely don't forget who you are. I hope that you're able to stand up to him. You are making an incredibly brave decision doing so - I would be intimidated as hell, and I can totally see how you'd feel guilted. However, he had plenty of notice, he's no longer your responsibility, and it's time for you to cut your losses. Do yourself a favor and move on from it. You will thank yourself later. He has options. It's not up to you to recognize that."
Edmond-the-Great,fdhu0o8,t3_elam6b,"Nothing builds character like necessity. If there is no one to carry him, he will do whatever is necessary to survive. Get a job or maybe go to jail?"

bonnielisbon,fdhuscs,t3_elam6b,"I had something similar happen. No job, no motivation, lost his car to a dui, leeched off me for everything.  I felt like a mom. He now has a job, his license, and a roof over his head. We’re actually friends now.

Don’t let him guilt you. He’ll be okay. Kick him out of the nest, and he WILL figure something out. He’s 37, time to wake up."
NyxZeta,fdhuv3n,t3_elam6b,Stay strong! Kicking him to the curb is going to be good for him. He’s not going to see it that way but he either is going to sink or (finally) start swimming.
spooktober36s,fdhv1wr,t3_elam6b,"I was in the same situation a few years ago. Broke up with my boyfriend who was living with me, gave him 2 months to find a new place. He found a new place and then got the girl he was living with pregnant. He's a grown man, it's not your job to make sure he has a home. He's a leech, I've dated a few guys just like him, unfortunately he'll find another girl to do this to. Cut your losses, you sound like a very kind hearted person but he will just suck you dry and move on to the next. Best of luck!"
altusvires,fdhvn60,t3_elam6b,"He’s a grown man, he can make it on his own. You gave him plenty of time to figure something out, and he didn’t. Don’t beat yourself up, you’re not responsible for his well-being!"
Smokey_Cat_,fdhvnfr,t3_elam6b,"You're doing him a favor by kicking him out. Some people, myself included, need to be left with no other option than to be homeless before they realize that they need to change. Being temporarily homeless, due to my own actions, led me to make better choices in the future. At 37 he should know better though, and you've been more than accommodating by the sound of it."
Epiphone_SquierSUCKS,fdhw5yl,t3_elam6b,He'll figure it out. Move on with your life

raptor_club,fdhxjkh,t3_elam6b,in aeroplanes they tell you to put your oxygen mask on before helping anyone else. you need to look after yourself before you help him. he should be able to put his own oxygen mask on without you he shouldn’t need your help.
Jsmoove47,fdhxu99,t3_elam6b,"I stopped feeling bad for him right after you mentioned he’s 37 with no job,

He’s a grown ass man and needs to make decisions to join the rest of us in a society but decided to sit at his ex-gf’s home and do nothing instead, 

Dump him and get away from him as far as you can."
splotch210,fdhxux1,t3_elam6b,"It sounds as if there's possibly some issues with depression. Still not your problem. You've gone above and beyond to make the transition smooth for him and he's done nothing in preparation for this or for his life in general. Your conscience should be clean. It's ok to feel bad, you're human. It's time to move on without the anchor. Good luck and be safe. (A man without anything to lose has potential to be a dangerous one.)"
jsm1031,fdhywsq,t3_elam6b,"It’s killing you, but it’s clearly not killing him. That is fundamentally the problem - you are making it your problem but he isn’t making it his. As long as SOMEONE is willing to solve it, why should he?
DTMFA. You will both be better off a year (or two) from now."
SisterNaomi,fdhzglu,t3_elam6b,"So you can live with the temporary discomfort of him not having anywhere to live, or the long-term discomfort of taking care of him.  

I say temporary because I think you will be shocked at how quickly he finds someone else to take care of him."
ifyouseekay789,fdhzum2,t3_elam6b,This is no longer your problem. You have been very kind to him. This is now his problem. Trust yourself that you have gone above and beyond for him. Now do what is best for you!
Bancroft-79,fdi02tr,t3_elam6b,"Unless he is mentally or physically disabled, which he then can qualify to live in a home, he can find a job. There is no reason why a grown man in his 30s can’t wash dishes, hang dry wall, mow lawns, or bus tables. There is plenty of work out there. Tell him to get a job. Kicking him to the streets may be the best thing for him. There is most likely a reason he has no friends or family."
lastherokiller,fdi0d46,t3_elam6b,They have alot of programs and help for people drop him at a shelter and wash your hands.
Cloud809,fdi0edw,t3_elam6b,"I have personal experience with this, my father lived off my mother for decades and didn't work. He didn't have a disability or anything just made a bunch of excuses about how hard jobs are to find, I even wanted him gone...but my mother was worried about him not being able to survive on the streets..even though they were officially broken up since I was 5.

I also had this experience with my ex wife, she refused to leave, pay the mortgage and didn't want work at all. I ended up leaving after the house was in shambles (She had dogs that she let do whatever) and letting the bank foreclose on the house. She became homeless after the sheriff kicked her out after foreclosure and showed up at my new place for a place to sleep. I turned her ass down quick.

If you take him with you, that will just make it harder to get rid of him. Also keep in mind he will be a ""tenant"" according to some State laws and will have rights. That means you would not be able to put him on the streets the next day and will have to go through the courts.

Leave his ass on the street and don't enable him. He had almost a year,  people like him will use you until either your dead or find another gravy train to hitch a ride on. Don't give him your address and don't try to contact him. Being homeless is what he needs to wake up, or not either way he isn't your problem."

ARandomPancake,enirzo,top_level,"I, like a lot of people drive my car to work every day. On my drive I listen to the radio. It angers me to no end when an ad on the radio uses a sudden, loud, horn/alarm/siren to get your attention. It is distracting, startling, and unsafe overall. I can be just chilling at a red light and the sudden loud noise that’s several times the volume of anything else will startle the heck out of me.  I’m sure it could (if it hasn’t already) cause an accident by startling a driver and causing them to jerk the wheel. 

Sounds shouldn’t cause people to jerk, but they do. Having something like that just to get someone’s attention is in poor taste and unsafe. Yes people shouldn’t jerk the wheel because of a loud sound, but you know it happens."
cammie277,fe08w0u,t3_enirzo,Agreed. I hate it when I hear those type of commercials.
VaginaYEASTwithTEETH,fe1pz91,t1_fe08w0u,"Not a lawyer but can those companies ever be sued for negligence in the civil court, or prosecuted in the criminal court if causation can be linked between a car accident and their ad?  E.g. dashcam shows the driver react to the horn from the ad, causing the accident. The answer is probably ""depending on the State"", etc. Not even a federal offence?"
blackwater_baby,fe245hl,t1_fe08w0u,I posted this same thing the other day in r/self! I’m glad other people feel the same way. I have bad anxiety when driving already so the siren effects really goof me up (I actually had a nightmare last night that a police car was coming and I couldn’t get out of the way / couldn’t figure out where it was coming from and I crashed.)
MikeNotBrick,fe26yb1,t1_fe1pz91,"Well I'm not lawyer either, but in civil court, I was under the impression that you can sue for anything, as long as it's all least $20 (I think). So if you can find a lawyer who would fight this case for you, yeah you could sue. Whether you'd win or not is a different story."
SucceedingYouFather,fe2htds,t1_fe1pz91,"All common law claims such as negligence are state law matters. Congress could probably make a law creating a private right of action about this, but since they haven't, there's likely no federal law issue here. 

A negligence claim may succeed if you can prove that the broadcast or song was unreasonably dangerous, and this danger caused your accident. So it boils down to whether a song that includes the sound of sirens or horns is unreasonably dangerous. That question is ultimately one for the jury."

Naniferry,fe2majm,t1_fe26yb1,"Laws still govern civil court, either contract law or tort law."
punchjackal,fe4l6m4,t1_fe46yln,"I know exactly what you mean. I'm a good driver, like I know the laws and I know what I'm doing and all that good stuff but the anxiety gets so bad that I black out behind the wheel. It's really dangerous. It seems like almost no one save for others with the anxiety understand it. They're like, ""just drive around parking lots for a while"" but I got past that point almost a decade ago. It's not for lack of knowing how, and you can't medicate it or you'll be impaired.

Just chiming in because it's always a relief to see other people who ""get it"". Hoping it gets better for all of us."
blackwater_baby,fe4on7c,t1_fe46yln,I totally understand; I didn’t drive until I was 21 and even then I only did it when necessary—I avoid taking different routes and get completely thrown off if there is construction or any kind of rerouting...

MikeNotBrick,fe2ro3t,t1_fe2majm,Could you eli5 that for me? What is a contract/tort law?
aliie627,fe4rayo,t1_fe4l6m4,"Yes you get it :) which is awesome but sucks at the same time since you are experiencing it too lol.   Some people are just too casual about driving in my opinion. Its so rare to have people just take my word that I will kill people if I drive. I mean half of reddit wants all old people to retake driving tests and not have licences if they are showing cognitive decline. But when I as a 33 year old say it they wanna suggest all these things that I can do and think its soo crazy that I prefer walking ,buses and cabs. Its so odd even though I think its all coming from a good place and they mean well. 

I got myself a cart for groceries and its been such a lifesaver. Even though the other day I was called grandma here on reddit lol. When someone asked for a picture.

halcyon_h,fe6o9d2,t1_fe4l6m4,"Oh I get it as well. I always had anxiety getting behind the wheel. Then, after being a passenger in 4 accidents in 3 years, well, that only made things worse. Even having to ride in a car became an absolute nightmare for me.

I live in an area with lots of different transportation options and it's helped. I mean, I was to the point where this was affecting my life. So, while I'm not one of those ""if you don't like it, just move"" barkers, in my case, it did help."
aliie627,fe4xasu,t1_fe4on7c,"Exactly then I get people who still wanna encourage me to drive. Like wtf I'm panicking in the passenger seat and holding on for dear life. They still think me driving is gonna go well. People just take driving way to lightly.  Dont even get me started on cross walks and stop signs where people never look up from their phones, left or right for cars or people. Then I get honked(cussed at too) at when I refuse to cross unless the person acknowledges me to cross. I could go on for an hour about the crosswalk near my house haha. 

Goodluck to you and be safe out there. Your anxiety is pretty reasonable imo lol"
octopushotdog,fe3vuc3,t1_fe2ro3t,"Criminal law is when you commit a crime, like punching a dude. That's when you get the judge and jury.

Tort law deals with things that are not criminal in the same way or in a lesser way or are not necessarily prosecutable by a criminal court (but could be). Some guy trespasses onto your property, negligence that results in harm, etc. It's hard (for me) to explain this well very simplistically because some stuff can be criminal but not prosecuted, yet still pursued in civil court. For example, in a lot of cases your doctor might not get arrested for malpractice but you can still sue them because their actions caused harm.

Say your neighbor cuts down a tree that's half on your property. Not necessarily something that the cops will get involved with but you can sue your neighbor for a couple things like the value of the tree, property value diminuation, etc.

You can also sue someone civilly for other things alongside a criminal case. Say someone shot you. Yeah you may be entitled to some kind of reparations but you can also sue for medical bills, lost wages, etc.

Say you have a contract with someone. Maybe you're a landlord and your tenants didn't pay. They are violating the law but it's not something they will be arrested for. You sue them in civil court and they are removed and owe you money. Unless there is violence or whatever, they're not going to jail, even though what they did was illegal. They caused you harm so you get to ask the court to rectify the situation. That's probabky the best way to put it."
iamriptide,fe4o2sc,t1_fe2ro3t,"Sure. The law encompasses many different areas. For the sake of simplicity we can divide them into two categories—civil and criminal. Criminal law involves when someone commits a wrong against society. Civil law encompasses the law for wrongs or disagreements between individuals. 

Torts are for things assault, battery, negligence. If you slip and fall on peepee in the Costco, you can sue for your injury. So, personal injury cases are torts. But, it doesn’t have to be a physical injury. 

Contracts law is the law that governs what happens when parties make a contract and no longer agree to the terms of the contract."
punchjackal,fe50465,t1_fe4rayo,"Hell yeah! Walking, taking the bus is such a good feeling. It might be slower than driving but it lets you really appreciate your surroundings. Love the cart. I've considered getting one myself. :)"

No, being self aware does not make it better, it makes it worse. I mute that shit so fast. Literally that ad got me in the habit of just muting as soon as an ad goes on. I have it playing through Android auto and I mute using the steering wheel control. It's literally an inch from my thumb. My reaction time is about one second."
Pretty_Soldier,fe3s94l,t1_fe0acn3,"Ads in general are so fucking obnoxious. I use an ad blocker, I don’t watch tv/cable, and my husband and I support the content creators we watch as well as paying for iTunes, so I almost never hear or see ads. On the rare occasion I do, they come off as so surreal, and so fucked up— it’s like something you’d see in an 80s dystopian movie (“I’d buy that for a dollar!”) but these are just everyday ads. They’re for like, windex or something. 

Being away from them for so long took the goggles off."
throwaway56435413185,fe26dd6,t1_fe0acn3,"This is because they track things like ad effectiveness, to determine additional sales generated by the ads - but they never track ad ineffectiveness, the amount of sales lost because you pissed people off with your ads. 

I can understand why marketing departments don't do it. It would be difficult, expensive and only tell you things you don't want to know lol - ""Our new marketing campaign resulted in 10% more foot traffic and 5% more sales. It *should* have been at least double that, because we actually have a valuable product, but we pissed off 40% of all people with our irritating advertising campaign."" Oops.

broadcast radio is the same song-set over and over all day. if you're on the road enough you get so you start getting super tired of the lack of variety in the stations' playlists. Yeah, I know it's because they're paid to promote those songs that month, but daaaammnnn....they get old fast! 

I'm doing a super-cheap trial of sirius xm... I am thinking that won't last either, but at least they have minimal commercials, especially compared to regular radio!"
awesomeisbubbles,fe20f4d,t1_fe0il2d,"I don’t know if spotify still does this, but it used to be that if you were listening to music and an ad came on and you turned down the volume dramatically, it would pause. You couldn’t mute the ads even just using the volume on the computer. They would automatically play again if you turned it back up so it was very clearly designed to force you to listen to them."

Babaluba2,fe0q23b,t1_fe0ejnr,"Yeah, to a company all that matters is that you remember the name because if you remember the name either a) you are likely to remember it in the future and buy the product, b) you will talk about the product, whether in a negative or positive light and that will get the name into other peoples heads, and c) you may unintentionally share the product online, again negative or positive doesnt matter, and it will spread farther and farther causing more people to look into it and remember the name.

Therefore I am on Red Alert; I'm so triggered, I'm literally about to run back to my ship to man my assigned duty station against aggressors...     When a salesman's voice announces, 'There's Incredible Deals at Sam's Car Dealership!'   
   WTF How did those guys get that alarm signal, and who's going to lose their job for using it to sell cars!?"

honus-wagner-,fe4fvjm,t3_enirzo,I think also television ads shouldn’t be able to use common ringtones and the vibrate sound.
wittwlweggz,fe4q9b5,t3_enirzo,"I produce radio ads for a living at a radio communications company and completely agree with this. What is frustrating is when clients want those noises in their ad. I hate it too when my professional opinion doesn't matter to them because they say it ""works."" 

And it's like no... It's annoying and dangerous. Your business will be associated with danger and being annoying. 

Ironically, in my area furniture stores are the worst with this trend.

And it should be illegal to air such ridiculous noises because that would take a lot off of my shoulders trying to convince clients to just write an entertaining script or just let me have the wheel 100%, but it's all just up to the station and using common sense. 

And then all of the ad agencies that just send us ads have no common sense... Ad agencies don't get the phone call from the angry listener, we do at the radio station."
goldenxhour,fe0e8w8,t3_enirzo,OMG YES I could not agree more
scarfmom,fe28s3o,t3_enirzo,"Agreed! Rush Hour traffic is scary enough without the absolutely unnecessary pump up in volume of a siren, a horn blast or a “Siri” request.

I listen to a local talk radio station; news, traffic, etc. during my commute and when those ads come on, it really causes me to be hyper aware as in “WTF is going on around me?”

In my city (Phoenix) we have enough distractions with wrong way drivers, construction on major transportation routes, distracted driving laws. 

I don’t think marketing departments realize this is impactful to drivers at all, they just want the dollars without any regard for anything else."

Then again, you miss out on the fun minigames they have often or local news"
Galvsworld,fe3neqj,t3_enirzo,"I agree it’s dangerous BS to have on the radio, and I lean towards minimal regulation in general. Objectively it makes no sense to allow them and the FCC already told stations not to be stupid, and they have abused the privilege (like a siren in a song that always has a siren is far more predictable than in random ass commercials). There probably should be an organized effort to revisit the rule being put in place.

“One question I have received on multiple occasions over the years is whether it’s true that radio stations are prohibited from airing the sound of a police siren. I have had broadcasters swear there is a flat prohibition on this and that they were taught about it early in their career. While there is no outright prohibition, this “old broadcaster’s tale” stems from a 1970 FCC proceeding where several complainants sought such a ban. The FCC declined to prohibit these sound effects, but basically told broadcasters to use common sense when airing them.”"

coolsy,emv6r6,top_level,"we were supposed to be taking a nap. i was only five years old. my dad hated when we were playing and he wanted to sleep, so he had us follow suit, otherwise we would get into trouble. my older brother came into my bedroom and told me to come down to the basement. you can imagine what occurred.

a few years pass. i am now nine. i have accidentally told the babysitter about what has been going on. mom and dad get divorced. my sister gets into drugs and is very mean. the sexual abuse stops.

until my two cousins take your place. i am older now, braver, and tell mom after a few months. dad doesn't believe me. he makes me write a letter apologizing to you two and your dad. i don't know if it ever sent.

i am now twelve, and my grandma dies a week before my birthday. mom falls off the rails. we never see her anymore, she is always out drinking and partying and doesn't come home until the early hours of the morning. but don't worry little brother; i will take care of you. i will make sure you are cleaned, fed, get enough sleep, have done your homework, and get to school on time.

i don't take care of myself. i rarely sleep. i am sad. i am overweight. i get made fun of at school but no one knows what is going on in my life. i bury myself in my studies and keep to myself. i need to make sure my brother is okay. mom and i argue all the time, i can't stand her. she doesn't think she is doing anything wrong.

i am thirteen, and dad goes to court. we move in with him. it is okay for awhile, but then he gets married. she has two kids. they get pregnant. she is a horrible woman. her kids are more important than we are, and soon, dad acts as if she is more important. he makes me stay home and raise the four kids. i get my first job at fifteen and i need to buy everything for myself. i am not allowed to do anything fun, and i need to clean the house.

dad and step mom wanted me to pay my driver's ed, but it was $800. i never ended up getting my license. i have to walk home in snow storms, in a dangerous city, in pitch darkness. i called step mom once to ask her to come pick me up, she told me, ""*no, i am cooking dinner*"". i walked home in fear.

my youngest brother was born in 2011. i have never felt such a connection with someone, such a love. it was as if he was my own son. i am only alive today because of him. december 18 2012 i tried to kill myself. but i didn't go through with it, only because of him. i heard his delicate, sweet little giggle and i knew - i could never leave him. i could not **not** protect him. he had to know how much i cared for him.

after my high school graduation, you kicked me out. i still don't know why. you won't tell me why, either. i now wasn't able to go to my dream school that i got accepted to. my boyfriend's dad took me in, because my sister wouldn't allow me to stay with her. i had no one. i was alone. my entire family hated me.

why? i never did anything wrong. i always tried my best. i graduated with distinction, i was a sweet girl. why did they not love me?

my godparents and their children blocked me out of their lives for a few months. all because i told my story, sharing how my parents were. abusive. neglectful. bad people. they are friends with my mom, and they did not like that i said i had no one after high school. i did not mean them. i meant blood family. my parents. after that i was truly by myself. everyone that i had ever loved and known, grew up with, left. 

why?

what did i do? am i unlovable? am i that bad? why don't any of them care about me?

years have gone. i am now twenty four. i own a house. i am a landlord. i have two dogs. i finally got my license. i am married to my high school sweetheart. i will graduate in may. i will help children like me. i will give them a voice, save them from their traumas and nightmares, and i will never be like you. or you. i will be good.

(i know this is a different way of a true off my chest, but it was the easiest way for me to write it. if you have read until the end, thank you for listening.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UPDATE: thank you all so much for the lovely comments, advice, questions and awards. it truly means so much to me that so many of you read this - it was initially just a venting session for me as my father and i had an argument on thursday, and i am going through a lot personally. it felt better to write it all out, and knowing i am not alone is helping. 

and to those who think i'm lying because my writing style is different, sorry to disappoint you, but everything i've written is true. it is apparently difficult to believe that a young married couple with jobs can buy a two family house, but that's not my opinion, it is yours. 

and to those who say i am lying about my entire past, i can only hope that someday you develop empathy and don't feel the necessity to insult those online.

last but not least, whomever has issues with landlords - 🖕🏼"
PhunkyMunky76,fdrsljl,t3_emv6r6,"I grew up abused, homeless half the time, starving half to death. I never fit in at school, it was very obvious we were poor and other kids just can’t keep themselves from making fun. It was “I saw Eddie moving today. Yeah, he was kicking a can down the street because they got evicted from the Safeway parking lot!” 

It’s true, lots of times we did live in a camp trailer in various parking lots, but the kids always made it out to be a soda can. It’s not like I ever told anybody anything. I never had anybody over. I was embarrassed. I was ashamed that I couldn’t have new shoes like those other kids. 

I grew up knowing for an absolute fact that I would be nothing. Nobody. That all the days of my life, I would be a worthless piece of shit. What a gift, huh? What a gift for parents to give to their children! To tell us all through our childhood that we’ll never be good enough. Well... except for my half brother. He could never be wrong, never do wrong, and when he did do wrong it was me that got punished and it didn’t take long before he began to do things on purpose to get me in trouble. He was five years younger than me and he knew that if he did something he shouldn’t, I would get the unholy fuck beat out of me and I’d go to bed without anything to eat, if we had food. 

I grew up combing the sides of the road for recyclables, digging in garbage cans and dumpsters, even doing that to find items just expired; sodas, bread... 

And I had 3 parents. My mom, stepdad, and real dad. By the time I was a teenager I was so... angry. I loathed myself so much. I tried to kill myself once, found myself in a mental hospital for a week. It was no help. I drank a lot. I drank a lot all the way into my 30’s. 

When I was 20, my life going nowhere, I joined the army. Best thing I could have done. I wasn’t a good soldier, but I did my best. I had something to have a little pride in. I’d never had that before. Went to Bosnia, then ETS’d. 

Got married when I was 23. Went into the National guard. I was a drunk and we were so poor. But my wife was, and is the most wonderful person. Stuck with me and loved me no matter what. Eventually my daughter was born. I went to Iraq, came home a different person. Stopped drinking when I was in my 30’s. 

Today we own our house and we’re about to move from Seattle to Montana. We have two kids, both teenagers. My daughter’s a junior and looking at college for psychology. I’ve worked myself nearly to death to make sure we bought this house we live in so that my kids wouldn’t be constantly moving. My refrigerator and pantry are overfilled, nobody goes hungry in this house. When we buy our new house in Montana, I’ll continue with that. I have NEVER told my kids they were worthless, unwanted, or any other thing like that. I’ve never beat them. I don’t play favorites, and if you did something wrong, you’re the only person who will get in trouble; you’ll only answer for your own misbehavior, and not that of your sibling. There is nothing but love in this family. 

So, I guess what I’m saying is I understand. I’m glad you changed your life. I’m glad you will not do that to your own little family. I’m glad you’re breaking those chains."
kenzo535,fds7wn0,t1_fdrsljl,Thank you very much for all you‘re doing and keep on being good :)
chirim,fdstw8u,t1_fdrsljl,"It's really admirable that you didn't let those experiences break you. You're striving to do better, to be better than your parents - not to hurt others in a toxic attempt to cope with what you've been through. I hope you never lose that strength, I can imagine it can be a battle sometimes."
desertrosebhc,fdt4tvz,t1_fdrsljl,"I didn't move around like you did but my sperm donor made sure that I knew I wasn't enough. I wasn't male, I wasn't pretty, I wasn't popular, I wasn't  athletic, I wasn't smart, I wasn't lovable. I married the week after I graduated from high school to the first guy who asked and gave up a full scholarship. See I was smart. 

But all of those things he told me took hold in my mind and I have always believed them. Every relationship I've ever had was abusive. And, I developed mental health issues that still plague me. But, I'm in treatment and I'm ok. 

I spent 8 or 9 years in an alcoholic haze. I was trying to crawl in that bottle. I moved back to the home place to be close to my mother, who never knew the things he said to me, and my grannie. I began to heal as I quit drinking but It wasn't much of a healing. Just being home soothed my soul and I miss both of those women.

I'm in a good place now as I am healing mentally but not so much physically. I have several autoimmune diseases and deal with chronic pain every day. And, I believe it's the result of all those years of abuse - 60 some odd years. 

But I'm a survivor. All who go thru such trauma in our childhood and live to adulthood are survivors. All I salute you all."
Nectoux,fds80sb,t1_fdrsljl,You’re amazing.
jesslynn39,fdtlayl,t1_fdrsljl,"I don't know you but I'm so proud of you ❤ Thank you for spreading some hope, and thank you for your service."

PhunkyMunky76,fds98wg,t1_fds7wn0,Thank you. I will.
PhunkyMunky76,fdsv7b5,t1_fdstw8u,"Thank you. It can be in some ways, but I don’t have it in me to harm the people I love so much. My battles are internal. I fight with self worth, I fight with unwarranted anger, I fight how I view the world, I fight my view of who I am. I fight with how sometimes I still hate myself... there’s no reason for it. I know I’m a good person, I know I am loved, but it persists, though less so now than it did before. I wish it would go away... but I do my best not to let my children think that way about themselves. I constantly reassure them that they’re good people, that I love them even if I get angry about something. 

When I have bad days, because they happen, I’ll let them know about it. I’ll explain what’s going on and that I’m struggling with whatever it is at the time. I’ll let them know I need to be alone because I don’t want to be mean and I’m afraid sometimes that when I’m having a rough time that I might be and I don’t want to be. I’m open and honest with my kids. They know life can be struggle, that it’s ok. We work through it and push forward. And I won’t hide that from them. It’s helped them, I think.

Like today... it’s been off. My thoughts have been a bit dark. Just a mix of garbage, though nothing serious. Some doubts about our move to Montana, though that’s just the pessimist in me and I’m fighting against all that today. It’s ok. It’ll pass. Maybe I need some sleep, or maybe a long shower. Might watch a comedy. But whatever’s going on today is temporary, normal for me, and I’m genuinely fine. Lol life leaves scars sometimes. Aches and pains... emotional arthritis you could say. It never lingers."
prplmze,fdtms06,t1_fdt4tvz,Thank you for sharing your life story. You are strong and you are a survivor. I salute you.
PhunkyMunky76,fdthuhm,t1_fdt4tvz,"And I salute back! I hope you get relief from the pain you’re going through. I don’t have autoimmune issues, but my back and knees often hurt, especially in Pacific Northwest winters- always a nasty cold wetness here that makes your bones cold, or so it seems. We got a hot tub to deal with it. Best purchase I ever made, aside from buying my house. I wonder if such a thing might help you?"
PhunkyMunky76,fds99y6,t1_fds80sb,Thank you.
PhunkyMunky76,fdtldsb,t1_fdtlayl,Thank you :)
prplmze,fdtmjjj,t1_fdsv7b5,You know yourself well and are strong. I say that because the strongest people recognize their weaknesses and find a way to meet those weaknesses head on and deal with it - even if it is letting loved ones know that today is a day I need to be alone. You do this and you teach your children that life lesson along with massive amounts of love. You have it down. Congratulations on getting to this point in your life and good luck with the move and your future.

Slut_Bunwalla666,fdrtnzp,t3_emv6r6,"People don’t like being called out, or made to confront their demons, because it fractures the false reality they’ve created to be able to live with themselves. Drugs, abuse, projection, it’s all a way of pretending that life’s ok, I’m ok, there’s nothing wrong with this. “I don’t want you telling me MY friend is a horrible person! If it’s true, what does that say about ME?” Then there are people like you. You can’t live like that. You have “too much” love and goodness in you to live in a nasty world. You call out the darkness for what it is, and those in the dark don’t like it. You are rare and precious, sadly. Please keep shining that bright light!"

Wanderer-of-life26,fdrydmn,t3_emv6r6,Every step of the way made you strong enough to do anything in life. You made it through situations where people don’t. They fall. They crumble.

Rastagon01,fdtjbvq,t3_emv6r6,"I grew up in a house with a mother who drank everyday and beat me and my sister who was considered slow back then. Probably had add or adhd, was hyperactive. We would eat tons of sugary foods before bed every night and my sister would be bouncing of the walls and unable to go to bed. This didn't work well with a miserable drunk of a mother. Every night it seemed like it would start with her being slapped and hit and I would eventually go in and tell my mom to leave her alone, which inevitably meant I would be next.
My father was a Navy Seal in the mid 60s and ended his time being in Vietnam doing unspeakable things to people. He was captured and tortured before being rescued. He had an incredible way of shutting down. We lived in a small 2 bedroom apartment and he could lay in his lazyboy everynight and somehow tune out his kids being beaten. He was looked upon as the greatest supervisor at his work and was the longest tenured fire chief in the town we lived in. Everyone looked up to him. But somehow he just let these beatings go on forever, or until I was 12 or 13 and got to be big enough to fend her off. 
I am sorry to hear your story, it is heartbreaking to listen to and feel the pain through your words. I always wished my dad would have left my mom. But in hearing your story I don't know which was worse, being stuck like I was or you having to be hurt by multiple people. I am happy that you have found your way and have made good for yourself. I am a father of 4 and other than a couple small moments I have never laid a hand on any of my kids and give them all of my time and love. Stay strong and I hope you help the kids way you want to!"

Jeffreyhead,fdsd5fm,t3_emv6r6,"I think you answered your own questions by becoming who you are now. Are you unloved? Only by people who don't deserve you. Your husband loves you. Your little brother too. You have overcome much more than most do in a lifetime. Anyone from the past that didn't want to put your interests above their own will live and die miserably. You know how to be selfless, because that's what you have lived, that's what you know and that's what you do. Your legacy will live on because of this, and all of the past nightmares will take time to heal, but you have people that will help you now. You have earned a good life, for the rest of your life, and you fucking deserve it."
imariaprime,fdsdal4,t3_emv6r6,"I hope you understand now that it was never a reflection of how worth loving you were.

I have a strange perspective on this sort of abuse, not because I ever experienced it myself but because my mother was very honest with me about *her* upbringing. A lot of your story is unfortunately familiar. However, it's also true that you both found a way out in the end.

Going forward, definitely keep going to therapy (I get the impression you already are going now, or have in the past). There's a lot of ways that my mom's past snuck up on her, but mostly by the omission of learning *good* coping methods rather than simply echoes of her past traumas. Cognitive behavioural therapy ended up extremely useful for her.

You're going to turn out fine and happy; of this, I'm pretty confident. Just don't forget that you always deserve to aim for even *higher* than ""not hurting anymore"". Everyone deserves that."

Swizletek,eo4qkr,top_level,"When I was in high school (about 10 years ago) I started experiencing symptoms of depression. Mental health wasn’t addressed at all by my school back then, and I never got help due largely to the associated stigma, and due to the misinformation I was receiving from my friends. (“You can’t be depressed, you have friends,” “you don’t know what depression REALLY feels like” etc).

Recently I’ve been seeing more and more posts from r/teenagers making it to r/all that bother be greatly due to their similar reductive treatment of mental health, and their oversimplified solutions. I think there’s a lot of value in finding a likeminded community, but I’ve seen a lot of legitimate cries for help on Reddit, and it troubles me greatly thinking how many users actually rely on Reddit for legitimate help only to get misdirected or trivialized by well-meaning individuals who do more harm than good."

some professionals suck. Many just want to push meds. I had fucking terrible mental problems from 15 to about 22. In that 7 years no one told me to try exercising and eating better. For different reasons in college I joined a gym a and started eating better. It pretty much cured me. Professionals are great and all, and therapy helped me a lot.

They dropped in the 90s and into the early 2000s and have been climbing ever since the recession.  So yes 25 years ago, suicide rates were lower than today in the us.  That's certainly not the only indicator of happiness but it's a good measure of how society is doing at addressing our deepest problems. 

I completely agree.  The increase in people, especially young people, talking to each other about their mental health is an excellent improvement and step forward.  It's drawing attention to a huge number of problems we have in our society and helping people be more open and honest with one another.  But the hive mind is a dangerous thing.  Your best advise in terms of improving your situation is gonna come from a trained professional."

Vetinery,feb1b2p,t1_fe99xlz,"Depression doesn’t make you stupid.  Seeing and talking with other people suffering depression helps with the single biggest problem: Identifying that you have it.  Contrary to what those who haven’t experienced it might imagine, it doesn’t feel “weird” or “abnormal” because you lose the baseline to measure it against.  It’s actually incredibly counterintuitive to realize that your feelings don’t match reality.  This is where talking to others is so incredibly valuable."

But, teenagers usually need their parents to find a professional.  So they forgo all that and come here to unload and relate to other teenagers.  I like to think most of them are just feeding off of each others hormonal teenage roller coasters.  Unfortunately, the ones that are really struggling with something clinical tend to get lost in the mix.  It may be something you have to figure out for yourself, but that is challenging even for an emotionally mature adult.  I suppose the good news is that they are reaching out at all."

VagueSomething,fe9gwzp,t1_fe9dke7,"The problem with mental health is there's not really a cure for the serious or severe. It's all about learning to manage it. This makes it so much more difficult than physical health because you can get surgery or physiotherapy to improve a physical problem if meds don't treat it. There's no cure for depression or ASD. There's no small exercise with a band that can strengthen your resolve or cut out the infected part.


Realising that you're not curing but rather learning to live with mental health is one of the more important mindsets in my opinion. Once you accept you're not looking for a miracle you can focus on what helps you day to day. At the end of the day it hasn't been the multiple GPs, Psychiatrists, Psychologists, Specialists, Mental Health nurses etc that have kept me alive but my friends and pets. Dozens of types of meds, talking therapies, group therapy, they're about giving you tools to help you cope day to day. Learning to break cycles that make you feel worse. 


The experts don't know as much as we'd like them to and they're pretty much guessing with most things. Seeking help is a good start but the harsh truth is to not get your hopes up.


The advice of a teenager who is coping with mental health issues can easily be them telling you the real treatments, diet and exercise being two that experts and randoms will point to. The teenagers could be telling others what they have been told by their doctors they have been privileged to see as well as them finding the ""natural"" treatments in setting routines and pushing through to build yourself up. 


Hell because of working with professionals and getting treatment I even have now got a physical disability for life due to the damn meds I have been taking to keep me from being suicidal. Literally damaged my internal organs fighting mental health. So it's easy to understand why people don't want to just have pills thrown at them."

The 70s saw plenty of talk about the world freezing over in their lifetimes; in the 90s I was told pretty vividly that the rainforests were dying and that this could very well mean the end of all life by consequence of less oxygen (I got the impression that this was the chief source of all oxygen on earth, at the time) and so and so animal dying out, resulting in so and so animal dying out, and etc. In the 2000s and 2010s I heard plenty of talk about the bees all dying out and that this would definitely, without question result in the death of all life.

Clearly I have family members prone to hyperbole and worry but I heard this sort of stuff out ""in the wild"" as well. Doomsday prophets and panics have been around for eons.

I agree, this one has some weight, but people have unrealistic expectations of what these changes will mean, almost *immediately* (see the movie ""2012"" or ""Day After Tomorrow"" or ""Knowing"" for films capitalizing on these fears), and that leads to panics (or apathy, honestly, if they dont see the worst of the worst play out)."

orokami11,fech44l,t1_fe97vcf,"God I know someone like this. She was on heroin and went for rehab+sober living but didn't follow their rules at all. She was dating/fucking other people in rehab and sober living, and AFAIK, that is usually frowned upon if you're actually serious about being sober? She got kicked out of soberliving and started going to bars with friends. Kept saying it was alright because her friends would stop her from drinking too much, etc. Said she was given the ""OK to experiment"" by her therapist?? 

Then she started saying you can actually choose what you want to be sober from. And that she's sober from heroin so she can do anything else if she wants to. But doesn't sober literally mean not being under the influence of ANY drug at all?"
brokencompass502,fea3pes,t1_fe9yx9y,"Yeah the advice there is just awful. The OP's usually have great intentions, but the ""support"" they get just makes me cringe. 

If we could all quit our vices by posting ""I'm done with XYZ"" on a website, addiction wouldn't be such a serious issue. The fact of the matter is, that quitting this type of habit is extremely hard. Success rates are as low as 5-10% and the whole process is very complex and often takes years and years of dedication before you're out of the woods."
ontopofyourmom,feajsth,t1_fea3pes,"I've never quit anything more serious than cigarettes, but over the ten years of trying to get there I learned a few facts about nicotine addiction. I can give genuinely good advice and coaching to people trying to quit.

Even though nicotine addiction and alcoholism share some deep similarities that all addictions do, I can't even imagine trying to tell someone how to stop drinking! 

There is also the idea that you can continue doing something in order to stop doing it  (hello, nicotine gum). While abstinence isn't necessarily required for every person trying to recover from an addiction, it is for most people. 

The thing I really don't understand about recovering from alcoholism is how fundamentally disruptive it is to the social life of an alcoholic. One of the hardest things for me when quitting smoking was fear and anxiety about how I would respond to situations where I normally smoked (getting up, after meals, etc). That sorted itself out almost instantly once I stopped. Fear and anxiety about not having fun with my friends anymore would be a really big deal - and I am impressed by everyone who has navigated that issue."
brokencompass502,fealrll,t1_feajsth,"> Fear and anxiety about not having fun with my friends anymore would be a really big deal 

Yeah that was my biggest hurdle. Especially since the drinking environment basically encompassed my entire social life. Frankly it sucks to give it up, but when you get to a point where it's life-or-death, you have to be able to come to grips with it. Nobody wants to let that part go, and that pull is often as big a reason that people return back to drinking as the addiction itself."
filosophicaltunafish,fecqfyd,t1_fealrll,"Not quite the same because I never struggled with alcoholism (luckily) but I was diagnosed with bipolar this summer so I have been trying to live sober for my mental health and because my medication interacts with alcohol hardcore. 

I have went to parties a few times and stayed sober but mostly because they were close friends I can socialize easily with but I can't go to bars and have fun.  I have been having to reconstruct my entire social circle around being sober and I don't even have a desire to drink."
tamagnocci,fe93gmw,t3_eo4qkr,The self diagnosed community is even worse.
SutoresuNeko,feb8nh4,t1_fe93gmw,"I don't even understand how someone can self diagnose themselves with a good conscience. Like, I struggled with my emotions for *years* until I finally confessed to my doctor that I don't feel normal. Although it took me way longer to gather the courage to see a therapist. I'm always afraid that people won't take me seriously. I still ask myself if I'm *really* depressed, even though my doctor and my therapist agree that I am. So it just blows my mind that self diagnosis is so common."
reereejugs,febg8i6,t1_fe93gmw,"I was fully aware of part of what's wrong with me before being clinically diagnosed but, rather than mentioning it to the doctor I had back then, I let him figure it and slap a label on it. I wasn't even aware of the rest of it, especially the ADHD, until I was diagnosed a couple of years ago. Just figured the issues that go with it were part of one of my other diagnoses and fought the psychiatrist about it for awhile before agreeing to try meds. She was right lol."
AgentMeatbal,fec09v4,t1_feb8nh4,"Well everyone is different. May be easier for some to accept they are struggling. 


A lot of people don’t have the money to go see a doctor and a therapist. They pick the label that they can best use to express “something  isn’t right inside”. 


Not everyone struggles for years before admittance. Some struggle longer. Everyone’s mental health journey is different and that’s ok."
Coral_Blue_Number_2,fectfse,t1_fec09v4,"Self-diagnosis can sometimes be right, but it can sometimes be wrong and possibly harmful. Mental health professionals learn differential diagnosis, which involves differentiation between potential disorders a client may have. Somebody could diagnose themselves with depression and get anti-depressants, and if the person actually has bipolar disorder, taking antidepressants could cause a potential dangerous manic or hypomanic episode. Unfortunately most doctors don’t do a differential diagnosis interview, speaking from my own experience, so the above harmful situation could happen even with a doctor facilitating treatment. The best bet is to look for a highly rated counselor and ask around sliding payment scales or see if pro-bono (free) services are available."
HappyTreeality,fe8ta0r,t3_eo4qkr,"Yeah, I agree. There are a lot of insightful people on Reddit, there's also a lot of the opposite. Sure, find a community online if you're struggling. Real healing is likely going to come from meaningful, real life relationships.

Something else I personally take issue with is this suggestion of therapy all over the place. That's fantastic, do it... if you can afford it. A lot of people can't, and this idea is sold to us that ONLY medical professionals can help you through something like depression is very discouraging to someone without insurance. That's simply not true, I've heard from therapists that were book-smart morons, and high school drop-outs that could talk *anyone* down from a ledge."
reereejugs,febfgey,t1_fe8ta0r,There are options for free or sliding scale therapy and psychiatry if you don't have insurance. That's how I see my mental health team.
Yelesa,febxe4w,t1_fe8ta0r,"The problem with recommending non-therapists, is that there are more people who make your issues about themselves in an attempt to show empathy (OMG, I feel that way too. Yesterday when X did Y...), than those who just sit down and listen. That’s why professionals are recommended instead.

Still, in general (there are exceptions, of course) medication does most of the work, not therapy. Mental illness is fucky brain chemistry, not lack of strength/direction from the side of the mentally ill that needs a therapist to tell you how to fix it. Therapy is for working with problems that medication cannot fix."
Not_Obsessive,fe9740s,t3_eo4qkr,"Honestly, that really is a problem and I'm convinced part of it comes from all the self-diagnoses. Very, very few people have sufficient reflective intelligence to properly self-diagnose. They then go out of their way to give advice how to cure the illness they decided they're having and spread misinformation.

If you feel like you're mentally ill, don't just assume what you think fits is actually it. You lack the objectivity to properly diagnose anything. The people who do in fact have the intellectual abilities to do so, usually don't leave it at self-diagnosing but seek professional help afterwards. 

And for the love of God, if you've never seen a specialist abt it, don't just blurt out cures. People don't study for years because it's so easy."
princesspuppy12,fealyz9,t1_fe9740s,Yeah but usually how things are diagnosed are sometimes by those people realizing that they might have that illness.
YeaNo2,fectjhz,t1_fe9740s,Most people lack the ability to self reflect all seems like.

SanityAssassins,feailjt,t1_fe8ujoi,"The best is when they get all indignant about it. As though they're the first 14-15 year old to think they have the world entireeeeely figured out.

Which gets doubly amusing when they then try and turn that around as a reason to blame all old people for their life problems. And old as in... 30+ and get upvoted for it. Yawn.

Questions2pm,fe999hm,t3_eo4qkr,"I don't think sharing is bad - it's important and good. A supportive network is one pho the most amazing and protective factors against some ailments like depression. But advice I often see on here is terrible and conflicts with expert advice. Plus no one should ideally be fighting a serious health problem without seeking professional advice/ opinion. 

Now sometimes professionals be wrong, be asshole, or disagree but many folks on here use that as a reason to not get help when they are suffering from serious mental health problems, which is my concern. That means needless suffering, intensifying of symptoms, more difficult treatment when the person needing help finally seeks it, or even death. 

I wish people related, shared, and got help and advice from experienced helpers in their fields"

Sassenach876,fe9jrkz,t3_eo4qkr,"I don't think the problem truly lies in the advice that is being provided, but I think is indicative of what society appears to lack on a whole, is the inability to judge the merit of advice based on the quality of the advice and qualifications of the source.  And by qualifications, I do not mean only education and/or training, because stupid adults and educated quacks freely abound.   If the wiring in my house is out of whack, calling my buddy who works in HVAC may provide marginally helpful information, but he may also be completely useless to me.  Calling my buddy who is a plumber? Even less so! But at the same time, if either of those friends had been in similar situations, there is a benefit from reaching out to them, before and/or in addition to eventually calling an electrician.    

I do think what you seem to be implying that the teenagers subreddit may need to be better modded  to address the issue, but I do think it comes back to knowing how to think critically, which admittedly teenagers (but also a lot of people) struggle with."

So many of them talk about getting high off ritalin and adderall; that's just not how it works when you actually have ADHD and need the meds.

I don’t understand words and I can’t remember anything or conjure up thoughts. It really rubs me the wrong way when people start taking stimulants because they get distracted sometimes and suddenly think they know all there is to know about adhd.

Double points when they share their insight with those of us whose entire lives are controlled by adhd, and give us generic advice that doesn’t work for us, and the problem of us feeling like we aren’t trying hard enough is just exacerbated.

Medication is supposed to make you feel normal, not strengthen abilities you already had.

My mom recently started adderall because she told her doctor she has trouble focusing sometimes, and now she‘s always disappointed in me. She likes to let me know how frustrated she is by my memory wiping itself clean every two minutes.

daddysmcchicken,fea5km8,t3_eo4qkr,"i mean i’m a teenager here and i can say that some teenagers do give legitimate advice and try to help especially with mental health being such a big topic nowadays, and if a friend reached out to me i would tell them to seek professional help either in person or online"
etherealstar,fea8o7y,t3_eo4qkr,Well there’s not that many places where it’s safe to get proper advice. So r/teenagers is really the best we got
super_zooper,fea92sq,t3_eo4qkr,The best advice to give someone in these situations is to tell them that they should go to a professional to get help imo

Everybody has something something important dont matter if they old young man women whatever.

But at the same time, everybody is full of shit too, and most of the times they wont be able to pick out the good from the shit.

That's why you gotta listen to everything peope tell you and dwell on it, think long and hard and determine if it's worth listening to in that particular instance or shit advice, even with the shit advice, most of the time you can pull the good bits from it and throw the rest away"
WitholdingForLucas,feabcef,t3_eo4qkr,"Why so specific?

Asking strangers for advice on a social platform is just super stupid. Go to people who have been trained instead of ""HOPING"" someone just randomly decides to give you free advice from their specialization."

Especially when they receive affirmation that they're being victimized, disrespected, or having their 'rights' trampled."
OL_SONF_VORSG,feafnuz,t3_eo4qkr,"I think it’s not just giving advice that’s dangerous but the trolls who like to talk down to those who try to reach out for some compassion and maybe help. I remember I posted once in r/TrueOffMyChest during the holidays (was alone and very stressed, depression was very low). Someone told me that my depression was “just a white people thing”. Never did I mention something about my race or gender or anything in that post. But the fact that someone belittled me in such a vulnerable moment made me delete the post and feel terrible. This just isn’t the place for people who are truly trying to seek some comfort."
princesspuppy12,feaiko2,t3_eo4qkr,"I think it should go the same for adults. Though communities like the mental health have helped me alot more than therapy would. In therapy, they pretty much just try to push you onto different meds. Also, therapy and mental health treatment is more expensive. Mental health professionals also don't fully understand mental health either. I mean, treatments are different for everyone and we still don't understand where some mental illnesses come from. I think it truly depends on the person though. I may not be a mental health professional or anything like that but I have helped people to not end their lives before and all I have is a high school diploma. I also just understand mental health all very well."

TheOriginalTomboy,feakffa,t3_eo4qkr,"I enjoy the subs I'm in, most of the time I try and stear them towards professional help in the end. I also try and warm them that I am in no way a doctor, just a person that's been through a lot of shit that can relate."
cncnorman,feakw35,t3_eo4qkr,"I wasn’t allowed professional help for my depression and suicidal ideation and gods forbid that I ask for help!  I only had the advice of my peers to get me through it but luckily they knew coping methods that could help. Not all peers are absent minded kids, they’re possibly living through the same hormonal/mental garbage and can help out."
Lucavious,fean4fz,t3_eo4qkr,"I’m only disturbed by the amount of willful misinformation that gets spread and the subsequent adoption of ridiculous beliefs because of them.

For example every other person believing therapy is expensive and impossible to get into. It isn’t. Just about every state has a public health option you can tap into if you’re truly lacking funds. Therapy is extremely easy and cheap to get if you’re motivated to do so (now medication is whole other story, but most don’t seem motivated to even get that far).

There’s also the hijacking of /r/thanksimcured by whiners who are calling any and all practical solutions fake news, up to and including proven science. It’s popular on that sub now to believe that everyone has depression, nobody can cure it, and you should demand that the world at large bend to your requirements.

I just wish there was some motivation by redditors as a whole to actually address mental health instead of bitching about it. Actually do things! Or ask someone for help. So many of us would love to be part of the solution."
reereejugs,febjk2s,t1_fean4fz,"A lot of psych meds can be obtained free or inexpensively, too."
BinaryReality0101,fean4r5,t3_eo4qkr,"Almost any time mental health gets brought up on Reddit it becomes a weird game of one-upmanship. ""I have this....well I have it worse... you don't really have it, I was diagnosed..."" it is very odd.




The other side of the coin, and even worse, is the posts from people going to the doctor soon and asking what specific things they should say to get the results they want. People line up to tell people exactly how to respond to questions and even what doctors see to get the diagnosis they want."
LinuxCharms,fear7wh,t3_eo4qkr,"I think it's fine if they are sharing to relate to one another.

However when they are giving things like suicide advice, depression isn't real because you didnt go through anything, parents are dysfunctional deal with it, etc. It sets up dangerous situations.

Whenever I find kids on r/trees that are underage but making posts about their depression, as a mostly adult (24) I still realize they need advice from a professional. Sure I can probably help them in the moment, but only psychiatrists and psychologists are going to get them true relief/results."
medjas,fearr57,t3_eo4qkr,I consider it more of a support system than anything
shaylabayla24,featcr5,t3_eo4qkr,"I sort of disagree with this. As a teenager I stayed pretty up to date with mental health, and because I was very knowledgeable about mental health and sexual reproductive health, it made me more approachable by other classmates who weren’t. They knew they could rely on me to keep a secret, unless it was going to hurt them or others. Working now in similar fields I would say I safety planned with them on what the right decision for them was and then kept it confidential between us, which helped create a safe place for open conversation. I definitely wasn’t telling them what disorders they had or saying they specifically needed to be medicated, but when they needed an actual professional I knew the locations and numbers of them. Keeping teens in the dark about these things and not having peer role models is dangerous and makes them feel alone in a bad time. On the same note, I definitely don’t think that teens should be relying on peers to self-diagnosis themselves and it could also have negative affects."
TheLolomancer,featj3e,t3_eo4qkr,"To play devil's advocate for a bit, most mental health professionals are also bad at giving meaningful help. Many of them simply shove pills down your throat or otherwise put the depressed person into a state of complacency, making you either feel like nothing at all can be done so you might as well give up, or that it's ok to be depressed and it's not a problem you should want to overcome. If anything, that kind of ""help"" is even more damaging than what a teen's peers could do since it only serves to send that person deeper into a spiral of depression that they're now convinced isn't their responsibility."
JebKushman,feau3bg,t3_eo4qkr,"As a teenager who used to be depressed and have grown happy in recent years, (still a teenager) I have to disagree. I think I have some good advice for people who are really in trouble. Of course, my advice should not be seen as a be all end all for anyone, but providing tips and tricks and things like that could be really helpful for a lot of people, adults included."

There are a lot of serious issues, but the advice given is usually given by other 13-18 y/o that barely have their own life in check or don't understand the entirety of the situation. They do mean well, but it often ends up being an echo chamber of bad ideas."
Ladyofworries,feb9to8,t3_eo4qkr,I do see a lot of ‘seek out a professional for help’  but that is on different subreddits i do think that is good advice to give via the internet
ArchGaden,febcoo1,t3_eo4qkr,"It happens everywhere and not just on Reddit.  I remember being one of those teenagers giving dumb advice to friends over AIM, Myspace, livejournal, ect... and just as often, in person with actual talking.  I was always kinda quiet, a good listener, and trustworthy (I didn't go repeating secrets).  That made me the target of a lot of cries for help.  Being that I actually cared, I tried to help.  I really tried.  I gave the best advice I could, most of which, in retrospect, was just dumb fantasy solutions.  I was teenager, what did I know about life?  Pretty much nothing.  To be fair though, none of them killed themselves, so maybe I did alright or maybe the advice never really mattered and people just need someone to talk to sometimes.  I never considered at the time that it could be dangerous.  I cringe when I think about some of the advice I gave.  Even now in my 30s I still get hit up for life advice rarely, but at least I know enough now to know I still don't know much.  Whenever it comes to mental health issues now, my answer is always 'I can give you all kinds of advice, but it probably won't be very good advice.  You should really get some professional help.'  Referring people to professional help just feels dismissive though and I wish I had some better advice to give."
thestralcounter44,febdgfc,t3_eo4qkr,"Yes but it’s the new norm.  It’s equivalent to what I did hanging at a body of water with some trusted people looking for empathy.  I trust me.  And me is a and was a once depressed teen.  There but for the grace of god go I.  Yeah. Total loner. A complete cog in the machine.  Do this.  Do that. I did as I was told. I always questioned it but kept it to myself. But for sharing with my Irish twin and we were both oppressed together yearning to be free.  It’s the “rail” of the 80’s. The chat line of the mid 80’s, the chat room of the aol 90? Ish. And aol text message of 2000. No one wants to be alone and it’s a stage we all go through. Lucky are those who realize it. Luckier are those who have the support to get through it.  The rest rebel. And so be it. I did or witnessed all of thee above. And I did it in a deafening silence as my two younger brothers were hard of hearing.    I did it as a biracial chick. As my father was Jamaican and my mom irish.  I feel nauseous recalling it all again because it’s my base but so many here have yet to know it.  But I digress.  I was a teen.  I thought I was special. Yes Irene. You are unique!  Just like everyone else.  So sad. Had my obese brother photo my face so I could be a model. Naw. Never made it. Shitty photo. Desperate attempt. So I move on.  Every goddamn summer before junior high began. And before the high school year began. Guess what special Irene did?  She reinvented herself.  For at least five years. 7th grade.  Let’s do this!  We got a cat from the mall for $80. Saw the awesome sexy commercial for a perfume and how my brothers and father noticed the model. “Chloe”.  That’s it!  That’s what I will do going into 7th. Be that model.  Hair cut didn’t work out like I wanted.  Tan did.  Mowing the lawn of our house gave me the golden glow.  New friends?  No.   Any love interests? No.  I’m a loser. My younger more popular sister said so. So I just read.    8.th grade.  Cherry 7up!  That’s my ticket.  To stardom.  To happiness.  To friends and maybe love.  I argued with my mom. My color scheme that year must be green.  Light green. And pink cherries.  Cherry 7up!  The black guy in the commercial sounds like my dad. Except he is happy. Why is my dad always so sad?  I will try to fix it.   ( note: I never did. I failed).  Anyway. 8th grade failed.  Lost the drive for cherry 7up when it didn’t take off in marketing.  And my parents couldn’t afford to buy it.  So I moved on. 9th grade!  Too cool for school. Totally chill. Kelly Slater was my imaginary bro.  Sister surfer chick. Totally Hawaii mentality. Living on Long Island. Long Island livin.   Island freedom.  That was my persona.  Learning to use email.  And surfing is life.  Lol.  Laid back A+ student the friends will line up and the guys will pile on.  Wha? No?  Oh. I only had three friends. But they are great. Organized a U2 rattle and hum get together.  They knew how we felt.  Oppressed.   Lol. Teens. Rebels.  I could go on. But I’ve taken enough time.

BobbaganooshBBQ,feblvp7,t3_eo4qkr,"For real, and Reddit’s number one advice is to medicate yourself which in my super uneducated opinion is the last resort."
Blaithnaid,febnlqz,t3_eo4qkr,"I don't think this is primarily an issue with teenagers, more of an individual thing. I have a lot of very supportive friends, and typically the advice I receive from them is excellent, primarily because they know me as a person. As such, I do agree that asking for mental health help in a public forum like reddit or twitter is probably a bad idea, because people are shitty and while you might get good advice from a well-meaning person, you might also get some pretty nasty advice from someone either ignorant of your situation or who just wants to put someone else down."
Gianahraiin,febnosp,t3_eo4qkr,"Eh, I think it can be problematic if the teenager acts on bad advice. However, that’s sorta what a lot of the subs on here are for. People are supposed to feel like they can reach out and get different types of advice from multiple different sources. That’s actually one of the good things about social media is the sources of help it provides. 

Also, there’s a lot of bad home situations on here and you can’t really talk to anybody irl about serious home problems without having serious consequences due to mandatory reporting being a law with teachers, coaches, therapists, psychologists, etc. 

If a kid needs a place to reach out and ask questions about specific problems and bad situations at home, feeling like they can’t ask a question without having CPS show up at their school or house can nip wanting to seek help at all right then and there. Even if the person their talking to says the wrong thing to a parent can cause serious backlash for that kid. Especially because with a lot of kids, if they do make the mistake of asking a question that prompts someone to report what they’re saying, it can make whatever situation is going on at home MUCH worse. 

Don’t get me wrong, I completely understand where you’re coming from but as a kid who did have CPS show up at their house and school only for my parents to lie and then I had to stay in that toxic environment..well let’s just say it didn’t end to great for me until I got older, smarter and could get out on my own. 

I think kids should be able to help kids in the same shifty situations to an extent."

The problem when applying that to mental health is that it is nuanced and it takes time. The sad truth as well is that sometimes there is no solution.

I mean sure, put your story out there and people might suggest a resource you havent heard of, so it has its benefits, but so many people have weird and unhelpful suggestions for mental health.

lookinatyou,fecr75d,t3_eo4qkr,"There is a good and bad to everything. Mental health has turned from being something that was kinda swept under the rug to being an actual issue. I think it's great now that many professionals say that it's important to establish a primary therapist just as you have a primary care doctor. Take care of your body and mind. 

The problem is that mental health has been put so far out in the open that people self-diagnose and believe it because it is very convenient to blame your problems on a condition rather than deal with them or admit that you did something wrong.

It underminds real conditions and that really bothers me. A great example is obsessive compulsive disorder. How many people do you know that do things strangely or like to just have things done their way and blame it on ocd? Having a small control problem is not the same as having OCD. If you've ever met someone with ocd it's a miserable disease. People lose sleep over the thoughts of something in their fridge might be expired."

I couldn’t do it because I wouldn’t care enough about the look to acquire the patience to relearn simple motions.

There were two major strategies: 1- they would flex their fingers to try to avoid the nail entirely, this was nearly infuriating to watch. 2- they would jab at the buttons with their long nails like trying to drive a knife into it, equally frustrating to watch.

enderflight,fe0c6yr,t1_fdy1t8w,"Related:

My sister used to keep one hand completely long and on the other hand only her thumb was long. She plays viola (bigger violin), so the fingers that push on the strings have to be short. But the one on the bow and the thumb that just gripped the neck of the viola? They could be long.

I don’t know if it was laziness or what, but the dissymmetry drove me insane. Thankfully she now keeps the whole hand short.

I keep all my nails short, partially because I play cello and partially because long nails are just uncomfortable to me at this point. It’s probably force of habit, but the practicality of being able to type and use my fingers is pretty nice too."

thestralcounter44,fdyazuf,t3_en699t,I totally agree. Most hospitals ban nurses from wearing it too long and no nail polish. It’s a Joint Commission of Hospitals Organization rule and mandate... if you’re ever inpatient insist they switch staff. Nails in particular past a certain point are not considered living tissue. They grow past the base where there’s actual blood flow. It really disgusts me as when I worked in a lab in a hospital we had to culture random for a infectious disease paper I once worked on.  Long story short it was disgusting and we cultures all kinds of rare germs. So try to keep them short and this is why handwashing properly including fingers and nails is so important. And don’t bite them. It’s a nasty habit. If you dig up dead people or work in a morgue as I once did for research you’ll notice that hair and nails continue to grow for a certain point.  Both considered not living tissue.  I don’t remember the exact length requirement but when I see the finger I automatically know. Also in particular if you are at a restaurant and your server has dirt under his nails again insist he or she cleans or politely ask for a new waiter. These are violations in most places of health code. Although small infractions you can get very sick.  Again don’t panic too much. I’ve taken tons of courses on Germ theory and worked infectious diseases but it’s good to know and your stomach acid for the most part will kill a major portion of any bacteria you ingest. Just not the really bad ones.  🤮🦠

A place for people to spew things they feel like spewing. Why do you feel the need to gatekeep venting? 

Does it actually bother you that people are bothered by things that don't bother you? 

Long nails don't effect their life, true. They bug OP because OP lets them. So take your own advice, OPs opinion has no effect on your life unless you let it. Downvote the post and move on rather than trying to police people's thoughts. 

Maybe consider unsubbing from any and all vent subs if you're going to take it so personally anytime someone vents about something you don't agree with."
I_am_a_giraffe_,fdx3fka,t1_fdwzqpc,"Someone venting about how other people look is not a behaviour that should be encouraged. It's like someone venting about how they find people with long hair disgusting and ugly.

muddyrose,fdyfqwr,t1_fdxwij7,">Yeah whatever, call it police other thoughts. I think that going as far as needing to vent because he finds what other people do with their image, repulsive, is just not ok, because it's none of his fucking business.

That is policing someone else's thoughts and it's not ""yeah whatever"", your opinion isn't gospel. Neither is OPs. 

What they think of shit like long nails isn't your business. They vented about it in a public space which you feel made it your business, the same as you wearing long nails in public would make them feel like it's their business. You each had to see and acknowledge things you didn't like. You both took something impersonal and made it personal. 

OP took it to a vent sub to get it off their chest. You took it upon yourself to tell them that what *you* think matters more or is more important. *Your* opinion is right, theirs is wrong. 

>If someone were to go to the point of needing to vent about what I choose to do with my own body, which is something that does not affect that person at all, I'd say ""hey, shut the fuck up"". It's not a nice thing to do, even if this is a vent subreddit, not everything should be accepted.

It's not about you, though. It's about them and their preferences. Just as you're entitled to wear long nails if you so choose, they're allowed to think they're gross. You're allowed to wear them in public, they're allowed to vent about them. 

If you want to let a random stranger's opinion get to you so badly, that's your choice. 

>Please inform yourself how stuff like this could encourage insecurities, comments about how other people look. We should encourage people to be the way they want to be, not tell people they look nasty because we just don't like certain style.

Or, how about we take a dose of reality. You can't control what others think and say. And to keep with the reality trend, people are always going to think and say, including me and you. We can encourage people to be the way they want to be all day long, but if a negative or critical opinion undoes it all, that's not a real solution, is it?

Encourage people to take control of how they allow others to make them feel. If someone wants to make a negative comment about a feature, so fucking what. It says more about them than it does you. Especially if *you* like that feature, why would you change anything you like about yourself because a random doesn't happen to like it? 

How about we let people think and say what they want, and if it happens to go against what *we* personally think or say, we'll all survive? We don't need to take it personally or let it destroy how we perceive ourselves; differing opinions and preferences are actually ok."

The source continued, “The heating systems were outdated and inefficient and were not to the environmental standards that we would expect today. The electrical system also needed to be substantially replaced and rewired, even extending to the establishment of a separate upgraded electrical substation, which was in addition to the main works on the property.”

The U.K. is currently very classist. You’re judged from your choice of super market (Aldi or Waitrose) to your university to your accent, as a gauge of social standing. English people are notoriously unfriendly to people outside their own niche (sorry but it’s true! I’m from the U.K. but have lived abroad and now in England for 10 years).

The Royal Family being applauded and reported on and given distinction based on virtue of birth- underpins this whole class thing - the idea that where you are born and to whom matters the most. 

If they are removed - it sends out a message that actually, who your parents were don’t matter and your capability does. The very fact Prince Harry receives a large salary for being an active royal whilst having barely a GCSE to his name shows just how wrong this system is. The fact his wife, despite having very little discernible talent or achievements, has been catipulted to the highest honour based on her association to Harry (representing the queen abroad on tour) shows just how absurd the whole thing is. Getting rid of them acknowledges that, and will inevitably have a trickle down effect on wider society."

She had a career but once she married into royalty she decided that she didn't need it anymore... I hate the thought that she's considered a role model for young girls!

manbruhpig,fdnmrqe,t1_fdnhgjk,"This is so wrong I really hope you're a member of the elite trying to keep the impoverished down. 

Inheritance tax, at least in developed countries, applies only to a very high level of assets that would obviously exempt people in poverty, and in fact most normal people. Parents can still ""save up"" for their children. The point is to mitigate the hoarding of extreme wealth by people who did nothing to create value for the society now tasked with protecting that wealth. In the US, the tax doesn't apply for estates less than roughly $11.5M per person (so for a couple it's nearly $23M). Keep in mind also the upbringing someone who dies with that much money likely provided -- their kid likely grew up with privileges in education, network, and opportunity others already didn't have. Now on top of that they are handed more than most common people will be able to earn in their lifetimes, based on zero effort or value add of their own.  

If you're given every advantage in life, why would you need MORE than $11M tax-free dollars handed down from your parents (and keep in mind we're still talking about taxing a portion over that amount, not taking all of it).

Imagine starting a game of monopoly where other players begin with 20x more money than you, only because their great grand parents played the game better than yours. It's not crazy to redistribute a portion of that free wealth to even the playing field. In fact not doing so goes against the core principles of a meritocracy."

Income strata are just that, strata. It takes effort to go from one level to the next, it's not only a matter of slow growth of hourly pay. To go from one strata to the next, one of the best forces to create that change is the incentive of faster growth beyond that next level.

Sgt_Smitty,fdnh2j8,t1_fdn4qbp,"So I read something a while back that explained the division of power between the monarch and the government. It boiled down to the idea that you could never wind up with a fascist dictator in Britain because, while the Crown has limited powers, at the end of the day the Crown is still the head of state (and vice versa re: the PM). Essentially the monarch functions as a balance of power with the Prime Minister, which I found interesting."

NorthernWolfKing,fdnfxfj,t3_em74p0,"Honestly Elizabeth has been acting like crap to Meghan, excluding her, criticizing the way she dresses and how she wanted to give birth ag home with a medical staff by her side (Elizabeth forced her to give birth at a hospital). I understand why she wants out"
JustinTimberbaked9,fdmrsoc,t3_em74p0,But still it screams of Harry being whipped...
shorts1234,fdn39lb,t1_fdmvx7q,Maybe Meghan is forcing him to do it or maybe he watched as the press treated Meghan so horrifically and it reminded him of the role they played in his mothers life and what a negative effect it was and decided to step away for the sake of the women he loves
Moonpie10,fdngo3x,t1_fdmvx7q,"Likely due in a great part to the realization that as William had more children he slips further down the list,  as he is no longer the ""spare"".

Poullafouca,fdnlmsk,t1_fdna6z5,I wonder if either of them expected such thinly veiled racism from the media whose fawning embrace of the anodyne Kate is actually shudder-worthy...
shorts1234,fdnc76o,t1_fdna6z5,Constant media pressure? Sure it's to be expected. But they've gone after her a lot harsher than Kate and I think we can all guess why. They're toxic towards Meghan and Harry wants to put his wife and child first I think it's unfair to claim hes whipped and being forced into it when theres no evidence to support that claim
ThE_rEdDiT_kId,fdo8b36,t1_fdna6z5,Thank you
Sgt_Smitty,fdnqy62,t1_fdnc76o,"The media has definitely been harsh with Meghan, but she (and Harry) also hasn't done herself any favors by continually bucking royal protocol, spending an  obscene amount of money on her wardrobe, lecturing people about conservation before flying on private jets to lavish baby showers, then demanding privacy while making a public documentary where she literally cried about how hard her luxurious life is. You can't have it both ways.   


I do think there's some truth to the criticism that she approached royal life like a celebrity and thought she could get away with acting like one. Harry knows better; I'm surprised he didn't protect his wife more from the negative press by putting better advisors in place."

Ian43519,fdoh42x,t3_em74p0,Neither Prince William nor Prince Harry are  paid by the taxpayer. They receive a allowance from Prince Charles.  The only variation from that would be if say one of them did a tour on behalf of a Government Dept (for example the Foreign Office to help big up an overseas trade convention. In these instances the department concerned would pay for the travel and accommodation costs).
largma,fdoitf2,t3_em74p0,"The Royals are rich beyond belief, the British tax payer doesn’t pay for the majority of their expenses. You have to remember the crown is the largest British landowner and has been for literally a millennium"

divinbuff,fdpbj7q,t3_em74p0,"While I wish them well,  it’s sad to me that Harry can’t even seem to talk to this family about these matters.  Instead he goes on Instagram to basically tell them what he’s decided.  I thought his beef was with the press, not with his father and grandmother,  but he surely did not show them much respect by not even giving her the courtesy of advance notice.   

I think they misunderstand who’s in the drivers seat here.  Granny and Daddy don’t have to give them any ‘money or a place to live.  Sounds to me they should do a little more consulting and a little less dictating...."
Nathan1506,fdq59b9,t3_em74p0,"That's not how it works though...  


The royal family get the money and they decide what to do with it, they have budgets and managers and they run like a business. If they spent less money in one, place, that money doesn't back ""into the taxpayer's pocket"". It just gets spent elsewhere.  


They also drag in a fuck tonne of tourism, and are one of the only bits of true culture we have left. The world absolutely loves them."

Throwoutlefrog,en9icv,top_level,"I had 2 moments that made me realise I got fat:

1. When I sat on a plane and the arms pinched my hips and legs. It was so uncomfortable and that has never happened to me before.

2. When my friend said ""let's go up that hill next"". I looked at the hill (which was more like a small slope) and said ""nope, sorry, can't do that"".

Those 2 moments gave me the realisation that I had gotten fat and lazy. So I made a change. I went swimming everyday, cut a lot of junk (but not all of it) out my diet and ended up dropping 8 stone in a matter of months. I was so proud of myself and felt better than ever! My fat friends on the other hand were not.

They began insulting me and telling me how bad it was that I lost the weight, that I was basically shaming them. I never once spoke about what I was doing or going on about how amazing I felt. I kept all of that to myself, I'm not the type to shove my achievements or opinions down people's throats. I was basically the exact same as I always was with them, but a slimmer version of myself. I wasn't always fat, in fact I was a good weight for myself almost all my life except when I met them. I did it for me, my health and wellbeing, not for anyone else. 

They were insulting me so much that I ended up telling them to go project on someone else and cut contact with them. Since I've heard down the grape vine that they were saying that I body shamed them all the time and was up myself. 

I'm so glad I cut contact.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the kind words and sharing your stories!"

They put you in a box and as soon as you try to get out of it, they will try to take you down and put you back inside of it.  As I get older I find these people are so much easier to spot and I just avoid them at all costs.  Friends should want you to be the best you can be.  

And I'm sorry, but being skinny(not unhealthy skinny) or healthy is good for you.  It's good for your self esteem and it is good when people try to be the best version of themselves because it demonstrates to other people that you are confident and you want the best out of life.  I have been overweight before and people sometimes don't realize how it can be so detrimental to your happiness.  How you can be so unhappy with the way you look but the only comfort you can find is eating more.  Like in Austin powers it really can be a vicious cycle lol.

Not everything is shaming.... and I’ve seen and heard this before... that your action alone is seen as shaming. There is a scientifically proven healthy zone, and when your in it you feel better.

Healthy people and thin people existing doesn't threaten the existence of fat people and unhealthy people any more than it does the opposite. People assume that someone they disagree with or dislike existing means that they are an enemy or threatening when they've done nothing to imply that. 

If you had shown up talking about how much weight you lost and criticizing your friends for not doing the same, then I can understand why they'd start talking shit. Even if you'd been like ""hey, i've been working on myself lately and i'd like to celebrate that but this isn't a slight against you"" your friends should have supported you because that's what friends do.

Jeffreyhead,fdzvlkp,t1_fdzv77p,"Huh. I think that it is because I am a bloke, and I just couldn't fathom anything but support from friends. But perhaps they are worried that you are ""the hot one"" or something now.. Fucked if I know.. You should start hanging out with dudes. Straight dudes. You know how much we respect men or women who get their weight down? It's fucken hard work, we respect hard work! We're even drawn to hard work! Concreters, brick layers, builders, fire fighters etc. We RESPECT hard work, and you earned respect from straight bloke me."

Prinnykin,fe0gvfh,t3_en9icv,"I’m on the other side of the coin. My best friend of 15 years lost weight and she turned into a complete cunt. 

Last time I saw her, she spent the entire time looking in the mirror, completely ignoring anything I was saying. She was DRIVING and kept checking herself out in the rear view mirror. I’m not about to get killed because she can’t take her eyes off herself for 5 minutes. 

I cut contact with her because she’s so fucking insufferable now."
Zackeramis0298,fdzlri2,t3_en9icv,"Yeah, people who are (dare I say) fat, (no offense) tend to do that a lot, they feel like being skinny is a way of shaming them, and nobody take offense to this but man, if you're fat, you're just like anyone else but unhealthy, I have high metabolism so I *can't* be fat, yet I get put down for ""shaming"" and I've come to the conclusion that being fat gives you no rights, you're just lazy and unhealthy, and that's your own fault, nobody else's."
ellasgb,fdzq67p,t3_en9icv,A lot of people are like that. They only hang with u if u are down to their level. Once u blast off they become fucking assholes. I only have one good friend like a brother. Everybody else is a acquaintance.
louderharderfaster,fdztam4,t3_en9icv,"I tried loving myself as a fat person and had no luck with that so I decided to get healthy instead. The benefits of being healthy and a healthy weight go so far beyond the superficial that I am *glad* I was so unhappy as a fat person.  

I wish I knew more people like you OP. Congrats on putting your health first. We will never regret giving up the things and people that made us unhealthy."

Fredredphooey,fdzx3xl,t3_en9icv,"Congratulations! I read somewhere that we will all weigh about the same and earn about the same as our five closest friends. We all want everyone to be at ""our level"" whatever that is. It's familiar, it's comfortable.

I'm so glad you saw their projection and got out. They will replace you soon enough. Keep up the good work!"

Chaz_m1398,fdzxumf,t3_en9icv,"Honestly people that do that are the people that are jealous but too lazy to do anything. So they project their self fat shaming on others as a way of deflecting how they actually feel inside and “pumping up” (no pun intended in this context) themselves don’t they can try to convince themselves that they love themselves.

Glad you cut them out."
dispiritedfirework,fdzy0cb,t3_en9icv,"I’m so so happy for you for being able to overcome this. I’ve been facing similar problems but my spine is not that shiny.

In my journey, I realized that people like you to be more vulnerable than them, weaker than them and just as fucking miserable. 

I’m very proud of you, keep on. you’ll attract the right people and the haters will hate.  it’s a reflection on them.

congrats, mate x"
Owenwilsonjr,fdzzvg9,t3_en9icv,"People act very strangely when you lose weight. I had a friend who was horrible to me but I couldn’t see it before I lost weight. After I did the way she behaved toward me progressively got worse, took me some time to realise she was insecure and had only really enjoyed our friendship when she was the “pretty” one. Once I lost weight I began to get a lot more attention than I ever had before, but I still didn’t feel confident and so the way she acted on top of that made me feel terrible. Best thing ever was to cut her off. I’m glad you did the same. Enjoy your confidence and self love, you deserve it ❤️"
throwawaytokeep1,fe01szm,t3_en9icv,"Well they should you, at the end of the day you are statistically more likely to make it to all their funerals and therefore be sad so jokes on you! On the real though the main thing that made me lose some weight is the chance to live a little longer..."
tomthehipposlayer,fe02jia,t3_en9icv,"As a fat guy currently in the process of losing weight, I support you totally.

A lot of people treat weight like it can’t be controlled because it’s easier than admitting they failed.

Being thin just feels so much better. You have more energy, you don’t feel sick and tired all the time.

Good on you man!"
superninjaspy47,fe02mnd,t3_en9icv,"I lost 40kg over the course of about 8 months due to illness. The resentment from other people was astounding. I wasn’t even intending to lose it, it just happened I had no control over it but truth be told I did find it much more comfortable with less weight. 

It’s sad that people need to be so judgement about weight in anyway. 

At the same time we need to know when other people are taking their own shit out on us, and realise that it is just that... their shit."
ingrid-magnussen,fe02p2c,t3_en9icv,I’m so happy for you!! Congratulations on the hard work and results. I fully agree with your point about how fat ‘friends’ will shit on you for improving yourself. They often victimize themselves and turn their negativity outwards onto people who weigh less than themselves (check my comment history if you want to see a prime example). It’s really gross behaviour and I guess you lost more weight than you thought - you lost 600 lbs of shitty friends too!
munafalam,fe02szu,t3_en9icv,W
CrowKit,fe05a15,t3_en9icv,"Ahh that’s so cool. It takes a lot to drop friends after finding out how toxic they are. I have a friend who’s currently working out and losing a ton of weight and I’m super proud of her. She has a pretty strict diet and although I have to keep some tabs on her so she doesn’t eat too little or feel too bad about over eating she has done super well staying healthy. She’s really inspired me to try and become healthier. Her sister on the other hand really can be mean and belittles her whenever she feels insecure about eating so much. It makes me so sad because my friend is just trying to be her best self and her sister is bringing her down. Even with that, she’s stayed very strong and she’s gotten so fit"
lyamc,fe05lcb,t3_en9icv,"Congrats! If they ever feel jealous they only need to put in that same hard work, so don't give them a second thought"

Tater-Tot_917,fe08mm7,t3_en9icv,"Yea how dare you make lifestyle changes that benefit you, how dare you make them feel shamed because they cant/wont do the same for themselves, shame on you OP /s

For real though, congratulations :)
And very good job cutting those toxic people out of your life"
Incantationess,fe08xyu,t3_en9icv,Now you can tell everyone you've lost a few hundred pounds at least.
madstephanimal,fe09h71,t3_en9icv,That’s horrible and I’m sorry they did that to you. Forget anyone that doesn’t support your goals of bettering yourself!
BonvivantNamedDom,fe0acxw,t3_en9icv,Oh my god. I never realised that even fat people have peer pressure. Good thing you got rid off them. Congratulations. Also 8 stones are like 50kg for anyone wondering. Just googled it.
wickedmaleficent,fe0akwl,t3_en9icv,"One time I went to the gym and looked in the mirror and realized I was wearing colors that didn’t match! I had to run back home and change but by the time I got dressed and got back to the gym, it was closed. I was forced to do push ups and crunches in the snow outside of the gym in the empty parking lot. So yeah, cutting the berries off the tree really helped even though I don’t like mustard. But I totally agree"
Frogonlilies,fe0b06k,t3_en9icv,Awesome! Good for you and forget those jealous loosers who made fun of you! And good for you you still enjoy eating and not cutting everything else so rigid and ridiculous as some diet promises you. Best thing is to cut back on junk food and many foods that we know are not good for us but still have some fun sometimes. Also increasing exercise especially aerobic on hills kicks butt! I was a marathon pace leader years ago and we helped our members and supported everyone going through body identity struggles from obesity to anorexia. How cruel for others to put down those who are trying to better themselves! You go and be proud and keep it up and tell those idiots to eat shit! Lol! Good for you you’ll be healthier and more happy than all of those unneeded friends. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
PurpleSailor,fe0b2jb,t3_en9icv,"Great for you. As a Nurse I can tell you that being overweight causes unneeded stress everywhere on your body. It causes disease problems of all types and does shorten your life.
 And I say this knowing full well that I'm currently about 40 lbs overweight and it's not good at all for me so I've been slowly loosing for the last few years from when I was 100 lbs overweight. One shouldn't mock overweight people but don't delude yourself into thinking its healthy because it most certainly isn't healthy."
havingfun89,fe0bltf,t3_en9icv,"Good shit man, you first cut off junk food to lose excess pounds, now you're cutting off ""friends"" to lose all that toxicity in your system.

I'm glad you're feeling good. :)"
datsadboi5000,fe0chdi,t3_en9icv,"That is actually a very good thing. And congrats on dropping all that weight. I especially like the fact that you didnt drop all the junk food because everyone just thinks that they need to start eating only certain things day and night, while forgetting its always calories in vs calories out and the complete lack of junk food and only stuff deemed healthy is what makes it extremely hard for people to continue such a life style until or unless they have alot of determination. Really good job and I'd suggest using that method to anyone who is trying to lose weight, makes it easier and more fun."
ZigZagProton,fe0cyit,t3_en9icv,"Good job, those fat ex friends are toxic and great job on losing weight to be a lot more healthy and much better looking  in life!"

ChubbyAngmo,fe0dk37,t3_en9icv,"It sounds like you made the right move. True friends might question you when they need to, but generally they’ll never be a source of negativity in your life.

It’s amazing how it happens, but getting fat is something that’s hard to see in yourself. Despite the feedback, mirrors and selfies, it usually takes a moment, an epiphany or series of events in order for a person to realize just how far the rabbit hole they’ve gone.

Congratulations on such a big improvement in your life and well done!"
Adcppk,fe0dtrg,t3_en9icv,You did the right thing.
AzerothVarrock,fe0ew9g,t3_en9icv,Wow. Fuck that. People who get upset at your growth and achievements and dont ENCOURAGE growth and  achievements are not friends. Those types of people I dont want in my life period. Not cool. Good for you. For losing the weight and losing the toxic friendships.

I LOVE SOMEONE LOLOLOL I HAVE A GURL hahehahefo"" And this is also, too me, a shitty way to proof your love for the person you love. Moreover, I feel like it would imprison me. Not to fake being a boomer but it sounds like a promess and I first don't like to make promesses and I would hate to not being able to hold it. Moreover, I feel like I would have an obligation. I don't know what obligation but I would feel oppressed. I want to love the person I love in my own way. I want to love this person with all my love but in my home, in our warm secret love. I don't want to kiss her in front of people or shit like it. I don't like that. And to me, this is more relax."
CaptionClosed,fdooxej,t1_fdo3whf,"People get married because they want to celebrate their love. They're doing it for them, not for you. I felt how you do when I was 17 too. You'll probably change your mind when you get older. Or you won't. I don't care."
atomic1fire,fdp2a4o,t1_fdo3whf,"For me personally a wedding is a thing that says ""I'm going to tie every financial, legal, and moral responsibility with this person, and I want my friends and family to recognize that this person is basically my co pilot now, and (assuming everything goes right) it's going to be that way forever.


It doesn't have to be expensive, in fact you could just walk over to the nearest court house and sign the license and you would be legally married.

A lot of the expense I think is just basically making it a party for other people, when it doesn't necessarily need to be.

Not married, but that's how I see it."

Aecoh32,emgocu,top_level,i see posts all the time with captions like “saw this poor man eating alone 😢💔” not every moment of someones life has to be spent with other people sometimes its nice to just sit alone for a bit. imagine you’re minding your business one day just eating lunch and someone snaps a pic of you so they can put sad emojis on it for likes. i can want to go out and enjoy myself without other people and theres absolutely nothing sad about that
lexxitron3000,fdop4gk,t3_emgocu,"I absolutely HATE those videos where people go approach people who are alone in public and ask to sit with them. I've had that happen to me before when I was just trying to enjoy the fresh air in peace (no cameras thankfully) and I've been forced to leave whatever bench or table I was sitting and reading on. Because if you ask people to leave you alone, then they act like you're Satan for being ""so rude"" and ""why are you being so stuck up.""

 Fucking kills the mood.

If I wanted to talk to someone, I would have asked a friend to come to the park with me. But I didn't. I intentionally went to a public area *by myself.* So kindly fuck off."

HSOOMinducer,fdpwm38,t1_fdop4gk,"Kinda reminds me of something that used to happen to me, I think it's kind of related. 

I would often go to burger King because with the app there were some really cheap lunch deals (2 Whopper Jr, 2 Fries, & 2 drinks for $5) and I'd stay there about an hour and try different soda mixes with their fancy Coke machine.

This burger king was always empty. Unless it was a weekend at dinner time, there was never more than 2 other people in it, and I'd consider that busy.

On 2 separate occasions, I've had someone sit directly behind me where the booths are. Like, back to back. Why? There's an entire empty restaurant, *plenty* of other booths, and these people sit directly next to me.

Do they feel bad for me because I'm alone? Do they think it'll make me feel better if they sit next to me? It's just weird and makes me extremely uncomfortable. And the fact it's happened twice, I don't even know what to say."
idkbroe,fdq2ksh,t1_fdop4gk,I also hate those videos bc I think it's humiliating for the person who was alone.

lifesagamegirl,fdppyte,t1_fdouswt,"Well, why don't YOU go up to other people and start up a conversation? Why does it have to be them approaching you?

Also, please don't approach me haha. I am always out in public alone and prefer it that way. People always want to talk to me, I guess I have a friendly face, and I just prefer being left alone. I have to actively try to not make eye contact because people constantly start talking to me. I have to deliberately put up barriers so I can keep my lovely solitude, although so many times I do end up laughing and talking with strangers. Everyone feels like a friend, truly. People are so nice. 

But the point of this is that not everyone who is alone is lonely or wants companionship."
BallardTime,fdq2nsj,t1_fdpwm38,Maybe they're just being considerate to the staff - minimising the spread of mess. It's not like they're approaching you.
lexxitron3000,fdql3su,t1_fdqc6yo,"The thing is, the people who do that generally can’t read the room.

If some old man’s sitting on the bench by himself just kind of looking around, maybe feeding the birds, etc, then sure whatever approach him.

But if I’m outside alone, a small petit woman, reading on my phone (I have the kindle app on my phone), maybe I have headphones on—why the hell do people assume I wanna be approached? I’m clearly engaged in another activity. 

Are those people well meaning? You can argue that. But do I have to sit there and praise them for making me wanna off myself listening to them stroking their own egos at talking to the “lonely girl” while I think about how I could be reading and how I’ll probably have to leave the location and go home to continue this? No, I’m not gonna praise them for that.

I’m a pretty chill person, and I’m usually cool with meeting people anywhere, but this is one thing that I guess you can call my pet peeve. Apparently I look very approachable and I often cause strangers to unload all of their psychological trauma on me when I in fact do not care nor did I ask."
writenicely,fdozafl,t1_fdoyhy8,"YES! God, why do we live in the type of world where being in public, means you're no longer allowed to interact with, you know, the public? There's respecting the individual privacy of people out there, and then theres living in a crapsack world where you're not allowed to freely talk to the stranger you literally just met besides you. We shouldn't need goddamn apps for any of this."
writenicely,fdpt8za,t1_fdppyte,"Maybe its because I dont like the idea of being seen as a creepy person due to my being autistic, so it would be a lot easier if someone who wanted to know me was as honest as I'd be, if they were willing to give me the chance.

greydoe,fdrqozl,t1_fdpte3f,"In my life, 3 of my very best friends have been guys (I'm female).  Once, I had this friend who I saw at least 3/4 times/week.  He drove a limo, and when it was slow, he'd just come by, pick me up, and we'd go eat dinner.  It broke up his night, and mine too.  We were never romantically involved.  After a couple of years, he tells me he's met this woman and they've been dating for a month or so.  She just got out of a marriage where her husband fooled around on her, and so now she doesn't want him to have any female friends.  He actually stopped being friends with me!  I was so upset.  I even told him that if the roles were reversed, and I started seeing someone who insisted I dump him as a friend, I'd tell them to buzz off.  No way I'd give up a good friend because someone else is insecure.  That's horse shit.

Anyway, he recently contacted me - 20 years later - to say that Trudy (now his wife), is okay with us being friends again.  Imagine that.  My response?  No thanks!  Was I too harsh?  I mean, I'm not anyone's convenience.  :("

courtxx,fdonsht,t3_emgocu,Psychologically it’s not healthy always needing to have company. Being at peace and happy with just yourself is a goal everyone should want to meet.

Actually I think people who *can't* do activities alone are the sad ones."
imogen1983,fdpeh6l,t1_fdp7ipo,I had a roommate in college who couldn’t even go grocery shopping alone. Now that’s sad.
nightwolves,fdpueya,t1_fdp7ipo,Same!! If you have another person then you can’t really immerse yourself in what you’re doing. And you need to consider their preferences etc.
moriikuma,fdq0jwm,t1_fdp7ipo,"This x10000000. I’ve had a few friends in college that absolutely would not go out unless they had friends with them, even if they were studying or going on a quick food run, simply because they HAD to hang out with someone when going out. It made me wonder how insecure they had to be with themselves to not even be in their lonesome when doing simple errands. I mean damn, I absolutely love shopping by myself and going at my leisure... I can look at all the different kinds of ketchup in the sauce aisle and be amazed without anyone judging me lol.

One of my best friends was shocked I went to a concert alone once and was even more shocked at the fact I’ve gone to most of my concerts alone. “Doesn’t your boyfriend go with you though?” It’s like yes, I’d love it if he could go, but he doesn’t share the same music taste as me and prefers to not spend money seeing an artist he’s not interested in. I’m perfectly fine with that and he enjoys driving me to/from venues which is great since I hate driving in the city. It’s like, if there’s a great concert or event happening in my area, I’m not going to not go just because I don’t have a friend with me!!"
Skiirox,fdouo8z,t3_emgocu,"Awww man I love going out by myself for a bite. Sometimes the servers won’t even approach me because they’re assuming I’m waiting for someone. Once, I asked for the check after 2-3 coffees at a bar and the woman just asked ‘ohh, he stood you up?’ Like, why is that appropriate? How come that’s the first thing that pops up in your mind? 
People should be a little less dependant, enjoy spending time alone. It’s enlightening."
GenericUsername180,fdoyrs1,t3_emgocu,"Some of the best meals I've ever had I was alone. It's nice to go to a restaurant order a big ass steak and put your headphones in and just Vibe out to music while eating good food.

Note: I’m still very polite etc.  But no compromises on when I want to do things"
hecaete47,fdr8agv,t1_fdpay0l,"Oh this! For my first vacation while I was abroad, I went to Paris and London alone. I also went to Milan and Verona alone. It was absolutely fantastic: I could stick to a schedule or just wander around wherever. No compromising on where I ate, where I went, what I did, when I left or returned to the hotel. It was absolutely fantastic. I felt bad about it later because everyone else on the study abroad program was vacationing with other students so I finally sucked it up & went on a trip with someone else- I was honestly miserable the entire time because of course I didn't know this person well & trying to compromise with a random peer was a disaster (on the flip-side I met up with someone from my college who actually was a good friend, who was studying abroad in a different European country, and we had a fantastic time then). There's times to be alone and times to be together. Sometimes it's great to have a friend, but being alone is also perfectly great."

Sweet_N_Vicious,fdot8w1,t3_emgocu,I love eating alone and last year I started going to movies alone.  I still go out to eat or to the movies with friends but I enjoy my solitude.  My favorite is going to an early movie on the weekends and taking myself out to a nice lunch.   I interact with so many people during the workweek so I like being by myself.

leviisin,fdpj4mj,t3_emgocu,"Yes to this!

Like wtf don’t look at my phone or me?!?? 

Why is it so weird to eat alone in public! Why!! I even get the weird looks if I ask for a table of one at a restaurant I heard has good food. Or I’ll send the pictures of food I was suggested and my friends get all weird I went alone cause I said selfies not just my food lol? Why I didn’t want to have to wait 3months so all is girls could go out and eat food at a place you’ve already been?"
scottysgirl416,fdqi0kh,t3_emgocu,"I love to eat alone. I don't have to share my food, have any awkward conversations or convos that's gonna turn awkward, I'm not in anyone's time. 

Granted it wasn't always like that. I had to dine alone quite a few times, to see the beauty in it, but I did and fell in love with it.

I started to dine alone after a breakup. I had always had a stigma that people were judging me because I was in the bigger side eating by myself, so I'd always stray away from it. I eventually got over that and started to enjoy it."
SaucyMacgyver,fdqqpsi,t3_emgocu,"Me and my gf are complete opposites when it comes to this. I don’t mind eating alone at all and sometimes actually enjoy it, but she absolutely HATES eating alone.

Of course I do and don’t mind cuz I love her but at the same I just don’t see it as such a big deal."

Vishusvixen,fdpc4sk,t3_emgocu,"I agree with this 100%! One of my favorite things to do when I need some ""me time"" away from my husband and kids is to go to my favorite hookah bar and get some shisa and baba ghanoush and kick back on the cushions and read a book. I get some time away from my day-to-day life every couple of weeks or so, and can recharge my batteries so I can handle all the demands on my time without wanting to explode. I can't stand it when people want to sit with me or next to me and want to chat because they think I'm lonely or need company. I am really outgoing and can/will talk to anyone about anything most of the time and will often chat with the people around me when I feel like it, but if I have intentionally chosen the cushions in the corner and have a book in front of my face, then leave me alone please!"

hecaete47,fdr9bco,t1_fdpe80c,"I eat at the dining halls alone all the time, but it's pretty common too since everyone in college has such busy schedules. Sometimes I'll purposefully bring my laptop and headphones to have 30 mins of Netflix before having to study, and will run into close friends or someone will ask to sit near me and it'll be like ""Dang it! No Queer Eye now!""

moriikuma,fdpz3ff,t3_emgocu,"I’m an introvert and self-proclaimed foodie with a very small group of friends, and I don’t really feel comfortable enjoying food with someone I’m not close to or can relax around. It’s not that I don’t want to/ever eat out with acquaintances (I wish I could with ease, it takes a lot of mental prep to do so), it’s just that I’m a bit socially nervous/awkward and prefer to enjoy a good meal with good company, rather than having to feel anxious making conversation with someone I can’t fully relax around when I want to be able to enjoy my food without worry.

During my last few years in college, I had 3 people that I felt completely comfortable eating with besides family: one of my best friends who’s a picky eater, my other best friend who’s vegetarian and doesn’t eat out due to her strict cultural/religious diet, and my LDR boyfriend who I only saw around twice per month. I couldn’t go on adventurous food excursions with friends often because my options were limited. I didn’t want to not enjoy the food my city offered (there was a lot to explore in regards to the food scene), so semi-frequently I’d go out by myself and eat at a restaurant. I actually preferred eating alone since I could go at my own pace, feel comfortable with myself, and internally geek out over the food. Plus I could watch Netflix/YouTube or read a book while enjoying a tasty meal at my leisure. I felt perfectly happy eating in my lonesome and only felt slightly sad at times, but that was because my boyfriend wasn’t around and I missed him every single day we weren’t together during our 3.5 years of long distance.

Sorry for the lengthy reply, but yes, there’s absolutely NOTHING wrong with eating alone and I wish people would stop making it seem like a negative thing!"
revverbau,fdpz5tz,t3_emgocu,"I have a girlfriend of four years and even though we used to attend the same uni, sometimes we would have lunch out together, sometimes we would just go separately.

faircreditscore,fdpz8ax,t3_emgocu,"Literally broke up with boyfriend few hours ago because I fucking hate being in relationships and being  tied down. So... I celebrated the ability and freedom to live my best life by taking myself to Chipotle and then Starbucks. Girl approached me and we had a great philosophical conversation but in hindsight I wonder if it was out of pity... super cool girl though, hopefully our friendship still lasts when the pity resolves.

Additionally, as an introvert, I get the perfect amount of social satisfaction just being in public alone. People can be way too much and just me in a room alone can get a little boring or even depressing. Even introverts need to feel like they are part of a society. Online forums are perfect tools for introverts to socialize peacefully, for example."

People kept trying to get her to shut up and her friends eventually had to come and drag her back to her seat because her talking was a nuisance for them, too. Her parting words? “I’m sorry! She looked lonely!” My friend was like, “Am I invisible or something?”"
1313thirteenth,fdq6qlq,t3_emgocu,THIS!!!! I travel for work and mostly end up sat in some restaurant alone. I get such pitying looks and sometimes creepy men asking if I want company.

Morningwood645,fdqies9,t3_emgocu,Girlfriend I had in college would legitimately not eat at the dining hall if she didn’t have a friend to go with.

Caslu222,fdqje84,t3_emgocu,"Same thing when going to the movies. One friend of mine would get upset when I tell her I saw a movie by myself. And I dont explicitly tell her I did, either. She'll ask if I went with anyone, or she'll ask if I went by myself. I dont know what she expects."

Em-dashes,fe5p26n,t1_fe5h6k1,"**Me as pronoun:**

Me is used as a [pronoun](https://www.definitions.net/definition/pronoun) in [English](https://www.definitions.net/definition/English) language [where](https://www.definitions.net/definition/where) it is used by a [speaker](https://www.definitions.net/definition/speaker) to [refer](https://www.definitions.net/definition/refer) to [himself](https://www.definitions.net/definition/himself) or [herself](https://www.definitions.net/definition/herself) as the [object](https://www.definitions.net/definition/object) of a verb or preposition.

Do you [understand](https://www.definitions.net/definition/understand) me?

**I as pronoun:**

I is also used as a [pronoun](https://www.definitions.net/definition/pronoun) which is used by a [speaker](https://www.definitions.net/definition/speaker) to [refer](https://www.definitions.net/definition/refer) to [himself](https://www.definitions.net/definition/himself) or herself.

Accept me for what I am.

**Use of me:**

Me is used as an [objective](https://www.definitions.net/definition/objective) pronoun. This [means](https://www.definitions.net/definition/means) that it [functions](https://www.definitions.net/definition/functions) as an [object](https://www.definitions.net/definition/object) in the sentences. As I is a subject, it is [always](https://www.definitions.net/definition/always) near the verb or at the [beginning](https://www.definitions.net/definition/beginning) of a sentence.

**Examples:**

I [ordered](https://www.definitions.net/definition/ordered) a pizza.

I went to the mall.

Did you see John and me at the party?

**Use of I:**

📷

I is used as a [subjective](https://www.definitions.net/definition/subjective) pronoun. This [simply](https://www.definitions.net/definition/simply) means that it [functions](https://www.definitions.net/definition/functions) as the [subject](https://www.definitions.net/definition/subject) of a sentence. As me [functions](https://www.definitions.net/definition/functions) as an object, thus it [appear](https://www.definitions.net/definition/appear) after [verbs](https://www.definitions.net/definition/verbs) or [prepositions](https://www.definitions.net/definition/prepositions) in a sentence.

**Examples:**

Ashley went to pool with [Molly](https://www.definitions.net/definition/Molly) and me.

She [thanked](https://www.definitions.net/definition/thanked) me for the car.

You and I went to the movies.

**Me or I:**

While [these](https://www.definitions.net/definition/these) words can be [tough](https://www.definitions.net/definition/tough) to remember, it’s [important](https://www.definitions.net/definition/important) to use them correctly. I is used as a subject. Me is used as an object. If you’re [still](https://www.definitions.net/definition/still) not sure when to use me and I, here is a good [trick](https://www.definitions.net/definition/trick) that will help you remember. When you run [across](https://www.definitions.net/definition/across) a [sentence](https://www.definitions.net/definition/sentence) that [confuses](https://www.definitions.net/definition/confuses) you, [remove](https://www.definitions.net/definition/remove) the [other](https://www.definitions.net/definition/other) person from the [sentence](https://www.definitions.net/definition/sentence) and try it out with just I or me. For example,

Tracy and (I/me) like this dress.

I like this dress. (Correct)

Me like this dress. (Incorrect)

Also,

The bus [dropped](https://www.definitions.net/definition/dropped) (I/me) and [Tracy](https://www.definitions.net/definition/Tracy) near the park.

Throwaway20564,emw5c2,top_level,"EDIT someone has just gone to get him and bring him home. I want to say that I really appreciate all the advice and encouragement I've gotten on here. It's going to be very hard but a little easier since I now know more about how to approach it. Thank you all

Throwaway for obvious reasons even though my son doesn't ever use reddit. In about 4 hours I will be telling my son his father is gone. I talked with the school social worker who recommended we wait til the end of the day and tell him at home. Here I am just sitting and watching time tick by and dreading this conversation. 

Without sharing a lot of details, my son's father who was in his early 50s died in his sleep this morning. It was not 100% unexpected but we thought we had much more time. My son and I had discussed the possibility although we had talked of a few years down the road.

Him and his dad were not very very close but he went and spent weekends with him about once a month and of course he loved his dad. Regardless I think this is going to be very hard on him but I don't really know what to expect. He's lost a couple of family members but no one close.

Posting here because I really don't know what to do and I need advice. Please help if you can"
zeezeepants,fdrlehd,t3_emw5c2,"I’m sorry for your loss. My only advice would be to be patient and don’t expect anything on how he should/might react. 

People process grief in different ways, one of them being a seemingly lack of grief. Some people grieve in silence, while others are more obvious. 

Also, grief might be delayed so if he seems fine now but down the road his behaviour has changed, give him time to process. 

Make sure you each have the proper support system in your lives to find healthy ways to cope and grieve with the loss and change."

rr_0223,fdryl3e,t1_fdrlehd,"To piggyback on this, I’m not outwardly emotional (except happiness/excitement). I never cry...the last time I cried was when my grandfather died (13 years ago?). Just in preparation of him not breaking down; which one might expect, it may hit like a ton of bricks but it’s hard to get it out. It’s not a lack of emotion, but rather expression. 

As said above, don’t try to anticipate a reaction and don’t be put off by no reaction.

Best of luck to you and sorry for your loss."

It is called shock and it is a hella thing.  I am sure he will grieve his father, but it is OK if he isn't ready to do that right away.

ShoddyCheesecake,fdvmnzv,t1_fds9gei,All of this. My great grandmother (with whom I was very close) passed away when I was sixteen. I didn't really process the grief I felt at losing her until I was 23.
ncmisse,fdrog8h,t3_emw5c2,"First off, I am sorry that your son's father has passed. You too have my condolences, you cared about him enough to have his child so you are dealing with your feelings as well as worrying about your son. I dont know your stance on faith and the afterlife so I will not try to advise you concerning the afterlife. Perhaps you just sit your son down and tell him that his father has passed today because his body could not go on one more second. If he could have stayed here by sheer willpower then he would still be here. Let him know that you are here for him, and you guys will get through this together. You could tell him that you know his dad loves and cares about him. Also let him know that he will go through many different feelings about his father's passing, and they are all valid and necessary and normal. He gets to feel how ever he feels. Again let him know you are here for him what ever he needs.  I hope this is helpful."
Throwaway20564,fdros8a,t1_fdrog8h,Yes thank you very much. My son does not believe in an afterlife but I wish he did. I think it would make things a little easier if I could tell him dad's in heaven. Thanks again
montimama,fds19q5,t1_fdros8a,"I’m someone who also doesn’t believe an afterlife. Something that has brought me a lot of peace is the awareness that we literally carry the DNA that made your parent INSIDE OF YOU. We live forever in that sense, just in different forms traveling from one DNA combination of generations to the next. The very best of his father (and mother) was passed onto him, is WITH him and always will be."
philo_milkshake,fdsdxa7,t1_fdros8a,"As an atheist, there's this famous bit of writing that I find beautiful and I know it's helped a lot of people: 

AARON FREEMAN:

You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.

And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.

And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.

And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly. Amen."

Karasong,fdrpgpc,t3_emw5c2,"Hey there, I am sorry for your lost. Since you asked for help I want to tell you what I did in a similar situation. 

I lost my dad when I was 13 years old. He had cancer and initially, I thought he was getting better. Then everything happened very fast. 

When I was 17 my aunt was about to die and my cousin (18) was just like me when I was 13. He thought everything was going fine because that was what everyone told him. 

I knew I had to tell him what was really going on, that he had to say his goodbye to her soon, as long she still had a clear mind. So I thought quite long about how to tell him that. I asked my doctor and some other people. 

The only thing you can do is to be as direct as possible. Death casts a brutal shadow, one you can not overthrow with elocution. 

Tell him that his dad passed away peacefully in his sleep. There is no better or worse when it comes to death.

You are already doing amazingly. You are strong at such a terrible time. I hope I could be helpful. I wish you and your son all the best."
neverincompliance,fdrvsh7,t3_emw5c2,"Another school social worker here. What I often see with kids and grief is how they grieve in ""spurts"". I have seen so many kids grieving every imaginable loss and they may seem devestated one moment and fine the next. This is a cycle that likely continues.

Don't assume he is accepting or adjusting to the loss if he soon seems ok, he will need support and help for awhile.  I think counseling for kids who have suffered a major loss is never a bad idea.

Call your local hospice if you need the name of a children's/teens grief counselor if you need a referral. Please don't think the school social worker will be able to give your son all the counseling he needs. They usually deal with hundreds of kids and are always putting out fires.

Last thing-don't ignore your own pain here. Even if this is an ex-relationship, you are likely going to feel all sorts of things, sometimes conflicting feelings. Wishing you and your son peace and healing. He is lucky to have a Mom who cares like you do"
liluyvene,fdrzbkn,t3_emw5c2,"When my mom sat me and my brother down to tell us about our dad, she also did it at the end of the day. She prefaced it by telling us she loved us, and how sorry she was, and told us the truth. She held us as we cried and answered any questions we had (it was completely unexpected for us), and asked us if we wanted to stay home tomorrow from school. Honestly can’t remember the actual words, so maybe that part won’t be the most important part. But your actions will make a difference. So be as flexible as you can be. Everyone grieves differently so he may not react the way you expect. That makes it hard to prepare yourself for this."
katycheeks,fdrtxcw,t3_emw5c2,"I'm so sorry for your loss.
I lost my mum at 16, I definitely held it together for the first 6 weeks or so and then it really hit me. My dad wasn't great and moved on really quickly. He was with my mum at the time of her passing.
I can honestly say it effected me massively for the next 20 years.
I wish I had been given support, I 100%needed counselling.
My dad wasn't in a fit state to support us, and it did effect my adulthood I went off the rails, not to a massive extent but it changed my personality a huge amount. My life would of been so different without her passing away.

My only advice would be to cut some slack if there is some acting up. Offer therapy, if he doesn't like the therapist, keep going until he finds one he does. Be there for him. I'm sure you will do an amazing job of helping him through this tough time in his life. Could maybe be worth you getting some advice from a professional. All you can be is his mum. Good luck xx"

I found out my Dad has died after school when I was 12 and I would say you’re definitely doing the right thing in that regard. 

IMO giving him the freedom to grieve in his own way is the way to go. When my sister and I found out about our Dad she wanted to go to school and have everything be normal but I didn’t want to see anyone and our Mum gave us both what we thought we needed. 

Be honest with him. 
Show emotion. 
Be there for him. 
Be ready for any kind of reaction.

Danger5Ranger,fds09br,t3_emw5c2,"I lost my Dad at 9. My parents had divorced 5 years prior and we'd had very little contact with my father since then. He had become an alcoholic.

Was given the news in a similar setting with my sister after school. I had lots of questions and there were lots of tears.

Be available to answer questions, offer hugs, and don't set expectations or timelines for how you think he should feel. Share (unbiased) stories and pictures if you can. Let him visit with his father's family, without you. So he can see pictures, hear stories, feel love from and get know a part of his family he may have not been close with. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Be open and encouraging to him to build a relationship with these people if it wasn't there before. Loss brings people together. He may never get another opportunity to learn more about his father's life and who he was."

I dont know what advice I can give you though. I just tried to lessen the shock a little bit by telling them that I had some very bad news to share and then said that ""Uncle C didn't make it"" as they'd heard he'd been in some kind of incident. Then I just hugged them a lot as they cried. No magic formula, just lots of hugging.

So If I may....I come from an emotionless family and it has caused unending difficulty in recognising emotions in my self.
So knowing nothing about you or your son I would just be real. Tell him about the agony you've felt about having the conversation and express your own feelings. Teach him that difficult feelings and grief is a real thing that everybody feels sometime in life. Go through it together"

thestralcounter44,fds6tg4,t3_emw5c2,I don’t even know were to begin.  It’s going to be a bumpy ride. It depends on his relationship with him and his relationship with you.  How do you get along?  Angst and humility are gonna be best friends for him for a while. Allow him the physical and emotional responses he expresses..  a diary may help to get the pain out. It really depends on how he reacts to things. Being honest is imperative at this point. At his age he doesn’t believe in Santa Claus or the tooth fairy.  Break it to him gently. And offer support and advice. Keep an eye on his behavior as of late and for the next few weeks. Teens are figuratively standing up as the roller coaster of life goes on. Reach out for help again if you are lost or alone. Best of luck.

If not, I would suggest being gentle with tone but firm with your words. 

I have had to break the news to families and it’s so shocking sometimes, words like, “your father passed/gone etc.” isn’t comprehended. I didn’t deliver news myself right away, but a colleague took the reigns. 

Shortly after delivering news myself I was in attendance as support for the family that was present but the colleague who delivered the news used the words “your father has passed in an accident” they didn’t get it. They asked when they could see him and the colleague looked confused, and said it wouldn’t be best to see him in the condition he was in. They began to get angry because they thought the dad was just severely injured and they were not being permitted to be with their loved one. Then another person stepped in and apologized for the misunderstanding, but their father was dead. 

As hard as it is, it’s necessary to make sure there is no misunderstanding. People tend to react poorly when they think someone is withholding the truth. Be firm with the words, gentle in tone.

I was in the son's position about a year ago, but I was 12. My father's death was completely unexpected, as we didn't know of any health problems. It took me a good month to actually realize what was going on. I cried, a lot, but I stopped crying and got over it to some degree after half a year. I still cry from time to time, but I think it's better to cry than to hold it in. 

I hope this helps. The most important thing to do is treasure the memories and let him be alone for. a bit. Don't pressure him into anything. He needs to get over it alone.

lowhangingfruitcake,fdw76xp,t3_emw5c2,"First I want to say  how sorry I am.  Also that it get easier.   There’s no right way to do it, but there are probably some ‘wrong’ ways.  My kids were younger, were  10 and 12.  I just told them the facts, and answered questions.   
Kids all react differently.  He actually died at midnight, but I didn’t want to wake them then.  I didn’t want them to just wake up like a normal day either, so I woke them at 5.  My daughter wanted to go to school anyway and not tell anyone.   She keeps things quiet and wants no sympathy from anyone.  My son wears his heart on his sleeve and was angry.  He was furious at all who said anything religious and lost whatever shred of religious faith he had.  I’m an atheist too, and when he asked where I though his dad was, or what happens when we die, I had to be honest.  When he asked the inevitable ‘why did god let this happen?’ I had to be honest.  I don’t think there is a god, and for no fucking reason at all.  When he wanted to know if it would always hurt this much I said not really, but yes, it probably would.  He’d wake up crying every morning because he’d dream about his dad being alive and forget.  He’d try to get out of school pretending to be sick.  I had to make him go every day, but I’d get up early so I could get in bed and snuggle for a while first.  You can’t make him feel better with words- it’s amazing the hurtful things people who try to provide religious comfort can say.  Just be there.  He try to get people to cut him slack by saying his dad had died, but as his mom, I was the only one who could call him out and nip it in the bud.  That was important.  We talked about him every day, good stuff, bad stuff, joking, crying.  My daughter was tough as nails, and said she was putting it all in a ‘box in her head’ that she kept closed most of the time.  She doubled down at school and got great grades, but dropped all her old friends and made new ones. At a bad part, I found a grief counselor and we all went for awhile.  The first year was brutal, but there is something kind of magic about the one year mark.  Three years later, they are happy well adjusted kids.  It’s going to be rough, and every kid is different, but kids are really really tough and resilient.  He can come out of this ok on the other end.  Just talk to him, be honest and open,  and be there. Set some limits, but gently and kindly.  stability and consistency matter.  You can do this.  Please pm me if you ever want to talk."
thestralcounter44,fdx6lrq,t3_emw5c2,"I don’t know if anyone or I had mentioned this but it’s very important too.  It doesn’t matter to me what you believe in. God or no.  Any religion. Though of your religion tells you to kill in the name of any god it’s too extreme. But science says at least from what I’ve read that we are 96? Or 99 something like that made up of stardust. To me that means we were meant to be here as a part of the universe.  We don’t know what our purpose is yet or maybe we do. But even if our light is extinguished early, it’s so important to tell people especially kids that this means we exist for some reason and if we die unexpectedly (really no one wants to so I think most are unexpected). We must find and give purpose to the ones who have gone.  So his father means something (even if you don’t like him you once did love him). And we can give his life a renewed purpose by living well with his memory. Some people pick up the gauntlet and others just honor the memory the best way they can (me I hunt for my dads WWII uniform a sibling sold for drug money I think I’m on the right path to restore family honor). But religious or not it’s vital to give spirituality to kids. It gives hope and deters them from the dark side .  There’s a magnet I give to people from the bookstore and to patients if I remember when loved ones die. I’ll try to post it when I find it. Keep hope alive even in memory. It’s vital to us all.  Please keep reaching out if you need to. Someone is always there."

I deleted all my socials, and explained to close friends that I will be disappearing to deal with this until it has passed because I've done enough damage and I don't want to do more. 

I just have to get through this struggle for a few more days and it's supposed to get easier. I think taking a break to focus on myself is the right thing to do in this period so I can be successful. 

I will do this right, I will finally quit and no longer be a smoker. This is it."
sharingmyBBW,fe79sbq,t3_eo29we,Stay strong!!
kasshaaa,fe7a98r,t1_fe79sbq,"Thank you, I am trying"
Ataz0th,fe7aqk0,t3_eo29we,"The first week is the biggest hurdle. After that it gets much easier. I was a smoker from 17-21 and quit cold turkey. Never felt so good after getting it out of my system. You'll be able to breathe better, smell things and taste things like normal. Just don't give in, the craziness and cravings are temporary."
kasshaaa,fe7aw4l,t1_fe7aqk0,"As am asthmatic, after only two days I'm already breathing way better than when I was smoking. 
I can get through 5 more days of this. Thank you."
Ataz0th,fe8rl4x,t1_fe7aw4l,You got this. Soon you'll appreciate being a non smoker again because the smell of cigarettes will turn your stomach. That's when you know you're good lol

kasshaaa,fe78byd,t1_fe782oy,"Thank you, I fully understand now why people relapse. I have locked myself in my room, cancelled my card and made sure I had enough groceries to last so I physically can't even buy any just in case my will power lapses."

kasshaaa,fe9iu4j,t1_fe9e2fk,"I normally drink about 2lts a day to stay hydrated, cutting out soft drinks and other caffeinated beverages helped with the motivation to quit."

Terracottapanacotta,fe8katd,t3_eo29we,"there’s a sub reddit called r/stopsmoking . 
I found it incredible while i was quitting, highly recommend,  i’m 15 months smoke free and i credit the sub reddit and a quit smoking tracker app they use on there to maintaining my  motivation. that and Allen Carr’s Easy Way book.

Good luck! you’ve got this!

edit - typos and i’ve worked out the link."
kasshaaa,fe94tet,t1_fe8katd,"Thank you! I'll have to check this out. I'm using an app called my quit buddy to track, and watching the money saved as well as the hours increase definitely helps."

Terracottapanacotta,fea138f,t1_fe94tet,"awesome!! i’d jump on there when ever i had a craving. 
the book Allen Carr’s easy way can be downloaded, i was feeling weak one night so downloaded as an ebook so i could start it there and then. i haven’t looked back.
i’ve also worked out how to link that sub reddit for you. i was half asleep when i commented, sorry it was was mess but i really wanted you to know you can do this and there’s support out there."

HeadbangingBuffolo,fe78flc,t3_eo29we,"Keep it up! It's been 6 months since I quit. I really hated smoking back then so I just got mad at myself and tossed it out. Plus it's too expensive in my country thanks to taxes and all. 2 3 days was kind of hard for me. I kept my mouth busy with eating and drinking. I avoided to let my stomach grunt for that whenever I felt hungry, it made me smoke. I have a very limited social life and I don't really use social media. So I got nothing to say about it.  I wish I had something else to say but don't give up! When I used to smoke I usually said myself ""I can't imagine myself without holding a cigarrete between my fingers"" because I believe that cigarette is like an accessories except being mouth habit and chemicals. After one month things had changed and I said/and still am saying myself that ""I even forgot how to smoke cigarettes lol"". So basically hating it really helped me! 

I am really bad at pep talk and all, I'm sorry. Keep it up! 

#It's so much better without it!"
kasshaaa,fe78v9p,t1_fe78flc,"Great job on 6 months! I bought gum and lollipops to keep in places that I see as triggers, so when I crave I can just grab at one of those. 
Thank you for the encouragement, I don't want to give up. I want to be able to say that I've been clean for 6 months."
HeadbangingBuffolo,fe7aj09,t1_fe78v9p,YOU WILL! I'm an individual who lack of confidence since I was born and till l die but I made it so everyone can! It's a freedom literally.
NoiseBarn,fe8ryt7,t3_eo29we,"Read “Easy way to stop smoking” by Allen Carr. He explains what you’re going though in great detail and how it can be stopped (without relapsing) 

Keep it up man. Your future self will thank you."

NoiseBarn,fe9c2vm,t1_fe97afn,"You can do this, brave redditor! 

Just remember you are giving up NOTHING by quitting smoking. But in return you are receiving: 

- Increased energy 
- Better  breathing 
- Food will taste better 
- Clothes and hair will not reek
- More confidence 
- MORE MONEY IN THE BANK 
- You will just FEEL better all together! 

And always remember this: A cigarette will only seem like a good idea only when you ARENT smoking one. 

We believe in you!"
emmyjoe311,fe93sbb,t1_fe92lq2,The real win here is that we are BOTH NONSMOKERS!!! That is so BADASS!!! Glad to give you your first gold!
kasshaaa,fe9j5qi,t1_fe9c2vm,Thank you! I am going to screenshot this to put on my whiteboard in my room to remind me what I am gaining from this.
kasshaaa,fe975z0,t1_fe93sbb,"I know I'm just emotional right now, but being called a badass for not smoking has made me read up, thank you."
Abutrug,fe82rxh,t3_eo29we,"I'm there too and really really angry, and I'm so angry I can feel rage in my arms and legs. It's just receptors looking for nicotine. I've not smoked for a day or two and I still went to my friend house for one. Big mistake now I'm craving all night.
 It pisses me off that it's even legal for sale. Every time you quit it gets easier, well not for me. I've quit around 10 times. You see the problem is, do I quit weed too? Last year I started smoking weed by itself. Not nice to start with but after 3 weeks I was struggling and felt a piece of me was missing. I was looking for something but I knew it was nicotine. I admit tobacco is fucked. I have been smoking since 1997. 

Advice for young people: Weed isn't very addictive unless you mix with tobacco. Then you're fucked. Truly hooked for life. Giving up weed is easy as long I have my ciggies.

So, you've given up smoking tobacco but still on the weed? Ok that's cool but how do you cope at work? You don't you start smoking cigarettes again!!! Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccckkkk 
Best of luck op, I'll struggle with you mate"
kasshaaa,fe95ims,t1_fe82rxh,"I live with three smokers, so I I've been looking myself in my room when the cravings gets so bad that O want one. I might tell them if I ask for one, for them to refuse. I know it'll make me angry, but that sounds like the better option of the two. I don't want to fall this time. 

I have stopped smoking weed until I know that I will never touch tobacco again. I want to be done with this stupid drug for good."
lostinreddit4ever,fe8nmkj,t3_eo29we,"I just hit my (28F) one year anniversary of being quit after smoking for 9 years!!

It WILL get better, it is WORTH it!! I promise!!! Withdrawals suck so bad but if you can use your will power to get through it, the rest isn’t easy but it is better!

Once you make it through the physical, mental, and emotional toll of withdrawals- you will feel a weight lifted off of you. I promise"
kasshaaa,fe95pvj,t1_fe8nmkj,"Congratulations on one year, that is amazing! 

It's currently 4am and I woke up craving so instead I had some cheese and biscuits. One day I hope to be able to say I've made it to my one year anniversary like you, thank you."
lostinreddit4ever,fe9c47l,t1_fe95pvj,"Thank you!! I tried to quit probably 100 times over 9 years, so it feels good that it finally stuck!

Everyone says exercise helps, so I took walks when I wanted to smoke. Get outside, put my headphones in, and just started walking. By the time I finished I forgot why I started in the first place!

Also, having a reward system for yourself is a good motivator! I calculated how much money I spent per month on cigs, and if I made it through the week or the month without smoking, I would allow myself to get a treat. A pedicure, a new clothing item, something I usually wouldn’t spend money on because I was wasting so much of it on my habit 

Best of luck to you! You can do this!!! I also suggest downloading the app QuitNow, it’s a tracker and I still have it on my phone now"
kasshaaa,fe9j156,t1_fe9c47l,"They're all excellent suggestions I will probably put into practice, thank you!"
PabloPaniello,fe7hsl4,t3_eo29we,"God bless man. I saw it several times with my mother, who never could kick ‘em - until lung cancer took her, to the sorrow of her still-young grandchildren.

You got this buddy.  It’s worth it.  You can do it."
kasshaaa,fe95xrz,t1_fe7hsl4,"I'm sorry about your mother, I was worried about lung cancer my last couple of months smoking because my breathing became difficult and laboured, thankfully it was just my asthma playing up severely. I did only just find out about the asthma tho, two day ins and I can breath great again, and thank you."
skatefishjam69420,fe8o9yq,t3_eo29we,"You can do this!

However, if you do fail, try again, and don’t stop trying.

When I quit I had to try over and over cause I’d bum one or something and for me just one always leads to more.  Eventually it stuck and it’s been about 2.5 years, even when I’m blackout drunk I don’t smoke.  I never crave em but I still dream that I’m smoking sometimes.  It’s like a nightmare that my quit failed, I wake up mad that I screwed up lol.

It gets easier after 1-2 weeks.  You can do it!"
kasshaaa,fe96sfu,t1_fe8o9yq,"Thank you! I started trying to quit in the new year, and failed 3 or 4 times but decided to stick with it rather than just giving up completely. This is my year to do this. I have to do it. My main concern is when I drink, do you have any suggestions for that?"
skatefishjam69420,fe9y5or,t1_fe96sfu,"Maybe initially don’t drink in situations where it’s easy to bum one.  I was fortunate in that I’d moved 1.5 years prior and none of my new friends smoked.  It was like my one friends friend smoked and ending up drinking with him would mess up my whole week or so of not smoking multiple times.  I’d also say that it’s advisable not to drink heavily for awhile.

If you’re still having cravings while sober, it’s prob risky to drink in large amounts, or with people who will be smoking.

Another thing I did would be letting myself eat out, or buying myself a nice thing.  I.e “well, if I smoked idve spent $30 this week, I’ve been good about quitting, I can afford to treat myself to dinner/a new shirt/ etc.”"
kasshaaa,fe9z71m,t1_fe9y5or,"Thank you, this is great!"
ArminoKink,fe8gkzz,t3_eo29we,"This will go on for at least 10 days during which you will feel tempted to smoke over and over...afterwards you will feel gradual relief but the sudden cravings will still be present for up to two years...it is very important to be psychologically prepared for such moments so you do not relapse...any amount of nicotine will reinvigorate your cravings and ruin the whole thing so its very important to remain steadfast....a good mental trick is to delay smoking for 15 minutes whenever the cravings seem overwhelming as they never last for more than 10 minutes; its a lot easier to delay for 15 minutes than  forever....after about 2 years you will stop feeling any cravings, a couple more and you will start to forget you were ever a smoker....Its one of the hardest things you will ever do but it is totally worth it, you will finally be free from this disgusting addiction.

Good luck!"
kasshaaa,fe96hsd,t1_fe8gkzz,"Thank you! I got a medication to make sure I can survive the cravings, my doctor has been extremely helpful with all of this but it's still hard. I know this may be one of the hardest things I ever do in my life and it will be well worth it. I'll no longer have yellow nails and skin on some fingers, or smell like a chimney. 

Someone actually told me I smelt nice today."
ArminoKink,fe9ssvi,t1_fe96hsd,Cheers!
jcmacon,fe8ob93,t3_eo29we,"I smoked for 26 years, quit the minute my son was born. Hardest thing I had done to that point, worth it more than words can say. 

I don't stink any more, I can breathe better, food tastes amazing, life feels cleaner without ash trays. I loved smoking, but I am so glad I quit."
kasshaaa,fe96znk,t1_fe8ob93,"Your son will also be happy you quit, even if he doesn't know about it. Hearing how happy people are that they've quit, is really helping my motivation to not give in, thank you."
jcmacon,fe9jhoq,t1_fe96znk,"I promise you will get to the point where smoke nauseates you. This is why ex-smokers are the worst non-smokers. I could never go back to smoking. My kids all know that I smoked, I use the experience as a teaching moment to explain things like addiction, cost/benefit analysis, and to show that I am human and made mistakes and crappy choices just like everyone else."
kasshaaa,fe9l1kl,t1_fe9jhoq,"I honestly cannot wait for that point. Loving with smokers is truly showing my will power however, and pricing my want to do this. 
I'm glad you've chosen to share all that with your kids, that is amazing."

kasshaaa,fe9aadq,t1_fe8eoin,Thank you! I'm really hoping so. All the ex smokers I've spoken to now hate the smell more than a non smoker.

rachelsqueak,fe8rl6o,t3_eo29we,"Smoked from age 12-19. For the last maybe two years of my smoking, I would smoke between .5-1 packs per day. I quit because I was pregnant. I used nicotine gum the first week or two, and then one day I just didn't pop any gum. Next month will be my one-year anniversary of quitting smoking. (Feb 11, 2019 was my last cigarette.)"

I'm on the medication, and I was going to ween off using a nicotine replacement but the last time I did that on the medication I failed HARD so instead I've done cold turkey. It's sucks ass, but u know it'll be well worth it."

Maxymus5573,fe8s46c,t3_eo29we,"My advice is to be careful when drinking, from my experience after a few beers I begin trying to justify having ‘one more cigarette’ to myself, I’ve found it best to surround myself with good friends that I trust so that when I start getting urges at a party or whatever I have my friends to support me and get me past it."
kasshaaa,fe9b5aa,t1_fe8s46c,"I plan to avoid drinking for a while because I really don't want a relapse. I want to quit once and for all and be done with it.

What finally helped me get over the hurdle was this book “The easy way to quit”- sounds corny I know, but it really helped. It changes your programming about smoking so you stop wanting it. 2.5 years nicotine free for me. you should check it out. good luck with everything 💪🏻"

opie2,fe8uhl1,t3_eo29we,"So I'm going to share my experience with you just in case it will help. But if I have one piece of advice for you, it's this: *do it one day at a time.*

I quit smoking about two years after I got sober. In both cases, I'd had a very powerful moment of clarity that if I did not stop doing this toxic thing to my body, **it would kill me.**

So when I was psychologically ready (that part is very important - are you ready? Do you really WANT to quit?), I talked to my doctor, made a plan, set a quit date, got myself onto bupropion (""Zyban""), got some gum, got a patch, and started to taper. I got myself down to three cigs a day, and the final day I had my last smoke, destroyed the rest of my paraphernalia (I was a hand-roller) and flushed all the tobacco down the toilet. 

I then went to bed and promptly had a panic attack. My first thought was ""I can never smoke another cigarette again for the rest of my life"" and I started freaking out. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a voice came into my head - a literal, audible voice - and said ""just quit for the day tomorrow. You can do that."" 

**I knew immediately that I could successfully not smoke for just one day. Anyone can do that.** All of my anxiety melted away, and I fell into a deep sleep.

Just rinse and repeat. It's been 18+ years."
kasshaaa,fe9df0j,t1_fe8uhl1,"Congratulations on 18+ years, that's awesome! And thank you for sharing your experience, I started worrying about my lung health because I was struggling to breath so I went to my doctor and we set out a plan as well, and thank you for your advice. One day at a time, I can successfully not smoke for a day."

It's fucking hard, and my head is aching like no fucking tomorrow, the sweats are disgusting and gross, and I just want to throw up but I know that this will only last a couple more days and then I'll feel better than I have in years.

theaceofshades26,fe8w18d,t3_eo29we,"Oh my god, I completely feel you!!!! I turned into someone else the first couple of weeks. I had some emotional breakdowns over the tiniest things. Like the washing up, loo roll, traffic, having to get petrol.... even the sound of someone breathing pissed me off. 

I cried over the most stupidest things, and angry cried ALOT. My poor boyfriend... bless him, probably thought I’ve turned into some crazy person. 

But, it does get better. I promise. I’m now 4 months free of no smoking. My sense of smell and taste is unbelievable! I forgot how much I missed out on, and plus the money I’m saving is making things so much worth it. 

Believe in yourself, and do it only for you. Don’t give up smoking for anyone else, you’ll only be able to do it if it’s only what YOU want. Hang in there!!!"

kasshaaa,fe9bzp7,t1_fe8sxuh,"Thank you, I love this."
IIIDeadAgainIII,fe8t4et,t3_eo29we,"There is no shame in replacement therapy.  I used Altoids to quit after 25 years of smoking (been over 10 years now).  Good luck, you can do it."
kasshaaa,fe9c199,t1_fe8t4et,Thank you!
pentapri,fe8t54v,t3_eo29we,"Keep going, the first seven days really are the worst by far, that’s not a myth. After that it gets much easier! And congrats, stopping smoking is such a great decision to make."
kasshaaa,fe9c6wp,t1_fe8t54v,"Thank you, it's definitely not an easy road but it is a great decision to travel it. I'll feel much better for it."
matchb_x,fe8u1vx,t3_eo29we,"Keep trucking! When I quit, I just kept telling myself, ""this is the longest I've been without a cigarette"" and I didn't want to break the streak. You can do this! I've been nicotine-free for almost 12 years now (after having smoked for over 15) and I can honestly say it was one of the hardest things I've ever done and probably one of my proudest achievements. I will say, however, that I can never smoke again - I love it too much and I can't be trusted. One will always lead to another for me. Stay busy and stay focused."
kasshaaa,fe9cf2j,t1_fe8u1vx,"Thank you, and congratulations on 12 years, that's amazing! I've been doing the whole '1 day means I'm halfway to two, two means I'm halfway to four' and thinking that has made me realise that I am proud of myself for doing this, and the longer I last the prouder and happier I will be. I can do this."
matchb_x,fe9l044,t1_fe9cf2j,"It just feels good not to feel slave to something, y'know? It's all fun and games when you're starting, but in the end it feels like such a handicap. Cheers to good health in 2020!"
kasshaaa,fe9l629,t1_fe9l044,"I didn't realise how much of a hold on me or had till now, I refused to believe I was addicted. But feeling the way I do now, loving through the hell of withdrawal really proves to me how bad if had me in its clutches. Never again."
Suliux,fe8u81y,t3_eo29we,"I am with you.  Stopped as a New Years resolution, which never work for me.

That said I am still going strong with only a couple of drags off of someone else's cig in 13 days.

I wish I was cold turkey but I am using gum.  It sucks but I do feel better physically, must keep that in focus.  Going to the gym and working out helps to flush the toxins and feel better about myself.

We can do this!"
kasshaaa,fe9cti2,t1_fe8u81y,"We can do this! Cold turkey sucks, the withdrawals have made me think of relapsing, what has kept me from doing that is I've made it so I physically cannot buy any, and I've been keeping myself busier than a bee, especially at work which was one of my biggest triggers."
Suliux,fe9mxrp,t1_fe9cti2,"Good point, stay busier.  I have noticed a bit more energy and drive to be busy too.  Ride that wave"
arlomilano,fe8w89u,t3_eo29we,"It's gonna be hard right now but in a couple of months or years, it's gonna be so much easier and your body will thank you for it."

Enkacomfarinha,fe8wy85,t3_eo29we,"My friend tried some physical stimulus to deal with some symptoms.

Cold shower for sweat (also she said it calmed her a lot when she felt anxious)

Chewing ice also worked for nausea (sometimes she tried to eat some sweets, may work too if it's just psychological, but also made her puke most times, she felt better after though, so maybe?)

For headaches, cold towel on your eyes, it's the best thing I can recommend without any medicine.

Try some workouts and hot bath to relax your muscles before sleep, would help a little.

Well, that's all I can recommend to you to at least deal (a little) with your symptoms"
kasshaaa,fe9dw5i,t1_fe8wy85,"Thank you, I will definitely try some of these out."
cocoabiscuits,fe8x8dz,t3_eo29we,You got this! You will find a way through it and you already made your decision. It’s done.
kasshaaa,fe9e1c4,t1_fe8x8dz,"Thank you, and you're right, it is done. I don't want to smoke anymore. I will get through this, one day at a time."
lusberg,fe8y1el,t3_eo29we,"You can do it. You will love life like never before. Try to put it into perspective - when you manage the first few weeks, then imagine being smokeless for years. It will be easier than you think. You will thank yourself every day for the rest of your life."
kasshaaa,fe9e6yh,t1_fe8y1el,"Thank you, i may be cranky and emotional at the moment, but I know that's just the addiction. Once my body has cleansed itself, I'll feel better for it."
spoonbread28,fe8y443,t3_eo29we,Push through it. Soon you’ll enjoy the reward of overcoming cravings more than giving into them. You got this.
kasshaaa,fe9e7sx,t1_fe8y443,Thank you!
commonsenseulack,fe8zphd,t3_eo29we,"Keep going! I quit meth before cigs, quitting cigs is that hard. That being said, your health and your wallet will thank you. Take that money and buy something that can entertain you while you go through this. The physical aspect goes away quick it's the psychological part that is the most difficult. I picked up a mmo and played it for a couple months in order to keep my mind occupied. You got this!"
kasshaaa,fe9ehr2,t1_fe8zphd,"Congratulations on quitting meth, that would be hard. And cigs too, you're a trooper and a champion. 
I'm on a medication for the psychological aspect, and I'm planning to save the money for an overseas holiday to treat myself. Once I've made it through the withdrawal I'll definitely be throwing myself back into my MMO, I'll only have a month or so left before the new season and I gotta finish that content. Thank you."
Longsighter,fe8zvz4,t3_eo29we,"I pretty much was a hermit for the first week of my quit and kept socialising to a minimal for near 4 months in the beginning 

You're not a crazy horrible person you are doing something tremendiously difficult give yourself a break and be kind to yourself. You've got this!!!"
kasshaaa,fe9ep2e,t1_fe8zvz4,"Thank you! I think I'll start practicing self care again, and treat myself a little bit with all this money I'll be saving."
rnd1973,fe90aj4,t3_eo29we,It’ll pass. Be strong and you’ll love what you are after a few weeks.
kasshaaa,fe9epua,t1_fe90aj4,Thank you!
Pyramid_schmemez,fe90vj2,t3_eo29we,"One thing that helped me was candy, I’ve always had a serious sweet tooth, so whenever I was craving I’d eat something really sweet and consider that my “reward.”"
kasshaaa,fe9fkad,t1_fe90vj2,"Thank you, I've stashed gum and lollipops in the areas I am most triggered. My work drawer may turn into a candy store soon."
Pyramid_schmemez,fe9n3w7,t1_fe9fkad,Definitely helps lol. Chewy things tended to help me more like sour patch kids
lilCEEsir,fe917hw,t3_eo29we,Good job! Keep going it will get better!

NoobieTheNoob,fe91d5a,t3_eo29we,"I heard that it is easier to overcome cravings by keeping yourself busy doing something. You can also use nicotine gums and patches to reduce withdrawal symptoms. Read more about them here:

kasshaaa,fe9fr4e,t1_fe91d5a,"Thank you, I've been doing my best to keep busy, and it really does help."
Sweet_N_Vicious,fe92hv5,t3_eo29we,Good luck on your journey and kudos to you for taking care of your health.  My Dad quit smoking June 2019 and he's been smoking for 40 years.  You can do it!!!
kasshaaa,fe9fvg0,t1_fe92hv5,Thank you! Hearing that someone quit successfully after 40 years shows me I really can do this.
AppState1981,fe92j68,t3_eo29we,"I smoked for 10 years and just walked away after I had my wisdom teeth out. I didn't have any withdrawal. When I got a craving, I went for a walk. What amazed me later was the ability to really taste food. That was a wow moment. 

When I quit, there was a pack of smokes in my car and on  my table at my apartment. I didn't want anyone to know I was quitting. I just decided I would not pick one up. One thing that helped was going to work. It kept my mind off it."
kasshaaa,fe9gc40,t1_fe92j68,"Thank you, work really helped today. There were a couple of moments it was hard because I used to smoke the most at work, but my workload at the moment will make it a lot easier."
AppState1981,fe9p6su,t1_fe9gc40,You'll be glad you quit. It can kill you in a variety of ways
amiselfish-1019,fe92r7z,t3_eo29we,"hey, you got this."
kasshaaa,fe9gcue,t1_fe92r7z,Thank you!
Drakendan,fe92wpb,t3_eo29we,"You can do it, it takes time but you will see more and more health benefits coming up.  
I heard in the past of an advice, that is, to drink as much orange juice as possible (that doesn't mean simply filling yourself up to explode, but rather drink it daily and/or regularly in a healthy amount). This should help in refilling your body with vitamins and repair a bit better during the ordeal."
kasshaaa,fe9gi5o,t1_fe92wpb,Thank you!
Hara-K1ri,fe92y1k,t3_eo29we,"Stay strong man! Cold turkey is a bitch, but it's rewarding.

My mom managed to quit this summer, while on vacation. She smoked her last within the first week (of a 2 week vacation). The different, very relaxed environment helped her out a ton, doubt she would've managed without it.

I went the e-cig route, and eventually just left the bugger in the cupboard. I wasn't missing anything, but I had nothing to do with my hands, and the moments I would go out and smoke / vape had to be replaced. I replaced it by taking my book, sitting on a bench outside and reading a few pages. Then went back inside, grabbed a glass of water and things were better.

It'll be way better next week. And you'll feel yourself get better and better in the coming weeks. Find something to refocus when the tension is too high. Keeping yourself busy at the moments where you're ""programmed"" to smoke is especially worthwhile."
kasshaaa,fe9gqr8,t1_fe92y1k,"Thank you! I might take your suggestion on reading, I love reading. Awesome to hear about both you and your mum!"
jennylake1998,fe939ma,t3_eo29we,You can do it! My mom died from small cell carcinoma. Trust me the pain you are going through is nothing compared to dying from smoking related illness.
kasshaaa,fe9guea,t1_fe939ma,"Thank you, you're very much right. Withdrawal is no where near as bad as what it could be if I had continued."
RyanKl,fe93xwr,t3_eo29we,"I have a dad that used to smoke a lot and recently quit and he went through the same things you did, random emotional outbursts and periods of sadness; however I’ve never seen him healthier ever since he quit. He’s breathing better, being more active and is generally more happier. I think he’s also happy how he doesn’t have to take random smoke breaks at times we are together.
Stay strong! I know your close friends will understand your struggle of trying to quit, you have my support as well!"
kasshaaa,fe9gyrd,t1_fe93xwr,"Thank you so much! It's awesome to hear about your dad as well, Incan make it through this."
DanGorst,fe947vs,t3_eo29we,"Read ""The easy way to quit smoking"". It made cold turkey not only painless, but enjoyable."
kasshaaa,fe9h15j,t1_fe947vs,"Thank you, this is my next book to read!"
DanGorst,fe9oq16,t1_fe9h15j,It does a really good job of reversing the mental brainwashing that occurs as a smoker. As long as you follow the rules he sets in the book by the time you finish it you'll never look back!
Binxthekitty,fe948fy,t3_eo29we,"Hey  firstly well done for making the leap and decision that will change your life for the Better! I’m 5 years smoke free and the first week (like yourself) I was a monster. It’s okay, day 3/4 it gets easier, it really does. You won’t need to constantly amuse your hands or
Distract yourself, WELL DONE I am proud of you internet stranger. There is a mobile app that tells you how your body is mending within hours and days of not smoking.."
kasshaaa,fe9k1k6,t1_fe948fy,"Congratulations on 5 years, I'm hoping to be able to say this come 2025. And thank you, it's really good to hear it will get easier in a couple of days. I'm using my quit buddy to help track my hours smoke free, and I'm pretty sure it tells you how your body is mending. Thank you again."
j18rob,fe94bgd,t3_eo29we,"Day 1 through 3 are hellish. But you will begin to feel way better on day 4 and it just continues to get better.

You can go online and play around on Google to find sites that tell you the changes that happen in your body day by day when you stop smoking. This helped me stay the course. 

Well done and the very best of luck to you."
kasshaaa,fe9jwid,t1_fe94bgd,"I have one of those sites favourite to look at when I feel week, and it's good to know I'm halfway through the worst. Thank you, this really helps."
AwkwardName283,fe94hnm,t3_eo29we,Stay strong buddy. Cold glasses of water helped me relieve the crave when it got stronger. Make sure to drink enough and eat some veggies even if you might not taste much in the next days. It sucks for now but it's definitely worth it. If you're the guy for it go to a sauna. They're supposed to held idk. Though. Didnt try that.
kasshaaa,fe9ju60,t1_fe94hnm,"Thank you! I eat veggies every night for dinner, and drink 2lts of water per day so knowing this will help, helps."
BlackLabel6661,fe94ogd,t3_eo29we,"YOU CAN DO THIS!!

I also have asthma on top of that I was born a premie, so I was advised by doctors that I REALLY shouldn’t smoke, cause ya know? My lungs suck. I used to smoke Marlboro reds, because growing up and seeing my dad smoke, I guess made me want to, and he used to smoke a pack a day!!

Anyway, luckily I don’t have an addictive personality, so I was able to quit easily when I said enough was enough. I’m going on 1 month, and I feel so much better. I can actually take a deep breath and not cough so much. I can smell and taste better. I also don’t have the lingering smell of cigs on my clothes. I must say though, it was difficult the first few days, especially with being irritated at practically nothing. You’ll get over it.

Just stay strong. Your lungs will thank you.

Edit: no matter how long you last as a non-smoker. DO NOT bum a cigarette thinking that you can handle one. I was at a bar awhile ago (after not smoking for some time) people were smoking cigs out in the patio. I bummed 1 cig off of someone while I was drunk, and ended up buying a pack after leaving the bar. It’s not worth it. Plus, they’re expensive. Another thing. I’m sure you know this but cigs also stain teeth. I just thought that happened to chain smokers, nope. I would smoke a few cigs a day, and sure enough my teeth are less white than I remember. I can literally see the stains, especially on my front teeth. Buy whitening strips from crest 3D, if that happened to you."
kasshaaa,fe9jqkz,t1_fe94ogd,"Thank you! And congrats on hitting a month! How good is taking a deep breath? It's been weeks and it's soooooo good to be able to breath properly again. 

Thank you for the advice on bumming smokes, I have been tempted to living with smokers but this just roots in what I already thought, it's not worth it. 

I became meticulous about brushing my teeth when I started smoking to help with the stains the best I could. I might get some whitening strips tho"
WhyDiner,fe95qqk,t3_eo29we,Please hang in there.  This weakness will pass and you will soon feel empowered.
kasshaaa,fe9jgp9,t1_fe95qqk,Thank you!
Daisy_Doll85,fe95ukn,t3_eo29we,"I am quitting as well. Today is day 9. Also hell. But we can do this! Day 9 is already so much easier than my day 2 was. If you ever need someone going through it too, feel free to reach out."
kasshaaa,fe9jfvp,t1_fe95ukn,"Thank you, and bless you. We can do this, and it's great to hear day 9 will be easier even if it is still hell."
Daisy_Doll85,fe9jicg,t1_fe9jfvp,"We can do this, and we will!"
medicmachinist38,fe9anbe,t3_eo29we,"Good luck friend. Doing the same myself.  Reading “quitting smoking the easy way” and really hoping it does the trick.  Some dude on a completely unrelated post I read recently said when he was quitting, whenever he got a craving to smoke, he did pushups.  I thought that was really interesting and plan on trying that myself.  Good luck to you"
kasshaaa,fe9j9sz,t1_fe9anbe,"Good luck to you as well, we can do this and we will feel better for it. Many people on this thread have suggested this book, so I'm also going to give it a read. We got this."
LadyMontenegro,fe9ekew,t3_eo29we,"Keep it up. I smoked from 13 to 28 and from 30 again to 36. Second time was actually easier. The first time I struggled for 3 weeks, 2nd time round the first 3 days were the worst. After that I got sick with the flu and wouldn't have been able to smoke anyway. Stay strong. All worth it."
kasshaaa,fe9hzx7,t1_fe9ekew,Thank you!
Tim-Martin,fe9fm48,t3_eo29we,"Proud of you. Not something I have done personally,  but I have heard horror stories of quitting. Stay strong. Also maybe keep a journal during this time. Write down all the horrible aspects of the withdrawal, then write the good things you notice after. Your sense of smell,and taste improving your ability to breathe improving etc  then when you are having moments of weakness in the future when you want to have a smoke, review the journal, remind yourself of the horrors of quitting, as well as what you are losing by beginning to smoke. It also may help you as you work through the moments now to see the little steps that you are moving forward in you moment by moment struggle to quit. Stay strong. Again proud of you."
kasshaaa,fe9i3oi,t1_fe9fm48,"Thank you, this is a great idea!"
Tim-Martin,fecq1za,t1_fe9i3oi,Hope it helps. All the best to you.
Artchantress,fe9h1d8,t3_eo29we,"Oh, the second day is the most painful! Like actual physical lung/soul pain. But since nicotine is not like opiates, the physical detox part will be pretty much over and done with by the 4th day. Really. You'll be free and done, from your body's perspective.

Later, when a cig seems like a nice little change/treat/helper, remember the pain on the second day, and how you promised never to put yourself through it again.

 The rest will be psychological habit releasing. Some therapeutic side-practices for habit releasing will be game changers."
kasshaaa,fe9idtq,t1_fe9h1d8,"Thank god this hell physically is almost over, thank you for this. This will really help keep me going strong.  I'll definitely look into habit releasing practices or form better, healthier habits."
hemprope00,fe9itxc,t3_eo29we,"Maybe try just replacing the nicotine instead? Use gum or lozenges. I'm not doctor but I think doubling up is safe if you need too as well.

It's up to you OP. I just hope that you know you have a failsafe to fall back on."
kasshaaa,fe9krqy,t1_fe9itxc,"I thought about using replacements when I decided to quit, and I was using one for a little while but then I was using it on top of smoking so I realised it was best to cold turkey, thank you for the suggestion tho really."
hemprope00,feaajya,t1_fe9krqy,"Alright. Well it's good you're watching yourself like that. Don't worry, long term you're making one of the best decisions of your life."
slowest-cheetah,fe9j8sa,t3_eo29we,Me too. It’s a lot harder than people realize. I’m about a week and a half in and yes it is getting easier. Don’t give up!
kasshaaa,fe9kul9,t1_fe9j8sa,"Thank you! We got this. I'm glad to hear it gets easier, I can do another day, and then I'll try for another day, and just keep taking a day at a time."
slowest-cheetah,fea4aif,t1_fe9kul9,Even just a week without a cigarette feels really good. It’s easier to breath. I’m already noticing little differences when I run up stairs. When I wake up it doesn’t feel like I’m drowning in tar. My breath isn’t constantly rank. My car smells better. It’s totally worth it and that’s what’s keeping me from giving in.
mercer3333,fe9jd7o,t3_eo29we,Try taking the guts out of a pen and just using the outside to breathe in with.

chippyx3,feaehnm,t3_eo29we,"I stopped smoking for the 5th time as of 1/11/2020. 

I went and bought a puff bar (5% nicotine) at a local vape shop. It 100% stopped my craving for cigarettes.  

Just wanted to share."
kasshaaa,feah925,t1_feaehnm,"Thank you, I tried nicotine replacements but found it increased my actual smoking if cigarettes. 

I'm really glad it stopped your cravings tho, that's awesome!"
chippyx3,fecouka,t1_feah925,"You’re welcome!

I heard whenever you have the crave to smoke is to take a little walk to help  keep your mind off it.

Good luck on your journey!! 

YOU CAN DO IT!!!"
mfalck1,feag1vg,t3_eo29we,"This is awesome - way to go!  My last ciggy was on NYE, when I started getting a cold.  All day NYD, I was laid up in bed.  I figured why not make this official.  13 days in now of not having one.

Yesterday was a hard one, but each day will get easier.  Stay strong and you can do this.  I believe in you."
kasshaaa,feahavj,t1_feag1vg,"Thank you, that's awesome to hear youre almost at two weeks. We got this."
mfalck1,feahmkz,t1_feahavj,You are taking the right steps.  Way to go!!!
mujer_perdida,feahl3k,t3_eo29we,Amazing! You can do this! I quit six years ago and it was the best thing I ever did.
oldheadnightmare,feahmou,t3_eo29we,"Don't look at how far you have to go, remember how far you've come. Two days without nicotine is better than I've gotten in a very long time! (ex smoker, current vaper) If you've come this far already, you can definitely make it to tomorrow, then the next day and the next. Then a week, a month, a year! I'm always happy to hear someone accomplishing the things I cant quite find myself able to do yet. Best of luck to you from a fellow former smoker!"

lotusblossom60,feawiw4,t3_eo29we,"Takes about two weeks to be normal. Never smoke again. Not one drag. Every time I did, I started smoking again. Buy tons of gum, it will help."
kasshaaa,feb3m2q,t1_feawiw4,"I plan to never touch nicotine again, I made this post purely to remind myself of how I currently feel to make sure I never touch it again. I've almost gone through a pack in two days just at work, it has been amazing!"
SuccessfulSpirit1,fec11xe,t3_eo29we,"I quit packs of boges (half a pack a day) down to about 3 on average.  On a heavy day I smoke 5.  I managed this by buying a large bag of tobacco, some top rolling papers and top filters.  I don't have a rolling machine, and I don't roll more than one at a time.

I found that having ready to smoke cigarettes in my pocket, at my disposal all day was causing me to smoke when I didn't really want to.  So, now that I have to sit down and roll up a boge I am smoking 75% less on average.  

I haven't quit fully, but I think this will help when I actually decide to quit.  

Congrats and I admire you, I just watched my GPA die of cancer and if he didn't have COPD or breathing issues from decades of smoking, he might have been able to beat the cancer.  I thought that would make it difficult to smoke but somehow it's made me want to more"
kasshaaa,fecopo7,t1_fec11xe,"I switched to rolling to help myself cut down, and in the beginning it work but Nicotine is a hell of a drug.
Thank you! I was started to have breathing difficulties which I think is what kicked my butt into motion to finally just stop. Thankfully it was just my asthma playing up, probably didn't help that my country is burning so the air was more smoke than oxygen. 
It's not easy to stop, but when you fully want to, you will."
SuccessfulSpirit1,fecr4m5,t1_fecopo7,"Yea I been rolling my own for probably a year now and I've saved a killing on $ and saved my lungs a lot too.  Seriously I mean a pack is 10 dollars where I live, so essentially 50 cents a boge.  I calculated the cost of the weight of tobacco  I roll now and it's 4 pennies per roll up.  Maybe 46 cents doesn't sound like a lot but it adds up to thousands quickly

More power to you big homie and best of luck!"
Inuwa-Angel,fec6t2s,t3_eo29we,I wish you the best!

GalacticCracken,fece9uv,t3_eo29we,As a smoker since 15 (am 24 now) the first week is pretty tough but just stay grounded in reality. Try not to think about it. Just don't smoke. Take hot showers to try and coax some sweat out and that should take care of the nicotine in your system. And run if you can.

We raise our own animals & I gotta tell you, our health has never been better. We know exactly what they eat & the toys they play with. Taking care of them gives us exercise, purpose, & joy. In return, they give us the most healthy & amazingly delicious food possible. They get a life of being spoiled silly & quick/fast/clean death. 

Don’t get me wrong, fruit & veggies are still great. Just saying, you got options as far as being balanced goes."
BalkanRay,fdr6f52,t1_fdr4ymh,"Well i live in Finland and most animals are free grown with healthy manners ( basically they are free and not in cages or some shit ) i think i'm gonna support those small local farms !

I couldn't kill my own animals anyways xDDD

&#x200B;

But yeah most halal meats are also healthier than most meats, but idk i'm just gonna support local farms around here ( after all finland is a clean and healthy place to eat ).

&#x200B;

AND YES i will eat fruits and veggies, i will eat even more than today from now on !! But i just gotta eat meat 2-3 times a week or i will just die and be hopeless xD i will probably feel sorry and do an extra pray for eating meat but yeah.. if god wants me to be happy then i guess me eating meat and feeling NORMAL requires that, i will only eat chicken though, nothing else :3 i don't like other meats except fish and chicken."

Also, you know it costs waaay more recources to give a cow a ""normal and humane"" life then in mass production? It costs way more land, food, time and care. The land could be used to grow something and the food to feed humans. The time and care could be spared and put into more important things."
kiingkiller,fdx4fpv,t1_fdx0mm0,"yes we kill them before it hurts for them to walk, before they start getting terminal illness that leave them in agony or worse for months or even years.   
  
it acutely doesn't when you factor in how much the customer pays, your typical mass produced steak is around £6, our steaks are £20, we can afford to give them large amounts of land, time and care because people are willing to pay for a cow that has been well cared for because it produces a better cut of meat.  
  
crops are much much harder to grow than you think especially on the scale we are talking, bad weather, diseases, just general low yield. with animals we have far better control over the quantity and quality, we have drugs that can cure many animals illnesses far better than we can a plants, we can breed as many as we are expected we will need plus extra. plus there isn't really a window when its possible to harvest the meat unlike plants.  
  
there are a million things people could do that are more important that what they are doing with there lives right now but they do it because their passionate about it, its all they know or there are no other options.  
do i wish we could all live on a vegan diet? yes but we are a species designed to be omnivores, we are suppose to have a large variety of food sources to ensure that we can survive when we lose access to some and some peoples bodies simply can not survive on a vegan diet."

Relatable. I killed my healthy sister because I feared that she will get cancer once and will suffer even more. Don't worry though! It was quick!

And to your other points: Easier doesn't mean better. Yes, I do think crops are easier. Maybe it's hard if you have animals and crops but if you can concentrate on farming it will be easier. Though I don't specify in farming.

Why do you have animals there anyway? Did they consent? No. Do you think they would want to be there if you told them that they would die? No. You force them to stay at your farm, you force them to breed, you force them to exist. Who made you think you are superior to them? I think it's unfair we exploit creatures that have emotions but can't talk."
kiingkiller,fdxc8k8,t1_fdx7vbe,"we are talking about cows aged 17 to 20, that puts them in their 70s/80s, they have maybe 2 years left and that's with constant care and monitoring that they won't be able to go out and graze, they will be kept in the stall until they die, what life is that? id rather go still being able to stand and take care of my self rather than spend my final days stuck in bed with machines keeping me alive.  
  
crops are far more complicated becase they take up far more land based on their yield and a cows yield, a cow needs maybe 25 m2, were as to prodice the same amount of food you need about a quarter acre and they are 100% dependent on you, a cow can take care of it self, it will keep it self fit, it will eat what it need. and also if i need to move for what ever reason, i can just get a rope and walk the cow to the new place, its a lot more complicated moving a quarter acre of crops.  
  
what should we do instead? release all of the cows and live stock we have? have millions of animals flooding the country side destroying local wild life then them selves dying do to the lack of food that they can eat and survive off, we can't stop because if we did we would cause a mass extinction event.  
they have no consept of being forced or even really of death, if primates some of the smartest animals on the planet struggle to grasp the concept of not knowing something do you really think a cow can understand the idea that is just food and its being well treated then slaughtered?  
  
we are superior because we created this world, we can fly with out wings, breath under water with out gills, we can replace parts of our selves to stay alive. we are Apex predictors."

squishy_worms,fdrc55f,t1_fdr9ho4,"Veganism is healthy if done right, *but it also just doesn't work for everyone,* and that's okay. Just because it didn't work for you doesn't mean it won't work for others; it can be a perfectly healthy diet, you just have to educate yourself on what you need, and pay attention to how your body is reacting to the change. You realized it didn't work for you, and that's fine, there's no need to push the idea that veganism is unhealthy for everyone. People just need to learn how to respect other's choices, especially when those choices won't affect them at all.

Also, the trick is to not be in those vegan communities. I had to leave the vegan subreddits here (except shitty-vegan-food-porn) because so many of them are hateful. I don't want to go through life demonizing all non-vegans, and it seems like that's what a lot of them do.. in the real world, vegans aren't that bad.

Today my mom added a bit chicken to my rice/vegetables plate, i immediately felt super alive after like 30 minutes. EVERYONE around me was so happy too because of me.

thundersass,fds07zh,t1_fdrtd4i,"Well that's not really quantities, so let's estimate. I'm American so wrote this using cups before I remembered you're in Finland, but a cup is about 150g.

4 slices of bread, about 280 calories. I'm guessing your cream was maybe 190, so that's 470 there. The salad most of your calories are from avocado and oil. About 234 for an avocado, and I'll be generous and say you were getting 200, of oil. Between the kale, cabbage, and tomatoes you likely had around 80 calories total if you ate a lot. So dinner was 984, not bad.

Rice is about 200 per cooked cup, so if you ate a couple of cups a day that's 400. Add in 160 for potatoes, and I'm going to guess 400 in beans and lentils. That puts us at 1,944 with what I suspect are very generous estimates. I'll leave it up to you how much you ate in the rest. Sunflower seeds are about 269 calories for a cup if you get them with hulls. A cup of walnuts is 183, or 654 if they're shelled. Each serving if fruit is around 100. 240mL, or 8 oz, of almond milk is around 40 calories. 

I don't know how many calories you ate before you went vegan, but that should at least help you get some kind of sense of how much you were eating. 

As far as protein, an avocado is about 2.9g, almond milk around 1g, kale is 2.9g per cup, a potato is about 4.3g, beans are around 15-20g per cup depending on the type (exception: chickpeas are closer to 40), sunflower seeds about 10g per cup, walnuts are about 4.3g per cup (15 for a shelled cup), bread was about 20g for 4 slices, and your fruits range from around .5 - 1.5g a serving. For comparison, 1 cup of chicken is around 40g protein and 330 calories.

You can do the math from there, you have a better idea of what you ate than I do. If you weren't getting as many calories or as much protein, that would likely contribute. Weight loss means your calories out were more than your calories in. I suspect you weren't eating as much as you thought you were, but since you never tracked it I can't say for certain."
GrandmaSlappy,fdt497j,t1_fdrtd4i,"Honey you need to learn how to cook some indian food! Salad could be ditched, easy way to fill up without calories. Anyway. Did you take any kind of supplements? What stands out to me here is the lack of iodine, iron, probably B12, and carbs. Omg you need more carbs. Carbs build muscles. You need to get down on some fine ass noodles and up in some seaweed snacks and make life easier with vitamins. Cut down on sugary fruits and milks. Not helping. I mean don't give yourself scurvy but those are a treat snack not to be eaten like a main part of your diet. Potatoes are also not great to fill up on. Don't try to fill up on veggies, but you do want a lot. Ditch the expensive almonds and sunflower seeds sooo tiny, get a big ass pile of peanuts. A creatine supplement would probably help with energy and muscles as well. 


Ditch the ""cream"" (no idea what that is) if it's some kind of fake cheese product, expensive!! Use like jam and peanut butter or something normal. I don't know what stores are like where you are, but don't ever buy anything marketed as a vegan meat/dairy/egg alternative. If you have Indian or Asian grocery stores that's where you get your good stuff for cheap. It sounds like you're wasting a lot of money on expensive nuts, greens, fruits, milk, and ""cream."" Being vegan should be cheaper than meat.


Are you changing up your bean types and rice dishes to keep them fresh and interesting? 


Maybe it would help if you don't rely on mom cooking for you and try it out for yourself? It might motivate you to look deeper.

GrandmaSlappy,fdt0unc,t1_fdrilj9,"TBH you should be doing actual nutrition research and not asking a bunch of randos on the internet, you know the internet is toxic. If you were struggling but intaking a lot of calories then your nutritional intake was probably missing key components. 

A lot of vegans eat oreos and french fries and stay nice and fat, it's not all about calories.

You really got to pay attention to getting the right  B12s, D, iron, carbs, proteins, fats, etc.

For every story about veganism making you feel crappy there's a story about veganism making someone feel great. It's not something you can just do thoughtlessly unfortunately and a lot people blame the lack of animal foods without knowing better.

There are plenty of vegan body builders, whole cultures that are vegan, living happy healthy lives. With nice strong muscles. 

If you're going to give it up, then please at least support ""clean meat"" (shmeat/lab meat) and non factory farm options, educate yourself about what happens to dairy cows, research environmental impact, and I hope we can at least agree that factory farms are not ok."

Like any way of eating, you ideally need to adjust your meals to what suits you best. Do your research.

Rufuslechien,fds1ooc,t1_fdrm5zy,"I’m glad you’re feeling better and found what works for you, however I’m quite skeptical that just adding a bit of chicken in one day could have an impact that quick. Unfortunately, that’s not how biology works. When you are deficient in certain vitamins and low on energy, it takes more than just one meal to make you feel better Perhaps it was more of a psychological reaction?

That shouldn’t in any way denigrate how much better you feel, I just question how scientifically valid the idea that making a piece of meat suddenly makes you feel better. There’s nothing magic in meat that you can’t find in plant-based alternatives."

readingreddit4fun,fdqm5y3,t3_eme4i8,"CONGRATULATIONS!!!!  I finally paid off my student loans in Dec 2018 and being debt-free for the past year has been so liberating emotionally as well as financially.

Like you, I have the kind of family members that started asking me for financial help.  My response is that I would teach them financial basics like how to create a budget, pare down their lifestyle, and stick to it to help them meet their financial goals.  When they refused that help, I was quick to let them know that's all the help I would give and haven't had any more requests for funds since.  

I would have been ecstatic if any of them had taken me up on the offer and probably would have invested far more time and effort to help them with their financial plans than they would have expected."

BRushingBot,emeu8f,top_level,I saw a video on twitter of a guy getting brutally gored by a bull (If I had known that's what was going to happen I definitely would not have clicked on it) and I'm still dumbfounded that people actually fuck with bulls. For you and a crowd of people to fuck with it so much it tries to kill you is ~~borderline~~ retarded and if you get killed its not the bull's fault its your own fault and you got what you deserved. I still feel bad for someone who gets killed by a bull (especially their family) but you're a fucking dead brain for doing that.
Liesymmetrymanifold,fdob1ti,t3_emeu8f,I think they all get put down anyways.  It's a horrible tradition.
AnimalLover162,fdpib4q,t1_fdpfi6h,"There’s a big difference between raising a cow to be used for milk and/or meat, and raising a bull into an industry where it’s essentially tortured and enraged and then killed for doing what its nature told it to do. Also there’s a big difference between cows and bulls in general (notably the penis but also I’m fairly sure bulls are only used for breeding when it comes to the meat and dairy industries)"
dragyoudown,fdq78ws,t1_fdpib4q,It’s funny that you think cows raised in the dairy and meat industry aren’t also treated horrifically.
AnimalLover162,fds7di3,t1_fdq78ws,"I never said they weren’t. But still, at least the cows there are being used for human benefit, amoral as it is. Bulls here are essentially being tortured and killed for entertainment, and I’m fairly sure their meat isn’t used afterwards."
River_woods,fdqa66k,t1_fdpls7e,"I mean, iddkkk, kinda sounds like they might know what they're talking about"
AnimalLover162,fdq5rmu,t1_fdpls7e,I mentioned the penis to get a laugh out of you but you’re such a hardass I’m not sure what I expected
dragyoudown,fdqaun4,t1_fdq8cnt,Lmao woooooow. What a hypocrite.
moonwoofchirpmeow,fdrqoel,t1_fdq5rmu,"So I was super against the running if the bulls but the land they use is considered to be equivalent to National Parks! I disagree with the whole situation but the one day if agony vs years of misery is a grey area.  Also, separating momma cows from their babies for milk is apparently pretty horrific.
Sources: National Geographic (?)"
AnimalLover162,fds7lsl,t1_fdqaun4,"I can love animals while also consuming meat and dairy. Also, don’t get me wrong, the dairy and meat industries have a ton of problems and animals there are treated horrifically. In fact, if I can someday, I’d like to support local farmers and butchers rather than corporations, in the hopes that local places treat their animals better. But there’s a distinction to be made between killing them for human usage and killing them for entertainment."
AnimalLover162,fds8wy5,t1_fds7wdd,"Oh, so you’re one of *those* vegans. Gotcha.

I’m not interested in taking up a vegetarian or vegan diet. Carnivores in the animal world eat other animals all the time. Humans are biologically omnivores. I’m allowed to eat meat. It’s also much more difficult to get the proper protein needed in a diet if meat products are cut out. I also don’t pay for my own food atm, still a high schooler.

Your claim that I don’t love animals just because I eat meat is completely illogical. Cows are one of my favorite animals, tbh, they’re fucking cute. Doesn’t mean I’m not gonna eat them. I like pigs too. And horses. And spiders. And snakes. And ladybugs. And koalas. The only animals I say I wouldn’t like are house centipedes, mosquitoes, and parasites like fleas, ticks, and leeches. So no, I don’t just love pets, because ladybugs and koalas and lions and shit aren’t pets. I can love animals while also understanding that, being an omnivore, I’m gonna like meat and I’m gonna do the best of my ability to support non-hurtful butchers and farmers when I can, but for right now I’m not cutting meat products out of my diet and risk making myself sick or lactose intolerant the next time I eat meat or dairy."
dragyoudown,fdsbhvp,t1_fds8wy5,"You can’t claim to love something and then contribute to its suffering. All I’m doing is pointing out the disconnect that you have (and it’s not just you, a lot of people who claim to love animals either usually mean they love pets or they don’t actually like animals as much as they claim they do). 

You’re young, so I understand that it’s harder to make your own food choices but I would ask you to consider reducing your meat intake where possible- if not for the animals, why not for yourself? For your future? Going vegan is one of the biggest things you can do as individual to reduce your impact on the environment, even reducing your meat intake makes a difference. 

Humans are omnivores, yes but humans also don’t need meat or animal products to be healthy- and if you can reduce the suffering you cause, why wouldn’t you choose not to?"
tomcthrowaway314162,fdo5szq,t3_emeu8f,"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
tactlesshag,fdohsdy,t3_emeu8f,"Kind of gotta agree with you on this one.  
Bullfighting is barbaric, inhumane and just cruel, IMO."
ringo77,fdom7tl,t3_emeu8f,"As someone who lives in Spain and has lived this tradition. I have to agree that bullfighting is pretty barbaric and I don't like it.

But there are multiple places where they only do the bull running part, and there are much better places to enjoy it than Pamplona (Since it is very short and overcrowded and they actually do the bullfighting later)

In bull running the bulls don't suffer any injuries (some people claim they suffer stress but, well, I would love to see any kind of scientific research about that) and they are killed at the end but they are used for food like any other cow/bull killed everyday in a slaughterhouse."
lorddio_,fdp5d4e,t1_fdom7tl,"It doesn't take a scientist to come to the conclusion that an animal feels threatened. A bull wouldn't run through a crowd, typical stampede behavior, if it wasn't scared. Not to mention people get gutted and it's just brushed off as something to expect. It's sooo disturbing that people are desensitized to this because it's a tradition. Is it really so bad to just run a 5k or something instead?"
Professor_Oswin,fdpao5t,t1_fdp5d4e,It is to be expected. You fucking run away from 300 lbs animals trying to maim you thinking you’re a predator. If you go into the bull run and act surprised if you’re gored then you’re a retard.
ringo77,fdrd85z,t1_fdp5d4e,"There are multiple activities where the risk is a lot higher and people still take part in them willingly and nobody would ask to make them illegal. 

The bulls run because they want to and when they are in a pack. Sometimes when they are alone and face big crowds they stand their ground, so seeing a crowd it's not the reason why they run. 

Can they suffer mental distress? Maybe, I don't know, and I don't think any study have been made about it, specially because it is a very difficult environment to do proper research on.

It varies from town to town, and while there are barbaric traditions with bulls in Spain, not all of them are like that."
lorddio_,fdpk34q,t1_fdpao5t,"This kind of drives the desensitization comment home, doesn't it? The key point was people ""brush it off"" which you affirmed with your response. The fact that there's a small chance you'll die while engaging in these festivities is something we should be critical of. Suicide is illegal in many places and this being an exception because people know what they signed up for speaks levels."
Spectralpoetess,fdppl7e,t3_emeu8f,"Honestly, if you piss off an animal and it reacts, that's your own damn fault. You don't see me going around harassing the local deer."
Splatfan1,fdpruss,t3_emeu8f,im ok with putting them down as long as the dipshits that fight the bull also get put down at the end
irregulargorrila,fdqkn6y,t1_fdpruss,"Well, afaik, getting gored by a bull means that your innards become outtards, so yeah, I guess they get put down, but maybe not in the sense you are thinking of"
SJWcucksoyboy,fdoqbow,t3_emeu8f,I don't get what this is about they put almost all of the bulls down whether or not they kill someone. Also if you care that much about bulls go vegetarian.
Krommel3,fdpfexo,t3_emeu8f,Lol... the cows for your burger and food get treated far worse than those bulls.

peeinyourtes,fdpqgzu,t1_fdpmlvt,buuuut vegetarianism is an option is all i’m saying
mrgrayrock,fdo80ur,t3_emeu8f,Was it a matador? It is fucked up in modern times but understand it is cultural as well.
BRushingBot,fdojrwd,t1_fdo80ur,No it was not a matador and I want to mention that just because something is a part of a culture does not automatically make it okay or the right thing to do.
mrgrayrock,fdolvzl,t1_fdojrwd,"True but as an outsider of the culture I feel pretty arrogant attempting to force my ideas of right and wrong. That's up to them. Do I still believe it to be wrong? Of course. But if an outsider takes it away from the culture, there's resent and nothing is really solved."
Greaterbird,fdozq6g,t1_fdolvzl,"I believe bullfighting is barbaric. 

The tough thing is that I also recognize many of my core beliefs of what is right and wrong are products of my culture, and that 50 years from now many things about our current culture will be considered outdated and barbaric by our descendents, or weak and pathetic, and they will be just as certain of their own morals.

SecondComingOfBast,fe2lube,t1_fe0wp99,Pluto also has about five much smaller moons that actually orbit it. Pluto and Charon actually orbit a shared center of gravity as opposed to Charon orbiting Pluto. It's more like they orbit each other. They are also tidally locked lke the Moon to Earth.

So I've worked on it for the last 15 or so years. I have gotten better at listening. I still prolly dominate 60/40. But yeah. 

Also I've noticed how annoying chatterboxes are. There is a guy at work- luckily he works at another location so we only have to see each other if someone is sick and we have to get back up. He's in his mid 20s and still does ""would you rather"" game just to keep talking. I find him annoying so I avoid talking to him. Apparently he finds my personality and talkativeness super annoying too and has been running his mouth about it. But then will come to my location and try and engage me in conversation

As one, we don’t even really want to annoy you (or that isn’t really the goal anyway), we’re just genuinely social people that want to get to know others on a better scale. Your remark makes it sound like you think we’re self absorbed and egotistical, when in reality it could be other reasons, like “maybe you should talk more BECAUSE you have a great personality”, or “maybe you should talk more BECAUSE you engage in interesting conversation.” To assume that the majority of us fit into that logic honestly breaks me, as I personally just want to show empathy for others.

There was nothing I liked better than to curl up with a good book or a puzzle. Yet I was well liked (I was a nice person) and usually one of the kids in the popular crowd. When I got older I found that after several days of socializing I needed a few days down time to re-group. Re-energize. The thing is as people oriented as I was, I never had a problem spending time with myself.   
Some compulsive extroverts just can't stand being alone. Some people get anxiety when they are with or around someone who's very quiet, hence those questions OP gets. They're just not very good at handling that. Their skill is much better at outward behaviors and compulsive conversationalists.

Because see, it's not about me and my opinion, It's about truth, lies, right, and wrong. As it should be.

So, that aside, what I find to be *THE* most annoying thing a person (or table full of people) can do is is as soon as I open my mouth to say something, they all turn (heads and shoulders) like hawks toward me, some with condescending, encouraging smiles. I think they think I'm stupid because I'm quiet mostly and they want to see how much of that is the case. Talk about a good way to cause someone to clam up. I can literally feel doors slamming shut in my head and heart. You want to say to them, It's not about us, it's about the subject at hand. Get your personal prejudices and peeves out of here.

ManateeJamboree,emnn9s,top_level,"As the title states, this happened many years ago. I was 17 going on 18 and am now *almost* 29. 

High school AP psychology. I had busted my ass studying for this exam and was ready. Not even ten minutes into the exam I notice the classmate to my right was copying my multiple choice answer sheet. Not only did I hate cheaters, but I hated this guy in particular. He was the classic popular guy in high school that cheated off of EVERYONE, and they knowingly let him! This kid wasn’t my friend...not even an acquaintance. In fact, he had always made fun of me and been an ass to me without reason. There was NO way I was going to let him cheat off me when I studied hard the night before and he had gone off to a party I wasn’t invited to (Friday morning exam.) 

Thankfully, we were given a blank sheet of paper. I am a leftie so this worked out well. I began to write the correct answers on my blank sheet (left side of desk) and bubble in the incorrect answers on my answer sheet (right side.) Classmate took the bait and proceeded to fill in all the correct answers. I waited for him to get up and turn in his test (while I pretended to check mine.) When he came back to his desk I looked him in the eyes as I erased almost all my answer sheet, I then started to fill in the correct options from my scrap paper. 

The look on his face was priceless. He turned beat red and called me a bitch. Now he didn’t quite shout, but it was enough for the teacher and surrounding students to hear him. The teacher looked in our direction angrily, but didn’t press the issue any longer as there were still students taking the exam. 

After class the student stormed out and the teacher asked to speak with me. She asked me if something had happened and I told her it was something outside of class and sorry for the disturbance. She trusted/ liked me because I was a good student and always very quiet. 

He ended up making something close to a 30% on the exam (failing terribly), whereas I scored 90% (A grade.) 

Unfortunately, this same kid ended up getting a FULL RIDE to college, after he cheated his way to the top. Still makes me mad to this day, but I’m glad I at least stood my ground and showed him I wasn’t some doormat.

EDIT: I should add...many teachers knew this students cheated but could never catch him in the act.

damnisuckatreddit,fdq2w5s,t1_fdq00fo,"No the point is that anyone who needs to rely on cheating to get a good high school GPA is gonna get fucking *destroyed* under the standards of any reputable university. Either they get wrecked over having no idea how to actually study, or they get their fool ass expelled thinking their cute little cheating act's just gonna keep working the same as always. You know what happens when you get expelled for academic dishonesty? Your school puts a flag on your transcript announcing you're a lying shitstain so you'll never be accepted to any decent institution ever again. And there's also a good chance you're required to pay back whatever money or fee waivers awarded. Being caught cheating *one single time* is all it takes to get expelled. 

Basically this dude very much did not win. Either he went to a school with low enough standards to let him get away with this kind of shit, in which case lol enjoy that worthless ""degree"", or he cheated his way into a top tier university only to immediately realize he'd fucked himself.

Also, sidenote: Most folks I've known who cheated extensively in school did so because of a crippling fear of failure - usually they had an anxiety disorder, abusive parents, or both. Kids who just don't give enough of a shit to study aren't gonna give a shit about their grades unless some kind of external pressure's forcing them to."

So finally one day, did the same thing as you, circled all the incorrect answers but put tiny dots by the ones I knew were correct. Waited for him to turn in test, erased and refilled correct answers. He stopped copying me after that.

We went to Kalahari and 4 of the top 5 (students with the highest gpa’s - all cheated aside from one who wasn’t a part of the 4) were assholes. They were the type of people who thought they were the shit and thought everyone thought that too, but everyone knew they were actual shit and ignored them for the most part. They always talked shit about people and always made fun of one of my friends who I stood up for every time I witnessed their shittslking (my friend was odd mostly because she has some form of mental illness -bipolar?? - and was also being abused by her adoptive mother who was also a cop! Go figure)

Anyways, the entire class was planning on drinking in the early am as every senior class does. Yea, I was in on it too! However, the top 4 was plastered by 7pm!! Running around like crazy, visibly drunk, running around the water park **holding the water bottles filled with vodka with them** ffs. 

I ended up taking care of them the entire night. Ruining my night and staying in their own room to make sure they don’t ruin others and get caught. There was one chaperone (who was the cheerleader coach and also one classmates mother -relevant) who helped take care of them as well and kept is hush hush because she’s a saint when it came to that part. 

My class had a group chat and we all agreed to keep this a secret because it wasn’t worth the hassle as we all knew that the top 4 wouldn’t get in trouble.

I found out through the grapevine that the cheerleader coach got fired. Why? How? Well, her daughter emailed the principle about the whole ordeal and got her mom fired.. but the top 4? Nothing, even when there was video proof that was shown to them (I was there when it was shown to them). Oh, and senior trips got permanently canceled for all future seniors. 

**Present day (2 years later):**
One of them got in trouble because he’s been spending his parents money that’s supposed to be used on college and living expenses on drag shows *in california* (we lived in a small town - graduated with 30 kids) and was threatened to be sent back to our hometown and find his way back to Cali. 

Another is in the same city as me and is living with my cousin (they’re dating). Who* cheated on him idk how many times and he knows this. Gl man. 

Another is being a sorority slut

And the last one wasn’t too bad. Just a person hanging with the wrong crowd and making dumb decisions. She was genuinely a nice person until she met them. Idk what she’s up to. (She’s also my cousin -distant. I have a big family)"

It was infuriating that not only was she copying off of me, she was being sloppy and drawing attention to it. I was worried that the teachers would see it and assume I was in on it so I told one of them what was happening. She did it again during the next exam while the teacher watched.

The fact is that US medical care is currently some of the most regulated, most restricted, and most abused healthcare system in the world right now and for it to be considered ""free market"" is absurd.  There are so many barriers to business startups, medication development, costs, testing, regulations, etc.

I'm certainly not ""hey lets let anyone become a surgeon"" but the industry as a whole clearly needs a serious pass with medical/economic/regulation planners and do a regulation/deregulation pass.

My opinion is that both need double the exam rooms and doctors at peak times (flu season, evenings, etc).  Or ideally, more doctors in offices would be less people going to urgent cares because their doctor is all booked. Another problem is we need more doctors having evening appointments because so many can't take off of work. 

My family has a tendency to go to a stand alone urgent care not affiliated with a hospital. They seem more affordable and let you make an appointment."

Having two hospitals within 20 miles of each other having a difference of 9 thousand dollars for the same procedure is a bit...excessive. Same with the cost of items being bought for cheap, affordable prices and being sold for 10-300x that cost for profit.  Both of these reasons increase medical costs for the user and the insurance provider.   


I'm fine with paying a bit more through tax than I currently am for insurance and having a hospital bill in the hundreds vs paying a bit less now and getting a bill for the ten thousands. Wouldn't you?

shannonalvaann,fe5btgu,t1_fe4ulrj,"A quick google search says that Canadians don’t actually pay much more tax than Americans, in terms of income tax. Average per capita tax in Canada is around 14k, while US is about 11k. Although we (Canadians) do pay a slightly higher sales tax. Looking at the social programs that we have available compared to the US is staggering, and from personal opinion living in the US is something no one could pay me to do. 

A funny thing that the good ol’ Americans choose to overlook or for some reason deem necessary is the 686.1 BILLION DOLLAR budget allocation from tax revenue that goes directly to the military. In comparison to the 25billion dollar Canadian military budget, I’m just floored.

Why don't you think you should have to call around for the best price and instead think that the best price should just be handed to you?  Its not even close to the best ""price"" your paying when you're taxed and you also don't get to determine your healthcare that you receive or the quality.

That is what you're saying, you're okay with absolutely zero choice in your care/provider/quality, and instead you want any old shitty service you get from the government with nothing to hold it responsible.

Yes; there are issues with insurance and healthcare, but its definitely not something that needs to be thrown out and with some reasonable tweaks and regulations and deregulations; we can fix it.

>You understand that an insurance company’s best case scenario is not having to pay for your treatment right?

No, the best case scenario for the insurance company is to keep you healthy for years and years making payments without any insurance charges on there.  Obviously reducing their expenditure is part of it, but that is why people should read and sign their contracts carefully and know what it covers.

>And most of the time a hospitals best case scenario is you needing whatever treatment they can inflate the price of the most?

I agreed with the first one, **THIS** comment is fucking absurd.  Doctors and nurses are not ordering care based on cost.  Ridiculous.

vs


10,000 firearm homicides a year (15,000 - 5000)

This one again makes no sense.  Also most of the people dying to firearms are dying to handguns in urban environments and mostly related to crime.

Also in relating to your ""why won't someone think of the children"" and your mass shooting comments.

Learn the difference between a mass shooter and an active shooter.

in 2018 in the US there was 27 active shooters in the US that killed 85 people.

5 of those shooters were at schools that killed 29 people.

29 people out of 340m people.

lyamc,fe6j4zb,t1_fe6da37,"Do you really think they are selling medicine at or below cost to insurance companies in the states?

Look at their profits. I doubt it.

Here's the thing. The company negotiates prices with the government. Once they reach a decision, they are guaranteed a certain volume which is what these companies need to afford building some of these manufacturing facilities, not price. They'll need a certain profit and as long as they hit that, the price/volume doesn't really matter. The consistency and the low volatility helps. Also, they only have to negotiate with the government. They don't need to hire a massive staff for all the negotiation between multiple insurance companies in multiple provinces.

So the cost savings come from being low-risk low-margin low-overhead vs high-risk high-margin high-overhead.

I haven't even gotten to the part where the multiple insurance companies in the states need to hire a large staff to negotiate with the drug companies and also a large staff to deal with hospital insurance claims and personal insurance claims. There is still tracking on the hospital side for money from the government, they use the health card number.

Also, because the doctors get paid per visit, whether you're sick or not, it encourages regular visits and check-ups which is a form of preventative care.

Also, because the government pays for your hospital stays and medical bills, they have an interest in making sure you don't have to visit the hospitals, so they will more likely promote healthy lifestyles, diets, exercises, and health information.

The **only** downsides are the following: \[1\] wait times are longer because emergency care is given to those who need it first, pushing you back. Since there's no cost in the visit, many people visit when they aren't in need of a doctor. \[2\] the lack of profit motive leads to a lack of additional services that would push people to visit your hospital in particular."

Is your illness imaginary? Because all you've been doing is asking hypotheticals that don't happen.

>Isn't that the point of the heavy taxation?

The point is to share the burden of insurance. He larger the share, the less the average individual burden.

>Your response is ""well, if its too expensive you can just buy it yourself!""  Absurd. 

That's not absurd. Price gouging is absurd which is what you have in the States so if you like that you can keep it.

>So you've sidestepped my discussion again; 

I haven't, you just don't like the answer. Look at drug prices in the States vs Canada and tell me why it costs less to buy drugs in Canada from American corporations.

>Lets say its a life saving drug that is being used every single day in socialized hospitals.  The cost for the manufacturer has doubled, and they double the price to compensate. The socialized system attempts to negotiate for a lower rate but the manufacturer refuses.

They have to renegotiate their contract. Those drugs won't just run out tomorrow.

If it's already covered in the socialized system, then the evaluation would have been done already so we know they'll need more. It happens.

What doesn't happen is doubling the price of the drugs. Well actually that happens in the USA. Because the insurance companies can't do squat and actually benefit from higher costs since now you NEED insurance or else.

>What now?

Well as you can tell by the fact that I've had healthcare all my life that we somehow haven't had a major collapse in our healthcare, have better life expectancy, and have less costs per capita.

------

Here's what I like to ask each American who doesn't understand: if little ol' Canada  can do it with our measly GDP, do you think your country could do it better?

Your taxes pay for firefighters and police, why not doctors?

Seems to be a silly distinction you guys have down there about what is acceptable to socialize and what isn't."
Meglomaniac,fe6yz30,t1_fe6xn1d,">1) How many people does it benefit (how many people have the disease)

Why does it matter?  In socialized systems all your illnesses get treated by the socialized system.  Why does number of people benefiting matter?

Unless you agree that socialized systems have spending decisions and treatment decisions to be made.

>2) How effective is it? Is it a cure or a managing the disease type thing?

Why does it matter?  If it passes the ""fda"" so to speak, then its effective.  

If the person is suffering, then you should provide the cure/treatment.

That is what they pay for, isn't it?

>3) If you really want it you can buy it.

Awesome, so I get taxed an obscene amount and then I'm responsible for paying my own healthcare?  

What is the point of paying such a high tax if the response is, well pay for it yourself?

>Is your illness imaginary? Because all you've been doing is asking hypotheticals that don't happen.

So this is actually a really important point.  In socialized medicine, are they treating my illnesses as they come up, or do they do triage and assess the cost/effectiveness of the treatment?

>The point is to share the burden of insurance. He larger the share, the less the average individual burden.

No, the point of the heavy taxation is to provide a socialized system that takes care of my healthcare needs and not hear a response of ""well, if you want it pay for it""  That's the fucking point of the taxes!

If the final response is well if you want it pay for it, then keep it fucking private!

>I haven't, you just don't like the answer. Look at drug prices in the States vs Canada and tell me why it costs less to buy drugs in Canada from American corporations.

Why does it cost less to buy drugs in Canada?  Because Canada negotiates as a large group and refuses access to 26m citizen unless they cut a deal?  Of course this is going to be cheaper vs a private system.

However; you do continue to avoid my point of what happens when they refuse to provide those drugs at the price you want and there is an impasse.

>They have to renegotiate their contract. Those drugs won't just run out tomorrow.

So ""they have to renegotiate their contract"" yep, but they don't have to sign it.

What happens when there is no deal, and no drugs in your country?  Its urgently needed but you're not able to find an agreement with a private company.

What happens then?  Both parties refuse to agree, the company to provide the drugs and Canada to pay the price they demand.

>Here's what I like to ask each American who doesn't understand: if little ol' Canada can do it with our measly GDP, do you think your country could do it better?

No, I think an american socialized system would be an un-mitigated disaster and they should simply reform the private system.

**now** Directly answer my question;

What happens in a socialized system when they are unable to come to an agreement with a private company for needed drugs that are developed and researched in another country?"
lyamc,fe71qip,t1_fe6yz30,"Hey so I realize that you haven't experienced anything outside of your bubble and are just repeating talking points.

Here's my experience with stuff:

Go to doctor, tell him I have chronic back pain since age 15. Refers me to a specialist. Specialist schedules an MRI. I go to have the MRI.

I paid for gas and parking.

I go to the doctor because my ear hurts. He flushes it some ear wax, tells me it doesn't appear infected but to come back if the pain doesn't go away after a few days.

I paid for literally nothing.

I had some inflammation problems so I needed a prescription. With no additional insurance it costed approx. $15 for a bottle. 

You cannot fathom how cheap these ""out of pocket"" costs are. You must be imagining some terrible cost like a $1000 pill bottle. The most I've seen was $120 because one of the drugs (out of 3) wasn't covered.

When you go to the hospital, you get charged ZERO for anything they use.

The simple reason why is because saving the lives of people takes priority."

SoloBlueBoy,en7h7n,top_level,"Feel like a bit if a dickhead for even writing this, but I (22m) honestly prefer having a nap on the couch, cuddling my dog, than sleeping in my bed and cuddling my girlfriend (26f).

My dog, Sam, a black German Sheperd mix, is an awesome dog. He's 2 years old and I've had him since he was a puppy. We've got an awesome bond. I've been with my girlfriend for 2 years and we now live together. 

Since Sam was a puppy, we have always cuddled on the couch. He isn't allowed in the bedroom or bathroom, but he has free reign of the lounge. Whenever I go sit on the couch, he always jumps up onto my lap (despite being pretty big) and he will just put his head on my chest and not move until I do. I go to bed and sleep with my girlfriend every night and she insists on being the little spoon. Being the big spoon sucks. Her hair is in my face, she can snore SUPER loudly and she has this specific habit of turning over and elbowing me in the face, usually around 2am.

But every weekend, either Saturday or Sunday, I watch a movie in the lounge, I lie on the couch and Sam comes to join me. Without fail, I fall asleep with him in my arms. I sleep for 2 solid hours and it is most definitely the best sleep I have during the week. And when I wake up, Sam is in the exact same place, in my arms, silent and peaceful and still my wee little puppy. 

I prefer cuddling my dog to my girlfriend."

Your relationship with your dog is an ego trip. It’s all about YOU. It’s about you controlling another being and the being continuing to love you.

vibing-tonight,fdon131,t3_embdtr,"I. Feel. This. So many girls around me have lived their entire lives planning their wedding and all the things that come with it. I’ve never understood it, nothing about it seems enjoyable to the couple. I’d much rather spend the money ANYWHERE else. Not to mention all the drama of feeling the need to invite family and friends that you don’t even LIKE much less want at your “most special day” that you’re spending thousands and thousands on."
spicygrow,fdonxds,t3_embdtr,"I'm the best man at an upcoming wedding. Less than 6 months of planning between the engagement and the wedding. Bride and groom are in their early 20s. Both live at home with their parents. They bicker a lot for a couple that's supposed to be madly in love and getting married. 

They're doing the wedding as cheaply as possible, my suit/all the other groomsman's suits (not even doing tuxedo's) were about $100 a piece. To buy, not rent. Lmao. It's going to be a clusterfuck."

( 7 to date) When the next brother was engaged I told my soon to be SIL “ please don’t feel the need to ask me” she has a million girlfriends and I know it would have been the obligatory invite.

TipToeThruLife,fdotv2s,t3_embdtr,"Back out. Clearly the bride lacks empathy and the financial impact of her ""all about me"" day and what it is costing you. Sounds like she is more of a user than an authentic friend."
thrdeyehigh,fdow4ij,t3_embdtr,"I went to my cousins wedding with my bf earlier last year. It was beautiful, not my taste but it was very obvious that they spent a lot of money. The ceremony was long about an hour and a half. Everyone waiting for them to take pictures was about 2-3hours. Waiting to eat was an hour and a half. The speeches took 2hours(for some reason they let so many people make a speech without informing them. The maid of honor, the best man, the best friend, both mother and father, my father, my other uncle, the pastor and other people) the time it took for the first dance was maybe 2-3hours and by then we left. 
I’m haitian American and my bf is white. I know my cousin is in dept because the whole time we were waiting for the next thing to happen, I heard other guest talking about their venue and how they should’ve spent more on the flowers and the bridesmaid dresses could’ve been a diff color, and that she didn’t have enough braidsmaid. Everyone was judgmental on how things looked and not really concerned about their marriage. Everyone cares about weddings and not the marriage, it’s annoying. I know they spent like 30,000(maybe more) on it. Everything was bright, she had about 10braidmaids(a lot of them she dosnt even fw, just girls she knew from church, I thought that part was lame

The ONLY wedding that I thought was my ideal wedding was my bfs childhood friend. The ceremony was about 10-15mins, they took maybe 30mins for pictures and while they did we got snacks and free drinks. They had the maid of honor and best man speak, then we ate drank and eat. I truly believe the wedding should be in celebration of the couple, none of that showing out for looks or trying to show how much money you spent for a freakin day. “Let’s get married and celebrate with our friends and family” I ligit had fun there and felt the love.
But I may stop going to a lot of weddings, it’s always extra, and not for the good reasons. People just want to show out for others. Like it should be a fun and loving day for those getting marride, not stress then later thinking about the bills. F that"
Just1LovingSoul,fdox64q,t3_embdtr,"We had a lavish extravagant wedding and I don't regret any part of it. One detail though makes a big difference here, we made sure not a single living or dead person had to pay or contribute in any way whatsoever in our wedding. All they had to do was to attend, have a hell lot of fun, enjoy great music, dance, have a lavish buffet dinner and share our happiness through the night.
We paid and made sure to be able to afford for it from our hard working earned money. We also went for a 10 days honey moon in an island in Thailand (where I was almost killed by a taxi driver, but that's another very sad story).
I understand that in some other cultures it can be a real burden with all the expenses and obligations for the attendies or friends/family members, though.
We are not rich, not at all. It's just that we wanted to celebrate our love and eagerness to be together with our friends, coworkers, neighbors and family members.
That was 9 years ago and everyone of them has amazing memories of that night because we made sure we accommodate to their best expectations of a good time good food and endless dancing till dawn.
On the other hand, if we managed to provide for our wedding for the best reasons, I really disagree with people who squeeze their finances and throw big weddings just for the snob and showing off. That's bad.
You still can call it off and apologize to your friend, try not to embarrass her with your real reasons because she seems so much into it now and won't get it."

HappyStrawberry29,fdp44c6,t3_embdtr,"If you don't want to be in it them say something right away. I stood up in ALOT of weddings and planned mine to be as affordable as possible. I even told my 2 peggo bridesmaids they could back out if they didn't want to do it or couldn't afford it. That being said I was an extremely lenient bride. I didn't care where they bought their dress or shoes so long as it was purple or silver, one bridesmaid bought a 250$ dress and another a 20$. Hair and makeup we're completely optional and so was doing the getaway weekend for the bachelorette party. Only 3 of my 7 girls went out of town and we had a little paint night for everyone else at home with wine and snacks. The point of this is if it's just the financial strain and time commitments, talk to the bride and explain it all to her. She may be as lenient and cool about it all as I was OR she may be like most status quo bridezillas and lose her shit. Not a good friend IMO if she can't realize how difficult it is to fund these sorts of things"
Professor_Oswin,fdpau6g,t3_embdtr,"There’s actually a hack for this. When you’re going out to buy things for your wedding: decorations, cake, tables, chairs, etc. Don’t mention it’s for a wedding. These stores rack up prices for that special occasion because the stuff for it is more “specific” it’s not. You still have to tell the people who are doing the dress or DJ thing though."
Davos805,fdpb79z,t3_embdtr,"There's an awesome inverse relationship on wedding cost and divorce rate. 

The less you spend the higher the chance of you making it. 

The more you spend. The higher the divorce rate. 

Pretty hilarious. 

We did a beautiful gold band and lab diamond for her. $400 for both rings. 

Courthouse wedding $125

Dinner at a steakhouse. $468

It took about 2 hours and it was wonderful. We talked and danced, had a few drinks and dessert. People still talk about the wedding and how they wished more people did it like that. 

Weddings are a joke. Being married rocks though!"
skatefishjam69420,fdpl2u4,t3_embdtr,"Yeah, I was a bestman in 2018 and it was stressful, and I kind of felt like shit because I was in between jobs and literally had to borrow money and drive hours for a bachelor party, and a wedding on separate trips.  And I had to feel bad that I was the brokest at the bachelor party.  Everything was still a good time, but geez, so stressful and so much responsibility.  It's like they ask their best friends to be in the wedding, which honestly is so much less nice than going to the wedding as a regular guest.  I agree that it's wasteful, but the one reason I like them is that it's one of the only times you'll see some family, which I think is nice and probably won't make time to do otherwise."
gamergirl3124,fdprct0,t3_embdtr,"Thats why when my SO and i get married, (depending on when we do) we will either have a simple wedding or have a small ceremony with our closest family and go on an expensive vacation for ourselves. After seeing how self absorbed and stressful weddings can be and how stupid it is that your relationship has to be legitimized by a piece of paper stating that youre married, I've decided I'm unsure if having a wedding is really for us. Ive even talked to him about when we get married and that i don't know about having a wedding or not. Its just not worth the stress or worry."
thegtabmx,fdprunx,t3_embdtr,"Weddings don't actually result in a loss for the couple equal to the expenses. Most of the time, the physical and cash gifts offset enough of the costs to result in an effective cost commensurate with the benefits the couple is getting (i.e. memories, photos, food, partying, tradition, appeasement of family, etc). If your not expecting your invitees to gift enough to offset the expenses enough to justify what you think the wedding is worth to you (in the above mentioned positives), then you are spending too much.

With respect to your predicament, you'd be better off declining the duties and just asking to attend the day of as a normal guest, if that even suits you. You are not beheld to the bride, especially if your friendship isn't worth whatever you'd be losing."

But what i do agree is that they bride and groom cannot impose an amount of money to be spend, when my aunt got married she and the groom payed for all the dresses (custom made) and the rent of of the tuxes, after all weddings are supposed to be a day to share not to show of how much you spend.

Talk to the bride and explain her that this do not fit your budget and you can still go as a regular guest."
Maliciousnessofabee,eljaq1,top_level,"I hate how they keep adding more and more ads to try and make you buy a stupid fucking YouTube Red account. I hate that only Youtubers with a shit ton of followers are the ones that pop up on my recommended, even when I don't watch that type of content. I REALLY hate how they recently started asking you if you're still watching(like on Netflix), except that it's totally fucking random. Sometimes I'll have a playlist on all night after falling asleep and it won't ask if I'm still watching, and sometimes it'll ask 5+ times on ONE 20 minute length video.

But when you post an opinion a company doesnt like they fucking strike your account down (common with unfavorable game reviews). Oh you did nothing illegal? You can complain! Thats it you complain and still dont get your account back. Only way to work with youtube is to have all your content offline and make tons of fake accounts for reuploads.

As much as I want them gone I dont see it happening ever. The issue is not coding (a site like that could be done in a week), the issue is the video storage space. Not only do they have to store shit ton of video in high quality, they are also responsible for what's stored there so they need expensive lawyers I imagine.

imbettyperez,empy5p,top_level,"What is this glorification of abusive behavior and being a literal bully when the victim is a man who didn't behave well enough in a date or relationship? Or when he acts aloof as an obvious defense mechanism.

I mean, what is it with this entitlement so many people seem to have to do to men what emotional bullies do to their victims:

- Yelling at a man and saying hurtful things trying to get a reaction out of him.
- Pressuring a man to talk about something private or from his past. 
- Demanding he allow an unkind invasion of his privacy. Retaliating if he doesn't comply. 
- Breaking his belongings, defaming him to friends, family and colleagues if he does or does not do something.
- Harassing, stalking, more breaking of belongings, threatening a man who was caught doing something. 

It is infuriating to me that we seem to think, collectively, it is totes malotes okay to withdraw all respect, compassion and empathy to a man with a justification that boils down to 'but i felt hurt at what he did!'. That is bullying behavior. 

Ever wonder why bullies sleep well at night? Why they do not seem consumed by guilt after tormenting someone? They have a reason. The victim deserved it for some reason. They didn't do anything wrong by bullying them. 

Please don't act like a bully to a man. Emotional neglect, stupidity or rudeness are not excuses to strip a man of his right to dignity and integrity. 

And please stop diagnosing any man whose sexual freedom or character bothers or threatens you. Narcissist, bipolar, pathological abuser. Dude, you don't even know if the story you just read or heard about Susie's boyfriend telling Sarah she had a hot ass is true. So put your Internet Doctor diploma back in the drawer.

This pisses me off because we could have so much more genuine, candid and fulfilling interactions if we stopped thinking that men hurting our feelings is automatic license to boundless violence against them.

Then, men are caught in the trap of insulting and dehumanizing male victims of abuse so when they are the recipients of abuse themselves they cannot say anything about it, for fear of other men's mockery or violence, and suffer deeply for it. It fucks me up to think about it and to see it in action."
Cent1234,fdqrqsn,t3_empy5p,"""Why Does He Do That,"" widely regarded as an excellent primer on the subject of domestic abuse, flat-out states that women cannot be abusive, though lesbians can be in abusive relationships, somehow.  It also states that men cannot be abused, though homosexual men can somehow be in abusive relationships.

It also states that women who beat their children are 'assaultive,' not 'abusive.'"

raffterz111,fdsfktu,t1_fdqrqsn,"Also on any article about a woman raping a teenage boy who's under the age of consent they alway say she had sex with him instead of calling her a rapist or pedo, fucking annoys me to no end."
Cent1234,fdr1mqf,t1_fdqyqca,"It's sprinkled throughout the book, but here's a particularly strong part that makes it.  Page 100: ""Myth #14: There are just as many abusive women as abusive men.""

> There certainly are some women who treat their male
partners badly, berating them, calling them names,
attempting to control them. The negative impact on these
men’s lives can be considerable. But do we see men whose
self-esteem is gradually destroyed through this process?
Do we see men whose progress in school or in their careers
grinds to a halt because of the constant criticism and
undermining? Where are the men whose partners are forcing
them to have unwanted sex? Where are the men who are
fleeing to shelters in fear for their lives? How about the
ones who try to get to a phone to call for help, but the
women block their way or cut the line? The reason we
don’t generally see these men is simple: They’re rare.
I don’t question how embarrassing it would be for a man
to come forward and admit that a woman is abusing him.
But don’t underestimate how humiliated a woman feels
when she reveals abuse; women crave dignity just as much
as men do. If shame stopped people from coming forward,
no one would tell.
Even if abused men didn’t want to come forward, they
would have been discovered by now. Neighbors don’t turn
a deaf ear to abuse the way they might have ten or twenty
years ago. Now, when people hear screaming, objects
smashing against walls, loud slaps landing on skin, they call
the police. Among my physically abusive clients, nearly
one-third have been arrested as a result of a call to the
police that came from someone other than the abused
woman. If there were millions of cowed, trembling men out
there, the police would be finding them. Abusive men
commonly like to play the role of victim, and most men
who claim to be “battered men” are actually the
perpetrators of violence, not the victims.
In their efforts to adopt victim status, my clients try to
exaggerate their partners’ verbal power: “Sure, I can win a
physical fight, but she is much better with her mouth than I
am, so I’d say it balances out.” (One very violent man said
in his group session, “She stabs me through the heart with
her words,” to justify the fact that he had stabbed his
partner in the chest with a knife.) But abuse is not a battle
that you win by being better at expressing yourself. You
win it by being better at sarcasm, put-downs, twisting
everything around backward, and using other tactics of
control—an arena in which my clients win hands down
over their partners, just as they do in a violent altercation.
Who can beat an abuser at his own game?
Men can be abused by other men, however, and women
can be abused by women, sometimes through means that
include physical intimidation or violence. If you are a gay
man or lesbian who has been abused by a partner or who is
facing abuse now, most of what I explain in this book will
ring loud bells for you. The “he and she” language that I use
obviously won’t fit your experience, but the underlying
dynamics that I describe largely will.

Page 496 states that using force to prevent a woman from beating a child is abusive towards the woman.  

> Again, a situation in which a nonabusive man had to take
physical steps to protect a child from an assaultive mother
could truly arise, but he would do so by removing the child,
not by assaulting the mother.

Really, though, you have to read through the whole book to get the full effect."
imbettyperez,fdr7vsn,t1_fdr1mqf,"I remember now, you are quite right. It makes me laugh because it truly is insensitive and victim blaming towards men. Ofc it is true abusers often claim to be victims.

From men who told me they were treated in ways that I consider abuse, none of them claimed to be victims. They were good at hiding it and pretending it had no impact on them or was ""funny"". Still, abusers claiming to be victims doesn't reflect bad on real victims like the book implies. I had totally forgotten that stuff, it is shitty."

You're saying this is fact. Its not. Its completely made up just like all the stuff in that quote up there. It gets propagated and spread because it kinda sounds like it might be true, even though there's been 0 effort to back it up with any kind of data collection effort.

The comments do mention it is fucked up to do this, however the first few at least do not have any mention of abuse.

Comments also say ""leave him instead of breaking his stuff"" while in a gender reversed situation people quickly judge the man as abuser.

It's just frustrating because I have slight hearing issues. I work retail where we often have several people in the store and music playing. When you add in people who are taking on speaker phone it makes it difficult for me. 

My favorite (sorry if off topic) are the people who come in playing music on their phones without headphone, therefore competing with our already playing music. It can cause difficulties when trying to interact one on one with a customer. Even without extraneous factors, we play a game at work called ""What did you say and what did u/solstice105 hear.'  It can be interesting."

Let her know I was being polite. That she had it so loud we were all listening, but were not polite enough to have said hello. She called me a freak, but she turned the speaker off, and was much quieter after that. So worth it."

This broke me. I cried and sobbed like an idiot for hours. To have your parents, value your struggle, even though they have been through worse, has a significant meaning. I haven't been home for almost two years now, and to get a text like this, it only makes me miss my home more."

I feel sorry for you). I really didn't know what to do and I used the advice I was given here to do the best I could.

I was straightforward about it and did my best to support him. He is understandably broken about it but seems to be handling everything in a healthy way so far.

Lapzula,elvk43,top_level,"I was four years old when my parents divorced... it’s one of my happiest childhood memories.

The constant screaming, yelling, and hostility was *finally* over. No more slamming doors, swear words, cold glaring, and passive-aggressive commentary that I didn’t understand - but I knew it was malicious by their demeanor. 

No more witnessing my mom fall face-first into her bed and weep, while my dad into the backyard for a cigarette and slammed the door behind him.

When I learned that mommy and daddy would no longer be together, I felt like I was in fucking Disneyland. The nightmare was finally, *finally* over. 

**If you’re staying for the kids, know that we see you.** Even at my parents’ best behavior, the coldness showed. 

The only thing “staying married for the kids” does is expose us to your unhappiness, and teach us that love is an unhappy experience.

Delighted Child of Divorce

WallflowersAreCool2,fdkk5ca,t3_elvk43,"Thank you for posting this. Hopefully, someone will take it to heart and quit faking it for the kids' sake. Kids are way smarter than we give them credit for. Those parents are setting a bad example of what marriage should be."

Even as a young child I remember begging my parents to just get a divorce because I could tell that they hated each other. They just said “you should feel lucky! Some kids don’t even have two parents! Be a little grateful! We stay together for you, you know?”

Every day was nothing but screaming, crying, fighting, passive aggressive comments, and all of that got directed towards me as a child. It was constant walking on eggshells because I didn’t know when they were going to explode.

They are still together, 14 years later. And they still hate each other. They joke about how much they wish the other was dead. They fight constantly. But I still hear “we stay together for you!”"

SoulsticeWolf,fdmezg9,t1_fdksg38,"See, yet another reason to just end it - that's too much guilt and pressure on a kid of any age. And then your dad doesn't say a word to you, even more like their decision is your fault or like he's punishing you.

It's not great growing up with parents who are always fighting, yelling at each other,threatening each other, calling each other names and whatnot and you're just middleman of some sort, trying to get behind everything that's going on. It's confusing and damaging as hell. 

Also, don't tell your children that they're the reason for you staying together. Telling them is only going to make them feel responsible for something they have no control over."

Got to the point where even I as their granddaughter had to tell them that my brother and I were perfectly fine and staying together for us would have only continued dad’s abuse.

Divorce is undeniably hard on the kids in the beginning. It’s a sudden change of pace, and it does come with the concept that mommy and daddy are no longer in love. It can be a process to adjust to.

But I often wonder if some divorces are traumatic because of the way society perceived divorce?

Was it really so intimately terrible, or was it terrible because everyone else kept saying it was terrible?

Thanks for sharing this."

Good for you. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows for kids who have to go through their parent’s divorce. I’m not saying your parent’s should have stayed to together but let’s be a little more realistic about what the experience is like outside of your own."
Lapzula,fdmi2tv,t1_fdls044,"This comment grated me for a variety of reasons, and I now understand why. 

**Almost everything you described is child abuse with or without the divorce.**

Custody battles can be a frustrating situation. If done properly, it can be smooth sailing and uneventful. When it *isn’t* smooth sailing, this is sometimes because the parents are using the kid to get back at one another, and is therefore shitty parenting. 

As for the other stuff:

- cops called on a drunk parent.

A parent doesn’t need to be divorced to get drunk enough to require law enforcement. That’s just child endangerment overall. 

- No nights holding one parent as they cry inconsolably as the reality of being a single parent hits them

The particulars of the divorce are not the child’s responsibility. And it is abuse to force the child to endure the intimate details of an adult situation... especially when it involves the implication that the child is the burden.

“Comfort me while I cry about how difficult you are going to be for me!”

If this was your experience with divorce, that reflects more on your parents’ parental skills than it does on the concept of divorce."

I have asked and recommended that they seek out professional help, usually with the same “no” or “yeah, but...” Like honestly? I’m not trained for this. I can be your friend but I can’t be your counselor.  Especially when they come to you constantly and all you talk about is how sad they are and how pitiful their situation is. I want to be able to joke and laugh with you, not watch you cry and not be able to help you.

I’m not the smartest guy, so things I say most likely won’t help or will make a situation worse, and I don’t want to risk that. That’s why getting REAL help is so essential. I know money can be hard for people, but surely a potentially life-saving investment is worth it?

My situation isn’t grand, but I’ve learned to cope (albeit probably unhealthily) better than others. (I’ve also received a prescription that helps. Luckily for me, that’s all I need currently.) Different people have different situations, and I understand that, but when you adamantly refuse to seek out professional help and then get upset at me for not being able to understand or sympathize, it’s really disheartening and burdening.

She also tends to drag my other friends down with her. If she's not happy, nobody else is allowed to be. She'll go on about how much she hates her life and is suicidal, and my friends will try to cheer her up and it almost never works. I try, and she refuses to seek professional treatment.

My situation is slightly different as it involves people who aren’t my friends:

Honestly if it was my very close best friend, I’d be hella supportive, but most people who have texted me about being suicidal or in a depressive state in the past barely even know me and I’m just thinking to myself that if I were in a crisis (And I do have depression) the last person I’d go to is the random ass classmate whose last name I don’t even know. I’d go to my best friends and family or—gasp!— a fucking counselor. Even more aggravating is when people who have a crush on you bring up their tragic depression and childhood like that’s gonna make you want to do nothing more than rip your clothes off and hop on that lol. 

3 times in my life people have texted me that they are thinking about killing themselves in the immediate future—All of them males with expressed crushes on me—2 of them I called the police and went to bed, these were in high school. The last one was from a 26 year old dude who I worked with for a month. Texts me months later out of nowhere that he was considering killing himself because hE fEeLs So LoNeY bEcAuSe No GiRlS liKe HiM... nice try. I told him that I was surprised he didn’t feel comfortable discussing something so personal with his roommates or friends or relatives. I expressed my condolences regarding his emotions and then offered to pick him up and drive him to the mental hospital. Works like a charm.

Call me a cold hard bitch but I genuinely believe these damsels in distress acts that these guys do are not actually a crisis. I refuse to participate, I find it manipulating.

Unpopular opinion: A lot of people use their mental illness for attention. As someone with depression, I don’t wear my illness like a fashion statement or cute characteristic. It might be discussed with people who are close to me if needed, but not random ass people. Catch me outside."

Growing up my sister and mother were both suicidal and the effects it had on me are permanent. I feel terrible for the situation of people suffering depression, but also for the people they are in relations to. It hurts a whole family.

If you wouldn't ask someone who's clearly not a plumber to help you fix your toilet, you shouldn't ask someone who's clearly not a therapist to help you fix your problems. There is a humongous difference between supporting someone through their hardships and actively helping to fix their problems.

Instead he says it's only exhausting to see me this way. I can see that, but I still encourage him to be honest. He tries to be supportive as much as possible, but I have to remind him that he isn't my therapist, and to make time for himself too. Fortunately, I am going to be receiving help soon!

Laser_Magnum,em93jj,top_level,"Depression is sitting in your room all day rewatching the same show for the third time because you fear the outside.

Depression is listening to the same three songs on repeat because they remind you of a simpler, better time and because you're afraid of venturing outside your comfort zone.

Depression is not eating anything for three days straight simply because you forgot.

Depression is thinking about not being alive for so long that you're not sure you *are* alive anymore.

Depression is staining your pillowcase with tears so much no one even notices the stains anymore because it's just how it looks now.

Depression is hovering in social interactions not wanting to say anything because you feel like you'll bring everyone down or God forbid be shamed for feeling and being the way you are.

Depression is all that and so, *so* much more. If someone tells you they have depression, don't go, ""That's nothing. I have a friend who cuts his wrists. *That's* real depression.""

Depression isn't a dick-measuring contest, it's a fucking disease, and it should be treated like one. You don't tell a Stage 4 cancer patient their cancer isn't real because they haven't died to it yet. If you do this to someone, and they end up killing themselves because they felt that no one was listening or that their problem wasn't real, their blood is on your hands. So unless you can deal with the knowledge that your actions have caused someone to take their own life, when someone opens up to you don't tell them that's, ""Nothing""."

But with the medication and the therapy, I am doing somewhat better. I am healing mentally from a lifetime of abuse. A recent trauma is the reason I'm in therapy.

If you can afford therapy, it is helpful. If you can't afford it and live in the US, check to see if your county has a mental health clinic. That's where I'm going.

That’s not just depression. It’s also being with your friends but still being hollow. Cracking jokes and laughing but wanting to cry. Talking to your best friend but feeling your heart be torn out when you hear their voice.

It’s also being aware of when they’re having the bad day. Wanting to be there for them. Hug them and tell them everything is okay. Wanting to protect her at all costs. But doing nothing. Because you’re frozen because you don’t know what to do since you’ve never hugged her. All you can do is see her cry and silently beg her not to go down the path you went.

There were two suicides in my school, two years apart: two of the most popular guys at my school, always seeming so happy, always seeming to be fine to everyone else. Of course it didn't make sense to most people, they weren't cutting their wrists or crying in class or writing sad songs, why would they have killed themselves? Because it's not just the outward signs the media shows and lately seems to glorify and romanticize. I didn't know either of them well, but the truth of the matter is that no one knew anything was wrong because they only knew the stereotypical signs."
Laser_Magnum,fdq42fv,t1_fdpr0hx,"It's honestly a blessing to be able to express the fact that you're sick. Those guys were popular and happy, but when they got hit by depression, they didn't know what to do but keep up the act, and no one bothered asking or checking because no one thought it was possible they were depressed. How could they be? They had every reason to be happy, right? And they didn't even learn from the first guy killing himself. No, they let another death happen."
Spectralpoetess,fdtgpqh,t1_fdq42fv,"True that, OP.

He's fine.* Until he wasn't. One of the guys was actually a member of my robotics team, he had stopped coming to meetings about a year before he passed away, and most of us just assumed that he was wrapped up in other activities he did, or that he was too ""cool"" to be one of us (he was popular, but very, very bright and loved technology). None of us could have imagined that the real reason might have been what he was really going through. Admittedly, I wasn't close enough to him to feel comfortable with asking him why he stopped coming to meetings, and thinking back, I don't know if he would have felt comfortable with being honest with me. Every so often, I can't help but think, what could I have done?"

Its evident because I function fine with full time school and 30 hrs of work a week, other people have a more severe depression that doesn’t allow them that privilege to be high functioning. Just as any mental illness, depression does have different severities. That’s okay. What isn’t okay is people putting down others for complaining about their illness in which they perceive has a lesser severity to their own or someone else’s. 
I think in a way we were both on the same page but had different definitions on a few things. Ya know? Do you agree?

Even if you think women are “shallow”, why would you be shallow in return instead of being a fucking good person? You’re just self projecting at that point.

Or I was told they couldn’t see themselves being in a serious relationship with someone taller than them. Or they’d attack my femininity because they themselves felt emasculated by the size difference.

Catseyes77,fdnm2j4,t1_fdnay6a,"Do women actually date taller or is it because the average man is 12 cm taller than the average woman globally?  Because if you just take down stats of height of spouses in marriages and men are taller than the women all that tells you that that is statistically normal and says nothing about preferences of height in women.

 And maybe there are quite a few shorter people that somehow got a chip on their shoulder that they are short and act like assholes or they lack confidence and that further would increase the perception that women favour tall men?"
sharkpuberty,fdnxx8t,t1_fdnay6a,"I get it. Dude we're just highly compatible people, I don't give a shit if he's a few inches shorter than me. I'd rather be with this kind of person than a tall asshole."

Sexual selection in humans is not very clear. Unlike animals we aren't that picky when it concerns making perfect offspring and have more evolved brains.

But even if we put the Darwin sexual selection theory directly onto humans  your notion that it applies to height is somewhat flawed.  

Since sexual selection is all about 2  things: having healthy offspring and a mate that can take care of the offspring. Considering the last part, being tall might equate healthy; but men who have an impressive talent or ability, provide financial stability, have good social skills or even feminine attributes (linked with higher emotional care)  are better for our spawn.

Keep in mind we are very social creatures, it's not the norm we nest alone so how the partner acts in our societal constructs is quite important. Our kids our with us a long time compaired to animals so dependant is more important than pretty.

And in the research on physical attributes that women like in men, sure height is one of them, but so is sound of the voice, facial structure, body structure and body hair.  And to claim that height trumps dozen or more other features is quite factitious."

It also clearly states that average height men have the most offspring not the tall ones. Also no where in this article does it say anything about the husband being taller or shorter than their spouse. It's all data in relation to the global height statistics.

Average height men have more children then tall men does not automatically mean all their wives are shorter.

I don't like the thought of not talking about it. I think these things should be spoken about because I had no idea there even was a shortcels before this thread. I don't think we should limit our conversation just because some people are lost in life and might possibly go off the deep end with it. 

I also don't like the thought of banning a place just because they're saying things we don't like. Freedom of speech is a double edged sword, after all. If they're calling for violence or harm then yes, we need to force them to stop, but if they're just talking then, no matter how vile it is, we should let them be."

They seem to bring up incidents like the false rape things as jokes when obviously they are not jokes and those guys probably had there lives ruined even after it was proved they did nothing.

Seriously? Why do you feel the need that every subreddit you find offensive needs to be banned? I don’t use reddit much because of stuff like this. Limited freedom and speech.

It’s ok to see things you disagree with. Get outside your bubble/safe place once in while.

Note: I’m over 6’ tall so I don’t have a horse in this race. I did grow up poor though. Females almost have never held it against me when I was struggling.  I don’t think people by in large judge you based on your clothes, card money or height. However I totally get people project their insecurities.  

TL;DR let them have their space to wallow in their own misery, hope they’ll find their way out one day."
drekia,fdnfmkm,t1_fdn4ehd,"Many other incel subreddits have indeed been banned, for good reason.

Nothing to get salty about and good riddance, quite frankly."
SpecterTheGamer,fdmuj79,t3_em4x3u,"Alright, this will sound bad enough, but here's my point of view: 

Nothing should ever be banned on here, and here are my reasons: 

1) you yourself said you like to lurk in some subs, hence you are willingly doing so, no one seemed to have forced you to go down there. 

2) As pathetic and disgusting some subs can be, as long as they mind their own business, they should not be removed. 

&#x200B;

These are my main reasons. I am, in no way, trying to insult you nor defend them, but I'm strongly against censorship. If they want to be delusional about their lives, let them be.   


As long as something you see doesn't have the goal of hurting others, and you are willingly seeing it, the best thing to do is to just ignore it and go on with your life :)  

I truly hope this doesn't get taken the wrong way"
SpecterTheGamer,fdng7w1,t1_fdnfxor,"What exactly goes against the content policy? AFAIK it's people insulting others, pretty normal stuff on reddit if you ask me.

Gotitaila,fdoxau8,t3_em4x3u,"As someone who isn't an incel, isn't short, and doesn't care for their cause: No (and fuck you).  

Reddit should be open to anyone, not just the things you find interesting, appropriate, or morally acceptable.  

Shortcels is, at its core, a place for ""guys who are virgins that wish they weren't and who believe it's because they're short, partially"".  

If something is being posted that violates the T&C or the law, ok, remove it.  

If something makes you mad because you don't like the loathing, fucking don't go there.  

I don't like your post, but I don't want it removed.  I want the internet as a whole to be open, representative of the values relating to freedom, like freedom to do and say what we want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. 

And shortcels existing doesn't hurt you.  If it does, you don't have to be part of that community.  Leave them the fuck alone.  Jesus Christ.  

And for the record: Not all of them, in fact many of them, are not just short.  Many of them have fucking irreparable conditions that make them, at least in the eyes of traditional beauty, unattractive.  

They deserve a platform to mingle with others who share their beliefs.  It doesn't hurt anyone.  And you also deserve TrueOffMyChest as a platform to share you beliefs.  It doesn't hurt anyone (but still fuck you 🤷‍♂️).

Leave them the fuck alone.

Fakepi,fdn62ym,t1_fdn5pvm,"This sub breaks reddit TOS, would you like it banned as well? Pretty much every sub breaks TOS in some way because they are written so vaguely. A sub can be banned for any reason reddit feels like. 

I understand where you are coming from but I like reddit being a place where I can find any number of opinions, most of which I do not agree with. If we ban people from speaking how can we have a dialogue that is productive. Free speech saves people from being radical because people call them out on it.

Hypergamy is a very real thing. Women will have in average a bit over 1 kid, whereas men will either have zero or over 2 kids in average. It goes to show that its common for fewer men to have kids with more than 1 woman, while a lot of other men will have zero access to women.

The difference is that these men are now kept alive. And yes, they could stand a chance with a change in posture but their height will matter and make things 1000x more difficult.

It's something i realized a long time ago: as a man, you got things to figure out. I'm successful with women because I'm fortunately kinda attractive ( Ona group, I'm the one who will get the attention of women) and good at singing ( got a band + won karaoke competitions with over 100 participants), which I use for my benefit.

 But that's no impediment for me to realize the nature of human behaviour and the hard times some of my friends go through with women.

Summarizing: is it impossible for short men to get women? No.

Is it a lot harder? Hell yes. Specially if they don't have a natural super high confidence, to the point of almost delusion... Which it actually might help."

But I don't go around telling people that I think all of those producers should get banned forever. I dont actively seek something to get angry at online. If some 5'3'' guy wants to be sad for being 5'3'' let him be sad. Let this dude have his opinion, its a tough world out there I'm sure he has his reasons to be upset. Does he deal with it correctly by becoming an incel? Probably not, lets be real. No one wants to be an incel, eh? But by god just let this guy have his self loathing on the internet, no one not a single soul forces you to seek out such content and get all angry about it. Why kick someone whos already on the ground crying? Not even just kicking, actively looking out for him, finding him, running up to him and then start kicking, while fantasizing about kicking him for the entire process.

There are much worse much more toxic communities on reddit and the internet in general, and they dont deserve to be banned as long as they dont engage in illegal stuff. Its their right to exist on here as well as it is your right to make this post. 

But hey, I gtg, I gotta listen to godawful music to get all worked up again and write angry letters about how I think those music producers should all be sent of to siberian gulags.

It is important to note that “black culture” isn’t International and Is a uniquely American coined term to account for the  cultural practices of black Americans who in general don’t have a connection to their native cultures due to in a large part slavery.

When people say there is no white culture it’s because white culture isn’t monolithic, and because their isn’t a significant group of white people who have lost their native cultures and needed to build a new culture solely around their race 

Just to clarify, I am well aware that white people of different ethnicities have rich and varied culture. Just the context of when the term “their is no white culture” is used would be to describe why their is specificity a “black culture” and not the inverse.

There is no such thing as a global black culture either, but in the US a black culture did form because of people being segregated and only being judged by their skin colour. Over time it made vastly different people bond together and form a culture, but in Africa there is no monoculture called black culture. Like Europe, Africa is very diverse when it comes to cultures, probably even more so than Europe. 

White Americans have American culture with regional differences. They do have a culture but you can also be some other skin colour and be culturally American.

Snownova,fdjiz0p,t1_fdja8wj,"Absolutely, but by that logic any culture defined by skincolor doesn't exist. There is no ""black culture"", there are many distinct cultures in Africa, though not always defined by nationality there but often more by tribe (since the nationalities and borders were largely and arbitrarily imposed by European colonizers), in addition there is African American culture.

Zendarian_Monk,fdke77y,t1_fdk86dy,"Dutch culture is very much influenced by Calvinism. Humility, directness and living below your means is valued by Calvinism and in the Netherlands. 

If you look at our historic cities this can be seen quite clearly, houses that don’t necessarily flaunt wealth with large open windows (so you can check and see if the neighbors are adhering to these values). Hierarchies are less visible like at work. 

The Netherlands has a history of tolerance and although that does not mean we are some all accepting paradise, it would not be wrong to say that for it’s time the Netherlands has always been relatively progressive. Adding onto that we’re also quite individualistic with a (relatively speaking) live and let live attitude. We’re a country that has always relied on trade so we have a mercantile spirit (koopmansgeest). 

Santa Claus is partly based on our own tradition of Sinterklaas. St Martins day is also celebrated in different parts of the country, with our own unique celebration of it. 

I’m from the north of the country so I can only really speak about us. Frisia has their own language and a few traditions of their own. Groningen also has a dialect and is in many ways far more direct than the rest of the country. In the north people identify far more with being northern than being Dutch in my experience. 

The south is more influenced by catholicism and celebrates carnaval  which is a pretty big deal there.

So I got the hazard waste stuff out and cleaned it up and my co-worker ran to the store with some money from the old Lady and bought her some sweats. She threw away eveeyrhing snd got cleaned up and apologized again then left. I would have been so embarrassed so we tried out best to help her.

Wakefield and McCarthy are both personally responsible for the needless deaths of thousands of kids but they keep getting money and notoriety out of it instead of criminal charges. They don't give a single fuck about the kids they've killed, either.

bohner941,fdisyef,t1_fdh10v6,"Backing operations in Yemen, death squads in Central America, and the coup in chile was not direct American action. While the outcomes of these things may be messy if you want to call them terrorism, all you can say is that the USA supported terrorism (just as Iran did and continues to do)  but it is really more grey than that seeing as you could argue these were done in the interest of national security. The war in Vietnam was awful but the us was trying to stop the spread of communism and make a better life for the Vietnamese people, the intention of the war was that it would work out like Korea did and at least half of the country would be able to live in freedom and have vastly better lives, but the war spiraled out of control. This war was also started by France initially. The invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan I think all Americans can agree were a mistake but it's easy to look back and say that, not so easy when your country just suffered the largest attack on American soil and the administration is being pressured to do something about it. Once again these wars were a huge mistake and did not target who was actually responsible but the intention was to make a bold stand against terrorism. The definition of terrorism is the unlawful use of  intimidation or violence especially against civilians in the pursuit of political aims. Under that definition the US may have some shady business and may have done some bad things that did not work out too well, but it is not terrorism. America has been an overwhelming force of good in the world, and while it has not been perfect I don't think any country has a clean record ( ehem Europe who subjugated native people's around the globe). Truth is the United States could have taken control of a good chunk of the world after WW2 but we decided to fight imperialism and ensure that people were allowed to rule themselves."

2) it’s “you’re”, and not “your” when referring to the contraction of “you are” and not one’s possessions.

3) capital letters are not required in the middle of sentences or randomly.

4) drinking damages brain cells and inhibits cognitive function, you of all folks probably should limit such intake, you can ask your mother for more information, if required.

Anyhow, hope that helps, have fun."

Saudi Arabia whips, chemically castrates and imprisons people for life for being homosexual = violation  of human rights

Russia tortures, hazes, kidnaps and murders their own and foreign prisoners as well as civil detainees - while their own laws dictate their illegality = violation of human rights


... All of these examples are widespread instances of human rights violations in other countries; two of these examples are considered ""enemies"" to the US - yet I see no US drone strikes seems like theyre picking their battles and puffing their chest - again. The remaining two are somewhat allies to the US - Yet I see no repercussions or consequences handed down by the United States: The Marshall to the Globe -  the great interferer."

Soleimani  proxies have killed US soldiers... and very recently destroyed oil  refineries, captured oil tankers from other countries, shot down our  drones...  but the last two weeks it came to a head.

Dec   27th. Iranian proxies launch a rocket strike against Americans,  killing  a civilian.  We retaliate with bombs on Iranian  militia/terrorist  (Kataeb Hezbollah) sites in Iraq.

Dec   31st. Iranian backed militia/terrorists shouting 'death to America'  use  a battering ram to enter a U.S. embassy, and set fire to it,  planting  Hezbollah flags, putting up pro Hezbollah graffiti literally  naming  soleimani as their leader.

Jan 3rd.  We terminated soleimani.

Trump  started nothing.  He was OVERLY diplomatic for the past year.  This   retaliation is strong, cheap, and targetted for maximum effect and   minimum casualties.  The next general will think twice before following   in soleimani's footsteps.

The Obama administration's U.S. Treasury explained our sanctions on Solemaini... :

"" As **IRGC-QF Commander, Qasem Soleiman**i .... supporting terrorist organizations and   extremist groups around the world... training, logistical assistance and material and financial support to militants and terrorist operatives, including the Taliban, Lebanese Hizballah,   Hamas... supported attacks against  U.S. and  allied troops and diplomatic missions in Iraq and Afghanistan... continues to train, equip and fund Iraqi Shia militant  groups... supports terrorist groups such as Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas...

AlphaHexus,eo9l2b,top_level,"Today an old friend of mine and I got into on facebook about this. She was trying to say a man hitting a woman is far worse than a woman hitting a woman. Coming from a house with an abusive mother, her arguement really confused me. Like honestly I do not understand how anyone can belittle or justify abuse. Abuse is abuse, end of story. Doesnt matter what you have in your pants. It just blows my mind that people think its ok.

Edit: Sorry I wrote this in a bit of a rage and wasnt really thinking clearly. Her point is it's ok for women to hit men. Her bias for saying this was that men can take the hit and aren't prone to letting abuse affect them."
misseselise,feb2cgv,t3_eo9l2b,"Some people just don’t want to acknowledge that equality is for all aspects of life, not just the beneficial one. 

So what if a guy is stronger? In a fight between two men or two women, someone is bound to be the stronger one. It doesn’t matter if there’s a difference in gender. Be upset that an adult is resorting to violence or hitting people instead of the gender of the abuser and the one abused"
Prussian-Glory,fecfh1p,t1_feb2cgv,"Amen, abuse is abuse, rape is rape. Why can’t people see that?"
Angel_of_Pallas,febdi1l,t3_eo9l2b,That’s ridiculous. I also have an abusive mother. Doesn’t matter what gender or what a person identifies as. Abuse is abuse.
klaw14,febubmp,t3_eo9l2b,"Fuck's sake with people who think like this. Just because a man may be more physically able to ""take a hit"" doesn't mean that it affects them any less mentally and emotionally. Women that think like her are what make people hate feminism. Real feminists support true equality between the sexes - not this cherry-picking ""I'll claim women's rights when it suits me"" bullshit. Men have feelings. Men feel pain too."
scorpio6519,febnyfp,t3_eo9l2b,Violence is violence. Violent women are no less culpable than violent men. You are so right. I had a violent mother and a violent father. My father hit harder but my mother hit more often
maybebaked,feabjr1,t3_eo9l2b,Women want equality except when it comes to things like this.  Some just don't get it.

my_throw_away_reddit,febzt0c,t3_eo9l2b,"Abuse is abuse. I have a female family member who is a domestic violence abuser, the men just don't talk about as openly as women do because of the stupid stigma."

I taught all of them that hitting anyone should be avoided if at all possible. If in defense of yourself, another, or morals, though, strike swiftly and end it quick because some people only respond to violence. 


They don't usually get into fights."
dahlissa,febo9eg,t3_eo9l2b,"Agree w all of you that abuse is abuse, no matter the gender. But physical abuse of a man against a woman is worse, just based on the physical differences of the sexes. I realize a woman hitting a man will cause damage, especially if she picks something up n uses it, but not many women have a punch to break bones/teeth, are able to push/pick-up a man and throw him down the stairs, to restrain a man on the floor as shes choking him, etc. So no there is no difference legally/mentally, but physically, the abuse is quite different."
AlphaHexus,febpiu3,t1_febo9eg,Generally you're right. That I could agree with but that's not what her point was. She was saying its excusable. Sorry I'm going to edit the post to make that clear.
Trinamopsy,fec86db,t1_febo9eg,The damage to be concerned about isn’t just the physical damage. Abused people suffer long after the bruises are gone.

laurdsed,febkgy1,t3_eo9l2b,"Perhaps when stating that abuse by men is far worse, she meant that it’s far more common? I don’t hear her saying it’s ok. I’m not negating abuse by women. Abuse IS wrong no matter what. However, a woman is far more likely to die from domestic violence than men are."
AlphaHexus,febnpb4,t1_febkgy1,I guess I should have clarified her point. Her arguement is that abuse by women on men isnt nearly as severe as the vice versa. At one point she even said it was excusable for certain reasons. I made this post while upset and I didnt really get into her ideology. To address your point we didnt discuss the frequency because by the numbers you're right abuse is more commonly Male on female.
Lothcarn,febnk7z,t1_febkgy1,"I believe this is one of those things where the end result (or lack thereof) does not justify the actions. I'm not saying that's your belief, but it is the belief of many. The end result being worse doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye or minimize the severity of the action itself.

As for the commonality of abuse there are statistics showing that women are just as if not more abusive than men. The last time I looked into the statistics I remember that in reciprocal violence males had a slight lead over females but in terms of non-reciprocal violence female abusers were more than twice as common as male abusers."
RunsonPremix,feculzo,t1_febkgy1,"Men are more less likely to report abuse, so more common can not be quantified.  

However, men also have less support as victims.  They are often ridiculed for getting ""beat up by a girl.

I know several men convicted of domestic assault, all but one served time in jail.  I know half as many women convicted for domestic assault, not one spent a single night in jail."

mybrainissickisitok,eodqoh,top_level,"I washed my face for three days in a row, for the first time in a long time.

Okay, I know this sounds gross. But I suffer from an overwhelming level of depression and anxiety. One of the first things that I give up on is self maintenance. My brain usually just thinks “what’s the purpose of washing your face/brushing your teeth? You’ll just have to do it again tomorrow, and the next day, and so on. What’s the point?”

I know this logic is flawed, but that’s just how my brain works with depression. I give up on myself, I don’t think I’m worth the basic maintenance. It leads to me feeling even worse about myself, and keeps continuing in a terrible cycle. I go to work every day, and feel disgusting, but then I come home and just lay in bed and don’t move, and let depression take its toll.

As of now, I’ve managed to wash my face and brush my teeth three days in a row. I even had the motivation to use some skincare products.

I haven’t done this for myself in years. I feel like I might be able to start feeling okay enough to take care of myself again."
Demoncratic666,febzmxd,t3_eodqoh,Good job! Take care of yourself like you would some other person who needs it.

rccaldwell85,fecu182,t1_fec3s9a,"I keep my toothbrush / toothpaste in the shower. So it’s a “two birds / one stone” type deal. Get in the shower AND you get to go ahead and knock brushing your teeth out of the way. Helps me to remember and make sure it’s done everyday.

Miss_Mandy_Martian,fec5583,t3_eodqoh,"Hey, if it makes you feel better, I literally just made myself a big fluorescent green self care board. I made a grid, put Monday-Sunday on the top, and then filled in the vertical boxes with things from a self care list I got online. I bought a bunch of Lisa Frank and dollar store stickers, and now I’m using it every day to keep on track. I feel like I’m in kindergarten, but it’s lightweight gratifying. My husband has also said that if I can go two weeks doing at least most of them (some of them aren’t an every day thing for me, like hair wash days), he will treat me to getting my eyebrows done or a small surprise date. It sounds dumb but it makes me feel like I’m at least trying."
mybrainissickisitok,fec5gfr,t1_fec5583,"I don’t think that’s dumb. I think that’s kind of fun.

In case you need additional advice from someone who also struggles with this, something my therapist did that help me is the concept of ""good enough"". 

Putting my manual toothbrush in my mouth, with toothpaste, and actually going through the act and brushing is a lot. Then you have to make sure  you floss around each tooth and stand there swishing around gross mouthwash for 2 minutes can be exhausting when your struggling.

But just putting my electric toothbrush in my mouth and guiding it around my mouth is something and it is better than letting the food from a whole day sit in my mouth and build up plaque. Yes, it would probably be better to make sure I did everything my dentist tells me to but at least getting my mouth cleaned up a little by brushing with my electric toothbrush is better than nothing. 

A 5-step nightly facial routine is too much even on a good day for me so instead I have makeup remover wipes because at least getting the stuff off of my face and clean is better than nothing. And you know what sometimes I do feel better and might exfoliate or do a facemask. 

I've used this phrase to help with a lot of other things to help relieve my anxiety but when my anxiety gets really bad it helps me to remember just doing one tiny little bit might not be everything but doing a little something is healthier and better than doing nothing at all."
