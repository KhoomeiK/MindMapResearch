FeengarBangar,fdwj50d,t3_en8xbn,"Because it is, this is just in terrible order."
0j0s,fdwi9p3,t3_en8xbn,"Honest question, what is the use of taping your hands before a fist fight?"
salradicchio,fdwitak,t1_fdwi9p3,"It keeps your hands in a stable position so you’re less likely to hurt yourself. And if you do end up breaking any bones in your hand, the tape keeps them in place until you can get to the hospital."
Wodaanz,fdwirx4,t1_fdwi9p3,"It’s before you put on gloves, primarily in boxing. It’s so the gloves will fit snug and you don’t risk injury. That being said, wrapping, especially around the wrist can help prevent injury when you make contact."
WrathoftheTwitchKing,fdwiu00,t1_fdwi9p3,It both protects your wrists while punching so that all the force doesn’t break it and it also protects the skin on your knuckles from being cut on impact from a punch.
PedroAlvarez,fdwjqoc,t1_fdwi9p3,"Other response here is sorta missing the point of what ""solid"" means. Hand wraps are primarily to add structure to your wrist. A tightly wrapped hand doesn't have as much give in the wrist, and prevents it from bending or taking as much of the unnatural strain that punching gives it.

In combat sports where you don't really wear any gloves, it also can prevent cuts to your hands.

The wrapping around the fingers here seems superfluous to me. Not sure what purpose that serves, other than making it look cooler. I was always taught to wrap somewhat more loosely around all of the knuckles, and tightly around the wrist. This looks like it would hurt your hands after a lot of training, but there could be a purpose for it somewhere that I don't understand."
RicardoFabila,fdwimnv,t1_fdwi9p3,"It makes your first wayyyy more solid. It is not really to protect your hands. That's why you wear gloves. When you make a fist without bands it feels weak and fragile. When you have the bands, it feels more solid."
cream-of-cow,fdxlsvh,t1_fdwi9p3,"I once forgot my hand wraps in a light sparring muay thai class, no prob I thought, light taps and light kicks. Then a guy I didn't know pulled me aside for some pad work, I told him I'm going to punch lightly, he forgot, slammed a pad into my fist for an uppercut and a bone between my knuckle and wrist felt wonky for about half a year. No fracture, but it felt like one. This is after a dozen years of training and conditioning. Wrapping hands holds all those little hand bones together."
WhackedDestiny,fdyzxn0,t1_fdwi9p3,"My coach won’t let us hit bags or pads or spar at all without wraps (and gloves). The purpose is to protect your wrists and support your hand so that you don’t break your own hand by punching with shitty form or by punching an elbow or forehead at a bad angle.

“Boxer’s fracture” is a very common break that happens in the big bone behind your first knuckle when you punch hard things too hard or at a bad angle.  Wrist strain is a very common ailment among fighters and we wrap that shit up (and work on arm, hand, and wrists all the time) so that we don’t get sidelined by doing something stupid.

Just don’t wrap them too tight or you will be in ugly pain later!"
laralex,fdwjdxt,t1_fdwi9p3,"It distributes impact among all knuckles to prevent them from beeing dislocated after a single strike. If you tape it wrong it may be even worse than with a bare hand, since one knuckle may now take cumulative impact"
Pushkin9,fdwkecn,t1_fdwi9p3,"I had a hand injury from a collision in a game, and this made my hand feel so much better and I was able to play again.  A quick youtube video will teach you how...it super useful.  It's kind of like learning to tape a sprained ankle only for all those vulnerable hand bones and ligaments.  Also as everyone else said, my injured hand went from feeling weak and vulnerable to solid and punch ready (no punching with injured hand though)."
explicitmemories,fdyapan,t1_fdwi9p3,It looks cool
RAMGLEON,fdwiqgg,t1_fdwi9p3,It supports you hand
fakeyero,fdxh2lz,t1_fdwi9p3,"Just adding to all the correct answers here: much of the fragility of the hand comes from the form of our punches. When we throw a punch and our elbow twists and our knuckles end up palm down we misalign all those little bones and make them vulnerable. It's a stronger punch, but makes us vulnerable. If you're ever in a street fight or need to punch without stabilizing your hand/wrist, the best form is straight out like a piston with your hand in sort of a thumbs-up form (thumb still tucked). You lose a lot of power and you look dorky but you're far less likely to break your hands."
cloud1e,fe0xo7l,t1_fdwi9p3,"Wraps are for stability, there are ways to train your wrists to be stable without wraps but if you dont want to have to do extra training just wrap em."
IIHotelYorba,fe14hpd,t1_fdwi9p3,The real reason for wraps and gloves is to let guys swing harder.  They aren’t meant to protect the other guy’s face.  Hands have little tiny bird bones that break easily when hit from the wrong angle.  Bareknuckle boxers have to be way more careful and they’re always cutting their hands to shit
Grunzelbart,fdyi1uq,t1_fdwitak,"I bet they hurt like fuck, when the doctor takes them off though."
Frosty172,fe01bx5,t1_fdwitak,"To add onto this, it stabilizes your wrist so when you're punching things really hard, it doesn't crumple as easily. It also helps with the friction that you get when you punch things"
tie_po,fdx2ayl,t1_fdwjqoc,"They make me do this wrap in boxing, for me I see it as a way of ensuring it all stays in place while you do drills without the gloves on and with that specific wrap you often have about a foot of fabric left by the time youce followed the steps so this just gets rid of that I guess. Structurally makes no difference but it just means everything is tucked away while you do whatever"
letsgocrazy,fdz7qpc,t1_fdwjqoc,"I don't like wrapping between my fingers, the thickness of the material seems to ruin my fist and kind of provides leverage if it gets jarred, and makes me hold my fist open and awkward.
It stops me from fully clenching my fist and locking into place, if that makes sense."
PurryFury,fdxwngj,t1_fdwjqoc,"I use this method and the bend around thumb makes it harder to unwind when training since your thumb makes a slightly more tightness when in fist position. Same thing with fingers, it does hurt if done too tight but otherwise sits nicely without loosening too much."
0j0s,fdxhsqk,t1_fdxh2lz,I'll try to bear this in mind!
August_28th,fdykzl8,t1_fdyi1uq,Broken bones hurt yea
GoldenGonzo,fe2oazc,t1_fdyi1uq,"If you break your hands while wearing wraps, the doctor just cuts the wraps off with scissors.  You'll likely have gotten a shot for numbing by then anyways."
Frosty172,fe01h62,t1_fdztfne,"The first part that he said was right, though vague. The second part is...not so much"
PedroAlvarez,fdx6svn,t1_fdx2ayl,"Ooh, just to prevent it from slipping too far down? That makes some sense. I didn't really have a problem without the looping around the fingers, but I think if you went too loosely around the knuckles, you could have some slipping.

Either wrap accomplishes the core function, which is wrist stability."
Iron_Lumberjack,fdx338i,t1_fdx2ayl,"It's the same principle as a roll of quarters but smaller, I'd guess. By having the twists to grab on to it stabilizes the wrist for a more solid punch."
DEEEPFREEZE,fdyrg66,t1_fdykzl8,Bet they don’t.
salradicchio,fe028w8,t1_fe01h62,"Well, when I was taking boxing lessons, that’s what they told me. Oh well. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
DevilsAdvocate9,fdz55g5,t1_fdyrg66,My dad can beat up your dad.
Haroldspurplecrayons,fdzel10,t1_fdz55g5,With or without tape?

ollie_ollie_oxenfree,fdwfzdu,t3_en8xbn,It is pretty easy...?
laszlo,fdwrq23,t3_en8xbn,Don't Dead Open Inside
Feroshnikop,fdwlg1y,t3_en8xbn,"Apparently the guide isn't even correct..

>Wrong from the beginning: the wrap should go the other way from starting at the thumb, towards the back of your hand and around the wrist, not towards your palm. This allows the wrap to tighten as you make a fist, while wrapping toward the palm will loosen it when you clench. The rest of the steps look pretty good.

DunnBJJ,fdwrmk8,t1_fdwlg1y,The only thing I learned in my few months of striking is there is way more than one way to wrap your hands
sirmart1n,fdxdcbt,t1_fdwlg1y,Our coach was also against wrapping between fingers. Can’t remember why but he was rather clear about not doing that
thesnakeinthegarden,fdx7dhu,t1_fdwlg1y,100% right.
GoldenGonzo,fe2omwe,t1_fdwlg1y,"This guide is at least several decades old.  And as the saying goes ""there is more than one way to skin a cat"".  Go to a dozen different boxing or MMA gyms in your area and you'll probably find at least 3-4 different ways to wrap."
Versaiteis,fdx1g4n,t1_fdwrmk8,"Weird, I learned something very similar while working at a feline ""pet resort""."
PedroAlvarez,fdxcckz,t1_fdwrmk8,"Yeah, I been around boxing my whole life and everyone has their own way, it seems. Even at the same gym being taught the same way, fuckers do completely random things."
thesnakeinthegarden,fdx7ga6,t1_fdwrmk8,You always wrap away from your thumb though.
Hans_Trolljegeren,fdzztzc,t1_fdx1g4n,Why are you punching felines?
NoEngrish,fdzs74v,t1_fdxcckz,"I like to wrap my fingers, I have a friend that just holds onto a bunch of the wrap to start ""loading"" his fist, another friend of mine starts with a bunch of the wrap over his knuckles to protect them then begins his wrap, and then you see the traditional gauze wraps that the pros use for fights and it's even weirder."

Sapper501,fdyalib,t3_en8xbn,"Holy fuck, this is poorly arranged."
zoltronzero,fdxjlvr,t3_en8xbn,"Different sports wrap differently. In muay thai we wrap around the knuckles a few times to make a cushion, and almost the entire rest of the wrap is wound around the wrist to make it stronger and stop injury.

SerengetiYeti,fe69ms7,t1_fdyys1i,Boxing wraps. Kind of like an ace bandage. They keep your wrist straight and keep the bones from shifting around in your hands when you hit things.

BadAtUsernames789,fdk143e,t3_els9n1,"I used to do a card trick for friends that uses that same basic idea. I would lay out 25 cards face down in a rectangle. I secretly knew only what the last card was and where I put it. 

I would say something cheesy like “for this trick, you’re going to do the magic” then ask them to concentrate and point to where they think <last card> is. Odds are they would be wrong but I would pick up the card they pointed to and without letting them see it, say “nice l, now I want you to find <card they pointed to>.” 

Odds are they would be wrong again but I would pick up that card as well without letting them see it. Finally I would say “okay this time I’ll see if I can find a card, say <second card they pointed to>.”

The card I would pick up would be the last card I put down, the one I asked them to find earlier. Again without showing them, I would put that third card in my hand, then ask if they remembered the three cards. We’d say what the three cards were as I lay them down in the same order. 

I know it sounds obvious from this side of the trick but of the handful of people I tried it on, nobody figured it out the first time. 

The best part is that if they ever beat the odds and pointed to the last card, I could end the trick early and still have the one or two cards I asked them for."
