elo3661ga,fe07l3z,t1_fdymg4e,Aaaaaand your comment made me also Google and I really wish I had stayed ignorant.
IMWeasel,fdybypp,t1_fdy87c4,"That's such an intensely creepy sub. Their FAQ makes them sound like people who had some bad experiences with dogs and simply don't like how common it is to own dogs. But their posts include rampant dehumanization of dog owners, visceral hatred of all dogs, and countless fantasies of inflicting violence on dogs/dog owners over the most minor of issues."
fallopian_turd,fdy10c2,t1_fdy0hbk,Lol its almost like god punishing me for being a jackass

dirkalict,fdzwo5c,t1_fdxx2ym,A smooth criminal.
fallopian_turd,fe02u04,t1_fe00ape,Hes pretty great.  Whenever we go anywhere like petsmart u can guarantee he will take a nasty shit in there no matter how many times u have him go outside before we walk in.

My mom got bit by a dog back in the day and is kinda wary of big dogs now, and I grew up with a neighbors cocker spaniel that used to hump 24/7 and was gross. I don‚Äôt know how you turn into a dog version of incels tho."

30222504cf,fe0p3hz,t1_fe0e24e,Oh thank you.  Still disgusting but at least it started out as comedy.
elo3661ga,fe0coup,t1_fe0bnib,No it‚Äôs just gross. The description kinda made me throw up in my mouth a little.
IMWeasel,fdyqmsj,t1_fdye806,"My mom also got bit by a dog when she was young and has a minor phobia of bigger dogs, but even when a big dog jumps and barks at her, she doesn't feel hatred for the owner. On the other hand, my dad has never had a traumatizing experience with a dog, and he grew up with dogs at home, but he's the one that has made ""jokes"" about putting out antifreeze to kill local dogs who dug up some of our garden. ""Joking"" about killing animals that annoy you is much more likely to be caused by weird right wing beliefs about the way things should be, than by childhood trauma involving dogs."
spinfulcassette,fdzxxc4,t1_fdzdaqy,This thread has me crying
fallopian_turd,fdxzhmv,t1_fdxz50b,Hes a mix.   Half german shepherd/ bull mastiff and great dane mix.     He kinda looks like a lab though.

c14rk0,fearyr2,t1_fe2mfqo,What if you have a dog that will just dig or break out of any fence? Had a dog in the past where this was the case. We literally ended up with a standard fence then a 6 inches or so of larger rocks and gravel before  a foot or so high board that was partially buried into the ground all along the fence. Even then that wasn't always enough to keep her from finding a way out of the yard somehow.
MrJsmanan,fe2k523,t1_fe1z4rg,Why do retractable leash‚Äôs suck?
Th3V3rg3,fe2r3ci,t1_fe2ncvn,It‚Äôs for people that chained their dogs to trees and ignored them. You definitely leash your dog.
Th3V3rg3,feav52x,t1_fearyr2,"Leave it inside, or get a breed more suited for living in the city limits. My Pyrenees would do the same if u didn‚Äôt walk the heck out of em. Was a struggle in the middle of winter. 

I‚Äôd rather have a law so trash can‚Äôt chain up dogs for years at a time, which happens. You have to admit that‚Äôs cruel to do."
MilesyART,fe2mc44,t1_fe2k523,"A lot of reasons

They can break your thumb if you don‚Äôt hold it right. The dog doesn‚Äôt get the chance to actually learn what an acceptable distance from you is, allowing it to wander too far too quickly and jump into traffic, into people or other dogs, or just where it generally isn‚Äôt allowed. It also means that when you lock it, and the dog goes running, it doesn‚Äôt know the leash is locked. It tries to run, hurts itself, you, and probably gets loose because you just ate shit and are no longer holding onto the leash. The absolute lack of boundaries presented by the leash also puts the dog in charge, rather than you, so when you do try to discipline it when you finally lock the leash or get a traditional one, it challenges you and decides to just ignore your every word. 

Basically, it‚Äôs unsafe for you, the dog, and everyone around you. Your dog could get hit by a car, attack or get attacked by another dog, hurt or get hurt by someone who doesn‚Äôt want dog running at them, and generally learns all sorts of bad habits."
c14rk0,feayect,t1_feav52x,"I mean I don't live in a city and this dog was a rescue where we didn't know the breed, neither did the vet. If we hadn't taken her in she would have been euthanized, so choosing a different breed wasn't really an option. You could walk her for hours a day and she'd still try to escape a fenced in yard, I don't think she really did ""tired"". She was fine on a run in the yard and was happy to be outside, I feel like it would have been far more cruel to force her to be inside all the time instead."
Net_Fort,fe2uxx0,t1_fe2mc44,"I disagree. I trained my dogs on a short lead, then gave them a longer leash as they started walking well, and now I let them both use a retractable leash because they dont pull on their leashes based on the progressive training. Using an extendable leash has also helped me train my dogs to be better off leash, because they tend to stay in the range of the extendable after some training. Granted, my dogs are 18 lbs and 40 lbs, and when I had a pyr I used a 10 foot rope leash instead of a retractable because an 80 lbs dog should probably be on something a bit more sturdy, but I think retractable get a lot of hate and are probably not accompanied by proper training and leash etiquette.  All of the issues like running into a car or up to other people can also be trained. My dogs know not to go into the road unless I step into it first and to stay next to me as we cross. They also know not to approach other people without permission"
NuclearQueen,fe3lt1q,t1_fe2mc44,"So basically train your dog, pay attention while walking them, and use common sense and there's no problem with retractable leashes. 

I trained my dog on a standard 6ft lead and moved to a 12ft retractable after a few years. When we moved cities, it was back to the standard lead for 6 months until we learned the lay of the land. Good owners can use a retractable leash, it's the lazy ones that make them dangerous."
Helloblablabla,feaeak3,t1_fe2mc44,"They have a place, on a well trained small dog where there are leash laws but you want to let them sniff a bit. 
Totally inappropriate for a large, strong dog like this."

MyOversoul,fe26bp3,t3_enkyak,"It's actually the smartest way to go about getting up to the top of the rocks since he's on a tie out. If he goes straight up normally,  the lead probably gets hung up on the rocks.  He avoids this by stretching the tie out to its full length so it doesn't drag,  and simply walks up the rocks backwards. Very intelligent problem solving on his behalf. I assume he's been doing this a while which is how you were able to video it. Hope your dogo has lots of good mental stimulation to enrich his life, because I'm sure he's capable of great things."

SoccerMomFromHell,fdpe2y8,t1_fdpdt25,"She gets crated when we're gone right now, and she tries her hardest to wake the neighborhood."
GooseJaw,fdpeg2p,t1_fdpe2y8,"I‚Äôve never met one who didn‚Äôt hate a crate.  Our old boy Scotch (God rest his soul) ate a blanket one time because he was in a crate and hated it.

How old is she?  I love her coloring.  It‚Äôs a fairly rare type for the breed."
SoccerMomFromHell,fdpf897,t1_fdpeg2p,"Thank you. She's 4 months old. I didn't mind if we got a male or female, but loved the liver and tan coloring. 

We've built-in a deluxe crate so she's stuck with it. Haha.   She doesn't mind it and will willingly go in at night. But, if we leave during the day she would rather play with Loki so she gets annoyed."
GooseJaw,fdpfew4,t1_fdpf897,Oh ok.  If she‚Äôs a liver and tan she might lighten up more then.  I thought she was older from the pics.  Are you prepared to have a 115 pound dog?  She‚Äôs gonna be a big girl.  She‚Äôll be a gorgeous goof ball though.
SoccerMomFromHell,fdpfisf,t1_fdpfew4,Looking forward to it! We've had a Great Dane before. Big sweethearts. Georgia is a total a-hole and I love every minute.
SoccerMomFromHell,fdpkrjm,t1_fdpfew4,Red looks on the larger side. Is he not heavier than 115?
GooseJaw,fdpkv6u,t1_fdpkrjm,That‚Äôs what he weighed at his last vet appointment.  That‚Äôs about normal for a male.  The females usually for 100-115.  I think you have a big girl on your hands.

After a strike on an insurgent camp the only thing left was a dog, my cousin told the dog to go to to the chopper and he did. His army buddy ""Rubber"" was adamant they weren't taking this ""kaffir dog"" and tried to kick the dog out but my cousin got it on the chopper anyway. 

10 years later, Rubber visited the family and an otherwise peaceful, placid amazing dog bit the fuck out of Rubber at first sniff.

She had a rock hard mass on her stomach one day and I freaked out and rushed her to the vet assuming it had to be a tumor or something. We'd just lost our male cat to a chronic urinary blockage issue that presents the same way but the vet had told me it usually doesn't affect female cats. I'm trying not to cry in the exam room while they take little Swarley back for an xray. The vet comes in and says, ""so...Swarley's a boy cat..."" Turned out it was the same type of urinary blockage but we caught it early enough that he fully recovered and hasn't had an issue with it since. He had to stay at the vet for a week for treatment and everyone called him Victor Victoria the whole time."

You came in needlessly aggressive about an issue no one else was discussing and turned an anecdote into an argument.

FirstTimeWang,fdhs920,t1_fdhapvn,"I have a 125 pound mastiff and she eats about 35 lbs. of kibble per month plus maybe 25% of that more in treats.

imronburgandy9,fdihqhi,t1_fdi3wz0,"I'm surprised so many people feel the same way, mine tore up other toys but never the kong. Maybe because the filling is more of the attraction than the actual rubber. I've seen zoos use them for animals lol I want to see these monster dogs that destroy them"

Reallyhotshowers,fdm5m88,t1_fdkvaix,"They said their dogs weigh 150 lbs and 130 lbs, so they are in fact the weight of human beings. :)"
just_a_manatee,fdi9nru,t1_fdi8x6o,"Yeah that was the first toy I got them when they started teething. My mama Knute destroyed it in about a week, the lab took about a month. So far it takes about 3 months for each of them to take out an elk antler & it‚Äôs better for their teeth/health."
just_a_manatee,fdin6qj,t1_fdihqhi,I might take a video of the malamute doing it but probably not the lab because wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she would eat it now.
retief1,fdj542s,t1_fdiaouj,"My first lab was once left in the car for a bit as a puppy.  When my parents returned, he had eaten the covering off of their steering wheel and gearshift.  He also once ate a tin can, and we never saw that can again."
just_a_manatee,fdiyuff,t1_fdiwosa,My lab does this with sticks. Specifically with firewood. So much so that I bought a shed to keep it in instead of having it stacked around. Keeps the wood drier I guess.
Twallot,fdj6meq,t1_fdiwosa,"I love this. What a weirdo, especially for a lab since they usually can't control themselves around food. It's hard to get mad at them when they do stuff like that because it's so silly."

lordolxinator,fdifn4a,t1_fdhvolh,"My Bernese was like that. Always cuddled up. And when he was told it was bed time, he'd get up, walk around before getting up on his back legs to put his front paws over your shoulders and lean in for a hug before trotting off to bed. Also did it if you were sad, he'd waltz over and look at you with the puppy dog eyes to see if that helped, then paw at you until you crouched down. Then he'd give you a paws-over-the-shoulder hug until you cheered up, or until he had to start sniffing and slobbering over your ears to try and tickle you."

His wallet in the pants was the slam dunk for the prosecution. üòÇ"
Altacc1234321,fdhzoxq,t1_fdhs6gt,Geez what good puppies. Hopefully that dude learnt a lesson.
Happinessrules,fdhf5ic,t3_elckp3,That is the biggest dog I have ever seen.  I can't imagine what it's like cleaning up the yard after him.  But he is a very handsome guy.
loveshercoffee,fdhhf02,t1_fdhf5ic,We have an English Mastiff and a Mastiff/Labrador. They're both around 150 lbs. The best thing about the poop is that it's easy to find to pick it all up and you never accidentally step in it.
FishingForAl,fdhg1kw,t1_fdhf5ic,"It's actually not so bad. I have a 130 lb Italian mastiff and we do a couple walks a day, plus trips to the back yard and it's a pretty easy job of dog poop bag pick up."
MisterBuzz,fdhk52k,t1_fdhf5ic,"I dog-sat for a friend who had a bull mastiff, not as big as the one here but still around 120 lbs. The dog almost pulled me down more than once while walking, and one time jumped on another person walking by and I couldn't do anything to pull him off. He was so sweet but also massive, his name was Tank.



And yes, his poops were bigger than mine."
jylcat,fdinbbw,t1_fdhf5ic,"My brother is a big guy too, 6' 4"", when the dog sat on me like this it was more overwhelming. Like a person on you."
catsloveart,fdj6rtq,t1_fdhf5ic,A high protein diet makes the poop smell less and dry out faster. Within a few days it‚Äôs dust. Excepting winters of course. Then they are just poopsicles.
annav0ig,fdhgafr,t1_fdhf5ic,Always my first thought when I see these ginormous dogs. How big the poop must be
DrKrowman,fdhbph8,t3_elckp3,She's a bean bag
Waatulakula,fdhezh3,t3_elckp3,I think when god created dogs he mixed up the personalities and put them in the wrong bodies. Big dogs like mastiffs and Danes are big puppies that think they should be snuggled in your lap at all times. While chihuahuas and other little dogs are almost alway little assholes.
Theyallknowme,fdhhg18,t1_fdhezh3,It does seem weird but can you imagine 175lbs of aggressive dog? I believe Mastiffs (dont know about Danes) are bred to be protective but not aggressive. IIRC any Mastiff showing hints of aggression is either put down or most definitely sterilized to make sure those traits are not passed on. What we have now is a huge baby of a dog that will protect without the anger component.
Frondescence,fdi1a1u,t1_fdhezh3,"Despite most people‚Äôs experiences, chihuahuas can actually be very affectionate, playful, intelligent dogs, but they definitely do not warm up quickly to strangers. I really think it‚Äôs just a survival thing. They‚Äôre small, so they act tough and are extremely skeptical of the unfamiliar."
Seerws,fdhyo7o,t1_fdhezh3,When *humans created dogs
FidgetyGidget,fdi2nly,t1_fdhezh3,"Honestly, we had a couple big dogs as a kid and have two chihuahua mixes now. At least one of them must be being held or the yelling starts. Also if there‚Äôs a lap and she‚Äôs not in it, everyone hears about it. The other wants to be playing 90% of the time, but if she‚Äôs sleepy then snuggles must happen or she‚Äôll throw her food bowl around in a little tantrum. They‚Äôre cuddle monsters... but vocal cuddle monsters."
clamsplitter69,fdhl2jw,t1_fdhhg18,"Another aspect you gotta think about is the impact of the same actions taken by a dog that weighs 150lbs vs a dog who weighs 15lbs. 

I have 2 English mastiffs and a rottweiler. I'm constantly reminding my big guys not to jump on people when they're outside in the yard. They think the people want to play and dont understand that they are huge. 

On the other hand my friend has a 15lb French bulldog and she's constantly jumping on me and I dont think twice about it. It's just cute to me and not indicative of bad behavior because no harm is coming from it even though it is bad behavior. A person who doesn't love dogs may think differently, but in the end its really doing no harm.

So the small dogs behaviors are forgiven much easier and go by less noticed, where as a big dog (with a responsible owner) is constantly being reminded not to do certain behaviors because everything is exponentially more impactful."
AlisaLolita,fdhjhn6,t1_fdhhg18,"My Great Pyrenees mix is the same way.  Zero aggression unless he thinks I need protecting. Even in those instances, the first few times caught me off guard and he managed to get his mouth on someone, he never broke skin. Just warning chomps."
Waatulakula,fdhmlty,t1_fdhhg18,I believe Danes were bread for hunting and protection. Mine passed away five or so years ago and was big baby. But when someone tried to break into my detached garage one night he would not stop barking until I let him out. Long story short a 150lb dog very quickly changed that mans mind about robbing us.
MarkBeeblebrox,fdhkf6j,t1_fdhhg18,Mastiffs followed armies and ate the bodies of the dead. They were originally guard dogs too.
FidgetyGidget,fdi33h1,t1_fdi1a1u,"Literally every visitor to our house gets the chihuahua alarm, then harassed for snuggles. Like, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an intruder but I‚Äôm 7 lbs., large human friend, pay attention! Oh, they‚Äôre cool? Well great. New friend, HOLD ME.‚Äù"
jetpack_operation,fdhngze,t1_fdhl2jw,Yep and now extrapolate that to historical breeding practices. It's not an accident at all that larger dogs meant to be pets tend to have more aggressiveness bred out of them.

The professor had early stages of Parkinson‚Äôs and mobility issues were starting up. So he had two mastiffs that accompanied him to class each day as his service animals, and he leaned on them for support as needed. They also helped him walk between his office and classes. (His wife took a few courses on campus and helped him get back and forth from home.)

But then she started getting severe skin problems. The vet told us she was allergic to the wheat in the Ceasars. (Who knew when you fed your dog cheap and poorly made food bad things can happen?! /s) Thus ended the era of the Ceasar in our house. This poor doggo of mine went insane. She refused to eat. She would whine and whinge at us incessantly. She even threw a few epic tantrums that would put the world's angriest toddler to shame. With time and a *lot* of patience she eventually ended her crackhead withdrawal from Ceasars. We had to stop using the word in our house from the on though. (We learned the hard way to never say things such as ""Cesar salad."") 

A few months after she'd come out of her Ceasar addled fog, my SO and I sat down and watched Planet of the Apes. When one of the characters inevitably said ""Cesar"" she lost her freaking mind. She barked and danced and jumped up and down. Every. Single. Time. It was simultaneously hilarious and heart breaking."

raymartini,fdkkplt,t3_elolaq,"Never understood crating, maybe its just cos in the UK people dont usually crate but I imagine my pets would be bored in one room never-mind a crate"
forgotmyabcs,fdkvipi,t1_fdkkplt,"I have an Australian Shepherd rescue. When I got him he had been abused severely. This led to him having a lot of issues, and our vet says she's pretty sure he has some form of ptsd. When I first got him I decided I would have to crate train him for when I left the house because of his extreme separation anxiety. This would never be for more than an hour or two because I lived with my grandmother and taking care of her was a full time job. The first time he was put into a crate, I walked away for five minutes to pee, and he chewed through the steel bars to get out. I stopped attempting to crate train him, and instead left him in the bathroom so any mess would be isolated. 

When I moved back in with my mom, he developed extreme canine aggression as well as arthritis in his hips. Bailey would often go after her other dogs and was living his life isolated from them. We would juggle them and try to keep them separated to eliminate the risk of him snapping. Slowly we added him to the mix. When we weren't home he would destroy anything he could get to. He ate my bedroom floor, a mattress, and several other large cost items. I was at my wits end. Her other dogs are crate trained but rarely need to be in the kennel. It was mostly used to potty train. When she got a new puppy, we began the crate training process, and it's like a switch flipped in Bailey's brain. He started to respond to the phrase ""let's go to our house,"" and going to the kennel, even though it wasn't directed towards him. At this point, he loves it. He won't eat slowly unless his food is in the kennel. If it's out, he eats so fast he throws up. When it gets stressful or his back and hips hurt, he goes in his kennel and pulls the door shut behind him so he gets some time alone. He knows when I'm leaving for work, and he goes to sit in the kennel. I never lock the door, but I do pull a blanket down over the entrance so it's dark and cozy for him, and he's always there when I get back - happy as can be. He knows he can get out, but never does. It's his safe place. He gets food and water in it, has a lovely soft memory foam bed that helps with his back. He has probably ten blankets piled up inside there that he can nestle into. The other dogs are pretty much the same way with their kennels. They enjoy being in them because we have taught them that they are an optional safe place they can go to and be left alone. They each have their own and they stay out of the others except for our smallest chi mix who occasionally will cuddle with Bailey in his kennel if she's lonely. 

I say this because not all kennel training is bad. Every situation is different. If your dog despises being caged then you're doing something wrong. It's the same way with muzzle training. All of our dogs are muzzle trained for their safety. When they go to the groomer or vet and need to be muzzle they're OK with it because we took the time to make it okay for them. When they get boarded while we are away, they don't even bark to be let out, since they know that being in the box means that they have their own space to be. Do I condone locking your animals up for long periods of time while you're away from the house ? Hell fucking no. Do I recommend kennel training for dogs? Yes. It's a tool, and it's a good one. Use it wisely (not as punishment), and it will be a great experience for them. Every situation is different, and it's up to the pet owner to work with their vet and their individual pets to find out what they need."
DamnYouRichardParker,fdlna6h,t1_fdkkplt,I think that if you're going to leave a pet in a crate all day. You shouldn't have a pet. It's just so cruel for the animal.
raymartini,fdl5tp6,t1_fdkvipi,"Thank you for sharing - that‚Äôs definitely enlightening for me. I definitely think its a cultural thing to an extent as here in the UK I dont know any dogs who were crated (although they were locked in one room if the owner was out for a short amount of time). Totally get the benefits you mentioned though and can see how its helpful for abused animals. My cats are rescues and when i first got the second i had her in one room away from my other cat (as they were both moody princesses) and gradually introduced them. Luna, the new cat, was badly abused and recovering from giving birth and being neutered. She hid for ages behind a bed and gradually she gained her confidence. Eventually she would scratch at the door to be out so we started letting he roam free and introduced the cats with play. I cant imagine i could keep her in a single room now if i go out as it seems to make her more nervous. 
My auntie has a rescue greyhound and i think they gradually trained him to be sensible around the house when shes out. Hes a pretty well behaved dog though despite his past"

Dawnimal1969,fdk014e,t1_fdjt3il,"I have ten dogs. Five of my own and five fosters. Some get crated at night and when we are gone for various reasons. Some adore their crates and hang out there when they don‚Äôt have to. At night it signals when they want to go to bed. I don‚Äôt let them have the run of the house when I‚Äôm sleeping anymore than I‚Äôd be ok with a toddler exploring at night. Some dogs who are from puppy mills and have literally lived their lives in cages (8+ years...fucking horrible) I would never put in a crate. 

Many of the owner surrender dogs I foster spent upwards of 17 hours in crates every day. It‚Äôs sickening. But some dogs love their little dens and when I can‚Äôt find them they are usually burrowed under blankets inside them."
super_common_name,fdjtfth,t1_fdjt3il,"Thank you! 

It's *extremely* popular and no one ever talks about the amount of time a dog should be left in a crate, nor how old they should be when you stop crate training. I'm always worried that people leave their dogs in crates all day when they're at work. It's insane.

I wish the word ""crate"" had never been invented. It's a cage. People are putting their dogs in cages. If they called it what it really is, I think people would be more careful about it. It's one thing to put a puppy in a cage at night while everyone is sleeping, but it's another to keep dogs in cages for hours on end.

I hate it. I think it's overused, overhyped, and the dangers aren't sufficiently talked about."
FaygoNbluntz,fdjvut8,t1_fdjt3il,"Most people who crate train their dogs in the US are not leaving their dogs in there all day and night. It‚Äôs actually recommended to have a crate for the dog because they need their own space that is specifically for them...like a den. I did it with my dog as a puppy because it is extremely helpful for potty training for they won‚Äôt go in their crate because it‚Äôs their home. It teaches them to hold it longer when you may be away for an hour or two. I never left my dog in his crate for more than an hour, and he loved that thing. When he would need his own space I‚Äôd find him sleeping in there or hanging out in it. These crates are made to fit for certain weights. My dog is an 85lb Doberman/German Shepherd and could fully walk and turn in his crate comfortably. I got rid of the crate at 1 years old and he‚Äôs been a gem without it, but I feel it really helped him avoid potty accidents (he was potty trained in 3 days), chewing furniture, and ripping up trash. Yes you can say if you train your dog right you don‚Äôt need a crate, but they‚Äôre some dogs with major separation anxiety, teething, and other problems that a crate helps when you have to leave the house and don‚Äôt want your stuff to get destroyed. It‚Äôs not as inhumane as what you think as long as you‚Äôre not locking them up all day, and you have the proper sized crate for your dog. My dog was properly trained from day one but most dog trainers recommend crate training now."
sammy_nobrains,fdjxnas,t1_fdjt3il,"He was still a puppy and we would crate him when we weren't home. In hindsight, it's not something I would do again but yes it is something many Americans do when puppy isn't fully trained yet."

rugabuga12345,fdli6a6,t1_fdjt3il,It is common for idiots in the US to crates dogs without reason. It is also cmom for idiots around the world to let cats roam unattended.
eketharr,fdk8ihu,t1_fdk014e,"Of course there are some situations that require different means of action. My comment was more about how it's so popular just to leave training all together and just put the dog in a cage so it's easier for the owner (I know not all think that). 

My dog doesn't mind the crate and it's used to it, but I never lock him in there so he can go whenever he pleases. At nights we do close our bedroom door so the dog doesn't roam around listening to all the things that go bump in the night. There is a difference how you use the crate, the crate itself isn't an evil thing. 

As a tool of training I don't mind using the crate. But it absolutely should be seen as a temporary thing and not for extended periods of time. In Finland it's about 4 hours tops to keep a dog in a crate and there are requirements for how big of a space dog should have as a regular living space. I've gotten the idea it's more of a nom especially in the US to keep a dog in a cage for a work day which seems incredibly long time to be restricted even if the cage is ""big enough""."

As soon as I was able I took him. I bought him a crate cause I thought some dogs like them to have as their own space. Just leave the door open and they can rest in there when and if they want. Anyway, he‚Äôs never looked at it once. No way he wanted in there. And he‚Äôs perfect. Never destructive. No accidents."
JusABigBigBoy,fdjuix7,t1_fdjtfth,"Agreed, Americans think leaving a dog in a crate all day/night is a responsible and humane way to  deal with owning a dog. Not even a large enclosure, but a fucking crate. It should be illegal."
Mewssbites,fdk8qr0,t1_fdjtfth,"Okay, I'm not the only one then?!?

I got a puppy around 2 years ago, first one I'd had in over a decade, and suddenly all the experts are advocating crate training, talking about how it's a dog's natural instinct, etc.. here's the thing though. If it's truly natural, you don't really have to ""train"" for it. It's a rare cat that needs litter box TRAINING... usually it's just a matter of ""hey cat here's the litter box"" and nature takes its course. 

Seems like some dogs really do take to it easily and like spending time in there. My dog? Oh god. It was a nightmare. The nightmare didn't stop until we stopped attempting to crate train him. We tried all the tricks, but he was so anxious just being in the crate that there was no way to make it more pleasant - he's super food motivated but would have nothing to do with any kind of treats in the crate with the door closed.

He's 2 and a half now, and everything is awesome and we love him to bits. He has free reign of the place when we're at work and does absolutely fine - if restricted, he immediately gets separation anxiety and develops behavior issues. It's not a picture-perfect solution, but it works for us."
Stimmolation,fdk4u84,t1_fdjvut8,Exactly.  We still have the crate because our dog will go there when he wants to nap. It hasn't been closed in years.
ArkLife1,fdjx89f,t1_fdjudy3,They like they're personal space in the crate if you use it properly though.
eketharr,fdk7iik,t1_fdk4235,"Well it's not completely illegal, but there is a limit how many hours it's allowed to keep a dog in, IIRC it's about 4 hours max.

It can be used as a _temporary_ tool for training, but from what I understand for many it's a permanent and easy way of restraining the dog from demolishing the house. It seems normal to keep the dog in a cage for work days which to me sounds like a horribly long time for a dog to be alone in a small space. 

So my point is it's clearly viewed differently in different places. Our dog trainers absolutely advocate training beside the ""crating"" and it should not be a permanent solution. In Finland some do restrict dogs to a specific part of the house if needed, but there are definite requirements for how big the space should be for a dog. But I'd say a majority of our pets aren't really restricted or crated when left alone."
eketharr,fdk2ho4,t1_fdk011h,"There is a limit how many hours it's ok to leave a dog in a cage, from what I remember it's around 4 hours. Of course many people use it still and it's difficult to prove if the dog is really spending more time in that cage.

Many people take it as a easy way out and a replacement for training your dog properly. Of course if used right it is a great device to help your dog to adapt to different places and situations but many people are just lazy and keep their dog there."

MENNONH,fdl92xd,t1_fdk011h,Dogs prefer the small enclosed area of a crate and can be more nervous outside of a crate. It's like a den for them. Making them feel more secure and calm. My dogs will go in their crate randomly just because they want to. We leave it open and will find them in it sleeping sometimes.
jeswesky,fdk9gba,t1_fdk8ihu,"It is a very normal thing.  I think a lot of people start when the dog is a puppy and destructive when left alone, but because they don't know how to properly transition them to being out of the cage all day with out destroying anything they just keep getting locked up.  If an adult dog is destroying things when left alone, there is either a lack or training or a deeper psychological issue that should be addressed."
MelloYelloMarshmello,fdl5oih,t1_fdk8ihu,"Id say for the most part it's not to avoid training and its an important part of the training! I only crate the dogs when I am not present to watch them or if there's any reason I don't want them wandering the house.  It's incredibly hard to train a dog to not do things when you are not there to show them that what they are doing is wrong or re-direct bad behavior to different activities. Honestly, Id says I only crate my adult dogs when I have guests who do not like dogs over or when Im cleaning and just want to be able to clean the floors without them trying to play on the wet floor next to me haha.   


Also, I second that dogs like their crates. My dogs often sleep in their crate without me forcing them to (they have never been forced to sleep on the crate) they just enjoy it. They will walk in there when they feel sleepy to take a nap and cuddle together."

Now, he is perfectly content to hang out on my bed or the couch all day while I'm at work and sleeps either in my bed or on his bed on the floor next to mine.  

He does, however, freak out any time he sees a crate that looks like his old one now.  There are dogs that like the crate as a ""safe space"" of their own, he is not one of them.  I took the door off even to see if he wanted to be in there, and he made it clear he did not.  Got rid of it, and he will never be caged again.  Even had to work with the vet to make sure where he would be when going in to get neutered was large enough that he wouldn't associate it with a crate and get freaked out."

The poor thing didn't know how to bark, climb stairs, what a toy was, how to walk on grass, how to run, she didn't know how to be a dog. Sadly she also didn't get vet visits and had cancer when we adopted her but I like to think we gave her the best 2 years of her life.

loveshercoffee,fdk5z9g,t1_fdjy7iz,"We taught our dog out of separation anxiety by being away from him for increasingly longer and longer periods of time, starting with just five minutes outside where he could see us. We always gave treats when we came back in and nothing was destroyed.

We lost a sofa and the vinyl off the kitchen floor before we realized he had the anxiety! He's 150 lbs so knowing he was going to be so big, we knew he would be able to take out a wall if we didn't get it under control.

Also, if it's a real problem, your vet can give you Xanax for him. Even a small dose can take the edge off if training isn't enough or if he's not able to handle as much time as is needed."
Domer2012,fdke2w1,t1_fdjy7iz,"Same here, we tried letting our rescue just chill at home while we were at work/school, but we really just had to start relegating him to his cage after he ate part of a rug and had to have it surgically removed... *two times*. Sure, *maybe* there were ways of gradually working out his separation anxiety, but keeping him locked up for the workday was the only way to know we were avoiding another life-risking, $3000 surgery. 

He was a perfectly happy dog when we were around, very chill and affectionate, slept on my bed with me every night, went on plenty of walks, had a huge yard to patrol, etc. I think there‚Äôs more grey area between the extremes of ‚Äúabusive owner‚Äù and ‚Äúthis dog is equivalent to a human baby!‚Äù than a lot of people want to admit, and I think a lot of reddit falls squarely in the latter extreme and are willing to classify anything as animal abuse if it would be considered abusive toward a human."

Yeah crating as a training method is fine as long as it is only temporary and not a solution. When my dog was a pup we fenced off the space so he had kitchen and the foyer to use - minimal things to destroy and the smaller space to ""guard"" calmed him down.

Basically only thing that may work is time, we have almost had him a year, hopefully with time he will realize we aren't leaving him. We take him to daycare during the work week, only time he has to deal with being alone is if we go out to do something for shorter periods of time.

There's very little that can fear me from a dog but other people are so scared of him for no reason. Maybe it's his size. But he's a big baby he used to have a sister named Betty she was the tiniest little mutt but she still bossed him around at every turn.
gloomseek,fdkuvp1,t1_fdk8ndz,"could be the German shepherd in him, they're very good guard dogs. He looks like a sweetie though"
