fallopian_turd,fdwz6z9,t3_en84sk,My dog does this while shitting sometimes.   Super embarrassing when people just stare at you like its your fault
PixelPantsAshli,fdx1h3o,t1_fdwz6z9,Tell them not to kink shame your dog.

Then he sees them and starts trying to wag his tail, poop, and hump the air at the same time while showing his red rocket to toddlers"

elo3661ga,fe07l3z,t1_fdymg4e,Aaaaaand your comment made me also Google and I really wish I had stayed ignorant.
IMWeasel,fdybypp,t1_fdy87c4,"That's such an intensely creepy sub. Their FAQ makes them sound like people who had some bad experiences with dogs and simply don't like how common it is to own dogs. But their posts include rampant dehumanization of dog owners, visceral hatred of all dogs, and countless fantasies of inflicting violence on dogs/dog owners over the most minor of issues."
fallopian_turd,fdy10c2,t1_fdy0hbk,Lol its almost like god punishing me for being a jackass
fallopian_turd,fdyed5h,t1_fdye195,Sometimes he gets a boner when i get home from work.   Not sure what thats all about
fallopian_turd,fdxy91x,t1_fdxx2ym,Yeah he is special.    He once found and ate a role of aluminum foil from neighbors house as a puppy.   Not the brightest you could say.  But very friendly
dirkalict,fdzwo5c,t1_fdxx2ym,A smooth criminal.
fallopian_turd,fe02u04,t1_fe00ape,Hes pretty great.  Whenever we go anywhere like petsmart u can guarantee he will take a nasty shit in there no matter how many times u have him go outside before we walk in.
voyonsdonctabarnak,fe0e24e,t1_fe04xvf,It was in Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay IIRC
pickles404,fe0bnib,t1_fe07l3z,Do I wanna know?
BatHickey,fdye806,t1_fdybypp,"Yeah it’s one of those things you find on the internet and are just like ‘fuck, ok...’ . 

My mom got bit by a dog back in the day and is kinda wary of big dogs now, and I grew up with a neighbors cocker spaniel that used to hump 24/7 and was gross. I don’t know how you turn into a dog version of incels tho."
adudeguyman,fdyiw4u,t1_fdyed5h,He loves you.
MadAzza,fdzdaqy,t1_fdyed5h,"Dude, stop. I can’t breathe for laughing."

elo3661ga,fe07d1b,t1_fe02u04,"Oh my GOD, I’m crying here!! Your dog needs his own show so we can all laugh all day."
30222504cf,fe0p3hz,t1_fe0e24e,Oh thank you.  Still disgusting but at least it started out as comedy.
elo3661ga,fe0coup,t1_fe0bnib,No it’s just gross. The description kinda made me throw up in my mouth a little.
IMWeasel,fdyqmsj,t1_fdye806,"My mom also got bit by a dog when she was young and has a minor phobia of bigger dogs, but even when a big dog jumps and barks at her, she doesn't feel hatred for the owner. On the other hand, my dad has never had a traumatizing experience with a dog, and he grew up with dogs at home, but he's the one that has made ""jokes"" about putting out antifreeze to kill local dogs who dug up some of our garden. ""Joking"" about killing animals that annoy you is much more likely to be caused by weird right wing beliefs about the way things should be, than by childhood trauma involving dogs."
spinfulcassette,fdzxxc4,t1_fdzdaqy,This thread has me crying
fallopian_turd,fdxzhmv,t1_fdxz50b,Hes a mix.   Half german shepherd/ bull mastiff and great dane mix.     He kinda looks like a lab though.

cbackas,fe2ncvn,t1_fe2mfqo,My parents generally have to put our dog on a leash and walk him out to the backyard go to the bathroom otherwise he goes crazy barking at dogs on the other side of the fence. Not exactly the same scenario as a fixed tether I suppose - seems like there’s definitely ways that go go wrong
c14rk0,fearyr2,t1_fe2mfqo,What if you have a dog that will just dig or break out of any fence? Had a dog in the past where this was the case. We literally ended up with a standard fence then a 6 inches or so of larger rocks and gravel before  a foot or so high board that was partially buried into the ground all along the fence. Even then that wasn't always enough to keep her from finding a way out of the yard somehow.
MrJsmanan,fe2k523,t1_fe1z4rg,Why do retractable leash’s suck?
Th3V3rg3,fe2r3ci,t1_fe2ncvn,It’s for people that chained their dogs to trees and ignored them. You definitely leash your dog.
Th3V3rg3,feav52x,t1_fearyr2,"Leave it inside, or get a breed more suited for living in the city limits. My Pyrenees would do the same if u didn’t walk the heck out of em. Was a struggle in the middle of winter. 

I’d rather have a law so trash can’t chain up dogs for years at a time, which happens. You have to admit that’s cruel to do."
MilesyART,fe2mc44,t1_fe2k523,"A lot of reasons

They can break your thumb if you don’t hold it right. The dog doesn’t get the chance to actually learn what an acceptable distance from you is, allowing it to wander too far too quickly and jump into traffic, into people or other dogs, or just where it generally isn’t allowed. It also means that when you lock it, and the dog goes running, it doesn’t know the leash is locked. It tries to run, hurts itself, you, and probably gets loose because you just ate shit and are no longer holding onto the leash. The absolute lack of boundaries presented by the leash also puts the dog in charge, rather than you, so when you do try to discipline it when you finally lock the leash or get a traditional one, it challenges you and decides to just ignore your every word. 

Basically, it’s unsafe for you, the dog, and everyone around you. Your dog could get hit by a car, attack or get attacked by another dog, hurt or get hurt by someone who doesn’t want dog running at them, and generally learns all sorts of bad habits."
c14rk0,feayect,t1_feav52x,"I mean I don't live in a city and this dog was a rescue where we didn't know the breed, neither did the vet. If we hadn't taken her in she would have been euthanized, so choosing a different breed wasn't really an option. You could walk her for hours a day and she'd still try to escape a fenced in yard, I don't think she really did ""tired"". She was fine on a run in the yard and was happy to be outside, I feel like it would have been far more cruel to force her to be inside all the time instead."
Net_Fort,fe2uxx0,t1_fe2mc44,"I disagree. I trained my dogs on a short lead, then gave them a longer leash as they started walking well, and now I let them both use a retractable leash because they dont pull on their leashes based on the progressive training. Using an extendable leash has also helped me train my dogs to be better off leash, because they tend to stay in the range of the extendable after some training. Granted, my dogs are 18 lbs and 40 lbs, and when I had a pyr I used a 10 foot rope leash instead of a retractable because an 80 lbs dog should probably be on something a bit more sturdy, but I think retractable get a lot of hate and are probably not accompanied by proper training and leash etiquette.  All of the issues like running into a car or up to other people can also be trained. My dogs know not to go into the road unless I step into it first and to stay next to me as we cross. They also know not to approach other people without permission"
NuclearQueen,fe3lt1q,t1_fe2mc44,"So basically train your dog, pay attention while walking them, and use common sense and there's no problem with retractable leashes. 

I trained my dog on a standard 6ft lead and moved to a 12ft retractable after a few years. When we moved cities, it was back to the standard lead for 6 months until we learned the lay of the land. Good owners can use a retractable leash, it's the lazy ones that make them dangerous."
Helloblablabla,feaeak3,t1_fe2mc44,"They have a place, on a well trained small dog where there are leash laws but you want to let them sniff a bit. 
Totally inappropriate for a large, strong dog like this."
Th3V3rg3,febi2i2,t1_feayect,Aye probably unfortunately you have to legislate people with 12 brain cells.

In all seriousness though that's something that I've heard of happening (a friend of a guy I work with had their dog accidentally hang itself from their porch), and I've seen the aftermath of it myself, a tethered goat doing lawnmower duty that went off a ledge. Please be careful with how your dog is restrained."

MyOversoul,fe26bp3,t3_enkyak,"It's actually the smartest way to go about getting up to the top of the rocks since he's on a tie out. If he goes straight up normally,  the lead probably gets hung up on the rocks.  He avoids this by stretching the tie out to its full length so it doesn't drag,  and simply walks up the rocks backwards. Very intelligent problem solving on his behalf. I assume he's been doing this a while which is how you were able to video it. Hope your dogo has lots of good mental stimulation to enrich his life, because I'm sure he's capable of great things."

Vampilton,fdqqoq3,t1_fdqk00d,"No, the one where she's sleeping and it looks like maybe her ear is tucked into the corner of her mouth."
SoccerMomFromHell,fdp81y6,t1_fdp70hc,"Loki is the small white one, Georgia is the bloodhound puppy."
SoccerMomFromHell,fdqt0gh,t1_fdqqoq3,She sucks on her ears...and plays with them tucked into her mouth so Loki can't use them against her.

GooseJaw,fdpdjej,t3_emehif,"Bloodhounds are such wonderful doofuses.  My boy Red (pics in my profile) is the biggest goof ball on the planet.  Does she bay?

Also, you should post this on r/bloodhound too."

GooseJaw,fdpdt25,t1_fdpdq7j,"Most don’t have as deep a voice as Red does, but she’ll get there.  Then you’ll have no end of trouble getting her to stop.

And thank you, he’s an idiot but at least he’s pretty."
SoccerMomFromHell,fdpe2y8,t1_fdpdt25,"She gets crated when we're gone right now, and she tries her hardest to wake the neighborhood."
GooseJaw,fdpeg2p,t1_fdpe2y8,"I’ve never met one who didn’t hate a crate.  Our old boy Scotch (God rest his soul) ate a blanket one time because he was in a crate and hated it.

How old is she?  I love her coloring.  It’s a fairly rare type for the breed."
SoccerMomFromHell,fdpf897,t1_fdpeg2p,"Thank you. She's 4 months old. I didn't mind if we got a male or female, but loved the liver and tan coloring. 

We've built-in a deluxe crate so she's stuck with it. Haha.   She doesn't mind it and will willingly go in at night. But, if we leave during the day she would rather play with Loki so she gets annoyed."
GooseJaw,fdpfew4,t1_fdpf897,Oh ok.  If she’s a liver and tan she might lighten up more then.  I thought she was older from the pics.  Are you prepared to have a 115 pound dog?  She’s gonna be a big girl.  She’ll be a gorgeous goof ball though.
SoccerMomFromHell,fdpfisf,t1_fdpfew4,Looking forward to it! We've had a Great Dane before. Big sweethearts. Georgia is a total a-hole and I love every minute.
SoccerMomFromHell,fdpkrjm,t1_fdpfew4,Red looks on the larger side. Is he not heavier than 115?
GooseJaw,fdpkv6u,t1_fdpkrjm,That’s what he weighed at his last vet appointment.  That’s about normal for a male.  The females usually for 100-115.  I think you have a big girl on your hands.
SoccerMomFromHell,fdpm29r,t1_fdpkv6u,"Yes -- her momma was also quite large. I listened to the videos, his voice is crazy deep."

After a strike on an insurgent camp the only thing left was a dog, my cousin told the dog to go to to the chopper and he did. His army buddy ""Rubber"" was adamant they weren't taking this ""kaffir dog"" and tried to kick the dog out but my cousin got it on the chopper anyway. 

10 years later, Rubber visited the family and an otherwise peaceful, placid amazing dog bit the fuck out of Rubber at first sniff.

Good boys dont forget."

She had a rock hard mass on her stomach one day and I freaked out and rushed her to the vet assuming it had to be a tumor or something. We'd just lost our male cat to a chronic urinary blockage issue that presents the same way but the vet had told me it usually doesn't affect female cats. I'm trying not to cry in the exam room while they take little Swarley back for an xray. The vet comes in and says, ""so...Swarley's a boy cat..."" Turned out it was the same type of urinary blockage but we caught it early enough that he fully recovered and hasn't had an issue with it since. He had to stay at the vet for a week for treatment and everyone called him Victor Victoria the whole time."

Forevernevermore,fdlxp67,t1_fdls622,"It takes effort on your part to get offended in this instance. Every reasonable adult on here that has purchased a home (myself included) is a decent enough human being to politely ask the homeowner to remove their dog from the yard so I can look at it. They still live there, and the yard is the best place to put their dogs.

You are being downvoted, because your concern is such a non-issue, that your post really only serves to highlight that you're an entitled asshole without much sense for human interaction."

HouseWife93,fdm4nlz,t1_fdls622,"I don’t think the reason you’re getting downvoted is because you’re right. I personally have dogs, bought a house from owners with dogs, and we all had our dogs not involved in the process. 

I think the issue is that the tone of the room didn’t lend to make the assertion in the first place. Essentially, you’re at a cocktail party and walk over to a group of people who are talking about their dogs and their experiences with their dogs while selling.. then to introduce yourself you said “Oh I hate that! I don’t want that when I buy a house. Here’s why I’m right!” 

You came in needlessly aggressive about an issue no one else was discussing and turned an anecdote into an argument. I believe you’re right in allowing potential buyers access to the whole home, there’s nothing entitled about expecting that at an open home. I just don’t think this was the time to bring it up, at least not so rudely to someone you don’t know who was just sharing an anecdote about their dog."

AllAboutLove,fdhhurs,t1_fdhapvn,I had a 200lb mastiff growing up.  My dad paid me to pick up the poop piles.  I used a shovel and a stick.
st0pmakings3ns3,fdhgz67,t1_fdhapvn,All of it.
just_a_manatee,fdhi1kl,t1_fdhapvn,I have a 150 lb malamute. She eats 3 lb of meat for breakfast & dinner. Lab weighs 130 & eats 2 lb for both & then some sort of snack in the middle of the day.
FirstTimeWang,fdhs920,t1_fdhapvn,"I have a 125 pound mastiff and she eats about 35 lbs. of kibble per month plus maybe 25% of that more in treats.

They don't eat as much as you'd think because they're usually pretty lazy."

MssDee,fdjdf28,t1_fdhi1kl,Are they fat  or lean?
RoseOfSharonCassidy,fdih3km,t1_fdhi1kl,"Both of your dogs are almost double what their breeds are supposed to weigh.  It's not a good thing to have bigger than average dogs; it's so hard on their hips (and the rest of the body, but especially the hips)."
iluvlamp2004,fdifwjf,t1_fdhi1kl,I just put my mastiff you sleep because he had untreatable cardiomyopathy caused by his size and high protein diet. I wish I had known but I didn’t so there’s that for you for what it’s worth.
TJNel,fdi958q,t1_fdhs920,I have a 130lb Wolfhound and yup they eat a bag a month. The larger the dog the less active they are so they don't need as much fuel.
barryandorlevon,fdi5ir2,t1_fdhs920,That’s how my Great Dane is!  The Rottweiler I used to have was much less lazy and ate so fuckin much food.

just_a_manatee,fdi4zxf,t1_fdho20m,"I feed them a raw meat diet with veggies etc cut into it that comes prepackaged so all I have to do is thaw the meat out & add the veggies (local business produces this dog food & I pick it up monthly). Then as a treat I also give them lamb legs, chicken backs, & various other goodies that that dog food place will have in stock. All in all I probably spend around $500 a month on food for them."

just_a_manatee,fdin47k,t1_fdih3km,"I agree, but they’re already lean for their size so I can’t exactly just chop off a leg to get them down to size. The malamute is more akin to their giant size & the lab, well not sure. A cousin of mine has a 100 lb lab from the same father, & apparently most of the dogs he fathers (generally once a year) weigh 100-120. They’re all chonkers."
just_a_manatee,fdimvgu,t1_fdifwjf,"Aww I’m sorry to hear that. That’s actually part of the reason my dogs don’t just get raw meat, they also get a healthy diet of fruits & veggies."
Veganarchistfem,fdjdztb,t1_fdi958q,"I have a five year old Wolfhound x St Bernard (55kg) and he eats less than my tiny ten year old female greyhound (25kg). When he first reached adult size we were feeding him based on his weight and he started getting way too chunky. It's astounding how little food he needs to maintain a healthy weight. But the greyhound has to be watched carefully because she drops weight too easily, despite being a total couch potato."
crepe-weirdough,fdhv4rp,t1_fdhn7fs,"If you find a toy he can't destroy, let me know PLEASE!"
sponge255,fdhrk9l,t1_fdhn7fs,My brothers lab is around that size. Great for cuddles!

just_a_manatee,fdi3u1s,t1_fdhn7fs,Yeah my dogs don’t really have real toys because they destroy anything & everything I give them as a toy. Generally I just buy elk antlers & they use them or as a treat a lamb leg that they destroy.
LaVieLaMort,fdhxyy2,t1_fdhn7fs,My friends have a yellow lab they got as a puppy. He was 55lbs at 6 months. He’s a year and change now and about 95lbs. He’s a freaking tank!

just_a_manatee,fdi5vfm,t1_fdi5cht,"Yeah I found out about it through a neighbor before I got my first dog & I raised her on it & she loves it, refuses to touch any other type of dog food at other peoples houses. The lab loves it too, but will inhale just about anything that she can get her hands on if you let her."
Reallyhotshowers,fdiczr5,t1_fdibdin,"Yeah but their dogs weigh as much as two people except their main food is meat instead of eating lots of cheaper stuff like rice, corn, grains, beans, potatoes, etc. If you and your girlfriend ate as much meat as those dogs your grocery bill would be that high too."
just_a_manatee,fdi9dx8,t1_fdi7h47,Ya hate to see it
just_a_manatee,fdiqabe,t1_fdiphfi,"Quality raw meat, veggies, & then snacks are expensive.

LaVieLaMort,fdhy1iq,t1_fdhwv26,I had a dachshund destroy one of the “indestructible” ones so I doubt they’ll stand up to a gigantic lab lol
just_a_manatee,fdi3wz0,t1_fdhwv26,Yeah Kong’s are more of a joke. Even their “tougher” range is still pretty much crap against any larger sized dog.
illy-chan,fdiajwh,t1_fdi5vfm,">The lab loves it too, but will inhale just about anything that she can get her hands on if you let her. 

Yep, that sounds like a lab. God help you if she ever decides that the drywall looks enough like food."
truenole81,fdkvaix,t1_fdiczr5,You are correct but I dont know anyone who weighs 100 lbs.  I feel incredibly poor now to be honest and I'm pretty well off

imronburgandy9,fdihqhi,t1_fdi3wz0,"I'm surprised so many people feel the same way, mine tore up other toys but never the kong. Maybe because the filling is more of the attraction than the actual rubber. I've seen zoos use them for animals lol I want to see these monster dogs that destroy them"
just_a_manatee,fdiaouj,t1_fdiajwh,She’s just about dumb enough to want to eat it.
MediocreVirtuoso,fdiwosa,t1_fdiajwh,"My lab is a hoarder. She hides as much food as she steals. I find entire packages of food like crackers, cookies, dinner rolls, etc hidden at the bottom of laundry baskets on a regular basis, basically unharmed. I also find dishes. Most impressive was my large cast iron skillet in the laundry room. I still don’t know how she pulled that off without breaking her teeth. I can barely lift it one-handed."
Reallyhotshowers,fdm5m88,t1_fdkvaix,"They said their dogs weigh 150 lbs and 130 lbs, so they are in fact the weight of human beings. :)"
just_a_manatee,fdi9nru,t1_fdi8x6o,"Yeah that was the first toy I got them when they started teething. My mama Knute destroyed it in about a week, the lab took about a month. So far it takes about 3 months for each of them to take out an elk antler & it’s better for their teeth/health."
just_a_manatee,fdin6qj,t1_fdihqhi,I might take a video of the malamute doing it but probably not the lab because wouldn’t be surprised if she would eat it now.
retief1,fdj542s,t1_fdiaouj,"My first lab was once left in the car for a bit as a puppy.  When my parents returned, he had eaten the covering off of their steering wheel and gearshift.  He also once ate a tin can, and we never saw that can again."
just_a_manatee,fdiyuff,t1_fdiwosa,My lab does this with sticks. Specifically with firewood. So much so that I bought a shed to keep it in instead of having it stacked around. Keeps the wood drier I guess.
Twallot,fdj6meq,t1_fdiwosa,"I love this. What a weirdo, especially for a lab since they usually can't control themselves around food. It's hard to get mad at them when they do stuff like that because it's so silly."

lordolxinator,fdifn4a,t1_fdhvolh,"My Bernese was like that. Always cuddled up. And when he was told it was bed time, he'd get up, walk around before getting up on his back legs to put his front paws over your shoulders and lean in for a hug before trotting off to bed. Also did it if you were sad, he'd waltz over and look at you with the puppy dog eyes to see if that helped, then paw at you until you crouched down. Then he'd give you a paws-over-the-shoulder hug until you cheered up, or until he had to start sniffing and slobbering over your ears to try and tickle you."

Altacc1234321,fdhmme8,t1_fdh90ne,"I have a 40kg bull Arab x amstaf who is the best boy, but also a very protective dog. If I'm ever playing with my 2.5 year old son and he yells even in excitement I fear for my safety lol. Such a good boy, would hate to see what he would do to an intruder."
Hastyshooter,fdhs6gt,t1_fdhmme8,"My best friend growing up had 2 very sweet 150 pound mastiff brothers. A burglar broke into their house one day, they found a trail of bloody shoes, pants then a T-shirt leading to the backyard. Police found the traumatized thief in only underpants at the hospital. His wallet in the pants was the slam dunk for the prosecution. 😂"
Altacc1234321,fdhzoxq,t1_fdhs6gt,Geez what good puppies. Hopefully that dude learnt a lesson.
Happinessrules,fdhf5ic,t3_elckp3,That is the biggest dog I have ever seen.  I can't imagine what it's like cleaning up the yard after him.  But he is a very handsome guy.
loveshercoffee,fdhhf02,t1_fdhf5ic,We have an English Mastiff and a Mastiff/Labrador. They're both around 150 lbs. The best thing about the poop is that it's easy to find to pick it all up and you never accidentally step in it.
FishingForAl,fdhg1kw,t1_fdhf5ic,"It's actually not so bad. I have a 130 lb Italian mastiff and we do a couple walks a day, plus trips to the back yard and it's a pretty easy job of dog poop bag pick up."
MisterBuzz,fdhk52k,t1_fdhf5ic,"I dog-sat for a friend who had a bull mastiff, not as big as the one here but still around 120 lbs. The dog almost pulled me down more than once while walking, and one time jumped on another person walking by and I couldn't do anything to pull him off. He was so sweet but also massive, his name was Tank.



And yes, his poops were bigger than mine."
jylcat,fdinbbw,t1_fdhf5ic,"My brother is a big guy too, 6' 4"", when the dog sat on me like this it was more overwhelming. Like a person on you."
catsloveart,fdj6rtq,t1_fdhf5ic,A high protein diet makes the poop smell less and dry out faster. Within a few days it’s dust. Excepting winters of course. Then they are just poopsicles.
annav0ig,fdhgafr,t1_fdhf5ic,Always my first thought when I see these ginormous dogs. How big the poop must be
DrKrowman,fdhbph8,t3_elckp3,She's a bean bag
Waatulakula,fdhezh3,t3_elckp3,I think when god created dogs he mixed up the personalities and put them in the wrong bodies. Big dogs like mastiffs and Danes are big puppies that think they should be snuggled in your lap at all times. While chihuahuas and other little dogs are almost alway little assholes.
Theyallknowme,fdhhg18,t1_fdhezh3,It does seem weird but can you imagine 175lbs of aggressive dog? I believe Mastiffs (dont know about Danes) are bred to be protective but not aggressive. IIRC any Mastiff showing hints of aggression is either put down or most definitely sterilized to make sure those traits are not passed on. What we have now is a huge baby of a dog that will protect without the anger component.
Frondescence,fdi1a1u,t1_fdhezh3,"Despite most people’s experiences, chihuahuas can actually be very affectionate, playful, intelligent dogs, but they definitely do not warm up quickly to strangers. I really think it’s just a survival thing. They’re small, so they act tough and are extremely skeptical of the unfamiliar."
Seerws,fdhyo7o,t1_fdhezh3,When *humans created dogs
FidgetyGidget,fdi2nly,t1_fdhezh3,"Honestly, we had a couple big dogs as a kid and have two chihuahua mixes now. At least one of them must be being held or the yelling starts. Also if there’s a lap and she’s not in it, everyone hears about it. The other wants to be playing 90% of the time, but if she’s sleepy then snuggles must happen or she’ll throw her food bowl around in a little tantrum. They’re cuddle monsters... but vocal cuddle monsters."
clamsplitter69,fdhl2jw,t1_fdhhg18,"Another aspect you gotta think about is the impact of the same actions taken by a dog that weighs 150lbs vs a dog who weighs 15lbs. 

I have 2 English mastiffs and a rottweiler. I'm constantly reminding my big guys not to jump on people when they're outside in the yard. They think the people want to play and dont understand that they are huge. 

On the other hand my friend has a 15lb French bulldog and she's constantly jumping on me and I dont think twice about it. It's just cute to me and not indicative of bad behavior because no harm is coming from it even though it is bad behavior. A person who doesn't love dogs may think differently, but in the end its really doing no harm.

So the small dogs behaviors are forgiven much easier and go by less noticed, where as a big dog (with a responsible owner) is constantly being reminded not to do certain behaviors because everything is exponentially more impactful."
AlisaLolita,fdhjhn6,t1_fdhhg18,"My Great Pyrenees mix is the same way.  Zero aggression unless he thinks I need protecting. Even in those instances, the first few times caught me off guard and he managed to get his mouth on someone, he never broke skin. Just warning chomps."
Waatulakula,fdhmlty,t1_fdhhg18,I believe Danes were bread for hunting and protection. Mine passed away five or so years ago and was big baby. But when someone tried to break into my detached garage one night he would not stop barking until I let him out. Long story short a 150lb dog very quickly changed that mans mind about robbing us.
MarkBeeblebrox,fdhkf6j,t1_fdhhg18,Mastiffs followed armies and ate the bodies of the dead. They were originally guard dogs too.
FidgetyGidget,fdi33h1,t1_fdi1a1u,"Literally every visitor to our house gets the chihuahua alarm, then harassed for snuggles. Like, “There’s an intruder but I’m 7 lbs., large human friend, pay attention! Oh, they’re cool? Well great. New friend, HOLD ME.”"
jetpack_operation,fdhngze,t1_fdhl2jw,Yep and now extrapolate that to historical breeding practices. It's not an accident at all that larger dogs meant to be pets tend to have more aggressiveness bred out of them.

itwasthegoatisay,fdhhm7y,t3_elckp3,Our 140lb Dane is the same way. He'll sneakily start to smush up to you until he's suddenly on top of you and you have no idea how it happened. Most giant dogs are lap dogs that don't realize how big they are.

nachocouch,fdhtjlf,t3_elckp3,"I had a professor who, along with his wife, bred and raised mastiffs. They were both big and tall people, and I will never forget the day his wife visited our class for the first time and announced loud and proud, “Big Woman, Big Dogs!” 
The professor had early stages of Parkinson’s and mobility issues were starting up. So he had two mastiffs that accompanied him to class each day as his service animals, and he leaned on them for support as needed. They also helped him walk between his office and classes. (His wife took a few courses on campus and helped him get back and forth from home.) 
It was my first time seeing one of these incredible beasts in person. They’re massive but very docile and sweet!"

They look mean, they look like they could rip you limb from limb just for looking at them and yet nearly every single one I have met has been a Giant Puppy.

A neighbour a few doors over has a huge English Mastiff. Anyone who walks past gets barked at, but once you get to know him, you realize it isn't a angry or aggressive bark, it is a ""come play with me pleazzzzze!"" Bark."

poocoonuts,fe6j1mb,t1_fe4evze,"Both of our dogs died a couple years ago, and we've taken to just dog sitting and having our close friends bring their dogs to our house when they go out of town because our family just sometimes misses the presence of a pet, and even then we don't say 'walk', we either spell it out or just refer to it as ""a 'W'""

Old habits die hard here"
AnnaMPiranha,fe6fhal,t1_fe4evze,Take the Pupper on a W.
DahliaDubonet,fe6o6tl,t1_fe4evze,We have to ask each other if we’re “going on an adventure” instead of “out” or “walks.” We got away with spelling it for a while but our dogs caught on pretty quickly to that one.

MarcMercury,fe5sqb0,t1_fe4km1q,"We started spelling it out, but we did it too much around her,  and now she gets excited to hear about the doubleyooaayyelkay as well"
mariam67,fe5suqj,t1_fe4km1q,My dog looks up every time I say “I think” because I guess I say that a lot like “I think I’ll do this now” or “I think I’ll go now.” He knows I’m going to do something when I say that. Dogs are amazing at picking things up like that.
javoss88,fe6amls,t1_fe4km1q,My dog has learned O U T even if you spell it. Also P A R K

p_iynx,fe6kmpn,t1_fe5sqb0,"Yeah, our dog is clever enough that he figures out every roundabout way or code that we use to discuss walking him in practically no time at all. We can’t spell it or even just say “W”. At the moment we are on “do the G” (our dog is Greyson) but he’s figured that out too so I don’t know what to switch to now lol. 

He’s also figured out our silent communications. I’ll say “hey -husband- will you/can you/do you wanna“ and then sort of nod toward the door and if our dog sees it he will immediately run to the door and sit down. At this point the glance alone does it. We can’t even use “ya know” now because we would tell each other “hey I’m gonna, ya know” when saying we were gonna take him out. It’s impossible lol."
SmilieSmith,fe7155p,t1_fe5sqb0,"Pretty crazy how my dog knows all the synonyms for walk but doesn't seem to understand ""no"" or ""stop"". And can only seem to understand ""come here"" if there is food or a leash involved 😂."

ChrysanthemumIndica,fe9zwln,t1_fe7155p,"Just living in the moment I reckon :)

When they know how fast you can run and how well you can manage terrain... well, that was fun. Playfully jumping just inches from my range. And huskies can do that for a very long time when it's cold and dark out. Turns out she was wrong about what kind of terrain I'm willing to go through :D"

My husband started telling the dog, ""hey, no one invited you, get down"", I had to tell him, you just did (he's allowed up when we tell him ""okay"").

LittleMissListless,fe6dul7,t3_enq8t2,"This reminds me of my dog and her love for the Caesar's wet dog food cups. She would go **bonkers** over those things. We used to enjoy getting her all excited by asking if she ""wanted a Ceasar?"" She would bark and start to tippy tap. It was adorable!

But then she started getting severe skin problems. The vet told us she was allergic to the wheat in the Ceasars. (Who knew when you fed your dog cheap and poorly made food bad things can happen?! /s) Thus ended the era of the Ceasar in our house. This poor doggo of mine went insane. She refused to eat. She would whine and whinge at us incessantly. She even threw a few epic tantrums that would put the world's angriest toddler to shame. With time and a *lot* of patience she eventually ended her crackhead withdrawal from Ceasars. We had to stop using the word in our house from the on though. (We learned the hard way to never say things such as ""Cesar salad."") 

A few months after she'd come out of her Ceasar addled fog, my SO and I sat down and watched Planet of the Apes. When one of the characters inevitably said ""Cesar"" she lost her freaking mind. She barked and danced and jumped up and down. Every. Single. Time. It was simultaneously hilarious and heart breaking."

raymartini,fdkkplt,t3_elolaq,"Never understood crating, maybe its just cos in the UK people dont usually crate but I imagine my pets would be bored in one room never-mind a crate"
forgotmyabcs,fdkvipi,t1_fdkkplt,"I have an Australian Shepherd rescue. When I got him he had been abused severely. This led to him having a lot of issues, and our vet says she's pretty sure he has some form of ptsd. When I first got him I decided I would have to crate train him for when I left the house because of his extreme separation anxiety. This would never be for more than an hour or two because I lived with my grandmother and taking care of her was a full time job. The first time he was put into a crate, I walked away for five minutes to pee, and he chewed through the steel bars to get out. I stopped attempting to crate train him, and instead left him in the bathroom so any mess would be isolated. 

When I moved back in with my mom, he developed extreme canine aggression as well as arthritis in his hips. Bailey would often go after her other dogs and was living his life isolated from them. We would juggle them and try to keep them separated to eliminate the risk of him snapping. Slowly we added him to the mix. When we weren't home he would destroy anything he could get to. He ate my bedroom floor, a mattress, and several other large cost items. I was at my wits end. Her other dogs are crate trained but rarely need to be in the kennel. It was mostly used to potty train. When she got a new puppy, we began the crate training process, and it's like a switch flipped in Bailey's brain. He started to respond to the phrase ""let's go to our house,"" and going to the kennel, even though it wasn't directed towards him. At this point, he loves it. He won't eat slowly unless his food is in the kennel. If it's out, he eats so fast he throws up. When it gets stressful or his back and hips hurt, he goes in his kennel and pulls the door shut behind him so he gets some time alone. He knows when I'm leaving for work, and he goes to sit in the kennel. I never lock the door, but I do pull a blanket down over the entrance so it's dark and cozy for him, and he's always there when I get back - happy as can be. He knows he can get out, but never does. It's his safe place. He gets food and water in it, has a lovely soft memory foam bed that helps with his back. He has probably ten blankets piled up inside there that he can nestle into. The other dogs are pretty much the same way with their kennels. They enjoy being in them because we have taught them that they are an optional safe place they can go to and be left alone. They each have their own and they stay out of the others except for our smallest chi mix who occasionally will cuddle with Bailey in his kennel if she's lonely. 

I say this because not all kennel training is bad. Every situation is different. If your dog despises being caged then you're doing something wrong. It's the same way with muzzle training. All of our dogs are muzzle trained for their safety. When they go to the groomer or vet and need to be muzzle they're OK with it because we took the time to make it okay for them. When they get boarded while we are away, they don't even bark to be let out, since they know that being in the box means that they have their own space to be. Do I condone locking your animals up for long periods of time while you're away from the house ? Hell fucking no. Do I recommend kennel training for dogs? Yes. It's a tool, and it's a good one. Use it wisely (not as punishment), and it will be a great experience for them. Every situation is different, and it's up to the pet owner to work with their vet and their individual pets to find out what they need."
DamnYouRichardParker,fdlna6h,t1_fdkkplt,I think that if you're going to leave a pet in a crate all day. You shouldn't have a pet. It's just so cruel for the animal.
raymartini,fdl5tp6,t1_fdkvipi,"Thank you for sharing - that’s definitely enlightening for me. I definitely think its a cultural thing to an extent as here in the UK I dont know any dogs who were crated (although they were locked in one room if the owner was out for a short amount of time). Totally get the benefits you mentioned though and can see how its helpful for abused animals. My cats are rescues and when i first got the second i had her in one room away from my other cat (as they were both moody princesses) and gradually introduced them. Luna, the new cat, was badly abused and recovering from giving birth and being neutered. She hid for ages behind a bed and gradually she gained her confidence. Eventually she would scratch at the door to be out so we started letting he roam free and introduced the cats with play. I cant imagine i could keep her in a single room now if i go out as it seems to make her more nervous. 
My auntie has a rescue greyhound and i think they gradually trained him to be sensible around the house when shes out. Hes a pretty well behaved dog though despite his past"
raymartini,fdkpdv6,t1_fdkot9x,"Yeah it doesnt sit right with me. I have cats and i cant imagine confining them to a small area while im at work, i just make sure theres no hazards lying around. Have they destroyed stuff before? Yeah, but its part of having a pet and i’d rather they were free to roam than locked up"
FaolchuThePainted,fdldigt,t1_fdkot9x,I wouldn’t have minded doing this with my old dog that being said wherever I went she went cause she decided her job was to give me 24/7 supervision which honestly I probably needed she was the brains of our duo lol but now i have a dog that if I leave him in the backyard he will be done in less than 5 minutes so he’s not allowed outside without supervision and I’ve litterally tried everything short of an invisible fence and even if I could afford one I don’t want to
eketharr,fdjt3il,t3_elolaq,"I'm just wondering is crating really a popular thing in the US?

I'm curious since it's illegal in Finland and seems unnecessary if training has been done properly."
Dawnimal1969,fdk014e,t1_fdjt3il,"I have ten dogs. Five of my own and five fosters. Some get crated at night and when we are gone for various reasons. Some adore their crates and hang out there when they don’t have to. At night it signals when they want to go to bed. I don’t let them have the run of the house when I’m sleeping anymore than I’d be ok with a toddler exploring at night. Some dogs who are from puppy mills and have literally lived their lives in cages (8+ years...fucking horrible) I would never put in a crate. 

Many of the owner surrender dogs I foster spent upwards of 17 hours in crates every day. It’s sickening. But some dogs love their little dens and when I can’t find them they are usually burrowed under blankets inside them."
super_common_name,fdjtfth,t1_fdjt3il,"Thank you! 

It's *extremely* popular and no one ever talks about the amount of time a dog should be left in a crate, nor how old they should be when you stop crate training. I'm always worried that people leave their dogs in crates all day when they're at work. It's insane.

I wish the word ""crate"" had never been invented. It's a cage. People are putting their dogs in cages. If they called it what it really is, I think people would be more careful about it. It's one thing to put a puppy in a cage at night while everyone is sleeping, but it's another to keep dogs in cages for hours on end.

I hate it. I think it's overused, overhyped, and the dangers aren't sufficiently talked about."
FaygoNbluntz,fdjvut8,t1_fdjt3il,"Most people who crate train their dogs in the US are not leaving their dogs in there all day and night. It’s actually recommended to have a crate for the dog because they need their own space that is specifically for them...like a den. I did it with my dog as a puppy because it is extremely helpful for potty training for they won’t go in their crate because it’s their home. It teaches them to hold it longer when you may be away for an hour or two. I never left my dog in his crate for more than an hour, and he loved that thing. When he would need his own space I’d find him sleeping in there or hanging out in it. These crates are made to fit for certain weights. My dog is an 85lb Doberman/German Shepherd and could fully walk and turn in his crate comfortably. I got rid of the crate at 1 years old and he’s been a gem without it, but I feel it really helped him avoid potty accidents (he was potty trained in 3 days), chewing furniture, and ripping up trash. Yes you can say if you train your dog right you don’t need a crate, but they’re some dogs with major separation anxiety, teething, and other problems that a crate helps when you have to leave the house and don’t want your stuff to get destroyed. It’s not as inhumane as what you think as long as you’re not locking them up all day, and you have the proper sized crate for your dog. My dog was properly trained from day one but most dog trainers recommend crate training now."
sammy_nobrains,fdjxnas,t1_fdjt3il,"He was still a puppy and we would crate him when we weren't home. In hindsight, it's not something I would do again but yes it is something many Americans do when puppy isn't fully trained yet."

Unless you've spent time locked up in a cage you really can't relate to what they must feel."
rugabuga12345,fdli6a6,t1_fdjt3il,It is common for idiots in the US to crates dogs without reason. It is also cmom for idiots around the world to let cats roam unattended.
eketharr,fdk8ihu,t1_fdk014e,"Of course there are some situations that require different means of action. My comment was more about how it's so popular just to leave training all together and just put the dog in a cage so it's easier for the owner (I know not all think that). 

My dog doesn't mind the crate and it's used to it, but I never lock him in there so he can go whenever he pleases. At nights we do close our bedroom door so the dog doesn't roam around listening to all the things that go bump in the night. There is a difference how you use the crate, the crate itself isn't an evil thing. 

As a tool of training I don't mind using the crate. But it absolutely should be seen as a temporary thing and not for extended periods of time. In Finland it's about 4 hours tops to keep a dog in a crate and there are requirements for how big of a space dog should have as a regular living space. I've gotten the idea it's more of a nom especially in the US to keep a dog in a cage for a work day which seems incredibly long time to be restricted even if the cage is ""big enough""."
randomrealityshift,fdjxqi5,t1_fdjtfth,"When I left my ex he bought a Boston Terrier knowing that’s the dog I always wanted. Was hoping I would come back because of the dog. It didn’t work and I was unable to take the dog at the time. He spent the first four years of his life either totally left to his own devices or locked in a crate. 

As soon as I was able I took him. I bought him a crate cause I thought some dogs like them to have as their own space. Just leave the door open and they can rest in there when and if they want. Anyway, he’s never looked at it once. No way he wanted in there. And he’s perfect. Never destructive. No accidents."
JusABigBigBoy,fdjuix7,t1_fdjtfth,"Agreed, Americans think leaving a dog in a crate all day/night is a responsible and humane way to  deal with owning a dog. Not even a large enclosure, but a fucking crate. It should be illegal."
Mewssbites,fdk8qr0,t1_fdjtfth,"Okay, I'm not the only one then?!?

I got a puppy around 2 years ago, first one I'd had in over a decade, and suddenly all the experts are advocating crate training, talking about how it's a dog's natural instinct, etc.. here's the thing though. If it's truly natural, you don't really have to ""train"" for it. It's a rare cat that needs litter box TRAINING... usually it's just a matter of ""hey cat here's the litter box"" and nature takes its course. 

Seems like some dogs really do take to it easily and like spending time in there. My dog? Oh god. It was a nightmare. The nightmare didn't stop until we stopped attempting to crate train him. We tried all the tricks, but he was so anxious just being in the crate that there was no way to make it more pleasant - he's super food motivated but would have nothing to do with any kind of treats in the crate with the door closed.

He's 2 and a half now, and everything is awesome and we love him to bits. He has free reign of the place when we're at work and does absolutely fine - if restricted, he immediately gets separation anxiety and develops behavior issues. It's not a picture-perfect solution, but it works for us."
Stimmolation,fdk4u84,t1_fdjvut8,Exactly.  We still have the crate because our dog will go there when he wants to nap. It hasn't been closed in years.
ArkLife1,fdjx89f,t1_fdjudy3,They like they're personal space in the crate if you use it properly though.
eketharr,fdk7iik,t1_fdk4235,"Well it's not completely illegal, but there is a limit how many hours it's allowed to keep a dog in, IIRC it's about 4 hours max.

It can be used as a _temporary_ tool for training, but from what I understand for many it's a permanent and easy way of restraining the dog from demolishing the house. It seems normal to keep the dog in a cage for work days which to me sounds like a horribly long time for a dog to be alone in a small space. 

So my point is it's clearly viewed differently in different places. Our dog trainers absolutely advocate training beside the ""crating"" and it should not be a permanent solution. In Finland some do restrict dogs to a specific part of the house if needed, but there are definite requirements for how big the space should be for a dog. But I'd say a majority of our pets aren't really restricted or crated when left alone."
eketharr,fdk2ho4,t1_fdk011h,"There is a limit how many hours it's ok to leave a dog in a cage, from what I remember it's around 4 hours. Of course many people use it still and it's difficult to prove if the dog is really spending more time in that cage.

Many people take it as a easy way out and a replacement for training your dog properly. Of course if used right it is a great device to help your dog to adapt to different places and situations but many people are just lazy and keep their dog there."
cmc335,fdk5w21,t1_fdk011h,I like how your phrased it “my brother in law and his wife” as opposed to “my sister and her husband” 😂
MENNONH,fdl92xd,t1_fdk011h,Dogs prefer the small enclosed area of a crate and can be more nervous outside of a crate. It's like a den for them. Making them feel more secure and calm. My dogs will go in their crate randomly just because they want to. We leave it open and will find them in it sleeping sometimes.
jeswesky,fdk9gba,t1_fdk8ihu,"It is a very normal thing.  I think a lot of people start when the dog is a puppy and destructive when left alone, but because they don't know how to properly transition them to being out of the cage all day with out destroying anything they just keep getting locked up.  If an adult dog is destroying things when left alone, there is either a lack or training or a deeper psychological issue that should be addressed."
MelloYelloMarshmello,fdl5oih,t1_fdk8ihu,"Id say for the most part it's not to avoid training and its an important part of the training! I only crate the dogs when I am not present to watch them or if there's any reason I don't want them wandering the house.  It's incredibly hard to train a dog to not do things when you are not there to show them that what they are doing is wrong or re-direct bad behavior to different activities. Honestly, Id says I only crate my adult dogs when I have guests who do not like dogs over or when Im cleaning and just want to be able to clean the floors without them trying to play on the wet floor next to me haha.   


Also, I second that dogs like their crates. My dogs often sleep in their crate without me forcing them to (they have never been forced to sleep on the crate) they just enjoy it. They will walk in there when they feel sleepy to take a nap and cuddle together."
FaolchuThePainted,fdlb6a5,t1_fdk8ihu,I wish it were the same in the us I leave my boys in the bathroom while I’m at work because they aren’t perfectly house trained yet and one has stomach problems that cause him occasional bouts of diarrhea and it’s easier to clean it off of the bathroom floor I still hate having to leave them in there alone for that long tho
jeswesky,fdk96mr,t1_fdjxqi5,"Took my guy from an old roommate.  Before I moved in the roommate left him locked in a crate 23+ hours a day.  I moved in and house trained him instead.  Lost a few shoes and hangers in the process, and even a pair of glasses.  Now, he is perfectly content to hang out on my bed or the couch all day while I'm at work and sleeps either in my bed or on his bed on the floor next to mine.  

He does, however, freak out any time he sees a crate that looks like his old one now.  There are dogs that like the crate as a ""safe space"" of their own, he is not one of them.  I took the door off even to see if he wanted to be in there, and he made it clear he did not.  Got rid of it, and he will never be caged again.  Even had to work with the vet to make sure where he would be when going in to get neutered was large enough that he wouldn't associate it with a crate and get freaked out."
TheWartMan,fdjy7iz,t1_fdjuix7,"I own a dog, dont think its responsible or humane, my dog hates his crate. But when my fiance and I go out for an hour or two, that's the only option. We have worked on training him for months, he still cant be out of the crate in our apartment alone. He has separation anxiety and it drives him to be destructive. In his crate he licks himself out of anxiety. I would rather he lick himself for an hour, than come home to all of our things destroyed and him possibly having eaten something harmful."
Stimmolation,fdk4lur,t1_fdjuix7,Not most Americans.
linwail,fdlm8oa,t1_fdjuix7,"My old dog used to love her crate and we didn’t train her to use it. She liked having a dark spot to hide in if needed.

MelloYelloMarshmello,fdl7b9h,t1_fdk2ho4,"We rescued a 12-year-old lab who had been kept in a crate for 14-20 hours a day her entire life. Her mom worked 2 jobs and only let the dog out to go to the bathroom and eat. She was in there for all of the work and sleep. The poor thing didn't know how to bark, climb stairs, what a toy was, how to walk on grass, how to run, she didn't know how to be a dog. Sadly she also didn't get vet visits and had cancer when we adopted her but I like to think we gave her the best 2 years of her life.   


I don't advocate this use of crating at all. But I do think it can be useful for training purposes and 2 hours max."

loveshercoffee,fdk5z9g,t1_fdjy7iz,"We taught our dog out of separation anxiety by being away from him for increasingly longer and longer periods of time, starting with just five minutes outside where he could see us. We always gave treats when we came back in and nothing was destroyed.

We lost a sofa and the vinyl off the kitchen floor before we realized he had the anxiety! He's 150 lbs so knowing he was going to be so big, we knew he would be able to take out a wall if we didn't get it under control.

Also, if it's a real problem, your vet can give you Xanax for him. Even a small dose can take the edge off if training isn't enough or if he's not able to handle as much time as is needed."
Domer2012,fdke2w1,t1_fdjy7iz,"Same here, we tried letting our rescue just chill at home while we were at work/school, but we really just had to start relegating him to his cage after he ate part of a rug and had to have it surgically removed... *two times*. Sure, *maybe* there were ways of gradually working out his separation anxiety, but keeping him locked up for the workday was the only way to know we were avoiding another life-risking, $3000 surgery. 

He was a perfectly happy dog when we were around, very chill and affectionate, slept on my bed with me every night, went on plenty of walks, had a huge yard to patrol, etc. I think there’s more grey area between the extremes of “abusive owner” and “this dog is equivalent to a human baby!” than a lot of people want to admit, and I think a lot of reddit falls squarely in the latter extreme and are willing to classify anything as animal abuse if it would be considered abusive toward a human."

Yeah crating as a training method is fine as long as it is only temporary and not a solution. When my dog was a pup we fenced off the space so he had kitchen and the foyer to use - minimal things to destroy and the smaller space to ""guard"" calmed him down. After teething and when it seemed that he didn't really even try to gnaw on anything we got rid of the gate and tried to leave him to the rest of the house. He had toys and bones to chew on so he never even thought of trying anything else! 

I hope that more people would wake to the fact that crating the dog for multiple hours a day in a small space is not fine."

FaolchuThePainted,fdlbu3r,t1_fdkde4m,I knew a dog that had been abandoned the poor thing refused to leave the house to go on a walk even with the owners he would plant his feet and whine and pull out of the collar and run right back to the door it’s really made me happy that despite how much of a handful he is and my crappy job training him and how depressed I was I never let my mom get rid of my dog when I still lived with them they tried may times to talk me into giving him away but he’s never really gotten very attached to anyone but me and he already has lots of anxiety issues I think giving him away would’ve really messed him up plus he’s my baby and I will find a way to make it work and get us both to where we are ok somehow
Destiny_Seeker,fdlfz57,t1_fdk7vqi,"My brother's dog is a rescue and has awful separation anxiety. They discovered how bad it was when they left for a few hours to see a movie and came back to ALL of their blinds, couch cushions, bedding, and whatever else the dog could reach off the shelves and counters completely demolished.

They thought they had a break in at first, it was chaos.

So now they use the crate, which the dog seems to actually like. She just chills in there even when they're home now."
woostar64,fdlc2gk,t1_fdk7vqi,"The one dog I bought that wasn’t a puppy was an absolute nightmare. Old dogs can learn new tricks, but it is very hard for them to unlearn things."

TheWartMan,fdkgemu,t1_fdker30,"Yeah hes a great dog, just doesn't want to get left again. I wish he understood us so he knew that we would never abandon him."

sweetdickdavid,fdknf23,t3_elolaq,It’s alarming how many people think crating a dog for a few hours is abuse.
sammy_nobrains,fdll5si,t1_fdknf23,"To my defense (and again, in hindsight I wouldn't do it again) we would crate him when my husband left for work around 1:30pm and my son would let him out when he got home from school around 3, so it was less than 2 hours. If you look in the background of the picture, you can see where he'd been chewing our chairs. The crating stopped as soon as he grew out of the chewing phase (took a few months). But yes, we could have handled that better."
illbreakmyownheart,fdkptm5,t1_fdknf23,It’s alarming how many people think it isn’t. How would you like being locked in a cage for 8-10 hours every day? (8-10 hours is a very common duration for owners who work 40 hours a week + commute) It’s inhumane and I absolutely will look down on someone who owns a dog and does that to them.
sweetdickdavid,fdkr8ex,t1_fdkptm5,"Um, is there no middle ground here? No your dog shouldn’t be crated for 40 hrs a week. But a couple of hours a day while you cook and clean is perfectly fine."
illbreakmyownheart,fdkrg8s,t1_fdkr8ex,"There’s a significant amount of people that cage their dogs at least 40 hours a week.

If you cannot train your dog or make their environment safe enough where they can still have freedom and comfort, you should not own a dog. They are living beings, not toys only to be let out for convenience."
sweetdickdavid,fdksbgw,t1_fdkrg8s,"Ok but a couple of hours a day while you cook and clean and do general family things where there’s a lot going on is fine, right? 

I don’t know about you but I live in a house where I cant put a baby gate to keep my dog or my kids out while I cook dinner. The kids understand words and reasoning better than the dog. They go to their room, the dog goes in the crate, and she’s out by the time the kids go to bed. Are you telling me that this scenario is abuse?"

Recently the medium passed) The small dog also has his own bed elsewhere, and laps. The two big dogs constantly argue over who gets the big bed, even though there is more than enough room for both. If the little dog decides he wants the big bed, he lays right in the middle and the two big dogs sadly lie on the floor without argument.

I'm thinking of getting two big-dog beds, but something tells me they'll just argue over one of them."

So then he went back to his crate which he loves but I feel awful since I work a 9-5 job. I hate being that owner boxing him up because he's nervous and acting out, ya know?"
duddyface,fdi50ho,t1_fdi2d19,"I’ve noticed the same thing with mine.  My ex insisted he couldn’t be trusted alone in the house so I used to confine him to a room and he’d howl and cry, scratch up the door, have accidents, and overall seemed miserable and unable to relax.  After she left I just started letting him do his own thing and he seems a lot happier and I haven’t found any evidence of him damaging things or having accidents either.  He’s usually just chilling on the couch when I come home.

I think when I put him in his room he KNEW I was leaving and he would throw a tantrum and lash out but when I let him roam free he just assumes I‘ll be right back so he’s cool with it even if I’m gone for a while."

gloomseek,fdk83pg,t1_fdk6kep,he's lovely
trefodee,fdk8ndz,t1_fdk83pg,He's a really good boy but he can sense the fear in people  and will make you feel it if you let him. There's very little that can fear me from a dog but other people are so scared of him for no reason. Maybe it's his size. But he's a big baby he used to have a sister named Betty she was the tiniest little mutt but she still bossed him around at every turn.
gloomseek,fdkuvp1,t1_fdk8ndz,"could be the German shepherd in him, they're very good guard dogs. He looks like a sweetie though"
trefodee,fdkv8af,t1_fdkuvp1,Yeah I'd say so. He definitely alerts us of anyone to knock on our door sometimes even before they knock. But somehow will know it's one of us long before we get to the door while he awaits return.
