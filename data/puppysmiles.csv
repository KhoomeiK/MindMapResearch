Lyaid,fdr27qs,t3_emsvx4,"Hi there, can you please tell Buddy that I love him too and give him lots of hugs for me? Thank you!"

vinceman1997,fds06sl,t3_emsvx4,"I don't have a photo right now but I just had to put my dog down. He was blind, going deaf and diabetic. His name was also Buddy, he was the best, I can only imagine what a good boy yours is."
ReallyNotBobby,fdseobq,t1_fds06sl,He’s the best. I’m sorry for your loss though.

ReallyNotBobby,fdrnfrg,t1_fdqzmd4,Ill be sure I do 👍🏻
athanathios,fdrplke,t1_fdrnfrg,Thanks I think this dog is made of borks and pure sunshine :)
Cazadore901,fdseahl,t3_emsvx4,Diabetic blind babies are the best in the world. Can attest.
johnny_qcb,fdr99gm,t3_emsvx4,"Aww. That's the best smile ever! :) What a happy, handsome little fella!"
awake-but-dreamin,fdrxef0,t3_emsvx4,Can you please give him head pats for me?
ReallyNotBobby,fdsepo1,t1_fdrxef0,Absolutely
Glitteratti-,fdrouud,t3_emsvx4,"Awww 
I’d kill for Buddy and I just met him 😍"
mjloveskp2,fdrresh,t3_emsvx4,Aww hi Buddy. I have a diabetic 9 year old. Hope she lives to 12!
eckg,fdt4u90,t1_fdrresh,I would hope your child lives past that point
versacesnifferdog,fdrugze,t3_emsvx4,"Buddy is super cute!! 

If you don’t mind me asking, is it cataracts (related to his diabetes) that caused his blindness & how long has he had diabetes for? 

One of my little guys (12 y/o) is diabetic too, has cataracts in both eyes (so will go slowly blind), (and has a thyroid condition) and haven’t met anyone with the dog who has the same medical issues so I’m interested to know how Buddy is getting on! If you don’t feel comfortable discussing it then that’s fine of course!"
ReallyNotBobby,fdses4y,t1_fdrugze,That’s exactly why he has cataracts. The insulin causes the blindness. That’s what the vet said anyway. He’s been diabetic for about 2-3 years I think?
emptycollins,fdttkcc,t1_fdses4y,"Wouldn’t they be called dogaracts?

Wordplay aside, he’s a cute pooch."
versacesnifferdog,fdup0sf,t1_fdses4y,"Ah okay thanks! Buddy looks super healthy and happy though, this gives me hope for my little geriatric doggo. Thanks a lot!"
ReallyNotBobby,fdx4x5a,t1_fdup0sf,"Yeah, once you get their insulin dose set with some help from the vet, you’ll see a noticeable difference."
itsyaboydros,fdrzshu,t3_emsvx4,I wish Buddy many more years of happiness and smiles.
Srw2725,fds2cwo,t3_emsvx4,Omg I have a blind Shitzu too!! ❤️
Slayziken,fds2tm1,t3_emsvx4,"With a face like that, I’m sure everyone he meets loves him too"

shinydime,fds8cqi,t3_emsvx4,i love you Buddy!! may you live a long life with a lot of pats!!
ReallyNotBobby,fdsek78,t1_fds8cqi,So many pats
Fireisforever,fdscpch,t3_emsvx4,Buddy has got one rockin' old boi mustache to go with the smile. 10/10
lexicann,fdtgdiz,t3_emsvx4,"Aw! Just curious, what kind of dog is Buddy? He’s a cutie. I have a dog that looks very similar."
ReallyNotBobby,fdu5r54,t1_fdtgdiz,He’s a shih tzu
jetstream93,fdv4zb0,t3_emsvx4,Give him all the belly rubs and head scratches and e everything cause he deserves it
davenos362,fdw0l9p,t3_emsvx4,Not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for Buddy

ReallyNotBobby,fdu5udw,t1_fdtf9m6,He got it from the groomer we take him too. Awesome lady and really good with all her 4 legged customers.
rosegold-,fdw592k,t1_fdu5udw,Cute! My dog also got it from the groomer. Must be a groomer thing!
ReallyNotBobby,fdx3jws,t1_fdw592k,I think so

StacieinAtlanta,fdv2mn1,t3_emsvx4,Awwww what a good boi!
hairspraybook,fdvn2of,t3_emsvx4,You can tell Buddy is a sweetheart. ❤️
Blindmarco,fdvrf23,t3_emsvx4,"How does a dog get diabetes? I have never seen this, is it something that some breeds are predisposed to?"
marianita84,fdvrrng,t3_emsvx4,"Awww, what an adorable shih tzu & one that is smiling despite what he’s going thru. Continue to love on him through. ☺️"
ReallyNotBobby,fdx3x8b,t1_fdvrrng,Absolutely
brendan_559,fdw4ub4,t3_emsvx4,I think he's only diabetic because he's just so sweet!

Puggednose,fdneipm,t1_fdlwqe3,Why is she standing on the floor and not snuggling in the human bed then?

lourdesc6,fdzwvz7,t1_fdz2avt,Yes :)! Sometimes she shakes and it all stands up- hilarious. We adopted her chihuahua mum pregnant and we think her dad was a yorkie so that’s why her coat is so scruffy.

FatMacchio,fe6ltq9,t1_fe5r7e1,"That’s awesome. You can see the tentative excitement bubbling below the surface. Just give him time to open up and his true awesome personality should fully reveal itself.  

It took my rescue like a week or so to start to get comfortable, and then like a couple months to fully be at home and realize he’s not going back to shelter...he’s still got a bit of separation anxiety (he was left tied up on the beach by his previous humans...and spent months in the shelter, got kennel cough...).   He’s much better now though, but we end up giving him some cbd to calm him down when we have to leave him home by himself for more than a couple hours."

athanathios,fdjwb6p,t3_eloxwq,"She's so adorable and knows it. She'll use it too, watch out for this one and give her all the love!"
LarrySGx,fdjyar8,t3_eloxwq,Thought she was winking for a second there

yourmomismysidepiece,fe94doj,t3_eo6bsc,Adopt her!
whynotpaint,fe9j8yd,t1_fe94doj,"I want to, and still might. I have cats who aren't super fond of dogs. And they're super old. So I'm weighing how much it'll stress them out. I don't want to hurt my current babies."
yourmomismysidepiece,fe9k17x,t1_fe9j8yd,"I completely understand, I went through a year of weighing pros and cons of getting dogs vs keeping my guinea pigs stress-free. At the end of the day, it turns out neither of my dogs care about the guinea pigs and my guinea pigs couldn't care less about the dogs! 

Ask the rescue if you could do a meet and greet day with the dog and cats, maybe? Or ask them how she is with cats in general! If she doesn't bother them, I'd suggest getting them cat climbers mounted on the wall so they can have lots of high space and also giving them their own personal dog-free space."
whynotpaint,fe9lem5,t1_fe9k17x,"I'm actually the person who took the photo. I volunteer with this shelter, and have asked all those questions. I lost my dog in November. Our cats are allowed the upper level, dog free. So that would continue. But my older kitty had a near death scare the week before we lost our dog. So I'm not 100% sure I'm over that. I think it's a big part that's making me question if it's right.

But this dog is so flipping sweet. Like she fell asleep on me on our way back to the shelter. We're going by today for my kids to meet her. I think if these photos (there's also ones of Lulu in a tutu) don't bring her an adopter. I'm not going to be able to resist her."
yourmomismysidepiece,fea1qqa,t1_fe9lem5,"That's such a sweet story about her. I'm so sorry you lost your dog and am having issues with your eldest kitty cat. I only urge people to adopt fast because I once had thoughts of adopting a great dane whom I fell in love with. He had been surrendered by his owner and had severe anxiety when anyone left his room. The kind ladies at the rescue tried everything, they would even read him bed time stories. Unfortunately, soon after he died alone of heart failure due to one of his anxiety attacks. It hurt me so bad when I learned of all this."
lamireille,feamk0n,t1_fe9lem5,"You're an excellent photographer! I love this picture! She is SO cute... that little head tilt and the bright eyes are irresistible!

You're doing such an important job. Appealing photographs are so, well, appealing; I'm sure there are tons of darling animals who found homes quickly because of you. 

P.S. I hope you adopt Lola."
whynotpaint,feb3kt5,t1_fea1qqa,"That's really heartbreaking! But have no fear about Lulu. I just checked on her, and she has multiple applications in! It's also bringing interest to one of the other senior pups there. And it's making me crazy happy!"
whynotpaint,feb2j09,t1_feamk0n,"Aww, thank you! I usually do the kitty pictures, and just started doing some of the dogs. This sweet photo has brought in multiple people. And it looks like multiple dogs will be getting homes. And it's just been making me cry happy tears all day long."
lamireille,febhwya,t1_feb2j09,"You're a wonderful person, to be happy instead of sad that Lola has many applicants. And it's no wonder she does! She's a darling.

What a huge difference you're making in these animals' lives. You've earned those happy tears!"
whynotpaint,febid92,t1_febhwya,I'm a little sad too. But it means I have a better chance of springing a cat who's been there the longest. One who NOONE has been interested in. So it's not a bad ending at all.
LoveImperfectly,fea9mru,t3_eo6bsc,where is this shelter?! I would love love love to adopt her!!
whynotpaint,feb38q5,t1_fea9mru,"It's in WI, but she's *already adopted!* The shelter posted these **today** and it brought in multiple adopters, and I've been crying happy tears all day."

LoveImperfectly,febb325,t1_feb38q5,That's amazing news! I would have jumped to get her too. I hope her forever home is as sweet as she is
iwishiwasaunicorn,feced6f,t1_feb38q5,"photos like this make SUCH a gigantic difference for shelter dogs, especially the ones less likely to be adopted due to breed or age... just makes you see their personality and what a great potential addition to the family they’d be instead of just a sad dog in a cage. thank you for doing what you do."
LoveImperfectly,febauhi,t1_feaghlp,"Man, I'm in Louisville, KY area but I am really wanting to adopt a senior furchild! She's perfect- I really hope she finds a good forever home"
lexiekon,fecqmhx,t1_febauhi,"Adopting a senior is magical and you won't regret it. I've fostered dogs and one was a senior and their gratitude is mind-blowing. It's in their eyes. They remind you that every day is so precious so we should leave as much of the awful past where it belongs and enjoy each day for all it offers.

I hope so much that you'll rescue a senior sweetheart. When you do - make sure to share her here so we can all live (and love) vicariously!"

milosmom727,fecq0ba,t3_eo6bsc,"She looks so sweet. And she's a beauty, it's a shame she once had a horrible owner that mutilated her but she's still beautiful. You should adopt her, just look at that sweet smile"

iwillitakyou,fdqmimb,t1_fdq1v1r,He's an Australian Shepherd.
Ahhshit96,fdqkip0,t1_fdq1v1r,Definitely looks like he has some duck tolling retriever in him and maaaaaybe border collie or aussie Shepherd
meatwagonx333,fdqptdg,t1_fdqmimb,Beautiful breed!
Cow_Launcher,fdr1egt,t1_fdqmimb,"I was going to say that he looks like a Red Collie - my friend has two of them - so I googled it and... apparently a Aus Shephard is in fact a Collie breed. TIL

What a *stunning* animal! I know that he is just the bestest of friends."
iwillitakyou,fdrf06n,t1_fdr1egt,He gets confused for a collie all the time. And he is the best friend I could ever ask for 😊
Cow_Launcher,fds0776,t1_fdrf06n,That's really great - I'm very glad to hear that he's a good friend to you.

Pears416,fdwmflt,t1_fdwa8s4,"He was rescued from a hoarding case with lots of other huskies, so at first they thought husky, but I thought Native American Indian dog (though there are people that don’t think this breed exists or something) so we just say husky mix!"
arianalove3344,fdtw8di,t3_en3lyj,Very cute floof

Pears416,fdz1t4n,t1_fdyw33u,"I assume he was named after the Game of Thrones dire wolf, but I didn’t name him. He came with that name when we got him and we all liked it so we decided not to change it"

ZombVee,fe646m8,t1_fe62y4z,"Thank you for your kind words🖤
She was my world. If you have a sweet pup at home, hug them for me please"
ThrowAwayDay24601,fe6wqhg,t1_fe646m8,"We don’t deserve them. I’m having a hard time. Our boy was a part of my life through most of my adult life. He had some very special needs, and I learned so much about him and how unfair it was to breed him. I was angry at how cruel it was to breed. I guess they sold the right colors to people that wanted them. Not thinking about the babies that had the issues from irresponsible breeding. 

Luckily he had the best possible, happy life. We did our best to deal with congenital issues. He always had the best of everything, and so much love. He was such a priority. I miss him so much. We took him to my lake house in August. We did it because he loved it there. He got to be off leash on the beach.

He passed on 10/12/19. I miss him. His organs were awesome. He didn’t have any issues. We had him tested and his liver and heart and kidneys and everything was perfect. His brain just misfired and likely had a stroke. I tried so hard so hard to maximize his lifespan, and I did.  He was lucky to live to eight but I don’t care I miss him. 

I’m still very sad and crying because I loved him so much and no one can replace"
ZombVee,fe84kn0,t1_fe6wqhg,"That broke my heart reading that. I'm glad your dog came into your life and you were able to give him the best life possible. What kind of dog was he? What was his name? In r/shihtzu I always off the option to message me if people need/want to talk about the pup they recently lost... And that offer goes to you as well. Don't hesitate to message me if you need yo talk or anything. She lost her left eye at the start of 2017 due to a melting ulcer. I had maxed out a credit card trying to save her eye, but in hindsight I should have just had My vet remove it to spare her the stress. In August 2016 she started having seizures. That was terrifying. The first bad one she had... I can't forget that noise... And after numerous visits to My vet and new seizure medication, she seemed to have gotten better. But sadly... No. My Bug-A-Boo was so much more to me than just a dog. She was my anchor when I would drift off into a sea of despair. My band-aide when my heart was hurting -This here has been the hardest thing to deal with because towards the end of last year I had my heart broken again and I still am unsure of how to cope with it. My protector when my ex would abuse me. She would lay on my hands when I would cut. On one of my last suicide attempts, she refused to leave my side. A huge part of me died with her the day she crossed the rainbow bridge. I miss her so very much and I wish I could just cuddle her again. I have forgotten what her fur feels like. How her paws would smell (that's weird... I know) How she would pester me for a treat. It feels like I have forgotten how her little tongue would leave small sweet doggie kisses on my cheeks. Not a day goes by that I don't think about her."
