I could see she'd get uncomfortable fairly quickly, but she never once snapped at him or put him in his place and it was on me to advocate for my older dog and separate them to give her space."

After being off soda for \~2 months, I had a craving for diet coke, so I had one. It *burned.* It hurt my throat and didn't even taste good."

AskReddit,fem19ie,t3_epr0g5,1579236499.0,"Yep. My anxiety already drives me up the wall wondering what people think of me, if they hate me, if they think I said or did something weird. Knowing what they've said would at least calm the ""what ifs"" rattling around in my brain."

dogs,fecl1sv,t3_eodqb5,1578976533.0,"When my dog passed suddenly 2 years ago at the age of 7, I was wrecked. I thought my brother was joking when he called me to tell me he thought she was dead. She was partially deaf and slept like a log, so when he called, I laughed it off. ""Ha ha, she's dead to the world. Very funny."" But he said he wasn't kidding.

When I got to my parents house where she'd been staying for a few days to get some R&R away from my new puppy, I went to pieces at the sight of her laying on the couch as if she was just asleep. I dropped to my knees and held her, I sobbed, I begged my dad to take her to the vet so they could do something, *anything* to help her. I knew she was gone but my brain wasn't processing that. I wish had had the presence of mind to ask the vet to do an autopsy, I wish I knew what happened.

I had never felt loss like that, my whole being shattered. It hurts less now, but I still tear up when I think about her. I'm so sorry for your loss. No matter how long we have them in our lives, it's never long enough."

I was trying to open a bag to pick up his poop when he pulled with all his strength really suddenly and jerked the leash right out of my hands. He had spotted another dog being walked down the street and ran off to play. The dog was relatively new to the neighborhood, so I wasn't sure if it was friendly or not, needless to say I was panicking. By the time I got to my dog, they were both spanking the ground attempting to play. The other owner and I had an anxious laugh over our mutual pants crapping."

It's just how some dogs eat."

AskReddit,fcma01u,t3_ehop56,1577768294.0,"I guess mine are pretty tame compared to some of these comments.

  
Friend misplaced the cap of his parent's bottle of vodka. We searched high and low, drunk and crying, not finding that fucking cap and consoling each other over the ass whooping we were sure to get when his parents found out we were drinking underage. We ended up finding the cap about a half hour later, sitting on the vent hood of the oven.  


Another time (after we were all legal age), my friend group had a drinking night on Discord, we all got wasted, played some video games, had a generally good time. After we all signed off for the night, one friend called me on the phone crying her eyes out because she was laying in bed and had to pee, all she kept saying was ""forgetfulkaiju, I have to pee and I can't get up"", and ""what if my legs don't work?"" and then dissolving into tears again."

cockerspaniel,fcam04n,t3_egw16b,1577571895.0,"Biggest thing with cockers, no matter how you prefer to keep their coat, always, always, always have the inside of their ear shaved down. It allows for good airflow and because cockers have narrow ear canals, they're prone to infections. Be sure to clean his ears often, make it as fun of an experience as you can with lots of treats and lovings. 

Biggest thing I've learned from puppies in general - get on the floor and look around. Anything you can see and reach from the floor, they can and will get a hold of. Pick up, tuck away, and puppy proof everything you don't want messed with.
