""Response to fire  

The response of Wollemi Pine to fire is unknown. It is likely that intense fires that kill all foliage will kill individuals of Wollemi Pine and, hence, catastrophic fire is a threat to the known stands. However, all stands show evidence of previous fires as indicated by fire scars on the trees or burnt out remains of Sydney Peppermint. Small scale spot fires may occasionally occur at or in the vicinity of known stands. The role of such small scale fires on the competitive interaction between Wollemi Pines and angiosperms and in creating gaps for recruitment of new plants is currently under investigation (Auld & Hughes unpubl. cited in NSW DEC 2007). An appropriate disturbance regime may be required to ensure the long-term viability of stands in the wild. Further monitoring is required to provide information on the role of fire in the survival of the Wollemi Pine."""
