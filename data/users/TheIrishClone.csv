Benjamin Franklin, one of the more educated among the founders, was mostly self-taught and received a grand total of 2 years of organized structured education.

PoliticalHumor,fdw96c6,t1_fdu0ovw,1578756366.0,"As to the main point, I at no junction say that the founding fathers were idiots, simply that they lived in a time where our knowledge hadnâ€™t expanded nearly as much as it has now.   Cicero is one of my favorite historical figures, followed closely by Ben Franklin.   However, both would have believed that tooth decay was caused by magic tooth worms, so I wouldnâ€™t take their advice on dental hygiene. 

I respect the achievements of those who came before.   We stand on the shoulders of giants, but they were people, just like us.   They were deeply flawed individuals with a limited understanding of the world as a result of the progress of their time.  In the same token, I hope future generations have the insight to look at us with a critical eye and an understanding of the limitations of our time.

Side note: 

I knew English, Hebrew, Latin, and a good bit of Greek in middle school.  (Originally learned for religious reasons, but itâ€™s helped me a lot in medicine and academia.)

Language is easier than most Americans seem to think.

Itâ€™s asinine to treat the founding fathers will as infallible as a result of this chronological gap, and they even spoke at length in their writings about not doing exactly that.

Edit:

To those saying that the founding fathers included smart people, I am NOT refuting that.   Iâ€™m simply pointing out that in middle school, children make and learn about the properties of electromagnets and electric lights.   The founding fathers were intelligent, by and large, but very limited by the knowledge of their time.

As far as calling them old, rich, and largely racist.   I stand by that one for the vast majority of the founders.

Franklin is one of my favorite historical figures, but he was a deeply flawed man, just like so many of us today.   We canâ€™t forget that they had limited knowledge and that all of us are blind to the future.  They deserve immense praise for their achievements and immense critique for their failings, as all of us someday will.

To send home the point Iâ€™m making, Iâ€™ll offer this quote:
