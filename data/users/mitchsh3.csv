Strangely, my therapist said she didn’t feel comfortable writing a letter because she’s “not a doctor” but from my understanding, a LMHP would qualify? My psychiatrist says she will “think about it”. Not sure why both providers are hesitant to write a letter for an ESA, I have no history of violence or neglect , and have cared for animals my whole life. Wondering why they are so iffy about it?"
