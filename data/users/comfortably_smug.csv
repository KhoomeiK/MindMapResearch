depression,fgu6ln8,t3_f0dmpy,1581114109.0,"A solid routine really helped me out a lot. I wish there were things that were more instantaneous as far as treatment goes but unfortunately those things just don’t exist. Ketamine is the new big thing and it does seem to give rapid relief but it’s expensive. Just have to force yourself to do the things that you know you need to do and stuff can get better relatively quick, like two weeks. Clinical depression doesn’t really go away but for me it did become easier in my 30’s. My mind stop racing for the most part and I became more able to focus on the things I’m doing. The procrastination stopped being such a problem. Staying busy just pretty much became therapeutic. It’s a tough road but you can do it and it does get better even though it really seems like it doesn’t. When I get in a funk, I’ll do anything I can to distract myself. Cleaning, laundry, whatever bc even though it’s hard to get motivated, any positive thing you can do is so much better than just staying stuck in bed or on the couch with those feelings. Seems simple but it took a long time for me to realize this. It’s not a cure but it can diminish depression anywhere from 50% to 90%"
