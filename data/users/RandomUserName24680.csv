SelfAwarewolves,fgpxgy8,t1_fgpkdh9,1581013877.0,One of my favorite quotes.
SelfAwarewolves,fgpvk4y,t1_fgpet4a,1581012841.0,Let’s not forget that the SCOTUS upheld a Florida court’s decision to halt the recount of Florida’s ballots as directed by Jeb Bush.

tampa,fgpj5pk,t1_fgoukwx,1581005845.0,I never once said st Pete didn’t have plenty of shithole areas.  Nice homes next door to shithole homes basically describes all of Florida.
tampa,fgoo66s,t1_fgm9m8f,1580978237.0,Have you looked at Tampa?  It’s not actually wall to wall beauty.
doctorwho,fgmn44l,t1_fglpqpb,1580927972.0,"I don’t have any issues with JW, I think the writing has failed her.  She’s believable as The Doctor, although I have yet to see her have the “ah ha, that’s the Doctor” moment.  

Honestly I’ve liked all the doctors.  Some of the companions have been hit or miss, but that’s ok.  What is a miss for me is a hit for someone else, so it’s all good.  

Text forms of discussion can seem much harsher than face to face discussions.  You can’t see facial expressions, or hand gestures or other body language.  How one person “receives” a criticism may be 180 degrees off from the thought the “sender” thought they made.  That’s life in a subreddit.

There are a lot worse subs out there, 99% of the people here are great and do a decent job of getting their point across."
therewasanattempt,fgma99z,t1_fgkjrev,1580920821.0,"This is great in concept, but fails on the practical level.  Using major airlines to get to remote areas (like huge hunks of Iowa) can literally take all day with multiple plane changes.  That may then be followed by 2-3 hours of drive time.  It would literally be impossible to get all over a state for multiple events in one day.

I can come up with dozens of reasons to not like Warren, but the fact she uses a small jet to get around campaign events isn’t one of them.  She’s not being hypocritical, there literally isn’t any other way to get this done."
therewasanattempt,fgm9ol3,t1_fgkx1po,1580920506.0,"Seriously?  How do you expect any Senator running for President to get between Washington DC, their own state, and campaign events?  Like it or not, this is the most effective way to get around while campaigning.  

I am certain if Star Trek like transporters existed, she would use them instead, but right now the fastest way to get between DC, Massachusetts and Iowa is a small private jet."
tampa,fgl9qw9,t1_fgkkjiq,1580887267.0,"That’s because you don’t have awesome restaurants and bars and shops all in one great location (downtown).  Tampa does have a lot of nice things, but good lord, how many days a year can you go to Busch Gardens?  Seriously?  Listing a theme park as a plus for the city?  

One other thing St Pete has is decent roads."
tampa,fgkjq7k,t1_fgkgwi4,1580867159.0,Downtown St Pete has a lot more going on than downtown Tampa.
MurderedByWords,fgjhix4,t1_fgja2fe,1580844167.0,"If diagnosed early there are treatment plans with decent outcomes.  

In Rush’s case he has end stage lung cancer.  It’s called end stage for a reason, there are few treatment plans, and the five year survival rate is basically 0%."
politics,fgdr768,t1_fgddbqw,1580685779.0,"Would you feel better if he took money from corporations too?  I am certain he could get enough singular donations to meet the arbitrary numbers, but it defeats the purpose of “I won’t take money from anyone”.  

If all of a sudden he decided to take money from a grassroots effort, I am certain others would also complain about that.

He has the money needed to win, and he is polling well.  He should be on the debate stage.  At this point now that we are in the primaries, I would think the DNC cares more about polling (who has support), and the much needed war chest to defeat Trump.

Bloomberg has already said he will put his money behind whomever the Democratic candidate is.  I am pretty sure the DNC and the candidate will take that money."
nottheonion,fgcgh87,t3_exrn9c,1580672484.0,"“He also proposed a bill during the 2019 session that would have had the state of Montana buy the Colstrip power plant.”

So the man who thinks socialists should be shot, sponsored a bill for the state to buy a utility power plant.

We do live in bizarro world these days."
worldnews,fg89s5z,t1_fg7tk4m,1580613369.0,"Oh, sorry.  I thought it was about large corporations bypassing the the limits on donations to candidates by funneling large amounts of money into political action committees, who can then bypass those limits by running the ads themselves without any spending limits, in order to buy the favor of the candidate.

What does it actually mean?"
politics,fg7z7dz,t1_fg6m43k,1580605279.0,"Every day?  The man has scandals in between his scandals, and in between those he tweets.

Say what you want about the man, and I do despise him, the man knows how to control the overall narrative.  He tweets so much idiotic stuff, and it’s completely on purpose to distract people.  And overall it actually works."
worldnews,fg7hz6q,t1_fg7djwm,1580592971.0,"Would you rather he accept PAC money?  I”m ambivalent on Bloomberg, but the fact he is taking money from no one at all is a good thing in my opinion.  Everyone (especially Dems) talks about how we need to get money out of politics, and here is Bloomberg not taking a penny from anyone.  The idea of deciding who gets into a debate based on how much money they raised is just stupid.  Base it on polling, not money."
worldnews,fg7hdk7,t1_fg7d45i,1580592557.0,"Actually it is true.  Your taxes are lower when your income is lower, and you never have to “make up” those lower taxes down the road.

When you end up paying a lower monthly payment on a student loan, your principle balance goes down more slowly and you end up paying for many more years.  Your total “in full” repayment amount grows due to increased interest amounts over the life of a longer term loan."

It’s 2020 people, learn what a search engine is already.

Edit: I’m not the one who made the statement about the patent.  I”m the guy who looked in another browser tab.  Yes, I agree popping a source is nice, but come on, it takes almost as long to type “hey mate, but I can please see your source” than it does to open another tab and type “Ivanka trump voting machine patent” in the address bar.  It’s not like this is some obscure hard to find item.  It was all over the news."

politics,ffz3iad,t1_ffyzp2c,1580362745.0,"I hate to admit this, but there is a small part of me that is hoping Trump wins another term.  The economy is just batshit crazy right now, and an implosion isn’t that far off.  I’d like this to get pinned on Trump and the GOP rather than Democrats.  Trump got us to this point along with Moscow Mitch and the gang.  They deserve to get the blame too."
politics,ffz3661,t1_ffz29vl,1580362441.0,"Yup.  Crazy that the Republicans are using all the tricks that are supposed to be used for when the economy is doing terrible, and at the same time say how great the economy is doing.

When the economy hits a recession, the tricks are already used up.  The Fed was finally raising interest rates to what were still historic lows.  Trump put an end to that, and the fed rate is back to panic mode levels.  When the next recession hits, the only step left will be to pay people to borrow money ( negative interest).

Seven of the ten casinos which were in Atlantic City when Trump owned casinos there are still operating.  All three of Trump’s closed.  And the GOP is listening to this man."

The_Mueller,ffy9udq,t1_ffy9euf,1580341404.0,"Yup, we are on the same side of the coin.  Clinton did deserve to be impeached.  Of course, by the same logic we could probably impeach a lot more presidents over time.  Trump actually makes what Nixon did look minor."
The_Mueller,ffy8j6i,t1_ffy69xu,1580340646.0,"Not saying it was.  Also, the Clinton White House did turn over the requested documents in the end.  Current occupant hasn’t.  Another more nefarious difference.

One is still about a blow job, lying about it, and trying to hide it.  The other is about trying to get foreign countries help the president by going after his political opponents.  Not even remotely similar in their severity to the fabric of our country."
