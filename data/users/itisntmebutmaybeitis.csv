You didn't say that, and if there are burglaries and gunshots then I would argue it's not a working class neighbourhood - it's probably a lower-income area with people very much struggling to get by because that is a huge factor for crimes like that."
AskReddit,fgh78n4,t1_fggy693,1580778333.0,"Why do you need to get out of your working class neighbourhood? You are going to be contibuting to the problem. I can't even afford to move right now even though I'd probably love to becauee I'm trapped in a situation that is pretty fucking unbearable, so forgive me if I don't have any sympathy."
AskReddit,fggbp8s,t1_fgg0itv,1580758477.0,"Neighbourhood I grew up in was solidly working class. Not so much anymore. I worked at a school in the area and had a parent ask me what the attendance policy was like for out of district kids because they were moving into a house to flip out so they could move into a nicer area.

It took so much restraint not to tell her to fuck off."
AskReddit,fggb789,t1_fgfcc49,1580758174.0,"Nah. Instead of being the tiniest planet in our solar system it's the king of Kuiper Belt!

It really does have a bunch of differences to the the planets in our system, and it's amazing just the way it is :D"

I rescued a kitten twice near the end of the summer, and now she has a good and safe home with my friend. We have sleepovers sometimes (because we're adults! We can do what we want!), so I get to see her regularly - and I'm cat sitting right now cuz she is off on a work thing for a week.

aww,ffefgea,t1_ffe4pd3,1579845981.0,"Thank you!! And, I was actually not far off? I may have not tried very hard to look it up though. I was trying perioception or something similar."
aww,ffe219a,t1_ffdkg7e,1579834649.0,The sense (that I can't remember what it's called or even get close enough for google to tell me) that tells you where your body is located in space and what it's doing isn't fully developed when we're born. So one of the reasons kids like getting spun about and thrown around is because doing those things helps you develop it -- once it's developed is why those things can start to make us feel sick.
actuallesbians,ff76dl3,t1_ff6wn96,1579642011.0,"Yep, and higher risk of cataracts later on. But also: muscle loss (which also means your heart gets weaker - which could affect oxygen getting to your brain), bone density loss, a possible higher risk of alzheimers among others. It'll be interesting to see what comes out of the twin study they did with Scott Kelly on the effects of being in space for a longer term."
actuallesbians,ff75dsk,t1_ff6ulww,1579641455.0,"Yep, their lives are /highly/ regimented. Plus they have to work out a minimum of two hours a day to combat as much muscle and bone density loss as possible."

SuddenlyGay,ff3prdz,t1_ff33o60,1579546217.0,"This is the correct place to bring it up - when it's not wanted is when it's brought up in response to a women's issue being discussed. 

This is not that. This is a news story about a man who was raped, and it a) not being reported as such and b) it being trivialized because the victim was a man.

It's bullshit and not okay. This is exactly the time we talk about ho media and society does this to men and the damage it can and does cause."
TrollXChromosomes,fepa3bm,t1_fema1n7,1579315539.0,My Mum pretty much cooked some of her back at one point after she slipped a disk. Like. Just. Nope.
BlackPeopleTwitter,femz0qg,t1_femsagl,1579273219.0,"Yeah, that whole exoloitation of wotkers for unliveable wages and increasingly unsafe working conditions while convincing them it's their fault they're struggling.

Yep. That has nothing to do with it. Nothing at all."
AskReddit,fekddgh,t1_fejuflh,1579197691.0,"No. We don't.

Some women hate other women, but it is very much not a standard thing."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feh5t5h,t1_feh3gk9,1579109747.0,"So, in Canada they do have a classroom budget (source: used to be an elementary school secretary). What I'm imagining is happening in the states is they might have one, but it is nowhere near enough to conver everything they need.

It makes me sad. You know what the elementary kids at the schools I worked at had to bring to school? Themselves, a backpack, and gym shoes. They could bring a lunch if they wanted, or pay for the school hour lunch which was donation based and not tracked of who payed what, and if they couldn't pay them they didn't and they got a lunch anyway because kids need fucking food to be able to function. 

Like, goddamit. It's not that difficult to provide the bare minimum (though to be fair, my premiere is currently trying to fuck over our education system like woa, so, yay)."
LateStageCapitalism,feer2uk,t1_fea60fo,1579039404.0,"I technically do, but it was because of a class action settlement and it is slowly being drained. Woo.

Once, there was a whole month where I felt financially secure and stable and like I might get to start saving. It was two years ago, it won't be around again anytime soon. I'm just hoping for not needing to keep taking money out of it sooner rather than later."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fdxwm2n,t1_fdxjrb1,1578773666.0,/r/actuallesbians is very supportive of our trans sisters <3 (source: cis queer lady here who follows both subs). If there is someone who starts being transphobic they get shut down.
AskReddit,fdkftcw,t1_fdjsrwj,1578502961.0,"Not a pharmacist, but once I legit had to go get a prescription refilled early because I bought this cute little pill case for my lorazepam and the design of it crushed all of my pills into a fine dust.

Had to go to call my clinic and have not my doctor refill it, he obly gave me 5 because he did /not/ believe me - which I know because I went to see my actual doctor that week and she burst out laughing at me because she told me he came to her all concerned and she was like ""No, I know her well, that is definitely something that would happen to her - plus, I have a hard enough time evem convincing her to /take/ medication, so it's legit"".

I was just trying to be organized!"
CPTSD,fde66dp,t1_fdcadh4,1578332046.0,"One od the reasons I didn't understand one of the things that happened to me for years (and thus intensified my guilt and shame about it) was because it was also done by a woman. But because I was a girl then I couldn't... It was real fun when I was figuring out that I am queer, because I would think back to when I too was 7 and then jist be flooded with shame and confusion. 

Anyway. Yeah. Love your way."
