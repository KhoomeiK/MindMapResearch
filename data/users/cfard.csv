PublicMobile,fen4al5,t3_eq220m,1579276653.0,"All plans with PM are 30-day plans, meaning you would be charged $15 at the beginning of every 30-day cycle. The *prepaid* part just means you pay on Day 1 and in return you are given the services listed in the plan. If you use up the 100 minutes or 250 MB included you can't be charged overages because they simply cut you off instead.

So functionally the plan would ""feel"" like you're paying $15 at the end of the cycle but in fact each payment extends your plan by a cycle.

The only ""extra"" fee you'd be paying is the cost of the SIM card."
