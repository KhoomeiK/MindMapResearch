india,ffepint,t3_et62n4,1579858969.0,I know it seems incredibly insensitive but I remember my law friends literally telling me differences between such terms - they are defined by law hence their usage.
wholesomememes,ffd77i0,t1_ffd3gna,1579814763.0,Motherfucker gave me free level ups and died and now I look like I got transposed with a skeleton.
GetMotivated,ffcqvc1,t1_ff3ea3c,1579805364.0,"Attaboy, now I can relate to _that_."
darksouls3,ff4542g,t1_ff166t9,1579555740.0,"On my first playthrough, finally beat Aldrich after couple of days! Pontiff and Aldrich combined took me a week too. I just reached the Dancer and I love the animations, it just feels so much cleaner. Got her to Phase 2 and that's enough for one day for me. Will hopefully beat her soon!"
SelfAwarewolves,ff15b8m,t1_ff02xg1,1579475370.0,"Non American here, that quote is by this guy?? The one about female bodies shutting down or some bs."
wholesomememes,ff14wcu,t1_fezwyhn,1579475215.0,"Tbh, that sounds very cool to me, I'd love to have an opportunity like that! Unfortunately my grandparents aren't tech savvy at all, so it seems improbable. And that's just the norm here. It's honestly pretty cool bud."
darksouls3,feq44qd,t1_fepqq5a,1579337445.0,"Hi, just beat Pontiff, and Yhorm... When will I find this sword?"
darksouls3,feq26pe,t1_fepve09,1579336448.0,"I had such a hard time with him without using a shield. Once I used one I got him within a few tries. 

I think all I did during his attacks was roll behind him and spam r1/r2 and like you said it's really easy to hit him mid combo. Some of the phase 2 attacks are a bit of a pain in the ass but getting hit by the clone usually means lesser damage and Pontiff comes near your ass whiffing his swords through the air lol."
darksouls3,fepsaj5,t1_fee3fyt,1579329564.0,"Duuuuude. That fucking son of a bitch. Took me so so many tries but I finally got him. Actually since everyone says things start getting tougher here, I was trying to kill him without using a shield. Kept dying in Phase 2 so finally I was like fuck it, I'm gonna use the shield. Got him soon then. 

Also Yhorm the Giant was so freaking easy! Like at first I barely did any damage but then I picked up the weapon in his room and I did not expect it would be _that_ easy thereafter."
mildlyinteresting,femlvx1,t1_femlpjt,1579261881.0,That's a lovely and simple way to visualise it!
todayilearned,fejr03e,t1_fejapkl,1579183669.0,"After reading this thread and the comments, I was like ""Another reason to never visit Australia""

But then I googled it and it's found in the Pacific and Indian ocean OH GOD WHY"
darksouls3,fee4pxk,t1_fee3fyt,1579026350.0,Thanks a lot! I will surely beat this dude!
darksouls3,fee36ji,t1_fedw64e,1579025441.0,"One more question I'm really sorry. As I play more I get to know more things. So titanite shard can be bought from that Shrine lady, but what about large titanite shards? How careful do I have to be about them. I've only upgraded longsword to +4, whereas other favorite weapons are at +3. ( Dark Sword and Astura Greatsword). 

Oh fuck Pontiff is toughhhh."
darksouls3,fedn66i,t1_fea1ann,1579015591.0,"Hey man, thanks a lot. Another question please. What is Hollowing and why is it at 99? 

And I beat Abyss Watchers and High King Wolnir.  Wolnir was fairly easy after Abyss Watchers tbh, I could not have imagined the day I would defeat a boss in under 5 deaths. Irithyll of the Boreal Valley is so beautiful! This game is fucking amazing."
darksouls3,feak4rg,t1_feaaz43,1578949776.0,"I think it was waif you or something? I maybe mistaken, pardon."
darksouls3,fe9yjq9,t1_fe9oa0w,1578942604.0,"Hey, so I just beat the Abyss Watchers around an hour ago. New player, playing DS3 for the first time. From the advice I picked up here I put everything into Vigor mostly then Str and Dex. Right now I am Vig27/Str18/Dex18. 14 Endurance so I'll work on that I guess...I would have found that helpful in Farron Keep.

I have some questions please...The first time I entered Catacombs some red guy kicked my ass. Who was he? And any other advice?"
darksouls3,fe4lrc6,t1_fdz5ihy,1578860610.0,"Playing DS3 for the first time. Vordt gave me some trouble, and I defeated Greatwood after I understand what souls and titanite do. Crystal Saga was easy and Deacons was the easiest I've found yet. Now I'm stuck at Abyss Watchers and just can't beat his Phase 2. Bitch doesn't give me time to heal too. ;-;"
wholesomememes,fe0t8e0,t1_fe0pear,1578818369.0,I agree and I admire that you didn't use the /s to mollycoddle the joke for everyone.
india,fdpwxzb,t1_fdh8xze,1578643972.0,"Safe in general. As in protests will not bother you, just avoid those areas and you won't even know they are going on. I hope you have read up on other aspects of keeping yourself safe here. Have a great journey!"
mathmemes,fdcor60,t1_fb854ji,1578280223.0,"Hi, gonna begin Topology this semester, any advice? Have done Real Analysis and Linear Algebra partially before this."
CellToSingularity,fcuue3q,t1_fct5tsn,1577988704.0,I want to reinforce s/he is correct.

soccer,fcohtbm,t1_fcogzdu,1577832566.0,"Also a very good point, not to mention as another poster mentioned his incredible record in the CL, which shows just how well he can consistently perform under immense pressure. 

What are these traits that Messi has, in your opinion?"
soccer,fcod7a1,t1_fcoc46c,1577829366.0,"Thank you for succinctly putting in words what I could not. I agree with you for what it's worth. Not with everything but Ronaldo, although an amazing amazing player doesn't seem on the same level as Messi for me."

GetMotivated,fcjqxn7,t1_fcjnknv,1577700149.0,"Maybe I should have included that I took a huge break from the whole group. For around two years I was in no touch with them almost, they changed cities, I did, life happened and now I have gotten back in touch with a few of them. They also made efforts to make plans so that was nice."
GetMotivated,fcjglaa,t1_fcj8xja,1577686833.0,"More power to you! Have been through something similar, was in a circle where some picked on me for no reason. Slowly got very icy and they got the hint I suppose. Now I am waay better friends with the other decent people in the group and I'm really glad I took the step to start cutting bridges."
IndiaSpeaks,fbw42zl,t1_fbubbe3,1577140569.0,Galois died when he was 21??? What the fuck were these people.
