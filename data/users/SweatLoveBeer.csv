It's good to cry. So: Good job that you cried and that you allowed your feelings to just be that: Indicators that something is going on."

movies,fgj5l77,t3_eythzl,1580837409.0,"I very much prefered Dolemite and I felt like it had the better performance as well. Disaster Artist was fun, especially growing up with The Room, but it felt easier to act in a ""goofing around is easier comedy than pan-face"" way."
selflove,fgfp2eh,t3_ey3auz,1580744384.0,"I started to give each day of the week a motto to organize myself better. Mondays are for planning the week. Tuesdays are for cleaning. Wednesdays are for extra plant care. Thursdays I take extra time for my cat. Fridays are for fun things,  Saturday for meeting people,  Sundays for rest.  

Gave my days more meaning."
selfhelp,ffexccj,t1_ffe2x42,1579869286.0,"That actually sounds really horrible. A spouses is supposed to be your partner, not your antagonist..."

CPTSD,fdovcuz,t3_emi79r,1578613720.0,"I really like petting myself. I'm still very huge on touch - with my friends, not strangers - and getting head pats feels platonically orgasmic. (If that makes sense.)  

So I started petting myself, just the head a little, or my arm or so. I like it. It makes me happy. And it's a nice way to tell myself I did something good."
