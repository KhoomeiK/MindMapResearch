Left it there last Monday. Bought new car last Friday. Allstate reimbursed me for the car, car seat, rental, etc. .

I went to Service King this past Tuesday to get the rest of my belongings (couple small things like jumper cables) and license plate.

Today I realized I didn't have my work phone and the last place I had it was in my wrecked car, with no battery charge.

I'm not overconfident while driving in the snow but am cautious and defensive.

AWD certainly helps in under and over steering and climbing up hills when there is snow.

Snow tires aren't worth the money for where I live. They would be helpful a [day](https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/news/erry-2018/11/710c21e53b9657/nightmare-commute-has-drivers.html) or [two](https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/weather/2016/01/monster_snowfall_shatters_lehi.html) a year if we get a really bad storm. Otherwise, most of the time PennDOT does a decent job keeping roads clear.

edit: I should note that my other vehicle is an AWD Sorento and helped immensely in my first link. What was a normal 12 minute drive home for me took almost 5 hours. I passed many stuck and disabled vehicles on the sides of the road and though it took forever and a day to get home, I didn't slip, slide, or have any trouble going up hills."
