athiest,fghq5xg,t3_eyeyuk,1580790814.0,"Liberal? That’s an ignorant thing to say. Liberals are typically socially progressive, supporting ideas like freedom of choice and assistance for those in need. god loving conservatives push for state sponsored support for the christian idea, against the Constitution. Conservatives believe a woman has no freedom of choice over their bodies. I could write a novel, but the facts would be lost on the simpletons who believe in a deity but live better lives through science."
athiest,fghouww,t1_fgh5h9j,1580789869.0,People who believe in an organized dogma ARE gullible. Thousands of gods in numerous cultures over untold millennia and you think you’ve figured out the one true god? An all powerful benevolent deity that allows thousands of children to die of starvation daily? This thing must either be powerless to save the suffering or has made the conscious decision to allow it. Neither loving nor almighty.
