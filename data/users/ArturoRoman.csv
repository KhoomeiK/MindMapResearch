Engrish can be both spelling or grammar. If I say herro I am engrish girl... that is engrish even though it is grammatically correct. Similarly ""Strong work done"" would be grammatically correct but still engrish as you can see they translated some Japanese to english literally.

ploice is not engrish but not because it is a spelling instead of a grammar mistake. It is not engrish because it is a typo, a specific type of spelling mistake that does not count.

pls tell me if you've gotten it. Oh no I just noticed the spelling mistake in your username. No chance."
