Each time she was on, I’d pause and close out my message and not send anything and then missed my chance for like a month.

rockets,few3ga7,t1_few2429,1579404805.0,"I'd rather watch the game than rely solely on stat lines. They aren't everything and Capela is looking weak AF on the court against the top team on the West.

[From the interview with the students that were present during the incident](https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2020/01/16/4-witnesses-account-what-happened-in-bellaire-high-school-classroom-when-a-student-was-fatally-shoot/)

>He lifted his shirt up, and we saw that there was a gun in his pants. Me and Cesar saw it. ""I think he was only trying to show me, but Cesar was standing next to me,” he said. “He pulls it out of his pants, and he cocks it and a bullet comes out. After I saw that, that it was loaded, I walked away; because I didn’t want to be hurt or put in danger.""

>A witness, who was sitting on a desk only a few feet away, said she heard Cesar say “don’t point it at me” just before the shooting.

He really was killed senselessly 

>All four students said Cortes and the gunman knew each other and interacted in JROTC, but were not friends or enemies."
houston,fem7coy,t1_fejts5l,1579242378.0,"True to the academically inclined, but to be honest, Bellaire's top classes are taught by top teachers that have honed their craft and know their shit. If a student makes it out of the AP and/or IB program, they stand a good chance of making it into a top college, succeeding at said college, making connections, and have incredible opportunities. As both a student and then teacher at Bellaire, the stuff students learn in those classes will carry them well into their junior/senior year of college. I've had former students tell me how much easier classes are in college or how easily they can crank out an essay because of the AP/IB program. 
It is really sad though how the AP/IB program is it's own ecosystem within the school because they don't always get exposure to how it is on the ""outside"""

houston,fej0aqm,t1_feiuu34,1579152373.0,"In response to your second point, I’ve seen kids avoiding the snitch label first hand. It was actually at Bellaire. I taught there not too long ago, after teaching at Sharpstown for a year. Anyway one day a kid gets in trouble with an administrator at Bellaire. I happen to be in that office while he’s waiting to be seen. I recognize him as a kid from Sharpstown, we’ll call him Speedy, since my coworker called him that over there. Anyway I say, hey Speedy what are you doing here? He tells me got transferred to Bellaire that semester but got in trouble because he was suspected of being a culprit in a fight. He confides in me that it wasn’t him but he’s taking the fall since he doesn’t want to be a snitch. I’m floored. I ask him, Speedy why are YOU going to put yourself through this. He says, it’s better than being a snitch. I tell him, no this isn’t how we do things here at Bellaire. I guess it turns out that it is..."
