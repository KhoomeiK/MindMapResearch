This I agree with.  [Psychology studies show that most Trump supporters exhibit the *authoritarian personality*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YU9djt_CQM). Authoritarians tend to be submissive to their leaders, bigoted, and mean-spirited.  And the theory of the authoritarian personality was developed in the 1950s specifically as an attempt to figure out how the Nazis happened (Adorno 1950).  It's a good thing, at least, that Trump is not like Hitler.  If he was, he could totally lead the MAGA crowd towards fascism. But Trump is not a fascist.

> Just going to pose a general question: do people genuinely believe that Auschwitz and the gas chambers sprung up overnight? That nazii fascism sprung into existence and, voila—holocaust?

The Holocaust shocked the world, but everyone knew that Hitler was planning to disposses and deport Jews because he had been talking openly about it for years before taking power.  It's in *Mein Kampf*.  Trump has not written anything like that.  He's talked about deporting illegal immigrants and blocking Muslim immigration, but nothing on par with what Hitler promised he'd do to the Jews and Communists.

I think it's unlikely that America will slip into fascism.  Weimar Germany was not a robust democracy.  Already in America, I've noticed a surge of political engagement among liberals, particularly the young.  America is growing more racially diverse, and not even ending all immigration will stop that at this point.

Really, it's not Trump you should be worried about, but the Republicans getting up to their same old tricks: gerrymandering, voter suppression, and giving rewards to the rich at the expense of the poor and middle class.  Trump is not the disease, he is a symptom.  If anything, I think Trump will be good for America in the long run because his public buffoonery has drawn attention to the decay in American democracy."

And no, ""America First"" is not an ideology, that's just common ethnocentrism.  Trump is also not a military guy.  Whereas Trump weaseled his way out of conscription with that ""bone spurs"" excuse, Hitler enthusiastically enlisted when Germany entered World War 1.  Hitler loved to dress up like a soldier, and before he took power he established a paramilitary force, the brownshirts.  And Hitler never bragged about having money (he used to be a hobo).  He presented himself as a warrior and conqueror in the mold of Bismarck and Napoleon, not a businessman.

EDIT: A crucial difference I should mention: Hitler was openly anti-democracy.  Hitler promised to dismantle German democracy once he got in power.  Trump is not like that.

The death of Sanguinius doesn't really come off as foundational to the setting, and bringing him back would be no worse than bringing back any other loyalist primarch.  Bringing back the Emperor, on the other hand, would certainly upend everything.  The setting is kind of built around it.  That's not to say it would be a terrible thing &mdash; in the hands of a good writer, the Emperor's return could be awesome &mdash; but it would completely remake the status quo, because the Emperor's silent reign defines WH40K as we know it."

Look, I don't want to mock your taste.  If you like that series, good for you.  Nor do I want to bash the skill of the artist, because I don't think he could afford to put his best effort into something he did in his spare time for no pay. *Astartes* is no better than the countless shorts you can find on YouTube that animation students submit as their final project.  It's a nice thing to put on your resumé to show a potential employer, for sure.  But there's a huge gap between a short like this and a full-length feature.

There's no dialogue in this short, not much of a script.  Just decent action.  As for the quality of the animation, notice that there are no exposed faces.  Everyone is wearing a helmet or a mask.  Because doing realisitic-looking faces is notoriously difficult in 3D animation."

todayilearned,ff5nhwf,t1_ff4tfrl,1579601784.0,"I don't buy the idea that a bigger budget reduces creativity.  I think it's more that, when there's a huge budget, the investors insist on a safe approach, something tried-and-tested and therefore a bit clichéd.  We see this happening in videogames, at least, so I assume the same thing is happening in movies.  The most innovative games these days are low-budget indie titles, whereas the big-budget AAA games are the same games you played 10 years ago but with shinier graphics.  Horror movies, I'm told, are one of the most reliably-profitable genres; that, combined with the low budgets, means that investors permit more creative risk."
40kLore,ff5n5sy,t1_ff5mb7i,1579601278.0,"You talk as if the Imperial Guard would be able to focus dozens if not millions of lasguns on a single Chaos Space Marine.  That's not going to happen.  I read that in real warfare, soldiers expend thousands of rounds of ammo to get just one hit on an enemy soldier.  How much firepower would the guardsmen have to pour on a Space Marine before inflicting lethal wounds?  Space Marines aren't just built like tanks, they are small and nimble too.  If it takes a dozen lasgun hits to down a Space Marine, then in practical terms they're impervious to lasgun fire."
40kLore,ff5lh8c,t3_erm2m2,1579598690.0,"Against Space Marines, lasguns are more effective in the tabletop game than in the novels.  Space Marines seem almost impervious to lasguns in the novels.  I think this is silly, because if that's the case, then the Imperium would have been stomped by Chaos Space Marines a long time ago.  After all, there aren't enough loyalist Chapters to defend every Imperial world, which means the Imperial Guard must mount an adequate defense against Chaos Space Marine attacks."

I asked Bob Naismith why he designed the pauldrons that way, and he said it was to give the Space Marine minis a bigger presence on the table. Practicality had nothing to do with it."
