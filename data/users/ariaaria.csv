I upvoted your comment by the way, but it was not enough haha"

I'm 100% recovered now, but that was a lesson I'd never forget: nobody will remember you when they've gotten to where they want to be. This does not mean don't help people, it just means don't expect anything in return."

timetravel,ffg7ma8,t3_et8gku,1579900197.0,"This is why time travel in this universe is not possible. You also need to remember that to travel back in time on Earth, you would need enough energy to move the entire universe back in time as well. That would take all the energy in the entire universe."

I find parties boring and still enjoy gaming.

He came out as gay, but I'm a pretty straight guy (but I don't mind gay people at all).

He's wealthy and I am not.

Because of these cultural factors, our interests don't align."

confessions,ff13pea,t1_fezgy26,1579474888.0,"As someone else mentioned, you can 'hurt' yourself and have the outcome work in your favour.

Take a freezing cold shower to the point where you feel sleepy, go for a run (while sprinting until you feel winded), do something you really don't want to do (such as asking a girl out that you believe will say 'no' to you).

I had a similar impulse in the past and these helped me get over it. As for depression, I have learned to embrace it than to shun it away."

timetravel,fdumvz6,t3_emx13k,1578735497.0,"I think you guys are looking at time as if it were a line that could be navigated.
I want you to start looking at time as a 'rate of change'. 
The universe is constantly expanding, with planets orbiting stars and the creation of black holes. In order to reverse time, we'd also have to retract the universe which would take an enormous amount of energy.

With the resources we currently have access to, redacting the universe's rate of change (what you guys call time travel) is impossible."
timetravel,fdumio6,t1_fdnbx6z,1578735317.0,We are all travelling to the future right now. I think we need to start pulling people out of cryosleep to answer this question. It is what they would've wanted.
