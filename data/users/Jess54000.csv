This is really interesting.

I have never been in a physical altercation unless I was trying to break it down (tried once, would not recommend haha), if that’s what you mean by fight ? 

In my country, debating is really common, we don’t see it as fighting, it’s an exchange for us. The point being to give your facts and hear others and see if you learnt something, in a way. 
But I have noticed that on Reddit, facts kinda take a back burner position in debate, it’s kinda disappointing since an debate without facts or reasoning is more about emotion, which shouldn’t get in the way of a good debate. But again, maybe it’s a cultural thing that I haven’t fully grasped. I have been told that we have a reputation abroad for debating about everything haha

I actually posted here in regards to that.

I feel like debating in writing leaves a lot to interpretation and since my debating « style » is to go through every of the arguments and counter them with mine, I was afraid it came off as arrogant. Which is not how I mean it, since, well, a debate is all about agreeing or disagreeing with the other person’s argument and verbalizing it.

What does « in your face » mean ?

Reliable friend : I’ll let my friend judge haha
Protector : yeah, I MAY have heard that before...

Agressive and close-minded : is it how I phrase what I say or...? Genuinely curious, because I don’t want to be the first and I pride myself in being tolerant and allowing myself to change my mind (if the argument are there of course), so if I’m acting like a close minded person, I’d like to correct it, that’s not who I want to be.

« You don’t care about tailoring a public image » : probably a second effect of the relative anonymity of reddit, « no one knows me so who care » mentality.


The « big personality made me laugh. Because I’d say I’m pretty bland IRL, introvert working on being more extrovert kinda deal.

As for which community I’m active in, I mainly go on reddit to lurk and I generally only comment on thread that (I feel) are unfair or seem like an interesting debate, so yes it is not really representative since I don’t generally debate with strangers in the street haha, although a friend once dragged me into one with a guy in a bar, but we were both drunk so not sure it counts."

Since you invoked the 1st amendement, I assumed that you are American. You are welcome to correct me if you are not.

I said : « And choosing to deprive kids of education is a form of child abuse (often used by sects too) that has grave consequences for the kids »

So right there.

And since countering a fact with an opinion doesn’t hold any weight if you don’t have arguments to defend said opinion,
I asked « What would be a reasonable or logical reason why it would be child abuse not to forcing a kid to go to church ? »."
AmItheAsshole,feim317,t1_feiijei,1579141717.0,"« It is billions, easily. Probably just in Asia and Africa alone. »
Look it up, like I did.
While Asia and Africa are more impacted because less developed, I didn’t event (edit : invent) the number I gave you. As of 2016, 750 million people  were still illiterate, but literacy keeps rising so It littérale can’t be billions.

Here’s one source for you : http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs45-literacy-rates-continue-rise-generation-to-next-en-2017_0.pdf

« Reason for what? I don't think you even know what you're asking. »

I literally quoted you right before, so I was referring to that, but since you didn’t understand, I’ll spell it out for you. 
What would be a reasonable or logical reason why it would be child abuse not to forcing a kid to go to church ?

« Do you see the irony in this? Lol »

Actually no. I have answered every part of your comments and gave concrete argument while you kept answering with « but some people think *this* or *that*, so that makes all your facts wrong » (which it doesn’t, you can only negate a fact with another). Also you avoided whole paragraphs and arguments of my responses or just pretended (I hope) not to understand.

« Not necessarily, but it's not immoral either. The legal system should not be your moral compass. »

When I asked : « Is it illegal not to bring kids to church ? »

You answered : « Legality is not the same as morality » which would imply that while it’s not illegal, it lacks morality. 

Which is why I asked « So it’s strictly amoral to you not being kids to church ? »

And since to you it’s not amoral nor immoral, this sentence « Legality is not the same as morality », needs explaining since you take morality to defend why it’s necessary to bring kids to church but then say it’s not amoral or immoral not to do so..

And the legal system is certainly not my moral compass, you’re the one who brought up school, I only pointed out that while it was a legal obligation, religion isn’t. 

Honestly that’s impressive how purposefully obtuse you can be.

And I really don’t mean it in an offending way, but I actually have empathy for you and the fact that you have been so indoctrinated that you’re unable to accept actual facts. And I think that answer your question towards another commenter as to why it’s difficult get rid of ingrained doctrine.

« That’s why it’s creepy » 

I worded it wrong I think. When I said « the person you are », I meant how extreme the church you affiliated with is. But your level of endoctrinement and close mindedness is a dead give away of your religious implication. And again, i don’t mean it in an offending way.

Now as I have noticed that you are increasingly dodging questions and being rude, I don’t expect this debate to be constructive for anyone...

Sorry for the huge response but I tried to detail what I meant as much as possible so I won’t have to explain what I’m trying to say."

The mother is nonchalant about it, and AGAIN, she doesn’t even know what a baptism implies... 
and no one are telling them what they should do, the people you argue use are just saying that he’s not an asshole for putting his foot down and that the wife needs to communicate better. You’re the one who made assumptions... and if you comment on AITA assuming that OP is lying, why even bother ? 

Illiteracy is a consequence of not getting an education, you say that some people think kids don’t need education, therefore, they are choosing for them to be illiterates. So you’re saying that it can be a choice.
Also you used the argument that « billions » (not really) kids don’t get education to defend the fact that some people don’t think education is necessary. So what did you mean exactly ? 

« There are people that would say the same exact thing to you about religion. »

Again, I still haven’t heard reasonable or logical reason in that sense. 

In a debate, you’re supposed to bring facts, not « but some people think differently ». If you can’t bring tangible arguments to defend an opinion in a debate, then what’s the point ? 

« Legality is not the same as morality »

So it’s strictly amoral to you not being kids to church ? If so, again what’s your arguments, because they are many that go against (although I have a feeling you would not admit to them since they are facts that don’t paint the Catholic Church in a good light).

« I do mind you asking. Mind your own business, don't try to critique my character or choices. »

I asked politely, trying to make it clear that I didn’t intend to be offensive and wouldn’t judge your lack of answer, but you decide to answer in quite a rude way with « the mind your own business ». And also i wouldn’t used it to criticize your life choice (another assumption on your part). It would have given me a better idea of the kind of person you are but I would never use the belief of someone against them. Their actions though... that’s another matter. Which is why the only form of religion I would actively protest are the extremists ones.

Which points haven’t I refuted exactly ?

Edit : illiteracy can also be the result of a learning disability that wasn’t diagnosed but that’s for a minority of the cases (it doesn’t add to the debate but I thought important to not forget about them)"

But I was... otherwise I wouldn’t have mentioned it so much. You do realize that this is a sub where people judge a specific situation, not the ins and outs of someone’s general opinion on a subject by taking it out of context ?

Are you seriously saying that illiteracy is a choice ? Out of the 750 millions (not billions) illiterates in the world, most of them are in developing countries. And  choosing to deprive kids of education is a form of child abuse (often used by sects too) that has grave consequences for the kids. It’s also illegal including in the US. So yes, maybe some parents choose to deprive their kids of education, but it’s illegal and seriously reprehensible. Is it illegal not to bring kids to church ? 

You should really drop that comparison because those things can’t be compared. 

Oh and, yes, I believe education is important, and many countries fought for it to happen. And there are logical, reasonable reasons why it is necessary. I never heard reasons why it was necessary to force a child into a religion.


« Some parents view their religion as completely necessary. »
But not THESE parents, I don’t understand why you have to take it out of context.

I understand now, that from the beginning you were unable to stay on the topic, which was OP’s situation and just went on a crusade against people without realizing that most of them stayed on the subject (some fell into the same trap as you and started generalizing things).

« According to Christianity, this isn't true. And we've established the parents get to decide, so... » 
Yes but both parents are atheist so it’s not really their decision to baptize the baby. The Wife is noncommittal to keep the peace with her mother, and the husband says no. Does that sound like THEY as a unit want their child to be baptized ? The mother doesn’t even know what it implies.

Maybe I wasn’t clear, but when I said school I meant education. Like learning to read, count, history, to write etc... so if you actually believe that this isn’t necessary, you’re too far gone...

« You don't get to decide for a parent what their child needs » 
Then MIL shouldn’t have planned a baptism, it should be the parents decision, per your admission.

But you are still saying that even though the parent are atheist they should comply to the MIL wishes to baptize the baby

You can’t have it both way. Say that the parents get to chose, but it’s ok for the wife to go against her husband’s wishes just to please grandma, since it disregard one of the parent’s reasonable choice to let the baby choose later in life (a choice that doesn’t go against his wife belief since she is atheist and again, doesn’t care one way or the other). 

It feels like what you’re saying is, that’s not okay to go against MIL’s belief (since she’s the one who actually vocalized her WANT to baptize the baby) but it’s ok to do so to OP...."

Then I’ll repeat : school is NECESSARY, religion isn’t. If a kid doesn’t go to school, he doesn’t develop, if he doesn’t go to church, he doesn’t... know gospel ? Have someone tell him he will end up in hell for doing this or that (while conveniently ignoring the Bible passages that doesn’t fit his narrative) ? Big loss in one case, not one in the other. And again, he can still make the choice to go to church when he has the capacity to voice it, it won’t change anything. While not going to school is setting him up for so many life difficulties.

And from your comments you seem to say that being indoctrinated isn’t a bad thing since you can educate yourself (through school or experience or self awareness). You are missing the part where religion is pretty communitarian and can be judgmental to those who leave.

Once again your answer is basically, women are always receiving more empathy because they are women.

And *again* you didn’t address the main subject, which is that you made an assumption and think that it means it’s the reality since it fits your opinion.


« I don’t think so » : opinion. The thing is, you don’t think so but you can’t know (even though you think you’re omniscient) since you don’t have a counter situation. Moreover, the debate was on why they were defending her, not wether they were doing it or not... 

« Single mothers will always » : generalization.. I have the same empathy for single parents, regardless of their gender. The only things that could make my empathy be lacking would be who they are as a person and how they act. But since, « Single mothers will always elicit more sympathy then single fathers because women will always get more sympathy then men. », then what does it mean ? Would it be possible that (shocking, I know) generalizing something is not a good idea since *YOUR OPINION DOESN’T MAGICALLY BECOME A FACT* (second attempt at hoping you can read) ?

No, we just need people to stop making assumptions and belittling a whole gender without actual cause.

You see, in all this, I never said I disagreed with the fact that some women use tears as a manipulation tactic, I don’t even disagree that since they have been painted as weak and needing constant assistance from men, some people still react that way to them. But so far you have been hell bent on defending the fact that it HAD to be why the friends were defending her, which is an assumption made to specifically fit your narrative. If I was some kind of feminazi like you seem to imply, i would have just said « no it can’t be this, it’s because their sad for the child ».

But no, I only pointed out that *again* you were making a baseless assumption and using derogatory terms on a whole gender.

I don’t have daddy issues, quite the opposite, I would be way quicker at defending my father than my mother (if I ever felt the urge to defend her, which is quite unlikely), and I don’t respond to the kind of sexist bias you obviously have, so, again, your argument doesn’t stand.

My main problem with your comment was also the fact that the word you used were purposefully derogatory and generalizing an opinion that is yours to have.

Moreover, you may not realize it, but by doing that you basically reinforce this unbalance in perception.

And you talk about shedding bias while being obviously biased since you refuse to even entertain the idea that her statut as a single parent could be the reason why people have pity for her.

I don’t say that some manipulative women don’t use the water works to get what they want, but men have other ways of being manipulative that work just right too...

So I guess my point is, I’m not dying to challenge your opinion since it’s too biased to have an open discussion, I just disagree with people making generalizing comment in a derogatory way and making assumption, especially when you had the option of *asking* OP why his friends think he should help.
