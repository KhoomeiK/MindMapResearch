Not great, but the entire plot of the show, is those people need to sit the fuck down and talk for 5 minutes to realise they could be the best of friends. or get married, or take over the world. But nope, too busy freaking out about what they think they saw. It's hilarious, and made even better by the 1 guy in the group who clearly sees this shit going on, and makes it worst on purpose just because he finds it hilarious."

The hope of many is that, by reviving kotor 1-2, making it polished and attractive they make money enough to realise there IS a market for well made single player rpg in that style.

There shouldn't be any of this shit in any video game, outside of straight up casino gambling games. Saying games with MT are fine is the same as saying advertisement is good for TV or the internet.

They have no competition. There's nothing like the sims, so of course the sims is popular. It's like 600$ for a single game, and somehow it sells well and gets good reviews.

Skyrim's only real competition was the witcher, wich, I will admit was good. I personnaly didn't like it very much, but I will respect the game and recognize it's a high quality game.

&#x200B;

Skyrim on the other hand? it's a shoddy mess. The year it came out, it was unplayable on ps3 due to the save file size bugs, it was laggy, crashing constantly and was a poorly balanced game.

&#x200B;

Even today, skyrim's balance is completly out the window.

&#x200B;

If modds didn't fix skyrim, it would STILL be hailed as a good game, despite extremly shitty coding and patches. Why? because theres nothing even remotely close to it's style of gameplay. It's unique.

&#x200B;

It really fucking shouldn't be. I guarentee someday we'll see a game in the style of elder scroll that is FAR better, and not made by bethesda. ES6 will be ''ok'', at best. Mods might make it good, but it sure as fuck won't be a good game on it's own. Fallout 76 has seen to that."
