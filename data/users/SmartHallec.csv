AskReddit,ffftla8,t3_et0asi,1579891511.0,"In elementary school, the mother of a girl I knew who lived a couple houses down used to put her hands on me, would rub my leg just above the knee, and tell me how cute she thought I was. I remember this made me uncomfortable and a little sick to my stomach at the time.

In HS, one of my best friends Mom would hit on me every time I saw her and she was in her late 40's.

In my early 20's, I was at the bar playing pool, leaning over the table to shoot and some woman came up behind me, reached between my legs and grabbed my junk. I was so shocked I don't think I said anything to her about it."

Psychedelics could possibly be used to connect other parts of the brain and recruit more connections where connections are needed.

I've noticed that even weeks, or perhaps permanently, after taking a dose of LSD certain closed eye visuals will persist, tho with greatly diminished contrast (easy to ignore or forget about), but this has led me to believe that the increased connections created with the substance has some permanence. Perhaps symptoms could be reduced by using hallucinogens.

I stop, turn my perception inward and focus on the uncomfortable, then I force myself to just sit with it, and can then take care of the situation in my mind and provide reasons why this thing is happening that consists more of circumstances and stressors rather than , This person or that person is an evil jerk and there's something about me that warrants this poor treatment or circumstance.

Psychonaut,fe5g7v2,t3_defoog,1578869092.0,"My wife and I took only 1.5g last night, but for some reason it hit me HARD within 20 minutes, and during the peak, I close my eyes and I see these two green, praying mantis type creatures, looking right at me while fractal patterns all the way out to my periphery spun around in great vividness. I was scared of them because this is my first mushroom experience and I was floored by how different and all encompassing it was vs LSD. Anyway, they looked LIKE a mantis creature, but also very alien... Their mouth for example, was not a mouth that I had ever seen before... It was made up of a bunch of rotating spheres and was somehow ethereal. Anyway, my wife remembers me saying I saw these guys (male or female or neither idk actually) and I can't believe other people have seen the same thing! It's amazing to me... They were the most real and 'There' thing in my whole trip. Closed my eyes and they were just there, slowing getting closer, and I can't say they were anything but benevolent but they did scare me so I opened my eyes and ended the meet and greet early. I feel honored somehow."

Furthermore, the director had a particular vision to communicate, and if it's been recorded digitally in 4k HD, guess what? They wanted the audience to see it the way it was produced.

In any case, 4k is 4x as good as 1080P and 16x as good as SD video, and that's just a scientific fact.

A 4k movie with an acceptable bitrate and 8 channel audio is anywhere from 25-35 GB, and if I want to have a media server for my home - serving a half dozen movies in each genre - I'm going to need about 10-12TB worth of 1TB drives for that, plus a couple more for games and apps.
