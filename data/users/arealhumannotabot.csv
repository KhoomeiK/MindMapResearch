And the movie he turnedi t down for, as you likely know, was Wild Wild West, which did fine at the B.O. but was no Matrix.

As for Pitt, I was listening to him and DiCaprio (together) on Marc Maron's podcast. Fun episode, btw. He expresses the same sentiment at one point. He and DiCaprio talk about seeing all these people who get hung onto parts they didn't get, and it became a part in and of itself. It ate that person up, thinking ""I coulda been that guy!"" Sounds like he stayed grounded."

Damnthatsinteresting,feupqkp,t1_fetrdmj,1579388819.0,"There was some feature that existed on some caterpillars that gave it a slight survival edge, statistically, over the ones that didn't have this feature. It might be anything, let's say a black dot that looked like a single eye.

After many many generations, more families with the black dot exist, but at some point some were born with TWO black dots, which look even more like a pair of eyes to a predator. Over time, these become the ones that tend to survive better than the cyclops ones or the ones without any black dots which have now died out.

OKAY BUT somewhere we had ones with a larger head mate with some that had black dots. Now we've got caterpillars with two black dots and a slightly larger head. For a predator at a distance, this stands out a little more than a caterpillar with a normal-size head and one black ""eye"" dot.

And so on, and so on, and so on. Over time you just look around and see which one has the advantage, and it's likely going to come out on top. It's probably something that is always in flux.

I think it's the small scale that's easy to imagine and when it's large-scale it confuses our puny human minds.

There's a telecom company in Canada that realized the best way to make money since people were bootlegging the content was to own all of the other parts. So this telecom company owns the MLB baseball team Toronto Blue Jays, broadcasts the games on their cable network, using two tiers. SOME games are on one channel, more popular match-ups are on a premium channel. You pay to watch no matter what, but you pay even MORE if you want to watch all games.
