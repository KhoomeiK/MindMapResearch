1) What industry are you in, what is your current situation? Perhaps spruce up your resume and start asking around for other opportunities? 

2) Daughter's schooling - while it may be a source of pride, does she really need the better school? Can she work harder to squeeze more out of the opportunity you can afford? Or is there a way you can invest time or energy in helping her achieve more?

3) Mom's health and rent - it may be time for a sit down with her to lay out your concerns and figure out a plan re: her health. I'd need more details about why she cant afford her rent, if her income is changing maybe she needs help finding a cheaper place?"
