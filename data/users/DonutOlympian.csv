But most drills are two rounds and assess. 

Also, we’re trained to shoot center mass of the largest visible part of the body because you’re more likely to hit a larger target than a smaller target, especially when under stress due to various physiological reasons. 

Second, the suspects are hardly shot more than a few times. 100 rounds might be shot, but if they’re in a car like 90 of those get stuck in metal. 

Lastly, we shoot until the threat ends. If someone is shot once and gives up great. If they’re shot 20 times and continue trying to fight they’ll get shot 21 times."
