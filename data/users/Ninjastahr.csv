PrequelMemes,fem7t5k,t1_felvbla,1579242862.0,"Honestly the best strong whatever-minority-you-choose character is one who acts like a damn human being, and unless the movie is *about* their hardships it shouldn't even really matter more than a passing comment.  Like, I want to see a movie where the main character is gay, and maybe happens to have a husband.  Just treat it no differently than anyone else, don't make a big deal about it, because there is no reason to make it a big thing."

Edit: okay people, I did not vote for Trump in 2016.  But I do know people who did who are fantastic human beings who spend their time doing charity work, and most certainly are not racist, sexist, etc.  Just because you didn't like Hillary more than you didn't like Trump does not then automatically make you racist, crazy, dumb, or any combination of those."
