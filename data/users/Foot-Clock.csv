traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fffzmnn,t3_etaby3,1579895275.0,"Oof that me.  Sometimes I just feel kind of scared in trans spaces that people will hate me because I used to be transphobic.  In the end, it only ever hurt me, though.  All that shit just prevented me from realizing I was trans when it might have been easier to do something about it.  Honestly, it wasn't realizing I was trans that made me drop those transphobic beliefs, it was dropping those beliefs that made me realize I'm trans."

I know it's bad to have pictures like that out there, but I promise you it will be okay.  A lot of people have been in situations like this, so it's nothing to be ashamed of, and it's not your fault anyways.  I've had something similar happen to me and I ended up getting >!raped!< because of it.  I blamed myself at first, but I've slowly been able to accept that it wasn't my fault, and that the culprit deserves infinitely more blame than I (or in your case, you) do. 

Stay strong, and keep going."

Part of that is being unemployed, but a big part of it is also the fact that I live in fear of what could happen to me out there.  I've been getting better at dealing with it, and I've been feeling a lot less scared lately, but leaving the house is still difficult for me."
