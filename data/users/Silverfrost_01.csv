A relatively brief look through google brought me to this. It seems like one of the more credible sources I could find. According to the document, most women are having abortions out of some form of convenience to themselves. Both rape and medical issues were relatively small, with rape being cited as less than 0.5%.

Wanting to go to school or ‚Äúnot able to financially support‚Äù a child are not reason enough to have an abortion because someone had a little too much fun one night and got pregnant.

Do I think this because I believe that these people need to be punished? No, I think this because we all have to take responsibility for our own actions and ending someone else‚Äôs life just to avoid responsibility for actions said person made is selfish and wrong."

XCOM2,feldqbw,t1_feldke4,1579219774.0,Hmm. Are you making sure that your soldiers have the ability to fire on the vast majority of turns? Also what do you think the approximate average hit chance of each of your shots tend to be?
XCOM2,feld998,t1_felcitj,1579219455.0,"Additionally you don‚Äôt want to be moving your squad too far if you don‚Äôt know what is ahead of you.
