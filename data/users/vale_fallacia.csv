* Consistency. You have to enforce team discipline, which means *you* have to be disciplined. You have to check in with everyone and expect concrete results on what they are doing. If people are lax with filling out the correct information in tickets, you can't just say ""put more details into tickets"" and expect everyone to just run with it. If they've gotten away with being lazy up until now, they're going to continue that and count on you getting distracted from this new goal.

I've never shot a firearm (I have held an unloaded one, for, get this, a catalogue shoot in the UK). I'm probably considered very left wing, and believe in the UK NHS etc etc. But, as I said before, the constitution and its amendments are the basis of law in the USA. I believe if governments want to restrict firearms, they need to pass amendments to do so, not sneak around them.

There's a mix of people going to the Virginia capitol building today, right? Some of those are going to be white supremacists. Is there a plan or something to deal with instigators or *agents provocateur*?

This question is more off topic, and I hope it's not against the rules. Please tell me if it is, and I'll delete it. There's a lot of rhetoric/posturing from various people about ""civil war II"" and what appears, to me, to be a bloodthirstiness for conflict. Do people forget that their fellow Americans will be the ones dying, not the rich assholes who instigate this via media, social media, lobbying, etc etc? (I'm not a US Citizen, but I consider myself American, and proudly so)

If I wanted to support 2nd amendment rights, but didn't want to contribute to the NRA or others who I feel spread division in the country, do you have any suggestions? I am worried that some folks are going to get hurt today, and be saddled with huge medical bills like the survivors of the Las Vegas attack, and I'd like to donate to help them if needed.

Also, I wanted to wish everyone who is attending the best of luck. I hope it remains peaceful and an effective exercising of your rights.

But I'd also add *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* to *Jaws*.

Hmm. This needs more research. I need to watch them all again, and figure out which ones go together. *2001: A Space Odyssey* probably fits better with *Close Encounters*. *Aliens* and *Predator* go well together. Maybe pair *Die Hard* with *Big Trouble in little China*? *Jaws* and *The Thing* works for me. I guess that leaves *Robocop* to pair up with *Total Recall* (or *The Running Man*) and have 80s action babies."

Actually, more seriously, I'm guessing the latter makes sense. At first glance, having an endpoint or subscriber per sensor type seems correct to me. Then have that subscriber separate out by host. Hmm. The things we do for fun!"
