WTF,ffa0mie,t1_ff9vemn,1579725482.0,Anyone looking for more info should look at [Lake Nyos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Nyos_disaster) which burped a cubic kilometer of CO2 one night in 1986 and killed nearly all the people and animals in a 16 mile radius.
financialindependence,ff96zw2,t3_esb29b,1579706319.0,"There will always be someone with a salary to look up at. At $50k, you already make more than many HOUSEHOLDS in the US. And if you hit that $60k mark, you'll be making more than 4 out of 5 American adults. You'll be in the top 12% if you hit $85k. Don't let a small niche community like this skew your perception. As you look up at others, consider how many are looking up at you.

Also, considering your ""quarter life"" comment: the average life expectancy for a male in the us is 78. You passed the ""quarter life"" mark when you were a teenager, ""third life"" has happened in your mid-20s. Life is moving and starting over fresh in your 30s is possible, but it better be worth the effort. So go ahead and do it if it's what will make you happy, but it's not worth the time and debt if you're just chasing money IMO."
