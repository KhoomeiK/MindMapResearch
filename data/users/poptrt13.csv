They should definitely put a camera inside the dishwasher to project the image to a screen on the outside of the dishwasher. And if the dishes are dirty then you have the option of projecting an image of an empty/clean dishwasher. *boom* Now I look like I have my shit completely together. No dirty dishes here!"
AskMenOver30,ffavpno,t1_ffak484,1579745588.0,"Having kids very close in age (mine are 1, 3 and 5) is A LOT of work up front. But in the long run, they'll be experiencing school/life events around the same time and will likely share many friends and hobbies. That's the strategy I went with, anyway. Plus I got to keep almost everything from baby #1 and reuse with my others.

selfimprovement,ff2klm8,t3_er4be7,1579510466.0,"A book that greatly helped me overcome a negative mindset is called ""You Are a Badass"" by Jen Sincero. A large chunk of it is about how to overcome the lies we tell ourselves about what we're capable of. An example of my own would be that I'd tell myself I'm bad with money. This is a lie that would allow me to spend money how I wanted to spend it. Instead, I now tell myself I'm good with money and I now spend or save accordingly. 

Also, I heartily agree that the people you spend the most time with are the people you'll end up being. And your spouse is a HUGE factor in this as well. 

Congrats on your success in life so far! I'm sure you'll have many more years to come."

AskReddit,fexxvw1,t1_fexvkkq,1579438099.0,My dad just passed away Friday due to bowel impaction. Do you have any sources to confirm this? The doctors at the hospital wanted/performed an autopsy as well.
AskReddit,feux92i,t1_feumpt8,1579390873.0,"I'm reading ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill and the ""secret"" to success is to basically will what you want into existence. The examples in the book are mostly about money and success but it could be applied to basically anything material. Also, ""You Are a Badass"" by Jen Sincero has similar themes with manifesting what you want in your life as long as you are very specific and direct in your purpose/goal. 

As far as victims having it coming, it could just be reasoned that if they are ""drifting"" without particular thought or direction (beyond basic day to day tasks) that they are more at risk for things happening TO them as opposed to FOR them. 

Also, I have no idea what the study was called, but I read an article about how they questioned a bunch of convicted criminals on how they selected their victims. On the videos they were shown, almost all of the criminals picked the same type of person walking down the street. Slouched, walking slow, looking nervous, etc. Basically, if you look/act/present like a victim, you're more likely to be a victim. 

These are just really interesting topics to me, I have no particular wish to convince anyone one way or another."

AskDocs,fecc53p,t1_fe9qf6x,1578970512.0,"I wish now that I had gone with him to his appointments. I didn't realize the potential seriousness of his digestive issues and thought that him seeing his doctors was enough. If I had known the actual diagnosis I would have been able to help him change his diet. 

Thank you so much for your thoughtful response. I've spent the last few minutes looking up gastroparesis and intestinal dysmotility and both of those seem to line up with what the doctors told me at the hospital. I'm guessing at the extent of his prior opioid addiction but it was severe enough for him to have gone to rehab and get methadone. His addiction was a big secret until he started treatment so I'll never know how bad it was. 

I was able to see the causes of death listed on the death certificate today (although the full autopsy report won't be back for a couple weeks). 4th on the list was bowel obstruction so it seems you're correct about the stool acting as an obstruction in itself. The top 3 (I remember one was cardiopulmonary edema) were resulting from the chain reaction of the inflammation and bowl obstruction."

Do you have any local moms that can mentor you and help you file any paperwork you need filed?  

Don't be hard on yourself. Most kids think their parents are lame. From personal experience, I was hard on my mom when I was young but as I grew older I really appreciated (and still appreciate) all of her sacrifices in raising 4 kids alone."

SingleParents,fdvbucx,t1_fdunzqs,1578745816.0,"Ok.

So, how old is the kid? Have you seen them interact or met him/her yet?  

My kids are very young so my advice to a guy dating me would be to remember to have a lot of patience and be prepared to be be asked to play with a lot of toys. I wouldn't want a man to ""discipline"" or admonish my kids. I would want him to feel respected though so if he told my kids to stop doing something I would also back him up and tell my kids the same. 

Just make sure you're aware of this kids feelings and that you're respectful. Always treat kids with respect because that's how you want them to treat you."
SingleParents,fdttet3,t3_en27g2,1578721912.0,"I *am* a single parent (not dating one) but I would suggest you stop looking at the kid as a problem you need to overcome and start looking at the kid as an individual that you want to relate to on a more personal level. Read some articles on good parenting for starters. It isn't that you necessarily want to be his parent, just that you want interactions with him to be healthy, positive and beneficial for all involved. Talk to your partner and get very clear on her boundaries with your involvement. What is her parenting style?"
SingleParents,fdrasbx,t3_emtw3l,1578681843.0,"My son started school this year. He did this for the first few weeks and I started talking to the teacher after school and getting info about what activities they had planned for the next day so I could ""hype him up"" before school. I would mention it a couple times the evening before and then again at drop off about whatever fun thing they were going to do. It worked to an extent, although obviously my son saw what I was trying to do, sometimes his interest was still peaked. 

Another thing the teacher set up for him was a ""calm down corner"" where she put giant pillows and a few fidget toys so he could calm down and join the class when he was ready. His teacher is awesome, not sure if every teacher would care that much."
SingleParents,fdr7bf9,t3_emue3r,1578680513.0,"As a mom, I went on a date with a childless man a few days ago. I was on the fence about whether I would date someone with no kids before this but that date sealed the deal. I could not. I have nothing in common with someone that doesn't have kids. And using your example I also wouldn't date someone who's polyamorous, even if they say they're monogamous for me. I would be concerned we'd be wasting our time and he'd realize later that he wanted to be poly again. To me, those are two strikes against *him*, not you. Everyone has different preferences. Just being good looking or having a good job doesn't make this person the best choice for you. If you're feeling this insecure about the relationship, there are probably more subtle signs that it's not right as well. 

As far as you being a hot mess... girl, who isn't? The right man will love you, even on your messy days. It's a lot harder to find a partner being a single parent because our standards are a lot higher. We have to find someone that fits into our lives and we fit into theirs. Our lives have a lot more moving parts and chaos than before but they're still beautiful lives and we are still worthy of love. 

Also, are you in a position or a field that would allow you to find a job that's not on call? That's super stressful on anyone, especially a single parent."
socialskills,fdqm789,t3_emrb1t,1578669986.0,This is very true.
socialskills,fdqlwlt,t3_emo39v,1578669794.0,"As far as being unattractive, confidence doesn't mean I think I'm attractive, it means I don't care whether or not you think I'm attractive. I have days where I feel very ugly and days where I feel pretty. Confidence in the face of your own ""ugliness"" comes in when you remember that attraction is not strictly physical and that it's very relative. Everyone has their own idea of what makes someone attractive. 

For hobbies, I think someone showing how capable they are is sexy. Knowing how to perform a skilled hobby (such as rock climbing or hunting) will give you confidence in that specific area and sometimes lead to more confidence overall. I started shooting pool when I was 21 and I have a lot of confidence when I go to bars because I know exactly where I'll be and what I'll be doing. I used to have really bad social anxiety and playing pool has helped tremendously. I always have something to talk about.

I think the advice about your self worth is that you want to be able to maintain your self-confidence even if others don't like you. Or that you won't be a people pleaser and go against your own self interest because you can't stand up for yourself. Being confident means you live by your own principles and you know what you're doing and why you're doing it at all times. 

I can recommend some books for you if you're the type to read."

I got a library card so I could get the libby app and sign up to borrow free audiobooks. I also signed up for hoopla, which is better imo.
