Whereas with Star Trek, it's easy to not really care about the canonicity of the nu-Trek films because they're explicitly in a different timeline. People do bicker about Discovery though, and I imagine we'll see some bickering once Picard comes out.

I think a more accurate comparison for the Trek community would be right after the release of 09, or maybe after the release of Nemesis. (I'm not old enough to remember how well-received First Contact was by the hardcore trekkies.) Or hell, maybe when Enterprise was airing?"
