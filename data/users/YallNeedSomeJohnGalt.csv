MurderedByWords,ffs3nb6,t1_ffs2srp,1580172321.0,So what is a reasonable profit margin? The fact that your are financially illiterate doesn't invalidate my point.
MurderedByWords,ffs0pei,t1_ffrweqy,1580170304.0,"What? You've just created a tautology and then asked if I fundamentally disagree with it... Look let's try putting some math behind this.

Walmart's profit margin is about 3%. Meaning for every $100 of goods they sell Walmart only keeps $3. $97 go towards cost of goods, transportation, electricity, rent, debt, and labor. For most retailer labor is about 20% of costs but for easy math let's just say on every $100 of goods $20 goes toward labor (technically it would be $19.40). So let's say we arbitrarily decide that if Walmart doubled what it paid employees then their employees could buy food and not use government assistance. Well suddenly on that $100 worth of goods the costs are now $117 because we doubled their salary from $20 to $40 a difference of $20 so we add that to the original $97. Now Walmart is losing $17 for every $100 it sells. Clearly this is unsustainable.

So what can Walmart do? It can try to reduce labor costs by laying people off but they already have about has few employees as possible to run the business and laying people off reduces their income from $40 to $0 so that doesn't seem like it will solve your problem.

The other option then is decrease other costs but those are already as low as they can reasonably go and every effort is already going into lowering costs to try to increase profits in the first place so blood from a stone there.

The last option is increasing the price of goods. In this case to make the same margin (3%) you would need to charge $117/0.93=$120.62. This amounts to a 20.62% increase in the price to consumers, including the employees who would most likely buy their groceries at Walmart anyway. Well our original raise no longer covers the cost of groceries so we need to increase wages another 20.62% or $40*20.62%=$8.25 which then raises total costs to $125.24 while revenue is only $120.62 so again losing $5. If you keep going you end up in a place where workers can afford the groceries and there is a 3% margin at about $130. So groceries have gone up 30% but worker pay has gone up by 130% so all is well right? 

Except for all the people who don't work for Walmart, many of whom don't work at all who had their groceries suddenly go up by 30%. This mean they need more food stamps and government assistance and in the end have you really solved anything?

I've linked Walmart's annual report in an earlier comment, if you can find a different fact based solution that gives everyone what they need then be my guest. At the end of the day though it isn't an employer's responsibility to ensure employees can cover their expenses, that responsibility falls on the individual. Otherwise if you assume employers are responsible for ensuring employees can meet their expenses suddenly employers have no incentive to hire poor people or people with several children as their expenses are higher which is clearly a ridiculous line of thinking."

That sure sounds a lot like Hannity... I guess I'm not really qualified to say if that is or isn't though since I haven't seen or listened to anything by him or anyone on Fox news in over a decade. But really if I'm trying to convince you that both parties are trash and you already believe one of them is trash and I agree that it is trash why would I just circle jerk further saying yup they're trash when my point is that both are terrible. No point continuing to go over ground we agree on so yeah I'll hammer on Dems being bad. But don't get me wrong I have no love for the Republicans."
politics,ffp9tf6,t1_ffp8s0t,1580089740.0,Continuing to demonize republicans doesn't matter to me. It's like I said the sky is blue and grass is green but I like red so I vote for fire and you keep saying yeah but the sky is really evil and grass is super green. You're missing the fucking point. So please keep saying Republicans are bad and I'll keep agreeing with you on that point and I'll keep saying Democrats are also evil and you can keep talking in circles.

Agreed which is why I don't support either party. The GOP is full of corrupt assholes and the Dems are just promising people free shit. Both are wrong for different reasons and so I vote third party. Both are out of control on opposite sides of the spectrum and refuse to find common ground or work with what people actually want. The shitty cop out is picking one party over the other as a lesser of two evils."
politics,ffp5byl,t1_ffp4t5k,1580086581.0,"As I've said elsewhere go ahead and whatabout Trump all you want, I think he's trash too so saying Democrats are the lesser evil is a shitty cop out in my book. As for the executive orders [I'm more worried about the precedent](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fortune.com/2017/01/18/obama-trump-abuse-executive-powers-presidency/amp/) than the number of executive  orders. One executive order creating a dictatorship is much more impactful than hundreds of nearly meaningless ones."
politics,ffp3cea,t1_ffoyggs,1580085455.0,"My point wasn't about number but about the scope of those orders and whether or not Trump passes the number Obama had doesn't change the fact he opened the door for more radical executive power. You're acting like I support Trump which I don't in any way. Whattabout Trump all you want, all I'll do is agree that he's a piece of shit."
politics,fforbhw,t1_ffon58y,1580080792.0,"You're so woke brah... Duh the GOP deceives but so do the Democrats. Both are trash and I would never vote for either because they are dishonest and frankly I refuse to buy into the whole ""lesser of two evils"" bullshit. I'll agree that right now the GOP is getting caught doing more shady shit and being more obvious about their corruption but how are you going to just forget about folks like Blagojevich? How are you going to ignore the DNC fucking over Bernie last election? How are you going to forget how Obama expanded the power of the president through executive orders setting the precedent for the current abuses of power by Trump?"

Libertarian,ffjrq0h,t1_ffjclxm,1580005164.0,Weird so you're saying the value of labor would vary based on factors including availability of labor and the need of labor and the relative cost of goods in an area? It almost sounds like there is no absolute intrinsic value to labor just like any other good or service. Maybe value in all cases is relative and subjective and governed by the laws of supply and demand....

I totally get why a food truck for instance would want to be cashless, seem muh safer. And from the government's perspective a cashless business is more difficult to hide revenue and evade taxes. The places that operate cashless businesses aren't catering to poor people anyway, they're hipster places with younger at least middle class customers. If you're poor maybe you shouldn't be using all your cash to buy $12 avocado toast..."
