Burned it black, to a crisp, had to get it amputated, and never recovered.  What are the chances a man passes out on top of a stove like that?  Or falls over and smashes your head fatally?"

baseball,fgv1a2x,t3_f0ldgd,1581134344.0,"I was up at&t during the tail end of bond's career and a vendor tried to sell me and my friends some giants merch.  One of my friends (she's just a casual Dodgers fan iirc, goes to games for group events but that's about it type of girl) enthusiastically tells him ""Oh no thanks we're Dodgers fans lol!""  He goes from happy charming merchant to furious and offended in a heart beat, points to the exit behind us and growls between clenched teeth, ""You best get out of here right now.  RIGHT NOW! Walk away that's right, you walk away!""

Needless to say we all got a good laugh out of that.  At&t has a spot in my heart."

funny,fghtfa1,t1_fghfkzm,1580793347.0,"It's like our brain jedi mind tricks itself into thinking that we, along with others our age, don't really look that old or look that much different from our youth.  Then we look around and see the actual young people and realize how they look at us, it's exactly like the way we used to look at all the old people in our lives.  This video was particularly weird because half those teachers honestly look like students to me, and they're in a school."

soccer,fghb4ue,t1_fggnd8b,1580780884.0,"Iirc the army tests physical fitness with push ups, sit ups/crunches, and a 2 mile timed run( I don't recall with the minimum time standard is).  Marine recruits test with pull ups/chin ups, sit ups/crunches, and a three mile run.  Minimum run time is 28 minutes ( you could probably power walk that) with 18 minutes being max score. Minimum score for pull ups is 3.  Fucking three freaking pull ups.  And grading sit ups for a physical fitness test is a fucking joke too.  Most overweight kids will get max scores because you can power through them fairly easily.  Bihari baller is absolutely correct, the physical standards for your average marine is a joke. 

Source: ex fatty marine here, if I can do it, just about anyone who actually puts in the effort can do it.

Edit:  apparently they changed it up by grading by category now.  4 pull ups is the minimum for boys 17-20.  But you can opt out of pull ups and do push ups now.  I'm guessing all the fatties go with the push ups."
