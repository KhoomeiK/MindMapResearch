the biggest scam in all of this is elected officials putting it back on you to solve the problem of how much it costs. you elect them to solve it, not the other way around. since value (read: not money, but value) can't be created out of thin air, someone has to pay for something and it's the government's job to clearly lay out the funding implications. there are way too many people in the middle of that who don't need any kind of aid that are acting for their own selfish reasons."
