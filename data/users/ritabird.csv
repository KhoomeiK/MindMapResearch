Assistance,ff663ro,t3_ervqmv,1579620033.0,"Not sure how to do this but..my 26 year old son committed suicide last june
 He shot himself in the head. I found him. I am a hospice nurse and have been unable to work since he died due to severe ptsd and anxiety. I am married. My husband works 2 jobs and we are making it but my water is to be shut off tomorrow and we dont have the funds. I've sold everything I can sell out of my house. This is my last hope."

As an adult, he dealt with substance abuse and multiple psych issues. An aunt of his asked if his problems were because this trauma ""turned him gay"". No. The trauma comes from being violently attacked. He committed suicide last year and I miss him every single minute. Your life has value. You are a VICTIM. Healing can happen but you have to be alive to heal. Please go talk to someone. If u have ppl in your life that notice when you are acting differently,  these people care. Reach out to someone you trust. Please dont take your own life."
