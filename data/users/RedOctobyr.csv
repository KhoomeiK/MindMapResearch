octoprint,ffgtm59,t3_etjpur,1579914740.0,"Which generation is this? I have a Pi 1 (B, I think), I was running Octoprint on that initially. With no additional plugins, it just barely managed to keep up (like 90-95% CPU usage, when I happened to watch), and give decent quality, when printing gcode ""streaming"" through Octoprint (rather than from the SD card). 

Adding a plug-in to show CPU usage made printing slow way down, and would have been poor quality, leaving zits, etc, on the part. So adding a camera would probably make it disastrous. 

But you can have Octoprint running, but print from the SD card (either from the LCD, or initiate the print from SD within Octoprint), and that should help avoid print-quality issues, since Octoprint is no longer streaming gcode on-the-fly. 

I'd give it a shot, it only ""costs"" you putting the Octoprint image on an SD card."

Higher with the electric start (something like 80-90, I think). Runs fine, makes good power. If there's a compression release, I'd be surprised to see 90-100 with a pull-starter, I guess. 

OP, will it run briefly with a spritz of starting fluid, or gas, etc, into the carb's intake? I presume you have spark? 

Also, keep pulling until the compression reading stops climbing. There's no reason to only use a certain number of pulls, you just get a less-accurate reading.  

Eliminate as many adapters & hoses as possible, since any air volume in the adapter and hose will artificially-reduce your compression reading, lower than the engine is really producing. The compressed air also has to fill those volumes, and assuming there's no check-valve at the entrance to the adapter or tube, then that air volume gets compressed, and then vented again, with every cycle. If the engine produced 100 psi, but the adapters & hose doubled the air volume when the piston was at top dead center, then you'd read 50 psi, not 100."

If the zits happen while it's showing high CPU usage, perhaps it's related to getting bogged down, rather than a bad SD card. Reformatting and reinstalling Octoprint should show if it's the card, or a slowed-down Octoprint install. You could also try Safe Mode, to see if it's due to plug-ins.

lawnmowers,febw6yh,t3_envjmt,1578963462.0,"Broadly speaking, at least, brushless motors can be more powerful than brushed motors. They can also last longer, since the only moving parts are the bearings, no brushes to wear down. But I'd imagine the motor lifespan wouldn't be a factor for typical homeowner use. 

The brushless lists a longer runtime, and can use larger 6.2Ah batteries, vs the 5.0Ah max listed for the brushed. The brushless is an 18"" diameter cut, vs 17"", and lists two operating modes, ""ADT"" and low-noise, whatever that means exactly. I would imagine sort of a high-power and low-power mode, perhaps, to maybe help extend the run-time a bit. 

As to whether the differences are worth the price, I guess it depends on your priorities, etc, including what the actual prices are. An extra $200 on top of $300 is one thing, but less-significant if it's $200 on top of $1,000. If you have a larger-size yard, and have the 6.2Ah batteries, that might be a notch in the brushless machine's favor.

BIGTREETECH,fdoydf1,t1_fdowvl9,1578615697.0,"Just realized that I can kind of check mine for you.

Disconnected my power supply, and measured across the XT60 contacts on the leads that go to the board (to the Vin connector). I get basically infinite resistance, as if I wasn't even touching the leads to anything. Now I'm not measuring exactly the same way as you, but it should effectively be the same, IMO.

You shouldn't be getting a measurement that goes through the fuse, it should not connect - to + at the incoming connector. It should be inline with +, most likely, between the connector and the rest of the board. To read the resistance through the fuse, I'd expect you'd need to measure from + to something just past the fuse. But I wouldn't bother trying to do that, I don't think it will tell you much.

I think something is wrong with your board. I'd send them that picture, so there's no confusion on what is being measured, and the reading you're getting. I don't know what the 5V / 3V is, but I think the way you're measuring makes a lot of sense. 

If the fuse is popping, you could look closely for something after the fuse that's shorted. A glob of solder on the back of the board, maybe, something like that. 

If you pull the fuse, what resistance do you measure, across Vin? If the resistance goes to infinite, then you know the connector itself isn't shorted internally, and it's something after the fuse that's shorting to ground (-)."

I usually run around 205C nozzle, and at 60C bed. You can give the bed more time to come up to temperature, if it's still too-cold at the surface, when the print starts. The glass beds take a little longer for the heat to soak through.

Even overclocked from 700MHz to 1000MHz, it was very close to CPU-limited with a detailed test model (often seeing \~95% CPU). And when adding the Resource Monitor or DisplayLayerProgress plugins, it would be CPU limited, and print times increased dramatically (like doubled). 

My Pi 4 is very different, fortunately, and has not exhibited any slowdowns yet, comparing printing from SD, to streaming using Octoprint."

There's a command that will report an under-voltage power supply situation. I connected to it via Putty, then ran ""vcgencmd get\_throttled"" (after running a CPU stress test, to increase the draw). If it reports ""throttled=0x0"", then you're in good shape. 

Other results indicate what problem you're running into. I found info here:

I'm using the 3A 5V power supply that came with my case, with no problems so far. I have not tried it with a phone charger. For $12, I'm liking this fan-equipped case & power supply, I haven't had power issues while running a 15-minute CPU stress test, and with the fan on low-speed (running at 3V, not 5V), the highest temperature I saw was 59C. Granted, the house is cool, since it's winter. The fan is essentially silent at this speed.

smallengines,fd2f51n,t3_ejvbrl,1578146318.0,"I'd expect a stuck valve to stick open, not closed, giving you too-little compression. If you remove the spark plug when this happens, does is it then become easy to pull?

Does gas come spraying out of the plug hole when you remove the plug and pull the cord, after it's difficult to pull? If your carb's float valve is leaking, it's possible it could be letting gas leak into the cylinder while the engine is just sitting. This would cause a similar hydrolocking situation. The band-aid fix would be to add a fuel shutoff valve, and close it between uses. The better solution would be to fix the float/needle valve problem in the carb. This is also bad if it lets gas into the oil, since it won't lubricate as well, and can cause engine damage. Does the oil smell like gas?

Is it a flathead or OHV engine? If your valve clearances are wrong (too large) the compression release may not be working properly. I'd expect that to be consistent every time, admittedly, but it's still possible, I suppose.

It's tough to imagine the troublesome oil staying in there somehow, after getting it running again for a few seasons. Change the oil if you want, but I think that filling with gas/Seafoam is not necessary, and may just introduce other potential problems."

Shortening the tube would reduce the pressure-drop of the air, through the tube. Giving a bit more pressure to the projectile. 

Now, how do we hook this up to a compressor.... 

I do actually have a refillable aerosol can, so you can make your own sprays from a liquid you provide. It refills with a pump or compressor. Could be a refillable source for using something like this, though it probably puts out less volume of air than a canned-air setup. And since each launch is just a brief blast of air, a can would probably give quite a number of launches."

Remove the stepper & extruder from the hot end, for instance. Or maybe remove the nozzle, so you're just extruding through an open hole. Something to help understand if there's some sort of restriction/slippage issue that's responsible.
