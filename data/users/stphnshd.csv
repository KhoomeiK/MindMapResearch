TrueOffMyChest,fekq2pl,t3_epm185,1579205259.0,"Be careful OP. I was a cashier when I was 18 and everytime you scan something, a red light does a tiny flash where you scan the item. If you put the item over the scanner and the red light doesn't flash, security will know you didn't scan it. Also there is a camera directly over the scanner for this very reason."

I have a lot of friends who have competed in bodybuilding and this is basically the ""bulking"" phase, where they eat in a surplus to gain a bunch of muscle (and fat).
