Economics,fez5z7s,t1_feymw4s,1579454121.0,"I reserve judgement until I see a metric that looks at a broader, full-life perspective. If someone was lowest-quintile briefly as a kid and then made it into the top quintile as an adult, that doesn't say much about mobility. In general, high variance makes any snapshot metric less than illuminating. Even if you are temporarily poor in nominal assets,  superior education and social capital are subject to less time-variance and are a big hidden asset that affects long-term outcomes."
Economics,fez2vq2,t1_feyh0w9,1579453364.0,"Guy sounds like a real jerk. He comes in with the mindset that some students are inherently more worthy and capable rather than the proper mindset for an educator: all the students in the class are capable of succeeding and any who don't are at least partially a personal failure on his part. Obviously that isn't always going to be true, but any other mindset results in an inferior educator and someone I wouldn't want to be around."
videos,fes8ksw,t1_fes6k1m,1579362569.0,"If one takes everything about one's situation and environment for granted and can't see cause and effect, with a healthy dose of racism, then one can assume that there is something inherent and inevitable about one's circumstances, due to one's character and/or genetics.

This enables one too look down on others in different circumstances (since they are inferior as evidenced by their outcomes). One can go further and advocate removing any perceived negatives from one's own life since one is too blinded or ignorant to see how the system holds together.

I think clock makers really illustrate the point. They were making the most intricate, complex things 400 years ago. But no amount of raw intellect will guide you to mix 5 random, variously-processed ingredients in a certain way for a certain time at a certain temperature and humidity to get a higher-strength steel. That's untold centuries of trial and error guided by a little experience and instinct. Even now things like baking composites has a large element of trial and error."

Someone moving faster than walking speed through a crosswalk must be aware of traffic.

I walk across a particularly dangerous intersection daily on my commute and at walking speed I still have to save my own life from oblivious right and left turners."
Economics,fe2yayk,t1_fe2t4xj,1578844197.0,You seem to have the implicit assumption that productivity and wages have a strong correlation. I'm not certain that's true. Wages are a price. Prices are subject to supply and demand. If you have a long value chain where the work of the entire chain is scuttled if any link is missing then a rare but mediocre skill can be vastly overpaid relative to its inherent productivity.
programming,fdzy667,t1_fdzwm75,1578798683.0,I think it's often more about factoring out similar machinery in different subsystems despite the subsystems having different environments and requirements. If those change you can find that the similarities were incidental and now the factored-out library/methods would become horrible messes to continue to support the independently varying clients. Since people defer to existing code structure those common methods often do become awful before someone takes a fresh look and breaks up the coupling.

Given that cars are probably only 15-20% efficient at turning the fuel's potential energy into work against wind resistance and tire rolling resistance (both of which are hard to avoid) that means that a perfect engine and drive train could go a mile on about 140-190 kcal, which is pretty good given its weight and the effect that weight has on rolling resistance."

Temporary incarceration for a duration based on a formula related to income bracket vs loan amount would disincentivize going to schools that are too high quality and expensive for your financial resources and expected future salary.

programming,fc5a8yd,t1_fc4h3x2,1577450786.0,"The structure can be defined by a negative, but I think that is still enlightening: it's everything that isn't tied to the domain and exterior functional requirements.

Some parts of any system will have single classes and methods whose behaviors are directly tied to such requirements. I call these ""calculator classes."" Unit tests are often easy and fun to write for such classes. An example would be a tax calculator or an RPC input validator.

Other parts of the code are only correct or incorrect from an external perspective when you look at emergent behaviors of many of such classes working together. I call these ""mediator classes."" Examples are message pipelines or DI modules. Don't write unit tests for these classes. Such tests are hard to write and constrain your system in arbitrary ways that are not tied to external requirements, which is a bad thing.

Design your system so that as much as possible is tied to external requirements and so that the parts that are not (along with the calculators they use) form modules with relatively well-defined boundaries. That makes for a testable system. Write functional (and/or non-e2e integration) tests at these boundaries.

Microservices are one attempt at modularizing a system into hard boundaries with unit sizes that are amenable to functional testing., This is because engineers treat RPC boundaries as hard out of necessity: when units of code are deployed at heterogenous versions you had better have backward compatibility and feature launch management. In this light microservices are a commitment device for hard boundaries, but they risk putting the cart before the horse, and at great expense. You can have seams in a system without such a boundary too if you don't need the other benefits of microservices. It does require discipline though."
