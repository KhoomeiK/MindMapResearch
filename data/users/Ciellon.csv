todayilearned,ffk58h3,t1_ffk45un,1580016271.0,"Oh, believe me, I know. Deer are frequently called 'rats with hooves' where I'm from. They're everywhere and they just wreck up everything. We're still paying for the sins of our forefathers so to speak, in that our grandparents hunted all the predators out so now the deer can overpopulate the shit out of everywhere. There have been a couple of seasons where there hasn't been a limit on tags. But even then you can't just get rid of them all down to a 'healthy level' indiscriminately - that has repurcussions too.

As for the floodlights, it's the same reason as to why Theodore Roosevelt wouldn't shoot the bear that was tied up for him - because it wasn't fair to the bear. If you're going to best one of mother nature's creatures, it should be on mother nature's terms.

And I agree with the gun shots. It's why I hunt with a bow. Guns are too loud."
todayilearned,ffk4smt,t1_ffk4b82,1580015857.0,"This is true, but natural predators have other advantages we don't - things like smell, hearing, and sight. We don't have these things nearly as good as animals; it's the reason why we evolved to make tools like bows and guns. And it's always about safety. During season there are plenty of hunters out and about, so the risk is always there, but it's even greater at night because you can't actually see, which is why it's forbidden.

It being hard is part of why it's hunting. It's not the same as bringing domesticated animals to slaughter. Floodlights aren't a part of a deer's natural habitat. It's supposed to be as uninstrusive as possible on the environment and the habitat for the animal."
todayilearned,ffk4fbb,t1_ffk3lwj,1580015513.0,"I know. I feel it always works better in these kinds of situations to use just facts. It helps keep the discussion from becoming emotionally charged. You're right with the guns, but I the trade-off is their accuracy and minimalistic impact on the animal in question. Everything is a trade-off with hunting. Even with spears and whatnot. My dad hunted boar with a spear once - the potential for maiming the animal was offset by the fact that boar can kill people fairly easily. I think that's how Fish & Wildlife decides these things, personally. But don't quote me on that because I've never worked for them."
todayilearned,ffk41x8,t1_ffk3cp6,1580015172.0,"Yes, but you're not supposed to be hunting at *night*, regardless of how lit it is. Again for safety's sake.

And it's not about what's ethical for the deer, it's about what's ethical for us, as people. We're the apex predator on this planet and we already have an extreme advantage against the deer, especially in this day and age."
todayilearned,ffk3pzx,t1_ffk2ysx,1580014870.0,"I dunno, it feels... baser? More simple? I don't know how quite to phrase it. It's more work, but less mentally taxing. Nature is beautiful, and things being killed is a part of it. If it's not me, it's a mountain lion, or even sometimes nature itself. I personally don't need the meat to survive - I go to the grocery store like everyone else, or to the orchards and pick my own strawberries - but that doesn't mean I don't use it. I keep it and store it and eat it over the course of a year or two. 

I consider myself an outdoorsman. Nature is beautiful and amazing and I love it. I love mankind and all the things it has accomplished too. The world is cool."
todayilearned,ffk3e1v,t1_ffk29nl,1580014575.0,"I can't speak for others, but I personally don't get satisfaction from harvesting a deer. I get satisfaction from being out in nature and helping nature to be healthy and for the ecosystem to continue on in a healthy manner. I thank nature that it has blessed me with the deer and do my diligence to use as much of it as possible.

And you can hunt with a spear, in some cases."
todayilearned,ffk35np,t1_ffk2380,1580014370.0,"You can't compare deer to people. Deer don't build houses. They don't sleep in beds, or go to work, or have higher base levels of thoughts. They're animals. They fuck to reproduce and survive as long as they can to do it again until they're eaten or their bodies give out.

In order to spotlight it has to be dark, which you're not supposed to be hunting in. It's not safe. You can't properly identify what you're shooting at, or see what's behind it. And the reason why it's unethical is because you're exploiting a baser response from the creature and using it to your advantage. That's not ethical. Deer will freeze to try to identify what the hell is up before fleeing. In that moment you're using this to your advantage, which isn't fair to the deer."
todayilearned,ffk2k1b,t1_ffk1ri6,1580013840.0,"Oh, you're right, I completely forgot about that. I've never done it, so i unintentionally ignored it, my bad.

And it's not really an urge. It's just nice to be way back in the middle of nowhere, typically alone, probably being the first person to ever step in the spot you're in now. No humming of the city. Just pure, unadulterated nature.

I still remember when I hid in a thicket of tall grass, holding my breath, trying my damnedest not to move. A little Bambi was curious as hell and came up sniffing and blinking trying to figure out what was in the thicket. It was amazing, I could see the texture of its nose. It was traveling with its mama, off to who-knows-where. Ended up not harvesting a deer that year, but it was worth it for that experience alone.

Also the separate experience where a raccoon scared the absolute shit out of me. 

That's what I mean by spiritual. I'm not a God-believing man, but shit like that makes me feel a little closer to *something*."
todayilearned,ffk1ul5,t1_ffk1nt2,1580013235.0,"I doubt anyone could do that, and definitely not with a machete. Deer have thick necks. Even thicker for larger game like elk."
todayilearned,ffk1j22,t1_ffjrgax,1580012960.0,"Well, yes, but that doesn't really explain *why* it's bad."
todayilearned,ffk1g4d,t1_ffj7tpx,1580012888.0,Using a machete would cause great harm and take far too long to the animal. Bullets are precise and minimalistic. A well-placed shot to the heart most of the time drops an animal instantly. Most of the time before they've even heard the shot. It's more humane.
todayilearned,ffk1b6e,t1_ffjkkok,1580012771.0,"You're missing a key point in that if you're spotlighting, you're doing it to force an advantage - to force the deer into a position to be killed. Therein already lies the problem: *it's not in a position to be killed unless you spotlight it.* Hunting is a sport of skill and experience. It's a very personal and almost spiritual experience. You practice with your bow or you sight your gun and build skill and familiarity. You study the biology of the animal to determine which is the best place to aim. Your goal is to harvest the animal as quickly and painlessly as possible. You're not supposed to take a shot you know you can't hit. If the deer never gets into a position for you to take your shot, then tough luck. You watch it walk away. That's why it's called hunting and not catching."
todayilearned,ffk0py4,t1_ffiyq2t,1580012260.0,"Because the whole point is to keep it as close to spartan as possible. It's supposed to be between you and the animal. Sure, we have guns and I've seen guys go ham on the ballistic calculations and shit, but the point is that a Hunter is relying on his or her skill to harvest the animal. Not cheap gimmicks. It's unethical. If you aren't in a situation to be able to quickly and as painlessly as possible harvest the animal, then you shouldn't make the shot. Period. And if you do chuff it, then you track it down and put it out of the misery *you caused* because it's the right thing to do."
