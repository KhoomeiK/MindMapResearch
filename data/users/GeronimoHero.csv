netsec,ffoc1jm,t1_ffo5b5s,1580076102.0,"I think it’s been pretty obvious to anyone watching that Intel scrapped any semblance of security for absolute performance. AMD by all accounts, seem to have taken a more balanced approach that’s paying off in the security arena."

homeautomation,ffnulha,t1_ffniear,1580071040.0,"They’re punishing you for not providing location data. Straight up, it seems like they’re saying, if you want to use this feature the price is your location information 24/7/365. That’s not right when you’ve already purchased the product. There’s no reason why they need location data for all of that time."

linux,ffmhxm7,t1_ffmfyjz,1580054917.0,Notepad is a GUI program and how is nano any better than ViM? It’s way less featured and uses similar command arguments inside of a TUI. I’m failing to see how it’s legitimately better other than you just prefer nano.
linux,ffmhp2e,t1_ffmaopx,1580054776.0,"Plenty of servers are like this. Generally you only keep the programs and utilities on a server that you know are going to be used, in order to lower attack surface. It’s very common to only have one editor or one way to do any particular thing. Unneeded programs shouldn’t be left on s server. To that end, no, most of the servers I’ve worked on don’t choose Nano to be there editor. It’s almost always ViM or Emacs."
