MGTOW,fcqez6j,t1_fcqedtm,1577884692.0,Sure Did. And I like you could careless what you think of me or my opinion. Looks like you wandered off the herd yourself to give your opinion.  At least I can own the fact that I will never be perfect. Can you ????
MGTOW,fcqcd4v,t3_eii0zc,1577883213.0,Being a woman so I'm  wondering if you are you all of this. Just want to know. Can you live up to all of these things or do you too fall short. Defending being one of those women that definitely falls short of most men but not  men's expectations. I can say. I do most things for myself. Once I realized that men but then again not all men but those men  that   help broken women are expecting something sexual in return I stopped accepting stuff. Because I wasn't willing to do that.  That was a hard but yet much needed lesson to learn. Because I never was willing to give someone what he thought I should give.  Still learning about love and relationships and stuff . But I'm owning the fact that I Am IMPERFECT AND WILL NEVER BE PERFECT. GOOD LUCK FINDING PERFECT

survivinginfidelity,fcq9hy0,t1_fcq7tmi,1577881562.0,Did she tell you why. . I'm glad she owned all that hurt you. A lot times people don't say why they do the things they do. And want to be labeled as innocent. No one is perfect. My opinion best advice do you. And if you want to leave and find someone else.  Make sure you heal first or so I was told to feel the pain embrace this way it's no longer broken relationships. But even then sometimes the love is different . We are human and need realize no one is perfect including the ones that think they are Do you.
survivinginfidelity,fcq72vs,t3_eihjs6,1577880132.0,Did you disclose how she cheated did you see it with your eyes. Or was it someone elses lies. Was it through some form of revenge well then you might not tell her then because then she would look at you differently because you weren't true . So does she know I think thats fair to give herbthe evidence you have against her so she can defend herself even if you contemplated revenge with a friends you call your bros. And maybe she does want you to be happy and find someone whom will love you the most. People now a days. Need to tell the truth about what they do. Take Accountability for their actions and own their wrongs. Despite what we don't want anyone to know instead of going ghost. My opinion of course.
love,fcq5d61,t3_eihicb,1577879076.0,"Unless she's dead. Then you can text, call send a message for a friend. Maybe she wants to know the same thing two. Its Ego and Pride and sometimes fear that keeps us from knowing how people we care for, love are. Someone taught me this. Took alot for me to reach out got a response despite nothing else said. At least I know this person was alive despite what I read through a text. Good luck"

BreakUps,fcj7rlw,t3_ehgwu7,1577679397.0,"I'm with you a 100 percent on social media break. I'm hoping. Today will be the last day I get on here as much only reason I do. Is because mostly I write about someone I love , someone I hold close . Hoping I find something magical . its been awhile. In regards to your ex. I hope you fight for your love. But if you need a break let them know why. I wish you the. Best huggs"
Advice,fcic706,t3_ehbb4k,1577660398.0,"Maybe she couldn't like how old we're her kids. Dis they have special needs. Did you communicate the fact that you felt unwanted, unloved. Maybe she didn't want to but her personal burdens on you.  Like most girls now want commitment, bad not wholesome pics and money. My best advice knowing a woman like the one you mentioned above. Its not that she doesn't want to. But in having kids anything can change from one minute to another. She probably doesn't even have time to the things in life. Because she's still probably rebuilding planning the next. Hoping that it goes ok. If the other woman intrigued you and took her place because you failed to express yourself and comprehend that being a single mom can be hard. Then let this woman be. The last thing she needs is someone to break her heart. . Like life's already hard. And she is probably tired. Maybe desires a massage. Good luck."

AskReddit,fc3z1zx,t3_eg2mpl,1577402327.0,That it's ok to be tired to break sometimes to even cry for 90 % of is most made up water. That percentage might not be right . But it's something like that.  That all of this is ok. As long as you get up and try try again. Especially after you spent most of the last days either in the ER with one and if not  both of your kids there but on different days. We are human and we break beautifully. My opinion of course. Now to rest thanks for asking.
