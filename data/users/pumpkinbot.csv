RantsFromRetail,ffdq1st,t1_ffdpccg,1579826222.0,"Yeahp. I tell them either ""Yeah, probably. Means either I get a job servicing these machines, I get moved to a different department, or I find a better paying job,"" or I tell them ""When the wheel was first invented, there was probably someone that was upset because it was their job to carry carts. Doesn't mean we shouldn't have done it."""
smashbros,ffccqno,t1_ffc867n,1579796635.0,"Yeah, I could see that. We'd have to draw the line eventually, though. What about a Warcraft character to celebrate the MMO that brought the genre into the mainstream? Heck, sports games have a fanbase, should we add one of them in?

I'm not sure where the line should be drawn, personally. I see Warcraft as a huge franchise, with WoW being an important milestone in MMOs, but it'd just feel weird seeing, for example, Thrall or Sylvanas in Smash Bros. There's probably no good answer, but Nintendo seems to know what they're doing ~~apart from adding in more and more swordbois.~~"

smashbros,ff9qjat,t1_ff9q0p5,1579718766.0,"He's still definitely got enough personality, imo. He's a cheater, and blames everyone but himself if he loses. Really narcissistic and full of himself, but he's honestly a complete loser.

But yeah, it is true he's rarely seen outside of party games. :("
