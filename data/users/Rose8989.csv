If something happens to children who were intentionally placed with parents that have a history of abuse and negelet, that's opening the grandparents up to negligence charges, for the same reason you can't intentionally place them in any dangerous environment.

Even if there is a accommodation, if it would pose a undue burden of the employer, they don't have to accommodate.

In the 9th circuit Court, in DEBORAH A.  ROBINSON, v. STATE OF FLORIDA,  DEPARTMENT OF HIGHWAY SAFETY AND MOTOR  VEHICLES,

Subsections  92.525(1), (2), and (4), Florida  Statutes  (2011), address  the  verification of documents  and  perjury  by  false  written  declaration,  as  follows: 

(1)  When it  is  authorized or  required by  law, by  rule  of  an administrative agency,  or  by  rule  or  order  of  court  that  a  document  be  verified by  a  person, the verification  may  be  accomplished  in  the  following  manner: (a)  Under  oath or  affirmation taken or  administered before  an officer authorized under  s. 92.50  to administer  oaths;  or   (b)  By the  signing  of  the  written declaration prescribed in subsection (2). [Emphasis  added] (2)  A  written  declaration  means  the  following  statement: Under  penalties  of perjury,  I  declare that  I  have read  the foregoing  [document]  and  that  the facts stated in it  are  true,  followed by  the  signature  of  the  person making  the declaration, except  when a  verification on information  or  belief  is  permitted  by law,  in  which  case the  words  to  the best  of  my  knowledge  and  belief  may  be added. The  written declaration shall  be  printed or  typed at  the  end  of  or immediately  below  the  document  being  verified  and above  the  signature  of  the person making  the  declaration. (4)  As used in this  section: (a)  The  term  administrative agency  means  any  department  or  agency of  the  state  or  any  county,  municipality,  special district,  or  other  political subdivision. (b)  The term  document means  any  writing  including,  without limitation, any  form, application, claim, notice,  tax  return, inventory,  affidavit, pleading, or  paper. (c)  The  requirement  that  a document  be verified  means  that  the document  must  be  signed or  executed by  a  person and that  the  person must  state under  oath or  affirm  that  the  facts  or  matters  stated or  recited in the  document  are true, or  words  of  that  import  or  effect. Accordingly, from  a  plain reading  of  the  statute,  in order  to be  valid,  the  Affidavits  at issue  could be  either:  a)  sworn to under  oath  or  affirmation before  an  officer  authorized to administer  oaths;  or  b)  be  in  the  form of  a  written  declaration  containing  the  written  language  set forth  in  the  statute.   Therefore,  an affidavit  does  not  need to comply  with both  subsections  (2)(a) and  (b)  of  the  statute  in order  to be  valid.   Only  compliance  with one  subsection is  required."

They can run a NCIC check on the VIN, which would be the most accurate way to determine if the vehicle is stolen or has other tickets attached to it.

Let's just say I get a referral to see a surgeon, who then orders an MRI, then books me for a surgery that will cost 20,000 dollars. I also need a 300 dollar wheelchair under my durable medical equipment benefit. 

My costs for a specialist are a 75 dollar copay. 

My costs for a MRI and surgery include a deductible of 750 and a co-insurance of 20%. 

My out of pocket max is 3,000 for the plan year. 

So I pay 75 for the doctor. That leaves 2,925 on my out of pocket max. Deductible not affected. 

I pay 500 for the MRI. That leaves 2,425 on my out of pocket max. Coinsurance hasn't come into play yet because I haven't met my deductible. 

I purchase that 300 dollar wheelchair that's subject to deductible and coinsurance. 

750-500=215 Dollars left of my deductible to meet after that MRI. So that wheelchair is going to cost me 

300 dollar cost minus 215 deductible, with 85 dollars left over. I pay a 20 percent co insurance,  while  insurance covers 80% which is 17 dollars for my portion. 

So 215+17= 232 dollars for the wheel chair out of my pocket, with 2,193 left on my out of pocket max. 

So now it's surgery time.  I have met my deductible by now, so I only owe a co-insurance of 20%. On a surgery that cost 20,000, I owe 20% of that, which comes out to 4,000. So I pay the remaining $2,193 of my max out of pocket cost and insurance covers the rest at 100%. 

Any additional costs until the end of the plan year that come up are now paid 100% by insurance, as I've met my deductible and out-of-pocket Max for the year."

There are some ways to go about this. 

You can start the mortgage process and get a appraisal done of the property. Sell the property to the ex for the lowest end of the value range it appraises for. That should help them with the down payment. A FHA loan will need a 5 percent down payment, and a good chunk of the closing cost can be rolled into the loan. You can also assist him with them. Depending on the location of the property, if it's in a rural area, he may also qualify for a USDA loan, with as little as 1 percent down. 

The other option is to get a attorney to assist you with a ""rent to own"" mortgage. That's where the ex pays rent to you, with a portion of the rent going towards a down payment on a loan.

In the 9th circuit Court, in DEBORAH A.  ROBINSON, v. STATE OF FLORIDA,  DEPARTMENT OF HIGHWAY SAFETY AND MOTOR  VEHICLES, 

The court wrote 

Subsections  92.525(1), (2), and (4), Florida  Statutes  (2011), address  the  verification of documents  and  perjury  by  false  written  declaration,  as  follows: 

(1)  When it  is  authorized or  required by  law, by  rule  of  an administrative agency,  or  by  rule  or  order  of  court  that  a  document  be  verified by  a  person, the verification  may  be  accomplished  in  the  following  manner: (a)  Under  oath or  affirmation taken or  administered before  an officer authorized under  s. 92.50  to administer  oaths;  or   (b)  By the  signing  of  the  written declaration prescribed in subsection (2). [Emphasis  added] (2)  A  written  declaration  means  the  following  statement: “Under  penalties  of perjury,  I  declare that  I  have read  the foregoing  [document]  and  that  the facts stated in it  are  true,”  followed by  the  signature  of  the  person making  the declaration, except  when a  verification on information  or  belief  is  permitted  by law,  in  which  case the  words  “to  the best  of  my  knowledge  and  belief”  may  be added. The  written declaration shall  be  printed or  typed at  the  end  of  or immediately  below  the  document  being  verified  and above  the  signature  of  the person making  the  declaration. (4)  As used in this  section: (a)  The  term  “administrative agency”  means  any  department  or  agency of  the  state  or  any  county,  municipality,  special district,  or  other  political subdivision. (b)  The term  “document” means  any  writing  including,  without limitation, any  form, application, claim, notice,  tax  return, inventory,  affidavit, pleading, or  paper. (c)  The  requirement  that  a document  be verified  means  that  the document  must  be  signed or  executed by  a  person and that  the  person must  state under  oath or  affirm  that  the  facts  or  matters  stated or  recited in the  document  are true, or  words  of  that  import  or  effect. Accordingly, from  a  plain reading  of  the  statute,  in order  to be  valid,  the  Affidavits  at issue  could be  either:  a)  sworn to under  oath  or  affirmation before  an  officer  authorized to administer  oaths;  or  b)  be  in  the  form of  a  written  declaration  containing  the  written  language  set forth  in  the  statute.   Therefore,  an affidavit  does  not  need to comply  with both  subsections  (2)(a) and  (b)  of  the  statute  in order  to be  valid.   Only  compliance  with one  subsection is  required."

The way the HOA is set up, community fees pay for water, trash, common area electric and landscaping. Dissolving the HOA isn't really an option unless myself and my neighbors want to go without those services. 

Depending on how OP townhouse is built, going without without a HOA may not be feasible without shutting down vital basic services.

OP, I would see what exactly your CCNRS cover, and how the board is structured. It's likely all volunteer too. I would get quotes from a management company.

I would call the local police department, and advise them that you suspect that you have inadvertently purchased a stolen vehicle. They can run a NCIC check on the VIN, which would be the most accurate way to determine if the vehicle is stolen or has other tickets attached to it. And it would help the worse case scenario, you being arrested and accused of being in possession of a stolen vehicle. Proactively going to the police demonstrates  lack of intent to steal. 
 

If the vehicle is not stolen, you can proceed through the process of making the vehicle legal again. 

If the vehicle is stolen, expect to have the car impounded. You will have to take the owner to court to get your money back, but that would be a much more preferable option then going through the motions to pay the ticket, registration fees, then get the car towed if it gets pulled over one day."

Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.

**Petty slights, annoyances, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not rise to the level of illegality. **

Punching someone in the face at work for snatching a paper out of your hand, even if it's a W-2, is a response way out of proportion to the offense.

A complaint to HR and a credit freeze would have been the appropriate response. 

And a co-worker playing keep-away like he is a third grader is going to be hard to articulate as being more than a petty slight or annoyance."

1) As the old adage goes ""A lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client."" The mere fact you have to ask a lot of these questions should clue you in that you shouldn't be pro-per.  

2) The video evidence exists, it's just not in your favor. Perception of events, and reality, are two different things. Just because cameras were present, doesn't mean those cameras were working, or if they did, captured the angles that would vindicate you. If your motion for Brady disclosure didn't yield the video you thought existed, firing your attorney isn't going to make it magically appear. Your attorney has the expertise to dispose the staff that pulled the video, and potentially the resources such as private investigators that can go to the hospital in person inspect the equipment and verify the camera angles available. 

3) Standing still has nothing to do with your behavior in court. If a judge tells you to shut up, you shut up. if a judge tells you to stop a specific line of questioning because it's out of the rules of criminal procedure, you do it. You don't have the expertise to know if your questions are inadmissible or if evidence is not allowed to be admitted. That's what the lawyer is for. Refusing to obey the judges directions get you kicked out of the courtroom. If your judge is wrong, that's what appeals are for. 

4) If your best defense is that every single cop, the hospital, and the prosecutor are conspiring against you, you might as well plead guilty now. Unless you can articulate why exactly they would do that to you, and how they did it, all that's going to do is cause you to come across as someone who is grasping at straws, or worse, someone who is mentally ill with delusions of persecution.

Let's just say I get a referral to see a surgeon, who then orders an MRI, then books me for a surgery that will cost 20,000 dollars. I also need a 300 dollar wheelchair under my durable medical equipment benefit. 

My costs for a specialist are a 75 dollar copay. 

My costs for a MRI and surgery include a deductible of 750 and a co-insurance of 20%. 

My out of pocket max is 3,000 for the plan year. 

So I pay 75 for the doctor. That leaves 2,925 on my out of pocket max. Deductible not affected. 

I pay 500 for the MRI. That leaves 2,425 on my out of pocket max. Coinsurance hasn't come into play yet because I haven't met my deductible. 

I purchase that 300 dollar wheelchair that's subject to deductible and coinsurance. 

750-500=215 Dollars left of my deductible to meet after that MRI. So that wheelchair is going to cost me 

300 dollar cost minus 215 deductible, with 85 dollars left over. I pay a 20 percent co insurance,  while  insurance covers 80% which is 17 dollars for my portion. 

So 215+17= 232 dollars for the wheel chair out of my pocket, with 2,193 left on my out of pocket max. 

So now it's surgery time.  I have met my deductible by now, so I only owe a co-insurance of 20%. On a surgery that cost 20,000, I owe 20% of that, which comes out to 4,000. So I pay the remaining $2,193 of my max out of pocket cost and insurance covers the rest at 100%. 

Any additional costs until the end of the plan year that come up are now paid 100% by insurance, as I've met my deductible and out-of-pocket Max for the year."

You can start the mortgage process and get a appraisal done of the property. Sell the property to the ex for the lowest end of the value range it appraises for.

B) File a pro se motion, using the case number from the court, to request that the bond be exonerated. it doesn't have to be super fancy, but most courts require that the other party be served too, so normally that requires a certified mail signature receipt copy be sent to the prosecutor's office.

if these are ACH transactions, shutting down your card is not good enough. you're going to have to open a new checking account.

whether they're debit or ACH transactions, file a fraud affidavit for each and every one of them. you should be able to get your money back eventually, maybe even immediately, depending on your bank's policies.

you're also going to need to file a police report to go along with the fraud affidavit.

and, if the title of your post to serious, contact the National suicide helpline at 1 (800) 273-8255

At the time your arrested, your purse has to be searched for weapons, and it's contents inventoried. If the purse was seen by the cop in your possession or within your span of control inside the car, its contents are yours. whether or not you've ever seen them before.

but just like every unsecured debt, they can send someone to court for a civil judgement on the balance between what they receive at auction and what is due.  

from there, the car dealership can request a lien on home property, other vehicles, and any other titled property, which must be satisfied before the property can be sold or transferred. they can also request a writ of garnishment for any bank accounts and wages to satisfy the debt. but if they go that route they must release the lien once the debt is satisfied."

Which doesn't sound like much, but the rib cage is designed to absorb a lot of pressure without damaging internal organs. You practically have to break ribs to do it right. it's absolutely recommended that you switch off after 2-3 Cycles while breaths are being given, if it is possible because as you tire, it becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible,to compress the chest to the correct depth, making CPR ineffective to useless. Blood just is not going to profuse the brain and other vital organs if your too tired or weak to compress the chest with enough force.

I was taught that using money for sympathy, attention, or bragging rights is crass, and demeans your self value."
