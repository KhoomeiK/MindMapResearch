pancreaticcancer,fgqoose,t3_ezz5el,1581028289.0,"If they think they can get the tumor, they would be looking at a Whipple.  That would remove the gall bladder and part of the pancreas.  That took away my wife’s sharp pain.

The stuff around the artery is concerning.  Of course the issue whether it’s spread.  They might skip the Whipple and go to chemo.  They will eventually want to get to check some lymph nodes to see where it is.

The whole process is a whirlwind.  And not a good one.  So, do as much reading as you can BUT, do not read anything MORE than a year old.  This one of those cases where the treatment literally has changed in the past 18 months.  It’s all dark, but you WANT to know, so you can help.  Listen to the nurses:  during the process, I’ve learned more treatment stuff from the nursing staff.  I love the docs, but their role is different.

In the meantime you can go on Amazon and try Pancreatine.  It is a natural version of the enzyme.  Three before each meal has helped.  It’s not harmful, it’s OTC, and it’s cheap.

Our experience is about a year head of you.  I wish I could tell you it’s going to get better.  Feel free to drop me a private message if you have any questions.  You don’t always have to be strong.

Restate the others position to confirm understanding.  “So, what you are saying is,,,,”.
