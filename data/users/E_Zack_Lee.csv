However, the questions from the moderators to Bernie were structured to make him look bad. CNN did an absolutely horrible job. Wolfe needs to retire... and maybe take Biden along with him. And I have no idea the purpose of the brunette from the local newspaper. Her questions and attitude were so sophomoric.  And what is this media generated frenzy about Bernie telling Warren she cannot win the presidential election?  Bernie has been marching with women for decades, quoted as early as 1988 saying a woman can be president  ... about 20 years before Warren switched from being a republican, mind you lol. The smear campaign stuff is just shameful, mainly driven by the media."

Simply, Hunter got the job because his dad was VP. When Biden is questioned about this on the stump, he becomes defensive and hostile and never answers the question. For me, this is the main reason (among many) why I canâ€™t support him. 

EDIT:  I find the down votes so typical, and expected. No one wants to address the issue, answer the question:  Why would Biden allow his son to be in such a compromising position?"
