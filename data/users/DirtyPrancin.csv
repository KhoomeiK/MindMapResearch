Economics,ffyoi89,t1_ffxnqlo,1580351313.0,Yes all the numbers from China are a lie. All 1.4b people in China really know what's going on because the truth is written in Chinese in their newspapers so that they can run businesses and thrive in life but they write a whole different set of numbers in English to trick the stupid Americans. No one in America can read Chinese newspapers so no one will ever know the truth. All 1.4b Chinese people know they are conspiring to trick the stupid Americans so they know not to tell anyone other than Chinese people. All the Chinese people studying at US Universities? Actors. Staged like the Truman show just to trick us into thinking they aren't conspiring against us. No one even knows if China really exists.

First, it costs the country almost $80b per year in incarceration costs and loss of productivity.

Second, it puts pressure on people to take plea agreements even when they may not have committed a crime, as awaiting trial while in jail can impose a longer incarceration period than the plea deal. The unconvicted jail population is two to three times the size of the convicted population.

Third, bail determinations are highly subjective, with individuals receiving vastly different bail amounts for similar crimes.

Finally, the inability to pay cash bail obviously falls more frequently on those with lower levels of income. This often results in them losing their jobs, causing immediate economic distress. This is another pressure towards accepting plea deals, as well as causing a long-term poverty cycle which can rob them of future opportunities.

States that have reformed their bail systems to minimize cash bail have seen very high levels of trial attendance with very low levels of crime by those released while awaiting trial. We should be much more judicious in the use of cash bail, only employing it when necessary.

If there was a higher than normal flu outbreak, it would still be scary to know people are about to flood shopping stores, trains, and Planes right before Christmas. Lunar New Year's is an even bigger deal in China than Christmas in the US. So the urgency has a lot to do with timing rather than the severity of the virus."

Right now in the US a public option is needed to bring down price but the end goal is once the prices are manageable, we should move to a private system. When the payer of a service is not the same person as the receiver of the service, you get sloppiness, and malpractice. There is no capitalism that eliminates the incompetent hospitals. They get paid no matter what. Either by the gov or the insurance companies. 

If you go to a resturaunt and the food sucks and makes you sick, you never go again. Eventually the resturaunt is out of business and can't make others sick anymore. Contrast with the DMV which is not punished for being slow and incompetent and you get 80% of DMVs that are a complete mess. Incompetent hospitals are not punished for preventable contamination cases. Imagine if a resturaunt that regularly sells rotten steak gets to stay in business no matter what."

Showerthoughts,ffd2v7p,t3_esv8kl,1579812335.0,"I love the idea but like other's say, it won't generate enough cash to be noticeable per individual. But maybe if you pairs the reward of bulk energy with product that's cheap in bulk like coffee. It magnifies the reward. As you generate energy instead of it translating to cash, it translates to coffee cups. The gym can use the bulk energy of all members and coffee when made in large quantities can end up costing $0.01-0.03 a cup to the gym. The energy generated and cost of coffee to the gym evens out to zero, but for the members, getting your coffee free from your gym via drive thru or in cafe every morning saves you about $2-4 from a coffee place or $0.25-0.75 at home in one cup portions. Over a month that can add up to an amount that matters a little bit. Like from $15 to over $100 depending on how you normally get your morning coffee. This will let the gym effectively pay for your membership in coffee savings without having to give you back the cash equivalent of your membership."

science,ffb0iuv,t3_esl2ix,1579748792.0,"[Robert Sapolsky studied stress in baboons for years.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncYMV4DXCMU) His description of stress is the best I've ever heard to date. Humans, like other primates, only have one kind of stress we're biologically equipped to deal with. Survival stress of dealing with predators or other types of threats in nature. In the predator example, everything in your body shuts off except your muscles and cognitive acuity. That means your reproductive organs stop, you hair and nails stop growing, you digestive system stops, tissue repair stops. All to conserve energy for your muscles and brain so you can be stronger and more focused to escape. After 10 minutes of so, you're either dead or safe.

But in modern day our stress takes a more long term effect. You're not stressed for 10 minutes, you're stressed for months because you can't pay rent. Your student loans pile up. You're wondering if you'll get that promotion at work. That means your secondary body functions like hair growth, digestion, tissue repair, reproductive system, are all mildly effective for long durations rather than severely shut down for short durations. So your hair falls out or gets gray, you get constipated, you get headaches, can't sleep correctly due to increased energy at night when you're laying in bed thinking about your stress. It's connected to the same primate biological functions."

Why is Bernie's lifetime of the same rhetoric a good thing? Especially when he's actually been in government the whole time and had decades to implement his ideas at various levels of government. If someone told you they've been trying to build a car powered by hamster wheels for the last 40 years but they've never got it to work or sold any units. That would make their idea less creditable. Not more.
