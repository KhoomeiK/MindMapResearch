I remember watching some history show (documentary? Movie?) that examines many different things. Anyway, I remember them looking into Noah's ark, the states dimensions, etc. They found out that based on the approximate(?) time Noah would've lived, there would've been ~35k species that would need to be on the ark. Based on the dimensions, the ark could hold ~70k for the 40 days and nights.

This is one of the reasons I still am religious (trying to believe at least). I don't believe everything was true verbatim and really happened but I do believe there is a lot of truth, some very true, others not so much, in the Bible.
