civ,fffurrv,t3_ete3ak,1579892242.0,"* Yes. You want lots of territory anyways, for more national parks and seaside resorts.

* Yes. Send at least one trade route to every other civ and you'll gain 25% more tourism. This value will increase with the social media civic and certain great merchants iirc.

* Not sure, I think this depends on several different factors. Note that going to war might make other civs hate you, which will lead to less tourism because they won't accept open borders. Furthermore going to war stops trade routes to that civ.

On the other hand if Brazil is leading in raw culture, taking/razing a few of their cities may help you win because the ""finish line"" will be closer.

Note that you should under no circumstances completely wipe out a civ, because that will simply reduce the amount of tourists you get.

* You'll want decent faith generation around mid game, place a lot of national parks and as many seaside resorts as you can. In the late game, focus on Rock bands, especially if you have nowhere else to place national parks. 

More tips:

* Eiffel tower and Cristo Redentor are very strong wonders for culture victory, try to get both of them.

* In the late game, tear up your improvements and replace them with woods. This way you can increase appeal for better quality and quantity of national parks and seaside resorts.

* Do not neglect science, some techs are very helpful for a culture victory. In particular steel, radio, and computers."

math,fehkcrc,t1_fehgzmy,1579118310.0,"Like most common trigonometric identities, the proof is quite easy using complex analysis and Euler's formula.

e^ix = cos(x)+i•sin(x)

Squaring both sides and replacing x with 2x happen to give the same LHS, therefore

e^i2x = cos²(x)+2i•cos(x)sin(x)-sin²(x) = cos(2x)+i•sin(2x)

And equating the imaginary parts,

2sin(x)cos(x) = sin(2x)

Incidentally we also get the cos double angle formula by equating the real parts.

cos²(x)-sin²(x) = cos(2x)"

math,fdx9h69,t1_fdwzfh5,1578766619.0,"Much (most?) of math is about proving statements from previously known facts. Of course if you have to prove absolutely everything you'd have nowhere to start, because all proofs rely on previously established facts. Axioms are statements that we say are true without needing to prove them.

There are many different axiomatic systems (i.e. collections of axioms), and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory + Choice (ZFC) is a commonly used one. If you like you can look up the specific axioms which make it up.

Given only the axioms in ZFC, one can neither prove nor disprove the continuum hypothesis. However, there are other axiomatic systems in which CH can be proven or disproven."
