me_irl,ffdecxb,t3_essf3t,1579819102.0,"ok, first off the plural of Lego is Lego, you weak minded wench, you absolute turd flower, you absent minded fool. did you attend school or were you too busy picking your brain out though your nose, you complete utter buffoon, you clod, for this i will barbecue your firstborn and send all subsequent offspring to the shadow dimension where your bloodline can no longer mildly irritate the small group of people that care about the plural of Lego being Lego so your tyranny can come to an end

second off, its lunch on a Friday and you're complaining about people having fun with Lego? what are you, the fun police or my boomer dad?

third off, i don't know whats more sad, them whinging about Lego or me getting my knickers in a twist over it (the answer is the fact they don not know the plural of Lego as all brainlet pissmonkey asshole cock weges don't)
