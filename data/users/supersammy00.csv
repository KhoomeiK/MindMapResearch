running,ff20uf5,t3_er3stq,1579490794.0,Sounds great. I wanted to make a marathon happen this year but during my fall semester school tore me down. I really want to sign up for next year. This is my home city so I really want to run it but I've had trouble managing my running with school. That is one of my goals for this year and if I can stay consistent I believe I can run my first marathon. So far I've had a very good last few weeks of running but much shorter distance until I build back up.

The system being stacked against the poor/working class is exactly what people are angry about. If you paid people a living wage they wouldn't be living paycheck to paycheck and could participate if they wanted to in wealth building but right now it's impossible for most people which is the whole point.
theydidthemath,fei59hp,t1_fehv0s8,1579130578.0,It's a thought experiment to show no matter what job you do wage workers are never going to be in the same league as the 1%. If you instead think of it like 2019 people instead of years all working full time in 2020 making 2000/hr it would be 8.3B before any taxes/living expenses which would take out a big chunk. This shows even if we work together we can't beat them at their own game. Cause they made it that way.

running,fe8nql4,t1_fe7mb1e,1578928343.0,"Those are valid points.

In the first one I'm talking about how they are all just people who love difficult running. I underplayed how much training they go through but there's something in my opinion relatable and within reach about those people.  That isn't the case with these shorter distance stars. 

To your second point it is an underdog story but we know nothing about his journey just that he got a new world record that's all that's being framed from my point of view. Which makes it unrelatable for me. That is what my central point is that is isn't relatable. These runners from one region in Africa break what seems to be all the records. They train so hard because they have to but I can't relate to it. I can appreciate how hard it is for them but it doesn't inspire me to run faster myself."

running,fe5x3si,t1_fe4qjgq,1578876894.0,Probably some type of under dog story. Most people who are runners know how lucky you need to be for this type of achievement. We're not trying to put down the amazing accomplishment but almost everyone reading about this story literally couldn't have done it. You need to be a special person in a special environment to beat the world record. There are other runner story's I find inspiring. I love watching the Barkley marathon documentaries. Those people are my type of runner. Average people with an incredible amount of drive and determination. I love that shit but when I hear someone break another record because they had the perfect upbringing to accomplish that it doesn't push me to be better. It reminds me of how I could never have done that because of my environment regardless of how much drive I could've had.

running,fe3xjs0,t3_eno7fg,1578853782.0,My runnings been very inconsistent and basically stop and started a lot this past year. In the spring I got a really bad case of bronchitis which last nearly 2 months but after I got back into running for a good while then hit a rough patch late summer the school started in the Fall and I couldn't keep it together and stopped for too long. Finally about 3 weeks ago I got back into a decent routine and I'm back at it again. Just got back from a run this morning which is my 5 or 6 day in a row. I'm really trying to lay the ground work for this upcoming semester to stay consistent and not continue to backslide like 2019. My goal this year is to run the Houston marathon next January hopefully under 4 hours. Never accomplished 26.2 miles before but I have gotten pretty close in 2017.
