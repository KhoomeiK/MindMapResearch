MadOver30,fgnfwjj,t3_ezbyx8,1580944015.0,"I don't know your life nor your situation. So I'm not going to contradict anything you've said. 

It's cruel that life is so shit for some people (myself included), and life is, it's not just feeling sorry for yourself, it's just the harsh reality that some people have been dealt a shit hand in 'life', and it doesn't always get better. 

But I am sorry that you are suffering and have been all your life. That's not just an empty sentiment, I hate that people have so much misery and pain, it doesn't make me feel 'better' that others have similar struggles, it makes it worse if anything, no one should have to feel that bad. There really isn't any justice in the world."
mentalillness,fgnb9kf,t3_ezdndv,1580941250.0,"years ago it was always separate from me, I was me, but I had this thing that was wrong with me, that mad me feel and act a certain way, it wasn't me.   
Now after all the years, it's just who I am, it became part of me and I hate that."

insideno9,fggyqid,t3_eyfeom,1580772589.0,"I didn't like it, which saddens me to say, as there isn't an episode I've disliked since this one.

 It definitely had some funny moments, but just seemed 'lacking'. 

Maybe it's somewhat to do with I'm not a fan of football at all, and basically know nothing about the sport.

I'm still looking forward to the rest of the series though."

tbf everyone I know is against it, but I feel the general consensus of Devon is for it. Especially the way voting usually goes.   
Or maybe I just don't get out enough lol."
