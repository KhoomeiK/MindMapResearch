AteTheOnion,ffvoz5r,t3_ev78vu,1580269329.0,"Actually, we do have a rather distinctive smell. If you could smell genuine cheerfulness with an undercurrent of massive amounts of adrenaline every time someone says ""my pastor told me y'all don't believe in Jesus"" or ""we ain't Jehovah Witness"" or something like that, that'd be it. I have been told that, on several occasions. If I thought you people already *were* Jehovah's Witnesses, why would I be *at your door* trying to share a scripture you already know about, Mrs. Whitlock, you senile ***dipstick?!***"

wholesomememes,ffvifhc,t1_ffvi5c5,1580264860.0,"I'm getting so much good cooking advice on this comment. So far I've learned to start with stale panettone and add freshly-grated nutmeg to the above egg mix, then, as you say, fry it in a coconut-oiled pan. Reddit's lovely community strikes again! Thanks."
wholesomememes,ffvhvgh,t1_ffvhr5z,1580264484.0,"Right, well, I saw one of those sexy Microplane graters at a Whole Foods once and I've been wanting to give it to myself as a present. Maybe today's the day."

wholesomememes,ffuw91e,t1_ffuid4q,1580250527.0,"I recently turned a whole loaf of butter bread (because I couldn't get brioche or challah) into a nice big pile of delicious French toast for a post-religious-meeting brunch. It's worth the effort to make it right. ""Right,"" in my case, is two eggs (for two slices), add a dash of cinnamon, a capful of real vanilla extract, and a splash of half & half. Soak your bread on both sides for a few seconds and cook in a frying pan with a nice layer of melted butter. It's done when it's got spots of golden brown on both sides."
