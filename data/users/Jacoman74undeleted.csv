RelayForReddit,ffr7ser,t3_eul1gd,1580152314.0,"Currently no, but if you know enough about Android development you can probably extract the APK and repackage it with a different theme selection. Keep in mind this project is not FOS and as such you cannot fork the project for anything other than personal use. Do not sell, or redistribute the software with any modified or unmodified code, I don't think dbrady would sue, given how reasonable he seems on the sub, but idk for sure so better safe than sorry. Obviously if you tried to sell it that's a no-go."

mildlyinfuriating,ffr5gmb,t1_ffr54jx,1580150869.0,"The best thing to do with in ear headphones is to contact an ENT about having custom earbuds made to fit your ear. Basically they take a mold of your ear, create a negative, then cast that  from silicone with a port to fit your earbuds. No pain, even after extended use, but often prohibitively expensive. You can do the same thing at home if you have a quick drying **skin contact safe** putty. I'd estimate that doing it yourself would cost around USD50, where having an ENT do it professionally would likely be a few hundred dollars US."
