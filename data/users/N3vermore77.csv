Thats one of the problems. Even if you really think Im not going to change your mind or you mine, at least dont cower away from discussion.

blursedimages,fdsa8rc,t1_fds8xu7,1578697945.0,"Isnt god all-knowing and all-loving? Then why would he ever write such things in the first place?

Funny you mention the association thing, since you pretty much just did it by associating the asshats circle-jerking over at r/atheism with the entire sub. Im not gonna deny they're not there, but the thing is atheism isnt a form of extremism. Religion in most of its forms, is. Atheism disregards gods, doesnt disprove them. Religions will prosecute you in one way or another if you say you dont believe, or believe in another god. Christianity's form of prosecution, not just for non-believers but for sinners in general, is hell. No good moral compass divides people into only 2 groups, good and ""deserves eternal torture"". Thats idiotic.

And jesus isnt perfect too. Even if his ideas were better than what the old testament stated he was flawed in many ways, like for example, by advocating for the very system of hell and heaven like I talked about, among other things."
blursedimages,fds94cc,t1_fds88ub,1578697196.0,"You keep repeating yourself and not listening.

If someone is sent to hell for sinning and others are sent to heaven for NOT sinning then yeah, they're being treated with prefference and thats the same as if someone is better for not being gay. Its black and white thinking and a form of manipulation.

And dont come at me with the ""repent"" bullshit. The whole concept of repenting is an excuse for Christians to commit as many sins as they want and not suffer any consequences for it, because ""its ok, you feel bad about it and thats what matters"" and off they go to do it again.

Maybe next time you tell someone to step off and call them a bitch actually try to advance the conversation and make an actual argument instead of just repeating yourself."

And to answer your question, yes he would according to basic Christian principles. Its that black and white thinking that makes me despise Christianity so much. You cant place lying and mass murder in the same category and pretend there's no middle ground.

A black man attired in, not the usual soldier outfit, but rather with loony looking suit, a comic like mocking of actual soldier outfitting, suited with explosives and whose colors explosively contrast with the grim gray tones of the landscape around you. He wears not a helmet but a pirate hat with a small treasure chest and.. an octopus inside it? Truly a strange sight to behold, but there's more: he wears also a pair of shutter shades and instead of a rifle or even a knife he holds a frying pan instead. ""An odd weapon"" you think to yourself. Witnessing such a figure makes you wonder if the bleak reality of war has began to make you go insane. But before you can feed the thought any longer, it happens. Suddenly it all goes silent, as if the world in its entirety awaited this man's actions. And then IT broke the silence and spoke.
