facepalm,fdnlf16,t1_fdnkunl,1578588247.0,"Everybody has what's called an insurance score. It's just like a credit score, matter of fact credit plays a role in the algorithm that determines ones insurance score. Everytime you call and file a claim regardless of fault your score drops. Lower score = higher rates. Some companies only pull your score at renewal and some offer forgiveness(at an added cost). All companies must report to Lexus Nexus's ALH, Auto Loss History report. If hey don't they are not an A rated carrier and don't have enough liquidity to fulfill claims. If you are with a carrier that is not A rated good luck in the event a large event causes mass claims. See the paradise wildfires from a few years ago. Thousands of people lost their homes and didn't receive a penny because they were insured with sub A rated companies who didn't have money to pay out claims."

We are the largest energy producing country in the world.

We would have an infrastructure bill if the Dems would cooperate.

My 401k is doing so well because the company I work for used the tax break Trump gave them to raise our pay and to match 401k contributions 100% up to 50% of my income. I put in 20% of every paycheck. Combined with the additional 20% I get I am almost 400%.

As far as 2020 goes and who I would support. There is nobody on the left that will take my vote away from Trump. My 401k is up nearly 400% since Election Day. My tax bill has been reduced. Illegal immigration is down. That's about all I care about."
