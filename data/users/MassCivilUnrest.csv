As I said, there would be little conflict if we had the finances to mitigate them. I am depressed because of factors I cannot control and she has her own mental hurdles as well. We are a team and very much in love and determined to work things out. I do not cut and run when the going gets tough.

Edit: further, op is asking honest questions and I am sympathizing with thier situation and trying to get a helpful discourse going that might benefit those reading. We all have struggles and there are many ways to overcome them. I hope op is realizing they are not alone and there is hope and it takes analysis and work. Hopefully there are also others that chime in with thier own experiences as I do think that conflicting political opinion and other relationship struggles can be overcome and is a worthy topic of nuanced discussion.

We have other troubles, mainly financial, that has led to some resentment between us and theres also been a period recently where I feel my autonomy has been violated and wishes not respected. Counseling is her idea and im doing it for her, I personally dont think we need it, I just need a lil respect. We have been together for years and have a child together. I believe the catalyst was the unplanned pregnancy that I was opposed to and she was for, this has set off a chain of events that has led me into a depression. We love our kid very much, its not about that but about the conflict and resent that has built over the last year in relation to various events. So its not about politics although my beliefs do guide my actions and it will likely come up at some point. I have no intention of leaving my SO of 6 years that I have a baby with.

Anarchy101,fe3dakk,t3_enpfwh,1578848266.0,"Yes, I know the feeling. Its hard to peg my SOs political beliefs as shes probably well uninformed. That said, shes made contradictory claims in the past such as: shes a feminist, a libertarian, she likes bernie but also has said ""states rights"" and has defended the confederate flag. Its a mixed bag but id put her as liberal, thinks capitalism isnt great but the best we have. Im a socialist of varying degree and have recently gotten involved with two socialisty orgs and have begun participating and organizing, as well as reading theory and paying attention to the propaganda cycles. Weve had a few good convos and she has generally liked and appreciated a lot of the ideas, but doesnt want to make any serious changes in our lives toward dual power building and anticapitalist action. Shes proud of me for my compassion but it has also put a strain on our relationship and thinks ""everything is political"" with me and ive become a different person with different goals etc. You see she was raised conservative and her family is mostly conservative, I tend to contradict that notion heavily and they are also aware of my left leaning. So politics are off the table when visiting although dad and brothers make sjw, liberal, tree hugger comments where I am not permitted to retaliate or make my own analysis. We all get along fine though. We both agree wage slavery is the absolute duldrums and both want to reduce our work as much as possible, but you know what that means? Become a landlord or exploitative business owner. So our long term goals are somewhat deviated at this time.
