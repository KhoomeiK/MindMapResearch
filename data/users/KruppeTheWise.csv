AskReddit,fevexcm,t3_eqies2,1579396584.0,"Well I drive around a lot for my job, service technician. The same roads, hours and hours it gets boring. 

Anyways I'm pulling upto a junction I know pretty well, I'm on the smaller road the other is a flyover for a highway but 6 lanes and people drive pretty fast on it, I think the size and the fact people have probably just exited the highway to get on it is the main reason.

There is a big truck pulling a trailer on my left, a couple other cars as I'm slowly pulling upto the line. For some reason, I think it would be cool to see how vividly I can imagine this as if I was third person in GTA. Completely out of the blue, just my bored mind making fun. 

So I'm kinda scanning my surrounding and then populating my imagination with what I see, the sign, the road, the more and more things I add the harder it gets to hold the whole image in my head whilst also trying to render myself in my van, it was a kinda fun little exercise. 

The lights turn green. I'm turning left, so is the truck to the left of me, it's into a dual lane road all legit.
 I give the van a bit of a gun as soon as I see the green, as I want to pull ahead of the truck before the next intersection and turn left without making it slow down, I'm good like that. And im still kind imagining everything in 3D.

Bear in mind the truck and trailer have completely obscured my view to the left as I pull out but somehow in my 3D rendering I see a sedan screaming down the road to the left of me, *other side of the truck.*

I slam on. Split second later a sedan something like a Kia Optima flies absolutely flies past, brakes locked with two guys screaming in fear and white as a sheet as they go. They don't manage to stop even on the other side of the intersection so they accelerated and left once they made it to the other side. 

As we both start rolling forward I make eye contact with the guy up high in his truck and his face is an admixture of shock and relief, shaking his head as it he doesn't believe what he just saw. I kinda nodded at him and he nodded back and off we went on our journey.

 I still have zero fucking idea how I knew to slam on the brakes, but I can swear if I didn't I would have taken that sedan right on my lap and likely be dead right now. Felt weird about it for months."

CommercialAV,fdy44uk,t1_fdy0ay7,1578775913.0,"First off, a networking guy will more likely lump Ubiquti with Luxul and Araknis over his cisco, Aruba or Juniper gear. Maybe sit ubiquti in the middle depending on if he's even used it.

But even the biggest AV integrators don't have networking guys and the smallest surely don't. Something like Araknis that can setup a VPN over two clients sites with minimal networking knowledge actually has its niche, or easily allowing a programmer to access the equipment with a GUI holding their hand. 

In any decent sized business, the av integrator doesn't even provide the switches or config anyway the onsite networking team do it, we just ask them for some IP addresses, QoS and VLAN info for VoIP for example. 


Luxul can burn in hell though that shit fails almost as bad as hewhoshallnotbenamed (pakedge)."

Sure a bunch of crazy fuckers walked around (and still walk around) proclaiming to be the son of God, messiah etc etc. A mythos appeared and out of that solidified the idea of Jesus. 

But Jesus didn't exist."
