Advice,ff4knxr,t3_erlvsm,1579565928.0,"It doesn't bother me if someone goes through it. My friends already know what I'd write or share. If it's a girl I'm dating, I make it a point that she knows my phone password. I don't have anything sensitive enough to hide and it's a nice token gesture that they rarely ever take up."

DecidingToBeBetter,ff35idh,t3_erawff,1579534164.0,We only change when can no longer go on living the way we were before.
Advice,fe5sf9z,t3_enscmz,1578873929.0,"Diarrhea. Beat excuse you can give. Nobody wants to be around you anyway, it's believable, and it's linked to a billion things from stress to flu to food poisoning. Just say you don't know what's wrong with you, but you've been running to the John every few minutes."

Step 2: ???

Step 3: Profit.

Seriously though, just be yourself. Nothing is more attractive to a guy than a girl who is confident with herself, has a lot of her crap in order, and is willing to out up with him."
Advice,fe1xm63,t3_enmcci,1578832062.0,"As people one of our greatest fears is opening up fully to a person and being absolutely rejected and destroyed; that's nothing to be afraid of. It may happen, it may not. I had it happen to me and I still have some troubled with to, but it's made me a better person. Doing these kinds of things in life, struggling to open up and recover they're all normal. They're what we eventually call "" Growing pains""."
Kaiserreich,fdzajbf,t3_encsb6,1578788242.0,It'd be cool if other countries could join based off of whether they qualify as major powers. I played a campaign recently as the Princely Federation and I'd have liked to have gotten some of that sweet Chinese trade after conquering the subcontinent.
