Sorry it's too sensitive for you. You being insecure about this idea is why you're here. I literally have talked and discussed with girls about this, and every one of them agrees with me. Not in the crass way you're trying to frame it of course. Why don't you talk to some girls and figure out yourself. Ask them that psychologically guys are trying to develop a relationship so they can have sex whereas girls are trying to have sex to have a relationship. This is just a basic basic principle. What's funny is not one of them was as offended as you. Now think about how pussy that makes you."
seduction,ffk4hli,t1_ffizhiw,1580015571.0,"I'm not sure why this isn't the top comment. Working out is a given, break up or not, but I can't emphasize enough how much giving her a card was a mistake. You were suppose to escalate sexually. Writing a card is what kids do. You want her sexually let's not forget that, she wants to earn your love by giving you sex (at a basic level). You have already given you all her love in a card...she's like uh...psychologically she's thinking...how much value does this guy even have, it's so easy for him to give everything he's got and I didn't give shit to him. I want someone so valuable even having sex with him he's thinking about other girls."
seduction,ffhm4dh,t1_ffhbxhl,1579941823.0,"Well being autistic is difficult. I know you may have difficulties with empathy, I'm not autistic but sometimes lack empathy and it makes me act terribly. You're comparing yourself to other people like that kid, but the thing is do you judge others a lot too? Do you think they're comparing themselves to you? Also why don't you appreciate how gifted that person is. Admire instead of jealous. That's a part of feeling empathy look how hard people worked for their success maybe they had tons of sacrifice. They didn't do all that so you can compare yourself. I'd say just care more about the others as much as yourself. I know that doesn't mean just asking how people are doing it's about putting yourself in their shoes. If some girls turns you dont go wow I'm so jealous other guys talk to her, instead say ""she's not right for me right now, let's not put her in awkward position with me hating her and obsessing on her."" Keep getting uncomfortable, you may have more sharp other skills, why don't you use that to focus on how you dress and make sure you look right on the button. I don't know exactly what problems you have, just shooting things out there. I'm glad you admit it, PM me if you want to talk."

seduction,ff747f4,t1_ff6yjxl,1579640784.0,"I agree, I don't think we have a different viewpoint here. It's difficult to explain but let me try. Positive statements like ""I have it all together"" is a great thing. When you fake it and take it as face value, thats terrible. For example, let's say you have a good job...I don't know 50-60k a year? You're not confident, and you tell yourself you have it all together, I'm so good. A fake confident person would be happy of that goal. A REAL confident person would go, I'm way better than this, I need to keep improving, I deserve more, I need to continue to learn, I'm only starting. That's ambition, drive. A fake confident person will eventually go, ""why won't girls like me, I'm so successful! Im showing so much confidence!"" They see through it. An even worst person will have a mediocre life, mediocre job, skills, friends and if they keep repeating, ""I'M SO GOOD. IM SO CONFIDENT!"" And not improve, no drive no ambition no value. That will be counter productive. I wasn't very clear, but from what I'm seeing it looks like people who haven't gotten all together, haven't even understood their insecurities wants to just fake it till they make it. By no means am I saying we should shit on ourselves, but the term ""faking it"" can be misconstrued and I think is misunderstood by many here."

I constantly patched those insecurities with my fake confident boosting mind. For me, I built no foundation from faking. I finally built my foundation after I accepted and worked on my insecurities, which excluded faking anything."
seduction,ff6mtdy,t1_ff6mhnt,1579630550.0,"Short term gains vs long term goals. I'm saying faking it will never achieve what you really need. True confidence. If you're fine with being able to be fake confident and pick up a girl go ahead, then there's post about being an imposter, then there's post about how girls leave you after a few weeks. The insecurities MANIFEST its not just about being nervous, it's about ACTIONS, how you present yourself, how you offer your values to a girl. They will SHOW. Coming from a guy who's faked it his whole life, to the point I didn't know I was faking, I literally thought I was the most confident person in the world.

I actually lived my life thinking I'm very ""confident"" and this fake confidence shows up often as ""cocky."" There are nuances of true confidence that you don't understand when you're not actually confident, it means you haven't even understood that you have insecurities. Until I realize I was not confident, I didn't love myself, I wasn't able to take care of myself physically and mentally, and I wasn't able to do what a real confident person would do, I was insecure. Things like not caring about how others think, not caring when a girl rejects you. When you are confident, girls will be absolutely see it. When you're truly confident in yourself and are centered, your perspective will change, you will no longer be rejected, why? Your perspective is that they actually missed out on a good person like you. EDIT: Rather than faking, the 1st step is to accept that you are not confident, accept that you are insecure. Learn empathy. Stop being selfish."
