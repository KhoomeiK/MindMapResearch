FurryArtSchool,fetf8oj,t3_eqchs9,1579374849.0,"I think you should definitely do some foot studies from photos or better yet real life. Outside of that, try looking at how other artists draw the dimensions of furry faces and how they display noses, since this one looks a little tacked on. You could even redraw pics of fursuit heads with guide lines on them to see where the nose falls. Also, study boobs more. I don’t think she’d have any cleavage in this pose.

Ultimately it’s not bad at all, your color choice is really nice and the character design in cute. You could even keep on with this sort of sleeker, less fluffy style, but I think life studies are what you need to really step up the anatomy. Drawing different body types is also good for figuring out how people pose/where fat lies/etc."

That isn’t particularly variable no matter what the laws are or the physical capabilities of that child are. Sure, on a case by case basis some children may be smarter, more emotionally developed, etc. than others, but there will always be a fundamental difference between a 20 year old’s capacity to understand power dynamics and sex with an adult and a 13 year old’s. They are not equally moral even if both were legal. It’s incredibly taxing to have to argue from the perspective of a CSA victim to what I assume is an adult that raping children is not okay, no matter how arbitrary laws justify it. Clinging to legality and “changing times” like this just sounds like a flimsy excuse as to why it’s okay that you’re into kids."
