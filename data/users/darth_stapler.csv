television,fcnqb7t,t3_ei3wjy,1577816419.0,Practical effects are still so import.  Movies nowadays rely too heavily on CGI.  The movie Slither is one of the more recent-ish movies that still used a majority of practical effects. Horror movies(big budget ones) and even the newer Jurassic Park films would be so much better in my opinion if they stuck to practical instead of relying on CGI.
