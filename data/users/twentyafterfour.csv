SuicideWatch,fejd5l3,t1_fej5qnz,1579168148.0,"If you got a job, wouldn't you be able to contribute? You sound like a really capable person and I'm sure it wouldn't take too long to find one. Plus as the person above said, they would have factored in the cost of supporting you when they made the offer. And it's grandparents, maybe it would make them happy to have essentially another grandkid around. 

It just seems like your current living situation is literally killing you, and you have a way out of it. It might not be perfect, but I think you deserve a chance to try and see if it helps. If it does and you do well, I'm sure you can find a way to repay them for their generosity, but I suspect the reward of helping you be a happier person might be payment enough itself."

WAPO: Care to comment on this?

R: It didn't happen.

WAPO: We have a transcript...

R: It's inaccurate

WAPO: We have it on tape.

R: It was just a joke, nothing to be concerned about. That whole part about being a family with no leaks was also part of the joke."
news,fecfg09,t1_fec8m9z,1578972637.0,"Essentially yeah. What I'd be interested to see is an AI that tries to piss off their opponents, e.g. the functional equivalent of tea-bagging on someone."
news,febtgo2,t1_feabzhd,1578962518.0,"It's similar why some AI game strategies look weird to humans, people expect them to utterly dominate but they'll play knowing they only need to win by the tiniest margin."

PoliticalHumor,fdfntt6,t1_fdfc0ys,1578365998.0,"I'd love to see you apply that same line of thinking elsewhere. Say your doctor says you have form of cancer that is almost always fatal, so you ask if you're going to die. 

He says, ""Obviously it's not quite like that because it's only stage I and not fatal yet. In time it will spread and you'll have stage IV cancer and there will be nothing we can do to save you.

""Oh so you went for the full stage IV cancer punch to make we worry about nothing.""

""Yeah because that's how cancer works, it starts small and then eventually progresses until it kills you""

""Well if it's not killing me now then you're just fear mongering to manipulate me into doing something. I don't even feel sick and therefore everything is fine. I'll wait until it's actually fatal before I worry about being dead.""

It's a brilliant argument, clearly the product of only 3 seconds of thought."

politics,fcpb0d9,t1_fcpadjt,1577856689.0,I feel like enforcing laws doesn't really qualify as playing their game.
politics,fcoozba,t1_fcngcpp,1577837747.0,"As a lifelong and absolutely legitimate republican I approve of this strategy. This way, no matter how badly we lose elections in the future we'll always be able to crush the radical-leftist agenda through our control of the courts, for the rest of your lives! But I doubt we'll lose any more elections once we strike down all those pesky voting laws that allow democrats to vote freely and easily.

And even you if guys somehow manage to turn congress completely liberal, we'll always be better off with trump in the white house because he'll just use all his power to obstruct your progressive nonsense and make the dems look weak and ineffectual to the average voter, thus setting the stage for republicans to take full control of every single branch of government and completely crush what remains of the democrat party.

Thank you for your support, we're going to need it. I mean if we can't convince progressives to help re-elect trump, we probably don't stand a chance at winning. Have you seen trump? lol"

FragileWhiteRedditor,fc4zh2j,t1_fc4wl4p,1577435326.0,"> Idiots like the one above are either actively gaslighting or they lack the capacity to grasp anything deeper than surface-level titles.

I tend to lean more towards them being idiots incapable of doing anything beyond surface level analysis. It explains why Ben Garrison has to label every single thing in his shitty cartoons, and how so many of them think the nazis were left wing because muh socialism.


The only people who I suspect are gaslighting are the talking heads making money off spouting that nonsense to their smooth-brained audience."
