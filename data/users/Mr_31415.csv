From what the sources (especially Xenophon) say, the pederastic relationsship was kind of okay as long as it had at least the outward appearance of a mentor/student relationsship, the older man would give gifts to win the boy's (~14-16) favor and should teach him to be a man and train at arms with him, but in the end everybody knew there was more to it. What was certainly not seen as okay was actual penetrative sex between the two, there are even pictures in pottery showing man and boy doing some kind of ""thigh fucking"", where the man penetrates the pressed together thighs of the boy ... yapp that was supposed to be the proper ""non emasculating"" way to fuck a boy.

Random side question, bc you don't meet Norwegians everyday: is it truly the case, as i read, that all spoken Norwegian is dialect and the two Standard varieties are only used in writing? I would imagine that at least in the cities ppl would start to talk in the standard variety they use for writing and kids would grow up with it as a first language. Like my mother grew up speaking a dialect of Low German as her first language, my father already with Standard German and so did i and my siblings.

Then your approach of making the movie itself (not only the characters) nationalistic would be guilty of the same fallacy, bc you say smth like ""people where nationalistic back then so this is the rightful way to depict the time"", that is you imposing your view about the time onto it. 

But the real fallacy here is that movies aren't supposed to look onto the past from their present, as i said above it is important to depict the characters in the movie as realistically as possible: if they are historic model them on their real counterpart if they are fictional try depicting a range of views shown in the sources. I read the personal letters of many WWI soldiers, some especially from the middle class came into the war with nationalistic vigor and couldn't wait to fight for King (or Kaiser) and country, but when they saw the reality of the war this furor soon dampend, others (but less) kept their nationalism upright, some especially workers and lower class men were much more cautious from the get go and feared the war without many signs of nationalism overpowering that fear. A movie about WWi should show the whole spectrum. But the message and viewpoint of a movie is allowed to be present (it really can't have a past viewpoint of you think about it, it's made by present people), good movie makers will not shove that message down your throat but subtly make their stance. And that present viewpoint  may be different with different directors and their different opinions over which present critics may argue who is right due to their own opinion. I mean they did argue about the view onto the war back during the war. And the reason they still make WWI movies is that every new generation of film makers has their view onto the war, which isn't consistent over the whole of that generation.  ""Presentism"" is when the characters themselves show viewpoints not feasible in their time but stemming from the present of the movie makers."
facepalm,fe58544,t1_fe2v2lm,1578866473.0,"That's not a modern view. You do understand, that there were plenty of people back then that were aware of the pointlessness of the war and all the nationalism surrounding it? There is no such thing as a monilithic ""view"" of that time and critique of nationalism was ""a"" view of that time just as much as nationalism itself, albeit that the later was more widespread.

But more importantly the author didn't call for characters to show ""modern views"" but for the story to depict the very real circumstance, that this war was the pointless consequence of rampant nationalism thinly veiling corporate and imperial interests at work on all sides. That is not the same as real cases of ""presentism"" like eg. the collective work of Mel Gibson, where characters themselves show moral views representative of our present."
