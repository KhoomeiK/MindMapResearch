I was in my younger years and smoked some pot with friends and drove home later reeking of it, eyes still red....and also decided to keep my stash in the driver side door compartment like an actual fucking idiot. I had a 5 minute drive to my bf’s house and didn’t think anything of it at the time.

I ran a turn that had a yield and a blind spot, and I was so used to not checking (because I’m an idiot, and not everyone uses that turn as often, and I’m a fucking IDIOT) i had inadvertently cut off someone and cut it close to hitting them.

Well, it was a cop. Go figure.

He pulls me over, and at that moment I’m shaking like a leaf in San Diego. I realize at this moment, i didn’t have my insurance in the car with me. I was a dumb kid who’s parents took care of stuff like that, and my dad forgot to put the paper in the car when we got it updated.

So here I am, look as high as a kite about to cry, no insurance, cut off a cop, had a baggy of weed and smoking equipment under my driver side window that he is STANDING  at, looking at me with fury from almost hitting him and can clearly smell it all and knows I had been smoking.  And you want to know what he did to really lay into me? 

Well, he let me go with a ticket. 

You could tell by looking at this guy he was holding back the fury most drivers had for idiots who cut them off and he knew he could rightfully destroy my life because of the pot. I was a very very stupid teenager and looking back at all the stupid makes me hurt inside.

But he walked back to his car, my bf calls and I answer and explain i didn’t have my insurance card and i was pulled over, maybe he had heard me and maybe he had heard my terrified girly voice and took pity, 

maybe I wasn’t worth his time and he just wanted to go home. 
But he walked back and let out one of those sighs you give when you’re angry as hell but being the bigger person, and didn’t arrest me. He made a call and i learned a very fucking valuable lesson and it scared me straight"

trashy,fbxmd8i,t1_fbxbmz0,1577193788.0,"We feel like we can’t do much either, and that cash is more like a pipe dream with certain employers. 
I was stuck in a retail job until last year and while i was job hunting and my old boss got petty and took it personally, and made me work 20-30+ hours past my availability despite being a student and only part time and having a bad anxiety disorder.
Illegal? Yes. But that’s literally what retail is. Every place feeds you bs about how they respect when you’re available to work, but then make it so that you’re available ALL the time for them or you’re replaced.

The stress took too much toll on my body, i developed gastroparesis as a result. And it sucks, my quality of life is so much less than before and i feel weak and like an old woman dying at 25. I eat about 200 calories every couple of days and always feel like I’m about to pass out. When i do manage to eat it sits in me and it’s so painful, it makes me feel so sick. 
I can’t go out to eat with friends, cant really go out in general these days, can’t eat at all most days and I’m looking right now at getting a njtube. 

Apparently there’s a 4-38% mortality rate within the first ten years of a diagnoses. And no cure, just measures you can take to try and get the symptoms under control. I’m severely depressed because what the fuck was my degree for? Will i even get to use it? Will i even get to have kids or be there for them? 
I’m going to starve to death with plates of foods i love, staring at me.

pretty sure at this point i can’t do much legally. he changed my records, that manager “lost” my paperwork etc. i don’t have anything and I’m too depressed to try.
60% of my old coworkers have quit and they’ve already been replaced by more teenagers and young adults like myself who have nowhere else to go as far as job opportunities because it’s all we can get. Those who still stay hate it there and are unhappy, but nothing ever changed. 

I have since managed to get a WAY better job that’s flexible with my schedule so i can work around the illness. I’d love to royally fuck up my old boss for potentially ruining the rest of my life. We’re being worked to death at this point now, and that’s every retail place"
