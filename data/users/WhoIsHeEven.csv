BreakUps,fg8ui8f,t1_fg8ml7e,1580629843.0,"Fuck. Me too. My partner told me on Jan. 2 she cheated on me and then broke up with me the same day.

2019 was the hardest year of my life, and that's how I start out 2020.

I actually like to lump that in with 2019 and make sure that 2020 is way better!"
BreakUps,fg7fun5,t1_ffv264m,1580591486.0,"Can you elaborate on this? Are you saying that if we're unhappy with our own lives, it can actually be a good thing to seek a new relationship because it can be a way to better ourselves?

In my experience, I've dated a couple of people when I was going through transitions in life and was kind of lost and not fulfilled with myself. I think it was unattractive to them and also put a lot of pressure on them, and it ended poorly.

But I am curious to hear more about what you think."
BreakUps,fg6ob02,t1_fg6hipn,1580573078.0,"Thank you for this. I think this is what my ex girlfriend did to me. Then she went on a week long vacation and met a guy and cheated on me 3 times over that week. When she came back she said that she realized if she could cheat on me like that, that she wasn't in love with me anymore and had to break up with me.

She also told me that she felt such a strong, instant connection with this guy. So it really felt like the moment her feelings turned on for him, they turned off for me. During the breakup I was a wreck and she almost seemed indifferent.

Three weeks later, she's gone back to see him again. And I haven't even moved out of the house yet."
BreakUps,fg06nv5,t1_ffzy4aj,1580401379.0,"I feel like a lost soul as well, floating around all alone. I have some really close friends, but they're now scattered all over the country. And when I do see them, I realize that we've all grown and changed so much that we don't even really have the same interests anymore.

I don't have any new friends because I've moved 3 times in the last 2 years (mainly for my ex) and it takes me forever to make friends because I'm socially anxious. And now I'm moving again.

I really liked my ex's friends because they all like to do the same things I like to do (as did my girlfriend - she was my adventure partner).

I have family but we're not all that close.

I'm so lost and all alone. It's a terrible feeling."
BreakUps,fg0654w,t1_ffzef5t,1580401061.0,"Same here, I'm 33. With the breakups of my twenties I was actually okay being single, excited sometimes even. But now I don't want to be single. I want a god damn partner."
BreakUps,fg05npu,t1_ffzz041,1580400759.0,"You all will definitely find someone you can connect with like that again. Probably even more so. Just try and learn as many lessons from this breakup as you can, and you'll be able to avoid any mistakes made and be an even better partner in the future.

You're all very young, just hang in there and the right one will come along."
BreakUps,ffxj378,t1_ffx6fdg,1580326156.0,Me too. Ouch. This is one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with and she hardly bats an eye. She turned off her feelings like turning out the lights.
politics,ffuf2fl,t1_ffu4zg1,1580240607.0,Nice work bugging this guy!
BreakUps,ffu4rma,t1_ffm1dqx,1580234474.0,I'm definitely trying to focus on that. I've realized that me not being fully happy with myself was a huge stress on my last two relationships. I know another person cannot provide happiness for me. I have to provide that for myself before I form another relationship with someone.
BreakUps,ffiv9ar,t1_ffirynj,1579983553.0,">You start to mull over everything when you're grieving & wonder what you could have done to save the relationship when the whole time, you knew it wasn't working anyway.

Yes, I agree with this so much. There are many things I could have done differently, but I'm not perfect and put in a lot of effort because I loved her. My effort wasn't matched, and then she cheated on me and left me.  


I can do so much better than someone as selfish and inconsiderate as her."
BreakUps,ffig6dm,t1_ff2eua1,1579973095.0,"Yeah, I probably do. It doesn't feel like it in the moment, but I realize it's probably true. Thank you."
BreakUps,ff0752a,t1_feum2kn,1579465883.0,"Well, that's not really how it works. I'll have to build hours working a job that doesn't pay much for quite a while before I'll actually land a good job. It's going to be a few years in the making I imagine. If I'm lucky I'll be in my late 30's by the time I'm comfortable in my career. And between now and then I'll probably be working in Alaska half of the year. I don't want to live there full time so I'll have to meet a girl at home, but it's hard to start dating someone and say ”Hey I'm gonna go to Alaska for 6 months, just hold tight and I'll be right back."" And then do it all over again 6 months later."

BreakUps,feugemc,t1_fetacfu,1579386291.0,"I hope that my girlfriend regrets cheating on me, and then leaving me even after I told her I could forgive her. I so badly hope she realizes what a special person she threw away."
BreakUps,feug30q,t1_fetx04h,1579386177.0,"Me too : ( 

I spent 3 years with one, 5 years with the next, and 2 years with my most recent girlfriend (we broke up a week ago). Now I'm 33, and have so much work to do on myself that I don't think I should date for a couple of years at least. I have so much trouble meeting new people, all of my girlfriends I've met in the restaurants I've worked in. But now I've decided to leave that line of work and pursue a career in being an airplane pilot and I'll probably be traveling a lot. Not exactly the best for finding a new partner."
BreakUps,feudz1j,t1_fesbtfk,1579385627.0,">just after a break up is the time you need to learn to love yourself again, then once your in a better place you can work on getting better for your future relationships and for yourself

I'm fresh out of a breakup, and all I can seem to focus on is what I did to push her away and how to prevent it from happening in the future. I've realized that this is a pattern and has happened three times now, and I don't want it to happen again. I can't take heart break like this again. How do I ignore my flaws and not focus on improving? How do I instead learn to love myself?"
BreakUps,feiuipi,t1_feb48as,1579147574.0,"I'm going through a breakup right now. 2 years ago I went through another terrible breakup. Both sent me into a terrible depression and I had thoughts of suicide. The only reason I have hope for this breakup is because I got through my last one and came out on the other side happy again. I fell in love again. It was fucking hard, but I just held on and shit got better. Time will heal. It's the only thing that can.

I don't claim to know exactly what you're going through, but I promise you without a shadow of a doubt that it WILL get better. Just hang on. Lean on your friends and family for support. Meditate. Exercise. Do whatever you can to stay busy. I know it probably seems impossible to pull yourself out of bed, but do whatever you can.

Be strong. You got this."

Hang on. It will get better. You WILL feel happiness again. You just have to fight."

news,fdqu75c,t1_fdnbpp0,1578674960.0,"I use an app called Feedly. It's an aggregation app and you choose the sources. So I choose some left-leaning news outlets, some right-leaning news outlets, and some that I believe are to be the most unbiased. Then it shows me a feed of all the most popular articles from all of those sources on one page. It's pretty cool. In the end, you're still trusting the media, but at least you see news from different sides."
AskMen,fdh5550,t1_fdgyl12,1578415594.0,Another height buddy here. I'm 5'11” and 3/4 too and I can never bring myself to exaggerate my height. Sometimes I'll round up to 6’ but then immediately have to clarify that I'm actually not quite 6' tall.
