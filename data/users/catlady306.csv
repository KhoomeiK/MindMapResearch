My600lbLife,ffb5ruy,t1_ffayfhu,1579752539.0,Yep! I remember seeing that when I watched that episode and it was so disturbing.
My600lbLife,ffar0ol,t3_esidiv,1579742465.0,"Lisa is downright scary in both of those episodes, it's like she wants to watch him eat himself to death and help him do it."
My600lbLife,ffaqvf5,t3_esgz2n,1579742366.0,"The stress of trauma and poverty tends to lead a lot of people to various addictions and food is readily available, cheap and legal and often introduced to them by their caregivers when they are children. And while it's hard to get out of poverty in the first place, having to do so when you are so severely overweight makes it that much harder."

harrypotter,feowe4i,t3_eq5ctk,1579306842.0,She wasn't all that great in the books tbh. Most of the scenes with her are her talking trash about other people and the rest is from Harry's perspective talking about how pretty and clever and amazing she is.
LuLaNo,fel98oi,t3_epfo1w,1579216830.0,The pink design looks like very pale red blood cells
thesims,fekzzka,t3_epj476,1579211129.0,"My townie sims loved one of the CC hairs I have and I had some issues with mods and saved without mods, so now about 40% of all the townies are bald and a bunch are walking around in their underpants"

harrypotter,fektvz7,t3_epktc9,1579207505.0,"My cat looks a lot like Crookshanks in the movie so I definitely wish he had more screen time, more scenes, hell, just make the whole movie Crookshanks and a bunch of British Wizards"

harrypotter,fejnuds,t3_epiuij,1579181096.0,"I think anyone who's ever lived with a cat knows the answer to be yes. What other creature can go from solid, to liquid, to something in between depending on whether or not a box is present"
harrypotter,fejnjt3,t3_epd73d,1579180839.0,"The rings of power had a corrupting effect, that's why the lesser rings given to the kings of men turned them eventually into Nazgul and the one ring is more powerful than those which is why it corrupted Isildur almost immediately. The rings given to the dwarves caused the ruin of the dwarf kingdoms. Hobbits seem more immune to the corruption and elves and Istari have a way to combat it which is why Gollum was able to wear the one ring  albeit unscathed and why Gandalf and Galadriel could wear theirs. They don't split the soul, they are dark magic created by Sauron, a being with magic far more powerful than mortals. 

The rings of power a separate set of magic and work by a different set of rules and their powers extend to more than just immortality so they can't be compared with Horcruxes or the Philosophers Stone."
harrypotter,fehexwj,t3_ep5yxf,1579115144.0,"James was a jerk, he was a rich, spoiled bully and represents someone most of us have met in real life and dislike immensely. That said, people marry jerks, especially rich jerks and Lily was human and married extremely young, we only see her through the eyes of Snape and Harry, an extremely idealized version of who she was, a flawed human like the rest of us."

Groceries: 300/month

Rent: 600/month

Dildos: 2,342,342/month

Please help my family is going broke"
antiMLM,fednu2y,t3_eoash7,1579016017.0,"Maybe I'm naive but how many dildos does a person actually need? Also why is your partner controlling your credit cards because that seems unhealthy. Third, how does buying too many dildos and being in a borderline abusive and unsatisfying relationship qualify you to be a dildo salesperson?"
My600lbLife,fe8bjki,t3_envuz1,1578924523.0,"Most of these people are the weight they eat to avoid dealing with extreme trauma, often in their childhood, to have to give up their drug of choice AND to start dealing with some extremely painful things isn't easy. Also many of them struggle with social anxiety and having it myself, there's such an incredible feeling of being judged by everyone for everything and opening up your most vulnerable secrets to another human being is terrifying."
My600lbLife,fe8acld,t3_enftir,1578924186.0,"One the one hand, it's good, because I am am overweight now and it helps encourage me make healthy decisions. On the other hand, having struggled with ED on and off, the show's not great for my body image, I often will see myself in the people in the show even though I'm nowhere near their size."

My600lbLife,fdosx67,t1_fdn0q95,1578612152.0,"It's so gross. I don't even boil chicken for my cat - he gets his baked (then mixed with veggies and vitamins). There's so much flavor you can add with seasonings and vegetables that make the dish tastier and healthier but their idea of ""healthy food"" is boiled chicken or canned tuna, on top of some very sad lettuce and smothered in dressing."

My600lbLife,fdez2cz,t3_ekysr1,1578349652.0,Having some healthy relationships and support seems to help a lot too. Many of the ones with kids seem to be motivated by a desire to make sure they're around for them.
fuckeatingdisorders,fdeyx9y,t3_el0vtm,1578349564.0,"I find not having the things I typically binge on within easy access to help. I try not to buy foods that I binge on and if people bring them over, I toss them before I binge on them."

cats,fbdso7b,t3_ecnfj1,1576770436.0,"We're married and every night we have to do bed yoga adjusting ourselves so that the cat can be comfortable as he stretches out and then he wakes us up for cuddles a few times at least.

It's worth it though, because I've realized that as much as cats like cuddles, they like two person cuddles even more."
