GetMotivated,ffar8zx,t1_ffaq6wc,1579742623.0,You can delete and repost. But the sentiment stands. People reflect others most of the time. Spread positivity and that will be reflected. Spend time being negative and guess what that's what other people funnel your way.

Imagine if the military industrial complex shifted to the environmentally concious industrial complex. PR and publically traded stocks for such companies would sky rocket."
gaming,ffaqcjm,t3_eslk58,1579742016.0,"Yes, most likely. Its a system that adds depth to gameplay. Literally my favourite part of the game. I generally dislike the far cry/assassins creed model of towers and gameplay locks in an open world game. But this system in particular makes targets feel lively. 

Its like the Souls games influencing Fallen Order. There will be 2d and 3d games that embrace this emergent gameplay.

Hades is a game that uses this on a narrative level only. Repeat attempts in this roguelike game mock you with your previous failures. Not in a detrimental way but in a way that adds flavour."

Ya ok. Im going to spend more time and money to fix a common and known issue.

Thanks for the advice but fuck that. Im done. The majority of the times ive requested refunds theyve been denied. This is the ONLY game that issues happen on a regular basis and the burden of proof is on me. If i dont have timestamps or screenshots im fucked. 

Customer service at WotC is garbage. Just ask any  store that sells product

The Expanse does a good job showing what development would be like in low or zero gravity. The books atleast.  

Also when we're on death's door popping out any baby increases our species survival.

Abortion is difficult in all cases and relies solely on the autonomy of the mother. Stop trying to control other people and make yourself a better individual."
