AustralianPolitics,ffwanko,t1_ffw8zww,1580292728.0,Price is a silly argument. It will come down with time just like all the other technologies started high and came down (or more likely stayed about the same price but got more and more bandwidth). Line of sight will be overcome with more repeaters ect in the short term and probably something not invented right now long term. It's pretty unlikely that technology will plateau and no one will come up with work arounds

Or do you think you are more than that - like a soul or essence?"
AusFinance,ffegrxz,t1_ffec6qg,1579847404.0,"Simple. Say you turn over $100k with $50k profit. You pay $7467 in income tax on the $50k for a take home of $42,533. Now let's say you take 10k in cash. Suddenly you are paying $4467 for take home of $45,533 (after-tax income plus cash). Additionally you would be further entitled to lots of government benefits at $40k vs $50k. Easy to see how people earning lots more than $50k can massively benefit from taking relatively small amounts of cash (compared to turnover), because of tax brackets ect. Essentially they don't take all in cash, just enough to maximise take home on top of whatever tax write offs they can semi-legitimately think off. Honestly I would be surprised if a very large percentage of small businesses didn't do this to some extent. I have seen the account of many small ones (enquiring to buy) and many of them would be absolute rubbish without doing ripping off the taxman"

Foodforthought,fei7acs,t1_feh6h3i,1579131870.0,Yeah but in America you would just not of done most of the work because it would cost 100k+
AustralianPolitics,feel0xx,t1_fed2dev,1579035897.0,I think they have a fundamental misunderstanding of what insurance is. Or they are mixing up how they think things should be with the way things actually are.
AustralianPolitics,fed1dui,t1_fecp09l,1578993800.0,"Firstly, I own a furniture removal business, it doesn't cost anywhere near that much if you're sensible. Probably not even that much if you're an idiot. Secondly, literally millions of people are working outside of Syd/Melb. Don't be an arse. No point making 6 figures if you pay 4k a month on your $850k mortgage - if you can even get one. Plenty of nice houses in nice places for $400-600k..."
AmItheAsshole,fe18qaw,t1_fe0xr0h,1578823838.0,"It's an outsider looking in thing. Seriously, bring up the topic a few times with immigrants, Kiwis or backpackers for some interesting insight. Lots of things are said in Australia that are not socially acceptable overseas. Particularly in more ""working class"" suburbs and industries... When I first moved here in the late noughties I casually heard ""Abo's/Woggs/chinks"" and  other comments like Chingwood for Chatswood thrown around. There were heaps of others that I have forgotten. Also a lot of hate for Indians. It was massive cultural adjustment."
smallbusiness,fe10269,t1_fdz5dh5,1578820886.0,"I own a business. I'm not being funny but this is abhorrent to me... Seriously there are so many options that I would take that don't include not paying an employee. They have forced you to loan them money that you need to live when they are past the point of insolvency. There is no turning the company around from here. They are telling you what they want to believe - but hail Mary's like they are waiting for don't work out in real life 99.99% of the time. Like I can't stress enough how fucked they are. If I still thought I had a good operation and a temporary set back I would be selling assets, maxing out lines of credit, working Uber/Taxi/nay night shift casual work I could get to pay my guys. If they have already done all this and still can't pay then they are fucked. It's too late. By the time the money comes in they will be working to eat and pay their rent. What they are doing is fucking selfish"

Foodforthought,fcs9gke,t1_fcrr72x,1577913349.0,"Universal health care. The State is responsible for health care and state prisons. I'm pretty sure they employ health service nurses and doctors at the prison itself as opposed to an internal prison service, but I'm not 100% sure.  In the long run it doesn't matter as the State is responsible either way. We don't have jail/prison like US. Bail is usually given unless there are compelling reasons not to (likelihood of not attending trial, serious crimes, violent crimes very high likelihood of some sort of custodial sentence ect) and if refused you go to remand which is in an actual prison (with time in ramand taken into account during sentencing)."
Foodforthought,fcqd54m,t3_eibpop,1577883643.0,"Sometimes I read things about America and I think wow, that's amazing/incredible/awesome. Then I read shit like this I just shake my head in disbelief. In Australia, not even the most crazy right wing nut would think this is a good idea or outcome. I'm pretty sure the rest of the western world is the same"
FutureWhatIf,fc16q2y,t1_fc0w5vw,1577309832.0,"That's not how it works dude. Prices go up as a consequence of demand for something AND people having the resources to pay the higher price. Most households pay around 30% of their income to rent/mortgage/housing costs. If it goes up 1000 percent very few people could pay the price and then what is a landlord going to do? Sit on an empty house with no income? No they drop it to what the market can bare. Only way your thing makes sense is of income go up 1000%, in which case nothing spectacular changes"
