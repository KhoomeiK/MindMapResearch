ConquerorsBlade,ffbqovq,t3_esrlk6,1579778868.0,"Same for everyone. Matchmaking is not based on level but your seasonal rank, in laimens therms, there is no casual play other than VS Ai and you're immediately dropped into ranked.
But worry not, there are ways to enjoy the game as a newbie when dealing with aggressive odds.
As a new player you're handed tons of seige. Keep the blues and higher for layer, but go ham with the green seige. Whether you like defensive, ranged or ambush units, seige is great for assisting your units or luring players into your ambush.
Don't like seige? Then play team, look for the highest ranked player on your team and follow team. (Treat them as your psedo commander, which you will have in Territory War, but silent)
To find this player, look at the ranks. Early on everyone is green rank, the higher their number the better they are. It then goes blue and purple.
More of a solo player? Unfortunately you might be in the wrong genre. There are solo based classes like Dual Blade, Longbow and Halberd that are as effective alone as they are in teams. But the only solo units I'd recommend are golden era (Probably weeks worth of progression to unlock)"
