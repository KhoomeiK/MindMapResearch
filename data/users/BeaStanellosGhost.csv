If anyone knows how I can contact “Doze,” a Tauren warrior tank from Vek’nilash NA that’d be amazing. He was my tank idol back in BC (I assume he also played vanilla) and I recently made a Tauren tank in tribute to him. I’d love to talk to him"

classicwow,fdkxiue,t1_fdkcq32,1578513201.0,"Same with grobbulus it’s like 20% rpserver 80% pvp server. I’ve been here since launch. 

Non rp names are rampant; people with joke-names call you a nerd for rping/enforcing the rp server rules. Barely anyone takes the rp seriously. I’d be surprised if there were 10 horde rp guilds, I can name like 3 (I’m alliance); the rest are indistinguishable from your typical pvp server horde. Maybe 10% of the pop uses TRP3 (the wow roleplay profile addon) to be generous, feels like 5%. The top guilds on both sides have nothing to do with roleplay and I’ve never seen any of their members roleplaying once, but an obsidian council warlock sits at the IF battlemasters griefing people by spamming pet sound effects for hours on end. 

Ive thought of giving up on the rp aspect and transferring off if I had a decent pvp server for alliance. Grob feels mediocre in both fields rather than jack of all trades. “Rp-pvp servers have a mature community” was the biggest lie on reddit and also attracted a majority non-rper population. I thought RP would be the standard; instead it is opt-in / DIY."
