Moro, himself a popular far-right figure in the country, now serves in Bolsonaro's cabinet.

Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes issued an order last year banning the federal police from investigating Greenwald's role in the hacks.

""I'm afraid that is very much the message,"" the scholar said. ""That you better not elect a president who is a demagogue wannabe dictator because we don't have a good way of removing the president.""

Ultimately, Tribe said, the 2020 election may be the only way that Americans can see Trump removed for the crimes he has been accused of committing.

If Trump is acquitted in the Senate's impeachment hearing, but is removed by the American people, Tribe said, ""the message will be that you might be able to get away with murder briefly, but eventually, the American people will remove you."""
politics,ff6wbq3,t3_erzw2r,1579636221.0,"Indeed, in order to convict Trump of the charges connected to his bid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his 2020 political opponent Joe Biden, lawmakers would require a two-thirds supermajority in the Senate.

That means at least 67 senators would need to vote in favor of convicting Trump, which seems nearly impossible given that there are only 47 Democrats in the Chamber.

For Tribe, the impeachment trial was ""rigged"" before it even began because Republican senators, including McConnell, have made it clear ""from the beginning"" that they will defend the president, despite the fact that are ""supposed to be impartial.""

Voters, he said, will hopefully be able to recognize the role that party politics plays in a process that he said was ultimately flawed.

""I do think the Senate acquittal, which is almost inevitable will not seem to voters to be a genuine exoneration, not only because it won't be a genuine exoneration, but also because it was so obvious that it was rigged from the beginning by the people who were supposed to be impartial,"" he said.

If and when Trump is exonerated of the charges against him, Tribe said, ""it will send a message that if you have a president who has a very powerful and unprincipled ally leading the Senate and if the senator is in the president's own party, then the impeachment process is broken and will not work.""

""Therefore it is crucial to have at least a hope of having a Senate that is responsibly ready to check the president if the president goes off the rails,"" he said."
