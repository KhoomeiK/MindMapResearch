Some symptoms of the rise in suicide rates among American men include (but are not limited to) traditional beliefs about manhood conflicting with modern shifts in social roles toward women, the disconnect of men in media v. reality, the widespread availability of guns and other weapons of harm, a general pervasiveness of lack of purpose/direction in life, social expectations surrounding how men aren't allowed to have/express certain emotions, and many more. It's a superbly informative read, even if you're not a father, just an American male.
