Buffalo,ff9frox,t1_ff9do3j,1579712068.0,">So if you grow a plant for sale, are you paying 14 cents a gram only if you sell it to someone like that, or are you paying that amount because you grew that much, and you're supposed to be logging your crops, and NYS bases it off of that?

Based on the wording:

>The **cultivation** of cannabis is taxed at the rate

I would have to guess it's the latter part of your question. That it's taxed based on the time it's harvested, and logging is involved. This is probably to mitigate tax revenue loss from ""bad inventory"" that end up on the black market.

The other thing that hints at that is the next line of :

>The **sale** by any entity to a retail dispensary is taxed at a rate of 20 percent of the invoice price;

This also sounds like it should also help cut down on the number of middle men taking a cut."
