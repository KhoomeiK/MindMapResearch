Just want to be healthy, feel healthy and look healthy, people have to respect that.

The thing that keeps it all going I think is trust in each other (I have massive trust issues but I'm trying). I keep in mind that she loves me and cares for me and I want her to keep that too (lately she told me, that she knows that I love her and she can feel it, which made me glad).
