instant_regret,fedx9hd,t1_fecuvjv,1579021830.0,"Im from rural part of florida. Dad has a loaded gun behind every single door in the house and always has. It was a really bad neighborhood when i was a kid and we dont really have any police. I was taught from as far back as i can remember you dont touch those. Theyre not toys. And if i ever wandered too close to them, i got in massive trouble. When i was five i got my first pellet gun and i was taught gun safety and how to properly handle weapons. At six, i got my first shotgun. 

Just about everyone i grew up with had a similar experience. Irresponsible, yes, absolutely. But never knew a kid to touch one and shoot another kid or themselves. Lots of other dumbshit but nothing involving guns."
AskReddit,fedpq9y,t3_eo83cx,1579017217.0,"Id like to throw this story in here....im a bisexual ciswoman. 

Started dating a guy. Sweet, nerdy, fun. Said he wanted the same things as i did - married, house with the fence, 2.5 kids, and a dog. Yay! Everything is turning up roses, right? Well, for some reason he has some pretty bad difficulties in the bedroom - cant get up, cant stay up, cant cum. He claims its due to his size (and i believe him because he was not a skinny feller by any means) so he tells me not to worry about it because he is so satisfied and happy with how everything is regardless. Everything is going swimmingly otherwise. We move in together. Then his behavior starts to... degrade. He gets shifty and paranoid. If i go out with friends he gets jealous and cruel. Im thinking he was extremely controlling (and maybe cheating on me with the paranoia that was displayed) so i wanna get out this relationship. 

So i sit him down for a talk. We had been together four years. We were talking weddings and children.

He tells me hes trans, has been in therapy about it, wants to transition, doesnt want any of the things he said he did from the relationship (it was a all a lie - his words), and he didnt enjoy sex because he wanted a man and not a woman. Okay. Wow. But then says he doesn’t want to lose me so please stay. He loves me. I love him. We can work this out. 

I stay. He begins the transition to her. She is almost a completely different person to him. Its been almost a year. I still try to stay and make it work. We dont have any sexual contact as she isn’t interested at all. She buys a house two hours from where either of us work, in a horrific neighborhood, and ends the lease on our apartment. Angry, i swallow it down and soldier on. But then i see my gynecologist for my annual. My window for having children, if i want them still, is closing fast. I have a mini-mental breakdown in my car outside her office. Ive always wanted to be a mom. 

I approached her about marriage and maybe adopting or sperm donation. I am told i am selfish. She will never carry a child so how dare i flaunt my ability to do so in her face. All other discussion is shutdown. 

After many more months and tears, i told her i was leaving. She tells me im selfish for rushing her, for pushing her, for wanting things from her. She then turns my closest friend against me saying i was cheating on her the entire relationship and that im a bigot and transphobic. So now im alone - truly alone - and isolated from everyone.

Years of my life gone. Friends gone. Hopes and dreams shattered. All of which could have been different if i had been told “hey, im trans” from the beginning. 

Please tell someone youre trans before things get serious. Please, please, please."
EatCheapAndHealthy,febzpi4,t1_febw1jb,1578964660.0,I would suggest googling your exact location. I dont know where you live and there are a plethora of them in your state. If you just google mushroom farms near [insert your city name] I’m sure you can find one close to you.
EatCheapAndHealthy,febkohb,t1_feaxs68,1578959818.0,Connecticut has the north east’s largest mushroom farm.......
EatCheapAndHealthy,fe8rozg,t3_eo2bnf,1578929851.0,See if theres a local mushroom farm near you. The one closest to me sells theirs for $2 a bag which is about two pounds of mushrooms (usually they’ll give you an extra half pound around the holidays too).

An amazing song that just strikes all the right reality chords."

AskReddit,fdnyeua,t1_fdmglwr,1578595378.0,Thats what we did when i was a kid in Florida. We did t have any HVAC. It got to the 30s? Fire up the wood stove. It got to 98 with a heat index of 105? Here’s a fan and a wet washcloth. My parents got HVAC installed only after mom’s cancer took a turn for the worse and the doctor basically told them to for mom’s comfort. Mom’s been gone for about a decade now and Dad never turns the system on. Going to visit him in summer is miserable.

Its a good stepping stone (and you have top notch job security) but unless youre super passionate about the particular role youre in (like veterans benefits or human health resources or ems) there is little point in sticking around more than a couple of years.

So if i want to take two weeks of vacation, I usually have my boss okay me using the 3 sick time hours i need. He’s not supposed to do that so I’m grateful for his flexibility.
