And guess what: if the virus spreaded to Russia, I have no doubts these incompetent fucks in the Russian government won't be able to handle that. So, good luck China.

HistoryMemes,ffgqx2g,t1_fffhlgh,1579912784.0,"Yep. Soviets made a major mistake thinking this offensive could be made by Leningrad region alone. This led to many losses. However, few months later they switched to full scale war, brought lots of artillery and deleted Finnish defences."

Thus, no equipment malfunction, but sone really bad weather. Though I'm still surprised that Hind couldn't deal with the wind."
