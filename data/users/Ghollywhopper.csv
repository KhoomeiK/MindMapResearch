You just reminded me of a story hahaa.


I use to work for a large atm manufacture and they had a huge contract with a huge bank. So I'm out repairing a island atm at like 10 PM. I was already working super late and I wanted to get back to my lady friend at the time so I didn't call a security guard. So I have the vault open fixing the CDU and I see this shadow come over my shoulder.  So I whip around with my long ass screwdriver ready to stab this dude and I'm face to face with this goofy looking guy with his hands up while I have this wild look in my eye and he says



""Whoooooah just curious what you're doon here..."""
interestingasfuck,ff7quxd,t3_erz4hr,1579656143.0,"Hi ATM repair guy here.

If you ever find a skimmer on a ATM. Do not fuck with it. Some guys are very close to the skimmer and they paid money for that shit and if you a civilian take it. They will want it back.


Call the cops and be safe."

So her last night in the states. We go out and see a movie and I'm taking her back to her host family and we got out of the car to look at the stars in my small little town. I hug her goodbye and I remember her looking up at me. Like she wanted me to kiss her and I froze. I hugged her again and said bye.

And once they were out in the open I was able to meditate on them more.

So yes, this is a great idea I think. Just be cautious about not trying to slip into a weird emotional rabbit hole. Also avoid whiskey"
