unpopularopinion,fejkiiy,t3_ep9up9,1579177949.0,"I'm all for harm reduction and if legalisation leads to that them great.

Bud for god's sake stop making drugs into something cool and safe.  They are not and they are not.

The UK has a shitty attitude to alcohol and thankfully that is changing with people becoming more aware of the danger and more likely to condemn drunkeness but please don't introduce another drug into the mix.

Smokers seem to feel a need to pretend drugs are safe and positive for society.  

Society has so much to offer I really don't see how spending your days in a daze is any help to anyone. 

Let's not celebrate it.  Go look up the risks and if you consider yourself educated look up studies on Google scholar."

I'm a cyclist. 

Some cyclists, not us, get all worked up when we criticise the idiot ones.

I mean, it's quite likely there are going to be some idiots on bikes ( in cars and on foot. )

Calling out the idiots doesn't make everyone who rides a bike an idiot too.  

Obviously I'm not having a go at the good guys :)
