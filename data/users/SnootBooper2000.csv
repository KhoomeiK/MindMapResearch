Catswithjobs,ff9thow,t1_ff9sszt,1579720916.0,"Just to jump in here, the neighborhood I was talking about is a nice suburban one. The neighborhood has one stray cat that is taken care of by all the neighbors except this dude. The guy literally hates cats, apparently, and took it out on people’s pets that would innocently roam their safe street."
Catswithjobs,ff9nq1g,t1_ff93kbd,1579716826.0,"You’d be surprised. My friends neighbor started trapping the neighborhood cats to send to the pound because he didn’t like how many there were. Problem was he didn’t care which cats were pets and which were strays. Most of the cats he caught were people’s indoor/outdoor cats, including my friends. Couldn’t find him for days until they heard from another neighbor that the guy was doing this and they called the pound. Luckily they found him there unharmed, but had to pay $40 to get him back. They had to build an outdoor screen enclosure to keep their cats from being trapped again. Poor babies can’t roam anymore.

Now when people have to turn their cars around to park on the appropriate side of the street, they all go down further to use his driveway lol."
aww,ff9mucb,t1_ff9crmi,1579716303.0,"So apparently when my step-brother woke up out of his anesthesia, he became violent thinking the dentist was trying to kill him. He proceeded to run through the building, blood dripping out of his mouth and all down his shirt, accusing people of being in on it. Then tried to fight the dentist. Good times."

camping,fellviu,t1_feljal2,1579225285.0,Yeah you’d think that would be the case but he managed to score a good living situation that would have accommodated her well. Homie just wanted to get drunk and lazy lmao.
camping,fel4e81,t1_feks7cq,1579213813.0,"So my brother was supposed to take his dog to college with him but decided not to, (he claimed she would be happier with a yard but we think he wanted a more “bachelor” lifestyle). When he came home after the first three months for Thanksgiving she straight up ignored him. Funniest shit ever. The best part was a couple of hours after catching up, my brother took his stuff up to his room where he found a pile of shit in his bed. He looked totally shell-shocked when he came downstairs half in tears, half laughing - “She..pooped in my bed...”.

She is now 13 years old and has not before nor since this incident, shit in a bed.

She was happy as a clam for the rest of the visit. They know people, they know."

AskReddit,fdzmlna,t1_fdvvmtr,1578791754.0,What upsets me is I remember seeing him on Doctor Who and thought “He is a really good actor and it’s just a matter of time until he makes it big.” Then he did what Kevin Hart did which was attach himself to anything he was offered and now he’s super annoying. It’s a shame.

If you want to keep it, sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen, every day! I use neutrogena face sunscreen. (I go a bit overboard with 70+). Been using it for almost 8 years - acts as both a primer and sunscreen, and I swear by it.

I was hoping to find one a little less mystical looking and more like a TJ Maxx style, if that makes sense. The biggest reason I was pulling away from this, though, is it seems this Amazon option has run out of the color black, which is what I would have preferred over olive green."
