I will never understand this attitude. Sure, we have varying degrees of theft based on the value of the item stolen, but theft is theft. At what price point should I be able to steal with impunity? You see the same thing from the opposite side all the time as well. Just find any thread where people start talking about employment law and search for the term ""highly illegal."" There are varying degrees of crime, but illegal is illegal. There's not some magical threshold where an act suddenly becomes legal or illegal.

>and still got a disproportionate sentence

You don't know why he got that sentence, and neither do I. Maybe he's starving. Maybe he's a kleptomaniac. Maybe his friends dared him to do it. The guy I mentioned above had a livable income and multiple prior offenses, which is why he got 30 days. He had also turned down an offer for no jail time if he paid for the stolen lunch meat, although the judge wasn't aware of that part. He wasn't stealing to feed his family; he was stealing because he felt like eating some lunch meat and not paying for it.

>Hopefully me repeating exactly what was said in slightly different wording has helped your reading comprehension somewhat. I doubt it though.

clevercomebacks,fe3bg5g,t1_fe2d5oi,1578847746.0,"I would argue the opposite, but I think there's room for reasonable debate.

I'll start by saying that ""half"" takes on the number of the word it describes. In this case, that word is ""taxes"".

In this instance we're talking about a specific tax--the property tax. Depending on the intent of the writer it may be cumulative to the extent that it's the property tax paid by a number of individuals, but it's still a single tax. (In fact he said ""*our property taxes*"", so that's probably the intent.) As such, ""taxes"" should be considered singular.

Think about this: Would you normally say ""less taxes"" or ""fewer taxes"" in a similar context? ""I wish fewer of our property taxes went to education,"" vs, ""I wish less of our property taxes went to education""? IMHO ""less"" is correct, which indicates that ""taxes"" should be treated as singular. ""Less"" is used for mass nouns (which are treated as singular) while ""fewer"" is used for plurals.

Again, there's room for debate, I think. And in my previous paragraph you can fuck it all up again simply by removing the word ""property"" from the examples, because then it could be read as if multiple taxes (for instance, property, sales, and capital gains taxes) are currently used to fund education, and you want one or more of those dropped."

AskReddit,fd0y3db,t1_fd0ulxv,1578125330.0,"Okay, I will admit that if OP is a documented member of the Skastafari religious group (with the proper paperwork, of course) (and also, if Skastafari isn't a thing yet why isn't it?) that he did rightfully wear both his dreads and tie during work hours, and that his employer should have made reasonable accommodations."
AskReddit,fd0wgjo,t1_fd0un5z,1578124697.0,">You have 0 proof he is telling the truth, im not saying he is telling the truth but im not going saying this is not true see the distinction?

He's making the assertion. It's on him to provide the evidence. And for you to believe him is at best you saying that you'll believe whatever you're told, and at worst that you'll believe whatever you want. Both propositions are equally frightening.

I guess you're taking the middle ground of refusing to pick a side, which might be okay if it didn't involve crossing your fingers and hoping that someone would give you something to believe in.

Debate and discussion are great. Even taking the middle has its place. (Hell, I do it all the time myself. Answers are rarely found in extremes.) But lending credibility to someone who in his own argument discredits that argument seems like a bit of a folly."
AskReddit,fd0u1aa,t1_fd0qpp8,1578123751.0,"You're throwing your trust into a random stranger who says, (a) my CEO didn't like me because I had dreads, and (b) I admittedly knowingly violated the dress code, but you're choosing to believe that his/her issue was the dreads. No quotes or anything from the CEO. Just, ""CEO didn't like my hair.""

What if I told you that my boss fired me because my clothes weren't stylish enough, but you should ignore the fact that I show up late to work every day? Or to be a little more on point, maybe I was fired because I work in a factory and refuse to wear safety glasses? But I was totally fired because my clothes didn't fit my boss's liking, right?"
AskReddit,fd0piuo,t1_fd0oziz,1578122023.0,"No, that and all the other things I said make me not believe it. Most importantly the part where he admits to knowingly violating the rules but decides that there must be some other reason he's getting shit from the boss. But since you missed that in my comments that clearly pointed that out I'm guessing you also missed it in his."

AskReddit,fd0m7xf,t1_fd0l6wl,1578120777.0,"So you choose to believe the ""CEO thought I smoked drugs"" line despite the other inconsistencies and the fact that that line is basically a quote from a 70s after school special that doesn't understand how drugs, drug use, and even drug culture work? I don't think anyone beyond 1970s school counselors has talked about ""smoking drugs.""

Maybe I'm wrong, but I've never met a drug user who talks like that, and I've known dozens. Hell, probably hundreds or more."
AskReddit,fd0kv4q,t1_fd0k15z,1578120277.0,"Because the guy who is literally, like, seriously, guys, only hated by just the CEO and only because of his dreadlocks (but let's ignore the tie and shit that is admittedly against the rules, okay, guys? Because that just makes him cool.) is being totes honest about all of this.

Not hating on the guy I'm replying to, in case it isn't clear. OP above is just a douche with a tie."
