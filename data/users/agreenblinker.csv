Damn you time being a finite resource! I may have a desire to know, but my monkey brain prevents me from unlocking the mysteries of 5 dimensional travel."

Some level of communication would fix so many of these problems. I too feel like I am putting in quality work only to be banned 30-40 hits in.

If I am truly not up to snuff, let me know! Otherwise, acknowledge that the ban logarithm is broken and fix the thing while lifting the bans.

Whoever is behind the hits deserve quality work, but if I don't know what I am doing wrong, I cant correct my mistakes."
