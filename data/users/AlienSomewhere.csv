Although Hezbollah has denounced certain attacks on civilians, some people accuse the organization of the bombing of an Argentine synagogue in 1994. Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman, Marcelo Martinez Burgos, and their ""staff of some 45 people""[316]Â said that Hezbollah and their contacts in Iran were responsible for theÂ 1994 bombingÂ of a Jewish cultural center in Argentina, in which ""[e]ighty-five people were killed and more than 200 others injured.""[317]Â In June 2002, shortly after the Israeli government launchedÂ Operation Defensive Shield, Nasrallah gave a speech in which he defended and praised suicide bombings of Israeli targets by members of Palestinian groups for ""creating a deterrence and equalizing fear."" Nasrallah stated that ""in occupied Palestine, there is no difference between a soldier and a civilian, for they are all invaders, occupiers and usurpers of the land.""[48]"

I met her on a strip
It was another lost weekend
The band was too slick
And the people were twisted

So I asked her for a date
She reluctantly agreed
Then we went to my place
And she never did leave

She won't even miss me when she's gone
And that's okay with me I'll cry later on

It's been six months
She hasn't shut up once
I've tried to explain
She's driving me insane"
