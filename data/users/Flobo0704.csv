AskReddit,feux25a,t3_eqies2,1579390815.0,"This happened to me like 3 months ago.
I was at my dads flat with my brother. In the evening my brother left to go out with some friends, so I was home alone. I got myself something to eat, then walked in my room and closed the door. I started my Laptop to go online and chat with some friends. At some point, like 2 or 3 hours after my brother left, my Internet stopped working. Because of that I couldn't be on a call with them.
Then, suddenly while I was trying to figure out why my Laptop disconnected from the WiFi something knocks at the door. I thought it was my brother, giving me a sign that he's back home, so I just said hi, but didn't open the door.
Then, later that eve, I went in the kitchen to get sth. to drink. I realized that my brother wasn't home, so I thought he just came around to get anything, so I didn't worried about it.
About midnight, my brother gets home from his friend's house, so I asked him what he did when he was here an hour ago. Then he told me that he never came to get something.
That's were I got shocked. Someone or something knocked at my door while I was home alone. And no, there was no window opened, it was not the wind."

The only movie that comes to my mind that I like with him is Inglorious Bastards. And personally I don't really like his voice. But I guess that's just my opinion.
