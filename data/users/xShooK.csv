supercross,fezvv7e,t1_feztvm8,1579462330.0,"Okay, I see your point, he was committed, I still feel that level of contact on last lap isn't nearly as bad as him diving the corner on Craig so early in the main. Regardless though, I still think Lawrence should've just gave him the lead, I know the kid wanted his first win but his last few laps he was nearly wrecking himself all over the place. The contact in the corner didn't wreck him, it was close though."
supercross,fezplme,t1_fewiyqg,1579460069.0,"Idk I love jett and all but watching the highlights again I'm more mad about him taking out Craig, he didn't have the line at all. Jett lost it mentally before ferrandis was even close. Wrecked himself, then was wheeling out of whoops, and nearly endo. They made contact in the corner but Jett chose to go for the triple and cased it. Then he rode over his head trying to get his lead back, and endoed into the face of the jump. He made poor choices."

OP just doesn't strike me as some martyr for letting this child be swept under the rug for a mere 40 euros a month. Nothing do to with her until after her mother is dead and she's pregnant. Being wealthy, do her children have to work for financial help from the family? Just strikes me as OP always doing what's best / easiest for them, like help running after a 6 year old.

Classes do exist, and id suggest trying to find a beginner class. You don't need to get right onto a track after you learn to ride a bike either, can go put around a field, or trails, etc.

Edit: I just realized why you wanted a mountain bike. It actually might be beneficial to learn to ride a bicycle first, and I would start there."
