I thought the same thing about Mandarin, and will go back to it later, but the video we watched, it was too many vowels..  if that makes sense...  All the words seemed like nothing but vowels and it was very quick. Russian is easier because there's a clear beginning and end to the word and some are close to English. 

We found a 40 minute video of Russian nursery rhymes that he already started singing along to when it became repetitive. I like that more than the colors, numbers, items video.

It's called agent provocateur and it's documented in many peaceful protests.  Large anonymous groups of people are not within anyone's control and I would not consider them anything but a liability. You have no way to verify anyones intentions but your own. 

An agent provocateur (French for ""inciting agent"") is a person who commits or who acts to entice another person to commit an illegal or rash act or falsely implicate them in partaking in an illegal act, so as to ruin the reputation or entice legal action against the target or a group they belong to. An agent provocateur may be a member of a law enforcement agency acting out of their own sense of duty or under orders, or other entity. They may target any group, such as a peaceful protest or demonstration, a union, a political party or a company.

Prevention of infiltration by agents provocateurs, is part of the duty of demonstration marshals, also called stewards, deployed by organizers of large or controversial assemblies"

Being scared and not reacting with your body by running or fighting is not natural. You're telling your brain ""we have no way to get out of this situation"" and the anxiety gets even worse. Your brain just intensifies all the symptoms in an attempt to make you move. 

Exercise is the greatest anti anxiety medication. Exercise and think about something that makes you anxious and you will notice an increase in performance, run faster, lift heavier, have more stamina, etc. And your brain will get the signal that ""okay we got out of there, maybe the threat isn't really that bad now.  Next time it comes up we're not going to freak out as bad.""

getdisciplined,fdarclh,t3_ekb8nd,1578249231.0,"I've heard many times that to remember something you have to read it three times so unless you're going to read it two more times and maybe more for complicated matters, reading something once is mostly a distraction and at best, productive procrastination.  We need to get back to books"
PublicFreakout,fdaqiuh,t3_ekakd6,1578248966.0,People recording this stuff never know when to put their phone in their pocket.  You really gonna let them try to smack it out of your hand?  I gotta wonder how many phones are destroyed from this.  No self preservation lol

My friend just got a bunch of hardwood pallets to make a floor.  Each one is like 25 pounds and dry.  If you can find a source of free ones I'd go for that"
firewood,fcz2iw6,t1_fcyglmb,1578092354.0,"I gotta say most people leave branches and sticks behind if they're under 3 inches or so, and they do add up fast even though they suck to cut with a chainsaw it's pretty quick and easy with a miter saw.  You don't lose much to the kerf of the blade and there's no gas or bar and chain oil to mess with. It's no problem to burn them green either if you're mixing them with dry stuff"
firewood,fcz22qm,t1_fcyglmb,1578092105.0,What area are you in?  I'm having to make some hard choices on what wood to pick up now because it's everywhere.  Considering hiring a guy to split and stack ...  I'm trying to find a way to dry out wood chips and make some kind of metal tube with holes to  burn those in the stove then I can get cords of chips delivered for free in the spring.  We're lousy with wood over here in PA
firewood,fcycra6,t3_ejjvja,1578078152.0,There's pretty much nothing to do at this time of the year where I work so I'm cutting up small branches with a miter saw.  I've taken over a whole cord of logs out of here in the past month and the tree service left a bunch of locust..  my favorite
