The Italian cities still needed centralised states to actually levy the funds from the various merchants to finance their mercenaries, which ultimately is no different to how any other state in Europe operated during the time period. In any case, Italy's overall wealth was combined with the rough mountainous and wetland terrain of Northern Italy, their tendency to band together against external threats (League of Venice, Lombard League), and vested interests and power-balance amongst the great powers of Europe to maintain independence, rather than simply wealthy individuals raising armies for the defense of their city.

How so? If you agree with the theology of the Roman Catholic Church, you are a Roman Catholic. It's not like a union or something that you just take your name off the list and stop paying your membership fees or something, or a nation-state in that you can move to another country and naturalise. You can start going to a Lutheran church or whatever, but strictly speaking if you're Catholic you can't just jump ship to another church without sacrificing core beliefs such as veneration of the saints and Mary, decisions of the church councils, reconciliation, ordination of priests, etc. unless you start going to another ""national Catholic"" church like the Anglican or various Orthodox churches, which can introduce language barriers or are regionally dependent and still have some theological quibbles."
