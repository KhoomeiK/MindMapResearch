kitchener,ffem7g9,t1_ffc5fuz,1579854078.0,"Actually, transit vehicles can be surprisingly custom in design while looking awfully similar. Even using standard parts, due to design, the spacing and distance can be a lot different. Not to even speak of custom parts like the fare box.

That said, we aren't designing these from scratch, just modifying them to fit which can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days."
kitchener,ffelec9,t1_ffaklyy,1579852992.0,"Weekends and nights probably would end up costing quite a bit more.

Even then if we assume it takes approximately 2 hours to properly install barrier on a bus, 4-5 busses could be dealt with in a day. 

Working just on weekdays, about 100 busses could be fitted in a month.  [Considering around a total fleet of 300](https://www.grt.ca/en/about-grt/about-us.aspx) [(2,pdf)](https://www.grt.ca/en/about-grt/resources/GRT-Business-Plan-2017-2021.pdf). Accounting for unexpeted delays we can budget 14 weeks for this. 

You would need few days to talk with vendors, finalise a design and finalise on a deal. Let's give that a generous 8 weeks. Considering all the busses used by GRT are also used by other transit authorities and many of them already have barriers, design shouldn't be that hard to get down. 

Accounting for any additional delays, testing the design for a few days on limited busses to ensure it works with the GRT driver workflow, we can budget additional 4 weeks as misc. 

Even with that we arrive at around 6 months. Since the region is not going to start the process tomorrow and there might be some additional bureaucracy that we don't know of, we need to plan the installation so that things are smoothly running, they might pause the program to focus on other issues, installation may be spread out in smaller batches with a few days worth of gap between them, let's give them a whole 6 more months. 

Even with all that, we get one year! Three is a bit too much. A year to year and half sounds about right."

That is my understanding as well but my college uses .local domain to provide certain services which can either be accessed over VPN or while in college environment.

>It *is*, however, possible to convince resolved to forward `.local` queries to a DNS name server by explicitly configuring a  `.local` search domain for that link, in this case your VPN interface.

This is what I'm trying to accomplish.  Ive added local as search domain in addition to the default ones it gets through VPN (college's network). `systemd-resolve --status` shows local under DNS Domain. Yet even when i explicitly specify vpn0 as interface i have been unable to resolve `x.y.local`"
