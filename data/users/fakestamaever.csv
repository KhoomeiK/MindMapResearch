PublicFreakout,ff4v0p5,t1_ff41gk1,1579573102.0,"I could believe that there are more concussions and broken bones in cheerleading, but it seems like someone is hurt in every match. The match I saw was between two 13 year olds where both the winner and the loser were holding back tears at the end."
PublicFreakout,ff3sh2t,t3_ereir2,1579547878.0,I saw kids wrestle once and it was horrible. They’re all just hurting each other. I can’t imagine who would let their kid do this.
AskReddit,fez1ceo,t3_equ586,1579453003.0,It wasn’t going into his bank account. The value of his stock just went up. The amount of actual cash he has is probably relatively modest.
AmItheAsshole,few2e5d,t3_eqk9ht,1579404526.0,"NTA, obviously. This makes me intensely curious. Who made up this rule? How has no one objected before?"

todayilearned,fekk8xv,t1_fekfhzt,1579201797.0,"Kindof a gray area, but irrelevant seeing as we’re talking about confederate veterans and Japanese American internees."
todayilearned,fekd5x6,t1_fejxytw,1579197567.0,Most of the protections of the us constitution also apply to non citizens.
AskReddit,feic7nj,t3_ep464s,1579135101.0,"Officially, we already did change to the metric system. This kind of change is decided by people and society, not really a top-down government decree, at least in the United States."
politics,fei707b,t1_fei2paq,1579131689.0,"Again, appropriating would only be if I was using the phrase myself, instead of commenting on its use.

Where did you see me pretend to care about women and their claims? Again, I pointed out hypocrisy, I never once indicated a desire to get behind the “believe women” slogan. I’m not sure if you’re wildly mid-inferring what I’m saying or if you realize you’re wrong and are desperately trying to fit a round peg into a square hole to make it seem like you hadn’t made a mistake."
politics,fei0jy3,t1_fehzs8e,1579127661.0,"You’re using that word wrong again. I don’t think I’m virtue signaling either. What virtue am I signaling here? Maybe I’m wrong but I’m not doing any of the other stuff. Just because a buzzword exists doesn’t mean it’s always applicable.

In fact, it’s especially ironic that you’re accusing me of misunderstanding the “believe women” phrase when you are consistently misusing words."
politics,fehzdh9,t1_fehv8zv,1579126951.0,"I think that if that slogan means “believe women about rape, but otherwise it’s fair game to call them liars” then maybe the slogan is a little bit stupid and silly."
politics,fehv3zc,t1_fehta2s,1579124468.0,"It’s not appropriating to call someone out on their bullshit. You’re using that word incorrectly. It would only be appropriating if I were using that slogan myself, not pointing out that certain members of the left only believe in its tenets when it suits them."
politics,feh41f0,t3_ep2tbw,1579108698.0,"What happened to “believe women”, hypocrites?"

todayilearned,fdma7fk,t1_fdlwmng,1578543705.0,"Not exactly. Many people are denied conscientious objector status for various reasons, and depending on the war, conscientious objectors were still forced to perform non-combat duties or work in war industries."

todayilearned,fdkrepm,t1_fdkek41,1578509582.0,"Well I’m anti war but I’m also anti slavery, so supporting a draft also seems wrong to me."
AskReddit,fdkov0w,t3_elgpmo,1578508066.0,Sounds dystopian to me. What do they do to you if your yearly mental health exam finds you “unmutual” or something?
todayilearned,fdim68r,t1_fdhxv5f,1578445999.0,"Oh for sure, Morocco definitely has closer historical and cultural ties to say, Iraq, than South Africa."
todayilearned,fdhtcbu,t1_fdhf6ko,1578429794.0,"Well, North Africa and sub Saharan Africa have massive cultural and historic differences, as does Siberia and China, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.

And conversely, North Africa and the Middle East have massive cultural and historical roots together (that reach back much further than the association between north and South America).

I just don’t think your criteria holds."
todayilearned,fdhd0la,t1_fdh7ul8,1578420181.0,"Shouldn’t there be 4 then? (Or 3 if we’re not counting Antarctica). Asia and Africa are connected too. I could theoretically walk from Vladivostok to Cape Town just as easily as Alaska to Patagonia.

I think this is just tradition masquerading as having some sort of objective criteria behind it. The romans said that Africa, Asia, and Europe were separate continents (probably because they were vague as to what existed beyond the Black Sea) so we should too."
todayilearned,fdh23rx,t1_fdgmg2g,1578413720.0,"I don’t understand how Europe and Asia are different continents, but north and South America are the same one. How does the tiny isthmus of Panama connect a continent together but the vast stepped of Russia do not?"

Libertarian,fctscsa,t1_fcsethx,1577956975.0,"People that argue on reddit are getting so good at making arguments, that it's rare to see such a blatant example of an un-ironic strawman out in the wild. Thank you for doing your part to keep this fallacy alive."
politics,fctrzwx,t3_ein079,1577956451.0,"Uggghhh, here's Bernie Sanders praising the breadlines in the Soviet Union: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiM-yNEQ93I

He had his honeymoon in the Soviet Union and praised it.

I understand he's ""toning it down"" to run for president, but let's not pretend we all don't know what Bernie really is."

AskReddit,fc3bgmp,t1_fc3av03,1577386086.0,"I didn’t say men would be okay with it and women wouldn’t, although that’s significantly more likely to be true. I said that it’s not threatening for a woman to get naked in front of me. Consent is immaterial because they aren’t doing anything to someone else."
AskReddit,fc3a883,t1_fc2cr4j,1577385230.0,Let’s not forget that there are inherent differences between the sexes and that a naked woman is not threatening to a man in the same way that a naked man is when they’re alone with a woman.
AskReddit,fc364ww,t1_fc2ijiv,1577382386.0,Nothing you just said seems like a negative to me. Non violent offenders aren’t clogging up the prisons? People aren’t getting shot in illicit drug deals? Sign America up!
