futanari,ffhfhy4,t1_ffgl165,1579933066.0,"No, in fact it doesn't, because someone has intentionally removed the artist signature and link from the bottom-right corner."
futanari,ffhep59,t1_ffg1dk1,1579932159.0,"Much higher resolution found in the pixiv link, in case anyone is interested. 3401x3015 pixels."

Futadomworld,ffd9p3g,t3_et02vb,1579816178.0,"> When mother warned me not to fall in love with any males I bind, she really understated how hard it is to avoid that. At first I looked to him as like a pet. You feed him, you take care of his very simple needs, and he asks nothing in return.

> Well we all love our pets, don't we? And I love him a little too much. I've been spoiling him more and more, until now I even wear the same cute maid uniform at home as he does, all to make him happy.

GodofWar,ff8q3rt,t3_es7mby,1579691299.0,"After flipping the temple, instead of climbing up to it, turn back to this thing. Light the crystal and turn it around until you trigger the unlock mechanism to reach some loot on both sides."
GodofWar,ff8pnyw,t3_es8bu2,1579690677.0,"I hadn't tried New Game + when it came out, and only played with it this year. The quintuple Valhalla attack was overkill, even without removing the announcement. Is this what people faced in GMGoW difficulty?"
futanari,ff8efyk,t3_ercqpk,1579675011.0,"The link doesn't work until i removed the `?s=19` at the end. Not sure why, but it tells me the tweet is unavailable."

PrequelMemes,feomcp3,t3_eq0pzh,1579302088.0,The way reddit counts votes is really weird. You often see impossible percentages for the total number of votes. As in you literally cannot distribute the total votes in a way that will result in such a ratio.

doctorwho,feojuog,t1_fenca0p,1579301152.0,"Seriously, though! I connected my phone to the mall WiFi and instantly started getting Chrome popping up with some Russian gaming site. Had to do a factory reset to purge the virus."

AyyMD,femy5qs,t3_epyb61,1579272630.0,They'll be back eventually. It's not like they can't hire all the best engineers or buy a license to the manufacturing process that they're lagging behind on. It's just a matter of swallowing a bit of pride.
