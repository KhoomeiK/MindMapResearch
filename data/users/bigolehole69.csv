streetwearstartup,fex7tyd,t1_fewgcc7,1579426423.0,"From a purely aesthetic standpoint it looks great. I don't think this kind of pop art (for lack of a better term) needs much in terms of reasoning. It just is. If you like it, buy it. If not, no biggie. at least that's how I view a shirt like this. 

It won't be scrutinized for very long, it'll probably be viewed in flashes by the wearer and whoever is around. so if it has some interesting features and cohesive design then it works. The theme of this is more color, texture, and form based and it's less about actual substance.

Since it's getting such a reaction from people on here it seems to be doing it's job.

Cheers.

depression,fe4jwpm,t1_fe2cy5q,1578860119.0,"They'll still feel guilt because they didn't see it coming or weren't able to get you the help you needed. I too have thought about it way more times than I'd care to admit. Eventually I spoke to my family/friends about it and realized just how much guilt would fall on them. 

Whenever a tragedy takes place everyone's first instinct to see how they could've prevented it. Please do not do this to your loved ones. If the noise becomed unbearably loud seek a medical professional. In my experience it's not curable but you can turn down the volume on it and it makes life tremendously easier as long as you consistently go to therapy.

I love you and wish you the best. Please consider what I've said. Thank you.

Where i live it's very flat (without mountains or hills) and this is exactly what a plane flying away from you looks like.

I would say the movement was unusual with that branch in the foreground, but that assumes the branch was perfectly still which is highly unlikely since it looks so thin a light breeze could easily disrupt it (which it did).

If OP thinks they saw a UFO or UAP then that's perfectly fine and i respect their experience of reality. I was not there so i do not know. But I'm just not convinced that's what I'm looking at."
