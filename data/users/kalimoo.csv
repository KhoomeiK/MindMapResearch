AskWomen,fdtuew2,t3_emzznx,1578722368.0,"I work at an outdoor museum and we have a bunch of cats living there (we feed them and take them to the vets) and they were introducing me to all of them. Suddenly this grey and white cat RUNS to me and sits at my feet waiting to be petted. I asked what her name was and was told she didn‚Äôt belong to them, but was just a neighborhood cat. So I called her Nice Cat. Later, we find out she had kittens and we spent time trying to find homes for them all. I asked my coworkers why we‚Äôre finding homes for them when her owners should be? Turns out they left without her and she‚Äôs been sleeping in their empty house. We found homes for all the kittens (2 of them went to my best friends and I see them all the time) and they said they needed to find a home for her as well. I volunteered even tho my place doesn‚Äôt allow pets, because I already loved her so much. I end up taking her home and she becomes my first pet that‚Äôs all my own. I named her Toast, and turns out she‚Äôs actually more than just a Nice Cat, she‚Äôs the Nicest Cat. She runs to me any time I cry, lays on my chest and purs during a panic attack, and won‚Äôt leave my side until she sees I‚Äôm better or that I‚Äôm talking to someone (in person or on the phone). She has never scratched me except for on accident when we‚Äôre playing, and once she knows she hurt me she stops and licks me. She lets me hold and hug her for as long as I need, and when she‚Äôs done she just lets out a small meow, and that‚Äôs it. Even when I‚Äôm cutting her nails all she does is wiggle to try to get away, but has never tried to hurt me. Right now she‚Äôs purring on my stomach and kneading. She‚Äôs the best thing I could‚Äôve asked for and I honestly don‚Äôt think I could have made it through this year alive without her. I‚Äôm so sorry about your baby, I know how much they mean to us, but thank you for giving them such a loving home! And I hope you get to do that again with another wonderful kitty.

Maybe not everyone in the traditional sense, but today their are so many ways to connect with people, like online or through a video game or at a convention, it‚Äôs easier than ever for people to meet others like them.

But even after taking care of your kid, she helped you with your work event because apparently you can‚Äôt problem solve on your own. THEN you were too damn lazy to move dishes around and went to the freezer. ANOTHER THING that no one seems to be pointing out is how didn‚Äôt you know about the lasagna? Like you‚Äôd think the lasagna her dead grandmother made would have been brought up before, which means you either don‚Äôt pay attention to your family or they don‚Äôt feel like they can tell you stuff. And THEN she‚Äôs grieving and you act like she‚Äôs overreacting. Even if she was, her feelings are valid, and you need to understand people process stuff differently. It‚Äôs not about the food, it‚Äôs about one last memory she could share with her mother about her grandma. You‚Äôre such an asshole and you better learn to take responsibility for yourself and your mistakes because you sound like a man child"
