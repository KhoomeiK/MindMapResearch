I can see where your sister is coming from but as someone with an unused wedding dress in my closet, the thought of my sister wearing the dress I fell in love with really hurts to think about. I think it’s harder to picture why this would hurt so much until you’re in that situation. I would explain to your sister that seeing her walk down the aisle in the dress that you were supposed to be wearing on the happiest day of your life would be crushing and would ruin the day for you, when you just want the day to be about her. I’m sorry this happened :("

AskWomen,ff36fj5,t3_er9dfc,1579534802.0,"Friends. I enjoyed it when I was younger but never watched the full thing though. Then in college I decided I needed a feel good show to binge, and I knew it was so beloved that I needed to get the references. Maybe it was funny in the 90s but the humor is SO outdated and so many of the jokes rely on offensive humor. “Haha Monica used to be fat” “Haha Chandler’s dad wants to be a woman” “Haha Ross is a misogynistic controlling narcissist” like I might have been able to enjoy it a bit more but I HATED Ross with my whole heart. He never did anything right and was whiny and blamed everything on other people. Also he got mad that his son was playing with a Barbie. Like chill the fuck out dude"

Then we found out she was pregnant and was sleeping in the abandoned house of her last owners :( so we found homes for all her babies and then I ended up adopting her because she was so sweet.

And my professor hated having to tell people this rule because we’re adults and that rule is 1. In the syllabus, 2. Enforced throughout the building and she was working on her Master’s so she DEF heard the rule already so after a few times he was like: hey you know you can’t bring coke in here right? Only water. It’s like the one rule of this building. And she was like oh yeah ok! AND THEN STILL BROUGHT COKE IN EXCEPT LIGHTLY HID IT BEHIND HER BAG BUT STILL DRANK FROM IT IN CLASS.

I still have my bad days, but my good days make it worth it. If you can get on antidepressants or go to therapy I definitely would!

AskWomen,fdtuew2,t3_emzznx,1578722368.0,"I work at an outdoor museum and we have a bunch of cats living there (we feed them and take them to the vets) and they were introducing me to all of them. Suddenly this grey and white cat RUNS to me and sits at my feet waiting to be petted. I asked what her name was and was told she didn’t belong to them, but was just a neighborhood cat. So I called her Nice Cat. Later, we find out she had kittens and we spent time trying to find homes for them all. I asked my coworkers why we’re finding homes for them when her owners should be? Turns out they left without her and she’s been sleeping in their empty house. We found homes for all the kittens (2 of them went to my best friends and I see them all the time) and they said they needed to find a home for her as well. I volunteered even tho my place doesn’t allow pets, because I already loved her so much. I end up taking her home and she becomes my first pet that’s all my own. I named her Toast, and turns out she’s actually more than just a Nice Cat, she’s the Nicest Cat. She runs to me any time I cry, lays on my chest and purs during a panic attack, and won’t leave my side until she sees I’m better or that I’m talking to someone (in person or on the phone). She has never scratched me except for on accident when we’re playing, and once she knows she hurt me she stops and licks me. She lets me hold and hug her for as long as I need, and when she’s done she just lets out a small meow, and that’s it. Even when I’m cutting her nails all she does is wiggle to try to get away, but has never tried to hurt me. Right now she’s purring on my stomach and kneading. She’s the best thing I could’ve asked for and I honestly don’t think I could have made it through this year alive without her. I’m so sorry about your baby, I know how much they mean to us, but thank you for giving them such a loving home! And I hope you get to do that again with another wonderful kitty. Stay strong knowing your kitty passed feeling loved and protected 💕💕"

It’s just easier to get along with people who are immediately comfortable with you. Even as an introvert I recognize that extroverts will have an advantage making friends. Maybe you’re used to seeing conventionally attractive people dominating our social culture, but all kinds of people are capable of forming meaningful relationships. Maybe not everyone in the traditional sense, but today their are so many ways to connect with people, like online or through a video game or at a convention, it’s easier than ever for people to meet others like them. You can say people don’t like you because your awkward, but it seems to me people wouldn’t like you because you’re negative and assume the worst of others"

BadMensAnatomy,fdkcycu,t3_els5h9,1578501243.0,"As a fat woman this pisses me off? Mostly it means that it’s harder for women to build up muscle as fast as men. But women still do it. And there are genetics that make it easier for some people to lose weight and achieve a certain body type, but that doesn’t stop people from being able to be healthy. My mother and sister were super skinny while I was in high school and I was chubby but was doing sports everyday and eating healthy. If you look at pics of me from high school, I’m definitely not the smallest, but I do look healthy, and I only thought I was fat because of comparing myself to others. Through college I gained a lot of weight, and it sucks, but now I have the time to work on getting back to a healthy weight.

AmItheAsshole,fdg1hio,t3_el32ez,1578376571.0,"YTA. Omg. If you and your wife couldn’t make something you literally could have bought something from the store real quick. But even after taking care of your kid, she helped you with your work event because apparently you can’t problem solve on your own. THEN you were too damn lazy to move dishes around and went to the freezer. ANOTHER THING that no one seems to be pointing out is how didn’t you know about the lasagna? Like you’d think the lasagna her dead grandmother made would have been brought up before, which means you either don’t pay attention to your family or they don’t feel like they can tell you stuff. And THEN she’s grieving and you act like she’s overreacting. Even if she was, her feelings are valid, and you need to understand people process stuff differently. It’s not about the food, it’s about one last memory she could share with her mother about her grandma. You’re such an asshole and you better learn to take responsibility for yourself and your mistakes because you sound like a man child"
