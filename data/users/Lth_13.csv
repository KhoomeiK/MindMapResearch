onejob,feayeo6,t1_feaj1ge,1578953518.0,"You are trying to hold the current population of Britain accountable for the actions of others in the past, something which is arguably outlawed by article 33 of the geneva convention: “No protected person may be punished for any offense he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited”. By saying that calling brexit “british independence day” disrespects other countries who had to fight for independence from Britain you are saying that the current population of Britain were responsible for the violent revolutions of the history, something which is untrue.


I would also like to point out that the term “independence day” is not inherently linked to violent revolution. Many countries achieved independence peacefully from colonial powers (including Britain) and refer to the day that they achieved independence as independence day. By your logic these countries should be made to change the name for their day of independence because nobody died during the process."
