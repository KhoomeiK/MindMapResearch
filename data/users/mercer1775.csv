 Tesla is a great example of the type of company i'm talking about. Fuck subsidzing the oil industry, divert that money towards battery development or new types of solar panels etc. If companies like Tesla start popping out of the woodwork with revolutionary designs the fossil fuel industry will simply be made irrelevant. 

But they need to be given the money in order to take risks and experiment. By increasing costs via a tax you're doing the direct opposite. You're crippling people from entering the market (ie the next Elon Musk) and ensuring big oil are the oil companies large enough to survive and thus can dictate the weaning off of fossil fuels at their leisure."

It allows the poorest of society to still receive care but also allows an option to pay a premium if mr money bags want to skip the line. This premium can then be partially used to supplement any deficits in the public system.

Also, if private hospitals do great work for low fees then it forces public hospitals to do better which is *exactly* what we need - fuck ""hallway medicine"". Conversely if public hospitals are fast and efficient then there's no need for private hospitals so the private entities would be force to keep prices low too in order to compete.

It was this unflinching, rock-solid support from Germany that gave Austria-Hungary the confidence to send her armies into Serbia. Had Germany refused, it's extremely unlikely the Austro-Hungarians would've declared war since they'd be fighting alone against Serbia and Russia.

worldnews,fcrhr0y,t1_fcqyg6q,1577901978.0,"Why're you commenting about ""right wing mania"" on a thread about *Communist* China. Unless you honestly don't believe that quasi-communists are left-wing?

The problem with the modern left (and right) is people like yourself think who equate anything bad as being the position of the other side. Sorry to burst your bubble but people on the left are just as capable of evil as people on the right, the communist chinese are a great example of this.

We beat back the fascists under Germany last century and now it appears it's our time to take on the Communists under China.

Unless you honestly believe women don't judge people based on their appearance? Or do you believe they do but they just magically stop when they divine a man is of high-status?"

I said in my original comment theres 3 types of economies; varying types of free markets, fascism and communism

>Well there's only command economies and varying forms of free market economies. So unless you're a fascist, you're a communist

You then pointed out that [aKsHuALly](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/665/DpQ9YJl.png) there's variations of free markets (as I already said).

And lmfao how tf can you oppose both markets *and* central planning, who decides prices in this fantasy land?"
science,fcqwxoh,t3_eihvok,1577893467.0,"Pretty small sample size for such sweeping conclusions, plus no mention of the specific demographics being studied. 

Also I don't buy that there's no similar pattern in women. Women aren't divine beings, they're human too and are just as suceptible to the charms of physical attractiveness as the rest of us.

Just look at womens' reactions to George Clooney and Jake Gyllenhall vs someone like Mitt Romney ffs. 

 A far better example would be a comparison between the pure level of *hate* Canada's last conservative front runner got in contrast to how women fawn over Trudeau. Scheer was a complete dolt but the majority of the hate for him came down on his [appearance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Scheer#/media/File%3AAndrew_Scheer_portrait_style.jpg) not his policies.

You couldn't go into a thread about him without running into nonsense about him being another ""pasty white guy"" and ""looking evil"". So unless the researchers purposefully excluded any negative biases as ""social justice"" then I don't buy this study for a second."

MilitaryPorn,fcm9w0i,t1_fcl9d4b,1577768201.0,"SWAT isn't accurate because it's still your local Police Department's unit. Units like the FBI HRT, Russian Alfa, etc. are the federal equivalent and thus have *far* more training and expertise.

They also have different mission parameters. SWAT generally responds to any serious armed conflict local PD runs into. In contrast these units generally only respond to terrorist incidents and other potential mass casualty events. SWAT may still show up on those scenes but once the tier-1 guys show up they'd take over.

Tier-1 just means they're the best of the best and up there in terms of training and skill with special forces troops. FBI HRT is the FBI's hostage rescue team and Russian Alfa is the counter-terror arm of Russia's FSB (basically their FBI).

Then after ww2 they occupied and oppressed the peoples of Romania, Hungary, Moldova, Bulgaria, Czechia, Slovakia and Germany for *50 years*. 

Communist states have also been some of the most genocidal and barbaric regimes in history e.g. the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot. Who infamously mandated that anyone wearing glasses was to be killed becsuse they were an ""intellectual"".

Then once you start talking to them you can come to a compromise or maybe even both sides present evidence and you convince them you're right.
