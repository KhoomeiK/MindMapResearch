An Evangelical can be a person of pure faith with good intentions. I grew up around people with deep faith and they would have never supported this trash bag president. Today it's common to associate the horror show we see on TV of nut bags selling fear to subdue the masses with Evangelicals but those people aren't Christians, they're sales people. They use religion and politics for their own comfort. They are the poison well of humanity. We need to call them what they are, extremists and in some cases terrorists. They are sick. 

Side note, if you want to really get yer freak on consider that while trump may claim to be chosen (he's not) there are several Biblical portents happening that are whipping the evangelics into a fervor - in particular the locusts in Africa. Pompeo and Pence are both apocalypse [enablers](https://www.rawstory.com/2019/01/mike-pence-mike-pompeo-belong-doomsday-cult-may-trying-bring-apocalypse/). Rewind the clock back to Sarah Palin and even further to people in the Reagan WH and you can see a long subtext that centers around gaining and then using power to crest an apocalypse.
