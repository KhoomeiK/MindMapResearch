I never let it happen again though :)"

CasualConversation,ffjb81q,t1_ffj6jny,1579994652.0,"There are 4 ways to get coins: 

1) Subscribe to reddit premium, and you get 700 per month. That cost $7 a month, and on top of the coins, reddit is ad free, there is a lounge for premium users, which I admittedly have never used. 

2) When your comment is awarded, you get coins! Except for silver, you dont get anything for that...just a nice little pat on the back LOL. When you get gold, platinum, baby snoo, yadda yadda, you get a anywhere from 100-1800 coins depending on the award. You also get reddit premium, same as with coins, the time varies with the level of the award. 

3) Reddit will gift you coins for being a contributing member! It's only happened to me once though, and if I recall correctly it was 250 coins. 

4) You can buy them! They have different size packets you can buy, they range in price from $5 to $100, and sometimes they even have sales :) 

I hope that helps! Lemme know if you have another question."

CasualConversation,fficbck,t1_ffi9o60,1579970472.0,"You get a notification. It's not really ""giving away money"", like you're just making it rain with dollar bills or something. Also, we're strangers, but not in a weird way, we're also redditors engaging in conversation with each other. So, if someone makes a particular good point/its funny and you feel like it's more than an upvote, then award it. Also, when you have a sub, you get coins every month, might as well use them. People also use awards to get a comment/post more attention. There's a myriad of reasons to award a comment/post."

It was basically, wake up, breakfast, meds, gossip, group, uno, color, lunch, meds, group, gossip, uno, color, dinner, meds, gossip, uno.

Kind of makes it sound monotonous and like it doesn't work, but being in the hospital is what gets me back in line and I always come out better. This subreddit is a place where we can all relate online. Psych ward is a place where literally everyone around is like you, and theres a healing vibe about that. For me."

Yall, FYI. Mork was rescued from the meat trade in China. Yes, you read that right, MEAT TRADE. He is the product of irresponsible breeding and we should NEVER try to make another Mork. He has a list of health problems, but road dogs is doing everything possible to help him and give him a beautiful life. So grateful to them and slaughterhouse survivors! My goal is to get to China and volunteer with these wonderful ladies!!"

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffa8xu3,t3_esh3rn,1579730189.0,I used to live in an island and sea foam would fly up into the seawall during rough storms. It was kind of adorable. Fairy tale like. This does not look anything like that.

The first point they speak about is neutering/spaying each and every dog. Rescue work is never, EVER about funds being made."

bigboobproblems,fekrdzn,t3_epimds,1579206034.0,"I honestly can't even remember who said it, but it was somewhere on the internet. (Of course) 

 They said that I had ""sloppy tits"". At first I didn't even know wtf they meant, but I processed it and (I guess) they were referring to how much movement they have. 

In an age of silicone/saline I realize that yes, my tits move. It ""got"" me in the moment, but when I thought about it a little more, I was like, I have big boobs and they're real. They're going to move and they're going to change shape through the years. I'm ok with that. In fact I'm great with it. So, thanks rando who I cant even specifically recall. My tits are real, therefore behaving sloppy, and makes them pretty fun :D"
