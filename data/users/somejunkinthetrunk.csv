One of the best dogs ever, slobbery squish of love is missed."
dogs,fehb106,t3_ep5ems,1579112857.0,"My late basset hound would instinctively know when the downstairs water bowl (1 of 3 in the house) would be off or empty. He would wait till the middle of the night to express his displeasure by letting out a mildly irritated whine every 10-20 minutes. Just enough time to fall back to sleep only to be woken up again. His bed was literally 10 inches from another full water bowl, but  it was apparently inferior. If I woke up fully and went downstairs and filled the bowl, he wouldn’t even bother to go drink from it - but the whine would stop."
lupus,f7gspng,t3_dvofw5,1573715738.0,"I have SLE and my rash is not typical. It covers my nose and cheeks, chin, forehead, scalp, eyelids, ears, front and back of neck, arms and hands. If I have a stressful day, go out in the sun, or even just get hot; it will flare bright red and will burn and itch. If I avoid everything it calms down and can be barely noticeable. In the last year I’ve trialed 6 different meds and the only thing to help was a kenalog injection, relief lasted 2 weeks before it came back. Docs and biopsy confirm it is indeed lupus rash just a severe presentation. 

So track your symptoms, take photos when you notice changes (because that doctor appointment will last a few minutes and you don’t know how it will present that particular day), and try to be as patient as you can."
