europe,fedgsma,t1_fedcvq3,1579011120.0,"I quote from [http://www.businessdictionary.com/article/1030/communism-vs-socialism-d1412/](http://www.businessdictionary.com/article/1030/communism-vs-socialism-d1412/)  :

""*While there are certainly key similarities in the philosophy's of  Communism and Socialism, there are differences that make considering  them interchangeable incorrect. The most fundamental difference is that  under Communism individuals are provided for or compensated based on  their needs, in effect meaning that in a true communist system you  wouldn't have money and you'd simply be given what the government thinks  you need in terms of food, clothing, accommodation, etc. Central to  socialism is that individuals are compensated for based on their  individual contribution, so people that work harder or smarter would  receive more than those that don't contribute. This difference  highlights a key flaw in the Communist model, where no one has any  motivation to work harder or smarter as it would have no impact or  benefit for them.*

* *Communism  views all property as being public property and effectively there is no  personal property or items held by individuals. Socialism rather sees  individuals still having their personal property but all industrial and  production capacity would be communally owned and managed by consensus  or government.*
* *Socialism is at its core an economic philosophy,  whereas Communism is economic and political in its requirement that  government be the central owner and decision maker in all matters.*
* *Communism  rejects any religion and in a true Communist state religion is  effectively abolished. As Socialism is economic only in its focus,  freedom of religion is allowed, though some interpretations see it as  promoting secularism in its nature (even if religion is not effectively  banned).*
* *Communism sees the complete abolishment of class  distinctions as everyone is effectively treated the same. Socialism sees  a diminishment here but class distinctions would still exist as there  is capacity for some to achieve more wealth than others.*
* *Communism  sees the transition from Capitalism as being a violent revolution where  the existing system is effectively destroyed as the workers rise up  against the middle and upper classes. Socialism rather sees a gradual  transition from capitalism through legal and political processes that  see everyone essentially being treated equally at birth. People would  still have the ability to excel and enter the equivalent of the middle  class, but their children would have to work just as hard as they did to  achieve the same.*"""
