Any animal can be made aggressive, it’s pit bulls physical makeup that makes people make them aggressive."

And the issue with your point is you’re assuming that dog fighters controlled and bred all pitbulls, when in reality at least in the US, Pitbulls were literally the quintessential American house pet until the early 1900s, they were used far more often as dogs living in the house with the family for protection, as well as to protect herds from animals that herding dogs were too small to fight off"
