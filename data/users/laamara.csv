Breath_of_the_Wild,feg6aay,t3_eorpug,1579078956.0,Fyi to new players (as I recently found out) it does break in the literal sense (smashes to bits like any other weapon) and then it resets in your inventory. I legit freaked out the first time cause I kept googling and all I got was that it doesn't break but these technicalities drive me insane. Yes it fucking shatters but nobody in their review blogs would say that!!! ^I ^was ^panicking ^the ^whole ^day ^but ^I ^was ^too ^scared ^to ^ask ^on ^here
