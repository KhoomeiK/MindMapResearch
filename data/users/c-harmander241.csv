depression,fejdioy,t1_fejb8hw,1579168710.0,"It can but to be old and wise you must first be young and stupid. My advice to you is if you don‚Äôt like your job, start looking for another and if you don‚Äôt like that job try another till you find something that motivates you every morning. And as for responsibilities, they‚Äôre overrated but it‚Äôs a lot easier to do them if you work them into daily habits. 

I know overly happily go lucky messages can make depression feel worse so I hope I haven‚Äôt done that here, but if I have and all this advice is useless then let me recommend a book;‚Äùthe book of joy‚Äù lame title I know but honestly this book got me out of the worst of times and honestly I‚Äôve had it for 3-4years and I never finished it, but I thought about and still think about a lot of things it discusses, I really cannot recommend it enough"
LifeAdvice,fej2ceo,t3_epbmve,1579154311.0,"I felt like this for a long time too and still sorta do, honestly it starts with small habits like making your bed every morning and setting out work clothes, then when you‚Äôre ready start reading, maybe fiction if it interests you and slowly transition to a non-fiction topic that you‚Äôre interested in and it might provide some inspiration for things to do or directions to head.

I strongly recommend ‚Äúthe book of joy‚Äù it really helps redefine a meaningful life. And because of it I find the most meaning in my life by helping others üôÇ"
