Anxiety,feg9ali,t3_eojtrm,1579083234.0,I do it too. Come up with a big well thought out reply and backspaced it away. It's a way of venting without the blow back.
depression,feg97ln,t3_eor2wz,1579083114.0,We get to pick our friends. Move on. Live your life for you and people that support you.
depression,feg8y2j,t3_eox429,1579082740.0,"So sorry for your loss. 

Every time I get in to my head about my dogs dying I remind my self if they out lived me where would they go? Would they be cared for? No one could tell them where I went so would they think I abandoned them? 

So after crawling out of that rabbit hole I go on loving them every day I can while I can and enjoy their loving company."
depression,fecz2ng,t3_eofgoa,1578990613.0,"My wife, mom and two dogs. That's it."
depression,fd2gpyd,t3_ejw74l,1578146971.0,You have endless potential and plenty of time.
depression,fd23pte,t3_ejvl2u,1578141203.0,I've been sending out resumes but hope nobody calls me. I have savings to live on but why would I just sit around if I can work? WTF
Anxiety,fd232z0,t3_ejvcum,1578140929.0,I never wanted to be dependent on drugs. For pain or anything. But when anxiety hit me hard last Fall I would have eaten shit to feel better. So I went to my doctor for help and I am better. It is due to thyroid disease so I hope I can be drug free once my thyroid is either removed or maintained but until then I am happy for the relief. Don't worry what others think of you either. They don't like in your skin.
depression,fd229z6,t3_ejvnb1,1578140559.0,"Live for her. Do well for her. Be happy, for her."
depression,fczumt4,t3_ejnao7,1578108897.0,"Well I wrote a TL;DR and backspaced to post this. 

And I tried to write a PS but deleted it."
socialanxiety,fcu38a9,t3_eiw45t,1577971225.0,I do nothing and still fuck it up.
cannabis,fcu36fk,t3_eiuct8,1577971172.0,We're all the same. Just that certain gene that makes people think Trump is anything but a dotard.
Anxiety,fcu30e1,t3_eitvoe,1577971003.0,I was going through some bad anxiety that started when I stopped my thyroid meds and then started back on them. Full blown panic. Pacing the house nonstop all day. Could. not. sleep. Followed my wife around like I was a puppy. It was unbearable. My meds have gotten me back on track. Please do whatever it takes to get better. I would not wish high anxiety on my worst enemy.
Anxiety,fcu2gh2,t3_eit1wh,1577970432.0,My anxiety is pretty controlled these days but I still think about the strain it puts on my poor wife. She gets me though and knows I do my best to handle my issues so I am confident in our relationship.
depression,fcu21ky,t3_eir5wa,1577969994.0,"I'm still up until about 6 am every day. Even if I have to get up early like 6 am. I some times stay up all night with the hopes I'm so tired I can go to bed earlier.

It's not like I'm not sleepy either. If I would try to sleep I am pretty sure I will fall asleep pretty quickly. And when I do get to sleep, I can sleep for 12 hours if I have nothing to do.

I just don't want to go to bed. Here I am surfing the internet pretty bored yet I'm up. Ugh."
socialanxiety,fcds2lz,t3_egtr7f,1577613058.0,You should have heard me on a phone interview the other day. The silence was hilariously sad.
depression,fc8damk,t3_egiok6,1577532328.0,"People that can't accept the ""new me"" have been cut out of my life. It's not them it's me and that is that. No hate just honesty."
depression,fbp7dyj,t3_edy0nx,1577018271.0,Same here but it's because I put no effort in to  my friendships.
