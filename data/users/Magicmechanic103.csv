UnresolvedMysteries,ff61lif,t3_erg75b,1579616808.0,"We had a similar thing happen to a kid I vaguely knew in the Army down in Texas.

His unit was out in the field and was rotating weekends back at home. He got his weekend off and never came back. Everyone assumed he had gone AWOL. He was listed as a deserter and life moved on.

It was some months later some other unit was out on some orienteering mission and wandered into the kids car, almost completely obscured by dense brush on the side of the road. Kid was still inside. They think he had been in a rush on his way back and gone off the road, and landed just right that you couldnt find him until you were practically touching the car."

I think he went and took some SCUBA lessons at his local quarry and started thinking he was an expert, and convinced his completely inexperienced wife of the same and convinced her that they didnt need to use a real dive master on their trip because he totally knew what he was doing and would take care of her.

Then something went wrong and he panicked and fled because he didnt actually have any clue what he was doing.

He deserved the manslaughter wrap for fooling his wife into thinking he could keep them safe, and the diving service deserves blame for not bothering at all to verify his claims of being an expert."
MilitaryPorn,fes7quh,t1_fes6rtg,1579362247.0,That I'll agree with. It would have been nice if the Army gave us some uniforms in Hawaii that could hide red dirt stains so my uniforms would have lasted longer than the next trip to East Range.
MilitaryPorn,fes5b03,t1_fes4buc,1579361541.0,"Alright, the thought of hiding stains on a uniform didnt occur to me, nor the idea that the Navy's leadership would deliberately choose a uniform to hide stains rather than just forcing everyone to buy like 12 sets so they can have clean and dirty sets like the other branches do.

For one, you dont have to accept an article 15. I'm fairly confident that the same is true for an NJP. You can demand to take it to court. That alone is often enough to get a commander to back off if they know they are on shaky ground.

A commander could still order him to post (but not remove pay) without a legal process. In the Army, my next step would be to take it to the Inspector General, the Army's authority on commanders abusong their power. I dont know what the Marine equivalent to that is or if it even exists.
