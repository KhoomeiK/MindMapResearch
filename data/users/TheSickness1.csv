relationship_advice,feecj5l,t1_fed459w,1579030945.0,"Wow you’ve so clearly been raised without a dad. 

I don’t care where you’re from, you don’t go in someone else’s house who you’re dating and talk shit about the mom in her own house. You don’t start shit with the brother cause you’re the outsider and don’t belong. But yeah cry about me swearing when you flip out and cuss your ass off about their mom. You one of those little bitches who can only swear to women then tuck your little Johnson when confronted by another guy? You’re a bitch.

Get some fucking respect if you wanna go there and eat their food and just overall loiter there when clearly only 1/3 people there enjoy your presence. But yeah sorry for the tough love. Or you know, you can both get practical jobs and get a cheap 1 bedroom apartment. Whining on Reddit’s another way to go too."

You can’t call the mom a retard in their house and cry when the brother wants to beat you up for it LOL.
Get some nut fuzz and tell her an art degree is worthless. Maybe the family will like you more for not just being a yes man to make her happy."
