Keep in mind I don’t actually have any kids yet, but ya know it’s all me.. I’m why the world is overpopulated. Sorry y’all!

Feminism was supposed to allow women to have the CHOICE not to do the traditional thing if they don’t want... not to eliminate the choice if it’s something that I want! It’s so obnoxious. I shouldn’t be made to feel like I’m betraying women for wanting to stay home with my (FUTURE) kids. I’m not exactly the youngest wife, so having a lot of kids for us is going to be within a fairly short time frame. This means I’ll go back to work once the youngest is in kindergarten.

I’m happy that things worked out for you, but it often doesn’t. I’m curious how your personal anecdote makes what I said “not true”? You can’t predict the future any more than I can, mine was speculation based on seeing many examples of sexual incompatibilities ending relationships. Yours is speculation based on your own experience. 

> Yeah, I’ve had to ‘get over’ not having sex as often as I would like 

Some people would not be willing to do this. Your willingness to do this means that sex is no longer an incompatibility for y’all, so you’re not even part of the group of couples who “are sexually incompatible” at this point. You’ve found a way to be compatible. It’s disingenuous to act like this happens in all cases just because it happened to you. I get that your point is that it’s possible to overcome things things, which I don’t disagree with. But it doesn’t make my comment unable to be true.

> Have I ever though about leaving because of the lack of sex? Yeah, in the earlier days. 

And some people make the decision that the disparity in libidos is a deal breaker. There is nothing inherently bad about this IMO. Better to come to a mature conclusion that it can’t work, than to pressure the LL partner to open the relationship or push the boundaries on their consent. It’s also better than the HL cheating. The decision to split based on sexual incompatibility could save them both from furthering the time investment in a relationship that isn’t going to work. It could also save both of them emotional pain from a cheating / toxic situation that can result from this.

> It’s difficult to deal with feeling physically rejected ... not her rejecting me

> like that is 100% the case

Not ever LL person is the same as your wife. Sometimes the LL person IS rejecting them physically. Sometimes the HL person is physically rejecting the LL person. Again, not every couple’s sexual situation is the same as yours.

Just read through this sub or any of the other relationship type subs, and you’ll see a plethora of examples of people choosing to end their relationship due to sexual incompatibilities. Your case doesn’t mean it has to happen like this in OPs case."

I’m not trans but I use this example: I’m bi, and I prefer to refer to myself as ‘queer’ instead of “part of the LGBT+ community”.

Are both of us not serious about changing? If so, then you should separate. If not, then you both need to take an honestly look at your lack of effort, and knock it off, and make an effort there."
changemyview,ff67l6a,t3_ervvik,1579621026.0,"I can see the point in what you’re saying and there actually are trans people who are fine with this. From what they’ve told me, it’s essentially their form of coping with the fact that they’ve lived that part of their life as the wrong gender, but it’s still a valid part of their experience.

However, some trans folks feel differently and doing this is hurtful to them because it comes off as thinking their current gender expression is “a choice” so to speak. Which they don’t think it is. So, **without commenting on if that’s right or not**, what reason would you have for purposely doing this if they’ve told you it hurts them? Why would this concept you’ve described more important than not hurting them?"

AskReddit,ff66vbb,t3_ervx5j,1579620548.0,"The reasons I like to shop local have all been said, but I’ll add some others that I tried to think up. 

If I buy something that was made in my same city, it didn’t have to travel the world to get here. I’d like to think that saves some amount of fuel or whatever the hell they fuel planes and boats with? But who knows maybe the way they’re made here is actually worse than that for the environment. I know nothing about this so this is just speculation.

Also some other countries have sweatshops, so if you buy from a country that doesn’t have sweatshops, you can feel good about not contributing to a horrific quality of life for sweatshop workers."

relationship_advice,ff666y5,t3_ervxly,1579620093.0,This doesn’t sound like a healthy situation. Y’all should sit down and talk about this and see if you’re both even on the same page about fixing things. You gotta start there

dogs,ff65fkc,t1_ff64osp,1579619570.0,"I know I said I was done but I’ve gotta respond to this. First of all, there’s no requirement for any specific tone here. What I’ve said is factually true and would definitely “be helpful” if you would be willing to try it. I haven’t insulted you or broken any rules. I’m just stating the obvious truth. 

You’re just offended because you think you know better than all these people telling you the same thing and you don’t want to admit it’s your own fault. I’m not going to keep my mouth shut in a case like this. People who get dogs that are unable to accept their role in conditioning the dog’s behavior are a MAJOR problem in this world. This is exactly how dogs end up abused and abandoned.. because their humans are too stubborn to admit when they are wrong. I don’t really care if you don’t like my tone. It is a negative tone bth, but that doesn’t change the correctness of what I’m saying."
dogs,ff64ngt,t1_ff6406m,1579619027.0,Yep totally agree but OP doesn’t care. Not worth it to argue with someone this stubborn
dogs,ff64ksj,t1_ff63js0,1579618973.0,"Ok so you won’t listen to the vets in your area and you won’t listen to all of us saying the same thing. That’s fine, but you need to accept that it’s never going to change then. He has learned this behavior because you taught him it, and you are the only reason it will never change. 

Don’t know why you even posted this if you have no intention of listening to the correct responses? I’m done wasting my time with this. Good luck"
relationship_advice,ff647zm,t1_ff63g2c,1579618721.0,"Well we all have different boundaries, and that’s okay. If you see his other qualities as good enough to outweigh his having no respect for you, not giving a shit about your consent, and literally getting off on people talking shit about you, then you’re totally entitled to your desire to stay with him. 

Just saying I couldn’t, and this is coming from someone with a degradation kink. The kink is supposed to be fun, not harmful. In my world this is considered abuse (and as others have mentioned, a crime). I’m not judging you, even though I’m sure it sounds like it. I’m sure people judge me for willingly consenting to degradation play too.. so I get it that people tolerate different shit. But it’s just to me and to others I’ve met in the kink community who are into similar things, this situation would be considered a line crossed that requires ending the relationship. But it’s okay if that’s not the case for you.

So if you want to stay with him you’re obviously allowed to do so. You just will need to accept that this is who he is and people don’t change this kind of thing. So if you plan on staying with him, I would work on more or “accepting” it rather than “forgiving” it, because it’s GOING to keep happening. If your response to this is to stay with him, he’s going to take that as a green light to keep doing this. I mean even if you tell him it hurts you, actions speak louder than words as they say. So if there’s no serious repercussions for him doing this (which is what the action of staying with him says) then he won’t have a reason to change."
dogs,ff62tyt,t1_ff62i68,1579617723.0,"What do you mean you can’t find a way? You simply refuse to hand-feed him. He’s not going to starve himself. He WILL eat eventually. Just keep the bowl filled and let him self regulate. 

>  my family has seeked help from almost every vet in the city

You (and your parents) created this problem and you’re the only ones who can fix it. The vets in your area are correct. Idk what other magic solution you’re here looking for?"
relationship_advice,ff62o2v,t3_erv6fu,1579617603.0,"I’m all about having a degradation kink.. but this is beyond fucked up. This is abuse. I’ve commented on Reddit and other sites that people need to be careful with this because this shit happens, and I always get a lot of pushback.. they say I’m making a straw man and this shit doesn’t actually happen in real life. Well, clearly it does. Saving this post for whenever that happens again.

I’m so sorry OP. This is unforgivable in my mind. I can’t give you any advice on how to stay with him because I don’t think you should."

AustralianShepherd,ff61w8n,t3_erv7ds,1579617030.0,"My sister’s two aussies can only tolerate the cold for a couple of minutes. So we take them to dog friendly stores for walks in winter. A handful of places allow dogs outside of service animals. If you’re in the US, there’s pet stores like PetCo and PetSmart, but there’s also Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Hobby Lobby to name a few. If you’re unsure, it sometimes says on their website or you can call in advance. Just bring a poop bag and a to-go thing of Clorox wipes in case there’s an accident."

bisexual,ff5rny8,t3_ert7sg,1579607598.0,"Many bisexuals experience this same thing. Of course I’m not saying this makes you bi, only you can determine that. But I will say that being in a monogamous relationship with a straight man is a 100% a valid thing for a bisexual woman to do. Many people, before they accept that they’re bi, don’t understand that. *Lesbians* typically only want to go for females. But lesbians are different than bisexuals. So I think it’s a safe bet that at this point you don’t seem to be saying you’re a lesbian. But bisexual women absolutely date men. Hell I’m a bisexual woman and I’m married to a man and it didn’t undo my sexuality."
