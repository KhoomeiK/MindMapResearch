Maya doesn’t care, it’s all just polygons on a computer screen. But Fusion expects you to *make* this topological nightmare.

So what?  I don't need a drafting program to protect me from Bad Decisions - I can do that just fine myself.  Maya was perfectly fine for making solid objects with clean meshes - I could do it in my sleep once upon a time.  The snapping features were stupidly intuitive: hold X to snap to grid, hold E to snap to edge, hold V to snap to vertex.  Making precise geometry was as simple as setting the grid to the precision required and snap-moving.  Watertight meshes were as just as simple.

F360 is just plain confusing.  Why does it even *have* an ""extrude face"" feature if you aren't allowed to do anything with an extruded face?  Why do I need to draw the boundaries of simple objects and loft them together?  That's an excellent way to make complex shapes, but it's like smashing a fly with a Karl Gustav for what I'm doing."
