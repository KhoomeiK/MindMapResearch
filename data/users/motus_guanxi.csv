flashlight,ffhmt6v,t1_ffgzxjq,1579942854.0,"Cool, thanks much. I’ll finish going through the lights shortly."
flashlight,ffhmfz2,t1_ffhc480,1579942302.0,I can hear the same noise on all PWM lights. I can’t stand the whine.
flashlight,ffhbr3r,t1_ffgye51,1579929117.0,It’s like a faint whine. I get it more on headlamps but I think all PWM lights I’ve tried have it.
flashlight,ffgtg8o,t1_ffgrdek,1579914620.0,"Cool, I’ll start digging. So just to be clear, would you recommend just getting a host from simon and ordering the rest then putting it together? Thanks much for the help"
flashlight,ffgqouo,t1_ffgpuuv,1579912620.0,I figured it would be soldered either way. I  haven’t ever worked on a flashlight so I’m not sure how exactly they are put together. I thought I would just have two sets of driver/led combo to switch out. That way I only have to solder the new driver/led and have a biscotti back up.
flashlight,ffgpfu9,t1_fffha5v,1579911728.0,"Cool, I’m thinking of just ordering a convoy s2+ and then also ordering this driver and another sst20 led so I can just switch it out. Does that sound ok? Anything else I should consider?"
flashlight,fffh6wy,t1_fffgssv,1579883880.0,Thanks. Got any suggestions for in the USA ?
flashlight,fffghuy,t1_ffezqqj,1579883448.0, I like everything about the sst20 convoy s2+ but I can’t stand the pwm noise. Where can I check out the ld4a driver?
flashlight,fffgb8i,t1_fff2wxm,1579883335.0,Ok thanks. Do you think the PWM is louder in the 8 vs the 4?
flashlight,fffg6se,t1_fff3xjq,1579883258.0,Thanks much. I actually found this store while googlin. Why this charger over the vc2s?
flashlight,ffffzh4,t1_fffdmv4,1579883134.0,"I prefer tail, but I’m open"
flashlight,ffeb14h,t1_ffdtnn8,1579841741.0,Do you think the 8 is necessary? I read that the 4 is most efficient and the 6 is certainly better. What would the 8 be best for? Do you know how many  lumens the 4 is?
flashlight,ffdv4zj,t1_ffdtnn8,1579829700.0,"Thanks much. Do you have any other recommendations on chargers? also good quality battery cases, batteries, maybe even a lens cover?"
flashlight,ffdtl6i,t1_ffdsxou,1579828598.0,Ahh I see. Thanks much.
flashlight,ffdemkx,t1_ffd7tsu,1579819261.0,"So what is the difference between all the led on this page? https://convoy.aliexpress.com/store/330416/search?origin=n&SortType=bestmatch_sort&SearchText=s2%20biscotti

Why would I want the sst20 over the XPl Hl?"
flashlight,ffdcrym,t1_ffdb77c,1579818141.0,Do you know where I can find the battery times for the different modes on the s2+?
flashlight,ffdal7s,t1_ffd7tsu,1579816716.0,Thanks much. Will probably be ordering one
flashlight,ffdaf2a,t1_ffd8ab1,1579816609.0,"Gotcha, thanks."
flashlight,ffd29mb,t1_ffcs2dk,1579811994.0,"Ooo that looks really nice. How is it with drop/water resistance? Why do you recommend the 4000k option? Do people make attachments for this, like a striker on the front or rear? Where would I get the diffuser? As simple as a quick web search? I’m guessing this is a popular light and has after market parts available. 

Sorry for the barrage of questions, I’m new to this world. Thanks much"

flashlight,ffcn0lo,t1_ffcmj6d,1579802914.0,"Ok I moved to desktop and the ""form"" is just a link to new post with a recommendation for the title."
flashlight,ffcmqm1,t1_ffcmj6d,1579802747.0,It won’t load for some reason.
flashlight,ffcmm85,t1_ffcmj6d,1579802672.0,Where is that?
flashlight,ffckg48,t3_eswdog,1579801358.0,Also it would be cool if I could change the focus from spot to wide.
flashlight,ffcjpp7,t1_ffcjmoe,1579800917.0,I’ve looked through it. Looking for suggestions.
Parkour,ffcgu9x,t3_esvpkx,1579799166.0,Gotta go flex your parkour eyes. Lots to do in Portland.
geology,fen788w,t1_femxwnx,1579278496.0,Yup
geology,fen77dt,t1_fen0yir,1579278482.0,I’m not saying to just give them the money. I have been many places around the world. Worked in Africa.
geology,fel0hzx,t1_fekzxre,1579211435.0,I worked in the trade. I understand it. These are fresh out of the mine. No gem shop would have that much raw opal let alone just have it out.
geology,fekzxgt,t1_fekzvws,1579211096.0,"Thanks yo, you too"
