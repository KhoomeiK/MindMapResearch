AskReddit,fd2zi2q,t3_ejxfgv,1578153336.0,"TLDR: pulled my dick out in front of my terrifying gf’s dad while high. 

Early twenties. I took synthetic marijuana once. I’d smoked for a long time before that but had never tried the k2 stuffs. I took a two one hitters worth before walking in the door. I was blitzed. What I didn’t know is it wasn’t going to be my highest point.. I rushed to the bathroom upstairs leaving my gf and her dad in the front room. I holler from the kitchen. “Hey guys. Not feeling real well. Gotta use the restroom.”

I get in the bathroom after climbing Mount Everest upside down. Sit. Toilet is where I found comfort...momentarily. After about 30 minutes I hear a knock. “Babe? You ok?” I let her know I’m not feeling well and am just having a hard time going. I’m really having a hard time believing I’m still on planet earth. The room has twisted into a corkscrew and my eyes were two round pieces of bouncing jello I would only squeeze in two whenever I tried to hold together. My clothes begin to suffocate. 

I’m naked on the toilet and I can see myself from above. I’m pitiful. My arms and chest are slumped. My legs spread and chest against the seat. I’ve died. I am ascending to the heavens to be judged and cast back into hell. My breathe now only exits my lungs. They are the first to feel hells burning embrace. Reality shifts for a brief moment. My savior. “Babe? It’s been over an hour. Hello?”

“Mmmlemlengmlem”

I hear under hear breath “what the fuck did he just say?” Door opens. My arm reaches up as if I’m the crawler from the opening in the walking dead. I reach out and again say “bbbuuhhhhhhhfffd” 

“Omg babe what the fuck? You’re scaring me what’s wrong?” No panic yet. That’s good. I don’t have to worry about her getting her father, who actually scares the soul out of me. I speak finally “I am dying. I cant* breathe in. I can only breathe out and I’m almost out of breath. I can see my body now from above. I don’t want to go but I love you.” 

“What are you talking about you’re breathing fine. What’s going on? I’m going to get dad.” We talking, barely, back and forth and I tell her I just need to lay down I don’t feel good. She’s obviously not falling for my Eastwood level bluff. She descends. I panic further. Now, still sitting chest down legs spread I begin praying for death to piece  me with his cold icysickle. It begins with blackness. Thank you friend. 

The devils hand is what I feel first. His skin tearing mine apart with a simple touch on my back. His voice causes my ears to fill with roaches and my drums implode. “Hey man. What’s going on? You gotta talk to us. Let us know what’s going on.”  I continue to make no sense. He lets me know that if he gonna help me I’m going to have to put something on downstairs. With that realization, what little strength the atoms holding my body together have left give, and my being is shattered into trillions of stardust particles. I finally achieve the impossible with the help of my gf. My boxers are up to my knees. Now to lift my ass and cover mah dick. “Dude I’m not going to hold you while you shits out. You gotta cover that up.” Finally we meet in the middle. He’s gonna lift me forward and up and I pull up my boxers as he does and I’ll be dressed and he can help. He starts to lift and I push em down. “Now what in the fuck are you doin?”

 Ded.....

Somehow I’m able to coordinate something with gf and get them up. The laughter apparently sobered me just enough that they only needed to support me under the shoulder as I walked to the bed and coma’d for about 16 hours. After 8 years I still feel as big as I remember my dick being that day and he still gets a kick out of watching me die inside as he “knows” how widdle little me is. Thanks for reading the most singular humiliating moment of my life letting me embarrass myself for you’re pleasure."

I quit vaping. 

I gave up energy drinks (and everything not water)

I eat (with no restrictions) only within a 4-6 hour window. Never within 4 hours of bed. 

That’s it. I really have made no other changes. I wanted to save money in the beginning. It wasn’t about weight loss. I quit buying my daily $10 lunch. $7 on energy drinks and I bought those at least every other day if not every. Averaged two every purchase. Vaping cost me on average $40 a week. I started only eating dinner as soon as I got home at 4:30-5 because I was starving. It all became habitual after a few weeks. No fancy meals. No added exercise. No dietary supplements."
