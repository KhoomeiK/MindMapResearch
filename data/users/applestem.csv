They don’t talk six miles per minute even when it’s busy and get you where you’re going with the minimum of fuss. Also, I find it easier to hear them; obviously her voice is higher pitched and the guy has a higher pitched voice too as well as no accent. I seem to have a harder time with guys with a rumbling voice and a New York/Boston accent."

""The gunman was heading toward the front of the sanctuary as Wilson searched for a clear line of fire.

""I didn't have a clear window,"" he said, referring to church members who ""were jumping, going chaotic."" Wilson, a 71-year-old firearms instructor who has also been a reserve sheriff's deputy, said: ""They were standing up. I had to wait about half a second, or a second, to get my shot. I fired one round. The subject went down.""

[Wilson’s single shot quickly ended the attack](https://www.pennlive.com/nation-world/2019/12/police-2-parishioners-shot-and-killed-texas-church-gunman.html) that killed Wallace, 64, and White, 67, at the West Freeway Church of Christ in the Fort Worth-area town of White Settlement. He said the entire confrontation was over in no more than six seconds. More than 240 congregants were in the church at the time.

""The only clear shot I had was his head because I still had people in the pews that were not all the way down as low as they could. That was my one shot,"" Wilson said Monday from his home in nearby Granbury."""
