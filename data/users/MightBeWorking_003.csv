Id take a look at the top household or everyday use items that you use. For example, your phone, your computer, the ports and wall chargers for any of these items.

These things suck. Honestly I really liked her and it was basically a waste of two months of waking up in the middle of the night to text her because she worked nights. She would never schedule time for an actual date or tell me when she actually had off and make every excuse to not call. Sorry you had to deal with this as well. Just gotta move on and go with the flow I guess.   
It is hard to find someone mature enough now a days though, its either get ghosted, or play these dumbass games."

Yes, any kind of tech support position or help desk position leads up to experience in the field.   
As a now security professional, I started out with a physical security position that worked primarily with monitoring systems which allowed me to tailor my resume to make it more technical at which point I was able to get a help desk position. The pay will start off pretty low, just a heads up.   
You need to definitely take anything that pertains to tech. You can always tailor your resume to match the position you want. However, working in a coffee shop theres only so much you can make it out to be technical.   
Good starter jobs: Geek Squad, Genius Bar Technician (these first two are probably your best bet since they deal with multiple technologies) Cable Company (Insert Random Local Name Here) Technician, Cell Phone (Again Random Name) Company Technician.   
Also Other Advice: Make sure you are doing cert classes while going to school. Net+, Sec+, Linux, MSCE, any of these are great choices to get started off with and will help in finding a future position."

You both probably have plenty of resources since you literally sit on top of a gym you probably are both Gold at.
Edit: Second thought, name your pokemon something like ""AddMe"" or some kind of indicator to exchange usernames or something so you can work out a schedule. They may not know they are bullying you either, just like I suggested you may be the bully. The shoe works on either foot.
2nd Edit: Believe it or not theres people out there that dont know how the new gym system works. When I say new the one that was implemented uhm what 2 years ago."

pokemongo,fencu5t,t3_eq06h9,1579281953.0,"I have a sneaking suspicion about several things here:

1. Youre actually the bully without realizing it. You may have angered this player by kicking out their pokemon without them being able to receive their full 50 coins just because it was convienent for you and didnt pay attention to how long theyve been in there. Now they seek revenge. Leaving a gym unclaimed is usually an accident or power move or see point 3. 
2. They seem to either be spoofing or more than likely a neighbor, they may even know you play so they are messing with you. 
3. They could be leaving the gym unclaimed to signal to you its your turn to go in. 

I play in my neighborhood because we have 4 gyms in it and its actually super difficult to keep a gym. So I claim them all and let the other players decide what color a gym is. Usually one thats out of the way in the neighborhood stays my team (Valor) or (Mystic) I have 2 accounts. The neighborhood is pretty contested with Instict. Usually they get lazy though. Anyway my point is with 1 gym I can see how this would be an issue. Maybe change teams and unite together to hold the gym. Or bully them into changing teams. In the end, its a game. Have fun with the competiveness. Maybe try adding them and battling from time to time."

relationship_advice,fekkr3k,t3_eplkyq,1579202090.0,"Well  is your SO always emotionally/verbally abusive and you both hardly ever argue or was this just a one off? 

If arguments or emotional/verbal abuse isnt always present then I would suggest working things out and slowly talk it over. A break usually means ending things, but NOT always, and can be a very adult thing to do. However, you both would need to lay out clear terms on a break and what each others definition is. If it means you both are completely broken up for the time being then you may just have to cut your losses, especially if you cant come a unified decision on what each others definition of break is. 

My overall suggestion would be to talk it over slowly and if you cant work things out through verbal communication then it may be time to move on."

I hope its ok for constructive criticism. I dont mean to be abrasive at all. 

In my opinion Overall you have a great voice. Maybe lower the background musics volume just a little bit. Id rather hear the voice a little bit over the background music. Otherwise you have good rythem/rhyme. I like it. Theres only one section that I thought wasnt completely necessary was at 2.25. My opinion again I would maybe suggest instead of rambling off at the end, maybe changing it out for humming the tune of your background music and trailing off. Again, just my opinion."

After a day and a half of ignoring me I deleted her on snapchat just because at this point it was pointless anyway. Go to check facebook and notice she ended up actually blocking me on everything.

Christianity,fegwfee,t3_ep2td9,1579104046.0,"So listen, Im not a part of any religion. However, I have lost two friends to suicide in Highschool. I am 29 now. It still affects me to this day. I wish my friends were still here. They were both very positive and loving people and had a long lasting effect on my life. Losing my two friends not only affected me,  their loss had a deep effect on my friends family and not to mention the other friends they had. I am still friends with one of their families and we still always talk about him. I still remember the conversation with him before it took place as well. I partially blame myself for not seeing any of the potential indicators. I realize we were young and hadnt encountered something like that before so theres no way I could have known.  Anyway..

 I understand things are difficult, I really do. I have run into some tough situations myself where things seem to be unbearable. However, as a fellow human and without getting into religious topics about this you should keep pressing on. Things will get better. It may take some time, but they will. There are always good days and bad days and theres nothing you cant overcome. Trust me on that one. I know I am a total stranger and just a guy behind a computer screen, but I truly believe in the positives of life. Theres so much more to do and so much to see.   
I wish you the best, and I highly recommend talking to a professional. Whether it be a psychologist, phsychiatrist, or a crisis hotline. Theres one that Reddit even recommends. Try texting  ""CHAT"" to 741741 (Im sure Im not the first one to post that)"

TLDR: Fax is not encrypted at all meaning all your data is sent in plain text.
