physicaltherapy,few7kps,t3_eqp2br,1579406474.0,I had it and got rid of  it within two weeks with just foot massage.  It has threatened to come back but minor massage takes care of it.

Epilepsy,fesnj8j,t3_epi1mp,1579367124.0,Not at all sure how I feel about this.
Epilepsy,ferxmg5,t1_fejl58q,1579359370.0,Seems very strict. Ten years
Epilepsy,fejjsq9,t3_epi1mp,1579177198.0,So I guess it’s legal to fire people with epilepsy —even controlled epilepsy?
physicaltherapy,fei5fb1,t3_ep8o82,1579130679.0,That’s so ingenious! I hope that gets widely known. So many people could benefit.
hyenas,fei4yud,t1_fehcg7u,1579130392.0,Sure would!

Epilepsy,feh92v8,t3_eos1yo,1579111683.0,Most people have no ethics or morals or maybe or empathy. I’m learning to expect only meanness and greed and cruelty.
birding,feh8s8a,t3_ep3jh3,1579111505.0,It’s a wonderful shot!
hyenas,feh4vka,t1_feeo4qh,1579109192.0,"I’m with you completely. Hyenas apparently are doing fine as a species, but painted dogs need lots and lots of help. I’d love to be rich so I help them in a meaningful way."
hyenas,feen8m1,t3_eojew1,1579037181.0,What a good group these people must be.
legaladvice,fe8uytc,t1_fe6habb,1578931193.0,"I guess you’re right, but in the other hand that employee gave out info I would not unless that info was needed by someone who might need it—a doctor or veterinarian, for instance. I wonder whether the amazon employee who did this signed a document saying she or he would not divulge such info."
AnimalTracking,fe6f2dd,t3_eny7n0,1578888984.0,Thanks for this. Tracking is a fascinating field to get into. The more tracks you find the better.

YouShouldKnow,fdfxoie,t1_fdfw5m3,1578373087.0,My post is perfectly clear—why the oppositional title?
YouShouldKnow,fdfvlmz,t1_fdeyywg,1578371393.0,"Yes, I agree . The Calm app was recommended by a therapist. I was opposed to using an app but so torn apart I decided to try it. I didn’t lCalm so tried Headspace. It was only marginally helpful so I stopped using it, and then could not cancel."

Hypothyroidism,fd6rpdh,t3_ejsqjv,1578194896.0,"I was suffering incredible fatigue after a thyroidectomy. Only when I got a new endo did I find relief. She said, “ I could get blacklisted for this , but I’m going to add T3 to your Synthroid.”
Once on T3, I was back to myself. I learned from my PCP that many doctors have been taught that under no circumstances should they prescribe T3. But he also said, upon finding how well the T3 worked,for me that he was going to try it with a few patients whose symptoms that resembled mine. He left the practice, so I never found out how those patients fared."

Neuropsychology,fcuzwtg,t1_fcu91ow,1577991827.0,"CAA (cerebral amyloid  angiopathy )is not widely known about but presence is growing. It  is found almost exclusively in people in their sixties and beyond, and it involves  the deposition of amyloid plaque (like those involved in Alzheimer’s)   in the brain. As these plaques develop,  they cause events much like mini strokes. Eventually the person with the plaques develops dementia and dies. There is no cure."
