learndutch,fddepe1,t1_fddeejd,1578308854.0,"All three would be with *niet*:

1. Human is an adjective: *Hij is niet menselijk*.

2. My is a personal pronoun: *Dat is niet mijn hond*.

3. Crazy is an adjective: *Zij is niet gek*.

For 1 and 3 we could change the examples to ""He is not a human"" and ""She is not a fool"", so in both cases we use a noun and therefore *geen* is used:

We would get: 

- *Hij is  geen mens*.

- *Zij is geen dwaas*."
learndutch,fdde82s,t3_eksbzb,1578308170.0,"First: do you have any specific examples that I could try and explain?

Second: while they both are negating words, they're different in type and meaning:

*Geen* is a *lidwoord* meaning **no**, **none**, **not a(n)**, **not any**, compare *een*. It must go with noun:

> *Ik drink geen suiker in mijn koffie* --- lit. I drink no sugar in my coffee --- I drink my coffee without sugar

*Niet* is an adverb (*bijwoord*) meaning **not**. It goes with a verb or a pronoun or an adjective:

> Ik drink niet. --- I don't drink.

> *Dat is niet mijn koffie* --- That is not my coffee.

> *Er staat een niet opgegeten taart op tafel*  --- There is an unfinished cake on the table.
