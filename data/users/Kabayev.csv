I have not read the entire comment thread and I take it one of you has simply decided to stop responding and feel free to ignore this (because I most certainly won't engage further), but I think your core differences are inductive and deductive reasoning. 

Certain ""proof"" is given via deductive reasoning because it implies that there are given and objective truths while inductive reasoning rejects this premise (because the idea is that there is always more info out that that we've not taken into account). I believe, one of you believes that you cannot *prove* anything which falls into the camp of deductive reasoning and the other does not. They are simply two different camps of perspectives. 

Please, refrain from the ad hominems."

21m from NYC here. Currently residing in Tokyo, headed to Kyoto on the 3rd. Then Osaka on the 6th. And then leaving Japan on the 9th!

I accidentally purchased a night pass ticket for **teamlab Borderless** for tonight (the 2nd) and didn‚Äôt take into account that I wouldn‚Äôt have enough time for Fuji-san today ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If anyone is interested buying it, please PM me! Nightpasses are from 5 PM to 9 PM and are only ¬•2,900. Will gladly sell for cheaper.

Pinging u/redass14 since I saw your post and although I can‚Äôt meet up, I think you might be interested! And YES, the city was so slooooow, I‚Äôm not sure if it was because of New Years or just if things slow down after 5-6pm."
