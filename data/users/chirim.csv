languagelearning,ffhogrj,t3_etg95f,1579945379.0,"As to the 3rd point, it's a great advice until one learns the language to become a translator later. In that case, it's not that stupid to take time to learn the translation, too."
prolife,ff3q3sj,t3_er15ir,1579546428.0,"This person sounds to me like a woman who already had an abortion herself but tries desperately not to fall into despair because of the fact she killed a human being, and so she attempts to clamour down any pangs of guilt she's feeling by trying to silence down anyone who'd remind her of what she's truly done."
AskReddit,feybthw,t1_feyapkt,1579443430.0,"well, I definitely can relate, so I guess it depends on the person and what they've been through."
Eyebrows,feml4y5,t1_fe4no0r,1579260964.0,"There's a 2% version made specially for women and their eyebrow problems, if I recall correctly."
exmuslim,fekybxf,t3_epkgjd,1579210135.0,So they deem the majority of the world's women prostitutes. Funny.
prolife,fejngpk,t1_fejiofc,1579180761.0,Same! I've got very similar thoughts regarding our Christian faith and life in general (although haven't read Camus and had no idea about his suicide question).
TrueOffMyChest,feic9ni,t1_fehmext,1579135138.0,"It's weird tho, isn't it? No one punishes boys for smiling and laughing, but suddenly crying isn't okay? Not crying doesn't mean they don't feel these emotions anyway. It's so toxic. Laughing and crying are merely the outward expressions of emotional states, they're neutral themselves."
prolife,fehznkk,t3_ep9fag,1579127120.0,"I haven't. Now I'm reading the comments and feel heartbroken. The lengths those women go to to dehumanise their own, completely defenceless children, to justify murdering them... How is it possible they're the same species as we are?"
AskEurope,fef528g,t1_fedl3wf,1579048359.0,"Hungarian harder than Polish? I don't relate. Hungarian is imo much more logical and consistent, doesn't have as many rules nor exceptions to them. Generally speaking, Polish is harder to learn for Hungarians than the other way around."
prolife,fef1jz8,t1_feew0j3,1579046002.0,I've got a feeling it's like this everywhere on Reddit.
SubredditAdoption,feannid,t1_fealjg8,1578950628.0,I think the music genres is a better idea. Would add asking others for help in telling if a certain song is more of an X or an Y genre (it can be frustrating not being sure when you're creating a certain genre-focused playlist for example).
AskReddit,fe5imfr,t1_fe5h57r,1578869917.0,"Thank you for your insight. If I may ask, what made you change? Was it losing her or something else?"
AskReddit,fe5czsv,t1_fe5cw3j,1578867840.0,A foe in disguise.
