AnimalsBeingJerks,fecwni7,t1_fecuaa5,1578987584.0,"Oh, I think I see what the problem is now. You're an idiot.

Is now a good time to point out that a horse that responds to cues 100% of the time regardless of situation is what we call ""shut down""? A pretty clear sign of an abused animal. Congratulations.

I'm sorry that your horses frequently try to roll on you so you have ample opportunity to address this particular situation.

Now in my once-off situation that you have no idea about because you're just making wild assumptions, this was the horses first time at the beach. Normally A++ good boy but most horses will get overstimulated in a new environment. He was having a good old splish splash & he forgot himself. 

Punishment? No, it was a reinforcement of the previous cues that were missed. The only goal was to send the horse forward. Other riders might use spurs or a whip to demand a response, but I don't ride with either. 

Anyway, good luck with being a little bitch."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fect7kp,t1_fecihwe,1578983678.0,"Please tell me how you specifically stop a 600kg animal from hurting humans & damaging equipment when they ignore the cues they've been trained to respond to & do so 99% of the time?

A single slap on the shoulder with reins as a last resort is not abuse. But yeah, carry on willfully not understanding. I'm sure you're a very experienced trainer who is qualified to make comments on the subject."
TrollXChromosomes,feb56uc,t1_fe9sap4,1578955529.0,I know! I hate my past self for thinking I needed more space
AnimalsBeingJerks,feaf67n,t1_fe8jzv0,1578947901.0,Horses like rolling in water & no one has taught this pony that it's the wrong thing to do when they have a rider.
AnimalsBeingJerks,feaelvd,t1_fe7z5fq,1578947752.0,"Way to make assumptions. It's not schooling dumbass, it's an emergency situation. You ask, tell & then demand. I wonder which one this is?

To clarify, let's say you catch your child about you key your car.

You: Can you stop that?
Child: No
You: Stop that right now
Child: No

Step 3??

According to everyone who downvoted & you, they would just say ""Fair enough, proceed""."
relationships,fe7j97x,t3_enzl7o,1578915317.0,I have no advice. I just want to say that your family is batshit insane. I'm sorry.
AnimalsBeingJerks,fe7ihso,t1_fe79wkf,1578914985.0,I would be less worried about cleanliness & more worried about the tree breaking

Source: horse tried to do this at the beach last weekend.

(He is well treated but that behavior is unacceptable and also I paid more for the saddle than the horse & he is not destroying it on my watch)

Edit: Thanks for the downvotes idiots. 

It's really fucking easy to tell when a horse is going to lie down & they should be stopped because it is a really dangerous behavior that will break your bones.

If you can't stop it, then jump off. Keeping in mind that every time you don't stop it, the horse self-rewards dangerous behavior. 

If you can't stop it, then you probably have no business riding a horse with such a dangerous habit."
TrollXChromosomes,fe6nv73,t3_enydoe,1578897463.0,"Thank god. I've been struggling with this for so long. It was easy when I had a 1 bedroom apartment & lived a 10 minute walk from work. 

Now I have a large house, many pets & spend 2hrs commuting & I just feel tired all the time."
todayilearned,fe6mwa4,t1_fe6mjfy,1578896403.0,Yeah :/
todayilearned,fe6mbo9,t1_fe6b30u,1578895773.0,It's weird to think that the guy would have gone under me but they kept us locked in the train until police had covered up the body so I didn't see anything disturbing. Can't imagine how the people who actually saw it are feeling though.
todayilearned,fe69c6t,t1_fe6711p,1578884655.0,Happened to my train this morning :( the driver was just rattling off usual stuff about delays and patience but his voice was shaking.
australia,fdmchh9,t1_fdlw7wq,1578545534.0,"Can understand it being dry, but that hay bale looks like it's been sitting outside in the rain for years. Look how flat it is on the bottom & the dirt stuck to it."

LifeProTips,fcp0ydp,t3_eiai3v,1577847127.0,I was invited out but I chose to stay home and go to bed early (Australia) because fuck the noise and drinking and staying up late. Great decision.
LifeProTips,fcmxqyn,t1_fcmw7mc,1577796861.0,"Oh wow, why didn't I think of that? Farmers usually only sell by the semi load because they don't have all day to sell hay to people buying small amounts. I don't own a semi nor can I afford the whole load of hay so go fuck yourself thanks."
LifeProTips,fcmrk7c,t1_fcm3m1p,1577788734.0,"I'm actually planning on doing this. As a person who likes to ride horses, hay resellers are skinning us alive to line their pockets.

I know of several who are buying bales for $50 from the farmer and resell for $170-$200. I can't take it anymore, every week I'm wondering how I'm going to eat after feeding the horses and I can't sell my horses because everyones in the same boat."
sadcringe,fb2on61,t1_fb2n0bj,1576454856.0,"I feel for her because I know what it's like to want your first horse and finding a beginner suited horse is really difficult. Unfortunately the reality is that she does not know what she's doing so two things are very likely to happen:

1. The horse gets neglected due to not knowing basic care.
2. She buys a horse unsuitable that she cannot handle, resulting in serious injury or death at the worst & having her confidence destroyed at the best. The future for the horse would then likely be through the sales & gets picked up by the meat man."
