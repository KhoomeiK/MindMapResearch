Which is a paradox. You mean social democracy. Democratic socialism is by definition impossible.

>Also way to contradict yourself, so heâ€™s a socialist but his policies arenâ€™t socialist?

Right, because everything a socialist does is socialism. It's not like you can be a socialist, but realise that it's actually not realistic to implement it as a system, and therefore propose some social (not socialist) programs which will be accepted because they make sense. No, that's impossible."

Whereas under socialism, **everybody** is dying in the streets. Much better.
