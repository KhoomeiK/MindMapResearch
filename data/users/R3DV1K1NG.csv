The way modern chicken farmers get around this is by boarding up the windows and turning off all the lights. This is not to be blamed on the chicken farmers themselves, it is mandated by the food companies who own the animal from egg to nugget.

Pardon the pun, but I think we reached the tipping point for normalizing obesity at least in America and England (growing in China too I believe they call them little emperors). As a guy built like a brick shit house, I've always tipped the scales, and it got worse after high school when I went from working out to eating out. Part of the thing that kept me away was the embarrassment at how far I let myself go, but now I'm back hitting the Y and the first thing I noticed is how friendly everyone is. I dunno maybe it's because I'm at the YMCA and it's not your typical gym mentality, but I'm a 30 something gimping along with my hip dysplasia shooting shit with the 80yo dude on the maxed out elliptical.

Prisoners are not exempt from forced labor. Meaning if they refuse to do any of the jobs they are assigned, they basically get locked up in the hole till they break. Because they will make money off you one way or another. If you won't work, they will drive you insane till you lash out and get yourself stuck there even longer.

Also most for profits have a contact that states they must maintain a minimum population. So guess what happens? More trumped up charges and judges getting paid off to send people away for longer stints. Judges have been charged with doing this already, and they focus on young offenders, and the poor. You know people who can't afford to call bull shit. And seeing as how your public defender is gonna recommend you take a plea...

Gyms are fun for the machines and the help that's available. But even if that's not in the budget there are YouTube videos, and personal trainers available online.

Small changes that you can make into a habit over time will have a huge impact. Intermittent Fasting would prolly be the cheapest first step, from there start replacing frozen anything with fresh. Yes you may need to hit the market more than once a month but hey out and about is still getting out there. The hardest thing for me is carbs and sugars... But that gives the biggest results obviously.

Also, fuck those people who make fun of you for being over weight. If they don't think it's funny when you start making fun of them for the way they look, then they need to cut the shit. Seriously, tape the harassment - because that's what it sounds like - and then start laying into them. When they get butt hurt and try to go to the boss, wham bam spank you ma'am.

Last little bit, I personally like Gravity Transformations on YouTube, mostly because they stick to the facts and science. They also run deals on their website some times, if you sign up for a program and stick with it and lose the target weight the whole thing is free.

The problem with Reddit is the same thing that's wrong with the internet, and that's people. People tend to be argumentative so the more you engage the more likely you are to be engaged. The internet just lets us get away with saying the worst thing that comes to mind with no obvious signs of repercussions, but it costs us a bit of ourselves each time we engage.

There was a philosopher... Off the top of my head I want to say Aristotle but I don't have time to fact check right now. Basically he says everything takes practice, no one is born is really born good. It takes a choice, and repetition to keep being a good person. So if you practice being a shit head, that's all you get and leeches back out to ""real life"".

Another problem is a sense of ""the good old times"", and we never had that in America. I mean like ever, we were founded in 1776, the last civil war pensioners died when George H was in office, someone who saw the civil war also lived through two world wars. Let that sink in for a second, then tell me when the good old times happened? During the race riots? Vietnam? Hell I lived through the 90's they weren't that peachy either.

TrueOffMyChest,fdqlmfr,t3_empxqw,1578669611.0,"Hmmm I gave this a lot of thought honestly, I work overnights so I tend to read a lot of online news. That includes stuff on the royal family just because I find the concept of modern monarchy interesting. As an American there is the knee jerk ""Down with the king!"" mentality to fall back on, but realistically we still seek to build up celebrities or even some political dynasties. 

It's kind of a nifty idea to have a monarchy who in theory still has the right to kick a Prime Minister out of office. Expecialy if you have one who goes bat shit crazy right? I personally have come to the conclusion over the years that the concept of a president, is a terrible idea. There needs to be a balance of 4 - 8 years of insanity, and life time positions for the Supreme Court. 

I couldn't tell you what would be better, maybe like a 10 year term. That way they could have the chance to see the effects of their policies and fix or evolve them. Because a couple years of one way, then going balls to the walls the other is terrible for our society.

Seems like 4 years was good, when you live till like 40 then died of an infected hang nail. But people can live to a hundred now, that's a third of the entire time we've had a country. The last civil war pensioners died when George Bush the Daddy was in office..."

TrueOffMyChest,fd175vc,t1_fcyc8xw,1578128211.0,"So instead of answering my questions you would rather latch on to two words and deflect to put words in my mouth? Hmmm, but to answer your question. No that wasn't my take away, far from it, actually I find it a penance. I don't like people in general, a person sure, but society? Nah, I'm good with being antisocial.

So we are clear I've never asked to be forgiven, for one I don't deserve it, and I sure as shit haven't earned it. Doesn't mean I'm going to hide from it, or cower anytime it's brought up. I know I fucked up, and that's not even the worst thing I've done in my life. It doesn't change the fact that I'm still going to try and be a better person today than I was yesterday, it just means I set the first bench mark real low because I'm an asshole.

So I will refrase the quesion, how do you justify to yourself going through other people's history and being judgmental about it, and then going out of your way to put them on blast? How do you find it acceptable in a forum of someone dealing with sexual abuse to hop up on a soap box and grand stand? Does that mean you find it acceptable for everyone else to judge you for the worst shit you've done in your life? To keep putting you on blast? As an ex-heroin addict you don't have anything you're ashamed of?

P.S. Are you ever critical of how your actions would effect others? Like what's the endgame? Is it possible to harass someone into being a better person? I don't think it is, but I don't even think that's the point right? In general people want to tear someone down, ""See they are still acting like a shit person, so I can be a shit person to them!"" Yeah I don't think that's how it should work. Hmmm thank you, you've given me a bit to ponder about."
TrueOffMyChest,fcwwpgc,t1_fcvl4b2,1578040841.0,"No, actually that is far from normal. I mean you would know, you're going through my comment history. Honestly it is hard for me to say what normal feels like, unless you're benchmark is Borderline Personality Disorder... In that case you have my sympathy because it's rough.

See being judgmental of other people is for lack of a better word entertaining, but it brings out the worst in people. With me though, it has a tendency to get way out of hand. All I can do, and have done, is remove myself from it. I no longer frequent AITA, even with the best of intentions it brought out the worst in me. Whatever moral support or advice I can offer in my best of days, will always be out done by the worst of days. I don't know what's broken in me, why contempt comes quicker than sympathy... It's a flaw I struggle with every day of my life.

But actions speak louder than words, and doubly so for written words. I feel like I'm making progress in my life, finally found a dosage of my medication that seems to have balanced me out. I try to support and give advice where I can, and baring that I at least try to bring some humor into the world.
