She has a responsibility to ensure all cars stop before going into the road.

Pedestrians are never legally at fault. But she definitely rushed into crossing the road and caused an accident that ended up getting herself hit"

Dont step out into the road as a pedestrian. You always have the right away but you're the one who's going to be hurt, permanently disabled or killed if the cars dont see you. Why risk it?"

Given our reproduction rate and our increasing ability to travel through space, our parasitic influence will exponentially expand. 

Theoretically, 20 humans (with the proper settlement technology) could repeat, over many thousands of years, what weve done to earth on any other planet they choose. 

Our only limit to spreading is our early space travel technology and our lack of ability to set up camps on other planets. All things we are working on. 

From there, it only takes a dozen or so ""settlers"" to leech all life from a host planet, assuming this new host planets ecosystem or preexisting life doesnt fight off the human parasite during its early stages of infection, aka the first settlers."
