GearsOfWar,fffbfge,t3_etadcc,1579880261.0,Dude plays on classic-alt too. He's my kind of guy.
GearsOfWar,fffb9rl,t1_ff4busp,1579880158.0,"I thought Gears 4's ranking system was bullshit but 5 has surpassed it in all categories. Here's a stat from last night:

2v2 Gnashers - Won 7-4 and MVP. -1,200 tier points (Bronze 3)

KOTH - Lost 0-2 and 3rd on team. 500 tier points (Silver 3)

This system makes no sense."
CFB,ffa6q6i,t1_ff96yjy,1579728955.0,"I would say y'all are getting the usual Saban wash of having coordinators and players leaving after a title, but this is just so much more than we've lost lmao"
GearsOfWar,ff4udg2,t1_ff4my54,1579572663.0,"PvE isn't fun to me and I'm not gonna waste 2 hours doing something I don't want to do. It's my fault yea, but I'm still not gonna do it."
GearsOfWar,ff4jyx4,t3_erkflc,1579565440.0,"So I just unlocked the Onyx Guard character from the TOD. I'm assuming he's under the COG Gear skin but I can't seem to equip the totem to unlock the COG Gear. Is this bc I haven't completed the Warden Totem?

Edit: It's equipped now. The game is just a POS. Not like I'm gonna unlock this character either bc I'm not playing horde or escape lmao"
CFB,fesdxle,t1_fes8vh2,1579364190.0,"I agree. He's a hell of a player but off the field he's a diva. Even sometimes on the field he loses control, like with is beef with Josh Norman a few years ago."
GearsOfWar,fes1sur,t3_eqfd7s,1579360574.0,"I unlocked him via the tour, but I can't play as him bc I don't have the COG character unlocked. Thx TC"
GearsOfWar,fego4cx,t1_fefwgwx,1579098478.0,Good point.
GearsOfWar,fefgurf,t3_eow21v,1579056043.0,I mean I'm winning close matches against better opponents while being MVP and still losing tier points. At this point why should I even play if I can't rank up?
iamverysmart,fedubq8,t3_eojsy8,1579020056.0,"Reminds me of Daniel Tosh's standup when he makes fun of people who claim to be bad test takers:

""Don't you love it when people in school are like 'I'm a bad test taker.' You mean you're stupid. Oh, you struggle with the part where we find out what you know?"""
GearsOfWar,fdwwckj,t1_fdqe8c4,1578762928.0,"You have a point, but just to let you know, [you can still lose points even if you win and have MVP...](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/experimentzz/screenshot/14433686)"
GearsOfWar,fdwvice,t1_fdphk4c,1578762743.0,Happened to me last night. Won 7-5 and was MVP and the other team was heavily favored by team skill. Lost 1200 points.
GearsOfWar,fdwvd8s,t1_fdpk2fr,1578762699.0,I wouldn't say they've been catering to casual players or horde/escape players. They just thought up a really stupid model with characters having abilities and shit and instead of abandoning their bad idea they're just gonna keep on going.
GearsOfWar,fdwtgyt,t1_fdqjfya,1578762183.0,Still no point. There are characters but you gotta grind for them.
GearsOfWar,fdwqoyp,t1_fdrrtjj,1578761399.0,Modern Warfare is actually dope as hell too.
GearsOfWar,fdwpu1j,t1_fdqlz7x,1578761225.0,"> I wonder why they took it down so much.

Bc they don't know what the fuck they're doing."
GearsOfWar,fdwplzo,t1_fdtd6ru,1578761153.0,Yep. I am not grinding horde or escape just to unlock a character. Other people can and I'm happy they have a chance to get characters without paying. But I'm not wasting my time doing shit I don't wanna do. I'm also not paying for them either so ya boy gonna be rocking the base skins whenever I do decide to play lmao
GearsOfWar,fdwnte2,t3_emkpug,1578760629.0,This character totem shit is dumb as hell lmao I'm not about to go grind horde or escape for a character. It's just a ploy to make the grind so unbearable that people just pay for the characters.
GearsOfWar,fdwlpbm,t1_fdw3in4,1578759959.0,I don't get this take. Everyone here has been claiming wingman should be brought back bc it was popular in gears 2. It was in gears 3 and barely anyone played it. That's why they ain't bringing it back lmao
GearsOfWar,fdwjetl,t1_fdt0jkq,1578759310.0,We basically play the same maps in ranked as well lmao
GearsOfWar,fdwfx3i,t1_fdv3uwq,1578758244.0,"If dying a lot is the reason why people lose points, shouldn't they add that column in the scoreboard? And I'll agree with you, if people are losing tier points after winning and being MVP, there should be some detailed reason as to why that's happening. It happens and people have no idea what to change in their gameplay to not have it happen. 

Won't ever happen bc the ranking system is complete ass."
GearsOfWar,fdw3wy4,t1_fdtzjxv,1578754787.0,"Even if you had amazing teammates, you'd still lose rank lmao

But I agree with you. I don't even look at rank anymore, I just play the game."
GearsOfWar,fdw3e5e,t1_fdvj082,1578754676.0,"4 was absolute trash, but 5 may have surpassed it in shittiness."
GearsOfWar,fdw2oze,t3_en1zom,1578754430.0,"I can do you one better, also won and was MVP of my match and the opposing team was heavily favored in the team skill category. 

[Lost 1,000 points.](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/experimentzz/screenshot/14433686)

I like playing it but if it's hard to even care about the ranking system with how broken it is."
GearsOfWar,fdvn8m3,t1_fdtvv4y,1578749342.0,Are you serious? Lmao what a shit show
GearsOfWar,fdvn66v,t1_fdtkbgq,1578749316.0,Yep I totally get that. No point in going for a rank of the system is this broke.
GearsOfWar,fdth0l2,t1_fdtcwc1,1578716632.0,I mean we are just playing for fun but I noticed this and I’m just blown away at the logic
GearsOfWar,fdtb043,t3_en29bp,1578714237.0,"So, a friend and I just won a 7-5 match in 2v2 as the Swarm. The 2 COG characters were ""favored"" 35-23. I got MVP and yet we both lost 1,000 tier points? Am I missing something? 

I thought if you beat people better than you, you would go up. Not down lmao what the actual fuck is this game?"
CFB,fdnyihq,t1_fdnxqsd,1578595436.0,Bc it’s better.
CFB,fdlcziw,t1_fdkpgci,1578521382.0,Well I also consider LSU as big a rival to bama as Auburn. Just know too many LSU fans haha plus I had zero fun encounters with LSU fans after 2011 GotC.
niceguys,fdkmddr,t1_fdkcuaf,1578506550.0,Well I guess I'm an embarrassing man. Oh well.
CFB,fdkmb4q,t3_elw26x,1578506511.0,"{Clemson} bc fuck LSU lmao 

Honestly tho, I do hope for a great game and it's not a blowout. Only blowout I want is if Clemson absolutely destroys LSU like they did us last year."
niceguys,fdk4086,t1_fdjlvy6,1578495509.0,Well I was joking and nothing is wrong with being 5'7 even as a man lmao
niceguys,fdk3yjh,t1_fdjjcs7,1578495477.0,'twas a joke
niceguys,fdjj92u,t3_elozhz,1578473369.0,What’s wrong with being 5’7”?!?!?
marvelstudios,fdelvcr,t1_fdekc8q,1578341777.0,Agreed 100%. The chemistry they made in TWS was amazing and seeing it carried on through the franchise without it being into a romance made me happy. Seeing them interact in Endgame and Steve's reaction to Nat being gone was a punch in the gut and I think it worked better with them being friends rather than a couple.
Overwatch,fdb0khb,t3_ekd1pt,1578252332.0,I love how just a few months ago people were shitting on Blizzard and canceling their accounts. Now they’re going to send them money for skins over the Australian Bush Fires instead of just donating directly.
aww,fd6zfhi,t1_fd6o3ed,1578197612.0,It’s a nerdy D&D reference for performing well lol
aww,fd6f0dg,t1_fd6czyp,1578189981.0,"Nah, Disney has its scummy areas but that ain’t one of them. If anything, the friend of Stitch probably got an inspiration dice for that performance"
aww,fd6846e,t1_fd5vgcy,1578186938.0,They probably switched out for a new Stitch for this very reason. Disney don't play and they know their shit.
rolltide,fd64euu,t1_fd5wfaz,1578185380.0,"I think it's different bc Coop was the only dominate receiver at Bama during his tenure. By dominate I mean like 1st round talent. Judey was 1 of 3/4 dominate receivers and still made the plays he made. They're both great receivers but I think it says a lot that Juedy still made the great plays he made while seeing less targets than Coop probably did.

Granted it says a lot that Coop did what he did with a QB that wasn't Tua and also taking all the coverage he took."
CFB,fd4auqg,t1_fd3xp8a,1578165898.0,"Exactly. What'd I really like to happen is for y'all to absolutely dick down LSU like y'all did to us last year [so I can say this to my coworker.](https://i.imgur.com/xnCXI5C.gif) 

But if I'm honest, I don't see that happening bc LSU is a really, really good football team. Not implying that Clemson isn't or that we weren't last year, I just think this will be one hell of a matchup."
CFB,fd49hub,t1_fd47x1b,1578165591.0,"I mean I respect LSU, y'all beat us this year and deserve to be in the title game. I'm just not gonna pull for y'all lmao"
CFB,fd3rs6j,t1_fd308u9,1578161104.0,"Bc I consider LSU as big a rival to bama as I do auburn. Plus this notion of conference pride makes no sense to me. I mean in certain games I'll pull for the SEC but it's not bc I want the SEC to win, it's mainly bc of who's playing."
CFB,fd2p1cd,t1_fd2cv7v,1578150317.0,"I truly think all 3 of y'all are the best team. Like I can't pick one team over the others bc OSU, Clemson, and LSU are just that fucking good. I hope Clemson wins but I truly think it'll be a last possession type game."
CFB,fd2mrzl,t1_fcy8p2u,1578149444.0,Your bandwagon flair triggers me.
CFB,fcuwmad,t1_fcuu5ep,1577990013.0,"I STILL LIKE HIM BUT MOST OF MY FRIENDS, BOTH AUBURN AND ALABAMA FANS, DESPISE HIM AND CALL HIM A CRYBABY. AS LONG AS HE BEATS LSU HE'LL BE ON GOOD STANDING WITH ME"
CFB,fcuw1q8,t1_fcuji3g,1577989693.0,OUT OF NOWHERE
GearsOfWar,fchwc7e,t1_fchw9em,1577654903.0,I don’t have 13 other friends that play this. I only have 1.
GearsOfWar,fchw32d,t3_eeq4b0,1577654816.0,Free for all is fun as shit! Kinda wish I could play it with some friends tho lol
MovieDetails,fc0uplo,t3_efgp0y,1577300125.0,I really hope they beat Auburn in their bowl game this year. Roll Tide Gophers
