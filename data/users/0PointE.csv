pics,ff344um,t1_ff2o1zx,1579533201.0,"I had exactly these fears before and during most of the movie.  As you mentioned though this is more of a ""proto-joker"" being built in a real world scenario.  By the end it really did paint a picture for me of how a person could actually become the Joker we all know and love.

His Joker, in my opinion, is a plausible development for a schizophrenic with his history in the world of Gotham.  The quote ""I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it’s a comedy"" really drove that home for me.  He becomes so deranged and detached from reality that he does truly believe that it's all a joke even if he knows it's not morally just.  Fast forward to ""The Dark Knight"" where Alfred says ""Some people just want to watch the world burn.""  That's exactly what it's become, in that it's become his reality and his source of joy to see his actions have meaning, whatever that meaning is.  He's found the best way to get everyone to pay attention and he loves it.  People don't have to find it as funny as he does, they never did.

> But it seems like he'd need a sudden burst of intelligence, awareness and wit that the character is not being set up for.

When we meet the Joker in The Dark Knight, keep in mind the time difference between then and the little Bruce Wayne we see in Joker.  He's a pre-teen/teenager there, whereas he meets the Joker as Batman when he's in his 50s.  Although obviously the timelines aren't exactly in line because the Joker isn't an elderly man there it still does leave a lot of time, with a little wiggle-room, for a lot to happen to shape him into the Joker we know."
