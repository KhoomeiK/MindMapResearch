depression,fdjko5p,t3_elp7f7,1578475390.0,"Sounds like symptoms of depression. Anhedonia in particular. You should talk to someone about it, it could get worse, much worse."
depression,fcwxuym,t1_fcwjj2z,1578042287.0,"Wow. 
You are arrogant,ignorant and pretty toxic.
Guess that we should discard all the genetic and environmental components of depression/personality disorders and just say that ""people are pouty, that's their fault"".
You can't even defend your argument other than guessing my age being a third of what it is and calling yourself ""grown up"".

You hadn't much experience with the topic, and it shows. There are people that would hurt themselves if you'd say that to them. 
Depression can paralyze you so that you can't even bring yourself to pour a glass of water when you are thirsty. The anhedonia that sometimes accompanies this can take away the joy from the activities that otherwise would make you feel better.
So, if you had a little hiccup in your daily life that made you feel somewhat melancholic but not really please just shut up. 

If someone, like you seem do have been since that is your experience, is just being pouty and a little sad: that's something they could do.

If instead they're depressed or have another mental illness: your advice is utter shit and could seriously harm them. Better go to a therapist instead.

If you want to be immature, replying with ""lol, I'm old so I'm right"" then continue,please,we all need a good laugh. 
But I know that if you said what you said to the people I know that have a genuine illness they would absolutely not get anything useful out of that, at most they would get demoralized."

depression,fcqzrlt,t1_fcqtu0a,1577894653.0,"Hahaha,funny. You don't know me,say useless dumb stuff like ""just get well duh"" and pretend to know more than the average dude here.
This is a confirmation that you know jack shit about the topic. So do us a favour and don't embarrass yourself in this manner anymore,dude."
TrueOffMyChest,fcqj2qc,t1_fcqhf43,1577886891.0,"Learn what? That if something good happens you feel good? 
I'm not in their position, if I could do the things they do I would. But I can't."
TrueOffMyChest,fcqis8d,t1_fcq9ham,1577886744.0,"Yeah,and it really sucks. 
I feel like they have something I can never have, and I particularly hate when they talk about their past good experiences. 
I am """"""happy"""""" for them, but I can't even relate to them. I feel them close only when they suffer and seeing them happy and fulfilled just exacerbates the gap between us. 

I don't want to be like that,I just want to be happy with them and to live. I'm not alive,just a fucking knot of spite and bad thoughts and paranoia and resentment, they on the other hand can do stuff and feel stuff and meet people and not feel like an alien for it.

I don't want to be like this anymore, it would have been better to just off myself somewhere quiet and cease this damn farce. At least I would make their lives just a little shittier and closer to mine. Yeah, I'm not a good friend I guess,just more reasons to end it before I hurt them. 
Just a fucking coward,want it to be as painless as it can."

TrueOffMyChest,fcq2dom,t3_eiecrl,1577877245.0,Thanks. I fucking hate seeing happy and fulfilled people around me having fun together so that's a factor.
