I’m full on top and the Real Sunnie line doesn’t work for me, so I would recommend those, since you’re full on bottom.

Do you usually buy push-ups? If so, stick with 32D. But if you’re usually a 32D in bras without push-up padding, you might need to size up to 32DD after all. Push-up padding takes space in the cup, so a lot of people need to go up a cup size to compensate."

Panache has *great* sports bras. The wired one will eliminate the uniboob look you dislike, and the wires are super padded so they won’t be uncomfortable during exercise. Shock Absorber is also good but I’ve heard more mixed reviews. Panache Sport is like the universal favorite. And the best part is it’s bra sized, so no need to settle for something too big in the band and too small in the bust.

As for what I meant by “vertical support,” that’s a little different in sports bras. Pay no mind unless you’re looking for plain old underwire *bra* bras."

ABraThatFits,ff88qvi,t3_es6u7u,1579669296.0,"I know it sounds crazy, but it’s true!

First of all, you won’t find many good sources of 32I bras in the US. Instead you should search online for your UK size equivalent which is 32G. But please verify to make sure you order UK 32G and not US 32G. You can tell because UK sizes offer double letter cups past DD (for example, FF) while US sizing usually just has DD, DDD, and then single letters only.

A few additional pieces of info to convince you that your suggested size is probably correct:

- Cups that are too small often don’t appear too small to the untrained eye. They can even gape and look too big! It’s because your whole boob isn’t actually going into the cups, which may leave empty space inside but a lot of boob tissue still waiting outside. Make sure to scoop and swoop when you put on bras, because that helps a lot to determine if cups are too small.

- 36D is made for someone with a 36” underbust and a 40” bust. The bust is fairly close but the band is not! The cups are much flatter and the band is much wider than you need. 32G is made for someone with a 32” underbust and 41” bust. That’s much closer! You actually measure very close to 30GG (30” underbust and 40” bust) but you don’t have much “squish” in your ribcage so 32 will be more comfy.

- Cups that are too small will make the band feel too small as well, even if it’s too big! When you aren’t getting the proper support you need from a bra, your boobs push down on the cups. This pushes the band and wires tighter against your chest. To test a band without the cups getting in the way, put on a bra upside down and backwards (band hooked under your boobs, cups hanging down your back). When you do that, the 36D should feel way too loose.

One more thing: your bust measurements are fairly far apart from each other, which suggests you have a projected shape. You need a projected bra. Molded t-shirt bras with foam cups are popular, but not so good for your shape. You should search for bras that have fabric cups (no foam) and vertical seams on the cups. 

Good luck and happy bra shopping!"

2. Was still wearing 32D, which I’d grown out of. Was actually ~30F. Got fitted as 34DD. When I complained about the loose band, they backtracked and said I could do 32DD instead, proving they didn’t even know about sister sizing.

3. This one was very recent. I finally knew how to do my own fitting, but figured some help couldn’t hurt. I called in a fitter and asked her opinion on the best fitting bra I had found.

ABraThatFits,fetyc38,t1_fetr95o,1579381263.0,"We actually use a whole different way of classifying shape. If you want to go through the shape guide of this sub (found in the sidebar/info section) that explains a lot! I’ll explain it below too.

Shallow vs projected: basically, shallow breasts are spread over a wider surface and look flatter relative to their size. Projected is the opposite. To determine which one you have, first look in the mirror, upright and without a bra. Then bend over 90 degrees at the waist. If the shape appears to change a lot between the two positions, you’re probably projected. If it stays about the same, you’re probably shallow. You can also be in between (called average projection).

*From here on out, assume you should always check your shape while bending over, which is much more accurate than standing upright when it comes to shape.*

Wide vs narrow roots: this is where your breast tissue ends on the sides. At your size, it’s probably safe to say if your breast tissue goes past your armpits, you’re wide, and if it doesn’t even reach the beginning of your armpits, you’re narrow. Again there is an in between (average root width).

Tall vs short roots: what’s the distance between your breast tissue and your collarbone? If there’s a lot of space, you likely have short roots; a very short distance would be tall roots.

Close set vs wide set: how close are your boobs to each other? If they touch or almost touch, you’re close set. If you can easily fit a few fingers between them while bending over, that would be wide set. About 2 fingers is typical of your size I believe.

Full on top vs full on bottom: when you bend over, is there more breast tissue above or below the nipple (or whatever the fullest point of your breasts is?) more above that point would be full on top, below would be full on bottom, and there’s also even fullness if it’s about equal.

Center full or outer full: when you’re bending over, do your nipples point out towards the sides, in towards the center, or straight down? Pointing out tends to indicate being fuller in the center, pointing in would be outer full, and straight down is generally even horizontal fullness.

That’s not all of the information by far, but it’s definitely enough to get an idea of your shape and figure out some good starter bras."

Even if it seems huge, you’ve gotta trust us on this. Most people here are shocked when they see their calculated size, but the calculator is rarely off by more than one size. It’s impossible to tell until you actually try it out.

Do you scoop & swoop your breast tissue into the cups when you put on a bra? If not, that could make the cups seem to fit when they’re actually much too small.

You say your major problem is wires digging into your armpits. You also say you’re very projected. That checks out.

I just think it’s sad the idea of the sped up/slowed down metabolism is so ingrained in our lives that hardly anyone questions it. This person is like 18 or 19. He’s almost certainly not growing, so his metabolism is probably at adult levels already.

Someone who’s a true 30DD may be able to wear a 32D without much issue, but the band will be noticeably bigger. By the time you get 2 sister sizes up (34C in this case) it’s just a mess and rarely works.

Just because cup volume is the same doesn’t mean the bra will fit the same.

If you need bigger cups and the same band, go for 32DD."

When you do measurements, don’t be pushy. They’re either in the right mindset to accept a new bra size, or they aren’t. The ones who aren’t still deserve bras in whatever size they prefer, even if it’s a terrible fit.

Just overall treat your customers like human beings. Most women have experienced a bad bra shopping experience, often involving bra salespeople who are rude, insulting, dismissive, or way too pushy. Sometimes even touched inappropriately. I’m sure you don’t do those things, but just being aware of how frequently things like that happen can help to give your customers a better experience."
ABraThatFits,feco8qx,t1_fecmg6c,1578978938.0,"Personally, I’ve tried bras that fit beautifully on the model but fit horribly on me, and vice versa. In fact, now that my cup size has gone down while my roots stayed the same, I’ve become quite shallow and cheap t-shirt bras now seem to fit splendidly. Those are often the ones with awful fit on the models. 

(As one example, Aerie bras fit me great but here’s just one example of a horrible fit they apparently think is okay: https://www.ae.com/us/en/p/9793_7925_461)

However, certain UK brands, which tend to have a broader size range and better quality bras, do put effort into making sure their bras fit their models. So I can see your point in that it may be smarter to stick with brands like that."

ABraThatFits,feckha1,t3_eofni8,1578976118.0,"Models rarely wear bras that fit. The one you linked to is a lot better than some I’ve seen.

I read a post recently that explained why that is. Basically, companies order a very small range of sizes to use for modeling purposes. Then they fit the model to the clothing (and yes, that goes for all clothing, not just bras) rather than the other way around. So they might have a 30D wear a 32A or B because that’s just what they had on hand for the shoot.

It works okay for most clothes - saves them money by only ordering a few pieces of clothing. Bras are harder to work with."

ABraThatFits,fe6l9wh,t3_enzx4b,1578894674.0,"Cleavage is hard to achieve in the correct bra size. Many people have to buy a bra with too small cups in order to get any noteworthy cleavage. 38B or 38A should achieve that, especially if you scoop and swoop (do you know how to do that?)

Side note: 38C is an uncommon size when correctly fitted. Ignore this if you’re happy with your current bras other than the cleavage thing. If you’re overall unhappy with them though, ask and ye shall receive bra sizing advice."
ABraThatFits,fe57d5l,t1_fe54ow6,1578866278.0,"Most of that is good advice but I disagree with the 32C recommendation. OP’s tight underbust measurement is around 31.5” which is much too close to 32” for that band size to be comfortable, except maybe if the brand runs very stretchy."
ABraThatFits,fe53by4,t1_fe52657,1578865290.0,Here’s a video that shows how to do it: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ks6BCcsvrrs
ABraThatFits,fe51f23,t1_fe4tzkq,1578864784.0,"We already know 30B is too small, so that’s out. So is 28C because that’s the sister size to 30B. 

With a tight underbust measurement of 27”, I don’t think you would be comfortable in most 28” bands. 

For those reasons, I think 30C is the correct size for you.

Slight gaping on top points to several possibilities, which I will list below.

- The bras are too shallow. I don’t think this is the case, because your 3 bust measurements are very close together. That points to a shallow shape, so shallow bras should work on you.

- Band is too big. Definitely not the case here; a 30” band should be fine on you.

- Cups are too big or too small. I’m pretty sure you’re in the right cup size, going by your past experiences and the calculator result, so that’s out.

The last 3 possibilities are by far the most likely in my opinion:

- Not scooping and swooping when trying on a bra. Do you know what that is and how to do it? If not I can link to some tutorials (don’t worry, it’s easy). If you already do that, it’s probably one of the next two reasons.

- Cups are too full on the top for you. In that case, it would be a shape issue and you should try some full on bottom styles (I’m not familiar with full on bottom bras available in 30C, so someone else would have to help with suggestions of what to try).

- You’re wearing t-shirt bras, and it’s just how they are. T-shirt bras are the ones with smooth and stiff cups. Because they’re so stiff, when you move around, your breasts shift a little bit but the bra doesn’t. So in some positions it will gape, even if the bra fits just fine."

If you know about sister sizing, 42DD is the same cup size as 40E, 38F, 36FF. Whereas 30DD is the same cup size as 32D, 34C, 36B. Obviously 36B is vastly smaller than 36FF."
