I lost my grandad in 2018 to dementia, he was in his mid-80s. Nan at the time was in hospital recovering from a stroke and couldn't make it to the funeral, 65 years they were married.

He got to see his great-grandson before his condition worsened.

I was meant to be at work for 7am, my alarm didnt go off so I overslept and woke up way past that time. Contemplated calling in to have the day off as 'sleep issues' because I've had them in the past, decided to get my self ready and go to work which is a 30min ride on my motorcycle. 

Got to work, caught up with my manager, aplogised for my lateness, they were okay with it then I carried on as normal.
