mentalhealth,fewpnps,t3_eqrqw1,1579417617.0,"This hits home. I’m a mother myself and I struggle with fighting off my fantasies over suicide. I want the emotional pain and the struggle to end and I tend to feel like the other side has the answer... Usually, when my depression and shame kicks in, I lose sight of the work I am putting in getting better: for my daughter and husband. Yesterday, my mother in law shamed me by saying I NEED to get better and that I shouldn’t be leaving them alone out there (when my social anxiety prevents me from going out to social events). BOOM, my illness takes complete control, and as I said, I lose complete sight of the reason why I am still here. I’m extremely grateful for the leap I have taken in disclosing my illness to my friends and family. Some can’t and don’t want to understand (my MIL) but a lot and a TON of people have called me, sent me messages, etc. I got out of my house and drove to a parking lot. I cried for an hour until I decided to call a friend because I needed help. She said a lot of good things (I am so grateful for her). But this one short message is what touched me the most: 

How empowering is it to think that Ale (my daughter) will be able to look back and think about how hard you worked to be a good mother for her. That’s such a beautiful thing.

The important thing is to recognize and remind yourself that you are trying. The process is painful, it is one of the most difficult things to live in this world. After all, it’s coming from the one thing you rely on to live life - your mind, your brain, your mental health. Forget about being “strong”, be REAL with yourself and with others. Take care of yourself; for your family, for your kids, and for yourself."

Can’t really blame them, but I’m also not going to put myself there to hear all that because it causes me more damage than good - and I start to subconsciously blame myself for not being faithful and happy like i used to be when I was a little girl.

And the friends that I once was attached to because I could identify with, our friendships ended bad to say the least. Sometimes I feel like I want to try to fix things but they’ve become closed minded now.
