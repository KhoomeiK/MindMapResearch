todayilearned,fepfklg,t1_fepc1h4,1579319255.0,"CCA, now Core Civic, is a for profit prison. Say the state determines it costs $1.20 to take care of one inmate. Core Civic (in some states GeoGroup) goes to the state and says ""we can do it for $1.05"". So the state contracts these companies. Now, these private prisons being ""for profit"" and having shareholders to appease wouldn't succeed if they spend the total $1.05 actually taking care of inmates. They get the cost down to 40¢ by skimping on things like food and healthcare while also charging ridiculously high prices for commissary ($1.30 for one bar of Dial or Irish Spring). If you want to see the worst of what CCA has to offer do some Google searches about ""Trousdale Turner Correctional"". Also nobody has ever died at a CCA, somehow they always only die on the way to the hospital. Our local news WSMV ran an exposé on Trousdale Turner, the newscaster whom presented this story Demetria Kaladimos I believe was her name shortly after quit and Core Civic began running ads on the network.

But enough of the civics lesson. During my prison experience I found that incidents of violence to be far higher (I watched a man get stabbed 60+ times), lockdowns more frequent and often for no reason (we were locked down for an entire day because of the eclipse in 2017, and another time because the warden decided ""It would be beneficial""). Staff was incompetent at best and often times dangerously so.

Once I was able to get transferred to a state facility it still sucked but we were treated like humans, food was better, we could get new clothes, the list goes on and on because they weren't benefiting from keeping people incarcerated."
todayilearned,feoxfys,t1_feof11z,1579307489.0,"Spent many years at a CCA prison (South Central Correctional Facility, Clifton, TN) and it fucking sucked. I was eventually able to get transferred to a state run facility, it still sucked but was much better. Got out on parole April 18th after 5 years, 9 months, 8 days. I like freedom a great deal more than any jail or prison."

I had this ""life size"" Taz doll my step-dad one me at Six Flags. I humped the shit out of it until, to my surprise, something happened. I swore I wouldn't do it again but, you guessed it, I did it again. But I knew I had to try to stop before that feeling happened again otherwise I'd make a mess again and I was terrified my parents would find out what I was doing. I wasn't able to stop so I grabbed my dick so hard the head turned purple."
