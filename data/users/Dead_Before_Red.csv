trashy,ffbeciu,t1_ffampth,1579761672.0,"I actually just fired and cut all contact with my best friend/employee on Monday. We’ve spent two years and a fuck load of money getting him sober and supporting him when he slips up. He’s been on a two week bender, so I canned him and cut contact after he decided to “tell me what he thought of me”, which was just a bunch of nasty shit. 

So, after I blocked his number and cut all contact with him, his dad calls me tonight. His dad tells me that ex-employee is ultra drunk and sucker punched both of his parents (who he lives with rent free after he wrecked his motorcycle and crushed his pelvis. Saved his job position for him after that too). Dude’s sitting in jail looking at at least two assault charges and another for hitting a police officer. 

Fuck alcohol man. When my employee was sober, he was a joy to be around and did his job extremely well, we’d hang out after work and shoot the shit or build stuff, whatever. But when he got alcohol in his system, he was an aggressive asshole who acted like a teenager. I still don’t see how that shit is legal. 


Sorry for the rant, I’m pretty upset by it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
