Congratulations on finding this sub and examining your behavior either way though"

SelfAwarewolves,ffb8zge,t1_ffasee1,1579755565.0,I saw it on imgur earlier and thought of this sub too lmao. I still kind of wonder if this wasn't put up by a democrat trying to goad people to pressure the senate
SelfAwarewolves,ffb8qva,t1_ffb2h35,1579755301.0,I think you're confused. I'm making the argument that conservative parents do have trans children

SelfAwarewolves,ffahkni,t1_ff9bng0,1579735905.0,Your second point was my first immediate thought. This statement is demonstrably untrue. Go to any homeless youth shelter and lots of the kids had conservative parents.

AreTheStraightsOK,ff72c7g,t1_ff6q59u,1579639717.0,"they're trying to make money, there's no consistent ideology. Whoever made these probably does believe some of them depending on whether they're male or female and then had to google ideas for ""the other side"" because they wanted to be ""fair"" (but really, because they want to appeal to more people to make that cash). If we could only get these people to admit they have problems then the marriage counseling industry would be more profitable and maybe the greedy would actually do good for the world, but probably not in our lifetimes."

creepyPMs,ff598vi,t1_ff4xmk0,1579584059.0,"You're correct but I don't think she understood that it was going in a sexual way at that point. He said ""my gf is weird, I'll tell her after we've been friends a while"" and she probably believed him, that eventually she'd know about her, it would just take a little longer and he needed to lie in the mean time. I know it doesn't make sense to us, but it probably did to her at the time. She wasn't encouraging him to hit on her, it's more like he was taking advantage of her unusual trusting nature influenced by her autism, which made it easy to convince her that no harm was being done."
creepyPMs,ff58w7j,t1_ff3o9pi,1579583733.0,lmao you do have cute hair. I hope you at least got the actual advice you were looking for.
creepyPMs,ff58tin,t1_ff476pq,1579583666.0,"Like others have said, he lied to you. NEVER talk to a guy who won't tell his girlfriend about you, it's never appropriate. The first red flag though was when he asked ""does me being forward and dominant bother you?"" I realize you may not have been able to recognize it this time, but in the future just know that is the time to stop talking to someone. :)"
FragileWhiteRedditor,ff4gxck,t3_erhni2,1579563340.0,Thankfully women and minorities are never singled out

recruitinghell,ff3kx3y,t1_ff35vht,1579543237.0,"I've explained this to the guy more than once and he literally just refuses to understand it. All he cares about is dragging me off topic so he can tell me he thinks I lack education and that literally all care facilities and firms should just close lmao. I mean, he didn't say that, he said that all firms that dont pay enough and are under staffed should close, probably because he doesn't realize that means all of them and doesn't want to listen to the 3 or so people so far that are telling him that sometimes the free market isn't perfect."
recruitinghell,ff3jzov,t1_ff3ixcz,1579542672.0,"Exactly :/ there are disparities between even relatively compatible professions. Anyone who thinks plastic surgeons are more essential than ER surgeons clearly never needed the ER, but plastic surgeons are the most well-paid doctors by a long shot"
recruitinghell,ff3jtlx,t1_ff2xzch,1579542570.0,"Thank you! You are correct, about all of it. Nursing too. Funny you mentioned it, last week some guy on reddit insisted that no one holds stereotypes about women as default caretakers and I asked him how he explains the disparity between genders in nursing, and he insisted that 1. Since no central agency specifically tells individual women to become nurses, sexism isn't a factor and 2. women do it because it pays REALLY WELL. Some people don't even live on the same planet as us on this site"

This whole ""you can't possibly be happy"" was totally made up in your own head and I don't appreciate it at all. I doubly don't appreciate the way you're pretending you brought all this up for my benefit. It's been pretty condescending and I hope you never need DSPs yourself, but you probably will, so keep that in mind."
recruitinghell,ff2vbju,t1_ff2v5o6,1579525567.0,"I'm not bitching about my job, and that's not at all what the perspective of the people I work for, and wow okay thanks for taking it upon yourself to inform me that you think I need to be better educated. Just kidding. You're being a jerk."
recruitinghell,ff2uzfh,t1_ff2ucq4,1579525206.0,"It's not a company, it's a non-profit. And jobs never do care about who does it, or sometimes even if it gets done. You're reaching and this is all irrelevant anyway. There was literally no reason to bring this up this entire ""wElL aKsHuLly... "" except to be kind of a pedantic ass. The point is, people rely on me to be there when I'm scheduled, so I am. I don't know why it matters to you so much that I know I'm, in your eyes, easily replaced."
recruitinghell,ff2tkra,t1_ff2gybp,1579523598.0,"Now it just seems like you missed the point. Replacability has nothing to do with whether or not what I do is essential and whether or not I should risk the roads to get to work. In any case, the non-profit I work for has never been fully staffed, and we are currently short about 7 full time people, in fact as I type this someone asked me if I could work a double this weekend and they will probably ask every weekend until I die, so to call me replaceable would be misleading.

And this ""if you actually are essential you will get paid enough"" is total garbage. The care industry is the most obvious example, but the economy is littered with market failures, hence the need for a minimum wage in the first place"

MakeMeSuffer,ff2cpd8,t1_ff2c3v6,1579500895.0,"No, you don't. You don't go around accusing old people of promoting bad dental hygiene if they have missing teeth because that would be stupid, and so is this ""I don't like fat people because it promotes bad health"" lie you are trying to sell me. Lizzo is existing in her own body and that doesn't affect you or anyone else in any way. Like I already said, the worst kind of asshole hides behind ""I'm just looking out for youuu!""
