Weaknesses
1. I don't know when to quit at times. Or I try too hard and will literally work until 5am the next day to figure out something.
2. I'm sometimes overly focused, in the zone, and will be oblivious to the world around me.
3. I'm straight forward and technical so I will occasionally fail to buffer my response with empathy.

Mainly that's because my mind can fill in the gaps or I got to read about the character's mindset before. Like we've missed so much in this arc with the story progressing too quickly. So much more is going thru Jinwoo's mind but it's not addressed or mentioned at all. He just appears like a cold cut assassin.
EliteDangerous,ffgdcui,t1_ffg0e1m,1579903726.0,I've been trying to troll this guy. He flys a cutter lately but hasn't been able to kill my hull tank dbx. I think he's just running frags so if you're evasive or fast then he can't target.
EliteDangerous,ffgcozh,t1_fffjbcr,1579903314.0,"I'm currently hunting a ganker in an unshielded hull tank dbx. It's hilarious because they can't kill me. Dbx runs cold and with heat sinks, you're difficult to target."
EliteDangerous,ffgck6f,t3_etct17,1579903230.0,"Warning for those going to Farseer Inc. There are a lot of gankers.

I play open mostly and if you also play open, when you fly to Deciat, watch your comms history tab (the one with the clock). It should show you instantly what CMDRs are in your instance. 

These CMDRs that have the time stamp of ""Now"" are in the same instance. If you see them on your radar as arrows with a hollow center, scan them. If they're wanted them you might want to prepare. 

If you're in supercruise, fast enough and at the right unusual angles, it'll be harder to get interdicted. If you get interdicted, submit because their fsd interdictors are engineered. This eliminates the lengthy fsd cooldown. Boost past the ganker and try to jump. And keep boosting evasively. If you have heat sinks, turn on silent running to make targeting more difficult. Jump once you can and fly straight at the planet. Crash into it if you can because they can't interdict or drop into you if you crash out of supercruise. Once you're close enough to a planet, they can't interdict you anymore.

If you're already dropped and at the planets surface, dock! You're invincible once docked and the station will attack the ganker. Hopefully you're flying something with some decent hull/armor/shields to give yourself the time to dock while being attacked. 

And please turn of auto docking. It wont work when under attack and you need to dock fast.

Good luck."

I'm willing to bet my Vette or Krait would fare fine against this ganker but that wouldn't be as entertaining against a ganker who is renowned for trolling noobs at Farseer Inc, ambushing community events, and shit talking people on the system channel. He ran torps and took down my PVE conda so I thought it was fitting to run torps as part of the response. Otherwise I'm sure many other builds would fare better but there's something hilarious about being a DBX pest that a cutter can't seem to eliminate. He'll more likely combat log against a valid target but a DBX shouldn't be able to survive.

EliteDangerous,ffa7t0m,t1_ff9uf4z,1579729556.0,I got Torpedoed while in a hazres during an engagement with 3 NPCs. By this very ganker I'm hunting actually. I would've seen it if I wasn't occupied since I knew he was a ganker already due to interdictions but I wasn't looking to pick a fight at the time. I've found angle of attack and timing does the trick. Cutters are slow to turn making them vulnerable against a fast DBX.
EliteDangerous,ffa7fnw,t1_ff90b6l,1579729348.0,This ganker was smart. He stopped and fragged the torps once. I applauded him.
EliteDangerous,ffa79c9,t1_ff95o3j,1579729251.0,"I agree it's easy to outrun. But if we're boosting at each other and I release torps at 1000m head on... Well let's say I took out his shields 5-6 times already. And you know cutters are shield tanks. My challenge is my small DBX against and Imperial Cutter doesn't have enough large hardpoints do much to the hull and my initial build was flawed since I was running seekers hoping to take out the drives. I've refitted the seekers with an overcharged MC with corrosive and plan to module snipe.

So can he outrun. Yes. And has he defeated my torps? Yes. Has he always been successful? No. I give him props honestly for fragging the torps. He knows they're coming now but 4 torps seem to do the trick 80% of the time.

I'm purposely not using my Krait Mk2 for cost and trolling reasons. Cutter taking down a DBX is expected but if I can pull off the opposite then it's just too much fun."
EliteDangerous,ffa6fr6,t1_ff92uau,1579728796.0,"Interesting idea but given it's hull damage I'm trying to inflict, I'd think munitions are better? I'd use rails if I wasn't such a bad shot with fixed weps."

I've managed to log in while he's mid gank and provide cover to any new players while broadcasting to system that he's ganking (which is likely why I can't find him lately or maybe he blocked me).

He fancies himself a troll and won't seriously PvP so if I thought it'd be more interesting if I just tried trolling the troll. I'm seriously hunting this guy down with a ship designed to troll his build... Unsuccessfully I might add :)

Serious PvP players have warned that he is a logger so I'll see. Personally I've found it entertaining to build dumb builds and put them to test against the troll. With all the shit talk he does after ganking a ton of people, I think this is fitting :)

EliteDangerous,ffa28r7,t1_ff9ucyn,1579726428.0,"Which is part of the challenge and the hilarious part of trolling the troll.

My latest strategy is simple.

With a hull tank, I put 4 pips to engines and two pips to weps. Against a cutter, the DBX literally just dances around. Furthermore, the DBX is a cold ship and with 3 heatsinks and 1 chaff, Im entirely in silent mode. 

Doing so, despite the cutter having dropped a SLF, I am not taking much if any damage as the cutter cannot maintain or keep up as I dance around. The last encounter was with seekers meaning I have plenty of time to lock which further means I have plenty of time to snipe modules with a gimballed large MC. So 4 torps to shield generator and then mc snipe drives and then powerplant.

He's a logger so likely he'll just log out but that's enough to call victory."

Personally, I go mining so I can afford my combat activities. Combat isn't that profitable and ammo isn't cheap. Especially powerplay can quicky rack up costs so mining made it safer to build up the bank for rebuy and to pay off undermining bounties. Now it's less ROI and less reliable.

For my first kid, we were still at 1 month which I thought was amazing already. I became nocturnal because I took the evening to morning shift and was messed up when I went back to work. Work is so much easier than taking care of a kid. I was raised by a mother who had high expectations and seeing the hardships of breast feeding, pumping, and birthing, I felt the least I could do was help the baby sleep, feed her, swaddle her, sing to her, etc.

I'm excited to get 4 months for our second child because I saw how hard it got for my wife when I went back to work after the first month.

I don't fully understand the reasons fully but after what I've done to raise my daughter, I think parents need at least a year of leave to truly prepare a child to succeed in the world as the brain development is still occurring during this time.

This article explains well the value of extending paternity leave and I don't want to butcher it: [https://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/rbec/en/home/blog/2019/five-reasons-for-paternity-leave.html](https://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/rbec/en/home/blog/2019/five-reasons-for-paternity-leave.html)   
Quoting for anyone too lazy to click: 

>1. **It’s still quite rare.** Though men’s uptake of parental leave is rising marginally across the globe, almost two thirds of all children under twelve months around the world (approximately 90 million people) [reside in countries with legislation that do not allow fathers to have a single paid day of a paternity leave.](https://www.unicef.org/kyrgyzstan/press-releases/two-out-of-three-newborns-live-in-countries-with-no-paid-paternity-leave) In Kyrgyzstan, the country where I currently live and work for UNDP, child care leave can be used by the father, mother or any relative or custodian taking care of a child.  However, as men are generally the main breadwinner in the family, their ability to take parental leave is limited because it is unpaid.   
>  
>2. **A cultural double standard persists.** Fathers are adulated for doing what they should normally do, while the mother's role is taken for granted as child care should fall mainly on them.  The praise I received from friends and parents just because I was home for my son’s birth or because I took four weeks to look after him and be with my wife made me realize that what seemed so normal to me may not yet be true for many.  
>  
>**3. Raising a newborn is an extraordinarily stressful experience and has the potential to create a complex, isolated and secluded environment for a new mother.** Paternity leave gives fathers the opportunity to be a primary caregiver and to recognize and appreciate the unique challenges of the role – for both parents. It also takes the pressure off new mothers, who often feel like they’re facing this challenge alone.  
>  
>4. **Child care is clearly a responsibility of both parents**. Paid leave should be framed not only as a benefit that helps working women, but also as critically important for the well-being of working families. Paid paternity gives new families the chance to bond and allows fathers to provide critical support in caregiving. Setting these standards early means they are more likely to become the norm.  
>  
>**5. More engaged and involved fathers benefit women’s empowerment.** Dedicated fathers taking leave support women to boost their own careers. Seeing fathers are caregivers reduces gender discrimination in the labor force, including the pay gap (paternity leave decreases wage loss for women).

On a side note, in other countries like Europe or Australia, people at my company actually get up to 2 years of leave but I'm in California so I guess 4-6 months is our cap."

TwoXChromosomes,fdjkgex,t3_elmfsz,1578475076.0,"As I child I thought doctors were like white mages that could heal the sick. I grew up and my mom got cancer and I learned that unless you ask, most doctors won't check much of anything. You literally have to pursue and demand aggressively your health. She got an inflamed pancreas and went to ER. Doctors said they didn't see anything and sent her away. She demanded they check more and more and finally someone found she had stage 3 pancreatic cancer 3 months later. Even then the doctors didn't really give her much and she continued to demand treatment and care. She was stronger than I'll ever be has been gone for a year now but the lesson I learned is to fight for your health. They really won't care to check and too often women are dismissed of their symptoms to a point it pisses me off. Fight for your health and good job doing so!"
