Oh, yeah, I guess and congrats and everything...but what a gorgeous boy!

But seriously, congratulations!! :-)"
cats,fdo10jf,t1_fdnvz3y,1578596900.0,"You need to keep her inside from now on.   There are zero excuses or questions about that.  The people that are telling you this are 100% correct.  

If you haven’t vaccinated her against feline leukemia you need to get her tested ASAP.  You have no idea what she may have been exposed to outside.  I can tell you, from having watched a beloved cat wither away from that awful disease, this is NOT the fate you want for her.

Edit:  I’ll add this - we discovered his leukemia status when he was super skinny, limping and too weak to jump up on anything.  Stupid naive me thought he was just being lazy.  Please be a responsible pet owner, or don’t own any damn pets."

politics,fcwt06k,t1_fcws9rd,1578036395.0,"Who is celebrating?  Shia on Sunni?  Iraq and Iran are majority Shia.

Second, this was an attack carried on Iraqi soil without their knowledge or approval, which is a slap in the face of their sovereignty - something that Iraqis want more of, not less of. 

Third, this action puts Iraqi lives on the line from Iranian retaliation on US targets in Iraq. Even Bush and Obama refused to target this guy for fear of starting a war.

This totally fucks up our standing in the Middle East."
politics,fcwmzeo,t1_fcwlcz2,1578030244.0,"I don’t think it is anymore.  3 or 4 years ago or even under W. and Cheney I wouldn’t view this as serving Russia’s interest, but we don’t live in that time anymore.

Russia is consistently putting its foot on the scale pushing this administration to do its bidding.  They know this is a right wing wet dream, so why not nudge a stupid decision in a direction that serves their long term interest?  All Putin has to do is tell trump that Iran is making him appear weak or ineffectual, and he will do something batshit insane like this.

Look what happened when he abandoned the Kurds.  It handed Syria to Russia, and drives a wedge between Turkey and NATO when they start shelling the Kurds.  This screams Putin manipulating Trump to achieve Russian goals."
politics,fcwcpkv,t1_fcwalcc,1578022362.0,"Putin will have the Middle East after this.

I have very little doubt that Putin pushed him to do this on that call.

We will get kicked out of Iraq, which will give it to Iran, who are close buddies with Russia.

This dumb mother fucker needs to be removed NOW."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fbcsyj4,t1_fbc4kdk,1576732838.0,"I live in Detroit.  This is the first I’ve heard of this.

I don’t have words to describe how horrible this is."
