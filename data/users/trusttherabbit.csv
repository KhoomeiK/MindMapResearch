reactivedogs,ff5damy,t3_erkoob,1579588111.0,"There is some excellent advice here, so I just wanted to add something about shelter dogs. I worked for a rescue for 6 years and have fostered 100 dogs or so. A dog’s behaviour in a kennel is often very different to their behaviour in a home. However, that first period of being in a home is the most challenging for a dog and his new owner and often things mellow. 

I don’t think that you’ve done anything wrong and you certainly haven’t ruined your new dog. Imagine you’re him: he knows you, but now he’s in a home in a place he doesn’t know. You don’t know what kind of socialisation he’s had in the past, so everything might be new to him. Plus he just had an op and he’s probably sore and feeling a bit different hormone wise. I’d probably be a bit reactive to the world too!

The main thing is not to panic. He needs you to be as calm and relaxed as you can (easier said than done I know!) so you can show him the world isn’t scary. Take a minute to moderate your breathing because he will pick up on it if you’re tense. 

Take it really slow and gently with one another. Now is a good time to start some basic obedience training with him. It’s good bonding for you both and will help his impulse control. It’ll also help tire him out mentally and that may help with his reactivity. 

I’ve known a lot of dogs who are worried by people carrying shopping bags. They rustle and they make people look bigger and more intimidating. My dog was a rescue from a puppy farm and was 5 when I got him. He’d never lived in a house and we had a big shopping bag issue, plus umbrellas, hoods and hats issues. I will never forget the awful time I let him off lead and he ran up to this homeless dude carrying loads of black bags. The guy was terrified and kept shouting “help, I don’t feel safe”!  My dog weighs 8 kilos and has no teeth, so I know he can’t harm anyone, but that poor guy didn’t. I bought him some lunch and went home more embarrassed and mortified than I’ve ever been!

Thankfully, we did get past that issue with training and socialisation. I spent a lot of time in my local park with my dog sitting on a bench and watching the world go by. I taught “look at me” with treats to distract him when something that would trigger him went by. I always put my thumb downwards in the dogs collar (at the front), so I’ve got them securely and am not yanking back on the collar if something causes a reaction. I’m holding the lead too, but I try to avoid the collar pressure in case the dog feels like I’m pulling them back because I’m scared. Your dog might not be ready for this yet, but it’s something to bear in mind. 

I think you mentioned trigger stacking in some other comments and I think that’s a good thing to bear in mind. Keep things as low key as you can and set him up for success. Had a 10 minute walk with no reaction. Take him home and praise the heck out of him! You want small victories so you can tell him how much of a good boy he is!"

Dogtraining,feicbj1,t3_ep80ye,1579135174.0,"I agree that it’s a good idea to get your dog to the vet, but also wanted to offer some short term help in the meantime. 

If I have a dog that behaves the way your dog is (I foster dogs and look after other people’s) I do a number of things. I always leave a light lead on them, which means I’m able to get them to move safely without getting growled at. I look after a dog who will resource guarding my sofa, so he’s not allowed on them anymore. I’ve taught him “go to your bed” and that has helped. If he tries to get on the sofa I remove him with the lead. 

Try not to get into any conflicts if possible. My dog used to growl when I moved him off the sofa, but I started to use food as a lure and that helped. 

I’m not sure how you’re handling it with your dog, but please don’t tell him off when he growls. Stopping warning growls can make the dog stop giving an important warning and they may move straight to biting. 

Where possible, try to ignore the growling. Praise good behaviour and try not to panic! I suspect your dog may be disconcerted by the move and is trying to control his new environment because of it. It may not last and it can be managed if it doesn’t."

reactivedogs,fdtzffh,t3_emujfn,1578724788.0,"I would imagine that the standard poodle part of Archie is playing a part here. They are guard dogs and have a different personality to the smaller poodles. I have met a number of cockapoos like Archie and look after a labradoodle (crossed with a standard poodle) who behaves a bit like him. He  is definitely guarding you, so you need to take that seriously. My advice would be to tackle it on a few different fronts. 

Firstly, you must stop allowing him to follow you everywhere. This is really important. Dogs tend to follow people for one of two reasons: 1. They think something exciting might happen and they want in on it. 2. They’re anxious about their humans wellbeing and want to keep an eye on you. In this case I suspect you have number 2, so this needs to stop. You need to show Archie that you’re perfectly capable of doing things on your own and that he doesn’t need to be on alert. It’ll also help his separation anxiety. I use a mixture of teaching “stay” and getting it to be a secure command, shutting doors and using baby gates. 

Secondly, training him to focus on you during walks. [This](https://pethelpful.com/dogs/Changing-Dog-Behavior-Through-LAT-Look-at-That)  technique is brilliant for reactive dogs and there are tons of YouTube videos and articles that explain it. I would try to walk him everyday using this technique. 

On top of that, I think that taking him somewhere quiet away from other dogs when you’re out and playing with him would help. When a dog is at daycare and is all about dogs when they’re out, it can sometimes mean they don’t view their owner as fun. If this is the case, then they are less focused on you because you’re not as important. Take some toys with you and play with him or do some training. He’ll listen more and it will help with the LAT training. 

Finally, it’s time to set him up for success at this stage and stop situations from happening. You do know some of his triggers, so you can predict some issues. You’ve described the situation where a friend gets in your car and Archie reacts. From now on, that needs to stop. If a friend is getting in the car, then Archie gets out first and is allowed back in when your friend is in there and he is calm. He’s not in charge of guarding the car - you are. 

Make sure you go out in front of him when you leave the house. You’re in charge of checking out what’s going on and he can follow. The labradoodle I look after has been helped by this. He used to dash out ahead and lunge at people. Now he sits and stays while I open the door and we exit with him behind once I’ve checked that there’s nothing there for him to lunge at. 

Dogs love routine and they like consistency. If you start to look at situations he’s reactive in and change them so you cut out the possibility of a reaction, you can give him a ton of praise and then you both feel good! 

I hope that some of that was helpful. I’m sure that you can get Archie past a lot of the behaviours he’s displaying with time and training."
Dogtraining,fdre01x,t3_emu2mr,1578683096.0,"What time do you feed her in the evening? My first inclination is to say she might need a poop, so feeding her later might be a good idea. 

If I look after puppy like this, I do a late feed (around 9pm) and take them out for a walk or garden trip then. I do another garden visit just before I go to bed. Then I know that if they’re whining it’s because they want attention rather than being desperate for the toilet. Some people also take water away at night for this reason. 

At the moment, the minute you get up, she’s received a reward for whining and that’s become the problem. So it’s time for some serious ignoring! Be prepared to be woken up early with some serious whining. I normally take a drink, snack and a book to bed with me and settle down to get woken at 4am. Ignore the whining. She is fine and she will stop. Once she has, that’s the time to go to her and tell her she’s a good girl. She get a reward for not whining and you should (hopefully) get a better night sleep!"

I had a suggestion, but i don’t know much about cats so sorry if it’s not helpful!

I know Kat is feral, but would it be possible to start training her to go in a cat carrier? Could you do something like put it outside and put her food in there? If she ever gets sick, then it’s going to be really hard to get her to the vet. If you start training her now and she’s familiar with the carrier, it would be a lot easier for you to get her to the vets if she gets sick."
reactivedogs,fdr2eff,t1_fdqzm2m,1578678571.0,"That’s really good to hear that you’re doing a mindfulness course. I hope that you find it helpful. I was really sceptical and a bit defensive when I started doing it, but it’s helped my anxiety a lot. 

I foster dogs and board them too and have had a fair few reactive ones over the years. Stopping to take note of my level of anxiety and sort my breathing out has been really helpful. I look after a labradoodle who is reactive (and aggressive) to scooters, skateboards and wheelchairs and I sometimes forget to breathe when we’re on a walk because I never know which wheeled thing will appear!"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdqz318,t1_fdqddyn,1578677142.0,"I’m a Brit and I’m not into the royals, but this morning I spent some time with a friend who is and it helped me understand what was going on:

At the time Meghan and Harry got married, lots of pro royalists were dead against it. The “official” version is because they thought she was too much of a career woman and would split Harry from the royal family because she’d want to go back to the US and revive her career. Meghan hasn’t been grateful enough at the honour of being in the royal family, nor is she the meek and mild wife that she’s expected to be.  

The unofficial version (or the subtext that I read into it), is that the people saying this stuff are racist and sexist. Meghan is being presented as a manipulative woman, who has told Harry what to do. In this version, Harry is a pussy whipped glove puppet in her thrall. By rejecting a place in the royal family, she’s offended the royalists her and gave them (and the piece of crap that is Piers Morgan) a chance to tell everyone else that they told us this would happen! 

At the moment Meghan is a massive bitch and the worst member of the royal family according to royalists. Interesting that they would choose to demonise a woman who has committed no crimes and seems like a decent human being, but continue to ignore and not push for investigations of Epstein’s friend Prince Andrew."
reactivedogs,fdq2gvj,t3_emi3hg,1578651606.0,"I’m sorry that you and your dog have had a rough time. Sounds like having a muzzle is a good idea to help on walks. 

Dogs are extremely tuned into humans breathing, so if your breathing is fast due to anxiety then your dog will know. There are some basic apps that you can get, which show you how to moderate your breathing. Most of the times there’s a visual guide and some counting, so you match your breath to the guide. If you could do this before a walk and focus on it during the walk, you’ll both be calmer. I find it useful when I’m anxious. 

You could also try some yoga and some mindfulness practices. They’re both ways you can look after yourself and help ease some of your anxiety. I think it would benefit you both."

dogpictures,fdhjerq,t1_fdhi7bb,1578423912.0,"Fair enough, it’s difficult hearing that stuff. It’s good to leave the dark stuff behind and focus on now. Dogs are so good at that and they adjust really well. Mine was so timid and now he whacks me with his paw if he wants me to stroke him!"
dogpictures,fdhinlb,t1_fdhgshl,1578423450.0,"Both OP and myself are from the UK where guns are hard to get hold of, so it’s not that good of an option.

The bottom line is that people involved in puppy farms are involved in cruelty to animals everyday. My dog was 5 when I got him and his teeth were crumbling and falling out, but no one helped him. He could barely eat and was emaciated. He lost most of his sight in one eye and had a scrotum infection. He was in agony. He was kept in a cage in a shed and was hit by his “caretakers”. Imagine being presented with 100 dogs like my dog everyday and being ok with that? If you’re ok with that, then you’re probably ok with them being killed in the cheapest way possible."

dogpictures,fdhfe32,t1_fdhe96e,1578421485.0,Money and secrecy. They can’t use a vet because they would see the state of the dogs and report it. Plus they want the dogs killed as quickly and cheaply as possible. Dog fighters do the same thing when they have an injured dog or a dog that isn’t up for fighting.

dogpictures,fdgv2hk,t1_fdgtlji,1578409047.0,"I know, it’s awful. I used to work for a rescue and I spent a lot of time fostering and working with ex breeding dogs from puppy farms. They are some of the most damaged and neglected dogs I’ve ever seen. 

Having been around it, I think that the people running the farms just see money. Why would they attempt to kill a dog via injection when they could do it for free? Why would they get vet care for a sick dog when they could kill it and replace it? It’s an appalling way to look at an animal. My dog was rescued from a puppy farm when he was 5 and he was in a really bad way, so I’m passionate about it. 

People really need to be aware and be very cautious about where their puppy is coming from. I live in the UK and I’m horrified by how little research people do when it comes to buying a dog. By buying from these places, we are just helping condemn more dogs to a miserable and painful life. My dog has two genetic issues, so it was really irresponsible to have bred from him.

reactivedogs,fblz0cc,t3_edwphw,1576973985.0,"Sounds like your dobie had a really poor start. I think it’s awesome that you’ve taken her in. 

One of the things to keep in mind is the age of your puppy. Around this time a puppy experiences a fear stage and some of the behaviour that you’re experiencing (being scared of something one day and not the next) is typical of this. It’s worth doing a bit of reading and to factor this into what’s going on right now. 

If she hasn’t really seen the outside world before, then she’s probably a bit overwhelmed and scared. This is probably why her pooping is an issue. Crouching down to poop is a really vulnerable position for a dog, plus the world is so full of distractions that it’s hard for her to focus. 

Where possible, be as calm as you can when she’s scared. I breathe deeply and try not to react when the dog does. You need to be feeding back your confidence to her. Sounds like you’re doing great using “watch”. 

It might help to start putting a command to her peeing and pooping. There are a ton of resources if you google, but [this one](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/dogs.kinja.com/5-steps-to-teaching-your-dog-to-pee-and-poop-on-command-511788518/amp) gives you the basics. I’m always amazed by how quickly dogs pick it up. 

A trainer told me recently that puppies have to circle before they poop. She said that if you think your puppy needs to go, you can simulate the circling around by using the lead. Sometimes this can make a poop happen. I haven’t tried it yet but I thought it was worth mentioning!"
