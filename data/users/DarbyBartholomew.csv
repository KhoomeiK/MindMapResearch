politics,ffqgtl2,t1_ffphoy5,1580134181.0,"That's what irritated me the most about the whole thing - if Pompeo is actually stupid enough to think it's a plausible lie to suggest that Mary Louise fucking Kelly of all people pointed to Bangladesh on map when trying to point out Ukraine, then I've been giving him WAY too much credit up to this point... It's just such a Busch League lie."
politics,ffqerzo,t1_ffqdk4d,1580132430.0,"Which is extra unfortunate because I'm sure that person did everything right and told Pompeo exactly what he was supposed to, but now Pompeo needs a fall guy"

Suggesting that she would point to Bangladesh, of all places, when there are so many other countries closer to Ukraine that could be easily mistaken as Ukraine is just... Stupid. It's a stupid lie, that could have been made much more believable, but wasn't.

Edit: someone pointed out elsewhere in the thread that he may have meant Belarus, which would have been much more in the ballpark - still, if you're going to send out an official statement, the smart move would be to make sure you're actually referring to the country you think you're referring to."
politics,ffj84zu,t1_ffj7zfj,1579992748.0,"Yeah, I've noted that the people who scream about trying to overturn the 2016 election never seem to feel the same vigor about the 2018 election in which the American people gave the Democrats a clear majority in the house, knowing full well that they would then have the ability to impeach."

AnimalsBeingBros,ffgl5ov,t1_fffnypd,1579908767.0,"I've been thinking about getting a dog lately and this is what keeps me from getting any closer - thinking through the whole process of a new dog becoming the most precious thing in the world to me, only to watch it eventually wither and die, is one of the most heartbreaking thing I can imagine. 

Don't get me wrong - I get why it's worth it. I even understand how selfish my position is - every moment I waffle is another moment a shelter dog sits unloved, waiting to die. But damn. That's a lot to take on."

AskReddit,fdxwua5,t1_fdx4q7i,1578773751.0,This one's my biggest pet peeve. Your signal should tell me you're about to brake - seeing you braking shouldn't tell me that you're about to signal.
technews,fdoval3,t1_fdoccx0,1578613678.0,"From the infographic at that link, I believe Bing is larger because of ""metasearch engines"" which really just piggy-back off of mainstream search engines; I.e. ask.com is really just giving you the Google search results with a different front end. More of these metasearch engines use Bing's results (I assume this is a service both Microsoft and Google offer, and would further assume that Microsoft's service is considerably cheaper), therefore Bing gets a larger number of raw searches than Google does when metasearches are included.

Edit: about 5 seconds after I posted this I more thoroughly read the people that had already replied and saw that someone already gave essentially this answer. Hopefully this is a more thorough explanation, I guess?"
