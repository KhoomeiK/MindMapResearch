iamverybadass,ffcnenk,t1_ffajpcp,1579803157.0,"I have one too, they're fantastic for fine work, but I've found the box cutter a little sturdier since the trapezoid blades are a bit thicker.."
gopro,ffcn5zd,t1_ffbt86y,1579803006.0,"My mistake, a quick Google told me 3 onwards had 4k, which I didn't know any better, only had a GoPro since the 6. As for stabilisation, they're going for the shaky found footage effect, which stabilisation makes harder to achieve. The Shorty or Handler, or any generic grip and a little practice would get the effect OP is after."
gopro,ffbj0um,t3_esp8i6,1579767575.0,"Any of them really from the Hero 3 onwards would do, they all shoot 4K. Just turn stabilisation off since you're going for the shaky found footage effect.

They all have mics, though GoPro default audio isn't that great. If you can, track down a GoPro mic adapter, and a Rode VideoMicro. 

As for being dropped, GoPro's are generally pretty sturdy, but most will come with the frame they ship in. Otherwise there's hundreds of OEM and aftermarket parts to choose from, though for older cams genuine stuff will be a little pricer for good condition stuff die to scarcity."
iamverybadass,ffa51o2,t1_ffa4ash,1579728024.0,"It's a weird transition going from form > function when you're young to function > form when you're older and more experienced. Don't notice it at the time, but suddenly all your stuff just works all time when you need it to."
aussievapers,ffa1uow,t3_esb6w0,1579726199.0,"VE does phenomenally well to get orders out as quick as possible, shit, all the vape stores do. The issue is AusPost. As an example, I ordered a pair of sunnies from the US. FedEx picked em up, and had them in Sydney inside 36 hours. 2 hours later they cleared customs. It then took AusPost 11 business days to get them from Sydney to Townsville."
iamverybadass,ff9zvoe,t1_ff9u2r0,1579725045.0,"Exactly. Bought one when I was early 20s, because I thought it was badass, it made my dick hard, and I thought it would be the best knife ever. I think I used it like 3 times in the 5 years I had it. Stupid thing was unwieldy, and always catching on shit due to its size. Bought a Kinchrome folding box cutter, and use it daily. Fits perfectly in the coin pocket of my jeans. Kbar has been relegated to the back of a drawer somewhere."

gopro,ff5o198,t1_ff5nys3,1579602604.0,"Yeah, it's a fantastic idea on paper, but sadly very poorly implemented. Shit, I'd be happy if they just added the ability to upload manually through the website."
gopro,ff5nvtp,t3_ersn3n,1579602374.0,"Quik is trash whether you have plus or not. Plus is for replacing your camera no questions asked if you wreck it, half price accessories, and cloud back up. I only have it for the accessories and ""insurance"". I back up all my edited vids to Google, since I have  GoogleOne, and keep raw footage on USBs."
mildlyinfuriating,ff5nml5,t1_f3rjwfm,1579601982.0,It's *Mountain Blast* flavour with a *Berry Ice* label.

mallninjashit,ff44ys3,t1_ff43irg,1579555647.0,"You'd be essentially flash-banging yourself. Sniper rifles are a handy piece of kit to have *in certain circumstances*. A CQB rifle like any of the shorty AR variants, or a bullpup design,  hell, even a shotgun or pistol will be much more effective."
GelBlaster,ff40h27,t1_ff3vhwr,1579552857.0,Really not that that different from a blaster.
suits,ff40dnl,t3_eregdh,1579552797.0,Well it kinda does belong in the sense that you could follow the guide to dress like Harvey.
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff3ztu1,t3_ercsao,1579552457.0,Reminds me of the politician from the first xXx movie. Where's Vin Diesel when you need him?
