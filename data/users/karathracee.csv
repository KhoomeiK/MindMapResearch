fatlogic,ffeyg7f,t1_ffcsgyo,1579870382.0,"Yeah, bad research went into this. Those are indeed the ranges labeled 'average' when you look at a body fat percentage chart, but they're not the actual average in the US. The most recent numbers I see on that are more than a decade old, so it's likely higher now, but it has the average man at 28% bf and the average woman at 40%.

femalefashionadvice,ff7nl01,t1_ff79l65,1579653841.0,"The trick in that situation (and I have been there, freelancing) is to live on last month's income (and to build up your emergency fund so your minimum expenses are covered if you go a few months without any hours from the unreliable job, but that's getting more into personal finance advice). So February's budget depends on what you earned in January, and therefore can be set ahead of time. If in February you don't earn much, than there is no clothes budget for March. It can take a little time build up a buffer if you don't already have one, but once you do, life becomes a lot less stressful (which might make it easier for you to spend on clothes are other stuff that are a need, but also something you're used to doing without)."
minimalism,ff7fvze,t1_ff76p72,1579648610.0,Yes! This is a great idea. Especially since OP seems equally concerned with losing the memories associated with these objects as he is about the objects themselves. Writing down what made those times special might help.
femalefashionadvice,ff76z1c,t1_ff7495r,1579642347.0,"I used to have the same problem when I first started working! I hadn't bought clothes for literally years, nothing I had fit, most things were falling apart despite my attempts to mend them. And I finally had a steady job, so I could buy clothes, except I couldn't get myself to do it? I remember feeling like if I spent any of my money, it would all be gone like magic, so I just...couldn't spend. Two things helped me: budgeting and thrifting. I know thrifting is everyone's answer to everything on this sub, but it helped me be less impulsive about things, because I'd have to walk to the thrift store and spend a lot of time finding things and trying them on. Having lots of time to think, with no fear of missing out (online, things can sell out in your size in an instant, but in a store, if you're standing their holding something, it can't) really helped me actually buy some things I needed.

Budgeting was huge for me too in a lot of ways. It helped me see that even if I spent x amount of money on clothing, I was still saving y every month and I would have z amount for next months bills. I knew I wasn't overspending, and I could kind of give myself of quota to fill since I really did need some new things. It still took me a long while to buy a new winter coat that was actually warm enough, though. I don't know if either of these speak to the issue you're having, but I hope it at least turns your thoughts in a helpful direction!"
StudentLoans,ff65xby,t3_erp4gr,1579619913.0,"At the beginning of a loan, more of the money you pay is going to go toward interest; your impact becomes greater the more you decrease the principal. How much of the debt is at 6%, and what's your credit score like? If it's a significant chunk, it could be worth checking out refinancing. You can get quotes from a few places and run the numbers yourself to see if it would save you money/how much.

But the fastest way to get rid of debt is simply to pay more towards it. There's no reason this debt should be with you for so long; taking 20+ years to repay 50k could mean paying tens of thousands just to interest. Take a hard look at your budget, and see if there's any more money you could throw at your loans on a monthly basis. When you get bonuses or money from gifts, put a chunk of that towards the loans, too. I know being debt free feels far away now, but the harder you work at it, the closer it'll get until one day you'll be there."

With the symptoms you listed, it sounds like eating something hot and simple to make was the smartest thing to do. Honestly, being outside that long in weather like that, your body was probably like, this is the end. I know it's easier said than done, but try not to blame yourself for eating like that when you were basically in a survival mindset."
fatlogic,feocnyh,t1_fenim2d,1579298211.0,"I think whenever you try to apply a broad instruction to bodies, there are going to be some outliers due to the variability of humans. It sounds like you have a short torso, so it's possible your natural waist measurement will be the same as the measurement used for obesity calculations. For a lot of people, especially taller people or those with longer than average torsos, there's a difference in the measurements so it's worth pointing it out."
fatlogic,fenfyxl,t1_fenf32e,1579283860.0,"In this case, 'just above' can be taken to mean 'immediately above,' as in, feel where the hip bones end, and measure at the point where there is no more hip bone. They don't give a distance because the distance is as near to 0 as you can get. But it is phrased in a colloquial way, probably because this section of the site is directed at the public and not the scientific community."

Edit: [""To correctly measure your waist, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones.""](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm) I've seen a lot of women who measure at their natural waist instead and misunderstand their risk for obesity-related health issues, since we're so used to using that waist measurement for clothing."
personalfinance,fedglaz,t3_eolefj,1579010966.0,">my taxable income is being taxed at 57%

Not exactly. Since you're self-employed, all your income is taxed 15.3%. So that's 3 grand or so right there; the deduction you get for paying that is part of why your taxable income is only 6.6k. It seems like Turbotax isn't used to having to account for this situation, so it's giving you this 57% number, when actually, your taxable income is being taxed at a rate of 10% (exactly as you would expect). Overall, you're paying a rate of about 17%, which isn't that surprising. But yeah I mean, I've been there, it's a lot of money when you're not making a ton. If you're going to be self-employed again this year, you also need to start making quarterly estimated tax payments or you'll be hit with an underpayment penalty when you go to file for 2020. Let me know if you have any questions about that part and I'll answer them; the process is simpler than it seems at first."
personalfinance,fdhrmja,t1_fdfgfzx,1578428825.0,"Both financially and relationship-wise, it may help you to look at his (and his parent's) history with handling money. It sounds like your boyfriend is responsible (has prioritized getting a good job and has been consistently saving for a house). Did he learn that from his parents? Do his parents have credit card debt or loans to other family members they've never paid back? Is 30k the limit of what he's going to lend them, or would he go higher? 

To put it simply, if this is his money that he's been saving and you're not even engaged yet, he has every right to lend it to family and you have no right to stop him. But you both should use this as an opportunity to figure out your compatibility on the topic, since money can be a huge issue in relationships. I would say to stop fighting, really try to understand his point of view on the issue, and work together to make a plan for how you'll handle money when you're married. Also, you might want to consider if there's stuff in your background that's making you think a certain way about the issue, that would maybe help your boyfriend understand where you're coming from."
