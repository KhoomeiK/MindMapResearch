witcher,ffr4m0y,t1_ffr4bra,1580150343.0,Yeah the trick to the deck is to not have any 2 of the same monster in your hand. If you can get a full hand of unique monsters that pull? You'll annihilate the other guy
witcher,ffr0v9q,t1_ffqzl2s,1580147997.0,Gaunter Darkness cards plus yennefer (for that sweet res) and several other cards I pad my deck with usually gives enough versatility that a well placed horn can easily compensate for weather plus the overwhelming group in my close combat bar.

I did something similar with Malefax where I gave him a ""legendary action"" because he felt too weak. He would just release raw anger the top of every round if he had been hit at least once. Anyone in engaged range makes a coordination check (average) or is pushed back to short range. At the end of the fight, as he died, he released a massive amount of dark force energy that was a hard coordination check which would throw characters back to medium range, and deal damage if they collided with anything in the room. They still kind of breezed through him, but the fight was made more cinematic because of the checks so they had fun."

My take on it, not to call yours wrong, is to have the first actual session be an introductory session. A one shot for the players to get the hang of the characters and the system with a common goal for each of them at the end. This way, even if they dont see eye to eye they will have a reason to work together for the end goal and any characters without pre-built relationships with eachother will have a chance to form camaraderie. Then cap it off with a slight cliffhanger into the actual campaign/story you want to tell.

As an adult, 5 is my favorite just because of the sheer volume of world building they squeezed into that movie without distracting from the overall plot.

But malakos and trilla (her final fight) kept handing my ass to me in this game. Now, let me add that I dont think it's because of ""difficulty"" so much as it's just not as fine tuned as the soulsborne games. Sekiro might have one of the most finely tuned combat systems I've played. And fallen order just feels clunky at times in it's combat in comparison.


Not that this is a bad thing. Fromsoft has been perfecting its combat for almost a decade now over 6+ games. And you can tell alot of love was put onto fallen orders combat. It was a hell of a first attempt and bodes very well for the potential of tight combat in sequels. (For example, this combat is much more tight than Demon Souls for example)"
