blursedimages,fff7oo5,t1_fff0rv7,1579877787.0,"The body material is called Duroplast, cotton fiber reinforced composite plastic. Pretty high-tech for the 1950s. Great material for building cars, since it's light, strong, doesn't rust and can, unlike other composite materials like fiberglass, easily and cheaply be produced in large numbers. They chose this material in order to save on steel. Since the Trabant was produced for decades with little changes under increasingly worsening conditions, the molds used to create body panels wore out, resulting in rather uneven panel gaps.

The frame is still steel, that's why it's not unusual to see rusty door sills on Trabants. These days, Duroplast is most commonly used to make toilet seats, by the way.

Modern cars often use pure plastic for body panels, which is cheape, lighter and thinner, so that's why there isn't anyone making a Duroplast car these days. Back in the '50s however, this was the next best thing. It's quite unfair that people made fun of this aspect of the Trabant, since it was easily its biggest strength. The horrible two-stroke engine, awful build quality and laughable electrics are much more worthy of criticism."

Sooo, you have a really decent CPU (mine's almost the same and it can still handle everything) and a usable amount of RAM. No dedicated GPU, just the one integrated into the CPU. That's your system's Achilles' heel. It's seven years old and wasn't fast when it was new. While DirectX 12 is installed, this GPU fully supports only up to DX 11.

What can it actually do? It's fine for most 2D games, that's for sure. You can play titles like Stardew Valley, for example. Pixel Art should generally be fine. Some more demanding 2D games with more complex visuals might cause issues however. In terms of 3D titles, you can play less demanding e-sports games like Fortnite, Fifa, World of Tanks, Team Fortress 2, CS:Go, Rocket League, Leage of Legends, Overwatch, etc. Almost all of these will only run on lowest settings, however, and do not expect high frame rates. What your integrated GPU can also do is run older AAA games. GTA V for example should run at ""normal"" settings (which are the lowest setting in this game, about equivalent to the Xbox 360 version). If you are fine with minuscule resolutions and frame rates that skirt the edge of playability, then even more games are technically [playable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9gX_ahfcbo), but this isn't going to be an ideal experience and I would advise against it. 

If you are going to continue using this PC as it is, you should at least upgrade the driver. Yours a couple of years old now, which is not ideal if you want to play games. Download and install [this update](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/29313?product=75043). 

By adding a dedicated GPU, you could turn this machine into a very capable gaming PC. First, you'd have to check your power supply however. Open the case and read the make and model and the specs on the side. It's a big block, likely with a fan, that the power cable plugs into. Many GPUs need additional power from the power supply. I think it's best if you just opened the case and took a clear, well lit photo of the inside with your phone. That way, we can see if the required wiring and space for a GPU are there.

A Radeon RX 570 (around €130 in Portugal) would allow you to play every game on the market at medium and often high settings at 1080p. Since your display resolution is just 1366x768 (Thought about upgrading your screen? Feel free to ask if you need help with this...), high settings should be doable nearly all the time, except with some very demanding games like Red Dead Redemption 2.

If you don't have the money for a new GPU, used cards are an option. Search classifieds for capable cards. I'd work my way through [this list](https://www.techspot.com/article/1775-guide-buying-used-graphics-card/). There are good cards out there for as little as €50 that'll massively enhance the performance of your machine, although it has to be said that in this very low price range, even 10 or 20 bucks more can make a huge difference in performance. Google a few of these cards in combination with games that you want to play to find info on their performance, which will come either in the form of professional benchmarks, forum posts of people discussing the hardware or Youtube videos running the game in question (if both card and game are reasonably popular). Check availability, compare a little. If you are unsure or need further help, feel free to ask.

Lost_Architecture,ffd1z1z,t1_ffcx2pb,1579811827.0,"It's almost never that easy. Older buildings tend to use space very poorly and even based on just looking at the facade, this one appears to have been in poor shape to begin with. It's not improbable that there was mold, rot, leaks, all of those issues you don't have to think about while looking at it from the outside. It's almost certain that wiring and piping would have to be replaced entirely, as well as every floor and every window (that's a very old style of window). With current regulations and energy prices, it would likely have been necessary to add exterior insulation, which would have resulted in a building that looks far worse than the replacement. All of this adds up.

All in all, this is a very unremarkable building, so there is zero incentive to preserve it. Most people won't miss it and whoever is moving into the new building will have a far better experience there than in even a completely refurbished old building. It has the same footprint, but two extra stories. Pay attention to how much larger the windows are and how there's much less space between them. This means more light, which I would personally prefer. Not to mention, tenants will have smaller heating bills, will not have to worry about room layouts that made sense in 1900, but certainly don't anymore today. The new building has a large entrance (that can be entered from two sides), which is far more accessible to both larger groups of visitors/employees (this looks like an office building, after all) and people with disabilities, whereas the only way into the old building was through a much narrower door with a step.

Old buildings can be pretty to look at, but this doesn't meant they are great to live with, this doesn't meant that they are cost-effective and competitive in today's market. I'm all in favor of preserving old architecture that is worth preserving, but let's not pretend that this building was in any way a loss to this world. It was just as unremarkable as the new building that replaces it."

Edit: By comparison, our first N64 cost 240DM with two games (Mario 64 and one game we could choose, I picked F-1 Pole Position 64, which I loved back then, but does not hold up) in the summer of '98, which was the same price as a PS1 with one game. The store employee convinced us to get the N64, because cartridges were more robust than CDs and would more easily survive small children (which is true). What's interesting about the N64 is that some games were in extremely short supply and thus hideously overpriced. I remember seeing the golden cartridge of Ocarina of Time behind glass at a store and it was on sale for 180DM two years after its release (remember, the entire console with two games was 240DM).

I would look for the most popular phones only. N-Gage was compatible with lots of Java games, but it was different enough to cause issues. Note that most games were developed for specific phone models (specifically their screen resolutions and input methods). Popular titles usually had multiple versions for different screen sizes and input methods, especially late in the history of Java games, as touch-screen Java phones enjoyed a brief surge in popularity.

A standard phone, ideally a late model and one that you can easily get a replacement battery and a working data cable for (that registers the device as a simple USB storage device, ideally, since it's no fun to use old data transfer software) would be your best bet. Oh, and make sure the exterior plastic is not coated in rubber. One of my old Siemens phones and an old Nokia are slowly disintegrating right now because of this. The melting rubber has a glue-like consistency that is extremely unpleasant to the touch. This is a very common issue with mid '90s to mid 2000s hardware.

Once you've found a phone that might make sense, do some research on how you can get programs onto it. Note that many phones from that era refuse to work properly without a SIM card. There are also examples that are locked down by the phone companies they were sold by. I had two Siemens for example that were locked down by T-Mobile (disabling the installation of programs that weren't provided by T-Mobile themselves), which required me to reverse-engineer the apps already on the device and apply this information to any game or other software I wanted to play on them.

Depending on the popularity of the phone, all you may need is a new battery, which are surprisingly easy to find (if the phone isn't too exotic). Note that it's common that phones from that era require a software from the manufacturer for data transfer.

USB is not always supported however. In addition to Bluetooth (which is usually very simple to use with old devices, but also rather slow), infrared was also commonly used. Advantage: A general purpose infrared receiver can do the job. Disadvantage: Bluetooth is downright fast by comparison and you may, once again, require specialized software, which might not be easy to find and/or hard to run on modern systems, possibly requiring some fiddling.

There are things you can do to make the noise less noticeable. Position your PC under your desk instead of on top of it, choose an all-metal case instead one of the fashionable ones with a pointless window on it. Add sound insulation to the case. 

You can also adjust the fan curve so that the fans kick on later (but this has the downside of higher temperatures, so be careful). You could clock it slightly lower so that it produces less heat, requiring less work from the fans, resulting in less noise."
architecture,ff2wgmt,t1_ff2q62e,1579526746.0,"> It is an anonymous monolithic tower built to feed corporate greed.

Then why do you, with your years of experience and knowledge, write nonsense like this? There is nothing anonymous about this building; it's incredibly well proportioned and sophisticated. Notice how your eye wonders up the building, following a path laid out by terraces that break up the clear structure of the facade. Pay attention to the simple, but elegant arcades at the bottom and the detail on the wall next to them. 

> If you took the name tag off this building, i'm sure you wouldn't have looked twice at it, let alone post this.

If this building were brand new, built right now, it would still be a nice looking office tower. Not as spectacularly new and innovative as back in 1922, of course, but still far above average even by modern standards.

My main issue with your statements is not that you have an opinion that is different from mine. You are free to not like this style of architecture and you are also free to criticize its social impact. What I - and looking by the number of downvotes you have received, many others on this subreddit as well - do not appreciate is shrouding your personal opinion in a cloak of moral and factual absolutism. Don't do that. It's the kind of arrogance that is sadly typical of many students and that *will* cause issues in your future career if you don't invest some time into a little introspection and put a stop to it now. I've fallen victim to the same kind of hubris before, so please listen to this friendly advice.

Inferior, yet much cheaper VR hardware that is easier to set up and, frankly, good enough can be bought for a tiny fraction of the price of an Index. Spending a thousand dollars or more on a VR headset (without the PC that can run it) is a big commitment, too big in most people's eyes.

badhistory,fen0i4z,t1_femzqab,1579274223.0,"This is true, but the matter is a bit more complex: Most of these companies would not have been competitive outside of the socialist economic system. Like with all socialist countries, economic figures were exaggerated to a ridiculous degree (in order to look better and to secure Western credit, which was desperately needed) and unprofitable industries were heavily subsidized. After reunification, it became evident in just how poor of a state most of the economy truly was.

There were exceptions, companies that were innovative, productive and had a great outlook. Some of them thrived, some of them were indeed sold off for a nickel and dime, some of them remained, but all of them had to change, often quite drastically.

One example is a factory for strollers in Zeitz (Zekiwa). Pretty much the entire economy of this town depended on this production facility and when it had to be outsourced in order for the firm to stay competitive (because it makes no sense whatsoever to produce these kinds of products in Germany), the town became one of the poorest and most desolate in all of Germany."
