AskReddit,fekhpux,t1_fek4ubq,1579200278.0,I think it's because they were working it as an MMO and realized they'd never ship it before running out of money so they needed a product and worked it as a single player game while putting the MMO on the back burner.

marvelstudios,feamtyx,t1_fe9w6x0,1578950397.0,Idk I like Morbius because he's be a good way to introduce the general MCU audience to vampires and then bring in Blade more organically

arrow,fe7rg1r,t1_fe69ry1,1578918347.0,"Yeah, the pacing is a little weird...I think the crossovers would benefit from being filmed as ""one"" show. Apparently, they still film as separate shows then put it together later? Maybe I've misheard that though."
