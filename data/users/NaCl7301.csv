atheism,ff9qy1t,t3_esdko8,1579719081.0,"A few things to note:

The school, ultimately, is not your friend.  It will protect itself above all and wants this to go away quietly.

You need to have a talk with your daughter and let her know that moving forward, any bullying or unwanted behavior towards her should immediately be notified to you by her.

You are her advocate.  I understand you're upset, but it's time to Mama Bear this right now.  I apologize for being so direct, but this is my advice:

Take pictures of your daughter's injuries.  Set up a meeting with the principal for tomorrow.  Be polite but firm.  Write down notes beforehand if you feel you need to.  Let them know you want to see the video, as school buses are considered public spaces.  Let them know the attacks continued at recess and more children were involved.  That you expect the school to protect her now that they are aware of this issue and you would hold the school liable if future incidents occur.

Should any moving of classes or separation be needed, it would be at the expense of the attacker, not your daughter.  And she deserves an apology, in person, from the other girl.  They will attempt to yes you to death and understate the severity of the issue.  Don't let them.  If you don't find satisfaction at the school level due to delays or lack of resolution, the secretary of the Superintendent at the District office would be your next call.

TLDR: Be firm with the school, tell them the resolution you expect in detail, and don't settle for less."

Sad that the dog's days are likely numbered.  Biters tend to get a needle.

Please, for fuck's sake, don't treat animals like toys.  If the backstory is true, she didn't know this dog well enough to be fucking around with him like that."

I have a hard time explaining what I saw transpire last night.  That Warren played a sexism card on Sanders, and seemed angry with him after the event, shows that either:

1.  someone she trusts convinced her of this
2. she's going all in without a care
3. Bernie decided to go against decades of his actions and decided to be a sexist.

The first option is sad but possible.  The third is ridiculous, but of course possible.  The second does have some history.  Warren has always been willing to work the angles for benefit, and this is desperation time.  The establishment has said Bernie won't be the nominee.  And in 2016, it made sure he wasn't, with soem help from Warren.  Liz could have assumed that if this torpedoes Sanders, it benefits her by a larger margin than Biden (31% to 26%).

This is speculation, but I have very few reasonable explanations as to why she did what she did last night."

If you have some jackass going ""He was born a he, so the tranny's gonna get called he"", yeah, I get it.  But being offended, at such an extreme level, by someone without that intent that misgenders you is a disservice to acceptance as it alienates possible allies."
