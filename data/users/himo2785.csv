Not for nothing, All Might can still fight a gruesome death fighting a villain (a villain that Nighteye did not name (because he did not know his name?)) and still have come out of the all for one fight ‘perfectly’ fine.

Not for nothing, Nighteye would have likely know. About the existence of all for one, so if all for one were the one to kill all might, why wouldn’t he have specified that there would be a rematch?

Why wouldn’t he have told everybody all for one was still VERY much alive?

But the scene where we see the snarl/smile from Chisaki’s perspective, and when seen from All for One’s perspective (I’m his flashback of All Might beating back all his allies during the Kamino fight) even All Mights smile was a snarl and he had the same shading as Deku did in his fight."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fehfgp6,t1_fdup8zi,1579115447.0,"I’m glad that this is the most upvoted comment, because it is actually an Important scene that references and parallels All Night’s symbol of peace image.

When we see Midoriya, we see him from just behind Chisaki, 3rd person, where he is preparing his final punch talking about saving a singular girl.

Then we cut to Chisaki’s point of view, where we see Deku with glowing white eyes and gritted teeth.

This is Deku from Chisaki’s perspective. He looks very similar to the All Might we see through All for One’s eyes when when talking about how all night crushed his criminal empire.

In this panel, Chisaki is actually afraid of Deku and sees him the same way that most Criminals saw All Might in his prime.

Finally, even though he’s gritting his teeth, he’s still “smiling”, albeit he’s still learning how to make it look like a smile.

All of this really culminates as Deku’s first announcement that “He is here” and that he is finally ready to pick up the mantle that was thrust on him.

One for All asking him what he wanted before giving him the power to do so, was just the icing on the cake - as a symbol of him picking up the mantle.

TwoXChromosomes,feh8cme,t1_feh6dzm,1579111248.0,"All I’m saying is that if 20 kilos of coke were “found” in the possession of these individuals, and the feds were anonymously tipped off about said cocaine, I’m pretty sure they’d lose their prestige in their society AND be incarcerated in federal prison where they can “contribute back to society”.

I imagine something similar could be said of the Scientology church, but they have modern security systems making “discovering” the cocaine much more difficult.

And all I’m really implying is that if cops who want to “stop the proliferation of drugs on the streets” might consider “becoming aware of the growing drug problem” in more rural areas, 

Ethical problems with this approach aside, it’s not really wise to turn the people who are likely to utilize their influence as “protectors of the innocent and hero’s of the drug war” as cover for their own abuses of power, but it is still *technically* an option."

Also I spent a while typing my thoughts out.



Idk, i feel like it’s not “and *only* now she can accept herself” and it’s more of showcasing and highlighting that change.

It’s not the event that caused the changes to occur, she has been there since the previous arc. However, it does finally affirm the growth she’s gone through, and her tossing away the headband was a symbolic severing of the ties that made the sisters “the same” where as Nino just wanted to not be disrespected by Yotsuba not immediately pursuing Fuutarou, Miku similarly is still upset she was not chosen. Her throwing the symbol of Yotsuba into the ocean was symbolic of her relationship with Yotsuba changing from equal sisters to different people, mirroring and completing the character arc undergone by Miku throughout the story.

Even she herself mentions that she is angry, and rightfully so.

That anger is something that changes their dynamic, and similar to Nino, Miku also severs her previous “ties” to Yotsuba; first Nino directly for having felt disrespected that Yotsuba is holding back out of consideration of her sisters, 

Now Miku, being angry at not being chosen and perhaps feeling slightly deceived by Yotsuba constantly trying to help her despite Yotsuba’s own feelings. Each sister “severing” the bond she had with Yotsuba, simultaneously serving to alter their dynamic, and to also free Yotsuba of her self imposed shackles that are tying her down.

Instead of Yotsuba coming to the aid of each sister, she is the one being helped now, albeit either unintentionally or inadvertently.

Miku letting go of the head band was not out of determination for herself, but to signify the change of dynamic between the sisters and freeing of both herself and Yotsuba from the chains of the past. The difference is the first view of the “new” Miku in full earnestness and the symbolic end of her journey and the start of her new chapter, if that makes any sense."
