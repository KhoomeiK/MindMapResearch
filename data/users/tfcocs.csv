LifeProTips,fdfc7uc,t3_el1dk1,1578358262.0,"Our wedding cost $3K total in 1989. My dress was the most expensive thing: $ 700.00; my bridesmaids were told: wear   matching dresses, ideally in purple. They found their dresses, in their sizes, for $40.00 each, with no need for alterations. The guys rented the tuxes, of course. We rented a chapel in a park, and had an afternoon reception with a DJ. The clown in our wedding album was free\*. 

PS: The clown wandered into our wedding shoot, and rather than shoo them away, we had our picture taken with them. True story."
