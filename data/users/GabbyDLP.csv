relationship_advice,fe6nfly,t3_enztmk,1578896986.0,Jfc did she watch that Christmas commercial from Jared? That is not healthy and screams stage 5 clinger. I get you panicked and you can't be faulted especially if you felt pressured. Just have a massive conversation and bring her down to earth.
relationship_advice,fe4y7h0,t3_enqdvw,1578863900.0,"Bold of you to assume she wants to sleep with you anytime soon. 

You scared yourself out of a potentially good friendship that blossoms into a relationship because you went straight to thinking about sex. 

Even if that was what she wanted immediately you can literally always say no and you want to take it slow. You've gotta stop watching TV or reading material that is all about sex. 

Give yourself a chance to figure out your feelings for her before freaking yourself out unnecessarily."
relationship_advice,fdrimyt,t1_fdrh86c,1578685098.0,I'm not arguing with a person defending a teen groomer.
relationship_advice,fdrgp30,t1_fdrfn6j,1578684261.0,The reason they're referring to is how women who are 28 years old don't fuckin deal with that manchild shit and being disrespected. That's the reason dirty asses like him go after teenagers. They think they can be controlled like a pet. It's not an insult to the girl.
bulletjournal,fdl7z6c,t1_fdl5xwm,1578518586.0,Yeah that's my goal! To see if my mood swings can predict my periods because they are so irregular
AskReddit,fdl62lt,t1_fdkzbi0,1578517665.0,SAME!! I'm gonna be 28 next week and I've had a Pikachu since I was 10 or so and now have a bulbasaur my boyfriend got me.
relationship_advice,fdj37vi,t3_ellqjz,1578457254.0,"I wish we, as a village, would stop equating defense of self and others with violence. It's not the same. You are a great husband. Respect."
relationship_advice,fdeg9ly,t3_ekuedl,1578338374.0,"I wish people would look at pet ownership as a top indicator for compatibility right up there with finances and views on Nazism. 

People that have this drastic of views simply aren't compatible. Those of us who revere pet life on the same shelf as human life should not be dating someone who doesn't support, understand, or frankly give a damn about that view."
relationship_advice,fdefnwn,t3_ekxcdw,1578337999.0,"Listen to what she says off hand and remember it later. My boyfriend offhandedly heard me say I wanted a plush of a certain pokemon before we even started dating and he got it for me for Christmas. That meant more to me than anything else. 

Do you ever hear her say things like, 'oh man I could really have a cheesecake'? or something like that? Small surprises. 

If she's a memer send her memes that you know she'd like because she'll know you're thinking about her."

And fill the page with math formulas!"
relationship_advice,fcl60j2,t3_ehs256,1577740560.0,"Great advice. Just fyi this doesn't extend to cheaters and abusers. You are not owed a damn thing if you're ghosted by a person you've used, abused, and betrayed."
