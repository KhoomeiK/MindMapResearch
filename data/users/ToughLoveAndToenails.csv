And here I was reading what others say about it and how it is possible to create a low pressure raceway. Not a full vacuum from the plans I've read but, hey, you know better than anyone how every single hyperloop will be built, and can categorically say what is and isn't possible from a technology perspective. Thank God we have your genius here on reddit sharing with us little people. I'm just so grateful.

Because a person responds negatively to an instance of criticism wouldn't lead me to characterize the person as generally being such. I mean just because you write an asshole comment doesn't mean you're an asshole to everyone all the time. But for Elon you're telling me that is the case. Okay.. got it. Or maybe you're just a complete asshole and Elon does take criticism poorly. I'll ponder that today. Thanks, asshole."

Nope. Just shows you are an insecure, wheedling chump. Why is nobody actually engaging me? All of you Musk haters here can't say shit except to repeat generalizations and misinformation. Pathetic."
OutOfTheLoop,ffaj0g3,t1_ffaioci,1579736911.0,"If you're going to say Elon is to be criticized for that sort of comment, then you need to condemn most everyone on Reddit. Otherwise you're holding him to a different standard. Or wait... no... yeah... you assholes are really just holding him to a different standard. Because compared to what he's accomplished, you and I have done basically nothing with our lives. But you know what? You can criticize him and feel better. But for me, you know, I admire that. Go ahead with your crass whining, I'm sure you'll feel better after you read a bunch of comments by other losers who agree with you."
OutOfTheLoop,ffae4rr,t1_ffacq86,1579733470.0,"Yeah, and when he said he was going to land orbital class booster stages, everyone of you critical assholes were like ""Elon, please."" Because clearly you are a bright engineer who had something to add to the technical aspect of that conversation. Now SpaceX routinely lands orbital class booster stages and all the critics have had to move on to other things to snark about.

I'm going to take a good guess and say that you haven't one damn clue what the hyperloop even is, what the progress is to date, the companies, people, and groups involved, and are just totally talking out of your ass. Prove me wrong.

The essential aspect of hyperloop was to move vehicle transportation into low pressure tunnels. That's what is being developed. To say Elon is a failure or to be criticized because the technology has evolved from the first designs is incomprehensibly stupid. Essentially, the original idea was to drive it on a rail. Later they decided to proceed with using regular vehicle drive wheels. But oh, yeah, what a horrible person Elon is because he decided to adjust the design to simplify the technology, take advantage of cheaper parts, or to make it safer.

Seriously, what a bunch of turds you guys are. Hey, I think he has good and aspects to his personality. But if you have to nitpick and mischaracterize the technology his companies produce, and to do so out of your own glaring stupidity, yeah, that's kind of ridiculous."
OutOfTheLoop,ff9y5k8,t1_ff9whhw,1579724035.0,"What's the point? Clearly one can observe that Elon Musk is a polarizing figure by the dearth of neutral comments about him or his ventures. Nobody is going to be convinced because they read a comment on Reddit. But if somebody explains something and you go through their post history and they are clearly a hater, that's a fair thing to call out. But for your edification...

- Pedo comment: Big fucking deal. You've been called worse I'm sure. Get a life. The lawsuit against him went nowhere, which means what Elon did was well within his legal right.

- Responds poorly to criticism: Not that I've seen. Not saying never but not common. Follow him on Twitter for a few weeks and you'll see that when people provide feedback that isn't super positive, he often engages. He seems to have an engineer's perspective. Valid criticism with technical merit is recognized, and the usual generalized personal criticism is ignored or responded to in kind. He responds to valid criticism of Tesla's products well from what I've seen.

- Tesla factories are dangerous: Really? Where are the statistics to prove this? These stories come from maybe one or two anecdotes, but there aren't any systemic safety issues that are well documented by objective parties. Plenty of Reddit experts will tell you how the Tesla factories are unsafe but there isn't anything particular in the media. Even what you do find reeks of short seller promoted hyperbole.

- Hyperloop: Seriously? It sounds like bonehead above is saying that because Elon didn't invent something even more amazing than what he intended, that this is some sort of failing. Inventions proceed as technology allows. Elon has done incredibly amazing things with his companies, so we're going to decide that that doesn't count because one of his cool new ideas hasn't fully matured yet? What a whiny pile of bullshit.

- Whatever that police report is about: That's a report taken by a police officer just writing down what people are telling him. If you've read more than a few police reports regarding situations you've been involved in, you'd know that they are typically full of inaccuracies. It's just notes on a page. Is there some sort of suggestion that Elon Musk personally was involved with that situation? Or are we going to criticize Elon Musk personally for every little thing that happens in his companies? Because it sure doesn't sound like he's getting credit for all the amazing things his companies have done.

Now, are you gonna reply to any of that or are you just another person who feels that their life involves doing nothing of particular interest and so shitting on somebody who is trying to do great things is the next best thing you can do?"

At sunrise they might appear directly north or south, or otherwise opposite the sun, for like two minutes, quickly sliding into and then out of view like a stream of slightly brighter dots in the sky. They will be low on the horizon. They'll appear in only a brief arc, like a couple hands across, into view here then disappearing before travelling very far across the sky. They do not stream all the way across the sky like glowing orbs. They grow dimmer quickly as they raise orbit so if you want to see them, look in the first few days after they deploy. On subsequent days they may just be too dim to see.

So no. If you are looking at the sun, sol is long gone or not yet up when the train appears. And yeah, the train will never appear between the observer and the sun.

All others are amateurs. So if you can tell me how your casual sky observations are actually impeded by starlink, I'll grant your point. Non empirical conclusions are irrelevant.

However, consider that starlink trains in the sky actually serve to increase interest in celestial observation. Why wouldn't astronomers be super enthusiastic that people might find a cool new reason to look up at the night sky? It's all about being excited looking up for them, right? This isn't a laser light show, quite the opposite. It's somewhat prominent for a brief moment. Imagine inviting your friends to see something new in the sky, and then pointing out some other cool objects after the train departs the sky two minutes later. Isn't that encouraging astronomy?"

""Large professional astronomy"" has plenty of computing power, processing power, filtering power, and unique capabilities to conduct their work despite a rare albeit noticeable visual phenomenon.

What the headlines suggest is that casual astronomy will be threatened. That is conducted wherever enthusiasts set up a telescope. Planes don't route around that circumstance.

Heck, the moon is a challenge to visual light astronomy for crying out loud. I think starlink was just something astronomers and headline writers could cite to claim some sort of relevance.

Track down the train and give it a gander. It's there and gone super quick, but it's also quite a unique celestial phenomenon. Definitely worth the effort!!"

What kind of astronomers are capturing visual light imagery when sunlight is streaming across the sky and pointing their telescope at the horizon? And then they need to capture that astronomical imagery right then, not a minute sooner nor later? Getting all wound up over that narrow case is a cry for attention, not a legitimate claim that starlink is creating a barrier to that activity. Nevertheless, SpaceX is still trying to help. But for those whining it will ruin astronomy, give it a break!"

So unless the business concerns interstate commerce (which Congress may regulate) or essential services (which are also held as sort of collateral interstate services because people cannot travel interstate without them), then they cannot be regulated by Congress.

Water is boiled or near-boiled and run over the grounds, producing coffee that is usually below 160  degrees Farenheit, a 'fairly safe' temperature spill it on oneself (i.e. no 3rd degree burns). Coffee warmers typically raise that temperature up to 180 or even 185. That is so that after it cools when the customer departs or pours it in their thermos, it is still warm (165 degrees) later.  Coffee warmers are variable and can be adjusted. At the time, the ""industry standard"" was 180 degrees Farenheit.

If you look it up now, the industry standard is 165. You sound like you are just cutting and pasting from whatever you're finding by searching on the web, which means you have never read the case, have never researched the material that gave rise to the landmark tort suit, and are just spouting whatever you can find on the web to sound smart. Most of what you can find on the web are hatchet pieces by McDonald's.

The verdict was not a product of poor representation for the defendant. The thing that defeated McDonald's is that they had known of many other similar instances of people being injured. Even after many such complaints, that franchise refused to adjust their procedures, get better cups that wouldn't disintegrate from the heat, lower the temperature of their coffee, or otherwise make their customers safe.

Tort law is very clear on this subject, that if a product can be made safer without significant cost, and the manufacturer refuses, they are liable for the harm caused. That result is very clear in the original jury award. The jury wanted to award the plaintiff a percentage of what McDonald's makes in a single day from coffee sales. That amount came out to be a huge number, but the verdict was not meant to be a high number, but rather to convey to McDonald's that they would not be allowed to place profits before the safety of their customers.

That so many people have no idea what really happened in that case, and that it became the poster child case for the need for tort reform just shows how well McDonald's marketed to make the plaintiff and her case seem the problem. Prior to suing, the plaintiff had originally asked only that her medical bills be paid. That it took such effort to make a company pay for the harm they caused is a testament to how terrible corporate entities are allowed to act in our culture, and usually with impunity.

By the way, McDonald's did far more than change the warning label. They significantly reduced the temperature at which they serve hot beverages. And guess what, so did everyone else, like gas stations and other fast food chains. So much inaccurate information about that case, it's just annoying, and most who blab about that case are just being corporate shills without knowing it.
