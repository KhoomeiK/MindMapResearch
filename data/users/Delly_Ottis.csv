Unexpected,femcio6,t1_felplp1,1579248584.0,"And it is really simple kids. 


All you have to do is learn how to have spider reflexes, run out of food, drive the car to the super market to buy some more, have the car broken down, stop and fix it, and then dodge the car that is coming at you unexpectedly.


See? Easy.


And that kids, is how I met your mother.

depression,fek4va8,t1_fek477w,1579192652.0,"As someone who has social Anxiety, you have no idea how relatable what you just said is. Also, a part of depression is numbness. So it is understandable that you can't cry. 

I think the best course of action is to talk to someone. Probably your parents, or a medical professional. It is okay to let it out! 

Good luck on your journey friend. :)"

depression,fejx2cz,t1_fejw5wc,1579187822.0,"Yeah, i think it is a mix of somewhere in the first two. I just feel like all the expectations and responsibilities are too much to handle. I also feel extremely anxious and akward talking and communicating with other people so to function like a normal person somewhat feels like teaching rocket science to a kindergarten."
depression,fejwdfo,t3_epka5w,1579187373.0,"Hey.

I am stuck in a position in which I feel hopeless as well. I can't give any advice. 

Though, I think what I can say is that people will definitely miss you when we are gone. The same way how that person who close to you were gone. You (and I believe those who are close to that person) are mentally scarred as well. For him it was cancer, which is already what he cannot control, took him away. Now imagine if you were to take your own life away. Your friends and parent will always drown in guilt, asking themselves why they couldn't help you control it and battle it with you instead of letting you suffer. They will blame themselves and it will be a pain that never go away. So believe me when I say that even though the world keeps spinning, that doesn't stop people around you from missing you. 

Furthermore, from what I have read, I know you are a kind soul who keeps a mask on to make others happy. You are really selfless, and brave. 

And, don't feel guilty that you didn't feel sad when that person who is closed to you died. You have your own problems, and especially it is depression which makes you feel like drowning. It is not that you are selfish or not a good person, it is just that Depression that blinds you and dare I say it is just as bad as cancer. You were fighting your own problems. It is okay. 

Anyways, I'm not gonna say something cliche like ""Things will get better!"". Because I don't think there is anyway to know that. But what I am sure is that if you keep holding on, someday someone will help pull you up. 

Good luck!"
