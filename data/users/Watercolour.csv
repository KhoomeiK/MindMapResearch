That makes sense if you're buying strictly in order to rent it, but I didn't know you could count future income from rent as current income, in terms of getting a loan. Because that's exactly the situation we're in, all of us pay rent that would be far more than a mortgage on the house. On the other hand the house is falling apart and has a jack in the basement holding up the front of the house, among other things, so we definitely don't want to buy it even if it were for sale. Like I said, the owner is a bit of a slumlord! Haha! I'll have to look in to this idea of buying property that is already occupied and counting that as income, that could be an interesting way to get my foot int he door on some property."

I wish there were smaller properties with smaller mortgages I could get my foot into, but in my area you need to be making at least 50k to afford the cheapest houses on the market.

I've been renting from a property manager for about 6 years and they're basically a slumlord. They've raised the rent by 50% since I moved in, more than double what a mortgage would be on the value of the property.
