projectors,fcvs6v1,t1_fcvookk,1578008903.0,"Sure. Its 491 on Amazon UK at the moment, but other ones to look is the viewsonic PX727-4K if you want spend a bit more. Note the tw650 is great, looks solid, the sound is about 7 out of 10 and it's long throw. The long distance is the key part as it depends on the situation. I've attached a pic to show you more about it.

If you want a short throw one, a good one is 1080darbee Optima or benq th671st. But both around 700.https://i.imgur.com/sROvhrn.jpg[This is one pic](https://i.imgur.com/Xr8Wmxe.jpg)

projectors,fcsagsd,t1_fcqb1bc,1577913786.0,Sure. Its brilliant as a long throw one. Bad thing is 2 things. The issue I mentioned where the keystone setting isnt saved. The remote and interface is perfect. Seriously perfect.

it's a new year, and you will meet someone :)  it might be the right TIME to start a family, however, is it the right time for you? so example, for me - i'm working through my career, i'm overweight, etc - and i went on plenty of dates! and to be honest, they didnt work out - but i think i actually think i was not ""mature"" enough to focus and pursue marriage and stuff, until i started to realign my goals and focus on myself instead of working non stop and putting my own health at risk.

so conclusion - it wasnt the right time for ""me"" i think; take your time - adn you will find someon e :)"
