pcgaming,ffdp8pj,t1_ffd9q14,1579825713.0,OMG its Nostradamus! Will Valve ever make a game after Alyx!? No wait! How many games and when will they come out and what is a synopsis on each!? Oh I messed it up already forget it...
AskReddit,ffdovug,t3_et02ca,1579825489.0,"Don't overthink it too much. Have a base game plan and when its right its right. If you are a guy take it easy on the girl at first because assuming she hasn't been sitting on every cucumber she could find, it might hurt if shes a virgin too. 

Also in my opinion, dont be so quick to get off and deal with the mess afterwards. At the very least kiss a bit because its more meaningful and makes it feel less like a transaction. In that same vein, when going down on them make it seem like you are enjoying yourself even if your mouth is tired and so forth. You may like it by default but sometimes it feels like work just don't make that obvious because they may reciprocate."

AskReddit,ff3nuwf,t3_erfp4o,1579545053.0,"Not pizza but Jimmy Johns when I was in highschool. Went to a house and a really cute girl answered the door. She had a shirt on that said she was the same year graduating class as me but at a different school. Normally I had a default script of ""hey how are you today?"" Or something like that. I just mumbled and avoided eye contact because I was caught off guard. 

1 week later I went back and immediately knew it was the same house. This time I put sunglasses on to help block the gaze of this beautiful Medusa from stunning me again. This time and I am not kidding, she was in a bikini and still has beads of water on her. I mumbled and looked at the ground and left feeling ashamed of myself. 

On an unrelated note a guy once listed an entire delivery order and before giving me his card number asked if I would be interested in meeting him at a public place and donate my semen. After that he spent like 2 minutes going on and on about how he is not a weird guy and he would give me money for it and it doesnt have to be weird. Once I said no he cancelled the order and hung up."

I also hate those guys but know that its a game and the roles could be flipped so anytime I am on the big team, instead of letting them win, i try to let them have fun in the meantime."

Went into the bathroom and sat on the toilet trying to deal with the pain. 

I followed to apologize and her head slumped into her lap and she started to fall head first into the bath tub. I caught her arm closest to me mid fall and kept her head from splitting on the tub. I got her in a hug and picked her up and laid her back on the bed and woke her up. She was out of it and obviously things were done for the night. I still feel really bad about that but I'm glad I could help at least."

todayilearned,fci5jn5,t1_fcf7sl0,1577658020.0,"Ok how about this: Japanese swords were a uniquely Japanese weapon and held immense historical and symbolic significance. It was carried (in some cases exclusively) by Samurai which are also important and unique to Japanese culture. They were the soldiers and some were expected to enforce security as they saw necessary (like diet police officers). 

And before the Americans showed up and demanded they trade with them, they enjoyed 200 years of peace under those Samurai. Then due to rapid modernization, the people who made this complex and historic weapon died off and it was almost lost. This probably lead to many swords of varying quality that people acquired and collected. Some of the famous Samurai descendants still carry their names and are likely proud of that. So having a symbol of that and knowing the quality of the weapon (also being able to date it) would be necessary.

Why didn't they have a chain over the top of the cannon and on each side of the chain have blocks to prevent it from rolling back? This would decrease the time spent rolling it to the front again and make rapid fire more available.
