cats,fd0awke,t1_fd022p0,1578116220.0,"As I said. Good story. It Didn't need to be turned into a documentary. They didn't need to use the video bits for shock value and ratings. I Didn't need to see any part of those videos. Nobody needs to see those videos.

cats,fczwozk,t1_fczuijx,1578109907.0,I did. Some of the videos though not graphic still  haunt my thoughts. Especially the terror in the eyes of the cat in the bath time video. My point being shock value in that sense is not what I think is acceptable.
