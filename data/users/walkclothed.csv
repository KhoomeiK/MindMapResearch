If I was gonna park a toon in one spot all day and right click the quickest, the very next step would be writing a simple ahk script to do it for me.

classicwow,fe4us5h,t1_fe3mph5,1578862996.0,"Depends on your activity. In a raid, that’s true. In dungeons though, a mage isn’t just dps but a wild card utility player. 

If you have the gold, you can be arcane power in raids and switch back to a frost WC build with arcane talents up to imp arcane explosion. Keep your ice block and ice shield. Time the server ticks right and you can explode on a tough pack that’s causing trouble, take a few hits with ice shield, ice block when your health is down, blink and bandage and come back for more. Mages are great “oh shit” recovery players and shouldn’t be afraid to get their hands dirty as long as they know when to safely go HAM, and to make sure your healer knows what you’re gonna do sometimes. 

Dungeons are amazing as a mage."
classicwow,fe4s8jm,t3_enplrw,1578862311.0,"Weird this just came up, because I was working on this with my mage last night. I got a bunch of high spirit/mp5 gear off the AH and made a macro that will switch my sp gear to the regen gear every time I sit down to drink. I figured out a way to make it switch back automatically 12 seconds later or when I stand back up. 

I haven’t tested the regen rates with a Stopwatch yet, but I will when I logon later."
