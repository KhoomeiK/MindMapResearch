A Hat in Time. It's such a great game, kind of like super Mario Odyssey, but in my opinion, better. All the little details and the amount of personality they were able to give to Hat Kid, even when she doesn't talk is so charming. It mainly doesnt have that many players because it was released a week before odyssey came out, so the timing kind of messed it up, but it's still an amazing game that I still play to this day :D"
