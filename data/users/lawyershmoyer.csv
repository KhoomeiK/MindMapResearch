She even bathes him. And its only been a couple weeks. I think it also depends on the nature of your cat. Both of ours love to cuddle and are very sweet, so after some adjustment she accepted him. We did have to do the separate rooms thing for a couple days, then only at nights for a week, and now they both roam around.

We also introduced our first cat to my parents' 4 year old cat when she was still a kitten. That took a little longer for him to accept her, but over time they learned to cohabitate and even occasionally play :)"
cats,fegutn9,t1_fegnaf8,1579103028.0,Not sure. We adopted him from a local shelter
cats,fegjd7h,t1_fegi4ap,1579094561.0,Definitely. We took it off of our older cat but he's so little and loves to hide that we are just doing it to keep track until he's bigger :)

cats,feggfuk,t1_fegfyt1,1579091928.0,We actually paid a little more and got a performance canvas. It was so worth it! So far nothing has been able to ruin it. The couch in my office however is another story ....
