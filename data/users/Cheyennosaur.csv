BlackPeopleTwitter,ff6unag,t1_ff6987n,1579635228.0,"I think they’re agreeing with you, but pointing out the double-standard that currently exists in legislation due to underrepresentation of minorities in government & corrupt funding of biased laws, and the double-standard in the public mentality that is fostered by implicitly learned racism. 

Hypothetically, if a wealthy foundation (like the Gates Foundation) did try to implement a program for providing access to firearm training and things like that for underprivileged and minority groups, it could be a really great thing for those groups, as you said. But as the person above you is pointing out, it also would probably not last very long before it is misconstrued and portrayed as some kind of “domestic threat” that would result in stricter laws that prevent that kind of empowerment. The point is that “the right to bear arms” has become embattled in systemic racial inequality, and not “by accident”; it becomes exponentially more difficult to oppress the underprivileged once they start getting the tools/resources and education to defend themselves and dismantle the systems which oppress them - hence why the systems will never willing yield these resources & knowledge to those outside of power."

worldnews,ff6ogrf,t1_ff62d5s,1579631545.0,"Right, obviously. My point though was that, on top of obviously getting caught and prosecuted for assassination of the US President, it would also be futile to begin with because his assassination would only serve to empower and embolden his current supporters, who already compare him to sacrificial religious leaders like Jesus Christ. So not only would the shooter almost certainly be caught and tried (if subdued) or killed (if subduing is not a safe option), it could also make the problem of “Trump’s America” even worse despite him no longer being alive.

Instead of recognizing him as the bigoted, self-serving con-artist that he is, his supporters would continue to view him as a paragon of “free speech” (when what they really mean is “freedom from consequences”, which isn’t a real thing, by the way). His death would only continue to fuel the rise of nationalism and discrimination against Muslims and people of middle-eastern heritage, thereby perpetuating the toxic and divisive mentalities he had fostered in life."

RandomActsofMakeup,fdl1pyt,t3_eltyc2,1578515528.0,"I’m sooooo jealous of how smooth & even your complexion is! Your foundation & highlighter look great, and you did a great job blending the eyeshadow!

I agree with what the other user said about the eyeliner; making the line a bit thinner towards the inside of the eye (near the nose) and then flare out will really help accentuate your eye shape. 

Sometimes what I do with liquid eyeliner is start closer to the middle of my eye and go outward for the first few brush strokes, which ensures that the most product goes down where you want the line thickest. Then before I re-dip the brush, I swipe on the part from the inside to the middle of my eye - this keeps you from having a big product build-up right before you do the thin lining. 

Overall you look great!! The colors match & suit you well, and you could wear this look anywhere!"

intermittentfasting,fc95vkf,t3_egp1ob,1577547526.0,"My mom does IF, and she said one thing to avoid is not to “binge eat” once you reach your food window. You’ll be hungry at first, but you should try to eat a normal amount of food and eat kinda slowly because your stomach shrinks during the fasting period. Basically, resist the urge to eat a whole bunch of food as soon as you can eat. She said once you get into a good habit, the pattern feels more natural.

The first part with the isolated V is most likely either an ‘a’ or an ‘I’ as those are the only two letters that can be single-letter-words.

Edited to add: however, the Vigenère cipher doesn’t really match up with the “this person solved it in 2013” clue."

atheism,fc6pifl,t1_fc6p598,1577486216.0,"I’m not denying the validity of the ability to “influence” what someone remembers - it’s been proven over and over again that it is possible to mislead someone into “remembering” something that never happened — but denying that repressed memories are a psychological coping mechanism for extreme trauma is also not true — I minored in Psychology and have experienced remembering repressed memories myself due to severe childhood trauma — I understand that it’s controversial because there DO exist specific case-studies in which “repressed memories” were shown to be “implanted false memories” but the existence of SOME fake cases is not sufficient to entirely disprove EVERY case.

Freud is not by any means the only psychologist who has done research on this and I encourage you to educate yourself with more modern psychological schools of thought before proclaiming something as “a lie” because modern schools of thought do NOT rely on Freud for this. Modern psychologists give Freud about as much credibility as any random schmuck in the street."

wholesomememes,fc6gylw,t1_fc6f23x,1577480338.0,"The one with the angry dog I could kinda get because it’s frustrating when someone you care about doesn’t see the value and good in themselves, because you know they’re better than they give themselves credit for. And while I see contextually what you’re saying about the “intensity of emotion”, at the same time, being given a 5-out-of-5-star review isn’t anything like being slapped in the face.

Being slapped in the face is humiliating, degrading, and literally physically painful, while being given a good review is relieving, reassuring, and evokes a feeling of mutual gratitude.

From the standpoint of humorous absurdity, sure, I kinda get the point. But, (apologies in advance for being a “downer”) physical violence isn’t wholesome to me, no matter what the text says. And yeah yeah I know if it’s this “Russian slap competition” then both people are presumably there of their own free-will — but that doesn’t make it wholesome. This just reminds me of being bullied and physically abused - and it’s not what I joined this subreddit to see. I want to see wholesome stuff that makes people feel good, not see people having their physical pain be re-branded as a “joke”.

I know that not everyone shares the same experiences, but, I just really don’t see anything wholesome about this. Sorry. :/"

PTSD and especially Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) can have effects on the traumatized person that cause them to act in ways that are “counter-intuitive” to what non-traumatized people think they would do. Whether they repress they trauma or try to fetishize their trauma as a way of “normalizing” it to convince themselves it wasn’t “that bad”, or engage in risky sexual behavior, or any number of other things - they do things that might seem “illogical” because of their trauma. It’s a combination of their brain not being able to fully handle the trauma and their brain being stuck in an emotionally under-developed state due to their early exposure to such a mind-bending trauma.

(I have been diagnosed with PTSD and I suspect it may actually be C-PTSD though I’ve not officially been diagnosed with C-PTSD at this time. I can confirm that sometimes I do/feel things that even I don’t understand as a result.)"
