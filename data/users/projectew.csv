iamatotalpieceofshit,fg8k6q7,t1_fg8ffn9,1580622093.0,"I specifically said they would mistakenly block puberty and then reverse it. You need to pay more attention to my meanings.

Blocking puberty for years thinking you're trans is physically reversible, sure, but it's pretty foolish to think that doing something like that to yourself for months or years when you didn't really need it won't be highly traumatic, just like a trans kid being forced to go through puberty. In fact, they amount to the very same thing: a boy who feels like a girl is traumatized by going through male puberty, and a non-trans boy who prevents his puberty for however long because he thinks it's the right thing for him will have a truly fucked up gender identity after all's said and done. They'll have turned their adolescent angst and identity confusion into a full blown gender-identity psychological complex.

Ironically enough, they might end up forcing themselves to accept the idea that they're trans when they're really not, and go through life really fucked up, all because the adults in charge thought that kids should have that power.

You keep talking about the trauma that trans people go through as if they have a monopoly on the idea. Permanent damage doesn't have to be physical; it's certainly doable enough under bad circumstances for a non-trans person to wind up doing permanent psychological damage in that fashion."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fg85t3h,t1_fg71xcp,1580610292.0,"I confess, I have no idea at all what you mean by those who detransition ""are in a bad spot"". Do you mean they can't afford hormones/etc? Why exactly do you think you know this? You're making a pretty sweeping assumption, essentially saying that almost no one mistakenly transitions permanently.

That sounds like it's probably true, since they can change their mind at any point, except that you also apply it to kids.

You know what's also extremely traumatizing to any developing person? Being a confused and hurt pre/teen who thinks transitioning is the answer because of its huge media presence recently, and is allowed to stop their fucking puberty on a whim. That's a permanent and very life-altering decision, not to mention all the shit people give to trans people in the first place, but someone who trans in adolescence only to reverse it later?

That kind of thing would fuck someone up more than even growing up in those insane beauty pageant competitions. And let's be honest: the number of people who are actually trans is an incredibly small number. If the goal is to reduce psychological pain on the whole, rather than favoring trans people at the expense of non-trans, then you wouldn't let minors take any real measures.

I don't doubt there are plenty of minors who would benefit from transitioning, especially preventing puberty, but I think the number of kids who will mistakenly choose that life for less than the right reasons vastly outstrips that number.

We don't even trust kids to simply drive a car till they're 16 or legally start a smoking addiction nor participate in choosing the government till 18. But you think it would behoove society at large to let them choose whether to go through puberty or not, when they are at their most hormonal and immature points in life and where feeling like they fit in/accept who they are is an extreme luxury?

I think that's very irresponsible, since we should be aiming not to help every trans person at any young age, but instead looking out for the wellbeing of as many kids as possible. I'm truly sorry if that means some trans kids slip through the cracks, but how many mistakenly-cancelled puberties, complete with the associated psychological damage of that, would you trade to prevent those trans in the extreme minority from being made to wait until they're capable of at least half-assed rational thought?

15 year-old kids are running on like 10% of an immature version of reason and 90% emotion, primarily through social validation. I don't think we should give that group the power to absolutely derail their life in confused desperation."
kratom,fg6wlx3,t1_fg6t99o,1580578572.0,"I wasn't endorsing any of those examples of future tech as good or bad, just using them to show that future tech will basically be magical, and probably sooner rather than later.

In a world with that kind of technological development, creating superior synthetic alternatives to a plant like cannabis would be a pretty trivial achievement in comparison.

Nature has nothing to offer us, as compared to synthetics, other than the traits that enabled some plants to evolutionarily thrive in their environments and outcompete their rivals. Additionally, those successful plants, like cannabis and kratom, that have appealing properties to us humans were usually selectively bred to emphasize those properties and deemphasize those properties we didn't like.

All of that is to say, it's almost random that we ended up with mitragynine or THC-A in the first place, and we jumped on those opportunities to engage in the precursor activity to artificial synthesis of drugs: we intentionally designed the plants to produce the chemicals we wanted and suppress those we don't through artificial selection. The next step, as far as creating/improving drugs for our own uses, would be to work on those natural compounds in a lab and actively learn from and improve them. There already exists pharmaceutical extractions of cannabis intended to improve their natural formulas to suit specific purposes, and, though the whole DEA/FDA's move to ban/regulate kratom is foremost to protect their pain management business, they're also very interested in creating similar extractions/synthesized formulas of kratom alkaloids. I could certainly foresee a future in which kratom was successfully banned followed by pharma companies coming out with a miracle cure for opioid dependency based on (hydroxy-) mitragynine(s).

All of these lead to one inevitable outcome: we learn to create purpose-designed molecules to improve on these natural compounds. Once that happens, again, it will be completely straightforward to design a version of cannabis ingredients with reduced/eliminated side effects and multiple versions to treat different ailments better than any natural cannabis molecule ever could. Of course, there will also be valiant efforts to do the same with the intention of creating a better recreational drug. And just like a true virtual reality, we humans, armed with the power to design the perfect high for all preferences, massive abuse will ensue.

That's not a reason for it not to happen, though; on the contrary, we've as a species been similarly motivated to create every innovation we've ever had: making life easier/more enjoyable."

Not to mention the fallout if she discovers that you've been hiding the fact that you didn't technically earn your nice job on merit. That realization will certainly make her look sideways at you and reexamine your character, at least. A worse possibility is that she immediately decides that you're a self-conscious douchebag who pretended to earn the gig he has and ends it just like that.

Also, you might try just telling the truth to connect with a girl sometimes, generally, rather than playing fucking delusional games. You will, without doubt, end up much happier with the result, if you manage to connect with her, as opposed to, more or less, tricking her into bed by being someone you aren't and inevitably have to lie your way out of the situation since you can't really tell her: I was just playing a role to fuck you because I like to think of myself as a hunter, and of you as a stupid fucking animal just waiting for me pounce."

But you think that cannabis was so perfectly formed by random mutations that the society that created all of that stuff and so much more is completely incapable of designing a drug superior to cannabis in every way?

Keep in mind, I'm only discussing the positives of weed, but there are many negatives to it as well, sometimes very severe. It can induce schizophrenia in those already predisposed, it gives many, many people anxiety/panic attacks, including myself at times, etc.

It's really not some perfect magical plant, it's just a pretty nice drug, and it will eventually be supplanted by universally superior drugs created in a lab."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fg6o5cy,t1_fg6ict7,1580572971.0,"Okay, I did misinterpret your comment, my apologies. Either way, you're still hand-waving away those who detransition as ""untrue Scotsman"", rather than trans people who weren't able to fix their situation by transitioning. The suicide stats are completely beside the point I was making then and now: gender dysphoria, like every mental illness, is incredibly variable and even if transitioning in whole or part is very helpful for most, the nature of the problem is the brain fucking up a bit and regarding its body as foreign for unknowable reasons. Therefore, just like antidepressants work for many depressed people, hormones/transitioning/surgery/the whole nine yards is sometimes not enough to convince the mistaken brain that the situation has been righted.

Regarding those who detransition as usually mistaken about being trans seems pretty risky, as the inevitable fraction of those genuine trans individuals who took the leap and still didn't find relief would almost certainly be high-risk for suicide after a world-upheaval like accepting your trans nature only to simply be unable to fix it, period.

Edit: since we're on the subject of mistaken transition, I'm curious: what's your opinion on diagnosing minors, of any age from early adolescence to 18, and subsequently taking permanently life-alerting courses like hormone therapy to prevent puberty, or even surgery in extreme cases?

I think we can both agree that people make mistakes, even about something as serious as being trans (especially given its existence as a phenomenon in the media), and that kids of any age are particularly well-suited both to making mistakes generally, and being rather susceptible to media influences when trying to form their identities and ascribe reasons to what is frequently a very painful part of existence.

I tend to think that minors simply aren't capable enough on average, and preventing those permanent mistakes is probably worth the likely minute fraction of minors who are, in fact, trans, and simply can't wait until turning 18 without taking drastic action."
asktrp,fg6lzoz,t1_ffyktt6,1580571453.0,"Actually, since women are humans with minds, I'm sure many, if not most of them, would at least be interested in that fact. It's a good conversation starter about feeling self-conscious about how you got there and might lead to a real conversation with a female person where you connect emotionally on such subjects as father's expectations, feeling a bit guilty over the possibility of nepotism, etc.

Or, you know, consider her by default to be a gold-digging slut only interested in how powerful you are and your cock. Your call, I guess..

And it sounds like you really respect women to fill your sick mind's role for them as simple-minded fuck machines who exist primarily to service 'poon-hunters', such as yourself.

I'm absolutely sure that, just as there are entire communities like this dedicating to training men who are nervous about interacting with women to turn that anxious energy into a well-crafted, narcissistic, misogynistic delusion of grandeur, there are certainly plenty of women who do, in fact, have self-esteem as low as yours and have similar views of sex and aversions to honesty and empathy, such as yourself.

Feel free to discuss strategies to bed those poor women if you can ignore the fact that you're exploiting people who value themselves about as much as you value them. Consenting adults and what not.. but classifying the entire female gender as a herd of sex robots who give it up after they've been won over by successful deceit and playing pretend is.. horrifically disgusting, dude. Like, you at least need some intensive therapy to figure out the daddy issues you must have that left you thinking this is what it means to be a man, though I also wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if researchers did a study on communities like this and found that they were much more likely to be demeaning towards all women, more likely to be utterly repressing their emotions and defining their worth as humans by bullshit like number of girls fuckedb or salary earned, and possibly even a propensity to beat/rape women more than the average due to the instilled belief that we as men are all owed sex and sometimes the stupid cows just totally disrespect your game and don't want to fuck you, despite the fact that you totally earned it with your moves and well-cultivated identity."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fg5eza3,t1_fg58bsu,1580525684.0,"Science agrees that living as the gender that they feel compelled to is the best solution to their problem. It is, however, a psychological problem; we simply don't have any way to treat the underlying gender dysphoria, much like how we don't really have any actual treatments for most mental illnesses. We treat depression with a bullshit chemical that increases serotonin, and we treat psychotic illnesses by deafening an entire dopaminergic pathway; these are all unwieldy and simpleminded approaches, at best, to treat very nuanced conditions.

In much the same way, we lack the ability to help trans people stop feeling like their body/mind/gender is at odds with their physical reality. Therefore, the best course the medical community has decided on is to treat their dysphoria by giving it what it wants. Since this relieves their pain in most cases, it's deemed an unfortunate, but necessary, tradeoff.

That's the context in which science agrees with trans people: they have a severe mental affliction that, unlike most other delusion-esque illnesses, responds quite well to the oft-disappointing strategy of treating the symptoms in isolation from their cause.

Despite this, it doesn't mean that their dysphoric feelings indicate some deep yet completely symbolic truth about their ""true"" gender. It just means we found a way to help them, and that's by collectively agreeing to define them by how they feel, regardless of the neurological basis of those feelings, rather than what is objectively true, as we define most everyone else."

There is a difference between talking out of your ass and making an intuitive guess based on our knowledge of genetics and the physical/psychological/neurological differences between men and women. Disagree if you want, but disagree with my logic, not the undeniable truth that men and women are different because of their genes.

AskReddit,fg1v913,t1_fg1kwdz,1580433713.0,"You're right, the stick thing is specifically anecdotal.

Men are more physically imposing, more inclined to engage in physical confrontation, etc, because that's the role they've been sculpted to fill by eons of evolution.

Women, similarly, have been sculpted to be more caring, less physically imposing or likey to engage in physical confrontations because they've evolved to bear and care for offspring directly, rather than provide services for their benefit as men have been (hunting, protection, etc).

Obviously, genetic roles are only statistical forces that have shaped the genders at large. There are countless examples on both sides to contradict the general rule, but they don't invalidate it or contradict the much larger numbers of people that do conform to these evolutionary roles.

If your issue is only with stretching men's genetic role to possibly account for ""stick-finding"", then you're correct: these Reddit posts, including mine, aren't scientific theories with journal citations backing them up. Everything here is conjecture backed only by common sense, but connecting the instinct to ""arm"" oneself with sticks when in nature to the forces that have made the male gender into to what it is seems pretty damn straightforward.

You can argue with the connection I've claimed with your own claims and assertions, but holding my post, or others, to a stringent scientific standard makes any discussion on the topic impossible.
