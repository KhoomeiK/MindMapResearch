cats,ffn4ne8,t1_fdjbw64,1580062044.0,"He passed away this morning. 

The final cause was kidney failure. It’s so quiet around the house without him. Even though I know he’s gone, I still look up whenever I hear any noise in the flat. I’ve never lost a pet before, and he was with me more than half of my entire life. 

It’s hard."
AskMen,fdjxtd9,t1_fdjvdua,1578490880.0,"I think he meant that testicles are two separate round organs not fused together. Scrotum is a single “bag” of skin and muscle on the outside, that simply has two chambers for each testicle inside. The “proof” of scrotum being one thing and fused from two parts is the slightly raised ridge of skin that runs in the middle of it, it’s called perineal raphe."
cats,fcuvf3o,t1_fcure3i,1577989340.0,"Thanks! I’ve just gone out to get him some. I’ve always thought that adult cats don’t digest lactose so they shouldn’t be given milk products, but thanks to your comment I’ve looked it up online and apparently plain yoghurt and kefir are good source of probiotics for them just like for us. Thanks again :)"
cats,fcujsy9,t3_eil0c1,1577982617.0,"Update - Thursday (02/01):

The lymphocyte level was still high but lower than on Monday (50 vs 39), so he’s responding to the antibiotic treatment, but that again caused his creatinine levels to rise. So the vet decided to keep him on iv fluids and two more antibiotic shots till Saturday.  He didn’t order any leukemia specific tests, because he said it wouldn’t change the treatment and it would jest mean additional cost for us. He will consider it if my cat gets worse till Saturday or doesn’t start drinking/eating enough on his own (this is apparently the crucial thing, as he can’t be syringe-fed by us all the time, same with getting fluids through the iv route). 

Overall he’s improved since Monday, because he’s finally starting to eat something on his own. His fur looks better which means he started to clean himself again. We’re still giving him chicken soup mixed with cat nutrient drink in a plastic syringe to prevent liver lipidosis.  

Also he bit the vet today during examination, which the vet said was a huge progress, since on Monday he felt like a lifeless sack of potatoes that didn’t oppose to anything that was done to him. 

So. Fingers crossed the lymphocyte level will go down again till Saturday. And that his kidneys improve, because he won’t be able to get antibiotics the next time he gets ill. 

Thank you so much for all your comments, I made sure to give him enough pets on behalf of all of you!!"

cats,fctdhbs,t1_fcsx43n,1577939808.0,"15 years and a couple of months, all I know he was born in 2004."
cats,fctcooc,t1_fct837a,1577939127.0,"The virus (Feline Leukemia Virus) is contagious in cats. It causes mutation in the blood cell that ends up looking like human leukemia - which is white blood cells multiplying like crazy and “suffocating” the other kinds of cells (red blood cells, the production of platelets). In humans the mutation isn’t usually caused by virus, it happens on its own or some people are genetically more prone to it (if they have the Philadelphia chromosome for example). 

The tricky part when it comes to cats is that they can get infected on a very young age and if it not tested earlier, they symptoms will show in the adulthood when the cat’s immunity weakens. And since my cat is an indoors only and in perfect health through all those years, no vet has suggested we do that test before, so."
cats,fctbzfj,t1_fct91df,1577938538.0,"Same with him. He stopped eating altogether and just drank insane amounts of water. He looks better now than he did on Monday, vet told us exactly the same thing - that he didn’t look like he was gonna make it, but it’s been a couple of days and he started eating on his own and finally got out from under the bed, where he was hiding before. So, fingers crossed. Apparently the good wishes given by people here  alongside the treatment are working :) I’m really hopeful about the vet visit today. 

Thank you for your comment!"
cats,fctbpji,t1_fct6cf8,1577938303.0,"Yeah, you’re right! If air gets through it might cause air blockade in the vessel. Luckily I checked it multiple times (I’m a MED student so it was a kinda routine procedure, mostly because the vet was closed during the New Years but they didn’t want to wait with the treatment and I’m on the same uni as the vet’s daughter), and I think that on the photo it’s just some weird reflection. 

So far so good, he didn’t have pulmonary blockade despite having 6 drips so far :) but thank you for your concern!"
cats,fcsbstz,t1_fcs6v0z,1577914338.0,"Thank you so much!! He really is very kind and sociable. He always comes when we call him and he never spends more than an hour alone - he always has to sit where he has a good look at the rest of the family. He used to purr at the slightest touch too, not so much anymore since he has lost a lot of weight and I guess he’s just really weak. 

Here are some more photos of him when he was younger: https://imgur.com/gallery/MRFYU :)"
cats,fcrscah,t1_fcrqo0t,1577905969.0,"I didn’t know about the vaccine, but the vet told us about it on Monday. My cat wasn’t vaccinated against leukemia, because when we got him 15 years ago it wasn’t apparently a thing where I live. 

He spends the majority of his time indoors (we live in a block of flats) and only goes out onto the balcony. The only two cats he’s ever interacted with are pretty young and from a breeder, so they are healthy and vaccinated. 

The vet said that if it turned out to be leukemia, he might’ve already been infected in his youth or even by his mother, since he’s a shelter kitty and not much was known about his past. 

Thank you for your comment though, I appreciate it."
