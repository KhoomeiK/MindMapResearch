Edit: watched the scene again as it was linked below.  I do not believe they could have possibly done that scene using a body double, since it is a long close up take with her face.  I think the director is referencing other scenes from earlier in the film"

Dragula,ffffnrt,t1_fferj8h,1579882932.0,"Your argument is comparing apples and oranges. I will break it down for you. Here is the timeline:

Late 80s - Early 1990s: Rupaul becomes a club personality. Then becomes mainstream with his music, and talk show in the 1990s. Through this period he has done it all. Hosted club events, created events etc

Early 2000s: the Boulet Brothers host club events including Dragula, which is not anything like the now TV show. It runs vaguely similar to a drag pageant, which has existed since drag begun

2009: Rupaul creates drag race

2017: Boulet Brothers create Dragula

Just because the Boulet Brothers had an event with the same name before means absolutely nothing. Pageants of different sorts, or nightly drag competitions have always existed. While it doesn't diminish what the Boulets have achieved (and I personally do prefer Dragula), it is absolutely untrue to pretend they did anything before Rupaul did"
Dragula,ffef4ud,t1_ffdhkwp,1579845651.0,"And Rupaul existed and threw/hosted many events before Dragula?  Having a drag themed nightclub event is not even remotely comparable.  We're talking about drag competitive reality shows, in which rpdr obviously came first."

The concept that people could be gay was never discussed growing up, which made him take much longer to even recognize he's gay.  I can't imagine how lonely it would be if he stayed there.
