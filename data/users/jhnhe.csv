grandorder,fdle785,t3_elrzhl,1578522118.0,"Hmm... Let's see... 

The other Gym leaders: 

Poison Gym would be Shuten Douji.

Anastasia would lead an Ice Gym.

Jalter runs a Dark Gym. She's rough on the outside, but people still love her, because she really isn't all that bad.

Li Shu Wen runs a shady Fighting Gym. Nobody knows how he sees with his sunglasses in his dimly lit Gym.

Tesla and Edison run the Electric Gym. They can never agree who's better though, so you end up battling both in a double battle.

Medb runs a fairy Gym. All her Pokémon have Cute Charm and use Attract. Sometimes gets disqualifies for trying to charm her opponent...

Metal Eli runs a Steel Gym. Some people rumor she isn't even human, but that's impossible, right? Androids can't be real...

Elite Four:

Siegfried runs a Dragon Team. Helps wherever he can, but is always really really serious. Has an adoptive son named Sieg.

Jeanne runs a defense oriented team. She's the gentle older sister of Jalter. Jalter will always get embarrassed when she shows her affection.

Gilgamesh runs a mixed team. His Pokémon are all super strong, but he is too arrogant to acknowledge the existence of type resistances and weaknesses. According to him, all Pokémon should be weak to his.

King Hassan runs a Ghost team. Nobody knows his face. Nobody really understands what he is talking about. Something about bells and heads. He does also run a strict trainer school. Only 3 actually attend his school though(Serenity, Cursed Arm and Hundred Personas). Most prefer Chiron's school.

Champion: 

Artoria holds the spot of Champion with her trusty Zacien. She is a fierce trainer, and a bit of a tomboy. She is so popular, she is practically the face of the Pokémon League. Few people know her husband, but apparently he is little known but incredibly powerful trainer, fighting Pokémon crime syndicates as special operative.

Professors:

Da Vinci and Romani are the two(married?) professors of the Region. Da Vinci is usually regarded as the more capable of the two, but who would have guessed that Romani is actually a former champion?

Rivals: 

Dantes: A mysterious dark type trainer who always appears when you most need him and the plots starts to thicken.

Olga Marie: A girl trying to live up to her family name. The pressure sometimes gets to her, but she is a nice person deep down.

Main Legendary: 

Zamazenta the ""Shielder"" Pokémon.

The bad guys: 

Lev Lainur and Team Incineration. Obsessed with destroying all of humanity and weirdly tentacles. In the end it turns out he isn't even the real leader, but Goethia, Romani's evil brother."
grandorder,fdl7okq,t1_fdkx2s3,1578518451.0,"Romani and Da Vinci can both be professors :)

grandorder,fdir5j0,t1_fdiq28e,1578449192.0,"I am still somewhat new to Fate lore and have a pretty superficial knowledge of some things... Anyways my mind just went off on a tangent as it often does and several questions popped up:
If Homonculi can be designed to have large mana reservoirs and high quality circuits, how isn't some of that knowledge applicable to humans? It seems that the only way for humans to reliably produce high quality magic circuits is through selective breeding.
Also, does Illya have improved Mana reserved and Magic circuits? Since she is the natural-born child of Kiri and Irisviel, I suppose the question is really whether Irisviel had them and if they are given to the next generation. 
Lastly: the glowy lines on Illya's skin, are those her Magic circuits or the Einzbern crest?"

Anyway, I wanted to ask about my team composition. I think I got pretty lucky, I have just arrived at the point where I return to Baruoki and my units so far are: Aldo(obviously), Shion AS(5 star), Rosetta(5 star), Tsukiha(5 star), Ewan(4 star), Ciel(4 star) and Miu(4 star, not in party). Just now I also got Claude from the Gacha and wanted to ask whether it'd make sense to put him in Ciel's slot?

I feel like with Aldo, Rosetta, Shion, Tsukiha and Ewan I have a very potent Fire team already. Ciel mainly gives Power debuffs and a 30% Elemental resist, but Rosetta has a 30% resist as well, coupled with a Fire damage buff. Claude has a 5% lower power debuff but also debuffs Intelligence.

From western literature probably Jean Valjean."

The other Gym leaders: 

Poison Gym would be Shuten Douji.

Anastasia would lead an Ice Gym.

Jalter runs a Dark Gym. She's rough on the outside, but people still love her, because she really isn't all that bad.

Li Shu Wen runs a shady Fighting Gym. Nobody knows how he sees with his sunglasses in his dimly lit Gym.

Tesla and Edison run the Electric Gym. They can never agree who's better though, so you end up battling both in a double battle.

Medb runs a fairy Gym. All her PokÃ©mon have Cute Charm and use Attract. Sometimes gets disqualifies for trying to charm her opponent...

Metal Eli runs a Steel Gym. Some people rumor she isn't even human, but that's impossible, right? Androids can't be real...

Elite Four:

Siegfried runs a Dragon Team. Helps wherever he can, but is always really really serious. Has an adoptive son named Sieg.

Jeanne runs a defense oriented team. She's the gentle older sister of Jalter. Jalter will always get embarrassed when she shows her affection.

Gilgamesh runs a mixed team. His PokÃ©mon are all super strong, but he is too arrogant to acknowledge the existence of type resistances and weaknesses. According to him, all PokÃ©mon should be weak to his.

King Hassan runs a Ghost team. Nobody knows his face. Nobody really understands what he is talking about. Something about bells and heads. He does also run a strict trainer school. Only 3 actually attend his school though(Serenity, Cursed Arm and Hundred Personas). Most prefer Chiron's school.

Champion: 

Artoria holds the spot of Champion with her trusty Zacien. She is a fierce trainer, and a bit of a tomboy. She is so popular, she is practically the face of the PokÃ©mon League. Few people know her husband, but apparently he is little known but incredibly powerful trainer, fighting PokÃ©mon crime syndicates as special operative.

Professors:

Da Vinci and Romani are the two(married?) professors of the Region. Da Vinci is usually regarded as the more capable of the two, but who would have guessed that Romani is actually a former champion?

Rivals: 

Dantes: A mysterious dark type trainer who always appears when you most need him and the plots starts to thicken.

Olga Marie: A girl trying to live up to her family name. The pressure sometimes gets to her, but she is a nice person deep down.

Main Legendary: 

Zamazenta the ""Shielder"" PokÃ©mon.

The bad guys: 

Lev Lainur and Team Incineration. Obsessed with destroying all of humanity and weirdly tentacles. In the end it turns out he isn't even the real leader, but Goethia, Romani's evil brother."
grandorder,fdl7okq,t1_fdkx2s3,1578518451.0,"Romani and Da Vinci can both be professors :)

And at the end of the game it's revealed Romani was a former Champion all along!

grandorder,fdir5j0,t1_fdiq28e,1578449192.0,"I am still somewhat new to Fate lore and have a pretty superficial knowledge of some things... Anyways my mind just went off on a tangent as it often does and several questions popped up:
If Homonculi can be designed to have large mana reservoirs and high quality circuits, how isn't some of that knowledge applicable to humans? It seems that the only way for humans to reliably produce high quality magic circuits is through selective breeding.
Also, does Illya have improved Mana reserved and Magic circuits? Since she is the natural-born child of Kiri and Irisviel, I suppose the question is really whether Irisviel had them and if they are given to the next generation. 
Lastly: the glowy lines on Illya's skin, are those her Magic circuits or the Einzbern crest?"

Anyway, I wanted to ask about my team composition. I think I got pretty lucky, I have just arrived at the point where I return to Baruoki and my units so far are: Aldo(obviously), Shion AS(5 star), Rosetta(5 star), Tsukiha(5 star), Ewan(4 star), Ciel(4 star) and Miu(4 star, not in party). Just now I also got Claude from the Gacha and wanted to ask whether it'd make sense to put him in Ciel's slot?

I feel like with Aldo, Rosetta, Shion, Tsukiha and Ewan I have a very potent Fire team already. Ciel mainly gives Power debuffs and a 30% Elemental resist, but Rosetta has a 30% resist as well, coupled with a Fire damage buff. Claude has a 5% lower power debuff but also debuffs Intelligence. What do you think?"
