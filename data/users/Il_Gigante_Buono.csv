soccer,fet9j5f,t1_fet6p70,1579372989.0,During the 80’s intelligence services and the bbc cooperated on blacklisting left wing journalists as well.
soccer,fet5dq8,t1_fet559n,1579371966.0,A lot of people voted for them unfortunately.

soccer,fet4m1t,t1_fet3yy7,1579371778.0,"They probably googled left wing football clubs and thought good we can put these on so out extremist list doesn’t look so right wing. 

What this does mean is a lot more lefties buying St Pauli kit haha"
soccer,fet43na,t1_fet3ivf,1579371647.0,They branded the fans and their symbols extremist of course they did. Unless you can point to all the non fans wearing their badge haha
soccer,fet3wn8,t3_eqjteh,1579371586.0,What this list has really proven is the level of difference between right and left wing extremists. The left wing list is genuinely pathetic grasping by the government.
soccer,fet3ess,t1_fet2fj1,1579371429.0,I worded it badly sorry. But that’s due to the fans and fan culture. Where are these legions of non fans wearing their shirt doing literally anything bad in the uk.

rugbyunion,fekxr9r,t1_fekr9fi,1579209793.0,No problem I’ve  put a translation in the comments now.
rugbyunion,fekwkux,t3_epouyn,1579209095.0,"I’ve paraphrased a little to cut down on my typing but here’s the translation 

Presenter: it’s cold but nothing is going to stop the Llanelli warriors crew play a game of rugby. I have kit, I have a ball but not a lot of shape or rugby skills so I’m ready...to support

Gwil (coach): we set up in 1995 for a couple of years we played a couple of games now and again then full time 7 games and now over 20 games a year. 

The thing is anyone can come join this team just anyone that wants to play social rugby just come and enjoy together it’s brilliant.  

Rhydian Williams: I was training with them when I was 16 and I’ve been playing for them since I was 18 and I’ve been with them for 10 years now 

Dylan Williams: I like the rugby here but it’s not too hard but at the same time they try and improve everyone. The people are great. 

Presenter: You got a bit of a nickname don’t you

James ‘Milgi’ Anthony: haha oh Milgi...I’m Rapid like a greyhound I chase down every kick it’s a nice name I’ve had a lot worse. 

Then they talk about the recognition the team as had such as winning an award from all wales sport (another great welsh sports institution btw) and the time they got to meet James Haskell. 

Presenter: 2020 is set to be an exciting year for the team because in june they will be travelling across the water to Ireland to compete in the international mixed ability rugby tournament

Gwil: we’ll be playin yn against leading teams across the world with teams from Argentina, Ireland, Scotland and England of course and us and a team from Swansea from wales and we are looking forward to that. 

Rhydian Williams: it was  fantastic news. Thank you to Jamie and Gwilym who arranged it and hopefully we can have a good time and we can have a few games and hopefully we win. 

James ‘Milgi’ Anthony: We will try to win the tournament of course and also enjoy it

Presenter: good luck 

James: thank you very much."

rugbyunion,fe1yi7j,t1_fe1qkvv,1578832360.0,They always go for the captain. When Ken was out they always went to Hughes. It’s not like we are short on welsh speakers for them to spread it out a bit.
rugbyunion,fe1p7ur,t3_enmgxw,1578829226.0,Oh god fucking Robins. The biggest broken record on welsh rugby twitter.

MapPorn,fcfwidh,t1_fcfvowr,1577634350.0,"I am not describing welsh people that don’t agree with me as English you. Absolute disingenuous moron. For example, I’ve never called the people of vale of Glamorgan or Wrexham English because they aren’t. I didn’t even call people in the east English, I said they have large English populations which is an objective fact you absolute fucking moron. I never used it as an insult you lying fucker. 

Honestly, between the lying and the stupidity I’m not sure the point of engaging with you."
MapPorn,fcfv5aa,t1_fcfuor5,1577634016.0,"Lol yeah you just coincidentally came across that old comment right now sure. You might be a complete moron but no one else is dumb enough to fall for it. 

Meanwhile I still love how you are trying to pretend there is racism against the English haha. Unbelievable stuff. Those poor oppressed English."
MapPorn,fcftoui,t1_fcfsq5x,1577633658.0,"Absolute fucking nonsense. I never denied that welsh people aren’t born in England sometimes and  I never said there’s anything wrong with being English. But if you want to keep your head up your arse that places with large  english populations in wales vote a certain distinct way be my guest. 

Meanwhile you’ve actually gone searching through my comment history haha you absolute fucking loser.

Just fuck off you ignorant lying twat. Have to resort to accusations of “racism” (against English people) because you have no facts to help you."

todayilearned,fcesg3i,t1_fcei61y,1577623337.0,Indeed and now the indigenous population are fearing for their lives and the poor will suffer at the hands of yet another US backed dictatorship.
todayilearned,fce9wjb,t1_fcdejbv,1577618426.0,The US/UK will forgive any atrocity against left leaning people. They overthrew the democratically elected socialist president of chile Allende and replaced him with Pinochet who murdered thousands of people and thatcher considered him a great man.
todayilearned,fce9ki9,t1_fcdk1vy,1577618321.0,It’s always in the “name of democracy” but then they go ahead and overthrow/attempt to overthrow all of those democratically elected leftists too. It’s honestly a disgrace. If socialism is really an economic disaster there should be no need for the US to intervene.
