To be considered a child with special needs, a child must meet all three of the criteria below:

The state has determined that the child cannot or should not be returned to the birth parents’ home.

The state has found a specific factor or condition, or combination of factors and conditions, that make the child more difficult to place for adoption. Each state sets its own special needs definition, which may include the child’s ethnic background; age; sibling group status; medical condition; or physical, mental, or emotional disabilities."
