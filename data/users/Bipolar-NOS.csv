microsoft,few7mk9,t3_dexhl7,1579406499.0,"Hi, I would like to know how to sign out of ALL my devices/apps which my Microsoft Account is signed into to.

I changed my account password and that didn’t sign me out. Is there a way to sign out of all devices like other websites like Google?

This concerns me a little bit, because even if I change my password, apps (like Outlook and OneDrive) on my iPhone still have access to my account.

There is also no way to view which devices are signed in from the account dashboard.

Thanks in advanced."

Going through school having a mental illness can be challenging, but we can do it. 🙃

Great job, I wish you the best of luck in your next semester!!!"

Edit: As for the cons... I can’t even begin naming them. 😂"

BipolarReddit,fc7a0ew,t3_egky3n,1577501482.0,"I cope with basically these things:

Memes: I am not even joking, but sometimes when I’m not feeling so well I go on the internet and just look for anything that will make me laugh and distract myself.

Learning: I love the French language and I’ll read books, listen to music, and watch Netflix in French. Not only does this make me feel better, but it gives me a better start to my French major in my university.

If I feel really bad, to the point where it feels like I can’t tune out the “noise” in my brain I will put on music on my stereo and turn it up and just sing along. Like loudly too, not just voice volume. Of course you need to keep the volume reasonable too. I end up just singing and I’m surprised that before I know it I’m much calmer.

And I did find this app today called Woebot, that seems to be good, but I need to use it more to be sure.

Hope this helps, and best of luck finding something that works for you. 🙃"

bipolar,fc0jtm8,t3_efi8q5,1577292437.0,"I use eMoods too! That’s also one thing I like also, you can add custom tracking points. (It’s an in-app purchase though. I think it’s 99cents per month). I love this app."
bipolar,fc0im75,t1_fc06ygc,1577291654.0,"I take Diphenhydramine HCI 50mg. Which is available over the counter at my local Walmart, and it’s apparently an ingredient used in many other brands.

However if something else works better for you, I definitely wouldn’t change it. Different things will work better for other people. I’m glad you found something that helps you! 🙃

As for the caffeine I basically cut it out of my life. (For the most part.) I find that it makes my anxiety worse. So I don’t drink coffee or energy drinks. I will occasionally have a soda, but it will usually be a few hours before I go to sleep. However you have to find what works best for you.

I am by no means a doctor or anything similar, but according to what I know (which isn’t a lot, and could be wrong). The body would have gotten rid of the caffeine after a few hours. So if you’re drinking a cup of coffee in the morning I don’t see why the caffeine wouldn’t wear-off by the time you went to sleep at night.

However I am NOT a doctor, so these are things you should discuss with them as they can give you far better information than I can.

Best of luck!!!

Edit: Sorry I completely missed this part. As for working out regularly. I don’t. 😂"

bipolar,fby3rdf,t3_eeqpde,1577207377.0,"I was taking Geodon / ziprasidone too. (I can’t remember off the top of my head if it was generic or not) but anyways when I stopped I had severe insomnia as well. However I only took Geodon for probably less than 6 months because it was making me super tired.

When I first stopped I couldn’t go to sleep even with over the counter sleep medications. It took me a few days to be able to « SLEEP NORMALLY » again. Although I didn’t taper off the medication, I stopped all completely. (Which was DEFINITELY NOT a good idea on my behalf.) However don’t be discouraged by what I’m about to say next. 😂

It’s been about 6 months since I’ve stopped taking Geodon and I still need to take sleep medication, because if I don’t I’ll still have insomnia.

I talked with my doctor and it did take a while until we found the right over the counter sleep medication.

I would also suggest you talk with your doctor as they can help you find a treatment plan that works best for you.

And like I said above don’t be discouraged by my experience with it. Everyone responds to things differently.

Hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck!!!"
