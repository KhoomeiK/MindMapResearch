It has taken 10 years for him to transform into the cuddlebug he is today.

aww,fdnuyev,t1_fdnsyo2,1578593364.0,"Just so you understand, she was rescued after she was abandoned from her mother.  She would have died otherwise.  It's not like they run out and steal baby polar bears for exhibits.

*Qannik was born in January 2011 in a snow-den her mother dug to protect her from the fury of the Arctic Alaskan winter. She was first spotted on Alaska’s North Slope in February of this year with her mother and sibling. Researchers with the U.S. Geological Survey placed a radio monitoring collar on the mother and were tracking her and the two cubs before the collar slipped off.  In late April, Qannik was spotted again, this time alone.  An unsuccessful aerial search was conducted to locate the mother. It is unknown why Qannik was separated from her mother and sibling but eventually the cub wandered near shore where she was rescued.  The cub took up temporary residence at the Alaska Zoo where the Director, Pat Lampi and his staff took wonderful care of her until a permanent home could be found.*

*Polar Bears International is the leading authority on polar bear research and conservation.  PBI’s Chief Scientist & Vice President, Conservation Science Dr. Steven C. Amstrup had this to say about the cub, “Had she not been rescued, she would have died.  Polar bear cubs stay with their mother for over 2 years as they learn the ways of their Arctic sea ice home.  Cubs of this age (now 6 months), cannot survive on their own.” “It is lucky for Qannik that she was discovered and brought to Louisville where she can flourish and also help us learn about polar bears and the threats to their future existence,” Amstrup concluded.*"
