meirl,ffc9w6k,t3_esjyuo,1579794850.0,That’s a capitalism! You live to work and then you die! But don’t for get to pay for that too!
Wellthatsucks,ffc6ovn,t1_ffc0ss1,1579792793.0,"Well then make it a dog or cat or any other animal then. We are constantly moving the goalpost of what it means to be “human” because we are constantly finding “animals” with those same abilities. We still don’t, and may never, know how or what animals feel. Just pointing out how ridiculous your argument of  “don’t tell people what to do in their own homes” when it comes to cruelty towards animals is."
Wellthatsucks,ffbwcs8,t1_ffbu65t,1579784942.0,"I don’t think that the rodents (or any other wild animal for that matter) appreciate humans destroying their homes either. Just because you didn’t invite it into your home doesn’t make it less cruel to do that to a sentient, feeling animal. I guess you’re a-ok with people abusing children in their own homes, cause, god forbid we tell people what to do in their own homes!"

politics,feog6za,t1_fenhbje,1579299656.0,"Damn, yeah, SO works with a guy who lives in rural-ish VA and commutes to Greenbelt a few days a week and works from home the rest. You just have to go so far out from the DC metro area to find semi-affordable housing/houses."

news,feldgi0,t1_fel9igd,1579219591.0,"This, to me, would mean that should make cops actually nicer and thinking about the good they could do instead of fantasizing about getting into a shootout.  I grew up with that same mentality, until every pig I ever encountered did the exact opposite of being the “good guy”."
offmychest,felcyz5,t1_felb23u,1579219264.0,"That’s *your* perspective. If you were in that situation and suffering from depression or a chronic ailment, you might not have that same perspective. Good for you that you’re loving life, but not everyone has that going for them."

offmychest,felaitt,t1_fel6vdr,1579217651.0,"Oh, so because some people had it worse we should never try to make anything better right? Fuck this mentality."
offmychest,fel9kr4,t3_epndfj,1579217046.0,"Much of this is because of capitalism. We live to work instead of working to live, and everything is judged by what “value” it has. Unless we change that, not much will change for us."

news,fel4yvu,t1_fekseo4,1579214167.0,"Yeah, because of their victim mentality that they claim everyone else has... Its their own fucking fault they’re ruminating on it."

Damnthatsinteresting,feesqzp,t1_fedndq1,1579040414.0,"Lmao, I stopped reading after you said police killings are not a gun issue. Why the fuck do you think pigs carry guns? Cause they’re fucking everywhere. No pigs with guns = no ppl killed by pigs with guns."
