bipolar,ff51twy,t3_erj3a7,1579577939.0,"I’m ultra aware of my triggers and ground myself when I get close to them. For instance, religion and philosophy is a trigger for me and I’m taking an ethics course right now. So I’m cooking, cleaning, writing everything down I need to do like brush my teeth, wash my face. I try to keep a handle on my emotions and mood. I take my medicine. I stopped the dreams that I wasn’t capable anymore. I used to crave power and wealth now I’m okay just being an underling and accepted being middle class."
bipolar,fecknb2,t3_eof8go,1578976238.0,First I set myself up for success by always making sure I have money in the bank to cover everything and avoid fees. I have 2k wiggle room in my checking. I have 6 months emergency fund in my savings. Other than that I follow Dave Ramsey. Anything over 2k at the end of the month goes toward debt. I treat my credit card like checking. I’m 30% through my car loan and I should have it paid off by July. My student loans are next but because I’m in school I don’t have to pay anything. I use the every dollar app to track all spending. I eat at home as much as I can.
bipolar,feck2mg,t1_fec5a7h,1578975825.0,I double majored in supply chain and management. Applied to multiple internships. Did multiple internships and did a good enough job to get full time job offer after graduating. Did a good job for two years in software implementation then transferred to a low cost state and worked in supply chain for a year or so. I applied to a program management role and got it. I also got a masters in supply chain during that time. I just enrolled in a masters in project management.

bipolar,feazkqo,t3_eo61pg,1578953897.0,"Hey that’s what disability is for. It’s to help people when they can’t help themselves because of their disability. Just know that this spot your in maybe temporary while you get used to your meds or find the right meds for you. Confession I sometimes go off my meds and don’t tell anyone just because I feel so numb on them. It’s also super inconvenient to take meds like you have to swallow them and sometimes I gag. When I skip my meds I sometimes have a dream letting me know I barely scrapped by without an episode when I start taking them again. It’s a really weird relationship. I would just say for me I was able to find a job that allows me to work from home when I need it so maybe find a career/education pathway that will allow you to work from home. I’m literally laying here not showered, working and talking to you on reddit at the same time. Life’s easier when you find the hacks to get you by. Working from home is one of my hacks."
bipolar,fdgy9pc,t3_el7i2y,1578411273.0,"Great job! Since my appointment with the gastric bypass dr where he told me I have to lose 15 lbs to get it done, I have lost 9 lbs. I haven’t eaten fast food since then and have been making my food from scratch."
AskReddit,fd6piii,t3_ejxtkl,1578194148.0,"I’m bipolar and it’s hereditary. I was raised by a grandmother that taught me not to have sex so I was a virgin till I was 24. The guy I gave my virginity to ended up being married and other relationships scared me away from men. The guy I was engaged to for example is now in prision for pulling a gun on people in a fit of anger. I broke up with him because in a fight in the car he pulled the emergency brake and busted my window. I decided to pursue education and my own career during the best baby making time. 24-34 I got 4 degrees and a middle class job escaping poverty and every time I try to find a mate it ends badly. So I kinda gave up trying to find a partner. I’m now 34 and all my goals are related to education, career, and financial goals. I’ve just decided to make my life dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. I have a fur baby cat and find my need for love answered by her."
politics,fcpdoix,t3_ei7e2c,1577859582.0,How many issues is Bernie going to take on? Is he going to save the world like some kind of politics jesus? I’m all for progressives but Obama the first black president who’s saying was hope and change only did one thing really which was Obamacare and it’s pretty much dismantled now. If we couldn’t have change then I doubt we will have change now.

bipolar,fc4p8cz,t3_eg6kxi,1577423552.0,"No. I have love for the world in general but it’s not my role to save anyone but myself. I’ll give blood and if a non profit ever offers me a job that pays more than the job I have now including benefits I would use my skills to better the world. But other then that I just concentrate on reality like meal planning, cuddling/playing with my cat, studying, cooking, cleaning, talking to my friends and family, and watching entertainment that interests me. I only concentrate on spiritual stuff when I’m manic."
