WTF,ffphe2y,t1_ffp0o43,1580095088.0,Ya'll don't think that's a bit of an overreaction?
mildlyinfuriating,ffohkew,t1_ffmovhe,1580077670.0,Brooklyn Italian checking in - this was my first thought
nottheonion,ffn2qde,t1_ffmxgs2,1580061377.0,"I know but this is *Arizona* man. Lol they kill people for no reason at all, there! And this meathead is running around spray painting penis man on public property? Lollllllllll cmon! I cannot be the only one sittin here like well ok what did he think was going to happen.

And let's not forget some basic and just completely asinine facts of the case:

1 - a grown ass man had this idea. Now, I dunno how old he is but he's got hair on his face, which makes him old enough in my book. So, ok it's a juvenile idea. We all have em and maybe we'll be like ha ha to our friends. But acting on it?

2 - a grown ass man acted on this juvenile idea. That's where it goes from juvenile to just outright infantile. Bc now other people have to clean up the mess.

Idgaf what rationalization or justification he has or message he's trying to send. That's just absurd. There's no defending that, imo. Me personally? I'd throw em in a prison shower and hit him with a cold hose for a solid 2 minutes. Like in Rambo first blood? Then give him a a moist wool blanket to sit and think about what he did. But that's just me."
Military,ffmxchw,t1_ffmgza0,1580059856.0,"You're not understanding: it's assumed and known as soon as they see the resume. It's not something you can just shrug and deny.

And even if you did get hired - bullshitting a resume is one thing. Everyone does that. But outright lying about something like that? It would make me question your character when it became known. And it always does."
madlads,ffmg1e5,t1_ffmfnk2,1580054190.0,I've been on reddit since day zero and this was the first normal civilized conversation I've ever had. Thanks bro.
madlads,ffmfien,t1_ffmeuew,1580053898.0,See that's a rock solid idea right there and way better than my last two.
madlads,ffme90k,t1_ffm9tv9,1580053252.0,Lol yea shot in the dark. Really the only excuse I could think for doing that would be a massive discount on the venue
nottheonion,ffm5w8m,t1_ffm48lq,1580049067.0,"Right but this aspect of Arizona culture is known. Right, wrong or indifferent, crying about getting the exact results you fucking knew you were going to get is just childish. But he's scribbling the word penis on walls, so I guess it makes sense.

I get what you're trying to say but this is definitely one of those moments where the man's method of expression overshadowed whatever point he was trying to make.

He's scribbling penis on the wall and crying when he gets yelled at. Let's be honest about what's happening, here. This is absurd."
nottheonion,fflymt0,t3_eu22x4,1580045831.0,"Ah fuck this guy. A grown ass man running around scribbling the word penis on stuff. Like a child. In Arizona? Lol and then he's gonna cry about a gun being pointed at him? fuck outta here. Oh and they didn't feed him for 5 whole hours? Fuck how did he make it out alive?

And then there's this choice piece of foolishness:

""For the record, I hate the institution of the police. But, I do not think every single cop is a bastard. To say they all are, is imo, stooping to their level of profiling. Some of the detectives I met seemed to be genuine penis man fans.""

K bruh so the only good cops are the ones who you think like what you do? Has anyone told this penis man that he's being laughed *at* not *with*? Bc a grown ass man running around scribbling penis on stuff is pathetic."

And ima beat him to death on the spot. No words no discussion no debate just fucking instakill. I will never forget that moment when I reached for my soap and got a handful of strange jizz. Never.
