Also, I’m not really a fan of this somewhat recent trend of slow, artsy, boring opening credit sequences that seems to have gained prominence, especially amongst streaming originals. I’m worried I’m going to fall asleep before the show comes back for the next act.

Really enjoyed the episode overall though."
Picard,ffe1iny,t1_ffe0o7r,1579834274.0,"Yes, because a common thing for creators to do is to change things “just to change things” and create drama for no reason, and to send an FU to the people who will potentially be watching their show and as a result keeping them employed because he secretly hates the franchise that pays his bills, himself, and his job. You’ve figured it all out. It isn’t what you personally would have preferred and so it must be an intentional attack on you and the fan base as a whole.

He is the creator. He gets to make decisions. Because you aren’t in on those decisions or don’t agree with them doesn’t mean there isn’t a rationale behind any of it, all of which he’s discussed in interviews if you care to seek it out. Hell, I don’t like every decision he’s made either, but I understand that there are reasons he made them and that he believes those reasons to be valid.

And yes, I’m sure it’s the Prime timeline, just as Discovery is. Because the creators have said so. Repeatedly and ad nauseum because people keep on insisting that they’re lying for some reason (as if doing so accomplished anything or served any purpose). Also it’s the only way any of it makes sense. In Picard, they’re literally talking about the event that happened in the Prime Timeline that led to the creation of the Kelvin Timeline. Time travel shenanigans aside, it’s really not that complicated unless you’re just insisting on not seeing the obvious because it isn’t what you want."
Picard,ffe09uo,t3_et3unp,1579833372.0,"This is explicitly *not* in the Kelvin timeline. The Romulan sun going nova, as mentioned in the episode, is the same event that led to Spock and Nero traveling back in time from the Prime timeline to *create* the Kelvin timeline.

Also, the Klingon reimagining on Discovery hasn’t made them lizard people. It’s a hell of a lot less drastic of a makeover than they underwent after their initial appearances on TOS and transitioned into the movies and TNG. They’ve just got a little extra loaf and a little less hair."

I’ve been playing on and off since late 2e and I had never DMed nor played in a game based on a published adventure until about a year and a half ago. We all just grew up making shit up and if it was fun, we were told so and if it wasn’t, we took constructive criticism on how to make it more fun next time.

If it was crunch time and you needed to launch a whole extended campaign, that’s one thing, but you need enough material to fill a few hours. You know what it is fun to you. You probably know what is fun to your players. You can do this! You have it within you! I have the utmost faith in you, complete stranger!

Of *course* people expect a product like this for free. Because it was free for the first 50 years of the franchise’s history. Discovery wasn’t just the first Trek that was streaming exclusive, but it was the first that didn’t run on network television. Every previous Trek (films aside) was accessible with a television and a decent antenna, not even a cable subscription, so even just $6 is an infinity percent increase.

That said, there’s very little crossover. A lot of people just watch all of TNG, then all of DS9, then all of VOY, and you wouldn’t really be missing anything doing that. Only word of caution I’d give is to save the second and third TNG films until you’re at least four or five seasons into DS9 and the last one until after VOY. The first is fine to watch right after wrapping TNG."
DungeonsAndDragons,ff5s3k8,t3_ertj3r,1579608109.0,"What should have happened on crit:

You roll the damage die associated with your weapon *twice* (this is the effect of the crit) and add any modifiers once. Let’s say your weapon deals d6 and you have a +2 modifier. You roll 2d6, and let’s say you got a total of 7. Then add your +2 modifier and get 9. You deal 9 damage.

If this was enough to kill the creature according to the DM, you then have the option to declare that you’re intent was not to kill and you were dealing “subdual” damage. If you do that, the creature is unconscious instead of dead. There is no check necessary on your part to do this.

There *is* a scenario where massive damage can override your attempt to incapacitate rather than kill, but this only comes into play when the final blow reduces the creature to the inverse of its hit point maximum.

So in the above sample where you dealt 9 damage, if the creature’s hit point maximum was 5 or above (assuming it was at full health at the time of your attack), you can still declare the subdual damage and knock it unconscious. If it had 4 or fewer hit points, your blow would have accidentally killed it because it would have dropped it from 4 to -5.

That said, lacking that knowledge, what your DM did given that he didn’t know what to do, was the recommended thing: make up a ruling so as not to slow down the game, look it up after the game and make the correction going forward."

It’s just moved into longer form storytelling which requires more time spent in “darker” times so that the light at the end stands in contrast. We’re all just used to a bright future being briefly interrupted by conflict and then returning to a bright future all in one episode. Now, we get a bright time, interrupted by conflict for several episodes, and resolving in a hopeful future. It’s still one story that starts bright, gets dark, and then gets bright again, it’s just a longer story.

DMAcademy,feen8yw,t1_feeipgj,1579037187.0,"Oh, my dude, you gotta check out the Spelljammer setting.

Reader's Digest version: Worlds like Toril (Forgotten Realms), Oerth (Greyhawk), Krynn (Dragonlance), etc. are all planets in solar systems like the real universe. At the edge of most systems is a ""crystal shell"" (the shell and everything in it is referred to as a ""crystal sphere"" rather than a solar system). The shell is pockmarked with portals that allow passage to and from the interior (these are the stars you can see at night). The space inside a shell is much like real outer space and is referred to as ""wildspace"" but the space outside, all the vast space between the individual crystal shells, is filled with a luminous gas called ""phlogiston"" which can be navigated by magic-powered sailing ships through the use of ""spelljamming helms"" worn by wizards.

ALL of this makes up the Prime Material Plane, which means we haven't even gotten into any of the Planescape/Sigil stuff which is what you start to hit outside the Prime Material (though you can certainly use the Planescape material to travel between distant points within the Prime Material, such as moving planet-to-planet.

There are some weirdo exceptions. Ravenloft is set on the Demiplane of Dread, which is a demiplane (obviously) floating out there in the Astral Sea or whatever. Athas, the world of Dark Sun, is also a planet in the Prime Material, but one that has a crystal shell which is nearly impossible to penetrate via spelljamming ship. Mystara has an oddly enormous crystal shell so you can still get to it by spelljamming, but your in-system travel-time is greatly increased due to the vastness of the wildspace surrounding it, making it a world that doesn't get a lot of contact. Eberron has never been explicitly placed in the Prime Material, nor the crystal sphere beyond the planet itself well-documented outside of moons.

Spelljammer is great. There is a playable race of bipedal space hippos. Probably should just lead with that next time."

A single level 3 player would find a CR 1/2 creature to be an “easy” fight and a CR 1 creature to be a “difficult” fight according to the way those terms are classified in the DMG. So I’d consider the level 3 player to be a CR 3/4 creature (the imaginary CR where that player would find a “medium” encounter) with an XP value halfway between the XP values of the CR 1/2 and CR 1 creatures.

Solution: 150 XP.

(For comparison, a “medium” encounter for a party of four level 3 players is CR 3, worth 700 XP, so this shouldn’t be a very tough fight at all, but they don’t all have to be.)

It isn't so much that there are two separate god-like spider-monster beings called ""Lolth"" that inhabit two different worlds, as there is one ""Lolth"" who, being a god, can manifest in multiple places simultaneously, and for whom the death of one aspect, while it probably isn't pleasant, doesn't effect the whole in the way one might expect of a mortal being. So one could argue that an aspect of Nerull acted as the god of death on Nerath centuries ago, but that aspect was destroyed/killed/mitigated by the Raven Queen who then took his portfolio on that world, and all of this has no bearing on Nerull's activities on Oerth before or since then. I'm into it.

Has there been any firm evidence that the old timeline connections via crossover are no longer valid? I keep wanting to just say ""hey, time runs at different rates in different crystal spheres"" and just handwave it that way, but I don't think that's ever been something established by Spelljammer.

Of course, this is all assuming you want to run a multi-world campaign that fits absolutely 100% within established canon, which there's really no reason to do... but did I mention I'm a bit of a pedant?"

Greyhawk,fdkssmv,t1_fdkrky7,1578510408.0,"I don’t think there’s been any formal effort, but there have been enough crossover connections over the years that just about every setting can be placed temporally against any other at this point with the exceptions of, I think Ravnica and Eberron (which is perpetually in the same year anyway). The post-Spellplague time jump in FR left most of the other settings behind though, except, oddly, the the real world (1491 DR is equivalent to 1749 CE). Of course, none of this is stuff the average person worries about when making a campaign. Hell, I don’t even think WotC knows or cares about it."
Greyhawk,fdkepdx,t1_fdka42x,1578502288.0,"If you want to get really pedantic:

We know from the ""Abyssal Plague"" novels that ""current"" Points of Light lines up with 1479 DR on Toril, which is 591 CY on Oerth (we can sync those two settings up thanks to the events of the ""Vecna Trilogy"" of modules at the end of 2e.

The ""Divine Power"" supplement for 4e, written from the perspective of ""current"" PoL (roughly 1479 DR/699 CY) refers to the Raven Queen having taken over for Nerull ""long centuries"" ago. Taking that literally, it would mean she took over at least as far back as 1279/499 CY, which would be 77 years before the beginning of Greyhawk as a playable setting.

So either Nerull had already been replaced by the Raven Queen way back in 1e but was still repeatedly referenced as the god of death throughout 1e, 2e, and 3e Greyhawk with no mention of the Raven Queen, or the Nerull that was a deity on Nerath is actually a completely different entity and the Raven Queen killing him has no bearing on Oerth's Nerull.

I'm sure the real explanation is that the people writing up the PoL backstory didn't do the math to sync things up (or actually, the people writing the ""Abbysal Plague"" novels didn't), but it does leave the door open for a rationale for how Nerull could still be the death god of Oerth in a way that fits canon.

I believe there's precedent for this. I'd need to go looking for the source again, but I think I read at one point that either Gygax or Greenwood definitively stated that their individual versions of Lolth were in fact separate entities. I'm sure that's not the current stance of WotC now though."

Greyhawk,fdk1ocb,t1_fdirfdx,1578493852.0,"I was wondering the same but found the wiki article. Is Nerull one of the many deities from other settings that was “borrowed” by the Points of Light setting in 4e? I don’t believe the Raven Queen has ever been portrayed as an Oerthian deity (hell, I don’t think she existed the last time there was an update to the Greyhawk setting. If so, it’s possible that the Raven Queen’s taking over of Nerull’s portfolio is limited only to that world. Maybe the God of Death role is currently vacant on Oerth... brb, just want to update my resume."

Actually, I should go digging through my old comments.

ElderScrolls,fdhjz9b,t1_fdhifte,1578424259.0,"Then we're agreed: it's not a \*generally accepted\* scientific term. You stated that it was a ""proper"" term for someone of African descent but then agreed that there is a dispute over its use in the fields of biology and anthropology. Being an acceptable way of talking about a \*corpse\* does not make it an acceptable way to talk about a people. If it was, there wouldn't be the dispute you yourself acknowledge. So, since we're not talking about forensic medicine here, again, I suggest you update your lexicon. Or do you want to keep moving the goal post even further?"
ElderScrolls,fdhgo6r,t1_fdhfyuu,1578422253.0,"“Negroid” is far from a generally accepted scientific term. Its use is highly controversial, especially among social scientists, for being more culturally based than having any actual distinct biological definition. You might want to update your lexicon.

As for “Negro,” not being a member of the African American community, I can’t speak to its current understanding of the offensiveness of the word, but... nah, man. I’m not touching that."
ElderScrolls,fdhfddn,t1_fdhei3x,1578421473.0,"I’m not sure how this is a relevant response. Is the implication that it can be whatever the devs want because it isn’t real? That’s true, but it still needs to work within the rules established for the setting itself. If I made Fantasy Scandinavia and populated it with white folk, complaining that it’s made up so it should have more black folk is... pretty silly. Because it’s Fantasy Scandinavia.

Yes, there aren’t a lot of Redguard because the game isn’t set in that part of the world. And the rules of the world are that Skyrim doesn’t have a lot of Redguard living there because it’s pretty far from the part of the world where they originate and there is a medieval level of technology (another rule of the made up world) that doesn’t allow for people to get around over long distances commonly.

There is a whole other game set in that part of the world though. And another spinoff game literally called “Redguard.”

Also. Dude. Bruh. You can’t complain about something else being “stuck in the 50s” while throwing around a term like “negroes.”

I’m pretty sure you’re just a troll trying to make fun of people who actually think the way you’re pretending to think. If this is the case, please take the response of this community, in pointing out that the way you’re (pretending) to think is silly as hell to be evidence that no one actually does think that way and your whole argument is effectively a straw man arguing against an imaginary opponent.

If you are serious, I apologize because apparently you are the only person who actually does think that way. Your argument is still really silly though."
