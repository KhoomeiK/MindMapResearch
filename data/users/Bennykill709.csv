TheExpanse,ffao45l,t1_ffaizhu,1579740514.0,"The sandstorms on Mars are nowhere near as powerful as what is presented in the Martian.  That’s Magic.  Not hard Sci-Fi by your own definition.  Any science fiction requires speculation about scientific discovery or technology that hasn’t been invented yet, otherwise it would simply be fiction.

I wasn’t even debating whether or not The Expanse is classified as Hard Sci-Fi.  That term is completely meaningless and differs from person to person.  What the post is originally talking about is that The Expanse does pay close attention to scientific accuracy in many more ways than most other Sci-Fi on film or television"
TheExpanse,ffai5oy,t1_ff8p2f4,1579736296.0,"At the risk of repeating what so many people have said already, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"".  I'm not really concerned with the scientific accuracy in regards to the Protomolecule as much as I'm interested in how everyone in the Expanse reacts to it.  I mean, can anyone really say that something like that is completely impossible?

Think about how people reacted to Copernicus when he theorized that the sun was the center of the universe rather than the Earth, or when Einstein theorized that light operates as both a wave and a particle.  How about more recently with the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle?  Discoveries that seem to break the laws of physics and reality happen all the time, and saying that something like the Protomolecule could never happen is like saying that we will never discover anything ever again."
TheExpanse,ffafd9e,t1_ff93zr1,1579734433.0,"I also keep telling everyone to watch the show through Ep 4, just because I want them to see what happens to Shed.  It's usually at that point that most people become invested in the show, but for me, it has always been the focus on space realism starting with the very first episode."
TheExpanse,ffaf3sm,t1_ff8ovjt,1579734240.0,"I also really like the contrast between the PM and the ""current"" technology seen in the show.  I can never remember where I saw it (something like Nerdwriter or Wisecrack), but somebody had a video that talked about one aspect that makes great Sci-Fi great, specifically that they take the extra-ordinary and make it mundane.

Essentially, The Expanse has technology that to us in the 21st century seems amazing and blows our minds, but to the characters in the show, it's not really all that interesting because they use the technology on a daily basis, and have done so for their entire lives.  None of the characters in the show are fascinated by the Epstein Drive or Anti-Matter fusion, just like the average person in our society isn't blown away by chemical rockets or the combustion engine.

And then the Protomolecule happens, taking the amazing technology that we as the audience gawk at and making it even more mundane by comparison.  There isn't a lot of fiction out there that does it so effectively as The Expanse, and it's one of the reasons why the show is probably my favorite of all time."
TheExpanse,ffad3nr,t1_ff8tqkr,1579732712.0,"As cool as that scene is, it's not really accurate.  Even in a location that's closer to the center of spin, the liquid would still fall straight down, only more slowly, accelerating as it approaches the outer edge of the spinning object.  However, if you were to throw an object, you would likely see a significant difference in the distance it would travel whether you were throwing it spinward, or anti-spinward.

In fact, if you threw an object anti-spinward hard enough, it wouldn't hit the ground at all, barring friction from the air or the object hitting a wall.  This actually makes the scene where Naomi and Drummer are playing Wall-Ball (can't remember what they call it in the show) pretty interesting.  I don't think there's anything they did in the show or the books to describe it, but that game would play VERY differently on a spinning station than it would in true gravity or under thrust, which is probably why it's a popular sport for Belters."
HalfLife,ffa7fy9,t1_ff9rrdo,1579729352.0,"I imagine it's the same as in real life.  Even an M249 *can* be used one handed, but that doesn't mean that it should."
HalfLife,ffa6wz2,t1_ff9ibvt,1579729059.0,"I understand the reasoning behind doing the VO in only one (Human) language, but one thing I really love to do, which is not really available in most games, is changing the language to the one that is accurate to the setting of the game, even if I don't speak that language.  For example, I really enjoy playing Assassins Creed II in Italian as it adds to the authenticity.

I argue that since City 17 is based in Eastern Europe, it would be neat to at least hear some Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, etc. coming at least from some of the non-essential NPC's, or even more interestingly, from some of the CPs or Combine Soldiers."
HalfLife,ffa29r9,t1_ff9h4ot,1579726444.0,"Yep, there were a couple of points in Boneworks that scared the ever loving piss out of me, and that game is far from what I would consider a ""Horror"" game.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to fear-quit HL:A a few times."

YouShouldKnow,ff1nabf,t3_eqys24,1579482015.0,"Kindof upset that the site didn’t mention that while space is technically cold, it will not insta-freeze you like so much fiction portrays (lookin at you, latest season of Lost In Space).  Heat in a vacuum would only be lost through radiation, which is much slower than on Earth, where heat can much more quickly be transferred to the atmosphere that’s always touching you."
YouShouldKnow,ff1mh8n,t1_fezwvty,1579481624.0,Right?  It could be said that every invention is science fiction until it the moment that it’s built and it works.
YouShouldKnow,ff1m6za,t1_ff0dlng,1579481480.0,"I saw a video a while ago (either Nerdwriter or wisecrack, I can’t remember which) that said that one of the things that makes great science fiction great is the ability to take extra-ordinary technology and make it mundane.  For example, in Star Trek, the technology that blows our minds like Warp Drives, Phasers, Hypo-Sprays, Teleports, Replicators, etc. aren’t really focused on too much by the characters in the story because those technologies are so ubiquitous in their world that they just never really think about it, just like we do with smart phones, voice controlled AI assistants, the internet, etc.

That idea really stuck with me, and now, even though I think a lot about the cool technologies we could have in the future, I try not to focus on it too much in my stories because the characters in those stories usually don’t give them any thought."

askscience,fdoro9i,t1_fdmpidq,1578611372.0,"Disclaimer: This is my very basic understanding. If its incorrect, please politely enlighten me!

Oxygen as an element by itself naturally bonds with whatever it can, which is why you don’t often find it by itself naturally, and is also why it’s super useful in life, but the downside is that it will bond to elements inside your body and change chemical structures in a negative way, sometimes causing cellular death or cancer.  When you buy a drink that advertises anti-oxidants, the theory is that elements in the drink will bond with the free oxygen in your body and prevent that oxygen from bonding with the elements in your cells, and ultimately preventing the aforementioned cell death and cancer.

If this is correct, it would explain why pure oxygen would eventually destroy your lungs first, as well as anything else it comes in contact with."

I wasn't bragging about how nice it is to be in the US, nor was I bragging about it being worse than anywhere else (because who the fuck would?).

From an American, maybe we’re not so different after all... I won’t pretend the situations are identical, and I don’t know enough to say whether it’s more or less prevalent (probably much less), but it does still happen frequently here in the States, and I do feel like shit for living here when it does.

Edit: I guess trying to relate to my fellow human being was the wrong choice somehow.  That’ll teach me!  Let me fix this by acknowledging that the US has the smallest dick in the domestic atrocity contest and we should just keep our fucking mouths shut on the topic."
