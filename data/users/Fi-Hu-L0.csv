My dad didn't want to live there and moved to city for better schools. She didn't know what i was going through but she couldn't have helped. Yeah it's not her fault."
offmychest,fc62snc,t1_fc5wu66,1577470979.0,"Once I was returning from grandma's, and I remember the only memory of me asking her to come with us, I was literally crying and asking her to come with us, because when she was around me, my dad didn't beat me up. She said she can't come and I was so scared. Now I understand why I was so scared, because at that time I thought it was normal, I was a kid then, and I presumed everyone gets beaten up like that. My college friends and internet helped me realise that this shit fucks you up for life in someway or another. 
It made me hate him so much, but he was brought up in same condition and I don't think everyone realises what they faced was wrong and they deserve better, and then they think to fix a child you have to beat him up and curse him. I forgave him and decided to help myself to be better. But me being a little emotional it's hard to change myself. The fear is now so deeply settled in my head. I always have doubts about myself. I hope someday these will be gone, and I will be my complete self."
