I make a lot of use of the ""list randomizer"" at random.org, because for some reason having something else take responsibility for making a decision, even if it's not human, helps me get going in SOME direction at least. I put my to-do list on there and do the first thing on the list. Then I scramble again and do the first thing.

I was stuck for months on an art project and I finally divided it up into one-inch squares and started drawing in random locations, just a square inch at a time. I just couldn't come up with a coherent idea for the whole thing OR just start randomly scribbling in hopes I'd make something cool by accident, so this was my last-ditch strategy. The jury is still out, but at least I'm working on it now instead of just worrying about it. We'll call this the ""divide and randomize"" strategy. I use it for housework and various other things I need to get done. I won't do it if it's not fun, and I like math and games, so it generally gets me moving. I get so overwhelmed trying to figure out where to start, this is the only way I can do it. I'm just not a linear thinker."

At least the redditors I've spoken to who felt like that seemed sick.

I read a Jack London novel recently where the narrator really did love the woman as a kindred spirit, but at the same time repeatedly equated her small size and physical weakness with femininity, because it made him want to be big and strong and protective.

It can be done, but it's not always successful, and it's not necessary to start in pots. Now is the time to sow them in the ground. Anytime just before or during the rainy season. They're not fussy. Honestly, you can just chuck them out there and keep the ground moist and they'll grow. You may have them coming out of cracks in the paving in the future. Unless you have issues with foot traffic or dog pee or something, it's really better to sow them in place.

I don't know about the milkweed. Probably similar, but I haven't grown those from seed, so I'm not sure. I have one in my garden that I bought in a pot, but it hasn't bloomed yet.

California wildflowers do not need fertilizer (my soil is almost pure sand. The poppies do not care). They usually start growing as soon as the rains come, and grow right through the winter in areas where there is no hard frost, speeding up in the spring.

I mean, other than being messy, he's more of an adult than anyone else I ever dated. He went from penniless musician to tech executive in the course of a few years, so I'm not calling him useless.

It has been a learning experience for both of us. I eventually got diagnosed with ADHD-C, and I suspect he has the inattentive type and just hasn't been inconvenienced enough to get help for it. He has much more of a sense of humor about his ""absentmindedness"" lately, instead of getting defensive like he used to. I used to have a great deal of trouble having an argument in real time because of my slow processing speed, so now that I'm getting treatment I'm better at communicating and standing up for myself. He still organizes better when it's something he cares about like his music, but he pulls his weight around the house now.

The absence of work stress has really helped. I used to have to check the car after he drove to see if he remembered to set the parking brake.

menwritingwomen,ffj07xo,t1_ffijfwu,1579987097.0,"The ""what's in this drink"" line is the inexcusable part for me. The rest of it can be explained away, but that is date rape right there.

Edit: I stand corrected. Apparently it's an old joke I had never heard of, so TIL. Still sounds creepy to my modern ears."
Feminism,ffiya1t,t1_ffisyrj,1579985686.0,"Yes. I think it's hard for some people to keep from taking it personally, as if beagle owners saw any praise of poodles as a threat to the very existence of beagles. I read a post today talking about how some people have a mindset that sees everything in terms of ""us and them""; what benefits others must mean we lose something."

California,ffiktlk,t1_ffij5df,1579976269.0,"Have you ever heard of ""divide and conquer""? Making California police its borders on three sides, have its own military, and deal with two different international borders instead of one, with all the trade and transportation issues that come with that, doesn't seem like a positive change to me. The U.S. would still have vastly superior resources in terms of land and population. Brexit is a shitty idea, and so is Calexit. You know Nigel Farage came over to campaign for the last secession effort, right? That's a good reason to look for trouble right there. It's not in our best interest. Sure, it's doable, but I'd rather be a leader than a recluse, if you catch my drift."
