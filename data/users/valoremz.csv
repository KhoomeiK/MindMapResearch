For outdoor workouts (such as going for a run) I think it's fantastic. But if you workout indoors it's not that great. If you run on a treadmill the watch is inaccurate in measuring your distance because it's based on movement of your hand over time vs. distance over time when you run outdoors. If you lift weights there is only a ""strength training"" mode that counts calories but that's somewhat pointless. I'd recommend the FitBod app for weight lifting."
