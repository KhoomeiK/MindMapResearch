We pay extremely high public school taxes, yet we homeschool. No big deal, that's our choice. Why not just incorporate that same concept into higher education? Everyone deserves education if they want to improve themselves. 

We already pay for expensive ""just in case"" health insurance through premiums without going to the doctors office for months or even years. Why not just incorporate that concept into equal healthcare for everyone through taxes? It seems so simple to me. 

We pay for ""social security"" that may not even exist if we ever need it.

I am not trying to start any arguments with this post, but voting, and this year's election, is very important to me, and I think it's important to all of us. Even though I don't personally believe that ""political affiliation"" is beneficial, because of the way we are set up here in the United States and in Florida, we have to be registered as Republican or Democrat in order to properly vote for our next leader. We are one of 12 states set up this way. 

The upcoming primary election is our opportunity as Floridians to select which candidate we want to run for president in the November 2020 general election.

The 2020 Presidential Preference Primary Election (PPP) is part of the nominating process in Florida for the United States presidential elections.  In the PPP, voters registered as Republican or Democrat (because we have no other choice), choose their preference for the presidential candidate they would like to see fighting for us in November! 

Because Florida has a closed primary, that means that you need to be registered as a Democrat, in order to vote Democrat in the primary election. THE DEADLINE IS FEBRUARY 18, 2020.

Florida's primary election is March 17, 2020. If you can't make it on March 17th, you can pick an earlier date that works for you, because Florida has early voting available from March 7th - March 14th. I will post about the locations for early voting as soon as I know where. The locations are still being determined. 

Everything regarding registering to vote, or changing your affiliation, can be done online. You can register for the first time, renew your registration, or change your party affiliation from Republican to Democrat here:

https://registertovoteflorida.gov/home

If there are any questions about voting here in Florida, or if you'd like to know who I think would make an awesome president, please ask or dialogue with me in the comments."
