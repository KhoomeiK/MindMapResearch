During my finals in school I had trouble with palpitations caused by stress and I went to my doctor and got a prescription which really helped me. So even though your problem might be a mental one visiting your doctor and getting treatment could still alleviate some of this."
selfimprovement,fegykw8,t1_fdx78fo,1579105400.0,Thanks. I've never thought of it that way.
AmItheAsshole,fd2pyjy,t1_fd28swg,1578150520.0,NTA There are also sports DVDs and several YouTube Channels out there
selfimprovement,fd1vsfu,t1_fd1e8cd,1578137591.0,I second that. It's a good book
self,fcxlpr2,t3_ejfnee,1578065966.0,"I'm in the same boat as you are, just a few years down the road. 

I realized over the years that I wasn't taught structure in my childhood and it has affecting me in my adult life. This means having to restart building habits, self-discipline and self-esteem. I could imagine that another problem for you could be perfectionism/fear of failure playing into that as well like if you don't try properly, you haven't failed or not being motivated to put much effort into it because you believe you can't get the perfect grade.

One possibility is reading self-help books and applying that knowledge. I know they seem cliché but actually many of them are well researched and referenced and it's still cheaper than a therapist.

Books I can recommend Atomic Habits (James Clear), Deep Work (Cal Newport).

I hope you can turn this around."
self,fcxkd5r,t3_ejbapb,1578065056.0,"These things don't make you a bad person.

These things make you a person who deals with several mental health issues trying to cope. You're not an attention seeker, you're are someone who is hurting and desperately reaching for help.

I see someone who cares a great deal about people around you. If you didn't you wouldn't feel upset about it.

You also want to be accepted and loved and there's nothing wrong with that."
childfree,fcugasn,t3_eio7z2,1577980264.0,I know reddit seems to have the idea that you can't tell your friends what you're actually thinking but you and Kate seem very close and this might be the time to have an honest conversation about your concerns regarding this change of mind.
self,fcu9lm0,t3_eiujez,1577975796.0,"I know your situation. I often feel regret about talking too much.

In my experience it can come from not having enough people in your every day life you can share thoughts and experiences with.

A strategy I use is that if I talk for an amount I try to make the person opposite of me talk the same amount by asking questions and always stay aware of the conversation flow.

I get tripped up by people asking me questions about my life, that's when I start rambling but I am aware of it these days. Funnily enough, this how you can get other people to talk more.

Also if you're close enough you can ask people about it. It totally blew my mind when after a girl's night out friend A asked friend B how satisfied she was with her active share in the conversation throughout the evening. It totally blew my mind that you could ask people (at least the ones you're close to) such a question and get an honest feedback so I wouldn't be wondering the next few days if I talked too much."
selfimprovement,fcu8evi,t3_eixloq,1577974994.0,"To work on your self-worth you need to work on your belief system. This belief system develops usually in early childhood containing perceived ""truths"" about yourself and your surroundings, resulting in behaviors that helped you ""survive"" your circumstances. In adulthood these behaviors are often no longer appropriate. I unfortunately don't have recommendation for a book in English but I'm sure with a little bit of digging you can find something."
self,fcrx53t,t1_fcqvsqm,1577907831.0,"What if it does? Depression makes us think in distorted ways, being hopeless is a symptom. You definitely didn't always feel as bad as you do now even though retrospectively it feels like that.

If you could solve one problem in your life to make you feel better what would it be?"
self,fcqt6hd,t3_eiepx8,1577891819.0,"If therapy is not an option, might I recommend a book that has helped me last year called ""Feeling good: the new mood therapy"" by David Burns? It's a book you can actively work with."
self,fcqqoxd,t3_eiiwfe,1577890679.0,I've read this and it sucks to feel this way. You're trying even though it has been very hard for you and that's a lot in my book. You will not always feel this hopeless in my experience. It comes and goes.
AmItheAsshole,fckjask,t3_ehlu8y,1577726569.0,NTA You told him how you felt and I think it was important for you to get this off your chest so you won't ask yourself if you have done all. I think it kind of sucks for him to hear that now after getting over you ...
