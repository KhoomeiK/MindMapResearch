Gretchen the whippet wasn't interested, but Scutter would sit with a pickle chip on his nose and look crosseyed at it until you said 'Go', and he'd whip his head to the side and eat it. He ended up eating about half the jar before all of us got bored. 

Cut to about half an hour later, we're all sitting in the living room, Scutter is lying on his side asleep on the floor... and suddenly he slides about two inches forward, then hops up and runs out of the room. We all look around wondering what that was about... then the Smell hits. And it deserves that capital. 

It became a general rout, my brother actually went out the window because the adults had jammed up the door and I'd fled for the dead-end kitchen (A tactical mistake; none of the windows were escapable and when the Smell started infiltrating I had to run through the cloud for safety. )"

This one I can answer...""People hate water levels in video games."" Look at what happened to  Vashj'ir in Cataclysm. People did it once because it was new, and once they completed it, other than mount farmers it was a ghost town. Same thing happened to the Oculus in Wrath; while the idea of fighting on dragons was neat, adding a new dimension to what had been a 2d game with insufficient support (No way to tell whether you were in range for something, or how close to it you were. bad camera controls that make it incredibly annoying to look up and down but doesn't prevent things from attacking you from those directions. Can't use a lot of abilities that depend on targeting an area because they can only target the ground, etc...)"

I AM type 2 diabetic,and hoping to lose 100#... been on keto for just short of two months and have lost 15 pounds (Couple of setbacks; watch calories as well as macros. :P) but my blood sugar has gone from 250-300 (with a high of 499) to 110-150.
