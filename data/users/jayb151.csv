That said, I also use a Nexus 4 at work and it's perfectly fine for calls. It's sluggish, but it works."

A good action item is like, ""Hey, I'm free friday. Wanna grab a bite and a drink?"" If I'm free, I'd never turn that down. Something like this works well for me because I get to definitively say yes or no. Also, I'm way more talkative in person than through text.

I also hate texting back and forth. My wife has learned that if she needs some back and forth that she has to call me cause I'll ""take too long to respond."""

Piracy,ff9a1vg,t1_ff96sv8,1579708271.0,Is the paid app worth it if I only watch my own movies through Plex. I've also been using the free version for years and have been considering paying. I'm just not sure if get any benefit from the paid version.

HomeImprovement,ff631i1,t1_ff5r7oe,1579617877.0,How was the quality from Ikea. My wife and I went there this weekend and ended up looking at some of their offerings. I'm just not sure about buying my new kitchen from them haha.
beer,ff42yyk,t1_ff3pfqo,1579554409.0,"But my point is that we're getting gouged now. Those beers should be more expensive for sure, but not that expensive. I've seen real price creep in the last decade. So you're right, I don't drink BA beers anymore. 

I've moved on to more about options like 15 packs for $15. That's about the best prices I've seen for craft."
beer,ff3pby0,t1_ff3j9ye,1579545956.0,"Yes, SN had some of the most fair pricing these days. I recently got an ad from my good beer place for some BA beer that was over$20 for a two pack. I just can't justify those prices anymore with a family."
beer,ff3itpg,t1_ff3i2e3,1579541957.0,That's exactly what I'm saying. I think narwal was the first beer that actually made me say it was expensive... That was a $10ish four pack. The price creep of the last decade had been insane.
beer,ff3gaxt,t1_ff3923x,1579540446.0,"Yes, but $15 per 4 pack is still stupid pricing. I was lucky enough to get into craft when you could get the most ridiculous stuff for no more than $12 a six pack. I've since been priced out of the market."
FixMyPrint,ff37kq9,t1_ff322gf,1579535579.0,I was going to agree with you. I used to get this often until I moved my bed farther from the nozzle.
beer,ff36x3g,t1_ff34qub,1579535134.0,Holy shit. $35 per 12 pack!? That's insane pricing.

After seeing how cheap they were and what the guy actually did, I regret it. That and he got solder beads all over the room and used my good towels to clean up the flux. Oh, and he used electrical tape to attach the out tube to a couple pipes.
