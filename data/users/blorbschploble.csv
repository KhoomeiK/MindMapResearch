The hand wavy answer is “the electron is somewhere where it’s motion doesn’t result in emitting radio waves and decay in its orbit, because it literally can’t emit quanta smaller than *h*f, it’s not just falling into the nucleus because that requires having juuuuuuuuust the right energy to do weak force shenanigans with nucleons (that is generally very improbable due to Z and W boson stuff..), and it’s not escaping because it needs some multiple of energy deposited on it by a photon to get kicked out. (Yay photoelectric effect!)”

It’s weird but basically it has to be true or I will fall to the floor into the center of the earth as my electrons give off radio waves until they collapse into protons and turn into neutrons. (The earth would be similarly collapsing)"
explainlikeimfive,ff7hzb3,t1_ff6bkji,1579649989.0,"Way worse than that actually. If you had the equipment to do so, you could try to very precisely measure the location of an electron using a photon with enough energy to make matter-antimatter pairs. One of those could annihilate with the original electron. 

In neutron diffraction, I don’t really think you can “hit” an electron with a neutron, but if you did, it’d be like hitting a fly with a baseball. 

The ultimate version of this is smashing two protons together to try to see their quarks. The energy you put into the system to do that is enough to generate whatever quarks to preserve color charge.

Your first reaction is likely “good thing we’ve gotten our shit together.” We have not, except some of the people some of the time. 

To help simplify your next steps, they all collapse into clinging to Mr. Rogers or diving into Hume. 

After that you get to figure out if Mr. Rogers proves Hume wrong, or if Hume being right necessitates Mr. Rogers. 

If you are lucky you will live long enough to consider this question while masturbating which will then cause the dilemma “if I am sentient enough to consider all of humanity through the lens of justice and morality, why am I masturbating? If I wasn’t sentient though, would this be masturbating, really?”

You will then cum and have 15 seconds of clarity. Then you’ll be haunted by the recognition that if the afterlife is real, Mr. Rogers saw you masturbate, but consoled by the fact he still thinks you are worthy of love. 

Then you’ll remember some kid just got given to another family for basically no reason and scarred the rest of the family, which they could have prevented by masturbating instead of having so many kids. 

Then you’ll wonder if masturbation should be a categorical imperative. 

You will then develop time travel in order to teach humans how to masturbate in the past. Unfortunately, they see you are circumcised and learn the wrong lesson. However, Abraham is about to kill his kid so luckily you tell him not to fucking do that, because what the fuck? You accidentally create Judaism. 

You contemplate your failure but then realize that enshrining a religious prohibition against child sacrifice you have saved millions of kids int the future. 

Time unfolds as it has, but then that family gives away her daughter just as they had before. However the experience left her bitter and jaded and she devoted her whole life working against the ideals of altruism - her name was Ayn Rand.
