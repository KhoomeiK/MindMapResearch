KingdomHearts,fffx5kp,t1_fffwilq,1579893740.0,"The price tag for the limit cut is warranted. I said I'd pay 30 bucks just for that and the extra secret boss. That's in essence what they did with FM+ for 1 and 2, and $30 is still cheaper than having to buy another $60 game, which is what happened with the first two.

The ""Kingdom Hearts version of FFXV Episodes"" is just icing, and honestly, I'd be with you if they chose to release it as a separate DLC, I'd be with you. They did the work to address the criticism, and bundled it in with the Limit Cut that was going to be released anyway. 

Re:Mind is just a free icing on the cake that was supposed to be just limit cut. They messed up. They addressed the criticsms, fixed it, and worked it into the DLC package. 

So if I'm understanding your argument, Re:Mind should have been free, and Limit Cut should be cheaper? Am I getting you right? Because everyone here raves about FM for 1, 2, and BBS, and I guarantee you most fans have purchased them both twice. This model is an improvement on the previous one, and cheaper."

It just needs to be better tuned. BBS did amazing, but it was a solo game. A single campaign with Sora/Riku/Kairi would just be amazing. Don't get me wrong, I love Donald and Goofy as characters, but it gets a little bit tiring on harder difficulties when they spend the whole time dead. 

That's really my biggest criticism of the core games. Your party doesn't mean much at harder difficulties. Their HP bar serves more as a cooldown/random proc for when you can use things like Limits and Combo moves.

KingdomHearts,fffmgyh,t1_fff9ob9,1579887132.0,"I feel like the campaign portion was made off of feedback from the initial launch. The 14 extra super bosses and the reworked combat are more FM+ content. 

So sure, some of that content should have come with the game, but they've put it in now at least, and developing it costs money and time, so it's only fair to pay for it over it being free.

Ask_Politics,fe9qwj3,t1_fe9n5xs,1578940700.0,"So if you remember the concept of a gold standard from school? With how every dollar used to be backed by equal value of gold in the treasury. 

Well gold was too volitile, and caused issues in the economy. Eventually we moved away from this. 

Internationally, most countries will do something similar with the USDollar. Because its considered so stable, its used as an almost universal exchange standard internationally, and their currency is in practice backed by our dollar, which drives its value. 

This phenomenon is why if you look back, the USD lost value in proportion to the share of this market that the Euro took over when it came out. This continues to be the case, and is why in part China's economy is so intertwined in ours. Enough of their working capital is in USD that if it crashed, their ability to buy things on the international market would be hindered, and as would their Yuan. 

With Trump's presidency, it destabilized the relationship of our trade partners. Many now see the US as less reliable, which means our currency is less reliable, because at any time someone could be elected that can tank trade relations because of how our electoral college works. 

As mentioned earlier, it takes about two years before presidential action really starts to show in the economy. You'll see below that the Euro gained a lot relative to the dollar around when Trump got elected, and while the Dollar has been slowly recovering, its still not where it would be. That's partly because people have kinda realized that he's an ineffectual president, among other reasons. 

The upcoming bubble burst resulting in the car loan market (similar to the housing bubble) is going to hurt us us a lot, and Trump isn't doing anything about it.

Part of what made Chao Garden fun was going out and hunting for the shit to feed them. It was an excuse to replay parts of the game with some minigames baked in.

It was good for it's time, but Sonic doesn't have the weight to compete with the gacha games on the market at the moment anymore"

I've found myself skipping more and more songs because I heard them in the morning"
DDlgAdvice,fdtupke,t1_fdtqlsb,1578722508.0,"I know what submission is and means. Consider that maybe I've been in the BDSM scene for a couple decades. 

To do something like that without communication likely means we are early enough in the relationship that I'm still gauging whether I want it to be long term or not. I would not date the kind of person that isn't communicative enough to talk about stuff before it reached that breaking point. 

So yeah, I'm going to choose not to invest any more in a relationship because a red flag that early means other more serious concerns will arise they I'm not interested in dealing with.

Also, don't act like Submission is a one way gift. Ever wonder why there are so many shitty Dom's out there with say no respect for safewords, or are just straight emotionally abusive in trying to hold onto a sub. 

Good Doms are very rare, because good dimming requires you put a part of yourself into it, and quite a bit of work and attention.

You're taking responsibility for another person in their entirety, and it has its own stresses.

Just because you're willing to submit to me, doesn't mean I'm going to give you the privilege of being my sub. That's something earned not just in the short-term, but in the day to day."
DDlgAdvice,fdtp3b2,t1_fdtgezy,1578720020.0,"You talk as if a Dom doesn't take a certain responsibly for their sub and put theirselves into that.

There's agreements that come with a relationship. Taking away Dom privileges is tantamount to holding sex over someone's head to get whAt you want.

That's toxic behavior and I have zero patience for it."

StreetFighter,fdmsjb6,t1_fdmlcby,1578563642.0,I wonder if this is linked to something on Sony's end and whatever underlying infrastructure they use to enable crossplay.
StreetFighter,fdmsg1a,t1_fdm1s57,1578563512.0,"Oof. I wonder if this issue is related to why the fix hasn't been applied and how it's linked to the requirements of Sony/PS4. I'll have to follow this just for sheer curiously sake. 

The unfortunate thing is that this cat is out of the bag, and it clearly gives a huge advantage to the PC player over PS4, and unless patched by Capcom, is forever exploitable.

Or maybe it just forces them to fix their shit."
wow,fdmnhs3,t1_fdmid8n,1578556815.0,"I mean most content RP realms do just fine, it's Mythic that lacks population, which isn't allowed crossrealm. Just allow that and just don't shard them together."
wow,fdmnfsb,t1_fdmjc7n,1578556746.0,"Or just do two realms instead of one. 

There's no need to connect RP servers to the rest of the world. They play the game differently, leave them on their own server."
