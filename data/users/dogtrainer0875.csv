dogs,ffduj02,t3_et2mlg,1579829263.0,"You likely signed a waiver saying they aren’t liable for anything like this. I’ve never known any dog facility that will work with dogs without a waiver of liability. That said, it never hurts to have a polite conversation asking if they can help with vet costs.

The reality of doggy daycare is dogs do and will get hurt. I don’t know your personal doggy daycare, so it is hard to say if this is negligence or a run of the mill injury. 

To be the devils advocate, the doggy daycare staff are not vets. They can give you their personal opinion on if your dog needs medical care, but ultimately that falls on you. That said, it wasn’t appropriate for her to suggest you just put a bandage on it.  They are not dog medical care professionals and any advice from non-vets should be taken with a grain of salt. 

Hope your pup recovers quickly!"

You have to sign that you aren’t sick?! How dare the cruise not want you to start an epidemic!"
dogs,ffdr0mq,t1_ffdqfth,1579826832.0,"There a few possibilities:

1. Boarding can be stressful and pups will sometimes lick compulsively as an outlet for that stress.

2. There may have been cleaners that he was allergic to or they were not properly used. Some cleaners need to dry fully before a dog is exposed  or need to be diluted properly. If the directions aren’t followed for the chemicals, it can cause skin reactions. He may also just have a poor reaction to what they use. 

3. He could have some sort of yeast/other infection in between his paws completely unrelated to boarding and it was just poor timing.

A call to your vet wouldn’t hurt, especially if it seems painful. Hope your sweet pup’s paws are feeling better soon!"

dogs,ff7vfs0,t1_ff7uq1y,1579659295.0,In retrospect I did write my comment hastily as I have many great things to say about Farmina based on research and education (education in canine ethology which included husbandry.) I can see why my comment comes across as using AAFCO as the main standard when searching for food.
dogs,ff7v5n3,t1_ff7uq1y,1579659107.0,I was not implying that this food is great because it is AAFCO. That is just one of the factors to consider when purchasing a food. The unfortunate reality is that there are foods out there that aren’t AAFCO approved. Whether those be in states where it’s not required or purchased online from elsewhere. Foods that don’t meet AAFCO should not be given to your pet so it is something to consider.  That is what I am trying to get across.
dogs,ff7u740,t1_ff7t8fm,1579658462.0,"I do agree that AAFCO is a low standard, but it is not required in all states (if OP is in the US) to be sold on the shelf.

They do have grain free kibble, but I tend to go for the ones that have grain due to recent studies (showing correlation, not causation, between gluten free diets and heart disease in dogs. Not specifically tested on this brand). 

We did  a ton of research before picking a brand and settled on this one because of the quality. Only downfall is it’s a bit pricey!

Edit: I meant to only write grain free, not gluten free! I have my own human medical conditions where I’m always using the phrase gluten free!"

Dogtraining,ff556fq,t3_ermzwi,1579580543.0,"Hello! Professional trainer with education in dog ethology/training as well!

Dogs that tend to be “neurotic” are often working breed dogs that are being asked to fit in a non-working environment. Think German short haired pointers, black mouth curs, old English sheepdogs, border collies, etc. This 100% does not mean those breeds are always going to be neurotic, but they have typically been bred to hunt or herd and this can lead to them always being “on.” The closer they are to the working generation, the more likely they will have that high drive.  As with any breed stereotype, you can never assume the dog will carry certain characteristics, it is simply a guideline.

It does sound like you like dogs that are able to be active and participate in training though. I would highly recommend a mixed breed. I think you would be really pleased going with a poodle mix (maybe lab/golden, there are too many poodle mixes to list though!!). These dogs are typical of a decent size, able to keep up with physical activity and truly enjoy training. 

If you are going with a breeder, check that they are breeding for temperament and not appearance. If you go for a shelter rescue, let  the rescue know what you hope to do with the dog. They may even recommend a breed mix you hadn’t thought of if the dog fits what you desire! Best of luck in picking your future pup!!"

BeachbodyHunSnark,ff29jjz,t1_ff28mh6,1579497829.0,It depends on what ward she is in.  There is usually a cushioned bench seat that can be used as a bed and often a reclining chair that can be used as well.
Dogtraining,ff1az8j,t3_emz939,1579476959.0,"Dog trainer here and I personally never advocate for owners to take their dog to the dog park. Breed completely set aside, there are many risks. You can have an incredibly well socialized dog that loves engaging with other dogs, but unfortunately people do not have appropriate discretion at times. People will bring dogs that are dog aggressive/too young/in heat and it can create an unsafe environment. This environment can even negatively impact dogs that typically enjoy playing. People are not responsible with the dogs they bring to the park and it makes it unsafe. 

As much as it sucks, some (most) dogs are not dog park dogs. You may need to be creative with physical activity. Think hikes/training classes/fetch/tug. If you are in an apartment and really need somewhere to exercise your pup, go to a dog park very early or very late so there are less chances of other dogs. 

If you want to have your dog meet another dog, I highly recommend enrolling a positive reinforcement trainer. They typically can bring a dog that will be suitable for the interaction and can teach you how to do this safely moving forward. Even if you can only afford one session, the skills of being able to safely greet dogs will benefit you immensely!"

Dogs definitely need something in the crate as most are just hard plastic/metal. If her crate is too big, then you may want to look into a smaller crate because she will likely keep peeing in their. 

Another factor is she is a young dog and a small breed. She may need you to set alarms to wake up at night to take her out. EVERY time she potties outside give her treats (carry them outside with you) and praise her. When she pees in her crate, don’t scold her.
