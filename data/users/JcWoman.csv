He would sometimes get cranky from the extreme repetition of the experiments (because she was trying to get enough statistical data to satisfy the scientific community).  The time she describes, he was tired of working and wanted to eat.  He would say ""nut"" asking for a nut to eat.  She said ""later, let's finish this"" and asked him what color (or number, whatever).  He said ""nut"".  She said ""not now, Alex.  what color?""  They went on like this a few times with him becoming increasingly demanding and refusing to answer her question.  Then when he got fed up with her, he said ""nnn uhh ttt"" (phonetically spelling the word nut).  She commented in her layman's book that it felt like he had decided she was just too stupid to understand so was condescending to help her.  Even if he wasn't THAT smart as to understand the concept of condescension, the fact that he phonetically spelled the word was amazing.  (She did not teach him to spell or phonetics.

dogs,ffrm8as,t3_eupvat,1580160944.0,"I witnessed an interesting difference based on upbringing of the same breed when I was on the board of a couple greyhound groups.  I have retired racers and adore them.  In the USA they have a very regimented upbringing from early life to race training.  The only training they get is to run as fast as they can and follow the lure around the track.  Everything else in their life is being shown what to do on a regular schedule.  They never have to think for themselves.  So when they retire to pet life at first they don't know what to do.  Some adopters have reported bringing their new dog home and it just stands in the middle of the room.  He's not dumb, he suddenly just has freedom to do what he wants and he's never had that before.  It takes some adjusting.  

I also saw it with my own dogs.  I would often sit on the couch with my feet on the coffee table.  If my beloved Capri wanted to be on the other side of the couch next to me (instead of the side she's already on), she would step up so her chest is against my legs and whine and look puzzled.  I would tell her ""go around"" with a big arm wave to indicate walking around the table.  She never really ""got it"", but would eventually give up on me moving my legs and wander around the table.  I also had to teach her that she could step or jump over fallen logs when walking on forest trails.  The smallest things are obstacles.  (Which I love as you can keep a greyhound confined to a room simply by *leaning* a baby gate against the door, lol!)  They are entirely capable of jumping over things but it generally doesn't occur to them that they can.  So they don't.

By contrast, when I was working with retired galgos I saw the other side.  Galgos are greyhounds used for hunting live hare in Spain, by turning them loose in fields.  They're also terribly neglected (and worse, but I won't get into that).  As a result, they learn to fend for themselves at an early age and throughout their lives and are problem-solvers extraordinaire.  Galgos will easily and without hesitation jump a 5-foot fence.  If they want something, they will go over, under or around to get it.  I had a foster galgo for a little while and while walking him in our neighborhood one day we saw a rabbit in someone's yard.  I wouldn't let him go after it, although he really, really wanted to.  When we got home he wanted out in our back yard and like a silly goat, I let him out.  He immediately jumped our 4-foot fence and went off directly (as the crow flies, instead of around the block retracing our steps) to get that rabbit.

A friend who has more experience than I do working with both likes to say that racing greyhounds are two-dimensional thinkers but galgos think in three dimensions.  I think she has a good point."

I should clarify my OP because I think your #1 and another poster got an inaccurate view of what my issue was with talking to the clients.  I am allowed to talk to them to gather requirements.  The problem I have is that when I'm new, my managers expected me to learn the system from the developers and QA people and not from the clients.  The problem with this approach being that it gives me the developer's and QA's perspective on how the software should be used.  It doesn't give me any idea of how the clients actually use it or what their pain points are.  I explained this to a previous manager and she didn't care.  She was also the one who told me not to talk to our client-facing customer service team to see what kind of issues the clients call in with, either.
