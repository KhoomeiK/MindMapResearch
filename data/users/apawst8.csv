In hockey, football, and basketball, there are very serious penalties for leaving the bench to fight. (Much more serious than just fighting if you're in the game). But not in baseball. In baseball, the benches are expected to clear. But there's a good reason for that. 

In all other sports, there's an even number of player from each team on the field. In baseball, it's 9 vs 1 (to 4). So the team at bat has to leave to ensure that the opponent doesn't gang up on the batting team. That leads to the defensive team clearing."

todayilearned,ff4e838,t1_ff43jkg,1579561515.0,">Why are you comparing age? 

Comparing by age is 100% standard. See below

>Ovie missed the entire 04-05 season due to the lockout so he didn't even make his NHL debut until he was 20. 

I'm using the Hockey reference age, which is on February 1 of a season and thus considers Gretzky's first season to be at age 19 (even though he actually debuted at age 18). So Gretzky only has one year up on Ovi.

>Gretzky played 20 seasons. If Ovi stays healthy, he will pass Gretzky on goals. Period.

That's a big ""if"" and is why people of different eras are compared by age. Many all time great players stop being productive in their late 30s. So assuming Ovi will be healthy and productive at age 38 is far from a sure thing. 

Look at who Ovi recently tied, Yzerman. Yzerman never scored more than 20 in a season after his age 34 season. Messier never scored more than 30 after age 37. Dionne and Esposito both scored 7 in their age 38 season and retired.
