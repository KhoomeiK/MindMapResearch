RandomActsofCards,ff82yg3,t1_ff82kt5,1579664601.0,"Thanks! He had urinary blockage. They gave him pain meds and subq fluids which helped him relax and pee. He's peeing normally now. It seems like the blockage was caused by stress (likely jealousy of another one of our cats, a really shy one that has been coming out for company more often lately). We ordered feliway, and he's also on a new prescription diet which he'll have to stay on long term."

MorbidPodcast,ff5i22b,t3_erazcx,1579593830.0,"I think that Bryce originally was going home to confront his parents. I've read some stuff about their complicated relationship. I think something happened during one of the phone conversations they had, something we don't know, and he decided it would be best to not go back home and then he was trying to figure out what to do next or waiting for someone to leave with. Obviously this is speculation. I mainly just think that there's more to the story than what the parents are choosing to share."
