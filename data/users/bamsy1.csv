offmychest,ff38pgx,t1_ff1uwqn,1579536331.0,I don't think it will ever get better though. I will have my mental illness for the rest of my life. My quailty of life is always going to be like this. I lost the only person that supproted me and thats all on me. I really don't know how to cope with it
depression,ff1n3ba,t1_ff1myq4,1579481920.0,I wouldn't say it was an open relationship but I was kinda flirting with other guys. I don't think he was
offmychest,ff1md89,t1_ff1m5dp,1579481569.0,I really am alone though. I lost the person I love most in this world and it's all my fault. I've called the hotlines. I've done the treatment programs and none of them have helped
depression,ff1l8of,t1_ff1kkyd,1579480995.0,"Basically the TL;DR is that me and my ex, whom i love very much, started dating but it wasn't exclusive. I thought I enjoyed the freedom more than i would be committed. I told him that. He got upset. I later realized that wasn't the case and it was my mental illness speaking, asked if we could talk. We did. He's still very upset with me, understandably, and basically thinks i don't love him and doesn't want to hear from me"

TopMindsOfReddit,febhf3n,t3_eo0p09,1578958805.0,"Me and my parents are on opposite ends of the political spectrum. Despite always picking fights with me, they've never use me needing support as a way to get me to vote how they wanted. I'm so glad that they never pulled shit like this and remained supportive of me.

Edit: spelling"

wow,fcphbv6,t3_eiezfd,1577864070.0,"I'm sorta/kinda new too (been playing since about june) so I might be wrong with some of this. WoWhead helps a LOT, always check the comments on the main posts about quests as there will be very helpful info on the best way to travel to certian location, where good gear drops, where you can find rares, etc. etc. 

If you're having trouble finding quests check the adventure guide tab. Sometimes my quests will randomly untrack but I still have them so they might be the problem. Also look at the boards for quests although most of the time you'll find a quest in a zone that tells you to help someone out in another zone. If not, just go to the next zone on the map, just make sure you're at the right level for it. 

As for leveling, its mainly questing until you can do dungeons and battlegrounds (although I'd wait a lil bit to do PvP stuff, battlegrounds are a fast way to level and once you turn warmode on you get 10% experience gain on kills which is nice). I'd also pick up herbalism and mining as they give you a little xp that adds up overtime. 

But honestly WoWhead is your best friend."
