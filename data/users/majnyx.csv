RoleReversal,ffgsxuk,t3_etb1sz,1579914249.0,I have recently discovered the purr-worthy aspects of a man washing and then brushing my hair. I might be subconsciously growing it out just for that.
korea,ffghjl0,t3_etcii0,1579906377.0,And it's going on the list for new adventures!
teachinginkorea,ffatjc0,t3_eslo5c,1579744148.0,"Whose website? MOE and Immigration don't care and they issue your visa. If a hagwon is demanding that kind of history, move along!"
RoleReversal,ffan5n6,t3_esejcu,1579739868.0,I wanna know her dietary regimen. I want lats like that!!
teachinginkorea,ff7jp09,t1_ff7j2fc,1579651147.0,"Like I said before, the first I ever heard about this was from my friend getting a run-around from recruiters. Her problem pops up in that she's an American with an undergrad from Texas Women's and a Master's from U of Edinburgh (yeah, the one in Scotland). Thus, her Master's transcripts are a bit of a hassle and VERY expensive to obtain."
teachinginkorea,ff7hcpi,t1_ff7agcc,1579649571.0,Present the to whom? That's what confuses me. Who is actually asking for them? Shouldn't your apostilled diploma as required by MOE and Immigration prove all that?
teachinginkorea,ff6x6nr,t3_errmf3,1579636728.0,"Did anyone give you a run-around about supplying transcripts, too? A friend of mine is looking to come to Korea for the first time and said most recruiters were bumbling about sealed transcripts. I didn't need them when accepting a new contract with a previous employer this spring, so I'm confused where this transcripts thing started."

Reminds me of the baby bear that found its way into a dog shelter and had a wonderful day until someone realized it wasn't a fluffy mix."

UpliftingNews,ff2d5bd,t3_er5poe,1579501355.0,Phasing their way out of brutality in Hong Kong would be much more appropriated.
bigbang,ferp47v,t1_fer4ef5,1579356736.0,I know. I saw the original post on Reddit. Your repost is making me petty.
korea,feroyxn,t1_fepyql0,1579356679.0,Good for you! I wish y'all a wonderful New Year!
