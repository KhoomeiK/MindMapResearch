CozyPlaces,fes39yz,t1_ferx0t9,1579360959.0,Oh of course. I actually love super distinctive mid century designs; however the feeling of them being “dated” reminds me of the passage of time and our ultimate demise.

spicy,fds7ck6,t3_emw8t5,1578696002.0,"Welcome!!! Chohula’s chipotle has AMAZING flavor. Fully approve. If you’re looking for more flavors in the same relative heat range, definitely try adding sriracha to your food, and anything at the grocery store in the mango/habanero family. Habanero itself can be quite hot but I’ve found that grocery store habeneros (especially mango/fruit paired ones) aren’t too punchy. You might also like adding fresh serranos to salads."

AdviceAnimals,fdh0z60,t1_fdg0mqc,1578413009.0,"I have uncommon name that people have heard a lot but not seen spelled a lot - think tv shows and movies. It also has two digraphs in it; two sets of two letters that make a different sound than the individuals. Like “th” and “ch.” The number of times people have pronounced my name phonetically without the digraph (which are common!!!) is appalling to me. Like they’ll go “Hello, is there a step-Hen here? Step-hen? Steep-heen” and when I respond...it’s pronounced “Steven” they are literally stunned. It’s weird how people hear and see things like names so differently."
