AskReddit,ffnfmnn,t1_ffmina7,1580065338.0,"For starters, I'm just a random guy on the internet, so please don't read too much into my answer.

Anyway, here's my worthless 2 cents: I think it's fine to tell them, for several reasons.

1. If it's not much of an issue in your daily life, chances are that it's not much of an issue in your worklife either, including during speeches. I mean, everybody stops and searches for words from time to time, especially in a technical domain; indeed even in your case, chances are that half the times you do it, it's for other reasons than your aphasia. 
2. If you do have a problem with it during the interview, or afterwards as part of your job, they'll think ""oh there it is"" instead of ""this guy doesn't know what he's talking about"". 
3. You probably don't want to work for people who will judge you more harshly for having aphasia than for struggling to find your words.

So maybe you don't want to volunteer the information unless you have a problem with aphasia during the interview. But if you do, then chances are it's best to explain it than to just seem unexplainably strange to the interviewer. And it can make a fine answer to the question ""what's your weakness"": ""I take this medication that leaves me unaffected in terms of productivity etc., except for one thing, occasionally it's hard to find a word. That can be annoying for powerpoint presentations.""

Besides, I wanted to clarify one thing. I think saying ""I'm terrible at public speaking"" is sometimes a bad answer to the question ""what's your weakness"". That doesn't mean it's always a bad answer; it depends on the position. Furthermore, in the cases where it's a bad answer, it's not just because it mean you can't speak well in public; it's also because it might suggest that your personality is not compatible with the job. For instance, it might suggest that you're socially anxious, or that you've got an avoidant personality, or that you can't handle stress (even though the reason why most people are bad at public speaking is just that they haven't done it a lot.)

I don't think it's in any way worse or more of a betrayal than when it's a man doing it... though of course that depends on the cultural expectations and gender roles wherever you live. But myself I would consider both these things to be equally sexual assault and equally bad, because I don't view women as having an inherent responsibility to be kind to or protect one-another that differs from anybody's inherent responsibility to be kind or protect anybody else.

TwoXChromosomes,fff0gan,t3_et1e9b,1579872227.0,">There’s plenty of people who know of my rape at the age of 13 and call  me out when I indicate that I lost my virginity at 18 when talking to my  kids about abstinence or just in general. Even when talking about my  first sexual experience they say things like “But, you weren’t a  virgin”, “He wasn’t your first”, “Weren’t you raped at 13?”.

Are you sure they are calling you out, or are they just being confused, and you're interpreting that as them calling you out?

If it's the former maybe you should not be talking about anything sexual with these people, and you shouldn't consider them friends. But it seems plausible to me that it's the latter, and perhaps there's a misunderstanding or a misrepresentation going on here (how comes there's ""plenty of people"" who overhear you giving your kids ""the talk""?).

Most people understand the term virginity to mean the first time you are involved in something sexual - and most people include rape in that. It's not a value judgment, just pure semantics (losing one's virginity doesn't need to be a positive experience \*by definition\*; in fact in the case where it is consensual it is not always positive, not that I would compare that to rape). If you use the term ""virginity"" in a different sense, it might confuse some people, and if they're polite when asking you to clarify on such a difficult topic, then that seems okay to me."

Sure, to be a heavyweight boxer it helps to be over 5 feet tall and you can't learn that. To get a nobel prize it helps to have an IQ over 110, and you (mostly) can't learn that. But what really matters, besides hard work, is not so much your innate talent as your motivation.

Put in 4 hours of hard work when you're not motivated, when you're thinking of something else... that's only worth 1 hour of hard work from somebody who is doing the same things outwardly but for whom, inwardly, that work is the meaning of their life; their whole being is focused on getting better; every tiny step towards mastery fills them with genuine joy, and not because that means they don't have to work extra, but simply for the sake of having gotten better.

I doubt  that the main reason for the misinformation is bias or malevolence (though that probably also plays a part). Rather, the main issue is that it's not a neat narrative. It would have made sense if she had been an activist who planned the protest, or if she had been a non-activist who improvised it. But reality is not that simple, so people end up with either of the simpler narratives.

Most people, I believe, see Rosa Parks as being an older lady who took a stance right there, on the spot, not because of a lifelong commitment to a cause but because of a belief in her own dignity. It's relatable, picturesque, it works. It could be you, if you have the guts. And yet it leads to an obviously unfair judicial fight - the lady who wouldn't give up her seat vs. the state; David vs. Goliath.

Her being a trained activist undermines that story a little, suggests there is ""more to it"". And her planning the protest would also undermine that story; so opponents to civil rights and racial equality would most likely support that narrative instead (activist+planned), taking advantage of the truth that she was an activist in order to promote the falsehood that she ""staged"" the whole thing.

philosophy,fexr1ro,t1_fex6wcd,1579434986.0,">I get what you're getting at in that there may be such problems that owing to their complexity, it may be meaningless if they are considered black boxes or not.

What I mean is that it's not clear whether that's the case for neural network. I mentioned ""disentangling representations"", which is considered an important goal in current deep learning research - but it's an almost philosophical goal, as it's not exactly clear what we really want out of this (presumably the most obvious meaning is that, on each layer of the network, different nodes correspond to independent predicting factors of variation in the input relative to the output, something like that).

If we could do that, the whole neural network would (sort of) resemble one of these directed graphs where each node has a more or less interpretable meaning.

Whether that's achievable without sacrificing performance is unclear. In the human brain (100 billion neurons, 100 trillion connections) it's not clear that something like that is happening - that there are for instance ""grandmother neurons"", a neuron coding for a single person, a single neuron that activates whenever you think of your grandmother and not for anybody else.

Anyway, what I was getting at is that to answer these questions - whether that's achievable, and how so - a big part of the work is making sure we're asking the question right. Saying that we want the network reduced to a sequence of ifs-thens does not actually express what we really want to do, for the simple reason that this is already achievable in a trivial, uninteresting way.

One might say instead, perhaps, that the length of this sequence of if-then should be as close as possible to the complexity of the sample in bits? Or some measure of bits weighted by the corresponding performance increase. But I don't know enough information theory to say for sure, and perhaps yet another completely different approach is needed.

For many of the same reasons why people are *naturally* chauvinistic, and have to be educated into not being so.

Why? Because it's easier to find correlations with surface features than with ""deep"", complex ones. So skin color or gender will typically be used instead of, say, ""had a rough childhood"", if only because the former are much easier to detect. Stats actually show that people with one origin or another are more likely to commit crimes than people with some other origin; an AI would figure that out, and it would start discriminating against people with the first origin, thereby committing an injustice against those of them (likely the vast majority) who are not criminals, and likely contributing to the perpetuation of the statistical difference by pushing down a particular category of people as a whole. The less data you have, the more this will happen; but with current AI techniques, which are not very data efficient, it will happen even with a lot more data than the average person ever witnesses.

How do human societies deal with that? They go beyond just being objective. They actively try to not discriminate based on certain factors, including race, gender, etc., in order to force themselves to judge based on ""deep features"" (the content of one's character) rather than ""shallow ones"" (the color of one's skin). There is no reason why similar things can't be achieved with AI (essentially just figuring out those shallow predictive factors, then subtracting their effects from the outcome), but it requires being aware that just causal inference on its own, without a human intervention to promote certain kinds of justice, will lead to levels of discrimination that we will consider unfair and unacceptable.

Of course this sheds light on something we perhaps don't want to grapple with - that there's something very logical and practical about a lot of discriminatory practices. It saves time and energy to judge people based on shallow features, and it usually works better to combine shallow and deep features than to just use the deep ones - meaning you typically get the best/lowest error rate by discriminating. Indeed, if we were to apply the same anti-discriminatory principles to all shallow features - not just skin color and gender, but height, attractiveness, accent, haircut, etc. - we'd likely see a drastic drop in how efficient we are at understanding each other, including in predicting performance when we're hiring somebody...

...

D'autre part, la généralisation que je fais est très vraisemblable, alors que celle du titre est très invraisemblable si on la comprend au niveau mondial: la Sibérie, l'Amazonie, les grandes forêts canadiennes ne sont très vraisemblablement quasiment pas touchées par ce phénomène, et les jungles d'Afriques et d'Asie sont vraisemblablement moins touchées. Si bien qu'en faisant la somme au niveau mondial, le chiffre de 67% en une décennie devient complètement invraisemblable. C'est pour ca que j'ai tiqué sur ce point en particulier - le chiffre m'est immédiatement apparu comme impossible.

Le problème c'est que, outre l'insulte faite à la vérité, les économistes qui l'ont entendu vont aller répéter ca autour d'eux et quelqu'un leur répondra ""ce que vous dites c'est des fake news, les écolos, vous êtes alarmistes et vous racontez n'importe quoi, d'ailleurs cette étude montre qu'en Amazonie la perte de biomasse d'arthropode n'est que de 3% sur 20 ans ^(dans les zones sans incendies)"".

HistoryMemes,fdnjdef,t1_fdn35wd,1578587036.0,"> And confiscating all food is not an accident wtf? 

I addressed that in my original comment:

>The intentional/criminal part, which have resulted in many calling the Holodomor a genocide, is that Ukraine was made to bear the brunt of it (though there were also millions of death in other regions).

Expanding on it:

Confiscating food from farmers was done to relieve famine elsewhere. Doing this led to the deaths by famine of those from whom grain was confiscated, in a way that was expected by the soviet regime - and thus murderous in nature. Hence why I called that the ""intentional/criminal part"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor_genocide_question

Whether or not the holodomor can be called a genocide (honestly I think this debate is as much about the exact definition of ""genocide"" as it is about historical facts), it is clear that - 

1. It is a crime of immense proportions.
2. It does not resemble the holocaust very much, since the latter was done for the sole sake of entirely exterminating certain ethnic groups, absent any external cause."
HistoryMemes,fdn1z6l,t1_fdmrfcm,1578574851.0,"That's an incorrect comparison in several ways. Firstly you're overestimating the casualties for the holodomor. Secondly you're comparing things that aren't really comparable.

Stalin's holodomor was only partly intentional (it was the result of failed policies that led to USSR-wide starvation). The intentional/criminal part, which have resulted in many calling the Holodomor a genocide, is that Ukraine was made to bear the brunt of it (though there were also millions of death in other regions).

Meanwhile Hitler went on an entirely intentional campaign of mass killing, and I don't think it makes any sense to exclude military deaths from his total as you have done. So you should also include military casualties from Hitler's wars of invasion and genocide, which number about 20 extra millions, for a grand total of about 35 millions.

By comparison, Stalin's total reaches (for the duration of his stay in power) about 10-12 million by the latest estimates, including famines and the gulag. (Shockingly to me, the death total for the gulag has been massively downgraded by historians in the last 3 decades. Cold war estimates used to be to the tune of 20 million, but recent ones are 90% lower. Though don't get me wrong. Killing 2 million people is still is a pretty big deal.)"

>The poor masses always foot the bill and pay the ultimate cost while those in power stay safe and get away with war crimes.

Those who pay the ultimate cost are mostly the foreign civilians. The masses in the US foot the bill mostly via their taxes. Some risk their lives - those who want to can join up in the military to actively participate in the whole thing for pay, and at home they are treated like heroes.

Of course, the reason people join the US military and are treated like heroes is not that Americans are inherently worse than anybody else. It's due to the incredible amount of US propaganda that the whole nation (and much of the rest of the world) is constantly being sprinkled with. We've already seen that in the last few days on websites like reddit, imgur, twitter, etc - lots of people getting excited about the war, amping the us and them rhetoric, etc. But also day in day out there's the rewriting of history at hollywood (despite all their anti-war speeches at the golden globes and whatnot) and in TV series and in the general media, the biased reporting on the middle east and about US military operations, etc.

Look at the Ghallager story. Despite the overwhelming amount of evidence that this guy was 100% a psychopath, the type of extreme psychopath that tortures animals for fun and becomes a serial killer, he was only condemned for the one event in which he poses with the body of a teenager he murdered.

A teenage girl from the countryside, genuinely very religious, perhaps a bit crazy, ""hears"" a message from God: she is to go to war, to stop a war that ended up lasting (intermittently) for more than a century, and that had led (among all other sorts of violence and suffering) to her own village being raided by marauders. This little teenager wore armor and led rough violent men into brutal battles. Was captured, was abandoned by all, and condemned to be burned alive by the English in a rigged trial, with the help of corrupt priests, in the hope that she would renege herself and her actions... But even in that dramatic end she never wavered in her convictions.
2. Her historical importance is actually pretty big. She played a major role in the 100 years war by helping the French wannabe king getting coronated before the English alternative, thus giving him more legitimacy. She participated in the birth of a national sentiment in France. And she played a decivise role in a war won by France, that contributed to send the UK into a long civil war, and which shaped both countries for centuries to come as they competed for world domination.

Now of course it's possible to overstate her role or to excessively romanticize her story. True, she did not grow up in poverty (though she was not noble born either); true, she was not the only woman who made weird religious claims, nor the only one who was used by clever men as a means to increase the motivation of the troops. True, there were many, many other factors that were decisive in the final outcome of the 100 years war. But more often than not, in France, people underestimate rather than overestimate the role Jeanne d'Arc, probably in no small part because the story just seems too crazy to be true."

OP suggests that the malagasy Eupleridae *independently* evolved to have vertical pupils, retractable claws, whiskers, and to ""behave like a feline"" whatever that means, while failing to provide a source for any of that besides a wikipedia page that doesn't say that. OP provides no evidence that this took place independently from the evolution of these features in some felines.

Now I'm not a specialist myself. But if we look at other animals from the feliforma family (to which both eupleridae and felidae belong), others that are not felines (and don't live on Madagascar) have some of these features, or conversely there are felines that don't have these features. For instance meerkats have whiskers, lions have circular pupils, viverrids have semi-retractable claws and verticular pupils, etc.

All in all there's not that much suggesting convergent evolution. Rather it seems to me that the eupleridae are simply evolutionary close to cats. And that's why they look like cats. Other members of feliforma all around the world also look like cats even though they're not felidae, for instance [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Indian_civet) (who lives in India, where there are cats, but who is more closely related to mongooses).

I doubt  that the main reason for the misinformation is bias or malevolence (though that probably also plays a part). Rather, the main issue is that it's not a neat narrative. It would have made sense if she had been an activist who planned the protest, or if she had been a non-activist who improvised it. But reality is not that simple, so people end up with either of the simpler narratives.

Most people, I believe, see Rosa Parks as being an older lady who took a stance right there, on the spot, not because of a lifelong commitment to a cause but because of a belief in her own dignity. It's relatable, picturesque, it works. It could be you, if you have the guts. And yet it leads to an obviously unfair judicial fight - the lady who wouldn't give up her seat vs. the state; David vs. Goliath.

Her being a trained activist undermines that story a little, suggests there is ""more to it"". And her planning the protest would also undermine that story; so opponents to civil rights and racial equality would most likely support that narrative instead (activist+planned), taking advantage of the truth that she was an activist in order to promote the falsehood that she ""staged"" the whole thing. Alternatively, people who support civil rights activism might also propagate the myth that she was an activist who planned it in advance, in order to promote the value of being pro-active/direct action, as opposed to waiting for opportunities to improvise something."
philosophy,fexr1ro,t1_fex6wcd,1579434986.0,">I get what you're getting at in that there may be such problems that owing to their complexity, it may be meaningless if they are considered black boxes or not.

What I mean is that it's not clear whether that's the case for neural network. I mentioned ""disentangling representations"", which is considered an important goal in current deep learning research - but it's an almost philosophical goal, as it's not exactly clear what we really want out of this (presumably the most obvious meaning is that, on each layer of the network, different nodes correspond to independent predicting factors of variation in the input relative to the output, something like that).

If we could do that, the whole neural network would (sort of) resemble one of these directed graphs where each node has a more or less interpretable meaning.

Whether that's achievable without sacrificing performance is unclear. In the human brain (100 billion neurons, 100 trillion connections) it's not clear that something like that is happening - that there are for instance ""grandmother neurons"", a neuron coding for a single person, a single neuron that activates whenever you think of your grandmother and not for anybody else.

Anyway, what I was getting at is that to answer these questions - whether that's achievable, and how so - a big part of the work is making sure we're asking the question right. Saying that we want the network reduced to a sequence of ifs-thens does not actually express what we really want to do, for the simple reason that this is already achievable in a trivial, uninteresting way.

One might say instead, perhaps, that the length of this sequence of if-then should be as close as possible to the complexity of the sample in bits? Or some measure of bits weighted by the corresponding performance increase. But I don't know enough information theory to say for sure, and perhaps yet another completely different approach is needed.

My point being - we can't do philosophy on this stuff without having a decent grasp of the underlying science and technology. Once we've got that we will be able to ask the right questions."

I'm being a bit pedantic here admittedly. I think I know what you mean. But I think this si a serious issue with your question, both from the philosophical and AI perspective.

philosophy,fdzp2xg,t1_fdx6bs6,1578792665.0,"If you were to feed an AI with ""objective"" data (to the extent that this means anything), and have it judge people... it would turn out unacceptably racist, sexist, whatever-ist. For many of the same reasons why people are *naturally* chauvinistic, and have to be educated into not being so.

Why? Because it's easier to find correlations with surface features than with ""deep"", complex ones. So skin color or gender will typically be used instead of, say, ""had a rough childhood"", if only because the former are much easier to detect. Stats actually show that people with one origin or another are more likely to commit crimes than people with some other origin; an AI would figure that out, and it would start discriminating against people with the first origin, thereby committing an injustice against those of them (likely the vast majority) who are not criminals, and likely contributing to the perpetuation of the statistical difference by pushing down a particular category of people as a whole. The less data you have, the more this will happen; but with current AI techniques, which are not very data efficient, it will happen even with a lot more data than the average person ever witnesses.

How do human societies deal with that? They go beyond just being objective. They actively try to not discriminate based on certain factors, including race, gender, etc., in order to force themselves to judge based on ""deep features"" (the content of one's character) rather than ""shallow ones"" (the color of one's skin). There is no reason why similar things can't be achieved with AI (essentially just figuring out those shallow predictive factors, then subtracting their effects from the outcome), but it requires being aware that just causal inference on its own, without a human intervention to promote certain kinds of justice, will lead to levels of discrimination that we will consider unfair and unacceptable.

Of course this sheds light on something we perhaps don't want to grapple with - that there's something very logical and practical about a lot of discriminatory practices. It saves time and energy to judge people based on shallow features, and it usually works better to combine shallow and deep features than to just use the deep ones - meaning you typically get the best/lowest error rate by discriminating. Indeed, if we were to apply the same anti-discriminatory principles to all shallow features - not just skin color and gender, but height, attractiveness, accent, haircut, etc. - we'd likely see a drastic drop in how efficient we are at understanding each other, including in predicting performance when we're hiring somebody...

... Still, it feels more fair that a person cumulating all these bad shallow features (imagine quasimodo with a few extra quirks) should be given the same chance at being CEO than another cumulating all good shallow features (imagine Henry Cavil, pretty much), if their track record is otherwise identical on paper."

I addressed that in my original comment:

>The intentional/criminal part, which have resulted in many calling the Holodomor a genocide, is that Ukraine was made to bear the brunt of it (though there were also millions of death in other regions).

Expanding on it:

Confiscating food from farmers was done to relieve famine elsewhere. Doing this led to the deaths by famine of those from whom grain was confiscated, in a way that was expected by the soviet regime - and thus murderous in nature. Hence why I called that the ""intentional/criminal part"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor_genocide_question

Whether or not the holodomor can be called a genocide (honestly I think this debate is as much about the exact definition of ""genocide"" as it is about historical facts), it is clear that - 

1. It is a crime of immense proportions.
2. It does not resemble the holocaust very much, since the latter was done for the sole sake of entirely exterminating certain ethnic groups, absent any external cause."
HistoryMemes,fdn1z6l,t1_fdmrfcm,1578574851.0,"That's an incorrect comparison in several ways. Firstly you're overestimating the casualties for the holodomor. Secondly you're comparing things that aren't really comparable.

Stalin's holodomor was only partly intentional (it was the result of failed policies that led to USSR-wide starvation). The intentional/criminal part, which have resulted in many calling the Holodomor a genocide, is that Ukraine was made to bear the brunt of it (though there were also millions of death in other regions).

Meanwhile Hitler went on an entirely intentional campaign of mass killing, and I don't think it makes any sense to exclude military deaths from his total as you have done. So you should also include military casualties from Hitler's wars of invasion and genocide, which number about 20 extra millions, for a grand total of about 35 millions.

By comparison, Stalin's total reaches (for the duration of his stay in power) about 10-12 million by the latest estimates, including famines and the gulag. (Shockingly to me, the death total for the gulag has been massively downgraded by historians in the last 3 decades. Cold war estimates used to be to the tune of 20 million, but recent ones are 90% lower. Though don't get me wrong. Killing 2 million people is still is a pretty big deal.)"

Those who pay the ultimate cost are mostly the foreign civilians. The masses in the US foot the bill mostly via their taxes. Some risk their lives - those who want to can join up in the military to actively participate in the whole thing for pay, and at home they are treated like heroes.

Of course, the reason people join the US military and are treated like heroes is not that Americans are inherently worse than anybody else. It's due to the incredible amount of US propaganda that the whole nation (and much of the rest of the world) is constantly being sprinkled with. We've already seen that in the last few days on websites like reddit, imgur, twitter, etc - lots of people getting excited about the war, amping the us and them rhetoric, etc. But also day in day out there's the rewriting of history at hollywood (despite all their anti-war speeches at the golden globes and whatnot) and in TV series and in the general media, the biased reporting on the middle east and about US military operations, etc.

This little teenager wore armor and led rough violent men into brutal battles. Was captured, was abandoned by all, and condemned to be burned alive by the English in a rigged trial, with the help of corrupt priests, in the hope that she would renege herself and her actions... But even in that dramatic end she never wavered in her convictions.
2. Her historical importance is actually pretty big. She played a major role in the 100 years war by helping the French wannabe king getting coronated before the English alternative, thus giving him more legitimacy. She participated in the birth of a national sentiment in France. And she played a decivise role in a war won by France, that contributed to send the UK into a long civil war, and which shaped both countries for centuries to come as they competed for world domination.

Now of course it's possible to overstate her role or to excessively romanticize her story. True, she did not grow up in poverty (though she was not noble born either); true, she was not the only woman who made weird religious claims, nor the only one who was used by clever men as a means to increase the motivation of the troops. True, there were many, many other factors that were decisive in the final outcome of the 100 years war.

todayilearned,fchvuwt,t1_fcftxrg,1577654744.0,"OP hasn't shown that this is convergent evolution though. Eupleridae are closely related to cats so it's just as likely that they both inherited these features (retractile claws, whiskers, vertical pupils...) from a common ancestor, contrary to OP's unsourced claim.

Look up viverrids - look kinda like cats, have all the aforementioned features, except they don't live in Madagascar. Instead they live in environments which they share with various felines (e.g. tigers leopards etc). Viverrids share the same ancestor with felines that eupleridae do.

PS1: \*viverrids

PS2: I'm not a specialist, I just spent 20 minutes googling around. Somebody who actually knows this stuff well would presumaby be able to say more about what's convergent evolution and what isn't in the case of eupleridae vs. cats. My guess is that they're so closely related to begin with that it's going to be tricky to speak of convergent evolution at all."
todayilearned,fchidcm,t3_eh6l54,1577650712.0,"So I went and checked. TL;DR: there's some truth to it, but mostly it's wrong. /u/SomeTurdInTheWind didn't do his research and you're all cunts for upvoting this without checking (right now 3.1k, 96% upvoted). This is how fake news spread.

OP suggests that the malagasy Eupleridae *independently* evolved to have vertical pupils, retractable claws, whiskers, and to ""behave like a feline"" whatever that means, while failing to provide a source for any of that besides a wikipedia page that doesn't say that. OP provides no evidence that this took place independently from the evolution of these features in some felines.

Now I'm not a specialist myself. But if we look at other animals from the feliforma family (to which both eupleridae and felidae belong), others that are not felines (and don't live on Madagascar) have some of these features, or conversely there are felines that don't have these features. For instance meerkats have whiskers, lions have circular pupils, viverrids have semi-retractable claws and verticular pupils, etc.

All in all there's not that much suggesting convergent evolution. Rather it seems to me that the eupleridae are simply evolutionary close to cats. And that's why they look like cats. Other members of feliforma all around the world also look like cats even though they're not felidae, for instance [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Indian_civet) (who lives in India, where there are cats, but who is more closely related to mongooses). There's a reason why both eupleridae and felidae belong to the feliforma order, which means literally ""cat-like""."

Je suis chercheur, j'ai entendu des trucs absolument ridicules de la part de mes collÃ¨gues (sur l'environnement / le rÃ©chauffement climatique plutÃ´t que sur les vaccins; je prÃ©cise aussi qu'aucun de nous n'est dans aucun de ces domaines). Et puis tu leur montres par A+B qu'ils ont tort, et en leur foutant vraiment le nez dans leur propre caca jusqu'au fond des bronches t'arrive Ã  les convaincre. Mais c'est pas une procÃ©dure facile; trouver l'info prend 5 minutes, il suffit d'avoir l'envie sincÃ¨re de vÃ©rifier, mais le collÃ¨gue rÃ©siste, refuse de regarder, trouve milles excuses plus tordues les unes que les autres qu'il faut vÃ©rifier Ã  leur tour... Faut soit avoir une patience infinie, soit pas avoir peur du conflit.

Bref, en insistant on finit par arriver Ã  les convaincre: ""non, la dÃ©forestation de la forÃªt amazonienne n'est pas bonne pour le rÃ©chauffement climatique"". Malheureusement tu les as seulement ""convaincus"" sur le point prÃ©cis sur lequel ils ont dit une connerie. La semaine suivante ils t'en sortiront une diffÃ©rente mais du mÃªme tonneau (""utiliser des panneaux solaires Ã©met plus de CO2 plus que d'utiliser directement du pÃ©trole""), et venant problablement du mÃªme youtubeur.

Franchement, je sais pas quoi faire Ã  ce sujet. C'est trÃ¨s dÃ©primant.

French people talk and share their private lives a lot compared to the Brits or Americans -- doesn't mean Americans and British people don't cheat; they just talk less about it, whether they're cheaters or being cheated on.

Cheating is absolutely not accepted in France. Relationships generally fall apart when that happens, same as anywhere else."
