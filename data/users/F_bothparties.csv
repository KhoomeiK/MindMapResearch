AskMen,ff7t2qc,t3_erlbbu,1579657684.0,"Ok I got one to contribute, not really a first date. I knew this girl, hot af, but knew she was a little crazy. I invite her over and we hook up. This goes on for about a week. I realize she parties WAY harder than me and I like to date girls that somewhat keep me in check.

She comes over and I tell her in the nicest way possible that it’s not going to work but I really like her as a person and hope we can be friends. She gets a little upset and we talk. I don’t kick her out and let her chill out for a bit. I took out the garbage while she was chilling, come back, she drank every ounce of alcohol in the house, including a bottle of Moët I received as a tip from a client. She’s full blown crazy mad as well. Grabs a break action air rifle I had hidden behind a curtain for pest control, puts it to her throat and threatens to kill herself. For those who don’t know what that is, it’s a very powerful air rifle that looks and feels (weight wise) very real 

I laugh and grab the rifle, tell her to gtfo. Start getting phone calls and knocks at the door, which I ignore. Turns out it was my neighbors trying to tell me she’s jumping on the hood of my brand new car.

So I call my best friend (who I was in love with, hell still am. We dated later and it didn’t work out). She’s on her way over but says I HAVE to call the cops. So I do, they’re like “oh we’ll be right there”. I feel bad, because fuck snitches, so I call her to let her know the cops are on the way and she should just go home, GTFO of my apt complex. Some dude answers, I relay my message, he says “we heard about you threatening her with a gun and we called them too”. Oh FUCK this is not going to go well for me.

I did not have a safe at this time, kept everything in a locked closet. I take a blanket, open it up and lay all my guns on it and wrap it up. Check the window, yep police are starting to surround my building. Go to my neighbors (the ones trying to warn me). And say “hey I know I just moved in a week ago, but crazy bitch problems, would you mind if I stash my guns in your closet?” They’re cool af and say “hell yeah”. (They later received the most expensive bottle of alcohol I have ever purchased). Did I mention as I was creeping  to their apartment guns just started falling out of the blanket? Fun times.

So I stash the goods. My best friend shows up (don’t know how she got in, place is fully surrounded by now). She says fuck this let’s go talk to them. So we go outside, walk around a set of garages and walk up to this cop taking cover with an AR15 trained on the building. 

Us: hey can we talk to you?

Cop: get out of here we got a situation

Me: I’m u/f_both_parties I think you guys want to talk to me

Instantly looking down a barrel, my BFF just starts screaming and cussing the cop out. Cop lowers gun and they run the chics name, turns out this wasn’t the first time she had made an outrageous claim. Still the cops want to check my house, no problem officers.

Wait it gets better. A week later I meet this smoke show blonde in the parking lot. We hit it off, I invite her up to smoke, she’s all for it and I am super shy. Yes! My luck is finally changing!

We get up to my Apt, smoke. She starts telling me how her brother (who lives in my complex)  met some chic in the parking lot who’s BF of 3 years made her get an abortion and then threatened her with a gun. Her parents came, called the cops, took the girl home then banished blonde smoke show to the couch so crazytown could have her room.

“So yeah I’m “that guy” and that’s not exactly what happened......”

Didn’t get to fuck the smoke show."

Colorado,feijw42,t1_fegvpv0,1579140232.0,"Dude was wearing basket ball shorts and no shirt. Anyone who has experience with firearms (like cops) knows you probably couldn’t stick a .380 in your waistband without it instantly bouncing off your dick and falling at your feet. His fucking shorts were falling down. Maybe he had a couple cocktails in him and wasn’t thinking clearly? Does that warrant an execution?

If the dust cover thing was meaningless, why did the defense fight so hard to keep it from being admitted as evidence? I don’t think a jury would find it meaningless. I know I don’t, I know a lot of people who don’t think it’s meaningless. What about the bodycam footage? Have you seen it? His ass would be in prison if a jury had. Protect and serve? 

Then the department hires him back for a day so he qualifies for a pension. Funded by all of us. Who pays when agencies are sued for this type of shit? *We do.*

Corruption in law enforcement is rampant in the US. So I’ll cheer a pig getting fucked any day of the week.

Did we all forget the college student picking up garbage where he lived in Boulder?

What about the pig passed out drunk, on duty and armed in his patrol car in Aurora? Would any civilian get the same treatment? Well maybe a politician.

Edit: it’s the irony of the situation that I find hilarious. That law was meant for us plebs, not TPTB.

Edit 2: The deaf  Vietnam  vet in Aurora who saved his grandson from a naked intruder/attacker with lethal force from a handgun only to be shot and killed by Aurora police *firing from outside his house through windows*
