dating_advice,ffdwa2t,t1_ffbjtk0,1579830505.0,"Yeah and from my understand, a lot of people met there SO through luck, a friend of a friend, classroom, etc than they divorced 10 years later.  

True, I'm painfully shy and introverted.  I'm just not a getting more type."
hatemyjob,ffcxgns,t3_esux98,1579809297.0,Could be red flag. Are there any other red flags that you saw during the interview?
ForeverAlone,ffcw899,t3_esv69k,1579808562.0,Turning mid 30s soon. Time goes by fast.
dating_advice,ffbjl9k,t3_eshx6m,1579768361.0,"I'm convinced that some women at least, are stuck on a routine when meeting a potential partner.  They eat, sleep, sex, etc with the same partner and are used to that and I want to be that man.  

I've never had a relationship either and I think it starts with me.  I just have a negative outlook and think that every woman will reject me, well that is not true.  Sure it's tough but I refuse to give up."
dating_advice,ffbjgcm,t3_esgag2,1579768169.0,Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.  I have an attraction towards older women and some people can't understand that and why would ask why?  and even some would put me down.
work,ff94lzn,t3_esc3gl,1579704716.0,I live my life with no regrets.
ForeverAlone,ff8waar,t3_es50uw,1579698203.0,That's mines
dating_advice,ff6w5jb,t3_erni4u,1579636121.0,"I've never understood, the let love find you quote. How are you supposed to find love if you aren't looking for it?"
ForeverAlone,ff4ub2p,t1_ff2ykpq,1579572618.0,"Aw man,  sorry that happen to you."
ForeverAlone,ff4u91e,t3_erbuam,1579572579.0,"I've kind of stopped trying because I guess deep down inside I don't want to give up.  I've had connections before in the past and my problem is that I didn't get to experience enough of it.  

One of these days I might stop trying but for now I can't.....I won't."
ForeverAlone,ff4tnij,t1_ff4qnuz,1579572174.0,Yup even older decent looking women get a decent amount of male attention.
CougarsAndCubs,ff4k3rj,t3_d9eewy,1579565535.0,"I dont think people notice while we are in public but than again no one says anything. We may get some stares but that's basically it. I was 22 and she was in her mid 40's - early 50's. She had a son same age as me well I was a few months older. 

I've dealt with haters too, like a person online telling I was holding grandma, extremely rude than I blocked her. 

In the end, u can't care what others think. Do whatever makes you happy."
ForeverAlone,ff28x41,t3_er5j1s,1579497264.0,"I can tell you that looks don't matter all that much for a male at least. I would consider myself a good looking guy, however I'm still very lonely."
ForeverAlone,ff28rex,t3_er42og,1579497123.0,Lol I noticed that too.
depression,ff20o7p,t3_eqzk3k,1579490670.0,I feel the same way. Why did my parents have me?! To be fair they didn't know my life was going to suck but I was the fourth child born for God sakes.
ForeverAlone,ff1qydf,t1_ff1obm9,1579484235.0,"I tried that too, that I don't need any women in my life and that I can ride this life out solo but man it's tough."
ForeverAlone,ff1qdbj,t3_er3btn,1579483852.0,"Me 2, I wish I had a GF.  I'm so desperate that I might just find a wife from another country and bring her over here to get married.  God I feel so lonely,  you see women usually don't have this problem as they choose the guy.  Oh well."
Unemployed,ff1ouny,t3_eqq2ec,1579482882.0,"Maybe a take a class at a community college?  You'd also get to meet people.  Enjoy the free time as I did before I found my job.  I miss that free time, however I also got bored after a while and had to keep myself busy through the day.  

How long have you been unemployed for?"
depression,ff1o7kd,t3_er3lp6,1579482487.0,"I'm sorry to hear that, was this on the news?"
ForeverAlone,ff1kcow,t1_fey0wiu,1579480578.0,Yes I deserve the downvotes but I've learned from my mistakes.
ForeverAlone,fez00od,t3_eqvgi6,1579452584.0,I would love to have one.
