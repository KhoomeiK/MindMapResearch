It's just that we always get the story of what happened and the aftermath, but never how it got to that point, and I humbly presume that the key to discovering what makes certain men feel that it's okay to hurt a smaller person who doesn't pose a physical threat to them is to investigate how it gets to that.

Tons of people will lose their minds for two weeks and then they'll move on to the next ""problem"" in another game.  Fast forward three months later, Cyberpunk community is in full swing, in relative peace.

We've all seen this cycle before.  I still love the original Watch Dogs, by the way.  Bought a baton because of it, but haven't learned to use it like he does."

To say that the National Socialist German Worker's Party or whatever is Socialist is to assume that Federal Express is a federal agency.

I mean it's beyond deceptive, it's stupid."

Without detectives, murders would go unsolved.  Without journalists, we'd be completely lost as to what our government and society is doing, and why."
LifeProTips,fcab1jf,t1_fca1zkb,1577565918.0,"In December 2018, my '97 Camry drove like a cloud into the dealership where I bought my next car, and only gave up on the Camry because a mechanic that my family trusts who I took to inspect it told me that it was more expensive to pass inspection than the car is worth.

That car didn't give me any problems.  Bought it for $2,000 in 2010.

I bought a 2016 Jetta.  Oops.  Actually it runs really well, and I'm pretty careful about upkeep, so I'm not too worried.  I'm not expecting it to run for 21 years, though."

An honest mechanic, especially how complicated cars have become in our lifetimes, is like witnessing a miracle because a lot of us are beyond lost.  And the mechanics at Jiffy Lube are dicks.

I literally bought this car mechanic game for PS4 with the Jedi game for my Xmas splurge.  Haven't started it yet (Jedi game is dope.. wish there was more *pew-pew-slash-slash* than climbing puzzles but it's fine) but I basically just got an excuse to study vehicles more, along with this reference."
