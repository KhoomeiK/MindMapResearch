It was one of the best shows i ever saw.  Honestly for those of you who now don't have the chance to see these three members together you are missing something beyond incredible.

worldnews,fdqibbc,t1_fdqefsq,1578667372.0,"No it is propaganda.  When you say ""Derp America shot down a civilian plane cause they hate Iran Derp"" that's propaganda.  It was an accident, during hostilities, in a war zone, that was acknowledged and restitution was made.

This is not about my feelings.

But i am sure now that the Ukraine was shot down by Iran, as it is demonstrably clear, all the people barking about the American shoot down will be very, very quiet."

I guess this is not really the question for this sub, but it just sort of seems difficult to have such a limited genetic pool and successfully breed new life into a dog breed."

If Josh can get more accurate and bit smarter, a couple more play makers and the Bills fire the OC (who blows), they could be very dangerous in the future."

AdvancedRunning,fci99wn,t1_fchd8tv,1577659306.0,"Slang references
The term ""ham and eggs"" and variations of it have had various slang meanings.[21] In rhyming slang it refers to legs;[22] the phrase was also used with this meaning in the U.S. in the 1920s.[21] ""Like ham and eggs"" refers to things that typically go together and are difficult to separate.[23] To ""ham and egg it"" is to plug away at something.[1] ""Ham and eggs"" or ""ham and egger"" can also refer to an ordinary, unskilled or mediocre person.[21] A specific example of this is a boxer ""with a minimum of talent"";[1][23] ""ham and egger"" occurs in this context in the original Rocky film, filmed in 1975, when Rocky downplays his chances as a title contender, referring to himself as ""really a ham-and-egger"".[24] Similarly, ""ham and egger"" / ""ham and egging"" are both used in rhyming slang to describe a ""beggar"", and the act of ""begging"", respectively."

If Nike wanted to give me their $250 sneakers, great, but for the average person the money would be better spent on entry fees."
