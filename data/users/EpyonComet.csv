rush,ff6l9nb,t3_ert693,1579629604.0,"When I first got into Rush back in 2011, and ended up buying all the albums the next year, there were a few albums I didn’t care for, but every time I’d go back and listen to one of them, I’d end up wondering why I hadn’t liked it before. Now the only albums I still don’t really like are Test for Echo and Counterparts, though each still has a couple of exceptional songs.

But yeah, I’ll probably end up liking those too at some point in the next year or two."

Even if you tested it, I could say “It only works sometimes” or “I wasn’t going fast enough” or “I don’t want to right now”. Does that mean you don’t know the claim to he false? Maybe in a strict epistemological sense, but for all intents and purposes, it’s as good as actually knowing. If there’s no evidence for a claim, and it’s something that blatantly goes against observable and testable scientific laws, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with proclaiming it categorically false.

Wanting to avoid being labeled as religious, while also afraid to be labeled as non-religious.

Edit: and besides that, agnosticism doesn’t mean what you think it does. There’s agnostic atheism, and agnostic theism, but it doesn’t mean anything on its own. Besides that, “agnostic” is just a label that certain atheists give themselves because they’re either uninformed about what it means, or afraid of the stigma associated with actually referring to themselves as atheists. In my case, all the way back in middle school, I can say it was both. What about you?"

1. People seem to pretty heavily recommend Gold/Silver Bells as broken gunner pets. As for humanoids though, there should be Punks and one of the Gangster variants, up through Machine Infantry. I think you should be able to customize pet AI on E+ to make anyone ranged though. Try [i]nteracting with your pet and see if there are any options to adjust that.

2. I think you’re right about needing resistances, which it’s my understanding will mostly come through artifact equipment. If you’re talking about getting killed by Wizards of Elea early on though, it’s probably not that you’re actually getting killed by magic, but that you’re getting paralyzed and then getting murdered before you recover. You can get equipment pretty easily that will give you immunity to paralysis and make those guys a lot easier. If you’re talking about damage from Hound’s breath weapons, then I’m as lost as you are atm.

3. You’ve pretty much got it right with gathering scrolls to trade for gear. Eventually you can use the Scrolls of Oracle yourself to go hunt down relics, but idk how exactly that works and if the equipment is much better. Another point to keep in mind is that you can find artifacts with good magic effects, and upgrade their materials later to keep them competitive with higher-level gear. You probably already realize this, but the other important progression is doing jobs get platinum coins, which you will use to get all the skills you want and keep their potentials high.

4. No idea. I think it’s intentionally left to the imagination at this point, but I’m on OoMSEST anyway.

5. Don’t know what that is.

6. Don’t know.

Like I said, hopefully someone can get you some better answers soon, but maybe this is a start. I’d definitely recommend digging around in the wiki for more info where possible."
