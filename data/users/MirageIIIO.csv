This is a direct correlation to the comments above, as it is the result of concerted corporate lobbying of compliant corrupt politicians, to remove governmental oversight for the furtherance of profit and shareholder return."

There are no current plans to replace the T.1As flown by the Red Arrows, at least until 2030 or beyond. Note that the aircraft of the Red Arrows are not on permanent assignment and are routinely cycled through the entire fleet maintenance program."

facepalm,fcuu2s1,t3_eiw2qg,1577988509.0,Not a Bren Gun and not a standard magazine. The Bren was an Allied squad automatic weapon of British and Commonwealth forces in WWII. These look like some version of the Japanese Type 11.  Japanese Type 11 light machine gun as adopted in 1922. This weapon was actually a modified French Hotchkiss design that fired the standard 6.5 Japanese rifle round. One of the interesting aspects of this MG is that it is feed by a hopper mechanism located on the left side of the action that was designed to use the standard 5-round rifle stripper clips with a special reduced charged cartridge. The clips were laid flat in the hopper so that they feed the cartridges into the side of the mechanism. It can be easily distinguished by the very unique radically curved buttstock that provided an easy way to carry or hold the gun. These are all fitted with a finned barrel with no flash hider and a long folding bipod.
