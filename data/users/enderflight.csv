boomershumor,fgv7g00,t1_fgv6s8a,1581139432.0,"Why are you calling me out like this?

All these years of selling Girl Scout cookies and preforming and I still can’t be ‘professional’ or hold a good conversation. I get jittery and nervous when it’s high-stakes like an interview (last one I even personally knew the interviewer). I fidget a lot, even though I’m not really a fidgety person.

Honestly? I’d put it more down to being inexperienced than phones. Confidence with these things comes with time. If you weren’t at least slightly nervous at your first interview then you’re a rarity. I have to psych myself up for these things (‘the worst they can say is no’), because I psych myself out really well. But, again, with experience comes the chill. So people get better as they get older."
boomershumor,fgv6gfe,t1_fgv3gd8,1581138552.0,"Yea. Rattlesnake hotdog is, in fact, a thing. And I’ve seen some doomsday prep guy (was terrified of floods) who went out and showed the camera how to hunt and eat rattlesnake.

Seems more like an American West thing to me. Like, they’re pretty good protein, and a bit easier to catch than rabbits. They hide under stuff during the heat of the day, so it’s easy to find them. Catching them and killing them is a whole other ball game, but if you have the head you’re good."

NotHowGirlsWork,fgv3abs,t1_fgv37s7,1581135912.0,Don’t need to naturally be on steroids if you’re not physically fighting it out. Some people have a way with things.
NotHowGirlsWork,fgv1awi,t1_fgtpx6g,1581134361.0,"Amen. Some men hate office work and would like home work. Office work can be soul crushing for anyone. I’d say it’s anything but ‘natural’ for either sex. Men should be out running and building muscle! 

Not that natural=good, humanity’s improvements demonstrate that, but office work takes a specific type of person and motivation."

TwoXChromosomes,fguakmu,t1_fgu1s0x,1581116198.0,"When the world isn’t designed for you, it’s like being a lefty and having to deal with scissors.

I’m not demanding that all tools be made for women. But different sizes and designs could make life a lot easier. When you can’t just power through with brute force, it takes you a lot longer to finish a job.

And, on the other hand, I can lift stuff. Tables, chairs, whatever. Not nearly as easily as a guy, but I’m not helpless. I can put the chairs on the rack, and I don’t need help to do it. I understand that really heavy lifting has to be left to the guys, but it’s frustrating when you’re assumed to be *completely* helpless. Especially in jobs with manual labor. How would things be different if some things were designed for women? Like yea, I can lift things, it’s just a lot harder to do so. It would be interesting to see some innovation so that the playing field is more level."

WTF,fgrugr2,t1_fgpfkr8,1581058013.0,"Scorpions won’t kill you unless you’re compromised in some way—old, young, or allergic. Just hurts really badly. They suck though because they ambush you in ways spiders don’t.

Source: have been stung three times. First time: was minding my own business and reading a book lying down on the floor. Second time: put my leg down on one on the ground. Third time: walking in the kitchen, stepped by/on a scorpion and had my pinky toe stung (was completely numb for a week once it stopped hurting). I’ve had a couple close calls, too—one ran over my foot and another fell from the top bunk onto my bed (thankfully I was awake and lying on the other side, so heard the thud and investigated).

But rattlesnakes can kill you. Spiders stay, scorpions suck, snakes kill. But you’re not likely to find one in your house, wandering around, like you find scorpions. So don’t worry too much about the bugs, because even if you do get stung you’re not going to die."
