bipolar,fd3n3fm,t1_fd33esv,1578159861.0,Thank you!!! Everything just seems so much more colorful and vibrant when I’m hypo! I’d love to see how I’d color it when I’m depressed although I don’t think I’d have the motivation too

bipolar,fbt6psl,t1_fbst5wx,1577069781.0,Seriously! They don’t believe me because “I don’t have delusions and “am not crazy”” but that’s not what bipolar is at all but convincing them that is like pulling teeth
