This sub isn't really a support group, it's just a good place where you can be open."
offmychest,ffjxquu,t3_eu151p,1580009856.0,"It's a show with a lot of powerful emotion. But remember as you're watching that the situation is very much dramatized to the extreme. It's easy to get sucked in and feel really torn apart by it, so it was important to take mental health breaks in my experience."
science,ffjxd24,t1_ffjtf5d,1580009551.0,"To be fair, that one hasn't been 100% confirmed."

offmychest,ffiw91w,t3_etvosw,1579984224.0,"That guy was totally out of line to try and pressure you into doing something that made you uncomfortable. What you described right there was sexual coercion, and it's incredibly abusive.

But I wonder how some of them would have responded if you had confided with them your experience that night after the fact, and why you interpreted the request the way you did. It's clear that they conflated acceptance of another's sexuality with consent to sexual acts, which is completely not right.

I know you haven't kept in contact, but have you given any thought to reaching out to someone from that group to speak with them about that night? I'm sure they would be open to hearing you out, and maybe provide you with some sort of answers or closure."
offmychest,ffio80w,t1_ffijle4,1579978607.0,"I don't see how that could possibly be a solution to harassment. Is someone stalking you? Just don't look at them. Is someone touching you inappropriately? Don't let it bother you.

Ignoring a problem doesn't make the problem go away. OP should be encouraged for taking steps and asking for help to stop their harasser."
offmychest,ffiaqc3,t3_etndqy,1579969387.0,"I feel this way too, I'm still a very traditional person when it comes to sexual relationships. And that's okay.

I have a few friends that are the same way, but I know what you're talking about for sure. Something tells me that when you're looking at the gay dating scene, you'll be seeing a lot more people with the attitude you're talking about, but once those people are in a healthy relationship, most of them settle down. People are just trying to get their fix first and then they work out the logistics of love afterwards.

It's fine if you don't want that process. But maybe you should figure out a way to be upfront about your feelings, before the date somehow. Tell your potential dates that hookups turn you off, set that tone first."
CanadaPolitics,ffc7nds,t1_ffbw3j8,1579793415.0,"How can you possibly compare this to SNC? SNC wasn't a manufactured controversy, it was worth months of airtime, and the Liberal Party tanked like five points in the polls."

CanadaPolitics,ff92ltq,t3_es89ax,1579703310.0,"I'd argue it should be common practice to have either ""Opinion:"" or ""Author:"" in front of opinion pieces. As you said, it improves clarity enormously."
waterloo,ff87dz9,t3_es6sr6,1579668113.0,"You're going to get downvoted because you made a post entirely based on speculation, and then mindbogglingly ask that people share opinions based on ""clear logic and facts"". How about you meet your own standards first?"
Whatcouldgowrong,ff3udt0,t1_ff2mcmd,1579549056.0,"If I'm picturing that area correctly it's still tight to bike through, but I think there's a multi-use trail for most of that section of Fountain St., don't know how long it's been there though."
Whatcouldgowrong,ff21l2s,t1_ff04xjl,1579491337.0,"Was this Blair Road? If so I know what narrow path you're talking about. The Grand River Trail is a good way around that dangerous section, but I don't know how long ago this was."
CanadaPolitics,feymdwi,t1_feykcep,1579447549.0,"Did you read the article? That's not the point. 

What does a state or province with heavy dependence on oil and gas do when demand suddenly tanks? It takes decades to transition your economy, yet Alberta and Texas are trying to double down on the industry. By the time it's clear that the market won't be able to sustain the population with jobs, it'll already be way too late.

At least Texas has *some* diversity in its economy."

todayilearned,fel5plc,t1_fekets0,1579214621.0,"Right, but given that the territories only make up a small percentage of the population, it's reasonable that the rest of the country doesn't exactly relate to that. So it was kind of odd to hear.

Although the other user that replied mentioned that even the rest of us down here get periods of 7-hour days, so it's not that far off."
