gaming,fgense9,t1_fgdowxl,1580704273.0,It is my favorite console since snes.  My last Nintendo console was a 64.  Love it!  The perfect mobile and indie platform.
environmental_science,fgb7o02,t3_exjncf,1580659334.0,Loss of biodiversity.  There is so much we could learn from species that are going extinct daily.  The conservatively estimated billion animals dead in Australia.  I have a feeling that will look like child's play one keystones of the food chain start getting knocked out.

This animation style has me on a hard no.  Looking forward to the Dark Crystal game though, hopefully, it is good."

NintendoSwitch,ffn2yim,t1_ffko781,1580061462.0,"Agreed, I hadn't had a Nintendo console since I was a kid, 64.  Zelda alone got me to want a switch, but man I am blown away by the polish on some of their first party titles.  A good time to be back."
todayilearned,ffmbrn0,t1_ffmbic3,1580052005.0,"Funny always I assumed that was a cover, I guess it is just a parody..  ""Dare to Be Stupid"" is an original song by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. It is a musical pastiche (or ""style parody"") of the band Devo."

Would be awesome to see him take on some original songs at some point despite being a master of his current craft.  EDIT:  He has originals, and there goes my Sunday morning.  No regrets."
holdmycosmo,ffm4oc9,t1_ffkygln,1580048476.0,"The cold shock would do more damage than being unable to find the hole.  Usually you go straight down on cannon balls.  

""The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. ""

...""it's still crucial to stay calm and get your breathing under control. You only have about 10 minutes until muscle weakness sets in, followed by muscle failure. Climb out as quickly as you can, starting in the direction you came from, since you know the ice was able to support you up until that point. Kick as hard as you can to propel yourself forward, like a seal in the Arctic would.
If you have anything sharp in your pocket (car keys, a pocket knife), jab it into the ice as far away as you can reach to help pull yourself out. (I used to carry two knives when crossing frozen lakes for this very reason and my dad often has a long stick.) A ski pole, a ski or snowshoe can give you something to climb up on.
Once out, roll away for a good distance before standing up. Then remove wet clothing (which may seem counterintuitive, but is the fastest way to warm up), start moving, and don't stop till you've reached safety. You will need a hot bath (105 to 110 degrees F), but do not allow legs or arms to dip into the bath, as this causes the cold blood in the extremities to rush back into the body and lower the core temperature further, resulting in death. This is known as ""after-drop."" If you don't have a bath, use heat vents in a car, a heating pad, warm towels, exercise, or a fire. The process of reheating should be gradual but steady, and can take several hours."""

MagicArena,ffkr8in,t1_ffkpwdv,1580027472.0,"I think so.  I am in a nice loop of saving gems where I paid for the initial one, then just have to pay around 10 a set to get the next one.  Adds some fun and more packs to unlock.  Kind of on a spending freeze otherwise until they free brawl."

Bot flies, Ticks, all sorts of horrible parasites."
