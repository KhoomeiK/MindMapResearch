madlads,ffidgrt,t3_eto0ua,1579971256.0,My great-great uncle fought in India in WW1. He was stationed with his squad to guard a munitions factory. The factory caught fire and they were ordered to leave. He and his squad refused direct orders to leave and repeatedly entered the factory to retrieve crates of ammo and put them in a fountain to prevent them exploding. He saved the whole village and I believe he received some sort of medal. I learnt this about 7 years ago so I dont have any sources or anything.
