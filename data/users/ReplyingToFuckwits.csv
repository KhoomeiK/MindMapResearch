Since your immediate response was a ""whatabout communism"" with all the nuance of a steel cap to the face, I'm happy to drop the ""borderline"" from my last comment. 

You're a far-right apologist who is trying to guilt people into letting hateful political views sink deeper roots into society and it's important that people learn to recognise that for emotional manipulation that it is.

Advocating communism and advocating Nazism are not morally equivalent, regardless of what kill count you decide to attribute to them.

Communists online are promoting what communism ostensibly stands for. They are promoting a solution to what they believe are the exploitation and inequalities of unchecked capitalism. At their core, they are trying to help people. I've no intention of arguing if that is naive or not, but it is unquestionably their goal. 

Nowhere online have I seen any communist praising despots such as Mao or Stalin. They are advocating the political system *despite* the horrific cruelty those people inflicted on their countrymen, not *because* of it. 

Which is where they clearly differ morally from modern online neo-nazis. 

Because in the cesspits of social media I have yet to see a fascist claim ""I just believe that having one party who rule with absolute power is the best way to run society, without all the racism and horrific systemic murder"".

For the far-right, that violence is exactly the *point*. They're not advocating for ""the success of society should benefit everyone within that society"", they're advocating ""hey wouldn't it be cool if we went back to exiling and murdering blacks/gays/Muslims/feminists/jews/disabled?"".

So are you maintaining that far-right ideology would be countered by ""rational argument and public opinion"" *without* deplatforming?

Because that's borderline (if not outright) apologist. 

""Rational argument"" is (generally) not going to be a useful tool against people who are functionally cultists, people who refuse to read anything that's not in meme format or people who have a collection of staple slurs they can use to immediately terminate any kind of critical thought.

As for ""being kept in check by public opinion"", the deplatforming is a *manifestation* of that, not a slight against it. People have banded together to make it known that they don't want these shitty extremists on the site's they use, giving speeches in the halls they pay for or marching their tiki torches down the streets they live on. 

To argue otherwise is to fall for exactly what the quote warns about. The far-right (who are overwhelming the people having a tantrum about being deplatformed or censored) are using tolerance and plausible deniability to spread propaganda and misinformation online. They're intentionally grooming people for domestic terrorism. 

And I would argue that we're *still* being guilted into being too tolerant of harmful, irrational views. 

The anti-vax movement is using any platform they can to coordinate the spread of FUD about doctors and vaccines, resulting in a measurable increase in preventable death, particularly among children. 

Sleazy politicians and PR agencies are undermining decades of climate research and crippling environmental progress under the guise of there ""being two sides to the argument"" when the reality is that they just want to make as much money as possible dodging responsibility.

science,ffdkoaf,t1_ffdf763,1579822907.0,"> The answer is guns aren't the answer. More laws won't help. Fewer laws won't help.

More laws and better enforcement of the existing ones absolutely *will* help. 

When a mass shooting happens outside of America, one of the first questions asked is ""how did this obviously damaged person get a gun?"". 

Sometimes it's through a genuine black market fed by smuggling arms over borders. Sometimes they're bought legally. Sometimes there's just poorly secured guns laying around their house. 

And outside of America, the next question is ""how can be prevent it from happening again?"". Do we need tighter border control? Do we need more comprehensive background checks? Do we need to re-examine the risk of certain weapons? Do we need stronger penalties if your firearm is used in a crime?

And again, outside of America, those questions lead to issues actually getting addressed. After the mass shooting in New Zealand, they reassessed the value of allowing the general public access to semi-automatic firearms and took steps to reduce their number in the community. After the shooting in Paris they tightened border controls to try and prevent any illegal weapons (or people who would use them) getting in to the country. 

Within America, the story is depressingly similar for each depressingly frequent shooting. 

Nobody bothers to ask where they got the gun. They just shrug. They probably just walked in and bought it because background checks routinely fail. They probably just took it from their dads closet because there's no real pressure to properly secure your firearms. They probably just bought it from someone who stole it from a car because guns are so common and so easily traded that you'll find one without even looking. 

And when those questions *are* asked, they go nowhere. The pro-gun crowd make it immediately clear than any changes to laws -- or enforcement of existing ones -- will be met with staunch resistance. 

What happened when Virginia suggested ""Why not limit handgun purchases to once a month, stop people from bringing their guns to a park and require background checks on *all* gun sales?""

Climate change is a scientific fact that is only disputable through ignorance or misinformation. Outside greedy, conservative neoliberals who have made it a partisan issue and those who cultishly follow them, most people support systemic environmental protections but to you I guess they're all ""eco-nuts"". 

Trump is an incredibly unpopular president within the U.S and his approval rating plummets even faster if you poll people outside of America. So if ""normal people"" are just the majority, those ""Trump-haters"" aren't the abnormal ones, you are.

Looking through your comment history I don't see you leaping to correct disinformation from the people blaming arson or denying climate change is happening at all. 

Just this thread where you keep regurgitating views that are remarkably similar to those being heavily pushed by conservative media. 

In fact, didn't you open with a variation of PM Smokos ""[environmental policies] won't change the fact that there have been bushfires or anything like that in Australia""?

To put it bluntly, I don't believe you're an environmentalist. I think you're trying to create exactly the uncertainty you're claiming to oppose and I think you should be ashamed of yourself."
news,fepg9wn,t1_feotsrq,1579319751.0,"> It does. I completely agree. But it is not the sole cause of fires. It is important to not be misleading by implying that fires would not happen without climate change.   

Nobody is claiming that climate change is the sole cause of fires nor that bushfires would not happen if we stopped burning fossil fuels. 

> In fact, one of the main reasons fires get so out of hand these days is because human urban sprawl has prevented the natural seasonal fires from happening. As years go on without a fire, fuel continues to stack up, contributing to the huge megafires we see today.

Natural season fires in Australia have never stopped and major fires are getting more and more frequent (meaning fewer and fewer ""years go by"" allowing ""fuel to stack up"".

Because back in reality, an actual ""main reason fires get so out of control"" is a neoliberal, conservative government who cut every public service as deeply as they can so that they can funnel more money into the private sector. This means there is less funding for fire services to prevent things like ""fuel stacking up"" -- a key part of their job. 

And another reason is still climate change.

It depends where you look along the trail of misinformation. At the very end of it, when it's reached avid readers of trashy right wing rags and people who get their political opinions from social media, they're just stupid.
