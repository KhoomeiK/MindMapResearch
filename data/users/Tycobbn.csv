Then I found out airfare, port fees, transfers to and from the ship, etc wasn't included. Just the 7 day river cruise for two. I would've had to spend roughly $5K to accept my ""prize"". That's not including the taxes I would've had to fork over to the IRS at tax time. I only entered because I was laid off from work at the time. I definitely couldn't fork over $5K+. Winning that prize was devastating lol. Read the book of terms and conditions if you do enter anything."
