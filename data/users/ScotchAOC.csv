Factoriohno,fffa5st,t1_fff9gh9,1579879449.0,"I like that second idea.

The idea that the more biters you kill, it gives the option to reduce your pollution. If carefully balanced (which, its factorio, of course it would be) good give a good solution to preventing getting totally overwhelmed with biters if you overextend."

truegaming,fdi3pmz,t3_eli4zs,1578435187.0,"One could argue that Rim World, Dwarf Fortress, and similar are Sims competitors. They at least take inspirations from the sims (i.e. building living spaces and placing objects that simulated beings interact with and that influence their needs).

I think these games are seen as different than The Sims because the Sims setting is real-life and these are sci-fi and fantasy respectively. Ultimately, as others have said, there just doesn't seem to be any room (really, any NEED) for another life sim with a real world setting. Other than price, what could a Sims alternative offer?"

legaladvice,fc6ejwk,t1_fc697zs,1577478705.0,"How much you owed on the phone is irrelevant (that's why gap insurance on cars is a thing).

Legally you would be owed the current value of the item(s) aka the used value. If you are finding used values significantly higher than is offered, you could use that as a bargaining point.

You may also want to look at reporting this to police as a theft, which would be a criminal matter."
