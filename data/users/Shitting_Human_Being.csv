One of the standards even added programmable voltages, in 20(?) mV steps, perfect for CCCV battery charging. 

However this standard was implemented after manufacturers already had they fast charge standard. And to prevent users using cables designed for 5V 0,9A on their 9V 3A system, they added chips to only allow certified cables. 

And even now you don't want to draw 5A through a cable not designed for it."

A tiny bit of energy is lost in whatever is holding the rope, something like bending the rope if it is fixed or a loop slipping on a hook, but in normal circumstances that would be negligible.

I'm trying not to be an asshole here ^(I did have a few beers and then some) but removing air friction and fixing gravitational acceleration doesn't fix anything.   
It would he perfectly possible to describe the energy lost per revolution, the number just changes every revolution."
