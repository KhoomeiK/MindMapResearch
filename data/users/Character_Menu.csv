If being a rapper is something you know deep in your soul is what you want to do? Then dont give up. You just had a setback, and that's ok. I know it's hard cause you felt  you wasted your money. I say, get back in school, and keep writing your music. Now you know, you can do thing's a little different when you give it another go. You learn from failing."

offmychest,fdj3aok,t3_elmbug,1578457311.0,I don't have much advice: but you seem like a good person who just wants someone to be there just like how you would be there for a person.  They should be sad to lose such a good friend like you. Hang in there buddy.
offmychest,fdj2oms,t3_eln78w,1578456875.0,"You sound like me. Don't change  who you are in life. Cause you will get far being  the real you. Caring  about people  is a good trait to have. Basically, you got a good heart. I appreciate  you, even if  you feel a lot of people  don't Recognize  it."
