I'm generally rough as all hell on anything I own.

From the article.


What is a Farmer?

A farmer is someone that handles a large variety of tasks on a farm. A few of those tasks include:

Raising crops

Raising livestock

Managing soil

Be an expert on planting, fertilizing, and soil

As a farmer, the key ingredient is the soil as everything grows from it, including the farmers success. Farmers work long, hard hours on land that is typically smaller than a ranchers land.

Because I am not a dairy rancher. There's no such thing as a dairy rancher. If you want to get so defensive maybe read the articles you are posting and get something through that thick skull of yours. You call me hate filled yet you resulted to insulting a ""kid"" because you obviously have nothing better to do."
whatisthisthing,fcsb8r5,t1_fcs9qvh,1577914124.0,"I don't know what farmers you know then. Farmers don't need to enjoy it, but those livestock are their lives, and sorrow for reaping the benefits of their work makes no sense to me."

Nobody lied to me unless all Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois and farmers are wrong."
whatisthisthing,fcs974a,t1_fcs7dhc,1577913236.0,"Not really. Farmers should realize what's going to happen to your animals. It's life.

If you're going to be scarred because Bessy was slaughtered you are in the wrong business."
whatisthisthing,fcs6tho,t1_fcs56tn,1577912245.0,"What? That's not right at all. Dairy cattle, chickens, and swine are not ranched. Even beef cattle and sheep aren't always on a ranch. Either way a ranch is a farm but a farm isn't always a ranch."
whatisthisthing,fcs624u,t1_fcs0gxe,1577911942.0,"I wouldn't say a lot. It depends on the animals. Dairy farmers name all their cattle. Family lines and genetics are extremely important. Beef cattle sometimes are named, but not super often. I haven't heard of chickens being named unless they are pets or show.

I'm also curious why you think farmers are just holding onto their grain right now.

Steak is extremely versatile too. I'm not saying go and cube up a strip steak or ribeye, but there is a lot you can so right with a steak, and even more you can do wrong.
