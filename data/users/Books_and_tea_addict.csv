From Wikipedia:
Samuel Koch incidentEdit

Samuel Koch, a 23-year old aspiring stuntman, became a quadriplegic during a stunt performed on the show on December 4, 2010. The incident was broadcast live. The contestant took on a bet in which he was to try to jump over five moving cars using spring-loaded boots. The cars were of gradually increasing size. While the first and the third jumps were successful (the second one was aborted), the stunt went wrong during the fourth jump when Koch failed to clear the car, driven by his own father. Koch's head hit the windshield while he was inverted, and he then landed awkwardly on the studio floor, taking the impact on his head.[11][12][13] The contestant fractured two cervical vertebrae and damaged his spinal cord.

Koch was transported to a nearby hospital, where emergency surgery was performed upon him. Koch survived but is now paralyzed for life from his neck down.[2] The episode was interrupted and terminated prematurely about 20 minutes later, for the first time ever in the program's history. The ZDF has stated that both the episode and the segment depicting the accident will never be broadcast again. In the follow-up Wetten, dass..? episode, Thomas Gottschalk announced his decision to resign as the show's host after the last installment of the 2011 season, with the accident being a major motivation to do so.
