teenagers,fe6dmf0,t1_fe5rqsp,1578887820.0,Basically.
college,fe418jk,t3_enj55m,1578854800.0,"Definitely, definitely. I thought I was the only one. It's like you count the months for a single semester and it only felt like it was finished in a matter of weeks. I don't know, it's weird how caught up we get with studies."

pokemon,fbxnl5u,t3_eepbz9,1577195023.0,"I'm so happy for the half of this year for myself, and also for my mom. It was a bit of an impulsive game with her when I and her family were buying a toy for my youngest sister. I was telling her how much I wanted a Switch Lite so bad in a teaseful way. She was like, sure, just make sure you'll pay it back. That was the most joy I've felt even though I'm paying it gradually thru my college scholarship stipend. Still, I felt like a kid again back in September, waiting for Pokemon Shield on November 15. For my mom, I noticed how she's been more calm and happy with her life compared to how she was back then.

That's just my little story. I'm really happy for this guy in the video! And especially in the loving family he is in. Merry Christmas indeed! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
