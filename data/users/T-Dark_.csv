>terrasteel armor is really shit against gaia guardian without stacking potions anyway

You see, this is an example of good game design. Imagine terrasteel armor was good enough against gaia guardian, the ultimate fight of the mod. If that were the case, what purpose would potions have? When would one use them? Never, which would make a whole lot of interesting content as useless/niche as it is in vanilla.

>and if you leave draconic evo out theres still that angel ring, or jetpack, or the other power armors like fluxed armor or dark steel armor

You're missing the point. You shouldn't compare botania to _any other mod_, not just DE. It was built taking only vanilla and itself into consideration.

Let's be honest here, the entirety of botania, without any  exception whatsoever, is ""really shit"" in comparison to another mod.  
Any automation it allows you to do, you could achieve with industrial foregoing, which would have the benefit of being faster, cheaper, and easier to set up.  
Any combat utilities it provides, you can easily surpass with tinker's, especially if you have tinker's tool leveling.  
Most other features can easily be replaced by a better version too.

Does this mean botania is shit? No. It was explicitly made to be underpowered by modded minecraft standards. And that's exactly the reason it's a good mod. Because it doesn't push your power level so high that the content at the beginning of the mod is outdated. Because it doesn't provide magical single blocks that do a job, instead giving you all the bits and pieces you need to create a contraption that does that job.

However, you need to let go of the foolish mindset that a mod is only good if it gives you the best toys in all of the modding scene."

Why does ""health"" have a completely silent a?

Why does ""scent"" even start with an s if ""cent"" is pronounced the same? Or why does it have a c, as ""sent"" is also identical?

Why do words such as knight and knit have a silent k? _[They used to be pronounced. Imagine ""kniggt"", except the k is not silent]_

Why is ghost spelled with an h, if ""gost"" would be pronounced identically? Unlike ""scent"", the h isn't even necessary to tell the word from what would otherwise be homographs. _[It was originally written down by dutch people, who used their orthography, as English didn't have an official one]_

Why do words like come, gone, shine and a lot more have a final e if it's always silent? _[That's a holdover from French]_

On that note, why is shine pronounced as if it were spelled ""shyne""?

Why do words of greek origin such as ""psychology"" still start with a p?

Why does ""dead"" not rhyme with ""bead"", even though the last three letters are identical? Why does it rhyme with ""bed"", which is spelled differently?

On that note, why is rhyme not spelled ""rime"" if the pronunciation is the same?

Why is ""colonel"" pronounced ""kernel""? Why is ""Lieutenant"" pronounced ""Leftenant""? Where did the f even come from?

Why does British English spell colour, armour, etc with a completely silent u?

Why does it spell centre like that even though it's pronounced ""center""?

Why has american English decided that the word ""kansas"" is pronounced differently if preceded by the letters ""ar""? (Kansas / Arkansaw)

Why is ""epitome"" pronounced ""eh-pih-toh-mih"" (IPA: /epito'mi/) and not ""eh-pih-tome"" (IPA: /e'pitom/)? _[Words of Greek origin that end in e do pronounce it, unlike the French ones]_

None of these things are hard once you know them, but they confuse new speakers. They all make sense, historically. They do not make sense in modern English, however. Some of them even confuse native speakers, like ""epitome"" or ""colonel"". The majority of languages with alphabetical writing use consistent spelling, where one can learn that a certain letter makes a certain sound, then throw in special letter pairs (Italian ""gl"", Spanish ""ll"", English ""th"") or triplets (Italian ""Sci"", Spanish ""que"") and, just like that, learn how to pronounce the entire language.

English orthography provides next to no information about the sound that a word makes. Like in Chinese, one is forced to learn the sound every word makes by heart with little pronunciation information encoded in the written word itself."

patientgamers,ferwxch,t1_fepmgtr,1579359174.0,"To be honest, it depends on the interpretation. If the camera sees through the eyes of whatever mook you are shooting right now in a shooter, one could argue that's second person. The first person is you, the second one is your target, and the metaphorical third is someone else, who, in third person games, floats above your shoulders.

That being said, I have my own interpretation:

I think in games there are always three ""persons"":

1. Your character  
2. Whatever your character is looking at  
3. A point behind you  

First person places the camera in your character. Third person places it at the point behind you.

By this definition, second person would place it in front of your character's eyes:

Imagine your character had a laser pointer between their eyes. They look at a wall. The laser pointer hits a point on the wall. Your camera is placed there, and angled to have your character in the middle

If you move your mouse right, your character turns their head right. This causes the point on the wall to move to your character's right, which from your perspective causes it to move left. Now, since the camera must be angled towards the character, it rotates towards the right to adjust.

This would be incredibly confusing, of course, but theoretically possible.

A slightly simplified system may work, tho: the camera is positioned right in front of your character, but you can rotate it any way you please. If you want to change the direction your character is looking at, you press LMB, and they'll look towards the point that you were aiming at when you did that. This could be used by puzzle games in a variety of ways, especially if the camera is actually some kind of drone which can pickup and drop things, or otherwise interact with the world. The game could be about managing both where your character is and which lines of sight they have access to."

1. Spleef is a gamemode which gathers players in a floating arena. Players can break the blocks that make up the floor to try to make other players fall. Last man standing wins.

2. Glowstone is a block that emits light. Due to how Minecraft treats ice and snow, that means that it melts them if too close.

3. Minigame arenas are almost never barebones, and tend to be decorated. ""scenery"" would be another word to refer to the decoration. In this case, it means that there was glowstone in the decorations.

4. Ice may have been chosen for a variety of reasons (most blocks can be used as flooring in spleef), but it has the unique property of being slippery, which makes controlling one's character harder.

5. It _was_ ice, but, since it was too close to a light source, it melted, creating water source blocks. Due to how liquids in minecraft work, source blocks create a waterfall that never exhausts, and reaches all the way to the bottom of the world (Players can fall below that, but they'll die quickly if they do).

6. We are talking about the blocks that make up a spleef arena. Players are supposed to die if they don't have anything to stand on, but, due to the waterfalls (which can be swam up), they didn't fall into the void and die.

In a proper game of spleef, there is no way to get back to the arena if you fall out. In this poorly designed version, there was a way (swimming up waterfalls, which also allows one to not get all the way to the top and stall the game)."

I mean, that's not _entirely_ wrong.

Dante wrote in Tuscan*, and so did Petrarca and Boccaccio. Writers after them modeled their prose and poetry after them. Then, Alessandro Manzoni wrote the _I Promessi Sposi_ in Tuscan because that had been the language of writing for centuries. He even went to live there to be exposed to the language and correct his wrong assumptions (he was from Milan).

The result of this tradition is that Tuscan was the language of the more cultured people, while the less cultured didn't really have a single language all throughout Italy. Due to that, literary Tuscan was chosen as Italian, since it effectively already was.

It wasn't designed by writers. It isn't Esperanto. But it had been used by writers and other cultured people for centuries when it became the language of the newly unified nation. I'd expect this to at least somehow reflect on the language.

CrappyDesign,fdmwd9k,t1_fdmn6in,1578568861.0,"Normal numbers are numbers that contain every possible sequence of digits somewhere.

An example of a normal number is 1234567890101112131415... That is, every possible sequence of digits concatenated together.

An example of an infinitely long nonrepeating non-normal number is 0.01001100011100001111... That is, 1 zero, 1 one, 2 zeros, 2 ones, 3 zeros, 3 ones, and so on. This number is infinitely long, does not repeat, and clearly does not contain all possible digit sequences.

Pi has not been proven to be a normal number. IIRC, we have proven it contains all possible sequences of digits that, if interpreted as a natural number, are lesser than 10 000 (by literally looking for them and finding them all among the known digits of pi), but we haven't been able to prove _all_ sequences can be found.

We have also not been able to prove or disprove statements such as ""after a certain point, the decimal expansion of pi no longer contains the digit 7"", or ""there are infinitely many repetitions of the digit 5 in the decimal expansion of pi"", or ""after a certain point, the decimal expansion of pi only contains only the digits 0 and 1"""
dataisbeautiful,fdmuxit,t1_fdmri39,1578566986.0,"More specifically, A\* as an algorithm is meant to do that.

A\* is a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm basically says ""Let's try to move in every possible direction at once, in an expanding circle (or whatever shape the obstacles cause). However, if the terrain is difficult, and therefore would take twice as long to walk through, we will only try that direction half the time"". This way, the algorithm ends up favouring  faster paths, but still taking slower ones into consideration.

A\* adds a heuristic function. In math, a heuristic is a function that trades being accurate for being fast. A simple example of a heuristic that can be used in A\* is the function that creates a straight linear path to the destination. It's not right, but it mostly goes in the right direction and it's fast.

A\* operates like Djikstra's algorithm, except it prefers paths that follow the heuristic. Using the aforementioned straight line, it means that it will try to ""move along"" the line more often than not.

If the correct path looks mostly like a straight line, this is an improvement. If a straight line tends to lead to a dead end, then the ""straight line"" heuristic is clearly inappropriate and should be replaced by a better one which won't get stuck as often."

If there is a 90° angle between them, and a lenght of i means ""1, but rotated 90° clockwise"", then effectively this means that there are two sides of lenght 1, drawn on top of each other, which explains the third side having a lenght of 0?

What if applying that rotation gets you a 180° angle, tho? The remaining side would have to be 2 units long, wouldn't it?"

I'm Italian. I said the N-Word plenty of times in that language, simply because our culture only finds it offensive if used to insult, as opposed to the ""it's inherently offensive"" stance that the English-speaking world seems to take. Personally, I find such a stance _extremely_ weird. IMHO, a word should not be offensive before context is taken into consideration. That being said, I understand the English stance and respect it.

>you are simply not taking into account the context of the usage of the word, the word can be said without any intent of insult or offense, and there is no problem.

I agree here. Thing is, my opinion doesn't inherently outweigh everyone else's. If people agree to interpret the N-word as inherently offensive, context can go sleep on a kelp bed. Language is determined by its speakers, after all. We aren't speaking in French here.

>All I am saying is you don't get a medal for never having said it, at the end of the day it is just a word (albeit with connotations).

I half-agree. On one hand, I wouldn't give myself or anyone else a medal for that. On the other hand, it means they haven't ever done something that is agreed to be bad. That should be worthy of some praise

>I follow this sub actively and I find it entertaining the lengths right wing loonies will go to bend reality to their perception, I am not attacking the sub, I am attacking the people on this constant never ending exhausting witch hunt of pewdiepie, like fuck it he said it learnt from it, and issued an apology. I do not know any black people who are still offended by this

I don't know enough about the PDP controversy to talk here. What I _do_ know is that, whatever he's doing, it's attracting racists and alt-righters. Maybe he is, indeed, innocent. Maybe it all started with a mistake and it just won't end. But shouldn't something be done about it anyway? If one's community is full of these people, then one should at the very least make it absolutely clear and not up for debate that they do not want these people, and would rather they went away.

>It just really seems like everyone had made their mind up because of what they have read about him but probably only 1% are actually familiar with his content and can see that he is not this white nationalist cult leader he is constantly painted as, I mean for gods sake he has 100m subscribers, sure he has some racist followers, and also tonnes of not racist followers, but its a little harder to be vocal about not being racist you know, like it's hard to prove a negative.

While that's a pretty good argument, it doesn't change the fact that he doesn't seem to dislike his worst fans. I can give him the benefit of the doubt, but I can't be sure he would give up some numbers and income if he had a magical ""ban all alt-righters"" button.  

All in all, you may not think PDP's behaviour is wrong, and that's a perfectly valid opinion, but I, (and most people here, apparently) very much believe he is being a shitty person by tolerating other shitty people."
