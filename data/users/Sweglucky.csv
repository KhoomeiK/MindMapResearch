depression,fdjy7d9,t3_elscma,1578491194.0,"Well, that is not true. Everyone has their own problems to sort out. This whole group is literally designed to help each other. People here do honestly care about others. Being sad is just a part of being human, even if you're constantly sad. That's just how the world is now. Hope you find peace in your struggles! Good luck."
depression,fdjxzcg,t3_elsfpo,1578491013.0,"As much as strange it might sound, ending your life is not the best option. Everyone has their up's and down's. Some down's can last years for some people. Try to find something that you like, enjoy doing. The majority of people don't realise that they are missing out on life. There are so many beautiful things in it that you probably haven't tried. Make a list of thing that you would potentially like to try out or something. Good luck!"

depression,fdhso6z,t3_elh838,1578429423.0,"Hey, life can be tough, life can be difficult and every other synonym. But what can be crucial in each person's life is your occupation. Sports is not for everyone, just like anything in life. What you can try and do is literally search for the thing you like to do. You will feel unmotivated and sad and depressed, but you will find it (probably). All you need is a little bit of self-discipline, some cigarettes and a huge list of potential occupations you may like to do. There is nothing bad if you keep trying things out and end up abandoning them. It's a part of the trip. Good luck and farewell :)"
depression,fdhryn7,t3_elh4sd,1578429021.0,"I had a whole argument about cheating, even lost some friends over it. People overthink cheating, it isn't that bad. Every person has a choice and you made a choice to cheat, so that's over.  You have 2 options now, continue to try and have a good life or to give up. Finding a job is a matter of time, if you try hard enough, you will definitely get a job in no time, even if it's not the best one. But why not try again? What do you have to lose?"
depression,fdhrayn,t3_elgwr8,1578428639.0,"Presentation may play a key role in keeping a person fed. Every person wants to eat, it's just how people work, biology and stuff. When a person sees a very good looking meal, he would have an instant desire to try it out, despite the fact that they have depression or not. Of course, each person is different and likes different types of food. You could try getting in small bites of something that you know she loves. It can be anything really. The most important thing for you now is to not allow her to get anorexia or any other health problems. Another thing you can do is give her drinks (smoothies). As weird as it sounds, eating hard food can look like too much effort for a depressed person, so soft consumables like smoothies, water and etc might be the thing you need. Tell me how it goes :) Good luck)"
depression,fdhqljq,t3_elgxyz,1578428230.0,Because it's life and life is very repetitive. Just try not to think too much about it. Good luck.
depression,fdhqawj,t3_elgvrt,1578428058.0,"Hello there. Thinking that you are failing in every task is just useless. Because you are alive and you made it to 20yo, that's a task on it's own. But from what i'm getting, you are trying to understand why can't you be smooth in the tasks you do? (correct me if i'm wrong). To be honest, you are probably doing better than everyone else. Why you may ask? Well, because you are making mistakes and i believe that making mistakes is the best thing ever. Because you can learn from them. Another aspect to consider is that you only see the end result of other people's completed tasks, you can't know if they encountered any hardships whilst doing their tasks. Don't think about it too much, because there is no point. Focus on the task and just do it and learn from your mistakes. It's not too late. Good luck in your adventure.."
depression,fdhppbj,t3_elgbrt,1578427700.0,"Hey, i've went through something very similar. Only i arrived to the UK as foreigner, to study at university. My first year at uni was just sooooo bad. Couldn't make friends with anyone, because i didn't really care about them thought they were stupid (they still are stupid for me tbh). I finished my 1st year with the highest grades on the course and i'm half-way through my second year. But what i realised quite recently is that the people in my course are just not the type of people i would like to hang out with or just generally be friends. 

They don't really like me much as well because i constantly make fun of them for their absurd actions. Funny, thing, i tried making friends with them at the start, i was also very nice and polite to them, but it seems it just didn't stick. Getting bullied is rough, but you're not anymore, so why even bother? Unfortunately, we humans, have one chance at this life and spending it being afraid of someone thinking something not nice about you is just sad. 

Because you are convincing yourself that they will be laughing and judging you, but as a fact, they probably won't. Fact is, they probably won't event think about you at all. People at uni are busy and they have their own problems to deal with, they won't be wasting their time deliberately thinking something bad about someone they've just met. If you are looking for and excuse not to interact with people, then you will always find it. Ngl it will be very cringe when you first start talking to people and you will be nervous and all. But each time you'll get better and with each time you'll get more confidence. Hope you find your way and i wish you good luck in you journey through life."
depression,fdho3hc,t3_elgc6s,1578426743.0,"Taking into consideration that you are 17, it sort of makes sense that you are going through some things at the moment. According to the NHS (UK version of health care) every 3rd person has clinical depression.  What you are experiencing may be or may be not depression. If you would like to receive help regarding your mental state, you should try and visit a professional psychiatrist or a psychologist, maybe even your general practitioner. 

However, from my experience, being 17 i also was in sort of a similar situation as you, except i lived at home (sometimes). Doing drugs will be fun and it will seem that it's going to work for a long time, but unfortunately it won't.  After a few months, it will get worse and worse and it will not stop until you're at your lowest of lows. Doing weed, however is not very healthy, but whatever, almost everyone does it at this point and that's not a big deal if you are too. Drinking is a whole other topic that can go 2 ways, you either develop a habitual drinking routine or you drink at random time periods. What i would recommend is just try not to drink too much, other than that i have nothing more to say regarding the drinking topic.

Talking about your wellbeing and the surrounding environment. It can be worse and it will be worse if you don't step in. Unfortunately, we are not robots and sometimes have downs, that you seem to understand very well, judging by what you've written. If you are trying not to completely lead your life to ruin, you need to start doing things. Try cleaning your room. washing your clothes for a start and then focus on other tasks at hand. Best of luck to you)"
depression,fdhm8fu,t3_elgc0m,1578425627.0,"Well, you should understand that writing something like that without any intent of actually doing it (if you are not actually doing it i hope) would bring negative reactions from people. The best way to understand your actions is just to imagine a situation where you are the recipient of such a message and try and see what your feelings would be. But drunk texting isn't new, alcohol is a stimulant (sort of) and often makes people do uncommon things. So, try not to think too much about it and just live life as if it never happened."
depression,fdey3zg,t3_el10wl,1578349061.0,"u/BravoUnit Says a good thing. Talking to a professional might help, but whatever you do, don't start taking meds right off the bat."
depression,fdexv83,t3_el15gc,1578348909.0,"Well, there's this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/el0cg6/moving\_through\_life\_with\_almost\_no\_emotions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/el0cg6/moving_through_life_with_almost_no_emotions/)

But i guess you are trying to figure out how not to be alone. Because there are only 2 ways you can go in your situation, the 1st one is being alone and 2nd one is not being alone. However, being alone and lonely are 2 different things. Unfortunately, you have to decide what you want and go from there. Good luck."
depression,fdex5yo,t3_el170m,1578348471.0,"This happens all the time, well to me at least. At one point i stopped caring and don't even notice that i write first all the time. It doesn't really matter who writes first, what is important is your friendship. That's all i can really say."
depression,fdew51v,t1_fdevywv,1578347840.0,"Not going to lie. Whatever you do, don't do meds. I did them and i strongly do not recommend doing antidepressants. Think of them as the last resort."
depression,fdevwlk,t1_fdev52q,1578347701.0,"Well, that sounds a little off tbh, no offence. Try to just not mention that she has depression at all. Treat her as if she doesn't have depression at all, but with way more consideration for her feelings and mental state."
depression,fdev8cb,t3_el0l4w,1578347303.0,"There is forced help and non-forced help. What you are experiencing is probably forced help, when people are trying to aggressively push their help onto you. What you can tell them is to ask them to give you space and time. Any mental illness, disfunction, abnormality unfortunately can't be dealt with in an instance. You need time and space. Try to keep yourself together and work it step by step. You will notice how things change with time."
depression,fdeup45,t3_el0n78,1578346985.0,"I would agree with u/Rmi93. What you definitely don't want to do is to treat her as she is sick or something. Also, don't force your help and support onto her. This may sound weird and stupid, but she needs space for her to breathe."
depression,fdeuba5,t3_el0p2p,1578346758.0,"If you're depressed, that doesn't mean you should stop smiling. The best way would be to just tell her that you are depressed. As stupid as it might sound, don't try to make her notice that there is something abnormal in your behaviour, just approach her."
depression,fderd5o,t3_el0a2i,1578345010.0,"Hey, i guess we're in very similar situations (my post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/el0cg6/moving\_through\_life\_with\_almost\_no\_emotions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/el0cg6/moving_through_life_with_almost_no_emotions/)). Maybe we could share experiences or something?"
