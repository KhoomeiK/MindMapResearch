That's the stuff. Developing countries in general, not just India."

worldnews,ffhnxd6,t1_ffhlnt9,1579944551.0,"This is a very old debate. Reminds me of [Clara Maass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Maass) back when yellow fever was killing so many. What age is too young to give one's life for science? At what point are you too old, with too many responsibilities? Of course there's a distinction between volunteering for a disease study as a nurse, in comparison with being a doctor working on a cure. But there was a lot of risk in both."

PublicFreakout,ffekpvn,t1_ffdwtw4,1579852113.0,"Nope. 99%+ of the population speaks one of the native languages. Philippines hasn't been under Spanish control for 120 years. There are still many Spanish words used, but the languages themselves are not Spanish-influenced, only the vocabulary."

This is the first one mentioned here that's actually a stereotype in the vein of OP's picture, in my opinion. Especially in philosophy or sociology."
politics,ffae77t,t1_ffadbkf,1579733526.0,"Many estimates of Civil War dead are much higher than that. But if looking at casualties, you're into the millions for the Civil War, so that would be hard to beat (850,000+ apiece for both Union and Confederates). And since so many died of diseases contracted during the war (more than combat deaths) and infection from amputation, the true number is hard to know (40% of the dead went unidentified, sometimes uncounted), looking at those dying in the immediate aftermath of the war, or on returning home. Many, many pensions went unclaimed. [Source on newer estimates - one example](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/civil-war-toll-up-by-20-percent-in-new-estimate.html). It's a slippery thing."
