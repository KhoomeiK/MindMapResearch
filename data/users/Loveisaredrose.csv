What you do is you call your house mates together and you preface your speech with 'I don't know which one of you did it but-' then bring it up and wait for the guilt to surface on somebody's face. Once you know which one of the knuckle-draggers left a dangerous situation for someone else to clean up, you know who to harangue."
