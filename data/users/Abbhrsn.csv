PokemonSwordShield,fey37by,t3_eqplh0,1579440179.0,"Awesome, seems like a lot of people are trying to be helpful and share their shiny raids as much as possible, glad to see people helping the community out."
todayilearned,feu31py,t1_fetnx9r,1579382675.0,"Most of the people I know that own equipment to get into cars won't touch a random person's car, I've heard horror stories of people trying to sue over someone scratching their car or something while trying to get into it."
personalfinance,fepgv5r,t1_feml360,1579320163.0,"Oh yeah, definitely then, if they didn't just scrap it and parted it out they probably sold that thing down to the sheet metal, I mean we used to sell doors, fenders, hoods, trunks, struts, motors, transmission, motor accessories, radio, hell I used to even pull seats, dashes, and windshields out of the things if they were in good shape..lol, those cars were easy cash, we used to pick up every one we could.  People love Hondas, Civics and Toyota Corollas have gotta be the 2 cars I'd recommend to someone that wanted a car that takes nearly no maintenance and just keeps going."
yugioh,felxl3b,t3_epkl60,1579233490.0,"Hayabusa Knight, I used to love that thing..lol, Scapegoats, United We Stand, Shooting Star Bow, boom 8k directly.  Even had one I colored with a gel pen so he had red armor, I think I even made a full custom archetype for them based around equip cards and sacrificing equipped monsters to summon new ones from the extra deck but I can't remember if I still have the stuff sitting around."
pics,felxe2b,t1_felwtxe,1579233343.0,"Yup, the way the comment I replied to was worded though it made it sound like they were saying it has tobacco.  They sell some hemp wraps around here that work pretty nicely too, and they're still referred to as blunts."
personalfinance,felx9jd,t1_fekqphh,1579233250.0,"Yeah, they probably made a decent chunk of change off the thing too is the crazy part, I used to work at a scrap yard specializing in foreign cars and most Hondas we got we'd sell everything out of them.  The things would be down to sheet metal before we scrapped them, because we knew they were good sellers.  Even if you just scrap the car immediately you can pull the alternator, ac compressor, calipers, converter, battery, and wheels and sell all of those as core parts to a buyer, then just scrap the car and probably make a couple hundred bucks off it over what they paid you."
personalfinance,felx0d9,t3_epna6i,1579233061.0,"Definitely take the $4400 and keep the car, honestly if you don't care about the scuffs and stuff I wouldn't even bother fixing them, just drive the thing until the wheels fall off.  Civics are pretty reliable, so long as you don't try to drive it like a race car and keep up on the engine maintenance I bet you could get another 100k out of it.  I think a good running Civic with only a little cosmetic damage is easily worth more than the $1500 extra you'd get for selling it back to them."
funny,felw90j,t1_feltnnn,1579232504.0,"I agree that the court system would be the most responsible thing to do, but on the other hand if someone was messing with my money I'd most likely not be thinking about doing the most responsible thing."

funny,felsltr,t1_felrz31,1579229915.0,"I have a feeling someone running a business like this can quickly tell the difference between someone that legitimately is having an issue, and someone that is trying to get out of paying.  I bet that they are willing to work with someone, but if someone refuses to pay for a job that's been done I see no problem with undoing the job you did."

pokemonrng,fefnyuh,t3_eowyou,1579060511.0,"That should work, and if the game isn't open at all the seed can't advance, so when I'm done I usually just close the game completely instead of just putting it in sleep mode"

pics,feeq8vh,t1_fedhfqa,1579038919.0,"Nice, that sounds super useful.  I didn't have true winter gear, since I live in the middle of US it only got that cold rarely so I decided it wasn't worth the investment.  I'd always just double up some jeans, wear a few shirts, hoody, jacket, and that did me pretty good.  The worst part personally was using my hands, I had really nice gloves but as you probably know it's hard to use some tools with gloves..so it was a matter of using gloves and going slow, or using thinner ones or no gloves and rushing through the job..lol, the customers usually were pretty good though, it was always the people working behind the counter and stuff that you had to watch out for complaining."
pics,fed01e3,t1_fecyg9i,1578991904.0,"Wow, I never worked in anything that cold but I had to pressure wash engines in below zero and that was no fun, those were the only times I'd actually wear our rain gear to keep from getting wet..I definitely don't miss the outside work.  It was a junk yard that specialized in foreign cars, so we always had lots of business.  Type of weather where you'd run out, take a bolt or two off, run back in to warm up, and repeat it till the part was off the car."
tifu,fecgzw9,t3_eocmyb,1578973700.0,"Hey, I'd say that's pretty bragworthy too!  I mean, I'm sure guys have bragged that they're so good that they sent a woman into labor at least once or twice..haha"
pokemonrng,fdzgvy5,t1_fdzexx3,1578790102.0,"Only other suggestion I have is maybe try extracting it all into another folder, maybe in a shorter folder name if you originally tried your desktop?  Like closer to your root drive.  Sounds like a missing file, but if you extracted the whole zip you should have everything"
future_fight,fdzgjsb,t1_fdwshz5,1578789987.0,"Maybe add the ability to change?  Lol, or make it tied to uniforms or something."

television,fdzcnsn,t3_en8fy5,1578788976.0,"Haha, I remember reading his biography randomly since the library had it and he talked about this.  He said a dude had to show him how to tuck it in the costume and stuff..lol"
pokemonrng,fdvbizm,t1_fdp7pqf,1578745683.0,"From what I've seen if you skip in the wild area when you go back to the game it tries to load all of those skipped frames, which can easily lead to a soft lock when you're suddenly loading up a couple hundred or thousand days worth of npcs and raid spawns."
pokemonrng,fdvaql1,t3_emjwg4,1578745340.0,Did you extract it all from the zip?  That file should be in the same folder as the exe
pokemonrng,fdva14p,t1_fdtysys,1578745186.0,"Better safe than sorry I suppose but I usually do it in year chunks in the pokecenter and I've been fine, I've only done it once but I had to skip a few years and had no bad effects."
pokemonrng,fdv9w4d,t1_fdu0jov,1578745130.0,"Well you have to find a situation where the game will be checking the date to advance the frame, and for some reason after you do a VS battle it leaves the game in a state where it constantly checks this.  You can do it with the original raid den exploit too, but the VS date skip is a lot faster since you can just stay in the menu and not go back to the game after every date.  I haven't seen anyone go into the exact mechanics of why it works, I think people just discovered it does and were happy with that."

personalfinance,fdlubzx,t1_fdlsy8l,1578532679.0,"It kills me whenever someone I know is having trouble with a computer..lol, my first question is always did you try googling it, they never have, then we use google and usually fix whatever the issue was."
future_fight,fdltxxm,t3_em1iwb,1578532418.0,"That really sucks man, are you able to play games using a controller?  If so you might be able to download an emulator on PC and use that with a controller and play, I know they make controllers for one handed people too but I can't really suggest buying something like that for just one game."
pokemonrng,fdjei7k,t1_fc6snif,1578467448.0,"You are an amazing person for doing this, I can't imagine how much time it must've taken to set it up and the hit your internet must be taking..lol, but it's basically impossible to use since so many people wanna use your amazing service so I'm guessing I'ma have to try one of the other methods to find out my seed.  Thanks a lot for doing this for the community though, you're really helping people out that otherwise may have not ever been able to figure out their seed."

nosleep,fdfoy14,t3_el1uka,1578366734.0,"Wow, that was a crazy read..I can kinda understand their reasoning for removing it I think, but I think some of the other stories have gone way farther and been more messed up so I dunno..glad I was able to read it though!"
stevenuniverse,fdfnxxt,t1_fde6ay1,1578366072.0,"Yeah, but Sony has been against crossplay this whole gen."
stevenuniverse,fdfnw85,t1_fdeu0kv,1578366042.0,"That's just this gen though, last gen I'm pretty sure Microsoft were the ones that were against crossplay since they were doing better with the 360.  Just depends, if you're on top in sales you don't care about it."
stevenuniverse,fdfno44,t1_fdeoc7g,1578365895.0,"They actually made one before, I don't think it did very well though.  The Sony Ericsson Xperia Play R800i I believe, I just did a quick google search trying to find it..lol, I remember seeing a video on Youtube talking about it."
TheKingNappy,fdd6ctf,t1_fciz13t,1578296759.0,"Yeah, I was shocked he did it during the holidays and stuff..with family and friends it's tough doing stuff around New Years, plus heck, I don't know what he does for money and stuff..he probably has an actual job by now since he wasn't creating content for so long, that might be messing with his time too."
TheKingNappy,fdd6aoi,t1_fdc8d2b,1578296682.0,"Really?  The chat seemed super positive, I had to catch the VOD but seemed like most people were happy to see him back.."
ps3homebrew,fdd5sio,t3_ekna3j,1578296040.0,"I feel like that had to be an issue with the TV or the house's wiring, I don't see how the PS3 could have caused it since all you did was softmod it.  I mean, I've unplugged and plugged in hundreds of HDMI cords at least and never seen as much as a static spark..either way though, that's some bad luck.  Like the mom said I'm glad it happened to someone able to minimize the damage and not let anyone get injured.  The original PS3 might be fixable, but honestly with as cheap as PS3s are might be easiest just to save it as a replacement drive if you ever do work on them."
TwoXChromosomes,fdd55lm,t1_fdc8iw0,1578295250.0,"Honestly I'm not sure, I'm not really an expert on it.  I think it was more the data than being able to date it though.  Like, if you can show you regularly write a diary or journal or keep a calendar with key events or whatever then it helps make the information seem authentic, but even with a physical diary I don't think they go as far as dating the ink or anything like that."
AskReddit,fdb1yrh,t1_fd908rp,1578252804.0,"Haha, nice, it's been a while for me, actually been meaning to do another read through and just haven't had a chance."

CaptainSparklez,fd7ulpg,t3_ek0gub,1578210352.0,"It's hilarious reading the comments in this..lol, half the people are just laughing and plotting to force Jardon to watch Phineas and Ferb and the other half that don't watch SMPEarth are like ""huh?  Girl?  Kara?  Who's that?????""  Lol"
AskReddit,fd54guh,t1_fd53bly,1578174133.0,"Haha, I can definitely see how it could be read like that."
AskReddit,fd4uhac,t1_fd4see8,1578171219.0,"Everyone already beat me to it, but exactly what they said..lol, you can't always be watching, eventually someone would catch you with a tranq dart or something, then a bomb that is on you that if you try to tamper with explodes.  Gotta stay behind the scenes and hide it if you have abilities like this, make too much noise and suddenly you have a lot of unwanted attention and curious people."
AskReddit,fd4rx9t,t1_fd4owe4,1578170504.0,"Well pretend magic is normal, real magic gets you locked up in some lab so they can experiment on you..lol"
CrackWatch,fd4ikfu,t1_fd21g24,1578167802.0,"Lol, or someone saying they're a woman because people treat women and men differently online.  The world may never know."
tifu,fd167c4,t1_fd0t15z,1578127938.0,"Ah, I'm not as familiar with the newer ones so I wasn't aware of that, such a dumb thing to do.  That's how the VWs and Audis do one of the computers, the transmission cbx I believe, they stick it in a plastic box under the carpet.  We sold a loooot of those boxes..lol, was such a pain to find one that matched."
tifu,fd15px2,t1_fd0zas5,1578127811.0,"Yeah, a lot of that is them trying to make it harder to work on them I think, so that way people are more tempted to take them back to the dealer to have simple stuff done.  I mean, I couldn't believe it when I was helping a buddy change his battery in his Chrysler and we had to take off the wheel..lol, like, it just blew my mind.  And Subaru slipped my mind but they can be bad about it too, especially the newer ones.  I used to work on foreign cars so those and the ones I mentioned were the main ones that came to mind, then in the Toyotas and Hondas they put them behind the dash or in the kick panels where they were easy to get to and up away from moisture..Of course Toyota did have a truck that you had to remove the entire top of the motor to replace the starter on, so I guess they weren't all perfect..lol"
CaptainSparklez,fd1550u,t1_fd148mq,1578127591.0,"Unfortunately it can take awhile to get something like this taken care of, it's good that he knows about it though."
tifu,fd0ovdh,t3_ejqng2,1578121773.0,"BMWs, Mercedes, VWs, and Audis put the computer boxes in the stupidest places sometimes, it's almost like they want them to get wet and need replaced.  I remember having to pull so many of those things out from under the back seats or under the carpet in a foam box that would be soaking wet like half of the time."
todayilearned,fczfbx2,t1_fczbs6e,1578099998.0,"I kinda agree with this, but for example I used to play Yugioh Duel Links.  Sometimes if your opponent sets up a certain board, and you draw your card at the beginning of your turn and don't have an out, I'll surrender just to save us both the time so we can get on to new matches."
SwitchHaxing,fcz5r8w,t1_fcjimvn,1578094222.0,"It's probably because they know their pockets are deeper than most random people, and they know they can get away with it."
SwitchHaxing,fcz4oai,t1_fcxc6hx,1578093595.0,"This is my understanding too.  I plan on buying an older Switch when I get the money so I can have a modded one and my current unmodded one, and if I ever do wanna gen stuff just trade it over locally.  Honestly though I'm more interested in homebrew than I am in genning and stuff like that"
SwitchHaxing,fcz4e8g,t1_fcvz5qg,1578093435.0,"Looks like some people sell them on eBay for about what they cost, but some have sold for a bit of a markup, around 385.  Honestly it's worth whatever you can get for it, there's still a lot of the moddable ones floating around so most people that are super into it can probably still find one, but someone that doesn't know a lot might still be willing to pay extra for someone to do it for them."
CaptainSparklez,fcz2q9e,t1_fcyrcmn,1578092470.0,"They both still stream on Twitch, I actually saw Tucker play Minecraft a few months back and was pretty shocked..lol, but yeah, chances of getting the gang back together are pretty slim."
nottheonion,fcz2cu7,t1_fcys6qg,1578092261.0,"From what I'm seeing in other comments it seems likely that it's an expired certificate, since cash payments still work and the entire thing isn't disabled.  Probably was on someone's to do list to get it updated and they just ignored it."

todayilearned,fcyxc0y,t1_fcyvmm6,1578089140.0,Can't pain cause someone to go into a type of shock though?
CaptainSparklez,fcytl7w,t1_fcyrasr,1578086796.0,"Ya, honestly I feel like everyone's love of the series kinda screwed us tbh..lol, people aggravated Tucker so much over it I can't blame him, I'd not wanna do it just to spite the people that constantly aggravated him with the Mianite requests and Episode 3 memes."
CrackWatch,fcys9bm,t1_fcv48o4,1578085983.0,"If Fitgirl is a legitimately transgender person or I had seen something saying they had preferred pronouns I would feel bad about saying him/her, but since I haven't and I'm guessing they're just a guy that uses Fitgirl as a name I use him/her, since I'm not 100% sure if that person is a guy or girl."
CaptainSparklez,fcxf48k,t1_fcww2qf,1578061284.0,"Yeah, plus it didn't help that most of the others have stopped playing Minecraft.  The Captain seems interested in playing any kind of survival type multiplayer world with a big overarching story that gets revealed, like Mianite, but I don't think the others are really interested in the idea anymore.  I'd love to see even just a small video with Tom and Jardon and stuff though, be awesome to get Sonja and Tucker too if they were willing to do just an episode of something together, but I can understand how that could be awkward."
todayilearned,fcscmeq,t1_fcrzy8i,1577914665.0,"Yeah, it can't really.  I was just saying if they somehow proved it, people would still disagree."
tifu,fcrxxya,t3_eiiy9n,1577908145.0,"I've always been so terrified of this happening..sorry it happened to you man, but I'm glad you're ok and getting so many upvotes so other dudes can be aware it's a thing!"
todayilearned,fcp2m3q,t1_fcoyo6p,1577848562.0,"Ouch, power going out sucks.  That's the problem though, even if science did have an answer some people would disagree with it I think.  It can be hard to convince people, even with the most logical and sound arguments..some people stick to their point of view out of stubbornness, even if they see how they may be wrong just so they don't have to admit it."
todayilearned,fcp2gze,t1_fcoygzz,1577848438.0,"Science can show that it logically isn't wrong, but some people may still think that it's wrong.  You even said killing an embryo, that's what most people think of it as, killing, even though it's just a bundle of cells early on like that."
todayilearned,fcovy0g,t1_fcov64a,1577843051.0,"I mean, I think we should study stem cells but I could easily see a non religious person thinking that it was weird because it's ""killing babies"" or something like that, even though it's not.

TwoXChromosomes,fc5cdo0,t3_eg8aob,1577453149.0,"Honestly, no one's gonna care.  I'm a guy, but I've seen a few different, uh, styles of equipment down there..and never been with a girl and thought ""No way, her labia is way too big, this relationship is over!"".  Everyone's self conscious about everything, and since genitals are something you don't really show off very often and a lot of the ones you see online are the nicer ones it kinda makes us think everyone's perfect.  But, besides the looks part, if it's actually causing pain and stuff maybe you should talk to someone, and like others have said definitely should start seeing a gynecologist.  It seems like those are very important for women to see, if anything's wrong it's always good to know as soon as possible."
aww,fc5a3b5,t1_fc57lky,1577450600.0,"Haha, god, I've seen way too many jacks fail to ever do that..I always at least grab a rock or take the wheel off and stick it under the car or something.  Can't blame ya for being in a rush though"

It's been cold as heck here lately and while I don't really spoof anymore on my main because I'm being overly cautious with the account, I don't blame anyone for wanting to spoof.  However, you're salty as hell dude..lol, Gotcha has probably missed shinies, it tosses one ball and that's it, if you're gonna autowalk and gotcha you gotta accept that you might be missing stuff.  And you can't be mad about rng when that's literally one of the mechanics of the game..lol, shinies mean nothing, they're just for show for who's the luckiest.
