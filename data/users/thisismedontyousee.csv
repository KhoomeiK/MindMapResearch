Many have been lost but none have been destroyed.  And they provide hours of chewing fun and amusing noises.  Also the black kongs for aggressive chewers.   In the past she has also liked the black rubber tires."

dogs,fcmp7tk,t3_ehsuwa,1577785383.0,My GSD had 1/3 of a cheesecake for Thanksgiving as we were welcoming our guests...  memorable poops.  Had to get out the sawdust.
dogs,fcmomza,t3_ehxqmq,1577784553.0,"Although I admit I don't admire either pitties or chihuahuas (the most commonly seen dogs in our shelters) I am always in awe of a well trained dog.  The problems I have seen in dog parks haven't been from pitties, but simply from a variety of owners of various kinds of dogs.  My daughter loves 'em though because she is a sucker for dogs that like to cuddle."
aww,fcmmohk,t1_fcmj0nn,1577781848.0,"My dog cannot go on Amtrak in any way (65 lb German Shepherd).  Not with the people, not with luggage/cargo.  At least those owners who suddenly develop a mental condition (certified by their on-line analyst!) requiring an emotional support pet on the plane can't do that on the train.  Only applies to housing and air travel."

I am in Kalb's district and have an in-law unit behind me, rented for 40 years.  If my tenant moves, I will not rent again.  Renting on my own home is a lifetime commitment now, like a marriage where only one spouse has the right to get a divorce."
