LifeProTips,ffbu4po,t1_ff9dq5h,1579782814.0,"You’re right about the **X**X. What I meant to write was possible hair loss, not no hairloss. 

But when speaking of dominant genes, they don’t always express themselves. Brown eyed women can have blue eyed children, if she’s a carrier of blue eyes. Recessive winning out over dominant in the gamble of phenotypes. It all depends on what the father carries.

For example, my mother has brown eyes. Her father has brown, her mother has blue.

Consider brown eyes (Br) and blue (Bl). Very simply, as we’re disregarding the chances of green and hazel eye colours:

(Br)(Br)+ (Bl)(Bl) = Brown eyed Mother (Br)(Bl); Brown is dominant over Blue, despite blue being just as prominent. 

*(Br)(Bl) + (Br)(Bl) would also give a Brown eyed child.*

(Bl)(Bl) + (Bl)(Bl) = my blue eyed father (Bl)(Bl)

(Br)(Bl) Mother + (Bl)(Bl) Father = Blue eyed children. 

Blue outnumbers brown in probability, making blue eyed children the norm. Brown eyed children are still possible, but much less likely. Brown eyed grandchildren will be born if the other parent is (Br)(Br), or (Br)(Bl) if the grandmother’s brown gene was passed down... but this is where genetic probability starts getting complicated. 

You can also inherit hairloss from your father, through his genetic roulette. But it is more likely to get it directly from your mother. 

It all comes down to, 1) parental carrier(s) and 2) how many people in your family have hairloss, which correlates directly to your own risk of having genetic hairloss."
