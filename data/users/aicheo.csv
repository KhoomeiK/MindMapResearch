Advice,ff1ulu1,t1_ff123od,1579486543.0,"That's an option, but as someone who had a terrible living situation for only 3 months, its unsustainable. Having to leave the house all day and eventually trudging back to the equivalent of Hell is not worth it. Your happiness deteriorates. I can't imagine doing this for potentially years."

introvert,ff1qd0r,t3_eqlmb9,1579483846.0,"I'm sorry. I've lost a parent and its stressful. In the moment it doesnt feel like it, but when you leave that era of your life, you realise how much pressure it was. The fact that you made it through hours of small talk after such a loss is pretty resilient. I hope I dont sound patronising, sorry. I can relate, I didnt know any of my dads family but they still expected me to talk to them about him. What is there to say yknow?"

socialanxiety,fep0ecb,t1_feniuum,1579309339.0,"I'm not sure if you have problems with this yourself.. but I work in food service and honestly, I never think anything of any customer who stutters or accidentally says the wrong thing. There's no judgement, most of the time I'm thinking about what I'm going to do when my shift is over! I'm sorry if you go through this though. I used to be super anxious about ordering things but over time I dont think twice about it. Most workers dont blink an eye at me mispronouncing or fumbling my words."

AnimalCrossing,feetqey,t1_feem656,1579041014.0,"Are they though? The entire purpose of DLC is that it gives developers more time to develop content after the game is released. It seems the trend now is that DLC is released a month or two after the game, which we all know is way too short of a time to finish an entire DLC. All it is nowadays is a way to get consumers to spend more money for the same size product.

Nintendo has made it obvious they intend to continue doing this, a la Pokemon Sword and Shield."
flipline,fe6qku6,t3_enzb46,1578900756.0,"Tbh most of them are relatively in the same league. I would recommend pancakeria or hot doggeria since they have an extra station for drinks, which improves the games very much!"

Cooking,fdt63ua,t3_emvvmn,1578712408.0,"I've seen this complaint so much and it honestly bothers me.. it is annoying, I'll admit, to have walls of text. But nothing comes for free. The fact that people online are generous enough to develop recipes and post them for you for free, no transaction, is good enough. I find it odd to complain when you can circumvent this problem by buying a recipe book. Either pay with patience or cash."

FinalFantasy,fd9xgrp,t1_fd75u2s,1578239148.0,Magazines often use English on covers even if it's not catered to a native English speaking audience. You'll even see it in many Asian magazines.
GirlGamers,fd2rur4,t3_ej4yxf,1578151045.0,"Female characters I find are almost always hyper sexualised so I always pick male. Male clothing is almost always better in games too.. I hate it. Like no, I dont want to play as a straight up porn actress vs a normal person. If the males were also sexualised it would be one thing but we all know how seldom that happens."

depression,fd24lwm,t3_ejosz9,1578141605.0,"I definitely feel the same way you do. A lot. But the truth is. None of us are good at anything without hours of practice and effort. The beginning is painful. It hurts to be bad at something you want to be good at. But what use is it giving up? Would you rather improve a tiny tiny bit everyday, or just be stagnant? You dont see the results over night, it takes months.. even years. But every single day counts. 

It's easy to compare yourself to others progress. Sometimes when I see super skilled artists and singers it hurts.. because I feel like I'll never be on their level. But you have to realise that they got to the place they are by DOING it. Picasso didnt become an amazing artist by not doing art. He did it all day everyday. 

Even if its 20 minutes a day, it counts. I'm sorry if this message comes off as condescending or rude, I definitely dont mean it that way. I try to tell myself these things."
