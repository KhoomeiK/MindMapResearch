todayilearned,ffbpi55,t1_ff9o77o,1579777233.0,"You're talking about themes and imagery again, though. You can't make The Irishman a movie that's fun for both adults and kids; not because the filmmakers didn't try hard enough, but because the themes of the movie either don't appeal to kids or they're too complicated for kids to understand.

The same doesn't apply the other way around. Adults *understand* kids movies' concepts.

I'm not asking for a miracle, here, my dude. There are basic storytelling and filmmaking decisions that could've made it into a better movie without changing the themes or the imagery, without making it less *for-kids* than it was intended to be.

They fucked up.

It being for kids doesn't mean they can do no wrong; besides which, I've literally seen people say they brought their kids to the movie and *their kids didn't like it*. Does that constitute a failure, in your eyes? Can *anything* constitute a failure, or can you spin more apologetics for shitty filmmaking to somehow make it so that nothing the movie has chosen to do could possibly be wrong?"
Vampyr,ffbp3cq,t1_ffbk9o6,1579776630.0,"Yeah it telegraphs that only if you found that note.

And otherwise everything you've seen about Jonathan using his psychic powers on other people seems either inoffensive or positive.

AND AGAIN, the options as laid out to the player seemed to be ""Let her be killed by a vampire she's blackmailing"", ""kill her yourself"", or ""try to save her from the situation with psychic powers"".

Honestly I wouldn't have cared so much if she weren't literally the central pillar holding together the entire district. If the game had given me this lesson with a lesser character beforehand - like Clay, for instance - I would've gone into the situation knowing ""Hey when I used this on Clay he seemed much worse for the wear, there could be some backlash for having done this, maybe it's not a great option"", in which case my perceived options were still otherwise shitty!

It's not an enjoyable segment of the game for me."
Vampyr,ffa0tvm,t1_ff9nou8,1579725602.0,">Mesmerising someone to let you into their house is different from trying to make them forget certain things. Which is what you try to do but being that it is an ability Johnathan has never done before it is going to go badly and backfire, in this case wiping her mind completely.

Then it should've telegraphed that ahead of time so I could make an informed decision, weighed the potential risks of what I was doing versus the potential benefits.

I had the option of just letting her go and continuing to do what she was doing, *but she was blackmailing a fucking vampire*, I assumed the *consequences to that decision* was that she'd eventually just get fucking murdered for doing that. That's what made sense to me.

So the options, as given by the game, seemed to be ""Ask her to resign"" which she seemed wholly unwilling to consider so why even bother telling her to do it, ""Kill her"" - which I didn't want to do, she was the pillar for the community, and ""Use my psychic vampire powers to make her forget that she was blackmailing a vampire so she could continue being a pillar without being a target of eventual murder"".

Those were the options presented to me. It said nothing about the dangers of using mesmerize on her, he had no internal dialogue about how inexperienced he was with the ability, nobody he'd ever used it on had ever displayed any negative effects at all - hell, even Clay, who I actually fully mind-controlled to follow me to a location where I could decide to kill him or not, suffered no ill effects from me having done so! He actually said he felt great afterward!

THAT'S NOT HOW YOU TELEGRAPH CONSEQUENCES LIKE THAT."
Vampyr,ff9zv71,t1_ff9u8vm,1579725037.0,"Maybe I wasn't clear: I'm all for consequences, so long as they're understandable and not seemingly random. For all the connection it has to my decisions I might as well be getting blamed for a meteor falling on someone's head. I can't feel bad about that. I can't be made to feel bad about that, and the game very clearly wants me to, so I can only take the game less seriously as a result."

todayilearned,ff8np93,t1_ff818al,1579687740.0,"You're actually arguing for movies to be shittier.

You agree that movies targeted to kids *can* be considered good by adults. Why wouldn't you want them to be?

I'm not saying they have to have adult themes or be rated R or have violence, I'm saying the plot should make some kind of sense and the characters should be some kind of consistent, as though they were written and made by people who knew what the fuck they were doing as storytellers. That way people grow up knowing what good, consistent storytelling looks like.

They can have it be boring to adults. They can have it be pandering to kids. They can do those things while also having it be a *good movie*.

Unless it's being made by a studio that, for some reason, is incapable of writing a movie that makes any amount of sense. In which case why are they being given a budget and a team of CGI and Robert Fucking Downey Junior and a series of screenwriters and producers and a director? Why not just make funny noises on screen for an hour with shadow puppets? If all you want is to placate the low expectations of children, you don't need to make a feature length AAA movie to do it.
