His kindergarten sounded like it was opposite of what yours is like, I felt they didn’t give them enough work, not hard work but they basically just let them play and color all damn day and the kids weren’t being challenged at all.

It’s a much needed break from reality. In my dreams I can do whatever I want with zero repercussions. I sometimes have dreams where I actually beat the shit out of annoying ass customers at work. Or that one girl I find really attractive? She mine. I used to hate my dreams about falling but now it’s like a skydiving trip and it’s sweeeeet. Gotta learn how to use your dreams to your benefit.

AskReddit,ff8x0k4,t3_esau5y,1579698856.0,"WW1 was a cluster fuck of a shit show. What started as a conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary quickly exploded into a global conflict. Mainly due to the fact that Germany saw an opportunity to deal some blows to France and Russia after they would most definitely back Serbia if Austria-Hungary retaliated for the assassination of the Arch Duke. 

Austria-Hungary had every right to retaliate for the assassination, and most of the world was sympathetic to their cause at first, but as time went on with no retaliation, that sympathy waned. This is where Germany comes into play. At first Wilhelm was egging A-H on to start a war due to the fact that Russia and France were currently weak and it was the best time for them to fight. Everyone believed a war between Germany and Russia was inevitable so they figured get it done now before 1917 when the Russian military would become much more powerful. 

As time went on Wilhelm of Germany changed his mind and urged A-H to find peace with Serbia but his messages were ignored. This was all part of the July Crisis. As fighting broke out, the US remained neutral, only giving aid to the Allied forces. Up until Germany decided to start attacking neutral shipping lanes. Serbia had been defeated in 1915 but by that point a full scale global conflict had blossomed. The US discovered that Germany was attempting to back Mexico in an attempt to start a war on our southern border. This would guarantee we would stay out of Europe so Germany would have a better chance at victory. So we went to war with Germany.  

IMO there is no right side of war. It should be last resort when all else has failed, but too often do leaders resort to armed conflict to settle disputes when diplomatic talks and compromises could definitely handle most problems.  HOWEVER, I would say we were on the right side of the war. Germany was being very aggressive at the time, when talks would’ve settled the dispute in the Balkans, Germany pushed for war instead.  

TL;DR...No the US was not on the wrong side. We were provoked by an overly aggressive Germany and we had to stand our ground."
