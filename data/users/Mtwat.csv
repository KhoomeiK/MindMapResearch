BoneAppleTea,ffiw780,t1_ffioql2,1579984188.0,"It's also the cost of the computer system and the cost to install plus the cost of maintance. Plus more difficult to determine factors like if customers will shop more or less frequently, if a machine can upsell efficiently and the volume of orders. Most likely you'll get your return on investment but a 30 year roi isn't really worth the effort."

I get that they need to condense stuff by cutting out scenes and merging characters. I also get this show doesn't have GoT budget so the cgi has to be used sparingly/is less impressive. But damn I really wish they hadn't butchered it like this. So, so many changes from the book with the ciri plotline and just gutting the dragon hunt like that. I didn't have high hopes for the show but have enjoyed it nonetheless. Guess I'm just disappointed that my personal favorite was a dud episode."
