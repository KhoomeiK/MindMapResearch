We are no longer a faceless enemy and they struggle with trying to justify it in their weird way.



If they can make people like us as the enemy they don't have to really think. They can continue to blindly follow their beliefs. I know when I came out as non-binary and into girls to my mom I overheard her say ""Where did I go wrong?""

Maybe everyone isn't a 10, but there are people who are born with diseases or deformities that really alter a person's face and body. Then you think of how easy it is to ruin a face with acid thrown in the face or someone punching you. There is no perfection as many religious claim and even if this life was a test, having someone look ugly is a pretty sick thing for a higher power to do.



Outside of religious, I knew pretty young that some people were either lucky to have great, good, or okay looks, or unlucky and a person has huge nose, weird eyebrows, slight deformity, or major aesthetic issue. I find the quote ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" interesting. It's used as a defense when someone is being attacked for their looks and yet the person is merely being honest. I use to think it was all about character and the physical played no role in life or relationships. I woke up to that realization long ago. Yes, handsome and gorgeous people can be assholes or lack a personality, but not everyone is like that. Even unattractive people can be just as blank and boring. If someone is physically attracted to a person or a type, there's not much that can change it. You can force yourself to be attracted to something you're not. Nor is it good for the relationship on a mental/emotional level. Lots of people get married and together with others that society or their family expect them too, rather than being true to themselves. I don't think it's wrong if someone expresses they aren't attracted to a person or they don't feel an attraction. I'm sick of everyone having to lie for the sake of other's feelings. In the modern age it's gotten worse. People need to stop taking things personally and deal with reality. Life is shit. Most people don't always get what they want. Most of the world is either gonna hate you or not give a fuck. It's important for each individual to find those worthy of being around them, rather than concerned that a certain someone didn't fall madly in love with them and to maybe try to improve one's appearance, not in a shallow sense, but make oneself presentable, rather than looking like a bum or a slob."
