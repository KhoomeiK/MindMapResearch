Common uses of the word would be ""oof-bag"" or ""oof-bird"" meaning sources of money. A feathery oof-bird is a large source of money. An oofless man is poor and an oofy man rich. A thriving economy makes the oof-bird walk, but if you want to launder money, you might need to pad the oof."

All Muslim women are not living under that fear. You are very, very mistaken. Do you even know any Muslims? I live in an area with a very large Muslim community and I am friends with and work with many members of the Muslim community. Your statements have no merit and do not match reality.

To your point though, do Christian boys feel great pressure to be heterosexual? Should being heterosexual be outlawed because of it? Some Christian boys are killed when they are found out to be gay. It is a very toxic Christian practice that these boys are pressured to be a certain way when that's not what they want.

My point is, people should be allowed to choose how they want to practice their religion. If someone is forcing someone to do something (or not do something), then that is wrong."
nonononoyes,feh1wld,t1_fegyvp6,1579107425.0,"People choose to wear religious garments all the time.

There are all sorts of dress associated with religious traditions - there is no reason to deprive someone of the choice to practice their religious beliefs and traditions. If they are being FORCED to, that is another issue entirely, but that is not the case for the VAST majority.

There are Christian boys that are killed because they choose a lifestyle that does not conform with their parents beliefs, but that doesn't mean we should ban a Christian lifestyle. Some countries even enforce the killing of gay men due to religious beliefs."

Dear Mr. Perez,


Please explain to me why you believe that it is fair to raise the polling requirement for the next debate, when there have been no qualifying polls since before the most recent debate. The purpose of these debates is to inform people, and when people are informed, their opinions change. All of the candidates we saw on stage in December have been taking in cash from supporters - their supporters want their candidates to be heard. To increase a metric where you already know the outcome is unfair, and undemocratic. Let the people of TODAY decide who is on the stage, NOT the people of YESTERDAY. The debate has changed people's minds - and if it hasn't, your debates have failed.


This is the first time I have ever registered as a Democrat. I voted for Obama the first time around, however I typically vote Libertarian. I refused to vote for either Hillary or Trump. This time, one of your candidates is not like the others, and his voice needs to be heard. I fully intend to vote for him and have been encouraging everyone I know to do the same. Do not allow the DNC to fail Democracy.


Thank you,
