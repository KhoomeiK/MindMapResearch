Mine did this too.  I was in college taking 22 units a semester (which is about 1.5x the normal units one takes to be full-time, and it's because my parents were pressuring me to graduate in 3 years instead of 4).  I was also working 2-3 part-time jobs doing lab work or tutoring.  And I was being charged $500/mo.  I was told this charge was for my ""health insurance"", even though I was still covered by my dad's insurance; for tuition (my parents hid from me the fact that my great-grandma left me a $10k inheritance which covered my tuition), and for my ""general expenses"" even though I was rarely home and their house was paid off.  Then they acted like I was ""bad with money"" because I couldn't build savings.  I could totally understand if they were struggling, financially, but they were already multi-millionaires at the time.

> (by the way I didn't see a dime of the $750/month I paid for two years; I've heard of parents that start a savings account for their kids to help them start out with the rent they collected, not mine)

Me either.  I've heard the same thing you did about some parents giving it back.  I envy those parents' kids.  Now, someday I have a sizeable inheritance coming my way, and I'm sure my parents figured I'd get it back that way, so it's not a total loss.  However, when I was younger and had just moved out on my own and was really, really struggling, I would have really liked to have had a ""nest egg"" savings for emergencies.  I could have used that money to further my career and help my husband further his.  Instead, we have to wait until both my parents die.

My inlaws had a much better approach.  They were about as wealthy as my parents, but had very different attitudes.  They insisted my husband and his siblings worked for their ""fun"" money but provided money for gas, food, and other necessities.  They would monitor their kids' credit cards and if they felt the spending was getting out of hand, they'd sit their kids down and explain the problem and the kids would adjust their spending.  Their kids all moved out with sizeable savings accounts."

For what it's worth, OP, what you're describing is what a good chunk of the Millennial generation is going through in their careers, due to all of us graduating into a recession.  So, you're not alone.  

That being said, I totally understand the feeling that you're ""behind"".  My parents kept me extremely dependent on them in my college years.  I was working 2-3 part-time jobs while going to school with a heavy course-load, plus my Nmom piled the lion's share of the housework and errands on me, all the while charging me for as much money as she could get away with.  Between taking far too many classes (parents insisted I graduate in less than 4 years because reasons) and the housework, I didn't have time to get a full-time job.  Not doing so while in college was a real bad career move for me, since in STEM you're expected to have experience to get experience.  My parents also conditioned me to be terrified of leaving home, and that evolved into a fear of taking a job far away from them, which prevented me from applying to jobs out of state.  Because of that, my first few jobs were terrible and my career was stagnated.  I didn't get out of the stagnation until 2014--a good 7 years out of college.

We said if he was coming to Christmas, we weren't because we could not stay civil around him.  My parents acted like we were being immature about this, and said if we didn't come we would never get the presents they bought us.  They were literally trying to force us to come and pretend we're all a happy family by threatening to take away presents!  He ended up not coming, so we went and my niece noticed her cheater dad had presents under my parents' tree.  She asked if she could take them home to him and my parents got all pissy and said, ""No--he didn't show up for Christmas so he doesn't get presents.""  It was like they didn't care what my BIL did to my sister; they just cared that everyone wasn't playing nice like they wanted.  And they were using lack of presents to ""punish"" those who didn't come."

Oh man the sleep anxiety is real.  Up until college my bedtime was 8-9pm.  I could never fall asleep before 10-11pm.  Boredom triggers my anxiety, and that was 1-2 hours of boredom, every single night.  As an adult, it got to the point where I started feeling panicked if I was unable to fall asleep--and the way I got over that was to simply get up and read a book until I felt ready for sleep.  Having the power to do that now has helped immeasurably.  

Like you, I get anxious if I can't sleep and have to get up real early.  Sort of turns into an insomniac feedback loop.  :-/"

Same.  My anxiety disorder got real bad during the 8 financially hard years I went through.  All it took to start improving was getting my current job, back in 2016.  I was able to start thriving, not just surviving, and having an actual emergency fund gave me peace of mind.  I was able to work on my anxiety and do fun things and not worry about whether I'd be homeless a few months down the line and that did wonders."

My theory on this is that they need everyone in the house to fit into a certain ""box"".  You, as the child, fit into the ""child"" box.  They can't handle the change in roles when you become more of an adult, because to them this feels like they're losing power over you, so they try to stuff you back into the ""child"" box.

raisedbynarcissists,fdoctrk,t1_fdnhabq,1578602823.0,"This was pretty much my Nmom when I was age 8 to 23.  Could not *stand* it if I was awake after a certain time of night.  Even tried to enforce a 10pm bedtime when I was in college, and pulled this same BS with not letting me read in my own room.  She'd bust in when she saw the faint light under my door.  When I tried reading in my personal bathroom she'd see *that* light and wait a bit outside to see if I was actually going to the bathroom or reading.  Then she'd tell me to go back to bed, wait for me to come out and take the book away.  By college age, I started refusing to let her take the book away.  Also learned to bury myself so deep under covers that you couldn't see the light under my door.  This was swelteringly hot in the summer, when my cheap-ass parents often refused to turn on the A/C in 90-deg heat at night, but worth it to not be lying in bed awake for hours.  

She'd still randomly come into my room, though, to check, even if there was no light, because I guess it had been too long since she'd last caught me and she was suspicious.  I learned to listen for her footsteps so I could turn off the flashlight quickly before she opened the door.  

It is insane to me that I was doing this in my 20s."

I'd just started dating my husband and we were crazy about each other and while I stipulated no PIV, I was A-OK with oral and manual.
