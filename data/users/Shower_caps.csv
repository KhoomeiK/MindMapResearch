thesims,fei6tvh,t1_feh0e6z,1579131576.0,"Yes exactly and I personally like to buy or subscribe to certain magazines based on my sims personalities more than anything, it just adds more dimension to my gameplay. A few of her friends have the same magazine in their rooms so they have even more things in common to talk about.

 It‚Äôs these little details that keeps me hooked on sims 2 to this day, I legit still find new things in game play, it‚Äôs great."

houston,fdzldef,t1_fdwi115,1578791305.0,"I agree with you but this discussion is about the literal rock n roll genre, not just the spirit of it. I‚Äôm rooting for the actual genre to come back in an evolved form which is the only way it will make a comeback anyway and not just the spirit of it blended into already established genres. I love hip hop and rap and I‚Äôd feel the exact the way if these genres were experiencing the slump in popular media that rock is experiencing right now."
AskWomen,fdw0ssd,t3_en3z0l,1578753836.0,"It‚Äôs rare to have one where neither develops feelings.

I just found out he is married and my first and only thought was ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, good for him!!‚Äù 

This was over a decade ago but now I would not be in a FWB situation just because of the prevalence of STD/STI‚Äôs and the emergence of super strains, it too risky now IMO."

houston,fdvsmfe,t1_fdq9vsa,1578751107.0,"It makes me deeply sad that (more real) rock music in general is not a popular music genre anymore. 

Some people think it will never make a comeback but I think it will eventually. IMO, it‚Äôs potential to mold, reflect and influence popular culture or at least youth culture organically is just too powerful for it to not eventually make a comeback at just the right time but we‚Äôll see."
