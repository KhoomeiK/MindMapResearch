That could also enable MS to block competition. Think back to when MS office was released with the new document format .docx and they made that the default format. If you did not have the newest version of office you could not open it and MS did not release a converter or update for the older versions for over a year.

I was in college at the time and most of the documents from teachers were in the new format that 90% of students could not open. I quickly found that open office could convert the documents, I petitioned the university (NKU) to install open office on all public computers so we could open the documents for class. They actually did get it installed.
