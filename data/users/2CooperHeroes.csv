The vet cleared her to let the skin shed naturally and watch for infection. Shes fine, and I promise I didn't do this to her for aesthetics."

bulletjournal,ff9auj0,t1_ff9a7ou,1579708766.0,"Same! I work in an office setting and audiobooks are my main listening fodder while I go about my day. I use Libby and it's through my local library. Is Overdrive connected to libraries too? I love Libby, but the wait list for popular titles is insane. I had to wait seven months to have The Shining and I finished it in three days."

We alternated who visited whom on the weekends, but she CONSTANTLY guilted me into splitting my weekends with them. And I mostly cleaned and cooked when I was at their house. It sucked. I felt like an adult with none of the freedoms. And it took her a few years to understand that I wasn't going to come home for a visit every single weekend when I moved in with my boyfriend."

AskReddit,fcxi7v0,t3_ejdlbw,1578063571.0,"When an ex-boyfriend sent me really sexually graphic texts as a joke with his buddies. He was literally trying to bait me into sexting him for a laugh with his group of friends. When I called him out for it he broke up with me through text because I was a ""prude"". 

I'd pretty much let all that go and moved on; I chalked it up to a guy who had issues with alcohol and refused to admit he was a highly functioning alcoholic. Then he texts me out of the blue over a year and a half later, for reasons unknown, to lie to me that he was getting deployed. The dude wasn't even active military at that point, and the day he texted me was the day my dad was released from the hospital after a stroke, and we'd been involved in a car accident that totaled my parents vehicle and I was the driver. How he just knew to text me after the worst day in my life at that point, I have no idea. I hadn't even told anyone any of the shit that went down except for my closest friends and boyfriend at the time, and none of them had connections to the guy. If I could have spit acid through text, I would have. After verbally assaulting him through text, he tucked tail and skulked away. 

How heinous people like that exist in the world, I have no idea."

AskReddit,fcuh71z,t3_eixc75,1577980876.0,"I made an account on POF after a truly horrendous breakup. I went on a few casual dates, but then met my now husband. We got serious pretty quick, and did long distance during my final year of University. I moved in with him the day I graduated, then we got married a year and a half later (took a while to convince us a wedding was needed, then we had to find a way to do it as cheap and easy as possible. Not as easy as you'd think). A month and a half after our wedding we found out we were pregnant with twins. I have no idea what I did to deserve him. He's the best partner I could ask for and an even better dad."
TwoXChromosomes,fc9qsco,t3_egrw73,1577556798.0,"I got mine done with no major issues. But my husband was at the consult with me, backing up every reason I wanted a tubal ligation. A) I didn't want more kids. B) I would be considered an extremely high risk pregnancy with zero access to medical care for premature labor and delivery, which is in my history (our local hospital doesn't even deliver babies or have a PEDS unit and the nearest NICU facility is over an hour away.) C) I can't afford another baby. D) I have no space for another baby. E) I literally didn't want more kids. 

But my OB did make a fuss about what would happen if my husband and I separated. Wouldn't my future spouse potentially want more kids? To which I replied with, ""I'm 28. Around here, my options for spouses without kids of their own is very limited. And I repeat, I don't want to get pregnant again."" 

Plus I have real good insurance this year, which I don't know if I will have next year. Getting my husband a vasectomy is under $500. If he wants one, we can save for that one. Mine on the other hand? Nope."
