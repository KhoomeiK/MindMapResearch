OverwatchUniversity,feadasm,t3_eo5rpr,1578947223.0,Gains and losses in SR are different and different for the worse I'm afraid. Ive seen streamers lose 4 games and win 6 games and only be 15-20 SR above where the started. As far as leavers I have not experienced it or maybe just haven't noticed it. The only time I truly care about SR is when it changes that little symbol to a shinier badge than the previous but this does seem to be a weird design or bug whatever it is. Winning more games than losses but not having as much to show for it as the losses. Even if it is to punish losing. It does not feel rewarding to see the low amount of change it has on the SR.

Competitiveoverwatch,fcu3f0r,t1_fctydx9,1577971411.0,"Something like community made teams, tournaments and scrims that are completely separate to overwatch and you have to go looking to find them. It would be great if it was a part of the game so many more people could learn this other aspect of the game. I think this is highly unlikely for them to try this right now. With Overwatch 2 and a smaller development team trying to work with what they have"
