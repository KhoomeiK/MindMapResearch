facepalm,febnygr,t1_febn4tx,1578960880.0,"Hijacking my own comment-my favorite part is where you can hear excerpts from Reagan’s speeches as he twists himself around while the press coverage proves his earlier speech to be a lie. “My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.”"
facepalm,febn4tx,t3_eo6zvh,1578960614.0,Killer Mike’s “Reagan” has more on this time period too for RTJ fans : https://youtu.be/6lIqNjC1RKU

DryAgedBeef,fdcm1w0,t1_fdcltq4,1578278268.0,Sounds great. Please post updates! :)
DryAgedBeef,fdchonf,t3_ekksmj,1578275154.0,"So, is it done?  Looks awesome!"
pickling,fd2w68j,t1_fd2v6fg,1578152215.0,"I usually have mine on my kitchen counter, so I just check them daily. You may or may not need to do this, just depends on the activity of your ferment."
pickling,fczcklo,t1_fcynksz,1578098203.0,"You may need to “burp” the jars as the fermentation gets under way and begins to produce CO2.   If you’re not using an airlock or open jar. Have fun, it’s really easy and enjoyable."
AnimalTracking,faoxtfr,t3_ea90ay,1576275052.0,"Cool find, where are you?"
