AskWomen,ffjtayc,t3_ettozy,1580006364.0,"I am a quilter and often get together with friends and have a sewing day. We share projects we worked on, problems we might be having and swap fabric. Once or twice a year we go on a retreat for a few days. We go to a great local inn, they take great care of us, feed us, make our beds, we just chat and sew. Perhaps shop. It’s so much fun being with like minded women, as quilting can be such a solitary pursuit,"

Took nothing, walked the dog in the morning to clear it and just rested and watched project runway tonight. Hope you feel better soon. Only had migraines when I was pregnant, about five in the nine months."

quilting,ff4qjpc,t1_feylkwj,1579570040.0,Some times using a fabric because if it’s subject matter is tricky. If you can’t find one that works with the front put some-on the back. Or make the label in a octopus shape and just applique it on. Did you try spoonflower for octopus fabric?

bulletjournal,fevozr1,t3_eqosqu,1579399826.0,"I like it! Can I make a helpful suggestion, buy a squeegee from the dollar store and wipe down yr shower walls every time you shower. Prevents mould and in my area with hard water prevents build up. I have been doing this for over thirty years and rarely have to clean my bathtub/ shower. Occasionally I spray with some cleaner scrub a bit and rinse."
quilting,fevn5f4,t3_eqikis,1579399218.0,"It’s really a lovely palette, not sure the octopuses in the centre match. I might change two opposing sections to a dark value to draw attention to that centre."

educationalgifs,fepbqlr,t3_eq0m1t,1579316640.0,"Let me tell you in southern Ontario, I crave the sunny days in winter, I often would hustle my son or old dad and we sit on the porch in a perfect sunny but out of the wind spot, blankets in laps and let our faces absorb those warm rays. The science is all well and good but how life affirming and uplifting those days were."
