mealtimevideos,ff89jlz,t1_ff7ps81,1579670014.0,"Oh well, you can see how a large number of the population no longer being viable reproductive humans is an issue right? So keeping that number at around one-tenth is optimal enough. So long as birthrate is enough to replace death rate everything is good. Maybe this allows for a larger number but I can't say that with certainty. And of course, once we master exo-wombs it no longer matters as we would be able to artificially grow humans. At that point, anyone can be whatever they want to be.

Really its as if people read my comment and think I want to oppress people. What I want is a continuation of the species, anything that *could* be an issue needs to be examined closely and carefully. Thus why a growing number is not optimal, as exponential returns are... undesired. That said, so long as there are genetic females that can and want to IVF that number is debatable. But of course many will react emotionally to what I say, instead of logically.

But you do raise an important point since society is growing more accepting. (again, for history does love to repeat itself.) The number of individuals that go into that percentage increase, as well as getting a more accurate count as more reveal themselves. I wonder if this can help with the number of orphaned children as there is no reason why same-sex couples or all other inclusions of LGBTQ can't raise children. Then again, would this create an increase of children that grow up wanting to emulate parents? There is insufficient data to answer this, but it should be tried.

As Kant said we have a categorical imperative to try and do what is our moral obligation as derived from reason. And reasoning says that as odds go, it would decrease suffering while it increases happiness. So long as this is not a danger to the reproductive ability of the nation or species at large it should be persued."

They only live because we eat them. Without us the number of farm animals would be rather small. If we suddenly found a way to produce meat indistinguishable from the real deal and it was fast. Then billions would be culled one last time and we would perhaps have populations of farm animals in the hundeeds of thousands if that many. 

You do understand that right?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdwv8x0,t1_fdwlizz,1578762657.0,"funny I did not mention animal fat, I mentioned protein. Oh I don't believe we need little meat, I know we need little. And to answer you, yes I consume a small portion of meat. I try and keep to about 2100 calories with a large portion being Carbohydrates and Sugars, followed by fats and proteins, then fiber. All that healthy human needs, as close the quantities required. Its not perfect, but it gets the job done properly. Overeating is the biggest issue we have. Some days those numbers are skewed one way or another, perhaps more fats one day or more fiber, etc. 

I am not making these choices based on morality though. Just on what is best for myself nutritionally. For example today I had, rice, beans, potatoes, olives, apple and eggs. Some of those foods are redundant but complementary, however the eggs are indispensable and cannot be replaced. Sure beans are providing a large source of protein but not all the amino acids. Eggs complete the package and makes it easier for the evolved intestinal system we humans have to obtain and process it all. 

If you are trying to ask how I feel about animals. Then the answer you want is, they are here to serve us because we can make them do that. It is not moral, but it is the answer. If you are asking if I agree on our current treatment, no I do not, we should scale it back significantly, but we cannot get rid of it, our technology is not at that point yet."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdwct1i,t1_fdv5seh,1578757428.0,"Lol, no. Humans need animal protein in their diet. Id say a diet based mainly on plants while having an intake of animal protein is the best solution. Because not having those amino acids.... well its like slowly, very slowly strangling your brain. People dont notice the cognitive damage since its so small, but over time it accumulates. 

After years the likelyhood of having certain issues increases. And unfortunately since people dont want to confront their beliefs they ignore any signs of anything being wrong. Most people default to tribalism again and again and allow the locus of control to reside with the group they identify with. Then they take in whatever the group says and parrot it without thinking.

People may want to argue the morality of dietary systems. But ultimately at the current point of our technology animals must die for us to live properly. However, i'll concede that we could cut back on about 92% of meat production and consumption and still be unaffected by lets call it inproper nutrition. Plants alone are not good nor all that moral either.

There are ethical concerns in the production of certain plant foodstuffs like almonds, avocados, bananas, etc. So perfect solutions do not exist, and while we will certainly be judged by future generations, the unpleasant answer is that we are all guilty of allowing things to get this bad. And our personal choices do not exonerate us in any way. Because at the end of the day we chose the easy way out and did nothing of real value. If we truly wanted to change things... well we humans only really understand one language. See French revolution."

In fact, there is a strong possibility Mars hosted life at some point, and we may yet find fossils there. And Europa almost certainly has life in its oceans.

As for every species gone being a loss, sure but by that definition over 99% of all species that Earth hosted have already died. The problem is that people are dumb. And I do not mean that as an insult, I am correct in declaring that the mob of humanity, the bulk of the species is stupid.

Content on their vapid self-absorbed lives and interpersonal relationships with no regard or idea for world around them. Their brain underdeveloped for a vast number of reasons, ranging from nutrition to improper education. But we have allowed these same people to have a voice and importance to their ignorant opinions. 

More than that, they are used as cannon fodder by those slightly smarter but unscrupulous greedy parasites of our species to rise to power. And they are too stupid to know or admit they are being used and constantly act against their own interests because they have yet to see the world past a filter of tribalism of ""us vs them"". Meanwhile, any human with two brain cells to rub together toils away in futility to try and better things, and inevitably crashing against a wave of stupidity every single time.

From the Ptolemy to the bright brothers, humanity inches its way forward little by little because we have to drag the great majority of our collective screaming and kicking into a better world. We would be better off without them but since we are a social and empathic species we do not do that, meanwhile the antisocial sociopaths take advantage of our goodwill.
