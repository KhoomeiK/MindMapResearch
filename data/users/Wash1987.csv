AskReddit,feuqsqz,t3_eqies2,1579389051.0,"My mom bought a house that had belonged to an old couple. The guy had moved to a nursing home, but evidently the old lady was too stubborn to go. She died in the house. Fast forward six months and my mom is cleaning the bathroom. A screw falls on her head. Clean, no drywall dust. No shelf, no counter near her, no holes in the wall or ceiling. Crazy. So then, a few weeks later doors we knew were closed were open, vice versa. Once we went to the grocery store and I *swear* I deadbolted the door, and its standing open. I cleared the house with a flashlight and pistol because it was a ""break in, if I get caught  I'm not going back to jail"" part of town. Nobody there, nothing broken, nothing missing. She swears she heard us talk to her when we weren't there, and the phone would ring when I was on the computer (we had dial up then). Weirest house."
