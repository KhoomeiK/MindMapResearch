Over time it will come at the craziest time and after that in hindsight it makes sense almost scripted but in right now in this moment things may seem hopeless and depressing. Take some time, work on yourself, go to the gym if you’re into that, do whatever makes you happy, weather that is eating whatever you want and just being lazy or always being active, eventually you will see some flaws that must be changed and in changing those flaws you grow as a person.

Squatting ass to grass is not always the way to go especially with weights there are videos that explain but the gist is spread your feet out to a comfortable width and squat with your feet planted, squat down as far as you can to he point where you break 90 degrees or at least get to 90, and the most important thing is to keep your back STRAIGHT have a friend or someone watch for you to make sure you don’t arch your back, lifting belts can help with this, finally drive through your heels not your toes."
