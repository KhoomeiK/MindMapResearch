Denver,ffpzucw,t3_euhpj5,1580112818.0,"I will second Aquatic Dog, they have had some really gorgeous bettas come in recently. And like you mentioned, are kept in aquariums. 

About Fish in Westminster have a great selection of bettas in small tanks, but each one is hooked up to filtration and maybe a heated water source as well. 

I’ve personally got bettas from people who are transhippers and get them directly from Thailand, #1 recommendation is Ben Betta Aquatics"

I never really understood the argument of “dudes had to be quiet to masturbate so they wouldn’t get caught” - do people think women just moan loudly regardless? There’s a time and place to be discreet, for both men and women! I love when my partner is vocal during sex, such a huge turn on"

It sounded strange to say that I was one of the worst things that happened to me but Iâ€™m glad to know you felt that way too. Mine wasnâ€™t a clean break either and it was unfortunately something that I had to find out on my own and ask about, which kind of made extra worse for me. Blech. 

Thanks again for taking the time to read and write and share with me."
