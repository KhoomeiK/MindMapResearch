latebloomerlesbians,ff7rtna,t3_es34ev,1579656817.0,"What happens when someone doesn't understand what being a lesbian is. I doubt they understand fetishes or preferences. 

Like. You could be a totally ""normal"" straight person, however you could be extremely attracted to red hair. To the point where sex with a red haired person feels way better to you than with someone who doesn't have red hair. It could have nothing to do with skill or whatever, it's just the red hair dose something different for you. Of course there's more to a relationship than simply being attracted to one or two features. However the reason why lesbians feel like they have to say things like ""women know what women want"" is because fucking homophobes keep glorifying penis. To the point we feel like we gotta double down on it to justify our feelings by showing distaste for men, when really, we shouldn't have to do that. It shouldn't be that hard to understand -or even anyones business to dictate- what turns you on or not. 

Personally I just don't have a sex drive, like, at all. I really need a deep bond with someone to be able to have those sorts of feelings and that person needs to fit into my preferences too (aka, women) otherwise they're just a close friend. I'm not being mean or picky. And fuck anyone who thinks I'm insulting them for not getting sexually attracted to them. Just because I don't get hot and heavy by certain people doesn't mean I hate them. I can still think men are handsome, sweet or whatever. But they don't do anything for me in the slightest. However, seeing a full on dyke in a suit can totally make my heart skip a beat, which isn't even sexual, it's just a crush thing and it's something that just doesn't happen with men."

Especially if they do things like health healing. Since someone who's sick could go to them, get slapped, feel a little better cause they've been told they're cured, then mouths maybe years later they die from that illness, they can just blame sin or the doctors. 

I see doctors get blamed a ton. They'll have someone they could be treating but aren't allowed to. The whole time the parents are threatening them. Then the kid dies and the whole church blames the doctor saying they must have treated them with their evil medicine!

There are lords so the land is going to have taxes. That might muddy the water a bit for my vague coin system xD maybe the coin system should be for small folk only?

worldbuilding,feyfw63,t3_eqv1uk,1579444958.0,"There's a good few times during the history of my lands that people have latched on to stories. The biggest one being the fall of the Kingdom of Orange. All starting when the King's blind daughter ran off with a knight, the king was spinning a story that the knight was this evil kidnapper, however there were a lot of rumours that the kings own gaurd helped the knight steal their love away. Not to mention the fact that the couple kept being spotted and it appeared nothing like a kidnapping but a totally badass love story. 

You'll get pubs and Inn keeps with their own tale about how the princess and the dame stayed at their place, some even spinning stories of the king's men breaking in, trying to rough up the place in order to find them. Yet the people protected them, making the story a testament to the moral compass of small folk. 

While this news story was unraveling the people were getting super excited. Romance stories were popular, new songs were being written which took the story over to other parts of the country. 

However shit total hit the fan then suddenly the princess is back in the king's custody, her eyes are all fucked up from a spell. And the king is trying to say he saved her and the evil knight has been beheaded. 

People were totally outraged however a lot of people were like ""maybe we were wrong and she was kidnapped"", while others are like ""the princess is all jacked up. She hasn't even made a speech or anything, she looks so sad""

And not long after there's word that the king, his youngest son and daughter in law, have been fucking butchered. And the princess has thrown herself from her balcony and into the sea, which doesn't even make sense cause her room doesn't face the sea, and even if it did, she wouldn't be able to jump far enough to reach the sea! (A lot of historians believe this was a mistake by the press and that the Princess actually jumped into the moat below) 

Anyway. People are pissed and confused. Not only has their love story been taken but the royal family has been ripped from under their feet! 

Some believe the princess killed her dad and the brother and sister in law because they betrayed her by killing her lover (who was said to have been beheaded at their own wedding!) But there are also rumours that this whole thing was a coo. You see. The heir to the throne was the prince who actually knighted the dame, people began to wonder if the prince had planned the assassination of this family from the start! 

There are riots and eventually word comes out that while entering the kingdom to take his throne, the new king was killed by an angry mob. The rest of the royal family are too scared to come and take the throne so the castle ends up being taken over by a council and turned into a massive library university. The kingdom is now referred to as ""old kingdom"" or ""fallen kingdom""."
cults,feww8ms,t1_feuc333,1579420458.0,"Seen it before, so many people who were totally against mix race marriages, gay marriages, even rich to poor marriages, all suddenly changed their  opinions once they see everyone else standing up for it.

Mmm ain't I a nice Christian""

I think there's something to watching someone else be shamed that makes people more likely to change their minds compared to being shamed themselves. Not saying it's a good thing cause I don't think it's genuine change or understanding why they are wrong. They're just simply going with whatever makes themselves feel better about themselves. However when you directly call someone out for their shitty beliefs, they're definitely going to go into defend mode and even say stuff they don't mean in order to justify themselves."

Main characters are gay and she keeps commenting on how their romance seems to come from no where and go from 0 - 100. Which is fair advice, the readers need to be seduced by their relationship as much as the characters themselves, so I totally agree with her criticism. 

However.... There's a man and a woman in the story, both have experienced massive trauma. And are basically broken people. In my first plan the girl was going to be ""put to rest"" however I noticed that I'm giving a lot of the warrior women bad endings (I kill them off because I love them <xD) so I thought she could have a good ending and she actually has developed a little more story later on which ending up helping the story flow.

writing,femrau9,t3_epi4z4,1579267344.0,"Friends and family are the worst to get feedback from xD

It's definitely good for you to learn how they deal with feedback in a healthy way. However that is NEVER going to be useful when it comes to people who know you such as friends and family. For whatever reason they either hate it or love it, and that's because they're not seeing the story as a story, they're seeing it as your work.

Have you ever read interview with the vampire by Ann Rice? The very beginning where the MC is talking about his brother is a good frame of reference. Ann does a amazing job of capturing the MC feelings on seeing his brother say he's getting all these visions from God, and if it were anyone else he would believe him. Get excited and all that. But since it's his brother he's like ""uuugh what?"" And he just can not see pass that it's his brother saying these things and not someone else. Assumably it would be easier to believe someone is getting messages from God if that's all you knew about them, you could make up the rest are their identity in your head based on when you pick up on on their work. 

Same with showing your writing to friends and family. It's hard for them to give your writing a chance because they already know you and so they'll already be criticising it because of in their heads being a writer because any in your identity.

Totally agree! I'm always looking for stuff outside of the mainstream, think it's the best way for us to get to know each other is to see the stuff that others relate to. Though its mostly Asian drama I end up obsessing over xD whenever anything I don't understand comes up it's like a treasure hunt sometimes but it feels good, and once you understand a certain thing it's like your suddenly in the know for inside jokes! Or when it's comes to stuff like empathising, you can really start to see things from their point of view because you know what's important to them."

Question. What is it aliens even do these days, back when I was young they were apparently ripping up cows. Before then they were anal probing people, and even further back they built the pyramids.

It's like they're all collectively on drugs, at first they were super creative, making triangle houses for dead people. But over time the drugs begun to rot their brains so now they just take people, do some random shit and throw them back."

I'm white (UK) I am in love with box braids. It's one of the hairstyles I grew up seeing smart, independent, role model women wear. My family is very sexist (dad is a gypsy) so having women to look up to was a big deal for me. I also have crazy curly hair and I'm allergic to hair dye so box braids are amazing for so many reasons! Omg I wish they were more popular! Hair jewellery too, so many cultures have amazing hair ornaments.

Going to a Caribbean salon was such a fun experience, especially since my hairdressers daughter was on holiday for a festival so we talked sooo much about food. It was great to see all the different sorts of products that were there, it's one is of the things I really wish were more normalised in movies, mostly because it's interesting and I feel like there's a ton of inside jokes we're missing out on. Like the hair nets for bed (can't remember the name) I've seen friends have them but too embarrassed to wear them around me so I didn't know what they were for till I went to this salon and my stylist was cracking jokes about it.

Don't be ashamed to ask for a refund. I don't care if it was £5000, the creator is responsible for their fellowers, the business side and keeping you happy. If I were you I wouldn't get mad at them at first, just send them a factual message, explaining what happened and that you don't think it was right, don't blame the creator right away otherwise they might get defensive and people get stupid when they're defensive."

I'm looking at the advice people are giving you here, I'm wishing you the best of luck. I think a lot of people know what its like to have something so personal to you be taken by someone else. There is definitely a line between being inspired, sharing ideas and being similar, to outright an uncreative CREEP stealing and having no respect for the art. If he likes your work they should support you, not try and take the credit for it. 

Keep all your evidence safe and get some good legal advice. Best of luck, please keep us updated, we're here today support you even if you just need to rant =)"
