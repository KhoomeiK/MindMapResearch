Try to avoid committing sins but realize you're human and it's not possible to avoid them, feel guilt for it and seek forgiveness, and you are forgiven. Similarly, I'd contend proselytizing and interacting with people should focus on explaining sin, the consequences, and seeking forgiveness in a respectful manner with the understanding that judging people for their sins isn't appropriate.

UpliftingNews,ff6qz3n,t1_ff6iv7q,1579633045.0,"I beg to differ. While any direct confrontation is likely to end in failure and even insurgent tactics will likely result in constantly losing battles, insurgent tactics are extremely effective at one thing: wearing down public support for US military involvement.

Now that's just involvement in countries on the other side of the world. If insurgencies start in the US, there will be a whole extra level of scrutiny applied to the US govt. If a drone strike accidentally levels a school in Iraq, your average US citizen may hear about it on the news for a few days, hear demands to end the violence, feel sorry for the victims, and then forget about it. Because it doesn't really affect them beyond basic human empathy. When Karen now has to worry that drone strike might reduce her precious Timmy to unrecognizable chunks, no manager in the US govt is safe.

The govt can't use the same tactics it does elsewhere. If it does, it will create a firestorm of fury against the govt officials who authorized every military action where some bystander gets killed. Public support will disappear overnight and the govt will either have to back down and try to negotiate with insurgents or it will have to go full authoritarian and wind up convincing more people to rebel."

UpliftingNews,ff6p9h1,t1_ff6hfan,1579632026.0,"Except the SC never made such a ruling. Before Heller, the only 2A rulings focused on specific weapons that weren't in common use. The main case involved sawed off shotguns, which weren't in common public or military use. But they all focused on what arms were covered under the 2A.

They never determined whether the 2A was a collective or individual right until Heller. Though if we're already determining certain arms aren't in common use and differentiating between military and civilian use, where militaries are pretty much allowed any weapons, it would seem the purpose of the 2A was individual use."
UpliftingNews,ff6oqbl,t1_ff6l5w7,1579631707.0,Yeah. This would be an actual compromise. But the left doesn't want this. It's not about background checks or safety.
