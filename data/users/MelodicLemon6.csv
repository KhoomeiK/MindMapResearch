Abuse, neglect, childhood trauma in general; it's an epidemic. But letting that trauma control you is just as bad of one. I believe the post suggests that a terrible childhood does not merrit terrible actions. If you have an awful childhood and you kill or hurt someone over it, you've just given someone else trauma and made the world all the more worse for it. People cope with trauma in different ways. That doesn't mean all of those different ways are acceptable or excusable. People on the internet are so quick to anger when they think someone's being insensitive but they don't take the time to think about what said person could really mean and consider the possibility of a misunderstanding."
