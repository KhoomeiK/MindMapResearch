AskReddit,fghk1br,t1_fghcp8s,1580786570.0,"So let's wrap this up.

You're accusing me of not knowing basic high school level science, which is false and you have no evidence to support that claim.

I also did not say ""God exists"". I said there is no evidence to prove or disprove the existence entirely.

You are also saying ""because I can't test for it, it doesn't exist and believing it exists is irrational and unreasonable.""

That's what everyone said to Darwin when he first purported his discovery of evolution. I also haven't made any claims that are false regarding evolution. [Whales had legs - livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/7564-early-whales-legs.html) That's also what people said to those that thought the Earth was flat and that the sun and moon revolved around the Earth. You said it's irrational to believe in the unknown. Did you know that Stephen Hawking has theorized black holes before we even discovered them? He believed in the unknown, that didn't make him irrational.

You are an ignorant bigot. You continuously accuse me of my ways of gathering information when you have absolutely no evidence supporting anything. I do not follow Christian scientists. You also said that I claimed the theory of evolution requires miracles which further bolsters the ignorance of yourself, since I clearly did *not* make that claim.

I think you were hurt by religious people and that's why you are taking this so personally that you couldn't form a series of complex thoughts but instead crammed most of your blabber into a single sentence.

Mind you I'm not deferring the argument, but your claims about mine are simply false. You clearly have no idea where I collect my information to assume I only follow Christian journals. 

My evidence for the afterlife lies in the plethora of media that exists on the internet. Yes, you can find various faked videos and information, but there is also a multitude of information supporting the existence of spirits.

You follow main stream science and media as you claim, then you are seduced by the ignorance of your peers. To assume something doesn't exist simply because no one has evidence to support the existence, does *not* in anyway deny that same existence unless there is tangible proof there is no actual existence. Our current level of technology and scientific reasoning should provide the same answers for you. Simply because you don't know how, doesn't mean it can't be done.

You limit yourself to the physical world because it is here in front of you. Your greasy meat hands can leave behind residue that you can test for. Congratulations, you exist, you are officially a close minded, ignorant fool. Stop making accusations you can't support.

Secular science does not disprove religion, instead it ignores it. Science has not disproven the existence of God. Here's another link to Time.com [""Why science does not disprove God""](https://time.com/77676/why-science-does-not-disprove-god/)

Now I hope you and everyone else reading this comprehends that at no time did I claim that God exists, or that evolution requires miracles (wherever you got that one, it must have come from that ass for a brain), or even that I am Christian. Did you know that Allah, means God? Simply because of how I used the term God, you assumed I was of the Christian faith. Maybe I follow the Flying Spaghetti Monster, since there is no evidence denying the existence of such a being. But denying anything simply because you cannot see touch or read about it in main stream science does not mean anything at all. Nothing. Not even if you can't test for it. As a fact, we are discovering new matter and new particles all the time. Such as the Higgs Boson particle that is referred to by popular science journals as, wait for it, *THE GOD PARTICLE*. No that doesn't prove the existence of God, but you should be smart enough to deduce what that is and what it means.

I say good day to you now, simply because I no longer wish to receive any more of your worthless comments that you made, considering you made accusations about claims I never even made myself. Free your mind and stop being a little twit.

Editing this further to state the Higgs Boson particle has not been found, but it's taken decades and billions of dollars to even begin to detect such existence of said particles. So that in itself says, just because we haven't discovered it, does not mean it doesn't exist. No human has ever lived, in our records, on another planet or celestial body, therefore we cannot disprove anything we have not discovered without having discovered evidence against the existence of which we are attempting to deny."

AskReddit,fggidie,t1_fgg1kp6,1580762495.0,"True, Darwin was not the worst of men, even as he sided against denying existence of God, as he himself identified as agnostic. 

The burdens of proof lie on no one. If there was a God and he wanted to reveal himself then it would happen. There's no evidence of anything occuring before the big bang, so to say that God *didn't* create the universe, is just as factual as saying he did.

All we have are texts from an ancient time that depict events as those who recorded them perceived them as they occurred. Egyptian hierogylps depict extraterrestrial beings that came to Earth. It's not far off to assume that some long forgotten humanoid species with advance technology came to the Earth long ago and convinced the populace they were gods. 

You claim I lack knowledge of evolution simply because I have a handle with a religious mention, but instead I have studied and passed my classes. You cannot deny fact, when research has proven. You can however deny fact if it remains disproven, as there is no proof to support.

I also think you misunderstand the representation of the spirit, or life force. We have recorded spirits for decades. Regardless of your belief, there is very strong evidence supporting an afterlife. If you need your government to acknowledge that existence so you can understand it, petition them.

As my closing statement, I think your atheism clouds your judgement. I myself prefer to identify as agnostic. There is no proof of either one God, many gods, or no gods. Only the experiences and recordings of events that transpired in the past. What we make of these depictions is for us to decide ourselves. As you can see, I have not nor will not push any one single religion as beliefs vary from region to culture. For you to assume I have no knowledge due to holding religious regard is rather ignorant.
