weed,feaxq02,t1_feae17u,1578953294.0,I’m a white lady and I must say this is definitely NOT the shit I want hanging in my living room. If you can’t tell what’s going on by the cloudy aroma just lingering... You’re not a smoker.
endometriosis,feaqfig,t1_fea0v0a,1578951350.0,Same here!! And it gives me my appetite back on the days when I would not of eaten because of my flare up.
endometriosis,fe7rt5n,t3_eo2z5q,1578918493.0,"I use both CBD and medical marijuana. I will use my CBD during the day when I am at work (basically wherever I can’t use my medical marijuana) and my medical marijuana at night. I use Full Spectrum CBD oil (this is the oil that will give the most benefits, especially for your partner’s endo). I was diagnosed over 3 years ago and have never taken a painkiller for my endo, just managed with CBD and medical marijuana."

MMJ,fdfcuha,t1_fdfcnw8,1578358692.0,I’ve been very lucky with jobs past- I’ve only had to do 2. Every other one was a scheduled pee test so I had time to prepare.. This one was like ‘so here’s your offer and here’s your test.’ Whhhhhhat?? Umm shit- I smoke. Put me in a slightly stressful situation and I sing like a bird. LOL

MMJ,fdfc93x,t1_fdfb8mk,1578358286.0,Hey thanks!! I think (fingers crossed) that I should be ok from the oral test- I’m always so worried till I hear otherwise.

MMJ,fdehnxv,t1_fdeh3z0,1578339234.0,It’s crap. The place I had my interview with is also a national franchise- so I guess it’s really going to come down to whether the test shows positive or negative.
MMJ,fdehjqo,t1_fdeguna,1578339161.0,Unfortunately I’m learning the medical card doesn’t help for much in the employment sector- to them it’s still pass or fail. It’s complete BS.
MMJ,fdegms1,t1_fdegfh8,1578338599.0,"Yeah, they’re still allowed to test and not give you the job- or fire you for smoking. The company I interviewed with said they still go by federal rule even though it is legal in our state.

We’ve come far, but not far enough..."

endometriosis,fdeaz8s,t1_fdea6k8,1578335070.0,"Girl yes yes yes!! All of this, I get you. 

I should’ve known yesterday that a hike wasn’t a good idea- I was exhausted, but when you’re feeling good otherwise you just wanna push through."
MMJ,fdealnl,t1_fdeabu4,1578334833.0,"And that’s the thing- I’m an office dweller! I know it’s just protocol, but seriously- I’ll paper-cut myself, worse case scenario... I know next time to just play the game like I have before."
MMJ,fde9x8p,t1_fde9bgd,1578334403.0,"Yeah, I had the oral test- no urine test was given- and it was after I told them about my card.. I’m just waiting to hear back now."
endometriosis,fde89tm,t1_fde7hi6,1578333357.0,"That is all the Mirena has done for me as well- oh no wait- my ass has gotten larger as well. yay. *eye roll*. I’m right there with you, they’re cute when they’re not yours... And only 4 paws over here too!

Oh! My super power could be burning someone with my heating pad (they’ll look like my poor pudgy belly), but my enemy will have to come within a 3 foot radius (short cord).

And thank you!! I have been belly laughing at your comments- it’s not often I can talk to someone who gets it."
MMJ,fde5935,t1_fde4xpx,1578331468.0,Thanks man!
MMJ,fde58aa,t1_fde44z6,1578331454.0,"You are right- it is still a very gray area around here, and mainly up to employer discretion. I usually just keep my mouth shut about it, but I panicked a little.. Plus it gets so tiring always feeling like I’m hiding something so awful (it’s not).

The company is headquartered in a state that has not legalized (not even medically) so they’re still ‘federal rule’. That is how it was explained to me- then was told to go ahead with it and see what happens... So I guess at this point I’m just waiting. 

I do feel like contacting a lawyer (even just for future reference) would be rather beneficial. Especially if something like this happens again."
endometriosis,fde4uhm,t1_fde3o2e,1578331213.0,Sometimes I feel if the doctors would actually listen to us- we wouldn’t have to go through this song and dance like we always do... Oh the joys of being a woman with endo.
endometriosis,fde4rel,t1_fde2irf,1578331158.0,"Susan, or satan- always depends on how evil she is that day.. I have threatened to kill Susan for years now- I have NEVER wanted children, but trying to convince the doctors here in the states (they think they know what you really want) has been a nightmare, so here she sits in all her glory ruining my life... So I’ve tried stifling her with an i.u.d- still not convinced that’s helped either.

I have also yelled at my ovaries at random times while hiking!! My partner joins in and yells back- it’s a fun game to play. I tell him everyday he doesn’t know how lucky he is! Bastard!

I know “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” But this is fucking ridiculous!! (And I’m still not the incredible hulk’s size)."
MMJ,fde3yrw,t1_fde3ppb,1578330653.0,I’ll be calling by 10am tomorrow to see. Really hope I just hear sooner.
MMJ,fde3vhe,t1_fde3og2,1578330597.0,"Yeah, I’ve done this on pee tests before too, worked wonders and never had a problem. I’ve never had to do an oral test and have never had it just thrown at me right there.. I’m a seasoned smoker and I still panicked about it. Ugh."
MMJ,fde3qdk,t1_fde3h2c,1578330507.0,"Well that’s something to consider. Usually when it’s a pee test I’ve always used the fake pee- I’ve always passed. First time I ever had an oral test sprung on me, and hopefully the last."
MMJ,fde0r4h,t1_fddzap8,1578328571.0,Now it’s just the waiting game.
MMJ,fde0omm,t1_fddyz9q,1578328525.0,"Yeah, I’m seeing that."

endometriosis,fddktr9,t1_fddkjz7,1578316129.0,Good to know!! I want to start cross country skiing (I don’t trust myself with anything too extreme)- guess I’ll just need to give it a whirl! Luckily I’m still living in flat land for another year till I get back to the mountains to try it out... Give myself enough time to psyche myself out for it.🤣
endometriosis,fddknj2,t1_fddbfbx,1578315955.0,"Girl! I sometimes wish I one of those damn dangly things too! They got it so easy! 

I was doing training on my punching bag and had to ease up on that training- my endo didn’t appreciate it... I have been a hiker for a few years now and it’s just becoming more and more difficult to even complete a few miles without feeling like my uterus is going to jump out of my stomach. (I call her Susan and you can hear me yelling at her on the trails- my partner finds it quite amusing)..

I hope your Pilates training is good for you!! And screw if, it’s ok your not going all in like Bruce Lee (he never had endo!) I’m thinking about starting yoga as a low impact daily exercise. This crap already makes you feel awful- I just don’t want to do nothing and always feel awful. Your willy comment is still making me laugh!!!"

I’ve been thinking about yoga, I think it’s something I need to just start doing... I’m hoping by doing that daily it may ease up on when I do more extensive workouts during the weekend.🤞"

endometriosis,fdbze8p,t1_fdbyfqy,1578264242.0,I really hope the excision surgery works for you. None of us should have to live like this- we just want to live our lives.. I have my appointment scheduled with a specialist in March. Hoping to finally find relief as well.
