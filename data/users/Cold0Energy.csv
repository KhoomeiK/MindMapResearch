unitedkingdom,ffnpzud,t1_ffnpfar,1580069181.0,">West coast of Scotland is nice, £300 a month rent and plenty opportunities to work in the fishing industry or on a ferry

What does £300 get you? Here that doesn't even cover a houseshare"
unitedkingdom,ffnpu3b,t1_ffnpgpc,1580069115.0,Those are both two places that seem appealing. What makes Liverpool stand out to you?
selfimprovement,ff8j81u,t3_es8n0c,1579680999.0,"That's a complete overload of a question. Some adults never ""grow up"" from their whimsical ways, or lack development in areas they'd like to improve. The best answer you'll get is to work on one thing at a time. Memory, creativity, trust - they are skills, and we don't usually spontaneously improve them without an incentive or without a guide."
selfimprovement,fexyhf4,t1_fexux0p,1579438323.0,"It depends, if you're successful at first, you'll have broken through the initial barrier to start concentrating on something, but your brain will soon get tired. So by week 2, you may only be able to do 3 minutes at a time with 5 minutes rest. Over time though your ability to recover will get better and you will automatically be able to focus on something for longer. There's no point overdoing it at first or you'll get nothing done at all."
selfimprovement,fexrlz5,t3_equrvh,1579435086.0,"Your situation is too serious to be posting online about it, you need to find real support. The best thing you can do is get an income which means getting a job. This will ensure you can afford housing somewhere if you get thrown out. If not can you sign on unemployment or disability. If you cannot find an income at all then your only choices are improving the relationship with your parents, like doing work for them in the house, approaching an outreach service for housing in your area, talking to your friends about getting a place, or preparing for homelessness. Either way you will eventually require an income. Once you have an income, find somewhere to live. In the meantime keep an eye out for opportunities but that's what you need to concentrate on."
selfimprovement,fexpwrs,t3_eqv8x5,1579434615.0,"This is called concentration. Concentration is a learned skill, it's similar to exercise where you need rest. So for instance, read for 5 minutes, and rest for 5 minutes. Then read again for 5 minutes, rest again. Continue doing this and try to increase the amount of time you are reading. While you are resting, concentrate on ""recharging"", the same way you might feel tired after working out, rather than watching youtube. This is called being hygienic. Have your youtube binges in the evening as opposed to when you are trying to spend an hour concentrating."

selfimprovement,fewtpaq,t3_eqrylf,1579419343.0,"What sort of place do you live where you can make nearly 700 dollars a week, not pay rent and still struggle? Where is this money going? Are you not saving at all? You don't need to make more money, either you're wasting your existing income or you need to relocate to somewhere cheaper."
selfimprovement,fewsevc,t3_eqsvvq,1579418787.0,"I gave it up entirely, to the point where even a coke made me sick. Eventually I went back to drinking the occasional lemonade or sparkling water. Carbonated beverages are shown to be better for digestion. Yes they can be sugary, but so are fruit and fruit juices."
selfimprovement,fewryko,t3_eqsstx,1579418598.0,Something to put on your resume!
selfimprovement,feq2zno,t3_eqcwqy,1579336856.0,"To me, it's not a real goal, you don't ever start it or reach it - love requires respecting needs, and our needs change. Some people find others to love in their life, some don't. But it's not necessary."
selfhelp,fepvzcy,t3_epwoxr,1579333283.0,This is something called esteem. Everyone wants it and competes for it. You're not doing or feeling anything wrong.
selfimprovement,fepsjes,t3_eq0j77,1579329800.0,Ask yourself if you are trying to confront your failures or run from them. Be honest with yourself and go from there. You won't absorb any wisdom if you still have the idea that failure can be avoided.
selfimprovement,feprw6s,t3_epuggd,1579329184.0,"Practice telling the truth. Use a mirror, or a blog, or whatever. Simple everyday things are a good start. Be repetitive. Avoid anything complicated. This is a skill, not a mindset. Over time you'll start feeling more comfortable with telling the truth."
selfimprovement,fepr8cr,t3_eq3e0r,1579328568.0,"Make a list of the important things that you need to do but don't want to do. Now get a timer. Set it for 60 seconds and do it. When the timer finishes, stop. Set it for another 60 seconds. When the timer finishes, stop. Repeat until you get tired of the timer."
selfimprovement,fepq9y5,t3_eq1wnd,1579327691.0,Put whatever you rely on to tell the time (probably your phone) back by 15 minutes. This will ensure you turn up early to things instead of late.
selfimprovement,feppigu,t3_eqaw08,1579327007.0,"Are you sure these are insecurities, or basic needs that you are not meeting as an adult? There's nothing wrong with having needs. The problem comes when you don't take them seriously. As much as we can think, life is also about following your heart. So listen to it and hear what it has to say."
