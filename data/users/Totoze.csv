offmychest,ffbv6lj,t1_ffbeygl,1579783852.0,"The guy is 17. He knew exactly where this is going and clearly wanted it to go there. He felt safe and did it multiple times. Wasn't even drunk or anything. Did something stupid ? He regrets it ? Great, it happens. 
In my opinion it ain't rape and he ain't an innocent kid. Just a really fucked up story."

You are trying to get a conversation going, it ain't easy when you got no common ground.

I would advise you to note little things throughout your day you are thinking that can be an interesting topic to talk about. Once you start bringing stuff up he will hopefully follow up and share his own thoughts and feelings. Basically behave like you are on a date. 

Texting ain't the best method of communication, look into video calls they are ideal. Try to find some activities you can do together like playing a game if you're into that. Keep a healthy routine of talking around the same time every day."
offmychest,fezffp9,t3_eqz9q2,1579456797.0,I feel like this is just a typical case of you underestimating yourself. You can either keep on living day by day miserable in fear or go deal with your fears. Move on in life.

offmychest,fe5539t,t3_enttrq,1578865736.0,"Just wanted to let you know I read the whole thing. And I'm impressed. You are practically an orphan if not worst. Yet you still made it. You are independent. Alive. It was a very tough start but you still seem like a genuinely nice person, you got your whole life in front of you. Maybe one day you can pass the kind gesture on and help someone out of a similar situation. Start making plans for the future, save up some money and soon enough things will look brighter. All and all you just need some time to recover from the absolutely insane trauma you gone through. Time to regain trust in humanity. From now on things will always be better, nothing in this world you cannot do.

offmychest,fe31jko,t1_fe2z0gj,1578845048.0,She got that mentality that if you ain't working hard you ain't willing to work hard. And you need to stay off the streets. So it is justified to be dishonest considering the insane circumstances. Make sure on the outside when she is looking you never have free time. You are busy all the time. Don't even have time to eat. It's better than the streets.
offmychest,fe2x36v,t3_enonrx,1578843802.0,"Might be kinda manipulative but your grandma has a bit of a cold old fashioned mentality. You are a survivor you are in actual danger now. So if lying is the only way to go be it. Tell her just want she wants to hear. ""You blowing  money"" - ""You right I should keep on saving up, thanks so much for everything"" it'll take her a lot longer to kick you out like that.

antinatalism,fe2gn7x,t1_fe094u0,1578838121.0,Second comment means that since the idea isn't spreading by genes it will stay alive even when all people who currently believe in it will die. Like religion.

Some folks killed hundreds of people who ain't coming back and they don't even get judged for it. it's a cruel yet forgiving world we live in. You just can't go to college, your life ain't near ruined yet.

Nobody cares can be a the coldest thought but it's a relieving one. Sign of freedom. Sign you got no past to escape from no responsibility nothing to lose. Can take things around and change them. It's in your hands whether you like it or not."

And yeah by them paying for her needs they do gain control over her life, she ain’t free doesn’t matter if she is 18 or 30. She shouldn’t do anything without their permission. But I’m just saying that as her family to respect her you shouldn’t get into the business of where when and what she does with her bf. That’s just too invasive. It’s her personal business as an individual person with the capability to make decisions in that regard. Or in other words an adult.

Often times respect is mutual. Perhaps them respecting her a bit more could make a huge difference to her disrespectful behaviour."
offmychest,fe210ov,t3_enn12h,1578833362.0,Honestly letting her do whatever is probably a better idea. These decisions should be up to her at this age.

offmychest,fdxwd5p,t3_enbj39,1578773570.0,Basically he doesn't care one bit and is probably about to breakup with you. In about 3 weeks. What he said just means you ain't a keeper.

But what I got now didn't come off without a price. I ain't an optimistic because the world treated me well. I'm an optimistic because that's the one thing I could hold on to, it's out of necessity. That's why I am still here. Everything I had and everything I have now is hope. 

You know it's commonly seen as a tough realization to realize the world ain't fair. But I think it's so much tougher for people to admit the opposite. The world is fair. Everything you have and are grateful for you deserve. And everything you hate and suffer from you deserve that too because it's just the upfront cost of a brighter future."
offmychest,fdxlx49,t3_enbouo,1578770400.0,Suicide is just about the worst form of escape. You'll find love. Just let the world surprise you. Bad things can always happen but good things too. Just about anybody given the right circumstances can be suicidal it's normal. The important thing is not to act upon it. You'll make it. Don't lose hope.
offmychest,fdxl0tv,t3_enbm37,1578770017.0,Don't go for it mate it's a trap. Some folks live on an isolated island at a sex offenders village just because they dated their 17 years old girlfriend when they were 19. Even if the risk is low it ain't worth it. You are already in danger. Unless it's not illegal where you live. Then just go for it. But it's very very likely she is not even the age she can agree to such a thing. It's treated as if you raped her. Raped a kid. Tell her to stop sending you stuff. Cut contact if needed.

And although from your perspective it may seem like a mercy killing I would honestly tell you that there ain't nothing to seek over there. Statistically you shouldn't exist. Fact you are here is impressive on its own, your pain and suffering is absolutely meaningless and you got literally nothing to look for in death. There ain't no afterlife sir. Once you hang you done forever. So stay around to see what else this world got to you. Perhaps it can surprise you. Perhaps you can surprise it. 

The fact you got nobody to care for you just shows how free you are, you are also fearless or at least near fearless you see your life clearly. You can make of your time here one hell of an adventure. You are like a knife sharpen for years only to break a moment before perfection. What matters at the end is the journey.

offmychest,fdukvsq,t1_fduir7u,1578734513.0,Well technically it shouldn’t change anything but I thought you are a guy harassing some girl. But if you were her best friend and you pretended to be a guy and harassed her that is indeed a bit much and will probably make the all situation seem worst so yeah probably should just let it be forgotten then.
offmychest,fduhz2y,t3_en55yn,1578733297.0,"It's not normal. You're right on that one. But he's also right that you can't help what you are attracted to. Maybe he had something in his childhood who knows. Truth to be told, some folk just take it all the way with them to the grave and that's ok. As long as they don't act upon it that's ok, and they better not even tell anyone till they either dead or on their deathbed. But if he shows that he is willing to act upon it he is really dangerous and perhaps should seek help before it's too late. (Help isn't gonna be so nice)"
