IdiotsFightingThings,fesw1b5,t1_fesroui,1579369603.0,"When I was in middle school our bus was really late one day. Rather than just walk to school, some of us amused ourselves with delinquent activity. We picked up a small car and placed it on someone‚Äôs doorstep. I wish I could have seen the reaction when the resident opened their front door in the morning and there was a small car on the porch. No damage was done to any property, but I don‚Äôt know where the owner of the car lived, so moving it back to the street may have been troublesome. I don‚Äôt condone this behavior, of course."
