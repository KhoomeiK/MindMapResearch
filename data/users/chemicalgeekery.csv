I did exactly what you did. I told my wife to get behind me then stared the guy down until he moved away. Now, I'm not a badass by any means, but I could have hurt this guy pretty badly if I needed to. But thankfully, I didn't need to. 

So, from someone who's been there, you handled it exactly the right way. There was no need to escalate the situation. You got him to back down, nobody was hurt, that's a win. You would have gained nothing from hitting him."
