LGBTeens,ffbeuyi,t3_esi7ij,1579762265.0,"Really sorry for you mate. I have almost the same situation at home. My parents are absolutely homophobic and they even told me once that they think execution for gays (they don't know any other members of the LGBTQ+ community) is needed in our country (Russia). Although they told me that if their son was gay, he wouldn't be their son. Well. I'm not gay, but still, I guess there's no actual difference for them. I guess, I would even have a lecture on ""gays are bad"" theme, if I told them my opinion about LGBTQ+. And it would end somehow like ""you have no opinion in a conversation with us"" or ""you ought to respect your parents and do whatever they tell you to"" or even ""as long as we pay for you, you can't own your life/opinion/etc"". So yes, I hate living in my family too. Actually the only person in my family, whom I truly love is my brother. I think, he would be the only one to probably accept me for who I am. Even though he's almost always agree with our parents, which actually hurts a lot. 

But you know what? We both have beautiful friends, who accept us, as I understood from your post. If we just keep closer to them, we can live all this shit through, I guess))) Someday it can all get better (mb we will both leave our homes and families). We'll both live it through, mate)))"
