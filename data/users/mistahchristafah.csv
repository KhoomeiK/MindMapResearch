JustUnsubbed,ff6uugy,t1_ff6usmb,1579635351.0,Lmao too late for that
JustUnsubbed,ff6sneo,t1_ff4zzah,1579634051.0,"Yikes r/sounding opened up a whole other world of things I didn't want to know existed. To each is own, but wow, did not expect that.."

NoStupidQuestions,fdp6dma,t1_fdp5vca,1578621059.0,Thanks so much! Especially for responding immediately cause I only got 10 mins
NoStupidQuestions,fdp6b9q,t1_fdp60ia,1578621015.0,"Lmfao so pumped you asked cause I have no idea bro. Just feeling weird about it lol I've taken taxi's and shit but I've just never taken an uber, or even known anyone that has. And  not by myself. It's a half hour ride I'm gonna say some weird shit to this poor driver I can already feel it"
unpopularopinion,fdcd7mh,t1_fdbx6cm,1578272052.0,"Because they were providing an explanation to OP and OP's response was pretty rude. If you didn't want to discuss it, why would you even post here? Sounds like OP just wants to state their [pretty unoriginal] opinion and reddit will rally together to change the alphabet lol"
offmychest,fdbto58,t3_eki8ru,1578261918.0,"It'd be more impressive if you were actually old. Lol just jokes, you should be damn proud of yourself, and so should 20 year olds on the dean's list, but I'm sure you recognize the hard work you put in to get there more than the young guns do. Congrats, keep it up!"
fantasyfootballadvice,fd4ou7t,t3_ejm0pr,1578169524.0,That's awesome! AJ Brown
PlantedTank,fco5ss0,t1_fcm4pgf,1577824625.0,"Lol that's awesome! You use hikari wafers? It's like the cutest fight I've ever seen. ""If you don't get off that wafer I'm gonna boop you off"""
fo4,fcm5tv8,t1_fckx15t,1577764997.0,But you always have the element of surprise
PlantedTank,fcm3etd,t1_fcm2cvs,1577763208.0,"Oto cats! I have 5 of em, and I got lucky cause they eat everything"
FantasyFootballers,fcj2ds9,t3_ehfga0,1577675564.0,hahaha love the team name....cause he mccarried me to my championship too. Higbee also was very clutch for me late season. Congrats!
PlantedTank,fcj1pah,t1_fciuriw,1577675076.0,"Your very welcome! Hope I didn't offend, it's a great idea but it's one of those things that could end up a pinterest fail very easily lol keeping it simple with the dark blue marbles worked out great added some nice color against the dark substrate. I love the blue neo shrimp against that color substrate. Any  fish in there or just snails?

Edit: Cause I spotted a little fella on the filter intake lol still curious about what's happenin in there though. I really like this tank, I keep looking at it. Really, nice job!"
PlantedTank,fcj10fk,t1_fcixcik,1577674596.0,Dwarf sag would definitely be a great swap
PlantedTank,fcitd3t,t3_ehd8va,1577669341.0,Love this tank! Your blue marble river looks really good and I honestly would not have expected it to. Great job!
offmychest,fc94hja,t1_fc8ad7d,1577546894.0,"Thank you so much for the kind words. Judging by your username, im sure you know how much we love our boy. The food trail is a great idea, but we get a lot of coyotes around here and we didn't want to attract them (or anything else that would scare him away), so instead we put some of my mom's dirty laundry in the yard l, maybe the scent will travel? Maybe it's wishful thinking but i think his nose is all he really has left.
Again thank you for the kind words and I will keep you updated!"
fantasyfootballadvice,fc7o7iw,t1_fc5h5wv,1577514117.0,That's funny because Edelman is my WR1 too. Last week I played AJ Brown and benched Edelman and I'm considering doing the same this week ahhhh such a tough call bro
offmychest,fc7o15s,t3_egmps1,1577513953.0,I completely agree! Facebook and other social media is so toxic for me. I feel like I scroll and scroll just to feel shittier about myself and for mostly nothing. At least on Reddit you can customize what you see based on the things you follow instead of the people you follow
PlantedTank,fc5avr9,t1_fc4izrs,1577451517.0,Thank you very much!
PlantedTank,fc59htn,t1_fc53574,1577449873.0,Thank you! I used flourite dark and I really love it
PlantedTank,fc59a0z,t1_fc4kmo7,1577449598.0,Nope I bought a small pot of it out of a tank at petco for $6 Or $7 and just spread it around. Took a few months to noticeably fill in and it still has a long way to go before it's a carpet. I'm from Massachusetts so there is a lot of chain pet stores around here with basic plants and some aquarium shops with better stuff
fantasyfootballadvice,fc4ew6u,t3_efw2uv,1577414659.0,I like White the best. He'll probably be the pats top pass catcher this weekend. I have a feeling Edelman won't play much (or very hard) against the dolphins. I'm playing Brown this week I think he'll have a good day too
fantasyfootballadvice,fbfr1gn,t3_ed55lw,1576818140.0,"Looks good to me I wouldnt change anything. Haha my lineup is the same except for Carson(Fournette), Lockett(Perriman probably) and Singletary(Gurley prob). You're in a muuuch better spot than me. I'm feeling good about Tannehill and Brown again. Even in the tough matchup, I got faith in Higbee. Even Butker and Steelers D have been solid lately"
