AskReddit,fft42la,t1_fft3d6p,1580206002.0,"cutting the tip of someone's penis off is not a physical modification? Most men think of their penis as a very major part of their body! i would think any modification done to it would be considered very major. 

And if the health benefits are indeed valid, let the person decide to undertake that body modification when they are able to make such a decision. The Mayo clinic doesnt even seem very confident about the supposed health benefits

>Circumcision **might** have various health benefits, including:

>Easier hygiene. Circumcision makes it simpler to wash the penis. **However, boys with uncircumcised penises can be taught to wash regularly beneath the foreskin.**

>Decreased risk of urinary tract infections. **The risk of urinary tract infections in males is low**, but these infections are more common in uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later.

>Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. **Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.**

>Prevention of penile problems. Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.

[Google the stats on Phimosis? oh only 1% wow totally justifies preempting it by slicing up an infants dick](https://www.google.com/search?q=phimosis+rates&oq=phi&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i60l2.903j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

>Decreased risk of penile cancer. Although **cancer of the penis is rare**, it's less common in circumcised men. In addition, cervical cancer is less common in the female sexual partners of circumcised men.

And of course it's unnecessary. there are billions of men who have lived long and healthy lives with foreskins"

AskReddit,ffszi26,t3_euz6q1,1580199175.0,when i was in my 20s i worked at a music shop (in California) that mostly gave lessons. I'd sign students up and receive payments etc. and get to know some of them who stayed with it for a long time. Well a year or two after I had moved on from that job I was with my family in London on holiday (as they say) and while we were walking down the street we walked right past this girl who had taken lessons at that shop. I looked her right in the eye as we walked past and then did a double-take and turned around at the same time she did - having obviously recognized me as well. It was really incredible.
