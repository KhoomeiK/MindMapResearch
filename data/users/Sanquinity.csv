An opportunity arose a week or two ago. I could take over some basic manager tasks like counting stock and ordering new. I told my coworker than I'd be willing to learn and do that task, for benefits. A pay raise has no use for me due to some circumstances, but would demand some other benefits if I were to take on extra tasks. The coworker was ""disappointed"" in me telling me this would be a great opportunity to learn new skills, and that I'd be wasting it this way. Screw that. You want me to take over tasks above my pay grade, I expect at least **something** in return.

I know a lot of people that have tried it, or that smoke it every now and then as a preferred alternative over binge drinking. But we're still very much a minority in the country as a whole. And I can personally attest to smoking stopping drinking. I used to drink a large glass of whisky every evening, and drink until I was at least drunk like once every 1\~2 weeks. Then I started smoking. Now it's a lot for me when I drink 1 small glass of whisky in a week. I only really still drink it because I like the taste. Instead I smoke a small joint in the evening. (partially for medical reasons, partially because I enjoy it.)"

And that is EXACTLY what happened. A sensible person would have ignored the man. A THINKING person would have raised the man's hand higher and held their own sign next to it proclaiming ""Yes, all lives matter!

When someone says all lives matter, they don't necessarily  want to muddy the waters or undermine you. They want to show everyone the dishonesty of people saying black lives matter. Because maybe the ""too"" is indeed implied, but by raging at someone saying something as benign as ""all lives matter"", you prove the point they want to make. That you actually care MORE about the lives of black people, or even that to you other lives aren't important. When someone tries to instigate conflict (i know that's what they're doing, yes) in such a benign way to prove a point and you do just that, you only prove they were right to sensible onlookers.

Also, don't bullshit about personal space. The place in this video was a public place and he stood about a meter (about 3ft) away from her. Then she was the one that approached him.

""Agnostic"" literally translates to ""a person who believes that nothing is known or can be known."" I believe the term you're looking to use is my tag. ""Agnostic Atheist"".
