AskHistorians,fcovglt,t1_fcot1l5,1577842672.0,"I can only describe situation in Kingdom of Bohemia from late 12th century to the end of medieval times. Most of my sources would be in Czech only so I doubt they would be useful to you.

Basically what would happen would be that a person called kmotr/kmotra (commater in latin; this is female version I don't know male version of the word in latin) would take care of you and the children. 

This person would be present at your wedding and childs christening, promising before God that he or she would take care of you and your children if the other parent would perish. It's very formal and serious vow and the person would be responsible for the children. Very often this kmotr would be someone you or your partner were very close with. It's not specified any closely. Levels of taking care of you and your child would vary so choosing your kmotr well was fairly important. This system was far from perfect, during war periods many children would end up in the streets begging, lot of them would die. Officially, there were a few christian orders responsible for taking care of people in need but that is a topic for other question that I don't know that much about, all I could offer is some basic information I got from lectures. 

I don't know how this is handled in other countries but I think systems would be quite similar in HRE and Kingdom of Poland at least, maybe even in whole latin christian part of Europe."

europe,fcosa3f,t1_fcnec62,1577840186.0,"Keep in mind that Czech people replying to any of these comments hardly represent the majority. There's very distinct group of Czechs on Reddit so it's not accurate at all. I don't agree with most of them but I speak only facts you can easily check.

I mostly agree with you but i think there's much more to it than that. We often argue or have issues with EU policies and regulations and accepting euro is something that could give advantsge to other, more euro friendly countries that often fight us. That is obviously something we don't want. 

On the subject of being subjugated by HRE, that's not really true. There were times when we were under HRE control but that didn't last even half a century and basically ended in 1212 when or country became a kingdom. 

Overall the matter of subjugation wasn't a thing people really cared about since they didn't think of it as subjugation. Issues with subjugation became apparent in 1618 when 30y wear started in Kingdom of Bohemia. Having a foreign dynasty ruling wasn't subjugation at all. Ferdinand I. was a chosen king in 1526, John of Luxembourg (the blind) was a chosen king in 1310, Vladislav Jagello was a chosen king in 1471 and so on...

What you said was basically true but mostly about the latter. General distrust of western counties and EU (Munich agreement is still something a lot of people talk about and use it as argument). 

If you asked 20 people here, most would tell you that EU is bad and useless, only money it provides is good. This is mostly because they just don't know anything about new regulations and the information they have is simply not true or too generalized. Example of this I can provide since I understand them is GDPR and NIS. Both are considered as a negative mostly, even though they were both necessary and are very useful even with their negatives.

Refugee crisis was something handled terribly and to be fair, countries like Germany and France have the most influence in EU even if the laws tell you otherwise.


Me commenting this basically says that you are mostly right with what you say though, so that's that. Just please, don't take other church people here as an example of what we as a whole country think."
