Advice,ffbt3f0,t1_ffbsuqu,1579781747.0,Yeah that makes sense. Youre right i didnt think about it like that. I just know when i go to the dr ill need to sit there filling out forms and what not and dont wanna go unless its serious but i can understand that. Not gonna lie my eating habits suck and someone mentioned vitamin deficiency
Advice,ffbsw24,t1_ffbsrbo,1579781519.0,Ill look into it for sure! I have similar issues my skin in general is very sensitive so if anything goes on it other than water 9 times out of 10 it will react. So hopefully this is something thatll work
Advice,ffbsrzc,t1_ffbsogl,1579781392.0,Really? Do you think it could be something that bad? I wouldnt be surprised i eat 1 meal a day and dont eat enough but definitely feel too full to  eat most times if i eat that day already

UnsentLetters,ff2h7v7,t3_er7s70,1579506006.0,Today earlier than that time i heard loud screaming from a woman screams of terror ive never heard before. Apparently someone ended up dying and heard it was in our parking lot and the screaming was from the live person if I heard right. Its scary out here I didn‚Äôt wanna go take my dog out
Vent,feqnpmw,t3_eqdexd,1579344044.0,Right there was this girl who bullied me and was mean to everyone in the friend group for no reason whatsoever but when i was upset she bullied me someone else accepted her apology for me and told me not to confront her because they didn‚Äôt want any ‚Äúdrama‚Äù even tho there was already drama
AmItheAsshole,fek6elp,t1_fek4wb4,1579193570.0,I do have wireless earbuds. Ill try them out! when im hooping i keep my phone on full volume because i have to set my phone down far away and make space before i hoop. I work third shift and when i go to work im gone for those exact hours. And ive been looking bc higher cielings are ideal. Im gonna have to dig deeper. Thanks for the feedback!
AmItheAsshole,fek3zcx,t1_fek28cq,1579192117.0,That makes sense. For some reason I just feel terrible about it but ig if there was an issue that big someone would have said something about it. I will admit that they are loud themselves sometimes but im not aware of how often i am loud compared to them.(i work third shift)..They sometimes sound like theyre having a WWE throwdown upstairs. I can hear them talking upstairs rn and they are literally talking at a normal level. Ugh i cant wait to get a house. If they say something about it ill just apologize and try to be more considerate....

FriendshipAdvice,feghu7v,t3_eoq949,1579093228.0,You sound like myself. But im female lol. I dont care for the extremes of things either im not political and agree both extremes are doing too much and i dont really fit in myself basically everything u said i relate to. Its a catch 22 bc sometimes im alright with it and accept that the people i already have are enough for me to be at least a little confident in my EI. I used to feel like i needed to be extreme bc so was everyone else. Then after hanging with those people i felt how draining it is. And psychology was my major. It seems to be a trend to be troubled or at least want to be and people glorify their seemingly violent or aggressive or just neglectful behavior from what ive seen. You dont seem bad. Youre the type of person i wish i saw more often!

FriendshipAdvice,fe75f53,t3_effjpu,1578910275.0,"I know someone exactly like this and although i dont have much advice, they sound highly irritating. Especially the condescending part and listening to themselves. If its your house feel free to kick them out but id say obviously talk first because it could end up with a decent compromise. The driving drunk part sucks"
FriendshipAdvice,fe6xchm,t3_eka9fl,1578907181.0,"Ive been in this spot pretty much everytime a friend brings me around other people. They always have a closer connection with other people. I just dont say anything until i have something to say. I say hello ofc but dont feel obligated to be a part of whatever conversation is going on that i have no input for. Just think about it like this. If you dont say anything and just let everyone else do their thing, theyre gonna notice youre quiet and possibly ask why. Simple. You dont have anything to contribute to the conversation and it doesnt seem like anyones talking to you directly. Just go with the flow and let everyone else ask the questions. Maybe just observe and ask yourself if you like these people because that matters too. So many people are hung up with who likes them but focus so much they forget to ask if they like the person then theyre in a relationship or friendship where red flags were invisible. I just say focus on yourself and your best friend likes you so that matters and if hey feel youre left out the convo a friend could help get u back in there and youll notice their efforts."
FriendshipAdvice,fe6tb89,t1_fe6t7i2,1578904452.0,Not really...we dont disagree too much. That could be the case though..? We both talk about life alot. She posted this on my facebook time line like this ‚Äúi feel like were both looking outside the window but were not seeing the same things :p‚Äù
unpopularopinion,fe6gh5n,t3_env8a6,1578890168.0,Ok maybe Im missing something here. Ithought depression was both an emotion and a diagnosis. I thought there was differences between being depressed in the moment and having depression.  Is this not right or something? In elementary i specifically remember learning depression was like another word for sad but more powerful. Such as feeling blue is less powerful than sad.
unpopularopinion,fe6fdbx,t3_enw447,1578889231.0,I agree! Its too thick and sugary for me. I always hated that part while everyone said that was their favorite

depression,fe6dw0y,t3_eno7v3,1578888034.0,"Yes. Everytime i say im remotely upset its pushed on me. But when theyre upset and come to me and i recommend an actual action to take to help its all about not being like me and how these things dont work for them. Like alright man. We can talk about coping without having to get controversial, seriously. Then im told the reason im sad is because i dont have jesus or god then WHY R U SAD?"

depression,fe05ycz,t1_fdzkyu2,1578803881.0,"I struggle w this too. I think its natural for us to guess how people are and what they think about you if you dont know them enough to an extent. ButvIt can be dangerous because you could create something from nothing sometimes and youre in your head about something that isnt even going on. I say if you dont know, it isnt your business until someone makes it your business. Leave the ball in their court to show whether they like you or not and keep everything face value. Now What if someone actually doesnt like you. Then what? Thats where you gotta like yourself enough to forgive yourself for your own mistakes if you made any or just say hey i did what i could and i was just being myself. you really dont need anyone to like you if you already appreciate those that already do. And yourself counts."
AmItheAsshole,fdys9rg,t1_fdvxmef,1578783045.0,Same there have been times i locked the door to my room on accident because my hand mustve pushed the lock while closing it. I never lock my room door so it isnt habit and usually when its accidentally locked its not fully turned to lock but enough to lock it.
FriendshipAdvice,fdohf0s,t1_fdoffhb,1578605202.0,I really think you should ask her what it means. Theres no harm in that and i feel like maybe there‚Äôs something else going on that shes seeing that maybe you dont see an issue with. If she thinks youre pushing her away maybe thats why shes being distant and not visiting you and using her jealous bf as an excuse. Idk. I really think its best to get this one from the source
FriendshipAdvice,fdoepwo,t3_emelqk,1578603730.0,Well what were the problems?

People dont like the idea of guessing if someone likes them back or not bc they dont even have to now u just match...
relationship_advice,fdmwj5l,t3_em3ava,1578569062.0,Id have reacted much worse tbh. Lol. It doesnt matter whether he wants to call it a slap or not whatever he calls it you said it isnt ok n he did it anyway. Id be pissed off if he told me to leave because i asked to not be touched a certain way thats petty. He easily can go the whole night without touching u like that and for him to do it again out of spite? Oh no no
relationship_advice,fdmpu6d,t1_fdmi255,1578559868.0,Well is he the same face to face? Some people are just not good at texting in general and have much more to say in person.
AmItheAsshole,fdmn3ru,t3_ell3r1,1578556335.0,Nta Why is he acting surprised when u did exactly what u said u would do if he pushed any further and he literally said he doesnt give an f if u did it. Now he cares? What a slap in the face he must be blind and cant see when hes being ridiculous
AmItheAsshole,fdmmt1k,t3_em1deu,1578555979.0,I text like this. Its hard not to when i feel like i have more to say but wasnt expecting it. Its literally a habit. She doesnt seem to be saying anything bad just making sure youre okay...yta. I get people find that way of texting annoying but is it really worth it to just stop responding for so long and so blatantly? Its ur mom

AmItheAsshole,fdmk49b,t1_fdmjhxs,1578552867.0,Thats so irritating. Communication has everything to do with everything so i dont understand what he means when he dismisses its importance like that. In a relationship you are bringing two people from unique individual backgrounds together. Nobody is a mind reader. So learning to communicate is important. I agree with the comment saying u cant force him to communicate and u can only decide if youre alright dealing with that and whether youre willing to communicate. I would say give him a chance to understand this but he sounds pretty ignorant to the whole idea and writes it off...good luck with this

Vent,fddevlk,t3_ekrjtc,1578309089.0,Politics doesnt make a person. You could go your entire life not knowing someone‚Äôs political stance and be just fine without talking about it. This is why i dont like talking about politics. And this is seriously what happens when u do people just completely dislike u just because of an opinion that couldve been kept to oneself. I swear if i went around town talking about politics id have no friends.

Vent,fcmtnox,t3_ehz3n1,1577791720.0, Dont hate yourself i felt this exact way yesterday for pushing my small dog off the bed after he peed on it. He went farther than i was expecting and i felt like trash but all i wanted was to stop his peeing on my bed. That and i was pissed. I spoil tf out of my dog. And i felt like complete shit the rest of the day and he still wanted to cuddle and be close to me as he knows this isnt the norm. The feeling u have will make u reconsider next time and i feel like that can definitely be more than enough. U dont sound like u abuse things otherwise youd not react this way. Ur fine just be careful next time and punch the couch or throw a pillow instead. Thats what i do.
