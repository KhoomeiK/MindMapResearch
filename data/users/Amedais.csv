Operating cash flow absolutely does not mean the same thing as profits. It’s why there are two other types of cash flows (financial and investing), which combine to equal total cash flows, which is still not equal to net income, but you proceed to throw out “income to expenditures” ratios as if they were real. 

Lastly, you fail to notice that the figures in the reports are listed in the thousands, which is accouting 101 shit.
