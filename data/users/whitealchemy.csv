bulletjournal,fedk5s9,t3_eof5qi,1579013563.0,"I lost my sweet girl this weekend, who also looked like this doodle. Such a lovely tribute, friend. I hope you find peace 💕"
bulletjournal,fe8bnl5,t3_eo018w,1578924563.0,"You have so many great books to read, books I wish I hadn't read before so I could read them again for the first time. Enjoy! <3"
JUSTNOMIL,fe5r89z,t1_fe42j03,1578873439.0,"It’s a really weird leap to think you’re in the same area, is all, so I was confused. Especially as OP stipulated her MIL said she’d suspected she was coming down with symptoms. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
JUSTNOMIL,fe341vn,t1_fe26cm6,1578845736.0,"I'm so confused. What is ""this cold""? How do you know your cold is anything like the one OP's MIL is experiencing? I'm baffled."
namenerds,fe1s03c,t1_fdz9jgp,1578830257.0,I love Clove and Fawn!
bulletjournal,fdn80ef,t3_em7kq7,1578579771.0,So beautiful! Is that a Pitt Artist Brush pen? I'm thinking of investing in some. I love this colour!
bulletjournal,fdkthtr,t3_elvd25,1578510822.0,This is good to hear. I had a not-so-great experience with them recently and was feeling like I might switch next year after two years of using their journals. Maybe my experience was more of a one-off!
bulletjournal,fdkhc0r,t3_elhtz2,1578503886.0,I love this! I've been trying to figure out how to add a Tarot collection!
bulletjournal,fdk0va3,t3_ell9gq,1578493267.0,"Stunning! I also love the swatches -- I've been adding swatches of my palettes into my spreads lately, and I think it's such a beautiful touch. :)"
notebooks,fbzl8yy,t3_ef0hce,1577250499.0,"Ugh, I ordered an A&O on December 6 and it’s still not here. I’m so jealous! Beautiful choices."
JUSTNOMIL,f9mzoe1,t1_f9lpxjb,1575473818.0,This exactly.
