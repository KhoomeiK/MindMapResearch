gopro,ffftvd0,t3_esygam,1579891683.0,"They’re kind of different products.

The MAX is first and foremost a 360 camera that also does normal video. 
The Hero 8 is first and foremost an action camera, rugged, optimized for this role.
The Insta 360 One R is a weird hybrid that wants to be a jack of all trades.

They’re hard to compare - as they have different usage scenarios.
For 360 videos that blow you away, the Max is brilliant.
For vlogging, the Insta is very good.
For action sports, I find the Hero 8 to excel.

Personally, I think I’ll buy the Max at some point in the future even if I have the Hero 8."
gopro,ffftl5p,t3_etd700,1579891509.0,"Turn off hypersmooth. This is where most blur comes from. I don’t really understand the science behind it but I know hypersmooth needs a high shutter speed to work properly.
Ramp up ISO. Personally I think the image is good up to ISO 1600, with 1600 pushing it. Some people keep it at a maximum of 800. I believe that it is better to get an imperfect shot than no shot at all but that’s just me.
Night mode does these things automatically for you - you need a minimum of 50 FPS and ISO 1600 for it to become active. Basically it lowers FPS, pushes ISO to upper limit when you activate it.
Lower FPS - the less FPS, the more light is captured by the sensor.
And last but not least, keep the camera stable. If you put it on a tripod, it will do mostly fine."
gopro,fffs1d4,t1_fffdxeu,1579890549.0,That’s so cool!
gopro,fffp66b,t3_et0b98,1579888776.0,"1. The initial card is fine. That’s what almost everyone uses but of higher capacity. 

2. Since it is an action camera, it is a bit useless without mounts. GoPro isn’t a point and shoot. It is meant to be worn on your head, chest, hand, car or whatever and get immersive first person views. Sure you can also use it as point and shoot but it’s frustrating. Your finger will get in the way. At least get a stick like the shorty. 

3. I use the GoPro app because it has the easiest workflow. I have premium commercial apps for editing but it’s just easier to pick highlights and let the app create a movie. 

4. I know very few people who broke the lens of their go pro. It’s possible but unlikely. You can get a screen protector. It’s an action cam though. It’s meant to take a beating. It also comes down a bit to luck, it’s like dropping your phone. I dropped my phone tens of times and it is fine. Others dropped it once just at the right angle on concrete and the screen cracked. 

I have tempered glass on the lens."
gopro,fffomij,t3_et24ov,1579888440.0,"I have LumaFusion and iMovie but most of the time I use The GoPro app for editing. My workflow is to add highlights and the let GoPro create the movie. Highlights are like picking segments from each clip and then combining them together. I have done it the hard way too, manually trimming videos and this method takes 5 minutes. The other one, with transitions and such takes one hour. For social media and personal collection what the GoPro app does is wonderful."
gopro,fffnvte,t1_fffn3ap,1579887992.0,That movie was sick :)
gopro,fff6qc3,t3_et418d,1579877118.0,"You can change the brightness in post. That’s not a big deal. 

The only way I know is to use night mode which lowers the FPS or to bump up the ISO. It’s not a software problem. It is a physical limitation. I have a Nikon D3400 with kit lens that sucks in low light even worse than GoPro. You can’t emulate how much light comes in. You can only increase the sensibility or allow the sensor to get more light by lowering the FPS. 

Making the image bright isn’t a solution if the amount of light captured was low to begin with. 

Unfortunately there is no other real solution. My iPhone captures well in low light but lowers the brightness dramatically to keep the 60 FPS at 4K. 

The only way I’ve ever found to take good low light photos are prime lenses. An 1.8 does wonders."
gopro,fff6e6b,t3_et57ks,1579876874.0,I can’t find a way to actually buy it.
gopro,fff29dn,t1_ffex9de,1579873737.0,Do they use them out of the box or with gimbal like equipment? This is very interesting. Like I can realize the GoPro will never be as good as even a entry level DSLR but it’s 100 grams and not half a kg. It makes so many shots possible. And I was also asking myself how do they take all those fast paced fpv shots. Wearing a pro camera strapped on your head is kind of inconvenient.
bose,ffcqgvn,t3_er5gpg,1579805093.0,"Considering the average price of good shades, they’re not that expensive. There are many other options out there that are not of that good quality, but of a good brand, which cost more than the Frames.

I haven’t bought them for the sole reason that I rarely wear sun-glasses. But even if I wore glasses, I don’t think it is that useful. Glasses with HUD would be wonderful (apart from the risk of getting hit by a car, by that risk exists when I wear the 700 outside too), but glasses with speakers in them... I mean, I have the AirPods and they’re louder and they’re easier to use than the glasses. 

I understand the purpose of almost every product in the Bose line.
- QC for travel and office, so is it the 700. Amazing at this.
- SoundSport Free and Wireless for sport. Have them both. Best in class I swear.
- SleepBuds for helping with snoring sounds. It was a failure but the idea was good enough - enough for me to buy them.
- The wearable speaker - it’s gimmicky but I get it. It’s amazing during a movie or so. I don’t have it but I see the value.

But these?

I mean, almost every product delivers best functionality for a one use case scenario. I don’t really understand what’s the use-case scenario for wearing sunglasses but not airpods or so. Unless I want to cheat at some exam, they’re a bit of a hard sell."
bose,ffcppb4,t3_es97u0,1579804590.0,"I don’t know on the 700, but before that I had the QC 35. Yeah. You lose a lot of quality. Nothing wrong with yours. The aid connection is an emergency feature of sorts."
bose,ffcpfxd,t3_esbihr,1579804415.0,"Technically you can use it without an app. You need the app to customize settings but you can simply pair it through Bluetooth. As far as customizing on the headsets, that would make it needlessly complicated. There are several settings and I’d rather tweak them via the app."
360video,ffa01x6,t1_ff9wc96,1579725148.0,"For $200, I’d buy it tonight. 

I was wrong though. Max is $1000. Fusion is around $600. Still a lot."
360video,ff9j6jm,t1_ff78ev3,1579714142.0,"Where I am, retail, it is $1000, a bit over $1000 I might add."
gopro,ff9j5c4,t1_ff7mcpz,1579714121.0,"Yes. From 7 to 8 it is a big maybe, but from 3 to 8 definitely.

The hypersmooth, quality of life improvements, better interface, better microphone (way better microphone), better video quality, timewarp which is actually very cool and many other improvements make it a no-brainer. It's like comparing the iPhone 5 with the iPhone 10S."
bose,ff92qxa,t3_es9is4,1579703412.0,For me max volume is way too loud. It’s enough to be quite audible to an entire room if you’re not wearing them. I honestly think anything above that is dangerous to hearing health.
MacOS,ff5ffxi,t1_ff4bujd,1579590540.0,"It's about one year old. Okay, if it sounds like it is failing, I'm buying a new one. I thought it's maybe some other problem, since I always managed to fix it."
gopro,ff2rmfw,t3_eq773d,1579521046.0,This is the kind of stuff gopro was made for :)
gopro,ff2rhrm,t3_eqif38,1579520862.0,"For the 8:
- better mic. 
- media mods eventually. 
- high bit rate. 
- more video options. 
- presents which are neat if you change options fast. 
- faster mounting, kinda. 
- virtual lens. 

Against:
- price 
- no replaceable lens, need tempered glass."
gopro,ff2rcbg,t3_eqois7,1579520650.0,"I’ve done some vlogging with it. Inside you need an extra light source but apart that it is fine. The microphone is definitely better than my iPhone XS Max or Nikon d3400. The fact that I can use the phone as a monitor is neat too. 

I wouldn’t call it the perfect vlogging camera but if you have none other, it works just fine."
gopro,ff2r6rq,t3_er6req,1579520427.0,"It is recording ten or sixty minutes videos. It’s just splitting the file into 4 GB segments that can be easily tied later. 

It’s not like the Nikon D3400 which actually stops recording after ten minutes. As far as I remember, 4 GB was the FAT file system limit. Maybe on GoPro is to not corrupt the files or for resource management."
gopro,fezlxqi,t1_fezlfzt,1579458814.0,"Well, I spent 10 - 12 hours in front of a computer.

Seemed like a good idea at that time. 

You know, I've also realised that having an Instagramable life is a worthwhile goal. Leaving aside the superficiality and the negative connotation of the term, the idea of having something to post on Instagram daily helps a lot.

It helps because it pushes you to do things. Instead of staying home and watching Netflix, to visit a park, to go on a hike, to try something new. I honestly want to post something new on Instagram every day and it's not photos of a latte. So I end up going to museums and meeting new people and trying new sports or activities. Eventually I'll run out of things to do but I certainly do feel good about all I'm doing."
gopro,fezcn4g,t3_eqv000,1579455978.0,"Honestly, a lot of people buy GoPros, use them once or twice and then never use them again. The resale market is huge for this camera. You see the videos, the promos, you buy the camera then you realise that you'll never do that kind of lifestyle. So in my experience, it's very possible to get a cheap GoPro.

Not the 8... as that's pretty new (launched November I think or December), but I've seen plenty 7s Black at half the price."
gopro,fexo8p7,t1_fexlhf7,1579433923.0,"Yeah, I get it. It just takes forever to transfer via WiFi to my iPad. 4K at 60 FPS is taking forever. I wonder how many tb of storage they use when they film an actual movie. Or pt. 

I should have gotten the 512 gb iPad."
gopro,fexk6na,t1_fex7ore,1579432321.0,"I got usable footage with the head mount. I just wish I could level it better. I know my head isn’t perfectly leveled. I never used the leveling feature in the app, maybe it’s time to see how it works. 

On a separate note, gopro file sizes are obscenely big. I understand 100 mbps is high but still, some compression done on camera before transferring would be nice."
gopro,fexjsi2,t1_fex7ky7,1579432128.0,"I’ve used the head mount now. It worked fine. It was a handgun. What bothers me with the head mount is that the picture isn’t perfectly leveled. I think I can tweak this in post production. 

I don’t have the gun mount, only chesty and head mount."
gopro,fewnqh6,t1_feu6q5g,1579416054.0,But how did you stuck the mount?
gopro,fescul6,t1_feqyz0h,1579363935.0,You can get it used. I think these things last forever.
gopro,feqyj7h,t1_feqvaf3,1579347513.0,"If you’re not interested in hypersmooth, it is a perfect capable camera. If I were to shot from a tripod or fixed location, I’d buy the 4 in bulk. I don’t need all the other features. But best in class image stabilization starts with the 7."
gopro,feqnecs,t3_eqcwf2,1579343913.0,"I've bought a 7 Silver for someone and I own the 8 Black. 

To be honest, both will do. The stabilisation on the 8 Black is amazing but the standard stabilisation isn't that bad either. A good middle road would be the 7 Black. There are few reasons to get the 8 over the 7, mostly the media mods, the improved microphone and the hypersmooth boost (which I never use)."
bose,fejdwpf,t3_eozcfp,1579169292.0,"It’s mostly the sound signature. Bose made the sound clearer but it lacks warmth. 

That’s all.

To be honest, every time a new generation of products appears, there will be hate. Change sucks until we get used to them. I prefer the QC 35 II sound signature and almost everything else from the 700. But even so, I can’t say “this sucks, I’m not using them anymore”. It’s different for me, not worse. 

Personally I’m satisfied."

I’ve traveled to a very DRY and COLD (read as in freezing, - 5 Celsius) climate and my lips are cracking. I’ve covered them in a industrial amount of Vaseline with limited success. I drink a lot of water and when I’m inside, in a controlled environment (aka humidifier), things are fine. However, when I’m outside or in most places, it’s truly awful. Any advice?"

travel,fefxce7,t1_fefvtcy,1579068314.0,"Yes.

I had to return here to know. That's why I never bought an exit ticket. There was a chance I want to stay here.

But honestly, I just miss the warmth of Asia. There are some places like Taiwan and Korea that are simply awesome to live in. It's not so much about the richness of the place (although they do rank high), it is the people.

I guess some people thrive in a doggy-eat-dog world, while others appreciate empathy. I'm in the second category. I've made the decision to leave for good in a few weeks and to start working towards a permanent residency permit somewhere else. 

I'm happy I know. Some part of me hoped that I'd be happy here. But I'm not. If I were, I wouldn't be in bed now posting this. I'd be out exploring. In the last three days before leaving I've been go-karts, hiking a big mountain and cave exploring. Here, I feel I don't even want to go outside.

So, closure :) Got my closure. And soon I'll have my outbound ticket too."
travel,fefq52z,t1_fefnqdk,1579062042.0,"I hear you.

It's even more depressing after five years. I've made exit plans already though. I came with no exit ticket not knowing what to expect. It took me 48 hours to realise that I need to GTFW of here. Like fast. Like my happiness depends on it."

hivaids,fed5a81,t1_fed4h1p,1578999563.0,"Based on what I know, seroconversion is when multiple symptoms converge. Diarrhea is a common one so is a large rash. Also swallow lymph nodes. A cold is just a cold. 

For example I’ve got a small macopapulqr rash after going to gokarts all day. It is on the spot where my leg touched the chair and sweated a lot. It’s easy to freak out but truth be told, unless it was a huge outbreak, it’s just fine. 

Just test. Get peace of mind. Those negative results will assure you a lot more than what strangers say online. If you want to think you have hiv, you’ll find reasons to believe so. The symptoms can be so general that anything can be hiv. But one of the major symptoms is flu like symptoms. Flu like isn’t cold like. Flu like is emergency room degree. 

Go test. Even a rapid hiv test will work. It takes five minutes. Believe me, you’ll hurt yourself more if you keep reading online. Hiv symptoms can be even matched with stress but only a test can tell you if you’re infected or not. And I don’t believe you are but for your own SANITY, test.

And waking up a bit warm isn’t flu like. Waking up burning and wondering if you should get a car to the hospital is flu like. Influenza like symptoms aren’t just a common winter cold."
hivaids,fed4ceo,t3_eoiybk,1578998203.0,"As someone who freaked out enough about this, no. A cold is just a cold. Test yourself. After five months it’s almost 100% conclusive in theory and 100% conclusive in practice. 

It’s December. This is when most people get sick. Believe me. I’ve been in the same place. Asked my doctor if these are seroconversion symptoms. He almost yelled at me thay I have no symptoms. I have a cold. It’s winter. People get colds. 

Of course this didn’t stop me from testing two weeks later again. After four negative tests, I know that paranoia can be strong when it comes to this disease."
travel,fed350w,t1_fed3445,1578996431.0,It does indeed.
travel,fed3170,t3_eoe8fn,1578996268.0,"It depends honestly. 

If it’s a quick flight, I don’t mind. I usually show up one hour before and I have enough time to go through security. 

If it’s a long flight, I usually hate it. Even with an iPad fully loaded with movies and Bose headphones for the noise it’s still tiresome. Getting lounge passes makes it better (look for loungekey, free passes given with credit cards) and flying business class is nice. 

But there’s little joy in it even then. I just know I’ll end up so tired at the destination and the day is wasted. And what I hate even more is what happens after I land  

Passport check. 
Get baggage. 
Change clothes if it’s cold. 
Find taxi. 
Get to the hotel.

I’ll be heading to my home town in two days, mostly because I have to renew my passport. It’s just that people feel so cold here. I’m used to everyone smiling and being in a cheery mood. From small things like the clerk not putting the products in the bag to people acting as arrogant assholes. 

I’m like the friendliest person when I travel. I strike random conversations. Here, now, I’m at a coffee shop, put my Bose 700 on to block all sound and I’m just sitting here. 

Shrug. 

Now I remember why I left here to begin with. It was that sense of loneliness and alienation :). I’m so excited to study in Asia for the next year or so though. And I guess I could go find beautiful places and things while I’m here."

You know, you can always use another center if one doesn’t work for you. 

I do this trick sometimes. 

Let’s say I have problem X. I call the first time. This person can’t help me. Then I call again and find another person. This person usually is far more open. 

If all fails I just try another country. You need a good reason why you’d use a different country but they are reasonable. I’ve exchanged many items outside the country of purchase even when the warranty was limited to that country. You just need to try talking to several people until one answers and can be of help. 

I once thought these services are standardized. They’re not. Sometimes someone has a bad day. Other times they don’t. 

A few weeks ago I needed to return some things on Amazon. I chatt with the first person. She quotes the rules. No. Second. No.

I’ve tested it before. I like the cups of the QC 35 more but I don’t feel these are uncomfortable. I guess it depends on each ones head. The sound is with less bass but seems clearer. The hear through button is actually useful. 

The levels of anc I don’t know, I’ll always keep it on ten just as I always kept it on high. 

The design I have mixed feelings. It looks cool but I preferred the foldable form of the QC 35. 

I wouldn’t have bought them on my own having the QC 35 but if I had to buy again, I’d get the 700. I don’t understand why so many people love them and so many people hate.

Also, people buying Bose usually fall within a certain demographic. They’re not really kids taking their QC to the school but rather middle aged professionals. Of course, there are a million different types of Bose users but the avatar are frequent travelers and generally people working in an office. Compare this to skullcandy where the market is mostly teenagers and young adults that use them outdoors.

I don’t know if it beats one of those $700 gimbals but for a affordable one, think $200, it’s the same and even superior sometimes. The downside is with artifacts.

In a way, the service is factored into the cost. And when you cost twice as much as the competition (for Bose), you need to protect your brand. Which I’m happy for. I’m grateful to Bose and I don’t think any other brand would have gave me replacements and an upgrade. Even if I know I paid a lot, I also paid a lot on other products and I haven’t got shit back when it broke. 

Break a Nikon DSLR or mirrorless and see what happens. They’re like “well, tough luck mate”. Or when a expensive memory card (think 100 usd) malfunctioned out of the box. They were like “not our fault, you broke it”.

As far as the QC 35, possibly. It says to not use them outside. It’s not like I used them in rain but I’m in a very wet climate in Asia and I can see how this can destroy them. However, even then, I rarely used them outside. I’d sweat too much and feel uncomfortable with them."

It wasn’t even that I wanted to add my own sounds, it was that I wanted high bitrate loops similar to Calm. 

Knowing what I know now, I wouldn’t pay over half of what the ANC ones cost for it. I paid 340 SGD for the buds and 510 SGD for the QC 35 two. I used the QC at least 400 hours so far. I’ve used the buds maybe 20 days before it broke and even by then I was like “why the hell ive paid so much for them?”

bose,fdu2zvf,t1_fdttwmr,1578726621.0,"And thank you :). It was a nice surprise. I expected to get a replacement but not an upgrade. And I also got rid of the useless Sleepbuds.

bose,fdu05dj,t1_fdttwmr,1578725145.0,I had the QC 35 second edition. It somehow developed static. They’ve just took them and brought me a replacement. It’s mind blowing how simple this was.
bose,fdtsi7d,t3_ekktuv,1578721509.0,"They have mostly a no question asked policy. A very good one. I replaced my QC 35 and Sleepbuds with the 700 and Soundsports Free. No receipts.

bose,fdtpz53,t3_emcw7v,1578720407.0,"Honestly, I’ve seen complains with every update. Every time a new firmware released there were many people who claimed the ANC is worse. 

I agree and don’t agree. 

It may be worse but I think it is more that I got used to it. When I first got the headsets I was like “wow”. After a while, the wow factor wears off and you start noticing the sounds. 

However I did test mine against ones in the store with old firmware. It was the same thing. Maybe my ear is not sensible enough but honestly I can’t tell the difference. I just know that it doesn’t feel as special as when I bought them."
bose,fdtpgel,t3_emnlkc,1578720172.0,"I had the qc35 and many other noise canceling headphones. They excel with repetitive rhythmic sound as cars, planes, construction work, background noise.

Explainlikeimscared,fdqxku1,t3_ejmmli,1578676228.0,"Here are some general guidelines:

1. It will take time until you find the right therapist. I’ve had therapists with which I’ve stayed and others which made me leave during the first session. Not all therapists are created equal. Sure, they’re supposed to be objective and such, but they’re human beings. I relate well to playful and innocent type of therapists, because I like their vulnerability and helps me express mine. But I’ve met some bitches and assholes in this field too and I wish they had a refund policy.

2. A good therapist will act as a friend. This doesn’t mean she’s your friend, you won’t go for beers or watch Netflix. But she’ll put you at ease. You don’t have to worry about what to talk as if this person expresses a genuine interest in you, it will come naturally. Unfortunately, point #1 applies here.

3. Some therapists see you as broken and some therapists see you as good and you could get better. I suggest you find the second. It’s not a rule, but younger people, especially those who graduated recently make for more empathic therapists than older ones. There is a degree of detachment someone with 20 years of experience has, because she has seen so many clients. But someone who just graduated will actually give a fuck about every single person, until she learns to detach. This is both good and bad (because the therapist can lose their composure and get too close) but I’d rather have a therapist that’s slipping into unprofessionalism and with which I feel comfortable than someone stoically staying in front of me, asking questions on a monotone voice."

simracing,fdpt8rs,t1_fdnw9za,1578639569.0,"I believe you. 

I don’t know what to say.

Tried Oculus Go, epic fail. Cool device, made me dizzy like crazy. Tried the one from Sony, the PlayStation one, epic fail. Tried the proper Oculus, as a gaming arena, I was feeling dizzier than after walking on a glass bridge at floor 48. I’m not saying it’s not a good system or that it isn’t cool and immersive. I’m saying I end up feeling sick especially with any sudden movement. I also hate rollercoasters, I usually close my eyes and wait for it to end. I believe you it would get better but I’m not confident enough to buy a full set for myself.

I mean, I want to play Half Life Alyx you know? But these two things - FPV googles and high frame rates in anything over 90 degrees FOV gives me a very strange feeling. It’s like when I record with my GoPro Hero 8. If I set it to 60 or 120 FPV and I use 180 degrees, just watching the footage back is enough to make me feel dizzy. I guess it depends from person to person."
selfimprovement,fdpszyw,t1_fdpl9vx,1578639302.0,"Thanks man :)

selfimprovement,fdpsu5k,t1_fdpld7k,1578639125.0,"I agree... I think that if one has more stuff than to fit a suitcase, then it is too much. I’m not talking about appliances, TVs and stuff, but rather small items that can be carried. If one can’t leave on vacation with under 20 KG, then one should downsize a bit.

I’ve actually put them for sale. I’ve managed to sell one of the lenses but the DSLR I couldn’t sell. It’s $600 new, I’ve put it for $350, but I guess it’s a bad time after the holidays. The same with the MacBook, it’s an older model but it’s beefed up and nobody contacted me. I feel stupid honestly - for spending so much money. So many clothes. I could have paid myself a nice luxury cruise for two weeks with all the stuff I left behind. 

But I guess we all learn from lessons.

You know, not all purchases are back.

I thought a lot if I should get an iPad Pro. It changed my life. It’s the only device I use. So it is with a GoPro. I felt stupid for spending $400 on this camera but since I got it, I went hiking, carting, doing cool stuff just to record it. Sure, I could have done it before too but it lead to positive change in my life. Or the AirPods. I use them daily. They’re really good.

On the other hand, I have a LONG list of stuff that brought no advantage...
- Nintendo Switch.
- Google Chromecast.
- Video projector.
- Bose SleepBuds.
- My current MacBook Pro.
- A pair of boots I wore like once (they’re in my backpack because I’m going to a cold climate but still...)
- Hiking and survival gear I never used (including emergency flares because JUST IF... I mean, it’s cool to have them until you realize you’ll never use).
- Apple Watch.

And the list can go on.

I mean, for example, you know I have a powerful underwater light for video and photography? You know what’s funny? I don’t swim. So yeah... while gadgets and purchases in general bring joy short term, life can be a lot simpler than that."

And yes, you can get premium for less by having only coach. I guess they’ll stop this eventually as it makes no sense. As far as the old FitBit premium, that’s not a thing for over a year now.

selfimprovement,fdjnb5n,t1_fdjn0oa,1578479226.0,"Well, life’s not really fair.

I know plenty of people who lost everything when they’ve decided to change strategies. And I know plenty who made it work. Risk tolerance is something individual. It’s like in gambling or investment - never bring more money than you’re willing to lose. I guess the universal advice is - will you be okay if you lose X in order to pursue Y? If the answer is yes, go ahead. If the answer is no, don’t do it. 

I can’t advocate for any of them. It really comes down to individual preference. The SAS motto is “Who dares wins” and that’s true most of the time, but sometimes it is “who dares, gets his ass kicked”. If it’s important for you to not get your ass kicked, then don’t dare. Some people are willing to sleep in a car in order to pursue their dream and others can’t sleep at night unless they have certainty that nothing will change for the next six months.

Everyone hates gambling but life sometimes works like that.

Well, life works like that all the time.

You go into a casino and you put $500 on black. If it’s black, you get $1000 I think.

You start a company and you invest three years of your life and $100.000 of your savings in a product. If it works, you make $5.000.000. If it doesn’t, you’ve lost three years and $100.000 (but gained the experience, which makes the next attempt far more likely to succeed).

People who play it safe will always say it’s better to play it safe. People who play it brave will say bravery is better. At the end of the day, each one needs to decide for himself, as it is his ass on the line, not mine."

I just wish they make the media and the screen mod at least rain resistant. It will be a pain in the ass to put it on, take it off each time conditions change.

selfimprovement,fdiu1ik,t3_elipjf,1578451030.0,"It’s a bit of a cliche what you’ve posted there...

In MY experience, life is made of two main building blocks.

The FIRST one is consistency towards a given goal. You decide what you want to do (write daily, workout, run, publish YouTube videos, take your kid to school, whatever) and you do it. It is the same day in and day out. These are looping process that may excite you or may not, but doing them leads to a strong foundation of a good life.

This is what you’ve mostly mention there although it’s not a one size fits all solution. You find what’s important for you and you do that. I could add to your habits to hike weekly. Or go for a run. Or journal. Journal helps me more than meditation. So it’s not so much about the specific tool as the tool behind it. 

This is the easy part.

The HARD PART is taking big jumps into the unknown.

This is when you know you’re supposed to do something but you’re too damn scared to do it. It has nothing to do with the above habits. It’s changing that job or starting that company or even asking that date. It’s one of those ONE TIME decisions that you are supposed to do but you’re not, as it’s way outside your comfort zone.

This can be an experience (e.g. go travel) or a life decision (return to school) or an emotional one (get a divorce). These decisions answer the question of WHAT in life while the others answer the question of HOW.

So if you just do the rituals, habits every day, sure, you’ll have a decent life but you’ll always be bottlenecked by major decisions. By definition, rituals don’t require a lot of risk nor do they require that much mental effort. Once you get into a rhythm, you keep going. But these hard decisions don’t come naturally and nobody really wants to take them. 

You can’t have a stable life without rituals. That’s true. They’re like the engines of the ship that keep the ship afloat and going.
But the CAPTAIN of the ship, the one that SETS DIRECTION are your bigger decisions, the strategic directions you take in your life, no matter if it’s quitting smoking or moving to another country."
MensRights,fdit5ji,t3_eli70t,1578450467.0,"You know, it’s not really about genders as it is about emotional maturity, cultural background and that person in particular. Not every woman is a bitch. Actually, most aren’t. Most of them are balanced human beings who can keep their egos in check and who can carry productive relationships with those around them.

For every vocal, irrational, “what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-her” woman I’ve met, I’ve met nine other who are simply nice.

And this is true across both genders. You have nice people and you have psychopathic jerks. You have people who know how to listen and you have people who just want attention. You have people who believe that doing right is more important than being right and you have people who would burn the world just to know they’re right.
