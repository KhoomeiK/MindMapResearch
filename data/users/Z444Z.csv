Having social anxiety isn’t an excuse to be a dick to anyone, but if you tell them nicely and explain how it affects you, the vast majority of people will be understanding. 

Of course, people with mental or physical disabilities or conditions should never have to explain - it’s not that persons business. They shouldn’t need an explanation to be NICE. But that’s a societal and human issue, not a simple social workaround."
