lgbt,ffbzcyu,t3_eso3eu,1579787497.0,"I have a couple of tricks for you!

The first is that you could introduce yourself to strangers that way through omegle or another anonymous chat site. If you go this route remember to put some LGBT-related tags in your ""interests"" section, just so you don't get connected with any bigots. LGBT discord servers are wonderful places to go for this, even if you decide to join one full of strangers.

Another idea is the Pronoun Dressing Room,  which is basically a minigame you can find online where you put in a name and pronouns, and it'll give you a list of literary classics where you're the leading character. Another similar idea is that you could try and write some short stories or sentences about yourself using the pronouns you're checking out."

So, to use way more commonplace dictionary sources just because I feel like this is a really commonplace definition of the -phobia suffix, MW and Dictionary.com make the hate/intolerance/prejuidice meanings of the suffix explicit, but an implicit way to gleam the meaning in a sociological context (again, the words of some almost annoyingly pretentious professor) is to view the definitions of each of the bigoted examples presented above, and even the fact that OP put words that use the -phobia suffix right next to the word ""racist"", which explicitly means race-based bigotry. 

Pretty much any other example of a word that's commonly associated with social bigotry that has the suffix -phobia is defined the same way, because that is now an accepted definition of that suffix.

So for example, the MW definition@ of homophobia and islamophobia cover not only the psychological -phobia context (irrational fear), but it also describes intense aversion and discrimination. Dictionary.com specifically describes prejuidice, and in the case of islamophobia, specifically mentions that this is often a ""political force""."

My mother would constantly say horrible things and then completely deny that they'd ever been said.

This led to very serious injuries being ignored for several days at a time. 

One time, after her husband left a bruise on my arm, I called my dad to pick me up, and that turned into me ""always running away from my problems"". My actions of self-defense were always completely decontextualized and I was told over and over again that I was guilty of things that I had no memory of doing, and that I could not have possibly done regardless.

I noticed that my personal journal (tends to be a mistake in an abusive household, I know, but I was little) had been clearly gone through, complete with her freaking nailpolish streaked on some of the pages, and that turned into ""me *always* accusing her of reading my journals when she *never* once did"", even when she accidentally showed me a picture she took of a separate poem that I had hidden in my school binder about a year down the line..."

So, the GI label refers to individuals who experience and identify* themselves as a gender separate from the one they were assigned at birth. One good counter argument in that instance could be that GI is also a recognized medical condition, and international health organizations have declared that nondysphoric individuals with GI should be allowed to transition and have their genders respected as well.

Another argument is that it's common decency, like if somebody decided that your name doesn't fit your appearance and decided to rename you on the spot, but I'm sure you've tried that already... Some people will make any excuse to ignore the scientific process, even other trans people :/"

If you have issues with your hands, I'd really recommend doing a lot of research on cane handles. Some medical supply stores have a big selection that you can try out in person-- I find that cane handles with lots of padding work well for me, but the recommended handle for people with hand issues (can't remember what it's called, apologies) caused me more grief than the ""standard"" handle.

Another tip is please, please pick up a cane with a pattern you actually like. Hell, you can get multiple canes to go with different outfits. It can be a drag being a young cane user, so we deserve to at least have nice looking ones.

Bisexuals have been begging for at least 30 years for people to recognize that 1. We're inclusive of & attracted to trans people 2. We're inclusive of & attracted to nonbinary people, and 3. Bisexuality does *not* mean that you do or do not have a preference between genders.

Ever since people began using the word pansexual in this way in like 2009, bisexuals have had to explain that no, plenty bisexuals feel the same way and they're still bisexual, and people have been bending over backwards to try to fabricate a difference between the terms for years.
