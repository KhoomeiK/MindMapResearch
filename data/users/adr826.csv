samharris,fewlgsn,t1_fe8irzy,1579413605.0,"To be clear I dont think Sam sees himself as a racist, but his ideas  perpetuate racism.  Specifically his  ideas on identity politics. He wants to get past race as a culture and on its own this seems like a good idea but it isnt well thought out.  Its  like wanting to get get past climate change by ignoring fossil fuel and buying an electric car.  Let me give you an example.  A color blind admissions policy into universities.  Steven Crowder thinks its unfair that blacks need to score less than white to be admitted into top schools.  But this isnt how admission to colleges works.  Nobody believes George Bush score 1350 on his SATs.  He is a legacy and
they get admitted without higher Sats.  They are almost all white.  Donald Trump went to Wharton because he was wealthy again wealthy people like him and Kushner go to great schools because their parents can make large donations.  This predominantly favors whites.  Schools with high minority populations are funded much less per student than white schools.  universities give preference to diverse athletes such as varsity lacrosse players.  The minority schools have no budget to have these programs and so white students are favored.  Minority schools in general have little or no arts curriculum, good schools give preference to Sax and violinists.  Minority schools have fewer honors programs to prepare minority students for fields like engineering so white student get in.  A color blind admissions policy would be a disaster for minorities who are already at a disadvantage because of the way we fund our schools and the distribution of wealth.  Identity politics is bad if youre identity is the dominate group.  A color blind society at this point perpetutes the past injustices.

  I'd like to share one more way sam perpetuates racist ideas, albeit not purposely. Take his podcast with Charles Murray.  Is  Murray a racist? Yes,  He's not a rabid neo nazi he may not even see it himself.  On his podcast with Sam they both repeat over and over that you know nothing about a persons intelligence from his race.  But late in the podcast Murray says that when he saw a black face at Harvard he knew that person was smarter than him.  So obviously despite what they repeated again and again  Murray could tell something about intelligence from their race.  Now it seems like he is being kind by saying that he could tell they were smarter than he was but what he says next is why its not so nice.  He says that this was better than the stigma on blacks today being perceived as having been admitted only because of affirmative action.  But for whom is it better for? He thinks it was better when a black kid just as smart as him couldn't get into Harvard,  it was better for him.  He doesnt see how insidious this racism is.  It disguises itself as concern for minorities it discriminates against.  Sam doesnt push back on any of this and because he is blind to his own privileged place in our society he ends up perpetuating the injustices of the past.  This is why  neo nazis and white nationalists like him.  they can claim to be unbiased.

There was an experiment by a sociologist where two people are brought in to play monopoly.  Its worth watching as it illustrates what Sam ignores.

If he would talk about stuff he knows something about it would be better for him, but he argues points with experts and comes off like an idiot. And honestly he's not really an expert in anything.

Its about a guy who has his emotions removed because of a tumor.  It turns out we cant function on the basis of rationality.  You are projecting your own ignorance.  You dont understand what the limits of rationality are.Your eyes take in millions of bits of information every second and your brain processes this information to make sense  of the world.  At night this flow of information from the eyes is stopped but your brain still has to make sense of the world and it does and doesnt care about rationality.  This is an evolutionary adaptation.  Our ancestors who waited to find the rational explanation were eaten by leopards.  The people who  saw a ghost in the grass ran and survived to mate.  When the lights are out your body is not on rational mode it goes into survival mode.  Then there is the phenomenon called pareidola.  We humans are much less rational than people like you believe.  And no I dont believe in gods or ghosts but I dont believe we are rational by any means.  You called me a dumbass without knowuing anything about me but by your post I can tell how little time you have put into reading books on the psychology of belief and Id have to say it hovers around none. I'm thinking you get most of your information on psychology from old episodes of star trek"
samharris,fe5gsk7,t1_fe4xkps,1578869225.0,"Personally I dont see much worthwhile in Sam Harris.  His podcasts with Ezra Klein was filled with utter nonsense and unscientific bullshit.  His podcast with Omar Aziz was dreadful,  he spent the first 40 minutes trying to get Aziz to admit he was wrong about something that was clearly meant to be hyperbolic.  He gets the to talk for almost 3 hours and then says sorry it would be to boring, as if.  He is just patently wrong in his argument with Chomsky and outrageously ridiculous to argue on the efficacy of profiling at airports with a security expert. He argues with Scott Atran about the motives of terrorists,  Scott Atran has done field work risking his own life to interview terrorist. All of his critics are dishonest and slanderous. He has yet to solve a single moral problem using science.  In fact his whole thesis relies on mislabeling as science rational thinking.  The guy is just dumb.  I dont see his appeal at all."
facepalm,fdqw41e,t1_fdqhdnh,1578675636.0,You  are ridiculous if you think you dont.  Human beings are so much less rational than we pretend to be.  It turns out to be an extremely helpful adaptation to not think rationally at night because rational thinking is a very slow thinking and our ancestors who tried to think rationally didnt get to be anyones ancestors.  People are pretty good at surviving and the ghost thing is part of that.  You live in the west and have no idea how scary real darkness can be.

facepalm,fdnatla,t1_fdn4nfu,1578581755.0,"In evolutionary terms the koala is as well adapted to its environment as any other species or it would simply not exist.  The problem is one of specialization.  The Koala has adapted itself to conditions that few other species could endure, While it has very few predators or parasites, its hyperspecialization becomes a problem when it encounters the most destructive species on the planet, ie, ourselves. As dumb as koalas are its hard to match the dumb fuck species melting off antartic ice shelves and building new continents of plastic garbage in the oceans and talk about std's... if only chlamydia were their biggest problem.. I mean really you want to dish on a mammal for being dimwitted watch fox news for a week and your respect for the humble koala will soar."
Songwriting,fdgj31k,t1_fdfk0to,1578398869.0,"Another possibility is that the author doesnt want to confuse the reader and draws for examples those song which most closely follow the idea she is trying to express.  I was looking at a song by Coynt Basie recently called straight ahead and while it was supposedly AABA form there
is no real melody that is repeated.  The song plays 4 times through the song form and never repeats a melody in the whole song. Rather the writer Sammy Nestico uses fragments and similar ideas to convey a form that really doesnt exist. Take a listen on you tube called straight ahead by count Basie. Nestico is brilliant in weaving the different fragments together so your mind percieves it as a whole. There are a lot of way to write that dont conform to typical forms but its important to know how the rules work to be able to break them. Its kind of like Bruce Lee who said the best fighting style is no style, but I have no fighting style and I would get my ass kicked. Its kind of like that"
Songwriting,fdcqik8,t3_ejrwua,1578281521.0,"This is an interesting question. I would have to go with the author and call it a bridge rather than a chorus for a couple of reasons.  First a chorus is usually a memorable hook  in the lyrics that the song revolves around.  In this song the hook is the phrase ""every Blank you Blank"" So no chorus is really needed as the hook is in the verses. Second the B section uses a secondary dominant  which is more typical of a bridge.  This because the Bridge usually goes farther afield harmonically and the V of V is used to bring the song back into the tonal center whereas a chorus more typically goes to the subdominant (the 4 chord) and stays within the same key.  Personally While the author is right about the song form I think the labels for the B sections dont fit neatly into any category.

The Police were able to get such a full sound from a simple 3 piece band.  They were such great musicians and artists that they could really make it work.

Whats unfortunate is that the cramps were there with the police, blondie and the talking heads at CGBG's in the ealy 80s but because they were unwilling to compromise they never achieved the the level of fame that the others did. but were more fun than any of them. IMO.
