And I am completely ambivalent about her getting fired or not. I'm just saying, and think logically about whether this is true or not before you respond, that we don't know the rest of the story after she interned at NASA. Maybe she stopped being such an idiot on twitter after this You seemed to deny this even as a possibility. You also want seem to want an argument about whether or not she should have been fired. But I have said nothing on either side of that fence."

Man if I could just be a fly on the wall in one of those pitch meetings. Seeing such creativity at work must be awe inspiring. To get inside the heads of these media Einsteins, to see their ideas just flying around. I'm not even being sarcastic. I wouldn't be surprised if this was made by one of their best guys, because this kind of off-the-wall thinking really requires a special kind of talent. Whats next? I can't wait to see.

worldnews,ff9lrze,t1_ff9fbcm,1579715673.0,"'The fact that it recently moved to humans means that it is more prone to mutations at the moment as it's still adapting to a new host species.' 

Mutation rate in species is relatively fixed and does not change in viruses according to being in a new host species. However, a new environment acts as a selection pressure, whereby the better suited variations of the existing virus (as well as variations produced by new mutations) are given an opportunity to thrive. So from the outside we may see new mutations in a new host species and it seems like it is mutating faster. But the virus itself is no more prone to mutation than before making the jump to people, its just that the new host provided an environment for advantageous mutations to thrive where they wouldn't have before. Functionally though, I think we agree and are both saying the same thing."

'Plus, this is a new virus, if it recently mutated to infect our species then there is no reason as to why it can't mutate further in a short amount of time to spread faster, or lay dormant for weeks, allowing it to travel further undetected'

It of course has a chance to mutate, but its chances aren't any better just because it recently moved into humans."
