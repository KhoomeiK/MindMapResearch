YouShouldKnow,fecoyuv,t1_fecn176,1578979536.0,"In any case, the original post chain here was as followed:

""You aren't well off just because you have a few hundred dollars saved""

And I replied ""if you have several hundred dollars saved after all of the emergencies life throws at you, then yes. You are well off"".

Saying ""you're just being a victim"" is dismissive nonsense. Everyone has emergencies. Money doesn't just go to luxuries like smartphones. Not everyone has family and friends to turn to.

Think of the average person. The money they save doesn't stay saved. It goes to emergencies. Life or death. Pet bills. Vehicle maintenance. House repairs. Household appliances like the washer/dryer. If you still have money saved after these things, you're doing better than most people. Maybe you can't empathize because these things rarely happen to you or because you have people who can help. I don't know. But it doesn't make anyone a ""victim"" to say ""this is what I'm struggling with, but I'm working on it""

It's all relative anyway, like I previously mentioned."
YouShouldKnow,fecntxv,t1_fecn176,1578978609.0,"No need to attack anyone. Hardly does you any favors.


Being a victim. A very conservative mindset. And very privileged. I'm acknowledging my faults. I'm acknowledging what's happened to me and my family and friends. There's nothing wrong with that. You see people's little suffering, and you yourself suffer from The Just World delusion, where you subconsciously believe that people get what they deserve, so if someone is having a bad time of it, they must deserve it.

As far as my $1000 smartphone that I'm paying $30 a month for, you can pretend to know my financial situation and my life, but you don't. Am I spoiled by a modern smartphone? Perhaps. Am I lured into the trap that is monthly payment Debt? Maybe. Do I wish modern smartphone lasted more than 2-3 years? You bet. Should I have gone with a $500 Walmart phone? That's a lot of money to come up for at once. Maybe I should have gone without and saved $50 a month for a year? But I didn't. The little debts and mistakes add up and before we know it we are overwhelmed. That's middle class."
YouShouldKnow,fecmz9e,t1_fecmd4x,1578977947.0,"Very dismissive. As I've stated, poor financial planning isn't an excuse. And yet it's the reality we live in. Many people. Right now. Not theoretical or hypothetical.

""You should be able to afford x, x is very important for people like me""

""I'm not like you, so I'm not sure I need x, and anyway I bought y a few years back""

""It's not my fault you bought y! You're an idiot!""

When I mention my bills, I want to express that im not low income. I know I have luxuries. I would have plenty of money in the back account if not for the constant bullshit life throws my way. Like everyone else.

But life hits lots of people hard, and if you still have savings left over afterwards, then maybe you're doing better than you thought. Or maybe you're just great at financial planning. Most people aren't. I know I've made plenty of mistakes."
YouShouldKnow,fecm8gw,t1_feclxth,1578977392.0,"You're free to have that opinion. Most people, of course, disagree. Most people place a will in the ""nice to have one day"" category.

YouShouldKnow,feclex5,t1_feckg9h,1578976802.0,"There are lots of different resources for lots of different people. People have access to different things. People should absolutely do research on what's available to them.

You won't see me disagreeing with a will being a good idea. But just because someone is dying doesn't mean they can pull money out of nowhere. Quite the opposite, normally. Blanket statements, such as ""if you can afford a child, you can afford a will"" help no-one. 

Most people don't equate a will with the importance of medical help. Maybe they should. But most people don't have a will. For real, valid reasons. 

That's all I'm saying. This advice doesn't apply to everyone. And to dismiss real problems with ""well you SHOULD be able to afford x"" is unproductive."
YouShouldKnow,fecjkrq,t1_fecixt3,1578975478.0,"Comparatively, you are absolutely well off. Yes, as I said in another comment, poor financial choices isn't an excuse, but it's still the reality that millions of people live in. 

But the idea that you either qualify for financial assistance or you already have money in your savings account is ludicrous. A lot of people, average people, people you walk by every day, live in the middle.

edit: You can easily say ""well just have a budget"". But that's dismissive of a lot of people's realities.

Edit 2: I just keep laughing at the comment I replied to. Emergencies happen constantly. For everyone. Life doesn't care about your financial problems. Life throws car maintenance at you, vet bills because your dog is sick or cat got attacked by another local pet, or don't get me started on your own medial bills. Haven't hit your maximum out of pocket for the year? Need minor surgery? You now owe thousands of dollars. 

After all those emergencies, you still have cash in your bank account? Yes, you're well off. Those emergencies didn't happen to you? Thank God every night.

Edit3: a family member died and now you have to pay to drive, or God forbid fly, for the funeral. Another family members house burnt down, not you have to spend savings to buy your loved ones food and clothes, not to mention fire proof your own home. Your car has two flats. Your wife's car has transmission problems. You want to buy your children gifts, or maybe your nieces and nephews gifts because otherwise you'll know they'll get nothing from Santa this year if you don't. You need minor surgery that require three different labs running test and each doctor/nurse will be billing you. Every bill is late, so add on late fees. 

Life doesn't stop throwing problems at you. Yes, if you have money saved after all of that, you are well off. You don't think you are, because you're version of ""well off"" is flying first class to Jamaica for holidays. And that person's idea of well off is flying a personal jet to their holiday Mansion.

Maybe one day the car will be paid off, and the credit card balance will be zero, and the college debt will be done. 

But emergencies don't wait for ""maybe one day"". You know that. Life isnt split into ""well off with thousands in the savings account"" and ""low income that qualifies for assistance"". In fact MOST PEOPLE lie in the middle."

Regardless, your reply details how you are on the outside looking in. On the inside, you don't get low income assistance.  Because you aren't ""low income"". 

I make around 50k a year. That's a lot. I have the luxury of a used car note. I'm renting. I pay a monthly bill on my $1000 smartphone. Straighttalk for cheap service. It adds up. We have no savings. we have credit card debt. We don't go anywhere for vacations. We don't buy anything crazy. But when you have debt, it adds up. And the entirety of middle class is like me. I'm not special. 

Sorry if it seems like I'm complaining. I don't mean to be. It's just, I don't know anyone who can drop hundreds, let alone thousands, of dollars on an emergency. Anyone. Regular people with car notes and no government assistance, but they have jobs, kids. No-one can afford to so that. One medical emergency means bankruptcy, Go Fund Mes and church collections.

Lots of people reading this shit have absolutely no idea how ""most people"" live. I'm not even taking about the truly destitute, the homeless, the extreme poverty-stricken. I'm talking about middle class. Middle class today means paycheck to paycheck, no savings in their account.

Maybe there's local social services or pro-bono lawyers who will help. Or maybe that person lives in the middle of bumfuck Kansas with not a single iota of assistance available.

Talk to an estate lawyer about all the assets you have to leave behind... What an entitled life pro tip. You know what happens when the average person dies? Their meager possessions like their game console or t.v. goes to a family member, their sibling or child or spouse, and anything not payed off gets repossessed. The end."

1) Me and a friend are on the free trial. When do we do RAF code stuff? I think after we buy the game, but before we separately pay for the second months subscription? So we both buy the game, and we can give each other the RAF code and that will work?

2) Is there a list of exp enhancing buffs/items? Some things were Shadowbringers pre-order, is that no longer obtainable?

3) Glamour's, Prisms, Shards, Dressers. What the fuck. So if I want to flat out change one items glamour, it'll cost a Prism. But what about doing a shard at a dresser? Does each item require a prism? And I read that glamour's only work in cities, do they not work in the field? 

4) The Classes of the hand/land are jobs that level up like regular jobs, right? You get exp for doing things? Are there quests for these jobs? I think the job guilds have their own storyline, is that right? 

5) Materia while leveling. Should I both using my crappy leveling gear to 100% soulbind so I can turn it into materia, or no? Should I not bother until I'm at Cap, then start wearing things to fill soulbind to turn into materia?

6) Retainers can hold gil, items, and equipment for you, and can sell things on the marketboard, which is basically the server wide auction place. But I read you can equip them with armor, choose their race and class, level them up? What's the deal with that?

7) So the Gold Saucer is basically the minigame zone. Is it worth it to come by and try and win money? Is it basically a gil sink? 

8) I'd like to look into cool equipment for glamour or mounts that can be obtained whole going through the story. Anyone know of a list of cool things you can get? Or a list of things to get or do at higher levels?
