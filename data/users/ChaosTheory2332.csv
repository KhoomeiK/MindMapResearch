I say it all the time. I enjoy being an adult, I just don't like the cost of entry."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcw2q9r,t3_eixp3g,1578015780.0,"And this is why I don't enjoy going to bars.

Either some dude is trying to get handsy with the girl I'm with.

Or some middle aged dude trying to relive his glory days by getting in my face. 

No thanks, I'll drink at home."
AskMen,fcvxrzc,t1_fcvws6n,1578012521.0,"One was when I was like 22ish, I'd say I've long sinced moved on. Wouldn't even say I love her anymore. But I don't really talk about the experience.

The other actually happened a few months ago. She was pregnant with my kid. Decided she wasn't ging to keep it because I wasn't ready to be a father and I haven't heard from her since."
AskMen,fcvw9uy,t3_ej6n3c,1578011531.0,"Twice that I can say with confidence. 

Both girls broke up with me without reciprocating those feelings. 

It's still hard to talk about."
AskMen,fcteabn,t3_eiss0s,1577940507.0,"It's really subjective. 

Something told to me by one girl might break my heart. The same thing told to me by another girl might not even phase me. 

For me, it's all about how serious I am about that relationship.

There are things that are hard deal breakers no matter how serious I am about a relationship though."

YouShouldKnow,fcpdrzq,t1_fcpdnuz,1577859693.0,"Exactly.

Seriously though. Been a wild funcking ride."
YouShouldKnow,fcpc3if,t1_fcp9yl8,1577857809.0,"Funny you say that. They were 30 second, shit quality videos. But they serve as a reminder of the time I went to a concert by myself because my frinds all thought I went with the other. Pulled out those videos not even 20 minutes ago. Went over a year ago."
CrusaderKings,fckjg7z,t1_fckfz7i,1577726660.0,"Ok, I'll recheck when I get home from work. I'm 100% sure it worked as I described it. Maybe something in the execution."
CrusaderKings,fck7358,t1_fck4tdg,1577718418.0,"Interesting, was hen I did this it was in ironman and completely by accident. 

I actually destroyed the title just to get rid of it, and then got curious and recreated it. No modifiers on any vassal. 

Did you use 2 empire teir titles? 
Was Scandinavia your primary when destroyed?"
CrusaderKings,fck1g4j,t1_fck1co8,1577713653.0,Exactly.
CrusaderKings,fcjzcmf,t1_fcjr5ei,1577711516.0,"It does. But when the title was recreated that went away.
