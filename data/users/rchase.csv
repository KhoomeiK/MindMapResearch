In the end Cream was all Jack Bruce's voice and a little bit of his bass with Clapton's guitar work. Ginger was more or less at the right place in the right time, in my opinion. Kinda anyone in a middle school band could convincingly play those drum parts.

You get to build everything, cars, engine, buildings, etc. Cost $229.00 (which, admittedly ain't cheap) and took 4 days to build out the whole thing. The cars and engine look amazing, marvels of design.  And though it is clearly designed for kids (it has a plot, there's a money car, a thief figure who rides a snowmobile and a cop) it is entirely satisfying for a middle-aged dude like myself.  Had a level blast building it, and it runs flawlessly. 13/10, I plan to build again."

rush,fg0euzj,t3_ew3rqw,1580406330.0,"*1: To anyone who is a drummer or musician in general, how has Peart's playing/ approach to his instrument affected or influenced you?*

I was into music before Rush (and Neil), but just like... anything that was on the radio. I first heard *Spirit of Radio* on a tiny transistor radio, mono, one earplug while I was out delivering my paper route. I was 12.  With a couple Blondie and Michael Jackson 45s in my room at the time, I'd never heard anything like it. And as is somewhat cliché when anyone talks about their favorite music, it changed my life immediately and profoundly. Of course Neil's playing on that record, *Permanent Waves*, was definitely the main driver of my instant fascination, as I wore out the grooves on the damned thing, I came to appreciate the work of all 3 pretty much equally. I play guitar because of Rush, and I personally know 2 people who became lifelong professional performing drummers because of Neil, one of which directly due my having introduced him to Rush back in middle school. 

*2: How has Peart's lyrics/ literary influences influenced you in any way? (e.g. has pearts lyrics led you to reading books by Ayn Rand etc)*

Oddly no. I appreciate everything Neil has written, songs, books, blog entries, and consider his travelogue style books to be absolutely first rate. But if I'm to be an honest fan (who is also a recovering English major), his lyrics while sometimes sublime are often also somewhat maudlin, contrived and a little... forced.  This is not a criticism, just an acknowledgement of my personal opinion.  It's part of what I love so much about Rush. Neil can write the occasional clunker lyric and you know what? Geddy steps up and fucking hits it out of the park with his vocal performance.

*3: to anyone who has met, worked with, or approached Peart in real life: what happened, and what was he like?*

I have not.  I will say though, having read Neil's books, were I to have encountered him in public randomly, I would not have approached him.  If there is one resounding theme throughout his writing it is how dreadfully uncomfortable he was with fan interactions.  As an introvert myself, I respect that.  I wouldn't have presumed that anything I had to say to the guy, or he to me, would have made either of us anything other than nervously agitated. :) 

*4: how has his passing affected you?*

We're a Rush family. I got home late evening the night of the announcement and my wife literally came running down the stairs. ""Neil died."" Seems I guess melodramatic, but not in this house. It was a big deal. My uncle came by a couple days later to check on his drumset in the basement and we talked for about an hour about it. Though it was shocking to hear so unexpectedly, I guess I wasn't completely surprised for 2 reasons. 1). he'd indicated publicly that his retirement was for vague health reasons. And 2). #3 above. It seems fitting to me that he and his family would have no proclivity to publicly broadcast his illness or personal situation. I felt it appropriate that the announcement was made well after his family was able to settle with it first.  Seems perfect for a man of so few words... and so many.  

*5: (just incase i missed something big) what aspects of his life and career would you expect to see in a documentary? or are there any little known interesting facts, that would be helpful or interesting to know.*

All I'd say is read *Ghost Rider* (or at least a summary thereof). He pretty much explains everything there is to know about himself and his life in that book. And quite eloquently so."

But I would really like something like this too. I often put live nethack games at telnet nethack.alt.org on in a screen pane, but the games only last so long before someone dies or just save/quits.  It'd be nice to write a little bash script to switch between games when there's a quit or end.  I'm just not that familiar with the platform or telnet to bother doing it. Would be cool though.

With regard to nethack, I do use ttyrec when I play, and then I can run the replays with ttyplay (which can be set to repeat at EOF). And it can be used to record anything you do in the terminal, not just nethack. And also I use [fastttyrec](http://www.phong.org/nethack/) to 'normalize' ttyrec files, meaning, that it removes time between keypresses to a given specified time period so long gaps disappear, and the whole thing is just a silky smooth playback.

*“A red dragonfly hovers above a backwater of the stream, its wings moving so fast that the eye sees not wings in movement but a probability distribution of where the wings might be, like electron orbitals: a quantum-mechanical effect that maybe explains why the insect can apparently teleport from one place to another, disappearing from one point and reappearing a couple of meters away, without seeming to pass through the space in between. There sure is a lot of bright stuff in the jungle. Randy figures that, in the natural world, anything that is colored so brightly must be some kind of serious evolutionary badass.”*"

I turned around and almost spilled my drink on this tall-ass dude behind me line.  I looked up like, ""hey sorry man,"" and it was Gavin. 

At the time, though they were well known in that room, Porcupine Tree were obscure enough that they just sorta hung out in the club before going on. Park West has this skinny balcony that runs the perimeter of the room, and we always like to sit up there to get a good view of the show.  When I got back to my seat, like 2 minutes later, here comes Gavin up the stairs.  I look over and there's Barbieri and Wilson sitting like 3 tables down from us.
