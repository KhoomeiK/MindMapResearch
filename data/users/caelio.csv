NonBinary,ff21iwa,t1_ff206qw,1579491290.0,"Light grey can be fine. It‚Äôs slightly more versatile. I don‚Äôt know about how you feel about ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs‚Äù suits but Anne Klein and similar brands sometimes have cuts that are more neutral. I.e women‚Äôs suit jacket can be really really short with fake pockets, and lots of darts to emphasize breasts but more sedate versions can look really androgynous, or at least more so than trying to fit into mens. It really depends on your body type and what‚Äôs available.

Bay days, btw, are just discount days at a particular department store you don‚Äôt have. But I‚Äôd imagine you have similar discounts at department stores you do. It‚Äôs a good time to get a suit - men‚Äôs clothing is a lot more available than women‚Äôs clothing generally. 

I sometimes went a little small on my suit jackets knowing they wouldn‚Äôt close just to get that fitted look. It really depends, but just pick something you‚Äôre comfortable with. It will probably take a lot of trial and error, and you may not be entirely happy at the end because of time or money restrictions. It‚Äôs a hard thing, remember, and it‚Äôs not you or your body. It‚Äôs just difficult for all of us. :)"
NonBinary,ff20zri,t1_ff20i62,1579490901.0,"Haha, ok so not near toronto. Didn‚Äôt realize tuxedo junction was North American. Then, by ‚Äúthe bay‚Äù I mean whatever department stores you have nearby."
NonBinary,ff1zont,t3_er6ku2,1579489954.0,"Tuxedo junction .. so gta? 

Biggest thing I‚Äôm going to say is that the fit on suits is really going to depend on your body type and the styles they have. The biggest problem I have found is with a bigger waist requiring a larger suit jacket, which makes the shoulders or body look disproportionate. 

When you go, wear or bring what you expect to wear that day- particularly your top undergarments, whatever they are, or aren‚Äôt. 

Traditional places like TJ are going to have a lot of stuff that is quite square cut and boxy, which is going to be less flattering. Depending on your body type and comfort, I would recommend a semi-fitted to fitted jacket. Close, European or whatever fits that are really tight will not work well because of hips. 

If you‚Äôre buying a suit and are in the area I guessed, I‚Äôd recommend going to the bay and trying on a whole bunch of different suit styles and cuts (they are also much more affordable during bay days, but again, only guess that you‚Äôre in the region).  Sondergaard is a great one for nb figures, and can be more affordable.

You‚Äôre going to need to know your proportions in inches (waist, hip, chest, neck). If you buy something and want in tailored, there are some things that are easy and cheap, others that are harder and more costly.

It‚Äôs easy to change the hem of pants if there is material (check that always), or the length of a suit jacket sleeve to be shorter or longer (again check for material if making longer). It is not as easy to make pants thinner and fit better around the leg and costs some more. It is much harder to reduce the proportions of the body of a suit jacket, as it usually has to be completely taken apart, cut and put back together. I had the above four things done (hem, jacket arm length, leg fit and arm fit) done by a tailor in a suit, costing $360. And I wasn‚Äôt entirely happy (in part because they didn‚Äôt do the fifth thing). After buying the suit on sale, the whole endeavour cost more.

Better to spend a bit more for something fitting better than a bit less. A simple two or three button in blue will be versatile. Grey is fine, but it‚Äôs boring and hard to wear ‚Äúsharply‚Äù. Blue can be utilized through most seasons. Don‚Äôt buy full wool if it‚Äôs a summer wedding, but also not linen because summer. A medium to dark blue will be your most versatile. If you have to buy an actual monkey suit, pick one with a common fabric (I.e no shiny lapels) as it is also more versatile - you can wear a black suit many places but a tux doesn‚Äôt travel well unless you‚Äôre really into black or white tie. 

I could go on and on. But yeah, biggest things are: don‚Äôt expect to tailor much, buy a suit that can do more than one thing, go for less boxy cuts, wear what you‚Äôre going to wear, consider rental but if not, try on a LOT and set aside more than one day for this.

Edit: also, most suit sections are divided into two types, ‚Äúseparates‚Äù and ‚Äúsets‚Äù. Separates is where you buy one jacket and one pair of pants, separately, sized to whatever you need (and can find). Sometimes they have vests. Sets are based on predetermined men‚Äôs sizes, and the tops and bottoms are linked. You buy them both and can‚Äôt switch out the sizes. So a pants might fit great but not the jacket or vice versa, and there is no real solution other than tailoring. But tailoring is expensive and also requires a good tailor for the type (most don‚Äôt do very well in really extensive alterations) and for you to buy something that can be tailored, which could mean having two buy two sizes up. And at that point it‚Äôs just a roll of the dice. If this is your first suit, I‚Äôd really suggest going out to a bunch of stores and trying things on to get a feel for it. It‚Äôs not necessarily easy or obvious, but also, maybe it will be for you."

There is no ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù role. There is parenting. Different people bring different things to it, but they are all still parents. People can be more feminine or masculine, or a mix no matter their assigned sex at birth or current gender identity. 

Also, I see it is your priority to continue a family name, under the premise that, culturally in the west, men keep their name and women take the name of the man they are marrying. Consider that: women can keep their names. Men can take their spouses names. Queer and NB and non-cis people marry also, and do not always follow this convention. Married partners can have different names, or hyphenated names, or a mashup of names, or whatever the hell they want because they‚Äôre adults and get to choose and this isn‚Äôt a monolith of modern society. 

It seems like you have a lot of rigid preconceived ideas and notions about gender and the way things work with respect to gender.

ftm,few5ngf,t3_eqpzdn,1579405752.0," Cis men tend to gain visceral fat more than subcutaneous, so taking t and gaining weight is more likely to follow this progression. One can gain extra weight and not see it as much, because it‚Äôs packed around organs or in different places based on what you‚Äôre used to looking at.

Many men report gaining weight after starting t for the first time.. a lot talk about increased appetite, just like boys going through puberty. It‚Äôs pretty easy to eat a bit more and gain weight in this sort of scenario. It‚Äôs not the status quo of your pre-t body. 

Unless you‚Äôre really training hard, it probably is mostly fat, some water, and some muscle. 

This isn‚Äôt necessarily bad. You will find you can build muscle faster on t, and one can become more aware of appetite changes with a bit of focus. Just takes a bit of time and willpower."
fatlogic,few4782,t3_eqq283,1579405123.0,"This is such utter bs.

The men in this study were:

1. Average in the middle of the 20th century, I.e. in great shape compared to now.
2. Their average caloric intake for the first section of the study was 3200 calories a DAY. This was ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù, so again, they‚Äôre more active then we are now.
3. The ‚Äúsemi-starvation‚Äù was what it was termed at the time, for a reason. It was an abrupt 6 month drop to roughly 50% of their necessary caloric intake based on actually living then.
4. They did that for six months and it had health impacts, none of them permanent. Stamina, body temp, sex drive, heart rate etc. All what you would expect from eating half of your daily, for 6months. 

Semi starvation is a bad idea and not in anyway comparable to reducing caloric intake within currently recommended health guidelines. 

Changing your lifestyle to respect CICO and lose weight, through reduced caloric intake and hopefully exercise and better food choices is NOT the same as electing to cut your current food intake in half while also adhering to the physical demands placed on young men in the 1940s. Or even just cutting it in half. Yeah. Don‚Äôt do that. That is stupid. Sustained and healthy weight loss happens over time by changing your life.

Power walking is super great for building aerobic base, so yeah, just add that on to the running you‚Äôre doing.

I‚Äôve been taking t for 2+ years at this point, also partly/ maybe a lot because of other health issues that it helps. I take anywhere between .25-1 of 100mg/ml test cypionate weekly. Weekly gives fewer swings, but you have to halve the dose. Pretty much just allowed to dose myself, within an upper limit. I started at .125.

I identify as kind of a mix: I‚Äôm a woman and female bodied person, but also transmasculine.. so kinda non binary, but with a lot of binary. I dunno, but also I don‚Äôt really care, other than the fact that my id as a woman and queer woman is an essential element of who I am, whatever else has been added on top of that. 

T is different for everyone, but I‚Äôve been able to take it without having ALL the masculinizing side effects, like facial hair growth. Ive has some of it, but I manage it through a relatively laissez-faire routine. The acne kind of sucks, but it‚Äôs not significant. I‚Äôve had a bunch of other hair growth, but nothing outside of the normal realm of AfAB. My voice is noticeably lower, and very easy to strain (I work in a job I have to yell a lot because of noise, so that‚Äôs neither here nor there). 

I am constantly taken as a man, and it doesn‚Äôt really bother me but it does make things more complicated. I had breast reduction, but not full removal and I don‚Äôt bind, so there is the ‚Äúconfused cis person‚Äù aspect sometimes. That being said, I am also 6‚Äô2, average-ish weight with a good amount of upper body muscular development.. and I tend to dress like a cross between a librarian, a dad, and a hipster. Passing as a man is de rigeur at this point, even if I don‚Äôt want to. The height does this, and then the fat distribution and muscle development, and then my voice ‚Äúseals the deal,‚Äù as it were. This can be frustrating or hard sometimes, but it‚Äôs not worse than the alternative, for me. 

I really like the energy and muscle development I get from t, and also just a sense of being ‚Äúok‚Äù, ~especially~ around the health issues. I don‚Äôt plan to take it forever, but it‚Äôs doing what I need now. Some of the stuff is partially reversible, but mostly it‚Äôs not. If you stay low, you have a little bit more control.. the changes will be more subtle and you‚Äôll see them start happening - so if there is something you don‚Äôt like, you can hop off the train.

As an aside: Older cis women are often prescribed very low doses of t to help with a variety of post menopausal things.. it‚Äôs super helpful for a bunch of stuff outside of gender. It‚Äôs totally valid to take it for what you want, and for that not to impact your gender identity.. even if gender id is how you accessed it. I‚Äôd just say, go slow and keep re-evaluating. The longer you take it the more likely you are to pass because of how your body gets reconstituted. While muscle mass and fat distribution will rebalance over time after not taking t anymore, the other changes are more permanent. It‚Äôs just about continuing to check in with yourself, your goals, and feeling out the process."

running,fdp3nlt,t3_emii72,1578619232.0,"Starting off by jogging 3 miles is a lot, even at a slow pace. Jogging and running are really hard on your body, and while I take your point that you do weights, the stabilizer muscles needed to support your calves as well as the bones themselves probably aren‚Äôt up to running 3mi. 

So: yes you should go see a dr as reddit / I am definitely not an expert. Also: it sounds like you‚Äôre pushing yourself too hard, too fast and giving yourself shin splints and being too aggressive in training leg muscles that have probably been underutilized.

The reason people use programs like C25K isn‚Äôt just that they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù run for the stereotypical reasons like being super out of shape in one form or the other. Some people are fit from other low impact activities and used the program to help them progressively train their bodies to withstand the impact of running. I.e. being a great weight lifter or swimmer or cyclist doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean skipping the beginner stages of running, especially if what you‚Äôre struggling with isn‚Äôt aerobic but impact.

I say this, laying on my bed in a relative lot good amount of pain in my shins and calves from trying to push my mileage up too fast this week.. it happens. 

Other than getting a Dr consult, you could try letting your legs recover and then start working on a progressive running program that starts off much slower than you‚Äôve been going, like c25k. Do what you can manage, but doing a lot less more often (2-3 times a week, starting with 30s to 1 min jog / walk intervals) will be far kinder to your legs and you‚Äôll progress much faster since you won‚Äôt be injuring yourself / will be consistently training. At the end of 9 weeks (or more if needed) of a program like that, you‚Äôll be running close to what you‚Äôre trying to now. R/c25k is a great resource for this as well.

Heart rates this high mean you‚Äôre developing your anaerobic capacity, I.e working muscles without oxygen. This system is limited - it works off glucose and takes a lot of energy to keep going, which is why sometimes people hit a wall when running, even elite athletes. Slowing down to your cardio zone instead of peak will help to develop your aerobic capacity. You can run in that zone for much, much longer than anaerobic, and the benefits stack when you start running at peak. 

To be fair, I found running very slow impossible for the first year (physically it hurt more and psychologically I was impatient) but it does help. 

TLDR; that‚Äôs not bad, but building your aerobic base will help more than pushing through at peak. There is lots of cardio minutes in there already, but if you‚Äôre concerned, slowing down will actually just help you overall."

Anyway, I completed C25K earlier this year, hit a PB of 26:40 for a 5k, ran a race... and then had no energy to run do to an intense season of work. Been running a bit in Nov and Dec but today I started training to run a 10k in May. Did a slow 8.5k/5ish mi run outside (was on treadmills before) and it went super well, though challenging. I get a lot of arm and muscle workouts from work, but my core and back are weak.. hoping to start slowly incorporating training for that in but cognizant of the potential for taking on too many new routines all at once before they've developed into habits. I've never felt comfortable in bathing suits (skinny fat, and then just fat) like it seems some can, so I'm hoping this might be the year. Not necessarily looking to jump into an itsy bitsy number, but I'd like if this were the year I felt good about how I look on the beach. Good, not perfect, just realistically good.

Its been long and slow. I started getting back in shape four years ago (30) after gaining a bunch of weight from long term illness (though I wasn't fit before that, just skinny fat) and now I can do so so much more. I could've never done the job I'm doing now, or run for more than 10 secs, or fit into the clothes I do. It bothers me so much when people say that diets and other stuff don't work so don't try. Yeah, maybe shitty fad diets suck, but making lifestyle changes for long term health is not the same thing. If I had listened to the HAES bullshit I'd still be overweight/close to or actually obese, super unhealthy and unhappy. 

Wow, that was long. Anyway, thanks for all your posts! They're motivational for me. <3"
