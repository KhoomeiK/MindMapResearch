eds,fdbfzdo,t3_ek9sv4,1578257027.0,"Try and come up with ideas that they can do, include them as much as possible, dont be an ass when they say they need to sit or rest or whatever, and don't leave them out. Speaking from experience, it absolutely sucks when all your friends go out to do something but you cant go because it would be too much stress on your body."

AskReddit,fcq4rys,t3_eihhhn,1577878691.0,Some jerk was threatening to punch my 5 yr old sister (he was 12) so 10yr old me kicked him in the balls n punched him in the face
AskReddit,fcn2byg,t1_fcn1hyr,1577801289.0,Exactly
AskReddit,fcmwx52,t3_ei0sog,1577795935.0,"I got some new rubbers for the bottom of my crutches, doesn't sound like much but it's such a relief and I feel so much safer when using them, definitely the best gift this year
Worst gift was some temporary blonde hair dye for only the roots that you can spray in and it stays there until it gets washed out.... I'm naturally blonde, my roots are naturally blonde.... Yea... Appreciated the thought tho"
ehlersdanlos,fcms4u5,t3_ei0dil,1577789563.0,"I have hEDS, I rarely bruise and have no scarring either, my skin is only mildly stretchy and is soft. But i do have hEDS. Eds is a spectrum, so its totally possibly to suffer with some stuff and not others. I've heard of people with eds that don't have any symptoms at all. It's just the luck of the draw ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

AskReddit,fcl5msx,t3_ehpsgr,1577740327.0,"A girl I thought was my friend kept calling me a two faced bitch, saying how annoying I was and how sometimes she just wanted to push me off a cliff. A girl who I thought hated me replied with ""don't say that. She's so kind and smart and funny. I would've failed so many tests if it wasn't for her. You're just jealous that people actually like her.""...i made a new friend that day"
AskReddit,fcl5ead,t3_ehkaes,1577740181.0,"It's perfect. A speeding fine should affect a rich person just as much as a poor person. A 400k fine could mean my entire family would have nothing to eat for months, a 400k fine for someone else however could barely be noticeable. Giving it proportional to income is so much smarter"
aww,fckqf33,t3_ehgbnr,1577730952.0,Wish I had a glow up like that üòç
