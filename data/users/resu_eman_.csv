I'm being treated for the middle one, might have the first one and definitely do not what to enter the hell that is graduate coursework (for others it may be a great experience). Idk anything about med requirements. Wish ya the best!"
bipolar,feqv3at,t1_fenncin,1579346386.0,You're welcome
bipolar,feimb06,t3_ep8i2c,1579141865.0,Mania is no joke. I suggest calling your doctor or psych doc so they can get you some meds to stop it. Temporary ones if you insist on not staying medicated.
bipolar,feilkpj,t3_epa41e,1579141371.0,"An old roommate...once she realised that I'm awkward she eased out of the conversation. Nice person though. 
Elementary school friend on bus, we couldn't keep track of the conversation (lasted like 2 minutes until we parted ways) and i felt and probably looked a little too happy and high strung. 

Yeeeeep."
bipolar,feikbvf,t3_ep8ck7,1579140526.0,"Withdrawal symptoms alone are why i don't up my dosage when i get worried about my mood. I do think back on old bad memories every so often, but not as often as i did leading up to my diagnosis. I was a lot sadder and more worried, paranoid at times even, when i wasn't on medication. I think finding a nearby therapist that he likes and wants to go to would help keep him and his thinking on better track. You could also go see a therapist for your anxiety if you like. As for his social support, eh, it's college. The therapist is a good starting point for support, maybe a supportive sibling to play video games with online every so often. Depression will most likely impact his grades though...his very expensive grades. :("
bipolar,feijaje,t3_ep994z,1579139831.0,"Idk if the following could be relatable at all. I'm currently diagnosed with bp1 because of a manic episode with psychotic features (due to medication) I've been looking at add, asd, and social anxiety since my therapist hinted at another diagnosis or a misdiagnosis. I've been talking about inattentiveness and anxiety with her. Idk what similar diagnoses empathize depression."
bipolar,feii7xt,t3_ep5vu8,1579139124.0,"Loss of appetite was my best purchase, lol. I kid, I'm just salty because of how long it will take to loss the weight I put on afterwards."
bipolar,feihvbe,t3_epaesw,1579138894.0,That looks super cool! Nice idea and execution. I wonder if you could sell it or have it in an art exhibit.
bipolar,fei087k,t3_ep98ds,1579127465.0,Stay hydrated. Don't mess with your Caffenine and salt intake too much. Fear lithium toxicity and read up on it.
bipolar,fehymd2,t1_fehec6c,1579126499.0,I've been skim reading about asd and a few other diagnoses related to bipolar. :) I'll try my best to not worry too much about everything.
bipolar,fehe9of,t1_fegchpm,1579114751.0,"mine are more worry related, mainly in social interactions. Therapist said i might have another diagnosis or misdiagnosed a few weeks ago. I'll get to run it by my psychiatrist soon! I'm happy about that. :)"
bipolar,fegc9b2,t1_fegc1ej,1579087314.0,Thank you for clarifying.
bipolar,fegbyvq,t3_eondmn,1579086936.0,"Hypothetically, what if you doubt your own point of view? Idk years ago when i tried this i ran around in circles with my reasoning. Now i have a therapist to run it by once a month but still... sucks."
