It has so much potential."
unrealengine,ffl0kki,t1_ffl0gsv,1580032583.0,Okay. I think I misread your blueprint anyway. I think I understand what to do now. I'll try it out when I get up.

unrealengine,ffj8fee,t1_ffj83tc,1579992923.0,"I tried getting the forward vector, however the problem is that can also move left and right too. So I have to combine the X and Y direction into one vector. I'm also not using any animations since I'm in first person."
unrealengine,ffj2bwr,t1_ffiz5d8,1579988624.0,"I think I managed to solve the problem. All I actually needed was to get the Up Vector of the launch pad, and then multiply it by a launch velocity variable. I don't know why it took me so long to figure this out, but it seems to launch me in the direction that the launch pad is angled so I'm happy with it."
MurderedByWords,ff4d8bd,t1_ff4b8bx,1579560857.0,"All possible damage to the party and the Conservative movement has been done. But he could surely do more damage to the country, but I don't think he will. I think it will only improve after 2020 (providing he wins, which is looking likely from election modeling)."
MurderedByWords,ff4d07h,t1_ff4asfg,1579560710.0,It's relevant to the original comment. It shows how Republicans don't necessarily support Trump.
MurderedByWords,ff4a9mp,t1_ff482hv,1579558956.0,"Yes, I've seen the evidence and I have been following it pretty closely. I don't think that he's done enough to be impeached, but I also think that Bill Clinton shouldn't have been impeached either. I'm not against impeachment because its Trump, I'm just against it in most circumstances.

Technically, the constitution allows a President to be impeached for anything, but I think that impeachment should only be done if the President was using his power to purposely harm America, in a form of treason. I'm not going to question that what Trump or Clinton did was wrong, but neither fit my opinion on what the criteria should be.

I also think this will hurt the Democrats in the short term more than it will hurt the Republicans. Trump's approval rating has remained steady throughout this whole process, so nobody has been persuaded by the impeachment, except the people who would have already agreed with it."
MurderedByWords,ff49odf,t1_ff47wzw,1579558584.0,"Well, technically you can impeach a president for absolutely anything. So there's no objective truth as to whether he has done enough to be impeached or not, because every single president in US history would fit that criteria."

MurderedByWords,ff4995b,t1_ff47qx8,1579558319.0,The Republican Party was never like this. It used to be a Libertarian party which pushed small government as well as conservative values. Trump is just a populist who has held every position under the sun at this point. But I think that he's done irreversible damage to the party and I don't think it will ever go back to how it used to be under Reagan.
MurderedByWords,ff492rn,t1_ff486x4,1579558209.0,"Ben Shapiro felt the same way too. He voted for Gary Johnson in the 2016 election. I think he'd vote for Trump in 2020, but not because he particularly likes him, but because all of the possible damage that Trump could have caused to the party has already been done."
MurderedByWords,ff48ju3,t3_erhlgt,1579557878.0,"As a Republican, I'm not sure how I feel about Trump. I still have no idea what he believes as he's held every possible position under the sun, and I think that he may have damaged the party beyond repair."
facepalm,ff1h8n8,t1_ff12ael,1579479187.0,"I just watched it. It seems like friendly banter to me. Boris and Trump seem like the best of friends whenever they're together.

Having seen Boris Johnson's astonishing victory in our election, I wonder if they'll be anything similar in the US election. It's crazy to think that just 40 years ago, Reagan won 44/50 states, but I don't think Trump could pull off anything similar."
facepalm,ff0wnjt,t1_ff0v321,1579472995.0,"I haven't seen Boris Johnson saying or acting like that, but I could see it coming from the other European leaders. I'm not sure that Trump is actually losing support but it feels like he is. But his approval rating has remained steady for years now."

And if you keep calling them 'bigoted morons', you'll never win them back.

You need to realise why you lost the election, or you'll keep losing every election, and it isn't a healthy democracy when there isn't a strong opposition there to challenge the government."

Edit: I did not expect this comment to be so controversial."
facepalm,fen17k7,t1_femyqza,1579274685.0,"Well, to be fair, he's done or tried to do most of what he promised. When he says ""Make America Great Again"", I interpret that as rebuilding America's economy and strengthening the militaty to make America more independent and powerful on its own, and he's definitely achieved that."
facepalm,fen0w93,t1_femdciw,1579274482.0,"Well, I can tell you that he has our Prime Minister, Boris Johnson's, full support, and Boris is in office until 2024. And through the UK, you'd also have the commonwealth countries like Canada, India and Australia, and Boris could help bridge the cap between the US and Europe. I don't think relationships will be damaged, but I don't think they'll be any better than Obama left them."
facepalm,fembyyg,t1_fem8kjr,1579247866.0,"That's how I felt at 2016. Trump was all over the place with his policy and I didn't know what he supported. It turns out that he's been a pretty Conservative president, and a pretty good Republican but nobody could have predicted what he was going to do. I felt the same way about Obama too. It was all a promise about bringing us together or making America great again, without any clear positions on most things.

I think that people are voting more on character rather than their positions. I think Trump will get re-elected, but I don't know where we'll be left when he's gone."

CrackSupport,fel1s2y,t3_ephxjf,1579212195.0,A few pictures would be helpful.
facepalm,fel1k5m,t1_fel05vs,1579212062.0,"Okay, this makes sense. But about the last part, not a single house Republican supported impeachment, and a few Democrats even sided with the Republicans. It's a weird situation, and I think that regardless, Trump will win 2020 as well.

I don't see a single strong Democrat at the moment who could beat Trump, and also, I don't see a single strong Republican that can replace Trump once he's gone, and I didn't see any strong Republican, besides Cruz, in 2016 either. I really don't see many strong political figures on either side at the moment. I hope things will get a bit more interesting in the future."
facepalm,fekxytz,t1_fekxuon,1579209919.0,"What's the difference unless he's removed from office? I'm British, so excuse me if I'm wrong, but impeached or not, he is still going to be your President right?"

MurderedByWords,febapgp,t1_feb9olr,1578956984.0,"What do you mean ""the rest of the world"". I'm British, and we sort of view Bernie over there how we'd view the Labour Party here - progressive with some socialist policies, like higher tax rates, and healthcare for all as a human right.

I'm not saying that left wing is a bad thing, I only care about the policy and whether it works or not, I couldn't care where you stand on the compass. I hate to use labels like ""far left"" or ""far right"" to try to dismiss people."

MurderedByWords,feb3gfs,t1_feazibh,1578955074.0,"I wouldn't call him a leftist, I'd call him a progressive. He's hardly as moderate as Joe Biden, or even Pete are.

The poll I mentioned in the previous comment is from the FiveThirtyEight website. It's titled ""Who Will Win The 2020 Democratic Nomination?"" and it was updated January the 12th. It shows Biden with a 2 in 5 chance of winning the nomination, and Bernie with a 1 in 4 chance of winning. In 3rd place is Warren with 1 in 8 chance.

My original comment has no poll or citation because, like I stated, it's only my opinion."
MurderedByWords,feay5ua,t1_fearve7,1578953435.0,"This is just my own opinion. I didn't mean to state that as a fact. I think either Bernie or Biden will get nominated though, probably Bernie, even though the polls aren't in his favour at the moment. And he may well beat Trump, we'll see. I just don't think Bernie is moderate enough to win back the voters they lost, but Bernie is authentic and an honest guy. I don't agree with him on policy but I respect him a lot."

MurderedByWords,fe9fz5g,t1_fe93ogc,1578937217.0,"Oh no, I'm not trolling. I just don't really believe that he's the awful liar that some people say that he is. I think that you could apply the same amount of scrutiny to statements that lots more people could make. 

I'm not sure about that 9/11 comment, but I know that here in Britain, celebration of 9/11 has been a genuine problem in the past, by a tiny minority of people. I can see what he said being plausible but I would have to look into that, I'll probably have a look after I finish this reply. And about the inauguration comment, Trump has a big ego. It's easily disproved, and nobody cares about the size of his crowds regardless. But I think he genuinely believed what he said, and that he wants to feel better about himself."
MurderedByWords,fe8zkea,t1_fe8xh56,1578932599.0,"Yeah, this is kind of what I can expect from Trump. It's not *entirely* false, but it certainly isn't true either. No Apple Manufacturing plant was opened by him, but it is down to Trump that they stayed in the country and didn't move to China. 

This is kind of what I was trying to say when I said that Trump can over-exaggerate things and is very dramatic. Sure this is a lie, but it's not a serious one. All of his lies are about small, nit-picky things that few people really care about or read."
MurderedByWords,fe8weh5,t1_fe8vh06,1578931809.0,"I don't have to agree with everything that Trump has said previously, but I do agree with this specific statement, and every liberal-minded person should."

Because the few lies that are shown in the links are just some nit-picky things that are mostly subjective statements, which are neither true nor untrue. For example, ""The wall is going up at a very rapid pace"". Whether you think this statement is true or untrue depends on how fast you think ""rapid"" is, and the speed at which you initially thought the wall would be built at. You could apply the same kind of scrutiny to any statement made by anyone. None of these statements are objectively right or wrong, it just depends on who is reading them, and what their take is."

I guess what I need to do is try to get some lag on the control rotation, so that the camera moves in time, but that the rotation of my mesh is slightly delayed after moving my camera. I'm beginning to think that it would be much easier just to do a normal first person camera."
unrealengine,fe3rnx5,t1_fe3pouk,1578852182.0,"The problem I get with this is that my camera is also attached to my mesh because I'm doing a true fps camera, so I have an entire humanoid mesh and I can see my feet when I look down. So even if I added a spring arm with camera lag on the gun, it would keep leaving my hands whenever I turn."
unrealengine,fe3letk,t1_fe3edi3,1578850340.0,"I was just wondering if I could see how VR works in the engine, like the blueprint code for it, without playing the game. But it turns out that I can't even load the project, probably until I get a headset."
unrealengine,fe3l2pq,t1_fe360w1,1578850254.0,"Yeah, I'm thinking of getting a Rift S. I was just trying to see if it was possible to load a VR project without a VR headset. It turns out, it isn't."
politics,fdlo6sl,t1_fdli2s4,1578528506.0,"Are you keeping up? This whole thing is basically over now. Both countries have agreed to not attack each other any further.

But about 'Peace through Strength', this attack on US bases killed nobody, and that was intentional. Iran knew that if they killed anybody, then they'd start a war they couldn't finish, but they still had to save face somehow. Trump knows this and this is why he hasn't responded with the military. Instead he has promised to impose economic sanctions, and has offered to negotiate a peace deal.

The killing of Soleimani showed Iran that you can't attack the US and kill their troops or the US will destroy them. Iran clearly got the message, and their most recent attack shows this. I don't think Iran will ever try something like the recent assault on the US Embassy again for a while, because of the strength Trump showed."
politics,fdl05dq,t1_fdkvhk7,1578514702.0,"Are you saying that Trump can't change his mind on anything, or that he can never realise that he's been wrong in the past? I wouldn't say that 2 days is too late to walk back a comment he made regarding cultural sites in Iran.

This whole 'war crime' thing is such a small issue when compared to what he's done these last few days. He has no intention of retaliating right now because he knows that Iran doesn't either, when they fired 22 missiles into the dirt. A terrorist is dead and not one American is dead. Honestly, I'm impressed."
politics,fdkv3in,t1_fdktm0i,1578511772.0,"I never said that he did. What I am saying though is that he has no intention of committing any war crimes, as he's shown with his most recent activity. So whatever he said on Twitter a few days ago, or whatever the original comment was implying, is meaningless."
