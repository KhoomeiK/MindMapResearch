>Which detail on the land is crucial to still call it land by your definition? A mountain? A boulder? A rock? A pebble?

OP wrote ""most amount of land"", he didnt write most mountains, valleys, distinguishable objects or anything like that. So I understand what you are trying to say, even though it has nothing to do with the main post."
Showerthoughts,ff9v495,t1_ff9qb7i,1579722135.0,Because you are not making a point... its just a subjective feeling that you dont see all when its too far away. You are the one who should think harder.

Which detail on the land is crucial to still call it land by your definition? A mountain? A boulder? A rock? A pebble?

pics,ff2pvoc,t1_ff2lwn1,1579518500.0,"sorry, i should have gone more into detail since i only referred to this example with very low speed differences. With retrograde/prograde movement the orbit and therefor speed changes, but the difference is so small that the orbits of both objects will be very close for a pretty long time around the point they separated. So they will be able to catch him around the separation-point a bit earlier or later depending on if it was prograde or retrograde movement.

For the inclination-change there will be 2 intersections since there is no change to orbit-height."
pics,ff2plwj,t1_ff2mhct,1579518104.0,"ok, I will add a bit more to be not misunderstood. Yes, prograde and retrograde movement will change the orbit and therefor the speed. That will let him theoretically arrive to soon or to late. Keep one thing in mind, the orbit change with this small speedchange is almost negligible so there will be a huge section of the orbit where shuttle and astronaut will be close enough to catch.

It would not work with stronger speedchanges, it was just referring to this example with minimal speed-differences."

Prograde/Retrograde drift: They meet after one orbit since it only changes the orbit height on the other side of the earth

inclination change: They meet on the other side of the earth and at the point they started"
