>House Democrats' ""Abuse of Power"" Claim would do lasting damage to the separation of powers under the Constitution 

So Congress cannot go through Constitutional Checks and Balances because that would violate the separation of powers that Checks and Balances are in place to protect. I had to go to the source because I thought that headline had to be sensationalized but the Legal Team's 6 page response really is nonsense to the Nth degree. Their main argument seems to be ""you are just doing this to overturn an election"", There was no Quid Pro Quo because Ukrainian officials called it ""'good' and Normal'"", and that Presidential Confidentiality because ""national interest"" is a sacred Bond.

But all that is toped by the Conclusion where they go full on Palpatine saying
