felinebehavior,ffej27m,t3_esy838,1579850041.0,"Keep them separated for now, and have a base area for each one set up. And the things they lay on, like beds toys and blankets, switch between bases. When you introduce these items to the other cat,give them a treat, the older male will prob like catnip flavored treats, greenies has some food ones. They will learn to associate the others smell with good things with out the other being there and scaring eachother. Do this for about a month, less if you have a feeling they are ready, then go back to slowly introducing them in person, like meal time between doors, closer each meal. 

I recommend looking at jackson galaxys youtube, he has videos detailing the process."

CATHELP,ffbgutz,t3_eso9ee,1579764704.0,"Take her to the vet, and make sure they check everything including her teeth. A sudden behavior change is always good to follow up with a vet. Please dont put your cat outside, no matter what people say its absolutely always unsafe to leave any kind of pet unsupervised"

seniorkitties,ffajr07,t3_esjpx2,1579737457.0,"I think regular vet check ups, especially at his age, is a good thing. It may be a simple fix that the vet will be able to point out. 

There is not a lot of info here about his life style and eating habits to come to a conclusion. He may want attention or he may be hungry. How often are his meals? Maybe smaller portions and more meals thro the day might fix that? 

I've also heard wanting more attention and also wanting no attention are signs he knows his time is soon, but i wouldnt place my bets on it, but definitely a vet visit. Not knowing what could potentially be wrong won't make it go away, and if he does need a lot of work done, its cheaper and easier on you and him with early diagnosis.

He seems spunky tho, im sure he'll make it to at least 25 lol. Best of luck with this whiny baby :)"
dbz,ffach3l,t1_ffa685o,1579732285.0,"Cats are an invasive species in the west, its humans fault and duty to deal with it in a humane way. Cats like any other animal trying to survive in the urban setting are subject to many illnesses and being run over. TNR is the perfect way to deal with the cats so it will lead to less feral kittens and more cats having bad lives. There is a way to fix this and making up excuses to not care will do nothing but give you false a reason to not care.

Comparing cats to deer and crocodile is foolish, cause like i said, cats are an invasive species and the reason there are so many street cats are cause of humans not fixing their pet cats and letting them roam the streets or abandoning them all together. Human made problems mean there needs to be a human solution. Deer and crocodile will rarely go into urban settings and when they do animal control or a good person with tools and knowledge to handle it themselves is the solution."

Keep litter boxes cleaned out daily, with no tops on, he may not wanna use the litter box cause hes scared of the other cats and doesnt wanna be potentially trapped there. 

Also on chewy they have litter attractant that works wonders. Def get that."
CATHELP,fepuh84,t3_eqcboi,1579331747.0,"Hm hard to say.

catcare,feouu5h,t3_eq8ou4,1579305925.0,"1) sounds like the breeder you got her from isn't the best. Kitten is showing signs of a kitten who use to starve and thus the defensive behavior. 

2) the constant diarrhea may be due to a food intolerance, try limited ingredient diets and try and find a food that doesn't upset her stomach. You can google a list of most common cat food allergies and go down the list from there. Mine has one for seafood. 

3) dry food isnt the best and i suggest feeding dry and wet or just wet. When eating only dry cats will continue to think they are hungry because their brain knows they dont have enough nutrition and will think its still hungry. 

If the eating all food around her  is persistent, you can get a collar activated bowl, itll only open for the cat wearing the chip that activates it. [feeder](https://www.chewy.com/surefeed-microchip-small-dog-cat/dp/157144)"
CATHELP,fema2cn,t3_epvi7r,1579245453.0,"Hey! Id love to help you with this handsome kitty but lemme ask some questions first. About how old is he? How long have you had him and how did you get him? 
How are you feeding him? Free feeding or meals? Does he have trouble finishing his food? 

The throwing up thing could have been due to a food intolerance, one of mine has one and it took me a while to pin it down but I think I finally got it, so if your cat starts to throw up again I'd suggest trying to pin point the ingredient that causes it. Also wet food just tends to be better in general, many cat's don't drink enough water, so a full wet diet is fantastic, but many vets will suggest giving cats some form of kibble for teeth health. If you are close to a pet store I suggest the Greenies brand dental treats. If these make him sick, any kind of dry treat or food should be avoided at that point. 

For washing his coat, They have wet wipes made especially for cats, and they are available pretty cheap at walmart if this is a shopping option where you live. Should also be at the pet store :). Since you say kitty doesn't like being picked up (which is normal) you can very slowly get him used to being handled by  starting off just very very slighting lifting his weight for a few seconds. If he isn't bothered by this continue to do it often then try and see if he'll allow you to do it for a few seconds longer or higher, but go very slow with him since he may be a nervous kitty. One of my cats never let me hold him for more than a few slight seconds, now hell tolerate me and others holding him for about a minute! Just takes love and patience. (Greenies also has healthy cost treat options, if he takes well to kibble treats, but buy only a small bag of one since it may be unknown how he will fair after eating some) 

For gaining weight, this i feel really needs to be first went over with a vet, but kitten food is higher in fat content since kittens need it to grow. If you decide to do this keep it to a minimum to see how he takes to it.

Also please google and see if you area has low cost vet options. Some clinics are for low income homes that need pet care assistance and will offer cheap options. I was able to afford surgery for my cat this way. He should definitely have a check up, to see if he is too skinny or perhaps naturally small. Also just to make sure his health is in order :) if there are no low cost clinics, calling around regular vet clinics and explaining your situation and how you don't know if you will be able to afford a visit, they may be willing to work something out with you."
catcare,felu9ol,t3_eprdq3,1579231089.0,"I tend to not trust science diet personally, its made my cat throw up on more than one occasion from different batches and on wet and dry food and he isnt the type to get upset stomach easily. I also don't trust it cause many vet clinics are sponsored by it, and on top of that the main ingredients are nothing to write home about, definitely not worth the price for the product. 

I suggest seeing another vet for a second opinion, one that hopefully isn't pushing a sponsorship onto you. Do some research on a good vet in your area as well as what you think would be best food for your cat."
felinebehavior,fela6gi,t3_epom5r,1579217431.0,"Not sure if it'll help a case this bad but what i do when my cats are meowing and crying before its dinner time i'll give them some milk for cats, or you could even give yours some low or no sodium chicken broth with no onion or garlic added (toxic to both cats and dogs) they also sell chicken broth for pets at the pet stores. It'll also help his health a lot since hydration does wonders for animals. 

Also what brand of wet food are you giving him? I know cats will continue to think they are hungry when they aren't getting all the nutrition they need. Couldn't hurt to try a new brand or get the refrigerated kibble, since its not dry food and prob the healthiest consumer option (not a vet tho, so do not take my word on that, it's best to talk to your vet if you want to know their opinions on what's the healthiest option you can purchase) 

Making cat food is also an option, i occasionally do it for my cats, you will need to buy some vitamins for this so it'll be an investment but over time you could save money as you could buy meat in bulk, prepare it all and seperate portions and freeze the ones that arnt being used. Not a option everyone can do but I thought I'd bring it up anyway. Here is the recipe i use [cat food recipe](http://thespiceoflife.us/recipe/home-made-cat-food-chicken/)"
