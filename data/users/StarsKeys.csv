work,fegjz42,t3_eozndi,1579095065.0,"Your company has a no tolerance policy but she kept her job? That sounds pretty tolerant to me. Based on the information provided you are being unfairly disciplined for reporting your manager.

HR is not your friend, they exist to protect the company, not you or your rights. 

Definitely report your manager to HR for the retaliation but start keeping a daily log of everything that goes on. Keep copies of anything they ask you to sign, of any write ups, put your complaints in writing and keep copies of those. Understand your rights as an employee and know when it's time to either cut your losses or find an attorney."

The fact that this guy is already trying to cherry pick tasks before he's even been offered the job is a huge red flag and his buddy pretending he's the company's only hope is just drama waiting to happen. 

Since it sounds like your manager already has their mind made up about this guy you don't want to go too negative about him. I would ask your manager for a very clear list of which tasks each of you will get. But if it's obvious this guy is heavily favored you may want to start looking elsewhere."

work,fe5zkv6,t1_fe5xeqy,1578878456.0,"I'm going to walk back part of my original comment because I've given it more thought and it would not be in HRs best interest to fire him. If they were to fire him for what happened then they would be admitting wrongdoing, which they would not do because it would open the company to litigation. If they fired him it could open them up to being sued by her for sexual harassment and by him for wrongful termination.  

Obviously what he did was morally corrupt but that doesn't mean it was illegal or against any company policy. If the company has rules against managers sleeping with subordinates then it's pretty clear he was in the wrong. Legally he lied to get sex, which can in some states be considered rape or sexual assault even if she consented because her consent was contingent on a falsehood. But unfortunately all of this comes down to he said she said, if there's no proof then did it even really happen. He was no doubt in the wrong, lying to get sex is wrong, but there really wouldn't be a lot HR could do even if they did believe her."
work,fe5tdcq,t3_envnhp,1578874511.0,"From an HR standpoint they will do the least amount they have to do to protect the company. At worst they might fire the guy, but since your friend was just a temporary employee they likely would tell her they will take care of it internally and hope she just goes away. Unless a lawyer for your friend got involved HR really wouldn't be compelled to do anything. How far it would go if a lawyer was involved, I have no idea, IANAL. But HR are also not lawyers, they basically know what's in the company handbook and what forms need to be filled out in case of an incident."
