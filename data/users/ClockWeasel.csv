But there are good snackies at the pet store for treats! Ferrets are notorious about fickle taste, so you may wind up with partial bags of different flavors. They’ll come back to them when they get fickle about another flavor. Also, small pieces of dog jerky are 100% okay for ferrets but then you have to clean up wherever they hide to cronch, since they have crumbs."

When you’re stone broke, buying trinkets while window shopping on a date or ‘just because’ flowers is not gonna happen. But you can send texts with the thoughts and maybe a cute pic or meme. Heck, be anachronistic and ask your mom if she has a few sheets of nice writing paper to mail her a letter—you know her girlfriends never got one of those."

You’re planning to go purple, which is also a dark color (which I totally want to do but the cold hair wash is beyond my commitment level). Black hair dye is linked to serious health issues.
