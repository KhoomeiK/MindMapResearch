suggestmeabook,ff93dlk,t3_esbowp,1579703858.0,I just finished listening to The Last Wish!!! It was awesome. The names are a little odd and having watched the show actually helped me know who was who.  I finished listening to it last night and already have Sword of Destiny queued up to listen to on my way to work today!

memes,ff3k4yz,t1_ff3gz1w,1579542761.0,Honestly I wouldn’t put it past a Texan. Even if it doesn’t hold any weight legally the symbolism of their son being born a Texan is probably super important to them.
Jigsawpuzzles,ff3ir74,t1_ff2pdhk,1579541915.0,It was a lot harder than I was expecting but we had a lot of fun putting it together!
Jigsawpuzzles,ff2hgbd,t3_era1de,1579506299.0,"I use puzzle glue, you can get it at Walmart for like $5. You just spread it on the top side and then let it dry overnight. Once it’s dry you can pick it up and don’t have to worry about it falling apart. Then it’s as easy as getting the right size frame. 

If you can’t find a frame that is the right size you can use poster board as a backing and then you will just have a little boarder of whatever color around your puzzle.  If you look at my profile you can see the Yoda puzzle in a frame, it’s small but it has a black space on the top and bottom that’s the poster board."

bookporn,femzvqw,t1_fempb19,1579273809.0,"My grandma kept about 1/4th of his books. She couldn’t fit any of her books on the shelf so she cleaned out some of his, but she is super sentimental so she kept a couple shelf’s of his books. I also asked her ahead of time if this is something she would want and she was super excited for it. She loves things like this, and helped pick out the book. 

I appreciate your concern for her feelings, and I could see how that could be the case in a lot of situations, but I made sure she was okay with it. Also my grandpa passes almost 2 years ago so she is to the point where she wants to get rid of a lot of his stuff but still save some of it for sentimental value.

Also, not to put words in Saints mouth, but I got the feeling he didn’t like it because I defaced a book, not because he was worried about my grandmas feelings?"

[Wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Canon) : As of April 25, 2014, the only previously published materials that are considered canon are the six Star Wars films, the Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series and film, and Part I of the short story Blade Squadron. Meanwhile, the Expanded Universe is no longer considered canon[1] and was re-termed as the ""Legends"" brand."
