On the 4th I did the test in Perth (Scotland) and as soon as we left the test centre the examiner put his folder on the dash of the truck and didn't pick it up until the end.

Luckily if I decide I want to drive artics I only need to do one more practical test but I'm honestly not sure if I'm willing to do more driving tests (if I wanted to drive buses it'd be the whole thing all over again).

And to top it off if you take your test in an automatic car you can only legally drive automatics until you take the test again in a manual (though that doesn't matter much since most people do their lessons and tests in a manual).
