It never got better.** We had the same exhausting conversations *for years* and he still wouldn't do any housework. When we broke up he was in his 30s. 

There's no secret. They act like that because they feel like they get to. They justify it however they need to in their own mind. You complaining, troubleshooting, nagging, proposing solutions, those are just little annoying things you do once in a while and if they can get you through your little tantrum all is right in the world. They don't care how you feel about it. They don't want to do housework so they don't have to. That's it. 

Let yourself be angry about it. It's bullshit."
glow,feexubf,t3_eoss42,1579043581.0,"I'll try to state my opinion without spoilers, but I think later in the show some of the things she deals with make this mistake a little more human. 

Debbie has incredibly high standards for herself, and I saw that scene as more representative of her struggle than how she really feels about Ruth. It all revolves around this rigid structure of womanhood, and what that means for her. It's why she can't allow herself to get close to Ruth again, it's why she can't >!eat a god damned cheeseburger!<, and it's why she can't participate in the show without distinguishing herself as better than the rest, she's the star AND a producer AND a mom and she has to do it all flawlessly. 

I saw that scene as Debbie talking more to herself than to Ruth. As the story goes on she gets SO wrapped up in herself and her drama that the issues with Ruth don't even matter anymore beyond the principle. She's telling herself more than anything that you have to bend to men, it's the only way, and if you don't you're a stupid girl who won't get anywhere in life and it's all your fault. 

I love Debbie as a character even though I would not like her as a person, if I knew her in real life. She's the pageant girl, straining against the rigid expectations but also sharing those same expectations for herself. She IS the female struggle. Do what they want, or do what you want, there is no inbetween. I'm really glad we're getting a nuanced, rounded character who deals with this story directly. I also really like that she makes some horrible mistakes (same as Ruth does). She's not perfect, she can't be, but she's not completely evil either. It's just tough. She doesn't deal well."

But I'm okay with that. I'll probably put another 500 hours in over time. It means the game isn't ever really finished, but I get soooo good at the start.
