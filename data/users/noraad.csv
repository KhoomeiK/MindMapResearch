therewasanattempt,ffafsi8,t1_ffaenpt,1579734727.0,That seems like an excellent way of proceeding. The idea that restorationists of years past destroyed some of the original seemed to have swung things to the side of preservation only - and limiting the current artistic impact of the piece because of damage that due to custom won't be repaired.

I've always found restoration as a science to be subject to the whims of the period in which it's accomplished, rather than the reality of the original. I'd argue it should be done with a nod toward the intention of the original, which is a more slippery slope but provides better ""translation"" to those viewing art in current times.
