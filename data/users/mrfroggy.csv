toronto,fgisj05,t1_fgifl0t,1580829951.0,"I was passing through Vancouver airport about 10 years ago and I was randomly selected for a swipe where they’re looking for explosives/drugs/whatever. The machine beeped saying I had something on me, the supervisor swivelled around and was like “No! That machine’s out of order! Don’t calibrate it on actual passengers!” and then she apologized and said she knew I was almost certainly clean, but once the machine beeps there’s a whole procedure to go through...

I was taken aside and the went through my bag inch by inch checking every item. I made my flight with a couple of minutes to spare.

Funny thing was, since they were 99% sure it was a false positive the supervisor went and got some trainee to do my bag inspection. I was pretty grumpy by this point and, you know, if looks could kill... Trainee security kid was literally shaking as he went through my bag. God help us if he encountered an actual active terrorist."

He's a pretty interesting guy. He made a ton of money from electronics stores in Australia in the 70s, made a bunch of aviation achievements (first solo flight around the world in a helicopter, first flight to the North Pole in a helicopter, etc), and after all his flying adventures became an environmentalist and started magazines and such about the beauty of the world. And then he got upset about foreign ownership of Australian brands, so he did locally-owned copy-cat versions of things, often with humours names (such as the Dickhead matches).

Maybe once a month he won’t come when I call. Which will lead to me crawling around the house looking under beds and sofas to make sure he’s ok.
