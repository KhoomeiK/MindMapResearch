relationships,ffi1vss,t3_etk1wf,1579962615.0,"I like to be left alone physically when I’m ill. I am like the dog who just wants to get into its basket and wait for things to pass. 

Feeling ill really crashes my mood and I feel grumpy, irritable and guilty for inflicting this on people who are trying to help. I feel I’m doing the right thing not to put that on people.

But my GF likes to be snuggled and held when ill and I can happily do that for her but she feels rejected when I don’t let her do it for me.

It’s useful to discuss the language and feelings you have about illness and caring outside the period of illness to read each other better.

But in the immediate period now I find it really helpful when my GF acknowledges my preference to be alone but keeps in touch by texts, memes etc that are low pressure. This means we get both our needs met and prevents resentment and miscommunication.

She also checks in if she can pop by for 5 minutes to drop off milk and bread, gives me a hug and tells me she loves me. And sometimes puts a little note or treat in too. She’ll also offer to change linens or ask if I need anything posted etc.

Then when I’m better I thank her, show my appreciation and we check in to see if anything needs talked about. I’ve been teaching myself to let her in more to match her willingness to respect my need for being alone.

Both of us really work on whether we are doing said thing for the good of the other person rather than to meet our own needs and that makes a big difference. It’s taken a while to get a good balance but it’s been beneficial for all parts of our relationship to use it as a way to communicate.

I know now what she needs when unwell (comfort food, lots of holding, physical affection) and we both worry less about the other and feel less helpless and upset."

But she’s a junkie who stole from you, is still using, isn’t sorry except that you caught her and you are expected to play nice while she still fucks your credit rating? I think one angry moment of calling her a fucking junkie is quite moderate.

I suggest some therapy and support for you to step away from her and the family enablers who aren’t paying down a debt but expecting you to. Private therapy is great if you can afford it and you can also research the Narc-Anon for family members and other support groups you can attend for free.

relationships,ff7ljzg,t3_erz33i,1579652435.0,"I have gone no contact with my entire family so here’s my tips having done this multiple times:

Write a card saying ‘until X issue between us changes I cannot have any contact of any kind with you.’

This phrasing gives no JADE (justify argue defend explain) and puts the onus back on them to react. Ball’s in their court to sort it. They’ll show the card to everyone and reasonable people read the real message you wrote.

Photograph the card before you send it as proof you have requested no contact in case of stalking.

Don’t engage with any responses from anyone. Learn to grey rock. Learn to block. Don’t give out numbers or addresses. You can go on the electoral register in the UK and not show up if you request.

Lock down social media. Be careful with work stuff that shows where you live or work. Find ways to respond emotionally like journalling, therapy etc instead of responding directly to family, friends or flying monkeys.

Do not recruit anyone to your side. Stay easy breezy neutral with phrases like ‘I can’t discuss it’ or ‘I wouldn’t want to compromise anyone’ or anything else that states a boundary that shows you who is willing to respect it or who is willing to stomp it for gossip.

Practise phrases like ‘I’m not close to family’ or ‘I don’t keep in touch with family’ that shut down people asking stuff like ‘are your parents coming to the wedding’. It’s polite but a dead end.

And then you just keep doing it every day until it gets more natural. Estrangement often feels difficult because of the unresolved issues it raises but the actual silence is surprisingly easy. People don’t like to hear that though. It scares and unsettles them too much.

Be discreet who you share the big stuff with. A lot of people will sniff weaknesses to exploit when you are estranged especially when you are young, in a foreign country and grieving. I learned that the hardest way possible."

When I was severely underweight I never heard the end of it. I worked in fashion and the models used to tell me I was too thin.

I also got sexually harassed constantly and sexually assaulted due to being anorexia. Lots of people emotionally abused me for it. I was blamed for ‘making’ other people anorexic. I was ostracised when another girl I knew ended up hospitalised and said I’d bullied her into getting so thin she was sectioned.

People tried to physically force feed me. They spiked my food and drink with calorific food. They refused to let me lead my life trying to police me to the extent of not being left alone. They treated me like the addict I essentially was and it was not pretty. The dark shit decreased hugely when I still had an ED but wasn’t underweight. My lowest BMI was low but not gasp in the street pose in in The Daily Mail in white underwear talking about the specialist clinic low.

This is why I don’t believe these FAs who claim to have been anorexic. If they had they’d known everyone including other anorexics give you endless shit about it. There’s the occasional compliment from people who don’t realise or from anorexia groupies who want your thin glory by standing close but it’s non stop fucking earache being underweight.

I gained 60 pounds on my lowest weight in 4 years and was in the low overweight BMI due to a lot of bingeing and not one person said anything negative. People were fucking clapping for me despite the fact I was as ill as when my hipbones bruised my own stomach.

I knew my BF was a keeper when he saw my stuffed animal on the bed and carefully picked him up and set him on the table before we had sex and asked did he need to have his eyes covered?

When I started staying over at his house I really struggled to sleep without my stuffed animal but felt too silly as a grown woman to bring him. So I hinted that all the change was difficult and discussed the feelings the stuffed animal soothed without directly saying I couldn’t sleep without this lump of fabric.

Next time I stayed over my BF had bought one of those Japanese cuddle pillows in the shape of animals like whales/dolphins etc that double as a cushion and a comforter and sleep aid. 

It really helped to have the neutral item to transition over. It soothed the feelings I had, saved either of us having to discuss the stuffed animal in the room and gave us something new to bond over which removed the neediness/shame issue and kind of made a ‘thing’ in a good way out of it all.

We picked out a name, made up a backstory for the ‘new arrival’ and helped develop more coping strategies for me without drawing attention to the vulnerability while still being vulnerable with my BF because I needed him to understand the feelings even if he didn’t understand the way I soothed them.

And now my strapping ex military BF has his own pillow to keep the first one company which he sleeps with when I’m not there. I’ve caught him talking to them both when I’m not looking and he still treats my original guy like the man of my house.

relationships,feh3dzr,t3_ep3lrm,1579108315.0,"This sounds like ARFID. Avoidant restrictive Food Intake Disorder. 

It’s more like a phobia of eating based around texture, feel of chewing, sensations of swallowing, taste, fear of choking, fear of vomiting or loss of control during eating. 

It’s very much about the mechanics of consuming food rather than the emotions or impacts of having consumed food such as body image, weight or guilt and shame like with anorexia or bulimia nervosa.

It can be separate to emotional ED like anorexia or bulimia or overlap after things like forcefeeding or when ED has disability roots such as digestive issues or autism spectrum issues or sensory processing disorders.

It can also be rooted in anxiety disorders such as OCD or phobias such as emetophobia. It can be caused by childhood trauma or distress around food such as texture issues, eating unexpected foods or spice or simply develop as a control mechanism where food stands in for something else the person fears or cannot control.

At their heart all eating disorders are not really about food. The food is the indicator for the underlying issue. People with ED aren’t just hungry or not interested in food anymore than alcoholics are just really thirsty.

ARFID is a fairly new diagnosis. It only went into the DSM-V and has been stigmatised as ‘picky eating’ but is much deeper than that and requires professional intervention. I’m not in the USA but I think NEDA have a section on it and the UK site B-EAT does. 

There is a strong link with autism and aspbergers so a reputable site on Autism such as The National Autistic Society will cover it. Look for people under #actuallyautistic on Twitter linking to sites that advocate for people with ASD and avoid Autism Speaks who are extremely harmful in their attitudes to autistic people.

There are therapists your BF can work with and often through these orgs these are on a sliding scale of cost and specialised compared to general therapists. You can also access info about how to support your BF without enabling or pushing him into trying too much too soon and help protect your own boundaries and needs.

I have ARFID as part of my restrictive eating disorder diagnosis and a big part of recovery was knowing that my BF would not tolerate nonsense such as melodrama about not being able to eat certain textures but also support me and trust me to push myself. He wouldn’t force food on me but he’d offer it and create a safe environment to challenge my beliefs within.

But that it is because I also sought therapy and work on recovery daily. He will support me not carry me and we’ve both found compromises like cooking sauces separately, eating different things at the same table, cooking together, talking about food outside eating such as shopping, holidays, socialising and finding other ways to meet our needs such him having curry with friends or as one of those ‘me dinners’. 

Ironically I work with food and will cook him anything if I know I don’t have to eat it. I made him five curries at Christmas portioned out for the freezer to say thanks for how many times he’s accommodated me. I also thank him with buying nicer versions of the stuff he likes so if he is buying steak I upgrade to the posh one to acknowledge how much energy my ED takes out of him.

relationships,feh0gha,t3_ep1z1s,1579106550.0,"Let me preface this with the fact I have 7 mental health disorders plus a disabling physical illness. Living well with multiple conditions is hard work and I applaud you for the successes you’ve created.

But as someone double your age and who has been living with ill health longer than both of you combined have been alive, here is one of the key things I’ve learned that has helped me as much as treatment.

No amount of insight, health management or awareness raising on our part alters the fact sometimes other people can’t relate or have their own shit going on. Your illness(es) cannot always trump their humanity.

You cannot expect a higher standard of them than you give them. You are not perfect 100% all the time and neither are they. Learning how to cope with imperfection around us is part of managing long term conditions. We only learn how well we are doing when we challenge ourselves instead of always being in our bubble.

As long as no one is abusing you or harming you by prohibiting things you need to manage your health, then sometimes they need to take the kid gloves off and treat you like they’d treat anyone. Expecting special treatment rather than equality because we are ill can become manipulative without meaning to or create caregiver burnout.

How we receive the care people give us is crucial. We should not feel guilty for needing specific care but that doesn’t mean taking it for granted. We can show gratitude without the imbalance being told to be grateful. We can give back as well as take by offering our caregivers and supporters mutual relationships and room to express themselves even if that’s different to our expression.

We may have reasons we can’t do stuff but we have to be careful not to suck all the oxygen out of the relationship only focusing on can’ts instead of adapting to what we can do. It can become tempting to use our illness as an excuse not a reason.

And trust me, it gets tiring fast when you have a sick note for all your behaviours and then try to use it to police someone else’s too. 

Your BF is 20, he sounds supportive generally, why can’t he have an off day without you using your brain chemistry to brain-splain him otherwise? A little understanding on your part makes you a team and partnership not patient and care giver."

Plus as a poly triad we have to balance up sex as the three of us and the sex each of us needs as the couples with the triad. Then someone might also need to masturbate because sexual contact with self still counts in libido.

All of us in my relationship would happily have sex with multiple partners every day. It still averages out 1-3 times a week because life overrides libido no matter how important sex is to us.

The only way I ever made daily sex and life compatible long term was when I was a sex worker and it paid the bills. Even then there were still pay offs.

In my opinion though EDs overlap with addiction issues and being actively addicted can make people behave selfishly. But sometimes selfish people can also be addicts. It’s why I think it’s unhelpful to make blanket statements about ‘all people who X’.

I understand that dealing with anyone who is exhibiting addictive behaviours can be draining and needs boundaries. But I do not understand why people sign up to be nurses or doctors or therapists if they cannot handle the flaws and foibles and fuck ups of people seeking medical care.

Having never been fat I would not presume to say how fat people are treated. I suspect many have had some stigma for their weight either passively or actively and in some cases that is harming someone with mental health issues too.

However the idea that anorexics are showered with kindness and help compared to fat people is so crucial to so much FA/HAES mentality that I feel the need to point it out because a lot of the nastiness toward thin people with EDs comes from fat people including those with EDs.

This punching down is bullying and mental health stigma and frankly if fat people want respect and to be listened to about their weight then they should damn well lead by example since they are now the majority.

So I can say that two things are true at once: portion control will save money and high calorie food is often cheaper than ‘healthy’ food.

I couldn’t afford a lot of what other people treat themselves with when I was poor. Even Netflix was out of my budget. No socialising, eating out, cinema, buying a book or music. But I could afford £1 every so often on something to eat. 

Here that could buy 5 custard filled donuts from the local supermarket. So £5 a week ‘treat money’ couldn’t buy me any of the stuff above but it could buy me 25 donuts. 

I’m going to guess they are about 250 calories each so an extra 1250 calories a day or 6250 calories a week. About a 2lb weight gain a week or 104 a year if you eat to TDEE the rest of the time on frugal food.

And before someone says but Netflix costs £5 a month, a lot of the things people reward themselves involve access to transport, a decent credit rating, a bank account that allows full financial inclusion and safe access to them.

But you just need to round £1 every day in leftover coins from paying the electric top up and you’ve got something immediately available to you that gives you a reason to leave the house, chat to someone and engage and forget all the other things you had say no to like doing laundry because you needed the electric to wash your hair today or not cooking because you need a bus fare to the hospital on Friday.

No major country sets social security at a level even close to above the poverty line. Most reassess this once a decade at most. This level of income such as unemployment benefit or sickness benefits across the global north is deliberately set to be less than what i needed to reach the poverty line. It is fucking hard and getting off it is even harder with the way tax and wages taper offs happen plus the underlying reasons remain unaddressed.

Now I never ate donuts or spent my money on cheap high calorie food because I’m a recovering anorexic. But I struggled with willpower during that time on other short term choices that made bad long term decisions.

Then I went back to work and my food insecurity was solved overnight. I was warm, I wasn’t hungry and I had stability and almost instantly my willpower reappeared. People in the high stress of poverty make survival level decisions and while CICO applies I can completely understand why often cheap comforting food or portion control is the one thing people don’t deny themselves in a world of having to deny yourself.

Yes, they’d save £5 a week and all those calories but the human mind is more wired to small regular pleasantries than one big nice thing so asking poor people to override biology consistently is huge.

But there are things they can do to mitigate this. Don’t eat all the donuts every day. Portion control elsewhere. Be honest with yourself. Look for other outlets. Sit with some discomfort. Train yourself off instant gratification. Don’t let 5 donuts become 10 as the weight creeps on. Exercise.

There are reasons the bag of donuts really calls to you in poverty but you don’t have to excuse every call. This is why I say both the statements people make on this subject are true. But the polarising ignores that you can take a little from column A and column B and make more than defending a point ideologically."

I was a heavy drinker in my mid twenties around the mid 00s when that ‘buy two glasses’ thing came in and often drank a bottle of wine a night to myself. I was in a bad place mental healthwise and quite rightly plenty of people expressed concern that I had a problem with alcohol.
Looking back I really did. I ate little and drank a lot.

Now in my early 40s I drink a few times a month at month having a beer, maybe splitting a bottle of wine with my BF once. I get drunk probably twice a year and enjoy it. I feel I have a good relationship with both food and drink now after lots of therapy.

And possibly with that ‘reformed’ mindset I am shocked by how the amount I drank 15 years ago is now badged as some kind of status symbol or aspiration rather than alcohol issues. I see so many women my age giggling about necking 1000 calories of wine a night and then feeding the hangover next day and not seeing either as binge behaviour.

It’s scary how the window has shifted. Beer has had a similar make over as if craft beer is ok to indulge nightly either calorie wise or culturally. And I’m Irish. I grew up in a booze based country.

Also only in my most severe periods of my eating disorder did it take over every single second sleeping or waking.

I was anorexic for a decade without it notably taking up time from school, study, work, socialising, dating etc. My anorexic behaviours were such engrained habits after a while that I didn’t have to think about them and I adjusted everything around them.

That’s actually one of the key aspects that makes it disordered is that you’ve normalised it to the point of thinking you are the reality and everyone is an outlier.

It was only when I would introduce new behaviours like purging or bingeing that it would feel like it took over. Even the intrusive thoughts were normal to me.

I actually got way more shit done when I ate 500 calories a day and exercised compulsively than I did in early recovery where just coping with making dinner took up the whole bandwidth for the day.

It was why it was actually so hard to give up my eating disorder. It felt natural and practical. Also I am from an era where I had to physically look up calorie counts in a literal book I carried round and it still barely took up more than 10 minutes a day and I’m shit at maths.

In the era of apps, calorie counts on packages and menus and the internet, I eye roll at this excuse. A Big Mac is 590 calories in the UK. You need only read or log this once if you do not have a memory impairment. I last ate a Big Mac about 4 years ago yet this information remains as does a rough calorie count for things I consume regularly.

It’s no different to remembering the bus timetable which is always some weird number like 7 minutes past the hour or your password for something or a PIN. All of which humans do instinctively with occasional errors and brain farts but without making such a fucking fuss.

fatlogic,fdmv3r5,t3_em5j5q,1578567222.0,"I was a kid in the 80s and there have been so many small changes.

Snacking was not a thing. It was seen in my country as poor manners to eat in the street or between meals.

Coffee chains did not exist.

Fast food was very limited and birthday party levels of frequency. No drive thrus. No home delivery. Our first McDonalds opened in 1994. 

Ready meals were less common and people did not buy as much pre-made food like sauces in jars. Food was comparitively quite plain and not at all exotic.

We ate sugary or fatty stuff everyday but it was one lunchbox size chocolate biscuit or small pack of crisps.

We walked and moved more without noticing. The gym was not a thing but people did aerobics if fancy and swimming was popular. People went to the leisure centre.

People rarely drank at home. They drank in a pub so plenty of alcholics but the cost moderated the calories. Wine every night was not a thing.

Portion sizes were small. Family size things did not exist. You took seconds if you needed more instead of starting off with the whole meal.

Clothes were expensive and it was a hassle to change sizes by gaining weight. They were also better made and more an investment piece so you just couldn’t afford to be throwaway.

Treats were once a week. Fish and chips on a Friday or Sunday roast. Food was more expensive and people generall couldn’t afford both. Now you can get meal deals of thousands of calories for less than the cost of cooking Sunday lunch for 4.

Jobs were less sedentary. People burned off what they ate. Fewer people had cars so they walked and carried their shopping which limits how much you buy.

Fizzy drinks were something you ordered to be delivered weekly but not really available in shops except in small cans or bottles. Fruit juice was posh and served in tiny glasses as a starter. People drank tea and water mainly maybe squash.

Being fat was stigmatised.

There was one ‘fat’ kid in my class when I started school in 1983. By modern standards he was a bit chubby probably a 27 BMI. He was also the richest kid in the class and the one living the lifestyle closest to now.


In that timeframe my home country has become the fattest nation in Europe. It has obesity levels comparable to the mid table of US States now because these small things all changed at once.

There is no silver bullet. The overconsumption of food is linked to our overconsumption in the West generally and we can’t put the genie back in the bottle without changing all our lifestyle habits.

If someone makes you feel either directly or indirectly that you aren’t enough for them that will erode your sense of self and you shouldn’t sign up for it.

This will end up as much an issue as a dead bedroom or any other kink you don’t share with someone that they need met even occasionally.

I am similar to your GF in that I could be described as a size queen. For me it’s not so much the size of the penis but the feeling of over-fullness during penetrative sex. So it can be a bigger penis or being fucked the way you describe that is that really frantic way. 

However unlike your GF I don’t describe it in such potentially hurtful terms to my male partners or men on the internet generally. I have broken up with partners over it but never saying ‘you aren’t big enough’ but saying general sexual incompatibility. 

I always felt guilty that it might hurt someone needlessly. I’m pretty sure that at some points when younger than I handled it immaturely because it taps into some big taboos about women not being tight and men’s body image.

But for me it’s a kink right from when I first started masturbating as a teen and a huge part of my sex life. I’ve tried more gentle sex and sometimes it feels nice but it’s like an itch doesn’t get scratched but I get a backrub. Nice but not what you needed. My genitals just aren’t wired to feel much without this sensations with penetrative sex.

I’m in my 40s now and I’ve never ‘outgrown’ it but was lucky to find a BF who is sexually compatible and into the same kink and finally get to embrace it without my own shame. 

I suggest you sit down in a non sexual situation with your GF and discuss why she enjoys this and then express how it makes you feel. Talk and listen and in there will be your core answer of ‘are we currently sexually incompatible but could compromise?’ or ‘are we completely incompatible?’ 

The latter is a break up but hopefully by talking to her about why she enjoys size you will be able to take it less personally and not have that little nagging fear of inferiority in your mind around sex.

And this is important: her kink does not trump your autonomy or entitle her to have a free pass to be an asshole about stuff.

Turns out one of the reasons my parents preferred me a struggling grad hating my job and on a shitty salary was that it kept me dependent on them and the carrots they dangled financially and unable to access therapy that opened my eyes to the FOG (fear, obligation and guilt.)

When I finally got to therapy it only took 16 weeks to deprogramme 36 years of their shit and go no contact. It’s been a tough journey but it’s a productive pain. You look back and think ‘I built me’ rather than stuck in that purposeless pain of ‘you broke me.’

relationships,fcync1n,t3_ejjzy7,1578083267.0,"I grew up in a household where asserting a need or a want was to invite actual abuse so I grew up very avoidant attached yet a people pleaser who really struggled with taking initiative in relationships.

Some things I’ve learned in therapy about this:

The uncertainty of thinking about making a decision is always worse than any error in the decision (unless you are dealing with an abuser and then you have a different can of worms to address.)

Practice making decisions when you have no audience or pressure except yourself to get the hang of it. Make yourself make decisions over small things like lunch until it feels more natural.

Realise that when people love us they will excuse our crappy habits for a really long time before they bring them up so your wife is probably at her capacity for this passivity when you are on baby steps. This means she will feel like nothing is enough and get burned out and you will feel like nothing you is enough and get discouraged. 

It will cause friction and recrimination if not addressed so you might want to make one of your first initiatives to arrange therapy either for you individually or as a couple to learn how to communicate your effort and listen to her needs.

Then actually apply what you learn. It’s good to ask what someone wants to get the hang of it. So say ‘wife would you like me to arrange dinner on Friday night?’ and if she says yes, then break it down for yourself using what you already know about her. Does she hate sushi? Does she really want to use the new dinnerware you bought in the summer? Did she mention her friends going to the new pizza place? 

The main thing she wants with initiative is to feel seen and heard. That you’ve listened and noticed the unspoken. That you are sharing the mental load. So asking for a prompt to begin with is like training wheels taking you in the right direction but then you need to speed up and go it alone and spot the stuff like housework, emotional support and family things like making appointments and plans, packing bags, making reservations etc. 

Keep her informed ‘wife I’ve arranged to take the kids to swimming on Tuesday night so if you want I can pick up take out or maybe you are keen to go to book club’ so you are active without being pushy but not being ‘should I take the kids swimming on Tuesday? Is that your book club night?’

Make sure both of you are aware that you may initiate differently to her and not to expect you to do it exactly like her and then actually own your own style of doing stuff. Give her a reason to trust you and then earn that trust.

Good luck. It gets easier with practice I promise."

I had a restrictive ED and it was equally self harming but it gave me a feeling of euphoria and control that made me an unreliable narrator of my own reality and required outside intervention as I was not capable of decisions that were healthy for me. That compassion saved my life and has allowed me to achieve so much more than simply existing.

It was difficult balancing my tendency to restriction with the food intolerances but I learned that eating the foods that made me sick triggered the urge to self harm by disordered eating and honestly nothing tastes good enough to justify a mental breakdown, illness and potential death on the regular unless your thinking is highly disordered.

I had a friend like you who was super sociable, attractive, appealing and meeting lots of people but perpetually single. And the issue was that every second of her life was allocated to friends, family, work and hobbies and there was zero indication she had time or desire to date.

She did not flirt so when she said ‘you should come to this thing’ there was no way people could gauge or guess if it was dating or networking or a casual hang. She went on Tinder and wrote off anyone who expressed any interest that was sexual or flirty and then took weeks to fit the few dates she got into her schedule. 

It often overlapped with meeting in a work scenario so men particularly where very hesitant about being inappropriate or impacting their own reputation or professionalism that they would never make a move and stuck to the cues they were getting from her rather than risking vulnerability and upset. She had so many walls up that she couldn’t see over them herself.

While strong boundaries are useful to dating it can be worth seeing if what you think is a boundary comes across as a brick wall to other people.

Relationships require mutuality. If you like being chased you have to create the chase. Otherwise it’s poking someone who doesn’t seem to want to play and decent people are going to nope out of that game. And if you want to chase you have to look for people who want to play and work for it instead of shrugging out because the first attempt didn’t pan out how you pictured something.

That context makes a massive difference to the answer.

And also you don’t actually mention apologising to him. Offering compensation for the consequences of your actions is not actually an apology. And saying you’ll pay for something without apologising generally has the effect of making people feel like you aren’t taking it seriously or think they are overreacting and not entitled to his feelings.

So on top of driving unsafely, being disrespectful of his property and inconveniencing him into having to find a new car and putting all the labour and effort of that onto him because you couldn’t take a 15 minute break to eat your chicken nuggets, you haven’t apologised and wonder why he’s not over it yet?

You don’t sound very sorry. You sound like you are annoyed by his response and still thinking that throwing money at feelings should make them go away. 

All of these things would be making me reconsider things with you but then wondering if that would mean you don’t pay me anything back and I’m financially vulnerable unless I forgive you

So when I got meningitis B as a young child my medical care was so delayed to cover up their lie that I ended up permanently disabled. I received no care for this disability during childhood for the same reason thus making a bad situation worse.

And then as a disabled adult my parent faked cancer again so that they could avoid paying support for university for me pretending it was needed for their healthcare.

I had to drop out of university, turn to sex work to survive, ended up homeless and have taken 15 years to get out of poverty while they still dine out on the cancer card and the suffering I put them through by screwing up my life while they had cancer.

You think of the internet as somewhere you post a dog photo and your friends post emojis. But it is partly your BF’s workplace and partly a possible arena for bullying of people near him. 

If he is building a following online and prioritising career at 20 in this arena you may not be at compatible life stages. He sounds like he has skipped to an older more mature mindset and you are (not incorrectly) in a college one where your BF writes your name with a heart on his notebook.

It’s a little patronising that he’s deciding you aren’t mature enough to handle a photo or tag of you possibly blowing up online but it also seems based in reality. He’s setting a boundary for safety for both of you and you are trying to stomp that without considering anything except your wants.

Now he might just be playing the field but it sounds in the circumstance of introducing you to his mom and incorporating you into his inner circle he isn’t. Do you want acknowledgement here or do you want go ride some cool coat tails of his success as well?

Often careers or lives we think of as glamorous are lonely and isolating and the people in them need strong boundaries such as privacy or not dating fans to cope with their challenges.

You are setting up pressure on yourself that your first sexual experience will be straight to penis in vagina on a trip away from home which is about as high stress as possible and likely to cause issues and mismatched expectations. It’s like going straight to the 10 metre high dive.

It’s absolutely fine to be a virgin at any age but generally if you are a virgin at an age people may find unusual, it’s a good idea to communicate your inexperience to a partner and/or take action and set boundaries for your own sexual comfort.

This would include things like masturbation, getting to know your own body such as when your menstrual cycle is, sorting birth control and getting comfortable sexually together such as kissing, touching and building up to other sexual acts such as mutual masturbation, oral sex etc.

This takes the pressure off PIV in being the only goal which must be completed in the first time you get naked with someone. That is a very ‘sex is something done to me’ rather than a mutual bonding experience which still centres this idea that virginity is about loss not gain and is inherently sex negative and perpetuates the views that have led you to this situation.

Your BF sounds lovely but if you are still too embarrassed or ashamed to even discuss sex  with him with after 8 months, that is a problematic level of communication. You are leaving him guessing and mind reading instead of talking to him like a partner.

You do not owe him sex but you do owe him communication. He’s booking this trip and he’s asking you about sexual contact by the two beds question and you still aren’t sharing anything vulnerable whether that is fear, excitement, worry or even your level of comfort about nudity he’s going to be on edge all weekend as much as you are.

It’s very vulnerable to initiate sex (even for experienced people) and it seems you aren’t going to after eight months just avoiding it and now you are creating this huge scenario where he has to intuite everything and teach you to high dive without knowing if you can swim or are scared of water.

If you can’t discuss sex with a partner after 8 months you don’t sound entirely ready to have sex.

My BF is 8 years younger and into gaming stuff. I am very into make up. Last time I played a computer game it was an original Gameboy. He doesn’t know make up brands except the ones his mum wore in the 90s. 

We usually buy each other stuff from a wishlist or sex toys to use together as an excellent compromise that age doesn’t impact."

You should admit to your BF what you did and break up with him to work on yourself because it sounds like you aren’t in a place to be a good partner right now.

Good partners do not invade their BF’s privacy and trust, make excuses for their own lack of self awareness and use their partner’s capacity for self reflection and willingness to support them (such as going to your therapy group and doing the exercises) against them.

Unless you are leaving out some serious background about the relationship this is a you problem not a him problem.

Admit your fuck up, apologise for your behaviour and use it as part of your therapy for self development. Don’t pass the buck onto his private thoughts to excuse yourself. It’ll be tough but it will do more for you than pretending."
