singing,fdc6hdr,t3_ekks72,1578268047.0,"Did you talk to your vocal teacher about wanting to learn these things? I don't think most vocal teachers have specific programs outlined. I think it's worth it to find another teacher, if you didn't like that one! 

I'm working with a teacher right now. We're mostly concerned with airflow at this time. We start with warm ups, move on to the pop song, and talk about how I physically felt when it seemed I was struggling or succeeding. If I'm having a bad day, we switch to a song that doesn't test my range so much to protect my vocal chords. You can physically feel when your airflow is getting better because it doesn't feel like your breath is playing red light, green light."

I think most people like to think they have good taste, so complimenting accessories is a safe bet for initiating conversation with anyone.

Also, all women your age are future old ladies. A lot of elderly folk I come across welcome company and have interesting stories and wisdom. If you need help talking to strangers, I think they're good practice. ~~Plus, if they try to mug you, you can out run them easily!~~"
