BikiniBottomTwitter,ffyeaba,t1_ffye5uf,1580344355.0,I don’t know what you mean. Spongebob was originally pitched as a family guy humor-type show. But it ended up being a kids show instead which is much much better.
BikiniBottomTwitter,ffya6cr,t1_ffx32n6,1580341600.0,"I disagree. The magic of Spongebob is the clean humor or if it’s not clean, it’s subtle which makes it funnier. If it was just like Family Guy or something, it wouldnt be nearly as good."

todayilearned,ffy84d5,t3_evr0li,1580340412.0,I can’t believe it’s this easy really. But I do think the idea of giving some money to high school graduates as a little gift for making it that far is a good idea as it encourages people that don’t care about education to just stick through and get their diploma. I imagine these people now have much better careers than they would have if they dropped out. Gotta love Dolly!
WayOfTheBern,ffxqddx,t1_ffxgzww,1580330344.0,"Honestly I can’t think of any strategically valuable Bernie VP picks. So he may as well chose someone like Nina. If AOC wasnt so young, it would 100% be her."

dankmemes,ffwzkzk,t1_ffwu90p,1580314548.0,Ok even if Bernie is some lazy person who doesnt work (he’s not) his statement holds true. His parents were indeed working class without question which means he did in fact come from the working class.

WayOfTheBern,ffvptyd,t1_fftmcbg,1580269950.0,"We have 3 possibilities:
1. Bernie wins enough and has the support of the people but not the majority. Because the people have largely rallied around him and the general public knows he won, the DNC decides fucking him would be a colossal fuckup that would lose them 2020 and future elections as well as end up in the history books forever.

2. Bernie wins enough to gain 51% of delegates, perferably by having Joe do worse than expected on Super Tuesday and having the centrists be disjointed for as long as possible.

3. It’s a very close call with Bernie narrowly winning. The convention devolves into absolute chaos and no one can decide who to actually nominate. They either chose Biden or accept Bernie though as bringing in a 3rd option wouldnt be accepted by all involved."
WayOfTheBern,ffvpd5a,t1_ffunc2r,1580269607.0,"You dont realize though, they know Biden sucks. They wanted Harris and that failed. Now they want Warren and that’s failing. If they nominate Biden and lose, they will suffer severe losses and once again, Bernie would have won would become a rallying cry, but this time amongst even non progressives. Theyd lose a ton of seats, be primaried out like crazy, and be extremely weak for years to come. They don’t want that either. They may have a better chance at just accepting Sanders and opposing him at every junction for 4-8 years, blame him for the shortcomings, and say look guys centrism was good after all!"
WayOfTheBern,ffvp4g7,t1_ffu95ro,1580269434.0,"Id severely advise him not to do so. Unless it’s Bloomberg, then maybe even Bernie would agree it’s necessary and winnable."
WayOfTheBern,ffvp2zo,t1_fftldwk,1580269406.0,Bad plan really. He needs to find a way to threaten them without saying he wont endorse the nominee as that would tank our support amongst casual voters.

politics,ffvotlc,t1_ffvnzrj,1580269220.0,"Trump sounds like an idiot but he doesn’t stumble over his words much even if they make no sense. And most importantly, he’s energetic and has ~30% of the country that takes his ramblings as gospel. I’d much rather have Hillary run against him again than Biden, so Im not being biased as a progressive here.

WayOfTheBern,ffvo738,t3_evd0n6,1580268781.0,"First off, I have a love hate relationship with her and I think she’s proven to be less progressive than we assumed - but that aside, it she really wanted Bernie to win, she’d drop out.

People have done it for all of US history and were not “dividing the party” - it’s like you can’t have a different opinion these days without being a racist Russian Trunp supporter or something. Point is, we are the most diverse campaign, that’s a fact. Yet “bernie bro” is still applied as if we are all some toxic frat boys or something. It’s a clear smear campaign with a clear agenda."

politics,ffvdcfx,t3_evesf5,1580261453.0,"This, combined with Biden saying he won’t commit to supporting Bernie if he’s the nominee, is going to give Biden a bad look only days before the Iowa Caucuses. Not a good look Joe."
