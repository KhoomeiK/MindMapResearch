My plan was to walk to her school to meet her and walk to her home together. When I was probably two blocks from her house this white van with two heavy set Hispanic men sped by me then made a quick sudden turn and stopped abruptly at the curb, about 15 feet from me. They both got out and made a B-line toward me, so I took off and started running. They started running after me. I saw some teens on another street talking so I ran to them as quick as I could and grabbed them saying ""HEY! I was looking all over for you!"" Then told them about the guys. The two teens took each of my hands and we started powerwalking away. The two guys ended up running back to the van and sped off. If only cell phones were more common then, the guys probably would have been caught. Sorry for being long winded!"

Why did you run like a coward?"" The incident really warped my thought process on some things so honestly, I wish they would have just caught me and murdered me. Then maybe people would have cared about my well-being for once and I wouldn't grow up to be such a mess."
SuicideWatch,felfdgc,t3_epmh3y,1579220865.0,"I do all the time. Suicide is on my mind every day so it's a never ending battle. My mind is so askew that I think nothing but negative things would be said after I took my life. I think of what my dog and cat would think, and how confused they would be as to why their life-long buddy left them, and THAT is the only thing keeping me from ending everything. Honestly, everyone would probably be relieved when I'm gone due to my constant pain being a downer."
