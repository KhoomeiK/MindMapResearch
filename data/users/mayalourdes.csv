My survival tips are- donâ€™t have any in the house. Have yummy snacks to have when youâ€™re craving. Make plans with your friends who can help hold you accountable. After the break, itâ€™ll take less to feel the same effects. So naturally, you should be using less."

I guess itâ€™s not that big of a deal if you order water but if youâ€™re gonna do it,  recognize youâ€™re doing something obnoxious. Working in a drive through is a pain already- if youâ€™re going thru and just getting something for free that you could just drink out of a water fountain, at least go inside so youâ€™re not clogging up the line. Also- the man works a minimum wage job at Starbucks for Godâ€™s sake. Donâ€™t say anything to him. Take your water and go."

I donâ€™t recommend it for that reason, but I also know everyoneâ€™s different, maybe you could ask your doctor about that? Best of luck to you! â¤ï¸"
