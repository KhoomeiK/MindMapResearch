He was a terrorist to Americans, but was considered a hero in Iran. No shit a gigantic amount of people showed up at the funeral. People have been trampled for less and more idiotic reasons, for example black Friday. 

The people of Iran want revenge, but the government of Iran doesn't want a war. So they set up the attack on a military base. Having American casualties would be a declaration of war, so they inform Iraq (place where the base was) and the USA. The base is bombed, they use this to calm the people.

The plane crash isn't investigated yet, because it is a Boeing 737, an American model. Thanks to the tension between Iran and America, there are no investigator on site.

It seems unlikely that Iran would shoot down an Ukrainian plane with civilians."
