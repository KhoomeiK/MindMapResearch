ToolBand,fgedg3o,t3_exulzf,1580697021.0,"I'd imagine they would wanna bring it back at some point, but who knows really. Apparently it's really hard for Danny, but he did hold it down for four years. Probably just a Rocky montage away from getting there. But right now, they're mastering 7empest.  Wish I could've seen it last leg, but it's kinda exciting and keeps that mystery going to not know how 7empest is live yet, even after the album's settled."

Red Rocks has amazing sound, part of Salival was recorded there. Saw the Crimson show in 2001.

I'm sure they'll hit those venues up in the next few years once the FI hype dies down."

I seriously wish i could just stab myself right now."
SuicideWatch,fg4tqf8,t1_fg4teqb,1580510901.0,"Fixing them is actually very rewarding, but the money....it's just more that I'm sick of money.

ToolBand,fg4pi84,t1_fg47fko,1580508229.0,There's a habit of Lateralus being cut from many of the boots in that era. My best guess is that the tapers didn't have the foresight to bring a 2nd taoe and filled up the 1st one.
ToolBand,fg4pbt7,t3_ewt3xl,1580508115.0,I was there!
ToolBand,fg3nnn1,t1_fg3bo66,1580485729.0,"I definitely think Maynard's vocals on it are underrated. And I disagree about the solo not paying off, it pays off nicely at the 11 minute mark imo. It's some of Adam's best playing ever! The way he crosstalks with Danny on those legato riffs is just genius.  Though I understand the apparent lack of diversity with Danny and Justin during the solo. Justin's just holding it down, but I love the subtle things Danny does during it.  I get the solo makes the song drag a bit in comparison to most of their songs, but I don't count that against the song because I know it was an intentional decision, and one they obviously rarely make. Makes sense for them to try out that approach for at least one song, for the sake of mixing up song ideas. Adam generally diskikes soloing, so when he decided to finally do it I thought he did it in a very unique way.

The heavy intro riff is definitely off-putting compared to the rest of the album's subtle grace, but it's definitely not unexpected on a Tool album. And goddamn, I just love what Danny and Justin do to back it up!  That's what really makes it.  For a track that sounds like older Tool on a new Tool album, it exceded my expectations in freshness. It has plenty of experimental and progressive moments in it, especially on the bookends of it, but I think it just gets overshadowed by Justin's bass line during the solo."

ToolBand,fg2oalm,t1_fg2jrf5,1580449742.0,"I think all of their albums make some their fans feel like they plateaued at one point or another, but it's really all about the angle you look at it, and every album is a legitimate step forward in an evolution of sonic discovery between a true band of brothers."

ToolBand,fg2guhk,t1_fg2b36g,1580444745.0,"I feel ya! At the end of the day, one thing that made this band great was the fact they always did things on their terms.  It's possible they jumped the gun on 7empest, but who knows. The greatest hits set makes sense given the streaming exposure. I have some hope thinking the post album release tours will be off the chain with deep cuts, and 7empest may sit with the best of their whole catalog in a set list where it deserves to be (and I think all of FI lives up to their back catalogue). The gap in between 10k and FI seems to point to the fact that they like playing their deep cuts, and the guys have always known how to make their niche marketable."
ToolBand,fg2cdx5,t3_ewb8yc,1580442366.0,"I look at as the first album where Tool plateaued.  They definitely evolved a bit technically, but soulfully I only really felt it on Wings. The rest of the album just sounded like they had settled into their sound more than they had grown out of it into something new. And they did they for 3 LPs in a row, not an easy feat.  They describe as their ""blues album"", possibly for that reason.  It felt like their pop album to me. It slowly grew on me, and once I saw it live I was sold (and I saw the Houston show on 9/11 where Maynard was sick and didn't sing half the time!)

Fear Inoculum may be a slow burn, but damn does it have a fuck ton of soul."
ToolBand,fg2a987,t1_fg13ceg,1580441289.0,"As someone who was disappointed at the time, I think that's really what it boils down to.
