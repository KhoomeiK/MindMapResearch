nfl,ffix9qj,t1_ffi85n1,1579984961.0,The point is the fact that Archie made a genius move and got Eli on a team who he’d win two Super Bowls with rather than fade into oblivion with the chargers.
insaneparents,ffguj3r,t1_ffelfc0,1579915409.0,"Yet I get downvoted for pointing this obvious thing out. People complain about anti Vaxxers ignoring data, yet they turn around and do the same thing claiming a majority of kids will die, when that isn’t the case."
golf,fffxda5,t1_fffoqob,1579893872.0,Forgot there was an age limit to wearing clothes a certain way.
soccer,fffwr0t,t1_fffp61e,1579893488.0,"What quality of training do you realistically expect for $300? That’s like 2 weeks of somebody on minimum wage and no coach would work anywhere near that price.

You have a distorted idea of what things cost"

insaneparents,ffdwo2b,t1_ffdvmfb,1579830779.0,"And the actual fact is even when you aren't vaccinated the likelihood of getting meningitis is low, and the odds of dying before the age of 18 are well below 50%. You are undeniably at higher risk for disease and have a higher risk of dying, but claiming that somebody who is unvaccinated ""will probably die"" before they reach adulthood is factually false."
insaneparents,ffdwj3k,t1_ffdgo4c,1579830682.0,"Someone says this stupid shit every fucking time. People lived to 18 before vaccines, and people grew old before them. The kid is much more likely to contract a life-threatening disease and he's endangering himself and those around him, but the ""haha he'll be dead soon"" narrative is just so stupid and I see it on literally every single post related to vaccines."

IdiotsInCars,ffcpxnl,t1_ffc9rxi,1579804742.0,"I know you’re joking but the speed limits are supposed to be the fastest you can safely go under perfect driving conditions.

Often they are too slow but that is the idea behind speed limits. So technically if it’s night, rainy, or even a little fog you should be going under the speed limit, but most are too low to begin with for that to be reasonable."
nfl,ffcoc8y,t3_estzsw,1579803735.0,"It’s the Hall of FAME, not the hall of good stats. Anyone who says Eli doesn’t belong is kidding themselves. He beat some of the best teams of the past couple decades in the playoffs and won 2 Super Bowls."

WhitePeopleTwitter,ffav0nv,t1_ff8u6px,1579745132.0,"You can do that without knowing their name, and the types of guys that do that probably don't need a name to get started."
worldnews,ffaup60,t1_ffa1hcy,1579744915.0,Could you tell me what 'Previous actions' you are talking about though?

JUSTNOMIL,ffa7zm4,t1_ey2eyrj,1579729659.0,"Random question but are you in the US and if so are you in a small town?

Homophobia seems to be worse in small towns, particularly in the South but not exclusively."
