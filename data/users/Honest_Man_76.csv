The culture, geography, freedom, and opportunity are some of the reasons I do, despite how debatable it is that those are the best in America. 

The overall mixture of these is why I believe it is the best place to live in the world. We can argue about healthcare, politics, and education all day, but just because America isn’t #1 in these, it doesn’t mean it’s not one of the best places in the world"

But instead of trying to get to know me, she starts talking through her friends to me (like it’s middle school or something) instead of face to face, and advertising that she was virgin to me. Even when I was showing signs of not being interested, she would message me on the school app. (Not even text or email).

She then accuses me of spreading rumors that she wanted to take my virginity. First of all, I wasn’t. Second of all, that literally what she wanted to do!"

Christianity,fffhui3,t1_ffffbde,1579884289.0,"You can say this all day, but isn’t that kind of hypocritical? Why would we, as Christians, not judge other Christians for bad things they’ve done, but Trump is ALWAYS bad because of every bad thing he’s done?

Terms like “lucky guy” when two people who are attractive are together, but never “lucky girl”. And when I do hear about girls being happy with guys, it’s always about convenience or trivial things like money, rather than looks or character. Makes me feel self conscious as a guy, like men are less valued physically if that makes sense. I feel like the culture should encourage men and women being equally happy with each other both emotionally and physically, not one or the other."
