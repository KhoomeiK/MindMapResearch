GamingDetails,ffbjlh3,t3_esq75a,1579768370.0,"(some extra details regarding this) 

- each region in-game has three stations, so Sydney here in Australia has Triple M, as well as Nova 96.9 and 2Day FM. 

While the Former two are still active to this day, Nova has changed frequency since (it's 93.7 iirc) and Triple M sadly can't be heard where I live in Perth. As for 2Day FM, it seems to no longer be around. 

- each station has a selection of about 10 or so songs from either local artists within the OST or songs within the station's theme - so, Triple M will always play rock. 


- the broadcasters have pre-recorded lines that play before certain songs, detailing the song, artist, and station. (eg ""you're listening to The Epoxies - Synthesized, on Triple M"")


- far as I can tell, these were all recorded by actual hosts (at the time, around 2004) from each station in their native tongue - though they only have messages for a few of the songs in the default radio playlist, so forcing it to play a song outside of this via the custom radio option will disable it. Still, can be quite interesting to hear Australian English one level, then russian or German the next.


- and finally... The stereo appears to be an actual Alpine head unit, although I haven't been able to find the exact model, assuming there is one."

Fast forwards to today - been about 3 years since (19 so fairly young, turning 20 this year) and finally bought my first car. Out of curiousity, I wanted to learn about what specific engine it used compared to the top spec model, and then from there I found a bunch of memes and service manuals and other stuff that filled me in while also being fun to learn.

If, as a game developer, you ever need an example of how to show instead of tell, Super Metroid is *king*.

Barring the opening narration to fill newcomers in on franchise lore (which, as someone whose first Metroid was Super, this was very helpful for) and the text on item pickups explaining how to select a new powerup, (and not, mind you, what it's used for) there's no text at all. 

Nothing telling you ""you have to go here"", no textdumps saying ""this is how you perform a technique"", or ""this is what X item is used for"".

*all* of it is taught via level design or (in the case of hidden techniques) the animals scattered about. You're not *told* that Ridley is a villian intent on murdering Samus - you're shown it, via the introductory space station where he murders several scientists offscreen and goes straight for her throat within 5 minutes of starting a file.

casualnintendo,femkrel,t3_epydq7,1579260478.0,"Thing is that Nintendo has a sort of unwritten policy that they don't do ""level sequels"" - new entries that are little more than the previous one with a different lick of paint. If Nintendo makes something new, it has to truly be *new*.

Virtually the only exceptions to this that I can think of are Super Mario Bros. - The Lost Levels (which is understandable given they were fairly early in making home console games at the time and smb1 vastly passed their expectations), Splatoon 2 (probably for the same reasons, little development time between releases plus widely popular) and Mario Galaxy 2.

The downside, of course, being that Nintendo doesn't see the point in simply respraying old IPs - Starfox Zero only happened because the IP happened to suit the idea they were going with, and even then it didn't sell hot. 

And, of course, there's the fact F-Zero has consistently sold *less per entry* - meaning the first sold more than X, which sold more than GX... So financially they probably think it would be a loss. 

They've pretty much gotten stuck in this, ""well, if you like the old stuff, go play the old stuff"" - forgetting of course that little Timmy who plays Captain Falcon or Wolf in Super Smash Bros doesn't have that option. Nor do those unable or unwilling to pay exhorbitant amounts to get the required physical stuff online. 

Essentially, ""no, we aren't making new ones, go play the old ones. Oh, your only option is emulation because you're poor, but would jump at even a straight port on modern hardware? Nah, stuff you.""

The real icing on the cake is that, out of their relatively limited selection of Virtual Console or Classic ports - none of which have *ever* contained even a single system's full library - the *very first one* was their largest, way back in the 00's. One that now no longer exists, save for Emulation - which, despite in this case being a preservation effort, is still constantly burnt at the stake by Nintendo as if it were piracy. 

So, want to play Castlevania Rebirth, or the F-Zero X Expansion Kit? No. You will never do that under Nintendo's rules.
