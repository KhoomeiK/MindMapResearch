"" A lot of small dicked homosexuals like yourself are understandably bitter. ""

"" These homosexuals typically live very dangerous lifestyles often fueled by drugs and alcohol and are causing sexually transmitted disease to skyrocket all over North America and Europe. ""

To the above, I replied:

"" Ya, they do live very dangerous lifestyles. They have to deal with people who think like you turds on this sub every damn day. ""

"" Please return to your subreddit and allow people to enjoy free speech here.

onguardforthee,fc6mby3,t1_fc5z2e8,1577483962.0,"Gun nuts go in so many circles we should hire them as turbines powering hydro-electric dams. It's fascinating to watch.

My dad had a gun for when the wolves or coyotes started creeping around the farm. There were also some hunters around getting food and pelts. My brother is a veteran who has never had guns in his house, but used them many times in war. My last roommate was a federal officer who used a big box of bullets as a door stopper and went to the range often. Guess I'm just another completely ignorant bigot when it comes to guns because I think they should be highly restricted and difficult to get, with better regulations tracking them, and with developments in tech making it easier to ascertain who owned a fired gun immediately upon evidence of its use being found though. Yep. Just a stupid, ignorant libtard over here."
onguardforthee,fc4sp2c,t1_fc4qkzc,1577426958.0,"Yes, of course. I was reading recordings last week which were obtained by a great bounty hunter who infiltrated the CBC headquarters. They went like this:
CBC Boss: ""Ok, we want fair reporting on all topics. No political agenda. Report what happened, report scientists, dig up some good statistics that we can report to the Canadian people. Do the best reporting you can.""
CBC reporter: ""That sounds good, but can we distort facts about guns and gun owners? I mean, really put the screws to them? Just distort that, but keep everything else straight?""
CBC Boss: ""Oh, right. Thank you, CBC Reporter, for pointing that out. Be as factual as possible about everything except gun owners and gun death statistics. Inflate those like a balloon.""
Then there was lots of cackling, and, I think, and I know this is odd, I think I could hear them all get erections right at the moment they agreed to only distort facts on gun related stories.
