funny,ffi532j,t1_ffi14rj,1579965305.0,"I bought a shit ton of stuff from wish.com in the past, at one point I was looking into recording unboxing video since I was receiving 2-3 item a week. 90% if the time I was happy with what I received.

Here is a list of some item I have bought:

Green powerful laser (10/10)

4k gopro ripoff ( 4/10)

Various ''20 000 lumens'' flashlights ( usually 6-7/10)

Random sticker (7-10) good for sticker bomb

Magnetic putty (8/10) 

Men's wallet ( 8/10) they last 2-3 years top

90cm X 40cm RGB mousepad (10/10) 

Wire striper ( 8/10)

Nintendo Switch pro controller ripoff ( 5/10 ) 1 work flawlessly , the other half the buttons work. 

Smart watch ( 3/10)

Maverick drone ripoff ( 8/10 )

Power bank with solar panel on top ( 8/10) 

blutooth usb dongle ( 2/10)

And much much much more ! 

 

Then it got even more popular and they used to many shady technique to get you to buy the wrong stuff, ex: 1$ item are usually are like a lottery ( everyone spend 1$ , a single random person get an item and then they ''reimbursed'' everyone's dollar),  they have a ton of free item with only shipping to pay (5-15$ shipping usually), etc...

if you buy on this website make sure you select the right item and the description match what you are looking to buy ( size , color , accessories, etc).

As always be a cautious buyer."
