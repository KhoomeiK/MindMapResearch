Tarotpractices,ffa1d9n,t1_ffa0hqy,1579725917.0,I have the labryinthos app and it's associated apps - they're all from the same developer I believe. They've been really helpful!
Tarotpractices,ff9zvbn,t1_ff9zh20,1579725039.0,Hopefully! I have some apps I used for digital readings and learning the meanings but I don't by any means have them memorized. I've also seen some people creating reference indexes for the cards so I may try that as well.

Tarotpractices,fe9vt82,t1_fe9vi2k,1578941859.0,Yes! I haven't tried them out yet but even the example spreads she wrote about in the intro were easy to grasp and I was encouraged that I came to similar conclusions with them.
Tarotpractices,fe9vluf,t1_fe9ut4v,1578941811.0,"How interesting!! I was definitely drawn in by the artwork of each one. After reading the into to Siolo's field guide, I looked up her tarot deck and it sure is beautiful."
Tarotpractices,fe9bvlt,t3_eo70g6,1578936168.0,"If anyone has any advice on how best to get to know my cards and use them (specifically the oracle cards), I would greatly appreciate it!"
bulletjournal,fd3nb6c,t3_ejzptx,1578159936.0,Good thing one of my intentions for the year is to let go of perfectionism.... sigh..
bulletjournal,fcwg6th,t1_fcwg0hm,1578024791.0,Do you keep the journal digitally or do you end up transferring it to paper? I feel like I might really like this because I am usually soooo indecisive about what to put in mine.
bulletjournal,fcwfwze,t3_eipje3,1578024592.0,Is this done in OneNote?? How does this work?
bulletjournal,fcw9fvj,t3_egbdgx,1578020197.0,Can I ask what you made the next two pages? I'm behind and trying to figure out if I want to do a year at a glance AND a month at a glance or just skip the yearly

astrology,fcjil2d,t3_eha61f,1577688983.0,"Something must be creeping up. I'm new to most of the astrology/witchcraft things, but not new to empathic energies or intuition; I've been feeling like I'm bring watched/followed all week."
astrology,fcjif0v,t1_fchtb6y,1577688793.0,Would you mind explaining what this might mean for someone who's just getting to know astrology? (In terms of the archetypal energies)
crochet,fc7kdzn,t1_fc7jyc9,1577510249.0,Yes I love the ridge texture! I usually prefer a flat join (mattress) but I love the effect this added.

Tarotpractices,fc4rj3g,t3_eg3o93,1577425773.0,What deck is this? It's lovely.
crochet,fc4qsgy,t3_eg3do5,1577425044.0,What pattern did you use for the flower square at the bottom? It reminds me of a sunflower. The whole blanket is stunning!
blackcats,fbfmflw,t1_fbfl6lc,1576814257.0,How do you know who's who? Besides that it looks like their eyes are slightly different shades
