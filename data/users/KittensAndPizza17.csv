IncelTears,ff9na7m,t1_ff99yow,1579716566.0,"It’s not. I’ll make it easier for you to understand. There’s mgtow, AND THEN there’s incels. These things can occupy the same space but they are fundamentally different. One is involuntarily celibate, the other is 100% voluntarily single. They are polar opposites but the lines get blurred because the general population of reddit and other social media (where these little subsects mostly live) don’t understand it. And then on top of that, the group gets mixed with an influx of incels who don’t really understand the purpose either. But again, dudes choosing to stay single and be positive and not fall into these relationship pitfalls that are so prevalent when you’re in the dating scene for too long and meet “those types of women”, are the polar opposite of involuntarily celibate women haters.    

I hope that made it easier for you to understand.   

Unless you were confused about my comment regarding feminists. See, that’s a bit more difficult, because there aren’t 2 camps like there’s mgtow and incels. There’s only feminists, most are legitimate, but there is definitely a psychotic vocal minority fringe that exists within the group (like any group). The closest moniker we currently have to separate them from feminists who fight for equality and justice is “feminazi”, which no one likes. If you call someone an incel, that’s fine, we know what type of person that is (unless it gets over used like it has been on reddit recently where it’s strictly an insult, rather than descriptive term). But if you call someone a feminazi, even though that is, as well, a descriptive term, where we know the exact type we’re dealing with, if you call someone feminazi, general consensus will call you a woman hating incel. It’s a pretty gross double standard. The general outlook on social media is to treat women with children’s gloves, where you can’t really even call out these negative, man hating extremists. So we have mgtow, which people incorrectly blanket as bad, since there’s a fringe of incels, and there’s feminists, who get incorrectly blanketed as good, since there’s a fringe of feminazis within the group, though the group as a whole just gets labeled as feminist. 

Bottom line is that both incels, and (we’ll just call them) feminazis  exist, and give their respective parent groups (feminists and to a lesser extent, mgtow) a bad name. They DO exist, and they do seep in a sully the name and perception of both groups. It seems odd to me that both mgtow and feminists just deal with the extreme fringe, rather than call it out. It happens, I’ve seen plenty of mgtow posts where some obvious incel gets called out for being negative. I’ve not seen that so much with feminists calling out feminazis, but I’m sure plenty of level headed feminists have done so. But these groups need to really rally and call out the extremists on both sides before either will ever get any legitimate respect from dissenters.    

If you still thinks these opinions, once I’ve elaborated on them are stupid and naive, we can certainly agree to disagree. I’m fine with that. Although I would legitimately be interested to hear your take on why hat I’m saying is dumb and naive, because as far I’ve ever seen, it’s not even opinion but factual."

IncelTears,ff8n3zn,t1_ff8mk8x,1579686834.0,"Exactly. The fringe is awful on both sides, but they are just a vocal minority. Don’t double standard me though.

That’s basically what I did with reversed genders and movements. And I’m not mgtow or any of that, I’m a long term relationship type, always have been. This post trashes mgtow as a whole and mixes it up with incels, which are the literal opposites of what mgtow is. I just wanted to bring that to attention and remind everyone that there are man haters out there too, just like women haters. As I already said in my last post, both are pathetic.
