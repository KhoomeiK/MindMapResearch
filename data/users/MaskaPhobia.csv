relationship_advice,ffamz8r,t1_ffamu3e,1579739748.0,That’s very odd that he wouldn’t be worried about your well being after an incident like that. Def red flag. Don’t let him stop from doing what you want. If you want a break - take it. Don’t let him change your mind in any way.

Communicate to him that you along millions of other females desire to be listened to, sympathized with and made feel better. If we need advice we would ask for it. Learn to communicate what you desire out of relationship. Guys are not mind readers and it just sounds like he’s a man of few words kinda guy. Nothing wrong with it but if you love him it’ll take some work. Good luck!"

relationship_advice,fdzzpvo,t3_eni5i0,1578799636.0,Love is effort and commitment not a feeling... a feeling is chemistry. To keep chemistry - it takes work. The longer you are with a person - the more your relationship will evolve and change into something deep and  meaningful but only if you both put effort into it. So...I’d redefine what love means for you because it’s all feelings based then there’s a lot of disappointments ahead lol you will always hit a rough patch with any guy in the world. What defines you both as people is what you’re going to do about it.

Otherwise you may come off as needy or clingy, give him space if he seems like he needs some. Also, worst thing you could do to yourself is sit and think what some guy is up to and why. Do you girl! Live your life, do activities, go out with friends, improve and grow maybe take an online course idk but don’t waste your time thinking about a guy who’s not texting you. 

If he will - great! Go, have fun, catch feelings or don’t, whatever, just don’t sit there and ponder on this. 99.9% of the time they’re not even doing what we think they’re doing, so what’s the point :)"

Also, cool stuff like indoor skydiving etc, once again depending on what kind of person she is.

relationship_advice,fc6gma9,t3_eggk89,1577480107.0,"He sounds a bit insecure. Don’t get my wrong, A LOT of people would get insecure in this scenario. Seeing someone you really like (and maybe love idk this thread didn’t specify) having so much fun with another person, leaving you behind with their co workers where you clearly don’t really belong... I can kind of see where he is coming from. I’d be upset if my husband did that to me. I’d start thinking what else is going on at work. Maybe not physical cheating but emotional? Flirting and stuff. I’d definitely not feel like “the one and only”... which is what most people want in an exclusive relationship. 

He just doesn’t have good conflict resolution skills. Once again, the majority of people don’t. They/we weren’t raised by millennial parents that are aware of all those things. It’s something you guys will have to learn. With anyone really.

If this continues to bother you, I’d open up to him. When doing conflict resolution, if you truly want a resolution, need to be smart about wording. Let him know how much he means to you, that you want this to work, say how this situation making you feel. Less “you” statements. Speak and blame the situation, not the person. The moment the person gets defensive, the conflict resolution goes to hell. So speak with love and patience. 

You’ve been a good gf according to your post in ways that you support him. But don’t let your loving actions play against you in a way that you become bitter when he doesn’t react/reply in a way one could expect.

I think you guys could work this out and be happy if you learn how to work with his insecurities :) everyone has undesirable traits, finding another imperfect bf won’t solve anything unless you don’t love this guy anymore and ready to move on.

Another important note, don’t assume things and ponder on those thoughts. One of the most destructive things you could do in any type of relationship."
