chelseafc,ffsvak0,t1_ffrvodn,1580193870.0,Absolutely surgical purchases that window. That Fabregas announcement came totally out of nowhere too.
chelseafc,ffsuzhd,t1_ffsokx6,1580193515.0,"The logistics, distribution, manufacturing etc involved is insane. NB aren’t exactly small time players but they can’t match Nike."

chelseafc,ffprw3f,t1_ffpo03j,1580103494.0,I wonder if Conte would have made him work if he was played instead of Pedro/Willian. He had fantastic vision in advanced areas and I think he would have been capable of constantly finding that spare man in Conte’s team.
soccer,ffkcew6,t1_ffiww5f,1580020477.0,Missed a pen too didn’t he. What a day to forget for him.
chelseafc,ffk652b,t1_ffix6sx,1580017131.0,"I think both of them have very high individual ceilings. As a pairing though, I’m just not sold on the idea yet. It just feels like it lacks a bit of raw strength. I just get the feeling neither are suited to be the anchor the way VVD/Laporte is. They haven’t featured as a pair together yet though so I could eat my words in future. Hopefully I do of course."
chelseafc,ffiurd1,t1_ffitvtq,1579983233.0,"Rudiger seems to be the one that’s most comfortable with communicating. I think he’s also liked a bit more because he shows passion. I feel that he also brings a little bit more of the “dark arts” if you will. He knew how to milk that incident vs Son a bit more for it to be reviewed. 

I have to agree I think he’s not particularly special but I think he’s good enough. I’m not sure if he’s suitable to be the anchor of our CB pairings in the long run though. I’m not talking about this season but a longer timeline like a few years."
chelseafc,ffisbjc,t1_ffirik7,1579981475.0,100% agree on the Alonso part. He seems to compensate for that weakness nicely. Not perfect of course but I think we should we going that route for the rest of the season.
chelseafc,ffij98x,t1_ffii42z,1579975188.0,Agreed. Frankly we’re leaking goals without him anyways and playing absolutely dreadful on offence. Over the long run I’ll expect we pick up more points playing with him over Emerson/Azpi especially against weaker sides.
chelseafc,ffij1vg,t1_ffihx5o,1579975050.0,"Agreed. It’s not a coincidence at all our performances have been generally shite since he wasn’t played, 3ATB or not."
MarvelSuperWar,fffkxip,t1_fffjce1,1579886193.0,"There’ll be feeders on the opposite side too. If you’re good enough you’ll power through the lower ranks anyways since you don’t lose stars. 

Yes they are, but the game is relatively new so the strategies haven’t really been fleshed out yet. It feels like everyone is still figuring things out. I personally find it fun to see everybody trying things out for themselves rather than follow a 3 step guide to victory."
MarvelSuperWar,fffj5t8,t3_et9a8f,1579885092.0,I sorta like it when players just play heroes for the fun of it or because they look cool without caring for the roles. It’s kinda like the phase where people just want to have fun before caring too much about strategies and metas.
soccer,fffinsr,t1_fffbbmt,1579884787.0,"Gotta agree. Even if the linesman’s flag is down during those breakaway situations and the ball goes in, you just sort of can’t go berserk, it’s more like a hopeful yay if anything."
chelseafc,ffe3uuc,t1_ffcn7am,1579835999.0,"I play keeper in a different sport and I still feel I can relate haha. Especially that recent goal against Newcastle. Shots that bounce from such a close range off the ground are a nightmare. 

That being said, I do think he has room to improve. I don’t think he communicates as often as he should."
chelseafc,ffc3erl,t1_ffbp6c0,1579790564.0,Agreed. The ones with big names and profiles are already settled too.

chelseafc,ffbxd5e,t1_ff9jq8q,1579785832.0,"Don’t think that’ll happen unless we’re desperate IMO. 

Agreed. He’s a bit burnt out IMO but I can’t fault his attitude at least. He’s definitely not looking to back down. I hope he doesn’t run himself into the ground though."
chelseafc,ffbwdcs,t1_ff98g7c,1579784955.0,He must have stolen like 25 points for us that season. That goal against boro for example. 6 players around him and somehow he’s the first to react and get the jammy goal to bring home the points.
chelseafc,ffbw8hu,t1_ffav8sp,1579784833.0,I don’t think he was scoring hat tricks or braces every other game. But bloody hell it feels like every goal of his was important and brought us points.
chelseafc,ffbw5n2,t1_ff997sy,1579784764.0,"I don’t think selling him was wrong. I do think it could have been handled better though. In hindsight, if he had been back at Cobham first, we would have had a better bargaining position. 

Atleti were also banned from registering new players till Jan anyways. If we had somehow gotten a compromise to promise him a move and only play him as a backup, it would have been a win win IMO. 

These things are easier said then done of course."
chelseafc,ffbvun8,t1_ffbpccc,1579784476.0,"He links up well with our midfielders and forwards. He’s decent on set pieces. He’s also a great outball for Kepa since Tammy and Bats aren’t the best at challenging for aerial balls. 

I don’t think it’s a coincidence at all that we’ve looked horrible since he stopped being in the team. We’re leaking goals without him anyways so I don’t think the argument that we’re better off defensively without him holds up."
chelseafc,ffbvbik,t1_ffbnhs8,1579783982.0,I concur. Whether as a LWB or LB he should be playing.
chelseafc,ffbu3if,t1_ffbmfkb,1579782781.0,"Completely agree with the first point. He can actually see the pass but his execution is definitely a tier below Fabregas. There was a whole video here before on how none of our players could convert his passes. The issue is, they were frequently a bit overhit and floaty. It was definitely harder to control those passes. Cesc was one of the best ever and could get everything right, from the trajectory, weight, timing, spin. Jorginho doesn’t get the spin and weight right as often as he should be IMO."

soccer,ffb7hyj,t1_ffadura,1579753955.0,Love how I removed the and every one followed
soccer,ffb5608,t1_ffah1lj,1579752077.0,"Yea the coaching is clearly crucial to how they perform. Conte was a magician and could get players like Moses or Candreva performing at high levels. The madman made David fking Luiz play like the world class CB he was supposed to be for a full season. 

Fergie used to do this too. He could make the team perform better than the sum of their parts."
chelseafc,ffb3w9r,t1_ffa4452,1579751129.0,He was a shark that smelled blood in the opposition box lmao.
chelseafc,ffb3clu,t1_ff5g4c0,1579750735.0,"I’m fucking amazed that we managed to extend our lead somehow. It’s hilarious. 

Although I still wouldn’t count them out now."
soccer,ffb2yzp,t1_ff9c503,1579750470.0,"Definitely. There’s a positive to keeping good relations with your players. Chelsea could have tried to force Cech to stay and honour his contract, but I think letting him leave for play time made him much happier. Now he’s probably being groomed into a bigger role in the club. 


Same for Lamps and probably Terry in future. 
Maybe even Luiz could end up being our future ambassador of sorts although he’s at Arsenal now. Ballack talked up Chelsea to Schurrle. The list goes on. 


Point is, I don’t think you should force players to stay against their will. Because when they leave, they could still be part of your team so to speak. Be it in direct employment or the media. I’m sure all that goodwill can provide benefits that dollars and cents may not."
soccer,ffaion3,t1_ffa9095,1579736668.0,Long may it reign
chelseafc,ff9gaab,t1_ff8kz4w,1579712385.0,"Sarri’s setup was a bit more compact and organised and definitely helped our defensive side. 

And hot take here, I do think Luiz and Alonso were better defensively or at least equal. Luiz and Zouma have brain farts in equal measure. Luiz just does it in a super obvious way whereas Zouma doesn’t. 

Luiz would charge out recklessly but Zouma sometimes just loses his bearings. I’m happy that he seems to have improved, especially his technique. 

Alonso’s only slow but he doesn’t actually switch off very often. It’s painful to see him against a fast and tricky winger, but the thing is, that situation barely gets to show itself. Alonso will win almost every 50-50 header or just foul the guy. 

James is pretty sound IMO but sometimes it seems like he doesn’t register the danger completely in his head and can be prone to switching off."
chelseafc,ff9e5ua,t1_ff982pw,1579711063.0,"Yeah it would be nice to have another Anelka who can be lethal upfront or play on the wing. 

I think Mount was on par to be our Muller, but he’s dropped off significantly recently. I think he’s fatigued tbh. His movement is still good but his technique seems way more rushed. I think if he irons out his technique properly he will develop nicely."
chelseafc,ff9dr2p,t1_ff8mrp0,1579710796.0,"A crucial save against Messi on the breakaway to preserve our lead. 

And another penalty shootout masterclass from our keeper in the final. Maybe against Juve. 

A man can dream."
chelseafc,ff7nq7s,t1_ff7atp0,1579653943.0,"I agree and have been saying it too. Don’t forget that Arsenal game he had to be subbed off before we got back into the game. 

He flatters to deceive just because he’s fast and can dribble. It’s not even just statistics, anyone can see how horrible our Football has been lately whenever he’s on and not Alonso, regardless of 3ATB or not."
soccer,ff7mc3g,t1_ff7je12,1579652977.0,"Idk why they think he will get much better. He’s what, 25? Pretty much what you see is what you get"
soccer,ff6o5ue,t1_ff69m69,1579631364.0,"Agreed. I think post VAR, it’s less likely to have an impact on the decision itself. I think they mostly try their absolute best to be objective. 

But imagine running around for an hour keeping up with the play when an incident happens. It’s a potential penalty. However, your view is obstructed and so was the ARs. The victim’s team is absolutely adamant it’s a pen, which happens all the time. But the opposing team looked very apprehensive and had that look of “oh fuck I think that’s a clear pen”. Does anyone seriously believe people wouldn’t fill in the gaps here themselves? 

Even if you don’t give that decision, what about the next one? Would you really give, say, a second yellow card to the same player who had a pen denied if he made a 50-50 challenge that was ambiguous enough to straddle the line between professional foul and a normal foul.

I think post-VAR, those situations are probably reduced. Instead, reactions probably influence what they review in closer detail. Take Son’s red card against Rudiger for example. Who honestly believes that if Rudiger just didn’t react at all, that the incident would have been viewed the same way? 

It’s just simply human to have reactions and emotions play on your mind and decision making. The actual extent may not be much.  But it still affects it nonetheless."
soccer,ff65d37,t1_ff5p4tr,1579619522.0,"It’s obvious that reactions will sway decisions. They’re only human after all. I don’t understand why people want to argue this. You probably won’t sway a blatant call but you could reasonably influence a 50/50. 

Even if you don’t get this one, I bet it plays on the mind of the ref for future calls. 

It doesn’t mean it’s ethical of course."
MarvelSuperWar,ff5y85c,t1_ff5frbd,1579614119.0,The thematic sense part is so true. Even minor things like Deadpool displaying 0 deaths just adds a little bit of character and flavour.
todayilearned,ff5azp8,t1_ff52p1x,1579585715.0,We really need more people to understand it.
chelseafc,ff4zoaz,t1_ff4oy0w,1579576345.0,Indeed. There’s still such a long way to go and our lead is far from comfortable. Going by recent trends I’m quite pessimistic tbh. We’re dropping far too many attainable points for my liking.
soccer,ff3mh8q,t1_ff3bjld,1579544200.0,Tbh I think some of that unhappiness and injustice made us more engaged.

MarvelSuperWar,ff3hyur,t1_ff2f5mi,1579541432.0,"Can’t really seem to get the hang of him though. I guess I’m just the type to prefer fewer skills and think of grand strategy instead. 

I like how he seems so in character though. Such an obnoxious git. His shooting stance is hilarious too. That 0 death thing is also a really nice flavour touch."
MarvelSuperWar,ff3ha51,t1_ff2scqw,1579541007.0,Tbh I think you’ll be drowning in crystals in a few months once you run out of heroes to buy with anyways and then you can just slowly grind for Thanos. Best of luck and hopefully he is inevitable for you!
chelseafc,ff3gwj7,t1_ff2ucl1,1579540783.0,"Yes I totally agree with your point. I’m saying the situation forced our hand a bit. Considering the length of the contract and the swiftness of the deal, he was probably being monitored for a while now. I’m guessing we wanted to monitor him for another season at least but the timeline was accelerated. 

Perhaps desperation was a strong word but I don’t think we were in much of a position to bargain hunt anyways considering Courtois publicly went AWOL. Every club would have been trying to fleece us at that point so my guess is we just went with a secured deal rather than flaff about."
soccer,ff2xm2w,t1_ff2qh45,1579527862.0,I think that subconsciously influenced me to be a Chelsea fan tbh. It just felt like you were involved too.
chelseafc,ff2tqga,t1_ff2qx0w,1579523788.0,Man I’m pissed just thinking about it lol.
chelseafc,ff2tnrk,t1_ff2s9h0,1579523699.0,"He’s pretty average IMO and his price was really inflated because of our desperation. 

I’d say it’s worth looking into a strong challenger for the first team. He doesn’t have to be a Super high profile guy. I’d love it if we could snag another Cech or Courtois in their early years but that’s a tall order."
MarvelSuperWar,ff2s0kw,t1_ff2onbo,1579521591.0,"Magneto’s probably too different in playstyle for your liking I guess. 

Good point on starlord. I think he’s also going to get hit with the nerf stick fairly soon because he’s a bit on the OP side. 

Human Torch seems to be the safe bet in terms of controlling a game. Deadpool seems really skill dependent so maybe if it suits you I guess. I like how obnoxious he is though lol. 

I haven’t tried Mr Fantastic but he seems fairly mobile too with his jumpy skills."
MarvelSuperWar,ff2r7ip,t1_ff2anda,1579520456.0,I think it’s not too bad if you used the crystals and bought the discounted coin heroes. I agree it’s tough if you’ve spent them already though.
MarvelSuperWar,ff27ic8,t1_ff1lkqn,1579496037.0,Is the min number of heroes 14?
MarvelSuperWar,fez98u5,t3_eqxl2r,1579455028.0,"Magneto can be fairly aggressive and you need massive gonads to go into the thick of the fight as a squishy. He’s not really hit and run though so probably not your thing. 

Perhaps Spidey/Starlord are your guys. Really mobile and you get to stamp your influence on the game."
chelseafc,fez87y9,t1_feyzxyp,1579454716.0,"Agree with this. Our opportunities have been pretty half arsed and the pre-final ball often just fizzles out. We’re also developing that annoying habit of just not pulling the trigger when we’re in the box. 

We also lack brute force to get the jammy goals which means the emphasis on creativity and technique is enhanced."
chelseafc,fez4s1r,t1_feyqxlu,1579453853.0,"I wasn’t really convinced by him either tbh. I feel like the lack of aerial presence wouldn’t really be a big issue if he was capable of pulling off amazing saves every game to save those (kinda like Iker). 

I get what you mean though. We should be looking for an upgrade. But I think we definitely shouldn’t be knee jerk about it and just buy any hyped keeper. I just don’t feel like there’s that outstanding keeper that’s available right now. 

I think we’re realistically just kinda stuck with him for at least 1 more season. FWIW I don’t think he’s complete trash but not really anything outstanding besides his PK shootout performances."
MarvelSuperWar,feymfok,t3_eqw77i,1579447567.0,Have you tried them both?
chelseafc,feyj55i,t1_feyhe6i,1579446146.0,"I can see the benefits of Mount. I feel like he’s a bit fatigued or it’s a side effect of playing against deeper defences though. There’s been increasingly sloppy mistakes from him recently. I do like him but I think he needs some time off. 

Giroud definitely got shafted. I get that Frank probably wants some pace on his forwards but I think Giroud’s much more capable overall than Bats in general. 

Alonso’s my main gripe though. I don’t think he’s Marcelo but he definitely belongs in the team as long as he doesn’t get overplayed into fatigue. Seriously I don’t think it’s a coincidence at all that we’ve been playing shit ever since he’s hardly played."
chelseafc,feyb7sf,t3_eqrl2h,1579443171.0,"I’d rather play Alonso/Reece as our fullbacks if they’re fit. For all the talk about Alonso being trash at defending, we’re pretty much conceding goals anyways and scoring fuck all with dreadful play."
chelseafc,feyam0j,t1_fexcdys,1579443044.0,"I actually agree on Reece/Alonso. Especially against teams that sit back. We need every bit of quality on offence as possible. 

Doubt Ruben will be back any time soon though. And I wouldn’t want to rush him either."
chelseafc,fey9bz6,t1_fexlaw9,1579442442.0,"I think our team under Conte had decent height tbh. Alonso/Luiz/Cahill/Matic/Diego and Baka/Morata the next season. So not the tallest average but a decent chunk of presence in the box and TBO to relieve pressure.  Perhaps adding Alonso+RLC would alleviate some of this. 

Frankly I’m not sure about Onana too since I just didn’t watch much of him. I’d hope if we get another keeper it wouldn’t be a rushed one and that we could scout or develop another TBO, although that’s really way easier said than done."
chelseafc,fey7tlh,t1_fextqth,1579441914.0,"I think he’s pretty average tbh but I don’t think that shot was really saveable. Anyone who’s played keeper before will know how much of a pain those bouncing shots are to save from that range. 

Whether he could catch the cross in the first place is another story. I think it wasn’t really on the cards given his skill set. TBO could probably catch it but he’s one of the best at it."
MarvelSuperWar,fexwbba,t1_fexuekz,1579437552.0,"No idea lol. I wonder if it’s mechanically possible for her to make her be viewed as a friendly (only visually) hero to the enemy. Obviously masquerading as them of course. Until she gets damaged or within x range / whatever constraint they can think of. Would be fun I guess to cause internal havoc in the opposite team. Up close she’s practically black widow I guess. 

I can imagine the enemy team constantly using skills on their teammates just to check and confirm that it’s a teammate. Would be hilarious I suppose. Don’t think that’s a feasible idea though."
MarvelSuperWar,fextn9i,t3_equbn9,1579435866.0,"Loki. It’s insanely fun to play mindgames with the enemy. Fun stuff like pretending to be the MM and having 3+ people jump on you quickly to realise that’s it’s just an illusion and your team can counter initiate. 
All in all, I feel like his skill set and play style is very much in-character which makes it very enjoyable."
singapore,fexln3y,t1_fexa62x,1579433020.0,How can they hope to expand using the techniques of yeasteryear?
singapore,fewjymw,t1_feqte5h,1579412228.0,"Thank you for fighting the good fight, soldier. Your contributions will never be forgotten."
chelseafc,fewhp6o,t1_fetr96g,1579410772.0,"Yes I can understand that. He gets absolutely everything right more often than not. The spin, trajectory, weight. Jorginho can see the pass but his execution is just lacking on those for the final ball attempts. IMO his over the top through ball is just too floaty which makes it awkward for the receiver and gives more time for the defence."
chelseafc,fetp06a,t1_fetn7xf,1579377829.0,"Jorginho can maintain tempo and has good short passing, but I don’t think he splits the defense as well as Cesc did."
chelseafc,fetodju,t1_fetjgfa,1579377581.0,There was like a potential 12 points or so we could have reasonably taken which would have made top 4 very comfy and attainable. At the moment our lead is really shaky.
MarvelSuperWar,fes54f4,t1_fes3x20,1579361469.0,"I generally agree with that. If you as an MM are occupying 2 heroes, it’s way more contribution than your measly damage at that point. It means there’s a 4v3 on the map and your other teammates should recognise that numerical advantage. 

If you weren’t an MM but rather, a support or tank, then this scenario gets trickier lol. But yeah I think you made the right call. Your damage and contribution is shit early so you should be trying to get your damage online ASAP."
MarvelSuperWar,fes14xr,t1_ferybzz,1579360355.0,"Then I’d say no. 

Because if you’d gone and no teamfight occurs because there’s a mexican standoff, bot tower is likely gone. 

If you’d gone and there’s an even trade, bot tower is gone and likely no further gains are made. 

If you’d gone and worse case scenario got wiped, there’s a chance they could take up to 3 tier 1s. 

The only winning scenario is if you popped up and was necessary to wiping them. Even then you probably only can take 2 tier 1s down and will lose 1 in the process. 

I mean there’s no real way to tell whats the best game plan. But I’d assess this sort of scenario as a higher % chance of losing the initiative if you joined the teamfight. I value map control highly in this game and losing towers unnecessarily just makes it harder for your team later on."
MarvelSuperWar,fery3cr,t3_eqfuik,1579359507.0,It’s extremely context based. But I’d say you holding 2 down at not is better for the team than appearing. Besides I’m assuming this is relatively early and you still need farm for your power spike.
chelseafc,fepfi8k,t1_feni91q,1579319208.0,"He has great technique to blast it in near post and into the roof of the net from tighter angles. He also seems much more willing to take shots from further out. I think if Tammy can add those traits into his game, it’ll help mix it up a bit."
chelseafc,fenc17i,t1_femksam,1579281458.0,"Yeah the price was massive but our hand was forced after the stunt and considering the circumstances of the selling club tbh. They have no reason to accept less considering that they can’t just buy any player due to their policy. 

Imo he’s just not that outstanding atm, and his best assets (reflexes, passing) don’t really seem to be anything special compared to his peers. Only thing I have to commend is his penalty saving though. He seems to be really good at guessing which way to go."
chelseafc,fenb9ld,t1_femkv68,1579280987.0,He’s built like a fridge basically. That’s about it. Seems to have caught on more after he clattered into a huge player recently and totally came out unscathed.
chelseafc,femx7vx,t1_femu7w2,1579271965.0,Yeah his shooting technique was still excellent. I’d be happy if Tammy could add those types of goals into his repertoire.

soccer,feh811a,t1_fegk5l8,1579111060.0,"Hold up, what does the mod change? Just career mode or gameplay? And is it only compatible with certain platforms/ fifas? 

Anyways I agree. The lack of effort is the real turnoff for me. So many lazy mistakes even in their money printing machine of FUT."
todayilearned,feh7gj6,t1_fegp4hc,1579110730.0,"I have no idea why it’s so hard to accept tbh. I’ve always had a religious influence but I just view it the creation story as a metaphor. “Days” could just have been in the cosmic unthinkable scale of billions of years, or just an easy storytelling device to make things simplified and just to get to the meat of the story while quickly establishing that said deity is pretty strong. 

Maybe changing their way of thinking shouldn’t just be a classroom style laying of facts. I think you have to let them keep their dignity and belief and silently slide that logic in."
soccer,feh2ilh,t1_fegw9jg,1579107787.0,"I feel like the average standard of players now is better than ever, but I also feel like they’re a bit more “streamlined and coached” if that makes sense. 

IMO I don’t think Dinho would have been as good as he was if he wasn’t happy and enjoying life. Obviously there’s a better middle ground to all of this, but that’s what I think made him productive and creative."
chelseafc,fegyg4c,t1_fegp97o,1579105318.0,Lewa mixes power and technique nicely IMO.
chelseafc,fegvl36,t1_fegthxw,1579103514.0,Agreed. We shouldn’t be rushing for just whoever is available but looking to buy the suitable player for our ambitions. We don’t want anymore deadwood in our squad.
chelseafc,feguq93,t1_feg0nxz,1579102967.0,Alonso’s fine as LB for top 4 ambitions IMO. I don’t think it’s a coincidence at all that our left side hasn’t looked threatening without him.
chelseafc,feghv45,t1_fefy06y,1579093250.0,Why not both??
chelseafc,fee4ytg,t1_fedot3n,1579026495.0,Agree heavily with the relations part. Bet they’ll be scrambling a little bit. In the grand scheme of things I’d probably just rather he stays there for guaranteed game time and good relations. There’s always the possibility of loaning some other players to them in future when openings arise. Not to make them sound like a feeder development club but I think such arrangements could be mutually beneficial.
chelseafc,fee1kh3,t1_fedlkv4,1579024479.0,He’s got good form and timing as well IMO.
chelseafc,fed9izg,t1_fed6f8m,1579004713.0,"Agreed, the emotions involved are what make it so engaging. Without it, it’s just watching a routine of people kicking a ball around. 

Doesn’t mean that we should be abusing players in their private life of course. That’s off limits for me. But you’ve got to be seriously kidding if you want to be policing the emotions we should feel when we watch a game."
chelseafc,fed920x,t1_fed6mcp,1579004217.0,"Agree that unfair criticism can be over the top. But that doesn’t mean it’s childish. They could be missing a bit of perspective. I think this is where a forum shines and where we can take little bits and pieces of insight from each other. 

Also, I disagree that all knee jerk reactions are childish. It’s just being human to feel emotions, not childish. I’m sure most of us have overreacted at points, not just in sports. Doesn’t mean you should be abusive of players of course."
