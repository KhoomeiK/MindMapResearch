depression,fel5a43,t3_epiyby,1579214358.0,"I try to imagine a better, happier life for myself. I just wish my dreams could become realities."
selfimprovement,fel55n6,t1_fekjdfq,1579214283.0,Yeah I deserve it. I can't do anything right.
selfimprovement,fel52kf,t1_feknymc,1579214230.0,"1) Yes
2) No
3) No

I'm pretty useless and I deserve to just stop burdening people and die."
selfimprovement,fek4ro6,t1_fek32q3,1579192592.0,"No, it's not worth it. I don't see a future for myself anyway. Even on the 0.0001% chance I somehow improve something, it'll come crashing down eventually anyway."
selfimprovement,fek1n41,t1_fek1eyy,1579190685.0,Everything besides me.
selfimprovement,fek1ert,t3_epiuuk,1579190540.0,Oh my god I've been playing Halo a lot lately & I hate it every single time I lose. I feel so stupid & worthless.
selfimprovement,fek1amd,t3_epkejs,1579190471.0,Alcohol.
selfimprovement,fek1970,t3_epimm7,1579190447.0,I have no control over anything in my life.
selfimprovement,fek17xa,t3_epkhwz,1579190425.0,I can't forgive myself for anything. I deserve all the shit I spew at myself.
selfimprovement,fek031o,t1_fejzn43,1579189725.0,Even one thing is too difficult for me. Besides it doesn't matter. My life sucks and will suck even harder as I get older.
selfimprovement,fejwj3s,t3_ep6tod,1579187473.0,That's why I don't try. Cause there's too much shit to fix and I don't have the motivation or discipline to get it fixed.
depression,fefpbzz,t3_eoub2g,1579061450.0,Luck. That how.
mentalhealth,fedz9q5,t3_eoe3jx,1579023029.0,It's a good thing I gave up on getting help. I can't afford it anyway.
mentalhealth,feciam5,t1_febnw2x,1578974588.0,I knowww. My bed is so comfy. I work rotating shifts so it fucks with my sleep schedule. Early morning shifts are the worst because I feel the most like a zombie going to work for those. Using my closing shifts I feel sorta better or at least my energy levels aren't as bad.
Foofighters,fechyx3,t3_eocf65,1578974363.0,Damn. These all look great!
mentalhealth,febkha8,t3_eoblnt,1578959734.0,"I don't really have an answer, but I wanted to let you know that I do relate to this post a lot. I can barely get the energy to walk to work in the morning. There's no way in hell I'll be able to go the the gym and lift weights or jog through the park. I'm so tired and I just want to lay in bed and die."
AskReddit,fe8o6c5,t3_eo3q9l,1578928430.0,I'm on a train in NYC right now. Business as usual here.
selfimprovement,fds6dkm,t3_emsm7k,1578695373.0,"I'm not important or worth caring about, I assure you."
AskMen,fdnn9nw,t3_embc1t,1578589331.0,"I've never lived alone (and probably never will be able to afford to), but these comments are pretty funny because I can see myself doing them."
AskReddit,fdkt5xa,t3_elssvy,1578510624.0,That I would have a successful future.
selfimprovement,fcw1q1c,t1_fcvnfsc,1578015121.0,I'll never make any improvements.
selfimprovement,fcw1mkx,t1_fcvt1nq,1578015057.0,"I've never seen a psychiatrist and I never will. I don't know if any one specific event, but just the realization that life sucks and no matter how hard I try, I will always fail."
selfimprovement,fcw1jhy,t1_fcvx2yj,1578015002.0,"I could give it a read, but there's no chance in hell I'm winning at anything."
selfimprovement,fcw1i21,t1_fcvz5ca,1578014976.0,No I definitely can't. That's for sure.
mentalhealth,fcum9wm,t1_fcul9ny,1577984059.0,My mindset doesn't matter. I can't control what the world wants to throw at me.
dragonage,fcqr6cx,t3_ei7x9y,1577890918.0,"I killed him on my first playthrough as well. I do believe he was a good guy at heart, but Justice had slowly taken him over as time went on until he finally completely lost it. I couldn't forgive what he did"
AskMen,fcqpu38,t3_eigll5,1577890246.0,This thread worries me because I've been thinking about packing up and starting over in a new city lately and I have extremely low expectations of making friends as it is...
mentalhealth,fcp6m6i,t1_fcp2pg6,1577852190.0,No I haven't. I don't know what those are.
mentalhealth,fcp1iyy,t1_fcoy88y,1577847617.0,There's nothing about myself that I like.
mentalhealth,fcog4km,t1_fcofsj4,1577831411.0,"I'm sorry if I meant any offence. I don't know what's going on with you, but I wish you the best in all if your endeavors and I hope you can overcome your illness. I just personally can't see myself ever living a happy, stable life. I don't see any point of getting help anymore when nothing in my life ever works out anyway."
mentalhealth,fcoee1w,t3_ei5tc3,1577830207.0,I'm not interested in getting treatment. I won't ever get better.
mentalhealth,fcmvg3s,t1_fcmet1k,1577794130.0,Yeah they don't realize the amount of time and work that goes into being comfortable with yourself. I even gave up myself because it was just too much work that I'm not capable of handling.
mentalhealth,fclsb91,t1_fcjlxq4,1577755253.0,I can't be nice to myself. I don't deserve it.
mentalhealth,fcklh5y,t1_fck31a6,1577727916.0,Any love from other people feels fake.
mentalhealth,fck16ur,t1_fcjzxuv,1577713409.0,Yeah it does.
mentalhealth,fcjyg5p,t1_fcjxu1e,1577710498.0,I deserve every shitty thing I say to myself.
mentalhealth,fcjulw9,t1_fcjjyg1,1577705522.0,"I'm not diagnosed either, but I'm pretty sure I have depression."
mentalhealth,fcjukzd,t1_fcjoekl,1577705486.0,"I'm sorry, but I'm not doing that. It sounds sort of ridiculous especially because all of my negative thoughts about myself are true. I'm also against going to therapy. I don't see how that overpriced chatroom will help me."
mentalhealth,fcjuga4,t1_fcjqky3,1577705297.0,"Anytime I feel comfortable with myself, it's always short-lived. I never believe people when they say they love me. I just can't see someone genuinely loving me."
mentalhealth,fcjue88,t1_fcju8te,1577705215.0,It's a mindset I can't achieve.
mentalhealth,fcju7u7,t1_fcjkqqt,1577704960.0,"Yeah cause they don't actually want to help you, but won't admit it."
mentalhealth,fcju75d,t1_fcjd0p1,1577704930.0,I've tried being kind to myself. It never felt genuine and I just don't think it's possible.
mentalhealth,fcjt6o6,t1_fcjjcwj,1577703456.0,"I'm not interested in going to CBT, but yeah, people who yammer on about internal self-worth probably never had issues with it to begin with."
AskReddit,fcj5qcq,t3_ehay2h,1577677928.0,Sure. I'm still a virgin and I'll never get laid anyway so I'll do it.
mentalhealth,fcj41bv,t1_fcj3u32,1577676733.0,"Nah man, you made perfect sense. People don't understand you can be depressed no matter what and getting help for it isn't a 1-2-3 process."
mentalhealth,fcj31qh,t1_fcj2c9y,1577676028.0,Yeah exactly. Telling me to love myself isn't going to make my brain suddenly snap and make me start loving myself.
mentalhealth,fciogd7,t3_ehb7tw,1577666104.0,"I know how you feel. Years ago I had low expectations of getting a girlfriend. Now, I just don't even try anymore. I can't see a girl liking me and especially given my terrible mental health, I'm sure there's even less of a chance of it ever happening."
AskReddit,fcij3bh,t1_fcgvmda,1577663389.0,Jokes on them. I don't smoke anymore and I'm still not good at anything.
AskReddit,fcij1bl,t3_eh8gs2,1577663362.0,"I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, but when I first started smoking it used to calm my anxiety and depression down. After a while smoking started making those feelings worse and I had to stop because I couldn't take being on the verge of panic attacks like that."
dragonage,fcic3ot,t1_fci0ymb,1577660359.0,Honestly maybe I should just give up now. I think I'm just too stupid to understand how to properly play this game.
dragonage,fcibxrv,t1_fci2lr7,1577660294.0,"I've done that strategy. It worked well at first, but lately it's just flat out not working at all."
dragonage,fcibtkb,t1_fci3ohi,1577660249.0,Yeah nightmare definitely sucked a lot of fun out of origins for me. Which is a shame because this is an amazing game and one if the few games where I want to replay it several times. I use wiki and forums a lot to understand the builds and everything. Personally I don't have the time to practice and learn it all by myself.
dragonage,fcibjb6,t1_fci8s0y,1577660143.0,Oh god the Flemeth boss fight. I'm debating if I should just lie to Morrigan that she's slain just to avoid that headache. Even on normal that fight was tough.
ForeverAlone,fc4i7pt,t3_eg04e1,1577417399.0,"I told one of my friends today I was going to die alone. He probably think I'm overexaggerating, but this is why I believe that."
AskReddit,fc2pg1e,t1_fc2fpiv,1577370069.0,Shit that sounds just like me. I quit so many things such as recently when I quit trying to get my driver's license.
depression,fc2p72l,t3_efqogm,1577369835.0,"As much as I hate working a dead end job, at least it's something that gets me out of the house. Whenever I'm off I feel so aimless and I have no idea what to do. I just wanna lay in bed and do nothing."
depression,fc0ekoc,t3_efd66s,1577288730.0,"I'm 23 and I can't even imagine living into my 30s. Whenever I talk to people about my depression, I don't feel like they understand that some people are just destined to never live a happy life and it's so sad."
GradSchool,fbz3mk5,t3_ef78yd,1577234070.0,I loved it when it was over.
selfimprovement,fbya3h1,t3_ef1f1g,1577211782.0,Life is complete bullshit. You get fucked if you take it too seriously and you get fucked if you don't take it seriously enough.
selfimprovement,fby83od,t1_fby5cqt,1577210384.0,Attitude doesn't matter. Attitude won't fix anything in my life.
selfimprovement,fbxrzlv,t3_eexs7h,1577198894.0,I'm not successful and I already receive a lot of criticism. I'll never be successful anyway so I don't know how much more criticism I'd receive.
depression,fbwqpkd,t1_fbwpn54,1577156909.0,"I don't believe I will ever find one. There is no ""light at the end of the tunnel"" for me."
depression,fbwn85p,t3_eepvoe,1577154355.0,None of those things will work. I've given up on trying to help my depression.
careerguidance,fbdlj3n,t1_fbcbf6d,1576765517.0,I'm currently stuck in a stressful job filling prescriptions for whiny rich people. I'm convinced this is just what my life will always be.
careerguidance,fbdlfrf,t1_fbcv3n5,1576765448.0,Success is a state I'm unfamiliar with. I guess that's one reason why I asked this question to begin with. I honestly don't believe I'm good enough for a real career.
careerguidance,fbdl97i,t1_fbcpo99,1576765311.0,I don't know if I can go another decade. I can't even imagine living into my 30s.
careerguidance,fbdl7ia,t1_fbc6e0d,1576765276.0,"Yeah I can see how ugly things could get during lay offs. I'm sure if I were to be in a position like that, knowing my luck I'd be the first to go."
careerguidance,fbdl30o,t1_fbc5v1z,1576765183.0,"That's great! I'm glad to hear you got a better job and you're much happier. However, I don't believe I will ever land one. I don't see myself as competent enough for one and I don't think any employer will be stupid enough to want to hire me."
careerguidance,fbdkwxy,t1_fbdjil1,1576765056.0,"I appreciate your story, but my misfortunes will never end. I can guarantee a decade from now I will still be working a shitty job with shit pay."
ForeverAlone,fbc0hkw,t3_ecgpk0,1576712673.0,People really don't understand that our attitudes are a result of how awful life and people are to us.
nyc,fb9vjht,t1_fb9e9v7,1576651553.0,And?
nyc,fb7j68v,t1_fb7hwb2,1576591604.0,Nice try conspirator. Why would you even need to go to class when the government is paying you to be a part of this whole conspiracy? You can't fool me lizard person.
