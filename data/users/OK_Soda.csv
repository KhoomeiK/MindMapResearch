borderlands3,ffumac4,t3_ev0kn8,1580244961.0,"Couple dumb questions.

1. If a weapon does, like, 100 damage and then in the text below it says something like +100% damage, does that mean that the ""base"" version of that gun does 50 damage and this one gets +100% so it is listed as 100 damage? Or does it mean that it says 100 but will actually shoot for 200?

2. I know that the Recurring Hex is considered one of the best grenades in the game, if not *the* best. I had a MIRV Hex and was using it because I know the community considered it very good, even though the listed damage was very bad.  

    My buddy picked up a Recurring Hex while we were playing and started talking about how he found a legendary grenade with really shitty damage, and I immediately asked if it was a Hex and I told him to keep it because it's one of the best in the game, but I realized I had no idea why and I didn't sell him on it and he ended up giving it to me. 

    So lucky me I guess, but why actually *is* it so good? Especially the one he got, which does like 600 damage and has 110% cryo efficiency, so there isn't even a huge amount of extra elemental damage or something (the MIRV one I had did ~4000 shock, which made up for the low base damage)."
Borderlands,ffuhn71,t1_fft3npy,1580242144.0,"With Zane the #1 thing you want to get is a Seein' Dead class mod, which drops from just about anywhere in the Moxxy DLC. I got like four or five of them doing the main mission and side quests there, it's very easy to get. What the mod does is it makes it so you have a chance to trigger your kill skills whenever you damage an enemy instead of only when you kill them. With the right weapons and skill point build you can make it so your activated abilities are always on. Look up ""invincible zane"" on youtube and you'll find a few different videos that explain this build."

Borderlands,ffug1sn,t1_ffqo71e,1580241196.0,I got one from a Typhon drop I missed on my first playthrough and until I got a Brainstormer it was almost the only gun I would use. Even on non-shield enemies it does insane damage.

Borderlands,ffufc0v,t1_ffudblj,1580240767.0,"Some games do feature a mechanic like this called a ""pity timer"" that basically increases your odds of getting higher tier loot based on how many drops you've gone without getting such loot."
Borderlands,ffuf87v,t1_ffu61go,1580240703.0,"It's especially weird in games like this that don't really have any pay to win mechanic. In some games you can buy tokens or whatever to get more loot boxes or more opportunities to get loot boxes or something dumb like that, so making the grind incredibly tedious and boring incentivizes you to just spend money to get the thing you want. But Borderlands doesn't have that mechanic, they just want you to stay interested in the game long enough to buy the DLCs pretty much, so the only reason not to improve drop rates is because at some point you get everything you want and don't need to play anymore."

borderlands3,fekk5z0,t1_fekcef4,1579201747.0,I started a TVHM game a few days ago and just got off Pandora so this is good timing to farm for the Brainstormer while I'm on Promethea.
whowouldwin,fei48cz,t1_fehzvul,1579129929.0,"Girion basically founded Dale and was its only ruler until he and the city itself were destroyed by Smaug. He is the oldest known member of his line, of which only Bard and Bard's children are also known. Equating him and his line to Aragorn or the Stewards of Gondor is like saying the mayor of some small town in Bumfuck, Nowhere shares similar stature to the Queen of England.

And, again, Aragorn is literally superhuman with supernatural ancestry. Elrond is his distant uncle. Boromir and Faramir are also Numenorean. There is no known lineage past Girion and nothing to suggest he carries enhanced elven blood. Bard is just, like, a villager who's good with a bow. Yes, he establishes his own monarchy, but only after achieving great fame and fortune by killing Smaug."
pics,fei2exy,t1_fehqbnq,1579128791.0,"This is the dumbest part. Like, if your mom posts a photo of you murdering someone, the police aren't going to be like ""it's unfortunate your mom chose to post internal family matters on social media"". If you legitimately do something wrong, the authorities will *want* to know about it. If you're Catholic, you're *supposed* to confess your sins, not hide them and hope the priest doesn't check your Facebook. But these assholes are acting like the real tragedy is that they found out, which suggests that they know full well that the cake and the sweater don't mean anything at all."
whowouldwin,fehxun2,t1_feho8yr,1579126038.0,"What about it? In the movie they shoot him with a ballista bolt once to knock the scale off and again to kill him. They had ballista bolts in medieval France. All someone has to do is shoot him twice, which, while unlikely, is entirely possible."

It's been awhile since I saw the movie and I was confused by the prompt, thought this meant movie Smaug wasn't missing any scales and they just shot him normally. I forgot they had to shoot him twice, once to knock the scale off and again to kill him."
whowouldwin,fehx64w,t1_fehkzun,1579125635.0,"There is no reason to think that Bard is superhuman by our standards. Most humans in Middle Earth are just regular humans. It's true that there are superhumans like Aragorn, but Bard is not Numenorean, nor was he some noble prince who trained his whole life for battle. He's basically just some nobody villager who was good with a bow, which medieval France had plenty of."
whowouldwin,fehwugf,t1_fehs9ws,1579125450.0,"Aragorn is not ""just a man"", he's the descendant of Isildur and carries royal Numenorean blood, which is itself part elven and is blessed by Eonwe to grant greater strength and intelligence. Aragorn is 88 in the books and is in the prime of his life. He is absolutely superhuman.

Bard is just some fucking guy with no special ancestry or superhuman powers."
whowouldwin,fehk8ji,t1_fehexdz,1579118242.0,"I mean, Bard did it, and he was just a regular guy. The question is how soon can they kill Smaug. They have the technology immediately, it's just a matter of someone getting a good shot, and there was almost certainly someone around who could do it with enough luck.

Edit: It's been awhile since I saw the movie and I was confused by the prompt, thought this meant movie Smaug wasn't missing any scales and they just shot him normally. I forgot they had to shoot him twice, once to knock the scale off and again to kill him. But anyway, it doesn't really change anything. They just have to get two lucky shots, which is insanely unlikely, but all the prompt asks is whether or not it could happen, and it could. They had the same ballista technology as Lake Town, and a blind man shooting randomly could theoretically hit Smaug twice, however unlikely it may be."

WoT,feh9ru5,t3_ep3nts,1579112105.0,"When I was like 13, the movie the Parent Trap came out (bear with me here). I developed a massive crush on Lindsay Lohan and got involved with the fandom, to the extent that one could get involved with any fandom in 1998. 

At the time I had basically just gotten past reading Goosebumps and was now reading Lord of the Rings over and over because I didn't know what else to read. I became pretty good friends with another guy in the fandom who introduced me to the Jhereg series, and when I blew through that he introduced me to Wheel of Time, and the rest is history."
