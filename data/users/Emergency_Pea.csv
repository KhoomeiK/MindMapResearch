AskVet,feczp4r,t1_fecbkba,1578991440.0,Do you know what brand/where you can get these? I’ve been struggling to find boots that will stay on my poodle/Pom mix’s toothpick ankles
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feag2n1,t1_fe9e87x,1578948231.0,"Hah, yours has got the innocent face mastered too"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feaflma,t1_fe9eepj,1578948126.0,"Lol, I work there and my coworker sent it to me."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feaffo5,t1_fe9wsg7,1578948045.0,"Oh, she’s the princess at home. We share a queen bed, by which I mean she gets 3/4 of it and I squeeze in on the edge."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feaf8p4,t1_feaee30,1578947941.0,Box DNA test said Pomeranian x poodle. Those tests aren’t very reliable but I think it suits him haha
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feaf5jv,t1_fea7mzn,1578947890.0,"Pomeranian x poodle, according to a box DNA test kit. Not totally reliable, but I go with it cause I think it’s funny"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe9e2u3,t1_fe7drlr,1578936716.0,"funny enough mine would never share a bed! The big one isn’t a snuggler at all and likes to have her own space, so in her mind what they’re doing here is preferable to getting too close lmao"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe9d9sl,t1_fe9bd0m,1578936534.0,TOTALLY unbothered. He’s a little asshole. I love him.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe9d7ks,t1_fe8u8qr,1578936510.0,We’re actually super lucky with our setup! I work at the kennel they’re at so it’s basically a second home for them. Whenever we go out of town they board for a couple days (we want to keep them comfortable with it in case we ever need to board them in an emergency) and then one of my coworkers will bring them home until we get back :)
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe6qhjd,t1_fe6ppmk,1578900638.0,"Haha I can see that, she’s just licking her lips. She’s not too happy about the situation but she’d take a bullet for the little guy and would never ask him to move, so she’s asking my friend (I work at the kennel so they know all the staff well) to do it for her. Don’t worry, my friend swapped them right after this!"
ExNoContact,fdjfhrh,t1_fdh9r3x,1578468586.0,I’ve got a Matt who’s been way too on my mind today this is so lovely thank you universe! We got this gang
depression,fd8aaoo,t3_ek3uky,1578215838.0,"Here’s what helped me through a nasty, cruel breakup a year ago: It’s going to feel horrible for a long time, there’s no sugarcoating that, but in the big picture this is a GOOD thing. You’ve been given the opportunity to purge your life of people who don’t care for you the way you deserve. You’re going to have to go through the whole process of learning to live and be okay without these people and it’s going to suck but in the long run the life you deserve has no room for people who have the capability to do something like this. It’ll feel like two big, horrible, empty holes in your life for a while but in betraying you they’ve done you a favor - you now have room in your life, once you feel ready to let them in, for new people who can care for you and love you properly. Your wounds will heal and someday you’ll be so happy with someone and this will all be a distant memory."
DecidingToBeBetter,f9wapwy,t3_e76v9w,1575689698.0,I don’t know what your bf is like but I’d really recommend watching [this](https://youtu.be/OYoIVCHVwKI) video and looking into attachment theory. I’ve definitely got a very anxious attachment style and it sounds like you do too.
