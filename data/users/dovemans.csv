I’m saying the concept of ‘stealing’ these stories are wrong. All of these older stories would have been in the common culture of all the people in the levant. Some of these people will have evolved into the jewish tribes, taking these stories with them, and like language(which include names), these stories morph over the ages. Then, some of these people from the jewish tribes will have turned into christians(although not referring to themselves that way.) Just because there’s an earlier source of a certain text doesn’t mean only those people had those believes or invented them in the first place. That’s just not how language and stories spread. It’s better to think of it as a game of telegraph/telephone over the ages.   


Imagine if you will; a tribe with a common language having a story about a man called Shesma, that sells fruit from a magical jar. Throughout history, the tribe grows bigger and one part migrates further north. Their language changes slightly, calling the man in the story Sjesma. The other’original'  people from the tribe starts saying it’s golden apples he sells.   
Some political upheaval in the northern tribe catalyzes a new religion. it grows over the years to be distinct enough from the original tribe’s. Their texts get written down. Suddenly there’s a story about a man called Sjesma and one called Shesma, one with just fruit, one with golden apples. The new religion didn’t steal from the old one. It’s the same story from the same people with permutations that snuck in.   


I agree on the fact that **after** christianity was well established it did take over loads of peoples customs and made them their own. But very few if any got put **in the bible.** Which is the crux of the original point I was debating. Not christianity as a whole."
tifu,fcu2k8j,t1_fcu1tc1,1577970540.0,"mate, I consider myself a hardcore atheist. I also love these old stories you keep referring to. It seems you're just eager to 'disprove some christian nut' without knowing anything about the history behind it. I'm sad I wasted my time with you."

Well no, that's the point I'm trying to make. These people are the same. It's not like some random group came and said hey we're jewish now, let's take these stories. History and religion in those days were practically the same. These stories came from a long time ago and were the ancestors of the jewish people and more, but these are still their stories. There's no disconnect.

Iâ€™m saying the concept of â€˜stealingâ€™ these stories are wrong. All of these older stories would have been in the common culture of all the people in the levant. Some of these people will have evolved into the jewish tribes, taking these stories with them, and like language(which include names), these stories morph over the ages. Then, some of these people from the jewish tribes will have turned into christians(although not referring to themselves that way.) Just because thereâ€™s an earlier source of a certain text doesnâ€™t mean only those people had those believes or invented them in the first place. Thatâ€™s just not how language and stories spread. Itâ€™s better to think of it as a game of telegraph/telephone over the ages.   


Imagine if you will; a tribe with a common language having a story about a man called Shesma, that sells fruit from a magical jar. Throughout history, the tribe grows bigger and one part migrates further north. Their language changes slightly, calling the man in the story Sjesma. The otherâ€™original'  people from the tribe starts saying itâ€™s golden apples he sells.   
Some political upheaval in the northern tribe catalyzes a new religion. it grows over the years to be distinct enough from the original tribeâ€™s. Their texts get written down. Suddenly thereâ€™s a story about a man called Sjesma and one called Shesma, one with just fruit, one with golden apples. The new religion didnâ€™t steal from the old one. Itâ€™s the same story from the same people with permutations that snuck in.   


I agree on the fact that **after** christianity was well established it did take over loads of peoples customs and made them their own. But very few if any got put **in the bible.** Which is the crux of the original point I was debating. Not christianity as a whole."
tifu,fcu2k8j,t1_fcu1tc1,1577970540.0,"mate, I consider myself a hardcore atheist. I also love these old stories you keep referring to. It seems you're just eager to 'disprove some christian nut' without knowing anything about the history behind it. I'm sad I wasted my time with you."

Well no, that's the point I'm trying to make. These people are the same. It's not like some random group came and said hey we're jewish now, let's take these stories. History and religion in those days were practically the same. These stories came from a long time ago and were the ancestors of the jewish people and more, but these are still their stories. There's no disconnect.   


> it carried on into scandanavia and ancient Britain very evidently claiming just about every pagan belief and holy day.
