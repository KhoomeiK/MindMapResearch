macrogrowery,fc744rk,t1_fc73fpx,1577497030.0,This is true. Bluer/brighter the flame = cleaner combustion. Yellow flame is dirty and incomplete combustion which causes soot and many other thing that will ruin the flavour of your crops. All co2 gens running properly have a nice bright blue flame. I am a plumber/gasfitter b and also run many generators. They are used in many green houses everywhere. Look into them

macrogrowery,fc70rxw,t3_egim8o,1577494478.0,"It may appear that it speeds up flowering because how fat the buds can be even at week 4-5 but it doesnt. The trichomes will ripen just the same as without co2. 

Ive run multiple “standing pilot” generators before that constantly gave off co2 24/7 via pilot flame. There was no difference good or bad having levels of around 800-1000 at night. Hence why most co2 ppm controllers have a photocell that turns the unit off at night"
