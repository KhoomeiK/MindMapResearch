They may have some options (meds or non meds) to help, there are definitely other options worth looking into, even if they arent perfect, every bit helps. Best of luck!"

bujo,ff95i8n,t3_eq0mt7,1579705322.0,"Ya i do a hybrid. Bought a Tul with planner inserts so the monthly calendar is in there as are spaces for all the days (1 week per 2 large pages). But since its a Tul, I can insert blank pages for all my spreads which I put ahead of the calendar section. Have all my monthly and annual spreads first then on the month calendar i do a super basic ""things to do this month"" in the notes section. Then for my dailys, the spaces are pretty sizable so i have a system using a key, different ink colours and partitions of the days box to organize the day...tasks, notes, gratitude, etc. I dont think i could do it with a smaller sized planner or with one that doesnt have the inserts, just because i like how customizable its been. But just because it isnt ""just"" a bullet journal or a traditional one, doesnt mean it cant work for you :)"

There is nothing in the video showing that hed be a threat to anyone or anything on the flight...unless shes claiming hes a service dog...which would be dumb because of what i said prior. did watch the video but dont recall her specifying. if she IS claiming that then ya, that looks bad on service dogs and is shitty, though people arent technically allowed to ask for proof of anything (for these exact discrimination type reasons)."

pics,feh4gtf,t1_fegperw,1579108949.0,"Your comment is definitely not aggressive, youre right there. And i genuinely didnt mean to seem like i was only frustrated with you, its the whole thread. My issue isnt with you having a different opinion its just...is it helpful to say here? Did it need to be said here? Especially among all the other negativity? I just feel like when people are clearly down, there is no need to be negative...hes already having the worst day of his like. You dont have to lie and pretend youre cool with it, but if he didnt ask, why give a negative opinion?"
pics,feh3z4f,t1_fegpney,1579108659.0,"..you didnt have to do anything past reading the title or at worst seeing the picture if your reddit is set up to automatically make the pics bigger...same thing can happen on any type of social media and for literally any reason. I might think someone posts too many pictures of their kids but I dont stop and scold them in the comments section. You dont have to agree with everything people post. You dont have to agree with this type of grieving but imo, when someone is clearly grieving, if you cant say something nice then just stfu and move on...the guy is in pain, this is one of his ways of dealing with it, dont make it worse. If its not for you, carry on."
pics,fegoyrt,t1_fegm7el,1579099083.0,"People who don't like it or upset by it she just move on then. Best possible case scenario is that they a get make themselves feel a bit better by posting something hurtful.

No ones forcing anyone to say anything..."

pics,fegogse,t1_fegnv1c,1579098727.0,What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you make a habit of running around and insulting and belittling people who are grieving or only when you feel empowered being a keyboard?

pics,fegnggm,t1_fegk55q,1579097989.0,"Why not keep it to yourself then? Instead of letting him be, people in here are torching him when he is sharing something he has been through this whole thing.

ValveIndex,fedwnvn,t1_febjore,1579021464.0,"This is the main reason i was looking forward to the index personally. the rift isnt unwearable (obviously) for me but i have been prone to some motion sickness and im wanting to play through skyrim which....will cause motion sickness if im not careful. but i have still noticed some issues with the index. though through some of the comments on here, i need to see if i cant sort out the headset as that may be my issue."
ValveIndex,fedwful,t1_fed13in,1579021329.0,how? like turn on steam vr before actually putting it on?

ValveIndex,fedw2ax,t1_fec0r2n,1579021103.0,Oh that makes sense! id been playing around in skyrim and noticed the bow was way better with the index but ya...its because i can track behind my face. grenades are another thing i hadnt really thought of. thanks!
ValveIndex,fedvx5j,t1_feba6g4,1579021017.0,ahh ya i can feel you there. were able to technically afford both but we could definitely use the extra 1000 elsewhere lol. but ya that was our biggest thing...index isnt bad but was super underwhelming.
ValveIndex,fedvszw,t1_fecdy8e,1579020949.0,"thank you for all the info here, very involved and i appreciate it!
weve been using the sensors lower (havent mounted them yet), and we are definitely going to mount them before making our final decision because i feel like it makes sense that theyd be better then. 
Interface does suck in comparison, but if everything else is as good or better if we can get there, i can figure out the interface for now."
ValveIndex,fedv8jr,t1_feaxyl8,1579020611.0,"Everyone keeps talking about the audio which is kind of funny. it is undoubtedly louder . But my husband has a pretty significant hearing deficit (nearly deaf on one side and diminished on the other), so youd think hed like the index better too but he honestly has had no issues with the rift. again, i know its louder and i havent played the index enough to know if the sound quality is better. just funny, because sound is usually his first issue and it hasnt been."
ValveIndex,fedusut,t1_feagiju,1579020350.0,"Sorry i definitely should have mentioned we both have baller computers. So we should definitely be getting the benefit there.
I will be playing skyrim, which i know is old af but i have noticed some precision improvements. My husband plays way more shooters. He did boneworks on the rift and did pretty well with it but i know hes hoping to play more of them. 
And i think youre probably right about headset comfort...it is genuinely significantly heavier than the rift, no getting around that, but we just need to fugre out how to tweak it. Just kind of frustrating as were sharing it and the rift has just been so effortlessly comfortable."
ValveIndex,feduhva,t1_fe94k0u,1579020163.0,"Will definitely look into this if we go that route thanks, wouldnt have thought about it"
ValveIndex,fedueop,t1_fe98slw,1579020107.0,He actually apparently figured out the strap adjustment just before i told him about your comment lol. And ya the behind us tracking is what we were hoping would improve...maybe we just havent given it enough time.

SkincareAddiction,fdndkzw,t1_fdmbiws,1578583524.0,"I think they're misunderstanding what your question is. It wint affect future children for mom taking the med. So if shes currently pregnant, it can affect that baby. If shes taken the med in the past, stopped it then got pregnant, this baby is completely safe. If there are issues with the make baby because his mom was on the med while he was in the oven, he can have issues with his fertility and anatomy and all that. Hope this helped :)"

TwoXChromosomes,fca4in0,t1_fc9pg3p,1577562947.0,"I'll admit I had not read acogs recommendations  on this, specifically young women. But I'm going to emphasize the following paragraph as to why so many drs are hesitant...

Sterilization and Regret
Approximately 14% of sterilized women request information about sterilization reversal, though only approximately 1% of women obtain the procedure (2). Young age at sterilization and being a woman of color are associated with seeking reversal information and obtaining the reversal procedure. Those aged 18–24 years at the time of sterilization are nearly four times more likely to seek reversal information and nearly eight times more likely to undergo a reversal procedure than women who are sterilized at 30 years or older. Women of color also are more likely than white women to seek reversal information or to report that a sterilization procedure prevented them from having desired children (3, 6). In one report, one half of the women of color who were young and unmarried at the time of sterilization ultimately requested information about reversal (2). Women who request sterilization in conjunction with a recent pregnancy (including at the time of cesarean delivery, postpartum, or at the time of abortion) also may be more likely to be dissatisfied with their decision, though data are inconsistent ([30](https://m.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Ethics/Sterilization-of-Women-Ethical-Issues-and-Considerations#30), [31](https://m.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Ethics/Sterilization-of-Women-Ethical-Issues-and-Considerations#31))."
TwoXChromosomes,fca344n,t1_fc9oxzy,1577562382.0,"Not standard practice to do vasectomies that early either. Your husband got lucky there. Both options are suppose to be seen as permanent and it is not uncommon for people to change their minds on kids. Anecdotally, I never would have thought I'd want kids, nearly 30 now and actually starting to consider it....would t be an option if I had a surgery already....rules and guidelines are made based on statistics not individuals. You may never change your mind but it's no uncommon. And again, neither are seen as reversible, even though people seem to think you can just do and undo vasectomies no problem."
