ShitAmericansSay,ff7dl1m,t1_ff7d1o8,1579647094.0,"Just to note that some students here in Finland need to travel quite a lot to get to school. Like if you live in a smallish village it's easily 30-60min to  school as the distances are pretty big here. And the 5 hours is not 100% correct. Yeah for smaller children but not for older

Not saying that there aren't differences in Finnish and US culture, but that here the bus to school can also take a while"
Makeup,ff5azaa,t3_eroahq,1579585704.0,"I'd try some pretty inexpensive brands like bh, nyx, and essence and that way find colours that you like and suit you. And ask help from the staff as they're pretty much professional. 

The most important thing is to have fun and just try stuff"
eulaw,fet2uik,t1_fes0wco,1579371308.0,"Well I studied in the Netherlands and we had loads of foreign students. I don't think it's too difficult to get to a uni in EU as a foreigner. You just need to fill certain criteria like sufficient language skills (depends on the program whether it's English or something else), have relevant ba (depends on the specialization and school what is required), and be able to pay the tuition fee. As for working in the EU, every country has their own requirements on what they require you to have to be a lawyer. As I studied in the Netherlands but practice in Finland I need to take some extra courses. But other countries have different rules. Ofc you need to make sure you have a relevant visa and other stuff in order. When it comes to studies, I understood that it's relatively easy to get a student visa.

Edit: when I was checking out unis I used https://llm-guide.com/ to see what's out there. As unis and countries differ, it'd be easier to give you an advice if you had a specific country or specialization in mind"
eulaw,feo34fu,t3_eq5f2a,1579294520.0,"It kinda depends where you wanna study and what spÃ©cialisation you want to do. As you're from turkey, when checking different unis remember to check the non eu tuition fee"
ShitAmericansSay,femvzmi,t1_femvxu3,1579271064.0,Okay well I hope that things have gone to the right direction during these 10 years :)
ShitAmericansSay,femvjts,t1_femsedj,1579270741.0,"Yeah it's alwaus difficult to speak about stuff that don't directly affect you. It just may be that you don't notice that kind of behavior. Luckily, generally speaking, progress is being made."
ShitAmericansSay,femrnfh,t1_femqohd,1579267641.0,"Hmm the second one is relatively old (from 2013) and, hopefully, things have changed since then. Ofc as I'm white I cant say what really goes on, but I've never witnessed anything like that. And like I said in this other comment, it's strange as Helsinki is our biggest city and the most versatile"
ShitAmericansSay,femrfij,t1_femoucd,1579267458.0,"That's really strange as Helsinki is our biggest city and has loads of tourists and what not. Was this recently? Like I said, I've never heard of anything like this. I'm sorry for your friend"
ShitAmericansSay,femmfoi,t1_femjfah,1579262532.0,Where in Finland did that happen? Cause I haven't heard of stuff like that happening here.
ShitAmericansSay,femm3b7,t1_femjfmi,1579262129.0,"Sorry if I wasn't clear, I didn't mean to undermine your comment or how you've experienced the differences between Finland and Sweden. I just wanted to comment how I've seen the situation as I'm living in a bigger city here.

With the better immigration policies I  meant that in Finland immigrants aren't dumped in one certain area but they are  integrated in the Finnish society. Hence the lack of ghetto"
ShitAmericansSay,femj6w3,t1_femho02,1579258309.0,"Well it really depends on whether you look at the bigger cities or rural areas of Finland. Ofc the rural area is more conservative than bigger cities. And not having ""ghetto"" can be seen as a sign of better immigration policies"
plants,fejdy97,t3_epgnw2,1579169358.0,Hmm I think it's the elephant bush as the leaves are rounder than with sedum makinoi

Lawyertalk,fdqqo8p,t1_fdqqbvn,1578672813.0,"Just checked it. It's pretty much what I studied. A big part of my studies was about how to think outside the box when it comes to new legal issues. But included more legal stuff like ipr and data protection. Don't regret it at all. And dunno, for reference I graduated 2018 so relatively recently

Edited to add. Where I studied there was a load of electives so you could actually focus on stuff you were interested in. So it could have been really specific or more broad llm"
Lawyertalk,fdqnpnj,t3_ems9hm,1578670958.0,"Don't know if it's exactly what you mean, but I did my llm in law and technology. Now working with ipr. I think it's a good llm and I haven't regretted studying it"
eulaw,fdlaqvs,t3_elzctw,1578520041.0,I think you'd get a better answer from r/legaladviceEurope as you're more interested in a specific law in a member state and not in general of EU law. Ofc some eu law applies but I'm uncertain about how far it goes in Portugal
relationship_advice,fddtgh7,t1_fddhzto,1578323543.0,Same here. And I bookmark some of the craziest stuff. But it might be just because I want to watch the world burn and/or because I'm a masochist and like to torture myself
PurplePillDebate,fdd05eg,t3_ekowg6,1578289641.0,"Not really. The only thing is that I prefer to date guys with similar traits, smart, enthusiastic about their career, fun. So far had no problems finding an amazing ltr"
Lawyertalk,fda50um,t1_fda4uyl,1578241768.0,"Yeah I don't think it's possible. Not based there, but I believe that you need to be a part of the bar and to get there you need to have a legit degree"
Lawyertalk,fda18z3,t3_ekepz0,1578240520.0,"Depends on where you are located. Where I'm from or nearby countries, nope. Somewhere else, maybe. It also depends what qualifications you want to have and where you want to represent"
LegalAdviceEurope,fd8oxg5,t1_fd8opbd,1578221153.0,Okay that's good. Not the insults but the reporting. I truly hope that you get him banned or by other means to stop harassing you. Some people just shouldn't be let online
LegalAdviceEurope,fd8layz,t1_fd8bmem,1578219656.0,I'm a lawyer and I back this up. Reporting is the easiest method. And sometimes the most efficient way to make stuff like this stop. The problem with police is that they might not take stuff like this seriously enough. Especially if the perpetrator is in another country.
LegalAdviceEurope,fd8ekqp,t1_fd8e30t,1578217552.0,"Yeah I'd report that. But like someone said, the police may be a bit difficult and not take this seriously. That's why I also suggest reporting. What game was it where you won him? Maybe report him there too even if he hasn't made those threats there"
LegalAdviceEurope,fd8d0xq,t1_fd8ch1r,1578217064.0,"Okay depending on the level of the messages I'd either just report and block, or if they are seriously threatening you, I'd contact the police with screenshots of the messages"
ShitAmericansSay,fd82edk,t1_fd823iw,1578213113.0,"As I've said. The guy who posted this is American. He's in Estonia though, but yeah he's American"
LegalAdviceEurope,fd81zp5,t3_ek9kn0,1578212968.0,"You have reported him to steam, right? Have you also reported him to the social media platform where he sent you those other messages? Where has he posted your steam info?

Edit: why on earth am I getting down voted? OP just didn't give this info and it was necessary for the easiest options"
relationships,fd5hi43,t1_fd4vel2,1578177706.0,"A lawyer here, specialised in tech issues, not UK though. I'd say the best option is to go to the cops if you really want to escalate things to that level. Personally I'd just tell my parents and involve my gf's parents and give him the talking of the lifetime.

I don't know how much a lawyer can do in this situation. Especially anything inexpensive"
cats,fd3jzw6,t1_fd3imws,1578159025.0,"More like Norwegian or some mixture of different languages. We don't use Ã¸ nor Å“ in Finnish

Edit okay yeah there's so much to unpack here. In Finnish we just has Ã¤ Ã¶ Ã¥ as ""special"" characters"
cats,fd2vasm,t1_fd2ttu8,1578151955.0,Yeah and using Ã¶ as o makes the whole word sound completely different
cats,fd2jzhl,t1_fd2fmd7,1578148321.0,"Yep. As my native language has Ã¶ and Ã¤ and Ã¥ in its normal vocabulary, stuff like this makes my eyes bleed. Luckily the cat was super cute so it helped"
niceguys,fcxcwxw,t1_fcx7z80,1578059518.0,Yeah and if it happened in the EU it'd be breaching the GDPR in so many ways that a privacy officer would have a field day with it
ShitAmericansSay,fcwv5vc,t1_fcwr6gw,1578038934.0,"Like I said, he's an American living in Estonia"
ShitAmericansSay,fcuainc,t3_eiycy6,1577976447.0,"Yeah, as a citizen of a fucktard European country bordering Russia, US is the first place I look for assistance instead of our own military."

PurplePillDebate,fctvcj9,t3_eivytr,1577961439.0,Do people actually call guys ugly to reject them? Instead of just saying that they aren't interested?
ShitAmericansSay,fcsjaes,t1_fcshuh5,1577917671.0,It was an American living in Estonia who posted this.
ShitAmericansSay,fcs7f0w,t1_fcs7cow,1577912488.0,I have no idea
PurplePillDebate,fcks0x9,t1_fckryy5,1577731939.0,Okay you do you I guess. Have fun trying your method.
PurplePillDebate,fckrudv,t1_fckrkvc,1577731828.0,Sure hot and interesting people may do that. But in my eyes mind games like that make the person just really unattractive. So I don't see why bother. There are other hot and interesting people you don't have to spend your time doing stupid shit like this
PurplePillDebate,fckrbdp,t1_fckr32t,1577731504.0,"Why would I? I have too much respect for myself and people I socialise with to play some stupid mind games.

And do you know what ""be my guest"" even means?"
PurplePillDebate,fckqnhz,t1_fckqjve,1577731094.0,"Yeah, girls.

If you wanna be with someone so immature that plays games like that, be my guest."
PurplePillDebate,fckpqaj,t3_ehpd8d,1577730527.0,"If you'd do that to me I'd be more than happy to be without you. Sure, for some people with lower self-esteem or something that could work as a way to coerce her.

For me that'd just show me your true colours and make me want to have nothing to do with you"
PurplePillDebate,fckehsf,t1_fckcspf,1577723525.0,All cool. Yeah that's the thing I hate most about this sub. Everyone makes broad gÃ©nÃ©ralisations of the opposite sex and forget that people are individuals
PurplePillDebate,fcka3bc,t1_fcka0ah,1577720603.0,Then they can only blame themselves
PurplePillDebate,fck78p3,t1_fck5q48,1577718537.0,"I want people I'm dealing with to understand that when I say no it truly means no. Not maybe or convince me or anything else but no. If they don't get that I don't want them in my life.

Yes, there are girls playing stupid games but I don't see why adult people would like to partake in these

Edited a typo"
PurplePillDebate,fck64x5,t1_fck5cax,1577717673.0,"Some play these stupid games, absolutely. But it doesn't make OP sound any less arrogant while he claims women as whole do it"
PurplePillDebate,fck3697,t3_ehlz4a,1577715206.0,I want to be equal partners with my bf. Of course there are things he's better at and there's things I'm better at and that's perfectly okay. We help each other in things that we excell and figure out stuff we don't know how to do together. We are partners and in it together. I don't want to walk over him and neither does he want to put me between a fist and a stove
PurplePillDebate,fcjztyd,t1_fcjznvl,1577712037.0,"That's cool and you do you. My take is that if a girl plays games like that, she's exactly like that, a girl. People shouldn't waste time on people who aren't mature enough to know what they want and be straight about it.

Like when starting to date my bf we were both up front about our goals and wishes and surprise surprise, no stupid games and time wasted"
PurplePillDebate,fcjyn4m,t1_fcjycyr,1577710720.0,"I know we don't represent all women. But people here also need to remember that not all women are those who play stupid games.

Like I said, I don't know if it's a cultural thing or something but I don't know anyone irl who acts like that."
PurplePillDebate,fcjq7v4,t3_ehil3z,1577699115.0,"Thank god my bf understands that when I say no I truly and actually mean no. Not maybe, not change my mind, nothing else but no.

I don't know if it's a cultural thing or something but I know for a fact that neither I nor any of my friends play these games you're so sure women play.

If I say no when getting to know a guy and he doesn't respect it, it's done. Period"
