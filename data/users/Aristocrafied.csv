The Economist already last year showed that the yield curve is quite flat again. Although it is no certainty, a flat(sometimes even inverted) curve has preceded all the recent economic crashes.. I'd say try to make sure you have even more savings and your job is secure by the time it hits ( I know it's hard to have job security but at least you're in IT which is a branche that will always need competent people no matter what, computers gonna fail..

todayilearned,fg31iwd,t3_ew76tw,1580465983.0,"I have a lazy eye. But recently during my studies I stumbled on something I didn't know. Apparently your left and right eye have sort of strips of visual cortex allocated. And sometimes it is not the eye itsself that has the problem, it is that these strips were asymmetrically allocated. So you could even switch your eyes around and it wouldn't make a difference as there just isn't enough computing power to interpret the signal. Since most if this allocation takes place when nobody can really pick up on it. You can't really influence it. 

The funny thing is though. My lazy eye used to be at +6.75 and my other eye at +1.75
I got bullied in school cuz ot the glasses so when I switched schools at a bout 8-9 y/o I ditched the glasses.

I alternate between deep depression and being able to push all feeling away and living numb and have had years of numbness in which I had to learn how to do non verbal communication because the emotionless pokerface just made people distrust me.

So now they have become a habit and even when I can actually feel I am resorting to those automatically and it works to convince people when I answer fine or good. 

Ofcourse not everyone is fooled, people closer to you tend to notice which is why you ask it I guess, you notice an inconsistency or something.

Best thing I'd say if they are an open person, is to ask them again after a few interactions into a conversation. When you're alone or out of range of others so they feel less burdoned to share."
