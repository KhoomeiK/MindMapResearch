While repotting I noticed it was actually 3 plants in one pot, so I split them and gave them each a different spot in my flat to study their behavior... Two of them are really struggling with low humidity, I can't seem to get 'em enough.

One is in my terrarium though and it's doing ok I guess? Not a lot of growth, but the leaves aren't drying out anymore.

movies,ff9mhwn,t1_ff8lff4,1579716097.0,"It's really fucking rude and insensitive, but it's not entirely wrong, only for the most part.

First of all, race is an overused concept in the context of skin colour. There are so many genetically and culturally different groups on this planet that skin colour means very little. It is however an indicator of geographical origin to an extent. Different locations mean different diet and immune response to varying substances.

Whether you like the smell of a person heavily depends on those two factors and their hygiene procedures. These are all factors that might be similar for specimens of geographically close ethnicities (but that doesn't have to be the case).

Since humans evolved to live in groups we obviously also evolved to like what is quite similar to ourselves instead of being repelled by it. Things, animals and people that are foreign to us may often seem alien at first.

In modern times ethnicities blend together more and more unrelated to skin colour: There's asian, american, european, scandinavian and african restaurants in every major city. Interbreeding between ethnicities mixes genes. Big companies advertise the same shampoo all over the globe. Most of us are used to lots of different smells. But the concept of global travel is still relatively new, so not everyone is inherently accustomed to every specific pattern.

... There's an old german proverb that fits my explanation quite well: ""Was der Bauer nicht kennt, das frisst er nicht"" which literally translates to ""What the farmer doesn't know he doesn't eat."""
todayilearned,ff999l8,t1_ff8zbp9,1579707780.0,"I'm not too fond of your wording. I've got the feeling there's a lower percentage of indians working as call center agents relative to india's population than there are americans relative to america's population. Stating indians often work those jobs is really unspecific and leaves a lot of angles to argue against your point.

I'd rather say that a lot of outsourcing call centers tend to employ indians, because there's more competition and thus lower pay involved. Also, it's more practical than employing, say, chinese that probably don't speak english as well.
It's more specific and leaves less angles to argue against your point.

You could also say that those jobs often get worked by indians, which is closer to your wording but still changes perspective, thus indirectly 'blaming' the jobs, not the indians.

It's a small difference in meaning, but a big jump towards morality. If you choose to use one of those strategies you're more likely to settle disagreements peacefully and receive less backlash.

Also, smart doesn't mean perfect. Everyone fucks up sometimes, missing an 'n' in 'an' is a common mistake to make and overlook, too.

I wouldn't call myself stupid, but really smart people are on a whole different level. Connecting different concepts and using complex words to convey a meaning in the shortest way possible doesn't get you very far if you're talking to someone who knows very little about the stuff you're an expert on. Sometimes 'dumbing down' is the only way to converse with the people you love, and that shit gets exhausting after a while, it seems. Using this strategy is a social skill though, thus even more of an indicator of what I assume could be called 'smart'.

Of course the definition of 'smart' differs between people, so think of this whatever you like. Unrelated to whether the girl in question is actually smart or just nuts, I personally don't think this post is as bad as many of us want to make it look like."

With people in general becoming more and more hostile towards each other these days this is an actual risk one has to consider before deciding on a joke. Did you ever try to stop a freight train with your bare hands? Yeah, thought so.

Maybe it's even linked to evolution. Rhinos, hippos and elephants are all good examples for this: the bigger it is, the harder to kill. It's possibly ingrained in us as a species that picked up hunting hundreds of thousands of years ago.

It's the length that doesn't work out for me.

In my experience the jump from Small to Large has nothing to do with how wide you are in proportion to your height because they are most often tailored to fit above normal weight. Funnily enough that whole concept goes to shit as soon as you take a look at Extra Large, because that's just Large but even wider, so no added length sadly."
rant,fdp5517,t1_fdoj6gr,1578620225.0,"Ime clothing caters to people of slightly (but noticably) above normal weight - not fat though - because that's the new average.

It'd look absolutely hilarious, so I'm always super grateful for whichever brand decides to sell extra long hoodies, shirts and tees at the time so I can get myself some Small to Medium sized stuff instead of having to buy Large and look like a clown. At least my relatively slightly wider hips along with the skinny jeans trend of last decade make finding pants a lot easier.
