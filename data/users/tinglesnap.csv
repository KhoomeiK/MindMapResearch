The glorified scene draws outcasts and misfits, and not all of them have the life support, genetic advantage, money or information to navigate without getting pulled into addiction. I’m talking about Drugs Are Cool Culture, for example “friends” that’ll give you pills in response to a bad day instead of helping you process. 

Drug addiction is an illness and nothing to be shamed about. Drug addicts and alcoholics deserve so much compassion and people are just going to keep suffering and dying in this society that sees their illness as “their fault”.

Dude, experimenting is fine- but when you’re a grown ass adult snorting lines regularly/popping pills recreationally habitually, etc I just start paying closer attention to all of your other behavior. 

I’m not saying you can’t be cool if you do drugs, I’m just saying that I used to think it was cool and i thought i met a lot of cool people...; if the reason you’re doing drugs is because you’re running away from yourself or feelings or growing up it’s super obvious to me and everyone else and it’s not a cute look at all.

I believe that gender is a construct and sexuality is fluid. I think everything is on a spectrum. I don’t think labels are necessary, but many people do. 

What is wrong with people identifying how they want? It’s them taking their identity into their own hands instead of something being thrust upon them. Many (most) queer folk have built their identity out of reaction to what has been thrust upon them. I understand that it might be annoying that people have a million different words for who they are and how they identify, but you have to remember that often times one’s identity is all that person has. 

If it hurts you that other people identify as all these other things rather than just bisexual, can you imagine that it hurts other people to be “mis identified” the way you are raging about?"

Edit2: u/ThrowAwayTopHat1 is confusing biological sex for gender. 
Also, I got a bit mad about the implication that I must be mentally ill because of how I identify. 

Edit: “claim not to identify”? Are you the thought police? How do you know what it is like inside my head and inside my body?!

This is the kind of stuff that makes me strive to pass. I’m not sick in the head because i don’t identify as neither female nor male. If nobody knows, they treat me like a human being. 

It really makes me think that people that jump to conclusions like, “I’ve never heard of this, you *must* be sick” or “I’ve never heard of this and it makes me feel weird and it’s YOUR FAULT” are people that are closeted or curious but have been socialized to shame/suppress these feelings and explorations  so it triggers them when other people have open minds, open hearts."
AskReddit,feyg3e7,t1_feyeifw,1579445037.0,"I’m queer because I’m not straight. I don’t identify as a binary gender; so therefore any relationship I would be in would be a “gay” or “queer” relationship.  

Queer is an old word for ‘being strange’ as in, “look at that queer chair, it is not like the others”. 

When I was a lot younger I was bullied for being a “gross lesbian” because the other kids could tell I was different. I’m not a lesbian, but I have the capacity to be attracted to women. I have slept with other women in my life. Currently I am in a relationship with a heterosexual cis gendered male. I am still queer. 

Technically I *am* trans because anyone who doesn’t identify within the gender binary is lumped into the ‘trans’ label. Personally, I think that all of our current gender constructs are based on the male/female binary which is inherently wrong- identification based on this fallacy is just building in quicksand. 

Please ask any clarifying questions! This is exactly the kind of conversations that I think are necessary!"
AskReddit,feycm9p,t3_eqwbog,1579443797.0,"It stands for queer and I’m hearing questioning as well. 

I identify as queer. I present as a straight cis gendered female; you would never know I don’t identify outside of my born sex if I didn’t tell you. 

I’m not a homosexual, bisexual, or visibly trans. 

I like the Q a lot, because it reminds (me and) other people that I don’t have to be what they think LGBTQ+ means. 
My relationship with my sexuality and gender identity is very private. IRL I don’t feel it is anyone’s business to know who I am inside (I also do not share my religious nor political views).

Generally other members of the LQBTQ+ community (which where I am from we cheerfully call the queer community) will accept that I’m part of the group even if I don’t have to out myself and specify how. I also just pose as an ally a lot because in non-queer circumstances it has ‘more power’."

You don’t need to visit home just because she is your mother. You are allowed to tell her “No, you can’t talk to me that way and you can’t blame your problems on me.” 

I also have a friend-relationship with my mother, it’s been this way as long as i can remember, and even though we still have issues every once in a while, creating firm boundaries in my relationship to her has been the best move.

It is really hard to do, but she knows that if she flips out on me I will end communication with her. If she is rude, or mean I tell her as gently as I can that her behavior is toxic and why (so she can understand what she did wrong) and I tell her I’m going to take space until I’m ready to talk to her again. Sometimes I have to block her number; and sometimes it is weeks before I talk to her again.

This really works for me and our relationship is the most stable/the best it has ever been. However, this all depends on whether your mom values your relationship enough that cutting off contact motivates her to be better.

If she really wants a restaurant, why doesn’t she work for one first? 

Aside from the financials, restaurant culture is largely toxic. Does she have the personality type where she can handle constant on the spot pressure and many moving parts? Drama, drinkin and drugs? Does she want to be the ‘chef’? 

Maybe the real issue is that she doesn’t feel supported. Maybe the real issue is that she is throwing a tantrum because she is not getting what she wants. 
I suggest talking to her and telling her you support her dreams but when it comes to real life, concrete plans (business plans, getting a job to get experience in the industry, etc) are easier to support and show you’re serious."

My boyfriend is really into watching Chinese cooking videos and he shows me all kinds of incredible traditional cooking methods I would never see.  I can ask him but I’m pretty sure you can just search Chinese cooking on YouTube and fall down that hole forever!"

It depends on how clingy you actually are, and how your new boyfriend is reacting to you. 

I remember when I (27F) was 16 and I was making my boyfriend (20M) feel smothered because I was “clingy” I decided fine, I was going to spend my time doing other things and sometimes passive aggressively waiting extra time to respond to his texts. That worked out really well for me because at first he liked the “freedom” and then he became insecure that I was beginning to lose interest. However, that was a very unhealthy relationship in general, not just my petty behavior in this instance. 

I think you should try to focus on loving yourself and finding your own security outside of a relationship. If he’s being mean to you, you should definitely break up with him but if he treats you with respect and you feel good; maybe just pull back a little bit on the relationship and make art instead. Or hike in your area and learn about the trails, or write stories or write your feelings down."

Being excluded is not ok. Being excluded by your whole class and your teacher as well? Unacceptable bullying. 

You are protecting your daughter and you are showing her that she matters by fighting for her. You should report the teacher and counselor to the superintendent."
