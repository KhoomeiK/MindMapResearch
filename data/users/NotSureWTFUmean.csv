You want to eat stuff that gives you good solid logs, but also practice pinching them into pellets as they exit your sphincter. It's harder than it sounds, as anyone who's ever tried to pinch a loaf can tell you. Then you simply roll them into little balls with your hands like playdough. You remember doing that when you were a kid right? Same idea, except you're grabbing them live as they come out. It's just easier if you skip wearing pants altogether. Public parks near schools are a good place to practice until you get good at it, then the possibilities are endless~~

> Instead, they were often humiliated, degraded, and made to feel like  failures. They felt embarrassed of their time as soldiers, because they  felt like they didn't do anything to make themselves proud. 

Definitely a failure of leadership happening there. A good unit will be very effective and rebuilding a soldier's confidence and pride after the initial recruit phase of breaking them down out of their old civilian ways. Training a soldier to the point where they achieve a posting in a highly sought after elite unit and then telling them they're still worthless lizards would be incredibly stupid and counter productive.

> Now what do you think that does to the mental health of his men when  their leader thinks they are disposable and doesn't care about them? Its  emotionally crippling. 

Very much so! People really underestimate how much an impact leader behavior towards subordinates has in already extremely challenging circumstances. You can really see spikes in the number of people who hammer in with mental illnesses when they're already near their limit and then the bosses drop massive fuck-you decisions or policy changes on everyone. Sometimes just even having a really fucking awesome direct supervisor who really goes the extra mile for his troops during shitty situations above his pay grade to control can make a ton of difference. The best boss I ever had was incredibly skilled, smart, and had a huge reputation for disobeying orders from his own superiors in order to get perks for his platoon. All the other platoons resented us, yet everyone wanted in our platoon lol. Many years later he retired at the peak level he could possibly get to in his field and is currently sitting in a $900k house with his family. Not bad for an NCO pension!

It's a dickhead conservative invention by wealthy people who historically prefer to screw over workers so they can point to it for years and say ""See?? Need to make some cuts here!"" Let's put every OPC MPP salary on there and see how they like that. The Government of Ontario also employs private fee for service workers / contractors / consultants to augment its workforce. Fee For Service Consultants perform  the same duties as their Public Service counterparts but are paid far more yet their billings are largely hidden from easy public view and scrutiny.

 It has nothing to do with transparency and everything to do with making well-paid, hard-working leaders within Ontario’s public sector wince at the publication of their income. It’s a political farce perpetrated for no other reason than to give the governors the ignominious reputation that they’re taking care of business on behalf of others taking care of business. Not to mention a blatant invasion of privacy."

A friend of mine used to be Toronto police ETF and one of the easiest ways to yank his chain was to constantly go on about how cool JTF2 are. He was always bitching and jealous of the toys and training they get to play with compared to the cops. All I had to do was start a sentence with ""Yeah but JTF2"" and he'd start lol"

I feel bad for teachers because people guilt trip them if they mention the word ""raise"" because of all the jackwads out there saying ""naawww F them teachers, they rich and have too many holidays"" rather than ""Ford is a liar"" which would be a more accurate response."

For even more speed install a Magnaflow muffler, a custom grille cover, wide stance spacers, and a lift kit. Then paint the whole thing black monotone with black rims because everybody knows blacked out pickups are unique and original"

HomeImprovement,feyftxo,t3_eqlpr8,1579444935.0,"I used to be in a similar situation and just did a quick easy fix. I bought one of those metal roof gazebos that came with detachable sliding canvass curtains and just kept the side facing them closed. Looks like you can setup a totally private run from your doorway to the gazebo without even seeing them judging by your photos. But to make it perfect, I would buy more paver stones and widen that walkway into a bigger patio to put it on"

A nice neighbor helped us, so I saw a young dude struggling to get up the street and tried to pay it forward. As I got alongside his car (young guy with no snow tires, shocker!) he cracked the window and I said ""I'm almost afraid to ask how far you have to go!"" He replied, ""all the way to the top of the street"" and we both burst out laughing because we both knew there was no way I'd be able to push him that far"
homeowners,fey9ccu,t3_eqq2ik,1579442446.0,"You have house stress/anxiety on some level by the sounds of it. Been there done that, and it's something that creeps up on you steadily the more things that break with your house. You start developing a feeling of dread imagining what the next stressful and costly repair might be. Your description of bats and septic leads me to believe you're in an older somewhat rural house? I was as well, and yes, there are a lot of things that can and will need maintenance. The question you need to ask yourself is are you financially and mentally prepared to handle them if/when they do? The answer for me eventually became no which is why I'm now living in a newer house on a smaller property and back on municipal utilities rather than a well, septic. 

You can only answer to your situation though as mine could be quite different. My last house was a 70's fixer-upper that I had spent tens of thousands on bringing up to proper standards both cosmetically, mechanically, along with a fair number of expensive surprises along the way. We were tapped out and gong into the red after being there about 5 years. In 5 more years we were looking at having to start another cycle of expenses: roof, siding, driveway, furnace, AC.  That's why we realized we weren't equipped to stay there anymore. My house stress here after 2 months and taking care of a few relatively small ticket touch-ups has dropped significantly. I rather enjoyed only taking 30 minutes to clean up yesterday's big snowfall rather than 1.5 hours too lol."

Even so, I find no fault with any profession that wants to be paid fair wages for their level of qualifications, training, duties, and responsibilities. It shouldn't be a zero sum argument"
