Look at all the good post facto rationalizations I have for doing shitty things!

In fact, I’m the victim.  Of society.  Of the system.  Of faceless, unknowable cabals and corporate entities.   They’re the reason I can’t be held responsible for the real time consequences of my actions.  Blame the LLC not the actual person actually doing the actual harm.  

If a decision is a net gain for me personally, but a net loss for the system as a whole, it’s only right and proper that I do what’s best for me as an individual organism.  I would be foolish not to! 

What am I supposed to do?  Chose the harder right over the easier wrong?!?  Should we all just use our thinky-meat and the magic data transmitters in our faces to organize socially optimal solutions to the prisoner dilemma?  No!  I demand Nash equilibrium.  Everyone must loose to ensure I don’t get fucked. “

Warren might be a standard piece of shit politician.  But people can be pieces of shit and still good at their jobs.  Hypothetical:  you have a chest wound.  Your standing in front of a hospital.  The surgeon in the doorway is a complete piece of shit.  Your polar moral opposite.  Still a surgeon, but a terrible person nonetheless.  He says you need surgery.  Outside is a kiosk.   The man who runs it is telling you that you don’t need surgery for your chest wound.  All you really need is this crystal that he *just* so happens to sell.  And whaddayaknow...  he’ll throw in a discount.  He knows he’s overselling the product, and thrashing you on the price. He’s also a piece of shit.

Now you have two morally indefensible men; one selling medical treatment, one selling a crystal.  They’re both poised to profit from your misfortune.  They’re both going to rip you off...  but one of them will actually do something besides take your money.  Warrens your surgeon.
