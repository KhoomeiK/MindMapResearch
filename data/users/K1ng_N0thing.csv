I have a number of medical problems I'd like to get checked out but I won't. The potential of doctors finding ""something"" that requires hospitalization or surgery is too paralyzing terryfing to do anything.

I would rather die than go into more debt. I *will* die before it happens."
television,ffc95jo,t1_ffc1efi,1579794382.0,"Democrats think Republicans are blocking witnesses to protect Trump.

Republicans have repeatedly said the impeachment process is a sham and they'll do everything they can do stop it.

Paying attention is going to make Democrats feel like they're right, so they're disenfranchised when they think Trump will just be protected and then eventually is. 

I would bet a paycheck that no Trump supporter is viewing this process and having their mind changed. 

The scenario of this person sitting at home alone and saying ""Oh shit, he really might have done this..."" doesn't exist.

And I think this issue is exaserbated by the fact that an aging population can make policy decisions that have effects long after their passing.

But there's no good solution here. If a person isn't expected to love another ten years, I don't think they should get to influence the next twenty years of the world.

That said, they're still here now, so how much influence can they fairly maintain?

Guy dated a girl and was a relationship chameleon. He became super religious within a month.

After this, he found new opionins on homosexuality.

It's a sin, it's wrong, they're going to Hell.

He would ""tolerate"" gay people, but also had to smugly remind them of their impending dammation.

What my friend couldn't know at the time, is that his father was waiting until his son graduated college for him to come out of the closet.

His father always wanted a family, and lied about himself to make that happen.
