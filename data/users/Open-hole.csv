depression,fdh99xc,t3_elcim1,1578418151.0,"Same. If I get a Snapchat message, for instance, I'll go like 18 hours before I open it because I'm worried it'll say something I don't want to hear. I hate phone calls. Most people don't understand. I guess I just don't want to deal with any more embarrassment or pressure

Also I usually time when I leave the house to be when there's the least amount of people around. I don't want to see people I recognize who may judge me for some unknown reason.
