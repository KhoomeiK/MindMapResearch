One time there was a stack of returns behind the counter with Final Fantasy 2 (SNES American version) that I wanted to rent so bad in it.  I asked him if I could rent that one and he just said ""no, those returns haven't been keyed in yet"" really shitty to me.  Pressed further and he hit me with ""you want to rent anything at all?!"" like he was threatening to not let me rent any games again.

I was a kid so I just kind of dealt with it.  Then as a teenager when his business had signs up getting ready to close I could only thing ""Good, fuck that guy."" and loved it.  Anyone who acts like they're doing their customers a favor by existing can piss off.  Especially if they're mean to kids just because they know they can be.

He was an asshole because he had a monopoly on renting in our town (no Blockbuster within probably 30 minutes) and knew he could get away with it.  My heart sang when his business went under probably ten years before he was planning to retire and he had to re-enter the workforce.
