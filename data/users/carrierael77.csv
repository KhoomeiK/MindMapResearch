insaneparents,ffjobd9,t1_ffilxg5,1580002894.0,"Well DUH. However you guys must have never been to the point with your kids where you are like ""I will take EVERYTHING!"". Luckily I haven't had to with my teenage son yet, but my mom did to all of us. We quickly learned the difference between necessity and luxury.   

Many on this sub are kids bitching about shit that they seem to think is a fucking right. As an adult I can read between the lines on this one. Mom is 37, sister is 16 so OP is young. Mom probably took away some luxuries and they are doing the ""that's not fair"" teenage reaction. Depends on what 16 year old did, but if it was severe enough, damn right take that shit away.

My mom would always say ""who the hell is that lady"" and ramble about hanger on'ers. 

Well, my mom passed in 2006 and never go to enjoy RHOBH, but imagine my surprise when air watched, and there was that lady, still starving for attention.

raidsecrets,ff1yz0r,t1_ff1xnrs,1579489435.0,"Sorry that was half a thought. So that is part one. 

Well some of the floor images people are getting in the emblem room have a blank big hexagon and some have symbols.  You will also notice that the big hexagon has a blue line around it, sometimes with a space on it. This is important later. 

Once the pieces are all matched up according to side symbols and the board is complete we start figuring out a path. 

1. Blank in the middle spaces mean nothing. They are just fillers that help create the path. 
2. The blue edge around the big hexagon in the middle...those are walls. So a space in that blue line is basically a door. Like a maze, you cant go thru walls and must use doorways. 
3. As you know from doing the other puzzles, you go in a corridor to a room and have to go to another door based on a symbol. This map is how we know what door to take. 

Soooo if you start at the spot on the map with the bright yellow edge (top of map middle left)  your first doorway to go thru is going to be ""diamond"". Those first 4 spots are blank...just pathway.  

There are few spots left, but if you figure there are 6 options of symbols for each of those spots it could have a big impact on the path. 

So here we are."
raidsecrets,ff1xnrs,t1_ff1rrmx,1579488530.0,"So I think I finally understand  let me see if I can help. 

Okay, when you get to the emblem room at the floor you see a hexagon with several little bunches of hexagons with symbols around it. Think of that as a  match game. So in order to place a piece you have to have the ones next to them match. 

Lets pretend: Look at your image on the floor. The bunch of small hexagons in the 10 o clock position is Plus, snake, diamond, diamond, plus.  Well someone needs to have that same thing match for them to be touching. So, you submit a pic of your emblem floor and others do as well. The team is sifting thru all the images submitted and  matching. 

The challenge is getting pieces that match sides all around."

Why are we seeing a link for the ""latest"" when there is new info available? Not to sound bitchy, but it was all of ours screen grabs etc that got us to this point."
