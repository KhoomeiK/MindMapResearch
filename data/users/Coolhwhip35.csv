AskReddit,fcdlnfg,t3_egwusn,1577611168.0,"My dad died in 2008. His own mother said, I'm sorry. (Granted she hadn't seen him me for a significant amount of time.) Despite that, there really isn't much to say. Once a person is gone, they (and i highly) doubt give two fucks about anyone still living. I have had astral projection experiences, and i have to admit, it was fantastic. (I'd assume this is why people in comas do not wake.)"
