I tried to keep the melee spellcaster without wildshape feel from the original but made it more about draining and redistributing hit points since it seemed more fungus-like.

They can effect mood, appetite, energy levels, and more. The appendix essentially regulates those bacterial populations and refreshes them if something happens that causes a certain population to die off. So having your appendix out isn't really going to immediately effect you but if something happens that tips the balance of microbes then it can be harder for you to recover without outside intervention. This isn't that big a deal as long as you take probiotics and add foods rich in beneficial microbes like sauerkraut and yogurt to your diet."

This seems extra likely with how far along the plans for Trump Tower Moscow were and how he had basically no plan for a transition until literally the very last possible minute, plus there's that footage of him looking downright upset when it was announced that he won.

It was a win-win for Russia either way.
