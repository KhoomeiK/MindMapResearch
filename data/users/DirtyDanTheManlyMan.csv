todayilearned,ffax7pu,t1_ffavuz8,1579746586.0,"I don’t think it’s called terrorism if two countries are at war with each other, it’s just an attack. Also not sure why you think the pilot who flew the plane was the guy who invented and built atomic weaponry, it took a very large group effort to make the A-Bomb. He signed up to be a pilot and sometime later he was chosen by his higher ups to be the man to do the job. Fun fact about war, the people on the ground fighting really don’t want to fight, it’s the higher ups who make this decision, and those high ranking members either already fought many years ago, or didn’t fight at all. They can also punish you for refusing to follow orders, so as a soldier it’s in your best interest to shut up and follow orders."
wikipedia,ff6eume,t1_ff6e1p6,1579625665.0,"I’m not going to argue with someone who is okay with planting literal death traps to kill people who are trying to do their job. The working man does not make the decision to cut the tree, someone way higher in the company is making that decision. And that CEO or whatever will probably never go out and actually cut down a tree. If you think murder is the answer, go buy a gun and hunt down the heads of these companies. Or just get off the internet and go plant some trees if you love the planet so damn much. Pick up some litter off the street."
wikipedia,ff69pqb,t1_ff613bd,1579622412.0,"Don’t spike trees, you can seriously injure or kill a lumberjack. 9 times out of 10, said lumberjack is just a regular person who needed a job and happened to have skills relevant to cutting trees down, they don’t hate the environment. If you really must ruin trees for lumber companies, I’m pretty sure there’s a paint you can spray on a tree that renders it useless for commercial lumber uses, and all it does it make the tree a new color. No chance of killing an innocent guy."
