For those who are unaware, a deranged leftist private messaged me a homicidal rant where he bragged about murdering 11 elderly Trump voters in his care at a medical facility. He did this out of nowhere because he was angered by a meme that I posted which the mods stickied here. I saw that his account was old and had a lot of activity (not a fake troll account made minutes ago) and it was full of anti-Trump and anti-white rants and calls to violence. So I exposed the message, shared it around and eventually his real identity and employer were discovered. It turns out he DOES work for a medical facility, making his claims of murder via malpractice even more plausible.

His employer (and the FBI) are apparently investigating now, but it has been 48 hours with no updates from the employer or anyone else. Could you imagine if the tables were turned and a white doctor publicly fantasized about (or actually did) murder 11 black patients in his care to stop them from voting Democrat?

DO NOT LET THIS MEMORY HOLE. Please demand answers and share the story with non-leftist media. Infowars and the National File have already covered it, various people have shared it on Twitter including Stefan Molyneux, Ann Coulter and others. But the left wants to wait this story out and let it memory hole. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN!
