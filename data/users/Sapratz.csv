Generally speaking though, i would echo what the other person said about ""why do you want a working dog?""

It appears the puppies they are marketing are NOT housepet drives, so i would reach out and make it very clear that you are interested in a low drive dog or your house will be destroyed in short order and you will have a dog that attacks children, bites at dogs running for fetch at a park, and generally will not make your life better.

Dogtraining,fffzj1m,t1_fffrtrr,1579895212.0,"is it nipping or mouthing?

Generally nipping is a problem at 1 year, they can actually do damage to someone... but mouthing isn't really a big deal. If your dog is just putting people's hands in her mouth, that's just mouthing. I wouldn't be too concerned unless she is causing pain. Are your ""uncomfortable"" friends inviting your dog and putting their hands near her face? What are they doing when she mouths? Are they just around her? Some dogs will mouth as a precursor to biting, but normally any average dog owner can recognize the difference between that kind of mouthing and a play mouthing. Like if your dog is on their back and someone is rubbing their belly and your dog is mouthing you a little more intensely, maybe you should stop, etc.

If you want to stop it, teach her an out command, or disengage whenever your dog mouths someone/you. It needs to be consistent though, everyone should do this (at least to start).

If she is nipping, that's a little different..."

Pay attention to activity levels before and after eating. Stress/excitement can also cause throwing up. Also, some dogs will throw up stomach bile if they are not following a strict eating timeline, as well as the type of food that they are eating. If your dog is throwing up in the morning, perhaps there is too long of a period between the last meal of the day and the first meal of the day. If your dog is throwing up stomach bile, it is likely that your dog is throwing up on an empty stomach, which leads me to believe this."

dogs,ffckp9k,t3_essepy,1579801516.0,"I'd buy some dog asprin and give it shortly before the hike and keep it active until the next morning. That's depending on your dog's ability to do this distance. Generally, if the trail has large gravel or stones, I would bring dog shoes to protect the feet in this scenario. A cut pad is a pretty annoying thing to deal with on a multi-mile hike. 2 boots is good, I would have 4. Backpacking medical kit is nice to have.

Another thing that I don't enjoy dealing with- poo bags with poo in them. You will have to store and carry these for a distance most likely. there's always the double bag and jam-in-your-pack technique, but if it's a shorter hike, I'll bring a throw-away tupperware to hold them. so they don't break open or ""pop"" in the pack.

If you want to save some space in the future, I use shake bottles for water storage (with carabiner), and then the lid of the shake bottle holds enough water to be a ""bowl"".

If there is greater than a 5% chance you are out past dark (it gets dark EARLY anymore), I would bring a light to attach to your dog's collar, or have a lighted collar/harness.

I don't imagine a day-hike is a situation where this is necessary (and depending on your jurisdiction this may not be allowed), but if there is a chance of running into a bear, feline predator, or other large animal, I carry bear spray (if allowed in that park/hike). ""but black bears always run away!"" people say... well, when you have a dog, your dog might decide to engage that black bear. I'll just spray both if something happens. again, this is probably completely unnecessary, but if your dog is strong and you might have a hard time handling your dog while immensely excited, and bears are a possibility, something to think about."

Usually when a dog win's in a tug, they will take like a ""victory lap"" and then lie down and start to tear apart the prey. This is a feature of a dog with high prey drive, and very common. The fact that your dog loves balls also lead me to believe that he is a high prey drive dog. This can be 'un-done', but generally I think it's ill-advised to try to eliminate an instinctual activity altogether unless it's causing serious problems.

If you need to find the dog, you might be able to contact the issuing authority for dog licenses in the area. Many municipalities require owners to register their dogs, and keep a database on the breed/owner address/etc. Obviously this would only be useful if the person had registered their dog, which may not be the case. This would also only work if you knew the breed of the dog. Maybe it can at least narrow it down. Mention it's for a report of bite and they will likely be more amenable to work with you.

An animal control officer might take the case- its not your job to go around sleuthing for vicious dogs after all..

I can release by either giving the reward sound (verbal ""yes""), or I can say ""free"". ""free"" is a general release word for everything: leaving the kennel, getting out of the car, out of a stay, into a park, out of a heel, etc. I train an ""implied stay"" in a sit, down, stand, front, and recall. This is good because when I say sit to my dog, I nearly always want a ""sit-stay"" anyways. If I want a sit for a second, I'll give sit and then a free. I think people who don't train an implied stay are looking at sit as a ""trick"" and not a utility action. How often do you want your dog to just touch their but to the floor for a split second anyways? You can easily transition your dog to an implied stay with a little work. 

If I'm at home, I have a ""lie down"" command which is an ""optional"" command without an implied stay.

dogs,ffckp9k,t3_essepy,1579801516.0,"I'd buy some dog asprin and give it shortly before the hike and keep it active until the next morning. That's depending on your dog's ability to do this distance. Generally, if the trail has large gravel or stones, I would bring dog shoes to protect the feet in this scenario. A cut pad is a pretty annoying thing to deal with on a multi-mile hike. 2 boots is good, I would have 4. Backpacking medical kit is nice to have.

Another thing that I don't enjoy dealing with- poo bags with poo in them. You will have to store and carry these for a distance most likely. there's always the double bag and jam-in-your-pack technique, but if it's a shorter hike, I'll bring a throw-away tupperware to hold them. so they don't break open or ""pop"" in the pack.

If you want to save some space in the future, I use shake bottles for water storage (with carabiner), and then the lid of the shake bottle holds enough water to be a ""bowl"".

If there is greater than a 5% chance you are out past dark (it gets dark EARLY anymore), I would bring a light to attach to your dog's collar, or have a lighted collar/harness.

I don't imagine a day-hike is a situation where this is necessary (and depending on your jurisdiction this may not be allowed), but if there is a chance of running into a bear, feline predator, or other large animal, I carry bear spray (if allowed in that park/hike). ""but black bears always run away!"" people say... well, when you have a dog, your dog might decide to engage that black bear. I'll just spray both if something happens. again, this is probably completely unnecessary, but if your dog is strong and you might have a hard time handling your dog while immensely excited, and bears are a possibility, something to think about."

If you need to find the dog, you might be able to contact the issuing authority for dog licenses in the area. Many municipalities require owners to register their dogs, and keep a database on the breed/owner address/etc. Obviously this would only be useful if the person had registered their dog, which may not be the case. This would also only work if you knew the breed of the dog. Maybe it can at least narrow it down. Mention it's for a report of bite and they will likely be more amenable to work with you.

An animal control officer might take the case- its not your job to go around sleuthing for vicious dogs after all..

I can release by either giving the reward sound (verbal ""yes""), or I can say ""free"". ""free"" is a general release word for everything: leaving the kennel, getting out of the car, out of a stay, into a park, out of a heel, etc. I train an ""implied stay"" in a sit, down, stand, front, and recall. This is good because when I say sit to my dog, I nearly always want a ""sit-stay"" anyways. If I want a sit for a second, I'll give sit and then a free. I think people who don't train an implied stay are looking at sit as a ""trick"" and not a utility action. How often do you want your dog to just touch their but to the floor for a split second anyways? You can easily transition your dog to an implied stay with a little work. 

If I'm at home, I have a ""lie down"" command which is an ""optional"" command without an implied stay.

I would state that anything post-1980s is definitely in support of the second amendment, but it appears you refuse to acknowledge the political landscape presently. The NRA definitely has the second amendment in mind. There is a lot of politicking that goes on behind the scenes that requires the NRA to make concessions to stay a power player in Washington.

dogs,fe9itom,t1_fe595u8,1578937866.0,"\>  Positive-reinforcement training is about *teaching* what is acceptable, rather than just *telling what is wrong*. Does that make sense? 

&#x200B;

This is incorrect, positive-reinforcement training is just a different way of \*how\* you teach. Sure, there are idiots out there who would just kick the dog for eating out of the wrong bowl. This isn't ""balanced"" training, that is abusive, and bad training. You are improperly conveying a false dichotomy between what is positive only and shitting balanced training.

A standard balanced trainer is also teaching what is acceptable as well as telling the dog what is incorrect, just using an aversion during the incorrect behavior and a reward during the correct behavior.

Also, please link me to studies that you are referring to? Many of the studies I find only talk about stress and aggression (which isn't shocking when ""balanced"" training is typically someone who is just abusing their dog under that term). I would like to read any study about ""reliability"" of commands and how they are testing that."

Or just lure and press gently on his outer hip and get him to go down. If he's fighting it, then stop, but some dogs just need a little more guidance and once you do that it might immediately just click."

Dogtraining,fe8y6xc,t3_enzyix,1578932276.0,"It depends what you mean by ""learned""... It's not particularly challenging to teach these things in a short period, the dog will usually respond pretty fast with treats and manipulation. The challenge is generalization (will she still remember these commands in the front yard), reliability (will she sit in the middle of a sidewalk with people walking by?), and removing the treats/hand signals/manipulations.

If you are able to not show a treat and just stand there and say sit and your dog does it- that's really fast and very impressive. If you are manipulating your dog with the treat- less impressive.

Still good though! Just don't get complacent. I still am unhappy with my dog's sit or down or heel or shake and he's nearly 2. You have to work on this forever! that's the biggest failure of a dog owner IMO, just ""stopping"" because you are satisfied..."
