While white AF and born in France, I was from the working class, and although I went to a prestigious public university, I always felt I would never be quite part of the privileged circle of people I studied and then worked with - those who had a particle in their names or whose father went to a top engineering or business school and had an estate and old friends in high places.

Emigrated to the U.S. for a job and over here I never felt that way here. There are different social circles, that's for sure. But none that you wouldn't be welcome in would you prove yourself. Now granted, I'm in California, and I know New England, for instance, is a different story. Still though - I feel like this is much more of a meritocracy, as much of a cliché as it sounds.

I also know that my peculiar path would have never been possible in Europe. I know the paths of many (some very successful) people I meet here would also have been impossible over there."
