norge,fflnagz,t1_ffldwxd,1580041753.0,"How can mothers take responsibility for what they ingest when they are not properly informed of the risks associated with eating salmon? It’s aggressively marketed as healthy and natural, a great source of omega 3 fatty acids which are highly beneficial for the development of the child’s brain etc. what’s NOT being communicated is that the amount of environmental pollutants embedded in the meat/fat is high enough to potentially offset any beneficial effects and might even be downright detrimental if consumed in large quantities. So simply lobbing the responsibility of staying informed on the individual mothers is irresponsible in the face of the billion dollar industry salmon farming represents and their aggressive marketing emphasizing its “health” properties. 
I eat farmed salmon myself, but it should be done in moderation and with a realistic view on what it entails. 
Thanks"
