toptalent,ff4ryro,t1_ff4ru0e,1579571012.0,Good to know. I knew that I had a chance of sarcasm getting lost but was totally surprised. Figured it was 50/50

bipolar,fe0312q,t1_fe008f6,1578801814.0,"I had to switch off of lamotrigine and they gave me Clonazepam to help me “function” in the interim, but I ended up skipping it most of the time because I was always too sedated. Fast forward trying to commit to it and still just sleeping all the time"
bipolar,fdzfkt1,t1_fdzfaic,1578789724.0,Am on .5 twice twice day with only 450mg lithium
bipolar,fdzc91f,t1_fdzc1so,1578788765.0,Not really. I had to discontinue Lamictal and it was supposed to be for anxiety to be used concurrently with lithium. I guess I don't have any anxiety when I'm sleeping...
DestinyTheGame,fdy1s0y,t3_en6lg5,1578775116.0,"The game has become a chore and I’m bored. I feel like I need to log on and at least finish the season pass but it’s not fun. As a result, I’ve set the controller down for a while."

personalfinance,fcwjdav,t3_eja2m7,1578027203.0,I don’t get why people buy Mac book pros for just web browsing and emails/writing paper. And I am a Mac user.
destiny2,fcli4ff,t3_ehtzqk,1577748326.0,"It used to be you would get it from Zavala as a titan.

Sounds like some RNG bad luck. I had a similar problem with Quickfang back in the day when I finished everything and didn’t get it for some reason. Look a year to get from a random world drop."
