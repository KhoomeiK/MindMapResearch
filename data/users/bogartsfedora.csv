Kittens are great but I wouldn't trade the pleasure of getting to know these older ladies and gentlemen for anything. And yes you may get less time to spend with them (though you don't know that!), and yes it is hard (lost my latest 23 days ago; RIP Oobatz, you magnificent bellyflop of joy), but better to have loved and lost than never to have met these delightful creatures at all."

news,fcmcb9y,t1_fcm30t4,1577770302.0,"THIS THIS THIS. My employer's currently in the process of annual reviews and my supervisor -- a good person but just another cog in the machine -- told me she was putting me up for a 4 (an Exceeds Expectations, on our 1-5 scale). I strenuously argued her out of it. The modified stack-ranking system our employer uses, combined with my supervisor's relative powerlessness, meant that I'd likely be shuffled down to a 3 -- no bonus or significant salary bump -- but I'd have a target on my back for next year. (It would also likely endanger the rest of my team in case they are getting 3's, as one suspects they are.)

She agreed, to my great relief. 

I did appreciate the thought, of course, but all I take away from the whole exchange is that I can maybe dial it back next year without worrying overmuch. Good to know."
