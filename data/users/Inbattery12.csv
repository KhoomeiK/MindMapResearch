I also don't think they sell on of their only popular strains, at a discount when its 18%.

I put in a boveda in til Friday. I'm excited for the weekend!

Edit: Two dabs in I have theory. Hexo intended to release vape pens. When the government blocked them hexo created these ounce products to quickly sell off the stocks they intended for vapes. I figure this could be a new unnamed strain for that reason.

Edit edit after 1 day with a boveda the dabs taste and look like lithium (the strain)."

aww,fdal5ra,t1_fd9xe5r,1578247313.0,"I have a semi feral rescue (feral father/domesticated mom) who is uber dog like. I was not a cat person. This cat rolls on her back for belly scratches and never claws, just stretches out and purs or licks my hands (mutual grooming, a bonding thing). She chases a ball and plays fetch, she became my cat because she was channeling dogs of my childhood.


But over the years I have realized that those traits we attribute to a dog are just a level of social intelligence that exists in many animals. Dogs are inherently social and seek out attention. But a cat isn't a social creature. It's a solitary obligate carnivore. So when a cat is affectionate, it's picking you.

My cat hides anytime a stranger comes in the house. After 5 regular visits she will poke her head out. When she's here with here regular humans she demands attention, play, is vocal, and always ready to wake up and roll on her back. She also handles out mouse problem.
