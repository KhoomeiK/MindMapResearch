Example  $4 call 1/31 and $4 put 1/31 

In this example you are saying I would loose twice? I thought the only way I could loose if the stock didn’t move because I would make money on the jump up and the slide down."

options,fffrbjk,t3_ete1j1,1579890104.0,"I wanted to protect my calls so I bought some puts. I was trying to make money on the dip. 

Overall strategy - I felt good about my $5 6/19 calls... saw it dip so I bought some puts to help protect and hopefully make some money in the short run. I noticed $4 calls 2/28 were discounted so I picked some up. 

Yes, I am newer to trading options and trying to learn."

RealEstate,fe5xxr9,t3_enwlxg,1578877418.0,"Step 1 : buy a house 

Step 2 : if your a first time home buyer you maybe be required to live in it for a period of time based on your state 

Question : do you want to just rent a room or rent the whole house?

Step 3 : I would speak to a management company or maybe real estate lawyer as you would need lease documents  and they can walk you through the process. Renting a property isn’t “easy money” and there are a lot of potential pit falls.. if you cover your behind.. you should be good and can be very profitable!! 

Always, screen your tenants (Background/credit). Make sure their salary is enough to pay rent.  

Tip : have some extra money on top of that in case of general house maintenance.


Good luck!"
