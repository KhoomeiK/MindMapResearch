TumblrInAction,feszfmk,t1_fesajb1,1579370448.0,"Nah, I feel it. I had a little bit of time rocking with them in recent years. That's pretty much why I joined. I had an absolutely rough time when it came to dating and getting women interested in me, so it was easier to give up than to continue trying. And their community consisted of a bunch of burned men who came from recent relationships/marriages that ended terribly. To me, their philosophy meant that they wanted to actually ""Go Their Own Way"" and have fun/live life **without needing a relationship to make it fulfilling.** It's insane how much brighter my days got after joining.

But the toxicity is pretty much the reason why my time with them was so short."

But earlier, scrolling through Twitter, I didn't know what was going on, and the first thing I saw was [Misayeon's tweet](https://twitter.com/misayeon/status/1212510261321641995?s=19) and I got really scared cuz I thought Momo had left the group or something. Lol"

That sends me back to being a freshman in high school, which was arguably the best year of my life. Nothing has come close. It was a much brighter time, there was a ton of people that I knew that I was able to interact with...

and I have never felt a love so strong for someone before. Ever.

This crush was **deep,** too. It lasted from the end of middle school to the end of high school, but this year/time frame in particular takes the cake. She always dropped hints that she may have felt the same way too, but... I never did anything about it. I never officially made a move. 

Knowing what I know now, if I could go back to that time, I would. Things would be different. 

I would want to experience what could have been, you know?"
