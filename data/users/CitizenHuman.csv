WalmartCelebrities,fedsn3z,t3_eolwwl,1579019032.0,"Hello, little man. Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you. See, I was a good friend of your dad’s. We were in that Spanish pit of hell together over five years. Hopefully, you’ll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Dad were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other. If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talking right now to my son Jim. But the way it turned out is I’m talking to you, Butch. I got something for you.

This rosary I got here was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the Anglo-Spanish War. It was bought in a little general store in Sussex, England. Made by the first company to ever make rosaries. Up till then people just carried crosses. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge on the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-grandfather’s war rosary and he wore it every day he was in that war. When he had done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother, took the rosary off, put it an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed until your granddad Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Spanish once again. This time they called it The Thirty Years' War. Your great-grandfather gave this rosary to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane’s luck wasn’t as good as his old man’s. Dane was a mariner and he was killed, along with the other mariners at The Battle of Dessau Bridge. Your granddad was facing death, he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive. So three days before the Germans took the land, your granddad asked a cannonier on a Royal transport name of Wincock, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he’d never seen in the flesh, his gold rosary. Three days later, your granddad was dead. But Wincock kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his dad’s gold rosary.

This rosary. This rosary was on your daddy’s wrist when he was sunk in Spanish waters. He was captured, put in a Spanish prison camp. He knew if the heretics ever saw the rosary it’d be confiscated, taken away. The way your dad looked at it, that rosary was your birthright. He’d be damned if any heathens were gonna put their greasy hands on his boy’s birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something. His ass. Five long years, he wore this rosary up his ass. Then he died of dysentery, he gave me the rosary. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal and wood up my ass two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the rosary to you."
