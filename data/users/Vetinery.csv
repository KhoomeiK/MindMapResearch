politics,fffmgw7,t3_eta04x,1579887131.0,"If you look at this from the outside, the best possible outcome for the republican party would be for Donald Trump to “resign in order to spend more time with his family.”  Trump voters are not going to switch to Democrat if he resigns.  Likely quite the opposite, you could spin it as “they hounded him out of office”.  What I think Republicans are hoping for is that the Democrats will put forward someone grossly unacceptable to 1/2 the population.  This is how Trump got in the White House in the first place."

I’m not saying you can’t tax, I’m saying there is a reality that the US is kind of, sort of back up to four car makers and might be able to put people on the space station again.  (Will be nice not to have to beg Putin for access).  Just keep in mind, too much hostility and you get the economic model you see in the third world and China.  Make your money and get out.

JoeRogan,ffao0k5,t3_esgapt,1579740447.0,"Where Gabbard and Sanders are problematic in the foreign policy area is that both are very openly pacifist.  Where this becomes a difficulty is that this is exactly how we got into World War II.  Hitler did not believe that France and England would actually stand up for Poland. The Japanese believed that one decisive victory would cause the US to abandon the Pacific.  As often happens, neither Germany nor Japan got the war they wanted.  Having the expansionist powers of China and Russia thinking they can take whatever they want is a great way to end up in a war.  And even better example might be Khrushchev’s lack of respect for Kennedy."

AskReddit,ff9qv8t,t3_es8f05,1579719018.0,"Everything always comes down to,and has come down to, technology versus population. As animals, our ancestors survived by foraging and when we got too numerous, the tribe would split up.  Too many tribes in an area? We would fight and kill our neighbours.  When we got fire and weapons, we without compete other predators and the population grew.  Agriculture, huge population explosion.  As we’ve gotten better at things more of us of been able to survive the population has kept going up. Now, we are beyond the level of sustainability (so I’m told) and either we’re going to develop some really kick ass technology or there’s going to be a culling.  With a population of eight billion, If we went back to hunter gatherer technology, the planet would be stripped bare in about a month.  Unfortunately, the second half of the 20th century was greatly wasted because Eastern Europe and much of Asia were basically taken out of the equation of technological progress.  The vast amount of technological development came only from North America and Western Europe.  (Yes, I know, something important came out of Japan and South Africa, but mostly)
All of the problems are solvable, the issue is often letting people solve them.  The danger I see right now is people panicking and moving towards political systems that don’t reward innovation.  South Korea has problems but is building electric cars.  North Korea was the rich industrial part of Korea and now has a severe deforestation issue because people burn wood to survive.  Policy does matter."

He gets four years, spends a lot of money, and then everything gets reversed.  The wild swings in policy are adding greatly to the risk of investing in the US.  US Americans might not know, but car makers (just an example) have been nationalized in other places (times).   This guy just put one more negative into every investment decision of every ISP in the US.  Simple question, is this making you likely to put your retirement savings into the industry?  I don’t think it’s actually going to happen, but making it a campaign promise is going to curtail some investment and some people are going to have to wait a little longer for that new cable and faster/cheaper service.  To give some perspective, years ago I inquired about a T1 connection.  It was around $10,000.  That was the connection fee.  Anyone paying a connection fee lately?

In the end, it’s industry of some kind that pays for everything.  Flint did very well when the US was more competitive.  After World War II, the United States had almost a monopoly on heavy industry simply because they hadn’t been bombed.  After World War II, there was an extremely pervasive attitude that “we won the war so we deserve…” if you weren’t around in the 70s, it’s hard to imagine how hard North America got clobbered when Germany and Japan came back online.

europe,ff6cx2a,t1_ff5i6cc,1579624462.0,"Glad that was said.  China does have a point in that the Swedes did sell out generations of industrial development.  Sweden was an industrial power competitive per capita with Japan, Germany and the US.   Now, most of that is gone and even Volvo is controlled by Chinese interests.  China is doing a great job of economic warfare using it’s absolute authority over it’s economy to force economic growth and keep wage and benefits down.  China has basically no (as we know it) worker safety, pollution standards,  retirement plans, medical, unemployment benefits etc.  Real unions and labour protests are prohibited.  China is fueling growth by keeping standards, wages and benefits low and this is allowing them to buy out foreign companies which will then gives them technology and reduces their competition.  China loves socialism for everyone else, it makes acquiring their industry so much more affordable."

It’s extremely counter intuitive that your feelings are disconnected from your reality.  Feeling real chemical, clinical depression is like seeing colour, it’s extremely hard to adequately express.  It’s kind of like people around you don’t experience pain, and trying to explain what it is.  The idea of fear and sadness being completely real without a visible, explainable cause is  very hard to grasp."

Most people (myself included) didn’t get how much of a criminal empire the Soviet Union had become or how linked the official government and organized crime were.  In retrospect, everyone had to break rules to survive and get ahead.  Factories managers had to use the black market to keep running.

No one even remotely involved in construction could do business in New York without some connections, unless you believe union-mafia connections are just coincidence/anti-union conspiracies."

Evolution here: y’all can’t put your phones down, no way you can raise successful offspring.  On a serious note, I see a great business model where you provide workers with meals, 12 hours of entertainment and require four hours of work.  You simply turn off the entertainment for required meals, rest, hygiene and work.  Workers are required to adhere to the schedule for those four things and health checks etc.  This was actually the sort of system early socialist experimenters toyed with and the younger Marx and Engels experienced/studied."
