ABoringDystopia,ffxyez6,t1_ffwutqs,1580334873.0,"This needs to be the top comment. My bike was stolen last year. It was cheap; I could afford a new one. I would have been over the moon if someone had bought me a new bike because it was SO OBNOXIOUS to have to pay twice for the same thing. 

Edit - spelling."
EnglishLearning,ffxfwjl,t1_ffxalav,1580324334.0,"I'm a native speaker, and I also did not know this term. Thanks, haha!"
EnglishLearning,ffxajcj,t1_ffwa5es,1580321172.0,"I think the ""is"" applies to ""enough"". How many cakes is enough [cakes] for him? I agree that it sounds weird either way and would probably just use ""would be"" instead to avoid confusion."
EnglishLearning,ffx8xc9,t3_evn2a6,1580320212.0,"Another tip about infinitives: there is a (somewhat outdated) rule in English about separating the two words. For example, ""He seems to not have left the country"" would be considered less correct than ""He seems to have not left the country"" or ""He seems not to have left the country""."
EnglishLearning,ffx7sht,t3_evpg4k,1580319536.0,"I have had food that I might describe as breathtaking, but most native speakers would probably find that odd. Breathtaking generally describes sights, performances, or emotions that are particularly awe-inspiring or overwhelmingly beautiful.

It usually does not apply to tastes or, somewhat ironically, to smells."
bulletjournal,ffquzea,t1_ffqu95k,1580144244.0,"It's navy cardstock. I used the Tombow on a couple of other spreads for this month, and just had all the pens sitting there while I took pics."
cats,ffn3xsk,t1_ffmnc81,1580061796.0,He is weird. He's the only cat I have ever had that let me touch his feet. His sister HATES having her head/face touched at all.
cats,ffn3oqp,t1_ffm7s5s,1580061707.0,He is kinda crazy but we love him anyway lol
cats,ffn3ma6,t1_ffm7xid,1580061683.0,He is very much a combination of those two qualities.
bulletjournal,ffma220,t1_ffm9cgm,1580051215.0,Thank you! And happy real-cake-day!!
bulletjournal,ffm7hvu,t3_ettn1b,1580049755.0,"I am also trying a plotted tacker this month. Hopefully I will see some trends more clearly this way.

You should take a look at r/bujo. It's a bullet journal sub where productivity is the primary focus. You might find some useful inspo!"
bulletjournal,ffm5wfo,t1_ffk1o5t,1580049072.0,Thanks! It was very satisfying to do.
bulletjournal,ffm5ve9,t1_ffk2a90,1580049049.0,"Thanks! I have not posted this one on reddit before. Great minds must think alike, haha."
bujo,ffjwf1p,t3_etow8f,1580008796.0,I have used printables over 2 pages. I glued them in with the pages open flat and then intentionally creased the middle with my fingernail before closing. If you use thick paper this tends to damage your binding a bit.
bulletjournal,ffh299h,t3_etk36e,1579921161.0,"Sometimes it do just be like that. Your spread looks awesome, though! I love the whole aesthetic with the hearts."

WhitePeopleTwitter,feolhrg,t1_femxzr4,1579301849.0,"Channel 4 was the way, you Philistine."
flexitarian,fel0avp,t3_ep5f1o,1579211317.0,"I usually eat meat when I know I am going to be on the road, but I actually love McDonald's Southwest salad. Bonus: it is cheaper without the chicken."
bulletjournal,fekzuuo,t3_epj1q0,1579211053.0,I never thought of doing gingham...thank you for july inspo! Time for a summer picnic spread.
