fantasywriters,fdxje8w,t3_en8i60,1578769233.0,"Make the character witty, or give her a good sense of humor. Make her intelligent. Make her good looking. Make her courteous and polite whenever she's engaged in any dialogue with the main protagonists. Make her goals noble, but give her an ends-justify-means mindset. If you want, make it so that her perception of right and wrong gradually becomes more and more skewed as she does worse and worse things in the name of achieving her goal. Even better, give her a history with the main protagonist. Perhaps she was once a good friend, lover, maybe she's even actually a family member? That would be an interesting twist to reveal later on in the story.

Give her a backstory. You want the readers to be able to relate to what she's feeling, and understand why she's doing the things she's doing, even if they find those things abhorrent, or disturbing or just plain wrong."
