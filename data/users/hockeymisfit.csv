I don’t think that playing less physical will affect his scoring when he’s got one of the best passers in the sport on his line. Sure, he might not be scoring such flashy goals, but the chemistry between those two guys is something special. I’d love to see a more laid back, playmaking Ovie in the future.

Stance,feef1q5,t3_eooz6u,1579032425.0,"Sick shot man, the exposure is spot on. Have you put any thought in to picking up a polarizer? It makes a huge difference when it comes to reflections on the paint/glass."
modernwarfare,fedwyk1,t3_eok0cm,1579021645.0,"Have they still not fixed the launcher/killstreak bullshit where shooting down VTOLs and stuff don't count towards kill challenges? I haven't played in about a month, but as the guy that runs anti-killstreak loadouts, it's fucking infuriating that I all I get is 100 points for handicapping myself to help the team. My teammates cry that nobody is shooting down UAVs and VTOLs, but why should I take one for the team instead of just running cold blooded/ghost?"
modernwarfare,fedwd8s,t1_fedfu0a,1579021285.0,"I'd love to see FMJ nerfed in guns other than LMGs. I think that it's totally reasonable to be able to take down a UAV with 20-30 rounds if you're using an LMG, but it makes no sense with smaller caliber rounds. 

&#x200B;

There's nothing more annoying than switching to an anti-killstreak class to help my team out, fire off 20 rounds in to a VTOL only to have my teammate fire a single round from his M4 and steal the kill."

A quick, painless death is much better than slowly starving to death over a couple weeks. And apparently he's allergic to pineapple but had some in a can and ate it anyway."

fightporn,febhqfn,t3_eoceu9,1578958903.0,Thanks for all the compilations bro. Finally some shit that hasn't been reposted a thousand times. r/fightporn has been trash for so long and the mods don't know what the fuck they're doing. All the good stuff gets removed and the reposts always seem to make it to the front page.

My cousin accidentally hit a homeless man that was tripping balls and running around under a bridge. While she was at the hospital, the homeless man’s family tried to assault her too. It really messed her up for a while. 10 years later and she’s just feeling ok with driving again."

cars,fdu3vm4,t1_fdshl6y,1578727080.0,Got a ticket for “exhibition of speed” while driving back from lunch at work. I had just picked up like 6 bowls of soup for my coworkers and was doing 7 mph over the limit in a base Panamera... The cop threatened to impound the car and arrest me if my GM wasn’t there in 10 minutes to drive the car back and made me stand in the rain the entire time. All because my coworkers had been speeding through the area earlier in the day and he was waiting to pull over a Porsche.
