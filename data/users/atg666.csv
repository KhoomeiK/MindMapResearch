AskReddit,ff2qfjj,t1_ff2pt0a,1579519322.0,"In most of the developed and developing world, inflation increased at such a high rate, that salaries couldn't keep up. This caused the gap in purchasing power, between Boomers, who matured in the 60s or 70s, and Millenials, who matured in the 2000s.

Indian perspective: My grandfather built his home which cost him INR 250000 including land plot, in 1989. This was on a family income of 14000 bucks. The cost of living wasn't as high then, so they could save a lot. Today, in my lone salary, I cannot afford to purchase a flat in any semi urban area. That is because, good apartments today cost upwards of 5000000, in a semi urban neighborhood. That's about 20 times the price from 89. The salaries have not increased 20 times."

The only way to get out of depression, is to decide that you have had enough. Leave that shit behind you, and move on towards better days.

I was in such a place, and had to make drastic changes to my friend circle, thought process, and coping mechanism to get out of it. But I willed it into being, and here I am.

I recently had an AC unit installation done at my home, and the installer get his drill bit stuck in concrete while trying to drill through the wall, to pass the outdoor unit pipe and cable. He hammered it, and tried to pry it out, and his drill chuck kept slipping on the bit. After a while of their tinkering, I volunteered my tiny (by comparison of size and wattage) Bosch drill machine, and it managed to grip and pull the large bit out in 5 seconds."

Resistor is like a valve in a pipeline, which controls flow. So, increasing value of R, causes I to decrease, provided V remains constant (eq. 1 above).

So, we can say that the job / function of a resistor is mainly to control the current flowing through the circuit."
