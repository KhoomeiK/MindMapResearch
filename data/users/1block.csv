nfl,ffg55ov,t3_etbl95,1579898682.0,"If somehow the Saints were actually helping cover up abuse, that's horrible and should be dealt with quickly and brutally.

But that does not appear to be what this is about. It is about the diocese RELEASING the names of accused pedophiles and the Saints communications team giving them advice on ways to handle the negative publicity around that.

I can understand why they don't want emails released. The fact that this story is reacted to as ""Saints helped conceal sex abuse,"" rather than ""Saints helped Catholics deal with negative publicity after admitting abuse,"" shows that the public jumps to conclusions that aren't supported by the story."
nfl,ffg415d,t1_fffjpsq,1579897989.0,"Not necessarily. In any crisis, things are emailed back and forth that you wouldn't want public.

For instance, ""This is a prep document with the worst possible things people might say to us during this crisis and suggested ways to respond to those things.""

That would have some pretty bad stuff in it, and it's not concealing crimes to say ""we don't want that public."""
nfl,ffg3nfb,t1_fffb3gi,1579897751.0,"Apparently the Catholic diocese was releasing the names of pedophiles to the public, and the Saints helped them prepare for the expected bad publicity. It doesn't appear they were concealing sex crimes.

I'm Catholic, and my diocese did the same thing a couple years ago. Released a list of people they determined were credibly accused and said they turned all allegations over to the police.

It was part of a church effort to be more transparent. Some diocese were more transparent than others through the process. I don't know how forthcoming New Orleans was.

Whether it's appropriate for the Saints to assist the diocese in damage control, I don't know. I'm not sure how often owners use their team resources to help churches, charities or civic causes they support, particularly in PR work."
nfl,ffg2x25,t1_fff94ip,1579897300.0,To be fair it seems the Saints were helping the diocese prepare for the fallout of the diocese printing a list of credibly accused pedophiles. I don't think it was concealing the crimes but rather helping them manage the incoming negative publicity from exposing the crimes.

SouthDakota,fen0tb4,t1_fefrjse,1579274428.0,"I was more turned off by why it was on the ballot in the first place.

Voters passed IM 22, which was intended to overhaul campaign finance and other matters for elected officials. The legislature overturned a voter-approved law within days of convening, saying it was illegal (court hadn't established that, only that a lawsuit could proceed), and calling it an ""emergency.""

This law about out-of-state backers got on the ballot from lawmakers who don't want to deal with accountability. And the fact that it was obviously illegal - the courts have been clear that contributions are speech - is about the most hypocritical thing I've ever seen. ""YOUR MEASURE IS ILLEGAL, ACCORDING TO US! HERE'S A NEW MEASURE. IGNORE THAT IT'S ILLEGAL.""

People in South Dakota are the ones who vote, so they have the only say in the end. This law assumed we're sheep and are blindly misled into voting against our interests."

AskReddit,fdki5gr,t3_ell2h8,1578504328.0,"I've had trouble standing up to my mother. It's not even that she's a bad mom or mother in law. She is kind, caring, helpful and honestly tries to address any concerns my wife or I have. I just never set boundaries, and learning to do that is hard.

I'm an accommodater, ie I'm happiest when there's no drama and everyone I care about is happy. I spent a big part of my life managing other people's emotions, partly because I did that to my mom. I finally realized I didnt even know what I wanted in a given situation because I spent so much time figuring out what others wanted and how to provide it.

The big problem was when I got married, because now I had two women to keep happy, and they didn't always agree.

I think many husbands or wives married to people who grew up this way don't realize that it isnt just an issue of their spouse and the parent relationship. I accommodated my wife the same way as I did my mom, it just wasnt as much an issue for her because I was trying to make her happy.

Thankfully I have a wife who cares deeply about me, and she realized that I never stood up to her either, and as easy breezy as that may make the day, it also means she doesnt really know me, what I want.

Getting to the actual question of how do you deal with it: I became a more assertive person by being intentional about it. I learned to set boundaries. Well ... I'm still learning, but I'm heaps better.

The way I learned was by having an amazing wife who called me out all the time. ""I know you're not saying what you really think. Say it. I might get angry about it. Deal with it. I still love you.""

If there are any wives or husbands or partners reading this who are frustrated with their spouse, the best thing you can do is press them to set boundaries with you, the person they are safest with, so they learn how. It will suck, and they'll sometimes set crazy boundaries as they screw up along the way.

Don't treat them with kid gloves, though. If their feelings or boundaries frustrate you, let them know, but also make sure they know that the conflict doesn't change that you love them. Acknowledge and support the change they are trying to make and help them see opportunities to do it with their parents."

todayilearned,fdh0r5e,t1_fdgwkk0,1578412864.0,"He said they had a restoration business together, so those should be business assets. If she did the design side and he did the construction, she shouldnt get less just because construction equipment costs more.

Unless they split the revenue and he was paying for the equipment alone off his half while she kept more. I'd be surprised if that was the arrangement though.

Edit: re read and they were both avid home renovators, so maybe not a business.

So I guess it just depends how they budget. My wife and I just put our incomes into one account as a family budget. For the last 15 years, I've out earned her by a huge margin, including 6 years where she went back for a masters and built up hours for liscensure. If I treated everything we bought during that time as mine ... I just dont think that's marriage.

Went off on my own for business 6 months ago, and shes been carrying the load and probably will again this year. She doesnt act as if I owe her for this or act like I have less say in purchases. Just bought a tool cabinet for $1,000. She'll never use it, but it sure as hell is a shared asset. Her car is nicer than mine.
