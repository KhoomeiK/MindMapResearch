offmychest,fdtlff5,t1_fdtkujs,1578718458.0,It isa lot easier to fall asleep on the phone with your partner. I am a male 17 year old. And the police recently split us up. I havnt had a good night sleep in over a week. Because im not allowed to talk to her. I cant have that face time video that im use to. Sometimes people will swear over this and that but listen to your gut. You never met so you dont know if they truly want a relationship with you. You dont want a part time relationship i can see. But just surf your feelings and tell yourself how you truly feel about this guy. I tell myself every night how much i love my girlfriend. I kind of trust her she cheated 3 times in 9 months. Im still healing but everything does get better. Trust me.
offmychest,fdtdlaq,t3_emtutt,1578715237.0,Me and my “girlfriend im not sure if she still is fully in” do this every night. It find it sweet. I cant sleep when im not on facetime time with her.
