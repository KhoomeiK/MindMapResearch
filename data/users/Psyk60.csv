She's a teaching assistant in a school which is essentially a dumping ground for 16/17 year olds who failed all their exams. Some of them can't tell the time.

She said reluctance to hold children back in school is part of the problem. They just get further and further behind everyone else so they just give up trying to do anything.

There could be all sorts of reasons for it. Maybe higher property prices, higher wages, higher taxes. It could even just be a cultural difference. Maybe it's just that in the UK we see eating out as more of a treat than a basic service so we're willing to pay more.

explainlikeimfive,ff60hlk,t3_erv2m0,1579615962.0,"The US is a federation. That means it's made up of states, and power is shared between the federal government (the government of the country as a whole), and the governments of the states. 

The constitution says what things the federal government has jurisdiction over, and everything else is up to each individual state.

Many other countries are unitary states. That means there is a central government that can control laws across the entire country. Usually that means the whole country has the same laws, but even in a unitary state some areas might have an autonomous government which can make its own laws to some degree, or the central government decides to give different regions different laws for whatever reason.

The reason the US is a federation is because they were always distrustful of centralised power.

That's why hyrdoelectric power is. Water flows due to gravity, and we use that water to turn turbines, which generates electricity. Although the power isn't coming from the earth's core, it's ultimately coming from the sun.

If you release earlier, then you risk the competitor coming out with a better, more powerful console that blows yours away and people flock to it. Perhaps not buying your console because they're waiting for the better one.

Of course both of these could be an advantage. But if one company aims to release first, then the other will get wind of it and move their planned release back to stop them getting the advantage of being first.

However the British monarch is also the monarch of 15 other countries.

Yes. Mac used to have PowerPC CPUs instead of x86 based Intel ones. So you couldn't install Windows on a Mac, and Mac OS would fundamentally not work on a PC.

So back then Macs were PCs in the broad sense of being personal computers, but not PCs in the sense of being compatible with the hardware standards known as ""PC"". 

The PC platform was called that because it started with the ""IBM Personal Computer"". Then other manufacturers made compatible machines which could run the same software, which were known as ""IBM PC compatible"".

During the transition period all the normal EU rules apply to the UK, including free movement. The main difference is it will no longer be represented in the EU's institutions, and the UK and EU can start formal negotations for the post-transition trade deal.

I think the UK could also start trade deal talks with non-EU countries, but I'm not sure if there's much point doing that before the deal with the EU is sorted out."

* A decent PC is more powerful than the current consoles. Games can be run with better graphics and better performance.
* A wider choice of games.
* Lots of games can be modded.
* Online multiplayer doesn't cost extra.
* Games are often cheaper.

A few cons:

* Higher upfront cost. Even a basic gaming PC will probably be more expensive than a console.
* Some games are console exclusive.
* You're more likely to have compatibility problems.
* Can be a bit more complicated given that there are several different competing launchers and storefronts."
NoStupidQuestions,fek3u5s,t1_fek1tkv,1579192032.0,"Whether or not you pronounce the hard R depends on your accent.

In a typical non-rhotic British accent there is no hard R in this case, so it's pronounced kind of like ah-s. It's like that just because that's how R is pronounced in those accents.

If you have a rhotic accent (e.g. the English Westcountry accent), then it is a hard R. Arr-s.

So which way you should pronounce it depends on what you're trying to do. 

If you're just saying the word ""arse"" in your own accent, then it's a hard R.

If you're doing an impression of a ""British accent"" then there isn't a hard R. Although as I noted before, not all British accents are like that."
NoStupidQuestions,fejwatz,t3_epimb1,1579187326.0,"Prince/princess kind of has two meanings.

In one sense a prince/princess is anyone who is in the direct-ish line of succession. So the Queen's children and grandchildren are considered princes/princesses (with some exceptions I think). So in that sense Kate is a princess on account of being married to a prince.

In a more formal sense, Prince can be a specific title. Charles is the Prince of Wales, so his wife was the Princess of Wales (I don't think his current wife has taken that title).

William doesn't have a formal Prince title yet. But he has been granted the title Duke of Cambridge. So his wife is a duchess.

When the Queen dies, Charles will be King and William will become Prince of Wales. So then Kate will more formally be a princess."

In my secondary school you did French in the year 7,  and if you were good enough at it you did French and German in year 8 and 9. Then you had the choice of which to continue for GCSE (so up to age 16).

In primary school I think I just did the odd French lesson. I don't remember it being a regular thing."

NoStupidQuestions,fegy9ud,t3_ep3xdk,1579105210.0,"I'm guessing this is in reference to Russia?

In this context ""government"" means something different to what it means in the US. 

Russia has a semi-presidential system. I don't know the specifics of their system, but as I understand it power is shared by the President (Putin) and the Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister is the head of government. That means he's the head of a team of government ministers who are in each in charge of various things (like US heads of departments).

That's what the ""government"" refers to. It doesn't mean their entire parliament has resigned. It basically just means the PM has resigned and in doing so the government he leads has essentially disbanded."
