I wish someone had told me as a kid that they're not different to any other animal, especially to dogs who we invite into our homes and beds."

aww,ffcwftj,t1_ffcu9hu,1579808689.0,"Where are you from? I'm from Germany so I could imagine  it wouldn't be the same labels producing the substitutes if we're from different countries.
What I personally really like is vegan cream cheese, if you season it with s&p, green onions and tomatoes, there's nothing much better to eat as bread spread. 
I was never that much into cheese before I went vegan so unfortunately I haven't checked out many substitutes yet, but I'd really suggest you just eat your way through everything your next big store has.
I did so with plant based milks. I had only ever drank soy milk and thought I could never live plant based, but then I  tried literally every kind of plant based milk they had in the next super market and I found a few I absolutely adore."
VeganFoodPorn,ffcu088,t1_ffcnkty,1579807232.0,"I never tried it before either, but it always looks so pretty so I had to finally make it. It might be my new favorite of the brassica oleracea family. It somewhat tastes like a mixture between cauliflower and brussel sprouts."

aww,ffbzknj,t1_ff8drh8,1579787663.0,"Once you are on the other side you will discover on how much you were missing out ;) Just think about it, it's JUST animal products. There's still thousands of edible vegetables, legumes, pasta, potatoes, plant based milks, cheeses, plant based fast food, burgers, you can still have it all ;)"
aww,ffbz5lf,t1_ff97ylj,1579787333.0,that's awful
aww,ffbz1vu,t1_ffbn1hw,1579787252.0,"I think most vegans said this about cheese at one point. My mother was the biggest cheese freak ever but she made the switch with me overnight and says she didn't even miss it anymore after a week or so.I don't know if you know, but in dairy products is an opioid peptide called ""Casomorphin"" which is literally addicting. It's there to ensure that the calf always comes back to their mothers udder. So it's something you really have to get off. 

So yeah, I can totally understand where people come from when they say they could never ""live"" without cheese, but I think we really owe it to the cows that we properly try it. And I don't think there is one person who could try it and wouldn't be successful. You're familiar with the horrible conditions the animals of the meat industry have to live in, but I'd consider the dairy industry to be even more cruel. (and it's also the meat industry only with extra steps). Maybe you have some time to look into it more :)"

vegan,ff2ddew,t1_ff0t57r,1579501591.0,They suffer and overproduce because we made them that way. The way we bred them hurt them. Vegans aren't for that we stop milking all the cows right now but that people stop breeding them into existence
