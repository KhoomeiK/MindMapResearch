DQBuilders,ff4gfb8,t1_ff46yf5,1579562996.0,"What chapter are you in? Do you have access to the castle battlement blocks yet? You have to use those large 2x2 wedges [Castle Corner] They're a bit tricky to place, try facing a certain direction and placing one down, then climb ontop of it facing the same direction and jump place blocks below you. (it happens automatically when you're aiming down with the left trigger on switch) First person mode could also work while jumping. You can see what I'm talking about with the little incomplete gatehouse.

I had a huge problem with the backside of the castle due to the sharp right angles, actually. So be careful of those."
DQBuilders,ff4g4xm,t1_ff42wwp,1579562799.0,"I think it's 100 meat per animal, so that should be enough for six animals. Although you can just use 2 cats like I mentioned, so 200 meat. The shop and the pet breeding are the only tablet targets I found particularly annoying, so there's that at least :) The rest were pretty fun."
DQBuilders,ff42i2y,t1_ff3zrou,1579554118.0,While I have you here get a shop set up ASAP. You need to sell 500 items. You also need to breed three cats or dogs and that takes hundreds of pieces of meat. I bred six cats at a time but apparently you can just get two cats to 100% and breed them three days in a row. Those are two big tablet targets that’ll be annoying. For the item shop I just got five merchants and disabled the other attractions for a while. They usually sell the most during the evening. The cats still took me like four hours and they ate so much meat. It was so annoying because I didn’t start it early.
DQBuilders,ff3zs47,t3_eqp6xm,1579552429.0,It was still slow but I just bred six cats at the same time and it wasn’t too horrible

I also don’t think anyone thinks this is for real a friendzoning or anything like that. But this image gave me the same whiplash he’s talking about, and clearly he’s onto something if sooooo many people are saying the same things as him"
oddlysatisfying,fdjmihp,t1_fdh3n79,1578478058.0,I don’t know why so many people are against this point of view. You’re not an incel just because you think of the phrase “friend zone” when you see “FRIEND❤️”
oddlysatisfying,fdjmd8t,t1_fdgu97t,1578477846.0,"Do you want a real answer? 

From the way I viewed it, it looks like something very impressive and difficult, like a good valentine’s day gift or something, and then the last word friend came up and it immediately took on a fake second meaning. Now everyone who thought up that possible second meaning wants to comment on it.  Myself included. I’m well aware I’m not clever. But you don’t have to be clever to attempt bad jokes

Also friend was the focal point as it was massive, and in all caps. The heart dot also probably played a part in coming up with the double meaning.

The slow speed also made you think a lot longer than I
you averagely do, trying to guess what word will come next as each letter is written out. “You’re all I’ve ever wanted “ “Awww~” “FRIEND❤️” “Hey wait”"
