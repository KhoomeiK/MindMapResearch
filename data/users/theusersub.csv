That's a hard spot because you're not his mother and shouldn't be required to nag him, especially if it's a mutually agreed on change. Maybe he's just not taking it seriously because he doesn't feel the consequences. 


Me and my GF are great! Most of what therapy did for us was to help learn to keep in mind what the other person doesn't know, or isn't thinking about. 
It's easy to assume someone else understands your actions, motivations and preferences, without ever actually informing that person of those things. As you spend more and more time with someone you just kind of figure they should be able to read you, but that's not really a thing. 
We're both lucky that we're so committed we'll do hard and boring stuff needed to invest in our relationship. Like talking out a topic fully over the course of a weekend two as we think of more layers to the conversation. (specifically handling family members, and comparing how other people handle family) 
The best part about our therapist was basically giving us more topics to discuss on our own that we hadn't thought of, and adding some more perspectives. We still had to do the hard part of furthering the discussion on our own, since the sessions fly by so quick. 


Being a part of my own church recharges me pretty well. I know there's plenty of boring or judgmental churches as well out there."

Advice,ff4jzwb,t1_ff4ebhc,1579565458.0,"That's good to get down to the root of your feelings. It's possible he doesn't have the same goals as you do, but those can change also. It's also possible he's doing all that he's capable of in his current mental capacity for stress. He might not really see a problem at all. 

Keep in mind that you are worth working for and he needs to put time and effort into your relationship (even aside from financial pursuits). Also it may take some time for him to make any changes like that, so be sure to give him some time, but make sure that your views are heard AND understood. (not nagging but active cooperative communication) 

Every therapist is different so keep that in mind. Also don't shy away from the cost since loosing that many years is a cost in itself. My GF and I found that even though we didn't like our therapist all that much in the end, he gave us plenty of ideas to explore and discuss so we could  understand each others views, and desires better


Keep in mind that opinions are fluid. Our perspective change everyday and each sentence we hear has the ability to open up our internal world to New patterns of thought. People don't typically change immediately and change is hard.  Make sure that you both communicate your intensions.

which fullmetal alchemist was the one that ended with him in the middle of ww2? and then which is the one that had an actual ending where they turned the whole country into a symbol? I meant to mark the ww2 one as a 6, and the other one as a 7, but hadn't gone back to change that ever.

with promised neverland and attack on titan, It was the same issue for me. I was expecting one type of story for a few episodes and ended up having no idea what kind of show I was watching. in promised neverland I had watched it right after haibane renmei which is a STARK DIFFERENCE. as soon as I even suspected it getting into horror territory I noped out of there. attack on titan was really well done, but after I was caught up, I looked up the story from the anime to see where this thing was going, and after reading how that thing ends, I felt like I had waisted all of my time invested in the show. it just sounded so week and pulled out of left field. some real shark jumping stuff.

just my opinions though"

noragami is pretty good, and people don't talk about it enough. I've enjoyed all the evangelions as well. I'll look into persona 4"
Frugal,fefxmxe,t1_fef8b1n,1579068611.0,This. There are plenty of cars that are still Fairly reliable at higher miles. You get to know the quirks of a specific brand and model if you stick with it. Also if you find the right Craigslist mechanic to hire and do the things that you aren't confident in you can save a ton of money.

realtors,feeg4zv,t3_eomzy9,1579033067.0,you're broker should have the say in how to handle this. you're one step away from requiring a real estate attorney
smallbusiness,feefyq2,t1_fedpg7m,1579032966.0,"if that money is used to ""catch up"" that tells me someone has been living above their means, and that could be a trend likely to continue. not trying to be negative, but I am trying to be helpful to point out a problem when I see it. using the money for an investment  might only bring your parents back to their normal level of spending income, and they'll still be in trouble when one of them retires"
realtors,fee9kwu,t1_fedvsdm,1579029218.0,That's the real answer. Have your broker call their broker
