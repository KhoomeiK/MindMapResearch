StarWars,fffb09p,t1_ffen4u7,1579879988.0,"It's a great game, but go in with the frame of mind of when it came out. Things that feel generic may be because they were one of the founders, and things that feel clunky was because nobody else had solved the problem yet and they were trying something new."

worldnews,ffba4g5,t1_ffb9jdj,1579756966.0,I can't think of any response that is either going to start a constructive conversation or not horribly offend you and cause you to become defensive.
AskReddit,ffavz8v,t1_ffaj6p2,1579745763.0,This applies regardless of your hobbies. Don't interact with people to date and/or fuck them. Interact with them because they are interesting and you want to be friends. If that goes to romance then cool. If not then you still have a new friend.

technology,fey3qlu,t1_fey2na7,1579440415.0,"Sure, just to entertain this discussion though, the people would disrupt manufacturing, transportation, tax collection, etc. If the government is a ""well oiled machine"", then the people are the oil. Removing the oil makes the machine run like shit. Having an armed populace simply makes that process easier. The people would never win in a straight fight, but guns make guerilla fighting effective.

Funny enough it's the same story for how the colonies revolted against the British in the 18th century. Dramatically less fire-power, but being armed by the french **really** helped their situation out."
technology,fey0r2c,t1_fexwbqx,1579439233.0,The prevailing thought is we the people would all be armed and could defend ourselves. It's why the second amendment exists. To protect the people from tyranny. The current debate isn't really about that though so we are conflating topics
MovieDetails,few4xn6,t1_fevypls,1579405433.0,"I don't think issue is just understanding what they are, but trying to keep in mind which universe we're in. 

Example) If they did a movie in an alternate universe where Cap became evil after fighting with himself over the time stone. Then in a sequel to that Cap kills Tony In the Civil War; the average movie goer may became really confused on which universe this is in and why Tony is still alive, but died a second time and what this means for Professor Hulk and Spider Man."
MovieDetails,fev9h99,t1_fev4u7e,1579394737.0,The Multiverse in the comics very quickly becomes overwhelming to keep up with for the casual fan. Very enthusiastic fans will eat it up but the second they start explaining a lot of the shenanigans less invested people will start to get lost and disinterested in it. That being said I think the executives at Marvel are smart enough to be able to ease the larger movie-going audience in and create constant on-ramps for newer/younger fans to get up to speed.  Only time will tell.
pcgaming,fekh0pv,t1_fekdy4m,1579199866.0,"They still underestimated, but I'm not mad. I'd rather they push the date for a better game and a Dev team which isn't falling apart from stress."
smashbros,fejurgo,t1_fejomws,1579186317.0,I think he means that there is a logical path for Nintendo to choose them (meaning those relationships exist). Not that it was actually a considered option by demand.

As I suggested the NYTimes doesn't have advertisers and is funded entirely by it's subscribers"
technology,feink5h,t1_feiji75,1579142705.0,"On one hand you could argue that news should be removed from private interests and instead turned to the public.

On the other hand having government (and political parties) having direct regulatory and legal control is a terrifying prospect. 

Best option, in my humble opinion, is to seek out news you find credible and support it directly (as in to pay for it). I like NYTimes but you should do your own research. I would recommend avoiding any news outlets with a television presence however. Trying to fill the air 24/7 tends to produce a lot of hyperbolic crap."

I hear you, I'm not a pit player so I don't have any dogs in this fight. Just my opinion is when I do play him I feel...I don't know... Neutered? 

It's not because I don't know his kit, it just feels like he's... mediocre and doesn't feel decent in any particular way. And he's not an all rounder either. If Mario was C's across the board. Pitt is all D's. He's not **bad**; but he's less than average.

You would think a player with wings would have more height and/or air control."
smashbros,fe2yp5d,t1_fe2wzn0,1578844316.0,"I don't think the accusation is that he's unplayable. Just that he's disproportionately disadvantaged compared to other characters. I have not met a single player who doesn't respond to ""should I play Pitt?"" With ""I wouldn't""."
