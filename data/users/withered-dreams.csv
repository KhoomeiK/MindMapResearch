offmychest,ffvqr3j,t3_evhe3w,1580270635.0,Just simply tell her you don’t like sharing clothes. You don’t have to explain why. It’s your stuff and you decide what happens with it.

actuallesbians,ffstg6c,t3_ev1cyo,1580191828.0,I thoroughly believe that sexuality can be fluid for many people! I also have found that labels can actually cause more harm than good for people sometimes. If I were you I’d focus on you and if you find someone you like along your way then just go with it! You don’t have to stick to a label and you don’t owe anyone else an explanation on your sexuality.

bipolar,ffps0a8,t1_ffprtsd,1580103604.0,I have not tried just that before. They kind of jumped into stuff pretty heavily rather than easing into it. I would be open to that though! I am thinking about stopping all of my birth control with my current doctor then going to a new one and seeing what they think. I need to find a new one anyway because I still go to my pediatric one and I have to leave when I turn 21.

bipolar,ffprfj6,t1_ffpr1ti,1580103046.0,"I have endometriosis so my periods can be a little wack sometimes. My dr has me on three types of birth control (iud, shot, pill) and it’s causing way more harm than good I think. I’ve been on my period for two weeks now. (Sorry if that’s TMI). I have an appointment in February and I am going to stop all of my birth control. I’m lesbian so it doesn’t even matter lol. I am interested to see how it affects my mood since I’ve been on birth control since I was 13 and I am 20 now. I am hopeful that it will help at least a little bit to be off of it."

relationship_advice,ffhhliu,t3_etne2x,1579935592.0,Leave him. Consent for any sexual activity can be revoked at anytime and he needs to understand that. This is only going to get worse. Get away from him while you can.
piercing,ffhgmwq,t3_etnack,1579934398.0,"I got my industrial done about 4 weeks ago. It’s been a little tougher to take care of properly compared to my other piercings, but nothing too bad. I love how it looks so it’s completely worth it to me!"
relationship_advice,ffg5e36,t3_etgad7,1579898822.0,"Since she hasn’t met up with these exes since you all have been talking, I wouldn’t be concerned about it. If that changes and she starts seeing them again, then I think it would be important to talk about. I don’t think it’s weird to keep something from an ex, like a pillow. If it’s comfortable then it’s comfortable. I wouldn’t worry too much about this! It just seems like you might be overthinking a bit. Best of luck to you two!"

I wish I had useful things to say but my only advice is to seek therapy if possible and just keep openly communicating with your girlfriend. Best of luck to you both!
actuallesbians,ffbi8ps,t1_ffbi2cz,1579766514.0,Exactly! If someone has a problem with it then they’re not worth your time. Focus on you and what you want to do!
