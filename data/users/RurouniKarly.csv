Shortly after The Mandalorian was released, someone made a crochet pattern for The Child, and that was her picture of her own finished product. She was selling the pattern for a little while until some geek news site picked it up, it drew too much attention, and the she got a cease and desist for distributing the pattern. Now people have been making their own finished objects based on her pattern, but that picture is definitely not the actual finished item for any of the listings out there."

bestof,fg3dwi5,t3_ewgs1k,1580478975.0,"I went to a Psychiatry didactics session on emotional support animals, and letters for emotional support animals are pretty easy to overturn in court if one is so inclined. Most emotional support animal letters are complete BS that someone bought off the internet. Then, of the ones that actually came from a real practitioner, most are not written by actual medical doctors and did not undergo any kind of evaluation that would hold up under scrutiny. If an emotional support animal designation was going to hold up in court, the provider who issued it would need to demonstrate that they did a thorough evaluation of the patient to determine that they are anxious or mentally unwell to the point of disability, that the prescription of an animal was found to be a more effective therapy than the current standard of care, and that they evaluated the animal itself to determine if that specific animal was capable of fulfilling the medical need and not being a nuisance in public. 

Emotional support animals are becoming a big enough problem that I anticipate there will be a major crackdown on them both within Psychiatric organizations and legal protocols in the near future."
medicalschool,fg22tai,t3_ew9qcz,1580437042.0,"I keep getting stuck on the bit about FM and EM being identical. The only similarity I can see is that people often visit the ED for stupid problems that aren't emergencies and should be the purview of their PCP. But the big, and I think extraordinarily important, distinction is that FM has longitudinal relationships and continuity of care while EM rules out life threatening problems and sends people on their way. People are drawn to EM specifically because they don't have to keep following the patients after their initial evaluation or do follow ups, which is antithetical to FM."

medicalschool,fg1yxjv,t3_ewf4ji,1580435323.0,"In general, it's good to have letters from other specialties as well. It shows that you are well rounded and are able to perform to a high standard in multiple settings. It also says something about your likability as a person if you can appeal to people in different specialties enough for them to write a letter on your behalf. A surgery letter would probably be pretty good for IM since hospitalists end up collaborating with surgeons so often."

therewasanattempt,ffwh6yk,t3_evk5kk,1580300886.0,"I will say though, that masks became very popular during the SARS outbreak to the point where they became a fashion statement and people were starting to wear fashion fabric masks, which are next to useless when it comes to stopping transmission of a virus. At one point Burberry even released a cloth face mask in one of their lines. Even today it's fashionable to wear face masks in the winter, and most of them are not medical grade, they're just fabric chosen to match an outfit, and sometimes the design itself isn't even a shape that is functional for disease control."
medicine,ffpb25r,t1_ffp3lrb,1580090608.0,"But your funding already goes with you if you change programs. When you match in a particular specialty, that comes with a certain number of years of Medicare funding for your training, and you get the balance of that funding even if you change programs. People don't stay in malignant residency programs because of the money, they stay because another program has to have space available and be willing to take you. People can and do change programs and even specialties all the time, but it's finding an open spot at an amenable program that is the problem. So unless part of your plan is to do away with established, accredited, finite residency slots, explicitly transferring GME funding to the students doesn't change the outcome."
medicine,ffov892,t1_ffn0m39,1580082203.0,"It depends on what you consider ""associated residency spots."" Most DO schools don't have their own hospital, so they can't offer residency spots under their own name, but it's a big initiative for DO schools to help expand or create community programs in their region. Now, these are predominately community primary care programs, but DO schools have been expanding GME all the same. It just isn't as obvious."
medicine,ffotjex,t1_ffnjflj,1580081601.0,"There does have to be standards though.

And new grads don't know enough about what they really need out of training to be able to avoid pit falls. Not to mention that popular locations would still have to maintain a cap on how many graduates they could take in order to maintain adequate case numbers for each person. Training in accredited programs governed by national oversight is how we can have a baseline level of confidence in residency trained physicians."
todayilearned,ffj13e9,t1_ffiyq2t,1579987733.0,"Hunters have a long tradition of respect for habitat and ecosystems. In fact, a lot of habitat and conservation is either paid for directly by hunting organizations or indirectly by hunters through taxes and fees on hunting tags and equipment. Hunters have a strong, vested interest in ensuring that habitats are maintained, animal populations stay healthy, and that they are harvesting animals in a responsible and humane way. There is skill and pride in being able to take down an animal by killing it instantly. Intentionally causing needless suffering is never, ever acceptable. Jackasses like this go against everything sportsman strive for and pride themselves in."

First, drinking alcohol anywhere, even at home, was grounds for dismissal. Second, premarital or extramarital sex was grounds for dismissal."
TheHandmaidsTale,fffdm5m,t1_fff72bn,1579881637.0,"That particular story, the issue wasn't the non-procreative sex, it was the man trying to game the system to steal an inheritance. The custom was that if a man died before producing an heir with his wife, it was the man's brother's responsibility to sleep with the widow and conceive a child on behalf of the deceased brother that would inherit his estate. But if no sons came from the union, then the inheritance would go to the brother instead. So Onan was having sex with Tamar in accordance with this custom, but was ejaculating on the floor so that no child would be conceived and he would get the estate instead."
TheHandmaidsTale,ffej9oh,t3_et6v06,1579850294.0,"Serena and Fred have sex on screen without any kind of insinuation that what they're doing is prohibited by Gilead. So that would indicate that there's no prohibition against sex between husbands and barren wives. There would even still be Biblical support for that. Before Rachel and Bilhah, there was Sarah and Hagar. The entire story of Sarah and her handmaiden plays out with Sarah insisting that Abraham give her a child through Hagar, meanwhile, Sarah and Abraham are still having sex and Sarah eventually becomes pregnant with a miracle child at a very old age. Even Rachel eventually had 2 children of her own after giving her handmaiden to Jacob. So it would stand to reason that if this story is being used as the blueprint for Handmaid legislation, it would still be encouraged for husbands and wives to ""keep faith and continue trying"" even when they have a handmaid.

Additionally, there's precedent in the Catholic church for this doctrine. Catholicism holds that sex is purely for reproduction and bans contraception, but they also hold that sex is always allowable between a married couple, even when they are infertile or the couple is past the age of child bearing, as long as the couple remains ""open"" to the possibility of conception."

The story was that a month previously he had fallen at school, hit his head hard on the pavement, and LOST CONSCIOUSNESS. His mom came and got him, and for next few weeks he was displaying a very irregular sleep pattern and was having daily incapacitating headaches. The only medical provider in their area was an NP with her own clinic. They saw her several times, begging for a head CT, but the NP kept refusing and finally fired the kid as a patient saying that she thought he was faking everything. The Pediatrician and I listened to this story in utter disbelief that the NP could be so obtuse and refuse to work up symptomatic head trauma in a child."

I went to the AMP conference this year, and virtually everyone said they are using their combined training in some shape or form. Not everyone is working on a med psych unit or strictly splitting their days between Medicine and Psychiatry, the reality of practicing with combined training is more fluid than that. For instance, one FM/P attending was saying that on paper she only does Psych, but she does a lot of work in the Psych ED and her FM training gets used on a daily basis as she evaluates patients."
medicalschool,feyw46t,t1_fex3977,1579451176.0,"Yeah, there is a lot that makes FM very appealing.

It took doing sub-I's in both and really evaluating how I felt about the day to day work. I realized that I got a lot more joy out of spending my day talking to and connecting with psych patients than I did standard primary care patients, and I kind of hated inpatient Medicine. I would say, if you feel like your primary motivation in medicine is building relationships with patients and that connecting with people brings you joy, Psych will be a better place for you. If you enjoy puzzles and really find yourself liking to work within more structured environments and protocols, then IM/FM is probably a better choice. Psych is a lot more abstract and the skill set can, in ways, be similar to what it took to do well in high level English classes."
