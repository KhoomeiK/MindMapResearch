PoliticalPhilosophy,feagmd4,t3_eo5uhf,1578948536.0,"Strict utilitarianism accepts policies which better the lives of most at the cost of the few.

It's great unless the few disagree with the majority.  Utilitarianism devolves into tyranny of the majority, with most sacrificing the good of the few in exchange for the 'greater good'.

In an extreme example, mass genocide could be considered positive in a utilitarian view if that genocide created better conditions for the greater number of people still living than those who were killed.

Racism does not mean ""assigning negative traits to a race of people"". Racism is conceptually splitting people into separate categories by race and assigning traits to them based on the race they have been assigned to.

Side note: racism/empowerment are not a dichotomy.  Something can be racist and empowering or neither racist or empowering.  Asking ""is this racist or empowering"" is a silly distinction to make."

Fascism does not require a specific economic system to function.  Capitalism, communism, even barter systems can be overseen by fascist governments. 

Communism is not mutually exclusive to fascist leadership for the reason that ""fascists always fight communists"".  Stalin's Russia was a fascist form of communism.  State-controlled industry with an authoritarian fascist style of leadership (cult of stalin/motherland).

If you can figure out a way to handle movement/lean with the Xbox adaptive  controller, 30 buttons should be enough.  I have #1-6, use, inventory, crouch, toggle walk, prone, grenade, check ammo/gun etc all mapped on my mouse so my left hand only deals with movement and leaning.
