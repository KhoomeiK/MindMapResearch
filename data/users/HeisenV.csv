gaming,ffg9pgj,t3_eteqnp,1579901485.0,I want it. My ps4 is resting on top of a pile of books because it overheats and spits out whatever disc its reading and/or resets. Good job with the design. Definitely jealousy inducing.
HPfanfiction,fffe3rv,t1_fffdjwn,1579881951.0,"That's what I meant with the magic system being soft and hand wavy. And I also added the ""if magical exhaustion is a thing"". Once you start to combine technology with magic you need to add some layers of fantasy so you don't break the suspension of disbelief. You have to admit it's a bit lazy to have someone wave their wand once and create infinite energy."
HPfanfiction,fffdkeq,t1_fffd0xq,1579881607.0,"True, but that would make the system even more inefficient, increasing the burden in the caster. It could be magically generated steam in another location that moves the turbine in the generator now that I think about it. But there's still the question of keeping the thing going."
HPfanfiction,fffc9l6,t1_fffa3ga,1579880789.0,"Regardless, its one dude working as a battery. Even at 100% efficiency Harry must be somehow producing it directly. I mean, JKs magic system is pretty soft. They violate the laws of thermodynamics constantly since first year, but here the spell involves spinning the damn thing constantly to power a city. I think you'd need more layers of magic  hand waving for the concept to have legs. Make something up with runic arrays and a new spell or something."
HPfanfiction,fff96q2,t3_et8qak,1579878814.0,">The magic is only on the turbine and can be kept completely away from all elctrical wiring but still Harry can make a fortune. 

How would the electricity generated get to the power grid if the turbine is away from all the electrical wiring? If magical exhaustion is a thing, that means that the energy to move the turbine is, at least in part, coming from the caster. Which means that even if you take it to an extreme, there has to be a limit to how much energy a single person can produce. The caster would be constantly drained to keep the turbine going and turbines are *very* inefficient, so something like 70% of the energy required to spin is lost as heat and sound. That means that Harry would have to produce about 333% of the energy required to power a city. By that point you might as well take the turbine out of the equation and invent a new spell or something ."

This is why his party loves him so much even when he doesn't stand for any of the so called conservative values. He's the ultimate smokescreen."

bodyweightfitness,ffcsz00,t1_ffckre7,1579806630.0,"Like u/Protek1 said, intuitive eating doesn't work for everyone. I've struggled with weight loss my whole life, until I went through the exercise of measuring my food and honestly seeing were all my calories were coming from. Most people have no idea how small 3oz of chicken really are. I never get full. I'm one of those animals that can smash a Chinese takeout order and a triple baconator within 1 hour of each other and then look for dessert. It's like my brain never gets a satiety signal. People like me need a re-education period to see what a healthy calorie intake looks like before trying to eat intuitively."
bodyweightfitness,ffcs5x8,t1_ffcjs4r,1579806154.0,">Being at a deficit does not ensure you are recruiting fat to fill that gap

Our metabolism is fairly adept at prioritizing our energy source as long as there isn't some underlying pathology. I agree that if your deficit isn't large you eat into your glycogen reserves and then start mobilizing fat stores, but over time it evens out. Especially if you're strenght training since you deplete your glycogen stores very quickly that way."
