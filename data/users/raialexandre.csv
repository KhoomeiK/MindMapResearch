Super saiyan 3 on the other hand was crazy on concept(pushing the form beyond its limits no matter the cost) that  it could never stop being wasteful, this was mentioned several times and is why Vegeta never tried going super saiyan 3, and also why only 2 characters ever went super saiyan 3.

demonssouls,ff6vqm3,t1_ff6sqm4,1579635870.0,"Well, what happened is that for Bandai to publish/make a game with From Software(which was then a very small, unknown developer), Miyazaki agreed to make 3 games for them, but he had no interest in making sequels, so he moved to BloodBorne after finishing Dark Souls 1.

I don't like Dark Souls 2, but I understand that the development was hell, though I'm still salty about some decisions like the graphics/lighting downgrade that really hurt the game's atmosphere, how they overdone the number of enemies everywhere to make the game harder, and the decision to link hitboxes and i-frames to stats.  I think they were too ambitious, and hoped to become even more famous than dark souls 1, but for the wrong reasons.

Now for DS3, Miyazaki came back but didn't cared much about it, I don't know why he came back, perhaps he was just unhappy with ds2? Either way, I enjoyed the game, nothing to complain other than it just felt unnecessary(like ds2), but it was good, didn't had any problem with any core element like I had with DS2. 

I don't really get why people would be angry about characters and locations from a previous game being on a sequel, it felt lazy that Anor Londo was copy-pasted, but if you aren't going to have things from the prequel then why even be a sequel instead of a game with a different name? DS3 showed what happened to DS1 locations and characters, while DS2 had none of that with the exception of Ornstein being randomly on the game for no reason, which was bizarre. We also got female Nito in DS2, which eh... Okay..."

It was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by Pliny the Elder (red, yellow, black, and white), but nonetheless it was used as a background colour behind the friezes on Greek temples and to colour the beards of Greek statues.
