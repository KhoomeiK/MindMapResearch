DSD is so widely misunderstood too. It makes sense from a purely vacuum perspective. But the sheer amount of storage it requires makes engineers go ""Hmmm, how about we just accept a *little* bit of quantization noise in exchange for multiple folds storage shrink?"" so PCM is industry standard now. Unless you have a DAC chip that *accepts* DSD as data input you then what you do is just add quantization noise first by converting to PCM then feed to the DAC just to decode it to DSD again. That's before even considering most material won't stay DSD during the mixing and mastering process."

There is no point going beyond 16/44.1 or 16/48. Higher bit depth may only waste space but higher sampling rate actually hurts fidelity. Most reasonable gears are designed to produce up to 20kHz. When you toss higher frequency content at them they will produce audible distortion"
