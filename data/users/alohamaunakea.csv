Ultralight,fewkyu4,t3_eqr3ul,1579413110.0,I went with an [Osprey Hikelite 26](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/hikelite-26-HIKELITE26.html?sku=10001547&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=fy18_us_ecomm_shopping_google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=smart&gclid=Cj0KCQiA9orxBRD0ARIsAK9JDxQPGVeWeisJ3t7weKgnDk9G6ndLLtKV8Wq69wm3W9X7RmvncchOzgEaAvTzEALw_wcB)  that has the mesh panel called Airspeed - same style as their Exos/Eja line. Might be worth a look.
Ultralight,femr45a,t3_epzwto,1579267183.0,I‚Äôve heard some great things about [tipi style tents](https://luxe-hiking-gear.com/collections/lightweight-camping-tents/products/hexpeak-1p-tent-system) for wind and rain protection year round. Not the most UL option but would provide great versatility with pitching options too.

Can get all those ingredients for less than $5 and get a nice sourdough loaf and some wine for less than $20 easy!"

AskReddit,fejp4fm,t1_fejhnab,1579182181.0,Yeah I have that and am losing feeling all over my body - would not recommend. It‚Äôs called CIDP.
preppers,fdh4lw6,t3_elcy69,1578415265.0,"Awesome topic! It‚Äôs important to observe your local environment as well to determine what you should prep first. In my area that is prone to drought and fires, my priorities are water storage and a high quality breathing mask. I also need the ability to be mobile at any moments notice if a fire sweeps through my area so I don‚Äôt have a huge pantry of food but a container of dried foods and a book on wild foraging of edibles. This prioritizes the top 3 for me of air, water, and food according to my local environment and creates redundancies. This also shapes my med kit setup since I would need to include things like burn ointment, gauze for burns, eye wash in case ash or dirt gets into someone‚Äôs eyes(very real concern in fire - goggles would be first line of defense in this regard). As someone who just got into prepping, it‚Äôs painfully obvious how many of those premade kits are marketed to be easy but may not cover all of your actual needs."

preppers,fcuhlqf,t1_fcttcy0,1577981152.0,"As someone who is in a fire prone area (US - Northern California), more websites are popping up that give an overview of the basics for a fire evacuation kit. I‚Äôd recommend having at least one of these basics for each member of your family if at all possible secured in a strong duffel bag in a convenient location. This will put you ahead of 95% of the population, as morbid as that is to say it is the reality that even the smoke in people‚Äôs backyard is not enough for people to take precautions- some people in my area did not have masks when air quality was measured to be dangerous, water sold out at all stores, and shelters that were set up to take in temporary refugees ended up having to move multiple times to avoid fire. 

As you said, this is the new reality here too, part of our consciousness. Yet it will be those who take action to prepare now who will survive in the end. I don‚Äôt consider this approach to be paranoid or overly-anxious after what I saw happen last summer and what the reports are coming out of Australia. 

Some websites I‚Äôve found helpful:

https://www.firesafemarin.org/evacuation/go-kit

https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/get-set/emergency-supply-kit/

And of course YouTube has videos on the subject, and I‚Äôve found some great prepping advice from SensiblePrepper who did a series on using everyday household items for SHTF. I‚Äôm putting together mini kits for various uses for big in and bugout bags now.

Stay safe out there. Being even one step ahead of the masses can make a huge difference for you and your loved ones."
preppers,fctirqf,t3_eiq43d,1577944699.0,"Northern California here, and after the last fire season ended I‚Äôve been putting together a much more comprehensive bugout kit as well as water storage and filtration options. Also prepping for power outages since they‚Äôre starting to turn our power off preemptively if they think it will reduce fire risk.

Ordering P2/N95 masks was also a huge thing since we ended up going through our current supply this past season. Air is only going to get worse and since it is the first of the rule of 3‚Äôs I‚Äôm not taking any chances. Either way, by next fire season I‚Äôll have both a bug-in and bugout plan ready to go."
