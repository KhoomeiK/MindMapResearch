learnprogramming,fflku37,t1_fflfxyh,1580040820.0,"> You mean post-increments.

You're right, corrected.

> It's a pretty standard implementation of string copy and the intent is pretty obvious to anyone familiar with C. Your implementation is much more verbose and requires having to parse many more steps in order to understand the intent, making it arguably harder to read and being less safe due to more potential points of failure.

It's a standard library function that essentially no one should have to implement themselves, but if you are it's a bad implementation. No one would consider that readable code. This thread would not exist if it were readable code. In the past implementations like that were somewhat common because they are more efficient *without optimizations*, but that's irrelevant these days."

ProgrammerHumor,ffl88or,t1_ffk4xqh,1580036145.0,"I think it's actually unspecified in C, but usually right to left because that's the order that parameters usually get pushed onto the stack. Later languages specified it as right to left in order to eliminate a lot of unspecified behavior."
learnprogramming,ffl6l8p,t3_etxplw,1580035480.0,"C# is very similar to Java. You can pick it up in a day and start working on your game, and you'll learn the minor differences along the way. If all you care about is making a game, this is the best choice.

C++ will teach you many more new things, like memory management and pointers. If you want to expand your skill set more, this is is the best choice. You will make little or no progress on the game for the first few weeks while you are picking up the language though.

C++ runs faster as others have already said, but it's highly unlikely that this will matter for your first game."
learnprogramming,ffl3uua,t3_eu4b77,1580034326.0,"This is a tricky bit of code because it has three(!) side effects inside a condition on an empty loop. On each iteration of the loop the condition is executed and has three effects: `src` is incremented, `dst` is incremented, and the byte at `src` is copied to the byte at `dst. Additionally it's important to note that both increments are *~~pre~~ post*-increments, which means that the value of the expression is the value (in this case address) *before* the incrementing. Finally, since the value of an assignment is the value that was assigned, the character copied is used to evaluate the condition. If this is a null character (byte 0) then the loop terminates.

If we were to expand this to make it more readable it would look like this:

    void copy(char* src, char* dst) {
        do {
            char* pre_src = src;
            char* pre_dst = dst;
            src++;
            dst++;
            *pre_dst = *pre_src;
        } while(*pre_dst != '\0');
    }

Ignoring the precise order of evaluations we could simplify this to:

    void copy(char* src, char* dst) {
        char cpy;
        do {
            cpy = *src;
            *dst = cpy;
            src++;
            dst++;
        } while(cpy != '\0');
    }

I checked this on godbolt.com with Clang and GCC and after optimizations it produces the same assembly code as the original function.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I would argue strongly that the original function is a bad example of how to write code. It looks clever, packing a lot of behavior into a single line, but it is very difficult to read. The reader needs to consider the difference between pre-increment and post-increment, and how a char is treated in a boolean context. The empty loop body should raise eyebrows, and any sort of assignment in a conditional expression is usually a code smell. At best it might be mistaken for a bug by another programmer (as using `=` instead of `==` is a common typo) and replaced with a `==`, which would break the function. I think almost anyone would agree that the code I showed is much more readable, and it produces the exact same assembly (meaning it will have the exact same behavior and execute exactly as fast)."

This is trying to count the number of times the loop runs, but because `i` was not initialized there is no telling what value it will hold at the end. Instead it should be `int i = 0;`

Another common mistake is to not initialize a pointer. This will *usually* cause a segfault when the pointer is dereferenced (same as dereferencing a null pointer), but in some cases it may cause more subtle errors.

The tricky thing about uninitialized variables is that because they can contain anything, they can even contain valid values that will not cause errors.

This is trying to count the number of times the loop runs, but because `i` was not initialized there is no telling what value it will hold at the end. Instead it should be `int i = 0;`

Another common mistake is to not initialize a pointer. This will *usually* cause a segfault when the pointer is dereferenced (same as dereferencing a null pointer), but in some cases it may cause more subtle errors.

The tricky thing about uninitialized variables is that because they can contain anything, they can even contain valid values that will not cause errors. This can cause inconsistent errors, or errors that seem to appear and disappear when you try to debug them. For example adding print statements or running in a debugger could cause the error to disappear or change it's nature. This can make them very difficult to track down."

Where ray tracing might see some use is in applying effects that rasterization can't handle well, like refraction, caustics, and shadows, on top of an otherwise rasterized scene. The thing is, this isn't new either. Every game engine has a ray cast function and it's used for a lot of effects (and gameplay, like hitscan calculations).

Without seeing your code it's impossible to give a definite answer, but it's important to understand that Javascript is singly threaded (per webpage), meaning that only one thing can be happening at a time. If you start something that will take time to complete, nothing else on that page can execute in the meantime (the page will freeze). Async-await provides a way to work around this by allowing tasks that are waiting for something external to complete (usually an HTTP request or a timer) to stop running so other tasks can run instead.
