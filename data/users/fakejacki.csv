I have one on the pack and play and use the other on the keekaroo. My baby however really doesn’t mind being placed right on the keekaroo, and if it’s a poopy diaper I typically fold the liner up so if poop gets on anything, it’s right on the keekaroo and I can wipe it right after."

BabyBumps,fdb4d0n,t3_eker5p,1578253632.0,"I am so sorry you are going through this. I could have written this post, last January 6th was my 6 week ultrasound, January 25th is when we found out about the MMC, D&C on Valentine’s Day. You are going to have a lot of emotions over the next few weeks and months, it was the hardest time for both me and my husband. Just lean on each other, and know there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We stopped trying, and got pregnant in March by accident, and our little boy is currently sleeping on my chest at 2 1/2 weeks old. I wish the best for you and your partner, and hope that this time next year you will have your own little one sleeping on your chest. 💕"
BabyBumps,fdb2ygk,t3_eketla,1578253188.0,"For us we had family coming over the first week we were home. My dad and step mom came while I was in labor and they took care of our dogs and cooked and cleaned to get out house ready for baby, and they stayed 2 days after we got home to help us transition, then my sister came and stayed for a week and a half and helped with the baby and taking care of me, she also cooked and cleaned and took care of our dogs in the mean time. Then we were on our own. We took the baby for 2 hours to family Christmas with my in-laws on Christmas Day and that went really well. We have had my in-laws over a few times to visit. Basically just close family in the beginning. Baby will be 3 weeks next week, and my best friend is coming to stay for a few days. I would say there has to be a hierarchy, some people will see the baby sooner than others, just family at first and once you’re comfortable, close friends. Slowly expand your circle. Don’t feel compelled to let anyone see the baby if you’re not comfortable. 

For the first week I basically didn’t have anyone come over who wouldn’t be comfortable helping me with my physical recovery from delivering him. I was wearing diapers and having ice packs on my perineal area from the tearing, doing sits baths 3x daily, and if you can’t handle helping me with that if i need, you’re not coming in the first week. My sister helped me with my first shower after delivering him. My step mom is a nurse and she checked my stitches for me when I was worried. My husband held the water bag for my sits baths and helped me put pants on. My dad didn’t help with that but he went around changing light bulbs and door handles and cooking while he was here.

This was not an organized comment lol"

todayilearned,fd4nvcj,t1_fd4mj6d,1578169288.0,"I’m sorry they did that to you! Some people just don’t realize the pain they cause by acting that way. My dad actually made several trips to the store for things they needed, my step mom is Italian and she makes these amazing meatballs from scratch and they went and bought everything they need. We didn’t have a blender and she needed one for the meatballs so they bought one and left it here as a present to us. My dad makes amazing beef stew and he brought enough for my husband and I to the hospital the 2nd night we stayed so we didn’t have to have hospital food or go get food. It was amazing. Honestly I don’t know how we would have gotten through the first week without my family’s support. I wish everyone had that support but unfortunately more families act the way your parents did toward you and I hate that."
todayilearned,fd45ri0,t1_fd3rnr8,1578164641.0,"I agree. When I was in the hospital giving birth to our son, my dad and step mom went to our house to take care of our dogs. While they were there, they cooked and froze several meals for us, changed lightbulbs, air filters, organized and cleaned my house. We didn’t ask, they saw it needed to be done and did it because they saw we needed help. Family should take care of family."

insanepeoplefacebook,fcotm7u,t1_fcoimst,1577841216.0,"We had good luck at the hospital I delivered at, we luckily didn’t have any trouble getting breastfeeding established but they were very helpful and informative and told us all the options, when to worry, what is normal weight loss/gain and when to start supplementing if the milk doesn’t come in. But you’re right, it is a problem in healthcare how they talk to new moms and scare them. Fed is best. Don’t starve your child or blame yourself if you have to supplement for a bit, you are still a good mom for keeping your child alive."

As far as pumping schedule I usually pump on the opposite side every time I feed him except at night, and I pump first thing in the morning.

I pump on the opposite side almost every time I feed LO and it’s so great because dad loves to be able to feed him. He gives him his last bottle before bed because it really fills him up and he sleeps longer when he’s full. I also do dishes or change his diaper and keep pumping, and it’s so gentle but effective. Also silent, i pumped at Christmas with the in laws and nobody knew until i took it out to feed him a bottle with what i pumped lol. Highly recommend."

bipolar,fbzqwp3,t3_edmfny,1577257005.0,"1 week our from delivering my baby boy. A bit concerned about spending 2 hours over at my in laws tomorrow, I suddenly started getting anxiety about him being held by certain people and I know everyone is going to want to hold him. I know I can say no to anyone at any time, but I have this weird urge that I’m going to be ultra protective. I’m terrified of postpartum psychosis because I’m at such a high risk, and my sleep pattern has really been affected which has triggered me in the past.

I made extra appointments with my psychiatrist to have welfare checks and let him evaluate me to make sure I’m as stable as I think I am, but I’m still 2 weeks out from my next appointment."
