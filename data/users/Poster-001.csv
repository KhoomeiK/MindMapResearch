lifx,ffdjdtb,t3_esyvmy,1579822119.0,"Sorry to hear about your experience. Personally I would have returned the dodgy strip and bought another.

There are so many people on here with stories like yours, it's quite disheartening. It's not like their products are cheap. Their support is the reason why I don't buy lifx stuff. The only lifx item I have is the strip, it's way better than anything else on the market. For bulbs, I use Hue.

I would love the lifx tiles, but  hearing stories about setting them up has put me off."

Getting expelled from school for drawing a dick? Really? One kid is drawing swastikas, the other is drawing dicks.

Get them to clean it off, in their own time, and 2 week suspension is more than adequate. Also another factor that would play a part is their academic record. If they are good students and this act is out of character, then more leniency is the sensible approach. The only time I would apply an expulsion is if these kids have a record of misbehaving."
facepalm,fe7g4dj,t1_fe5xyyh,1578914208.0,"Hopefully they are not kicked out of school. I am guessing the boys do not fully understand the full implication of drawing the swastika. Although if they are smart, they could say its a good luck symbol (used by the Hindus). 

As way of punishment, I would get them to clean the symbols of the floor and suspend them for a couple of weeks. I would give them some reading to do about WW2.

If they genuinely show remorse that would be sufficient. If they dont, then expel them. If they didnt show remorse, I would suggest there is also something wrong with the parents."

It seems the better your WiFi coverage, the more chance of things working. I would setup all the bulbs in the same room you have your router in, then move them to where they will go. I would also check the WiFi signal strength in the rooms you intend to put the bulbs in. Any weak signals may mean you have problems with bulbs in that room. This advice is of course mainly just conjecture, however I think the better the WiFi signal, the more chance of a trouble free experience."

A personal preference, I prefer the lifx light strip over the hue strip. It's way better than the hue.There are plenty of YouTube videos doing side by side comparisons that you can watch. Since you mention using switches and sensors, lifx may not be an option for you.

Another thing to bear in mind, for the light strip you MAY need a diffuser for a cleaner look."
