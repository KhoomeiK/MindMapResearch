Asking my mom to make his favorite dinner and inviting him over. 

Asking my parents to get him Christmas/birthday gifts rather than gifts for myself. 

We're still super close, talking everyday and hanging at least once a month. He's doing really well now, fortunately. He's wrapping up his electrician apprenticeship, has awesome girlfriend and adorable cat, and hasn't spoken to his toxic parents in two years!"

It should seriously be illegal.
