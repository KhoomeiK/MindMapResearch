Dakimakuras,ffh1hoa,t3_eiohd2,1579920584.0,"Edit: I decided to grab either one of 2 dakis of Atago after much searching...I need help with finding a way to order them. The first one is from [BWstore](https://www.bwstore.com.tw/index.php?action=product&do=prd_detail&id=1046). It says the order date was a couple of years ago. Is it too late to grab this now? 

The other option is [this one](https://bakaraoke.up.seesaa.net/image/20180205_075031690_iOS20-20E382B3E38394E383BC.jpg) but the only store i can find is [mercari](https://item.mercari.com/jp/m48235701030/?_s=U2FsdGVkX1_2GCn2sPEUdK0SBSlm_1h-B-BSxe1zcJTWJ9Y7ut_cFQlQC7upyfgdJjWI5NCq5EIqO8w4awMrpzHPFJ5eQkD_Zdojt2yK2O-MFtdMgIGmHwG78tdAC4Si). Never heard of this store or any mention of it on this subreddit so im not sure if its a potential bootleg. Would anyone know where/if i could grab any one of these 2 dakis?"

It looks like this :S"
Guitar,ff4ks38,t1_ff4jz1r,1579566006.0,Hmmmmmm i’ll look into that then. Thanks for the suggestion
Guitar,ff4iokw,t1_ff2nqb3,1579564546.0,"Its a jackson js22, strings...the normal ones? I just started and the guy at the shop changed the strings since the out of box strings sucked. But i didnt think about getting thicker gauge strings at that point. 

Also, i have to play with the track. I like the whole experience lol"
Guitar,ff4ijuu,t1_ff2myn7,1579564458.0,Sweet thanks.
Guitar,ff2mahw,t1_ff2f8vh,1579512985.0,"Yea.... i dont have too much extra haha, so i think maybe i can change my strings so i can do drop C, and then i could capo the strings to be able to play standard. That should work....right?

Live performances, maybe i will look into a second guitar then, so in a year or two or more lol"
Guitar,ff2m85z,t1_ff0cvb6,1579512883.0,"Drop D isnt bad, but my low string buzzes a bit. Its tuning everything else down a half or whole step thats the problem i think. Seems like a lot of songs i like are either in drop C or drop D, but still quite a few in drop D flat haha..."
Guitar,ff2m5zw,t1_ff0ap4c,1579512791.0,"That would be easier, and i could capo so i get to standard tuning right?"
GuitarTone,ff05ku9,t1_fem9c8d,1579465415.0,"I dont use much gain. Like maybe 25%. 

For sure, need to study both."
Guitar,ff01ylx,t3_dr29s1,1579464363.0,"Been playing guitar for about a month, there are so many songs i want to play but are in drop D flat tuning or drop C tuning. I know that downtuning an electric guitar makes it so the strings can buzz since the tension is less. So should i buy a sepedate guitar, specifically that has the thicker gauge strings for drop tuning? So i can play in both standard and drop tuning?"
Tabs,fewnedy,t1_fes0z7f,1579415671.0,Thank you so much!
cats,fdh31ge,t3_eldcbp,1578414303.0,Ugh i hate it when that happens. Look everywhere and then you finally find them in the most dumb place...
Animemes,fddtzwt,t3_ekryhp,1578323936.0,Nice job haha
GuitarTone,fdcur1b,t1_fclddse,1578284881.0,"I don't have a piano at the moment but i know what you mean. Ive been working on my speed with changing my fingers, its slowly improving. Ive found tutorials on youtube that mentioned exactly what you said. 

Yea im trying to train my ear. First i tune without a tuner and see how close it is. And keeping time too is important so i have a metronome app that helps out. Thanks for the advice. Still practicing!"

GuitarTone,fckpsrx,t1_fc9qon8,1577730570.0,All good. No problem actually i found myself just playing on clean more than anything while i try to learn how to play. Just going from an E chord to an A to a D is hard enough fast so I’ll worry about djent stuff when im better haha. Thanks though
cats,fckf0b8,t3_ehm9r9,1577723855.0,Adorable!
cats,fc2peaq,t3_efrdkl,1577370025.0,Aww she looks adorable!
GuitarTone,fc0cnxk,t1_fby9e5a,1577287022.0,"That would be great! I’ll give it a try but I’m pretty bad at setting up my amp. I just started learning so I know I shouldn’t be in a rush to find that tone I want, at the same time it’s a point of motivation. If you wouldn’t mind showing me your setup, I’d appreciate it."
