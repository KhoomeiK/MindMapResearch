Most guys will first give a girl a compliment before introducing themselves to a girl. If the girl isn't interested in my invite I walk away hoping I at least made her smile because I would love it if someone for once walked from across the store to give me a compliment.

And don't make it about physique either. If it feel weird getting random boob compliments, I can promise you it feels weird getting a random ""jacked"" compliment. I have feelings too and I too like to hear that I have a nice smile or eyes, not ""nice body"" or ""what does your [chest] tattoo say?"""

I had to quit a good paying car sales job after one sale. Her name was Velma, and she was your typical tv show smoking white grandma trope. She was open about past drug use and talking to her was evident her mind was beyond repair. She has been experiencing friends and family commiting suicide from age 11 to 3 years before I met her, first being older cousin, last being brother. She was in such decline she had a dedicated social worker and only enough credit to finance a Snickers. No matter how much I tried to steer the conversation back to the Rav, she would talk about her entire life and all the hardships. But the way she talked was clear she wasn't looking for sympathy or even someone to listen, she told me those things because it truly Sparks no emotion in her anymore that she now considers it casual conversation. I used all the information she gave me to convince her she needed that Rav4. My finance manager had to spend 3 hours jumping through hoops but he got an approval. The next day her social worker came to talk to me ""you know the state she is in and you still sold a women with no income on government aid a car? Where's your shame?"". All I could say was I'll get my manager for you. Idk what they said but he kept coming back and I was always his first point of contact. I quit one month later, I have enough memories I can't forget.

I usually just fill a pot with water and stock, then add a 3:2 ratio of teriyaki and soy sauce and finish with seasonings.

I don't really use measurements since I've made teriyaki chicken A LOT but when boiled, it's hard to over do the flavor.

Cut up breasts in rough strips and dump in til cooked. Cut them to size once they cooled down and prepare some white rice.
