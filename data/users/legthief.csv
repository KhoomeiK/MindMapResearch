TrueFilm,fe392mp,t3_enhaw7,1578847136.0,"I have yet to see Knives Out but have seen everything else. I watched The Brothers Bloom in the run-up to Last Jedi's release and was highly anticipating it, perhaps expecting too much from him because of how great he's been from day one.

Last Jedi is a fair movie with some issues, and I suspect there was a strange push and pull going on between the freedom he was given as writer and the expectations/limitations on him as a helmer.

Jedi is his only movie not created from inception solely by Johnson and I think it shows. He understands humanity and emotion but tends not to trade in sentimentality, which makes all the 'woes of the galaxy' and 'power of love' stuff in Jedi come off as pretty false, like a lousy Doctor Who script or something.

Brick, Bloom and Looper all present a pretty unified and compelling ethos that the world is cold and will eat you up if you let it, which Jedi partly echoes, and that to me seems like rather a poor fit for Star Wars.

So Jedi was a misstep in several ways, a bad fit perhaps for him and for the Star Wars 'brand'. Johnson is however a singular talent, with a distinct narrative style and a super solid base crew of collaborators who follow him from project to project, so I'm convinced Knives Out will be great and he's going to continue being a real wunderkind in the industry."
