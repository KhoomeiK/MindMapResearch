I'm not shutting out other ideas here, but I actually really like my plan. I don't want to pay $400/mo in taxes whether I use the system or not. I'd rather put $400/mo into tax free savings and use it as needed.

Indoor ranges are less than ideal for learning. Find an outdoor range or the woods or something. The last thing a learner needs is all the constant noise, the brass hitting them from the neighboring lane (yes this happened to me last time I went to an indoor range), people watching you, tacti-cool dudes and being the only woman in the place... It's not fun. It's high pressure, and very easy to get self conscious. Find a nice outdoor venue with good weather.

Other things that are great to do - go find a cheap spinner target that you can plink with a 22. Also, set up huge paper targets that are easy to hit. Just do stuff that's focused on having fun, laughing, that kind of thing. I've done this with my kids and they all love shooting."

So he's out in the desert and he meets this total babe named Zipporah, but home girl is black.

So God is like, it's cool Moses, marry her she's a total babe.

So Moses marries her and they have these kids that are mixed race. So then Moses is like yeah that's what's up.

So then Moses' sister is all like, dang Moses why you gotta marry a black girl, can't you find a nice Jewish chica?

And before Moses can answer, God shows up and he's like yo Miriam, I know he's your little bro, but he's my boy too. Better back up off him.

And Miriam is all like dang, but that's like mixed race and stuff.

Based on some of the more popular young Earth creation accounts:

* Dinosaur bones weren't put down magically. [Dinosaurs and humans coexisted.](https://answersingenesis.org/dinosaurs/humans/why-dont-we-find-human-dinosaur-fossils-together/)

* Fossils aren't fake, they're observable of course. However, the way the data is interpreted is what changes. Basically creationists assume a real worldwide flood took place, and because of that, the [geologic column](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/rock-layers/sifting-through-layers-meaning/) takes on a different meaning.

* Carbon dating can't be wholely trusted because of [faulty methodology](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/carbon-14/radiocarbon-dating/) - according to Wikipedia it's [only reliable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating) back 50,000 years at best.
