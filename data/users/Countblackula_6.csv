retailhell,fdroiiv,t3_emph7d,1578687362.0,"This shit pisses me off so much.  I worked at a gas station in 2005 when a regular pack of gum cost less than a dollar.  I actually had a crusty old hag try to pay for one, a single pack of gum and nothing else, with a $100 dollar bill.  The store policy stated we wouldn’t accept $100s for any purchase under 50 bucks.  She lost her shit when I explained this and asked to speak to the manager who thankfully had my back.  So I say to all customers, if you need to break a $100, **GO DO IT AT THE BANK ASSHOLE!**"
