breastfeeding,fe1x16y,t1_fe1w5hh,1578831883.0,"We had issues with oversupply in the beginning too and it completely resolved itself by 6 weeks. I now produce enough for her and hardly ever feel engorged anymore. I didn’t pump at all until 3+ months and this helps your body to know exactly how much your baby needs. I did use a silicone pump to catch my letdown and to relieve engorgement before 6 weeks though, so if you don’t use one already, I would highly recommend it. 

When my oversupply stopped, I was worried that my milk dried up because my breasts didn’t feel full anymore. But we are now 6 months EBF and I’ve never not had enough milk."

What has always helped me to alleviate social anxiety and feel more in control, is to prep 5 topics for small talk beforehand. These can be anything from the weather to recent events, news, movies, series you enjoy, nostalgic things like food or toys, music, etc."

dogs,fdx6a8g,t3_ena0sf,1578765729.0,"This is fairly normal behavior, but you need to manage it to ensure that your puppy isn’t intimidated or threatened. Some dogs do this to exert control over their environment, and to establish who is the pack leader. 

Don’t scold your older dog, instead reward him when he allows the puppy in his space. It’s also important to give your older dog a safe place where he can escape from the puppy."

socialskills,fdpuc0f,t3_emncha,1578640805.0,"Don’t email. Ask him out for coffee and tell him then. Most managers will get the idea that it’s serious immediately. If he asks, just tell him that you have something to discuss with him. Once you’ve discussed it with him, send an email with your formal resignation letter. It’s important to be able to prove exactly when you resigned. 
EDIT: I just saw the other commenter’s post, and I totally agree: email and ask for a meeting / coffee. I meant don’t email your resignation letter without talking to him first."
dogs,fdjvb9w,t3_elmrg3,1578488688.0,"So sorry for your loss. He looks like he was a super dog and will be sorely missed. What helped me when I lost my pup is to talk to other people about him, sharing funny stories about things he did, etc with people who knew him. It also helped to talk to him in that almost-asleep state of mind, especially if you feel it’s necessary to apologize for anything. I’m not saying that you do, but I lost a pup to a horrible allergic reaction and although I did everything I could to save her, I still felt that I failed because she couldn’t be saved. And it really tore me up inside until I talked to her in my semi-dreams and apologized. 
Hope this helps you. Allow yourself time to grieve. And always remember him and what he meant to you."

It gets better quickly. Soon your baby will want to go out and have adventures."
