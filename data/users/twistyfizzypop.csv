BreakUps,ff9g7g3,t1_ff9fh10,1579712337.0,"If it makes you feel better while you're healing, go with it. It doesn't help me to be honest. I did treat him well, the week before he left me, he was telling his mom how amazing I was and how he'd never had it so good. I already know *she* (his ex-now current partner) is back to her old ways with a few short weeks. Getting into rages when she doesn't get her way or something threatens her fragile ego. Berating his friends and family on social media. And he's going with it, backing her up. So it's up to you, what can you cope with? Personally I am struggling with the idea that if he came back I'd be able to trust him. But I miss him and the kids so much. I miss the life we had, all the adventures and the fun stuff. All the places we went together and the things we shared. I miss the lif I thought we were going to have too. I'm so lost."
BreakUps,ff966mf,t1_ff94s3f,1579705779.0,"The problem is that I felt almost as bad before them as I do now, and had done for nearly 24 years even with therapy, medication and trying all the stuff which is meant to sort you out like the gym, healthy eating, yoga, going to work, progressing in a career, ""faking it till you make it"" I feel like I am done. In the last hour or so my anxiety has calmed down so I'm not as on the edge as I was but I don't feel anything like okay or good or fine. I feel like I haven't done for 2/3rds of my life.
I know you are trying to help, and I'm sorry but I feel like I have tried so much with no improvement. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of trying and not making any progress, not being able to enjoy anything. The breakup, the subsequent abuse from him and the kids mom has definitely impacted me for the worse, I didn't used to have anxiety this bad for one thing, but before he and I got together I was done. I'm almost back to what is my normal and it's hell."

I'm not a serial dater, and if I were to go to bed with someone it would be to make myself feel more disgusted with myself, which is something I used to do. I miss the life I thought I'd have.

I am going to the gym and doing yoga, trying to do mindfulness, not drinking, only taking the drugs I am prescribed, going to work still. Talking to my friends and trying to reash out but it's still getting worse. I've started to idolise suicide. I can't take much more of how I feel"
BreakUps,ff910mz,t3_esb5ly,1579702126.0,"It depends on if the ex of your ex has actually changed or not. I'm in a very very similar situation. We just came back from an amazing holiday abroad and were planning what we were doing as we were having his kids stay with us for Christmas and out of the blue he tells me that the woman he couldn't stand a week before had told him she'd changed. She is an abusive narcissist. But he let her break us up in the summer too. And I took him back.

It's been almost 6 weeks for me and its not getting any easier. I feel like she has taken everything from me. All my hope, everything that kept me stable and made me feel human."

survivorsofabuse,ff5hj3n,t3_eria45,1579593145.0,"This sounds like you have a firm of ptsd, which happens after repeated traumatic experiences. People in or who have left abusive relationships can have this, it's not just soldiers etc. I would suggest having a look at some resources online and if you can afford it see if you can get a therapist who specialises in helping people with ptsd or who have been in abusive relationships. It is incredibly difficult to move on from and heal when you have ptsd, because things which shouldn't trigger the flashbacks will trigger them.
I do not have this myself, although I do have anxiety and panic attacks it doesn't compare to what you have. What helps me is mindfulness (there is an app called Stop Panic and Anxiety) meditation and rituals/religion. These also might help"

Next day I got a similar text from my ex saying I had upset the youngest because I was slagging them off to her and using her as my therapist. Obviously none of that was true.

My best advice is to try and get the best grades you can so as soon as you can you can move out. Make friends with people where you can, and explain that you have *very* controlling parents so when you are at home you cannot communicate with them.

I have therapy anyway for my anxiety, it's NHS so not as often as I'd like but she has helped me when I saw her last as well. 4 weeks and 1 day for me. I have to get through the day till I can just sleep. That's sort of how I'm getting through the time that I'm not numb."

So I am of the same opinion here, it's a naked photo of someone which is sexy. You might feel hurt and you'll need to explain why to him but it's not cheating. Flirting might be in some people's opinions, snogging I would say is, so anything up from there."
