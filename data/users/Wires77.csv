Wondering if the 10% mod on the new influenced armor would be enough for bosses with it, too"

pathofexile,fekqb13,t1_fekosh2,1579205396.0,"The great thing abhor this game is that you can build an evasion character that ALSO picks up those nodes, just like the marauder and duelist can pick up a ton of evasion.

If you really want them to be the same, pick up iron reflexes and call it a day.  You can get way more armor that way than a strength based character can.

Builds are supposed to be unique in this game, and everything has tradeoffs.  And everything but ascendancy classes can be used by any character, so just go for it!"
