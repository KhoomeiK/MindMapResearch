My first experience w the “internet” was when I was maybe 9-10? One out of the prob 15 members of my extended fam knew what it was. My family members had ages ranging from 8-80. My uncle was in his 20’s?

There was a crowd around the computer and he explained that you could visit different pages to get information on all kinds of things. I remember being distinctly disappointed that “surfing” the web turned out to be an activity that required only sitting and reading. 

My uncle explained early internet to my whole fam. Fast forward ten years. The younger people from that group are still guiding the older group. We were all introduced at the same time, but the draw to younger people was greater. 

Fast forward to now: my gramma can hardly use her Hulu but insists she’s the only one who knows how to use it."

PurplePillDebate,fei0694,t3_eozc4v,1579127432.0,"I’ve always thought it funny that TRP pleads to nature as foundational to their arguments. I must know, at what point can an impala hunt a lion instead? What can you teach the bird who simply can’t dance like the “alpha” in order to get him laid? Everywhere in nature we see that, if we treat the “beta/alpha” model as a given, the betas simply don’t “become” alpha. Or at least the chances are extremely low. Even simple math dictates everyone can’t be “alpha”. 

So what kind of ramifications can we expect when a cohort of neckbeards decides to start adopting the most superficial aspects of “alphas” (Alpha being at least partly defined by the *lack* of effort/awareness required to hold such regard) in the hopes that they can defy their naturally limited place in the social hierarchy? A bunch of people imitating sociopathy can’t be good for anyone. A bunch of people imitating any archetype w the expectation that they’ll be treated like a king is a recipe for mutilated psyches.
