Showerthoughts,ff6ejfj,t1_ff5xd1x,1579625473.0,"I remember my trip back from upstate New York to DC surprisingly well on September 9, 2001. I went up to New York for my nephew's baptism. On my way back Sunday evening, I had a layover in Philadelphia. As I was waiting for my connection, I stopped at a Hudson's Books, and saw a large piece of luggage unattended. Having traveled to Europe several times, they are really strict about unattended luggage. I waited a few minutes, and noticed no one approached it, so I went to the cashier and asked her is she knew whose luggage that was. She didn't know. 

A couple of minutes later, I saw a security guard and told her that this piece of luggage had been sitting there for about 10 minutes and no one had approached it. She goes into the store, and with a big booming voice, announces ""Whose luggage is this?"" A man in his 50s dressed in a suit came up to her and said, ""It's mine."" She responds, ""You know you are not supposed to leave luggage unattended."" ""Yes, I know.""

I like to think that the security guard, the businessman and the cashier never forgot that moment considering what happened 36 hours later."
