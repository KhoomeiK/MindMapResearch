I also recently felt like I was loose after sleeping with my partner for the first time but I realized it’s not me that’s loose cause I’ve never felt like this in my other relationships. Not gonna lie his dick was not the right match . So gurl listen to  this ^^^^"

relationship_advice,fdu7lla,t3_en2psv,1578728979.0,If anyone sees that your son has bite marks they will report you to child services and police will get involved that is abuseeee! And to make it worse you know that your husband is BITING your CHILD and didn’t report it. You will be facing charges .

Assistance,fbxkl3q,t3_eexs0o,1577191810.0,Not gonna hold back but cannabis would be perfect. You feel amazing after but stay home and responsible when you plan to smoke or eat edibles. And yeah watch a show I promise you this will not fail.
