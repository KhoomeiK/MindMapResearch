If your pH is fluctuating by a lot then you should stabilize it.

Most of the overall water test kits (e.g. API master test kit) have a KH and GH test. It would be best to get one and test all your water parameters. Or you could take a water sample to your LFS for testing. I suspect your KH is very low, but I would always suggest testing the water before you do anything.

Like a few other comments said, adding crushed coral (or limestone, or dolomite) will probably help rectify the problem. Below pH ~7.4 it will slowly dissolve into the water (faster at lower pH), increasing the KH and GH.

This does not directly raise the pH, but rather carbonates netralize acids and help to stabilize the pH. Coupled with regular water changes, this is probably the best option."

>Adding power to U.S. NPDs has the potential to add up to 12 GW (12,000 megawatts or MW) of new renewable capacity—a potential equivalent to increasing the size of the existing conventional hydropower fleet by 15%. A majority of this potential is concentrated in just 100 NPDs, which could contribute approximately 8 GW of clean, reliable hydropower; the top 10 facilities alone could add up to 3 GW of new hydropower. Eighty-one of the 100 top NPDs are U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) facilities, many of which, including all of the top 10, are navigation locks on the Ohio River, Mississippi River, Alabama River, and Arkansas River, as well as their major tributaries. This study also shows that dams owned by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation hold the potential to add approximately 260 MW of capacity

canada,ff4zeap,t1_ff41hh9,1579576140.0,"That is a very complicated question to answer.

The efficiency of an air-source heat pump is a function of the difference between the outdoor air temperature and the indoor air temperature - becoming less efficient as the difference becomes greater.  
The efficiency of the power grid depends on where you live and the mix of power sources in the grid.  
The efficiency of your natural gas furnace demends on its model/age.

You could probably make a Master's thesis out of answering that question, but generally it will be more efficient to burn natural gas in your home for heat than it will be to burn natural gas for electricity, transfer it across the electrical grid, and then convert it to heat.

However, talking about efficiency is not really the point of the article. It is exploring how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in provinces like ON, QC, and BC where the electrical grid uses very little fossil fuels and so household heating with natural gas accounts for the largest share of GHG emissions. The idea is that in a modern well-insulated home the use of a heat pump supplemented by electric heaters can be a feasible alternative to a natural gas furnace.

It is possibly a little misleading when I said its efficiency can be over 100%. The thermal efficiency of the heat pump will always be less than 100%. However, under favourable conditions the amount of heat transferred by the heat pump can be greater than the amount of electrical energy input into the heat pump. If you define efficiency as the ratio of useful work done to the quantity of electrical energy input, then efficiency can be over 100%.

Turning the heat back into electricity to power the heat pump would not work. Heat pumps become less efficient with large temperature gradients (i.e. when the exterior temperature is much higher/lower than the indoor temperature). This is why heat pumps are most efficient in the spring and fall. Conversely, thermal power generation (such as a steam plant) requires a very large thermal gradient to be efficient. A heat pump cannot create the large thermal gradient needed to efficiently generate electricity."

>Many countries such as the US still have huge coal reserves that they have no reason to exploit 

I have a problem with the use of the word ""reserves"" here. In mining the word ""reserves"" means that it has been conclusively proven (usually through an NI 43-101 technical report) that the mineral is economically feasible to extract at a profit. What you are talking about is a coal ""resource"" meaning that either it has not yet been proven feasible, or it has been found to not be feasible at current/expected coal prices.

This goes back to the comment that started this thread. Most of the ""low-hanging fruit"" of mineral resources has already been extracted. The coal that remains is either very difficult to mine, or is low-grade lignite that is only suitable for use as thermal coal. If humans were to die out and another intelligence were to emerge on Earth, they would have difficulty finding metallurgical-grade coal and would therefore probably not be able to reach the iron age. Without iron they would probably also not develop the steam engine, and would therefore not have much use for thermal coal."
