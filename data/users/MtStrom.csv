The rich will stay rich, only that now there are arguably two classes of wealthy people while the average person is still left behind. Many (if only a relatively small portion) will keep desperately trying to find the next moonshot, thus blindly falling for scams or investing in future ghost projects, which makes the wealth gap even wider.

It's not a catch-22 without two contradictory conditions that result in the circumstance being inescapable. No such conditions are present here. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about, so your confidence is astounding. 

>And 2, By using terms such as ""fragile **masculinity**"" you are **inherently** taking about men *in general* not to mention the fact women don't have identical terms.

Besides, your premise is a strawman; calling something fragile masculinity does not imply that all men exhibit it, nor does it imply that women can’t act out similarly. It’s simply pointing out a trait that’s more prevalent in men, and can be attributed to conditions that pertain more to men (testosterone, traditional masculinity not being conducive to opening up and sharing your emotions, leading to repressed feelings etc.).
