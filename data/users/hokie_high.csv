I can guarantee you with nearly 100% accuracy that in 10 years you will cringe when you think back about your extreme leftist phase the same way you cringe now when you think about awkward moments you had during puberty.

This is a phase, you‚Äôll grow out of it and I‚Äôm not wasting my time arguing with a kid in a phase.
