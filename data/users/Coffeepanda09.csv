He's obviously not attracted to you for *you* (you have to be WEARING something sexy for him to be attracted? Wtf), he's also uncomfortable with things about a woman's body (yeast infection comment), and he basically is wanting you to sacrifice your comfort for his comfort - not okay. Sorry he's been like this with, but in a year, it will most likely be worse - more things of this nature will pop up. I'd tell him your concerns about his comments and behavior, see his behavior and reaction and that should tell you everything you need to know."

Pets,feipe7d,t3_epav98,1579143925.0,"It really boils down to quality of life, instead of quantity. Even if it's a short amount of time, if he still has light in his eyes and the things that he used to enjoy still make him happy, he may have some time left. Last summer I had to decide to say goodbye to my dog Dio, he was 13 and went downhill quicky due to CHF and kidney disease, so it was fairly obvious to me when he was ready, but it definitely wasn't easy and I looked to the doctor I worked with to guide me the right way. His blood work told me how bad it was. But even before that, in the few days before, he had lost any kind of light in his eyes, he was just existing. I knew it was time. I work as a veterinary technician and honestly, sometimes cost is the deciding factor as well. I'm sure you love your pet dearly and have given him a fullfilling and wonderful life. In the end, what I tell owners at work, is that they'll know. Pay attention and you'll know when it's time. It's never easy though, it will be a hard decision."
