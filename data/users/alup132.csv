Along with apparently feminine speech patterns online (probably picked up because I mainly texted girls since I got my phone when I was 12, which I won’t say my age but it was between 6-10 years ago) I have seemed like a girl to some. Usually they don’t care, but it was really weird to hear that the first few times. This is in a game where there’s no voice chat."

ShittyLifeProTips,fe4ho7l,t1_fe4dp7d,1578859436.0,"Yeah, I didn’t mean in this situation, but in some states (In America, unsure about other countries) a minor could trick an adult (Say I’m 20 and she’s 17 and it’s in a state where there’s no Romero and Juliet law) and say they’re  overage, and you could go to jail. She/he could have a fake ID saying they’re 19 when they’re 17, and you could still go to jail in some states, as intent or knowledge doesn’t matter. It’s considered negligence. I don’t agree that it should be considered a crime since you were tricked, but my point still stands."

tifu,fe3uhh2,t1_fe3oe3n,1578853015.0,"I only recently turned 20, and I’ve seen a girl who was 17 on my brother’s Instagram, in a bikini, (he was showing me posts and handed it to me to scroll) and I dropped the phone quickly. He told me she was 17 and a YouTuber, and I thought she was my brother’s friend and therefore 15. On the flip side, I’ve had 15 year olds who I see photos of online and think they’re my age and they look good until I see a post about their age, and then I’m grossed out. I think it’s only a issue when you know they’re a kid, rather than thinking a kid is older than they are, if that makes sense. 

I do know a dude who’s 20 and follows a lot of 14-15 year old girls... that’s definitely something that makes me uncomfortable. Though, he’s a really creepy person in general and is creepy around women/girls as it is."
