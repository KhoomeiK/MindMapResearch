technology,fd6asqk,t1_fd66tlt,1578188138.0,Yeah I can see how C would be easier if you got some architectural basics first and wanted to learn about the relationship between your code and the operating system and hardware layers. Java is easier to pick up if you want to abstract some of that away. Unfortunately I think Java students learn to lean on boilerplate.

Whatcouldgowrong,fcudzgm,t1_fcubpxh,1577978716.0,"Brakes aren't designed to resist the power of the engine, they are designed based on the weight of the vehicle and its load. Emergency braking against a throttle is way outside the realm of normal operation."

Whatcouldgowrong,fcu6vpi,t1_fcu5jej,1577973984.0,"Stuck accelerator is different than normal out of control scenario. On most cars you don't need to even press the button on the shifter to bump from drive to neutral. Relying on the brakes to kill throttle is dangerous, you may lose control if you brake too fast and you may overheat the brakes if you brake too slow. Check out the study the DOT did after Toyota had that stuck accelerator issue."
