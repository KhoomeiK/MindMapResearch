Idk if something went wrong while they were setting up, or if they just had not figured out how to perform live yet. But I remember my friend showing me one of their songs a few weeks later and me just not understanding how that was the same band I had seen.   They of course have since gotten much better at live shows since. 

Another good one was I saw this guy Adventure play at something called the “round robin”. It was where like 5 bands had set up in a semi large space and each one would play one song so you’d end up running to see each band. It was a lot of fun and I liked adventure a lot. I saw he had a show at a local college in a few months so i got tickets to see him. We are excited and when we got there, there was a pretty decent crowd. When his set was up, he comes on stage in all black, a little drunk, and starts playing ambient noice. Everything he had put out prior to this was chip tunes/indie. Everyone was extremely disappointed, and a few people asked if he could play one of his other songs. He tried...failed...then just walked off stage after 15 minutes. It was honestly one of the weirdest shows I’ve been to. I get it that people change their sound, but this was a HUGE departure from what he had done before and there was no evidence he had done this.  Everyone at the show was bummed."

I'd say if you enjoy the netflix show you would LOVE the old adultswim/WB streaming show.  The biggest differences between are: (1) the netflix show is serial story, where the adultswim show was episodic; (2) the episode length, Childrens was a classic 12 minute adult swim show; (3) the main cast was larger, as you can see from the few episodes that throw you back into the hospital.

I am almost done the netflix series now, and I think I liked the old show just a bit more.  Still awesome to see it revived like this.

After this rewatching I kind of wonder if Cobb tried to/pulled off one more inception.  When Cobb makes his way back to get Saito in limbo he Saito has already been there for years (possibly 40+) and has all but forgotten he is dreaming.  Cobb then has to reminds him that his world is not real, similar to what he did with Mal.  Though Saito almost cuts him off and adds to it that he has to honor their deal (a idea that came from himself) and to do that he has to wake up.

Seeing as how the deeper you go the more easily inception happens was this a driving force in why when he woke up he imminently made the call.  Saito might have already been broken by living in limbo for so long, but this one last idea was planted in his mind making sure Cobb was a free man at any cost to himself (honoring the deal).

personalfinance,fcu1m7u,t3_eiwmst,1577969532.0,"My understanding is 90% of banks are garbage, if you want good service you have to go to a credit union. I don’t use my own advice though and am still with a big bank that treats me like garbage. I essentially just use them for direct deposit of my pay check, paying bills, and taking cash out on the rare times when I need it. 90% of my purchases are on my credit card which I off every 2 weeks.

I am in the middle of moving some of my money around. The end goal is to have most of it at an investment bank, with about 5-10k at any point in time at my regular bank as “0 risk, oh shit my XX just broke and needs to be fixed, emergency fund”. I also plan is to eventually have about 1 year pre tax salary in the investment bank in a moderate but low risk mutual fund."

television,fcrm087,t1_fcrfdk5,1577903564.0,"I agree it dragged a bit.  But also it was one of the few shows where I actually cared about the b story line. I feel like a lot of shows now will have an A, B and C story line, an all I really care about is the A one. This show has a few things going on and I was thoroughly  interested in all pets."

dataisbeautiful,fcohmyg,t1_fcnfjce,1577832442.0,Also I wonder when a bias from watching the same show sets in. Like after 6 episodes the average rating might start to go down as you don’t want to watch it.

funny,fco6rsh,t1_fco5co9,1577825155.0,I always saw them as a toy or teaching aid not for water safety. They are about as safe as a pool noodle or a kickboard.
funny,fco6kgz,t1_fcnmnxf,1577825046.0,"hmm...makes sense.  But I also see them as ""pool toys""/teaching aid not a safety instrument. From what I can remember using them as a young child it was a way to help me float around and essentially learn to kick.  If I was ever in water that was in anyway deep my parents were there.

My parents also took swimming/water pretty seriously.  When I was maybe 7 or 8 we were at the shore and I got taken by the rip tide.  My mom swam out and got me, and that weekend started weekly swim lessons.  I was essentially in the pool at least once a week until I was 11, than 5 days a week until I was 15.

tldr:  They are toys or teaching tools not for safety."
DIY,fcnursz,t1_fcn8o54,1577818828.0,That last picture just made me say “some of that has to be trash” lol. I know I am guilty of storing things I know I’ll never use just because I don’t want to have to rebuy it in like 100 years lol
DIY,fcnuhj3,t1_fcnm7s2,1577818666.0,"Like you said, your shelves are probably sturdier than what I am about to recommend. Though IKEA makes these really cheap pine shelves that are always popping up on Craigslist for free or close to it. I think they are called Gorm. 

My parents have a few in our basement that have been there for over 20 years. I picked some up to use as cost effective/industrial looking shelving in my apartment. I have since gotten another 4 just from people moving out at my apartment complex. Turned one into a tv stand by cutting it down, and the other two became closet organizers. 

They are honestly my favorite thing ikea has ever made. The only downside is I think they recently scaled them down so they are not as useful (to me at least)."

gadgets,fcl4375,t1_fckzz86,1577739370.0,"I bought a cheapo our on amazon, didn’t like them. They lasted 4-6 hours on a charge. I use my headphones way more that 4-6 hours at a time. I see people at work with nice ones (air pods) and they are constantly taking them out to chArge and switching to usb ones. They have 2 pairs of headphones with them at all times. It seems like a step backwards to me. 

That being said I did get a nice pair of Sony over ear BT ones and the battery is bonkers. I can go 3-4 days without charging easy. Though they are considerably more of a hassle to bring with me places."
