MurderedByWords,fd5v8xt,t3_ejouz2,1578181920.0,"I think what grates on me most is that little jab at the end, “Isn’t it pathetic?” Like it’s already happened, a done deal.

...Donald. Buddy. That’s like someone justifying being angry at their spouse because they had a dream that they cheated. The scenario you’re criticizing doesn’t exist in reality.

Well, now it does, but it wasn’t Obama who did it. It was you.

How’s *that* for pathetic?"

Best decision I ever made. Trust me, whatever hell she raises over you leaving, don’t let it get to you. If you’re out, stay out. You’ll be happier that way."

You decide what to do with your life. Not them."
