OnePiece,ff5jhzf,t3_erk5ff,1579595798.0,"Luffy is trying to reach Kaido, but the 3 calamities are blocking his way and Doffy is chasing him. As Doffy corners him, blood comes out of his mouth and he collapses. Behind him is Katakuri, retracting his mochi mace. He then gives Luffy a thumbs up, which Luffy reciprocates before he chases after Kaido. The 3 calamities then try to pursue Luffy, but Katakuri stands in their way as Luffy chases after Kaido. A black and white flashback plays to when Luffy had defeated Katakuri and they talked. From afar, Kaido fires a beam in his dragon form to obliterate Luffy, but he uses G2 to dodge and close the distance. When Luffy finally reaches Kaido, Kaido swings a few times, and Luffy dodges yet again, before finally going into G4. Kaido, intrigued by this, transforms into his hybrid Zoan form and charges Luffy. Luffy uses his Gomu Gomu no King Kong Gun, and Kaido uses his Thunder Bagua to block it, then keeps charging at Luffy. From his other hand, Luffy fires off his advanced Haki blast, which hits Kaido and crushes his insides, causing him to be blown away and defeated. Meanwhile, from Mariejois, Imu is watching this battle and cackles evilly. Sometime later, Luffy and Katakuri are seen watching the sunset at Wano before the scene fades to black. While this entire sequence is happening, One More Time by Kotono Shibuya is playing."
