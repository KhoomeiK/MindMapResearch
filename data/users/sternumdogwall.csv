To drop off our shitz stu Oreo who we have have had for 7 years. Our one year old, and him had a rough go of it this past year. It was torrential down pouring,  huge puddles. At first i could feel the water pushing up the carpet, but we have rubber mats on top. So i didn't notice the water at first. When we stopped at Oreo's new forever home i took a look under and the carpet was hanging down under the car. That was a rough night for us, not gonna lie."
