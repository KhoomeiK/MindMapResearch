Yes I've added vet to my list, thank you. Based on others I will also try: switching out the water dish, giving her sleep spots to choose from and catnip.

A kitten sounds so lovely! I worry about picking up a second cat and having it be a yowler (the one at my mom's house yowls in the middle of the night when she comes to find us for cuddles) though. I know all cats are different."
cats,fh7vzia,t1_fh7nrgj,1581346161.0,"I didn't think to clarify - we've had her since October, so it's been around 4 months. I didn't even realize it had been that long! She's 8. Her waking me up has gotten worse as time's gone on. It used to be a 4 am thing, and I'd acquiesce and wake up with her so she wouldn't wake my son up, and so I could have that alone time. Now I feel like she's bugging me on and off from bed time to morning time. 
I will try giving her a spot on the bed, a spot on the couch, and a spot in my room juuust in case one helps!"
cats,fh7vo52,t1_fh7o4yc,1581345929.0,"Her food, water and litter are all upstairs actually. I have noticed she doesn't like the water dish she came with - one with a filter and a little water tank on top because my grandpa often left for a week or two to visit family (someone checked in on the cat). She seems to prefer sneaking drinks from our cups. I'll try switching out her water dish. 
There is often a throw blanket on the couch. I'll see about leaving a 'kitty spot' in the living room, and my room, to see if she takes to either of them. 
I hadn't considered a vet check, thank you, I'll add it to my list.
We try playing with her. She doesn't like the laser pointer, or dangly toys on a stick, or bells in balls. For moments I may have seen her play with a ball or mouse, and a christmas bow my son left on the stairs.

I really appreciate the thought provoking response, thanks!"

Parenting,fh6uyfs,t3_f184r6,1581306754.0,"Your situation reminds me of my ex-grandma-in-law. She is a lovely lady in a retirement home. She surprised me one early on visit by telling me that her first child was still born, then she got pregnant right after with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and soon after with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. She said something to the extent of, ""By then I felt like I'd been pregnant my whole life!""   


The exact words don't matter.. it's just the situation that I got to glean. How her past self must have been so elated, then so heartbroken, then so terrified during her next pregnancy, then so amazed, but also mourning..   


There must have been such intense sorrows and anxiety. Then 50 years later, all that turmoil has been boiled into a quip about how damn long she had to be a pregnant lady for. No watery eyes while speaking of her loss, time had stripped down the pain until it was just another fact of life.  


So, I hope time will soften this situation for you as new stories take the place of the-story-that-could-have-been."

Entrepreneur,fguro3r,t3_f09b6s,1581127865.0,"So I started off figuring out how to make a keepsake product that no one else had. And it's nice and lovely, but I have to build out the market for it, because the people who may like it don't know it exists! My market was parents - either buying keepsakes of their kids, or their parents.  
I wanted to make other things parents would buy - like custom puzzle boards and name signs - but didn't because there were sooo many established people doing it on Etsy - and how would I compete? Plus, they're already doing it.  
But then someone asked in a local group for one, so I made it.. and then someone told me to post to FB marketplace. I have had consistent orders for 3 months now, which is pretty freaking awesome.   
I wanted to avoid doing the things everyone else was doing online, but in the end making what everyone else makes - and focusing on local (so much less pressure than Etsy) has been the best decision I made in business."

It sounds like you need to harness the power of The Alter Ego Effect - which is a legit book you can sign out from the library. It's basically for helping to build out the alter ego tactics that people use, and science backs as being helpful.   


People put on glasses to feel dignified and like they should be taken seriously. People, in turn, trust people in glasses more. Dress for the job you want sort of thing, except it's about building out a character you can step into, that has clear lines of how they would react to situations."

People need to be so clear when talking about the police to kids. I remember one looking for advice on how to explain the son's father was in jail. Someone said, 'tell him dad did something bad. tell him dad hurt someone and has to go to jail for a long time. but keep it vague' and I just - *No!* 

Those are the EXACT phrases people use with children, they say, 'Johnny you did something bad. Johnny did you hurt Tommy?' So then you're going to make Johnny flipping terrified that any 'bad' or 'hurt' he causes is thus going to put him in jail for a very long time."

Etsy,fgupu4n,t3_f0e54l,1581126645.0,"Nope. A customer who's returning because they love your wares/product and service doesn't need a discount.   


The only discount I give is when someone came for a return order on something I had upped the price on, and I appreciated she was coming back for two and the price jump would have been quite unexpected for her. She thanked me and said she completely understood the price increase.  


I sell the exact same product as someone else in my makerspace and find a stark difference in our stories. I price my name signs higher than she does hers. I find she's always mentioning customers asking 'if I order 2 do I get a discount' and 'you gave my neighbour a discount, why didn't you give me one?' and 'how about I order and you pay for shipping' 'ship me the order and I'll pay you when I get it' .. and you know what.. we've both been at this about 3 months now, and ONCE have I had a customer ask me for a discount, I said no, and they ordered anyway.   


It seems to me that her lower price and discounting (since we're doing everything local via FB Marketplace) is a magnet for trouble. Our price differences must sift out different types of customers."

What I found so insightful is that she literally didn't mean any personal harm by it. She clearly wasn't thinking at ALL about the parent, or life with kids, or any of that context. All she saw (like all anyone sees) is a tiny snippet of a moment, in a vaccuum, without any context.  


I thought of that when I would judge parents for taking little kids to a fast food place, and then I was sitting there with my toddler at a fast food place, but with the invisible context that I was dead burnt out and dad had just tried to steal kiddo a few hours ago.. or something stupid and insane like that.

It does not say: Guelph wants to have 0 dog parks.  


And it is quite a valid complaint if the houses around the dog park all have to listen to dogs barking and owners yelling from 7 am thru til midnight, every single day. No one would want to sign up for that, so there's no reason for the comments that are trying to degrade and blame home owners."

I love my son to bits and pieces, but in December and January I got these tiny tastes of alone-time and it finally hit me (like a brick in the face) how insanely freaking hard it has been, and I never even noticed. It's all technically been up since leaving my ex.

Teach her that it's natural to have multiple emotions at once:  
I love you *and* I miss mommy.

Give her new things to say in place of 'I don't like you':  


I don't like *when* you only read me two books at night. I don't like *how* fast bedtime is with you. I don't like the -bedroom- *at your house*.

Well yeah, compared to kids a couple decades ago, you really likely haven't. There's not a lot of exposure to role-models using skills, or opportunities to practice new skills, or reasons to develop grit.  


Life is certainly more child-friendly than ever, but it's also very, very safe, and convenient. Your toys and crafts arrive assembled, or practically so. You don't make any of your own toys - and your parents probably don't know how to make things for/with you.

Also, when I do sometimes pick up my son, he used to explain that that meant my back didn't hurt, or he would worry that I shouldn't pick him up because my back hurts.

I didn't realize, it was something about them learning to stick with things when they're older. Maybe I shouldn't have binged the book oops!

In that case, maybe he is partially more in the Flow at daycare and ignoring for that reason. 

My son also attempts to hit or kick me sometimes, and when I ask him why, he confirms it was for attention. 

This week I've started trying to name the type of attention as being Disciplining Attention or Focused Attention/Presence, in an attempt to help him 'see' that there are different types of attention and they aren't all the same, or the style he was hoping for. 

If he isn't chatting past 3 words very often, you could try (if you aren't already) to fill in the communication blanks for him. 'Did you say say no because you were trying to say ---' 'Do you feel sad because ----' that may not be the best advice but I think it's all I have! Good luck!"

My son just turned 3 and has been speaking dictionaries for a long time, but I think he's outside the norm for speech. His same age cousin also speaks a lot, but half the words are hard to discern - especially if she's excited.

6. Tell all the adults the boundaries and expectations you have for your child, and how they can help. Agree to compromise on some, because I get it, I do, but one evening every now and then of your kid getting spoiled isn't going to ruin them for life, or even for a week."

Next year, learn from your attempt and ditch all the hard work. For kiddo's actual birthday, since he didn't want pizza, I was going to bread chicken strips myself.

No, No I don't.""

-Whole brain child (an easy scientific understanding of a child's brain development, or lack thereof)
-The big disconnect (parenting in the age of technology, I didn't think I needed this, but I'm so glad I read it) 
-Discovering your child's strengths (focusing on what they excel at, their interests when they were young, and springing out from there)
-the subtle art if not giving a fuck (because it has a focus on splitting responsibility down to what is and isn't in your (or your son's) control )

Entrepreneur,fev8rgi,t1_felbnhf,1579394449.0,"Yes! People may not want to accept it, but it really comes down to your upbringing - the networking and opportunities it links you to, and whether you were raised to have grit, to ask questions, and to take advantage of your opportunities, and timing as well. 

It's not even about the parents being Wealthy sort of connected either. But some connections, or their own obvious grit, or that key upbringing that positions a child to assume he can affect his world.

As a side note, I can't tell you How many people lately have told me that they're so impressed at how I fearlessly ask strangers questions for my son (or more accurately, I encourage him to). Or always how 'intelligent' my son is (just turned 3), but really they are just impressed at the knowledge he has, because he gets to indulge his every Why. It's really not a unique intelligence, just the results of a parenting choice!"
Entrepreneur,fel9k89,t1_fejpu50,1579217037.0,"No for goodness sakes, read Outliers. It is NOT about intelligence. That book even covers the dude who is likely thought to be THE smartest guy on Earth, who literally couldn't cut it in college, and the fact that he isn't successful but others far less intelligent are. It comes down to upbringing and opportunities."
Entrepreneur,fel9bmo,t1_fejotrh,1579216882.0,"Bill Gates wasn't extremely smart though, he just got to start putting in his 10000 hours for programming before most other people had the opportunity ! Yes he had to be motivated and gritty enough to take advantage of his opportunities, but still, he only got to get paid to program in highschool, because he had a highschool that he could code at in the first place."
Entrepreneur,fekyhet,t1_fejd5ek,1579210226.0,"One of the most critical connections was that his highschool got new time share computers when they were brand new, and most universities didn't even have them! His friends also found a bug that let them program for an unlimited time instead of one hour each. Etc. there was a point where an important University was just a bus ride away so he would go and program there as he pleased."
Entrepreneur,feky6dq,t3_epf6sm,1579210044.0,"Yes!!! When I learned about bill gates in the book Outliers I was dumbfounded. The media definitely makes dropout successes sound like they kind of failed out, or couldn't cut oit. Not like they already had years of mastery in their field!"

The first step is looking at how you talk about your interactions. You say he was Difficult. You say you are Enduring it. You say he is Throwing a wild fit.  Why is that?

For example, I'd say of my son (also insanely colicky as a baby): He was always in a lot of pain. We are having a rough day with a lot of big emotions, partly because --- (overstimulating event, he is exhausted, long busy day, etc). When he is unconsolable, if I can't help him via distraction then I've just got to be patient. 

See a difference? And I'm no perfect parent. The other day while settling down for quiet time, he hit the cat, and because -I didn't know how to react- (which is why parents totally flip and try to harness control instantaneously), I got up and said book time is over and it's quiet time now and shut the door. This was a HORRENDOUS idea because I couldn't work and he was just hysterically upset and half the time trying to  one out of his room.

So I thought about it while it was happening - this doesn't feel right, what actions may have met all my goals and also prevented a meltdown? So I picked steps for next time  then I apologized to my son and said I am still learning and didn't know how to respond, and I told him my plan for next time. 

The Whole Brain Child book teaches us that a child's brain really is not developed, and that there are tantrums where a  good will stop if they get what they want, and then there are tantrums the child cannot stop. I can't tell you how often my about to be 3 year old will be in hysterics, and then he will say Mom how do I stop crying? Mom I don't want to cry. Mom can you calm me down? 

A key takeaway I've been thinking on, from a book about abusive men though, is that in American cultures the men will 'lose control' and there's always a point where they give themselves permission to' - but it's not universal across all cultures! So I acknowledge and examine now the point where I LET myself lose patience and react authoritarian, or unsympathetically. And as with my earlier example, I find it is because I don't know how to react, or I don't know how to quell the emotions and I am very mentally tired or stressed out."
Parenting,fehk88s,t3_ep2nak,1579118238.0,"Don't be surprised if it goes over his head btw. When I was younger and my family was staying at a friend's house in the country, I woke up and one of their barns had burned down over night. I'd slept through 3 fire trucks (they were in the middle of 3 county lines), the adults, the barn burning, and all the poor animals who had passed away. Thinking about it now, I mostly just didn't get why the adults were all do distracted and didn't want to stop to talk and play some game with me.   
Kids can be funny like that!"

Today my son (almost 3!) was like, ""I am going to hit you in a mean and not nice way.""   
and then he lightly thwapped my leg and announced, ""I hit you in a mean and not nice way!""   
""Okay. well if you hit someone in a mean and not nice way, you need to sit on the stairs for a time out.""

getdisciplined,febzllr,t3_eo2gsf,1578964617.0,"It's easy enough to remember: If you could change your life over night, you would have done it already!   


I've really found the most important thing for me has been reflection and planning tied together.  
Want to eat healthy and feel less stressed? I gotta track what I'm making, when I'm going to eat what I just put in the freezer, and what I'm making tomorrow. It just takes a minute a day, but you have to remember to do it, and then check it.  


Want to feel less overwhelmed with my toddler/work/life balancing during the day? When I plan out my priorities the night before AND THEN CHECK THEM THE NEXT DAY, that helps a lot!  


Want to feel like a balanced mom? I have to check back on my day/week to realize that I Did do lots of kids oriented stuff, or I forget it all and think I'm a horrible mom lol. It's all look forward, look back, look forward, look back."
DecidingToBeBetter,feb1xdu,t1_feafpyo,1578954703.0,"I think those first 2 sentences show that you are conflating love with caring, and not loving with giving up / not caring.  I'd just like to point that out, for others who may do the same to their detriment. Perhaps unintentionally you are even confusing Love with Being A Healthy and Caring Individual

I do not love my ex in the least. For a long time I did not love him, but I still cared then, and care now about him. And I still would always want him to find a positive path in life, and sort himself out, and have the best life he can, and get a new girlfriend, et  etc. And he was an abusive prick, I'm just healthy enough to know that wanting the best for him is the best for everyone in his life."
DecidingToBeBetter,fea73ct,t1_fe5mjl2,1578945117.0,"Careful now! Just because someone still painstakingly wants to lay out your problems for you, so you'll get help (or be your own help) does NOT mean they still love that person (in the way where they want to be with them). That kind of thought could lead OP to be really caught off guard if his wife does indeed still want a divorce.

   
Trust her words - if she says she doesn't love him the same way anymore, she doesn't.   


Also, OP, please do Not make your wife responsible for guiding you through how to be better. A good portion of getting better is just learning to take the responsibility on being introspective or reflective of your actions. You could offer to include her as a sounding board in your self reflect po-wows, but don't make her lead your charge."

Parenting,fdvvfiy,t3_en2lwc,1578751950.0,"Im going to add here to read Why does He do that. It is about abusive men and sums up that their problem is entitlement  and that abusive childhoods do not mean abusive parents and that's just an excuse. Dad's who abuse mother's to do tend to lead to (edit: when their sons grow up:) husband's who abusive wives though. 

 Read that book. He will tell you time and time again that he is trying to improve, or maybe he's done some counseling, but it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT for abusers to stop abusing. Mainly because they don't see themselves as abusers.

Also while you are with your mom, jus clean cut contact with him for a month or more. Not a punishment. You both need space. You also need to see if he will respect your need for space.  You also need to see if you realize (perhaps while reading that book!!!!) if perhaps his behaviour towards you has also been less appropriate than you realize. 

And whatever you do, no matter how good he behaves, do NOT drop the police report."
