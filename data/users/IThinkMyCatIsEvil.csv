Advice,fdq0sn2,t1_fdq07kb,1578649204.0,"I donâ€™t think refusing or accepting therapy is going to deprive anyone else from getting it. Why do you think you donâ€™t â€œdeserveâ€ it? Is it because you think youâ€™re fine and donâ€™t need it? For what itâ€™s worth, I think it would be beneficial, even if youâ€™re not in dire straits. 

Itâ€™s interesting that the reason you donâ€™t want to go to school is because you know you wonâ€™t be accepted. 1) How are you so dead sure, to the point that youâ€™re shutting it down before you even try and 2) why is â€œacceptanceâ€ the deciding factor you donâ€™t want to go to school? Just something to think about, or maybe potentially talk about with a therapist.

Not receiving a commission from Psychologists United or anything lol! Just my two cents. Hope all goes well for you whatever happens!"

Advice,fdpzuwr,t3_emofe6,1578647886.0,"Iâ€™ve been to therapy and they definitely do NOT just tell you what you want to hear. Mine was actually pretty hard on me, always calling me out when I was victimizing myself, and always encouraging me to stop using excuses or evade responsibility for my actions. I often leave there feeling gutted but with a whole new outlook. One of the most valuable things I left with is how to look at things from different perspectives. 

Of course, thatâ€™s just my experience. I also donâ€™t know what your needs for therapy are, or if you had bad previous experience with it. But if Mom is paying for it, why not give it a try?"
