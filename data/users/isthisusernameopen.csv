60daysin,fdet5pf,t3_ekzutl,1578346072.0,"Omg I came here to say Rappahannock Regional jail too! I’ve done a police ride along in Stafford and I saw the most ridiculous things. This would for sure be a good season

Edit: Hell, I would volunteer if they did it in Stafford"
offmychest,fdejpop,t3_ekwobo,1578340476.0,"Take a picture of that wanker!!! Bless your soul, the world needs more people like you"
offmychest,fde1h8m,t1_fddtc3q,1578329046.0,"This right here!!! Agreed! Look your issues right in the face like you’re about to fight and accept it. You will feel so much better! Honesty is the best policy in your situation my friend. Just be honest about everything. You have to try. It will suck for a bit man, life can really beat your ass but I promise you will persevere. These problems are not bigger than you and they’re not you. It’s a situation you can make better. It’s a learning lesson and doesn’t depict how the rest of your life will go. How many people have you heard about with tough upbringings that made it out and are stronger and happier now? Sooo many people. You are not a failure by any means. I’ve done the same thing as you boo and I made it! I grabbed my problems by the horns and took care of business as best I could. It was a slow ride but I’m glad I pushed and I want you to push through too"
offmychest,fdbkkuy,t3_ekeomu,1578258229.0,"Wow!!! You are incredible! So awesome to hear from warriors like you. Keep it up! I’m your new biggest fan!

Edit: thank you for your service!
*sorry, i pressed send before I was done"
offmychest,fdbgsjm,t1_fdatylm,1578257218.0,"It was like an out of control grease fire! I swear it was like a nightmare! She said something about me not liking cops and how they’re getting killed more than black people.....that comment was wild because I said nothing of the matter AND my uncle was a black cop that was murdered! So NO I don’t hate cops!!! I still cry about losing my uncle. 

Also asscanoes is the best word"
AskWomenOver30,fd6behg,t3_ejw1n6,1578188396.0,"I feel really bad for her. She’s the one that’s trapped because she has a kid with that wanker. You’re on a month to month lease, just pick a goal date to move out and focus on just staying away from the filth so it doesn’t make you sick or feel trapped. You can get out of this! This was a brief visit to Hell and back. It’s not your place to address your landlord’s boyfriend. Are you prepared for him to be both filthy and an asshole? He may want to retaliate or night have ill feelings for you afterwards which would make your living situation even worse! You don’t want to do that. You gotta weigh the consequences on this one I think. I’m so glad you’re not stuck there for an entire year lease though! Whew! I mean I would honestly just verbally ask him to pick up the toilet paper but I’m perfectly fine calling people out in a kind way. Make a joke about it or however you think he will receive it well. Best of luck"
Assistance,fd4hg12,t1_fd3k0x0,1578167465.0,Yeah and once you realize you CAN push through these situations will become easier to deal with. Happiness is not a forever state of being or state of mind which is really something to think about. Try to take some lessons from this and reward yourself for the victories especially since you’re graduating early!!! Good job bud!! You’ll be better off than them and everyone else your age that’s not mature enough to be the bigger person. You’ll see someday that they all probably envied something about you. I’m a woman so I can say this but females in groups can be fickle haha I have been. Seems like men don’t really deal with shit like this
Assistance,fd19sz4,t1_fd11mla,1578128919.0,"They sound like a gaggle of rude, stuck up people. Unfortunately, you will encounter people like this through every stage in your life. It has happened at work for me where people are grown ass adults that act like they’re in high school. They’re awful communicators and they don’t deserve to take up space in your mind. Kick them out of your head. Super happy to hear you will be able to move out. You have a ticket out! That is a big step!! Someone once told me during a time when I felt like there was no escape that for the time being I needed to live (in my head) where I want to be...hope is a powerful emotion. It was such a shitty time for me and it didn’t get better quickly. It got better in small doses but I realized that’s only because I was putting in a little bit of effort. It sounds like you’re putting forth effort to improve your life which is commendable when you’re feeling like hell. You’re on the path to true happiness, my friend. The roommates aren’t great people that you want to be lifelong friends with if they can’t keep their word. Hoping you may have a friend nearby where you can crash sometimes. Even once a week would help

Edit: I realize it may sound like I’m putting everything on you but that’s not it. You’re the best person to make this better which you know. You’ve exhausted all of your external options. You reached out to your roommates and they acted childish. Give yourself time to heal from this trauma. All I’m saying is you are almost at the finish line, keep pushing all the way through then keep running"
Assistance,fd1059g,t3_ejtwur,1578126138.0,"You have to make a plan to move out. Your situation won’t get better if you don’t make a change. Change can take time though and during that time you will get to know yourself. You learn how much you can take, you learn to fall and get back up (like you mentioned you have). 

It’s a real shame your roommate situation sucks but my advice to you is to make be very best of that situation. If that means you need to have a kumbaya with your roomies to find common ground then you should make a plea. Whatever you do in life just be kind to yourself and everyone. 

I feel your pain from here because dammit if I wasn’t there in college. I had to kick out a roommate because she was so destructive to our home. It caused a huge issue with our landlord and her parents and my parents but fuck if I didn’t feel much better she was out the house. I got a much better roommate and I had a better home environment to work on myself and my depression. And before that, I would spend as much time outside my house as I could. I went to the gym every day which helped me get healthier, went the library to study which helped my grades, walked everywhere even to the grocery store, took random strolls to smoke a blunt, volunteered, took an internship and eventually took two jobs but only worked like 20ish hours a week. Find your passion and your light at the end of the tunnel. Hope this helps!!"
amiugly,fcvlm7o,t3_eiu53r,1578004735.0,"You look fine, you should do the wolverine style chops though. That would look super cool. Other than that, everybody can improve from hitting the gym as often as you can. Shoot for 3x a week then go from there. Best of luck and happy new year!"
rant,fcncxff,t3_ehup20,1577809029.0,Did anybody else immediately drink water after reading this?
offmychest,fcn9tsu,t3_ei3gdu,1577806930.0,Awww! You’re so sweet. Happy New Year!!!!!
offmychest,fcmlzpt,t1_fcm66qo,1577780925.0,"Same here. As we approach 2020, I look back to one decade ago when I was graduating from high school and I didn’t think I’d make it this far. I’m 27 now and I want to live longer. 

OP, if you feel like it please check out Buddhism. Not saying to become a Buddhist but listen to some podcasts, maybe read a couple books if you’re into that. I hope it helps you as it has helped me. Everyone commenting here cares about you"
60daysin,fcd0mn9,t1_fcal0xo,1577604897.0,"Funny how people are downvoting your comment. I agree with you, it was 90% a race thing with Yaz. Not because Tami is a police officer or because Barbra is a conservative military wife but because they’re both just trash even with Tami’s improvement. They knew why they hated Yaz. Like how were those two the only ones that had an issue with her? Suspicious. They both hated her because she was intelligent and black. Tami was closer to some white chick that stole her shoes and kept her up at night with ruckus than Yaz who didn’t step on her toes purposefully. Some of you should read that last sentence three times"
