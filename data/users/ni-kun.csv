HistoryMemes,ffjuuqk,t1_ffjulbe,1580007583.0,"as i said it depends on:

-if the would be dictator had any military support

-if whoever was part of a broad coaliltion

-the nature of the nation's contitution

and maybe also

-what nation would do the intervention"
HistoryMemes,ffjtg42,t1_ffjss1i,1580006474.0,"Of course i would not approve of a facist being elected in my homenation, then again without military backing a coup it would be unlikely that he/she would be capable of subverting democracy and without a contitutional change the damage they could do would be rather limited especialy if whoever it was came to power through a coalition... so a intervention would probably not be necessary.

>Yes he was elected democratically. The Nazis won the plurality in 1932. 

No. Sure they were the largest party but the weimar parties and the communists still had more seats total [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_1932_German_federal_election)"
HistoryMemes,ffjs3pg,t1_ffjqgg2,1580005439.0,Nope that's a common misconception. He was appointed as reich chancellor by President Paul von Hindenburg not elected. Hitler's party NSDAP did not have enough seats to form a government alone. He then used the reichtag fire declare a state of emergency and abolish the reichtag.
