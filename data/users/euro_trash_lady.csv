SkincareAddiction,ff2z1gy,t1_ff27ctx,1579529150.0,I had a similar issue. Would get red pimples and irritated spots that would scar when I consumed any product made from cow's milk but didn't connect the dots. Ended up getting diagnosed with an allergy to casein in only cow's milk. No issue with goat or sheep's milk... Took a while to narrow it down with my doctor but once we did it's been life changing.
