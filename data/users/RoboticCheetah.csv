HVAC,fddyuyu,t3_ek98jh,1578327299.0,u/ContagiouslySalty as promised. The ignition rev sound sound we hear is just the furnace lighting all the burners. They did find that the furnace short cycles and there for adjusted the anticipator. They also found it was off by 3 degrees due to not being level.  All fixed and now stays on longer than 3-4mins.

Love the Iowa Hawkeyes :) HUGE fan !
Ohio girl here . Thankfully it‚Äôs been a mild winter so far here.

Ok one last thing  so I grabbed my SO out of bed  (lol told you I was worried) and had them go down to the basement to look at it. They said that rumble happens when the flames kick on."
HVAC,fd807mr,t1_fd7z4f7,1578212388.0,I will. Thank you for helping . I will talk to them about a new one as well. I know they offer financing and offer Lennox furnaces (hopefully those are good) . I‚Äôve looked at them on their site.  Currently it costs about $150 to heat a month during the winter so I‚Äôm going to try and spring for a more efficient one if possible.  I think rn now I only have a 60% efficient furnace.
HVAC,fd7y2c5,t1_fd7w5ro,1578211724.0,Haha. I come up with some pretty interesting and laughable descriptions. No I haven‚Äôt. tbh id have 0 idea what to look for. I know how to slide in and out a furnace filter and that‚Äôs it. Dictionary definition of a newbie .
HVAC,fd7v5io,t1_fd7ucg6,1578210605.0,"This is a rumble like if you revved  an engine just once (several times before realizing it was the furnace I thought it was my next door neighbor who revs his mustang constantly..then I started noticing I‚Äôd hear the sound and then a min later the furnace would kick on through the vents) 

idk another way to describe it would be like shaking a cookie sheet to make a thunder sound if that makes any sense ?"
HVAC,fd7ub0q,t3_ek98jh,1578210215.0,I don‚Äôt understand why it turns on and off all time time either . I keep the house set at 65. I‚Äôve timed it and 6cph seems like a lot but from what I‚Äôve read is the default for this old thermostat. I guess in my mind if the house it already at the set temp why does it need to turn on again ?
HVAC,fd7tk10,t1_fd7t299,1578209882.0,Thank you . We‚Äôve been looking into getting a new one . The one we have heats well but these sounds have me scared as I am a carbon monoxide poisoning survivor. We have a detector and it‚Äôs reading 0.   Looking up what we are hearing on google and YouTube could it possibly be a delayed ignition as well or no since the light stays on at all times?

AskReddit,fcpmfm7,t1_fcplzyy,1577867480.0,"Lol. I‚Äôve been here 2 yrs already (on main) . FB messes with my anxiety because there is no privacy. For example, I just had someone I worked with over 10 years ago find me last week. I was shocked as to how as I don‚Äôt have any personal photos on my account and my name has changed since working with her. My acct is locked down with no identifying info other than my name so I asked how she found me and she said it was through my parents and sisters accounts . I didn‚Äôt even know she knew their names. The level of stalking she had to go through to find me was unnerving . On here I don‚Äôt have to worry about that."

AskReddit,fcpiuac,t3_eic8yl,1577865391.0,"No. 

I filed chapter 7 that yr. Every. Single. Day. I had to talk myself out of killing myself. Every day.  I couldn‚Äôt afford clothes or food. I starved and weighed under 100lbs. Partially because I couldn‚Äôt afford food partially because eating felt like the only thing I still had control of. I developed an Anxiety disorder and PTSD that I still deal with today. 

Now.. Now I‚Äôm married.  I have my dream job that pays really well. I make almost $30/hr without having a college degree. I wake up everyday wanting to go to work and excited to be there. I see how every single job I had before led me to this one.  I own my own home as well as a truck and a car.  

I still have anxiety and I‚Äôm still learning how to live again instead of going through the motions but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt give up."
relationship_advice,fcpg6sd,t3_ei55b8,1577862563.0,100000% looking for a way out . What you have here is a boy not a man. A man would have ended things in a proper way with a real reason even if that reason was he simply didn‚Äôt want to be in the relationship any more. As much as it hurts he did you a HUGE favor. Now just don‚Äôt ever go back. You are worth more and deserve better than this man child .
