i haven't used the knuckle buttons on the elecom, tho it has them.  idk if ill be able to differentiate left click, left knuckle, or both at the same time/around the same time, as with right knuckle/click.  i used the first four buttons on the elecom thumb side, and the circle button on the bottom--unfortunately my thumb isn't quite long enough so i have to constantly shift my grip to press the circle button (mapped to reload) and back to click the abilities.  

the swiftpoint z looks a lot like the elecom, thanks for the suggestion! maybe if i can get used to the knuckle buttons, might be the one i get. otherwise maybe the corsair since the corsair has the side buttons and its adjustable in its position of the buttons (but i dont love the yellow or blue :/ tho the LEDs are configuarable ) 

the knuckle buttons on the elecom are very un-pronounced so i feel like pressing them is only detectable when focused on whether im pressing them or not, same with the three right side buttons (plus the way they hang off the side feels like they're going to break, and they dont really click, almost squishy but not quite, sorta like a membrane vs a mechanical switch keyboard, or more like a scissor switch from a laptop keyboard feel. i guess they kinda click but not like the regular left right mouse clicks"
