NoStupidQuestions,fezqtp0,t1_fexeki3,1579460488.0,They also take long core samples of layers of earth/ice in small cylinders and pull em back up to check out changes in temps and atmosphere and all that. Pretty interesting
SluttyConfessions,feolixu,t1_fen7uew,1579301865.0,Definitely. Definitely looks like boobs.
AmItheAsshole,feft86h,t3_eoley4,1579064484.0,"YTA. I am behind what everyone else said here. You're deluded to think $1000 is a ton for a wedding dress. You have the money, you both contributed to the budget. Who on earth raised you?

Wish? WISH??!!

Good cover when posting on one of the most popular subs, she definitely wouldn't see this..."

AskMen,fe6m1v6,t3_enuqco,1578895486.0,"Hmm. The persona of a ""nice guy"" depends in friendzoning, I think. The whole idea that someone is entitled to romantic interaction simply for being interested/""nice"".

Idk if it's how the question is worded or what, but I certainly anticipated more interesting answers than we've gotten here.

college,fe6i5t2,t3_enwpsm,1578891654.0,"Man I have tried these calendars. It fails for me cause I need to know what's a head more than a week in advance. Like, if like to keep an eye on the paper or presentation or project that is due, so a week by week isn't realistic for me, but I do wish it was, it seems the easiest.

And tbh now that I think about it, maybe it is, cause to be fair I'm not usually anywhere near more than a week ahead in my thinking/planning  even when I know I've got bigger projects. ðŸ˜‚"

AskMen,fcoh5a0,t1_fcn3d2e,1577832109.0,"It was abuse. Part of the manipulation is you feeling unreasonable and doubting it was. You know it was.

That's how pervasive mental abuse is. It makes you feel absolutely crazy, that it maybe wasn't that bad. But those moments where you're certain it is abusive behavior is enough to realize that the small things were too.

It's not a fun road, the self-doubt and lack of self esteem and identity is agonizing, but it's far better than the previous situation. You know that. Best of luck to you."
AskReddit,fcn2l67,t1_fcn12dg,1577801502.0,"Yes. It was a last minute idea.

I understand buying in bulk is cheaper. But for someone that just wants to make a few candles on a whim I don't feel like the savings, if any, outweighs the effort it takes to make em and the quality you're not getting. 

The ones we made didn't smell at all, even after adding scent to em."
AskReddit,fcn0gxn,t1_fcn01ua,1577799639.0,"I've been there many times. For the size of the candles we made they would only be slightly more at Yankee candle, and smell miles better, burn longer, etc.

It may be an exaggeration to say 10, but it's really not a big deal. $6.00 candles do exist"

AskReddit,fcmgvcj,t1_fcm3s73,1577774777.0,"Hmm. I'm suspicious of this one.

My sister and I made candles one year for Christmas. We spent nearly $80 on supplies. Without counting cost of decorations it was probably $60 for jars, wax, scent, and wicks.

Could have bought 10 candles for the price it cost us to make 6."
