In the last season Wesley Crusher began his training with The Traveler and there has been no follow-up since then.  Considering his fame from appearances in The Big Bang Theory alone, Wil Wheaton would also likely be welcomed back and even be the main protagonist of the series.  It could pick up at any point and take almost any direction considering very little is actually known about the Traveler."

The primary reason most people don't listen to Climate Change experts is because of the method they use to get this information out.  They use fear mongering.  Just like they have for the past 30 years or so.  They make outrageous claims that the world will end in x number of years and then the research paper uses worst case scenario to get their point across.

Along with this, these changes that need to be made always come with tax increases and yet nothing is ever really done by the government other than passing legislation that increases costs and creates all new problems.  If you want people to listen, you can't expect them to listen to the same old song and game.  Yet for whatever reason, that is the only one they know."
