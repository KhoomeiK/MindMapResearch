BeAmazed,fd657qy,t3_ejy0r5,1578185694.0,"I met this guy at VidCon years ago.  Had a nice chat about what I liked about his YouTube channel and stuff.  What blew my mind is he remembered me and my friend the following year only by our voices when we saw him the next VidCon.  I rely so much on faces first when recognizing someone, it threw me off guard that he could remember a guy from a quick conversation only by voice.  Great guy."

todayilearned,fcskx7k,t1_fcrofaf,1577918680.0,Weird how everyone always points to Tien's third eye as a sign of him not being human when Krillin doesn't even have a nose.  Isn't Tien's third eye a reference to enlightenment in Eastern cultures?

television,fcneyrq,t1_fcmmvz7,1577810347.0,"Also once you get the DVDs, it's pretty easy to rip it to mp4 using software like Handbrake.  So you might not be able to stream it everywhere, unless you make a plex server or something, but you can at least save it onto tablets and other devices without optical drives."
television,fcnegqo,t1_fcmkndc,1577810029.0,"A lot of DVDs do that too.  There's a Play All option, and the intro is often a chapter that can be skipped.  Sure, you'll have to switch out the disc, but that's only once every 2 or so hours."

Pretty sure this was an anime/manga in the early 2000s.  The protagonists opponents marvelled at how the kid would pick up the stones like a beginner, but play like a master."
unpopularopinion,fc15t6k,t1_fc0xf57,1577309086.0,"Arguing semantics here, but despite its similarities, Shape of Water isn't The Little Mermaid.  Most obviously, because they have different titles, but more importantly, because they're 2 different stories.  It's not a genderswap because the switching of gender dynamics isn't the main difference between the two movies.  They're both their own unique, different films.  There's nothing to get up in arms about.  That's like getting mad that Carol Danvers is just a gender swapped Maverick.  She's not.  They're their own, individual characters in two different stories."

unpopularopinion,fc14eep,t1_fc13x4y,1577307939.0,"I think Idris would be a cool Bond.  I don't know much about the lore of James Bond.  Just that he's a British secret agent.  Unless the source material specifically states that he has to be not only British, which can be acted, but of a certain ethnicity, why would it matter?  Idris Elba just has to be a British guy, then he's James Bond.  He's already got the swagger and focus that a Bond needs."
