I love his way of presenting, the way he talks and how you can hear how much he loves the topic. He is just lovely to listen to. But the podcast is so detailed and there are so many episodes that I'm always a bit discouraged to listen to it, since he basically doesn't do stand-alones and picking up in between is difficult because the podcast is very chronological and episodes build up on knowledge of previous episodes. Without basic knowledge of english history (like me) it's just super hard to follow and understand whats going on when you skip an episde."

de,ff5mew6,t3_erqqz6,1579600127.0,"In der akademischen Wissenschaft ist das ja schon lange der ganz normale Alltag. Entfristungen für Wissenschaftler gibt es kaum für Positionen (ist man nicht Professor). Ein Vertrag für drei Jahre wird schon als lang angesehen.

Um diese Befristungswelle etwas einzudämmen und es wurde das Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz eingeführt. Kurz zusammengefasst: Ein Wissenschaftler soll nicht länger als 12 Jahre befristete Verträge bekommen. Die Idee dahinter ist, dass der Wissenschaftler nach 12 Jahren von-Vertrag-zu-Vertrag-hüpfen etwas festes bekommt. 

Tja, nette Idee. Praktisch gesehen bekommen Wissenschaftler nach 12 Jahren einfach keinen Vertrag mehr in der akademischen WIssenschaft. Bei mir könnte es sein, dass ich demnächst einfach von meinem Job gefeuert werde, obwohl ich bestens qualifiziert bin, gute Arbeit mache und meine Chefs mich alle behalten wollen. Aber mein Arbeitgeber (die wiss. Insitution für die ich arbeite) wird mir höchst wahrscheinlich keinen entfristeten Vertrag geben (wie die meisten Insitutionen). Ich werde also effektiv gefeuert. Und da ich die 12 Jahre voll habe, werde ich auch Schwierigkeiten haben mich an irgendeinem anderen Institut zu bewerben, da ich dort ja auch entfristet werden müsste und das wird nicht passieren.

Es gibt noch ein paar Schlupflöcher die 12 Jahre zu verlängern bzw. nicht nach Ablauf der 12 Jahre direkt gefeuert zu werden, aber wie das mit Schlupflöchern so ist, ist das alles nicht ganz so easy und schon gar nicht garantiert, dass es funktioniert.

Alles ganz toll und traumhaft."

It was a bit of a shock for my mom and me (both the daughter and marriage bit) since they had been together for almost 25 years and you'd think a previous marriage and a child would have come up at some point in that time. After he died it was our task to find her and get in contact with her for the testament etc. Really sucked, on so many different levels. (The daughter was nice enough, but it was just too late and not the right time to develop a closer relationship with her and her family)

Also, after his death sorting through his things, my mom basically discovered through letters of and to him, that he had been an incredible private and secretive person who had hid a lot of who he was from her. It weren't anymore shocking revelations, but more like she realized that he had kept a lot of his thoughts and feelings to himself, up to a point where she felt he had never fully revealed himself to her, but only had showed her one side of him and she never actually knew him. She knew he was person who had always held his cards to close to his chest and just dealt with problems and things by himself, not involving others, but she only realized after his death as to how close he had held his cards to himself.

Given what a huge influence and impact the Oscars have on audiences, personal image, popculture and obviously finances, the Academy should really do with an update on their voting process. Like for example, in addition to the votes of the members, they could do a sampling of a representative number of random people from the audiences and then add the votes to the members choices in a 2:1 or 3:1 or something manner. It would still give the members the majority but at least factor in what audiences liked. And I also quite like filmfestivals with juries who change every year. Sure, it‘s also an internal thing, but at least you get rid of some bias by having different people sit on the jury.

I‘m a neuroscientist and used to work in visual attention, which is basically a filter of visual information so the brain can process all of the information coming in. A lot of things are automatized and we see much more then we consciously perceive. I guess names are also to a degree automized but I‘m astonished sometimes to what degree (like even after several mails they don‘t get it). Maybe I should do a little study on this phenomenon. ;)"

But yeah, I also encounter misspelling occasionally and I recently had it that it turned out I hadn‘t received official emails for weeks because they had misspelled my name. :("

I usually don‘t bother too much as well. But it happens so much at work these days, the accumulation of it just really started to bug me."
