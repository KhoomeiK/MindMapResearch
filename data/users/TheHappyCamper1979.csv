Walking out of McDonald’s, drinking her coke , she tripped on a lady’s handbag strap on the floor .

Pregnancy does not excuse any behaviour other excessive eating and the likes . You’ve systematically spoken to your husband like some idiot for years . Only now can you see your actions over time have destroyed this man . I hope he heals from your mental abuse and finds a lady who will treat him like a king , and him her queen.
