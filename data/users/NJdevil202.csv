WeAreTheMusicMakers,ffg1i1l,t1_ffeuqh9,1579896422.0,"Very interesting.  I think you're kinda letting it go where it wants instead of giving it a direction to go in.  There's not really any central melody or hook in here, but it has potential to have them for sure.  The section that shows up at 0:35 and later at 2:30 has a lot of potential if you tighten up the melody lines, but the fact those sections are two minutes apart is kind of what I'm talking about in the first sentence of my comment.   


I dig what you're going for, but it's like you had so many ideas you couldn't pick which one to use so you used them all.  Just pick one and develop it, you'll get a stronger track."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,ffg10wn,t1_ffeqn9j,1579896130.0,"Super ambient, you're definitely nailing that.  This isn't my usual genre, so take this with a grain of salt, but there's not really any melody in there.  It's a great soundscape, but there's nothing about this track I can 'take with me', like I can't hum any part of it if that makes sense.  But again, this ain't really my bag in the first place haha, just what stood out.  The overall sound production sounds fantastic!"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,ffg0med,t1_fff8mpz,1579895885.0,"Overall very good.  You're definitely nailing that 80's pop sound.  I would suggest maybe moving that steel drum solo earlier in the song and getting a chorus in earlier (you don't have one until after 1:00).  Maybe swap the second verse with the chorus, put the steel drum solo after the second verse (so, verse-chorus-verse-steel drum).  That way your ending would be super strong, because it would go Chorus directly into that mini verse (so this is the part where I learned...) and then you hit another strong chorus.   


But production-wise its good.  I'm just being nitpicky with the structure, overall it's good"
