Here's a quick technical analysis of the market as a whole that illustrates the long-term trends:

Given the high run-up and long duration of the bull market, I anticipate the pullback to be the more severe of the two. I also expect it'll take 18-36 months before the market bounces back, with many stocks going sideways for a decade or two the way Microsoft and many others did following the .com bubble bursting.

https://www.moneyguy.com/2018/08/financial-order-of-operations-how-to-prioritize-your-financial-goals/

**Deductibles Covered**: You need to have enough money saved to cover basic emergencies  
**Match from Employer**: Everyone who has access to a retirement plan that provides a match should work to take advantage of that “free money.”  
**Credit Card**: The order of priority between employer match and credit card debt is a coin toss. Consumer credit card debt and punitive interest rates charged should be avoided if you are going to be on the path to financial independence.  
**Emergency Reserves**: You need to save three to six months of living expenses for a rainy day and the unexpected events that can make life scary.  
Roth and HSA Contributions: The thought of tax “free” growth is exciting. Currently, you’re allowed to save $5,500 per year in a ROTH IRA if you’re under 50. If you’re over 50, you can save up to $6,500.  
**Max-Out Retirement Options**: Retirement accounts are great for building wealth for the future. We share the max-out numbers for each type of account in this episode.  
**Hyper-Accumulation**: You should aspire to reach hyper-saver status by saving 15-20% of your gross annual income.  
**Pre-paid future expenses**: You need to make sure you have your retirement squared away FIRST and then prioritize the other financial goals you can prepay and fund.  
**Debt Prepayment**: The desire to be master of your financial life includes being completely debt-free. We share exactly how you can do this and how to prioritize which debts to pay off first.

Value investing. If you value a security, have a target price point chose, then you sit and wait until that target price point is met providing a large margin of safety.

And based form what I've seen from more notable youtubers, if you're on the other side of the equation with good content, but people aren't seeing it because the algorithm hasn't noticed you for some reason, then you're just going to have to grind for a while and do SEO and wait for the long-term growth to happen organically over a couple of years.

I guess my motivation comes from the incremental improvements I'm seeing with each video, like by adding the 2 items such as an intro and nameplate. Similarly, the lav mic and audio recorder massively improved the audio quality.

This is where Value Investing comes into play so you actually get fantastic growth. If you're doing it right you should be getting at least 15-20% annualized returns. 50% per year or more is entirely possible--I'm quoting Warren Buffett here by the way. He is 100% confident he'd easily be able to pull if off if he had less assets under management. Hell, I did [60% in my capital appreciation portfolio](https://m1.finance/v7K50FNaA) last year and [50% in my Roth IRA](https://m1.finance/luVkxq2aJ) that has a third of the portfolio specifically focused on dividends."

dividend_investing,fe0bebd,t3_enjqsp,1578808631.0,"I knocked it out of the park last year with my Top 5 combined with 33% in high dividend securities. The key is uncorrelated diversity (h/t Ray Dalio) and my ""secret sauce"": 

##*INTEGRALLY UNCORRELATED DIVERSIFICATION*

* Amazon
* Disney
* Apple
* Microsoft 

I know what you're thinking: They're not big dividend producers, in fact Amazon doesn't even have one yet. That's not the point, which is that they allowed me to heavily invest into dividend focused securities and still crack [the 50% annual return](https://m1.finance/luVkxq2aJ).

And by comparison, my [100% value investing portfolio did even better topping 60%](https://m1.finance/v7K50FNaA)! 

I digress. The key concept I wanted to really discuss is the ***integrally uncorrelated diversification*** of the 4 companies listed above. Each one has fingers in different pies and are largely in completely different markets from one another. 

When you buy Microsoft, you're not just buying a software company. You're buying an operating system company, you're buying an office software company (Office 365), you're buying a hardware company (surface laptops), and you're buying a cloud computing company (Azure). Most of those are completely distinct from one another.

When you buy Apple you're not just buying an iPhone company, you're also buying a iPad company, a TV studio, a streaming service, an Apple accessories company, and so on.

When you buy Disney you're not just buying a theme park company, you're also buying a cruise line operator, you're buying a film studio, you're buying a film distributor, you're buying streaming service, and so on. 

And then there's the king of integrally uncorrelated diversification: Amazon. You're not just buying Amazon the internet sales behemoth, you're also buying a data collection company, you're buying a hardware manufacture (the Fire brand), you're buying a cloud computing company (AWS), you're buying a large grocery store and now food distributor (they bought Whole Foods, remember?), you're buying an AI software company (Alexa), and so on. 

As [Ray Dalio famously said when discussing his Holy Grail portfolio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu4lHaSh7D4), with 15-20 uncorrelated assets in  your portfolio you can really minimize risk relative to performance. What I found is that you can largely achieve this with just those 4 companies listed above. That's what allowed me to ensure my 50% Roth IRA performed like it did while still being heavily invested in the high dividend securities I chose. 

Unlike picking companies that are one trick ponies who can dip hard when their respective industries take a hit, the big 4 posted above will only really suffer if the entire market  sees a correction as a whole as they're relatively immune to any one particular market  segment being negatively affected. Now that doesn't mean I don't recommend investing in other market segments they don't cover. In fact in my [60% portfolio](https://m1.finance/v7K50FNaA) I had 2 industrials and 2 financial asset companies to round out market segments the top 4 don't play in. My goal with them is that they were all at great prices when I bought and saw 15% or better gains since June. If any of the market  segments the top 4 are in dip, then I can sell the financials or industrials and ""buy the dip"", so to speak. I also have gold and a small dip into bonds to also hedge against wild market swings so I can have assets to sell and buy in major market shakeups. 

I'll make a video about this soon and dive into the numbers, but I just wanted to get people talking about this concept. [50%](https://m1.finance/luVkxq2aJ)  and [60%](https://m1.finance/v7K50FNaA) gains are the proof in the pudding."
