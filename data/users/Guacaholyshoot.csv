EDIT: I saw your response before you deleted it so I’ll respond anyway. Given, there are scumbags who lie about important things, like being raped. The way you phrased the meme, though, makes it seem like you’re accusing all feminists (people who advocate for equal woman-man rights) of being liars. Feminists aren’t feminists *because* they were raped. Most people are feminists and confuse that with a hateful piece of shit that thinks women should have more rights than men. Most people don’t lie about being raped. 

To simplify; unless you’re a bigoted asshat, you like women’s rights, and are therefore a feminist.

People who say women/men should have unequal rights are shitheads

Don’t be a shithead."
