modernwarfare,fen68qp,t1_fen5o41,1579277884.0,"You guys know some of these things are just true. You can judge me for not liking shotguns players etc. but the rest is facts. Dont try to doubt that. It's a good game for casuals, but I'm no casual :) And flaming ME for my opinion instead of talking about the topic shows what a bunch of self righteous fucks some in this community are, especially you ""spouting off complaints every other noobs have"" lol, dude. If you like the game so much, that you dont even realize these things are true I cant help you. Im fully able to make uo my own opinion based on my own experience, but you know me better I guess"

I dont have any fun anymore, except for Gunfight and I didn't pay 60 bucks on an unfinished game to only play 2v2. There is still no map voting/filter, even tho players leave lobbies anyways instead of playing shitty maps. Do I still need to mention the SBMM? Or the lack of communication? What about getting kicked out of a game because I have ""lost"" the connection even tho I didn't? Whats up with the terrible netcode? Feels like I'm a running magnet magically attracting bullets around corners. Or the splendid CoD players that camp, only play shotgun/rpg, position themselves right infront of you and think all gamemodes are secretly team deathmatch because they've never learned how to read full words and therefore don't understand that the objective is a completely different one"

Basically the only contact with drug education happens in school and is mostly orginazed by police and they're missing a lot, they only argument for it's illegal reasons. I've been on a grammar school and have never had lessons about drugs that fully contain all information of it's good and bad effects, how its works, it's uses nor anything else, except for one or two periods per year with either police or some sort of social teacher"
modernwarfare,fedsvd5,t1_fedrczf,1579019173.0,"Ik about the slang but thank you anyways for that and I also know from my own expierence that XTC is very different to speed in its effects but still similar: youre not as euphoric, it lasts shorter and youre way more toasted afterwards, atleast I'm. I was talking about the chemical structure, which I should have pointed out btw. . Eventually theyre in the same family and have **some** of the same effects but are still **noticable** different"

But Meth, Speed and XTC are very close related, Im not wrong with that. Its Methamphetamine, amphetamine (sulfate) and methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Even the effects are pretty similar. Instead of being a wannabe smart ass you could have told me but I assume you dont know shit"
