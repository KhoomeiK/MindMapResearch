worldnews,fgpgie3,t1_fgpdp96,1581004342.0,"Well, I don't disagree completely, but comparing it to chess is a little silly. Fact is they are getting on their feet, Europe is semi-reluctant to stop them (I mean they have a right to exist) and USA is slipping. But they didn't create the situation currently in the US. It has been a long time coming and frankly democracy is crumbling. Did Russia try to nugde it in direction of chaos? Probably. But in such case they got set up for a slam dunk. Corrupt western interests enabled, paid for and set up most of the false info campaigns. To compare, we even have them in my small country, the far right has absolutely no moral, and they are not controlled by Russia. We are too small time for them. Far right politicians are just ruthless in their agenda and people who didn't learn to question sources eat up any propaganda thrown their way. If we are to counter this we must focus on the core of the problem and that is our own corrupt and morally bankrupt politicians. And I am not talking about the right in general only the far right that the GOP has become and the same is true for the far right in my country. I have respect for the centre-right. They mostly play fair. People are entitled to their views as long as they keep honest.

Edit: Also we have the current World Chess Champion, World Rapid Chess Champion and World Blitz Chess Champion. Arguably the greatest chess player of all time, Magnus Carlsen. So if anyone is the driving force behind world tactical politics it's us by your logic. Check mate :)

todayilearned,fgovkbt,t1_fgov1ag,1580988576.0,"3-4 pounds. Pulling facts out of your ass.

If 2500 kcal is the norm as you said. A few anorexic people are gonna be at say 500 kcal. That is 2000 below, how many more people are gonna be at 2000 above do you think? At 4500. Even normal people who splurge on 4500 kcal once in a while. Then you have extreme athletes who eat 4500+ kcal every day. Its going to drag the average heavily up because 0 is as far as you can go down, but the upper limit is in the tens of thousands.

I am not surprised the avg is 3800 and I can assure you it doesn't mean that most people eat that much every day."
todayilearned,fgouu5g,t1_fgot408,1580987643.0,"Nah, over half of the US population drink soda everyday. There you have your answer. Blood sugar like a jo-jo. [Here](https://www.health.com/weight-loss/the-real-reason-youre-not-losing-weight) is a source on blood-sugar and weight gain, since you are obviously unable to use Google. And as a bonus it says:

>Think balance, not calories
When dieting, ""you need to be like the three bears and get the right mix of carbs, protein and fiber to keep blood sugar balanced,"" Crandall says. Focusing solely on calories can actually hinder weight loss. ""**You need protein to support muscle and metabolism, fat for the absorption of vitamins and carbs to sustain energy**.""

The US recommends 2700 kcal per day. There are not gonna be very many people much under this, but some people are gonna drag the average *way* up. So 3800 is not an outrageous average. Keep in mind that the kcal on the package is not fully absorbed by the body. We don't take up 100% and it decreases by how fast and ready those calories are. Also, the energy used to process foods is about 5–10% of the calories the food contains for carbs, 0–5% for fat and 20–30% for protein. 

But I don't know why I get myself into these pointless arguments. Have a good day."
todayilearned,fgoswp1,t1_fgos97p,1580985025.0,"Apparently not, by the very statistics we are discussing. I mean you are pretty simple minded if you think things are so black and white. If you are eating healthy now, try and switch to the same amount of calories in processed sugar and fat for some months and see how it goes.

I eat *a lot*, probably around 3000+ kcal avg, but I am skinny because the bulk of it is healthy unprocessed food. I never care how many kcal I stuff in my face. I am not very active. My job is sitting. But if I for example during Christmas eat mostly cookies and fat food I put on weight after some days. It's nothing strange about it.

People are so fat in America because they have diseases from their diet, not because they don't count their calories. Because they have the same mind set like you. You think insulin triggeres fat storage is ""bro science"". It's medical science."
todayilearned,fgos7ux,t1_fgorrur,1580984046.0,"They don't need to lose weight. Most people are where they want to be. I agree 3800 seems a bit high, but my point is you can't compare kcal average of the US and Europe without taking other factors in to account. 

And another factor: stress and sleep. Your body processes food and resets to normal during sleep. Hence morning toilet visits."
todayilearned,fgormmh,t1_fgoqe7o,1580983219.0,"An example of how you could eat 3800 kcal, lay on the couch and not gain weight is the keto low-carb diet. Which undeniably works if you follow it strictly, not taking other health side-effects into concern. And similar to this there are other mechanisms in the body that changes with diet. Sugar increases blood-sugar and in turn insulin. Insulin tells the body to store more fat. 

Your fat cells also have ""memory"", they want to stay the same. You can have a surplus of calories and if you are otherwise healthy your body will gear up to keep you at match weight. It will also turn down to idle if you have a calorie deficiency. Our bodies are pretty self tuning if we keep them healthy. If you overload with sugar for example it messes up these mechanisms. But they will work to get back on track in the next day(s) as long as you stay healthy. This is why they recommend one cheat day a week instead of snacking all week even with the same calories.

In general a steady and low blood-sugar keeps you lean and healthy. 

Coffee and spicy food are two very obvious examples that gears up your metabolism. And something we haven't mentioned - water. Maybe the most important one. It helps your body function in just about every way. In Europe clean water is the standard drink. Every weight expert will tell you to drink enough water. 

Some foods can not be processed at full by the body. Even if it is has a potential of 500 kcal not all will be available to your body and it has to work hard to get them. You have probably noticed how some things will even come out completely unprocessed in your stool. The kcal potential couldn't be used. On the other hand fast carbs will be taken up in full by your body, with little to no effort. 

A healthy individual will also have a higher resting metabolism than an unhealthy one at the same weight. Unhealthy people generally also have less muscle mass. It doesn't matter if you are a little active if your body don't get the nutrition it needs to rebuild. Over time this matters. 

Kcal is not kcal. There are a lot of factors to what you put inside your body. I'm not gonna discuss any further, because you will probably ignore everything I just wrote.

On the flip side healthy and varied food will do the opposite and help your body to handle food effectively. Some foods boost your metabolism. 

I am not saying you will get fat from 1500 kcal of ice cream a day. Only deathly sick. But if we are talking 3800 kcal there definitely is a huge difference to what you put into yourself."
todayilearned,fgolbob,t1_fgokbzc,1580974481.0,"No it's not. It varies how much energy you take up from your intestines. And it varies how much your body wants to collect fat in your cells. Some foods are even net energy losses, because your body spends more energy to process them than they give off. 

And in the case of fiber it passes food effectively through your system which reduces calorie uptake, it will control blood sugar which means less fat storing and it will lower your cholesterol because the intestines need it for processing the fiber, it will then pass with your stool.

My biggest fear is that we are gonna keep on keeping on by the lead of ""rational"" capitalists until the oil market collapses, we can subsidise ourselves a few years with the oil fund and then fall back in to the 1900s because we did nothing to transition into the future.

I learned about it as an adult. It's not about apologizing soviet or Russia but two wrongs don't make a right. The resolution made by EU is not right, it's taken out of context, and goes against the precedence of the last 80 years. It's not supported by historians. It's a bunch of politicians voting on history.

Considering how incredibly close we were to losing to nazism it is clear any small and big effort made a difference and noone can claim victory alone.

I think you're right. In so many, even European countries, they have open markets where people can just sell their produce laying in some wood casket. Seems unthinkable in Norway. But I think we could change how we think about it and clean them at home before use.

Kanskje går til og med regnestykket noenlunde opp. Effektivisere IT, rutiner, papirmølle og den biten. Få færre uføre og utbrente arbeidere. Flere erfarne og rutinerte som står i helseyrket. Bedre folkehelse gjennom bedre pasientsikkerhet."

People are so hostile to their own region centers. Even talking them down. How can they expect to improve their region if they don't support their own culture and education capitals. Also how the region capitals (well mostly Tromsø) will use any opportunity to trash the other. Too many complexes. I can only imagine what could have been if northerners could start to work together instead of complain all the time. But when they meet in a bar in Oslo? Best fucking friends. Ridiculous.

My wife is from Siberia and we have lived a few places in Norway, she calls Oppland ""little Russia"" and I don't disagree with her. Something about people's mind set and way of life. The inland is as cold as Siberia also, and because of the humidity from Mjøsa she says it's even worse, I mean 20 minus and fog, isn't that against the laws of nature?
