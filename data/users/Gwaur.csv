Mahjong,ff5llpl,t1_ff3wh7t,1579598879.0,"The game situation also affects that decision. For example, if the game is close to ending, and you're in last place, might as well try something crazy.

Happened to me a couple months ago. Second-to-last hand. Started from 6 orphans, ended with a last-discard ron from the player in first place. I won the hanchan. :D"

classicalmusic,fexlwvt,t3_equhcl,1579433146.0,There might also be practical reasons. Maybe the conductor has to catch a train. Maybe the allotted time in the venue is running out.
Cubers,fewrxn8,t1_fetrwg3,1579418588.0,"Images that you find on Google still exist somewhere. Google isn't a bank of random images that you can find random images from. Google is a bank of information on a lot of images on the internet. This image was published on some website, then Google got to know about it, and listed it in their database of images.

When you find an image on Google, Google *will* tell you where the image is from. Due to copyright stuff, it's *actually your duty* to report the originator of the image."

I and a buncha dudes went to a place at the French-Spanish border where the parking lot was unambiguously in France and all the shops and restaurants were unambiguously in Spain, but the exact border wasn't really marked. So shuttling between the car and the shops, we literally visited Spain and France several times in one day."
