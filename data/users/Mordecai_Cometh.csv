parrots,femdw87,t3_epnsuh,1579250463.0,Oh I am so happy for you :) maybe he'll remember how good it was and let it happen more often :D it's happening with my cats so why not with a bird ? :)
selfimprovement,fe7vd3t,t3_eo05yr,1578919597.0,"Some hobbies don't require that much energy. I have two fishtanks. They're quite sophisticated. And I don't need energy to care of them. 

And about sleep. Sleep is your number one priority."
fountainpens,fds7cxb,t3_empl9r,1578696008.0,"Hey lad, I'm an art student. I see people around me that don't draw as well as you. I don't if I'm able to do protrait as well as you did. And mostly, be gentle with yourself first. Have fun. ;>"

bettafish,fdercau,t3_ekuiha,1578344996.0,Love those full mask wild types :>
bettafish,fdefp4j,t1_fdefe6y,1578338020.0,I have minerals aside in big bottles. I can always add that and make the parameters perfect before the water change. :)
bettafish,fdef88f,t1_fdeeagd,1578337725.0,I'm gonna buy some prime right away then. My tap water is reaaaaaally hard. Like really really hard. I really can't use it.
bettafish,fdedr50,t1_fdeddbo,1578336806.0,"I don't add any minerals before hand. I add it after the water changes. I got told to do it like that. 

>It's not recommended to use only RO water or distilled without remineralizing it beforehand as pure RO or distilled will suck the minerals right out of your betta.

Ok so we may have found the issue here. I'll add the minerals BEFORE adding the water to the tank.. dang I feel stupid. My fish is getting his inerals sucked out of his body. :("
bettafish,fded2sj,t1_fdec303,1578336383.0,"I don't use tap water for water changes. Temperature is 24,5ºC. It is heavily planted with anubiad, bucephalandraes, marsilae hirsuta and riccia. I also added some limnobium laevigatum to suck up those nitrates and bring some shay areas in the tank. The light is an ONF flat nano with minimum luminosity. The tank has been cycled for about fives months. :)

I'll try the catappa thing. It's basically the same as almond leaves right ? And I'll probably use neutral water (osmosed) for the mixture. Thank you for that. The Rabin is quite alright to me as every plant in the tank doesn't require much light except for the floating laevigatum. 

Thanks for your answer. :)"
Aquariums,fco9zl2,t1_fco6n6f,1577827149.0,It's really good looking :)
Aquariums,fcmzlfr,t3_ehwu2y,1577798799.0,Sooo... it looks beginner level but I can't say what's so relaxing about it. I like like. I might copy you actually.
selfimprovement,fckvkpl,t1_fcku9um,1577734131.0,"I plan on illustrating a thing or two about pokrmons nowadays. Art is going to be my saviour as it already is. Pleasure is growing after each stroke. And from gamer to artist I might simply play on the other side of the screen designing the worlds I used to enjoy loosing myself in. I am saying all this with no arrogance. I don't want to be the guy bragging about what he does. I am still learning to draw and see myself as an apprentice. 

And the biggest lesson of the week (and probably the year now) is that I won't find any meaning in life playing video games, sitting all day and night. And I may not be fully conscious of it but it's coming. 

Thank you for your answer."
selfimprovement,fcjsxum,t1_fcjm04q,1577703098.0,Well I actually don't play alone anymore. I prefer from far spending time with my girlfriend rather than playing alone with no one to laugh with.
selfimprovement,fcie33k,t1_fcidph4,1577661166.0,I'm an artist. ;) I draw stuff and have sculpture classes. :)

This is precisely what I just told my gf. I wonder what's about to happen in my life. I wonder what shift this will induce."
selfimprovement,fci4cyh,t1_fci42fb,1577657640.0,Playing video games is the best way I've find to play with my friends. We all live at least 400 km away from eachother. It gives me vertigo to get older. Ffs I'm only 23.
parrots,fc02zm6,t3_ef88xm,1577276010.0,Birds are such amazing beings. I'd love to have one to cherish but my gf doesn't like the cage part of having a bird in the house
