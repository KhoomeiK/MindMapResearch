Your arguments are shit and mostly appeals to emotions that other meat eaters dont care about.  You arent going to get them to see our animal products as sentient organisms.

The methane produced from the cattle industry is at least as bad as all the cars in the world as far as greenhouse gasses go, as methane retains way more heat.
