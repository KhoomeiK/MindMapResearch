He was not happy and called me in multiple times to admonish me for it. In my city a vasectomy is protected by law so I knew I was in the right and I talked to some lawyers about next steps if I was punished at work.

I have to do the same whenever I re-watch Contact with Matthew McConaughey. The villain is just so evil and almost all of it is the religious component. Kinsey is more scary than the Ori for sure.

DestinyTheGame,feadj0f,t3_eo7har,1578947333.0,"Every Seasonal Engram is a RNG for pure gold for me. I got the game in June 2018 thru Humble Bundle but didn't really play until the last 2 months or so. It came with everything except Forsaken and its pass. In December I bought the pack that included Forsaken, Shadowkeep, and 3/4 season pass. Seasonal Engrams have had some great content for me but there are plenty of things in there I just don't care about. Emotes are the number one thing I do not care about at all or want as a reward of any kind. I play with a PS4 remote on Windows and cannot re-map the 4 emote buttons to something useful. This is insane. Shaders are hit or miss but mostly I went thru so much gear while leveling that I just dismantled all my shaders for the glimmer and legendary shards. Almost all non-exotic ships and vehicles are repeats and useless as rewards. The brokenness of the ghosts favoring Guiding Light and Treasure Hunter means once I have a ghost with those abilities, I never need another ghost ever again. In terms of the Season Pass and Seasonal Engrams as rewards, getting to 100 was like whacking a pinata. After 100 with only getting the engram every 5 levels means I just don't care about XP anymore. It's nice to get something, but it's so spread out and limited that it makes the system seem silly. If there's a level 200, there should be real rewards leading up to it. More content for the season pass cost is the solution.

>Not a Bren Gun and not a standard magazine. The Bren was an Allied squad automatic weapon of British and Commonwealth forces in WWII. These look like some version of the Japanese Type 11. Japanese Type 11 light machine gun as adopted in 1922. This weapon was actually a modified French Hotchkiss design that fired the standard 6.5 Japanese rifle round. One of the interesting aspects of this MG is that it is feed by a hopper mechanism located on the left side of the action that was designed to use the standard 5-round rifle stripper clips with a special reduced charged cartridge. The clips were laid flat in the hopper so that they feed the cartridges into the side of the mechanism. It can be easily distinguished by the very unique radically curved buttstock that provided an easy way to carry or hold the gun. These are all fitted with a finned barrel with no flash hider and a long folding bipod.
