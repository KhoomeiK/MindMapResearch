truscum,fd0wsgg,t3_ejr3v6,1578124820.0,"16, female - I cant really tell what you're going for but if you're FtM, I'd suggest cutting your hair a bit shorter and contouring your face to masculinize it. I'm trying really hard not to be rude, but it's going to be very difficult to pass as male when your hair is as long as it is. If you're planning on going on testosterone, your facial features will change on their own, but for now I'd suggest applying a bit of dark eye shadow (Make sure it doesnt actually look like makeup) from the bottom of your eyebrows to your eyelid. Cis guys tend to have darker shadows around their eyes. You could also apply some skin-toned powder to your lips to make them appear less pink

Are you FtM or NB, if you dont mind me asking? I hope I dont sound too intrusive"
