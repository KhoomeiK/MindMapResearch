I just started Nevermoore from a suggestion in another thread (what to read after HP) and so far this seems great. The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman. There are quite a few age appropriate stories in Sir Terry Pratchetts Discworld, and the best thing is it’s really great for spanning age groups (meaning the kiddos won’t catch the innuendo). And there are 47 of them :D"

suggestmeabook,fcnxxzk,t1_fcnxm3a,1577820607.0,"I think starting anywhere is fantastic! I just don’t ever suggest AG first due to density, and I’ve heard from so many people (reading NG for the first time) put it down and never tried any other of his books. Which makes me sads. So now I suggest building up to it when recommending. It’s like cilantro, I think."
knitting,fcnwbtc,t1_fcn6pk6,1577819742.0,"Slightly. Agreed, not enough to compensate if you’re looking for more than 3/4-1”. But what it really does is give the yarn its best life. It’ll bloom, the stitches will even out, and it’ll relax into amazingness. Blocking is awesome."
