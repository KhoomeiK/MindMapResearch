We have to ask ourselves why didn't life evolve simultaneously on opposites ends of the earth, over a 4.5B year period and over a vast distance (for microbial life)?  The only answer to this is that it is incredibly incredibly rare.  Given the vast distances of space and the rarity of life, we may never run into another planet with even just microbial life.

There are other filters as well that could slow down intelligent life, which are also incredibly rare.  It took 60 Million years for bacteria to evolve to digest cellulose.  All these incredibly rare events are still at the microbial level.  I can't even begin to imagine how difficult it is to evolve complex life as well."
