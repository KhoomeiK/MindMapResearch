So over time, people naturally established a propensity to sleeping better at night, or during the day. Obv way less people were awake to guard at night, so correlated to the much lower prevalence of night owls.

In my research, i obviously looked at predisposing factors that may contribute to ptsd. I found that the idea that the military is filled with poor, uneducated young men and women who have no other option, is just a myth. The majority of the armed forces comes from white, middle class, suburban and rural towns. The percentage of low income, urban enlistees, were in the 20% range. Extremely low percentage of GEDs, and even a percentage in the teens of bachelor degree holders (tho obv the officer corps could contribute to this, since u have to have a bachelors to be an officer). However, i found very little, and in fact contrary, evidence that military recruiters target underserved areas and intentionally try to recruit lower income kids.

I’m sure some cities pay low, or suck and may have a hard time, but definitely not where i live. I went thru a couple years of applying to be a police officer, which included turning in an application for every suburb around my city, and the city itself. Every single place had 200+ if not way more applicants, for maybe 2 open positions. I had a bachelors degree from a big 12 school, 6 years in the Army infantry, including 2 combat deployments, and in good shape. In the 2 years i turned in probably 25 applications. I got past the fitness and written test all 25 times. Made it past the police panel interview maybe 12 times, made it past the home visit maybe 8 times, passed the polygraph every time, and twice made it past the interview with the chief, which means they hire you conditionally. Unfortunately, those two times were the same year so i had to choose one. After you’re “conditionally” hired, then you do the medical and psych exam. An old Army injury that doesn’t even affect any part of my life and is completely healed..got me nixed. I’m not saying hire dirtbags, but the requirements they set could be a LITTLE more relaxed. Literally can have zero record. 32, but made a stupid decision at 18 and was caught with booze underage? Need not apply. Too many speeding tickets as a teenager? Need not apply."
