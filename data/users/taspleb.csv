With the benefit of hindsight, if you were trying to document what happened in any election you would want to focus the most on the winner, certainly compared to candidates who didn't even make it through the primaries.

Probably a combination of both, but I suspect the number of votes changed compares to if they'd covered Trump mildly less would have been small."

The earliest a normal election can be is July 1, 2021.

The issue is the senate have fixed terms which means half senate elections have to be within one year of their term expiring (June 30, 2022).

We can't have a double dissolution election without the specific triggers being met (the same Bill passing in the house and failing in the Senate twice) which hasn't happened.

So the only other alternative is a Reps only election and then a separate half Senate election which would be extremely unpopular.
