An inning can last a half hour or five minutes, depending on how fast the outs happen. Traditionally after the seventh inning, the whole stadium stands up and sings ""take me out to the ballgame"" followed by whatever the local team's fun song is. Starting pitchers usually last five to seven innings, then get subbed out for a reliever or closer, because usually the last few innings are the most exciting (assuming it's still close at that point)."

My heart had been set on Stanford for years. Had the grades (4.3 gpa), test scores (1590 sat), resume (awesome industry-level internship in my field). Planned my life around it, never really considered rejection. Got the no five minutes before a basketball game, cried on the bus on the way back. 

Mid-January, the rejection letters kept piling in (Rice, Duke, etc.). But I also got a piece of mail from a university I had never heard of, the University of North Texas. Because of the National Merit Scholarship, they were offering me a full scholarship plus benefits. Never heard of the school before, but it immediately jumped to the top of the list cause at that point it was my only real option. 

I just finished my first semester at UNT and I've never been happier. The school is wonderful, the people are kind, the professors are enthusiastic, and the classes are interesting and rigorous.

AskReddit,fcx8xes,t1_fcx73ec,1578055854.0,"A) the Intercept notes that of the 1000+ complaints they reviewed, only three were investigated and found to be substantiated. It's important to remember that 1) this isn't limited to minors, 2) this isn't limited to rape (even the lower legal standard of sexual assault constituted roughly half the complaints), 3) this was not an investigation conducted by ICE, and 4) these complaints are not limited to ICE, ICE workers, or even employees at all. Which leads to the next point:

B) of the ~1,200 complaints the NYT addresses (which I believe *were* limited to minors), their own statistics report that well over 90% were minors assaulting other minors. The article even finishes with an indirect quote of a member of ICE leadership stating that he was not aware of even one substantiated case against a worker in the scope involved. 

C) no, the ACLU isn't quoting ICE as saying they're not responsible for being dumb shits. The specific case, in which the ACLU is providing legal counsel to the victim, was that the ICE officers in question were claiming a law about prison wardens didn't apply to them. No matter how that case turns/turned out, they deserved to lose. 

And finally, who claimed they were my heroes? I never once said anything about ICE besides that the agency doesn't exist to deal with anything other than illegal immigration. After having read those articles thoroughly, I don't believe for a second that ICE as an agency is mass-raping children, etc. 3 substantiated cases over 6 years? That sounds remarkably low for any prison-like structure. Rape and sexual assault in any form is horrible, but your sources fail to prove that ICE is responsible (though not for lack of trying)."

AskReddit,fcx6krq,t1_fcx5f6l,1578053328.0,"Misunderstanding 1: when I say ""packed the Court"", I mean FDR personally appointed 8 justices and expanded the Court by five seats. That is an overwhelming majority of the Court, far more than Trump, who still loses half his cases even with two of his nominees (replacing a guy who was further right than both and a middle-of-the-road guy with the occasional interesting opinion). The Court, as it sits now, is less right-wing than it was under Bush, and even that Court frowned on some of his moves.

Misunderstanding 2: the House is just as important as the Senate, and Trump has a very faint hold on the Senate only. The Republicans currently have a majority so small (53/100) that the three senators moderate enough to be independent could tilt the scale by themselves. Meanwhile, the Democrats solidly control the house. During FDR's time, the Democratic control in the Senate was a ridiculous 74 out of 100 (though it went down by the time internment started to 57). This was accompanied by a 334 to 88 advantage in the House (which once again was down to a much smaller advantage by internment in 42). This is why he could pack the Court, which allowed him to push through ridiculous, horrible things like internment.

Misunderstanding 3: all the turnover in the Pentagon, including Mattis, is and has always been because they are direct employees of the POTUS. Compete loyalty in the executive branch isn't just normal, it's pretty expected. That doesn't mean it's right, because pure unadulterated loyalty is not what they are supposed to provide; they are supposed to give counsel that benefits the nation. But it does mean it was a resource available to Bush, to FDR, and to every other American president.

Bringing these together, the current leadership is a lot weaker than what you seem to think. I understand you're saying it's a weak possibility. I'm saying so much about this because I well and truly believe there is absolutely *no* possibility, and implying otherwise inspires fear in people who have no right being afraid. 

I like you and I think you're intelligent. In fact, you seem to have put a lot of thought into this, which is wonderful. I just think the conclusion at which you've arrived lacks as solid a base in history as it should have.

Edit: just saw yours. And almost ended on the same point anyway :). I should sleep too, seeing as it's 5AM somehow. Whether or not either of us convinced anyone, I hope we both came out with a different perspective. Goodnight!"
AskReddit,fcx40nf,t1_fcx34c4,1578050260.0,"Okay, let's actually do this, then.

The last, first, and only real time the US government has imprisoned a large portion of the population SPECIFICALLY because of an ongoing war was under the direction of by far the most powerful president in its history. The only reason (besides a general public fear FDR thrived on) that internment was not stopped is that FDR packed the Supreme Court and owned Congress. Part of it, as well, was a ridiculous four term presidency that allowed a grip over American politics the likes of which had not been seen and has not existed since. 

The current climate is directly contradictory to that. Bush never had anywhere near the guts to try a blatant power play like packing the Court, but with Patriot Act and several others made plays to increase presidential power. Similar to FDR, this was only made possible by the state of fear in the nation present after the terror attacks on 9/11. However, even at the peak of his reach, when Bush was torturing foreign nationals, spying on Americans, and creating a war on false pretenses, the opposition was vocal and powerful. He didn't have NEAR the sway to pull off an atrocity the scale of Japanese internment. 

Trump is, if anything, extremely divisive. There is no universe in which he could gather enough support to even manage half what Bush did as far as the power plays. His travel restrictions were thrown out in every court his opponents could find because there was a link to religious discrimination. He even gets ridiculed and attacked for an immigration system set up by his predecessor. It would be impossible in the current climate for anything even remotely on that scale to happen.

So these fears are completely unfounded. The political opposition to the current leadership in this country today is a thousand times more powerful than it was under FDR. This isn't a situation where history even has the possibility of repeating itself, barring a legitimate world war and multiple constitutional crises. 

TL;DR: if you don't want ICE to arrest you, don't enter the country illegally. That's their purpose now, and that's their purpose for the immediate future. Anybody who tells you otherwise is making money on your fear."
