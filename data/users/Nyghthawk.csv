Grimdawn,ffobkbj,t1_ffn5b1k,1580075951.0,"No. Quantity and occurrence rate is more at 75-76 over 50-51. 



However take this example. (Just to make math easy)


At 75-76 you get 10 legendaries and 2 blueprints per finish.  You can finish 5 in an hour.  So total is 50 legendaries and 10 blueprints. 



At 50-51 you get 6 legendaries and 1 blueprint. But you can finish the 12 in an hour. So total is 70 legendaries and 12 blueprints. 


So which would you spend your “time” on?"

It’s like when the h1n1 virus came out. They didn’t just say “flu” as it was a specific string. The “bird flu” or avian influenza is not just “influenza”. 


So why is everyone saying “Coronavirus” when it’s a specific string of it? Very very very fear mongering."

Disneyland,ff597hd,t1_ff214mc,1579584025.0,"The fact that you expect the ride NOT to break down already sets you in that mindset of expecting too much. 


Is it fair that a family of 5 with young kids canâ€™t get up at 430am to go stand in line for 2 hours just to get in the park before 758am. So to make it the â€œmostâ€ fair between these two groups of people. Made it so that at â€œopeningâ€ everyone has the same chance. 



That is the definition of fair. 


Could Disney have done it a different way? Probably. Maybe save a few spots of the boarding group to offer physical machines to possible get in line just in case there are people who arenâ€™t on the upity up of using the APP. (People who donâ€™t use the app cry â€œunfairâ€)


Or maybe open up 1000 tickets for BG before park opening for people like you who like to get up at 430 am.(people who still didnâ€™t get it cry unfair)


Or maybe a few spots each 2-3 hour gap so people who get to the parks late can still get in (people who arrived early or 8am cry unfair). 


Or maybe have a standby line and before they close a group after their 2 hours are up if no one entered the line pull from that line (people who wait 10hours in line and donâ€™t get in cry unfair)


No matter how you look at it people will cry unfair.  


Canâ€™t please everyone. But if you expect this (or any new high tech ride) to not break down even during first week opening Iâ€™m glad Disney doesnâ€™t go out of their way to please you."
Disneyland,ff4pcxl,t1_ff4dfay,1579569220.0,That is the close enough. Still makes perfect sense that you arenâ€™t going to act like these other people are regarding the ride in the first 3 days of opening.

Grimdawn,ff3p5wn,t1_ff2tjya,1579545853.0,I meant that I just do one session of SR 60-61 or 75-76. Get my spoils and then reopen a new gate and run another SR. All your drops remain on the ground if itâ€™s the same â€œsessionâ€. So my floor is littered with yellow items that I donâ€™t pick up. Just leave the game running and donâ€™t go back to the menu.
Grimdawn,ff2nj4g,t1_ff2m4sf,1579514920.0,Well my idea of leaving it open indefinitely to get all the legendaries just went down the drain. Thanks! :)
Grimdawn,ff2ni6s,t1_ff2jxh3,1579514879.0,Edit clarification. It does a check 5-10 times to reroll if duplication found. So have a higher chance of finding legendaries that you donâ€™t have plus that havenâ€™t dropped yet but still can end up duplicates. My bad sorry!

Disneyland,ff2j90j,t1_ff2hanu,1579508613.0,"I understand you came specifically for this ride and this ride only. You didnâ€™t come for a Disneyland trip then. If you are coming in a month or two it will be easier to â€œwinâ€ the lottery. You are comparing opening weekend on a holiday weekend to how you will expect things to be all the time. This is just not true. 


However you are the exception to the â€œgeneralâ€ public of travelers. Most come for Disneyland expecting to experience everything or as much as they can. 


For example. If I were to go to Disneyland Tokyo or whatever for the tron ride. And I had a choice of 6-8 hours in line or experience Tokyo Disney ? Iâ€™d choose experiencing the park and make a second trip if possible for tron when things â€œdie downâ€. When I have a bigger and better chance to get on. 


Does that make sense? Sorry for Rambling."
Disneyland,ff2ft6p,t1_ff1uns1,1579504308.0,Try and skip past them fast. Really. Obviously there will be things you â€œknowâ€ of but to experience it is different too. Unless someone told you expect A to happen before B and then C will happen then D etc youâ€™ll be plenty surprised.

Disneyland,ff1uoc7,t1_ff1tgqq,1579486587.0,"People are getting boarding passes later in the day at wdw. Itâ€™s opening week. Itâ€™s a holiday weekend. 

You can be there at 430am and someone at 758am. They have the same â€œchanceâ€ at getting on the ride. I think that is as fair as it can get. If I get there at 11am and the ride is gone. I donâ€™t get to ride. No different than if a fast pass is gone for a ride. 


It is leagues better than having 6-8hour lines. 


Iâ€™d hate to wait in one line for 6-8 hours to â€œpossiblyâ€ get to ride one ride. Iâ€™d rather know. â€œItâ€™s probably not happening but let me enjoy Disneyland for the rest of my dayâ€"
Disneyland,ff1s1bo,t1_ff1om7f,1579484902.0,I think you will be â€œokâ€. Reason being at Disney world people are getting the 60s for boarding groups at 6pm. Itâ€™s opening week. First weekend. Holiday weekend. It will slow down a bit.
Disneyland,ff1rqax,t1_ff0n1mi,1579484708.0,"Itâ€™s the lesser of two evils. 


Example a much lesser ride Radiator Springs opened with 5-6 hour waits. So you are saying a family should stand in line for half their trip to ride ONE ride? at least now whether they get in queue or not they can enjoy (spend money) at Disneyland while â€œwaitingâ€. 


Yes it does suck if they cannot get in queue, but I think itâ€™s better knowing and enjoying the rest of Disneyland than being in line for 6 hours doing NOTHING for your one ride trip."

However, think of it this way: you start at shard 75 with waypoint. Go all the way to shard 80 chunk 4. Takes you 30 minutes (just for example). 



I will do shard 75-76 only. Can be done in 10 minutes. 



So I can do shard 75-76 3x in the time it takes you to go to shard 80. I will then have 2.5 times the chances of the same legendaries you will. With 2.5 times the mats etc.
