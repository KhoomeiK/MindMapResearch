sex,ff8ltl8,t3_es47v9,1579684839.0,"This is going to sound harsh, but I think sepratation may be something to consider. He clearly has no care or consideration for you, only for himself, and that doesn’t bode well if he isn’t willing to change. This post speaks of deeper problems than just sex."

ugly,ff5trpx,t3_erny4o,1579609940.0,Dude I’ve seen you here before. You keep posting this shit. Your attitude and personality is fucking gross; your face ain’t the problem.
relationships,ff0fona,t3_eqyiom,1579468448.0,I didn’t even finish reading this. One word: RUN. This is SICK and ABUSIVE. He will NEVER change. RUN.
relationships,ff0d6b0,t3_eqw1r9,1579467776.0,She’s being ridiculous. Would she be upset if you fantasies yourself into the scene during porn too? Way over the top.

ugly,fej3mka,t3_epddlh,1579155647.0,Dude you post this crap here all the damn time. Just stop already. Go outside. You’re insecure and unkempt. End of story.
ugly,feickd8,t3_ep59x0,1579135341.0,"Also, you just look dirty. Get a haircut, clean up your skin, get fit, dress well, then come back to us."
ugly,feicg40,t3_ep59x0,1579135263.0,"People aren’t staring, they’re zoning out and not actually noticing you at all. Everyone is far too busy giving a shit about themselves to care about you. You’re fine. No ones staring."
ugly,fea6i0l,t1_fea2eiv,1578944911.0,"Dude, I was literally just trying to give you ideas on how to improve your life and take the focus off your appearance. You not being able to get a therapist does not make it any less a valid suggestion. I didn’t know you can’t get a therapist. Focusing on a skill is also a valid suggestion. You’re half homeless? Doesn’t matter. What do you do with your time? Work, probably. So get as good as fucking possible at whatever job you have, no matter how menial or miserble. You telling me you’re ‘useless’ and ‘good for nothing’ isn’t constructive, so don’t say that shit about yourself, or if you insist on it, don’t expect other people to put up with it. How does that help you? It’s useless blabber. It’s ‘excuses.’ Of course I don’t know shit about you, I’m a bloody stranger on the internet. What did you expect on Reddit? Don’t expect people to not make suggestions and confront you when you say dumb, useless things such as ‘I’m dumb as fuck’ and expect people to go ‘ah fair, enough!’ Work on being not ‘dumb as fuck then.’ Live your life. As I said, bye."
BingeEatingDisorder,fe9oaci,t3_eo7hkc,1578939916.0,A pound over night? That’s actually impossible. God I wish. Unless you mean including weight from waste and water.
ugly,fe9gb9f,t1_fe5wj6k,1578937260.0,"And I’m meant to know this how? Your question was ‘what does it feel [like] to be good-looking.” Not, “what to do when you’re half homeless.” Yeah. Bye to you too."
sex,fe776f5,t3_envvyb,1578910932.0,I don’t keep them because they feel awkward to look at. I don’t give a rats arse what my partner keeps though.

ugly,fe5ev39,t1_fdwwesj,1578868588.0,Most people are. That’s not an excuse. You make of yourself what you make of yourself. It’s up to you. I won’t coddle you. Either you make something of yourself willingly or you don’t. No one can make you. Up to you and only you.

omad,fdzs7kb,t3_e4v2bf,1578794555.0,You need a calorie deficit to lose weight. Those food choices will not give you that; OMAD or not.
Fitness,fdvhxu6,t3_en5j18,1578747568.0,"There are so many other protein sources! Milk, yogurt, meat, fish, beans! Go browsing in your supermarket and look at the packaging to find the foods with the highest protein."
ugly,fdva54m,t1_fdt1zo8,1578745234.0,Maybe try defining yourself with something else? Really and I mean really master a skill. See yourself as someone who can do that skill rather than someone who looks a certain way.
ugly,fdt0hlt,t1_fds8usk,1578710332.0,"Sounds like you might be suffering from body dysmoprhia or some other fixation disorder. The majority of the people alive are ugly, but still are able to have apathy towards their appearance and live a decent life. I recommend seeing a therapist."
depression,fds5met,t3_ems507,1578694886.0,Talk to the guy. I’m pretty sure he’d rather work with you to cope than break up.

ugly,fdrx4nz,t1_fdkpfth,1578691041.0,"I know. What I’m trying to tell you, is it really affects your actual life/self-image/happiness very little, if at all. Learn not to give a shit. That’s the best it’s gonna get, and you can do it ugly or attractive."

ugly,fdijpsj,t3_elgem8,1578444441.0,"I’ve gone from being considerably ugly to, according to other people, decently attractive. Here’s the truth: it’s not a cure. All the things you described, are still there. But they are lesser. And there are days when you are able to feel ‘neutral’ about your appearance; you simply don’t care. However, you also become aware that your appearance wasn’t the only reason for your other problems (which is an easy thing to thing/feel at the time) and are forced to confront them, and it is harsh. To sum up, it doesn’t feel good, or amazing, or pleasurable. It is simply achieving neutrality."
DrMartens,fdfcdz2,t3_ekagwy,1578358378.0,"The abandons are extremely soft: completely comfortable from the get go. The leather scuffs easy, and the finish on it varies between boots, and in different parts. For example, the tongue on one boot has quite a smooth finish, while the other is more crumpled. I love mine, got them in brown. Definitely recommend if you want a rugged boot. I’d steer clear if you want something more clean/classy."

ugly,fd6307w,t3_ek2rgb,1578184842.0,Yeah. But you can get a lot better by getting fit though! You look friendly!
ugly,fd2ejjm,t3_ejwlh3,1578146085.0,Sorry to break it to you: weight isn’t genetic. Get fit and then judge your appearance; excess weight can mask/morph your features.
DrMartens,fd2ee4j,t3_ejvix2,1578146021.0,"Dubbin certainly makes a difference, but I can’t confirm. Either way when you order the boot it should be the same from either website"

depression,fcqkbry,t3_eihtys,1577887514.0,"As harsh as it is, she is not your responsibility. She is clearly unwilling to change, or help herself, and she is taking away your life. She deserves to be happy, but so do you. It might be time to let go."
gaming,fcqhiht,t3_eiehtt,1577886086.0,"Why the fuck are people talking about her piercings? The title clearly says this is a MAKEUP TEST, not the finished cosplay. Piercings are a bitch to take out/put back in again. She just wanted to test and share the makeup. I don’t know that much about piercings (have some, but not massively into them) but they look fine to me as a layman. Jesus."
sex,fcq7acl,t3_ei2rh6,1577880252.0,I also love missionary. Bringing ones legs up really does make it a lot better and I feel like if more people did that they’d appreciate missionary more. It’s definitely in my top 3 favourite positions.
sex,fcq6cwx,t3_eicn79,1577879713.0,"1 month is a normal time to discuss sexual topics. Hell, I usually have sex with the person way before that time. Almost everyone has kinks, and as far as they go these are pretty mild. Just because someone has kinks doesn’t mean you have to participate in them/that they expect you to. He might have just felt guilty thinking of you sexual during dinner/etc and wanted to be honest."

sex,fces2ue,t3_eh2csk,1577623206.0,"Anal sex is really common to the point it’s almost vanilla. If a woman has a hole, men will want to stick some part of them in it atleast once. I wouldn’t even bat an eyelid and forget 5 minutes later. There are far, far wilder fetishes."
