If they make $10 (cost $9) in France and are forced to invest $2.5 that they didn't want to invest, then France probably sounds pretty uninviting since you make $1 and have to invest $2.5. However, since the cost is actually fixed and your product can be sold to a perfectly flexible number of customers, you're actually choosing whether or not you forgo the full $10.
