Audi,ffhn6rv,t1_ffhlzsu,1579943434.0,The valeo is the one I got. I had heard might cause some chatter but you mentioning the fluidampr is the first I heard of something that will help with that. Just checked the price though and damn.
Audi,ffhkrme,t1_ffhjs4g,1579939864.0,"I ordered the clutch a while back and it's getting rid of the dmf. Timing belt and water pump were replaced not that long ago. Unfortunately after the belt went out about a mile from my house. I bought it used from carmax and when I had the belt done the shop said ""uh, your water pump had rubber sealant and no gasket."""
tifu,fevz89a,t1_fevd9vd,1579403336.0,So they will stop twisting on their own? I've had this same pain. Had the ultrasound that saw nothing. Haven't had it happen in a while now but it use to be a common occurrence.

AskReddit,fdrn9t7,t1_fdqg0h9,1578686859.0,Nyquil for sure if I'm sick. But if you're having trouble just sleeping give their ZzzQuil a try. I've never fell asleep so damn fast. And apparently deep as hell as well. The wife said she woke me up and I was talking. Remember nothing.
AskReddit,fdrliw2,t1_fdqdo95,1578686308.0,I'm gonna have to check them out now solely because you mentioned iPhone chargers. My wife and kids all have iPhones and I'll be damned if every couple weeks someone is complaining about a cable or brick not working.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdnoky3,t3_em4gkc,1578590000.0,I know most people don't want to get involved with anything but fuck. That was a good size group of people just standing around watching them steal that man's best friend.
aww,fdkhkwq,t1_fdkhdki,1578504028.0,Almost like noodling. Except no muddy water hiding unknown horrors.

aww,fdkgp98,t1_fdkbdfn,1578503501.0,Freshest schnoodle I've caught. Once again not disappointed. This time teary eyed as well.
Audi,fd7uk0q,t3_e1swmw,1578210330.0,I have an 05 A4 Quattro 1.8t with 6spd that's been needing the clutch replaced. Getting ready to do that but it's been sitting over a year. What else should I replace and look out for besides fuel and oil? Hopefully asking in the right spot.
Shadowverse,fcsi4pf,t1_fcsew5n,1577916947.0,Honestly no idea. I've never had anything worth trying to post.

pestcontrol,fclv56z,t1_fcluby1,1577757224.0,I was going to get that for the floors for behind things. Alpine or someone mentioned Cimexa as another good one.
pestcontrol,fclu5k2,t1_fclu1rs,1577756533.0,Thanks for all the help.
pestcontrol,fcltnji,t1_fclsdpl,1577756189.0,Was going to order it on Amazon but I keep seeing almost everyone complain about the same issue with the nozzle stop working very quickly. Is the bedlam spray just as good?
pestcontrol,fclqtm9,t1_fclqqs4,1577754230.0,Thanks a bunch.
television,fc3qsky,t1_fc3fwy6,1577396285.0,The only problem I had with Go was that it took the place of the original version. Being older even when the previous version came out it was suited to my style. But I also had kids that I could watch Go with and enjoy the humor. I just wanted to have both versions though.
yesyesyesno,fbxy4xs,t3_eefh2v,1577203502.0,That's me moving out. Only I'd skip ahead to that.
