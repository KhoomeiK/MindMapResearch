I guess the thing thats tripping me up is how I can’t imagine having my bulletproof coffee at 4am. It really gets me going. But that’s waaaaay enough calories to break a fast. 

And therefore to follow, say, 16:8, I wouldn’t be able to eat again until 8pm. And I go to bed at like 7pm, because I wake up at 3am. 

The timing is so screwy. Would a 14:10 schedule even be a fast at all?"
omad,ffikv26,t1_ffihkxo,1579976296.0,"Weight loss from getting leaner is my goal. I’m down 25 pounds from a SW of 195. I have a decent amount of muscle tone from lifting off and on through the years, and having an active job has given me some great abs.... which tragically no one can see. So my goal is maintaining muscle tone and losing about 30 more pounds. 

My interest in fasting stems from how it’s a metabolically healthy way to cut calories, and the fact that it gives you great mental clarity. Though to be honest, cutting the carbs has given me a tremendous amount of clarity too and I’m loving it."

Normally electrolytes and water just aid your muscles in working. Electrolytes also do this cool thing where they help communicate messages from your brain, because they conduct electricity. Super cool.

But if you eat way too many carbs or too much salt, then your body holds too much water. Like when you feel puffy and bloated after killing a whole pizza. On the flip side, if you cut down on carbs and salt, your body will release all the extra water. You pee off up to 8 pounds in a week. 

Sidebar, if you eat a low carb diet then you have to supplement your electrolytes, because your muscles will be low on glucose. I am a nerd."

omad,ff6fjcj,t3_erur8j,1579626093.0,"I’m someone who eats 1400-1600 calories a day and who’s never been diagnosed with an ED of any kind. I have recently put on some weight and lost 23 pounds of it — 20 more to go, then I’m back to normal. Just some background on me.

Here’s why I wouldn’t eat less than 1000 calories: for me, my BMR is about 1420 or so. A BMR is the calories you burn just being alive. I could be in a coma and need 1420 calories. It’s my understanding that even the bodily mechanisms that would keep me alive *plus* burn fat (done by the liver, mostly) would require 1420 calories. 

This next part may cause a riot of responses accusing me of reading ridiculous pseudoscience, but I promise I don’t read Twitter FA nonsense. However, a study that I did read about some years back has some bearing on this. It was a study done on a group of men who were being fed 1200 calories a day. Typically that isn’t  enough for an average man — it’s below a typical BMR. The men reported some interesting effects of eating so little. Weight loss, duh, but also how they each became obsessive about their intake. They reported thinking about food most of the time, being irritable, and of course, tiredness. 

The thinking is that eating consistently below your BMR will result in weight loss, but it will also result in your being cranky as hell and thinking about food all day every day. 

I don’t want to go through that. It sounds shitty. And it makes sense, I don’t believe this is junk science.

And finally, 1000 calories would make it hard to get enough protein. Your body may use protein from your larger muscles for vital functions such as skin cell repair.

So that’s my 2 cents."
