Anxiety,ff22egv,t3_equjni,1579491952.0,"I know it’s gonna be the absolute hardest thing to do, but **you** have the power to change everything. 

Anxiety stems from your thoughts eating at you, constantly. It keeps you from thinking the best about yourself because you live In constant worry. You are always telling yourself that you’re worse than you actually are. You’ve made it this far whether you think you wanted to or not, but you’ve done it. You’ve faced the toughest of obstacles, pushed through the toughest of years, and you keep fighting. You keep on keeping on.

Why? Because you tell yourself to do it. Stop telling yourself that you aren’t anything, because you are something. You’re not a nobody, you’re a somebody. You’re a whole human being with a strong heart and a will to push on every day. 

**you** have the power to change your thoughts, to make yourself believe what you want to believe. 

How about this, do something for yourself today. Whether it’s making yourself food, or putting on an outfit you like, that’s how you make yourself feel food. When you feel good, you pass that energy off to others. I don’t care if you don’t even step foot out your house. Put on your absolute favorite clothing, dance to your favorite song, put your heart and soul into that song and just ignore life for 30 seconds. Feel that hype and know that if you can feel that heightened sense now, you can feel it when you want to."

*first set of red flags*

Then we’re on the way to the fair and she’s hella boring to talk to, but talks about how much she loved food, and I could tell. 

We pull up to the fair and mind you it was military night, so I told myself beforehand that if she looked like I thought then I would pay for both the tickets and look more masculine. But beforehand she also told me she wanted to buy our tickets since I said I don’t usually let people pay for me.

*I use my military free entry and she pays for herself*

We get inside and the fair is mainly shut down since it was pouring for 3 days straight previously. But she wanted to see this concert and the rodeo. We started walking around and I tried to end it so I said “oh they never came to play at the concert here” (even though they were about to go on in an hour). And she said “I wonder if the rodeo is at least about to go, we can watch that” and I said “idk, I think it’s cancelled too”. 

**immediately as I said that, the announcer came on the intercom to say “attention all guest, the rodeo will resume in 5 minutes”**

She begs me to watch it so I agreed. I was embarrassed and wasting my time. So we watched it for maybe 30 minutes (I’m really into rodeos so I couldn’t pass up a good opportunity), and then I made the excuse that my boss texted me saying I have to stand at the hospital all day the next morning. 

I take her home, told her that using false pictures isn’t fair, and blocked her."
