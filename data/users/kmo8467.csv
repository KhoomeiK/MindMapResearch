AmItheAsshole,fff9f7r,t1_ffeprtk,1579878969.0,"This ^^^ EXACTLY!! I once went to the mall with someone who decided to switch his shoes for a new pair & got chased down by security as soon as we went to walk out the store..

I had no idea what was going on till they pointed to his feet & seen different shoes.He was charged with misdemeanor larceny as was myself..

I caught a charge just bc we walked out together,even though he walked out with the shoes & I didn't have a clue!!!

It ended up getting dismissed but still shows on a background check & that doesn't look to great!!Its called guilty by association is what I was told by the officer!"

A true friend will understand that you gotta make your cash flow just like everyone else..I mean if someone is friends with their hairstylist-I highly doubt they expect a free hair cut..

However you could offer the services with a ""Friendly"" little discount...Instead of charging full price knock some of the price off!!"

antidepressants,fff0od6,t1_fff01kb,1579872421.0,The weight gain was out of no where..not to mention my high sex drive went to non existent!!It sucks too bc I felt better on the Zoloft than I had in years..It even help me kick a 10 yr drug addiction..Luckily I haven't went back to my old behavior...Tbh I feel like it saved my life!!Depression just sucks ass though..
antidepressants,ffezjxc,t1_ffezd5q,1579871416.0,Yeah thats no fun lol..been there done it myself!!Have you tried Zoloft??I really liked it and it done wonders but the weight gain was not for me so I stopped.
antidepressants,ffeyq9q,t1_ffeyi1l,1579870650.0,You explained it great to me...I guess bc I experienced the same.It is a very weird feeling that I just couldn't handle..I hope it gets better!!!
antidepressants,ffexe87,t3_et7l3x,1579869340.0,"I started WB about 2 weeks ago..I quit a week into it and threw out the rest of the script for this exact reason..I know it takes several weeks to a few months for AD to really start working but for me this medication was just to much for me to give it that long.

I just couldn't handle the feeling you described above and I couldn't really explain the feeling to anyone..Ive read great reviews about WB and was so disappointed I didn't feel the same."
AmItheAsshole,ff7k43h,t1_ff7io3s,1579651433.0,Failure would only be if the same kid fell off for a third time lol bless yr heart parenting teenagers is a handful!

AmItheAsshole,ff77d7f,t1_ff6dyl3,1579642570.0,I felt this so deeply!!Just know ur not alone!!
antidepressants,feyhbaa,t3_eqsvqe,1579445560.0,"The thing with any antidepressants is that you have to be consistent with them..It takes a few weeks to a month for them to even get in your system & start working correctly..

I just started Welbutrin last week..Before I was on generic zoloft & it worked great but the side effects was to much for me...The first few days the WB was a roller coaster ride.(Same with the zoloft) It seems to have leveled out now & I do feel better.

I would suggest taking the meds at the same time everyday..Set an alarm til you can get in the habit of taking it everyday..Give it a few weeks to see if its working for you or not..If not than talk to your doc!

Best wishes my friend..depression is a biatchhh..but DONT GIVE UP FIGHTING TO FIND WHAT WORKS FOR YOU!!!"

AskReddit,feuvu5w,t1_feub1im,1579390424.0,"I had a similar experience once...I had bought a carton of cigarettes.Took one pack out of it..sat the carton on the head board of my water bed.I smoked one cig and ended up taking a nap.

When I woke up the other 9 pks (including the carton)of cigs were gone..I was there alone...I would have heard someone anyways-As they would have had to reach over my head & my bed was so big they would have had to climb on to it..I'm a light sleeper..so I would of woke up.

I looked for them every where but couldn't find them..well months later,I was home alone again(done forgot about the cigs) anyways I got my PJS out an layed them on my bed before jumping in the shower..

When I got out I went back to my room in my towel to get my PJS & To my surprise layed 9pks of the same cigs on my damn PJS...remind you the same pjs I just pulled out my drawers only 10-15 mins before..crazy shit but tru story though!!"
depression,feukfho,t1_feshyxh,1579387348.0,I feel the same way you do..It really sucks!!
AmItheAsshole,feta8g8,t3_eqhc3o,1579373246.0,"NTA

yr wife was way out of line to act this way...I get the daughter was in the wrong but there is a time and place for everything..Obviously that was not the time!!!

I mean my heart is seriously sadden for your daughter..I can only imagine how embarrassing this was for her.

Not to mention how embarrassed she is gonna be going back to school,where she will likely have to face them with an explanation!!

I would never do my kids like that..My daughter is 15 and has friends over all the time.If I need to talk to her about something that could be embarrassing to her-I do so after they have left.

I think your wife needs some professional help to learn how to control her angerAnd some parenting classes might help as well!!

I mean missing HW one time isn't even that bad & could have been a honest mistake...More than likely your daughter was to afraid to tell her & felt she had to lie bc she knew mom would over react to it.

Not to say your daughter wasn't in the wrong for lying but I truly feel sorry for her & thank God I have a great relationship with my daughter!!!"
antidepressants,feswtgt,t1_feqydnl,1579369751.0,It could be the wellbutrin but its also very easy to build a tolerance to adderall..
brandonlawson,feojv0x,t1_feoieyh,1579301157.0,Interesting indeed!!
brandonlawson,feojqk7,t1_feoib2z,1579301085.0,"I mean Im not saying ""Meth"" doesn't come into play some how but I just dont see this being a meth OD situation!!And yeah anything is possible,sadly we may never know though!"
brandonlawson,feofjzk,t1_feoe2yo,1579299510.0," Yeah highly unlikely he OD on meth..I spent 10 years wasted chasing that crap & never seen anyone die from Meth alone.Not saying its not possible but I just don't see it being the case here.

I personally cant just drop it at that!!!And it saddens me that when drugs are mentioned some people just write it off as an explanation!!"
brandonlawson,feoe2yo,t1_femmrhs,1579298852.0,Wow interesting!!Did this just come out recently???
depression,feo4xtf,t1_fenowgs,1579295153.0,I agree .I didn't mean it would get better on its own its on or just disappear...I guess I worded that wrong!
depression,fenftmg,t1_fenaluk,1579283771.0,"This exactly!!Illegal drugs & Alcohol only make it better for awhile!!Been there,done it!!Although sometimes I almost feel like fighting depression is just as bad as fighting to get clean was!No fun either way but keep ya head up...It will get better!!!"
antidepressants,fekudz5,t1_fekuagh,1579207799.0,I sure hope sooo..I do have to say day 4 is better than day 1 was!!
antidepressants,fektvyd,t1_fekt6ah,1579207504.0,"yeah Im not getting the anti depressive effect just yet myself..Im on a low dose for the first week,so that could be it and Its only my 4th day lol.I cant say its help with smoking either..I didn't have any energy before but It seems to be slowly trying to come back but I just dont care to do anything at all so I dont....So frustrating!!"
antidepressants,fek9zc3,t1_fek9tg7,1579195689.0,Awesome this gives me hope!!How long before you felt energy??

depression,fejy4f5,t3_epft86,1579188497.0,I fell down the same rabbit hole after my mom passed away at 40 from lung cancer..12 yrs of my life was wasted chasing a high so I wouldn't have to deal with reality...I hit rock bottom in July 2019 and decided enough was enough..I got clean & started antidepressants(Zoloft).They really helped me out but didn't like the side effects so I stopped them.I started a new med this past Sunday bc depression recently hit me hard again..Have you tried any antidepressants??It could really benefit you and Its a lot better than turning back to drugs.I will left you up in my prayers!!

depression,fejwub4,t1_fejw6kr,1579187676.0,Yea I know and thats the sucky part of it..Just wasnt sure if Welbutrin worked the same since it work more like a stimulant..just hope it works for me like I've read it working for others.
depression,fejwnzb,t1_fejw8w2,1579187562.0,"I haven't had any sleep issues yet...It does seem that Ive slept a lot  lighter than usual but nothing to bad..Each day Ive felt better than the day before so hopefully it will only get better but I still have no desire to get up from my bed.House work,Ha!Not happening this week lol"
depression,fejvs4v,t1_fej7zpc,1579186987.0,Hi sorry to high jack the thread but just wondering how long it took welbutrin to start helping..I was on Zoloft for a short while...It really brought the life back in to me but I didn't like the side effects.I stopped them for a few months & started welbutrin Sunday..Not sure what to think about it..It made me sleepy first two days.Third day felt better with the feeling of some motivation but not enough to make me get up out of bed.Yesterday and today is the same as the third day. I just really want to feel normal..
depression,fejv1mm,t3_ephfp7,1579186502.0,"Idk bruh but it sounds like ya need more help than Reddit can give..And I mean that in the nicest way possible..I think you should seek professional help.In my personal opinion it doesn't sound like depression,at least not from my experience with it!!I wish the best though and hope you get this figured out soon!!!"
