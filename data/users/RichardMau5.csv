Looking at this square, we say the inner square is 1x1 and we want to know how ‘thick’ the surrounding square has to be, so that it is equal in area. Therefore we divide the outer band in two parts, squares and rectangles. An example of such a square is CIGJ.

Since the area of a square is length^2 and the length is the ‘thickness’ of the surrounding square we can say it’s x^2 . But we have for of those squares (one in every corner). So we have at least 4x^2 .

Now we didn’t account for some part of the shape, the rectangles GIKH and the likes. This area is equal to width x height, we know the width, since this is just the width of the white square which is 1, the height is again the ‘thickness’ and therefore x. Again we have 4 such shapes, so the area of the surrounding black square is 4x^2 + 4 and the area of the inner square is, as was stated before, 1.

We want those two to be equal, thus: 4x^2 + 4x = 1.

Coding one definitive way is different than to give accountants all the freedom to magicly invent stuff out of their head, creating cost-models nobody understands. My client has told me stories that nobody knows anymore how certain prices were calculated, but the models were too fucked up to edit them. Aside from that, I'm not here to question my clients motives for desiring a certain product.

>You’d be best either doing a view If the calculations aren’t so  expensive as to be done live , I’m guessing the row numbers aren’t that  big (billions) and provided the view can handle the calculation  requirements with regards to the query features required - views have  limited capabilities. Otherwise you’d be looking at a stored procedure  and returning the results from that.
