WV was essentially a blue state until that point.

It's also worth pointing out that a federal prisoner in another state [TX?] named Keith Russel Judd received a large part of the vote the 2012 primary in WV over Obama. The fear of the ""War on Coal"" was likely again the main driver."

Damnthatsinteresting,fdiuw5j,t1_fdijngo,1578451577.0,"I'm glad I posted it, then. I typed it out and said to myself, ""that is stupid. It's stupid."" Then I read it to myself 27 more times and said, ""don't. Don't post it. It's really dumb."" Then I posted it anyways.

You also changed my view on the word Blowie. I've never thought about how awkward it really is. It's like a cabby in Jersey is telling you about the ""broad"" you just saw at 3 AM in the dead of winter in a Borat bikini and boots."

I'm older.

Not skinny, either.

Never been to Michigan.

Feel free to come back here sometime.

It can be beautiful."

Our whole state is roads cut through mountains, surrounded by rock walls on either side. As layers erode, this will become more common."
CatastrophicFailure,fdfptn3,t1_fdfoz1c,1578367316.0,"After getting shots of the crash for about 15 minutes, I asked a State Trooper how bad the injuries were. He said ""he had some glass in his arm, but other than that he was okay."" I assumed he had been taken away in an ambulance.

30 seconds later, I see a small guy with a headset on, staring at the crash, holding an ice pack on his arm. It was the driver. I've seen a lot of crashes with trucks this size, and even when the other vehicle is destroyed, the truck is usually mostly unscathed. This one was bad. If he had a passenger, they likely would be severely injured."

My dad would blast this whole album when he took us literally anywhere, and this is the one song I really, truly loved. It's good to think about my dad, and it's a fucking good song. Thanks again, I was just here to find comments about how this owl can actually see, just not very well..."
