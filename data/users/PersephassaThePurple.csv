JapanTravel,fffpocd,t1_ff900xs,1579889089.0,"Definitely 2-3 days. I felt great once we got to Japan from Colorado, US. Going back I was exhausted the first day but the second day I was physically sick most of the day. I was trying to work but finally had to give up and go to bed. Day three being back I slept most of the day, but by day four of being back I was just ordinary tired. For me just one day was not enough."
JapanTravel,fffnfox,t3_estprh,1579887721.0,"Borderless was fantastic, and like PP mentioned it's close to Odaiba so you can do them both in a day. Just go knowing that it is busy - we went early on a weekday and it was still fairly crowded (one of the areas was a 60 minute wait).  

We also had a wonderful time at Disney Sea but make sure you have PLENTY of time to spend and you get there when it opens. There is plenty to do for young and old alike, and it's really unique.  Also, I'm not sure when you are going but know that summer is especially toasty there on blacktop - which means areas indoors are pretty crammed."
JapanTravel,ff7oxqr,t1_ff79gn7,1579654798.0,"Well, I lucked out. I actually shared this post and discussed further, we are going to try a car for part of the trip. :)"
JapanTravel,ff77xna,t1_ff77qhn,1579642883.0,:( Unfortunately this is a non-negotiable with my fiance. I was open to trying a day or two of driving but he is 100% opposed to getting a car. Definitely not a hill I want to die on (especially with honeymoon planning) even if it sounds like we would see so much more!
JapanTravel,ff77jlq,t1_ff5r9zq,1579642667.0,"I'm getting so excited for it! We wanted to see a lot without being too rushed about. Our trip to Tokyo was jam-packed every day. 

I am trying to think about clever ways to pack. We usually have one smaller suitcase and one larger, mostly so we can bring things back with us."
JapanTravel,ff778ud,t1_ff570rq,1579642504.0,We may be able to move some days around to make staying the night there work - we were planning an early morning tour the day after but we have time to move things. We will check out accommodations there. What ryokan did you stay at?
JapanTravel,ff775gw,t1_ff4mkaa,1579642451.0,"Thank you! I will have to check our luggage size, I really appreciate this!"
backpain,ff4ea19,t3_erf4bg,1579561551.0,"Thank you so much for sharing this! The last time I discussed options for second surgery, they had mentioned artificial discs but at the time they weren't really doing it for more than one disc. Good to know this is advancing, and that you are feeling so much better!"
backpain,ff4e19f,t1_ff4dua7,1579561388.0,"If you do, definitely make sure they know your full history and that they see/do imaging before they touch anything. I've been very happy with mine, as he specializes with disc issues. Traction devices (like the horrid Denner Roll) have been really helpful when I have an achy night. :) Don't lose hope, you'll get there!"
backpain,ff4d6ew,t3_ereik2,1579560822.0,"Can sympathize! I came to share that I ruptured 2 discs combined with scoliosis and significant stenosis. I suffered from drop foot, cauda equina, and ended up with a cane to support myself. I fell constantly, often had to crawl to get to the bathroom, and thought I was done with all of the outdoors stuff I love. Once the cauda equina ocurred I had immediate surgery (micro-discectomy on L4, L5-S1 and a laminectomy). I was off work for two months recovering, followed by physical therapy. This all happened at 26. 

While  I do still deal with some nerve issues in my left leg/foot, I am happy to say I hike (anywhere from 5-12 miles, including 2k ft. elevation changes), I run (albeit this has taken a lot of time and patience), and with a lot of guidance from physical therapists I can lift weights (deadlifts are out, though, as my discs are still unstable). I can't speak for golf - I will say I still avoid sharp twisting motions or anything with a lot of torque. 

I see a chiropractor, get deep tissue massages, keep up with PT stretches at home, use a TENs device, do salt soaks, use lumbar support, ice packs (not heat), IcyHot with lidocaine, and make use of ibuprofen. I don't take it now (thank goodness) but gabepentin got me through the worst of the nerve pain, despite the side effects I experienced at maximum dose. I also used medicinal cannabis for pain when opiods were suggested. Epidurals helped initially, as well.

Best of luck to you!"
backpain,fezk49z,t3_equef6,1579458187.0,Truly happy for you! I know that feeling of relief. While I took a long time to recover (multi-level discectomy with the laminectomy) that surgery was amazing. Hope your recovery goes well!
millionairemakers,fes5gjk,t3_eq81a8,1579361600.0,What a lovely idea. My cats (and my bank account) could certainly use it. Best of luck to all.
backpain,feijrs4,t1_feibllb,1579140150.0,"PT, with the right person, can work miracles. It has pulled me from the brink of fusion twice now. I wish you the best of luck, I know how horrible it is!"
backpain,fehprlx,t1_fec8iwq,1579121433.0,"Hey there - at 15 weeks I was definitely still having issues. Have you scheduled a follow-up, to see about a referral to PT or pain management?  


Personal things that helped for me (please check with your doc first):  
A cheap TENs unit  
Epsom salt soaks  
Icyhot w/lidocaine patches  
Using a knee separator while sleeping  
Frequent walking (slow, keep your navel drawn in for good posture)  
Lumbar rolls in all my chairs  
Posture pump (definitely check w/ doc before using one)  
Regular ibuprofen dosing (check w/doc)  


I'm starting to take magnesium, which my primary care doc suggested to help with the leg cramping. Ensuring you are in taking A LOT of water helps. There are some specific stretches PT advised that are very helpful, too."
backpain,fehp6be,t1_fdzvg4j,1579121091.0,">nerve flossing as outlined in Back Mechanic

You know, I didn't know this has a name! I do this occasionally while sitting around the house. But not frequently, I'll check out some videos and look at increasing frequency. Thanks!"
backpain,fehofz8,t3_ep2m86,1579120668.0,"I would tend to agree with your surgeons, this does not (from this image alone) appear to be something you would need to operate on - which is great! Have you tried physical therapy? Epidural injections? How is your weight?

I've had surgery and had full ruptures - what generally helped me (talk to your physician before any physical activity that moves your spine):  
Epidural steroid injections  
Very gentle yoga positions/stretches every night  
Use of a posture pump  
Epsom salt soaks  
Icy hot lidocaine patches  
Walking daily  
An inexpensive TENs unit  
Using a lumbar roll in my car, desk, etc.   
Using a pillow/knee separator for side sleeping  
Ice packs (heat will lead to further stiffening, even if it helps temporarily)  
Regular use of anti-inflammatories (check with your physician)"
cats,feev7bf,t1_feen6tu,1579041922.0,Thank you! We've now introduced them while Gandalf was in a carrier and that went well so tonight they will officially meet. :)
cats,feaj7rk,t1_fe698ax,1578949550.0,"He ended up being named Gandalf, though, we've thought about changing to Merlin!"
cats,fe9tp0n,t1_fe9t12g,1578941359.0,"Thank you! We've been wondering if being aloof was good or bad but I guess it's better than aggression or being obsessed. They have peeked one another through the door, and Mufasa looked at him for a moment before he carried on his own business. He seems to be his normal self around us too, thankfully."
cats,fe4kqkc,t1_fe4c209,1578860349.0,"Oh, Merlin would have been good too! We ended up on Gandalf - I don't know how I didn't consider Merlin!"
cats,fe3zk0b,t1_fe3x5ik,1578854349.0,Yes!
cats,fe3bnsn,t1_fe13dn9,1578847834.0,:) He was not a fan of me trying to get a picture last night and was definitely nervous. This morning he is a fiery ball of energy (who won't hold still for another picture).
