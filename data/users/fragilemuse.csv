A vehicle is greatly recommended, though I didn't have one until a year after I upgraded to 2nd AC. There are crew shuttles, but then you have to get up even earlier to TTC to the shuttle pickup point.

askTO,ff371bh,t1_ff27mb0,1579535213.0,I don't know why you are getting downvoted for this. Working in film is a very viable option and our industry is only getting bigger and bigger in Toronto.  We are like carnies with health benefits. haha.
askTO,ff36we2,t1_ff27yxb,1579535120.0,"This is a good option and you don't necessarily need to go to film school to do it. If you get some experience on non-union jobs, and/or apply to 873 in the spring when they are hurting for permits in all departments before the summer work explosion you will get work. Work does slow down in the winter, but if you save responsibly in the summer you can easily get by on dailies during the slower winter months. 

Your other option would be to [apply to IATSE 667 as a camera trainee](https://www.iatse667.com/en/about-us/join-iatse-667/).  You have to work as a trainee on a minimum of 6 shows (approx 8 weeks per rotation) to a max of 10, at minimum wage (plus OT). It takes between 1-2 years to complete the program before you can upgrade to 2nd AC.  If you don't have any non-union camera assisting experience it is recommended you take the [Sheridan College assistant workshops.](https://caps.sheridancollege.ca/products/MEDA70011__MotionPictureCameraAssistantWorkshop1.aspx) Unfortunately the deadline to apply to the trainee program has already passed for 2020, however if it was something you were interested in, it would give you time to take the Sheridan course and/or get on set experience before the next December deadline. 

If you have any questions about the IATSE 667 trainee program, please feel free to PM me. I am a 2nd AC (assistant camera) and have been working in the union for the past 5ish years."

toronto,feex42e,t3_eoo9px,1579043114.0,"I have lived in Parkdale for 9 years and it's already amazing how much has changed here. So many apartment buildings and halfway houses have been bought up and ""modernized"", displacing many low income tenants. My building has not been immune to this and we have been fighting ridiculous AGIs for years now. We went from not many cars parked on the streets, and the old beater cars that were there are now replaced with BMW's, Audi's, Range Rovers etc. People used to be scared to venture into Parkdale, now it's the ""cool"" place to be seen because we still have enough of that gritty, artistic edge with 50% less addicts hanging around. We don't have hookers outside the No Frills any longer. I'll never forget the night I saw a middle age white guy pull up in his BMW SUV to solicit the hugely pregnant girl who was working out there. She got in his car, I hope he paid her well. This was years ago, I hope her and her child are okay now, where ever they are. 

Some of what has changed in Parkdale has benefited the area, but a lot of what is to come will absolutely destroy what makes this neighbourhood so unique. There is such a strong sense of family and community here that can't really be found anywhere else in the city. People look out for each other here.  I haven't lived in Parkdale all my life, but I have lived here long enough to mourn what will be lost once we do become completely gentrified."

I don't know if she was just telling me friend to friend, because it was a lot to bear, but she just seemed so... casual in her telling. It was an absolutely heartbreaking story and if I was that girl I would absolutely NOT want such a story as general knowledge among my adoptive mother's friends, or even close family members.
