This was heartbreaking for me, I kept having hopes that this person will come back then I would try to make things better or I hoped that this person does want to message me but doesn't know what to say so that's some reasons why I broke NC, I was just missing this person too much, I felt guilty for what I did and how it unfolded but the last message, I got ignored then it clicked, I knew it was time, that talking it out wouldn't work, sorry's are getting boring and that this person moved on. It was my time to try, to move on and let go. Before the New Years, I blocked this person even if I didn't wanted to but I did this because maybe it was the best I could do, block and not look back. I just try to look back at the last messages too, that this person admitted they didn't wanted to work things out and I just told myself I deserve better, I deserve someone who is willing to work things out with me and I deserve someone who will fight for me when I fight for them. I knew this person wanted me in their life but it wasn't enough for them to stay and work things out.

Since then, I'm doing better, I still think about this person but its different, it's not a ""I miss you"" its more of a hoping they're doing okay and just because I think about them does not mean I want them. I deleted everything about that person and I suggest you try that if you haven't. Try new hobbies, make new goals and look after yourself. Time will pass and you will see better days. Right now, it's difficult because it happened recently where you feel like you want to fix things but I believe you will make it through this. Don't break your own heart by messaging your ex, that's only just going to hurt you more and you will feel that pain all over again because you may not get the results you want. On my end, I didn't get the results I wanted.. so yea it sucks. Don't be like me because it mentally destroyed me and it took months to just feel okay."
