SandersForPresident,ffeg3vo,t1_ffeflof,1579846675.0,"Right about the Emerson poll. The CNN poll from a couple days ago has Biden with a bigger margin of victory. Then there are other polls that also have Bernie ahead, so it's pretty even."

EntrepreneurRideAlong,ffdkkdy,t1_ff5zywg,1579822843.0,"Another angle, which I use, is I say ""recleaning or **partial** refund.""

If they want a partial refund I usually ask ""what do you think is fair?"" They usually come back with something relatively reasonable, so I refund them that and move on. I've avoided getting any negative reviews that way. 

In my 5 years only one or two clients have ever asked for a lot back. One of them had two cleaners cleaning for 5 hrs each and wanted a 100% refund. She disputed the charge on her credit card, but I won the dispute because I had text messages between us showing that she had agreed to a smaller refund, and that my cleaners did 10 man hours of work there. But that was one time in the last 5 years."
StayAtHomeDaddit,ffdh5iw,t1_ffccqwy,1579820762.0,"That's rough, man. I've mentioned this before, but when I was first staying at home, I started a housecleaning business. It's actually pretty successful. I know this is gonna sound like an advertisement but it's not, lol. I followed this dude's advice that started a sub called /r/entrepreneurridealong where he just documented the steps he took. I'm only making like $1k/mo but if I put ANY time at all into it I could be making more. I literally work like an hour a week. Everything is set up online so booking and payments and everything are like automatic. Check it out, there used to be lots of people in that sub asking questions and starting their own cleaning companies. If you're interested, that is.

Edit: I just looked at it for the first time in years and it looks like people are still pretty active."

Seahawks,ff52h0v,t1_ff4ztmy,1579578425.0,Mahomes is way more mobile than Peyton Manning was when we beat them. Look at the teams the Niners lost to this season. Ravens and Seahawks.
