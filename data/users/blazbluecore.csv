I believe most males who do last longer is usually because of want to and can stop themselves. Or they've had sex recently, or they're not that into their partner. If you think about the male and female orgasms, it's easy to trigger aslong as you know what you're doing. Obviously male orgasm being way easier to trigger for natural selection reasons."

Pretty sure research is not that sure. Especially since were missing a lot of data of ancient time sexual practices.  It's also possible that sexual behavior can vary from region to region, and time period to time period as well.
