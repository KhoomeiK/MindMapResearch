Ive felt consumed with guilt that maybe I could’ve been a better cat mom, and quite emotional, But all you can do is what you’re doing now, try to find a solution. Wishing you and your kitties lots of health and happiness!"
cats,fe3phjt,t1_fe2iygg,1578851650.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. A pet is more than a companion but family. I hope you find comfort in knowing you provided your kitties a warm, safe, and happy environment, and the love and happiness you both experienced and shared will forever live on, even if it’s thru photos or memories."
cats,fdr9l6z,t3_emplz5,1578681398.0,This is insanely cute ❤️☺️
cats,fdpg5ce,t1_fdndmsr,1578627755.0,"Lol same! I have conversations with them “I know buddy!” “No way? She said what???” I actually found a song that is quite soothing for both my boys too, lessens the meows: Clair de Lune by Flight facilities. Needless to say, it’s on repeat the whole way to the vets and back."
AskWomen,fdpfnf4,t3_embjaz,1578627390.0,"There were a lot of different things that added up over time. But looking back, the day he proposed to me was a clear sign. I hesitated to say yes. When we bought a house together, a few days after we got the keys to our house I broke down in the middle of the hallway unable to process these uneasy feelings. The fact that we didn’t seriously speak of getting married or make any plans to begin the process of it (after being engaged 2.5 years). The relationship was unhealthy, but having known this person for over 12 years, and having been together with him for 7 years it was difficult for me (and him I might even add) to even process how to even begin separating. I’ll never forget the Friday night we spoke of it in our back yard after much bickering and back and forth. He motioned the official break up and I simply replied “I agree.” And one tear rolled down my cheek. In the end it was the right decision. I knew it deep down in my gut all along."

Also, maybe this will resonate with you as it has with me -the wound is probably not your fault, but your healing is your responsibility. Best of luck treading forward!"
relationship_advice,fdkyyd3,t1_fdky92j,1578514046.0,"Actually, his mom has BPD, I had an inclination she might have some sort of personality disorder snd it was diagnosed officially after our breakup. Is it hereditary? My ex and I would speak frequently after the break up, but he was very angry with me sometimes, even tho he would initiate conversation. I would just ignore him when he became agitated or rude, because I didn’t want to end up becoming agitated too. Even tho he motioned the break up, to which I agreed because collectively we didn’t work well together, he is the one who up until a few months back would text or call me with nostalgic moments we had. So needless to say, the engagement came as a surprise but I felt nothing by it. Apparently he was “very concerned” about me hearing the news. But I always tell folks how I felt so emotionally exhausted after so many years in that relationship, I wasn’t aware of just how tired I was, until I was out of there. And after some time of course."
relationship_advice,fdky1ku,t1_fdkit5t,1578513507.0,"I agree. This happened to me. My ex fiancé I was in a relationship with for 7 years ended up getting into a relationship after relationship weeks after we split. It was heart wrenching truth be told. It’s been 1.5 years since we split and he’s now engaged with his latest. Sometimes life seems unfair- I’ve spent the last year working on myself, I feel much more emotionally stable. Yet, my dating life is non existent, which is weird because a new person would actually end up getting the beat version of myself now."

hiking,fdczzsl,t1_fdcy4th,1578289488.0,About how long did it take you to do the narrows and angels landing? I’ve been looking into Zion for some time and curious as to the difficulty of the trails and time needed to complete them
dating_advice,fdczefu,t1_fdcq1k1,1578288922.0,"This sounds awfully similar to my situation. The whole concept of dating or the current scene is not what I remember.,,apps weren’t as relevant before my last relationship (‘11-‘18) or at least not that I can recall. I’m a female btw, receiving unsolicited pics has never been a turn on for me but apparently they’re like a lot of men’s go to right off the bat from my experience. Little to no conversation just down to business. I often wonder if that’s what’s expected of me as well, to be complacent with that. Or perhaps we’re just wired for instant gratification now? That’s why it’s the norm to send and received such messages, pics, etc. just my two cents."
cats,fcuvnt5,t3_eiwz59,1577989482.0,She’s an absolute beauty! Sending neck scratches her way :)
dating_advice,fcuvfjc,t1_fcu802e,1577989348.0,"Very much agree with this. It’s important to compliment someone else, not complete them or expect them to complete you. The best investment you can always make is that with yourself :)"
dating_advice,fct4w6l,t1_fcr0p62,1577932951.0,"Agree. I’m 30 (f) and rusty at dating after a long term relationship of mine ended, but her behavior just sounded avoidant and rude altogether. Unfortunately sometimes excuses for this type of behavior is often overlooked or passed off as “nervousness” instead of a character flaw. Best of luck tho, @OP!"
