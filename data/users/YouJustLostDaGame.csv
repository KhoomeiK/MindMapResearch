The people you are asking me to vote for, instead of Trump have yet to convince me, that they would address any of the issues I have with my country any better than Trump would. They can convince me through statements and actions. If those actions include manipulation of the American people, something historically they HAVE done. Then I will not vote for them or support that.

All I am saying, is that if folks like you would put this effort into holding the DNC accountable. If you would help send a clear message that manipulation won't be tolerated.

This is an attempt to appeal to or invoke an emotion. Again, stick to the facts. You're not going to convince me or anybody like me to change my mind with this. It's childish and you look very silly. Stop. 

Now the facts. Bernie who is our most progressive candidate on issues you clearly care so much about such as climate change. The DNC and left wing media is once again clearly making a coordinate attack against the candidate who best represents your interests in favor of ensuring their own personal interests over what Sanders represents. Meaning the DNC itself would rather 4 more years of Trump instead of Sanders. Meaning they stand to lose more from Sanders than they do Trump.

So you're asking me to support an organization that supports Trump through its manipulation and inaction, and behaves with much of the same behavior I dislike Trump for but at a much lesser degree? And somehow, you think that's not only progressive, but also that ""I"" am the problem here?

If you folks would collectively start holding the DNC accountable and would make it clear that this isn't going to be tolerated, we wouldn't be having this discussion. Instead, here you are holding voters accountable for the actions of a political organization you view as a lesser evil.
