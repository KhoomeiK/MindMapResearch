And ng+ (up to ng+7) games are really popular because the enemies keep getting stronger. So sometimes you come at ng+3 and decide to use a specific weapon for that run just to see how that style plays

Then you have the replay value of a completely opposite build (melee vs magic very common), and now you already know the shortest route to your favorite weapon, and as said more than enough upgrade stuff around, especially lower, that you can get by with a bit lesser upgraded weapon till you reach it

You don't have any effective shields in Bloodborne, and taking the offensive is encouraged. Dark souls 1 & 2 have a much slower deliberate pace where shields can block all damage  where careful progressing is the better approach. His friend probably will be better at Bloodborne because of that

DS3 is a bit of a hybrid idea where the situation determens which approach to take in my experience, but has BB speed

The only reason the black and white one works because he is clearly mad, but not stupid, and sometimes think he might be just as intelligent as batman or more even which would be the reason he has so much trouble with him, and yes his mind games is what makes him so good

And this comparison is apt in that the best villains are usually the protagonist equal or sometimes even better, in which case a personality flaw causes their downfall often (Joker always tries to force a specific outcome which creates cracks in his plans).

And yes, would like more as well but I think they did this so you think about you write since you have a limited amount and to prevent too many of them"

VaatiVidya is the most known one and usually tries to stick to the facts as close as possible and normally mentions when he isn't quite sure. But do watch others as well, they can have very interesting insights and thoughts as well"

I would say Mad Max falls into that, fun game but nothing special, although the car combat is awesome I think it certainly isn't a masterpiece but it is also not a bad game. So, a solid 7/10 game it is.

Spread the word about this, so we can convoy our thoughts easier in the future!"

At least they do their own writing, which leads me to a bit of a sidetrack:

About hbo/got, haven't watched it myself, but heard enough that it looks like hbo finished it with a story of their own while from the books the last one wasn't done yet after many years, so they probably expected him to finish it during the series, when that didn't happen they sort of got in a bind, so had to come up with something themselves probably which is why it probably is so bad apparently

In the mean time he got sidetracked with Elden Ring lore writing instead, which I don't mind as a huge souls fan :), but I guess fans of the got hbo series are a bit less charmed about"

In the end, as long you enjoy the major part it isn't so bad some don't truly click, not everyone can be a winner for everyone. Just glad hzd & spiderman (& colossus) lived up to the reputation for me so far"
DarkSouls2,felq470,t1_feljanc,1579228208.0,"The only thing about frigid outskirts is that it is a relatively long trek. Just get the summon's to assist, stick close to the left side border, take a break in the last building and then run to the bridge once clear again and it really isn't that bad.

Unsummon if you want to solo it, or just bring vengarl along if you just want their souls (make sure to have warmth along to bring him to full hp first, use rings if need be)

And a few secondary ones, Last of us (did not like sadly, story is ok but mechanics felt bad), Second son (only played most of the beginning but seems ok), Shadow of the colossus (a few bosses in, like it)

Don't regret buying a ps4 either"

They aren't here for your convenience, they are here to make money, you liking it is just a side effect to them, they couldn't care less if you like it as long as it makes money

Just look at EA to see how it works. Everyone may hate it yet they still make buckets of money

edit: people don't like the truth as usual it seems, you can hide from it but that doesn't make it go away"
Sekiro,fejker2,t1_fejix6y,1579177841.0,"They used whatever needed for the job, sword was just a tool as I already said. And I never said anything about their skills, just their philosophy differences, where a samurai values a sword highly, a shinobi does not, because once again it is just a tool in an arsenal of tools, and while you may use Ki techniques, a lower quality sword will still break faster than a higher quality sword

You have a point about Wolf specifically though, it is even a named sword which you probably wouldn't do for a throw away sword. This is just where the game differs with how a shinobi in reality would view it"
