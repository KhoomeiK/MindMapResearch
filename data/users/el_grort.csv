Though it is probably quite possible for you, if you wanted. Our fields were worth only a hundred quid half a century ago, and the government has been wanting to keep crofting alive in the Highlands since the World Wars, when the Glens were emptied of their young people.

Part of the problem is it was mostly seen with the EDL and football hooliganism, so it suffered by association. Something not helped by the fact it really doesn't have any different connotation politically (unlike Wales and Scotland, which sort of spares the Saltire from being sullied by association with the SDL).

Even in the Union, it somewhat continued, though centred in the Highlands, whose competition with the lowlands (the Lord of the Isles plotted with England to form an alliance against Scotland) spread towards England (Jacobite Rebellions). Comparitively, Wales was consumed relatively early. Northern Ireland is... a weird case and one I am no way informed enough to dip my toes into.

England and Wales will be closer due to tied history of extensive shared rule. Scotland and Northern Ireland have... a weird relationship.

AskEurope,fexyxo9,t1_fewf20a,1579438529.0,"I mean, it is more recent than the Scottish Wars of Independence, as the Macdonald Lordship of the Isles (and with it a semi-autonomous Gaelic-Norse power) was ended in 1493, with various rebellions attempting to reassert the independence of the Gaelic-Norse Scottish Isles occuring in 1501-1505 and 1545. Worth remembering that that region was the third most powerful force in the British isles after the Scottish and English monarchies, and due to it's relatively isolated geographic locatiom compared to England and even Scotland, probably retained more of the culture. It certainly had a more recent impact than you give credit and had no real force to cause sweeping changes.

Ornkney was absorbed by Scotland from Norway in 1472, as was Shetland. So the Islands, both the semi-independent Gaelic-Norse in the West and Norweigin ruled North, retained considerably direct Nordic influence until much more recently than suggested. Worth remembering Scotland, even when unified remained a rather fractured nation, with the Highlands and Islands butting heads with southern Kings not infrequently arguably into the 18th century.

As I said, while the link isn't particularly strong and is concentrated largely in peripheral territories, it does exist, albeit largely in opposition to the domination of lowland Scots. And I'm mot saying we have strong ties to the Nordics, and they aren't as strong as to England, as the populous regions of Scotland are much more intertwined obviously with them, just that there is a connection of some note/worth."

If it gets to the point something like Vox takes power, yeah, absolutely no route in, but even when the PP was in power, I think they were indicating they would play ball if they UK seceded it. That doesn't really run contrary to their view, which is that it is the UK decision, not Scotlands (Spain's decision, not Catalonias), and they aren't likely to headbutt such a legal exit as that anymore than they would the UK ceding territory it controls (say, Gibraltar to Spain), so long as, in their view, it is the UK making the decision."
AskEurope,few14xq,t1_feumjo8,1579403996.0,"It's really distantly connected, you could make an argument. The Northern Isles were, iirc, under Norweigin rule for a fair period, the Western Isles and parts of the coast also fell under viking rule before transitioning into to the Norse-Gaelic Lord of the Isles. That said, the Highlands and Islands have around 250k inhabitants while the southern regions, such as the central belt (3.5million), was closely intertwined with England (including several attempts to annex regions such as Carlisle under David I). Gaelic, a more strongly felt part of 'Scottish' culture than anything Nordic is confined to the Highlands and Islands, and the Norse-Gaelic regions afforded the derogatory term of 'teuchter' by lowlanders.

Huh, where I've worked you can only buy two packets and then you can't be sold more, though that might be specifically local/business side as we're up north where suicide rates are higher.

And on knives, definitely. Domestic violence turned stabbings was an issue in some places, so local police advised keeping knives not on a magnet strip or one of those stands, where knives are easier to access, but in a drawer, so that there was just that little extra time to let cooler thoughts prevail, instead of being instantly able to draw a knife from the countertop. And iirc, it helped. But such things will earn mockery by those determined that there are no ways to mitigate such violence."
