depression,fdpkuj7,t3_emltpx,1578631415.0,"Trust me when I say that you doing the responsible thing such as seeking treatment will make her feel less of a failure than if you actually died. As for the way it will effect you, I dont know where you live but self admittance usually wont do anything. Its if you have to be court ordered into psychiatric care that is where things can get a little muddy. A mental health facility is probably the safest place, depending on where it is and the crew there. Trust me, those places are more secure than Ft. Knox"

ForeverAloneDating,fc9etye,t1_fc9an5e,1577551606.0,"If I may offer some advice. For the love of God PLEASE maintain aircraft for like 5 years minimum before designing. Reason I say this, not as a personal attack so please dont take it that way, is because so many times we have encountered way over designed area that at best makes doing our job longer and at worst makes it damn near impossible to do. Case in point. Lear jets. Lear jets are NOT maintenance friendly at all. It's like someone built the inside of the plane and then slapped a shell over it. The newer bigger planes are getting easier to maintain but occasionally they can give us problems. Oh and on behalf of aircraft mechanics everywhere, if you ever find the inventor of Skydrol, do us all a favor and drown him in it."
