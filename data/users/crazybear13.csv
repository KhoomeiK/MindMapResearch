AskWomen,fekwmw5,t3_epjce4,1579209128.0,"I have a friend who is more my husband's friend than mine. He's got these weird hang ups and beliefs about women that might be generational or cultural (he grew up in new Zealand and Australia in the late seventies/ early eighties.) He tells me things like my brain is smaller than a man's, which means I'm not as smart as men. Or, that waitresses eyes dilated when she looked at your husband. She's obviously attracted to him sexually. Everyone at the table face palmed. He didn't get it.

The thing is, he's not trying to be mean, it's just what he thinks. Women are sort of an animal to be studied in his eyes. He's very awkward with women in general and has never been able to have a steady relationship with anyone. If my husband didn't want to maintain the friendship I wouldn't be friends with him anymore, but for better or worse he is occasionally in my life. My husband believes we're a good influence.


All that being said he has helped with our wedding, made us Christmas dinner, and let me stay at his place while we were transitioning from one state to another. 

I don't think he hates women per say. I think he doesn't know how to see them as anything other than lesser. There have been interventions. Our other guy friends have taken him aside and told him that if he can't say anything nice about a woman, to just not speak at all. He is definitely a bit of a project friend for our group. He has taken to saying ""well, you know my thoughts, but I'm not allowed to say anything.""

My approach is to try and understand that his world view is different and no matter how I try to convey that women aren't objects or animals to study, he's just not willing to see me as anything other than a subservient woman.  I have had some conversations that ended in me yelling at him and he didn't understand why I'm upset. I've literally yelled ""who hurt you!!!""

With that in mind I tolerate him the best I can and my husband pats me on the back for trying."

breastfeeding,fdo33yd,t3_em9jpx,1578598013.0,"IDK where you live, but this is unacceptable. If it's the US your boss has literally violated every law for employers when it comes to breastfeeding. If you know what your laws are I would educate her. Don't let them bully you into not breastfeeding. It's not fair and it's already hard enough on working mom's who have to go back so early and lose so much bonding time.

https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5d7a45b2e4b0a938a42ef3f5

This article talks about some laws and struggles in general. You shouldn't be crying at work over this. She should be supportive. I hope this helps, and I seriously think that if any woman is having issues at their job over breast pumping. I'd be more than happy to go to that place and breast feed while making hard eye contact with management."

They take my baby and I don't worry because in five minutes he'll be back in my arms because he cries at everyone else. I'm home base for him. You're home base for your LO. Your MIL can never take that away from you."

So they are cute, but it's also cool to see how they grow. And you're gonna laugh so hard when they fart. It's seriously hilarious how loud a noise such a tiny thing can make."
