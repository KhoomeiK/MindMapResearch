DMAcademy,ffbtuw9,t3_esrxn1,1579782541.0,"I think it depends on the world. 

In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, ""magic items"" are mostly pretty mundane by their own standards. In D&D standards they would be fantastic. ""Deals extra fire damage."" ""This armor makes you slightly invisible."" But you can buy them from any magic shop, or even some of the more generic stores. Sounds great in D&D terms, but in Oblivion? Those are pretty mundane. 

The problem occurs when people mix their worlds up. A campaign that wants to be as gritty as Lord of the Rings, by nature, cannot include a lot of magic. Or at least not mundane magic, and it'll have a lot more subtle and primeval nature to it. 

A high-magic world in D&D terms would include lots and lots of items from the Xanathar's Guide ""Common Magic Items"" list. Things like ""a cape that flows behind you as a bonus action,"" or ""clothes that magically mends itself."" Even in a high-magic setting, you have to use common sense to dictate what would and wouldn't be common. 

But people think ""high-magic"" and think, ""Oh, I can buy a Deck of Many Things from any traveling merchant."" Smartphones are pretty common in our world, which can do amazing things, but are .50 cal machineguns? No, not really. Well, hopefully not where you are. 

You have to consider what would and wouldn't be mundane and what would be extraordinary in your world. 

I'm currently DMing an Oblivion magic-level campaign and my players can never find anything like a Flametongue Sword, but they can find plenty of stuff like beads of nourishment/refreshment, or magical capes that just look cool, and other really mundane magical stuff that no adrenaline junkie adventurer would be interested in. Except for maybe the beads of food/water. 

I don't think D&D 5E lends itself too well to low-magic unless you're playing with gritty realism and your players have stated they want a rough and tumbled campaign. I think it's best at a middle-magic, maybe a step or two below the Elder Scrolls, where there are magic swords in dungeons, but not from shopkeepers. Although shopkeepers would sell things like spellcraft materials, or maybe some Xanathar's Guide ""common magic items."""

Again, there are a hundred other gun companies to fill the void.

I don't know, same reason drugs are illegal? People are afraid of things they don't understand. To my knowledge, no mass shooting has ever been done with a .50 cal rifle, and any Jack can buy one with a few pieces of paper and some extra dollars. Most shootings are done with easily concealable firearms like pistols, which is something we should be regulating more. 

[And their gun bans sure haven't done much to stop shootings yet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shootings_in_California)"

If you've got the big, crunchy tomatoes like beefsteak tomatoes, you've got a solid base for [some gratin tomatoes](http://www.oahufresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gratintomatoes1.jpg). Cherry tomatoes are great for salads and as a base for ketchup and a lot of people say roma tomatoes are the best for making sauces. 

I think a lot of people who don't like tomatoes probably have tasted [roma tomatoes](https://www.lovemysalad.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_carousel_item_768/public/4071.jpg?itok=zAih1xkJ) which in my opinion are usually pretty... chunky? and a little bitter-ish just on their own. [Beefsteak tomatoes](https://d1nw62gticy6e9.cloudfront.net/uploads/Beefsteak_Tomato.jpg) are fantastic and anyone who claims to not like them should probably go buy 2 or 3 and try them (just to ensure you get a good one). They're very sweet and juicy. 

Tomatoes are about as diverse in flavor and texture as apples. There are a dozen different kinds that all taste and feel very different."
