rich people: pay taxes on capital gains and income  
  
Somehow this equals the rich not paying their fair share? I've tried to be patient with your whiny nonsense but this argument has become utterly stupid with your faux outrage and bitching. Rich pay their fair share.  
/thread"
todayilearned,fgh5c1b,t1_fgg9e6u,1580777055.0,"To your last point, considering that you have already asserted that the wealthy are the only people benefitting from capital gains, it would be irrelevant as to how much they pay in capital gains because the poor don't pay capital gains taxes. So either their tax burden is 40% OR HIGHER if you're suddenly including capital gains. Which you are doing. Your little diatribe here is nonsensical and you're getting very angry because I suspect your emotional pleas have not been recognized in the way you hoped.  
  
I'm going to say this to close:  
Poor people are poor by and large because they are bad with money, not because they are systemically oppressed and abused by rich people, and poor people are not entitled to be taken care of by wealthy people.   
  
Examine the average poor person and you will notice that they do not make good financial decisions and that is no one's fault but their own."

todayilearned,fge39qo,t1_fg847o2,1580690362.0,"So now we've switched to capital gains tax from income tax.   
  
You've completely changed the argument. I agree capital gains should be taxed more heavily.  
  
However a large portion of your posts is centered around importing motive to people who argue against increasing income taxes on the rich. This argument is based around statements such as ""you just don't care about poor people"".  And it's utter nonsense."

todayilearned,fg77iic,t1_fg6wked,1580585813.0,"Because the rich already pay the majority of taxes. 40% of americans DO NOT PAY TAXES. The 1%, which owns ~40% of the wealth as of the most recent stats, pays about 40% of the taxes. The next 10% pays 80% (including the 1%).  
  
You're not improving life by taking money under penalty of force and handing it to people.  
  
Again while I believe greed is immoral, I don't think anyone alive has the right to say ""You can only make up to X amount of dollars.""     
  
Let's put it this way. The people in the bottom 40% are not there simply because they have been taken advantage of.   
  
The top 3 things that contribute to poverty are   
1. Having a kid out of wedlock
2. Not finishing high school
3. Not holding a job  
  
Those are all easily attainable. And the fact that people still cant meet them means most of their monetary troubles are self inflicted"

todayilearned,fg5tom0,t1_fg5s04n,1580538487.0,"Because let's put it this way. The majority of people *don't* have the drive, the work ethic, and the creativity to do what people like Jeff Bezos did. People aren't equal in that regard.
  
Second, I will agree with you that *greed* is immoral. Nobody *needs* a billion dollars. However I also believe in a set of inalienable rights and one of those things includes property rights. Simply put, other people are not entitled to your stuff just because. Just because you have more than someone else doesn't mean they are entitled to have it redistributed to even things out.  
  
I don't like suffering. I don't like that people are poor (for the most part, there are some people who deserve to be poor because they do it to themselves). However I absolutely will not support voting away people's right to their property to cure such a problem.  
  
The problem with redistributionism is that someone has to set a line that marks where it begins, and that line is inevitably going to be, at its core, arbitrary. And I don't think there is anyone or any group that is entitled to set that line.  
  
I also don't believe in legislating morality. I believe greed immoral yes, but I don't believe in compelling people to do the right thing. Giving to people in need is altruistic, but when it's taken by force it is no longer altruistic. Any property or wealth gained by legal means should be yours to do with as you will, regardless of ""how much you have"". 
  
And I believe that any democracy in which people can vote themselves more money will destroy itself.   
  
*""A democracy can only exist until the voters realize they can vote themselves largess from the public treasury.""* - Alexis de Tocqueville (attributed)  
  
The fact of the matter is that a plurality (40%)  of americans pay no taxes, yet overwhelmingly benefit from everything that taxes offer. It's absolutely asinine to suggest that the rich don't ""pay their fair share"" when in reality they pay the lion's share.  
  
As to your early claim that goods are sold for more than they are ""worth"": Of course, what's wrong with profit? It's literally the only incentive human's universally recognize, which is self benefit. I don't think profit is unfair, because it's governed by what people are willing to pay. When you buy something at market value, you get the thing that you paid for. A voluntary exchange in which both parties agree on the price. If something is too expensive for its value, people don't buy it. Otherwise by simple logic, obviously it's worth the price to them. No one is being *forced* to buy something they don't find valuable (except on the topic of healthcare but that's a far more nuanced and unnavigable subject than simple goods and services).   
  
You have to operate under reality, not in some imaginary idealism in which everyone shares voluntarily. That world doesn't exist.  
  
TLDR: greed is immoral, but forced requisition is immoral too."

todayilearned,fg5n2zs,t1_fg5ikz9,1580532095.0,"Nope. Wealth is not finite. If person A has 10 dollars and person B has 1 dollar, that doesn't mean person A stole it from person B.  
  
Furthermore, regardless of how wealthy the top 1% is, poor people in the united states are still far more materially wealthy than 100 years ago, have better standards of living, and access to far more resources and opportunities than any other time in history, and additionally are better off than most other countries in the world.   
  
Those people in the 1% that you are so envious of, and I mean that, *envious*, are by and large the individuals who have created the scenario by which untold numbers of people have prospered by.   
  
When I say envious, I mean you wanting what they have despite not having done anything worth even 1% of what they have.   
  
It's quite hilarious to hear people whine about the 1% and then examine their lives and accomplishments and realize the overwhelming majority of them have accomplished little to nothing, have no drive or ambition to do so, and want what they do not have without any such reasoning other than ""it's unfair"".  
  
No, what's unfair is the idea that you are entitled to an equal slice of the pie despite having been already compensated for your labor in such a way that was negotiated between you and your employer, which you agreed to, and then are complaining about after the fact."

AdviceAnimals,ff8elpn,t1_ff8dunj,1579675192.0,"Infant mortality is a misleading statistic. I am always confused as to why that is mainstay of such arguments. When you actually look at the data, you will realize that there is are a few reasons not accounted for that do not relate to our medical system that artificially inflate US infant mortality statisics.  
  
#1: US statistics are calculated by including those births that would otherwise be considered stillbirths in other countries. What I mean by this is that premature babies that die following birth are considered live births despite their extremely low chances of survivial. The US considers its doctors the best among the nations in caring for  premature babies, therefore it would be a disservice to the skill of our doctors to consider these births and deaths ""eventual"".    
  
#2: A high prevalence of fertility treatments which lead more often to twins and triplets, which have poorer survival rates, is a contributing factor to reportable deaths.  
  
#3: Most notable to me is the alarming SIDS rate in the US. SIDS is the 3rd leading cause of infant mortality in the US. An overwhelming majority of these deaths are due to preventable situations or injuries, most notably that mothers in the US, especially among less affluent communities, do not follow AAP sleeping guidelines for infants which dictate that lying faceup on their back is the safest position for infants and young children, and has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of SIDS."

AdviceAnimals,ff8ctzu,t1_ff8bbgd,1579673251.0,"44% of americans don't pay income tax.  
That means the tax burden is distributed across the remaining 54%. The top 1% holds approximately 40% of the country's wealth, but also has the highest marginal tax rate of about ~39%  
  
I don't stats on australia to compare 1:1 but it would damn interesting to have equivalent stats to see what percent of the populations actually pay taxes.  
  
So if you are going to raise taxes, it's not going to be on that 44%. Your claim that ""there are more people paying taxes"" doesn't exactly work out like you think it would because the US has a very large class of americans paying no or negligible taxes."
AdviceAnimals,ff8c7xj,t1_ff89zf4,1579672612.0,"The question is, is it sustainable? This is massive undertaking in which we are attempting to subsidize every single sick person. Those people are a massive drain (no offense it's just a fact), on the total resources within the system. I'm not saying high premiums for having a lifelong illness are good, but can we actually afford to sustain paying for them without offsetting the cost somehow? The whole idea of risk pools is that the risk is balanced around everyone in the pool, and your premium is a reflection of that. However when you put everyone in the same pool, including those with severe health issues and of course, those who simply willfully treat their body like shit, you are draining resources from the healthy individuals who aren't really benefitting."
