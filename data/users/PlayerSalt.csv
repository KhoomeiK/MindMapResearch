pathofexile,fen0v4r,t3_epyi4y,1579274462.0,"i personally feel the major core issues lies with how defences work in poe 

hp/armour/resistances/evasion/es/dodge/incoming damage conversion, etc etc

because of how different the defence types are and the fact they all respond differently to melee and spells it makes ballance harder

a hard hit needs to be at least scary to one build but not 1shot every other build

for example how do you make a melee hit scary to an armour based build without 1shotting an evasion build if it hits.

this is actually the core reason a hell of a lot of hits in poe are at least two different types of damage combined.

to their credit they have put a good bit of effort into gameplay design around this especially in 3.9 core bosses relying heavily on out playing mechanics and resistances rather than a core defence type.

personally id prefer if poe was ballanced a bit more around 30% and 60% damage hits but its very difficult to do that unless mobs actually delt damage based on your life rather than flat damage. i am also sure having mobs deal % damage would create a whole list of other problems.

its also a conscious decision by ggg , they want poe to be a dangerous game where you can easily die not a more theme park type experience. i think the main issue players have with this is late game when oneshots happen with nothing to learn or a way to out play it. 

people want to feel like they can improve and out play content , early game on the beach every time you die you could have done something about it but very late game there is often deaths even if you had double the eHP you would still be dead.

ages back now they decided to make life quite a bit easier to get and the direction seems to be encouraging life as a sponge in the same way ES works that way. its something i have though a lot about over the years but ive never been able to think of a great fix without pretty core defence changes.

the other aspect of it is often bullshit 1 shot mechanics exist in new leagues , like bosses can have 1 shot mechanics and things like bearers and very specific instances where there is a gameplay or telegraph mechanic to out play them. but the thing is plenty of 1 shot mechanics creep in that dont give players any lesson to learn or way to play around them

I actually started playing poe in HC , i dont think i could imagine playing the modern endgame there now with some of the more recent league mechaics, i guess i have also moved on a bit as a player and just accept deaths are a part of poe, 3.9 has plenty of dangerous content and thats great but i no longer want to play the game so safe i never die because id never experience some of the best aspects of the game

unlike some other games death is just a part of poe, you can just take the door where kt does not matter or bang your head against a wall"

JoeRogan,fejz4do,t3_epk87r,1579189127.0,"hes essentially talking about taxing meat production because farming animals has an impact on the enviroment

Its a hard pill to swallow but i like yang he at least is bringing up stuff we should at least be talking about"

still not played it but i mean to pickup outer worlds

there is also a nice arcade style spaceship rpg that came out on epic about 4 months back thats great and i still need to finish

you will notice stormwind its shaped in a way you dont see much of the town at the same time , this was a design decision because they had concerns of how much they can display at the same time and not cause fps issues
