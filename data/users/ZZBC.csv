I will say, all puppies nip. They go through a teething stage and it’s something they have to be taught not to do. Ignoring cats is also something that will need to be taught and how much a dog wants to chase a cat is also impacted by the cat’s behavior. A cat that runs as soon as it sees a dog is going to be a lot harder for a dog to resist chasing than one who calmly walks away or ignores the dog."

BostonTerrier,fevxkgu,t1_fevuuvd,1579402775.0,"You can disagree all you want, the fact is that simply increasing genetic variety does not ensure healthy offspring. It’s not about just having genes in common or not, it’s about which specific genes are being passed on. Illnesses like hemophilia in humans or juvenile hereditary cataracts in dogs are caused by specific genes, and yes carelessly breeding closely related dogs can lead to increased chances of these illnesses. What you’re ignoring is that we are now able to perform genetic testing and track pedigrees and responsible breeders ensure that they are not passing these diseases along.  And again, just because two dogs are different breeds does not mean that they can’t carry the same genes for the the same genetic issues or be prone to similar structural issues."
BostonTerrier,fevha4d,t1_ferxwvt,1579397419.0,"There’s a good bit of misinformation in this post. Let’s start with your ascertain that size and otherwise conforming to the breed standard doesn’t matter unless you want to show.  The purpose of a breed standard is to describe the ideal specimen of a breed; not just in physical appearance but in temperament. It describes what makes each breed special. The note that people ignore the standard and intentionally breed dogs that do not fit that description, the more likely you are to lose the traits that make a breed what they are if someone does not care about particular traits then there are lots of dogs in shelters that need loving homes and make wonderful companions. Part of a breeder’s job is to preserve the breed as we know and love it and so anyone purchasing a purebred dog should support those who are breeding responsibly. 

Second let’s address the insinuation that well bred dogs/show dogs are inbred and that mixes are healthier.  Absolutely, repeated breedings of close relatives can have health consequences, however responsible breeders are very careful about what dogs they pair together, study pedigrees, and keep track of the co-efficient of inbreeding if it’s a concern in the breed. Bostons are not a rare breed and so there is a lot less concerns about inbreeding. There is a big misconception that mixed dogs are healthier, but the fact that two dogs are not closely related does not mean that they will have healthy puppies. Responsible breeders perform xrays to check for issues like luxating patella and spinal problems and perform genetic testing to test for issues like hereditary  juvenile cataracts prior to breeding, something the vast majority of designer dog breeders are not doing. The other thing is that each breed has unique skeletal and muscular structure, when you mix breeds you can end up with combining dogs that have incompatible structure and creating dogs that are prone to joint issues etc because they are not balanced and proportional. Also even if the dogs are of different breeds they may still be prone to many of the same genetic issues."

BostonTerrier,ferwsuo,t1_fertg4k,1579359129.0,Yeah the whole “old rare variety” is just a marketing tactic used by backyard breeders to justify over sized dogs. Some size variation happens but you don’t see 40lb dogs being produced from responsibly bred litters.

At the novice level it’s short and straight but once you move up to open it has a 90 degree turn and that can make some dogs nervous. The biggest tip I can give is step back, be quiet, and let your dog work. Your dog needs to hunt independently and the more you talk the more you’re pulling their attention back to you. I get chatty when I’m nervous so that’s been a big thing for me.

As far as practicing at home you can make tunnels out of chairs and blankets and you can encourage hunting behavior by hiding treats around the house and playing other find it type games."
dogs,fekxxkm,t3_epo2jt,1579209898.0,"One easy way to tell if play is getting too rough is to separate the dogs and release the one who is the receiving end of the rough behavior first, if they leave play was getting too rough, if the re-initiate play it’s likely all good. Some dogs are more vocal than others during play. Look for loose wiggly body language, stiff bodies and tails, even if they’re wagging, can be a sign of stress."
dogs,fekwlbq,t3_eppkh0,1579209102.0,I suggest you fill out the breed questionnaire to get better recommendations. Usually getting a APBT or similar breed while renting is not a good choice as many places do not allow you to rent with those breeds. The APBT was bred for dog fighting.

BostonTerrier,feix3ni,t3_ep8kmn,1579149607.0,I forgot to mention dental care. Bostons have the same amount of teeth as a dog with a longer muzzle and so are prone to tooth crowding.

Grooming is super minimal with this breed. A Zoom groom will help loosen deaf hair but you that’s all you need for brushing. Get a good quality shampoo. Nail maintenance is going extremely important and you want to start introducing that ASAP, the nails should not click on the floor. As for diet, stick with what the breeder is feeding at first and if you change food do so very slowly. Feed a food that meets World  Small Animal Veterinary Association guidelines, Purina ProPlan is great and many Bostons do well on it.

dogs,fefqfgt,t3_eox3aj,1579062261.0,"So Morkies are a mix, not an actual breed. It is highly unlikely that anyone breeding them is doing so responsibly. Was this litter bred intentionally?  I strongly suggest reading the guide on how to identify a responsible breeder. https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/identifying_a_responsible_breeder"
k9sports,fefmrpb,t3_eo3vxv,1579059706.0,Archer and I had a really good second agility class. He did a great job waiting in a down stay while other dogs did there turns. He had a tough time with his around and tunnel at first but his second time he did great. We do need a bit more practice at not taking the tunnel every time and on him looking forward for his reward. I may need to use some bigger or lighter colored treats for that because he had a hard time tracking tossed treats. He absolutely rocked the beginnings of a start line behavior and we made some progress with him staying on side of me.
k9sports,fefly7r,t1_fedipex,1579059163.0,This is a more nuanced version of what I have been doing.
k9sports,feflq1h,t3_eoq2cl,1579059017.0,"Archer has a few in several sports. 
Barn Hunt: Instinct and Novice, he has one Q towards Open
Coursing: Coursing Ability Advanced, he needs 14 more for his Excellent. He also has 98.28 points towards his BCAT
Trick Dog: Trick Dog Advanced through AKC and Expert Trick Dog though DMWYD that hasn’t been transferred to AKC yet"
dogs,fefizih,t3_eou6r6,1579057319.0,I’m sorry this happened to you. Puppyspot is a well known broker for mills and anyone willing to support mills is willing to do other unethical stuff.
dogs,fefh6tb,t3_eovv3s,1579056244.0,Feeling a little off the day after a vaccine if normal and vet visits can be stressful for many dogs. Keep an eye on it and consult your vet if anything else concerning happens.
dogs,fefa5xg,t3_eouzh9,1579051793.0,Trick training and sniffing games!  Those are my go to indoor activities. Both provide mental stimulation as well as some exercise. You can also do some fitness and conditioning work with little to know equipment.
BostonTerrier,fef9yk7,t3_eouwp7,1579051657.0," The only way to tell if you are giving your dog the correct amount of food is by putting your hands on them and checking their body condition. If she’s gaining weight, cut back on the food. Here’s a good chart. [Body Condition](https://www.wsava.org/WSAVA/media/PDF_old/Body-condition-score-chart-dogs.pdf) The ideal can vary a bit with breed and age, it’s perfectly normal to see several ribs or even hip bones on a sighthound breed like a greyhound because of the way they are built. For Bostons I prefer to keep them on the leaner side of ideal because being overweight can exacerbate many of the health issues they can be prone to."
dogs,fed9rn2,t3_eok1n8,1579004962.0,"The tail docking should have been just a few days after birth so that should be healed. As for the ears, your vet should let you know about any after care and your breeder should teach you how to post them so they stand correctly."
dogs,fecd52p,t3_eoeuzl,1578971118.0,That sounds reasonable
dogs,febwidi,t3_eod8tz,1578963505.0,"He’s marking. This isn’t about him needing to pee so puppy pads and taking him out more aren’t likely to be super helpful, it’s a habit you need to break. You may want to get a bellyband in the meantime to save your furniture while you work on the issue. You want to interrupt him before he starts lifting his leg."
OpenDogTraining,feazthk,t3_eo9ikp,1578953978.0,"It depends on what the purpose of your walk is. I rarely use walks to practice obedience. Most of our walks are decompression walks and also for exercise. There isn’t a reason for my dog to be heeling other than when we are passing someone, which is maybe a handful of times on an hour long walk. Sniffing is relaxing for dogs and also provides scent enrichment."
