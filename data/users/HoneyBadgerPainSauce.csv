Showerthoughts,ffgbs8l,t1_fffxio6,1579902759.0,"The books also explain how there are other male lions in the Pridelands, so Nala isn't Simba's half-sister or cousin. And also it's implied between all the media that ""Kopa"" the baby lion from the end of Lion King was murdered by hyenas and that's why Simba is overprotective of Kiara, and why the tribe of banished lions exists.

Edit: I looked into it more, and even in the novelization of the new movie, the cub is still listed as Male. So I guess its death is halfway canon?"

halo,fel7ekp,t1_feju8p8,1579215663.0,Not to mention the Infinity's entire accompanyment of SPARTANS can't be used because Gen2 MJOLNIR is susceptible to the Created. I assume that is gonna be the reason for Chiefy's new set of Gen3.

halo,fei2c5o,t1_fehyi6a,1579128743.0,"I've been playing the game since CE, and without a doubt 5 has the best multiplayer. People who claim the modernization of the game has ""ruined it"", are nothing but nostalgia ninny's, who will always find something to bitch about even if Infinite released with a carbon copy of 2 or 3's mechanics. You can't make them happy, and if I was 343, I wouldn't even try. Going back to old mechanics would kill the game now."
halo,fehy4tc,t1_fehg175,1579126205.0,"This is the only correct answer in this thread. Spartan movement in game, should be as close a replica to their actual movement capabilities in the canon as possible. It makes no damn sense for one of sci-fi's most powerful warrior classes ever to be reduced to brisk walking and the ability to jump higher than most other games."

There's actually more smaller splinter groups too, but none of them are big enough to be considered a ""faction"" IMO."
