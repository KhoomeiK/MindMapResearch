- An option to disable camera movement when an incident happens or when a dweller is born (it's pretty annoying when there are multiple babies ready to be born and not on the area the camera goes to when one is born, or when you are about to do something but an incident happens and takes right to where it's happening (i think instead they could just sound the alarm and have an arrow or something point to where the incident is happening so you can go there yoursel instead of being forced to go there)).    
- An option to unequip weapons from an entire room or to transfer all weapons from dwellers of one room to dwellers of another (it causes me a lot of trouble when dealing with deathclaws or radscorpions since i don't have many weapons)."
