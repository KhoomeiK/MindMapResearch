And what's worse, the one friend I had that actually had a child with an autoimmune disorder has forcefully subjected her son to groups of unvaccinated children to ""make him healthier"" and I'm so horrified. I was one of the unlucky teens to get H1N1 way back when (WORST. FEVER. HALLUCINATIONS. OF. MY. LIFE.) And I'm STILL considered a carrier.  And I'm suddenly the evil one for not wanting to kill her kid with something that had me *literally* quarantined for three weeks. Its is astounding to me that people think this is how shit works. Thank you so.much for considering folks like me and for actually caring about your children's well being!!!"

stevenuniverse,fdq4yzo,t1_fdq4rid,1578655071.0,"Wow, that's unnecessarily hostile. 
And your point makes little sense when Rose and Pink are the exact same person and her actions are not different based on a name. She still made horrific mistakes that caused people genuine trauma. Saying it's about the people ""actually in Rose's life"" discredits the fact that as Pink she did things that she should be held accountable for and getting upset with people for having that belief is why this fandom is so toxic....."

One of my cats is not a smart child and he lurks. Absolutely harmless but it annoys my female to the point of constant growling when he is anywhere near her. My oldest puts the other male in his place but gets along phenomenally with my female. There has never been an actual fight though. All three are people friendly (though my female *hates* groups of people. D&D night is her least favorite night of the week)
hissing is defensive though, I think...? If there is a lot of hissing, is there any actual fighting is the question."

stevenuniverse,fc6p4y9,t1_fc6hnqf,1577485949.0,"Depends on the person unfortunately. The thumb ones are faded to hell, but that is a color sticking issue with my skin. If you *are* getting a hand tattoo, I suggest black or a natural skin tone so it either remains somewhat clean (like my index finger tattoo), or so if it *does* fade, it looks like a baller birthmark (like my celtic knot in the web between my thumb and index finger). The latter is the newest and seems to be holding with the color I chose. 
Another iffy spot: Inner wrist. So much bending happens that the ink had faded *just* where the skin folds.
