Sadly, it is often not shared equally and you will have one twin get more nutrients in the womb than the other. You can also see this in birth weight differences at birth. Some of these 'less fed' twins cause an increase chance of certain diseases they have risk of developing. Others have already done a great job of explaining disease risk vs genetic variation- but this shared placenta could be and environmental difference between you two."
