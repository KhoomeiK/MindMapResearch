I've been with 2 girls in the past and one was easy to tell, the second was hard to tell."
SuicideWatch,ffefvsk,t1_ffe4ztr,1579846436.0,"It definitely wasn't your fault if even the doctors say it. You're not worthless, but I understand that feeling. Sometimes these things just happen, and they can happen to good people. As advanced as medicine is, childbirth and pregnancy is still dangerous to mother and child. You did all that you could have with what you had."
SuicideWatch,ffdc06o,t3_esy5hp,1579817648.0,"That's a very understandable reason to want to die. Was she your first/only baby? Do you have other children who need you? You might want to have another baby when you're ready again, but it's not going to the replace the one you lost. I'm so sorry this happened to you and your family, but I promise that the feeling you have now will be passed on to your loved ones if you also go. I don't know if your parents are alive, but your friends would also feel the same grief of losing you"
EARONS,ff732vf,t1_ff4bzi5,1579640142.0,Ed O'Niel would be a good one! Haven't seen him in anything in a while.
sex,ff4blz3,t1_ff0f9vh,1579559804.0,"This was a couple years ago. 2017. I miss him so much, sometimes things will come up and remind me of him, I think it's him saying hi. We were friends for 4 years before we hooked up, so I actually went to his memorial. It gave me some closure, but damn it was tough."
sex,ff0bnmi,t3_eqs5nw,1579467310.0,"Similar happened to me. You're not alone. It's not your fault. 

My FWB died a month and a half into our hooking up. He went to a music festival and we got in a fight on a Weds because he said ""come suck my dick when I get back"" and I got offended that he would just say it like that because I'm a person with feelings and I actually was trying to tell him I love him. We made plans to hang out that Sunday but he died in an accident on Thurs night."
SuicideWatch,fdwsixg,t3_en3mit,1578761964.0,Go to a church or some sort of social gathering like an anime expo. People there are usually huggers.

EARONS,fdr5khf,t1_fdnt3wa,1578679749.0,"Jeff seems so grandfatherly but he was a villain in something I don't remember, but I think I remember him doing a good job of it. Which would work for the duplicitous nature of a serial killer with a home life"
EARONS,fdllj8q,t1_fdkj55t,1578526745.0,I haven't seen that yet! But yes agreed
EARONS,fdllieq,t1_fdkd876,1578526731.0,"Ben McKenzie is excellent on Gotham, I like seeing him as a police officer. Paul holes would be a great role"
EARONS,fdllf5x,t1_fdjmizi,1578526671.0,Those are good choices too. Woody i could see doing a good job
EARONS,fdjej85,t3_elp4ym,1578467481.0,"I don't think his shrink knew. As twisted as someone might be, if they're seeing a shrink, I doubt they would confess wanting to hurt someone. I go to a shrink and they give me a questionnaire all the time and it's just too easy to lie on it."

PostHardcore,fct25mw,t1_fcsy84y,1577930921.0,"It's all hectic druggie drama with Jonny. Saying the people he dates are crazy is victim blaming though. Dating someone as nuts as Jonny can drive anyone crazy. 

I wasn't aware of the animal porn, but yeah it's saying he had the plans to abuse that 1 year old, but it never went through (I hope I'm reading that correctly). He's fucked up for sure, but Jonny is on the same level if the above rumors are true. He apparently has no remorse for anything he has done. Watching Taylor's video, she said he raped her and said ""this is rape"" so that's monstrous in itself."
PostHardcore,fct1r4q,t1_fct0nyw,1577930625.0,"They are poppy, definitely, but definitely part of that scene, they toured with less poppy bands for lots of years.

I wasn't aware of the drama behind their break up. He did her dirty? She was way out of his league! Dumbass."

SuicideWatch,fcswyg3,t3_eieayu,1577927210.0,Yeah. I just feel empty inside. Every day I fight with myself to go to work to make money to keep myself going.

PostHardcore,fcsvfgx,t1_fcstks2,1577926107.0,"Not 100% familar, but he had plans to abuse some children and had some lady abuse her kid on camera for him on skype and possessed lots of CP on his computer with the PW being ""if***kids"" I don't know if he actually went through with anything, but JC apparently has a story about holding down an ex and injecting her with heroin and raping several women. So idk."
PostHardcore,fcstof5,t1_fcssvbs,1577924831.0,"They should change their name for real. I don't think I've actually even listened to Slaves other than when it was on a DGD and similar station on Spotify, because of the name. Feels wrong. But DGD, I wanna give em all the money because Will is epic. Love them with Tilian"
PostHardcore,fcst57x,t1_fcshejc,1577924452.0,"The way he's going, he'll get his baby mama hooked on H, she will either miscarry or have a stillborn due to drugs, he'll get all emo about it and relapse further into drugs. 

Or they have the baby and (I hope to God this doesn't happen, but the most likely scenario with addicts for parents) the baby will be born addicted too, and they might neglect it and it dies like that one baby on the news they found dead with a full diaper because the parents were meth addicts...

Honestly, the possibility of these scenarios makes him on par or worse than lost prophets dude."
PostHardcore,fcssr0f,t1_fcqmb1w,1577924170.0,You forgot about Paramore! But yeah very rare to have a girl in a band. That scene is mainly white boys.
PostHardcore,fcssi2g,t1_fcq03pp,1577923993.0,Luckily the band has redone albums as instrumental or with other singers so we can at least still listen to them without giving him money? Unless he gets paid for having written the songs :/ but that is always the sad part is there are other dudes you're hurting by not listening to them anymore.
Onision,fcat9ru,t1_fc9mo2m,1577576171.0,Not sure why you're getting downvoted. I agree.

Huel,fblxcmp,t1_fbe291r,1576972752.0,"Do you use huel as your main/only food? Or do you use it as a protein shake for workouts?

I mention this because it's not as nutritious as Huel, but there's a brand called Orgain that makes vegan protein powder, but it's also got probiotics and it tastes decent. I'd get the chocolate one though, vanilla has a weird aftertaste. Farts aren't as bad as on huel at least"
