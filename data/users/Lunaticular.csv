TheMandalorianTV,feacjx9,t1_fe8zv8u,1578947012.0,Yeah but death watch also took their helmets off. Perhaps it changed after Maul and the Empire and the Great Purge and then the fall of the Empire. Many things happened I suppose so it could make sense

MensRights,fe6nbkp,t1_fdz1d3z,1578896863.0,I think feminists try and get rights for people. Whether it’s rights for men and women or just women I’m not sure - depends on the feminists. Then there are also those feminists who try to take away from men’s rights. Either way I think we can all guess negative neutral and positive out of those three feminist types

MensRights,fdmcbjm,t1_fdlqsg0,1578545396.0,That’s not what feminism stands for for many people. Feminism is like anything - you give the definition. Many people give something a definition based on their own personal experiences on that topic

MensRights,fcoy881,t1_fcox490,1577844883.0,"Yes with this I agree with you completely. The face of feminism is vastly rotten and toxic in a lot of areas but then again there tons of MRA who are just as bad. It’s not the leaders as such whoa re toxic, but the vocal ones. The minority is always the most vocal. The minority of feminists who wish death on men are few and thus they are more vocal. Then if these vocal feminists gain followers that’s when they become leaders. But I’d say there’s a lot more good leaders than bad in feminism. It’s just where you look. You’re an mra and thus you’re exposed to the worst that feminism has. But when you take a step back and look at it without thought of what you have witnessed, a neutral perspective, you’ll see that it’s a lot like men’s rights activism. In fact the exact same except with vastly more power because they have many more followers. And of course they fight for women’s issues not men’s. I look at men’s rights activism and feminism at two sides that need be united if we are to stand together. For that we must get rid of the extremists and toxics"
MensRights,fcowicw,t1_fcovxwx,1577843495.0,"Not all feminists are like this. The vast majority aren’t. They are merely ignorant to men’s problems as are many men to women’s issues. The few that are like this, like the one that unfortunately banned me, are bitter people who are used to the victim mentality and greedy of everyone’s attention. Some humans believe that the only way their problems can be fixed is by it being the only problem people focus on and so they push other problems down into oblivion and pretend they don’t exist and persuade others to the same"

Feminism,fconlvd,t1_fcomu0r,1577836739.0,"Look I understand you feel excluded and unimportant. You think the world caters only to males but trust me it doesn't if you were born a male you may very well be saying the world is against men. In truth, the world isn't against nor for anyone. Society has pushed everyone in boxes and has created inequality in everyone and everything. The enemy is not men as much as it is not women. We cannot win this battle against inequality without us all standing together. Whether you want to believe it or not, everyone has problems. 

I assure you that you don't have to fight inequality with inequality. You cannot create equality through spreading more inequality. You can only achieve true equality by having everyone stand together and say ""no more"". I am here if you or anyone in this thread needs someone to talk to."
