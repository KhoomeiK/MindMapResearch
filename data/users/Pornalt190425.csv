I'm not well versed enough in this subject to say how effective $x would be spent one way or another.

WTF,feo7kqw,t1_feo3toc,1579296239.0,"Are you suggesting a 737 would cruise at 400 knots (or higher) below 10,000 feet? Because that seems highly unlikely and extremely inefficient if their high altitude cruise is around 490 knots. Not to mention they already came in for approach and went around once.

Furthermore, the force of the wind will be highly dependent on exposed surface area (hence why I measured the surface area of just my arm). An entire person (and a light one at that) will have much more force exerted on them than just a small portion of them

EDIT: I went and actually found a boeing 737 flight manual on takeoff the speed is kept at V2 + 15 (about 160 knots) until 3000 feet AGL and then you can move to normal ascent pattern flying at 250 knots for an 1800 ft/min altitude gain until 10000 ft ASL. So no they would not fly at 400 knots below 10000ft ASL

Something to keep in mind is air at sea level is significantly more dense than air at 8500 feet (air at 8500 feet is ~75% as dense) so it exerts less force at the same velocity.  Also surface area plays a huge role too. The thing making the force is pressure from the moving area (force/unit area) so something with much more frontal surface area (like an entire person) will be effected much more strongly by the same wind conditions"

> So the approach speed of a 737 is something like 135 knots on average (varies based on model,  weight etc) but this plane was probably still a bit high to be flying at approach velocity. Cruising speed is around 490 knots but that's at a much higher altitude with much less drag. So for a back of the envelope estimate of the force on someones arm out the window lets call it 200 knots. This, conviently, is almost 100m/s so we'll use that for calculations to make life easier. The pressure exerted by a moving fluid (dynamic pressure, q) is actually pretty easy to calculate. It's just q = 1/2(density)(v^2 ).  8500 feet is like 2600 meters and the standard density there is about .947 kg/m^3 .

> Putting all that information together we get a dynamic pressure of 4713.5 pascals or 4.71 kpa. So that's 4713 newtons force on a square meter or ~ 1060 lbs on a square yard.

WTF,fenoe3n,t1_fenngsu,1579288520.0,Yeah since its squared it should be the root of the difference of the squares over the initial (in standard units not knots). So that's 63% of the force if my math is right or 28.3 lbs
WTF,fenmtcn,t1_fenm6tv,1579288020.0,Thanks!

Personally I'd rather they had Sam's actor go on a diet in real life so that the logic of the world stays consistent. Changing their body types and size isnt that outlandish for an actor to fit a role.  Especially if you have ample time to do so. You have a character who does a whole lot of training and trekking staying pretty overweight. On top of that there's constant warfare and the world is transitioning from a time of plenty to a time of scarcity (the summer-> winter transition) so food shortages/famine should be rampant.  GoT was plagued by a lot of other issues so this one is pretty minor I'll admit."

mechanical_gifs,feaw1x4,t1_feanqvv,1578952762.0,"Probably about as much as a similar area size on another spoiler pointed in an optimal direction I'd wager.  

The equation for lift (lift pointing down is your downforce) is L=1/2(coefficient of lift)(density)(wetted surface area)V^2.  

So assuming that Cl isn't too drastically different between this and a normal spoiler the only other term that could change is your surface area in any given driving conditions compared to a normal spoiler.  The summation of those smaller areas into the same amount of m^2 as a normal spoiler won't effect its aerodynamic output since lift depends only linearly on surface area. There is a question of dirty air from the first row interacting with the 2nd row making it less efficient (and so on) but that comes down to a matter of spacing and more complex aerodynamics 

The big benefit I can see is that while it might be able to produce the same amount of force is its the ability to flexibly direct that force.  For example when turning you wouldn't want the force directed straight down but in a line such that it presses more on the outside wheels than the inside so you can turn a tighter radius."

TumblrInAction,fcyq38q,t1_fcykvcb,1578084774.0,"Yes, but not for the country of America but the idea of America. You had a rag tag group of political revolutionaries take on and defeat one of the largest empires in the world. The preamble of the American Declaration of Independence starts off with that all men created equal with rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The US constitution enshrines rights and freedoms in it in the bill of rights.  These ideals can be very appealing to opressed peoples fighting tyranny and the flag of the nation of America encompasses all of the ideals of America even though the nation may not follow through on them"
TumblrInAction,fcyo99r,t1_fcymyio,1578083770.0,"It's not America the country that's the beacon of hope. Its the idealized idea of America that can get latched onto in revolutionary or protest movements. That is to say the ideas that nominally founded America: government of the people, for the people, by the people; life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; the numerous rights and freedoms enshrined in the US constitution. These are understandably entincing ideals for oppressed peoples and the US flag nominally represents"

fakehistoryporn,fcycbse,t1_fcy21my,1578077955.0,And Austria going into Serbia to was supposed to be just a minor war/policing action that very quickly spun out of control. The situation today is much more similar to that of pre-WWI than pre-WWII

space,fcw7ce7,t1_fcvnae5,1578018817.0,This is the only right response. The moons magnetic field had a higher absolute value on its surface than earth's. If I had to wager earth's magnetic field had much more energy stored in it just based on the size of the field
space,fcw6qkb,t1_fcv8n7v,1578018426.0,Not really in the context of holding an atmosphere. One of the important parameters for that is the average molecular weight of the atmosphere. Its easier for lighter molecules to be propelled to escape velocity by being bombarded by solar wind particles.  Both atmospheres are fairly similar in that regard with earth coming in at 28.9 and titan's come in at 28.6

MurderedByWords,fcaes94,t1_fc8jk2r,1577567993.0,It's not very common at all. But there are definitely documented cases where women have a surprise pregnancy they only find out about when they go into labor
clevercomebacks,fcaeetb,t1_fca5gqc,1577567820.0,"There's the pollution (CO2, SO2, plastics etc) that individuals will make and then there's the pollution that industrial processes, international shipping, etc makes.  The pollution that individuals make is such a small amount in comparison it might as well be a rounding error on the total annual pollution outputs from all sources.  Thus if you can make a small effort in the largest sectors that are the most polluting you can and will have a much larger total effect than making a massive effort in such a small sector"
clevercomebacks,fc7h56b,t1_fc7epe5,1577507288.0,No it really won't. Individuals are a rounding error on the amount of pollution humanity creates. Every little bit might matter but shaving 50% off .01% is much less than shaving 10% off 2%

MurderedByWords,fc7ette,t1_fc79qtg,1577505303.0,There is also the possibility of finding out you're pregnant after the point of no return as well.  It is very possible to have minor bleeding and no morning sickness in the early stages of a pregnancy and subsequently not knowing you're pregnant until it is too late to abort. It's not super common but it can happen
