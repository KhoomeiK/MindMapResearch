AskReddit,ff5cp0w,t1_ff5c5gn,1579587462.0,"Sorry I just realised I didn't clarify. I had authorisation to do things, I was acting manager when nobody else was available. 

The authorisation I was referring to was a systematic one which required a log in from a manager to price-change things. I always had it because I needed it for genuine cases, but he trusted me that when a customer was being a dick about something to call him over and he'd make sure they left knowing they were being a dick."
AskReddit,ff4cqo4,t1_ff45qys,1579560540.0,"I had a really good manager who always found the middle ground of ""no Thrones is correct, it's against store policy to do this and she cannot authorise this. However, as the manager, I can do xyz for you instead"". He'd offer them a bit more discount than standard but not whatever they were demanding. He just always worded it in a way where they knew full well they were assholes for pestering me about it"

facepalm,fexbiw7,t1_feww8hi,1579428162.0,"For example: 

I worked in optics for 7 years, know my way round a pair of glasses blindfolded with one hand. A lot of casual repairs we have to do involves new screws, and often a product called Loctite. In case you don't know, Loctite acts like a glue in the hinge, aiming to stop the screw from falling out again.

I had a gents pair of glasses in my hand, and a small bottle of Loctite in the other as he asks me if I knew what Loctite is and without any hesitation proceeded to mansplain to me the benefits of using Loctite. As if I'm just a monkey going through the motions without understanding what I'm doing. 

This was also after he tried telling me (mistakenly) what the problem was and why his lens wasn't sitting in his glasses, and I had a gentle conversation with him before I started the repair where I told him what his actual issue was, and explained (in enough detail to mention the Loctite AND its functions) what I would do to fix it."

AmItheAsshole,fduo8a1,t1_fdtaue7,1578736162.0,"There are two videos online, one filmed in Wales (YouTube PSA texting while driving UK) It's just over 4 minutes long and INCREDIBLY hard hitting, shows exactly what a simple text while driving can cause

And a slightly softer awareness campaign filmed in a cinema in Hong Kong (MCL cinema Hong Kong Mobile phone car crash) which is also super enlightening.

 I watched both videos LONG before I passed my driving test but I've never texted while driving because of them.

They're worth showing to your daughter. I think she may understand a little better"

AskWomen,fdgsrwk,t3_el9ipx,1578407389.0,"Not married but my ""best friend"" goes radio silent every time he gets a girlfriend. Was gunna take him out shopping for his birthday this year and he was offline for like 16 hours before we were due to meet, got nothing until the day after he stood me up where I found out his phone had run out of battery because he stayed with a girl he was seeing and instead of using another means to get hold of me to cancel/arrange something else, he just decided to hang out with her all day.

I called him out on it when he asked me for help after they had an argument and he went down the whole ""woe is me"" path. I told him I'd be around when he wanted to actually put some effort into our friendship again. 

When they split up he got super talkative again, wanted to meet up etc. Then got another girlfriend and I've seen him once since. I've put no effort into our friendship since April and he still doesn't beleive what I said to him when I called him out. Frustrating thing is other than this one super shitty trait, he's a really good friend"

More calls every day, second mattress has finally been collected and has tracking information. Due for delivery on January 04th now because its Christmas. I can't blame the courier company at all because none of this is their fault but goddamn I'm pissed off at Wayfair for all of this. They've so far refunded me 30% and I'll be ringing them again today as I was promised collection on Monday of this week and delivery on Tuesday. I've taken 4 days off work unpaid to wait for this because they've promised me it'd be delivered then"
