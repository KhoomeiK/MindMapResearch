amiibo,ffvypj0,t1_ffvy6d0,1580277477.0,"Okay, I know I have heard of the rail slot things before but wooow Ive never seen it with an after picture like yours. That does look pretty sturdy and it turned out amazing! Thank you for that side shot as well. Unfortunately, I am horrible with tools and probably couldnt find a stud to save my life but #goals man. I appreciate your late reply and I will be sure to save this info for the far far future. Your setup looks sooo good! Thank you!!!"

DunderMifflin,ffrzraw,t3_euuzdf,1580169650.0,I am amazed by the level of complex minifig hair pieces you have but I strongly feel Creed and Stanley could benefit from the older plan hair caps from the lego minifigs of yesteryear.

One day all that will be covered in a cloudy grey. It will get chilly. It will rain constantly. You will feel amazing. Just power through those sunny days because eventually a storm will come... and sooth your soul."""
amiibo,ffk1z6z,t3_eu0lh9,1580013344.0,Nevermind. There is no order.
NintendoSwitch,ffk1dan,t1_ffhxw8d,1580012822.0,Same here. Every shot had the same animation. Also no one scored unless it was some powered  up special shot. It needs more variety.
NintendoSwitch,ffk1b3u,t1_ffi8ce3,1580012769.0,This looked super odd the whole length of the video. I never got used to it.
community,ffil12j,t3_eth5dy,1579976409.0,This show is amazing! Season 3 has several of my favs!

food,ffh9hx4,t1_ffh8rok,1579927012.0,This is the only Poutine I have had but the fries never got soggy. They looked pretty cooked though as almost if they overcooked them to combat the sogginess. Either way it was crunchy goodness!

food,ffgs94v,t1_ffgonwf,1579913747.0,"From what I gather...Poutine is a Canadian dish. I am no expert on it but living in the south side of the United States I thought I would never have a chance to try it. Its french fries, gravy, and cheese curds on the classic side. On the Texan side they added things like brisket, bbq, green onions, and corn. It was very delicious!"

gaming,ffe52b3,t1_ffdpadw,1579836900.0,I have to say I am pretty impressed you picked one Pokemon so early so many years ago and just stuck with collecting only that one Pokemon. Its a beautiful collection.
houston,ffbd0tm,t3_esgx2w,1579760191.0,Cars are the way to go in Houston. Its crazy...itd be pretty hard to have a fulfilling day in Houston without riding in a car. Yet when I went to Tokyo for 10 days I never rode in a car/taxi/uber once. Trains all the way. They know how to set up a system for cities. Houston is lacking this severely. Buses are slow and the metrorail does the best it can but we need a better system.
houston,ffbcnot,t1_ffaafnn,1579759788.0,"Shhh. Dont tell too many people. Ive used this trip/route for many astros games, ballets, and adventures to the underground tunnels. Dont pay a dime for parking."

nintendo,ff50ds5,t1_ff4zu1l,1579576864.0,Oh man yes. I have watched probably 20+ Byleth reactions and 90% were mad. It is amusing.
amiibo,ff4ynod,t1_ff4y448,1579575618.0,"I know there are older posts here with more details, but if I recall one person said they just got it online with wifi and the update happened automatically. Who knows if its really that easy but once you get your key you can find out!"
amiibo,ff4xrjl,t1_ff4xk3a,1579574995.0,The update adds the Switch and BotW amiibo to the list of systems and games. I have no idea how to mount mine to anything either so if you find a solution let me know! Haha

nintendo,ff4f3fq,t3_ergder,1579562095.0,I am so interested in this because its made from the Fantasy Life creators....but this trailer did not explain why this is called snack world at all. I expected a lot more food related activities...
nintendo,ff4esvk,t3_erkmi6,1579561899.0,Cadence of Hyrule was enough for me.
nintendo,ff4ekki,t1_ff4asit,1579561746.0,His reaction to Byleth was just 2 minutes of laughing. So he can still be hit or miss.
amiibo,ff47yxv,t3_eririi,1579557515.0,Love the coloring!

funny,ff28knt,t3_eqxi2m,1579496960.0,I laughed.
houston,ff1rpbm,t3_er5fw4,1579484691.0,This is great. Thanks.

NintendoSwitch,ff1a813,t1_feyg6lw,1579476786.0,Easy. The first world my be a breeze but man I got several game overs in the last few worlds and bosses and I played the SNES games.
amiibo,fezh3hr,t1_feza6m0,1579457270.0,Right? At least show off the dlc amiibo.
AskReddit,feyst9a,t1_fexjm2v,1579450175.0,Such a great connection.
amiibo,feyjwto,t3_equuwn,1579446504.0,Yeah when amiibo popped up in the direct...I expected more.
news,few99t3,t3_eq7evf,1579407056.0,Seeing that video is all the proof you need. Wow.
AskReddit,few58fb,t1_feryje9,1579405576.0,This is interesting. It could be why just following certain actors from movie to movie can be very uneven and results in finding little success. As a casual movie fan I rarely if ever pay attention to directors and writers....but I am sure if I did my results would be much more successful.
amiibo,feuk8nt,t1_feuditx,1579387277.0,Thanks for the response. You put a lot of effort into that.

personalfinance,fes8yf1,t3_eqfly3,1579362681.0,Happened to me once. I deposited $3000 in the atm and immediately after the ATM shut down. Like literally turned off. The money wasnt in my account. What a disaster. I eventually got it back after many days of arguing with the bank and several late bills...but I learned my lesson. Never deposit more than a few hundred into an ATM. Those machines are stupid.
amiibo,ferv8e0,t1_feq5qk1,1579358653.0,Amiibo cant go on forever can it? I mean I love em soo much but even you have to admit...outside of Smash? Amiibo have been dying down. Many huge games on the switch didnt get new amiibo last year. Its just sad. We only had 5 non-smash amiibo in 2019. None in the future... Its a scary time to be an amiibo fan.
betterCallSaul,ferucqp,t1_ferpc2s,1579358446.0,Ohhhhh. That makes sense. I like this idea.

amiibo,fenqsru,t1_fenodz9,1579289473.0,Do we really want that? Lol we are almost at 200 amiibo...so redoing many of them would not be ideal for me and others who have already spent so much money. New poses however!? Haha id be a sucker for that. Lol

todayilearned,fener9y,t1_femul9r,1579283117.0,You are awesome and must be well-traveled. Japan was the first overseas country for me to visit so I know without a smartphone I would have been stressing more. Great to know Japan is just that well organized and planned out though!

todayilearned,feneles,t1_femz8at,1579283018.0,That is true. Ours lasted 6-8 hours with constant use. So we brought power bricks...which was only more things to carry! Haha
todayilearned,femtp2z,t1_femsve8,1579269311.0,You arent lying about the walking. Did you go to both Tokyo Disney parks? The trains to even get over there are no joke (as i remember one station being literally 5 stories underground) but the walking at the parks was brutal. Good thing the flavored popcorn stands were there!

todayilearned,femtaw4,t1_fem9mt5,1579268999.0,"Using a paper map would truly make me feel like an adventurer. Haha. Good on you for taking the challenge. The plus to smartphones though are the live, updated arrival times. If I needed to make several transfers it was reassuring to know those times would not change because the trains are famously always on time."
todayilearned,femt15j,t1_femiw4b,1579268780.0,"Thats why you dont use Apple... haha I joke. I actually made one or two errors while riding the trains but it always ended up being my fault not google""s. It was always exact to the minute. I was blown away."

todayilearned,fem31fj,t3_epsvd0,1579238099.0,The train station way of life over there is super interesting.  10-15 years ago...taking a trip to tokyo solo would be waaaaay harder than it is now.
