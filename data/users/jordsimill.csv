ChoosingBeggars,fczsnge,t1_fczcvfn,1578107937.0,So the thieves never got out of the car. Two men + 1 girl I believe. Girl is in passenger seat and asks to see the phone. Seller hands her the phone to look at and she says “I want it.” Then the driver pulls away and leaves without ever paying. A lot of bad judgment on seller’s part.

ChoosingBeggars,fcyljal,t1_fcyl4zd,1578082232.0,Seller said the cops have been notified and given a description of the two individuals and contacted the phone company as well. Unfortunately she had signed out of iCloud already so the phone can’t be tracked. No other info at the moment. The profile messaging her has an unidentifiable photo and fake name as well.

ChoosingBeggars,fcyk3h7,t1_fcyjx3s,1578081433.0,The guy in gray stole the phone from the woman in blue when they met up for the sale. Now he’s messaging her asking for the password saying he’ll give her money for it once she gives him the pin to unlock the phone.

Regardless, I’ll be participating in every election for the rest of my days."
