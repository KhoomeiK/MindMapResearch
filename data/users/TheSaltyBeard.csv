fatlogic,fejgtb9,t3_ep61tp,1579173573.0,"We have the instinctual desire to consume as much food as possible when presented with it. This is evolutionary not because the body favors being fat or fit or anything but because food used to be much more scarce than it is today.

Evolution is, however, slow as fuck and so in an age surrounded by food nearly constantly and with easy access as well as cheap, low quality junk food most people need to actively work against this ancient instinct. Some people have an easier time than others and this is sometimes due to genetics but more often than not due to environment during childhood. The older a bad habit is the harder it is to correct. And so we eat like gluttons."

science,fejfybe,t1_fejf0za,1579172365.0,"Note: you're anecdotal experience does not reflect everywhere. In Canada where I live winters have become more and more moderate while summers have become more and more extreme over the past ten years.

Having a ""white"" snowy Christmas used to be the expectation but in the past 5 years I've begun to lean towards expecting the opposite. Brown and mushy is becoming the trend.

The ""frozen North"" Americans are familiar with is fading."

I've also noticed over the past several years no matter where I live that the number of ""white Christmas"" we've had are dwindling rapidly."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fed2zlh,t3_eofeyb,1578996203.0,"This should (and legally speaking probably pretty much is) be treated the same way two underage people having consensual sexual activity between each other is treated. That is, shit ain't going to court in a million years.

The reason children or under aged people can't legally consent to sex with someone of age or significantly older than them is pretty much the same reason that a drunk person can't with a sober person.

It's a difference in power and control over one's own actions. Also experience but that's specific to the underage situation. 

Meaning if you are both sloshed nobody got raped. Unless it was like... Actual rape by force for example. Obviously. 

You might have regrets but you consented to someone who was also similar levels of intoxicated to you. Male or female."

fatlogic,fed0fte,t1_fdpvtwx,1578992460.0,"Yes, generally. But if through means in or out of your control where your metabolism has gone ass up losing fat ends up being quite difficult for many.

Reducing the calories you eat every day will lower your metabolism. This means not only will you feel worse, more lethargic, etc. But you'll also burn less calories as your body has evolved to recognise caloric reduction as a sign of dwindling access to food. It wants to hold onto all the energy it can for as long as possible. 

However doing fasting more often seems to have none of and sometimes the opposite effect. As long as you do short term fasts, but generally consume the same amount of calories when you do eat (or an amount that's healthy and sustainable) your body doesn't have time to go into that dieting starvation mode.

Also, if you eat like shit for a long time you can fuck up your metabolism as well. Hormones that regulate what gets stored or used go out of wack and again slips people into this starvation mode to conserve energy stores.

Fix your diet, as well as reduce calories to a reasonable amount or do some kind of fasting will make the process a lot smoother generally speaking.

In general, it's rare that it's a thing totally out of one's control. But dietary choices outside of strictly calories in/out play a big part as well.

People need to stop assuming that the ""out"" part of that equation doesn't change other than with excersize levels. The body wants to stay in homeostasis as much as it can and even if your fat is slowly killing you it tries to keep from losing mass as its generally worse historically than gaining it."
AskReddit,fecu1od,t1_fecbkzj,1578984609.0,"If women thought for a moment they'd quickly realize that people with this sort of handicap are more likely to try much harder to get their partner off to compensate.

Too bad they don't seem to do that. Guess chick's don't like their men going down on them as much as I thought."

fatlogic,fdmgl5j,t3_eluhvm,1578549193.0,"There are a lot of other factors than calories in and out. Hormones dictate everything about where that fuel you consumed is even stored or how its used.

Genetics play a big role in that. Though one of the key ways to fuck up your metabolism is to eat a shitty diet. 

You can still find it hard to lose fat despite being at a caloric deficit of the calories you do eat aren't condusive to a healthy metabolism"
