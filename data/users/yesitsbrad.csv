You live in a land if wealth and comfort.  You are the first generation in history to beg for your rights and posessions to be taken away.  You will never hear actual poor children spout this kind of drivel because they are happier than you.  Why?  Because they work hard every day to improve their lives and their family's life.  This gives them a pride that you cannot imagine yet.

You may not be aware but, glaciers melted, seas dried up and became deserts, mountains were thrust up and also crumbled, long before homo sapiens ever walked upright.  Your arrogance let's you believe that humans cause these things.  I'm sad for you."

JordanPeterson,ff9atzv,t1_ff95hng,1579708757.0,"If you'll read my comment again, you'll see it wasn't defending anyone, simply stating that OP spends more time worrying about the rich than trying to better him!herself.  I understand that your hatred runs deep but at least try to perceive outside your self inflicted filter."

JordanPeterson,ff7xrfn,t3_es3okb,1579660876.0,Pretty sure rich people aren't blaming poor people for much.  You should know that they are on your mind far more than you are on theirs.
