WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffdvpvc,t1_ffdvd6i,1579830106.0,"I think it was a Jolly Ball after looking it up. A very hard plastic ball with holes in it, that are just small enough for a smaller rubber ball to stay trapped inside. He spent hours trying to get the little ball out, and it also survived a standard poodle and 2 labs."

A Karen went online and complained that she had put in an order and wasn't able to pick up after driving to the shop. The owner replied, informing her that we had checked the orders before closing, and there were no unfilled orders that day."

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdhd7mx,t1_fdgghtl,1578420275.0,"2 of them are around a year old. They're getting pretty good about not jumping when people come through the front door, but it's much harder for them to control themselves on furniture. I think it's similar to when you sit on the floor and a dog is all over you, they get excited when you're on their level. The difference is that I can choose to sit on the floor and enter that mode of play, but when they do that on the couch it takes control away from the humans. I realize that you can teach a dog to sit nicely on a couch, but in my experience most people don't. An easier boundary is just to stay off the furniture. Or, only when invited up, like how I trained my last dog."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdge9wb,t1_fdg6vh3,1578392686.0,"I don't think it's always a good idea. All of my friends who have dogs let them on the furniture, and they will run and jump all over people who are sitting on the couch when they get excited. It's hard to relax, let alone hold a drink."

vegetarian,fchri5f,t1_fcgqtby,1577653330.0,"There are a lot of different ways of looking at it. Personally, one of the reasons I went vegetarian is because I don't like the way animals are handled in the meat and dairy industries. So I never eat store bought meat, but sometimes have the fowl my dad and brother hunt. I use alternative milk, and cage free eggs.

The only things I have a hard time finding an ethical alternative to that would be close to the real thing are cheese and butter, but I don't have those every day anyway. For me, caring about animals is handling them in a humane way and not wasting what we take. I respect people who go vegan, but I think a little compromise on cheese and butter can be ok too."
