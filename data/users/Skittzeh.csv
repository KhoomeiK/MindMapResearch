HumansBeingBros,fee17be,t1_fee0l0a,1579024257.0,"How do you tell?

I’m 19 and have had three separate long year relationships with very loving people.

I’ve had girlfriends come over and make my bed for me when I was at the firehouse for a long time or prepare me food for the week ahead. That doesn’t mean I’m a “man-child” it means I had a loving partner at the time. 

Relationships aren’t transactional at all - there is equal love in there in other shapes and forms.

This binary thinking of what makes you masculine has never been true. Men in the 50’s followed tropes as abusive alcoholics and they were seen as masculine at the time.

Is the woman a “woman-child” if the man fixes her a lunch for the day? She can do it herself can’t she? No. It’s an act of love.

I completely understand this type of ordeal is abnormal to people that have never experienced it but that’s what a loving relationship is.

If you’re just fucking your S/O and going to dinners every now and then that isn’t a loving relationship it’s an agreement. There are tons of minute details in a loving relationship.

Sure. Reddit is full of man children in the sense that they seem to have absolutely no skills whatsoever besides working in the office.

Although this guy in question simply said his wife helps him tie his tie. It’s a completely neutral comment so there’s no need to hate on him my friend.

wallstreetbets,fdjf5n6,t1_fdj4gum,1578468194.0,"Hey, my friend!

The truth of the matter is people are going to do what feeds their family first.

If someone’s in a bad situation they aren’t going to go “oh man! I can’t work for Raytheon!” if their family is struggling to make ends meet.

Government jobs aren’t too high paying but they provide money into a TSP (basically a Roth) and match it by I think 8%, they provide a pension, health care, and loads of other benefits.

Contract work such as Lockheed, Raytheon, and others provide a good sized income for families.

I’ve volunteered in animal communities, gone through Firefighter, gotten my EMT-B, and I love volunteering in my community and giving back but if I got a $120,000 offer (which isn’t rare for these companies) I’d absolutely take it to feed my family.

Also a lot of the preconceived notion that these companies don’t work on some really great non-militarized products is completely false.

Although Lockheed has gotten some rightfully deserved heat recently due to the Max planes and it should cause a policy change it would be incorrect to generalize all workers of a gigantic company (Lockheed employs 100k) on the actions of a few immoral chiefs.

On the flip side Lockheed does phenomenal work on commercial satellites and although Raytheon is primarily a defense contractor they create tons of products that seize a threat without loss of life.

There’s no reason to call a software engineer immoral for working in these companies. It simply doesn’t make sense.

In that regard every Apple employee supports sweatshops, every Chick-Fil-A cashier dislikes the gays, and every Samsung employee spies on our phones.

If you spam swipe you have a lower chance of being matched with people as tinder wants their platform to be ‘genuine’ and to make money off people that are spamming as they’re more likely to buy Tinder Gold.

I would hire a photographer for profiles for stuff like LinkedIn or social media other than tinder but that works too and they have good crossover.

I would get three solid pictures of you doing what you do as hobbies no matter what it is and it’ll go on from there - most pictures on Tinder are from vacations, hobbies, with dogs, family, whatever.

Keep your first picture a picture of only you.

It’s really a photos game. They did a study awhile back where they put a very attractive picture of a guy and said some horrible remarks in the bio and they still averaged 100+ matches very quickly.

I’d also like to pitch that dating apps aren’t going to land you a solid relationship if that’s what you’re looking for and I’d try putting yourself out there more wherever you live.

When I was 14 years the only hobby I had was playing world of warcraft.

I am 19 now and I still play world of warcraft now pretty frequently but I grew into so many accomplishments and hobbies I thought I would never be capable of.

Although a lot of things seem vastly important at 14 do not worry too hard.

Focus on school, try to ease your way into a sport or exercise regiment if you can. If you don’t do these things no worries! Many start later or some never start at all but exercise is a vital part to a healthy life.

Don’t fall into a bad sleep schedule. It’s easy to do while you’re young and it will have severe ramifications later.

Anyways man - I remember beating myself up everyday when I was 13/14.

I had no friends, I was insecure, and I had no passions.

My stream is about creating a community based stream and not a streamer based stream.

My Life TLDR: **18**, Former Intelligence Community Member, Motorcyclist (Triumph Street Triple),  Philosophy Major, Steelers Fan

Growing up I was very fortunate to have many internet friends that made real life difficulties easy - I am going to bring that possibility to everybody that tunes in. I'm going to build the stream around the community.

Goals: 

* **Raise money for animal daycares and animal charities.**
* **Create an intrinsic valued community that has its own personal jokes and respectful base.**
* **Become partnered with Mixer by the end of 2020 to help accomplish these goals.**

I stream on M/W/F/S 6-9 PM EST and post to YouTube at least once a week.

Stop in and chat, ask me questions, complain about Karen at work, whatever!

See you guys in there! Happy New Year!"

It’s a symbol for awareness against stigmas on bigger breeds.

Would love to see it worked."

Does anyone know the history as to why E-Sports are branded such a way?"

Most of us don’t give a shit what you’ve done.

A life’s a life."

I’ve had a girlfriend and a good friend network basically all throughout my teen life (am 18) and have never had an issue eating alone.

It shouldn’t bother you to sit down and eat somewhere... foods hot."

classicwow,fcgy5r1,t3_eh44hw,1577645233.0,"Hey, y’all!

I’m stuck between three classes.

Warrior, Rogue, and Priest.

I want to have plate and do lots of damage, but I also want to stealth onto Zepps, and even then I want to mind control people off things.

I have all these characters at level 30ish and I have no idea what to pick.

Thanks y’all"

Seaofthieves,fc86wk3,t1_fc86pdz,1577528211.0,"I saw a post today in here of someone posting a funny screw up with lightning hitting their ship causing mega kegs to explode.

I just thought it was funny but everyone in the comments was picking apart how they had their sword out and they’re stupid to do so and going on about their critique.

Is that the general theme of this sub? I haven’t been around here too long."

I use them in the gym and bouldering - they’ve never fallen out."
