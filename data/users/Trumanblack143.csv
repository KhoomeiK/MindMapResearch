college,ffd17kd,t3_esw3pa,1579811401.0,"I feel comfortable when in fact I’m not in school. Being on my own inside my room is what I called my comfort zone. And I know it gets lonely sometimes, but I feel like I’m not ready to commit something when my heart’s not fully interested in it. And I don’t want to torture myself again, and more importantly, I’m not going to fool myself ever again. Unless I’m into it, then I’d go for it. Thank you, btw. Goodluck to you as well. 
You’re an awkward type, then fair enough. hehe"

college,ff75ela,t3_eryxub,1579641467.0,same here! It’s the last day of registration tomorrow for this sem. And I was hesitant if I should enroll despite of my social anxiety. I was thinking all the things I’m going to missed like fun and stuff in university. Then I realized I wouldn’t sacrifice my mental state in order to do normal things like everybody else. I could take classes online or even work for an extra income. Hoping better days come yet for the people like us.
