For pro work so I should not have to buy a dongle just because apple decides that they will give you 4 usb c ports and a headphone jack . Also it is sd card reader not “we card readers” .

europe,feqct6w,t1_feqbghi,1579340192.0,Depends where you are living if you are near to the sea yes it is shorter but that is not always the same for every year and most of the Anatolian  cities that are away from the sea have a good amount of snowfall in the winter altitude just makes it harsher and longer .

AskEurope,fegw581,t1_fegtzh8,1579103870.0,Please inform me than because all you have done until now is saying :”It is a fact because I said it” unlike you I lived through the coup attempt and did my research but again what would I know when someone as wise as you says otherwise.
AskEurope,fegszte,t1_fegsbkd,1579101843.0,When did army gave single shit about rather the secular or democratic state of the country ? They only acted if it was against what they and their masters wanted .

AskEurope,fegp0nj,t1_fegnvsd,1579099121.0,"> legitimate

It was legitimate though but even though I am glad it has failed because if it was successful it would have caused a civil war in the country but it also gave erdogan huge ammounts power as a result of it failing."
AskEurope,fegouvy,t1_fegnrv3,1579099007.0,The thing is coup wasn't attempted by the army support an opposition to leadership not it was a group that was trying take over so they would not loose the power they gained over decades over hard work by doing all kinds shit.
