AskEurope,fegp0nj,t1_fegnvsd,1579099121.0,"> legitimate

It was legitimate though but even though I am glad it has failed because if it was successful it would have caused a civil war in the country but it also gave erdogan huge ammounts power as a result of it failing."
AskEurope,fegouvy,t1_fegnrv3,1579099007.0,The thing is coup wasn't attempted by the army support an opposition to leadership not it was a group that was trying take over so they would not loose the power they gained over decades over hard work by doing all kinds shit.
