food,ffha8k3,t3_eteeap,1579927682.0,I would love a recipe!
dyinglight,ffe1aj0,t3_epibgc,1579834114.0,Real high-tech security in harran nowadays.
food,ffcs3ss,t1_ffcqylk,1579806118.0,"I think the mods removed it for the sake of organization because of the tag. But I wouldn’t consider an incorrect tag to be an offensive mistake- definitely not something you’ll get banned over. At least I hope not. 

Thank you for understanding. I hope it all gets sorted out for you. :)"
food,ffcqg3d,t1_ffcq10b,1579805079.0,No worries. Just wanted to make sure you didn’t think people were insulting you or anything. I don’t want fights to start or people to feel hurt.
food,ffcdyxb,t1_ffbc4yb,1579797403.0,"I think you’re misunderstanding what they mean. That tag is for people who work in the restaurant business as chefs. It’s not about how good your food is. Your food can be the best in your city, but if you aren’t working in a restaurant- that tag doesn’t apply to you. It’s for people in that occupation."
apexlegends,ff9kzk4,t1_ff9knza,1579715211.0,That’s pretty neat! Thank you. :)
apexlegends,ff9kyq3,t1_ff9kpn6,1579715196.0,Yeah I noticed that they were craftable! That’s really cool! Thank you for your quick response!
apexlegends,ff9kaxj,t3_es7itl,1579714808.0,Hey everyone! Just had a quick question about the new event. In the store the items are separated into “event exclusive” and “new items”. Does this mean the new items will stay around even after the event is over?
IncelTears,ff4q43k,t3_erjlwv,1579569740.0,I think this is satire mocking the MGTOW mentality.
blunderyears,feug7xf,t1_feqyx7y,1579386225.0,Got that Val outlast 2 posture
Unexpected,fetjcod,t3_eqiod9,1579376051.0,I keep getting this stupid ad on YouTube. The game itself is nothing like any of its ads show.
gamingsuggestions,fec9j4t,t1_fec8e9z,1578969062.0,"Ah I see, okay. I’ll have to keep that in mind, thank you!"
gamingsuggestions,feai9kv,t1_feag1xw,1578949103.0,Oh ok! Thanks for the info. Would it be ok to skip the first? Or would the story not make sense.
gamingsuggestions,fea94dn,t1_fea5kl4,1578945827.0,I love the halo series! I think she’d really enjoy it!
gamingsuggestions,fe9jdl5,t1_fe9h9j7,1578938120.0,Thank you for all the suggestions!!
gamingsuggestions,fe8qo18,t1_fe8oz4m,1578929427.0,Sounds good! Thanks! I’ll have to look into them! :)
gamingsuggestions,fe8m06o,t1_fe83n0w,1578927734.0,Which Assassins Creed would you suggest starting with?
gamingsuggestions,fe8lvps,t1_fe6swdo,1578927679.0,They still sound interesting! She may still like the story even if they aren’t the most action packed.
gamingsuggestions,fe8ljo1,t1_fe6qq3w,1578927569.0,Max Payne and TLOU look really good! I’ll look into them more for sure :)
gamingsuggestions,fe8l72e,t1_fe6mz28,1578927426.0,"That game has been on my radar for a while now, I think I’m gonna have to get it! :)"
gamingsuggestions,fe8l167,t1_fe6mfs0,1578927363.0,Yeah as long as it isn’t overboard it should be ok. :)
gamingsuggestions,fe8kyxu,t1_fe6r4l2,1578927340.0,Oh ok. I’ll have to definitely check it out. I may just toggle off the gore then!
gamingsuggestions,fe6jw4c,t1_fe6jdzk,1578893295.0,Thank you so much! Will do!
gamingsuggestions,fe6icc9,t1_fe6hvvd,1578891817.0,"No she hasn’t actually! I figured it may be too dark or scary for her, seeing as it is an apocalypse and everything. What would you say about it? Are the zombies and everything pretty violent and gory?"
gamingsuggestions,fe6f777,t1_fe6f0kc,1578889095.0,I actually just started playing it! I’m gonna have to add that one to the list!
gamingsuggestions,fe6evdu,t1_fe6cvxq,1578888821.0,Oh ok! Thank you for the heads up!
gamingsuggestions,fe6eu8c,t1_fe6cz2n,1578888796.0,"That shouuuld be ok. I’ll just do a quick check to see, but I think it’ll be alright. :)"
gamingsuggestions,fe6bnua,t1_fe6bc0u,1578886327.0,I’ll have to check it out! I always liked choice based games like that.
gamingsuggestions,fe6bj0z,t1_fe6ami1,1578886228.0,"Tomb raider is an incredible series, one thing is ive heard though, is its pretty gory in some scenes- so I’d have to double check before getting them."
gamingsuggestions,fe6bflb,t1_fe6b4sp,1578886160.0,"Yeah that’s what made me steer away from Tomb Raider. (At least for my mum) the death scenes are way too intense for her to watch. 

Unless in the earlier games they weren’t as bad, I’ll have to double check just in case."
gamingsuggestions,fe6bb9m,t1_fe6affu,1578886072.0,I have it in my library actually! Never got around to playing it! Thank you for reminding me haha
gamingsuggestions,fe6b2v8,t1_fe69ley,1578885900.0,I’ve heard a lot about LA Noire. I’ll have to check it out!
apexlegends,fdnkz4d,t1_fdlui5q,1578587987.0,G7s gotta be my favourite gun without attachments so far. You can use it mid and even close range rapid fire to down someone real quick. It’s like a faster shooting Eva 8 sometimes haha.
AskReddit,fdkplfo,t1_fdkpbju,1578508504.0,"Yeah, I’ve noticed there’s definitely a lot of patterns and timing you have to pick up on. I wish I had the patience for it! (No worries dude, I understand!)"
AskReddit,fdkog7f,t1_fdko94t,1578507818.0,Dark souls is the bane of my existence. Idk how anyone can beat it :(
mechanical_gifs,fdcv4sp,t3_ekls77,1578285192.0,Yoooo I had that exact nongshim spicy ramen this morning! Good as hell!!
likeus,fdbcw55,t3_ei90uj,1578256139.0,Why does that chimp have better teeth than I do.
educationalgifs,fcwpai5,t1_fcwoecv,1578032440.0,"Wow. You put that so eloquently! Very very wise words and a great analogy. I totally agree with you. Thoughts are only as important in your mind as you designate them to be. 

If you just roll with it, the thoughts will blend into the rest of the thousands in your mind- and they won’t seem so important anymore. Or as you put it, you flow with the current- and the current becomes you."
educationalgifs,fcwmkss,t1_fcwapy0,1578029890.0,"That’s awesome! I’m super proud of you. It can take a lot to overcome whats in your own head, but remember you get stronger every day you practice this sort of thing. 

I hope one day the thoughts disappear entirely for you!"
educationalgifs,fcwmh8c,t1_fcw94f1,1578029804.0,"I’m glad they stopped happening for you. They can be very difficult to deal with.

Much like this man says in the video, fighting emotions and thoughts is very difficult, and usually makes it worse. I had my fair share of dealing with it for years, and I found that quicksand is the best way to describe those thoughts. 

If you fight against it and struggle to not “sink” you will only sink quicker. But once you relax and let the thoughts pass by you, you suddenly stop sinking. 

It’s almost as if the thoughts know they can’t bother you and go away entirely."
educationalgifs,fcw7kf4,t1_fcvllbe,1578018963.0,I find the best way to deal with intrusive thoughts is to just let them happen. Understand they’re not your thoughts and let them pass through your mind. Usually then they won’t bother you as much.
IncelTears,fcmgwaq,t3_ehfmil,1577774806.0,Even women without internet access apparently. Because that statistic was totally not made up on the spot!
Scams,fc4plhn,t1_fc4oxjw,1577423893.0,Ah Yeah. That can be common with the older generations.. sometimes it’s hard for them to let go of their pride if it means getting help or learning something new. I hope it all works out for you and them!
