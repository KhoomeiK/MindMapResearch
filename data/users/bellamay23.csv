AskReddit,fe0wtne,t3_enhe4f,1578819666.0,"Lamb,I used to really enjoy minted lamb kebabs when I was younger.. I then clicked that it was the cute little fluffy animal jumping about in fields all around me.. of course that meant no more lamb for me.. and it’s just kinda stuck! Can’t bring myself to touch it even now as an adult!"
AskReddit,fe0vxec,t3_enjzki,1578819283.0,"I used to dream that one of our neighbours was evil and he had a pet polar bear who was of course also evil. He got into the flat I grew up in and was trying to kill my whole family. We hid behind the wardrobe.. after having that dream on a regular basis I was terrified of that neighbour and the dark!

I also used to have another reoccurring nightmare about a stone monster that would chase me around my childhood village."

cats,fdztpmz,t3_en69wh,1578795564.0,"He was such a beautiful boy, you we’re lucky to have him for those 11 wonderful years! 
I don’t think there’s any proper way to move on as he was family. But as someone who has lost a fur baby I can say all though they’ll always be with you and you’ll miss them dearly it does get easier! 
For some getting a new cat is the next step, but that’s not the way for everyone.. it took me two years before I got a new kitty! 
However you find a way to move forward I hope it gets better for you 💖"

TrueCrime,fcwv2xj,t1_fcvmcse,1578038837.0,"Wow I almost gave up reading this because it’s so brutal! They should have gotten life in prison, death would’ve been to easy! Instead they get to now live their life’s whereas hers was brutally taken away from her.. and I don’t even think the word brutally does it justice! So heartbreaking to think what she went through!!"

Also I noticed that at the bottom of the middle section on this leaflet it says ‘ call your local Inquisitor and see what you can do to help.’  if I’m not mistaken!"
