Have a grounding tool in your pocket like a rock or key chain you can twiddle with when feeling anxious. Its definitely not easy and you may never completely stop but little techniques can help"

relationship_advice,fefyc21,t3_eoyhuc,1579069343.0,"You definitely arent over reacting. I would be really upset and worried. It's a weird sign that your sis was there...if that is 100% the reason he told you then that's really lame but you know him so if you believe he genuinely wanted to tell you and admit to his sneakyness then so be it. Its doubtful it was his idea to go to twin peaks, if his friends suggested it and the others were on board he may have felt awkward or lame saying no, doesnt mean he couldn't have told you though. If I was in that situation I'd take some time to relax if at all possible and breathe. Do something you enjoy to get your mind off of it then go back to him and the situation with a clearer head."

relationship_advice,fefxpgo,t1_fefqzxb,1579068682.0,You're right. Thank you for your advice. He is willing to learn so I need to beat my anxieties and tell him what I need. Thank you for clarifying for me. I really apperciate this!
relationship_advice,fefpou4,t1_fefoy6t,1579061706.0,Initially I called right after it happened while I was waiting for my parents and for the cops. I was so scared and just wanted to be confronted but he just kept asking random questions about my car when what I needed was literally just love and support. So I told him I'd call later. He texted me letting me know he was here whenever I was ready to call back. I call back after everything including me is more relaxed...and again hes just asking about my car or being silent...it was awkward. I was sad and scared and just needed to be cared for for like 1 minute. I felt myself getting disappointed so I said I was getting off the phone and hung up. He texted me like 3O minutes later apologizing for not comforting me the way I needed. He seemed sincere and told me to tell him how he can be more helpful next time. Which I know is really nice but I'm still really disappointed and upset and worried about his support in the future.

relationship_advice,fdfyhv8,t3_el6qr2,1578373789.0,If you're questioning it and dont feel entirely comfortable with it maybe wait a couple more dates. Otherwise you'll be anxious about it before hand and maybe even uncomfortable during which would ruin the date :/ but if you do feel totally comfortable with it then go for it. Dont worry about what others think is too slow or too fast. respect your boundaries:) have fun
relationship_advice,fdcvv79,t1_fdcvny5,1578285806.0,No you're right. I've already made the mistake. I wont meet up with Sid. But should I tell C? Or just try and let the whole thing go and ignore sid moving forward? It's just so hard he reaches out often enough (once a month) for me to not so easily forget him
