FantasyPL,ffdf6x5,t3_eryoqd,1579819602.0,"First time playing this game. I've spent a lot of time lurking the sub and listening to podcasts and the like, and have for the most part thoroughly enjoyed it. I started in GW3, and at one point I was in the top 500 in that league and was leading my ML (which admittedly only consists of 4 or 5 active players and 14 or so set and forget teams). I was also at OR 1.3M, which I thought was pretty  nice for someone who missed two gameweeks (and started the season, being a complete noob, with defensive midfielders and two 5m+ keepers in my team). It provided me with a lot of joy in this otherwise pretty shite year. 

From the festive period onwards it has all gone downhill and with this Mané TC disaster I think I have lost every bit of enjoyment I used to get from playing this. I'll now go ahead and remove all football-related bookmarks, unsubscribe from this sub and /r/soccer, and just pretend I never discovered this game. 

See you all next season. Or, more likely, in one or two GWs when I come crawling back."
FantasyPL,ffa41me,t3_eryoqd,1579727459.0,"A couple weeks ago I laughed at my closest ML rival getting in Pereira just when Leicester had lost Ndidi. 

I also felt smug when I, due to having nothing else to use my transfer on, swapped Henderson, a player we both had, for Ryan, right before Sheffield's tough run of fixtures. 

I got Martial for Dele, another player we both had, two GWs ago. That's been going great this GW too. 

Fuck my life. I was so optimistic for a while, now it's all going to shit. Goddamn."
FantasyPL,ff8wngf,t1_ff792oy,1579698531.0,"Don't drop Jimenez, you gotta remember that Wolves players are fixture proof and usually provide a steady stream of points regardless of opponent. 

I promise you'll regret selling Vardy. If you want some extra cash to upgrade DCL, bench, or Ryan, I'd look into Maddison replacements above all. But honestly, keep it as is for now."
FantasyPL,ff8plaj,t1_ff8pdqt,1579690568.0,"Heh, true. But I wouldn't have used at least the first FT if I didn't do this, so it feels less bad. Now just hoping that nobody in my squad gets injured so that I can use my remaining FT on getting out my DGW punt Firmino..."
suspiciouslyspecific,ff8mm4e,t1_ff8milk,1579686071.0,"Ah okay, makes sense. I'll look into it, thanks!"
suspiciouslyspecific,ff8l37l,t1_ff88ylj,1579683717.0,"From the website it seems like the supported operating systems are just Ubuntu, Debian, and some others I haven't even heard of. Do you know how would one go about setting it up then if all one has are some normal Windows and Android devices? What would I need to buy?"
FantasyPL,ff7sp4q,t1_ff7f2ju,1579657424.0,"14 from 4. (Ryan, Rico, KdB and Ings)

I got a measly 29 last GW, so this is enough to get me buzzing!"
FantasyPL,ff7r5rz,t3_es3awn,1579656355.0,"I took him out for Ryan before Sheffield's tough run of fixtures. I think it was a net positive transfer points-wise until tonight.

Guess who kneejerked him back in to beat the possible price rise too. Guessing that was the last of Hendo's non-blanks this season.

Aaaand he didn't rise either. Oh well. At least this whole ordeal didn't cost me more than 0.1."
FantasyPL,ff6w4kc,t1_ff6uitq,1579636105.0,Don't worry! I got in Firmino for the DGW so he'll get a red card in the 58th minute :)
FantasyPL,ff6sjq0,t3_eryoqd,1579633990.0,"Please Ings stay on the bench so Kelly can come in for the now inevitable Palace CS! 

I know it won't happen because Hasenhüttl will surely bring him on if it's still 0-0 or 1-0 at the 80 minute mark, but here's to hoping..."
2meirl4meirl,ff4tq8k,t1_ff3o2gd,1579572226.0,"Really enjoying it. Thanks for sharing!

Also, if you ever want to vent to a random internet stranger, please don't hesitate to send me a PM, as cliché as that sounds. It can get better."
2meirl4meirl,ff4tcyh,t1_ff447kz,1579571972.0,Was thinking the exact same thing. Wtf? I swear this must be a recent phenomenon
FantasyPL,ff1vglo,t3_eqf9np,1579487078.0,"Lmao, this was the highest score in my ML this week!

A set and forget team by someone who's never played before, with King (C) and Eastwood (VC)(!)"
FantasyPL,fezozzr,t3_eqf9np,1579459858.0,"Unbelievably shit gameweek. I dropped 300k. 29 points, Trent was the only one who didn't blank and captain Vardy betrayed my trust immensely. Fuck this game. :(

Side note: how the hell are the averages this high??"
FantasyPL,feuwb7a,t1_fetoj6y,1579390566.0,"It's a thing because this is the rant & discussion thread, not the boast & discussion thread. You'd get downvoted even by people with a higher score than you."
FantasyPL,fesio6s,t3_eqf9np,1579365620.0,"My God, Norwich! Doing fuckall with a one man advantage, and then losing it too! :("
FantasyPL,fejyb12,t3_epkrcn,1579188613.0,"Bench one of Martial (liv), Firmino (MUN), Cantwell (BOU)

Sounds ridiculous given their value but I kinda feel like playing Cantwell against this shite Bournemouth side."
FantasyPL,fejy3iw,t1_fejxx29,1579188481.0,"Yeah, I think it's worth it to wait. Always possible it was nothing and that he'll be fine for the weekend."
FantasyPL,fejg6ae,t1_fejg2nn,1579172684.0,Honestly idk I just recall having read that. It's entirely possible that my memory is betraying me and that I'm sprouting bullshit
FantasyPL,fejfstl,t1_fejfm54,1579172140.0,There'll absolutely be more. Biggest DGW is probably going to be GW37.
FantasyPL,fejfp9o,t1_feixhqp,1579171995.0,"I know, but as I said I don't really see a way to do that in my team without wildcarding. I don't want to change too much for just one double gameweek. This post was just about whether or not to bench Firmino against United."
FantasyPL,feiy4na,t3_epa3g9,1579150465.0,"New but I'd like to start! Here's my team

Foster

Holgate

El Ghazi

Lacazette"
FantasyPL,feiwavz,t1_feig1xd,1579148963.0,"Until Ward is back, which could be this GW. Might be a decent time to ship him, based on that."
FantasyPL,feivuc8,t3_ep2y18,1579148605.0,"Got Firmino a couple days ago because it looked like there was a risk of getting priced out for the DGW (I know he's not a good Fantasy asset but I'll ship him after the DGW, and it wasn't really realistic to get Salah or Robbo(got Mané and Trent)). Currently benching him this GW for Cantwell. Feels weird to bench such an expensive player but I have more trust in Cantwell doing well against Bournemouth... Anyone feel like they should talk me out of doing so?"
