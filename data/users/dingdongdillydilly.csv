Seattle,ffeiu9o,t3_et2j4j,1579849776.0,"We sold this past summer for way over asking and cash with intentions on leaving the state...  Things changed and were in a rental right now.  I'm working an offer for a 1980's era home priced at $560K and offered the $430K.  It's been sitting for months with not one single offer and they're sitting on it.  The house is owned out right, nobody lives in it and they're willing to let it sit until someone desperate enough comes along and pays their price."

PoliticalHumor,ffbxzsg,t1_ffbethb,1579786369.0,"The House allowed Nixon’s and Clinton's defense lawyers to respond to evidence and testimony during his impeachment inquiry.  Also, in both of those cases, the House also held a full vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry.  There was precedence on this procedure, so stop lying.

To the point of Executive privilege...  Yes, it would end up in court, just as countless assertions of executive privilege have.  But, there is a difference here.  [Justice Dept. memos back defiance of impeachment subpoenas](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.660citynews.com/2020/01/20/justice-dept-memos-back-defiance-of-impeachment-subpoenas/amp/)  “Absent any effort by the House committees to accommodate the Executive Branch’s legitimate concerns with the unprecedented nature of the committees’ actions, it was reasonable for executive branch officials to decline to comply with the subpoenas addressed to them,” says the opinion from Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel, who heads the legal counsel office.

Maybe the House should've voted to formally authorize the Impeachment inquiry.  You know, liked the previous impeachment inquiries..."
PoliticalHumor,ffbdq22,t1_ffb7hmn,1579760968.0,"You do realize every President since Washington has used Executive privilege, right?  So, any time it's used they are covering up a crime?

He'll use it, btw.  On all matters related to Ukraine going forward.  The calls were released, they excluded Trump's lawyers from the House basement hearings, why should he not use the privilege?"
PoliticalHumor,ffb6swy,t3_esjrmz,1579753336.0,Why is Trump using Executive privilege an issue?  He's not the first to use it.

Wellthatsucks,ff4uh4l,t3_eri8xl,1579572730.0,Had to have all 4 of mine surgically removed at 16...  My mom had zero sympathy for pain and she drug me to CompUSA to help her buy a new desktop the next day.  She needed it for work and me being high as a kite on pain meds talked her into buying the most expensive desktop for the most absurd reasons.  She lost her shit when the Y2K scare was happening and kept yelling at me and telling me I made her buy a shitty computer that only lasted 5 years.

Tennesseetitans,ff16wgu,t3_er42pf,1579475838.0,Enjoyed the playoff run...  Feel like we tried to control the clock to early after the first 10 points and got away from trying to run up the score quickly.
politics,fepmupf,t3_eq7k20,1579324724.0,"If anyone actually took the time to see the feedback on the changes that were made from Michelle's school lunch program, they'd know that food waste and cost have risen significantly since being implemented.  Also, my teenage sons aren't allowed certain extras within the school lunch line.  You can only get 1 entree and 1 milk...  Then it's paying a' la cart.

And guess what the schools did?   A' la cart is outside the school lunch line and in the form of pizza, sodas, ice cream and cookies for an increased price.  They call that fundraising for the school.  Thanks for charging my kid $2.25 for a soda once a week, $3.00 for an extra pizza because they aren't given enough food and $0.75 for a tiny chocolate chip cookie as a snack.

And before the backlash...  My kids play sports and bring water bottles and other snacks throughout the day.  They also bring their lunch from time to time, but having to make a lunch with 2 working parents, school, sports, homework and family time ain't easy.  I should be able too send my kids to school with $5 bucks each and they get full.  Not $7-$9 each two to three times a week."

It's a huge piece of scientific study that is the foundation for the current climate change discussion and what it's based on.

I'm not saying that the climate isn't changing, I'm also not saying I agree or disagree with either side.  I find myself more of a conservationist than an environmentalist."

There is, and Jewish and Roman accounts accompanied with the Gosples are very good accounts that prove his existence.  All accounts are in line with how history was recorded during those times.

Basically, the cost of taxes is passed on to consumers and it increases the annual federal spending $3 trillion on top of the $4.6 trillion spent.  So, $7.6 trillion annually federal budget, or 67% increases, and the people it's supposed to help bear the additional costs.

I did forget to mention that if your already on certain welfare programs you can't double dip.  So, if you can't double dip because you're on welfare, isn't this UBI really a form of welfare in disguise?"
