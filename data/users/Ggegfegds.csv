AskHistory,fecyw2b,t3_eofoft,1578990381.0,"Hitler's endgame was a little vague, but generally involved conquering Eastern Europe up to the Urals. The Jews and other undesirables would be exterminated, and the remaining inhabitants would be reduced to second-class citizens, leaving the land empty and open for settlement by German farmers. This would be Germany's *Lebensraum*, i.e. ""living space.""

This plan really goes back to the fact that Germany got into the colonization game too late. By the time Bismarck united Germany in 1871, all the good colonies were already taken. Furthermore, the scraps that Imperial Germany did manage to grab were taken away from them when they lost the First World War. Of course, it was a huge blow to German national pride that it was the only major European power that didn't have a colonial empire. Hell, even little Belgium had the Congo! Hitler's solution to this problem was, ""If they can have Asia and Africa, we can have Eastern Europe!""

For his part, Hitler always claimed that he had no interest in a war in the west. Of course, Hitler was a big fat liar, so we can't exactly take his word for it. Since it was Britain and France who declared war on Germany, in response to the Nazi invasion of Poland, we can't know for sure whether Hitler did plan to have a war in the west at some point. But suffice it to say that a massive German empire occupying most of Europe was definitely not in Britain and France's interest."
