worldnews,ffd4hio,t1_ffd3z0v,1579813247.0,The Republicans brought two witnesses and it back fired in their faces. If you're talking about Hunter and Joe Biden go ahead and bring them. The facts don't support that conspiracy theory.
worldnews,ffd39qu,t1_ffd2ucw,1579812566.0,The whole republican Senate is propping him up. Unless you think it's normal for a trial not to have witnesses and evidence and the jurors have publicly broken their oaths. Just completely normal. They don't even try to hide the corruption.
worldnews,ffd2c2q,t1_ffd0t0j,1579812033.0,You see the problem is the party of law and order is in charge now and they have no ethics or morals.
television,ffcjnje,t1_ffcdt1i,1579800880.0,What did you copy and paste that from? Why do I give a shit about the embassy being in Jerusalem? NATO countries are paying what they agreed to under Obama. He's given huge permanent tax breaks to the rich and corporations. That money isn't trickling down like you're pretending it is. He's fucking the environment for short term gains. These things have costs that you're not seeing. But you will and you'll probably blame it on the libs.
television,ffcd6ti,t1_ffccmyz,1579796915.0,The crimes are a nice bonus too. I don't know what you think he's doing as a positive for you unless you're rich as hell. He's economic policies are extremely short sighted. He's blowing up the debt and deficit. He's destroyed our standing on the world stage. He's actively hurting the environment. But hey you're right he's pissing off the libs. My point was he doesn't care about anyone but himself. He's doesn't love anyone. He wants to be loved. Something his father never have him. He's a broken man that thinks being powerful will get him respect and that's why he gets so angry and runs when that doesn't happen.
television,ffcaq6t,t1_ffc5r53,1579795370.0,There he is. No matter how much you defend Trump he's not going to love you. He doesn't even love his own children except for Ivanka in a very disturbing way.

worldnews,ffac1bj,t1_ffaax37,1579731986.0,"Oh I see your still buying a proven lie or are you trying to push one?

Edit: The money was withheld from Ukraine based on bipartisan US support and international support. Biden was the put in charge of doing it. It was withheld to get them to fire a prosecutor who was not tough enough on corruption. This was done to help the people of Ukraine. Trump withheld money from Ukraine to illegally help himself. No amount of spin from Trump supporters will change those two things."
