blursedimages,ffb1i9t,t3_eslo6g,1579749457.0,"I used to work for a call center that did tmobile customer service.  I had to be there at 4:00am to get yelled at by people from New Jersey & New York. I would cry on my way to work and not even remember how I got there (I was only getting 2 hours of sleep a night).  I would be sitting on a call with tears, but oddly it didn't sound like it in my voice...The day that my call center filed for bankruptcy was the happiest and the most irritating day of my life.  


Edit:  I can't reply to the comment because of the topic being locked, so I'm just editing this.  There was the irritating stuff and there were parts where I was fortunate compared to my coworkers.

I was a little lucky at the time because I was getting a gold crown placed on a back tooth and it was covered by the insurance they gave us, but the bad part comes that everyone's paycheck bounced.  Another wave of luck...I had been using netspend (prepaid debit card) at the time so as soon as coworker called me, I transfered my paycheck that I had gotten 2 days earlier, from the checking into my savings portion of the account. Since it was a prepaid, I got my check before everyone else.  They still owed a lot of money to me and all the employees.  Claims had to be filed with BOLI (bureau of labor and industries) to get our money that was due.

The reason why it was irritating is because I happened to have the day off and was at the dentist when my co-worker called and said that when he showed up to the building, there was a notice on the door that said that bankruptcy proceedings were in place.  No one could get in the building at all to get personal belonings.   We had to wait a week to go back to the site and we had to be searched by security and escorted to our desks to make sure we didn't steal anything.  Locked in that building the whole time was a couple of my meds that I had no access to for that week (because I was an idiot and after picking up my meds, I placed them in my locker, planning to go after my dentist appt to get them) along with other stuff we owned but had no way to access.  A few people that I knew lost their apartments/homes because it took about 6 weeks to get the money that we were owed (we didn't actually get all of it, even working with boli).  It was just horrible all around, seeing the people that I suffered with, hitting rock bottom and losing the way of life that they and their kids had been depending on."
