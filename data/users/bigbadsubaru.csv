""Like [calico cats](https://www.thesprucepets.com/are-calico-cats-always-female-3384568), you'll find most tortoiseshell cats are female. That's because the same chromosomes that determine their sex also determine the colors in their coats.

The female sex chromosome (X) also carries the genetic code for orange *or* black coat colors; the male sex chromosome (Y) does not carry information on coat color.

Because females have two X chromosomes, they have two sets of genetic information that can determine their coat color. The embryo shuts off one X chromosome in each cell, resulting in orange and black color variations in their coats.

Because a male cat has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, he'll *only* be orange or black—not both.

In very rare cases—about 1 in 3,000—a male tortoiseshell cat can be born with two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome. Unfortunately, male cats with XXY Syndrome are sterile and often have serious health issues, resulting in significantly shorter lifespans than female torties.""
