Imagine having to compete in the Water Utility, and needing to physically change the water supply for a single house.  If you're not changing the water source, then you're getting the same water.  Why change companies if you're getting the same product?  How is one company making money if the other is providing the service?  Why compete if you will not make money?  

Water is the most obvious example, by far, but the same principle holds true for natural gas and electricity.  Refineries and generators are expensive.  Burying gas lines is expensive.  Maintaining transmission lines and power grids are expensive.  When you see companies who try to compete in these markets, the newcomer will always lease infrastructure from the incumbent, because the start-up costs are astronomical, and your market share is zero.

> You've heard the question, ""If everyone else jumped off a cliff, would you jump, too?”  Well, Scouting does not require that you believe the ghost of man who died 2000 years before you were born is actually the almighty.  However, that story does help teach some of the ideals we believe is important: to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful... sound familiar?  Ok.  ""God"" is code for your imaginary friend.  Some people call their imaginary friend ""Jesus.""  Others call him, ""Allah,"" ""Jehovah,"" ""Buddha,"" or ""Thor.""  I call mine Bob.  (What you don't like Bob?  Are you the King of Bob now?  Old movie reference, never mind.)  Some people call that voice their conscience, but Bob talks to me, and nobody else can hear him.  He reminds me to be a good person, and suggests things that I should or should not do.  My Duty to Bob... Err God, is to do what he asks when what he asks is difficult, as well as when it's easy.  

To OP: I hope that explanation helps.  In my experience, many(if not most) Scoutmasters, even those whose troops are chartered by a church, don't really want to discriminate against someone who doesn't read the same bible they do, so long as you respect the fact that others do.

Why are you arguing about banning a weapon with such a ""lack of prominence of ownership of AR15 style rifles compared to the common ownership of hand guns.""  and not hand guns?  Here's a better question, take the AR-15 style weapon out of the equation, The vast majority are now 9mm pistols.  Will you want to ban those?  Why 9mm and not the .45ACP?  

The AR-15 is the **most popular rifle in the US.**  Because the US Department of Defense has used it as their primary weapon for 50 years, millions of soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, and Coast Guardsmen have been qualified to use and maintain *that rifle.*  I'd be shocked if it weren't prominent on that list.  

Want to talk about body count?  Why are rental trucks still absolutely fine after one was used to kill six people in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing?

Yes, I know, explosives killed all those people, but explosives were already banned and the truck was only the delivery method.  But you know what, guns don't kill people either, they are only the delivery method for the bullet.  On average, cars kill more people *daily* than all firearms have outside of military combat in the 20th century.

Whether you realize it or not, arguing for an ""Assault Weapons Ban"" is arguing for a total firearm ban.  Because you can't define the scary black rifle you want to ban, without banning them all, or doing nothing.  The Bushmaster XM-15 was designed as an AR-15 that complied with the last ban attempt.

What does that wall of text tell us? 
 
* (1) There were no instances of mass shooting between 1991 and 1999.  and the next mass shooting was 8 years later in 2007.  Then 27 in the following 10 years.  Your assumption is incorrect.  
* (2) Rifles are not commonly used in US Mass Shootings, ""Assault Weapon"" or not.
* (3) 8 of 27 shootings involved a weapon that was named in the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, 1 was only used by Law Enforcement, 1 was homemade, and another 2 also included explosives that the shooter acquired despite being banned.  
* (4) 19 of 27 used a modern pistol.
* (5) It's not the AR-15, it's not ""assault weapons,"" it's not the guns.

And that's where your fundamental lack of economic knowledge shows.  In the US today,  ""Wealth Tax"" is the colloquial term for a progressive income tax that aims to charge households with a net worth above $50 million annual 2% tax on all assets — , and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.

In the current US tax scheme, where the **effective** tax paid by households with $50+ Million is a lower percentage than the bottom 50% of taxpayers.  Long term capital gains tax is capped at 20% before deductions.  Income tax brackets are capped at 37%, a household making $40k is taxed at 22%, and the standard, non-itemized deduction, which the vast majority of Americans take is $24.400.   

So, you might be asking, ""What kind of deductions exist for the wealthy that don't exist for the rest of us?""  Well, twenty percent (101 of 500) of the 500 wealthiest companies in the US paid **Negative Income Tax** for Q1-3 of 2019.  Companies such as Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Exxon Oil, got back more in tax rebates and deductions than they paid.  Amazon's financial statements show that the company received $419 million more in tax credits than they paid in 2018."

politics,fcsk38m,t1_fcrwyp2,1577918153.0,"Try being a liberal gun owner.  The only thing on the Democratic platform I cannot agree with is gun control.  If they can accomplish half of the rest of their platform, specifically including a wealth tax to end the income inequality problem and a real healthcare reform that takes mental health seriously, gun violence will solve itself.  The AR-15 has been on the commercial market since 1960, the mass shooting thing is new.  It's not the guns, it's something else.
