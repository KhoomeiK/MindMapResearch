It's a trade-off of maintainability Vs delivery speed Vs performance Vs feature access. The right tool for the right situation. 

You use an orm for the same reason that you should be using a framework for every other aspect; yes you should know how to do it by hand and how it works under the hood but you also shouldn't be trying to build it by hand.
Quite frankly each and every bad code base I've seen was written by developers who thought they could do it better than people who specialise on a certain topic. 

Let's be honest 90% of applications are simple crud applications and for the part that would benefit from native SQL every orm worth their salt allows that.

Furthermore; there are often added benefits such as state migration features and database independence.

We're now in the process of untangling a gordian knot of someone who thought they had l33t SQL skills. In reality they had no clue what they were doing and thousands of lines of code have been reduced to a fraction with orm and our performance and maintainability has drastically improved. 

Also; there are as many flavours of SQL as orms."

softwaredevelopment,fcswhwt,t1_fcsrxsx,1577926882.0,"I disagree. Orms are an abstraction with a purpose. Yes orms might take a performance hit but in some/most cases it can be acceptable. It's a trade-off of maintainability Vs delivery speed Vs performance Vs feature access. The right tool for the right situation. 

You use an orm for the same reason that you should be using a framework for every other aspect; yes you should know how to do it by hand and how it works under the hood but you also shouldn't be trying to build it by hand.
Quite frankly each and every bad code base I've seen was written by developers who thought they could do it better than people who specialise on a certain topic. 

Let's be honest 90% of applications are simple crud applications and for the part that would benefit from native SQL every orm worth their salt allows that.

Furthermore; there are often added benefits such as state migration features and database independence.

We're now in the process of untangling a gordian knot of someone who thought they had l33t SQL skills. In reality they had no clue what they were doing and thousands of lines of code have been reduced to a fraction with orm and our performance and maintainability has drastically improved. 

Also; there are as many flavours of SQL as orms."
