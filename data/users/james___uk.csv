Permaculture,fcvz73h,t1_fcv20ff,1578013455.0,"Veganism being expensive doesn't add up, you can buy fruit and veg for less than meat that's just the economics of it, animals are middlemen to this cost. As for nutrition many bodybuilders and [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org) can do a better job than I can of explaining why plant based diets are good, but that's not necessarily hand in hand with veganism anyway. I eat rubbish, but I've done enough research to know I could happily eat very well without meat and live longer for it.

Manure is great but it's still processed plant matter, it's already done a bunch of the work without mulching but it's still taken time to do that inside that animal that's been given food and water to begin with.

As for farmable land I bet that does happen, grass will grow where crop doesn't but you're still going to get your animal crops for the rest of their nutrition.

I went vegan because I believe it's more right than the way we use animals. The chicken for example is supposed to lay eggs around once a fortnight, it's painful and isn't supposed to be daily but that's what modern day bred chickens do. As for living happier lives many of them probably would but they're often shorter ones. Most animals are slaughtered at a fraction of their lifespan, not that it's necessarily OPs way if it has other purposes but not everything is as useful as everything else"

Veganisn certainly isn't a thing of privelege, plenty of manufacturers seem to think so but poorer nations  live on staple diets of beans, rice, bread, etc. They eat meat but not like we do in first world countries, meat is a more expensive food everywhere. 

I've certainly seen vegans who buy products that way and I've seen vegans who bring up the issue too. No group is ever perfect but some groups want to do less harm than others. At the end of the day I saw the information I didn't want to take a closer look at before"
