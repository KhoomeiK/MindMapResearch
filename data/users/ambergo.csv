Mcat,fcp65nm,t3_dbwp5v,1577851746.0,"**Required**:

* **Location:** in person: La Jolla / Clairemont Mesa (basically San Diego) // online: anyone in Pacific Standard Time
* **Test Date**: Aiming for May 9 or May 16
* **MCAT Prep Material**: Kaplan Complete 7 Book Subject Review + Khan Academy + Anki flashcards + AAMC FL exams
* **Online/In-Person/Both/No-Preference**: Any, but preferably a mix of the two: sometimes online, sometimes in-person.

**Optional (but recommended)**:

* **Stage of studying/study plan**: I just got my MCAT prep material today (Dec 31, 2019) so I am in the process of creating an effective study plan. My preliminary plans include studying Mon-Sat (maybe even Sun) for 4-6 hours. I want to take a full length exam every 2 weeks. I honestly don’t know if this is a practical or effective and efficient study plan yet because I haven’t started. The alternative plan would be to study the same amount of time per day but drill FL exams after completing content review. 
* **Goal of a Study Buddy**: It would be great if we could hold each other accountable, help each other out if we get stuck, share tips, and above all else, maintain sanity (i.e. I know there will be ups and downs and it’s nice to have someone to relate to because the MCAT terrifies me)
* **Goal Score and Realistic Score**: I haven’t taken a practice or diagnostic exam yet but 514+ would be ideal.
* **Other obligations**: I am about to start looking for a part-time scribing or volunteering position at clinics / medical centers (\~10-15 hours/week). 

**Optional (100%)**:

* **Age/Gender**: 21F
* **Other Information/Ice Breakers**: I need to fix my sleep schedule (lol) so that I can start studying at 8am Mon-Sat. As far as my personality goes, my friends would describe me as bubbly, social, passionate, determined, and focused. I don’t want to make this post too long so if you would like to get to know more about me or if you’re interested in studying together, just send me a message! I’m really friendly and won’t be a distraction, I promise. c:"
