texas,ffcghxf,t3_estp03,1579798955.0,"I am an immigrant (a legal one, However, that's neither here or there). I can't vote atm. I have posted here multiple times about how much I love this wonderful state, because it made me feel welcome and at home, almost instantly, even more so than back 'home'.

It is out of love (and respect) for this home of mine that I say  we can definitely do better. 2 years ago (right around the time I had my kid), Texas was leading the country in having the highest maternal mortality rate, which was pretty not cool. The education system and the healthcare system in the state could also do with improvement."

AskReddit,feeikhu,t3_eol16q,1579034472.0,"I'd like to preface this by saying I love all animals. If it were legal and healthy (for our other pets) I'd freaking adopt a raccoon or skunk or whatever. 

We have a couple dogs. One's a husky and the other's a shih-tzu ish mop. They're both AGGRESSIVELY friendly and adorable. When I met my husband, he had (still does) a beautiful black cat. I was delighted to meet her acquaintance and after petting her and only her for 2 years, I decided I wanted my own cat. Mind you, I still thought I was a dog person. When we went to the shelter, this teeny tiny kitten (mix of tortie and tabby colors) who was 2 months old started meowing very demandingly at me. She'd been at the shelter for 2 months minus one week, and in that week she'd been adopted and returned because she was too feisty.  Well, while I was petting her she decided that she'd like to adopt us, and that's how I adopted my own cat. 

In these past 5 years since she's been ours, She's seen me through a master's and a doctoral degree, a difficult pregnancy, and countless other things. She's also reluctant friends with our female turtle, and protects her from the 2 horny male turtles. She's the best. She's also the reason that I am now ALSO a cat person. 

The other cat is also awesome and is 19 years old and loves fried chicken."

AbsoluteUnits,fdqpku7,t1_fdnf9de,1578672129.0,"We rescued ours from the City of Houston shelter. They unfortunately, have many Huskies, which they said they got because of GoT. When we were filling out his paperwork, one of the caretakers came out to talk to us about how huskies (malamutes, Alaskan etc.) Don't belong in such hot climates. We told her that we totally agreed with her but unfortunately he was already in a hot climate, we were just providing him with a home. 

Through the summers  especially during the day, he mostly spends time indoors being a derp playing with our other (non-husky) doggos, and during the fall, he spends the time inside and out being a derp.

Now we're moving to a colder area, so I guess he'll never come indoors, and I'll have to figure out how to get our other doggos to wear sweaters"

It's our catahoula who is more of an escape artist. When she was the only pupper we had, she'd climb our fence, and go out exploring, and then hitch a ride back with a police officer (she has plenty of police officer friends)."

You are a superhero. If baby gets fed, you are good. Whether it's formula, or boob juice it doesn't matter as long as baby gets fed. I don't think baby cares as long as his/her tummy is full.

My son (he's going to be 2.5 years old now) was born 6 weeks early. I had severe SEVERE preeclampsia that was totally unexpected ( never had high BP, was a normal weight etc.), So he was a bit unexpected that early. Obviously, my milk hadn't come in. The lactation expert at the hospital who was supposed to help us looked at my output and was very critical. When the L&D nurse heard that, she was pretty pissed, and told me that the Lactation lady knew nothing since she never had a baby and never lactated.

When I finally started producing more, I could produce a lot more, but my son wouldn't want it as much, and meal times would be a bit of a struggle, because it would taste soapy to him. I pumped religiously for 6 months, every 2 hours, without fail, but he was still pretty scrawny (tall but underweight). At 6 months we tried formula, and lil dude took to it so well. He absolutely loved it. His weight shot up, and both his pediatrician and I were so shocked."
