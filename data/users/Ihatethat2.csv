ChoosingBeggars,fd6zym7,t1_fd6ye7y,1578197791.0,"Yeah, but you can get nutritious food
cheaply. I think it also depends on the food bank and how they source their range. We don’t have food stamps where I live but we are currently rolling out a cashless welfare system . I think the school based feeding programs provide the
most benefit - where the kids get fed breakfast, lunch, and a bulky afternoon snack. I do wonder how much it must suck being poor and malnourished to boot , though"
ChoosingBeggars,fd6vkn9,t3_ek3zv7,1578196274.0,"I have helped out in a  small way at food banks from time to time and was alarmed at how much utter shit was being given out. Considering the majority of it was being given to families that needed to feed children , I often wondered if they were just being set up for further disadvantage by early exposure to highly processed foods. I totally understand that something is better than nothing but it still made me think. I don’t know the answer to this complex problem but I can kind of see the point here . Just a pretty obnoxious way to provide feedback"
