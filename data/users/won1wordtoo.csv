tifu,fdjxlk3,t3_eljaun,1578490700.0,"This is such a precious story. It sounds like OP has a sense of humor about it all. In spite of these difficult life hurtles (cows! Math! Mad mom! The wonders of great earplugs! Wisdom tooth! Infection!), they have survived and brought me a laugh. You are a super-hero, OP."

chuck,fd5h0bf,t3_ejzjqn,1578177545.0,"It’s on Prime. I share the Internet fees with someone that lives in a different apartment in my complex. So, yeah, I did a search a few months back, and hooray! DVDs are available, too. I purchased them for our library to loan. Good luck on your endeavor!"
IllegallySmolCats,fcz99ha,t3_ejf13l,1578096248.0,"Everything. A scientific study could be partially carried out with this video. I just witnessed that little thing learn SO many difficult moves, in one minute."
cats,fcz8vp2,t1_fcyvueg,1578096024.0,As far as you know?
suspiciouslyspecific,fcvux73,t3_ej0892,1578010662.0,All the time. Alllll the time.
chuck,fcismis,t3_eham5j,1577668843.0,Which episode?
cats,fcincky,t1_fchzbic,1577665464.0,"Thank you. Yeah, I saw the price and said “Nope”. Now, if it was $29.95, I would’ve been all over it. And my cat would probably just stare at it, with a look that reads: “ What is this monstrosity?”"

tifu,fc5ci56,t1_fc5aewv,1577453277.0,"Yeah, this is a great start to my day."
TrueCrime,fc0mkpc,t1_fbz94xv,1577294610.0,100% true statement. Wow.
CRedit,fbkkpbx,t1_fbkib52,1576951839.0,"Got it. Thank you. I was probably incorrect about that very low score, but it was embarrassingly low. I had been in trouble with drugs, and just burned every  single bridge, including all financial bridges, so to speak. I am sure I wrote bad checks, too.  I’m ashamed of that time, but I’ve changed. It’s been a long battle, especially with my finances. It was kind of a little victory that I was approved for this card. Thank you for your insight and advice. I truly didn’t know that bank accounts had nothing to do with credit. I will do what you suggested, while making sure to check my account frequently."
