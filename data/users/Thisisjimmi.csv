AskReddit,fdkslgn,t3_els9lh,1578510290.0,"I see a lot of people saying to include your players in the story or dialogue, there are a few caveats to help with this:

Say your person is a edgy, quiet rogue who doesn't speak much; An example of how to get him involved without too much effort would be to have one of the NPCs who is moving the story along say something like ""whats up with the quiet one, I don't like quiet ones"" and get him involved, start a little rivalry between allies or something-- just like would happen in real life with untrusting parties.

Something else you can do is make something happen directly to them that makes them be involved in some way. If a princess is making a decision and you have your typical outgoing shotcaller trying to talk to her, have her say she wants to talk to the quiet one with the old eyes, and make up some back story about his eyes being someones eyes she used to know. Even if he is moving the story forward with one word answers, hes still moving it along. You can also have something put him under a spell, use one of his skills or traits to do masonry or a language he understands. 

Just make a note to keep them involved, even if its only so often-- they will appreciate the nods and feel just as involved as the outgoing group leader."

Most of us don't feel like we actually do any service, we are just worker bees, who never see real combat, and me and others who I have talked to, feel that we don't deserve to be clumped in with real heroes.

Start saying ""thank you for your sacrifice"". We do however give up holidays and birthdays and leave our families and friends for years at a time. We work long hours and get paid shit wages. It's not very glamorous, doesn't mean we aren't proud to serve and do it, just takes a lot of sacrifice."

witcher,fcsfwm4,t1_fbjaygi,1577915945.0,"I think it's more than just that, Witcher aside. Rotten tomatoes favors critics to audience a lot. The end sum of the reviews is mostly critic weighed, which, hey sometimes a show isn't targeted at them, I guess. The release day of a show, with already a 0/5 (Dave Chappelle, sticks and stones) can be the death of an undeserving show. So maybe If they took down some restrictions against audience, some restrictions preventing more common critics (it's hard to be a critic on rotten tomatoes, think entry level job stuff) and didn't put private screenings to give reviews before something even came out. Just seems like more pocket lined bullshit using it as a metric for who watches your show and when."
