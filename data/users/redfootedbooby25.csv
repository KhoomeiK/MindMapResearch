AskReddit,ffk6qw8,t3_ett7fr,1580017706.0,Secretly holding out hope that my ex and I will get back together while dating others over the years. He was terrible to me while we were together... but I loved him. It has RUINED relationships with other men for years because all I've ever done is unconsciously compare them to him. I regret this completely.
IdiotsInCars,ff22cqa,t3_er6blf,1579491916.0,I hate that I know where this roundabout is just by looking at the surrounding buildings and businesses. Oh Appleton drivers. They're maniacs.
FREE,ff1wh94,t3_er57j9,1579487753.0,Hi thank you for being a kind generous stranger today!
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feeffl4,t1_feefamc,1579032653.0,"She's 50% mini Aussie, 33% American Pitbull, 7% English coonhound, 10% supermutt. I thought she was a dachshund mix when I first got her."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feeb38a,t1_feeaj99,1579030101.0,"She is definitely one of the strangest, most lovable derps I've ever met. So weird sometimes."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fee2pl2,t1_fee1fs1,1579025163.0,So cute!!! We all thought she was part Dachschund too when I first adopted her. She's got that type of snout and her ears look exactly like one too. Until they flop up like this picture.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fee2jel,t1_fee1px7,1579025059.0,"I agree wholeheartedly. I wish I could run as fast or sleep as soundly as my girl does. There was actually one time I was extremely ill for 2 days where I did nothing but sleep or vomit and she stayed on the bed with me the entire time. Refused to eat until I did. But the second a friend took her out on a walk, she was bouncing off the walls with excitement. Must be nice."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fee28nr,t1_fee1yoe,1579024881.0,Well this is just crazy! Please keep me updated on what your pup's DNA comes back as. This is super interesting!! Mine and her sister both got brought up here to WI. They're almost 2 years old now.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fee22zl,t1_fee1x3a,1579024787.0,"She just has a little nub for a tail, much like Aussies do. Her ears are actually usually floppy and how she expresses herself best. Not sure how she managed to sleep with them fully up!"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fedy6vm,t1_fedxjp5,1579022386.0,"Oh my gosh! Mine just sat there in a catatonic state like ""what is this sorcery in my mouth?!"" And then ran away from me when I was done!"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fedwzto,t1_fedwkzi,1579021667.0,"She is somehow the most energetic dog AND also the laziest. If given the opportunity, we could nap for days. But the second she hears my keys jingle or I put on a coat, the zoomies and butt wiggles come out for a walk or the dog park, where she can run for hours."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fedq25n,t1_fedpudj,1579017422.0,I used Embark's kit. It was a simple swab test and then just dropped into a USPS drop box. Got the results about a month later. They also have an option between just breed and breed + health!
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fedp6ec,t1_fedot3i,1579016871.0,"Maybe your pup is her long lost sibling! Her and her sister came from Missouri, and that's all I know of her life before I adopted her. Her sister was a taller and leaner than she is. I think my girl may have been the runt of the litter."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fedmnf8,t1_fedmhy5,1579015248.0,"I got her DNA tested! She's 50% mini Aussie, 33% American pitbull, 7% English coonhound, and ~10% ""supermutt.""

Edit: I can't type well apparently. A word."

AskReddit,fdkbuez,t3_elssvy,1578500576.0,I used to think wax strips were just tape and tried to rip out my arm hair all the time with masking tape. Learned what wax was in middle school. I'm not proud.
IDontWorkHereLady,fdgyyax,t3_eky08x,1578411718.0,This is my dream scenario as someone who also works on constructions sites more or less watching work being done and constantly dealing with entitled people/idiots in cars. Thank you for letting me live vicariously through you.
