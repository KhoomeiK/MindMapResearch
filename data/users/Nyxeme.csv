I would say enjoy, but if you enjoy this there is something really wrong with you. :)

&#x200B;

>Stalaggh are perhaps one of the most controversial projects in music history. They are a project who aim to show people the true meaning of pain and suffering through their ""music"". They did this by recording the raw screams of mental patients, and Projekt Misanthropia is by far their most famous release.  
>  
>This album is often cited as the most terrifying album in existence, and for good reason. This is a huge cacophony of people screaming for long periods of time. If you enjoy listening to this, then there's something wrong with you. It's just petrifying really. As soon as it starts, I just found myself unable to turn it off. It's just such a horrifying thing to be listening to: the suffering of real people. Listening to this is listening to the screams of a thousand tortured souls in Hell. This album is Hell. Like, if Hell had a known sound, this would be it. It's such an awful piece, but it's so interesting at the same time, and it succeeds at what it's trying to do.  
>  
>Although this album is very much just screaming for thirty minutes, there are still some instrumentals to at least make it somewhat tolerable. While I think 'tolerable' would be a bad word to use in this topic, since this isn't meant to be enjoyed, I do think they understood that they at least had to make it appealing to some audience. Instead of making it a complete unlistenable mess of disgusting noises, consisting of only the screams of suffering people, they decided to add some black metal guitar riffs being played really quietly in the background. To some this may seem like a bad decision, as it's either taking away from the main message of the album, to portray true pain, or it's just trying to be too edgy by playing brutal instrumentals in the background of some truly uncomfortable sounds, but, to me, it adds to the overall atmosphere. While, yes, I do agree that it makes it seem like they're trying a bit too hard with their point and that kinda takes away from the overall feel, it at least makes me kinda """"enjoy"""" it. Again, 'enjoy' is probably the wrong word to use in this situation, but I can't think of any other word to use right now.  
>  
>This is honestly a really interesting project. I mean, I'd never willingly return to it just because of how sad and downright sickening it is, but they really succeeded in what they were trying to do. This is not an easy listen, and not many people would manage to sit through the whole thing, but this really is an album that, when taking into consideration what it's trying to do, is actually quite good. I mean, if you take away the main point of it, it can seem pretty shitty, like it's just noise for the sake of edginess and noise, but because we know that there was a legitimate intent behind it, I have to say that: yes, this is a good album.  
>  
>Also, apparently one of the members of the group was stabbed by one of the patients during the recording of this, but I haven't been able to pinpoint the part where this happens."
