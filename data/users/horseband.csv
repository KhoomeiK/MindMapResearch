For simplicity sake your company may just treat everyone as if they have worked for two years and are covered by the 2 year law, but that is not the requirement of the law.

“Employees can only claim unfair dismissal if they’ve worked for a qualifying period - unless they’re claiming for an automatically unfair reason” (automatically unfair is discrimination based usually, but there are a few non discrimination reasons)

Even the two year protection is not exactly what you are describing. It simply provides more protections and gives you greater rights to inquiry on the exact reasoning (they have to provide a written reasoning to you if you’ve worked for two years)

Regardless of the time you have worked somewhere employers have rights as well. They have a list of potentially fair firing reasons. This picture company has a very clear route to firing people for not meeting quotas.

They have a policy that is enforced with all employees. The job itself is selling photos and hitting a quota. The lack of getting visitors to smile  is a method of instructing you on how to fix your lack of hitting the quota. It hits every box legally required assuming they give you a few opportunities to improve.

The citizen advice one is easier to read but the gov.uk one has more information overall to your protection and lack of protection. Prior to 2012 you only had to hit one year but it was decided that was too little time and harmed companies apparently. The gov one clearly lists out exactly what the company needs to do to ensure they are dismissing properly. Typically it is 3 written warnings to the employee and after the employee fails to improve the third time they can be fired assuming the reasons written are not discriminatory. Under 2 years of employment you have way less rights to fight it unless you claim discrimination) . You are correct about the warnings but overstating how lengthy the process has to be or how hard it is for a company to pull reasons out their arses."
dating_advice,ffphqkn,t1_ffoesbl,1580095338.0,"You stated you have only hung out/gone on dates three times total over a three month period. Based on your comments and post it sounds like you would have gladly hung out way more. 

Is the low amount of dates/hanging out because you have been busy or because he has been busy? The three times you did hang out was it after he asked you or did you have to ask him? Finally, are you usually the one who asks to hang out?

I'm just trying to get a better picture of the dynamic. Like if he's been trying to hang out with you often but you are just always busy it would be different than him always being too busy to hang out with you. Another factor is whether the times you have hung out were planned ahead or was it normally him asking you at the last minute?"
dating_advice,ffphbau,t1_ffp4ybp,1580095033.0,"Just want to throw in there is a big difference between ""dating for three months"" and ""going on three **total** dates over a three month period"". OP stated it was the latter. When someone says ""dating for three months"", the implication is they have been going on dates routinely and been fairly entangled in each other's lives for three months. When someone says they have been on three total dates over three months, that is a way different picture.

From OP's comment's she isn't differentiating between hanging out and dates. So it isn't like she is saying ""we've been on three dates but we've hung out 15 times"", they've legitimately only seen each other three times in three months.

The core problem here is communication, or specifically the lack of communication between them. We don't really know enough details here. Did they have a single date three months ago, let things lapse for a bit, then just have two dates back to back? Have they've only had a single date per month? Has OP been busy when he asked to hang out and has he maybe taken that as her not being interested? Is he only asking her to hang out once a month because he only thinks about her once he is bored and has nothing else to do?

Stripping away all the nuances of the situation and focusing on the bare facts

1. They've only hung out three times total over a three month period.
2. They have never talked about exclusivity or anything near that topic.
3. They don't talk on the phone and only communicate through text.

I totally get OP's perspective and understand the hurt involved, BUT  I don't think the situation is black and white enough for either party to make the assumption of exclusivity. Three months of going on weekly or bi-weekly dates? Sure, an expectation of exclusivity would be completely reasonable. Doing more ""intimate"" things like meeting his family, etc, then yes exclusivity can be reasonable assumed. 

He definitely didn't handle the tinder thing well, but honestly that is a super awkward situation. It would be awkward if it was the second date. Honestly it would be kind of awkward even on the first date, especially if you didn't meet the other person through an online dating site. 

In summary, he may very well be a dick in general, but I don't think him using tinder still makes him a dick or makes him an unsuitable future partner. Three dates total with an average of one per month is not a clear indicator of exclusivity."

Pretty much everyone just wore earbuds as it was more inconspicuous and we knew that the boss was a hothead control freak who was prone to making shitty changes at the drop of a hat. So basically no one wanted him to be in a bad mood, see headphones, then come up with the idea to ban them.

One day one of the more clueless workers (he was smart but lacked social tact or understanding of nuance) came in with these friggin massive audiophile over the head headphones. They required a special amplifier (might be the wrong word) box to power them and they were overall just huge. Someone begged him not to use them as it would get headphones banned almost certainly.

nottheonion,ff5at2n,t1_ff55wkg,1579585533.0,"It just seems like everyone in the upper echelon of the democratic party is hellbent on not having Bernie as their main candidate. Same shit happened last election. They treat him like a crazy old senile man or something. The other candidates crap on him. Strange uncharacteristic allegations made against him and heavily pushed by democratic leaning media stations (The whole Elizabeth Warren sexism allegation followed by hyper focusing on Warren not shaking his hand and being furious at him for calling her a liar (defending himself)).

Every election each party seems to have a candidate that they treat like a leper. Bernie seems (once again) to be that candidate sadly. 

We may vote in the primaries but at the end of the day each party still controls who gets chosen indirectly. We've got several months of news stations subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) pushing forward certain candidates while trying to push aside certain ones. The candidates who refuse to be pushed aside get hit with drama, not invited to key debates, or simply don't get talked about on the news.

I work with people 22-60 years old. Wide range of political leanings. Some 40-50 year old coworkers were talking about the democratic primaries and what candidates they liked. I try to avoid politic conversations in general but after like 5-10 minutes no one had brought up bernie. So I asked, ""What do you guys think of Bernie?"" 

""The kooky guy who doesn't think women should be president? He seems like he is living in a fantasy land and doesn't understand economics at all. I just get bad vibes from him, like he is just going to be a left version of Trump.""

Sorry for the long ass comment. I just remember being shocked when I visited my parent's and watched an hour long special on the democratic candidates on a left leaning channel. On the internet it seemed like Bernie was doing really well but he is not being treated kindly at all on cable TV (which is unfortunately where a LOT of the voting population gets their information from still).

harrypotter,ff1tqw3,t1_ff1qng4,1579485986.0,"Its not THAT bad. It was never written to be a novel. It was written to be a play on a stage, and it is a pretty good play. The book is simply the script. People get upset about its existence because

1. People had already invested like a decade of time into their own personal ""headcanons"", fan fictions, etc. People were going to hate it no matter what as it would never match what they had made up as their headcanon.
2. It is extremely dumbed down compared to every other book. This is because it was designed to be a play and had a limited amount of set pieces. Instead of long explanations or conversations things had to be shortened and more concise. Plot has to move along quick.
3. Its hard to be emotionally invested in the main characters as there is no build up. It works when you see it live but doesn't work when you simply read the script/book. The plot is relatively shallow due to it being the length of a single movie instead of a long arcing plot over many books.

A lot of people say that they should just have not released the book and kept it as a play. The problem is people were scrambling for a book release of the script the second it was announced. People lined up for it, begged for it, etc. So it was either just let everyone ""pirate"" the script or release it officially as a book. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

What offends people about the story is very different depending on the person. Some are abhorred that Voldemort had gotten someone pregnant before dying, some don't really see a problem with that. Some don't like Harry's personality/character in it, some don't mind it. Some hate the two main kids, some like them. 

Ultimately I think people just got their hopes up. I remember there being a lot of hope that the book would actually be a... book. That Rowling would take the script from the play and build on it to make it an actual novel. That spiraled into not caring about the new main characters, not liking decisions made about certain characters like Voldemort, etc. I still maintain that if Rowling had taken time to flesh out the basic story and make it a real novel it would have been better accepted.

Since you asked, **TL;DR; Plot :** Harry and Draco's kids get tricked into going back in time by Voldemort's secret daughter (from Bellatrix) in order to prevent Voldemort's death. Harry and company figure things out via clues left by the boys (like writing a note in the past) and help prevent it."

aww,feprw1c,t1_fepm8gv,1579329180.0,"We (parents and myself) took my sister's cat when she moved somewhere that had a no pet rule. She has three kids. My previous cat passed away but she was super cuddly and chill, this cat had the reputation of basically being a ghost and always out of sight. So while I was jazzed to get a cat I was a little bummed out to be honest, I was so used to having a cat that would sit next to me on the couch and stuff.

After the normal ""breaking in"" period where she was getting used to her new home, she became very affectionate. She is still a bit skittish (always has been), but she will go crazy with joy if you start petting her and essentially force you to keep petting her by shoving her face under your hand and lifting it up.

She's relegated to the lower level of the house in order to keep certain areas cat hair free. Whenever my mom, dad, or myself walk to her area she will be waiting happily. If one of my nieces or nephew come over she will just hide. It is pretty amazing that she can tell who someone is by their footsteps. It might be the smell like you said though, or maybe a combo.

She's fine with my older niece who is 10, but the 6 year old niece and 4 year old nephew are no goes. The 10 year old is not hyper or anything like that, so the cat likes her. She understands how to not making sudden or loud movements.

The 6 and 4 year olds though... They cannot be chill. The 6 year old is super into gymnastics and stuff like that so she is always thumping around and bouncing off the walls. If she sees the cat she or my nephew will just get super excited and sprint full speed -\_-, causing the cat to flee in terror. 

In the end I think that younger kids simply don't understand how to interact with skittish animals well. Younger kids (2-3) usually pet way too hard and even if they aren't petting too rough they do it in places the cat or dog hates. They are super erratic, use quick movements and have bundles of energy. All things skittish animals hate. Sorry for the loooong comment that was basically pointless.

Maybe 20 years ago or even 15 I'd say if there truly was a girl basketball player who could do great in the NBA they would not have hired her. Times have changed though.

I think we will see a girl in the NFL long before the NBA. There are many positions in football and you don't need to be a 300+ pound monster to do them all. I think kicker would have the lowest barrier to entry for a woman. The other option would be QB, a position that has significantly less physical mass requirements than being on the line. 

In 2013 the first woman ever to tryout for the NFL happened but sadly it was basically just a publicity stunt on her end. It at least showed that at least some teams have an open mind. Business wise it could be pretty damn big to be the team to have the first woman player as well.

When you are the **direct** cause of 11 deaths and 89 serious injuries while doing something illegal, intent becomes less relevant.  Beyond that, the case is more nuanced. The wiki goes into it but if you read through the actual court documents or articles talking about the case it is not as cut and dry as it seems.

There was evidence that he was not actually trying to commit suicide. His intent may not have been to kill 11 people and causing millions in damages, but it happened regardless. Any adult should know that placing your car in front of a train can and will have dangerous results. Investigations led to the conclusion (with enough evidence to convince the jury and prosecutors) that it was essentially an attempt to win his ex-wife back. 

Another point made by prosecution was that had it been truly just about suicide then why the car on the tracks? Why not lay down on the tracks or jump in front of the train? Why not utilize a method that wouldn't cause potential injury to others?

Unfortunately people commit suicide daily. Typically it is done in a fashion that does not injure or kill others. If he truly was trying to commit suicide then he picked a method that had a very high chance of hurting others (and it did). The suicides that do involve hurting others are typically due to someone going completely off the walls and committing acts of mass violence.

Anyways, a lot of the court case was focused on whether suicide was his actual motive beyond reasonable doubt. There was enough evidence to show that he was in his ""right mind"" in the sense that he could still rationalize his actions and their possibility to harm others. At the end of the day he killed 11 people and injured 89. Some of which are permanently disabled. Many of which have physical scars and reminders. Most likely all of which are mentally traumatized from the event.

Had that extra evidence not existed he may have got a much lighter sentence and the chargers reduced to things like involuntary manslaughter. But it was a long court case that ended up being a lot more nuanced then the title implies."

AmItheAsshole,fe0dlmx,t1_fe07l97,1578810953.0,"I can shed some light on this (partially), I was in a wheel chair and then crutches for over a year. The disability probably is not the biggest factor. Some people, disability or not, simply cannot handle any joking, teasing, etc. Some people are completely comfortable with themselves and can laugh at their own expense. Just for comparison sake, lets say someone is horrible at cooking. They burn the food every time or it is barely edible. Some people would get extremely mad if anyone ribbed them for it. Some would make jokes about themselves and how bad they are, laughing along with the person who ribbed them over it.

This is where many people stumble and make an ass of themselves. They do not read the room and think that when someone appears angry at their teasing that they should tease more until they get a positive response. They don't ""read the room"". In this case OP's MIL on the surface thinks it is funny. She could be just being polite of course.

The disability part does make it a little more nuanced. I was in an accident that fudged up my legs pretty bad. Two years of physical therapy to get fully back to 100% . I ended up setting back progress while slipping on ice and all-in-all I was in a wheelchair and then crutches for a bit over a year.

At first I was really appreciative of people in public going out of their way to help in certain things. it did not take very long for that to get old though. I always appreciated random acts of kindness (holding the door, offering to help me put my bags in the car, etc), that wasn't the problem. The problem is EVERYONE treats you different. Looks of pity were common on most people I saw look at me. Everyone treats you delicately, not just physically. They tip toe around words. It is really hard to express in words but basically you are treated like a delicate child in every sense of the manner by strangers and friends/family alike.

I remember about 4 months on in the wheelchair I was in a pretty bad funk mentally and desperate to progress to being able to walk unassisted. I felt like I was going to be stuck in that chair forever. I met a friend for lunch and the first thing she does is chuckle and say, ""You lazy ass, you aren't even going to stand up and open the door for me?"" I laughed for the first time in months. It was super refreshing to finally have someone not walking on eggshells around me. It prompted me to start making jokes about my situation and turn it from something traumatic to something more ""lighthearted"". It may seem like just a small interaction but I sincerely attribute that single bad joke to being what reenergized me and brought me out of my depression.

But not everyone is like me (or apparently OP's MIL). I have friends who would cry if you ever even lightly ribbed them about something they are self-conscious about. I have friends who have no problem being the butt of a light hearted joke. That personality trait is far more important than the disability. I will say that from my experience and from the people I know who are disabled in some manner, it can be a breath of fresh air to not have someone tiptoe around their disability. It can be refreshing to simply just be treated like a normal person and not some fragile egg-shell.

TwoXChromosomes,fe0bc7o,t1_fe096fw,1578808576.0,"Basically this. There are a lot of weird things in fashion/clothing that are purely tradition based (like fake pockets instead of putting a real pocket in, some style pants wouldn't work due to how form fitting they are, but plenty of pants are not super form fitting and would be fine with pockets). But, girl shirts are definitely made differently than men's. They taper different, have smaller average shoulder width, etc. Most space is put in the bust area while the stomach area tends to be slimmer on the shirt. 

The problem is there are an astronomical amount of body type possibilities. For men it isn't as big of a deal, the high majority of the population can make a small, medium, or large shirt work just fine. Tall skinny dudes or short larger dudes can run into issues with the length of the shirt compared to the width, but overall those three sizes fit most men.

For women though, the addition of another variable complicates everything. That variable of course being breast size. Breast size is mostly determined by genetics, with weight playing a lessor role. A short woman could have a tiny waist but still have large breasts. A taller woman could have a larger waist with smaller breasts. There are so many combinations it is insane.

Basic t-shirts are made with breasts in mind, they stretch as needed. Button ups are much trickier though. The designer has to commit to a specific breast size (typically this would be the average size for the size shirt being sold). Button-up shirts can only stretch so much. You could design a shirt for a slimmer waisted woman with larger breasts no problem, but that same shirt would look ridiculous on a woman with smaller breasts. It would be loose and baggy in the chest area.

In the past it wasn't an issue. You had clothes tailored to your specific body. People still do this nowadays but it tends to be reserved for people with sewing experience or wealthier people. As everything became commercialized it became hard for the non-upper class individuals who didn't have average body types to find clothes that actually fit 100% properly. 

The internet has solved a lot of it though. You can find basically any bra, shirt, pants, etc size you need online without paying extra. Get your proportions measured (either a friend, family member, or at a store) and use that info to buy clothes that were specifically designed to fit you. The other thing that is nice is that there are a TON of actual brick&mortar stores now that cater to the sizes that the average clothing store doesn't. We live in a time where someone with big breasts no longer has to settle for ugly beige ""grandma"" bras."
AmItheAsshole,fdzxwmk,t1_fdzuvku,1578798501.0,"I'd love if the taxis would decide to operate outside the largest city in my state. I'm 30 minutes from downtown center and it would cost over $200 to get a 7 minute ride home from the bar by an actual taxi. 

I'm guessing you live in a city. Rural and suburban areas do not typically have access to Taxis, and if Taxis are an ""option"" it usually means you are paying massive fees for the cabbie to drive 15-30 minutes from the city. That is if the taxi HQ receptionist can even convince a cabbie to drive out there.

So much of the USA is not cities. Population wise, yes most people live in a city center. But I would not be surprised if only 1% of the US had actual taxi service. I have no skin in the game regarding Uber/Lyft/etc encroaching on city cab drivers, but I do know that they have played a large role in providing transportation to people living in rural and suburban areas that previously had no access to on-demand transportation."
AmItheAsshole,fdzxi9b,t1_fdyyapk,1578798203.0,"I was reading through this thread and felt like I was in a twilight zone episode. ""Taxis are everywhere, in more places than Uber!"" Huh? Then I remembered this is a worldwide website and that most people live in cities in terms of population %. Or like the guy you replied to who lives in the UK which is an island in which you could taxi, bus, train, etc anywhere without issue.

Uber/Lyft/whatever have been huge boons for rural and surburban USA. Taxis are simply not a thing outside of cities in a lot of the US. Definitely not in rural areas. I'm 30 minutes from the major city in my state. If I wanted a taxi service to come to a bar I was at, then drive me 5 miles home (like a 6-7 minute drive), it would cost $200-$250. You have to pay for them to come from the city, pay a rate that is designed for city travel not long mileage interstate/highway travel, and then pay a fee for them to get back home.

90% of my state or more (in terms of landarea) has no taxi service or the price would be so high that it isn't a real option. I'm not even in a place like Wyoming either, it is a relatively populated Midwest state. 

Even in the least populated areas of the state you can typically find a Lyft/Uber/whatever ride (outside of some weird time of day like 4am). The prices more realistic based on how driving works outside the city (longer miles but shorter time due to less traffic and higher speed limits). Need a ride to my house from the bar but it is 7 miles away? Maybe $25 at most. So many local people just part time drive for the apps and do it opportunistically if they get a hit that someone needs a ride. Plenty of people that live next to bars will make bank by just driving midnight-2am around bar close."
AmItheAsshole,fdzwplj,t1_fdzi95d,1578797634.0,"I live in the Midwest and it isn't even super rural boonie midwest where there is only cornfields for 100 miles. I'm 30 minutes from the major city in my state. The city has taxis but once you are a few miles out taxis quickly fall off. There has technically been a taxi service in my county (it is the county next over from the city county), but it is incredibly small. Talking about like maybe 25 cabs for a 581 mile square area. 

Everything is interstate, highways, and country roads. The singular taxi service that served the county was a monopoly and a scam. Since everything is so spread out there was no ""catching a cab"". You called one and obviously paid for the distance it took for the cab to come to you. A 10 minute drive may easily be 10 miles here. So when they are charging $15-20 a mile you are already hitting $100 before the cabbie even gets to you. Then you pay for the miles it takes to get you home, then finally they add on a fee based on the miles back to the taxi HQ. So even if the cabbie only had to drive 5 minutes to the bar you were at, then another 10 minutes to your house, you are now talking about maybe $200. Basically taxis were never used, hence why they only had 25 cars for such a giant area. When you went out you either brought a Designated Driver or made plans to get picked up by a friend, family member, etc. 

Uber-like apps have made getting home from the bar actually reasonable in these suburban/rural areas. I'll gladly pay $25 for some local driver to take me home 10 minutes away in a safe manner. Drunk driving arrests has gone down in the past 5-10 years substantially in the area, as so many jackasses would not want to pre-plan and then just chance it because getting a taxi was either too expensive or legitimately not an option.

I realize a lot of y'all live in cities and stuff where taxis are all over, but in terms of land area taxis are definitely not ""everywhere Uber is"". Uber-like apps have enabled even the more rural area people to have on-demand transport. Over the summer I was in an extremely rural area people go to get away from the city. The kind of place where there are no department stores and few chain restaurants, if any. My friends and I were able to actually get a Lyft ride in an unincorporated town."

1. The pilot was able to let ATC immediately know what happened (IE a fire started in the cockpit or something). They also figured there would be video of the plane coming down from random civillians on the ground, so trying to imply a Drone or jet was in the area would be easily debunkable.
2. They unintentionally shot down the craft due to high tensions in Iran right now. High tension and anxiety can lead to extremely bad decisions from people operating weapons.

They make an insane amount of money off that and have no need to artificially act sketchy and try to withhold winnings. They take a 10% cut of entry fees, so if 5 million was entered into a single contest they would skim off 500,000 for themselves and put 4.5 million towards the prizes. Anyone caught breaking the rules (like these people) would be removed from the leaderboard and the remaining people would get shifted up."
fantasyfootball,fdg24tm,t1_fdg0v7x,1578377218.0,"Yeah I am reading through these comments and can only imagine half these people have no idea how any of these sites work or at minimum have not ever been on one.

Most the contests are capped, many with 1-3 entries per account only. Some have caps of 10 or 20, and some have much larger caps (typically contests with room for 100,000+ entries which are typically reserved for huge sports events).

When you are talking about 8-12 different matchups for a contest, even 150 lineups (or 298 like in this case) wouldn't guarantee shit. Even in sports with less dudes on the field/court like basketball you are still talking about a huge player pool. There is always an X factor where a player could get injured early in the game, or simply have a bad game. 

They got lucky in winning the big prize. Plenty of people do the same thing (minus colluding with a second person) and submit 150 entries for these massive contests and end up either not even making them money back or simply breaking even. 

As a side note, even if people do this it really doesn't make that big of a difference to your individual chance of success or failure. You are still playing against 100,000+ people. There are definitely a ton of overlapping lineups but realistically you are probably seeing 10,000+ different lineups entered into the contest anyways."

1. He straight up said he knew it was going to happen (this was in an interview after all the reports came out about the melting car and such)

2. He straight up designed a solar furnace for China. It’s made with the exact same shape and principals. He knew what a solar furnace was, made an actual solar furnace, then decided to use that same shape/design/concept and make two large buildings with it.

Even if we give him the benefit of doubt and assume he thought he modified the solar furnace design enough to make the buildings safe, he said he knew that it would create dangerous rays/heat. His justification for why he still used the design (at least for the London one) was that the weather in London was not sunny. He said that global warming has caused the issue and that it would have been impossible to predict how much global warming would change the weather in London in the couple years since he built it."

harrypotter,fdd43d6,t1_fdbdcer,1578293946.0,"I know a lot of people will do some mental gymastics to try to argue against OP's point and your points, but the reality is JK Rowling was not an experienced writer when she started HP series. There is very clear growth in her nuance, story-telling, etc between each of the books, especially if you compare #1 to the later ones. 

At the beginning of the series she fully intended Syltherin to be 100% evil in every regard. IIRC Hagrid even mentions this in book one, which is why Harry begs the Sorting Hat to not put him there. You have Snape being the red herring villian. Every named Slytherin student is a bully and/or death eater (There is apparently 1 singular current student that was named in the series but was not shown doing anything bad. She was also only brought up once or twice though). 

Then in Chamber of Secrets we learn all about how the house founder was the proto-racist of the wizarding world, quit his post because the other three house leaders refused to enact his racist agenda, and legit left an immortal deadly monster under the castle to murder non-pureblooded wizards countless years in the future. In Goblet of Fire we learn that all those named Slytherin students that bully everyone, well yeah their parents are all death eaters. I might be wrong but I am pretty sure all the actual death eaters were in Slytherin as well, there were no Hufflepuff death eaters.

Towards the end she seems to regret writing the house so one dimensionally evil. She gives Slughorn a minor redemption arc (or at least expands on his history to paint him in a better light), gives some details on Sirius's brother's redemption arc, and goes half-way in not making ALL of Slytherin house evil in the final battle. Instead of finally putting her foot down and giving some of the students a REAL redemption chance, she simply has the Slytherin students bail the battle instead. Malfoy gets a wishy washy redemption that is ruined by making him flop sides 10 times during the battle (IIRC Ron even calls him out for it). Malfoy's parents flip sides at the last second once everything goes to hell and are sitting there worried that they will be arrested when the dust settles.

Once Deathly Hallows was released I think she finally looked back and thought, ""Damn I wish I would have changed some of that in hindsight"". Cursed Child (canon, whether we want it to be or not) makes a huge point to paint Slytherin is a positive light. Pottermore has a lot of stuff that was designed to paint Slytherin in a better light.

Its the main thing that frustrates me about the series. It is unfortunate that the Cursed Child was so poorly received because it actually did well in painting Slytherin in a better light. Everyone just wants to forget that book even exists though."

I have a prescription that is a scheduled drug, the kind that police would hassle you over if they found it on you. My doctor luckily recommended at the beginning that I always carry proof that it is mine legally. I just peeled the sticky label off one of my older pill bottles and attached it to a defunct rewards card I didn't need anymore. I keep that in my wallet at all times. A receipt from the pharmacy would also work, basically anything that at least backs up your case enough that the police won't bother wasting time on you. Occasionally I'll update it with a more recently dated label.If I have to carry larger quantities with me (on vacation or something), I'll also bring the actual bottle.

I strongly recommend anyone with prescriptions considered to be abusable to do the same. As your story shows, lifelong repercussions can occur even though it eventually gets sorted out legally. The sad truth is police are so tuned to assuming everyone is lying that no amount of pleaing that they are yours legally will do anything.

funny,fd75b93,t1_fd6zvkr,1578199620.0,"I did a metric ton of research on the topic (ex was on birth control and condoms hurt down there for her (couldn't even use 99% of lubes)). I know a lot of people just yolo it and finish inside, putting full faith in the pill, but I had heard too many horror stories. So I wanted to know if pre-cum contained viable sperm. If someone has contradicting research feel free to link it and correct me, I'm down to learn new things. But basically this was the summary of what I found.

* Pre-cum does not in itself have viable sperm in it.\*
* \* The caveat is that your urethra can have sperm chilling in it. This happens after you ejaculate. If you urinate you will flush out the sperm and kill any potential stragglers (the act of urinating basically flushes 99.9999% of the sperm out though). 
* If you have not urinated after ejaculating last, there can be enough sperm chilling in your urethra to impregnate a woman via pre-cum alone.
* The following are the most common ways women get pregnant when only the pull-out method is used.

1. Pre-cum that picks up the lingering sperm in the urethra like I described above (negatable by urinating).
2. The guy misjudges his timing on ejaculation and finishes inside on accident.
3. The guy ejaculates externally but sperm makes its way into the vagina (rare but possible, especially if the guy finishes directly near the outside of the vagina)

The largest % was related to #2, misjudging when a guy is about to cum and failing to remove himself in time. Just like with every topic in the universe, there are always freak outlier cases. I'm sure some dude out there has a condition where his pre-cum is naturally filled with viable semen due to a faulty valve that causes sperm to leak out, or something strange like that."

We realize that while it may initially feel great to tell your asshole aunt to go to hell, the fallout from that single sentence will last potentially the rest of your life. That confronting your friend's plethora of seemingly fake allergies would maybe get them to stop lying, but it could also blow up in your face and make you look like a dick to everyone around you.

It is that no one in that division would want to trade for Foles. The problem is Foles has an absolutely fucking bonkers salary that is only going to increase in the coming years. By taking on Foles they would basically be freeing up like 20% of the Jag's annual salary cap and then taking on that massive salary cap burden themselves.

Realistically they can't even give Foles away. It'd be one thing if he just had an amazing year but he had an atrocious year (at least for the games he played). A team would have be super desperate for a starting QB to trade for Foles. If his salary/contract was like 50% of what it is, then yeah they would have better luck trading him.

fantasyfootball,fd08ye1,t1_fd02nf9,1578115404.0,"Sorry dude but I watched 90% of the Jags games (had Fournette and Chark on my fantasy team and it was always enjoyable to watch Minshew play with them), Minshew has every quality a team could hope for regarding a rookie QB. His flaws are mostly just related to lack of experience and polish. He's going to QB academy this off-season to work on the trainable aspects of being a quarterback.

Minshew has all the ""soft skills"" that cannot be taught. He's agile, willing to move around, willing to run if needed, etc. But the most important part is he is brimming with personality and eletricity. The fans go bonkers over him. The players seem to love him and react positively to him being on the field. Go watch week 13's Tampa vs Jag game. Foles played the first half and Minshew played the second half. It is the perfect example of everything I'm saying. When Minshew came out the second half it was like a switch had been flipped for both the jags offense and defense. Tampa suddenly was held to no more touchdowns. The Jags actually scored. The Jags actually repeatedly got to the redzone. 

Teams dream of having a rookie QB that immediately generates a massive fanbase both inside the team's existing fans and even people that aren't even Jags fans. A QB that energizes the players on the team and who actually acts like a leader. A guy that actually looks like he wants to be there and is putting 100% into it."
fantasyfootball,fd07xn3,t1_fczf78p,1578114972.0,"He just doesn't seem to fit with Jaguars, I think that is the biggest problem. Jags fans want a QB with personality. A QB that actually looks like he is trying. 2019 Nick Foles seemed to be essentially a quiet lethargic dude with no on field personality. I seriously wonder if he was still not fully recovered when they brought him back in because he looked absolutely terrible.

Week 13 was very telling (Jags vs Tampa Bay). It was the perfect example of Minshew vs Foles. Foles started the first half, Minshew started the second. Many times people mistake a QB sucking but in reality it is their o-line that is sucking. It can be hard to differentiate the two sometimes. This was not really the case though for Foles in week 13.

It was like Foles decided to roleplay as C3PO from star wars. Stiff movements, slow as hell, barely able to move, etc. He seriously looked like a stiff robot. He'd get the snap and just stand still scanning the field. A few seconds later guys would break through and Foles would be standing in the same spot. The guys would get closer and closer and Foles simply stay rooted to the ground. Then he'd get sacked without ever having moved or even attempting to throw the ball. 

Tampa had their best defensive game that week of the season. 5 sacks, 2 int, 2 fumble rec, and a defensive TD. 3 of those sacks were on Foles, 1 int, both fumbles were his fumbles, and the defensive TD was from his fumble. Foles had no TDs and 93 passing yards. Whenever the Jags got the ball the jags fans in the stadium would boo the shit out of Foles after the first fumble. They were livid after the second. Chants of Minshew peppered the whole second quarter. As Foles went to the locker room at halftime the whole stadium was roaring with boos and people were throwing cups onto the field as he walked by.

Minshew came in the second half to monstrous fanfare. The game quickly shifted in pace and Tampa bay obtained no more TD. Jags were hitting the redzone actually and did score a TD. It was extremely clear that had Minshew started the Jags could have had a real chance to win that week. He played a respectable second half with 147 passing yards, 1 int, and a td. The important thing is that even the players were more energized. 

A QB doesn't HAVE to be electric and charismatic. But if they aren't those things then they better damn be absolutely amazing. Whatever the case, Foles was not any of those things in 2019. I really think he was still injured in some capacity or maybe he just didn't give a shit after getting his payday. He seems like a good dude though so I would like to imagine that wasn't the reason. The Jags players and fans need someone with energy, someone who will actually move around the field and be willing to run if needed, someone who actually looks like they want to be there.

Sorry for the long essay comment, this topic just fascinates me. I wish nothing but the best for Foles (honestly even if he just stays benched, dude is rich as hell and has a super bowl ring), but unless something changes he just doesn't seem to mesh with the current Jag's team."
