2007scape,fg3c4f0,t1_fg26eww,1580477555.0,"Practically speaking it would wind up being different. In WoW, NPCs could have status effects applied to them, but it didn't matter because they couldn't take damage. The problem was Corrupted Blood was a status effect which did something other than just damage you. Furthermore, the only reason it even escaped the boss chamber is because player pets could get status effects, be dismissed to pause progress of the effect, then be called back to infect a busy area.

In RS, NPCs operate fundamentally differently. Attackable ones are sort of like players, but the code is different in a variety of ways. For instance, it is impossible for an NPC to run. NPCs like shopkeepers and bankers, on the other hand, are literally just interactable objects. There's no functional difference between a banker and an iron ore, they just do different things when you click on them. So you wouldn't get carriers in major cities infecting low-level players, and wouldn't be able to use pets to spread the disease. Futher, the existence of Ornate Pools which instantly clear all status effects, and the Clan Wars portal which just resets the character entirely, means that removing the disease would be trivial even for low-level players.
