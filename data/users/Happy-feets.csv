AskNYC,fedk6tu,t3_eog459,1579013583.0,"And dude, since you're a Cultural Raccoon, consider visiting the New York City Ballet maybe 12 blocks away from your hotel. Spring Season is on and they showcase the work of George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, two giants of 20th century ballet and quintessential New Yorkers. They have cheap tickets if you're under 30. And I think Lincoln Center is worth a visit"
AskNYC,fedjkds,t3_eog459,1579013144.0,"Depends on what kind of musical you like. If you like an overblown spectacle try Moulin Rouge. If you want a rock musical try Jagged Little Pill. If you want to laugh your rear off go to the Book of Mormon. And then there's always Hamilton. Since you're staying in Times Square anyway, try lining up at the theater box office of the show you want to see at like 6-7 AM, you can get rush tickets which are way cheap. Otherwise the TKTS booth in Times Square has good deals. Also download  TodayTix app to your phone. The seats may not be great but you can get deals to other stuff as well as shows. And look at a ride on the Circle Line Cruise or ride out to Staten Island on the Ferry. My guests love these. Have a great week and Happy Birthday!"
