microgrowery,fffid5f,t1_ffffrqa,1579884607.0,"That depends on your way of growing and the soil you use. I like peat moss that has very little nutrient value in it (specifically NPK) so it is easier to monitor what ends up in the plant during flowering. For my next grow I want to mix some nutrients in to reduce the work, a fortified potting soil that is too enriched for cannabis on its own, only enough to supplement the vegetative stage of growth.

Watering is basically giving them the maximum amount of water that they can absorb in two or three days and up to a day dry in between, seedlings need a few more days of water before they dry out.

I go from seed to harvest in under four months and the roots do not fill up the five gallon pots I use, three gallons would be enough. If I grew for any longer I think the three gallon pots would not be enough. Four five gallon pots (the plastic pots, I'm not sure how wide the fabric pots are) fit in the 2x4 space and if you are growing four plants the tent will be packed if harvesting in four months.

The higher estimates ($636 billion rather than $134 billion) do not appear to be feasible, that is the cost the opponents of UBI are arguing against (some are claiming higher through misunderstanding). Companies that want to raise prices without justification are prevented from doing so by the competition act. This money is intended for necessities rather than luxuries and many necessities are unlimited in nature (plenty of land to build housing on in Canada), or thrown into dumpsters behind grocery stores, or sold to foreign countries for a lower cost (utilities). We also have a capable market that produces more when demand increases, when more vehicles are sold more vehicles are manufactured.

I also think the universal part is catching a lot of people as the more feasible suggestions (the lower estimates) are recommended for around eight million Canadians rather than everyone.

The higher estimates ($636 billion rather than $134 billion) do not appear to be feasible, that is the cost the opponents of UBI are arguing against (some are claiming higher through misunderstanding). Companies that want to raise prices without justification are prevented from doing so by the competition act. This money is intended for necessities rather than luxuries and many necessities are unlimited in nature (plenty of land to build housing on in Canada), or thrown into dumpsters behind grocery stores, or sold to foreign countries for a lower cost (utilities). We also have a capable market that produces more when demand increases, when more vehicles are sold more vehicles are manufactured.

I also think the universal part is catching a lot of people as the more feasible suggestions (the lower estimates) are recommended for around eight million Canadians rather than everyone.

The Liberal Party didn't understand that which made the mess worse and now Ontario pays $12 billion to interest on debts instead of to education and health. As this problem continues there will be less for education, or we can put our foot down now. Unfortunately the Conservative party doesn't know how to handle revenue so it's the opposite approach with the same problem.
