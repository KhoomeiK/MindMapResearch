Fantasy,ffz5dsp,t1_ffyuv4h,1580364570.0,"The character's name makes way more sense in japanese. The word used is ""Kira,"" which directly translates to ""light,"" but is also a play on the English word ""killer."" It's meant to illustrate how he views himself (as a Messiah) vs. how L sees him (as a murderer).

Edit: just looked this up because I haven't seen the show in a while, and it seems I have some things mixed up in the above. While kirakira does mean ""glitter"" or ""shine,"" Kira (which is meant to be the transliteration of ""killer"") is only used by the public as a pseudonym for Light Yagami, since they don't know who he is. Interestingly, Light's name uses the characters for moon, night, and God, so there is still symbolism intended."
MagicArena,ffx6j0v,t1_ffx4zy0,1580318792.0,"My biggest problem with asynchronous drafting is there's no wheeling and there's no reverse ordering. That's a huge part of drafting and big way to control your deckbuilding as you work with your neighbors to properly signal what colors you're in.

If WotC was capable of programming bots that took what people were actually drafting into account (like draftsim does), I would have no problem with bot drafting. I know their program must have ""quality"" ratings on each card, and I know they have records of what people are drafting. If they would continuously update the quality ratings based on what people are actually drafting, we could avoid things like gates in early ravnica or the mill decks in early eldraine."

facepalm,ffptbaz,t1_ffprrq2,1580104924.0,"The thing is, comedy has so many niches and genres that it's really down to your personal preferences. I don't like many of the general ""funny"" subreddits. Though I do like some of the people that post in r/comics. 

Personally, I enjoy ""stupid"" humor, so I visit r/youtubehaiku, r/shittyreactiongifs,  /r/shittyaskscience, and r/shittymoviedetails (actually, a lot of ""shitty"" subreddits). I also like r/superbowl, mostly based on the concept. Then there's the meme subreddits for the things I like.

I don't really know what to tell you other than to find some subreddits that align with your personal comedy preferences and subscribe to them..."

nottheonion,ffpn7vr,t1_ffp9oi5,1580099315.0,"Those were basically the top of the line in 80's/90's style action movies. They were good, but most of the stuff coming out in those genres was pretty shitty. The current equivalent is super hero movies, where most of them are generic, but a few rise above the others. In twenty years, people will be saying ""Why can't we make movies like Dark Knight, Into the Spiderverse, or Guardians of the Galaxy anymore?"""
facepalm,ffpmh3p,t1_ffpl468,1580098725.0,"Very close. r/comedynecromancy is for taking bad jokes and making them better. r/comedynecrophilia is for taking bad jokes and making them **even worse.**

The names make sense when you realize that they're all plays on the idea that a bad joke is ""dead,"" while a good joke is ""alive.""

Comedy cemetery: look at all of these dead jokes

Comedy homicide: somebody took a living joke, and killed it

Comedy necromancy: let's take these dead jokes and bring them back to life

Comedy heaven: these jokes are dead, but they're in a better place, so they're kinda like being alive again.

Comedy necrophilia: let's fuck some dead jokes"

television,fddlpww,t1_fdcnxvl,1578317033.0,"It sounds more complex, but I don't know that it sounds more interesting. This sort of ambivalence on a subject (wanting to continue witchers while simultaneously understanding how fucked up his life is because of it) works in a book because we see the character's thought process. 

It's difficult to translate that to a television series without the main character coming across as wishy-washy or inconsistent. Unless you just have the character, a notable loner, explain his thoughts through some incredibly on-the-nose exposition.

I think what we got makes more sense in terms of character arc for Geralt, particularly in a television show. Learning to except the influence of destiny, despite how shitty his life has been, gives a satisfying, season long arc."
