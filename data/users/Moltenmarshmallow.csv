Horses,ffcd449,t1_ffcbt0f,1579796868.0,"I think we’re looking at different pictures....I’ve seen this horse gain some weight in what is a difficult season to do so.  Also, I know this poster  has had issues in the past but try to let it go already. Following her posts  with downvotes and cutting comments is not a kind reflection on you and the rest that do it."
