There has also been a huge drop in Chinese in the apartment complexes I live near. I assumed the trade war and Chinese anti-American propaganda may have lead to a decline in Chinese students studying here, but apparently that isn't the case.

Historically, China has never been united for long. It's because America protects the oceans, and allows for global trade that the CCP is able to hold it's power. The CCP should tread lightly if it wants to stay in power.

People think this small trade deal means China might be saved, but they are wrong. China is just stalling for time, and will not agree to the 2nd half of the deal because doing so would be financial and political suicide. Eventually Xi will close China off from the rest of the world, and use oppressive authoritarian militarism to suppress any who disagree.
