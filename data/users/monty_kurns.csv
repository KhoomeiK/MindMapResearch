I can say I see infidelity a lot but a lot more on the part of the spouses who get left behind on a deployment.

Do affairs take place on deployments? Yes, but for the majority they are just doing a job overseas and are miserable being away from their families. Add in the stress that while they are away from their families they also have to worry about their spouses and significant others sleeping around because they get lonely and sweet talked, often by other service members.

I'm saying you would, but I've seen way too many stories in this sub play out like that because 'they share such a strong bond'.

Depending on where you live (high COL vs low COL) may impact that, but if you two are splitting rent and he's paying less than half then there really should be no excuse.

You really need to have him sit down and have a real grown up conversation about this. Otherwise, you may find yourself reevaluating the relationship in the near future.

Since you're contributing to the TSP I can only assume you're a government worker so you'll have the pension and you also have a traditional TSP. Both those will be taxable incomes in retirement so you might want to think about having some retirement funds that won't be taxed when you spend them in the future. I'd focus first on building up the house down payment and once that is done, start contributing to a Roth IRA.

Since your TSP is in a Lifecycle Fund you won't need to put the IRA in a Target Date Fund. You could go all in on something like the Total Stock Market Index and consider your pension to be the equivalent of a bond allocation."

Best case scenario his funds will payout his care and living costs for the rest of his life without eating principal. With $5-6.5 million that should be doable at 4% returns assuming he already owns his house and doesn't have any real debt.

You may want to talk to a Vanguard advisor as their fees are minimal and they have a lot of good investment vehicles to pick from. If that $5 million is all in his company stock it might be better to get of that and diversify sooner rather than later. Someone mentioned the three fund strategy and that could work for your father, but I'd talk to someone before making any final decisions.

Is she saving anything as well for the down payment or is she trying to go all in on the loan payoff?

Depending on the answers to those questions should give you a better idea of what you should do. Now that you're married, her debt is now also your debt so you do have the motivation to pay it off. What are the house prices like in your area? I wouldn't recommend using the $60k to knock out the debt and only have the $10k as an emergency fund/down payment. It might be better to keep that $60k for the house, the $10k EF, and then whatever contributions you were going to make to those accounts just apply to the debts. It may take a while longer than knocking out $60k at once, but I wouldn't feel too comfortable doing that if you said your housing situation could change, even if you don't expect it to."
personalfinance,fdehykn,t3_ekitom,1578339417.0,"I agree with the people telling your to ignore the debt and keep paying as normal. Just remember, if you take the money out for the car debt you will also be taxed on it so you'll pay the remaining balance on the car plus the tax on that amount from withdrawing it from the fund.

If your interest rate on the car were a predatory rate I'd say definitely, but 2.99% is nothing. Keep doing what you're doing and you should have a decent down payment the house and the car will be gone in two years."
personalfinance,fdehhvn,t3_ekk65u,1578339129.0,"I think having the impulse to not spend money is a good one and considering your income that works to your benefit. However, I will also say it's not wrong to want to go buy a nicer TV or monitor for your PC set up. Having said that, if you really wanted it, why don't you stash some money away from your paycheck for the next few months and once you have what you need saved up you can buy it without the guilt. That way the money has a purpose so you won't have to convince yourself it's a good thing.

Don't neglect your savings because at your age it's good to have liquidity with your money, but you shouldn't deny yourself something if you have the means to buy it and your aren't doing it recklessly."
personalfinance,fdearzp,t3_ekphte,1578334943.0,"Is your masters degree going to be a terminal degree? And you said you went to school for three years so I assume those credits will count towards the undergraduate degree? If you only have one year of school to account for and if you could get your employer to pay for the last bit, or get some kind of scholarship/grant, I'd say go for it. But I think if you hold the masters you should be fine."
personalfinance,fdea736,t3_eksqby,1578334576.0,"I don't think you should be investing right now as you're not in the position to do so. I think your should build up your cash reserves as much as you can while you are still a student because school comes with a lot of short term issues you may need the money for. This could be either a savings or money market account. Once you graduate and land a decent job, then start your long term investments. You may want to take your last two years doing research so once you have a good, steady income you'll be more confident in how you allocate it."
personalfinance,fde263w,t3_ekuwjg,1578329494.0,"I think you should just take your share of the inheritance and call it a day. While you may want to give more money to your siblings, the money still belongs to your parents and they are distributing it the way they want to. An even three-way split will cut down on any drama after they pass and they think you deserve an even share. Declining it would essentially be turning down a dying wish. Also, you say you're financially independent and hope to retire early, but life can always change those plans so having your share of the inheritance invested could be a good insurance policy."

movies,fddwyml,t1_fddqoei,1578326005.0,">Reaching a billion seems to have become a more common feat in recent years, what with inflation and a larger international market.

Don't forget premium ticket sales. When Titanic and Return of the King crossed the billion mark they didn't have the benefit of IMAX, 3D, or other more expensive tickets to boost the numbers."
movies,fddwthh,t1_fdds5nq,1578325906.0,"I still don't get the criticism of TLJ saying it didn't move the story further. Kylo killed Snoke and became Supreme Leader and set ROS with the potential to make him an interesting final villain only to squander it to throw Palpatine in and force a redemption story to match Vader. Rey didn't get properly trained by Luke but made her own choice to stay on the light side of the force but without all the formality. ROS could have taken this and combined it with Kylo's story to show the galaxy had finally moved beyond the Jedi and Sith.

I'm not defending every decision in TLJ (I actually really like it but admit there are problems) but I think it set things up for an interesting finale if it was handed to somebody with some courage. Instead they went back to JJ Abrams who decided to make ROTJ 0.5 (I would say 2.0, but that implies an upgrade). I honestly believe he was only able to pull off a good Star Wars movie with TFA because he had Kasdan writing the screenplay."

This is some BS. It doesn't matter where the money came from, it was your money that you contributed. I would say you are right to want to end it, but keep in mind that could lead to difficulties regarding the house and getting the money you put into it back."
Documentaries,fd6gij6,t1_fd5rjyj,1578190650.0,"Ir doesn't instruct them not to do it either. Atheism has no code of conduct or ideology. If you want to talk human secularism, which many atheists practice, that's another discussion. But this is just about atheism in a broad sense."
Documentaries,fd6g60f,t1_fd3f4gg,1578190495.0,"Atheism doesn't equal secularism. There are atheists who practice secular humanism but it's not a universal thing. Anyone who points at Lenin, Trotsky, and Mao are right to do so since they were atheists and they did do terrible things. The discussion is about atheism, not secularism."

It actually freaks me out more as an adult despite the look of the shark. I think having a better appreciation of filmmaking let me get sucked into the movie more than as a kid.
