From what I gather ""proper technique"" has you pushing your breath from your lungs using your diaphragm to move the air, and your vocal chords to constrict and vibrate to produce sound. When done properly you feel the vibrations in your chest (hence chest voice). Chest voice sounds full and is the ""ideal""

As you improve and your range increases you are able to relax enough to ""move"" the vibration up higher into a ""mixed"" or ""head"" voice. Literally the vibration moves higher up in your body to a point where the vibrations may be in your head (head voice) and with proper support, this is the ""ideal"" for hitting higher notes.

Falsetto is the upper limit to that range on the thin edge of your vocal chords and sounds different. I *think* a lot of times beginners try to hit the higher notes their natural reaction is to move to falsetto and not actually support with their breath and mix in the chest voice which gives it that full sound.

From what I gather ""proper technique"" has you pushing your breath from your lungs using your diaphragm to move the air, and your vocal chords to constrict and vibrate to produce sound. When done properly you feel the vibrations in your chest (hence chest voice). Chest voice sounds full and is the ""ideal""

As you improve and your range increases you are able to relax enough to ""move"" the vibration up higher into a ""mixed"" or ""head"" voice. Literally the vibration moves higher up in your body to a point where the vibrations may be in your head (head voice) and with proper support, this is the ""ideal"" for hitting higher notes.

Falsetto is the upper limit to that range on the thin edge of your vocal chords and sounds different. I *think* a lot of times beginners try to hit the higher notes their natural reaction is to move to falsetto and not actually support with their breath and mix in the chest voice which gives it that full sound.

Come on, your team might make the playoffs! That will be more fun drunk! You've earned it!"" We also all know the pain and shame of giving into that voice. How great and how terrible it all feels at once when you take the first sip. 

I'm also a huge football fan and early on it was one of the hardest parts. Its unfortunate to say, but early on I removed myself from situations where the temptation may be too much (bars, tailgating, football parties etc). I can go to games now and I get to actually remember them! I also just kept looking forward. Think about how great you will feel tomorrow. Not hungover and accomplished! You can do it and IWNDWYT!"
stopdrinking,fcf5otk,t3_eh5q4k,1577626858.0,"> Getting mad at myself now. Made it from the 15th until Christmas eve 

Well that seems like a silly thing to be mad about. 9 days is a massive accomplishment, especially this time of year. 9 days where you gave your mind and body a much needed rest. There is no shame in that!

>Trying again (For good this time)  
>  
> I am here for the foreseeable future...... I hope. 

I hope too, but brother you are looking at it twisted. You seem to be upset that you haven't won the race yet and you are just looking for that finish line. There is no finish line and looking at it like that is just setting yourself up for disappointment. 

You don't want to drink anymore, but if it was as simple as flipping a switch none of us would be here. You need to look short term, little victories, find happiness in this process while you can. You went 9 days without alcohol and then 5 days with it DURING A PERIOD WHEN MOST PEOPLE ARE DRINKING! Seriously, don't beat yourself up about it. Its not helping. Focus on today and how you aren't going to drink today. That is all you own and all you can control. So.... what is your plan today? You've got at least one partner. IWNDWYT"
stopdrinking,fcf3aot,t1_fcf1iae,1577626253.0,"I was similar. I was never a problem drinker, my life was great and I was healthy and in good shape (physically, not mentally). Quitting drinking didn't change anything large, I was just no longer drinking and that felt good. I wasn't constantly berating myself for being hungover so that was a positive but at the end, seeing these milestones and progress pics felt weird to me. I felt like an imposter, like I didn't belong.

It doesn't matter though, at the end of the day we are here because we don't like how we drink and it doesn't need to be compared to others here. Its a personal process and we are all just trying to get better. I didn't start to really feel progress until I actually sought help to hit the reasons I was drinking and not just the drinking.

Anyways, don't feel like you aren't accomplishing anything. Even subscribing to this sub is an accomplishment because you are admitting something is wrong and I'm proud of you."
stopdrinking,fcf2bkx,t3_eh5cyz,1577625996.0,"Reading other people try to quit and fail, reading about people speak about their relationship with alcohol that same way I thought about it, reading other people tell us how hurt they were was (pun intended) sobering. At that point I was doing this alone. I have a wife and friends and family who I love and love me dearly, but they just didn't understand what I was going through. It hurt and I felt alone, until I came here and you wonderful people showed your souls. I didn't feel like I was *bad*  or alone anymore, just someone who needed some help.

Seeing some of those badges early on was intimidating but reading how great they felt gave me hope. These people were so far into their journey and I was afraid to even start. I didn't know how to start. I would read their success be happy for them, see their badge and think. ""100 Days?! That is nuts, I can't imagine that but I bet it feels great.""

It does."

If you review the threads at the time multiple comments said ""what do you mean he deleted it? I still see it"" I only noted that because I remember a court ruling that Trump was not allowed to delete nor block so it seemed extra sketchy to me. 

This is witness intimidation through and through, I just don't want to get on the dude for things he didn't do when there is so much he IS guilty of."

politics,fc5hqyz,t1_fc5g2gi,1577457938.0,"I'm the kind of guy that just has lots of questions, so none of this is argumentative and I loved your answer. Isn't that still just speaking to the echo chamber? If the organization is telling likely democratic voters to go vote for a candidate, how much does that move the needle since they were likely to vote anyways? 

As I have these conversations I realize a bit more it's about incremental gains and pushing .5% of voters here and .5% of voters that does add up to positive gain and maybe that mailing list does push someone who was ""likely to vote"" to ""definitely voting.""

>  It also helps keep me sane by channeling energy into something productive instead of just getting frustrated by constant awful news.

Remember, awful news sells. Things are never as bad as they seem and we are not as divided as we feel. Thanks again for the thoughtful response, have a great weekend!"

politics,fc5dq5a,t1_fc5cj6l,1577454486.0,"That's really my point. It's 2019, not 1989. If I want information on a candidate I have endless resources to get that information. At this point, if I don't know about a candidate it's willful ignorance and random people showing up on the street or at my house to teach me is going to have a NEGATIVE effect on me.

I like waiting for it to come up organically in conversation. I may reach a smaller audience but hopefully that audience is more receptive."
politics,fc5avew,t1_fc52tjr,1577451507.0,"This seems like the best place to discuss something that's plagued me a bit: I recently had multiple door knockers come to talk to me about a local election for the same candidate multiple times. I REALLY don't want people knocking on my door to tell me/sell me shit and it turned me off to the candidate (full disclosure, was never voting for the dude to begin with).

It got me looking into the efficacy of door to door campaigning and most research done says that door to door campaigning has little effect on voter turnout and even smaller effect on getting a voter to change their candidate. 

Yet everywhere I see people saying ""Bernie will win, he has the best canvassing."" So I'd love someone to tell me how canvassing for Bernie == votes for Bernie. 

This isn't trying to be combative, I actually donated to the Bernie campaign and instantly became inundated with texts from people asking me to canvass which started me wondering how truly effective it is.

Edit : after some good discussion I realized I was misinterpreting what I read and there overall point of canvassing. The study I read said canvassing will not change a voters opinion if they have decided. Canvassing is a better tool for increasing voter turnout and educating those without already formed opinions."

I've got something for ya.... He HAS been impeached. This stain on our nation has been impeached and that is never changing. There will be a separate section in future history books for him, as only the third president to be impeached.

Unfortunately he hasn't been removed yet, and now the question becomes which way does the country go... Towards corruption and letting this shit happen or does it fix the mistake?"
