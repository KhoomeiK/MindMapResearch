Battletechgame,fesicu7,t1_fepgw2v,1579365471.0,"Two UAC/20s would allow you to alternately fire them without that enormous recoil penalty. On the other hand, there's just not enough ammo for any kind of prolonged conflict. With alternate fire that's 10 turns, and the SRMs are gone at that point as well. After that it's basically an up-armored Jenner with bad evasion."

- Selected mission payout and salvage always displayed during combat

- Bonus payout for each objective indicated within objective list during combat

- Extraction point is always shown

- *Darius' Edition*: same thing as above, except green smoke wafts across the screen and a 50-60 Hz incessant hum is played at a low volume

CMT's Overlay:

- Running total of current damage to mechs during combat, along with cost to fix and repair time

- Items that have been destroyed and you do not have replacements for are indicated in red; such items that have been made available to the salvage table are indicated in yellow instead

Other tweaks:

- Called shots bring up a targeting reticle similar to the one in Phoenix Point

- Allow upgrading the Leopard (once the Argo is obtained) to drop up to six mechs at once."
