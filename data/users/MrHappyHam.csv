AskReddit,fek4eor,t3_epj100,1579192373.0,"CrossCode. It's a really fun action JRPG with fast paced combat and genuinely clever and complex puzzles that are like A Link to the Past on steroids. The setting depicts a futuristic MMO that takes place in real life by allowing players to remotely connect to bodies called avatars. It has it's own storyline within that world and the story is really gripping, and the characters are some of the most natural and loveable characters I've seen in an indie game.

The pixel graphics and animations are incredible and fun to look at; the soundtrack is great. The combat and puzzles are exciting and in a league of their own.

You can actually play a demo of the game's prologue and tutorial in-browser. I highly recommend CrossCode."
