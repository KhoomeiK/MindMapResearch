selfhosted,ff4n6ux,t1_fejjjfr,1579567689.0,"That's a fine script.  I hope it works for your purposes.

At the next level, we have apps delivered as installable artifacts, with a signed manifest of file checksums to compare against, allowing for validation after an atomic consistent update of app code, and we've had that since 1996.  If something fails, we can now perfectly vagrant up a host to test with, as we verify that what was installed that day will match the test unit the devs spark up around the world.  I've got a fleet of boxes updating via cron, too, but at this level I can check versioning remotely en masse and ensure that the versions that went to testing last week are the only ones that went to prod in AWS this week where we want to be sure the world is beating against confirmed-updated stuff.  And I can do that via onboard agents, or config management (eg ansible or puppet) or even SNMP, since the validation mechanism connects centrally into the OS and allows everything else to trivially plug in.

When one can easily validate every app file on the OS, and it's 1997 (in my case), it raises the bar.  It's easy to set up on the source end, and resources like OBS or COPR will just auto-build a new test image when github changes (it's a great time to be alive, sometimes).

Your process is certainly easy, and I guess we disagree on what kind of maintenance is adequate, which is perfectly okay at different levels.  It's been 20 years since I hand-bashed a kernel together, and even back then it was generating portable artifacts so we could confirm that what was tested was what was shipped.  One can get very used to validation and atomic updates, and really notice it when the low-cost high-value work is being missed.

But, back to Dokuwiki.  They are also occasionally shipping installable artifacts, with checksums in unsigned manifests, so they sometimes appear as if they're on a spectacular path.  At the dev level, though, they chase so many shiny things that enterprise platforms - and their free clones - aren't immediately compatible.  While they can be *made* compatible with some add-ons of variable sketchiness, the act of demanding such niche pieces quickly ups the cost in verifiable automatic update to the dependencies so the benefits of having a verifiable atomic update package cancel out.   And the reasons for that are never good beyond that simpler level."

On day two, you should be asking yourself whether it's up to date, and how you'd check, and what your update target is (i.e. how do you know it needs updating?), and how you'd patch, and how you'd *check* that patch, and how you'd deploy the same thing easily and trivially, and then how you'd check they all have the expected payload.  Two Commands does none of that.

Two commands is cool for 1995 or a ghetto homelab, but even in the latter case (The 'as above, so below' Rule) you shouldn't be evaluating something at the small scale if it's not going to be used at the large scale unless you have labour to throw away instead of working on training or allocated differently in the work/life balance.

Writing the packaging separate from the source - if one wants to go the next retorted route - is next-level labour on top of a trivial process, precisely because of the manual upstream checking.

I'm not sure the labour environment in Alberta has changed much, since, and I think it's *very* important to consider what's going on in that very toxic framework.

I completely agree that we need a labour pool that is available to a hospital - or any worksite, really - working to fill openings.  These massive penalties for Over-time or stand-by and call-in work are set to heavily push employers into properly staffing for capacity.  The penalties are to get staff rich, but to penalize sub-par staffing situations and prioritize their correction.

Again, though, companies grow their unions.  There are good arrangements, where the company and union have an acceptable amount of trust and working respect, and there are absolutely toxic ones where it's obvious that HR's first priority isn't the humans it's classed as resources.

I love how HR booked counsellors for a single day for us to spend our extended healthcare allotment if we wanted to - recap:  one day, at own cost - and unburden ourselves after we witnessed a very smart and capable member of technical staff fail to kill themselves in front of us in very graphic fashion after constant bullying from management about overtime and clock-in and clock-out time.
