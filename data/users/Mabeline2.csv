SuicideWatch,fcjphbf,t1_fcjnxlb,1577698068.0,"I didn't tbh, he was tending to other things and I knew that he would be a while. I was in shock, when things like this happen to me I just do normal things, to try and feel normal again. After trauma I've just done things like get in the bath, or watch something on TV, brush my hair, brush my teeth or just make something to eat. It just helps me cope with it i guess, I know it sounds sceptical."

SuicideWatch,fcjpbld,t1_fcjg6gg,1577697842.0,"That's what I explained to my partner, its like your body goes into panic mode, it's such a horrible feeling.
Thank you though, I hope things get better :)"

SuicideWatch,fcj0h2c,t1_fcj07s4,1577674220.0,"I would be dead tbh, I couldn't get it off I pulled so tight, I scratched my neck to shred trying to get it off, going to hard to explain to people. Apparently it takes around 7 minutes, I was in it for 3, he said he would've gone in the living room and not checked for a while but heard grunting. Thank you, I just hope no one tries it themselves it is horrible."
