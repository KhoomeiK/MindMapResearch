For taking profits, usually that’s more of a single stock thing, where you look at the chart and try to estimate what the resistance and support levels might be. For a broad ETF, I assume S&P 500, it’s the kind of thing you’d likely be best forgetting about, or adding to over time so you have $100,000 by the time you’re 30, or whatever goal seems best.
