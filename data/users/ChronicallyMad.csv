Most people don't understand how difficult it is for someone with BPD to lose those important to us. How difficult it is for us to move on. And how crippling the loneliness and social isolation that result from such a loss are."
depression,fcnaxav,t1_fcna6in,1577807686.0,"You're welcome. :) I do hope you feel better soon. And maybe you can discuss any potential hobby / project with your wife if you're having trouble deciding what to start doing. At any rate, good luck with it!"
depression,fcna0k7,t3_ei3sg1,1577807061.0,"I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with being a house husband. Society has unfair expectations of men; it says we should be the one going out and bringing home the bacon. But as long as your wife is happy with your current arrangement, and you make sure she is happy and comfortable once she gets home, then I think what you're doing is valuable.

With that said, I understand that having nothing else to do once all the chores have been done can be boring, which can aggravate your depression. Have you tried starting a hobby? I think a blog/YouTube channel are good ideas. You can also write stories, learn an instrument, learn coding, paint, etc. Feeling productive can do wonders for your mental wellbeing.

And if you really want a job, why not consider remote work / work from home? It doesn't even have to be full time work."
depression,fcn8vxl,t3_ei40qm,1577806277.0,"It's an unfortunate fact of life that some people, including parents, can have unrealistic and/or unfair expectations of their children. And it's doubly unfortunate that they don't realize how damaging it is to call their children a ""failure"" just because they didn't meet those expectations.

3 B's? I think you did great. :) And even if you got C's or D's, grades aren't always everything. There are many people who succeed in life who were B, C, D, or even F students."
depression,fcmxpqk,t1_fcj4a30,1577796823.0,"I want to add: please keep this up! I'm sure there are a lot of old friends who'd love to reconnect with you, as well as new people to meet who'll enjoy your company. :)"
depression,fcmxhn0,t1_fcmu6w0,1577796577.0,"People will see your worth even if you don't. If the girl you talked about can see it, there are others who do, as well. 

Even if it happens that she doesn't want to be your girlfriend, that doesn't mean she doesn't value you. The heart is a strange thing; there are many cases of people who seem perfect for each other ending up together and being unhappy, and cases where people who don't seem like a good match becoming extremely happy couples. And it's not an indication of worthlessness if someone doesn't want to be romantically involved with you.

Also, your depression is the one that's telling you you're worthless. It's lying to you, as it lies to everyone with depression. It's okay to acknowledge the depression, but please don't believe in what it says about you. I know at this moment that sounds hard, even impossible to do.  But with practice, you can get better at telling the lies apart from the truth."
depression,fcmu01r,t1_fcm85kz,1577792195.0,"You're welcome. :) You have value and worth, even when it doesn't always seem or feel that way."
SuicideWatch,fcmsepz,t3_ehsio5,1577789956.0,"I feel the exact same way. I want to die, I already have the means to do it. But I keep thinking about how much it will hurt my mother. My mom has always been a loner, and she's only been really close to two people: me and her brother. But her brother died some years ago, leaving only me for her to rely on. If I died, she'll be alone."
lonely,fcl8big,t3_ehqu4m,1577741987.0,Happy Birthday!! :D
lonely,fcl7a00,t3_e78orv,1577741341.0,"I have depression and borderline personality disorder, a deadly combination that makes me really, really hard to like. My best friend of 20 years very recently made it clear she wants nothing to do with me because of my anger issues.

I blocked her, and everyone else in our friendship circle, which I've been a part of also for around 20 years. Why? Because I know they all hate me now, too.

I've never felt so alone in my life. Looks like 2020 is off to a great start!!"
depression,fcl5l62,t3_ehg01s,1577740299.0,Super proud of you. Please keep this up. You're worth it. :)
depression,fcl4kzi,t3_ehqutk,1577739678.0,"If it doesn't work out, you'll get over her, I promise you. Take this from someone who's much older, and who has experienced the same devastating heartache you are experiencing now.

Right now, I know she seems like the perfect girl for you. I know you think and feel that no one will ever come into your life who is a better match for you than her. 

But this is just a lovesick heart talking. It's not true. There are others out there whom you'll love as much as they love you. Maybe you haven't met them yet. Maybe you already have. You're young. Which means you still have SO MANY opportunities to meet lots of wonderful people, and even achieve your dreams while you're at it.

I know depression makes it tougher for you to do the things you need to do to get over this. But you'll be surprised at what can change with a little effort. So go out, have fun with friends or family. Say ""yes"" to invitations to hang out. Read a few books. Watch some movies and TV shows. Play video games. Do something for the first time. Try out different things. 

Talk to someone about your problems - and not just online, but in real life, too. Being in the physical presence of another human being is extremely important, a fact that we sadly take for granted in this digital age (which is likely why there are so many depressed people today despite our increased social media ""interconnectivity""). Maybe your school counselor can help? A shrink? A teacher? A best friend? A parent?

Always try to remember that depression and anxiety aren't the real you. They're impostors trying to convince you you're someone you're not. They're wrong, of course. You aren't hopeless. You aren't too damaged to live a normal life. And you WILL find love; if it's not this girl, then someone else who is a much better match for you. Someone who'll see into your soul and say, ""he's the one I want to be with."""
