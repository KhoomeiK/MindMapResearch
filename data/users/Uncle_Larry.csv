HomeImprovement,ffbbryp,t3_esj7rf,1579758844.0,"I recently hired a contractor friend who has done all my framing and roofing projects flawlessly for the last decade.  It's been a few years since the last project and his company has grown.  Now he rarely swings a hammer, but quotes projects, lands deals, and oversees his crews to do the work.  Exactly how every good contractor business grows.

Not only have his costs skyrocketed due to work workman's comp and insurance, but they had to come back twice to redo the flashing around two skylights and the chimney.  The second time he came back with his right-hand guy and they redid the work themselves.

It was storm season in New England the house is on the ocean catching wind gusts over 100 mph sometimes.  This new project's roof line was directly facing the worst of the storms this past year.  The fucking lead flashing around the chimney still leaked.   But then again, while his prices have increased, I didn't pay him enough to hurricane-proof this project.

I waited for everything to dry, and climbed up on the roof when the wind was slack with 2 tubes of marine 5200 (look it up, takes 7 days to cure and a chainsaw to remove), 6 cans of clear Flex Seal, and a pocket full of stainless self-tapping 4 1/2"" screws with fender washers.  I sealed every shingle and flashing edge with 5200, then sprayed the entire chimney with Flex Seal, then coated every screw thread with 5200 and drove them into the corners of anything the wind could possibly catch onto.

No more fucking leaks.

He definitely has integrity and kinda made things right in the end but it really stalled the project since I was doing all the interior work.  I had to wait for another big storm after all this to see if shit was still leaking before moving forward.  No sense in putting up insulation or drywall that will just get ruined by a leak."

DebateAnAtheist,fej113x,t1_feigiuv,1579153058.0,"I grew up in a very evangelical Christian home and was born with severe allergies triggering asthma that would send me to the hospital regularly.  

There were home bible studies with the rest of the church folks that our family attended every week. At the end of the night they would ask if anyone in the group had something pressing to pray about.

Dozens of times my folks would sit 7-8 year-old me on a chair in the middle of the living room of someone else's home while the 15-20 adults in the room would ""lay hands"" on me.  They would close their eyes and pray to God to release me from this suffering and aggressively speak the name of Jesus for help whole some people spoke in tongues.

Turns out, I was just allergic to chicken which was found out by a Doctor specializing in allergies.  None of their prayers did a fucking thing besides scaring the shit out of a little kid and convincing him that whatever they were doing to try and help was absolutely useless.

I played the game going through Christian schools through the end of high school not believing a single thing I was taught about religion, but still making good grades with a smile on my face.

Once i went to college and moved out of the house for good with full independence, my facade just seemed pointless.  It was small comments at first at family gatherings that quickly turned to almost aggresive critical thinking attacks.  

My family member said one time; ""Thank God he created us in his image so we don't have the urge to commit suicide.""  Me: ""Well then why does suicide exist?  Are we not all created in God's image?  If not, why?  Does he choose people to be afflicted with mental illness?  Why would any being do that?  It makes no sense"".

I'm prerry conflicted about this stuff because code and best practices change all the time.  Maybe it would make more sense to use Tyvek on the inside as well as the outside for a concrete slab?  Maybe with the same kind of rafter vents (the foam inserts) used in the walls leading up to the soffit?  Sealed to weather and sealed to the inside with some level of venting."

We also like to do plastic sheeting over the insulation on the inside and under the wall frame sitting on the slab when building on concrete slabs.  I don't think it's required by code, but with no ventilation under the structure, you might get some ""sweat"" in the summer on the slab that creeps up the walls.

One thing you can look into is the free B2B guest access of the default Azure AD in the Parent company tenant.  It allows for external users to use their own credentials in a partner tenant.  

Think about how many apps ask if you would like to use your Facebook or Google account login instead of creating a separate account.

You can create these in bulk and there are lots of options to streamline the end user experience.

You will want to muck around in PowerShell but there is a way to convert these guest accounts to mail-enabled Users (which is what the Hybrid would do).  

You will probably want to manually set the immutableID for these accounts to match the on-premises AD objectGUID, which will then do a soft-match of the on-premises mailboxes to these accounts for your cutover.

It's messy and not ideal, but this way you have the same credentials in both tenants without AADC or VPN etc.
