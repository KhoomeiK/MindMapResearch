She made two types. One it’s just the piece of cookie dough baked as-is and two she took several pieces and mushed them together to make regular size cookie. The cookie dough is a very basic cookie dough, so it cooked fine but was on the crispy side. She took the two regular size cookies and then refroze the ice cream and made a cookie sandwich. Results: yes you can make a real cookie from the cookie dough, no it is absolutely not worth the effort. 

Not that it’s a lot of effort though. She melted the ice cream over night in the fridge and pulled out the dough. Also you can see the results in the picture. The little tiny cookies and the cookie ice cream sandwich. All there. No spoiler tag."

todayilearned,fe61fal,t1_fe40vir,1578879635.0,"When I was in the Navy I served two deployments hunting pirates off the East African coasts. From Egypt to Madagascar. After the Navy I went to college to get my degree in history and took a huge interest in the Barbary wars (military and economic history in general). So here’s what I’ve learned I’ve the past in my experience and research. 

1) rape, murder, and pillage of the worst kind were uncommon for the most part, but only because women passengers were uncommon as a percentage. When women were encountered rape wasn’t always a possibility. Pirates wanted to be feared and have their targets put up as little a fight as possible. So rumors were spread and exaggerated. 

Pirates also offered differently depending on where they were located, what their reasons for piracy were, and who their captives were. So even though rape was uncommon, when it happened it was bad. Not just “rape is bad” bad. But horrible. 

The two worst incidents that I can think of were when Muslim pirates captured a boat that contained the queen of a rival Muslim empire. Every woman was raped repeatedly and several killed themselves out of honor. Another terrible one was when pirates captured a boat with a high ranking military officer and several rich women aboard. Pirates wanted to kidnap a particular rich woman and hold her for ransom. The military officer tried to stop them and to punish him the pirates raped every woman on board and the rich woman was raped by over 20 men in front of the officer. 

2) your points are exactly right, so I’ll just be more specific. Even with modern technology boats accounts for over 90% of movement of commerce, also over 90% of all humans live close to water. Even the 10% that don’t live near water just live close to trade partners. Such as the Canadian border. So protecting fre trade over waters is very important. 

3) pirates are essentially “stateless” they don’t operate as sanctioned by a government. So it’s easy to say “let’s put our differences aside and hunt them together.” Privateers (or their equivalents) are state sanction and can either be treated as a rival military or given the exact same treatment as stateless pirates. Privateers were hired or licensed by a country to attack specific ships, usually of rival countries. 

4) you’re exactly right. In fact some pirates had strict rules against rape and murder. Murder as in “cold blooded murder” vs “kill these guys in self defense because they attacked us while we attacked them.” Odd, but they’re pirates, so morals are fluid. One pirate queen in particular had a rule that if you rape a woman you had to marry her and provide for her and any kids you create. She also had a sort of social security and retirement plan too. Other pirates had rules against certain stuff, but viewed it more as a guideline in good situations rather than a set in stone type of deal. 

Some stuff you didn’t ask about was that for most pirates it was a short term endeavor. Maybe a few years, maybe ten years, maybe just a quick voyage. Very few pirates were pirates for life. Hence why the retirement plan was a big deal. 

Pirates burying treasure was also rare. It was exaggerated and popularized in a book. Most pirates (like all most sailors) would get a bunch of money from sailing, hit a port, and spend it all or most on booze and women. When money runs out, go back to pirating. As a sailor I can attest to that. When I was young and knew everything and was going to live forever “burying treasure” in savings bonds wasn’t high on my priorities. 

The Jolly Roger was not a singular Jolly Roger. It was a standard created by the captain or crew to represent themselves and they varied widely, but usually had skulls or skeletons. There is a popular idea that a certain color meant “no prisoners” and a different color meant “surrender and no harm” but again that was uncommon. 

Here’s a fun game. Think of the most popular or famous pirates you can name. Did you think they were famous because they were good and scary? Nope. Most were popular because they were shitty pirates who got captured, tried, and killed. During trials their crimes were reported and that’s why they’re so famous. The best pirates were never caught, retired, and everything we know about them is more legacy or legends vs a written historical account. Some of them have historical accounts, but that’s because they were idolized. A good rule of thumb is the more accurate information you have  about a pirate the better the chance they were a shit pirate. 

Talk like a Pirate day should be more “talk like a guy from some East English countryside village.” The “Pirate” accent is based off of the pattern of speech of people from the Bristol Channel in England and you can thank Hollywood pirate movies for that. Pirates come from all over and will most likely have a low class accent from whatever country or area they’re from, low class since for the most part pirates were just extremely poor people with low morals looking for relatively easy money. 

I’ll end on my favorite. Walking the plank was also an uncommon punishment. Keel hauling was the go to punishment for pirates and Navies in the days of sail. Tie a man to rope that goes underneath the ship, drag the man from one side to the other, during which he will dragged underwater (obviously) but also dragged against any barnacle and smother nasty stuff stuck the the bottom of the ship. Usually if he survives he is forgiven. If he didn’t drown then the scrapes usually lead to death from blood loss, maybe hypothermia if the water is cold enough. 

Modern pirates still exist. Usually it’s men in small boats attacking soft targets hoping for a ransom. If you have a ship worth millions of dollars then in theory it should be easy to give away a couple thousand dollars here or there. Or at least that’s what most of the pirates think. As a sailor I worked closely with the Coast Guard to hunt them and do our best to disrupt their activities. But for us at least capturing pirates is a tricky legal matter, often times pirates would just dump everything overboard or try to hide it. If there was no evidence or we didn’t catch them literally red handed our options were limited. This was over ten years ago for me, I don’t know what’s changed since then for the US or how other countries operate today."

If Lucas added it when he re-released Return of the Jedi and had Palpatine have some throw away line like ""The Death Star II will have unheard of technology like hyperspace travel,"" then we as fans can go ""look there it is again.

And interfering in foreign politics is as American as Apple pie. I’m not saying he’s good because others are worse or just as bad. He, and American politics in general, are not as good as we like to romanticize. 

Lincoln suspended habeus corpus and had his fellow politicians arrested and held without trial or charges because they were going to vote against him. 

Presidents and founding fathers had slaves, some raped their slaves. Thomas Jefferson’s last words were he wished he could have killed his Vice President and another political rival. This from a man who murdered a few other people and was response for the “trail of tears.”

Obama reinstated the patriot act and was responsible for lots of civilian deaths from drone strikes.

Him and General Pershing are both considered General of the Armies, a rank higher than the established five star general and equivalent to Admiral Dewey’s Admiral of The Navies. Which is also above five star admiral. But in 1976 when Washington was promoted there was no official insignia for the position of GAS. Pershing was allowed to wear whatever he wanted because he was serving when promoted and he chose four gold stars, but this was before official establishment of five stars in normal silver color. For Dewey his rank was created in 1903 and in 194, when five star admiral was created, he was decreed to be above that rank permanently. 

The problem comes that Dewey and Washington, unlike Pershing, weren’t alive to choose their insignias. So when the insignia of six Star was officially created and adapted it was way after the fact. Washington outranks everyone because official decree states that. Basically because he’s the oldest, the first, and all the honor that goes with what he did Leading the Revolution.
