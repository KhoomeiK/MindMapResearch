TaliyahMains,ffbx8cb,t1_ffbt6g9,1579785716.0,"omg , i started going w second and doing this path and i think it's the best now!  
but throwing q on wolves for hunter's talisman extra health is actually genius i don't know why i didn't think of that i guess i'm just too stupid. thank u for this bit of info <3  
now i can start blue if i want if blue is on top side"
TaliyahMains,ffadgmq,t1_ffaak3a,1579732963.0,"thank you, although i would really like a video where someone actually uses it to see how to use it effectively"

TaliyahMains,ff8pcby,t1_ff8jzuf,1579690204.0,"Thanks this seems the most efficient way by far, i also like how u included when to use electrocute and when to use dark harvest i didn't know that ,and when u said '' 2nd i take E and do krug "" I took that as gromp because otherwise it's highly inefficient .  
but what if blue is on the top side will u start blue or just get a leash from bot for red ?"
TaliyahMains,ff8p0n5,t1_ff7wjgy,1579689722.0,"that seems like a good pathing i might alternate between this and the other pathing from u/emilsol
