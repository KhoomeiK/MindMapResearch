confessions,fgfb2cg,t3_ey6054,1580732966.0,"There are a few things I'd like to say to you, I mean no offence whatsoever.

I don't know much about alimony, but that's where they take half your money after a divorce right? Depending on your situation, yeah that's kinda shitty.

Child support is fair, and if you got the kid, she'd have to help keep them fed too.

Cheating is done by men as well, and cheaters are garbage people no matter their gender.

Circumcision is a ridiculous concept to me. It wasn't started by women and it's mainly a religious thing.

Feminism has gotten out of control. What started with women wanting equal rights has turned into a cesspit of hate. They call themselves radfems, I call them feminazis.

Abortion and birth control, I personally have no problem with and I whole-heartedly support it. Again, however this depends on the specific situation as well as religious views. But, if you don't want to be stuck paying child support for a kid you never wanted, It's best to use a condom and make sure she's on birth control too.

As for women rejecting you, I can't do anything about that. Maybe she's an asshole, maybe you weren't her type, maybe she's gay. There's an infinite list of factors that could influence a woman's willingness to date and/or copulate with you.

A 'true man' should never harm a woman, nor a fellow man, without explicit reason and your 'rise above it' mentality is incredibly refreshing. 

And finally, no, you don't need validation from women. Move past it, achieve your goals, forget every woman who ever hurt you or shamed you and remember, you're better than them, not because you are a man, but because you are a good man."
