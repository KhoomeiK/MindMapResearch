depression,fdoa0kd,t3_emaudf,1578601457.0,I fucking hate this too. I used to be someone who would talk to anyone and do everything I wanted. Now I’m a loner who has no personality or voice.
depression,fdityjr,t1_fditpld,1578450978.0,"Same. Funny how our brains shut off the second we get any sort of stress. When I’m alone playing video games or drawing, my brain is super active and when I’m anywhere else doing anything, it perpetually buffers."
depression,fdis1q5,t3_elhhgz,1578449763.0,"I feel the same way my guy. I doMy want to talk to my friends too much considering how draining social interaction is for me, but now that I feel like I’ve lost touch with them, I feel like horseshit, even though I did this to me."
depression,fdhofe7,t1_fdho9vy,1578426939.0,Thanks dude. Good luck with your work.
depression,fdhn2io,t1_fdhh0rx,1578426131.0,I used to be a top student too and extremely talkative. I can’t carry a convo at all anymore without feeling like I’m forcing myself to exceed the limits of my brain. And my marks are significantly lower than before and it sucks cause I’m applying for universities. All this just discourages me more and makes me feel like there is no point.
depression,fdhmtrq,t1_fdh823t,1578425984.0,This is exactly what I meant. I’m still in school and the environment is extremely social to the point that people like me are just left behind. My brain deteriorates as I have to deal with the issues of my friends when they never ask what’s going on with me. It’s draining. And the work is pretty draining too. I had to tell my teachers I was severely depressed to get accommodations and one of them straight up said “just because you’re sad doesn’t mean you get special help”. This further decreased my incentive to work cause now I just feel like a burden. Fuck everything.
depression,fdgdmom,t1_fdgdkba,1578391765.0,I just realized I wrote hugs instead of huge. I edited the post.
socialanxiety,fdg4hdp,t1_fdg4dje,1578379676.0,"It sucks cause I know it’s a defensive mechanism to the stress cause by social interaction, but it just makes the stress of it all worse."
