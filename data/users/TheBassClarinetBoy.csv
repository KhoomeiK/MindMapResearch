Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself"

Having my parents find out that I’ve been depressed and suicidal for years was definitely hard, but nothing that I was afraid was going to happen happened. Instead, I got medication, and had my first therapy session today. Second, set up a support network of friends. The “3AM rescue texts” I mentioned have happened more than once, when I had to emergency text someone to stop me from killing myself.
