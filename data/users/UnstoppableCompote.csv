AskEurope,fezijpn,t1_feygrsz,1579457719.0,"> It's sad.

I hate to say it, but studying something like East Asian studies is like shooting yourself in the foot. If you wanted a secure, well-paying, high education job you shouldn't have picked something like that. 

The amount of people who have that degree for such a niche field is way too high (at least here in Slovenia). On the other hand, having a technical degree, law, pharmacy, medicine, etc will basically guarantee you a job. They are quite a bit harder though and certainly not for everyone."
WatchRedditDie,feygqlk,t3_eqvfjr,1579445307.0,"From Wikipedia:

>Aisha was the daughter of Muhammad's close friend Abu Bakr. She was initially betrothed to Jubayr ibn Mut'im, a Muslim whose father, though pagan, was friendly to the Muslims. When Khawlah bint Hakim suggested that Muhammad marry Aisha after the death of Muhammad's first wife (Khadija), the previous agreement regarding marriage of Aisha with ibn Mut'im was put aside by common consent.[25]

>The majority of traditional sources state that Aisha was betrothed to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she stayed in her parents' home until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham,[30] when the marriage was consummated with Muhammad, then 53, in Medina. [31][32][33] This timeline has been challenged by a number of scholars in modern times.[34] Both Aisha and Sawda, his two wives, were given apartments adjoined to the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi mosque.[35]

>Per Sunni belief, Aisha was extremely scholarly and inquisitive. Her contribution to the spread of Muhammad's message was extraordinary, and she served the Muslim community for 44 years after his death.[36] She is also known for narrating 2210 hadith,[37] not just on matters related to Muhammad's private life, but also on topics such as marriage, sex, inheritance, pilgrimage, eschatology, among other subjects.[38] She was highly regarded for her intellect and knowledge in various fields, including poetry and medicine, which received plenty of praise by early luminaries, such as the historian Al-Zuhri and her student Urwa ibn al-Zubayr.[38]

Turns out she's suite an interesting woman.

Stuff like this happened in practically everywhere back then, the difference with certain denominations of Islam and some other religions is that it's still going on today. 

It's more about culture than religion and Islamic extremists have devolved back into the year 600. On the other side of the spectrum you have Bosnia for example, they're mostly Muslims but incredibly secular and pretty normal people."
