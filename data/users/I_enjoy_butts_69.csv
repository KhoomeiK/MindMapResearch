worldnews,fews3kl,t1_fewmeku,1579418655.0,"Its also the reason why when Trump does call *fake news* that I wonder if he might be right sometimes.

But also, me wondering if Trump really is right could also just be *his* fake news. At least thats what reddit tells me. But after a long time of using this site (I have other accounts alright? >_>) I have noticed that Reddit isnt very honest either. So at this point I dont know who the fuck to believe and I just sort by controversial so that I can see what people are *really* talking about."
aww,fepsbnu,t3_eq9wl8,1579329593.0,Damn Reddit really hates pit bulls today.
todayilearned,feltmlz,t1_fel0fcz,1579230634.0,"My aunt was a donor when she died. Her organs were not given to people in need though, they were harvested by cosmetic companies. 

Just because you're a donor doesnt mean your organs will go to save someone. They very well just may be used in products that people buy so companies can make more money. 
  

I was a donor originally but after seeing what they did to my aunt I opted right back out."

funny,fdx9vmd,t1_fdx44du,1578766756.0,Went on a T-break recently. Had a dream that I went down stairs and grabbed some whole milk from the fridge. I only realized it was a dream when I opened the fridge later and we just had 1% :(
worldnews,fduqwou,t3_en2bxz,1578737590.0,"Honestly, it sounds very believable to me that this really was an accident. Incompetence is a very real thing that can occur on any level. But what bothers me the most is that even though they admit it was an accident, they word it as if it was a small accident of spilling milk on the floor rather than an accident that caused the deaths of almost 200 innocent people. They really dont seem that sorry. ""Oh well if we weren't so pressured by the Americans we wouldn't have shot it down.""

If one country can make you so freaked out, even if it's the biggest super power in the world, that you kill 200 innocent people just to be on the safe side, Something is seriously wrong with the way you run things."
