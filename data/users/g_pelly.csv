offmychest,ffh6128,t1_ffh5kfw,1579924087.0,"With our cats, we quickly realized cat toys aren't really need.  One of our cats loves a $3 wire toy.  


Another plays with hoodie strings and hair ties.  


And the other (rest her soul) used to play with leather strips/fringes from a weird pillow my wife bought.  


They ignored the pricier toys.  


Cats are weird."
AskReddit,ffd3ahr,t3_esqst2,1579812578.0,"My wife hates over the top romantic gestures, so our love language is saying stuff like

'I love you more than stepping on Legos.'

'I love you more than having Comcast as a cable provider.'

'I love you more than scooping our cat's litter box.'

Back and forth we go.  I wouldn't have it any other way"

Yet, we're supposed to celebrate MORE people coming into this world?! Yay, any woman can take a cumshot and pump out crotch droppings.  That's not an accomplishment.  


OP, what you are doing is a labor of love.  Don't let a bunch of Karens and morons detract from your passion and making the world a better place.  You do you!"
