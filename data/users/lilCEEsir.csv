That is honestly so unfair, I can't believe people have to actually abide by that. I wonder how many victims there has been because of this.

The whole system is pretty one sided when it comes to child-support. My boyfriend pays 1000.00 a month to his ex for a 17 year old girl who works full time.... tell me things shouldn't be adjusted down the line. It would be great if the funds were properly dispensed and everything was covered, but she does not use the money on things needed at home or on her daughter. She is in all honesty, dependent and living in a trailer with her current boyfriend. Earlier on, when she was about 12, he would pay the $1000.00 but still need to purchase things like clothes & food when that's what the money was allocated for on his end. She also did not pay her school fee's for 5 years, and he had been sending money. I 100% believe that children should be supported, but I also believe it should be fair and there should be some bounds on what people are allowed to purchase with *court-ordered* child support....

My child support?  $200 bucks for a 7 year old, IF I AM LUCKY lol. Do I harass or want to go to court? No, he's down on his luck enough tbh. I would much prefer him to be an active part of our child's life."

Your husband is lying to you. There would be no reason to sneak out after you had already went to sleep if he was just having a normal outing. He literally waited until you fell asleep and left you on your birthday to go gamble away the little money get got for the chainsaw. Unfortunately, addiction knows no bounds and gambling is one of the worst ones I have ever seen. An addict is an addict, generally I can get addicted to anything I want if I am not careful. He has cheated on you in the past, this will only get worse.  An example of no respect or love is that he should've cooked you a nice dinner and took you out on your birthday. People think that love & respect are extremely complex, when often it's the small things, like making someone feel special on their birthday, trying to make their life easier, being supportive, being open and honest, those things=love & respect. It doesn't sound like he is giving you any of that. I would recommend getting out, or deeply think about it. While you are still in a sound mind, while you can. I have watched women well into their 50's stay with their addicted husbands. They have debt, fraud in their name, 2 lines of credit on their house, and a man who still goes to the casino and cheats. Being a co-dependent and enabler can become a vicious addiction and cycle, often empathetic and loving women can chosen for this part. That's 20 years of this shit and you deserve better."

If you look at most dark skinned entertainers (especially female) their skin will be much lighter now than 10 years ago and those are from those fancy face bleachers. You see WOC with large social media followings advertise skin bleaching treatments with fancy names all the time.

There may be some key points in why mine is different than the rest:


1. I come from a smaller city in Canada, if your work is bad or botched every single person will know where it came from.


2. My doctor does not do cosmetic surgery, only injectables. 

3. He has 5 practices in my country: Toronto, Edmonton, Regina, Vancouver, Saskatoon 

4. He said the bigger the city, the more shitty dr's, the more botched procedures. I have asked him about it 
myself. He has had to do so many re-works for people in Toronto, it's disgusting.


5. His clinic is where all of the very wealthy & business women get work done in my city, and they do not have this as a desired look. He wants the best clients, long term clients, not only in it for the short term fix clients."

I just want to thank this sub so much because I wanted baboon lips like a year and a half ago - mental state was pre bad - luckily my Dr. isn't. I wanted to FMSU but he was like nah, you pretty let's not have a butthole for a mouth. So here I am, with minimal filler, scrolling through this forum at least 3 times a week to remind myself that the current trend of filler is not attractive nor normal looking. Thank you guys."
