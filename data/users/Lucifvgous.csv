ambien,ff3tcbb,t3_er7s7w,1579548414.0,Someone removed a post i shared here showing a bad taxidermy. I'm not an ambien user but i love seeing people's reactions to strange things while on ambien and i wish i could continue to do that.
TheMonkeysPaw,ff3sxxg,t3_ereg3y,1579548167.0,"granted. You end up in an accident that causes you to lose both pairs of arms and legs.

Over the course of the next few months of recovery in the ER, your limbs grow back. However, they are not where they are supposed to be. You have arms for legs and legs for arms now. Scientists are left baffled. Reports of the same phenomenon are popping up left and right. The media blames you for this, and you end up being the supposed cause for unwanted limbs in the wrong areas. Everyone hates you, but now humans somehow have the ability to regenerate entire limbs. congrats."
