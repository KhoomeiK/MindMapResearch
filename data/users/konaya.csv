You're trying to say that I don't know what I'm talking about when I say that there's a greater risk of vitamin B12 deficiency with a vegan diet, *as proven* by your lousy article which apparently views finding vitamin B12 in some obscure plant as a minor sensation since it's otherwise not found in plants."

So you're seriously trying to use some blog with a potential discovery made only a few days ago to weigh in on how it is to be a vegan today?

Are you actually this stupid, or are you just a really good troll?"
TheBullWins,ffqihuv,t1_ffqgg9k,1580135532.0,"> Vitamin B12 is naturally found in animal products, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and milk products. Vitamin B12 is generally not present in plant foods, but fortified breakfast cereals are a readily available source of vitamin B12 with high bioavailability for vegetarians [5,13-15]. Some nutritional yeast products also contain vitamin B12.
