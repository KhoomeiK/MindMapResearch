depression,fe619p3,t1_fe2w65i,1578879539.0,"My friend had a handmade toy bunny her grandma made her. It began to disintegrate when she was in her teens, so her mom sewed a new bunny and they stuffed the old one inside, with some of the old fabric showing through here or there so it looks like patches. I'm sure if you go to sewing stores in your area and chat with the people who work there, you'll find that they do custom work. Good luck! Maybe in the meantime you can wrap it in a beanie or a scarf or something to hold it together? :)"
depression,fe61050,t3_enj587,1578879365.0,"My roommate works in customer support at a fancy tech company and is in his mid twenties and sleeps with two, a dino and a fox. I have a friend who is 27 (I think) and a divorced mom and still sleeps with her bunny. I have to hold something, be it cat, boyfriend, or pillow. It's okay. Even if it's not 'normal', it's what meets our needs so we can do what we need to do. Your needs and comfort are more important than being normal. Anyone who would give you crap for it doesn't deserve to give an opinion because they value normal more than they value you taking care of yourself."

It's cognitive behavioral therapy, backed by good science, and it's very easy to use."
depression,fe5zxfa,t3_eno7v3,1578878676.0,"I was mad depressed when I was a teen, and at my most religious. Moving away from religion has actually helped because I feel less shame and judgement. Usually if someone says religion/Jesus will cure me, I very bluntly say that I'm happy they're doing better, but it hurt instead of helped my last go-round and I don't feel like undertaking such a massive, risky commitment purely on the suggestion of some random person who doesn't know my internal life, thanks."

The face forms in quarters and they all migrate towards the front of your head and mush together. Have you seen those 3D ultrasounds?? Also the pelvis slowly widening and all your guts getting squished up under your diaphragm ... I know that's not the reason your abdomen isn't like a tank at the local aquarium, but it sure as hell is a nifty bonus. If you could see it, you would almost certainly never be down for it lol

Also, read ""Life's Work"" by Dr. Willie Parker. He's a Christian abortion provider.  Conception, pregnancy, and birth are definitionally not miracles because they happen all the time"

My grandmother made it through Nazi Germany, I’m not insensible to the possibilities, or the ridiculousness of some police states. Incidentally, I have checked out everything but Fight Club and have built zero bombs and hate Nazis. I didn’t know the Very Hungry Caterpillar was on a hit list but I’m not surprised, I’m off to google the scandal, prepared to have a tiny sliver of my childhood nostalgia killed off if the author was wildly racist or something ..."

MaliciousCompliance,fclh6lb,t1_fckqwc4,1577747699.0,"That fascinates me, I’ve checked out everything from nonfiction on cannibalism to teen fiction to bad romance for the lolz to sex self-help books and it never occurred to me to wonder or care who could see that information. What will they do, shame me? Hearing that it’s so protected kind of makes me feel like it does when someone hands me an unexpected gift they worked hard on.

MaliciousCompliance,fclgtj1,t1_fcix6n8,1577747457.0,"I have library cards for municipalities I don’t live in, and they know I don’t live there. Reason 1: I visit often enough for it to be worth it, I don’t like screen reading and I don’t like running out of books on vacation. Reason 2: Sometimes Town A has a book Town B doesn’t and it’s quicker and uses fewer vital library resources to pop over on the subway myself than to request an inter library loan. No one ever denied me a card because I don’t pay taxes there or anything ... I don’t know how it works.

Edit: Irrelevant, but I once had to mail back a book I took home by mistake. It wasn’t late and I never heard a peep about it."
MaliciousCompliance,fclgi9y,t3_egdckm,1577747249.0,"By all means, let’s protect random adult men accused of sexual misconduct (by a vulnerable child/young person who has nothing to gain and much to lose) from the embarrassment and inconvenience of being detained and questioned by police while we review a security tape, while the wronged child strives to overcome the trauma of what they have observed and the trauma of seeming to be totally ignored, at the risk of exacerbating the child’s distress and losing the perpetrator entirely, should the evidence suggest he is one.

JESUS. It’s not like he would have been booked or divorced or fired on the spot! Innocent before proven guilty, for sure, but must we we prove guilt before we take basic common sense safety precautions??? Due diligence??? Now I think like librarians should be mandatory reporters, like teachers, so they can’t just fudge up shady shit like this because it’s uncomfortable. 

Btw, any man I choose to keep company with would have been horrified to hear there was a flasher and happy to compliantly sit in an office and wait for tape to be reviewed, so as to 1. not throw a wrench in the vital works of pinning down the right guy and 2. assure everyone through his excellent behavior that he was definitely not that that guy."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fcleb8q,t3_ehme1v,1577745814.0,"If it isn’t helpful to think that you didn’t lose a family because you did love some of them, please remind yourself that, more importantly, you ditched a pack of ABUSERS - people who allowed a dangerous, known child sex offender around their children, not supervised, who shamed a child for reporting abuse, who believed the obviously biased adult who shamed the child, who would hold something like that against a child - UGH! Nightmare people! They don’t deserve you!!! You were incredibly brave!!! You ran, you told! You were basically your own hero when no one else could or would be!!! 

It doesn’t give you a new family ready-made, and it doesn’t take away the hurt, but that knowledge is still much more than nothing. If you can’t seek counseling or don’t want to, perhaps try the free app Woebot, which helps you fight your own painful, unhelpful thoughts by seeing them for the twisted things they are, and replace them with healthier, more accurate ones. If nothing else, when you feel down about your life or yourself, PLEASE don’t blame yourself - remind yourself that you were brave and right and that even if you don’t have a new family yet, you also don’t have a gang of horrible ghouls still hurting you. Just like you ran away and told and have kept going til now, you can build a still newer, still better life for yourself from now on. You deserve love and safety."

Go FULL METAL with all of the recording/legal/police/CPS advice. Throw the whole damn pot of spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks, throw now and throw hard. If you’re at all like me and my loved ones you don’t really believe how bad shit like this can get and how quickly. But it can. What will happen next is potentially life or death, so do not hesitate, equivocate, downplay, or procrastinate. Do not attempt to reason with the enemy and do not be deceived by displays of better behavior or superficial attempts to reconcile. You sound AWESOME. You have TOTALLY got this.

(Rich childless lawyers who let me be homeless for six months, losing sleep and hair and meals and all my savings from stress, living in AirBnBs where drug-addicted dudes threw each other down the stairs, while they sat on a full basement guest suit in their $3.45million townhouse because “we aren’t comfortable having long-term company”.)"

I found other ways. None of them were satisfying but I know myself and I know a funeral probably wouldn’t have been either. The point is that you can find your own way if or when it comes to that - you don’t have to risk a nasty blowup if you aren’t sure that’s what you want/you can handle it/etc.

ChoosingBeggars,fcl7d69,t1_fckkycu,1577741396.0,"Same, for me it’s because I grew up with emotional abuse. Every slight or harsh tone or criticism that upset me was my fault for being upset, because I was “too sensitive”, and my dad was always waaay harder on me than the others even when I got better grades or had more scientific and artistic pursuits, because he was trying to “toughen me up”. So for most of my life I’ve always assumed I’m the problem in any given situation, my feelings are not valid reasons to act or not act, I should go out of my way to extremes to accommodate others ... and it has led me down the merry primrose path to many very hellish relationships and situations. 

I didn’t mean to put that idea in your head if your life is fine and dandy, it’s just that I’m 26 and only just starting to be able to acknowledge it, so it seems worth a mention. So many people have internalized what happened to them to the point that we can’t even see it wasn’t us."
povertyfinance,fcl5swu,t3_ehotpg,1577740430.0,"If you haven’t paid yet, don’t. They’ll probably try to garnish your wages (get a legal pass to skim off your bank account) but that takes time, in my small hometown it took months for the orthodontist to get into my mom’s accounts. Pay your rent, pick up the shifts, pay the dentist back ASAP and you’ll have it done with before they get any legal ball rolling.

Also truthfully roast the living fuck it of them on any and every review platform you can find, make profiles for them if they aren’t on some of them. They don’t deserve clientele. Maybe they’ll have to start doing payment plans.

And my usually great mom has spent my Christmas visit thus far telling me she thinks I’m bipolar like my emotional terrorist dad (ouch) telling me to get on meds (an old, horrible point of contention which cuts all the way down to my deepest sense of self and value as a person) because I keep crying at the drop of a hat, and then pointing to my distress from these conversations as further reason that I am unstable and must be medicated, and I really don’t think my emotional behavior is so unreasonable at this point ..."

Also if I duck time with either of my grandmas I feel horrible but they are genuinely really hard to endure sometimes. I get really worn down physically and emotionally and a nasty family interaction can send me into a tailspin. I know I shouldn’t feel obliged to subject myself to their gaslighting and shaming and nitpicking and all by it’s hard when so many people preach veneration of your elders apparently no matter what ... I love my grandmothers and empathize with them and I don’t want to be selfish by putting myself first but I also shouldn’t have to subjugate myself to emotional abuse just so an old woman can enjoy a little less lonely.
