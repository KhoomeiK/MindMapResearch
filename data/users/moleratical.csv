BetterEveryLoop,fg7xqx3,t1_fg7wdz7,1580604180.0,">  If people want to strip rights, it should at most affect their own state/community,

That's the thing about rights though, they are universal (theoretically). Allowing a state to strip rights means that those rights never existed in the first place, and therefore are not rights rather they are privileges doled out by the state, often in exchange for political favors. If they are rights then the state would have no ability to strip them, which is why a strong federal government is needed, to keep a state from exercising such power. I understand what you are saying, but the practicality of local rule just never seems to work out well and people are often abused, they're ability to move is curtailed either economically or legally (segregation laws). The federal government is the only institution that can guarentee rights are protected for all citizens. It doesn't always do that, but no other institution has that potential.

>But don’t let them use the federal government to tell others how to live.

Whereas this does happen, generally the federal government telling others how to live is a holdover from the past, and those same people/politicians that claim ""states rights"" are also the ones that wish to keep restrictions in place on a federal level. It is very difficult to take a right away at the federal level after it has been granted, it is much easier to do so at the local and state level. furthermore, small governments historically are more prone to corruption, however that corruption also tends to be smaller in effect."
