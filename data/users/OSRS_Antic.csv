chess,ff931bh,t1_ff8sj8e,1579703617.0,"Exactly! When playing with people in a casual setting, that you're beating in a 10 to 1 ratio, I find more enjoyment giving them a little help, albeit cryptic so they can figure out themselves what it is that makes their current move blunder a piece or hang a mate. And vice versa, when playing against someone that is clearly much better than me, I find more enjoyment in actually being able to reach middle game or endgame, instead of losing to opening traps and what not.

If you're the stronger player, going for cheeky openings only shows you're capable of memorising some YouTube video that your opponent didn't see. Try that in your official games, go ahead, but when playing for fun, it's just obnoxious and disrespectful. If that is your way to victory, to me you're playing to be the victor, not playing to be playing the wonderful game that is chess."

chess,ff7v5gj,t1_ff75089,1579659103.0,"Nothing wrong with correspondence chess, it's like you're doing chess puzzles, only the puzzles aren't all ""find the critical line for solidifying a winning advantage"", but ""find the best move"".

If you take correspondence chess serious it actually gives you a lot of things that classical and rapid time controls don't! I sometimes take a look at my opponents move in the morning. Throughout the day I'll be thinking about the position every now and then, whenever it pops up in my train of thought. This fantasizing/calculating/theorising has a much higher plateau than rapid chess imo."
selfimprovement,ff53p47,t3_erlrx1,1579579367.0,"What is stopping you from getting your own place? Is it solely financially impossible right now? 

This sounds like a prime example of ""You can't change the people around you, but you can change the people around you."" You're not going to solve this with a good talk or some strict boundaries, trying to find a place for your own family seems like the way to go. Until then, you'll have to deal with the reality of living in a home where you don't have a say. Some things are unfair and suck, but it's not your parents that decided they wanted another baby, so asking them to change themselves because of a situation they had no say over is logically unreasonable (but definitely reasonable from an emphatic and social standpoint). 

If you're at a friend's house with your baby and you ask them kindly to not smoke when you have your child with you,  them continuing to smoke inside their home makes them kind of an asshole, but they're not in the wrong. Good luck"

UnexpectedlyWholesome,fexigzl,t1_fex368a,1579431533.0,"Well it's a matter of personal interpretation in this scenario. We do not know his motives for sure, we can only guess. Both ""I want to give her a moment of feeling awesome and happy and share her genuine reaction because it's so wholesome"" and ""I want to prank her and mock her naivety and share it for internet points"" are possible.

Is there a clear tell which is which? Not really, but to me it seems like the video is an example of the first, mostly because he doesn't reveal to her in the video that she got fooled. Then again, you could make an argument he didn't do that because he wanted to fake being wholesome and so we could keep discussing human motives for eternity, because reality is, you and I don't know.

So it's a matter of choosing what you want to believe, and I choose to believe in the more optimistic, positive and wholesome option."
chess,fewdypg,t1_few9da1,1579408987.0,"Simply moving the bishop back to e2. It seems to waste a tempo, which is probably why it's slightly worse than top engine move, but it's not all that bad. If you end up fully closing the pawn structure, in other words, whites light square bishop and Black's dark square bishop are both trapped behind their pawn chains, your bishop can be aimed towards Black's kings side but not vice versa. Depending on what type of positions you prefer playing, Bd3 isn't that bad, giving away one tempo to close up a position that you are confident in playing isn't the end of the world. Also in closed positions you tend to have more time to move your pieces around anyways, since there are less direct threats and tactics when a lot of the pieces are still stuck behind pawn structures.

c3 is still stronger though"
chess,few5lhi,t1_few3mcu,1579405733.0,"c3 is the engine top recommendation, it protects your d4 pawn and strengthens your structure. Playing c4 means your c pawn will not be able to support your pawn on d4, and since black currently has 2 attackers and your d4 pawn has only 1 defender, black can win your d4 pawn, which also weakens your e5 pawn, that's mostly why c4 isn't great.

Bd3 is slightly worse than c3, it's a developing move that makes use of the space advantage you have in the centre. Black has less advantage when he tries to win the pawn on d4 now, it will result in a doubled pawn for black, either before or after the Knights are traded off, depending on the order. This pawn is harder to hold on to than when playing c4, because if you haven't advanced your c pawn yet, you can still use it tontest Black's d4 pawn at some point later in the game."
chess,few2vu2,t1_fevth8n,1579404700.0,There is no Bd6 or Bd4 so I'm going to assume you still mean Bd3?

selfimprovement,few1hn9,t1_fev7mda,1579404132.0,"It sounds like an autism related issue yes, unfortunately I don't have any experience with that. 

Would there be a difference in rotating the hobbies you practice once every few weeks or months as opposed to doing multiple things at the same time? 

Or if you don't want to put a time limit on it, maybe give yourself a goal to work towards instead? E.g. ""I want to have read these 5 books before committing to something else"", or ""I want to have finished this 1000 piece puzzle, or have reached 1200 rating in online chess.""

Getting bored of something isn't a crime though, I have heard of people that see trying new hobbies as their main hobby. I also consider myself more of a jack of all trades, and find it hard to commit to one thing (currently trying to break that with chess)."

chess,fetfiel,t1_fesetsm,1579374941.0,"Disagreed to be honest, a couple of days ago there was a puzzle that had a semi difficult mate in 5 and a very difficult mate in 4 combination. In a practical situation, of course the mate in 5 will suffice, but I'd you're trying to improve and challenge yourself, trying to find the mate in 4 isn't useless."
chess,femqai6,t1_fempjto,1579266450.0,"Very true, but puzzles are for practice, right? The puzzle is meant to challenge your calculative capacity and being able to find the right moves, to train yourself. 

An exaggeration of the same principle: Once you reach a certain level, you won't bother getting 4 queens if you're up 4 pawns vs a lone king in the endgame, but will also look for to mate the king as soon as possible right?"
MensRights,femfxyo,t1_fem5cv8,1579253456.0,"Do you know about any situations where this was attempted but failed, or are you basing your hypothesis on your worldview?

chessbeginners,fejdln6,t3_ep16u0,1579168831.0,"There is no reason to be ashamed of your chess.com rating, and if anyone ridicules another chess player for their rating, please realise that it says a lot more about them as a person than about you. 

I encourage anyone to pick up chess, and for some the hobby will stay at playing a few games a year, and some people take it more serious and invest a lot of time to get better. As long as you're having fun, cause in the end it's still supposed to be just that, a fun hobby (unless we're talking Grandmaster level where it shifts into a profession of course, but even then it should be fun).

Honestly, people that shit on other players because of their ELO, especially on forums like these where people can ask questions about how to improve and what not, aren't chess players to me. Of you're being motivated to improve yourself because you enjoy being able to look down on others and feel superior to them, you're sickening and pathetic in my opinion."
chessbeginners,fejd5eu,t1_feh5hf7,1579168141.0,"When doing tactics and playing games, make a conscious effort to improve what it is you're trying to improve yourself. Busting through a few hundred puzzles a day without bothering to take the time to understand why your answer was right or wrong doesn't yield the same results as actually actively thinking about the position, pieces etc. You don't want to train your autopilot or your intuition, you want to train your fundamentals from which those arise. 

Puzzles should only have one correct combination to gain the advantage of the opponent in the position. So if you're exchanging pieces and the order in which you do so is considered wrong, try to identify why your opponent suddenly has a response that denies you your advantage, or at the very least check the difference between the lines the computer gives for both move orders."
selfimprovement,fegwxdd,t1_fegaieg,1579104366.0,"I'm glad to hear you've already taken the step to a professional for something similar, and I don't think your therapist deserves all the credit for the changes you were able to make, you do too! I'm glad she was able to help you though. I don't think you're dissing anyone or ranting, I appreciate your honesty.

However I do think it's important to treat your friends as individuals and to try and not be too quick to draw any conclusions based on something like them being guys and not girls. Some people will tone down on social contact to sort things out as a result and some people will try to talk it out asap, and although there is a difference in average tendencies between genders and how they deal with things, it would be over generalising to draw your conclusions and base your future actions on those average tendencies when it comes to interaction with another person.

If you feel like you should know what caused this, you can apologize for not knowing what caused this, and ask them if they are willing to tell you so you can take it into account for the future. Being able to apologize for your own ignorance or for your lack of introspection is something people should be able to do, but it requires a lot of courage. Also I'm not saying this is the case here, simply outlining the possibilities.

However I do want to point out that you're contradicting yourself when you mention a possible cause for why this happened (""I made a mistake by being loud with my opinion"") and then proceed to mention that you don't know what to apologize for. 

Once again, I'm not saying this is definitely the cause, I'm simply thinking along with what you have shared so far. I'm just a stranger on the internet and I wasn't there so I can't be the judge, but you seem to think it's a possibility, so it's worth considering to check it I'd say. Good luck and I'm sure you can work this out!"

selfimprovement,fee3tzd,t3_eokpip,1579025827.0,"I recognize a lot of what you wrote. I've had my share of professional help because of similar issues, but that does not mean you should worry that it's a necessary action for you immediately!

First of all, don't be ashamed of your behaviour, the fact you can pinpoint this behaviour and thought process and are making an active effort to seek help in changing it, is a great step (and one a lot of people never make). Now I wouldn't go so far as to start diagnosing yourself with personality disorders or whatever it is you might fear to be indexed with. I think the next step is to ask yourself to what extent these issues are impacting your social life, work life and mental health (also self esteem) negatively. I'm not a professional but to me it sounds like you perceive it as troublesome and hindering. 

If you can muster the courage (don't feel bad if this is a step too far for now), you could ask your close friends the same and stress the fact that you want an honest answer from them, even if it might be the answer you rather wouldn't have.

Whether they tell you that it is as bothersome as you perceive yourself, or whether they think it's really not a big deal, take their word for it! If they are a good friend of yours you should be able to count on them giving you their honest opinion when you stress the fact you're being serious about it.

Whether you asked them or not and whether they said it was a problem or not, you need to make up your own mind about whether you want to speak to a professional about it. Don't blindly follow their words, but don't throw them in the wind either. In my personal opinion, deciding to discuss these kind of things with a therapist or some other kind of professional shouldn't be a big step to take, but it still seems like people see it that way. I understand however that depending on where you live, this might be financially impossible.

If you have questions or want more tips or just need someone to talk to, let me know! Stay strong.

chess,fe4s5cj,t1_fe1h8wy,1578862295.0,"I do admit when reviewing the game myself the h pawn push seemed out of place to me as well. I agree that a queenside minority attack seems like a much more sound alternative. I am aware my opponent had better alternatives than Nc3 in hindsight, and Nd2 would have countered my plan to a certain extent, but it would still have been a pleasant position for black to play. Thanks for taking the time to respond!"
chessbeginners,fdpfna2,t3_emj7oa,1578627386.0,"A rule of thumb (so by no means something you should follow blindly) is that as the amount of minor and major pieces on the board decreases, so does the possibility for more complicated combinations or threats that you might overlook. Less threats means kings safety is less crucial. 

Also as more and more pieces are traded off, the king's relative value as a playing piece rather than something that needs to be sheltered and tucked away increases in the same way. 

E.g. if both you and your opponent only have a bishop and some pawns left, the threats you create will shift from mating or material winning threats to threatening to promote a pawn. You're not gonna be promoting a pawn if it doesn't get supported by the remaining pieces you have on the board, so bringing your fellow pawns into the battle along with your king will benefit you! 

Now there is more specific things to consider when it comes to pushing the pawns in front of your king, but that's way too much to cover. As they say, a pushed pawn can never retreat, so before you decide to push a pawn, consider whether you might regret that decision later on. 

If you give some more concrete examples from a game you played maybe I could try to give more concrete advice, but as it stands I hope this helped you somewhat."

chess,fcmsf4i,t1_fckd3xz,1577789972.0,"I would say it's a yes and no, of course being better overall helps, but like someone once pointed out: since Carlsen is the best, he is currently the measuring stick for good play, and also the guy to beat in everyone's eyes. Every event he goes to, the majority of players have prepared specifically against Carlsen and his opening routines, like twenty moves deep into the game they will have studied what he has played in the past. He is basically playing his openings versus the engines for quite some moves.

He cannot prepare for every opponent the same way every opponent prepares for him. For him to be so dominant nonetheless is truly a testament to how great of a player he is."
