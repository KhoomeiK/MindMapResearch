Sean Dorsey is an acclaimed choreographer who is transmasculine and started dancing in his twenties. He’s not a ballet dancer, but it at least tells us that trans people are accepted in the dance community. I saw his choreography a few months ago and it was absolutely amazing.

I’m also a trans guy who wants to dance professionally. The only barriers I have faced so far were only because I came out at an awkward time.

It’s definitely possible, but because there’s so few of us, it’s hard to see other people who are doing exactly what we want to do. You might be the first, not because it’s any harder to accomplish, but because there’s not many of us. I’ve only known of a few other trans dancers."

I don’t want to have to narrow my dating pool even more. I would prefer a trans partner of the opposite gender, but that doesn’t mean that it will happen.

Pretty much all trans people have considered themselves to be gay at some point, either pre transition or after transition. Most likely, all of us already believe that God is okay with same sex relationships.

I believe that God sees our gender as what is in our soul and not as what we were assigned at birth. If homosexuality is a sin, I believe that if I marry someone of the opposite gender (I’m bisexual), God would be okay with it whether my future spouse is trans or not."
