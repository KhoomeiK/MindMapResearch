birdcharger,ffc6iyd,t3_esmjze,1579792685.0,"Yes we can get task limits here in Cali. I went from unlimited task limit to 21 about 6 months ago. This was due to late releases over several months, so it’s completely my fault.  

0 task limit means you’re banned. If you’ve been capturing Birds that you were last charged by you- that’s a no no. They should have warned you but then again, Bird doesn’t really make much sense anymore."
todayilearned,ff25qtf,t1_ff1v0nk,1579494565.0,Boomers are babies that were born immediately after WWII. That would put their age in the mid to late 70’s...meaning most Boomers are long retired.
todayilearned,ff0qyuc,t1_ff0p4ak,1579471446.0,"At this point, you just have to admit that Boomers aren’t the root of all problems. 

We (Americans) just really shitty to our own people, regardless of generation."
birdcharger,fem1zw7,t1_felntas,1579237149.0,"They don’t want riders comparing their scooters to their competitors. 

Say you’re in a dense city area, you open up the Lime app and you see a Lime one block away. Ok cool. That’s not too bad. 

But then you remember to open up Scooter Maps and surprise surprise - there’s a Bird, Jump, Spin, Wheels, Bolt, or Lyft only 10 feet away. Obviously you’ll go for that instead. 

Lime wants it so that you ONLY use THEIR app to find them. Showing Lime alongside other companies on the same map will cause them to lose business."
birdcharger,fdxmmkr,t3_enate5,1578770624.0,"Yeah it’s definitely not as easy as it used to be, it’s not a good time to learn the ropes because scooters are so scare and competition is fierce. 

As someone mentioned, set the filter to the last 30- 1 hour. Also, on the map, look for scooters that seem to be right on the street. You will have to zoom in. Sometimes it may look like the scooter is near the sidewalk/street, but once you zoom in the scooter is further way from the sidewalk - meaning it’s probably behind a fence, garage, or deep in someone’s driveway. 

Last tip: don’t expect much this time of year. In the Summer you can reasonably make $100+ per night."
birdcharger,fdej8wb,t3_ekz1tk,1578340196.0,"I’ve been a charger for nearly two years now, I’ve seen some things. 

There’s still a lot of people who hate scooters. They want them gone. So they vandalize the scooters hoping to make them go away. Or they kick over nests of scooters, that’s their middle finger to Bird. 

People are shitty, nothing more or less."
birdcharger,fdeimbv,t3_ekvyrv,1578339817.0,"Bird is a summer time gig, guys. Not much business for them in the winter. 

Give it until June, when all the kids are out of school/college and the party scene in Scottsdale is in full effect. 

This pretty much goes for all markets."
