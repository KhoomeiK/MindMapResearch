I couldn't believe just how absolutely horrible this dude's logic was for not using his OLED TV. I mean, for starters the Smart TV feature built into the TV is not as bad as he is saying. But the worst part is that ROKU can EASILY be added to the FAR superior LG OLED.

pcgaming,ffci05u,t1_ffchmlf,1579799880.0,"PC games are only ""way cheaper"" when they go on sale. That is EXACTLY the same as with Xbox. Digital games are regularly sold at very steep discounts on the Microsoft Game Store. In fact, I see better deals pop up there than I even do with Steam. (I follow several digital markets and have games on several Wish-Lists. When they go on sale I track the prices. And more often I've ended up buying on Xbox over PC).

And PS4 allows you to share digital content without being online?"
pcgaming,ffch9zo,t1_ffcgwi2,1579799435.0,"PC being almost entirely all digital would be ""anti-consumer"" by your definition then as well. And nobody is forcing you to buy PS4 or Xbox One games day one. If you want to pay less, wait, just like with any digital PC marketplace. And had Microsoft been able to go forward with thei Xbox One vision, you would have been able to share any game with your brother."
pcgaming,ffcfyde,t1_ffcfsuh,1579798622.0,What about your PC games (seeing as this is the PC sub)?

pcgaming,ff9wc4d,t1_ff9kkzy,1579722933.0,"No possibility for game sales? The best deals in gaming that I've ever come across were via digital marketplace sales. What are you even talking about? Lol.

pcgaming,ff9ax0l,t1_ff96ilu,1579708810.0,"I wasn't talking about the entirety of the Xbox One's platform life. I was talking about the first year leading up to the console's release and the first year into the console's release. The Xbox One had more exclusive software that actually released in the first year window than PS4.

And the ""used game sales"" argument is a joke. PS4 and Xbox One games don't retain enough value to even be worth selling. Nearly every game holds at most 20% of it's original value after 6-8 months. And I don't think that enough people are buying at launch and flipping quickly to actually see any of these benefits. And even then, it's only the tippy-top tier games that don't drop from $60-$40 in even a months time. 
And to add to that, every game for these platforms requires that the content be loaded onto the HDD, REGARDLESS of whether you own a physical copy or not. 

""Always online"" was simply an online check-in. It only needed to check for a connection once every 24 hours. And this is practically a requirement still. If you play games that use your account for cloud saves, then it still checks in via internet connection any time to load up a game. 
But their initial ""always online"" platform would have allowed for much broader digital ownership. It would have provided access to game sharing and digital re-selling of content through a more secure digital ownership method. 
People got caught up in the hysteria and didnt even understand what they were so scared about. Well, surprise! You're practically living in a worse version of that ""hell"" right now, but with more restrictions on your digital content.

And calling Kinect a ""spy camera"" in this day and age is a crack up. Unless you live completely off the grid, I'm sorry to tell you, but you probably have at least a half dozen devices in your house that are ""spying"" on you right now. Lol."
samsung,ff96mz9,t3_es6r9v,1579706084.0,"""Beat Apple""? In what regard?"
pcgaming,ff96bwq,t1_ff92x9i,1579705880.0,"Xbox One actually did have great games early on (arguably more than PS4). And that ""anti consumer BS"" was simply Sony stirring the pot of a small segment of angry gamers. Sony pushed the right buttons and came out looking like a hero. But Microsoft actually had a lot of highly progressive ideas that would have ultimately benefitted consumers in this mostly digital gaming world."
drums,ff82d4b,t1_ff7wc66,1579664166.0,"And I was hoping for clarification on that. Because it's hard to complain about, when its fully in line with how the industry as a whole prices its gear. I get that music hardware isn't priced like industrial hardware, but that is likely due to some design aspects and the bulk in which industrial hardware is produced. 

But there is definitely quality range that reflects the costs associated. I mean, there is great gear that costs 60% less than the high end heavy duty stuff. But there are good reasons why the high end heavy duty stuff costs so much more, in relation to how gear pricing is structured."

drums,ff50baz,t1_ff4tfuq,1579576813.0,"I picked up that very same Gibraltar for my home studio--to double as computer chair and drum throne. I got mine for quite cheap, but I think they generally go for around $100? Anyway, not worth the money. The seat is VERY squishy and doesn't support well at all. And the base is decent, but obviously not as heavy duty or well constructed as my DW 9000 series spindle and hydraulic. I ended up moving the 9608 to my rehearsal space and picked up a Gibraltar saddle style hydraulic for my home studio. I'd still recommend something from Roc n Soc, DW, Tama, Yamaha or Pearl over the hydraulic Gibraltar. But the hydraulic does have much better support and build quality. Price to quality was perfect for what I need at the moment."
AskReddit,ff4g8yg,t3_erhu3x,1579562874.0,"Absolutely. And while I remember dreams quite vividly a lot of the time (can even remember 30+ years of dreams as if they were memories), I couldn't even begin to tell you which dreams sparked this particular feeling. Usually it's a dream that feels particularly long, particularly ""real"" and that I'm particularly involved with. When I wake from those dreams I feel as if I'm leaving another life behind. And if it felt good, then I want to return to that life (at least for a bit more time).

I do have one dream situation where I had a relationship in a dream. And when I woke up, I was actually sad knowing that I would never see that person again. It was a trip."

drums,ff4abn2,t1_ff49shz,1579558990.0,"Very true. But from my experience, you have to spend good money for a ""good"" throne."
drums,ff49d6a,t1_ff3xudz,1579558388.0,"You aren't. I mean, I don't see where the materials associated aren't worth the cost. What's making you feel that there is an imbalance in the price of a throne vs the price of any other high end piece of hardware?"
drums,ff496c4,t1_ff3u1wg,1579558271.0,"I somewhat agree. I like my DW 9000 series kick pedals (have 3 of them). But I would say that I play just as well on a $40 Yamaha pedal that I have currently on my rehearsal kit. 

As for sticks, I don't think that range really exists. There is simply ""off brand"" and name brand. All name brand sticks will get the job done, so long as they don't have any bow in their shape. 

But what I largely see being overlooked by drummers is the investment in a top quality throne."
drums,ff3lgy8,t3_erf9kf,1579543574.0,"Very good thrones. I'm surprised by how many drummers forego buying a premium throne. As if the seat you spend ALL of your time sitting on while playing is some sort of luxury. It's necessary for balance and body wellness. 

I've worked some sessions where I was at the kit for 5 days straight, 8 hour days. If my throne was shit, my ass and back would have felt worse than they already did. 

So drummers, go buy a nice throne! And don't even go for anything under $100. Aim high. Save longer if you have to. But there is definitely a magic price point where thrones go from pretty good to absolutely great. But if you need a reference product, these Roc n Soc's are fantastic and anything else around this price point is great too."
xboxone,ff3gb6z,t3_erdbie,1579540450.0,"Last gen I had PS3 and Wii. This gen I picked up a Wii U first (oops), then decided that instead of getting a next gen console I'd just buy a PC with a decent graphics card--since I needed a new computer for productivity needs. I ended up with a GTX 1080 (got a bizarre amazing deal on the whole thing...long story), then picked up a Switch, sold the GTX 1080 (because game tinkering was distracting me from why I purchased the PC in the first place), got a GT 1030 for its 4K/60hz HDMI capabilities, completed my project at the time and decided to throw in another gaming GPU (picked up a GTX 1070 ti... which is still in there). 

Some where in the middle there, I picked up a really nice Sony 65"" 4K TV for my livingroom. I realized that I was kind of unmotivated to play games at my PC upstairs. So I looked into which console to pick up. The Xbox One X was BY FAR the console that could be found at a better value. On top of that, Microsoft was running their ""upgrade your existing Xbox Live Gold plan to Game Pass Ultimate for $1"" deal. So I went with an Xbox One X and stacked threed years of Game Pass Ultimate. 

Game Pass ended up kind of being a game changer for me (no pun intended). It reconnected me to gaming in a way that I haven't experienced in years. It opened me up to types of games that I never would have purchased, because I didnt think I liked them. And because of that, I've purchased a number of games that I normally wouldn't have. 

So I'll probably lean towards Series X first, just to keep getting the most out of Game Pass, while still accessing the best of Next Gen. 
However, there is a good possibility that I'll just get both around the same time. But my plan is to pick up both."
edrums,fevc6u7,t3_eqmhsc,1579395681.0,"Personally, I'd say to do what I did and look into buying a used (obviously) Roland TD-20. Better larger mesh pads, mesh bass drum, larger cymbals, etc. It was a prior flagship and it shows. I replaced the rack and cymbal holders with the current one that comes with the TD-50 (more compact and better cymbal stands). 

From there, keep the module and use your computer with either Superior Drummer 3 or Addictive Drums 2. Both VST's will provide you with a MUCH better sound than what will be provided in even the TD-50 flagship module."

AskReddit,fel2emb,t1_fekub1r,1579212583.0,"Whatever the difficulty was in the game, seemed to be a turn off for many. For me personally, it wasn't difficult. The problem (I think) was that the first game simply controls like Mario Kart on a wobbly surface. Blue Storm actually feels like you're racing on water and has completely different craft physics. 

It was simply a matter of understanding that you can't just lean into or drift your way around turns. You had to react to the movement of the water. And if you were around other racers, that water movement became less predictable. The key is to get ahead and stay ahead."
AskReddit,fek3j0r,t3_epj100,1579191844.0,"The game that is highest on my list of favorite games of all time and that definitely hasn't recieve a lot of fan fare is WAVE RACE: BLUE STORM for the GameCube.

I was a huge fan of Wave Race for the N64, so was pretty excited for the sequel coming to the GameCube at launch. But Nintendo handed it to a new American team and they changed the feel of the game quite a bit. Because of that, previews of the game were pretty negative and the game was mostly overlooked next to launch games like Luigi's Mansion and Rogue Squadron 2. 

And having discussed the game even among Nintendo fans, it's not one that many people think of as top tier. There are the few who enjoyed the game, but there are a lot who either never played it or didn't like it.

But for me, it's in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Its EASILY the best water based racing game. The feel, the physics, the weather effects and the ways courses change based on circuit level, lap or even what type of weather condition you're racing in. It had loads of unique racing variety and I personally find it endlessly enjoyable."
