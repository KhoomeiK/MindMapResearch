HydroHomies,fef03rr,t3_eortsa,1579045049.0,"Water is wet, and I can prove it with molecules:

When water touches something, it is almost universally agreed that the item is considered wet, except by some atomic perfectionists who argue that nothing is ever technically touching anything. So, we agree that a water molecule touching another molecule makes that molecule wet, right? 

By this very sound logic, I believe that while a single water molecule, imperceptible to the human eye, could be considered not wet because it is not being touched by another... Two or more water molecules in one place would be wet, but virtue that they all make each other wet. Water as we colloquially know it, in visible drops, puddles, or streams, is wet. Steam, clouds, and ice are also wet."

crochet,fecmz6h,t3_eoez09,1578977946.0,"What I'm about to say might seem a tiny bit callous, so let me preface by telling you that I totally understand. I've given plenty of gifts that I felt weren't appreciated, or that I thought were being misused. I understand where you're coming from. I also understand the hours and hours that went into that blanket; I'm on granny square 100/350 of a blanket I'm making, and my stitch isn't half as complex as yours.

But this issue is a fact of gift giving. Our intentions for the gift almost never line up with what the receiver is actually going to do with it. The fact that they've given the blanket to the dog doesn't mean they appreciate it any less, it just means that the dog happens to like the blanket and they've decided to use it on them. Personally, I would just be glad the blanket is getting use rather than being boxed up somewhere, especially to keep a furry friend warm. I don't see a dog as any ""lesser"" than if a human member of the family used it. 

If you're going to put so much hard work into such a beautiful gift, you have to be willing to let go of it. It's theirs now, to use as they see fit, and they get to admire it every day."
