depression,fff0xmb,t3_et5aar,1579872638.0,"I struggle hard core with any basic self care beyond showering. I‚Äôm taking teeth, laundry, dishes, keeping my care clean, etc. I‚Äôm so good at taking care of others, like my patients at work, but I give zero shits when it comes to taking care of me. I‚Äôm joining a support group soon that helps people set goals for this kind of thing. They hold you accountable and therefore I will do it since I‚Äôm a huge people pleaser. Eventually the goal is to be in such a strict routine that I will be self-sufficient again."
survivorsofabuse,feors4z,t3_eq2doe,1579304517.0,"Proud that you got through it! I have only gone once, and it was at my university. I went in for suspected yeast infection and after that felt comfortable enough to get my pap smear done by that doctor.

I felt nauseous the day of that exam. I cried before, during, and after. It helped to tell my doctor about the assault prior to the exam just so she knew what was going on and felt better about liability and things (like that I wasn‚Äôt blaming or accusing her or whatever since I knew I would be a mess). I have yet to visit another OBGYN, only because I graduated and know I will have to build a new relationship and trust with another doctor and I‚Äôve been avoiding it. 

I think the only things that ‚Äúhelp‚Äù are time, going through it multiple times, and honesty with your doctor. Pap smears weren‚Äôt even on my radar when I was abused. It‚Äôs unfortunate how new triggers continue to pop up years later. Sending love your way ‚ù§Ô∏è"
PiercingAdvice,fecjzej,t1_fecjvcq,1578975762.0,No problem! Good luck! :)
PiercingAdvice,fecjjlx,t1_feciy8l,1578975454.0,"Yeah, totally understandable to be nervous. I was too. It may have been really bad for me, but it WAS over very quickly. I would have someone take you there, though, because afterwards I felt a little nauseous. The process goes somewhat like this: they take you back, you lay down on a table, they clean it, check for placement, line up a needle (about three inches give or take, but needle length doesn't impact pain),  shove it in (about 3 seconds to complete, not horrible pain), then put the jewelry in (this was more painful because it stretched my piercing a bit), and then you are done. 

For further reference, I have multiple cartilage piercings in my ears, doubles in my lobes, and the belly piercing. I have tattoos on my hip, ribs, bicep, and wrist. My pain tolerance has grown with each modification, though, so again, that might be why I was more sensitive to the belly ring than the others I got done. 

I say go for it! You want it, do it. It's painful but not as bad as you will make it to be in your head and it is over so quick then you have a pretty piece of jewelry to enjoy :) Any other questions?"
PiercingAdvice,fecink7,t1_fecguqq,1578974845.0,"I would put money on it that it is infected. That green/yellow color is a huge red flag.  And when in doubt, go get it checked out anyways."
PiercingAdvice,fecig4r,t3_eoflxs,1578974696.0,"Age? No ear piercings? 

If this is your very first piercing, it would be difficult to gauge your reaction. For everyone it is different. I have tattoos and 10 piercings. For me, the belly piercing was the most painful during the actual piercing process itself, however, this was my first piercing following my earlobes, so I think I was more sensitive at the time. I did have one tattoo on my hip bone, and I felt the belly piercing was worse than that, but for others I hear the belly piercing is essentially painless. Like I said, everyone is different. I love the piercing now that it is all healed. It looks great and was done well. No regrets on getting it."
PiercingAdvice,fecgowz,t3_eochk5,1578973489.0,"That definitely looks infected (works in medical field). Get it check out by a doctor. You can just go to a care clinic. Take the antibiotics they will likely give you. Leave the piercing in. Wash with warm water and non-scented bar soap daily. DO NOT TOUCH IT OTHERWISE and be very careful not to catch it on anything. If it is really bothering you and you can't resist, you can get some alcohol pads at CVS, the kind they rub on your arm to sterilize for a shot. I wouldn't move the piercing but just lightly rub the alcohol around it. Wear gloves while doing this (also found at CVS, walmart, kroger, etc.). For me, this reduced the redness and cooled it down (I would fan my hand over it to feel the cool and reduce swelling, although I've never had an infected piercing before). Take something to reduce swelling, like Ibuprofen, if it is safe to do so with any antibiotics you might get."
slp,fece0wg,t3_eodji3,1578971679.0,"I have a whole bicep tattoo and a small wrist tattoo. I work in a skilled nursing facility. This has never been a problem. Many nurses and aids also have tattoos. I did have to cover them for 60% of my university clinicals, but I had one professor that did not care and neither of my externship supervisors cared either (including the school system, many teachers had tattoos showing as well). They are way less taboo than they used to be, and a big health care agency in my state just passed regulations last year allowing employees to show any and all tattoos as long as they weren't ""offensive."" Yours don't fall into that category so you should be good. I would just cover them if your university requires it but not stress too much about it in the workforce."

slp,fe67a40,t1_fe5zpu0,1578883384.0,"So I just got my C‚Äôs and License (yay)! I did my CFY in skilled nursing. The place was in desperate need of someone and had a supervisor lined up. I did an off campus practicum (not my externships) in skilled nursing and did my graduate research on reminiscent therapy in Alzheimer‚Äôs, so I had some experience but not enough to get me a job in most places. I really had to build up the program, but I love my patients. Now I have over a year of experience in skilled nursing, as well as being the sole SLP in a previously non-existent program to give me a boost. If you show enthusiasm, talk about continuing education, and highlight your outpatient adult experiences, you could get your foot in the door somewhere. I also got my LSVT LOUD certification while I was in college, so they liked that. You‚Äôd have to be comfortable with dysphagia because that is a big part of the day in most SNFs. If you haven‚Äôt worked with that as much, I would go someplace where they already have the IDDSI system in place or where they aren‚Äôt expecting you to start one up right away. That would be very overwhelming and a huge task depending on support from administration/kitchen staff. During interviews, be sure to ask them ALL the questions. Less stress = supportive therapy team/manager, solid nursing program/DON, solid kitchen staff. 

TLDR: Highlight experience you do have, seek out special certifications (e.g., LSVT LOUD; EMST-150, VitalStim), talk about other continuing ed opportunities, show enthusiasm. Find a place that supports you and has a good program already started for you."

slp,fe5q001,t3_enu1pv,1578872903.0,"I‚Äôve never worked in the school setting, so I can‚Äôt speak to it. I LOVE working in skilled nursing. My SNF definitely has its problems and stressors, but I very rarely do anything at home. The paperwork is annoying but irritating at best, nothing like IEPs and all other paperwork correspondence with administration or parents. If you don‚Äôt have the love for skilled nursing, though, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the right fit. The people who are happiest are the people who are passionate about it. If you are passionate about kids, maybe try an outpatient children‚Äôs clinic or a different school district until you find the right fit. Your experience in education may also be somewhat different state by state."

travel,fdp5ahj,t3_emjdpn,1578620326.0,"I just went to Thailand in October. I stayed in Chiang Mai, though, not the islands. Chiang Mai was a wonderful taste of living like a local and enjoying some tourism scenes as well. Very safe area for tourists, and the people are so friendly/accommodating. Not very helpful to your situation though.

I would definitely recommend visiting an elephant sanctuary if one is available on the islands. It was one of the most breathtaking moments of my trip. I found some outdoor excursions on travel websites that made booking easy.  I recommend Travelocity for this. The ratings posted by consumers was EXTREMELY accurate to my experiences at hotels and during day trips. You could find some of the most popular island destinations this way. 

Best of luck and you enjoy your trip!"
