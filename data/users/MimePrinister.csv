She’s under the impression that because I went to a private school (and a religious one at that) that the staff wanted to see me fail. She sat me aside one day and lectured me about how “people wanted to see me fail [because I was a minority]”

My mom wanted to avoid the future where I failed highschool so badly, now I’m coddled and inept all because she though people would look down on her. ***her***"

csgo,fet0e2k,t1_fernlwu,1579370669.0,"I was silver 4 at the time. One day me and my friends were playing, 5-6 games in a row we had won and I was consistently average or higher with kills objectives and MVP stars. No rank up in sight. The first game we lose, I got 30+ kills, the most mvps on my team, and one ape ace. My heart was racing the whole game. 14 to 16, we lost, and I deranked to silver 3.

Side note, it was my best day, normally I didn’t perform that consistently across 6 games matches."
