Sorry dude, I hate dealing with insurance. It's the worst :/"
witchcraft,ffgcazu,t3_etfbx2,1579903075.0,LOL that's hilarious! I sometimes lie awake at night thinking about how witchy the catholic church is(I was raised catholic). Yesterday I was on a rant to my girlfriend about how the use of incense is totally a smoke cleansing. Ahhhh people are weird man. Don't let the assholes get ya down! <3
witchcraft,ffgbw52,t3_etaotf,1579902824.0,"Thanks for the info! I feel like I already started some of this stuff (future planning, goals, cleansing) in the past few days/this morning without really thinking about the new moon, which makes me think maybe we're naturally in sync with the moon to some degree. 

I was wondering if there are any books you recommend for moon magick in particular? I just received a kindle as a christmas gift and although I LOVE how much info can be gathered on the internet, sometimes it feels like books are more trustworthy? Some websites I've visited just seem sketchy idk lol. Maybe that's a naive thing to say..."
