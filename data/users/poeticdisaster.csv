The mug was great because it was this symbol of a put together person. I was always hydrated, and then I had to pee a lot so if I felt a panic coming on I could go to the bathroom. The mug also let's you do something with your hands if they are shaking, and let's you take a sip of you don't want to talk, or need a pause in the convo.

Holy shit. I never realized that these actions could help with social anxiety. Thinking back over the last 2 and a half years at my current job I've literally done this every day and used a sip here and there for an out in a convo or a moment to think.

Recently, a coworker gave me the advice of waiting 7 seconds before responding and that has immensely helped my anxiety - mostly because when I get anxious I tend to talk over people and waiting has forced me into the habit of listening, pausing then responding if they are done.

I think it comes from the fact that they assume you wouldn't understand their issues/concerns if you aren't in a similar pairing situation.
