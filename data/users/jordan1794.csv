To raise the entire orbit, you would need a minimum of two energy-adding events - one to increase the apogee, and a second one at the new apogee to increase the perigee.


The thing is, our perigee only remains the same if the collision occurs PRECISELY at the lowest point in the orbit.




Just for arguments sake, say we have a satellite with an apogee of 250 miles and a perigee of 200 miles. If we have a collision in the middle of the orbit, at an altitude of 225 miles, we might increase our apogee by 50 miles (this would take an enormous collision/explosion)...but we are also decreasing our perigee by the same amount. Yes, our apogee is now above 300 miles,  but our perigee is now 150 miles. Yes, there is very little decay at 300 miles, but there is now DRASTIC decay at our perigee. Any debris with a perigee as low as 150 miles is only going to last a few days, if that, before burning up.



Our worst case scenario is a collision at the perigee with a much faster object. Even in this worst case scenario, our perigee remains unchanged...so our orbit will still decay - perhaps it will take a bit longer, as a portion of the time could be spent at a high enough altitude to avoid drag, but nevertheless that debris WILL be coming back down to earth within a few months/years."

Anything orbiting below 300 miles will only stay in orbit for a few months, maybe up to a few years (unless it uses fuel to maintain itself).

Nearly all risk of collision occurs with satellites that share a similar orbit.
