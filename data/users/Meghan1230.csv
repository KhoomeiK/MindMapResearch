superstore,ffxpjvg,t1_ffxnfv5,1580329881.0,"It is crazy. Sad to think about his final moments, however it happened. I just am thrown by no one noticing the smell when people used the area to take breaks. I can't imagine how that felt for the other employees to think back on once he was found."
superstore,ffxmbx0,t1_ffxglm8,1580328039.0,The body would smell either way.
magnetfishing,ffnvs88,t1_ffne04z,1580071465.0,This was my wish and it didn't come true. So I'm taking it back. I'm taking them all back!
madlads,ffdxlid,t1_ffd9g3q,1579831443.0,I don't know how to make a Google link without 'amp' but I found a Newsweek article from February 2018. The man's name is Thomaz Viera Gomes.
GTAIV,ffbv2da,t1_ffbulk6,1579783739.0,I'm still stuck! I got on the helicopter a couple times but once I got hit with a rocket launcher and once Jimmy shot me in the face on the island. Now I'm not sure what button to hit. Maybe I just have to go the right speed?
GTAIV,ffbrknw,t1_ffbqzag,1579779981.0,Oh dang. I didn't realize I was supposed to hit a button. I just went up the ramp and then fell in the water. Lol Thanks! I'll try it.
candycrush,ff94f28,t1_ff94ap1,1579704585.0,Oh I see. It seems like it would be a pain to scroll down to an easy level and then scroll back up.
candycrush,ff76lvw,t1_ff6xu02,1579642140.0,I was just wondering how they have so many boosters. I use mine up immediately.
IASIP,fezpx0p,t1_fezny74,1579460177.0,Really? No wonder Google couldn't find it. Thanks!
AbruptChaos,fexcyii,t1_fexcvc1,1579428879.0,They do love fries.
AbruptChaos,fex7zcf,t1_fex7r55,1579426532.0,I was just pointing out they do sweep it because you were being facetious.
AbruptChaos,fex7mq3,t1_fex77tk,1579426184.0,They do have to sweep the lot though.
confessions,feujn1r,t1_feufqmo,1579387168.0,That would be surprising. But if he shares the chalice I'll give him the password.
confessions,feto3kf,t1_fetnja4,1579377466.0,By what?
confessions,fetf098,t1_feten8e,1579374768.0,Then they should make better choices. By five years old you should comprehend you need to keep your hands to yourself.
confessions,fetdni6,t1_ferlyht,1579374286.0,You can make the decisions when it involves your body. It's not like a reported ass slap gets someone life in prison. People who can't keep their hands to themselves need to stop playing the victim.
therewasanattempt,feqh76e,t1_fepvagk,1579341863.0,What?
confessions,fepqooy,t1_fephslh,1579328066.0,Assault needs to be reported. Someone who can't respect consent or lack thereof does not belong in the military.
WTF,fepkwvr,t1_fepfepz,1579323190.0,Oh damn. You beat me to it!
WTF,fepkqos,t1_feorq25,1579323053.0,"""This not only could ruin someone’s day, but their week/month even year. ""

Clap clap clap clap!

Sorry I couldn't help myself. Seriously though if this happened to me I would be screwed. I wouldn't be able to get to work and there's no way insurance would give me enough money to replace my car."
NobodyAsked,feoqhhi,t1_feoor05,1579303982.0,Lol If she's willing to get that close to it she probably doesn't mind the view. Help me understand the logistics. Do you bend over something? Lay down and pull it back through your legs? Any position I think of sounds uncomfortable.
news,feo6fd5,t1_fen6n1c,1579295789.0,"I went to urgent care once when I thought I just had bronchitis. Coughing, difficulty breathing. It got worse to the point I had to stop and rest a few times walking up a flight of stairs. 

When I walked into urgent care I must have looked pretty bad because I didn't even make it halfway to the counter before being swarmed by medical staff. They took me in a back room and checked my vitals and actually put me on oxygen. They said I was tachycardic and wanted me to take an ambulance to the hospital. My sister was waiting for me in the car and the hospital was just up the street so I had her take me. Urgent care called ahead so when I got to the emergency room they took me right back.

The doctor on duty at the urgent care is a well known doctor in the area. She is very caring. I used to see her when she had an office in town. I guess my point is the type of care you get really depends on who is on call at the time."
simsfreeplay,feo1ctk,t1_feo17an,1579293764.0,That must be it. Maybe this game is for homebound people.
NobodyAsked,fenzdqc,t1_fenwkst,1579293016.0,I can't even picture how that works.
simsfreeplay,fenkyzx,t1_fend48g,1579286919.0,Right? Some of us have to work. I want that piano but I'm so far behind now there's no point in trying. I spent my last $100k on that too.
NoStupidQuestions,fema498,t1_felxndh,1579245518.0,I live in Illinois and had no idea. I hate the time change too.
OldSchoolCool,fem9taf,t1_fem77kz,1579245145.0,Gets me every freaking time...
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fem2ff1,t1_felyyow,1579237535.0,I see. I thought maybe income effected bail but I'm no expert.
simsfreeplay,felo30l,t1_felbsam,1579226805.0,That's frustrating too because the Kindle takes forever to restart and doesn't acknowledge the external card for another twenty minutes.
simsfreeplay,fekzlto,t1_fekzf1n,1579210903.0,Thanks! I'll check it out.
simsfreeplay,fekyshz,t1_fekyknl,1579210412.0,Kindle fire. The game is already pushing the limits of the chintzy internal memory and the device won't move it to the memory card for some reason. Maybe that's why?
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fekygmg,t1_fekydbz,1579210213.0,That's messed up but not surprising.
TrueCrimeDiscussion,feky049,t1_fekwgih,1579209940.0,Why was his bail so low then?
simsfreeplay,fekx3b9,t3_eol75i,1579209398.0,Eight hours to wack a pinata. What is that thing made of?
simsfreeplay,fej6xss,t1_fej6wai,1579159442.0,Thanks!
simsfreeplay,fej6on4,t1_fej64k1,1579159121.0,Thank you! That was super helpful. I think I know what to do now.
simsfreeplay,fej5tm0,t1_fej4t0g,1579158079.0,"I don't want to pause aging. I'm not really sure how the orbs work. I am trying to upgrade the orbs though. I have three bronze, I think it is. I'm trying to open the businesses that require orbs."
adorableoldpeople,fehdqxu,t3_ep314d,1579114452.0,Good for her! She looks fabulous!
simsfreeplay,feg7840,t3_eoyw55,1579080279.0,I've been experiencing that too. Takes up to fifteen minutes to visit a neighbor.
simsfreeplay,feg76qh,t1_fefivud,1579080226.0,Thanks! That option wasn't showing. I think maybe i went back to the beginning of the life stage because the hadn't competed their life goal. I had to click on the circle arrow. Now i need to figure out if i can give a life orb to a toddler.
simsfreeplay,fefcpuj,t3_eovfvg,1579053474.0,I don't know but I want that piano.
delusionalcraigslist,feasebd,t3_eo7pqs,1578951837.0,Is the series of digits starting with a 0 a phone number?
thimbleweedpark,fe91mdj,t1_fe84jor,1578933236.0,"Yeah, I thought the game was awesome until the end. It was disappointing."
betterCallSaul,fdycei9,t1_fdy5xr8,1578778287.0,Not over here. It's something to do with licensing. AMC gets it first. The new season starts end of February on AMC. So between now and then they'll put last season on Netflix. I don't know all the details about how all that works. I got a season pass on Amazon for less than $20 since I don't have an hd tv. It's worth it to me because I can't wait to see it!
betterCallSaul,fdy5u7w,t1_fdxy245,1578776434.0,Not in the US.

miniatures,fdkzyvx,t3_eltf4h,1578514605.0,It looks cool! What did you use to make the screen?
antiMLM,fdigwei,t1_fdidycv,1578442639.0,I'm just saying if you're not into someone why marry them? At least they were both aware enough to cut their losses early.
antiMLM,fdhxsh7,t1_fdhduux,1578432099.0,He seemed kinda like a jerk to her on MFB. I remember an episode his dad comes to visit and they're like running her down to her and telling her to mature. Like if you want someone to change everything they are why marry her?
candycrush,fdf1qg2,t1_fdezv2w,1578351323.0,Lol No wonder I can't catch up!
trashy,fdf0k96,t1_fdeh892,1578350586.0,Is that from Patton Oswalt? I love him. And I think it definitely applies to this guy.
candycrush,fdesff5,t1_fderwxa,1578345638.0,45? I didn't realize it was that many.
Sonsofanarchy,fdes34z,t1_fdersc3,1578345437.0,Thanks! That makes more sense.
Sonsofanarchy,fdelmn8,t1_fde2y0k,1578341632.0,"Wait, Unser was involved in the home invasions? I need to watch the series again."
WillAndGrace,fdejs4a,t1_fdeic04,1578340518.0,"I'm sorry, I'm not good at remembering outfits. And it's been a while since I watched the original episodes."
Frasier,fdde5gw,t3_ekrakb,1578308066.0,I had no idea. I also didn't know he was British until I read it here recently.
WillAndGrace,fdd94f8,t3_ekpnth,1578300544.0,Are you trying to find out what episodes the clips are from?
adorableoldpeople,fdd0hku,t3_ekn3ka,1578289972.0,This is a beautiful photo. You made a lovely bride!
weirdsecondhandfinds,fdb8g7t,t3_ekgglh,1578254877.0,That's a gorgeous piece of furniture.
MurderedByWords,fd9kp4x,t1_fd9k1eh,1578234692.0,It sounds like you were unable to make a coherent argument so you just attacked the other commenter over their use of one word.
GTAIV,fd6ny1a,t3_ek6rap,1578193611.0,"In case you don't know, there are random characters around the map that are side missions. They're fun to find. They show as the icon for man or woman, like on a bathroom door. The icon only shows if you are right nearby them and some are unlocked after completing missions."
todayilearned,fcycerz,t1_fcybdry,1578078000.0,I don't know what could cause it. It's interesting though. Has anyone ever caught you doing it?
todayilearned,fcyb0zf,t1_fcyapqq,1578077434.0,"That's interesting. How long have you been doing this? The Middle is a sitcom with Patricia Heaton. The youngest son, Brick, is a quirky smart kid who repeats what he says under his breath."
todayilearned,fcwp2bg,t1_fcwg9ve,1578032210.0,Like Brick from The Middle?
TheFacebookDelusion,fcv41pi,t3_ej0en9,1577994206.0,I just looked this up. He was found murdered and someone has been taken into custody.
facebookdrama,fcv0yw7,t3_eiw89u,1577992411.0,My birthday is five days after Christmas and I've received birthday presents wrapped in Christmas paper. Guarantee I didn't care. I don't know why she's stressing about this.
JusticeServed,fcmnvwh,t1_fcmmy2o,1577783498.0,Or you could just do your best to comfort them until the ambulance arrives. Let them know help is on the way.
