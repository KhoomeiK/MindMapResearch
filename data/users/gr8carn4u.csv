I'm on long term disability from my job (I'm a nurse) that I no longer have. Bills keep coming. Bills I can no longer pay. Everything about cancer just sucks.

Ovariancancer,fdq1jd8,t3_emkhds,1578650269.0,"I knew something was off with me in May 2018. I was hearing voices, having multiple migraines and felt blah. I went to the doctor multiple times. I was also having intermittent pain in my right upper abdomen below my ribs. I'm a rehab nurse and thought I pulled a muscle in my side. It was the least of my worries at the time. By the end of August, the pain in my side was almost constant. I went to work one night, Sept. 1 and by the next morning I was in the ED. I got to where I couldn't walk without holding on to the wall. My supervisor took me down in a wheelchair. I had a CT of my abdomen. The doctor came in and said that they were 95% sure that I had ovarian cancer. I was like, no... the pain is in my side. I was admitted to the hospital for pain control and more tests. My CA-125 was 58. I had doctors fighting with each other for 4 days whether or not I had cancer. I was sent to see a gynecologist oncologist in a city 2 hours away. He came in and said that I definitely had ovarian cancer. I got the biopsies and was stage 3C."
