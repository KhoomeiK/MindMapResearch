cordcutters,ff50rzc,t1_ff44o4k,1579577155.0,"Hmm. That's interesting.  I didn't know that one OTA signal could be different than some other OTA signal.  I was trying to watch Football yesterday and eventually switched to just using the Fox Sports App instead.

I have a Plex server but don't have a PlexPas since the only feature I'd actually use is list TV and it's not worth that much to me so far.  I guess I'll keep an eye on things and hope it's better next fall.  :)"
cordcutters,ff44jzh,t1_ff2yt1e,1579555386.0,Originally I was using an 2nd Gen Fire TV (box) with the problems.  I replaced it with the 4k Stick so we'll see how it goes.  But football season is done so no rush any more.
cordcutters,ff26lrr,t1_ff26688,1579495276.0,"This is what it shows when all is well:

Virtual Channel	6.1 WITI-DT  
Frequency	575.000 MHz  
Program Number	3  
Modulation Lock	8vsb  
Signal Strength	100%  
Signal Quality	100%  
Symbol Quality	100%  
Streaming Rate	14.623 Mbps

When things are looking like crap, I noticed the Streaming Rate dropped to around 2 Mbps.  I just swapped in a new Fire TV Stick 4k so we'll see if that has the same intermittent issue or not.  If it does, I'll try adding a router in my media cabinet so I know it has a really strong signal."

cordcutters,ff1vmh4,t1_ff1oni5,1579487185.0,"Is there anywhere in the Homerun that I can see if it is receiving a good signal or not?  I didn't have this problem when I had my antenna connected directly to the TV but my new TV isn't actually a TV as it doesn't have a tuner so I bought this to get TV signal.

It could be either the signal from the antenna to the Homerun or the Homerun to the device...  And since it's a Stick, it's wifi.  The Homerun is hardwired.  I guess I could try viewing it on my laptop while hardwired and see if I have the same problem...

UPDATE: I found I can view the tuner status via the website link and it says 100% signal.  Just trying to see how to view it on my laptop now. :)

UPDATE 2: It just starte glitching and when I checked, it still says signal strength 100% but the streaming rate dropped from 15Mbps to 2 Mbps."
Cartalk,felye5v,t1_fely4j3,1579234109.0,Nice find.  I found the same switch in a different section of Rockauto that had some other options.  $18 beats them all.  Thanks.

If so, I'd send them a Christmas card back and thank them for keeping things interesting for the last 10 years.  Tell them you really enjoy the cards and ask to be kept on the list and you'll reciprocate by adding them to yours (if you send cards).  Could end up being fun over time."

When then have our own setup steps that we follow in IT to create the account, email, add rights, etc.  When we're done, we send an email out to people with the new person's name, email, phone #, etc.

fireTV,fcbh0ek,t1_fcal6tq,1577586755.0,Thanks.  That's exactly what I needed.  I needed to compare my older 2nd Gen Fire TV with the 'current mode' Fire TV Stick (non-4k) to see which was better.  Looks like the Fire TV is still better unless I upgrade to the 4k stick.
