The sounds exists to serve as a game mechanic. If you hear wood, metal, glass, in that order, that can tell you *exactly* where an enemy is **IF** you have the underlying game knowledge. In other words, if you're not a filthy casual the game will reward you. This is what makes Tarkov 'Hardcore'. I can tell you're new because you're implying that headsets make the game easier. They don't, they do different things, some better some worse than others, and no headset can be preferable to some.

If you take your time and crouch walk, you can move on these surfaces creating next to no sound. It's so easy to sneak up on people in this game *because* the sounds are loud. If you take advantage of it by not giving away your position via audio, you are rewarded. 

The loud sounds / slow movement trade-off is itself a balance mechanic. You can move fast and loud, or slow and quiet. It's not like there's no option to be quiet at all, and in fact it's the opposite, as you level up you get even quieter.

You just want to be fast, and quiet, and you want it now. Go play CoD."
EscapefromTarkov,fdkn1np,t1_fdk04x4,1578506969.0,"Firstly, Arma is absolutely **the** flagship milsim. So yeah, simulator actually means *exactly* an Arma type game.

>Escape from Tarkov is a hardcore and realistic online first-person action RPG/Simulator with MMO features and a story-driven walkthrough.

Tarkov puts it's sim mechanics on the same level of RPG mechanics in this statement. It even clarifies that it's not specifically a FPS, it's  a ""First person action RPG/Sim""

If you're gonna call it a simulator you have to mention the RPG also. You're cherry picking the fuck outta info on the site to fit your point, and it's really weird."

EscapefromTarkov,fdkmct3,t1_fdju3v0,1578506540.0,"you're right but the influx of new more casual players is gonna get you downvoted because of reddit's popularity contest voting system.

the game is not a milsim. there are many, many things in game that are not realistic. the fact that you have a death persistent stash lmfao??? low power ammo vs armor is a big one that i've posted about many times before on here. Realism =/= fun.

If tarkov was realistic, we would have to put loctite on our scope rings or otherwise every shot they would drift off zero. This is realistic, but would be a shit mechanic in game because it *feels like shit* and doesn't feel *authentic* even though it's REALISTIC. Authentic is a much better word than realism, because realism is not fun in games. Authenticity feels like realism within the constraints of the medium, in this case a video game.

The crunch sounds in Tarkov are authentic because they fulfill a 'game' need to hear other people with enough fidelity to simulate how well our ears work in real life. The different sounds deepen the mechanic by rewarding map knowledge. The different headsets allow for different playstyles. If it was realistic, the directional sounds on headsets would be much worse than having none except for the very top end of headsets, where it's only a little worse. 

Now if Tarkov headsets had shit directionality, would they be 'feel good' to use? Of course not. 

""b..b..but it's realistic!""

So they make concessions on realism only when they feel it interrupts the 'flow' of the game. And that's good game design."
EscapefromTarkov,fdklmfk,t1_fdis58c,1578506096.0,"all these new players lol. ammo has fragmentation chance, and high penetration ammo tends to have lower flesh damage. 7n1 and SNB 7.62x54r are a good example of this. so yes, ammos that go through high level armor will sometimes take more bullets to kill than a hollow point that does not pen armor."
EscapefromTarkov,fdklh1h,t1_fdjfis3,1578506007.0,"that's an issue with being able to cheese the skills, not the skills themselves.

EscapefromTarkov,fdkl8c0,t1_fdi7l9y,1578505861.0,"What the actual casual bullshit is this. inb4 realism arguments, the sounds are great where they're at. the ability to wear different headsets or not at all is what you as the player have the ability to change. the walking sounds are a massive part of what makes tarkov truly unique. there are already skills in game that make you quieter on stuff. casualizing the fuck outta this game and it's gonna end up unrecognizable."

Choosing 5.1 or 7.1 only works if you actually have those speaker setups. activating 'surround' mode and choosing these is not actually surround sound and 99% of the time you're better of just going with a stereo mix. it's the most polished because it's the setting most people use."
modernwarfare,fck5cw6,t1_fck2209,1577717052.0,"i haven't bought a cod since blops.  
12hz is more than neglected, that's a spit in the face. That's the developers literally saying ""Hey, we know 12hz leads to unenjoyable gameplay experiences and is far below the industry standard for anything competitive, and all we gotta do is cough up a little more cash for better servers, but we care about money more than we do gameplay or our community.""  
it's purely a way to cut costs. there is no reason you could ever decide 12hz is acceptable unless you're just being cheap, and that's very telling of the attitude of the developer/publisher.

I'm glad you can find enjoyment in the game, I just caution against such a ridiculously low standard for developers. It's a very naive attitude to hope that they will 'learn their lesson' with the next one. It's been shown over and over again that the only thing activision cares about is making money so that will be the priority when it comes to the development of games, not fun. Having such low standards and still buying the games despite the issues only encourages their behavior.

If you ever want to see Call of Duty be a truly great series again you have to vote with your wallet and not just accept this shit until they respect what remains of their audience."
modernwarfare,fcjwfu0,t1_fbxhyfs,1577708018.0,"honestly all the things you listed as pros shows you have really low standards. 12hz tick rate is unforgivable in any game that proclaims to be ""competitive"". 'dynamic sandbox' is laughable compared to a game like ArmA or Tarkov. Gun customization? Again, Tarkov.

From the little I've played it felt like a washed down shooter in the same formulae we've been getting for years. And for real how is anyone letting them get away with 12hz tick rate? CS players have bitched for years that matchmaking is *only 64!* completely insane and utterly unforgivable but people will buy it next year and we'll be having this same conversation again in 12 months."
modernwarfare,fcjw7ta,t1_fbxuu1a,1577707727.0,"> They sold so many because of the hype. People thought they were finally getting another mw2. They didn’t.

rinse and repeat the cycle for next year's CoD. People still buy it and wonder why it sucks.."
CoDCompetitive,fcjvwq7,t1_fcjg5r3,1577707317.0,"yeah, no. unless you have dedicated drivers for each channel in EACH EAR your *headphones*, you're not getting accurate directional audio. Those 'surround sound' buttons are emulation. The game is mixed and intended to be played on 2 channel stereo systems like how 99% of people are going to experience it, so adding emulation in that mix is not going to help directional accuracy."
CoDCompetitive,fcjvo2k,t1_fcj24o3,1577706987.0,this is why if you really want to play competitive games you have to play on PC. once you've removed even the option of dumb arguments like this you can actually get to playing the game the best way possible.

If you take your time and crouch walk, you can move on these surfaces creating next to no sound. It's so easy to sneak up on people in this game *because* the sounds are loud. If you take advantage of it by not giving away your position via audio, you are rewarded. 

The loud sounds / slow movement trade-off is itself a balance mechanic. You can move fast and loud, or slow and quiet. It's not like there's no option to be quiet at all, and in fact it's the opposite, as you level up you get even quieter.

You just want to be fast, and quiet, and you want it now. Go play CoD."
EscapefromTarkov,fdkn1np,t1_fdk04x4,1578506969.0,"Firstly, Arma is absolutely **the** flagship milsim. So yeah, simulator actually means *exactly* an Arma type game.

>Escape from Tarkov is a hardcore and realistic online first-person action RPG/Simulator with MMO features and a story-driven walkthrough.

Tarkov puts it's sim mechanics on the same level of RPG mechanics in this statement. It even clarifies that it's not specifically a FPS, it's  a ""First person action RPG/Sim""

If you're gonna call it a simulator you have to mention the RPG also. You're cherry picking the fuck outta info on the site to fit your point, and it's really weird."
EscapefromTarkov,fdkmuof,t1_fdkmhd6,1578506848.0,o shit my b i think i'm a lil triggered by the front page full of casual changes to the game lmfao
EscapefromTarkov,fdkmct3,t1_fdju3v0,1578506540.0,"you're right but the influx of new more casual players is gonna get you downvoted because of reddit's popularity contest voting system.

the game is not a milsim. there are many, many things in game that are not realistic. the fact that you have a death persistent stash lmfao??? low power ammo vs armor is a big one that i've posted about many times before on here. Realism =/= fun.

If tarkov was realistic, we would have to put loctite on our scope rings or otherwise every shot they would drift off zero. This is realistic, but would be a shit mechanic in game because it *feels like shit* and doesn't feel *authentic* even though it's REALISTIC. Authentic is a much better word than realism, because realism is not fun in games. Authenticity feels like realism within the constraints of the medium, in this case a video game.

The crunch sounds in Tarkov are authentic because they fulfill a 'game' need to hear other people with enough fidelity to simulate how well our ears work in real life. The different sounds deepen the mechanic by rewarding map knowledge. The different headsets allow for different playstyles. If it was realistic, the directional sounds on headsets would be much worse than having none except for the very top end of headsets, where it's only a little worse. 

Now if Tarkov headsets had shit directionality, would they be 'feel good' to use? Of course not. 

""b..b..but it's realistic!""

So they make concessions on realism only when they feel it interrupts the 'flow' of the game. And that's good game design."
EscapefromTarkov,fdklmfk,t1_fdis58c,1578506096.0,"all these new players lol. ammo has fragmentation chance, and high penetration ammo tends to have lower flesh damage. 7n1 and SNB 7.62x54r are a good example of this. so yes, ammos that go through high level armor will sometimes take more bullets to kill than a hollow point that does not pen armor."
EscapefromTarkov,fdklh1h,t1_fdjfis3,1578506007.0,"that's an issue with being able to cheese the skills, not the skills themselves.

and besides, you're being hyperbolic. they've toned down most of the skills in the past year or so. their used to be things you literally couldn't jump over and places you couldn't get to if you didn't cheese strength."
EscapefromTarkov,fdklcry,t1_fdjhks4,1578505936.0,it's almost like you have to invest your time into the game to get your character to be as strong as you think they should. what an insane concept.
EscapefromTarkov,fdkl8c0,t1_fdi7l9y,1578505861.0,"What the actual casual bullshit is this. inb4 realism arguments, the sounds are great where they're at. the ability to wear different headsets or not at all is what you as the player have the ability to change. the walking sounds are a massive part of what makes tarkov truly unique. there are already skills in game that make you quieter on stuff. casualizing the fuck outta this game and it's gonna end up unrecognizable."

CoDCompetitive,fck66ig,t1_fck5m3d,1577717708.0,"to add on and avoid confusion down the road, some games will let you choose the mix. usually, headphones, speakers, tv, 5.1, 7.1, etc.. 

Choosing 5.1 or 7.1 only works if you actually have those speaker setups. activating 'surround' mode and choosing these is not actually surround sound and 99% of the time you're better of just going with a stereo mix. it's the most polished because it's the setting most people use."
modernwarfare,fck5cw6,t1_fck2209,1577717052.0,"i haven't bought a cod since blops.  
12hz is more than neglected, that's a spit in the face. That's the developers literally saying ""Hey, we know 12hz leads to unenjoyable gameplay experiences and is far below the industry standard for anything competitive, and all we gotta do is cough up a little more cash for better servers, but we care about money more than we do gameplay or our community.""  
it's purely a way to cut costs. there is no reason you could ever decide 12hz is acceptable unless you're just being cheap, and that's very telling of the attitude of the developer/publisher.

I'm glad you can find enjoyment in the game, I just caution against such a ridiculously low standard for developers. It's a very naive attitude to hope that they will 'learn their lesson' with the next one. It's been shown over and over again that the only thing activision cares about is making money so that will be the priority when it comes to the development of games, not fun. Having such low standards and still buying the games despite the issues only encourages their behavior.

If you ever want to see Call of Duty be a truly great series again you have to vote with your wallet and not just accept this shit until they respect what remains of their audience."
modernwarfare,fcjwfu0,t1_fbxhyfs,1577708018.0,"honestly all the things you listed as pros shows you have really low standards. 12hz tick rate is unforgivable in any game that proclaims to be ""competitive"". 'dynamic sandbox' is laughable compared to a game like ArmA or Tarkov. Gun customization? Again, Tarkov.

From the little I've played it felt like a washed down shooter in the same formulae we've been getting for years. And for real how is anyone letting them get away with 12hz tick rate? CS players have bitched for years that matchmaking is *only 64!* completely insane and utterly unforgivable but people will buy it next year and we'll be having this same conversation again in 12 months."
modernwarfare,fcjw7ta,t1_fbxuu1a,1577707727.0,"> They sold so many because of the hype. People thought they were finally getting another mw2. They didnâ€™t.

CoDCompetitive,fcjvwq7,t1_fcjg5r3,1577707317.0,"yeah, no. unless you have dedicated drivers for each channel in EACH EAR your *headphones*, you're not getting accurate directional audio. Those 'surround sound' buttons are emulation. The game is mixed and intended to be played on 2 channel stereo systems like how 99% of people are going to experience it, so adding emulation in that mix is not going to help directional accuracy."
CoDCompetitive,fcjvo2k,t1_fcj24o3,1577706987.0,this is why if you really want to play competitive games you have to play on PC. once you've removed even the option of dumb arguments like this you can actually get to playing the game the best way possible.
