AncestryDNA,ff18c61,t1_ff0fvf8,1579476235.0,"So, I heard the 'Cherokee ancestor story' from my Southern maternal great-grandmother as well. She cited her ""hooked nose"" as evidence (not even kidding). It really was a thing back then (and now) to try to claim identity with Native Americans as stereotypes identified them as innately 'noble' and 'exotic.' It was a way to spice up one's own identity, so to speak, although why these stories always seem to claim Cherokee blood specifically, I don't know.

I'm waiting on my results from Ancestry, but my 23andMe test shows around 18.9% Native American DNA. However, I know for a fact that this is all from my father's side, as it specifies the region of Mexico that he's from. As with you and OP, my g-grandmother's claim that we have any ties to the Cherokee tribe is yet another family fable. Interestingly, I was on an Ancestry board a while back and saw a message from a distant cousin who shares a 3rd-great-grandfather with me. That person was asking about the ""Cherokee heritage"" that they'd heard about--the story had really been spread far and wide! 

Elizabeth Warren's test found that she had between 1/32 and 1/1024 Native DNA. I think they estimated that to be within the range of six to ten generations. Tracing my own family tree ten generations back (and I am younger than Warren) takes me to the 1600s. You won't get whites emigrating to the Americas any farther back than that. And at that point, any DNA you share with these distant ancestors is negligible at best."

> why should Warren supporters believe Bernie? 

Because he has been consistent on this issue for the entirety of his political career (check out the video from the 1980s in which he specifically says that a woman can be president), as well as him initially pushing Warren to run in 2016, only running himself after she declined, and then supporting Hillary by personally campaigning for her on 39 stops around the country."
AmItheAsshole,fefxt0m,t1_fefsdfd,1579068783.0,"You're missing the fact that the $85k statistic is for all of California in the '80s, not Los Angeles, where the cost of houses would be significantly higher. I noted elsewhere in this post that my family sold two homes in the '80s, one for $112k and the other for $119 (and no, I didn't profit off of either of them). Those two houses were in \*very\* undesirable areas of L.A., so you can imagine how much more a home in a nicer neighborhood would have cost. Also, as another poster noted, mortgage rates were through the roof in the '80s.

I can also guarantee that no one in my family made anything close to $22k a year, either. My mom is a boomer; she wrecked her health working four jobs at a time as a waitress and a maid for over 20 years. I can assure you, she had it pretty tough."
AmItheAsshole,fefwegc,t1_fef1l06,1579067388.0,"OP is a liar, though. I just went back and checked figures. My mother and my grandparents both sold their houses in L.A. (a run-down area of L.A., specifically) in the 1980s. Mom's sold for $112,000 in 1988; my grandparents' home sold for $119,000 in 1987. Again, these were non-fashionable, blue-collar neighborhoods, and both figures are a far cry from the $40,000 OP is claiming houses cost in the '80s in the (I assume) decent neighborhood he moved into. 

OP has no idea what he's talking about. YTA, OP.

By the way, I received no inheritance and did not profit from the properties that used to be in my family. Be grateful you can afford a home of your own in L.A., OP."
