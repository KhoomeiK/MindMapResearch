Christian,fdecp2j,t1_fdec1my,1578336144.0,Thank you!!
Christian,fde5uxn,t1_fde54o9,1578331846.0,"Yeah I did have that thought. Thankfully our church, while I don’t think they will perform marriages and such, do have the mindset of acceptance in that Jesus wanted Everyone to come to Him. Not just the good and sinless people. She has a few friends in that lifestyle so we have discussed it as well. About how the Bible calls it a sin, but it also says that about lying, cheating, saying the Lords name in vain, ect but yet christians tend to treat any sexual preference that isn’t straight as if it’s the absolute worst sin in the world while saying nothing of divorce and such."
aww,fde0oz5,t1_fde0clu,1578328532.0,"Oh they will try! I have two cats, and 3 sugar gliders. I frequently have to shoe the cats away from their cage. I’ve lost one in the past to our one cat - he had escaped the cage and didn’t survive it :( our cage is set on top of a large dog kennel and is very big (they need a large cage) and our cats will still frequently try to get them through the cage :("
aww,fddzqc8,t1_fddyacy,1578327883.0,Same! Not to mention that cat saliva has so much bacteria that it can be lethal to gliders
aww,fddzmbc,t1_fddz6wf,1578327810.0,"It is called a sugar glider and as an owner of both cats and gliders, while cute, this video makes me cringe lol. Cat saliva is full of bacteria that it can be lethal to gliders."
Christian,fddvz76,t1_fdd2biz,1578325327.0,"Thank you, Phil 4:6-7 is actually one of my favorite verses as I struggle with anxiety/depression. I pray for them all :) my husband knows Jesus but feels he doesn’t deserve Jesus? I don’t know for sure, he might still pray and I just don’t realize it. (He is a veteran) I do know he has not liked organized religion for a very long time because of how we’ve been treated at churches (being military we moved around) and how hypocritical some people at churches can be. :( I’m that sense it was the people that turned him away from church, not Christ. :("
Christian,fddvm1u,t1_fdd2mnk,1578325073.0,"As for the Pagan, I’m waiting to see still - she couldn’t tell us what exactly she believes when asked. Whereas when we had asked about the asexual/aromantic stuff she had answers, information, and you could tell she had really been researching it as she said she’s felt like that for a long time but had been scared to tell us."
Christian,fddvgnj,t1_fdd2mnk,1578324969.0,"Yes, we have had some pretty in-depth conversations about it. Thankfully she is still pretty open with me about everything. I’ve always tried to have open communication about things as I would NEVER have told my mother anything like that. I wasn’t open with her about a lot due to fear of being mocked ect. 

Her words are that she is confused right now. She knows what ace and aro are and all the info to go along with it. Supposedly, according to ace and aro forums/support groups that I didn’t realize she was apart of, there are a lot of different types of crushes and such. She says she may be Bi in that she is might have crushes on girls and boys, or that she may feel romantic towards them, but not want sexual contact (thank goodness on that) That asexual can have a romantic attraction to someone. It’s having a strong urge to have an intimate relationship with a specific person that goes beyond mere friendship, not that she wants/has any desire to smash their food holes (her words lol) together. I’ve researched it all a lot to have better understanding of it as I know she has also."
Christian,fddugs1,t1_fddft5w,1578324269.0,"Yeah, because hitting my child is the answer and would make her run back to the church. Pass."
Christian,fddu485,t1_fdd4ur7,1578324022.0,She spends every summer with my mom (lives in a different state) and yet here we are. Plus one of my daughters biggest fears is that I wouldn’t want her/love her anymore. She is recovering from being a self harmer (6months clean!) so sending her away would be the absolute worst thing to do and something I will never do
Christian,fddtsgq,t1_fddfr9q,1578323785.0,"My dad was like that also, only thing that makes that kind of thing difficult is that my husband doesn’t go to church also, so kind of hard to enforce.  Plus I worry about that making her resent going to church and such - I know I did for a long time"
WomensHealth,f4npg68,t1_f4nopc2,1571691783.0,You are welcome!
