AskReddit,fef1jka,t3_eondj6,1579045995.0,"For anyone who drinks a lot this probably wouldn't be too hard. For someone who doesn't drink much it would be harder but I think the best strategy would be to start right after work, let's say 5pm, and drink 2 beers per hour, until let's say 11pm. You should also drink a big water each hour starting at, let's say 5:30pm. Then you have a couple of hours to sober up, and enough time to get a good sleep. If you never drink the first few days would probably be quite hard, drinking the second night with a hangover might be brutal for some people. I think you would probably adapt to it though. Eating lots of food to ""soak it up"" would be key too."

AskReddit,fcv1c49,t1_fculydr,1577992609.0,"Toronto is crazy but Vancouver is currently worse, I know because I grew up in Toronto, moved to Van, and recently moved back. Even though Vancouver is 1/3 the size of Toronto (in population and economy), real estate is more expensive, jobs pay less, there’s more drug and petty crime, etc. It’s currently one of the top 3 most unaffordable cities in the world (similar to Sydney, although Sydney is the biggest city in Oz unlike Vancouver). Vancouver was cheap and fun a few years ago until it went through the biggest housing boom in the world. I’d recommend staying away until it changes again, the same thing happened in the 80s. There’s also lots of racial tension, lots of foreign money came in from Asia, indigineous people have been forced to move, etc. There’s indigineous reservation land within the city, I once heard someone on the reservation scream “I f**king hate white people” as an example."

AdviceAnimals,fclcx3n,t1_fclaiqc,1577744909.0,"Yes the mutations are random but they don’t get passed on unless the organism has a goal of survival, if the organism has a goal to die then no matter how good the mutation is the organism will die and the mutation will not get passed on. I think we’re arguing about different things, I’m not saying every mutation is because of a goal to survive, I’m saying in the long-run the way species evolve is because of a goal to survive."
AdviceAnimals,fclcll0,t1_fcl9evs,1577744703.0,"Mutations are random but when combined with the will to survive it means evolution has a goal. The reason some things survive and some don’t is because the things that survived had good mutations combined with the will to survive. The will to survive is also something that has evolved, because life with the strongest will to survive is more likely to survive. Humans and animals also respond to stimuli which we can’t control, for example if I put a fire under your foot you would automatically move your foot, no thinking is required, because if you don’t your foot will burn off and you might die. We don’t choose to have pain receptors, they have evolved with the goal of survival."
AdviceAnimals,fcl15i3,t1_fckx9b2,1577737556.0,"I disagree. Plants and rocks are very different, most importantly plants are alive and rocks are not. When a plant moves toward the sun it has a goal of getting more sun, regardless of how much “thinking” is involved. Similarly, when an animal acts purely on instinct it isn’t thinking but is still acting on a general goal to survive. It gets more complicated when looking at an overall species, for example becoming more appealing to humans may be devastating for the individual plant or animal but may be extremely beneficial for the overall species. The plant or animal might not realize it’s achieving the goal of survival of the species, but sometimes it is without knowing it."
