Started life as a 300hp 135i, then got cladded up to look like the even faster 1M. I'm not sure you know what sleeper means.

Impressive to jam all of that M3 hardware into a 135i, and it looks like very high quality workmanship, but this is a weird build to me. An N54 can (easily) be made much faster than a naturally aspirated S65, so the effort seems wasted. Especially given that the S65 seems to catch a lot of flak for maintenance costs and the fact that it's not an I6.

CanadianForces,ff7a1uv,t3_eryzij,1579644283.0,"Misunderstanding of the policy, just read the NAVGEN (035/16). Members that exceed certain thresholds get flagged and the fleet/formation commander are advised as required. The Navy is too thin to just say ""that's enough sea days for you for this year"". 

The way it works is that PCC will flag a member with too many sea days. They then have to send an email to the appropriate flag officer explaining why that person is doing that many sea days. That flag officer can either accept that reasoning, push back and direct PCC to select another candidate, or accept the risk of that position going unfilled. At the very least, it shows that PCC did some legwork to ensure they tried their hardest not to disservice anybody. 

And they honestly do try. I'm currently in a shore unit and I frequently see PCC looking to people posted ashore to try to avoid pushing somebody beyond the desired Op Tempo. Unfortunately, the reason many people are ashore it that either they are unfit to sail, or are at a high op tempo.

The reasoning goes back to a sailor of the quarter (year maybe?) Submitting a release unexpectedly. CRCN himself wanted to call this sailor and find out why such a high performer was releasing. The sailor in question laid out their sailing program between their own ship and numerous attach postings and it was staggering. Nobody in the Chain of Command was aware of this person's Op Tempo. This NAVGEN was instituted to protect against that.

An addiction can be simply described a behavior somebody knows to be damaging, but they are compelled to continue it. So by that definition, yes. It's a thing just like a gambling addiction or a sex addiction.

So the question to define a video game addiction is ""what damage is being done?"". Is somebody in school and failing because they're gaming? Is somebody spending income that should be used for essential services (not other leisure activities) on video games instead? Those could be addictions. Somebody who uses all of their actual leisure time for gaming? Not an addiction.

CanadianForces,ff7a1uv,t3_eryzij,1579644283.0,"Misunderstanding of the policy, just read the NAVGEN (035/16). Members that exceed certain thresholds get flagged and the fleet/formation commander are advised as required. The Navy is too thin to just say ""that's enough sea days for you for this year"". 

The way it works is that PCC will flag a member with too many sea days. They then have to send an email to the appropriate flag officer explaining why that person is doing that many sea days. That flag officer can either accept that reasoning, push back and direct PCC to select another candidate, or accept the risk of that position going unfilled. At the very least, it shows that PCC did some legwork to ensure they tried their hardest not to disservice anybody. 

And they honestly do try. I'm currently in a shore unit and I frequently see PCC looking to people posted ashore to try to avoid pushing somebody beyond the desired Op Tempo. Unfortunately, the reason many people are ashore it that either they are unfit to sail, or are at a high op tempo.

The reasoning goes back to a sailor of the quarter (year maybe?) Submitting a release unexpectedly. CRCN himself wanted to call this sailor and find out why such a high performer was releasing. The sailor in question laid out their sailing program between their own ship and numerous attach postings and it was staggering. Nobody in the Chain of Command was aware of this person's Op Tempo. This NAVGEN was instituted to protect against that.

Edit: A lot of salt in here from people who have never actually read the policy. Please read up on your supposed entitlements before complaining that you're not getting them."

An addiction can be simply described a behavior somebody knows to be damaging, but they are compelled to continue it. So by that definition, yes. It's a thing just like a gambling addiction or a sex addiction.

So the question to define a video game addiction is ""what damage is being done?"". Is somebody in school and failing because they're gaming? Is somebody spending income that should be used for essential services (not other leisure activities) on video games instead? Those could be addictions. Somebody who uses all of their actual leisure time for gaming? Not an addiction.
