Edit: Ah, OP is charging people anywhere from 45-60pp to send over the documents. I wonder if that's why people are downvoting.

It guards against illness. Additionally, the reason why body builders buy it is because it repairs their muscles after working out."

todayilearned,fdw83zh,t1_fdvy4f2,1578756022.0,"The world health organization recommends breastfeeding for 2 years. Around the world, it's common to go for 4 years. I do not think you being breastfed for two years has anything to do with you being picky. It's very common to go 2+ years in all my American moms groups. Before women were mostly working in the 1990s, most women breastfed that long, but because of the workforce, 6 months is average.

homeowners,fd8fp9l,t1_fd6nqdt,1578217878.0,"We did this too. The market in our area was too fast, and houses were selling the same day they went up, so we had to create our own market by asking people to sell.

Of course, after the birth he was on his phone telling everyone we had the baby while he should have been bonding, and then my in laws came... I don't even know why hospitals allow visitors. It ruined the rest of our hospital stay. Let everyone know you want it to just be you two to figure it out and get rest. The baby will be there to see after you get home and they can bring you food."
