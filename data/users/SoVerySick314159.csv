Almost missed - it was across the top, and the vet showed us on the x-ray where the bullet left a streak across the vertebrae. 

We cared for her for a week.  She walked on the whole bottom section of her leg, like clown-shoes.  She couldn't pee or poo on her own - we had to squeeze her a few times a day. After a week, we talked with our vet and it looked as if she'd never recover any better than this, so we put her down.

She was less than a year old.  Sweet little cat.  I'm badly allergic to cats, but even I loved her.  I'd play with her as best I could at arms-length, then go wash up.  Cost us $500 we couldn't afford - I had medical problems I wasn't being properly treated for, so we didn't need to drop $500.  That $500 wouldn't have done much to help me, but that's beside the point.


The neighbor considered us friends, called my mother, 'Mom'.  I told him that if I knew for sure it was him, I'd beat him with an axe-handle.  I was sure enough that I gave it serious thought though.  It's not just the killing of the cat, it's the hurting my family, the one he called friends. No one should hurt you and not suffer repercussions.
