I agree, I just don't want Sonos to become the post child for this movement of evil corporations when they have the best track record for technology updates. I would like for this to become standard overall, but then people would have to realize that their products have a finite life then. Most people don't want to hear that the device they're going to buy will stop working in x years, so manufacturers hide it behind weak parts or software updates.

As long as Sonos doesn't gimp the hardware they're discontinuing in anyway, and it keeps working as intended, I don't see the issue. But that has to end at some point, too."
