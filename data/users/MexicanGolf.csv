If they don't make you worse chances are excellent that they've made you better, because merely having fighting experience puts you at an advantage compared to somebody who has none. It doesn't mean you'll win, it just means you've got a theoretical advantage going in.

Your point is that they aren't ""helpful in a real fight"" but a real fight is a very broad subject. If you pit two women in their 40's against each other, one who has trained Taekwondo for 10 years and one who hasn't, I'd bet the one with 10 years of Taekwondo experience will win. Ergo, it was helpful in a ""real fight"".

So just answer the question: Does it make you worse? If it doesn't then you need to amend your perspective, because fighting experience itself is inherently valuable in a ""real fight""."

In the context of things that cost money that means I can acknowledge my finite resources and spend accordingly. That doesn't change just because the numbers involved get bigger, it's the exact same basic situation whether you're dealing with $100 and a lottery ticket, or $10'000'000'000 and medical research.

Without a potential reward, why would private entities invest money into research? 

So to me the question is whether or not the world is better off with patented life-saving medicine. I personally think it is, because the money question can be dealt with through things like a social safety net.

Perhaps it would be even better if medical research was mostly/entirely publicly funded in the first place, but that's not the system we have."
