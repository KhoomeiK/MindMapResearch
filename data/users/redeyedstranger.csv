They say that it's there just to ensure RuNet's independence, that they have no intention to ever cut our access of their own volition.

I'm not sure what exactly they're preparing for: the other countries cutting us off because our government is conducting hostile propaganda operations and influencing elections over the net, strangling out the opposition and dissent by cutting off any information that doesn't line up with the government's point of view? Maybe both, maybe something else entirely."

pcgaming,febdatb,t1_feb5yej,1578957629.0,"He's probably talking about the base stations that can track you controllers when they're not in front of your face.

pcgaming,febc247,t1_fe9m5z0,1578957333.0,"> And I've heard nothing but good things about the $230 Samsung Odyssey. Maybe I might be able to find some complaints if I really looked hard, but my main point is, not all WMR headsets should be grouped together under the same umbrella.

I have Odyssey Plus. I've only got two complaints:

1) The controller tracking requires you to have your hands in front of your face. Putting your hands behind your body, too close to your face or above your head without looking up will put them out of the tracking cameras' LOS and cause them to glitch out. That's the downside of the lack of base stations.

2) WMR controllers (which are identical across all brands as far as I can tell) have these huge LED rings that the HMD uses to track them. Reloading pistols in games like Boneworks requires you to rotate it a certain way and be extra careful if you don't want to smash your controllers on one another each time you do that.

The headset itself is extremely comfortable, both audio and video quality are superb. It ain't an Index, but definitely better that the original Rift, and isn't worse than the original Vive aside from those two issues."

Do you actually believe that they went there to fight fascism just because fascism is bad? No, the US didn't give a fuck about fascism until the war came to them. Nobody gave a fuck about Kristallnacht and Hitler taking Czechoslovakia (not enough to prompt a response beyond strong words), the UK and France only gave a fuck about Poland because of old treaties, and even within the British government there were a lot of people in favour of peace with Hitler. If the people cared about about stopping fascism, it would've been stopped in the 30-ies, not in 1945."
