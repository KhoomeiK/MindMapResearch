You need to chill and have fun. There is nothing to be afraid of. Just give it your best. When it's time to study, you study, when it's time to party, you party. Everything will be fine. 🤗"

getdisciplined,fdpll7i,t3_emlghg,1578632041.0,"First of all, don't be alone. If you are, do something you like. A hobby or something, watch Netflix, movies, YouTube, read a novel, listen to music (NOT THE SAD SONGS), whatever to keep your mind and thoughts off of negative emotions or thoughts. Keep yourself busy with something. 

Second, whatever the sh!t you have been through is in the past now. Don't be scared of the future. Live in the moment. Don't overthink. Hang out with friends, go out for a walk... Just don't sit alone at home.

Third, please think positive. Things will change.
