I generally took as prescribed but there definitely was minor panic when I was low coming refill time.   This only allowed me to deal with the pain and not work on myself.  I am a lazy person by nature I suppose

Luckily, drug laws changed and I had to go to a pain management clinic that made it a pain in the ass to refill my prescription.  Monthly appointments, knee injections, physical therapy that was really BS.  I was too lazy to do all that just for a script.  

That was when I stopped taking them and relied on OTC meds.  It sucked for about a week but I got over it with only minor (relatively) withdrawals due to not over medicating.  The OTC's helped, but after a vacation where I could barely walk to the beach I decided to make a change and cut my intake from 6-7000 calories(!) to about 1500-2000.  I also started walking a bit.

Anyway, I took it as an addiction and made nearly all carbs off limits.  I did eat some in vegetables but very low ""Keto"" levels.  I HAD to since I didn't want one Oreo after my huge lunch of a quarter pounder supersized with a side of 20 nuggets.  I wanted a sleeve of Oreos and a glass of milk, and why not a couple candy bars.

Afterward I went into a kind of  haze.  I felt like a brain fog.  I just wanted to do nothing but sit around or nap.  

After the initial shock of no carbs and keto flu, I was able to walk past the candy lying out in the office without my mouth watering.  I did this for 90 days and watched my bloodwork go to near normal.

By that time I was not even thinking about carbs, but vacation happened.  So many good restaurants with desserts and sushi and beer and whatever.  I did not go full blown nuts, but my carb and calorie intake went way up, and I gained some back.  That was not an issue as I am back on track for 2 weeks now and near my pre vacation weight.

The one thing I noticed is that, even with a limited amount of carbs (by my pre-keto standards) I got that brain fog back.  It wasn't nearly as bad as I had before, but it was definitely noticeable, and I did not like it one bit.  Although I would love to sit down with a quart of chicken fried rice, the thought of the food coma that follows keeps me on the wagon.

I truly believe that carb/sugar addiction is truly an addiction."

“Keto “. I went to nearly zero carbs. I ate only eggs, nuts, chicken, salads with very little dressing. I found turkey meat sticks from Aldi we’re great for a small snack at 45 calories per stick. 

I also walked a lot though I have slacked off lately. 

I used a cast iron grill pan with no oil to cook chicken and meat and made hard boiled eggs for the week. 

I also bought a food scale ( about 12 bucks on Amazon) to stay accurate 

Finally I ate no sugar, rice, pasta,or potatoes or starches of any kind. I do eat veggies like peppers and broccoli and cauliflower with some wostershire sauce for flavor to fill me up.

Hidradenitis,fcuvkjf,t3_eiymze,1577989431.0,"I’m married and have had it on my butt since 16 or so. Became overweight over the years and it spread in my pits and down my sides. Also on my head. I regularly bleed and oose over clothes. I wear dark clothing to cover it up. I have to cover bead clothes so I don’t bleed on everything. It sucks

Just today I was fishing with my son and had my shirt off. I had one oosing down my side and had to put shirt back on so I didn’t gross anybody out. 

I also have a permanent zit about a size of a nickel on my hairline on the back of my neck that drains a couple times a week. I try to deal and do my best but it sucks"
atheism,fctpubj,t3_eirxzf,1577953365.0,After a surgery (appendectomy) I stopped being afraid to die. They put me under and there was nothing. I woke up fine later but it was different than sleeping. It was like someone hit a pause button
worldnews,fc38s86,t3_efw8hc,1577384212.0,It was gratuitous and stupid anyway. It was like they threw it in in post production
