JoeRogan,ffls50z,t1_ffjwlgf,1580043390.0,I would say the die hard establishment Democrats are way more toxic.  Hillary Stans and KHive folks are out there lashing out like wounded psychopaths.
BreadTube,ffjvooa,t1_ffjsn8b,1580008232.0,You're a neo-lib supporter posing as a socialist on leftist Reddit.  Why?
BreadTube,ffjvh2h,t1_ffjqq6s,1580008067.0,"We should probably have an education test before they vote then? How about a poll tax? What about their votes count as 2/3 because, admit it, they're less human, right?.... Right?"
JoeRogan,ffjur0w,t1_ffijq7u,1580007501.0,"The whole basket of deplorables thing was a good example of this hubris. Pro Wall Street woke Lib shit, we want your support, but not if you're poor and uneducated, unless you support our corporate mouth piece."
JoeRogan,ffjuiu9,t1_ffjacm3,1580007316.0,"The trans conversation on line is a fucking mine field right now, even for trans people, allies, etc.  Cancel culture is real and it's toxic as hell."
JoeRogan,ffjubwm,t1_ffj7s0l,1580007163.0,"There are people with Bernie who actually want justice, and there are woke-scolds who want to police how people talk in their own self interest or ideology. Bernie will fight for the former, and of the latter who support them, I just hope they can learn that finger wagging and scolding aren't going to make people change their minds.  It is a way to turn them away and harden their views."
PoliticalDiscussion,ffeu49u,t1_ffeq9dr,1579865608.0,"Maybe because a bunch of people refused to testify and we're not arrested. Oh, and the white house refused to give up documents they were legally required to."
politics,ffdu01n,t3_eswsmo,1579828889.0,There was doubt?
OurPresident,ffdsm9c,t1_ffc9x8g,1579827893.0,"If you live in a gated community, you can probably ignore the worst of it."
changemyview,ff9sy04,t1_ff9rik2,1579720567.0,"I'm sure Obama 'drinking' a glass of Flint water kept a lot of voters home who voted Democrat in 2012. The Democratic Party of the DNC, much like the Republican party of the RNC, are Beltway first parties."
NovaScotia,ff5ptk6,t3_ern61d,1579605214.0,"If you like good food, Lincoln Street Foods is a good bet. Salt Shaker Deli is also tasty.  If you want pub fare, head to the Knot Pub.  The Academy at the top of old Town has the public Library, which has decent hours and should get you inside the building.  There is live music, Lunenburg has a folk music festival later in the summer, but books one off shows sometimes with decent singer/songwriter/folk types.

Have fun!"
nba,feu865f,t1_fetvf9e,1579384082.0,"I'm both a Raptors and Lakers fan. 25 yrs in So Cal and 15 in Canada. I'm at war with myself when they play, but this year has been fun."
scifi,feryfm5,t1_fepnr3s,1579359607.0,Check out YouTuber Contrapoints.  She just did a piece on Cancel Culture that is very enlightening (albeit quite lengthy).
CanadaPolitics,feqpufa,t1_fep4gdb,1579344627.0,"When you say 'they,' you mean the totally popular government the US propped up after the invasion? Funny, when I think of a country and 'they' I think of all the people who live there.  For example, I'm sure that in Iraq, they would rather keep a good portion of the revenue from their oil industry instead of being fleeced by American and British multinationals. They are desperate and poor and could use the money."
PoliticalDiscussion,feof8ve,t1_fem2hts,1579299338.0,I think you misspelled Bernie is a direct threat to their advertising revenue stream.
politics,feif7do,t1_fegg8fs,1579137117.0,"Anybody continuing to carry water for what amounted to a bad choice of candidate for the Democratic nomination should be ashamed of themselves.  Does Hillary have integrity? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Does she have a track record of supporting policy that ended up badly for America in the long term? Clearly yes. Tell me again how this is Bernie's fault and not the fault of the DNC?"
politics,fehx17t,t1_feh12s4,1579125557.0,"This isn't even a hot take. You can assume it to be a fairly well supported hypothesis. 
Fox News=gin up the rubes while the rich fleece the country
CNN=woke neoliberalism rubber mask worn by a corporate lobbyist for big Pharma, private hospitals, insurance and oil."
torontoraptors,fdpb7wq,t1_fdko9b5,1578624294.0,Comes in really odd looking glasses
todayilearned,fdfnetk,t1_fdfi7m3,1578365724.0,I totally understand. Thanks for clarifying. It still pays to be vigilant though. An honest post could still be upvoted by influencers and bot farms.
todayilearned,fdfayqr,t1_fdfa90m,1578357431.0,"As a 12/13 year old, I stupidly cheered desert storm.  I was an idiot, but I grew out of it.  Not sure why so many Americans haven't. I cringe at every support our troops ribbon I see."
todayilearned,fdf709b,t3_el02z0,1578354765.0,"Is it wrong to be suspicious of any post about 9/11 when the US government is sure to be trying to drum up patriotic support for another military engagement in the Middle East? I'm old, but I remember shit like this in the run up to the Iraq invasion.

Be critical. Question all media, Reddit included."
BreadTube,fd1zziy,t1_fd1q4x7,1578139501.0,Well said. Good reply.
BreadTube,fczsl34,t1_fcz9u8d,1578107904.0,"I worry about the gen pop's ability to discern propaganda from both sides. Both US corporate media and Al Jazeera are inherently propagandistic when not being unabashed propagandists. Both sides are shit, but there is a general propensity to look for a 'side' to root for."
BreadTube,fcz8817,t1_fcynldn,1578095649.0,"Does he mention that in the full interview, or only the more recent transgressions? Kind of curious what he would be willing to (allowed to on Al Jazeera) that might put the current Theocracy in a worse light than the democratically elected government in the 50s."
halifax,fcz5roi,t1_fcyim16,1578094229.0,Second this.  Vance is great.
halifax,fcz5oio,t3_eji7uz,1578094180.0,"There's a lamb guy at the Seaport Farmers market.  You can also get really good lamb from Oulten's.  They can even have it delivered to your Sobeys for pickup, I think.  Talk to one of the Sobeys butcher shop guys."
news,fcu0kk3,t1_fctxgeo,1577968354.0,This is what it looks like. American support for Bibi while he dangles before the next election. It's also bait for Maga chuds. Top comment in the thread is some shitheel that spends all his time in 4chan subreddits and says cuck unironically.
Qult_Headquarters,fbvsydx,t1_fbvkw9x,1577135622.0,"To bad she doesn't believe in something normal, like alien abduction or the simulation we are all living in."
