HumansBeingBros,ff2thpb,t1_ff0muqy,1579523498.0,"I was on a lengthy business trip to a desirable vacation location and was staying in a two-bedroom furnished apartment.  I was bored on my time off and invited one of my online friends that I thought I knew very well to stay for a week. The first couple days were okay but then she started to get very angry over the slightest things. She began going out by herself at odd hours and avoiding me. The next to last day she was going to be there she came back with a couple of knives she'd bought and was playing with them and was talking about about how she didn't much like me anymore. I locked the door to my room and barricaded it with a chair. I put her in the taxi to the airport the next morning. We're no longer online friends. Luckily she had no idea of my real home address.

The other person wasn't really psycho. She just got it into her head that we were destined to be together in every way.  We were joking around about reincarnation one day and by coincidence we both thought we had a really strong tie to this obscure Italian monastery. I thought it was chance brought on by similar personalities. She thought it meant that our lives were tied together and that we should be everything to each other. I disagreed. Things went downhill quickly. 

I have met couple other people that I knew from online communities and they were lovely, but I just don't want to take the chance now. I've known my best online friend now for 14 years and we both have had bad experiences and have agreed we don't feel the need to ever meet. We're very comfortable with that."
