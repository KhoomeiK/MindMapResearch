LoveIslandTV,ff7814e,t1_ff77yj7,1579642937.0,She genuinely looks computer generated she is so good-looking.
LoveIslandTV,ff44jdt,t1_ff44e9x,1579555376.0,Idk maybe she doesn't wanna go into it all on national TV lol
LoveIslandTV,ff2jgml,t3_era70w,1579508897.0,Yeah idk if it's toxic masculinity but he is definitely a bit too immature and insecure for this show. I'm not sure he would be displaying these tendencies anywhere but  on Love Island. It is a pretty crazy situation to be in.
LoveIslandTV,ff2cszc,t1_ff1g1lz,1579500999.0,Yeah I get that. Glad to hear it's gotten better for you.
LoveIslandTV,ff1fit7,t1_ff1e3fv,1579478424.0,"Hmmm not sure what you're basing that on tbh and it seems like our experience is pretty contrary. You say it's statistics but I'm not sure I know ahy that support what you are saying.

Wow, as someone who has PTSD I know how horrid dissasociating is. Maybe you should get that checked out with a mental health professional. It doesn't seem normal or OK to get into such a bad mental state because the person you're having sex with is older. Not my place to ask anything else on that but keep yourself safe there and remember that you have the right to stop sex if you feel uncomfortable for whatever reason."
LoveIslandTV,ff1dt4w,t1_ff1cxgb,1579477896.0,Haha yeah I was agreeing with you though lol! They do change and it should be chill!
LoveIslandTV,ff1dgvj,t1_ff1bv7h,1579477787.0,"I wouldn't say it's unusual. A 6-7  year age gap isn't unusual in relationships so a 24yo and a 31yo would certainly not raise any eyebrows. When it comes to casual relationships even less so. I think it's a lot more common than you realise. We all live in the same real world as you.

I just remember being your age and all my pals not really caring tbh. I just don't get what the big deal is. You keep saying most people don't do it like that makes it weird, disturbing or disgusting (a word I think you'e actually used in this thread, which would big yikes for that 33yo woman who slept with you lol). It comes off as prudish."
LoveIslandTV,ff18skj,t1_ff1790q,1579476391.0,"Idk, I don't feel the same way. I slept with some older folk of both genders when I was your age and younger and I can't say it was such a big deal tbh, especially for a ONS type deal. There are variations in everyone's bodies at all ages. Like some people age faster and some people in their 40s could not have changed all that much from their early 20s. And I don't know that sleeping with one woman in her 30s gives you a broad perspective on that."
LoveIslandTV,ff1779m,t3_er32mj,1579475944.0,Surprised to see Leanne dropping to the middle. We need to see more of her without Mike tbh.
LoveIslandTV,ff15tw8,t1_ff1574f,1579475544.0,"I think you're demonstrating the kind of attitude that's the problem here tbh. You've generalised about ""older"" women (kind of absurd that we are discussing a 33 year old like she is old but ok). You also seem to feel it's OK to publicly comment about her body. Which feels pretty weird."
LoveIslandTV,ff15fkk,t1_ff159tp,1579475414.0,I'm just not getting it though. They both consented. How is it disgusting? I think your attitude to this is a bit immature.
Instagramreality,ff15068,t1_ff0v4gv,1579475257.0,I'd buy their #spon
LoveIslandTV,ff14c09,t1_ff1431u,1579475104.0,Uhhh why? How is it a natural reaction?
LoveIslandTV,ff14944,t1_ff13xu3,1579475084.0,Pahahhaaha ohhh fucking hell
LoveIslandTV,ff129nc,t3_er3rh7,1579474500.0,Look at you out here sleuthing!
LoveIslandTV,ff124ge,t1_ff110mq,1579474450.0,The horror of a woman's body after the age of 30 omg the horror
LoveIslandTV,ff11ymk,t1_ff0us0j,1579474410.0,And maybe the 41 to Callum slept with was every man's fantasy
LoveIslandTV,ff11f81,t3_er36bd,1579474307.0,"I'm 27 and tbh everyone you are aiming this at has been their age. It's not the age gap as such, I think we can all agree it's BIG but it's more the sort of disgusted/embarrassed way some of the islanders reacted. It's pretty gross and disrespectful. More to the woman than Callum tbh."
LoveIslandTV,ff0pzou,t3_er31td,1579471220.0,Some of these islanders have got really weird attitudes about sex. I'm not really sure why it's such a big deal if they are big shaggers. Also really showing their age about Callum having sex with someone in their 40s. It's a big age gap but it's not like she was a pensioner lol.
Instagramreality,ff08ilg,t1_ff07tjc,1579466297.0,"Looool you're right. She has 3mil followers, has published 2 books and is obsessively followed by so many."
LoveIslandTV,fezsede,t1_feyl79r,1579461045.0,Looool the white fuckin nails
LoveIslandTV,fexd9qw,t1_fevhyzc,1579429055.0,I wanted her to ask questions about his cat.
LoveIslandTV,fexd7gx,t1_feu3xv3,1579429016.0,"Hmmm I'm a teacher too but I didn't get the sense he was whining about it, more that he was acknowledging his shittiness."
LoveIslandTV,fex55kq,t1_fev1h9q,1579424576.0,"You could be right, we'll see soon enough!"
LoveIslandTV,fesnpsq,t1_fergctt,1579367185.0,"Hmmm, I didn't really like Kem at first. He gave bad vibes re Amber's sexual history. I probably have a much better impression of Nas at this point than I did of Kem."
LoveIslandTV,feqa7sj,t1_feo5w8m,1579339419.0,She is so fucking relatable.
LoveIslandTV,feq9etu,t1_feof52j,1579339079.0,I don't think we are far enough in yet for the loyalties to be that strong. And Connor does not have the same BDE as Chris.
LoveIslandTV,feq1b96,t1_feoy6es,1579335997.0,Amber and Kem were both smaller right?
LoveIslandTV,feq0cmh,t1_fep4p8x,1579335520.0,The girls' fashion hasn't been great either tbh (obvious exception being Leanne). Like Shaugna wore that orange dress Maura wore last year with that weird distressed denim jacket that was tacky in 2008. I love her but come on to fuck.
LoveIslandTV,fepwax0,t1_fep1i4m,1579333502.0,"I actually gasped when they were chatting at the bar in Thursdays episode. The jawline, beard, eyes, omg"
LoveIslandTV,fepw6me,t1_feodys6,1579333451.0,I feel like he just can't take the pressure. He is so desperate not to be rejected that he is making himself very rejectable.
LoveIslandTV,fempgqs,t1_fem7q22,1579265686.0,I really love Shaughna but tbh I kinda agree. The eyelashes and maybe some check filler make her eyes so narrow and the filler is too much.
LoveIslandTV,femkd7x,t1_femh6lw,1579259956.0,I like Sophie's voice but it is so fucking weird. She does not pronounce half of what she says and she sounds like she's on ludes. Made worse by the fact that she is permanently cracking up. It is such a chaotic way of speaking.
LoveIslandTV,fehzvie,t3_ep5tp1,1579127252.0,Yeah this is 100% a thing. Darker skinned folks tend to struggle. Particularly women.
LoveIslandTV,feg5el9,t1_fef5ily,1579077733.0,"You're right and Leanne is definitely my favourite rn, she is stunning and her fashion is bomb. Tbh I don't even wanna compare her, she is not near their league."
LoveIslandTV,feewxf1,t1_feeu9fn,1579042996.0,"Hmmm you might have a point there tbh. I don't think it can have been anything to serious, probably a snog and a grope. Hopefully the producers are being more sensitive with what the contestants are comfortable sharing."
LoveIslandTV,feeuuj2,t1_fee4qhy,1579041704.0,Was the second part necessary?
LoveIslandTV,feetr6g,t3_eon0tw,1579041027.0,I think I must follow different folks on Twitter because oooh lord I have only seen one Bring back Flack meme. Ugh cannae wait till she is convicted.
LoveIslandTV,feetfcq,t1_fedu5ie,1579040828.0,Ooh I love this as a mid season alternative to casa amor.
LoveIslandTV,feesn06,t3_eosgty,1579040347.0,Don't think they had sex. The producers generally make it pretty clear when they do.
LoveIslandTV,feesk01,t3_eosjb7,1579040296.0,"Ngl this was me too, and it was 100% because of how sweet Leanne was when he had that chat at the end."
LoveIslandTV,feesbeq,t1_feeqxbd,1579040152.0,I love how she is dressing too. She looks fucking amazing.
LoveIslandTV,feeoy6t,t1_fee0i5u,1579038172.0,"I agree that a lot of the comments are totally cruel. We all love a meme but when it doesn't comment on behaviour, just appearance, it's cruel.

I agree they all have fake tan etc but the twins have gone for a very deliberate, very plastic look. They've also made the decision to get the exact same tan, hair extensions etc. It plays up the creepy incestuous vibe."
LoveIslandTV,fedmnk5,t1_fed9q3v,1579015250.0,"I think Paige is more husky than nasally tbh, I just cannae hear it lol"
LoveIslandTV,fed61hr,t3_eobd84,1579000624.0,"I don't think they have similar voices, just similar accents, but I'm Scottish. Idk tho I don't think Wes and Callum sound the same and they are both from Staffordshire, right?"
LoveIslandTV,fed5v7h,t3_eobq15,1579000386.0,I feel like Eve is very much the dominant one in the relationship there.
LoveIslandTV,fed5tcn,t1_fed1l79,1579000313.0,"You're right, they are good looking. But I think their beauty and fashion choices obscure their beauty rather than enhance it. I personally think their fake eyelashes are too heavy and unbalanced and they make their eyes look smaller. The filler or over lining and gloss is just too much. Their tan is too heavy on such fair skin and I personally hate when people dye their hair lighter than their tan. All of it gives them a weird pillow face look. Old pictures show they've got a lovely English rose thing going on."
LoveIslandTV,feax5n2,t1_feaws9r,1578953114.0,Like tbh idc if he is not in love with Leanne but that shit-eating chat has turned me from liking him to just ughhhhh
LoveIslandTV,feax213,t1_feaws13,1578953081.0,It was so weird when they called the boys as a pair.
LoveIslandTV,feawi02,t1_fea5br5,1578952902.0,Uhh yeah but I am pretty sure she is wearing a wig.
LoveIslandTV,fe9zvxk,t1_fe9z15d,1578942956.0,"Hmmm, see I interpreted the body language as them both being a bit shy and cautious (which would fit with Leanne's whole guarded thing) but maybe I'm reaching because I really like them both."
LoveIslandTV,fe9wok1,t1_fe8v2hd,1578942130.0,"I agree, shame her wig was not on point but I also love her style. I think she has been the best dressed so far."
LoveIslandTV,fe9wbb9,t3_eo49ai,1578942013.0,I think you're reading a wee bit too much into the comments you quoted. I think they're a cute couple and I hope they like each other because individually they are my two favourites right now. It would also be nice to have a dark skinned black woman do well on this show for once.
LoveIslandTV,fe9v8w6,t1_fe9hzfr,1578941770.0,Idk I am really not sure about her race. A lot of these girls tan themselves so dark it is genuinely hard to tell.
LoveIslandTV,fe5ezyk,t3_enu1tc,1578868653.0,"It is WILD. I genuinely do not understand it. This whole ""I like a manly man, never under 6ft"" thing is so fucking toxic."
LoveIslandTV,fe5cgy7,t1_fe589ro,1578867701.0,I am developing such a strong prejudice against her so quickly and I actually need to stop it.
LoveIslandTV,fe5c82v,t1_fe4xxoh,1578867600.0,He is so handsome and he seems average height. I really do not get it.
fatlogic,fe1bw4l,t1_fe0yjk7,1578824765.0,The second doctor yeah but the first one (who raised her weight) spoke while she was undressed.
fatlogic,fe0e4sw,t1_fe01j5o,1578811547.0,"Yeah I agree.

But on the other hand, if what she is writing is true (BIG IF there), then it does seem kinda crazy that as a doctor doing elective, plastic surgeries (where I assume they have a little bit more time with patients), they chose to have a really sensitive and potentially difficult conversation with a patient when she was naked and in a hospital gown. Most people would feel extra vulnerable."
TrueLit,fdofzdh,t1_fcwc51i,1578604373.0,Anna Kavan's Ice is such a great novel.
TrueLit,fdofwl4,t3_ej8p8o,1578604328.0,"Some of my more recent recommendations are:

**Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo** obviously because it won the Booker

**Celestial Bodies by Jokha Alharthi**

**Milkman by Anna Burns**

**The Confessions of Frannie Langton by Sara Collins**

**An American Marriage by Tayari Jones**"
AskReddit,fdk1wvg,t3_eliqzg,1578494024.0,I find I can get lost and absorbed in a way I can't with a TV show or movie or video game. With those medias you can always be doing something else but a book forces you to pay full attention and I find that very restorative.
IdiotsInCars,fdk1drt,t3_elqr60,1578493641.0,I feel like Skoda Octavia drivers are really chaotic.
fatlogic,fdje1rw,t3_eliaim,1578466931.0,"The ""you're clearly very early into this!"" Is so so so unbelievably patronising. I feel so happy for the OP that eating intuitively is working for them."
52book,fdjddqj,t1_fdii5uz,1578466191.0,Aw man sorry to hear that. Thanks for the honest review.
52book,fdhwdg4,t1_fdeaux9,1578431354.0,Anne Applebaum is such a great historical writer. The vignette about her staying with the old antisemitic woman sticks in my mind.
52book,fdhwa0h,t1_fdercgd,1578431302.0,Ohhh I loved this!
52book,fdhvv83,t3_ekcs3z,1578431081.0,"I've read **Stories of the Law and How it's Broken/The Secret Barrister** (a confessional on the state of UK public services under austerity à la This is Going to Hurt), **Girl, Woman, Other/Bernardine Evaristo** (which deserved the Booker alone, even though I did love The Testaments) and **An Orchestra of Minorities/Chigozie Obioma** (modern tragedy, Igbo cosmology, on Male rage). Glad by first three reads of the year have all been good. Now onto **The Five/Hallie Rubenhold**."

52book,fdhv5xk,t3_eks4j8,1578430714.0,I read The Book of Strange New Things this year too and it is one of my favourite books I have read in a long time! I was on holiday in Mallorca and OBSESSED.

loseit,fdd3uqn,t3_ekok9l,1578293670.0,"1. Log all food.
2. 8000 steps."
LoveIslandTV,fcr75tz,t3_eiacof,1577897754.0,I really liked her but I don't think she was suited to the show. In hindsight it makes sense. She went to uni at like 15 so hadn't had a normal social life. I think she would be a super fun and cool person irl but her personality wasn't big enough for LI so she came off a bit cold.
loseit,fcqpzw2,t1_fcnmjzf,1577890331.0,Amazing advice. I lost 90lb then did EMDR. WOAH what a mind fuck. Regained it all. Back on the grind now with a new perspective.
loseit,fcqpuis,t3_ei2wuj,1577890252.0,I lost 90lbs and went through issues with mental health. Regained it all and back on it now with you OP. I believe you can overcome this because it means I can too. Think of me doing it with you and I'll be thinking of you doing it along with me.
LoveIslandTV,fbvxawh,t3_een2j1,1577137428.0,"Wtf I feel so bad for him, she has really done a number on him. Hope he gets the help he needs."
