worldnews,fengqqf,t1_fen2tu0,1579284332.0,"It's never perfectly displaced, though. It's only possible to generate excess wealth for one person like bezos through two means. The first is rent, where the wealth is essentially historical labour, either of the wealthy person, or people who have given it to them for whatever reason(inheritance, unequal transactions, slavery, etc). They then charge rent, literally in the case of the wealth being in the form of property, in exchange for your temporary use of it. The profit from this is truly unearned, and really just takes from the econonomy. You can, and many wealthy do, grow their wealth in just this way. Compeltely uproductively extracting rent and using it to buy more property, from which they extract more rent, and so on.

The second way to grow wealth is by increasing the productivity of an activity. If you can develop a technology which reduces the time taken by half for someone to manufacture a part, for example you can now produce twice as many parts for the same cost + the cost to implement the technology. You can then take the extra money for yourself. 

&#x200B;

Bezos has risen by taking advantage of the later. He has at least secured ownership of, if not created any of the fundamental technology, ad grow rich by reducing retail costs and adding value in the form of convenience. New wealth has been created. But, in doing so, jobs are necessarily being lost. Thats where the new wealth is coming from. Now, if he chooses to invest that wealth in new markets, where new jobs are created, he can in theory create new kinds of jobs, but he cant easily create new jobs, as the wealth literally comes from displacing old jobs. It's likely, overall, he will be responsible for a reduction in the amount of jobs in the world. This is most poignantly obvious with respect to their long term ambition of totally automated warehouses, and drone deliveries. by that point, in a sense, the technologies he has deployed will have been responsible for the loss of tens of millions of retail jobs. Thats where his wealth will come from. People will effectively be paying him some fraction of the cost of the original labour, until the market reaches equilibrium, in echange for his ownership of the machines doing the labour.

In order to balance that, he would have to spend his new found wealth in areas which employed an equivalent number of people, perhaps building hmself a fleet of superyachts, mansions and private jets. Maybe rather than havign a yacht or private jet, he could have a new yacht or private jet for every journey he took, and pay people to shred the old one at the distention."

To be fair, though, there is one possible route by which this could have an effect. Cortisol, the stress hormone, suppresses testosterone production in the long term, so if by masturbating, you're ridding yourself of sexual frustration adn stress, you could increase your testosterone levels by way of reducing your cortisol levels."

Exercise is a sort of punishment that you put yourself through for the long term benefits. You need a reserve of happiness, in a sense, from which you can subtract the pain of the exercise. If your baseline is unhappy or neutral, due to financial and work stress, no holidays, healthcare worries, childcare worries, etc, then you have very little emotional reserve to endure further stressful and happiness reducing activities like exercise, especially when there is no immediate pay off.
