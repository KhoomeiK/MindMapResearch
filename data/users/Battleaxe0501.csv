The problem is that they may not have the opprutunity to afford all that because of the way our economy works. You don't have alot of monet, no college unless you got a scholarship. No college no good paying job. No good paying job, no health care. In the end just about every struggle except how one person treats another roots back to money. You know what they say money is the root of all evil. And when it comes to policing that really isn't all that true. Yes there are racist cops, yes there are just cops who are dicks in general. But the problem is all media talks about is the controversial shit. There are plenty of times when cops help people color. The only problem is you gotta go digging for that shit. Then the racism would also be based on region as well. There is going to be more in the south due to the fact that the region fought equality for a long time."
entitledparents,feef1dt,t1_feee1sr,1579032419.0,"I didn't say all when I said that I mean't a large portion and I fully ackowledge that there is actually racism or sexism out there. But more often than not I hear the bs than the real thing. I'm sorry if I came off that way. Most of the time the way i word things I wind up confusing people or miss wording it. I thought the way I worded it was clear. 

So just to make sure it's clear this time. I fully acknowledge and understand there is real racism or sexism out there. To me it feels like the majority is just the bs card. This is based on things I've seen, been told, and experienced. I feel majority of people in modern society are not racist or sexist. Of course this depends on culture because people in the middle east still don't give women much freedom sadly due to their religon."
entitledparents,feebe1v,t1_feeb9wn,1579030279.0,Yeah thats exactly how it is
entitledparents,fee9q6g,t1_fee98y5,1579029304.0,"The lady posted it on youtube I think it was buzzfeed or something like that. And that's sucks I'm sorry about that. I can relate to the self-harm though, it progressed up to cutting for me. I'm still not trying to cut and if I need to feel pain limit it to nothing non scaring. Its hard. Life is hard but gotta keep going through it I guess."
entitledparents,fee8adc,t1_fee7ed9,1579028454.0,". But it isn't just racism to, thats the sad thing. Some people pull the rape or sexism card when it clearly isn't. Which doesn't help anything. Some people are so desperate to get attention or get people on their side they are willing to ruin anothet persons life. 

I heard this one story where this one woman wanted to sue a man after he saved her life. What happened was she was done by the water and passed and went into the water. And the guy jumps in brings her out and resucitates her. Then the lady goes on about how shes glad he saved her life but wants to sue him cause he had to touch her to save her. I can't remeber the details but that is basically how it went down. It's people who do that sorta thing that give people off the oppisite gender or race a bad rep."
entitledparents,fee6nkz,t3_eop9b9,1579027497.0,"And it is people like that keeping most of the racism alive. You take out the people who cry racism everytime someone tells them off, racism isn't as big of a problem it's made out to be. There will still always be racism but most of it is gone. It's as bad as people pulling any bullshit card like the people who cry sexism when you tell them off. Don't call me a racist or a sexist because you got told no. Sorry about what happened to you to."
entitledparents,fdjsjcc,t1_fdjp5so,1578485939.0,"From what I heard it isn't really mandatory but if don't your life will be hell because I think in order to ger federal aid and all that shit you have to sign up. Idk our government fucking sucks. I plan on enlisting anyways once I hit 17 to fight for my country not my fucking government. I think our government has gone to shit and needs a reset. Because we can vote for president but utimatly it's the house of repersentives that vote. They are supposed to vote of the president based on what their state votes but if they don't like that guy they can easily vote for the other canidate. And now it feels like it's all about party over country. It's like George Washington said, political parties will ruin us and they are. And when ever there is a government shutdown all the federal workers including military don't get fucking paid but congress and the president do and according to a memebrt of congress, congress should still get paid because they have familes. Never said anything about anything about the familes of federal workers."
entitledparents,fdjng7p,t1_fdjc43u,1578479425.0,"Those are the exact ones I'm talking about. It's at the point to where I refer the women who want equal rights and don't procede to be sexist towards men equal right activists. And then when I say femminist I refer to the ones who say men aren't allowed to be sexist but procede to be sexist about us. Or the ones who have to stoop so low to the point of saying can't spell manipultive without man. There is this one story of this one feminist and she says she is going to sue a man because he didn't ask for permission to touch her when she was unconiuss and drowning after the man resucitated her (sorry about my shitty ass spelling). She said I glad he saved me and all but he should have asked permission first. So guess I guess is someone is unconciuss you have to ask to save them first otherwise you gotta let them die. God damn.

Now the only thing I can understand is the military not letting women into the spec ops like the rangers and seals due to the fact they lower standards. Buy you ask me they should just let women join if they can meet the standards for men. I get they want only the best for the spec ops team but some women are in yhe physical condition to join them"
depression,fdhiywy,t3_eleyhh,1578423642.0,I've been like since second grade granted I didn't want to do it but now I'm thinking about killing myself everyday and barely keeping myself from cutting. Always trying to stop myself from scaring up my arm more without reason any reason besides the small chance things will get better. I saw this one thing where is said in order to send an arrow forward you gotta pull it back. You get pulled back when your depressed to get launched into greatness.

entitledparents,fdhexe4,t1_fdhemh3,1578421206.0,"I don't fucking know I looked it up, same article it says this but also something says otherwise. They should just make it everyone has to sign up unless you have some disability. But if they make it to where women have to sign up for the draft it will probably be a huge fucking deal. I ain't trying to be sexist but the major feminists are all about equality untill it comes to something negative. I hate that shit, you want equality you get all of it, good and bad otherwise it isn't equality."
entitledparents,fdhedf3,t1_fdhdwdq,1578420866.0,"I'm pretty sure that only applies if someone in the family died in the service. They would have to sign up with the selective serivce instead. They make it to complex, besides since it's all about equallity, everyone should have to sign up for the draft."
entitledparents,fdh8n2o,t1_fdh81lx,1578417766.0,"Yeah the council is making a bunch of bs decisons. Like letting girls into the program, not trying to sound sexist. But one they can reform girl scouts for the campouts and all that. Two sometimes we need some time and space away from them just so we can what we do best dumb shit. 3 I wouldn't wanna hear someone having sex in their tent or something like that. Letting girls into boy scouts was just a dumb idea. Oh and the obvious reason BOY scouts not GIRL scouts. Like I said not trying to be sexist here, I just think it is bs they let them in.

Letting gay people join was a step in the right direction, but forcing everyone into god and letting girls in, not such good ideas. Although main reason I dropped out was cause I moved and I was treated like the outsider in my troop. So if I aint having fun, why do it."
entitledparents,fdh7mgg,t3_eleadm,1578417128.0,"One they would only use that if the reserves are emty which is about 800,000. Two They would have to got through the 1,000,000 active duty, 3 they will onmy choose people in good health 4 He can choose a non comabt option. Still get combat training but won't have to fight. Everybody thinks the goverment gonna drag your ass outta bed to boot camp. The draft is only used in despreate times. Besides odds are if there is an attack on American soil there will be more enlistments. She would be better off not sending him to Italy."
entitledparents,fdgyre2,t1_fdgycmd,1578411596.0,"I'm an atheist and most of the people I know are religous. And I still talk to them cause they don't force me to believe in god. Which is part of the reason why I dropped outta boy scouts because they act like everyone believes in god. Like once they forced me to say grace just so I could advance in rank. Granted no one knew I was an atheist then but an organization like that shouldn't expect everyone to believe in god. Espically at camp outs where they do grace before any meal, I just wanna tell em shut up and let me eat but everyone is entitles to their own beliefs."
entitledparents,fdgxv0h,t3_elci2i,1578410997.0,"Those are the reasons I hate cults. Could care less on your religous beliefs, so long as you don't force them down my throat."
depression,fde26rt,t3_ekwcdm,1578329506.0,"Just be there for him. It may not seem like your helping but it does. When we get hit with depression, we forget how to express our feelings unless we are faking the emotions so people suspect we are ok. Like for me, someone simply going out of there way to say hi helps me. I don't show anything even though I want to, I'm not sure I can anymore though."
depression,fde1qtw,t3_ekwd7w,1578329221.0,"I'm practically dealing with the same shit. Moved to a new state before my freshman year. Tried talking to peoplr but people only wanna talk to me when they want something. It's rough, painful and tiresom but you gotta keep pushing."
depression,fddwnyr,t3_ekvc9w,1578325802.0,"Depression isn't just a feeling, it's an illness that doesn't discriminate. Sure having a shitty life can make you more prone.

It's true because it means one of two things, you know the feeling and two you will know better in a future relationship."
depression,fcxq981,t3_ejhmgh,1578068891.0,It probably bothers you more because you know the pain and know it's part of your life but you don't want someone else to deal with the agony you are. Least thats how I am.
depression,fcxpawi,t3_ejgr1s,1578068297.0,"If your getting beaten over grades, you should call cps or something, cause it sounds like your parents are one of the reasons for your depression."
depression,fcxp1wt,t3_ejgqge,1578068139.0,"One, people dealing or dealt with depression are typically the nicer people because we don't want others to experience because of the agony we are always. 

Two he may not be opening up due to different reasons. One he just may not wanna talk about it or depression is doing it's thing. It may because he may feel no one will understand. Sure you can understand what it can do to a person and be understanding which is what your doing which is great. But only people who have been there can understand the agony of it as they felt it. For me, that was the reason I started cutting because they physical pain helped lessen the agony in my head. Or the other option is he may be afraid of the people who follow the sterotypes and all that. He may be afraid if he talks about it he may experience the negativity of it. Cause I was bored one day looking online and there was one guy going on a rant about people who take their life, have low self esteme and deppression are cowards. You ask me people like that are the main part of the problem cause it makes scared to get help.

So if you wanna help him, the best thing you can do is do what you've been doing, being there for him. He may not show it but I'm sure it helps him. And just try not to let it bother you when he doesn't talk even though I'm sure it sucks because he may feel if he pushes people away that he is helping them. But depression causes everyone to do different things, affects everyone a bit differently. But hopefully things can turn around for the both if you. Good luck."

depression,fcuj65s,t3_eizze5,1577982199.0,"Don't take it personally even though it's hard not to. You proably weren't ignored it's just the rate at which new posts come out make it hard to get to some. Trust me I know I've made posts when I was low that got buried under other ones.  And the people who downvoted, they may be asswholes or maybe it was the way you worded it that lead to confusion."
depression,fcui2xj,t3_eittrq,1577981475.0,"It's because people can't see the pain your in. Someone breaks their arm, you see that, they know it would have hurt. People can't see depression so they don't know the agony until they've been there. And people can call you weak even though you are the strong one because you are the one carrying the never ending burden dealing with constant agony. Don't hold it against them, people can't understand what they don't see. Even though you think it would be obvious when it drives us to hurt ourselves cause it's the only thing that eliviates the pain."

depression,fcubdle,t1_fcu9mlm,1577977023.0,"He should proably open up to someone. Doesn't have to be a therapist or nothing. I'm saying that because if you don't it will tear you up on the inside until it breaks you or someone can do something to cause him to snap which isn't good. The best thing you can do for him is just to be there I'm the same way. I always feel alone even though I have family, it could be because others may make him feel alone or something. Causing him to not feel any love or anything besides pain from everyone else. I'm speaking from experience. Sometimes just saying hi can make a difference even if they don't show it."
depression,fcu7sy2,t3_eiwhvu,1577974598.0,"Honestly keep messaging him asking if he is ok or something like that. Because for me it may piss me off that someone is always asking if I'm ok but it helps me slightly doubt the fact that I feel like no one cares. But he may not feel this way due to feeling alone. There are plenty of cases where people with good lives kill themselves. Some may feel worthless, unacceptes or just have depression for no reason besides it being an illness"
depression,fcu6jad,t3_eiwg4o,1577973747.0,"Honestly you should proabably go to a therapist to work on your trust issues. I can relate to most of this, my mom has torn me down and feel like shit when I was younger. People either took advantage of me or only talked to me when they wanted something. Like you people always say I'm smart but really I just put a little effort into it, so really people only talk to me if they need help at school. I've never felt accepted. This caused me to not talk to anyone really and prevents me from feeling love from family. The only time I can feel anything is if someone who isn't family acknowledges my existance. Which is really starting to screw me over becausr there is girl that I know likes me but I'm scared of getting hurt again so I don't say anything. So I'm in my sophmore year and have no one. Take ny advice, let someone if it's your girlfriend, friend, parent therapist, just let someone in. Trust me it will tear you up inside until you finally break which will only screw you over more."
depression,fb7qd7b,t3_ebx4dx,1576596920.0,"I wouldn't take it personally. It may seem that way, but it's just the depression. Some people push everyone away in fear they may hurt them others reach out. 

Another thing you have to understand is that depression is a mental illness that affects every aspect of life. Some days are good, other are hell. So it can also be he may not wanna talk because he may feel you may not understand. You can understand it's hard but you will never truely understand unless you've been there.

So my guess is he may not be talking to you because he may feel like a burden based on the sounds of things."
