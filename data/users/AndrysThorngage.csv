politics,ff71apq,t1_ff64y1f,1579639138.0,Shiff made this point today.  The truth will come out.  Whether it comes out in the impeachment trial or in tell all books and forced document releases from the freedom of information act is up to Republicans.
aww,feroi7s,t1_feri3z1,1579356517.0,"Once, I was in such a rush a didn’t get it on right in the front and it started to come off while I was driving. I was trying to shift, steer, and hold it down as I pulled over. Man, I loved that car."
insaneparents,fel908j,t1_fejsyb5,1579216681.0,"This is a form of child abuse. Threatening, damaging, or withholding possessions that have significance to a child with the intent to cause emotional distress is abuse. (Temporarily restricting access as a reasonable and proportional punishment is not.)"
funny,feiw54x,t3_epdgz1,1579148835.0,"My favorite piece of advice I ever received was from my aunt. I was pregnant with my first child and we were talking about natural childbirth and she said, “Honey, at the end of this they hand you a baby, not a medal.” She was so right."
thanksimcured,fei77rq,t1_fegsf6e,1579131824.0,"I was born in the 80’s. My parents felt awful that they hadn’t saved enough college money for my brother and I to go to school without loans like their parents did for them, but they couldn’t have. The cost grew faster than they could have possibly saved. They took out a loan to pay half and we did the same. They aren’t rich, so it was a big sacrifice that they made to help us have an education."

I voted for Kerry, but the guys wasn’t exactly inspiring and I wasn’t very politically aware yet. Later, I really got behind Obama during the Iowa caucuses and I felt a lot more passionate about my vote."

AskMen,fdm9n33,t1_fdkro30,1578543278.0,"I’m sooty you had to deal with that. My husband’s friend was being similarly harassed by a female student. The university would not do anything until he had a body of evidence (emails, photographs she sent him, eye witness accounts from colleagues of her showing up at his office, etc.) that showed her stalking him. The response would have been completely different had it been a male student harassing a female teacher."

AskReddit,fdhv9rv,t1_fdh851t,1578430771.0,"In grad school, my husband had an office mate/friend who was always excluding me from conversations. Whenever I would ask about something, he would say, “Don’t worry about it.” I’m not worried. You’re having a conversation in my house two feet away from me and I am trying to participate like a normal human. It was so dismissive."
politics,fdhu2p6,t1_fdgy805,1578430160.0,"My mom used to teach a huge project where students would research historical figures and do presentations in character. She had a list of off limits people, like Hitler (obviously) or Cleopatra, because of weird shit they did. Trump would totally be on that list. You don’t want a fifth grader researching about how he raped his wife and talked about dating his daughter."

technicallythetruth,fdanswy,t3_ekeqwq,1578248152.0,"I did take my husband’s name because I wanted to have the whole family have the same last name when we had kids. Most of the women I know who kept their names did it because they had established a career or published research under that name. I’m a teacher who got married at 22, so that’s not an issue for me."
todayilearned,fd41720,t3_ejwxed,1578163464.0,"I was the luckiest girl in the world. Born in ‘86. My dad never missed a dance recital, took me fishing, coached my soccer team, and listened to me talk endlessly. When I started playing volleyball, a sport he knew nothing about, he carried around the rule book and read it on his lunch breaks at work. He was, and is, the best dad, and I married a man just like him."

AskReddit,fcywcar,t3_ejdlbw,1578088514.0,"One of my bride’s maids pitched a fit that she wasn’t maid of honor. She was a good friend, but I was much closer to my roommate. The friend said that I should have picked her because my roommate has a sister and would never pick me as her matron of honor (five years later, she did, but I didn’t pick her because I wanted reciprocation). Her mother even wrote me a letter saying how much I’ve hurt her daughter and that my marriage was doomed to fail because I cared more about the wedding than the marriage. Still married 15 years later. My roommate is still my bff. Haven’t talked to the other friend since she visited me after I had my first baby and talked about herself for two hours before even asking about me or my son.  

Not nearly as terrible as some of the things here, but it was still time to cut out someone so selfish."
AskReddit,fcykzty,t1_fcun4hp,1578081927.0,Agreed. You are are a good match for her.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcvpo93,t1_fcuhk9j,1578007283.0,"When I was dating my husband, a man walked up to him in a bar and said “Let me dance with your woman.” Of course he said no, and this dude rounded up a big group of guys and threatened him. We left pretty quickly. It was such a weird feeling, though. We were just hanging out and suddenly we were being intimidated for no reason."
politics,fct8x49,t3_eipltg,1577936028.0,Is “attacked” the right word here?
AmItheAsshole,fct81ex,t1_fcqql44,1577935327.0,"Educator here: you want to maximize positive interactions. Specific, verbal praise for good behavior is best. For example, “Thank you for putting your dishes in the sink” or “I appreciate how you helped your sister.”  Move on quickly;don’t expect her to acknowledge or respond. Think about each positive interaction like putting a quarter in a piggy bank, building up a balance in your relationship with her. Ignore minor issues as much as possible.  Then, when you need to engage in a conflict, you have some “credit” to draw from. Also, by engage in conflict, I mean calmly correcting misbehavior by repeating expectations. Let her father handle discipline and consequences. Never become emotional.  Thirteen is a rough age."
AskReddit,fcsmwph,t1_fcre9th,1577919986.0,"Funny, because I have the opposite story with my husband! We met shortly before winter break in college. Our home towns are only 30 minutes apart. We had made plans to go sledding over the break and for him to meet my friends. He went out with his friends the night before and stayed out late. He called to say he was tired and would not make it, but I said that it was important to me that he meet my best friend (who was eventually one of his best friends, my maid of honor, and our daughter’s godmother). He got some coffee and got there. We all had a ton of fun.

Later, he told me that it was refreshing for him that I told him what I felt. His mom would always say things were okay, but actually be upset and retaliate in passive aggressive ways. He wasn’t used to such open communication."
