videos,ffda2jg,t1_ffd94sr,1579816398.0,What I saw was two dicks being dicks. The judge pulled rank and they went their seperate ways. Nothing more.

videos,ffcnvuo,t1_ffckpop,1579803453.0,"Allegedly following too close. Either was, the cop pulled over the car cuz he was feeling snubbed. All cars follow ""too close"" when the car in front is slowing and turning."
