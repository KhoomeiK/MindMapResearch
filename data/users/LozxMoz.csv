socialanxiety,fdmcsm1,t1_fdmciov,1578545791.0,"I usually fill my free time with hobbies like making music, and talking to some friends on discord, but we talk rarely. Its all about your mindset. I would start joining clubs or making plans with friends or start talking at lunch about interesting topics like games, movies, TV shows your currently watching, etc. Sitting in your room all day is not the worst thing in the world with YouTube being a thing now, but it just gets lonely after a while..."
socialanxiety,fdmcbru,t3_em4mbr,1578545401.0,"Yeah, pretty much a lot of people are disinterested in talking to me. But I keep my hopes up.

Also, I believe you can make friends. You can join a club which helped me get out more in High School, and, in college, I'm going to do the same thing."

teenagers,fd30sy6,t3_ejxqek,1578153687.0,I play Sekiro. The game helps you let out your anger on the controller.

Breath_of_the_Wild,fcv26o9,t3_ej2pan,1577993101.0,"Cook a lot of meals with added effects like increased cold resistance and increased attack power. Also, run away if you can't fight a powerful enemy or there are too many enemies. It's fine to run in this game. I do it all the time. Also, focus on shrines and getting their loot to increase your health/stamina. Make sure to listen to the lovely music :)

Be wary about wearing metal in lightning storms. Make sure to worry about the environment you're in. If it's too cold, you'll take damage. Get a horse if you can too. They help you a lot."
gameDevClassifieds,fcv136u,t1_fcuzxsu,1577992475.0,"Thank you, let me know when you have the game in a playable state. I center my music around gameplay. Thanks!"
teenagers,fcudcyr,t3_eizf8n,1577978312.0,"It's better to wait, but it's also good/necessary to get out of your comfort zone a bit and look for groups/clubs to join and have discussions with. I don't know, just my take on it."
gameDevClassifieds,fcucb4i,t1_fcubkjb,1577977633.0,"Understandable, but I'm just looking for some much needed experience at this point."
gameDevClassifieds,fctxk15,t1_fctuffn,1577964587.0,"Well, it's basically very easy to make in my case. Most of the songs can take up to 5-10 hours of work, and logic pro x provides a pretty good setup with everything on it. All I have is my midi keyboard and drums with my laptop and the software. And that's enough for me."

socialanxiety,fcs8v99,t1_fcs8eg3,1577913094.0,"Yeah, it's a little rude, but it may be their way of texting. Some people don't respond even to a nice message. It happened to me a couple times too where someone wouldn't respond even if I said merry Christmas, so it just happens."
socialanxiety,fcs8e2e,t1_fcrw9j7,1577912889.0,"Oh cool, I didn't know that about WhatsApp. I'm sure they appreciated the message  :)"
socialanxiety,fcru6hj,t3_eim8g2,1577906661.0,"I just think to myself that they either haven't seen it yet, or saw it and made a mental ""thank you"" without writing back. It just happens when you're texting instead of calling or chatting with them in person. It's not because you wrote it (It can happen to anyone, and a lot of times it happens to everyone), they either just forgot to send a message and appreciated the message, or they have not seen it yet. And it's perfectly fine to clarify. I would bet some people were actually glad for the clarification."
socialanxiety,fcrqo8o,t3_eileiu,1577905325.0,"If it was a club or group or even work, I would go up to that person, and tell them off, but that's how I am. Your situation...

I would take it up with the supervisor in that case. Or confront them and even though they try to deny it, use an audio/video recording of them saying or acting rude to your coworker. In special cases like yours, those people are only going to listen if they're either going to lose their job or get a written disciplinary note, or you catch their lies. Those type of people make life hell sometimes, and it seems no one wants to stop them. 

Thanks for standing up for people getting picked on. I hope everything goes well in the end."
socialanxiety,fcrn7bm,t3_eiksmj,1577904013.0,I wish it wasn't so... :(
