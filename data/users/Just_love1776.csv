Advice,ff53eel,t1_ff4jqaq,1579579139.0,Depends on what you accomplished I suppose. My friends resume was referring to a volunteer event where people replanted thousands of trees. It wouldnt quite fit to say you did it by yourself.
Advice,ff2vysr,t3_erc563,1579526239.0,"Looks like nobody has asked about if your resume is properly polished or if your attire is appropriate for your interviews. 

I was helping my younger friend with her resume awhile back and reminding her about how literally anything counts as experience. Applying for a kennel cleaning position? Well then if you owned pets growing up then you have experience with animals! You have experience fine detailing when cleaning. You can work independently and with a group. You probably also have experience with basic first aid or handling techniques for feisty cats. You can probably also stay organized and be self motivated.

For dress, its entirely appropriate to show up to a kennel cleaning job in comfy tennis shoes and scrubs, that way if they ask if you can start immediately, well yes you can! 

More points on your resume, dont ever say weak words like “i helped with...” say “part of a team responsible for...” 

Last point, keep a master resume/references list and fine tune individual resumes for each job you apply for. Obviously your strengths for kennel cleaning are going to be different than doing admin work."

All that changed was time and moving a lot. I moved jobs, moved cities, moved dating partners until i found the right person. I found hobbies i like and people to share them with.

Remember, the way people treat you is a reflection of them, not you!

You can change the way people perceive you by changing the way you dress, the best book i ever bought was titled “its the way that you say it” and it’s basically about all the factors of you that influence the way others treat you that have nothing to do with what your spoken wording is. Theres a whole chapter for short people like us haha!

Some tips: dress professionally, and i mean button ups and slacks and nice clothes with no wrinkles. You can automatically gain respect by just walking in the door. 

I used to wear a headband with a ponytail but it made me look like i was in middle school so i changed the way i did my hair too. 

Walk, stand, sit with confidence. Dont slouch or mumble, those are behaviors typically seem by high school kids and so people will see you as a kid. If you put confidence into the way you move your body, people will see you as a confident young adult.

Obviously basics for school supplies, but avoid fancy stuff. A 5 pack of highlighters and 2-3 good pencils for example rather than having a bunch of pencils and pens of different colors.

A good quality backpack that you can lug around campus. 

For clothes you really dont need an outfit for every occasion since your only pretty much doing school. 1 really nice outfit because you never know when you have a meeting with the dean or a date or something.

If you cant get a lock on your door, (which you could totally buy and install yourself btw) you can try and either blockade the door or if you’re careful you can hold the doorknob so that the other person cannot twist it, effectively manually locking the door yourself.

You can also try appealing to your brother’s friends, peer pressure is strong. Be careful tho because if his friends are also assholes then they will join in picking on you. 

Dont be home! Go to your friends houses, wake up earlier than him and go to the park or library. He cant pick on you if he cant find you.
