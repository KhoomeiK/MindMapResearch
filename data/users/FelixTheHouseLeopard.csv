As someone who's had multiple Alfas, a Mitsubishi L200, a Ford Transit, a couple of Fiat's and a 90's 300zx among some other stuff you're talking out your ass.

I bought my Transit brand spanking new and it was back at the dealer within 2 weeks for a front end knock - shit happens, move on. 6 months later it went back in and had a new gearbox put in, because you couldn't get it into 3rd.

Then it got electrical problems and I sold it.

So to your ""self-exclusion"" I'm sure many, many addicts are telling their dealers ""you know what, I want to put myself on the list so you don't serve me"". Why would a bookmaker ever want to deal with that?

There are schemes in place to help people who are in financial or personal difficulties - they've made it bright yellow & it says gambleaware on it. That's your voluntary exclusion.

You don't have to be a gambling addict to be in debt and using a method of escapism, so no it's not fair to anyone else to refund problem gamblers - that's a reward for good behaviour. You're teaching an addict: ""I can still get my fix because if it goes wrong there are no consequences"".

You need to deal with the underlying issues involved here and above all else the addict has to want to stop - you can't help someone that doesn't want a way out."
