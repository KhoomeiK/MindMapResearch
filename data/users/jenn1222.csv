If I were standing in line and some person just keeled over next to me, I'd be worried about that person.  When standing in line and several keel over, I'm worried about myself."

Personally, if someone needs help setting up a registration, I'll help them.  Thus far, most of our drivers are tech savvy enough to have figured it out.  

If you don't register though...we cannot let you drive until we get consent and then the query results back from FMCSA/DOT Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse."

Granted, I came here to transfer with my job up in Traverse City while in the middle of a divorce. The transfer fell through so I worked whatever jobs I could get.  Then I moved to Grand Rapids.  Honestly...there's not a lot of crime here, the cost of living is better than some places I've lived and there's a lot to do socially and for families.  The Grand Rapids area does offer quite a bit for some people.  I don't know if I'll stay here forever.  Personally, I'd rather be in the South again every winter.
