In my opinion Trump has really got them backed into a corner; either you go his way and accept his pussy-grabbing despicable nature as the figurehead of your party or you bail and get destroyed by his puppeteers. And when he's gone they will all try to jump on the ""I was never a big fan of Trump"" train but there will be incontrovertible evidence, and they will get buried. At least that's my hope. 

I'm looking forward to our biggest problem being Centrists forming the new right wing, while the real right wing is buried with confederate relics. At least that's my hope. I can't see how we could go further to the right at this point."

C_S_T,fek11z5,t1_feia1l9,1579190322.0,"Absolutely. The one thing I never see is a long term plan for society. An ideal to work towards, it's always at best a four-year plan. Which is why we can make progress and have it literally all taken away during the next administration.

I think we all know what the Right Wing long-term plan is. They seem to live in a world of fear and wild what-if speculations which require the leadership of a government that is both above the law and the only law, because, to them *only a strong leader can succeed.*

It's hard to imagine that we, as a population, are almost perfectly divided between people who want to be ruled and people who believe the people should rule. Maybe it's because they've been operating successfully from behind the scenes - changing rules in their favor, establishing tools to propagate propaganda -  for so long that they've skewed people's actual wants and needs or maybe it's just human nature."

Ironically those types of expectations (that I would be manly and play only with boys), and the belittling, are basically the reasons I didn't hang out with boys. I just didn't enjoy playing the stuff the boys played and frankly they were little assholes.

Kind of similar in a way but the characters are all living instead of living dead (it's kind of like the Warriors in a way). Although last night for the first time ever I found a loophole to get out - I was somehow turned into someone else who lived in another city. I was still me, but everyone saw me as the other person so I could just go take over their life in the other city. Not sure how I'd get out of the city to do that, but it felt like success at the time."
