ChoosingBeggars,ffc922s,t3_eslz16,1579794320.0,I'm sure they were flooded with offers.
toastme,ff9hxve,t3_es6gq4,1579713398.0,That is all HUGE. You made it happen. Keep making good things happen.
EntitledTeachers,ff6u2dy,t1_ff6ral8,1579634889.0,Off my chest maybe?
EntitledTeachers,ff69cc2,t3_ertpos,1579622172.0,Sorry you had to go through that. Being bullied is truly terrible.
dogpictures,ff30d0g,t3_er77l9,1579530263.0,That smile!
AmItheAsshole,ff02n5v,t3_eqxekx,1579464501.0,"NTA. You are totally in the right. Just as an aside though, if you don't enjoy kids' company you can't be a ""great"" auntie, merely a generous one.  There is nothing wrong with that. Good luck catching up on your work."
dogpictures,fevznji,t3_eqpfhx,1579403502.0,He looks ready to go to Hogwart's! üòÅ
fightporn,fen9nn0,t1_fem9x71,1579279987.0,"Very true but a teacher is taking a huge chance doing that. Even if they don't get hurt, they can get sued, lose their teaching license, get jail time, etc."
fightporn,fen9iiv,t1_femrjcy,1579279901.0,"Sadly, true."
fightporn,fem37qa,t1_fem348e,1579238263.0,Teachers aren't allowed to touch kids.
AmItheAsshole,felmzfq,t1_fel3y2v,1579226051.0,She is NOT a keeper.
Tinder,fekcugq,t3_epcyfj,1579197379.0,"If it is real, she has already told you that you can't be too nice or to available. This is a huge PITA since you can't relax and constantly have to be thinking and acting tactically. This would be a hard pass from me."
Tinderpickuplines,feios9c,t3_ep8r5x,1579143515.0,So what's your favourite kind of whatever?
Tinderpickuplines,fefgisl,t3_eosz36,1579055843.0,I'd love to trim your velvet.

ChoosingBeggars,fecmnmw,t3_eod31g,1578977706.0,"And they haven't learned a thing from getting arrested. Everyone else's fault. The store, the shelter, the manager, the police."
entitledparents,fe507t6,t1_fe2uzsg,1578864472.0,"High interest savings account is too easy for the parents to get into. All the assets should go into a trust and then the trust can open accounts, invest, etc."
howardstern,fdsf51g,t1_fdrxdic,1578701314.0,This was an amazing comment.

relationship_advice,fdi8tl0,t3_elc09u,1578437804.0,"""You're too sensitive, "" is the common refrain of insensitive assholes doing the wrong thing.  This will not get any better. Find someone who treats you well."
AmItheAsshole,fddtgsz,t3_eksd4l,1578323550.0,"Contact the 3 major credit reporting companies fraud departments to report this. Use whatever systems they have in place and KEEP PROOF that you did this. Put security freezes on all 3 reporting  accounts. These can be lifted, as needed, in the future.  Send certified letters to the power company and your bank explaining what happened.  Keep copies and receipts. File an identity theft report with local police and (I think) the FBI. This is as serious as you think. Best of luck and please keep us updated."

todayilearned,fcw6qpp,t3_ej4rim,1578018429.0,Genes don't cause body odor. Body odor is caused by bacteria that live on all human skin. The bacteria eat the sweat then poop. The bacteria poop smells. This is body odor. Bacteria poop.
ChoosingBeggars,fcvhav9,t3_ej16a5,1578002079.0,They didn't even promise expooooosuuure!
Tinderpickuplines,fcvh117,t1_fcts55e,1578001917.0,She is. If not she wouldn't put that in her bio.
AmItheAsshole,fcvgpli,t1_fcuibdy,1578001730.0,"Right. More kids is harder, not easier. If the kids don't get along great or are too far apart in age three isn't 3 times as hard - it is more like 9 or 10 times as hard. Not worth it at any price with such reactive and entitled parents."
Civilization6,fcrs5ld,t1_fcrkolq,1577905893.0,Thanks. Will try that when I can get my son to hand over the control.
