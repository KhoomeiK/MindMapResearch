The gear does not identify boats.

It identifies what region and fishery the gear was used in. That's it.

So if a whale becomes entangled, you can tell it was from lobster region 5 vs snow crab region 3, therefore allowing folks to know WHERE whales are being entangled because they don't know right now since they can move hundreds of miles while entangled. By knowing the problem areas, practices can be fine tuned in those areas to mitigate entanglements.

It is not designed in any way to identify individual boats, and if folks used their heads for even a second you'd realize how logistically complicated and expensive that would be from a color cording scheme tied to each one of thousands of boats - and would not solve anything because it's not like the whale is going to sue the boat or that fishing is illegal."

So if a whale becomes entangled, you can tell it was from lobster region 5 vs snow crab region 3, therefore allowing folks to know WHERE whales are being entangled because they don't know right now since they can move hundreds of miles while entangled. By knowing the problem areas, practices can be fine tuned in those areas to mitigate entanglements.

It is not designed in any way to identify individual boats, and if folks used their heads for even a second you'd realize how logistically complicated and expensive that would be from a color cording scheme tied to each one of thousands of boats - and would not solve anything because it's not like the whale is going to sue the boat or that fishing is illegal."
