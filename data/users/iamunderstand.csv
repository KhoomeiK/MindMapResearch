AskReddit,fdeoz0d,t1_fdeni9e,1578343599.0,"We're talking in circles, here. Clearly your police are the ""letter of the law"" type, with no room for leniency or humanity. My experience and others in my area has (anecdotally) been the opposite. That isn't to say we don't get tickets, I have, but if it's minor and they don't have a reason to nail you for anything serious, you can certainly get away with just a warning.

You also seem to be of the opinion that you should always fight to *not* pay for an infraction if you can get away with it, while I suggested that if you're in the wrong you deserve to pay it anyway. Civic duty and all that.

Police aren't supposed to be the enemy that you need to outwit to protect yourself. If they are, then your justice system is kinda messed up."

AskReddit,fdem6dg,t1_fdejft8,1578341959.0,"Sure, but being friendly and acknowledging you maybe didn't come to a full stop can earn you a verbal warning instead of an official citation as well. Making their job easier can help your case, I've seen it happen. They're just people. Public relations and community outreach are also part of their job, it's a lot harder to do their job if the community hates them, so they're given the authority to make a judgement call.

I don't know what it's like where you're from, but out here they're not hiding in bushes waiting to pounce on you. Police are funded by the government, and in a roundabout way their budget is determined by need, and need is determined by statistics, which comes from crime and citations so... I guess their salary is from tickets? But not really, that's kind of a weak chain of cause and effect. They don't get a raise for more tickets. Their job is to lower crime rates, not profit from them.

If your cops are power tripping assholes, for sure keep your mouth shut. But if they're just doing their job and you're in the wrong, be a good citizen and own up to it."
