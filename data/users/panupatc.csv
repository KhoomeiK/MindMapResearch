I personally don't think there's a best character for 2nd or x-th play through although the following character you may want to read up a bit if you pick them up as your first character - Julian, Monica and Sarah.

 Julian and Monica have this sequence quite early in the game where you were stuck in a cave which the boss CAN be too strong for you if you haven't grind up a bit before hand. I got stuck there back in SNES days

Sarah will lose certain character when reaching final dungeon, or if you pick her up as part of your group you will lose her. This happened on my first run that I reached final dungeon, making the whole experience unbearable (her spot was force replaced by a certain character you cannot recruit unless main Sarah, meaning he would be vastly under power for such place)"

Who would have expected this show to be this deep... we were not aware that we actually barely knew anything about Kabae in S1 at all and the show was so good at not making us notice. EXACTLY what happened to Resasuke too - we barely knew him. Like at all. We only viewed most characters shallowly through Retsuko but they all have more personality behind what's presented though her point of view and its only when you sit down and think about it that Retsuko's weak point become apparent: she was too caught up in her own little world that everything and everyone around her were reduced to only what she thought about them.
