chess,ffywbkg,t3_evs0md,1580356768.0,"For those keeping score at home, quadrupled pawns require no less than 4 pawn captures to assemble. Quintupled pawns require 6 captures, followed by 9 captures for sextupled, 12 for septupled, and finally 16 captures (impossible) for octupled pawns.

Come to think of it, octupled pawns are impossible on the physical board, and septuplets would end in a promotion."

chess,ffimlt1,t1_ffik0ok,1579977495.0,"This was really big for me. The position of the enemy King means not only the square it's on, but all the squares around it. If you're able to trap the King, mate is often just around the corner and your opponent may have to sacrifice a lot of material to prevent it. Not every move needs to be a check, but every move should have a clear purpose."

Seems to be a pretty simple game, but people reacted very positively towards it."
gaming,ffglp6a,t1_ffg98zu,1579909136.0,"I could see this working in some cases, but not all. Some players like the feeling of being over (or under) powered relative to the content they're facing.

Check out some SL1 runs of Dark Souls to see what I mean. These players have mastered the game so completely that they take on the challenge of never leveling up their character at all. Now imagine how silly it would be if that meant the bosses were also set to ""level 1"" on the boss-o-meter.

Scaling bosses to the player's level also creates a weird feedback loop. Really skilled players will reach content at a faster pace, and receive easier challenges as a result. On the other hand, less skilled players might try to level up a bit before the next boss, only to run into an enemy that has leveled up right with them."

**Pandemic** - co-op, save the world from infectious disease by treating it in affected areas and working together towards a cure. A great puzzle that's never the same twice.

**Dominion** - Each player starts with an identical deck of cards, and over the course of the game customizes their strategy by purchasing new cards from a (modular) shared market. The ultimate goal is points, often obtained by combining the effects of multiple cards into huge turns. So satisying."

gaming,fcsyq0t,t1_fcsu106,1577928456.0,"Practice! Save right before a fight and try to stay alive for as long as possible at close range without getting hit. Don't worry about damaging it when you're learning, just stand there and wait for him to telegraph an attack, then dodge properly. Backflips are your friend at close range and against the galloping swipe, and a side jump is best against their charge attack.

All-out offense is very risky, best to read the attack and then punish it.

Repeat until you know the tells and how best to avoid each attack. Lynels do a lot of damage, but don't actually have that many different moves and the wind-ups are not terribly fast. Once your defense is sound, adding in some damage is easy.

Also, cook up lots of durian for the full heal and some attack bananas for extra damage.

I spent 10-15 minutes practicing Lynels and now they're easily my favorite fights in the game. Did the same with Guardians, learning the sound queue until I could parry them with my eyes closed. It's not nearly as difficult as you might think.

Good luck and happy hunting!"
