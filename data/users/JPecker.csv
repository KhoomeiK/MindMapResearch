Unsure if I even have a reason to be depressed. I didn’t deploy, wasn’t shot at, or blown up. I never had to kill anyone, but I did work in the medical side (orthopedics and rehab) and all I saw all day was death and carnage and mostly the aftermath of what men will do to each other. It’s hard to even write about it bc it brings up so many hard feelings and dark thoughts. I always compared myself to other service members that actually got to deploy, had real reasons to be sad or disturbed, I feel like they were the real hero’s. I never felt like I actually contributed bc I wasn’t deployed I was just in hospitals. My superiors used to make me feel like a failure because I didn’t deploy (which has always been embarrassing) or I couldn’t make rank fast enough, I actually was involuntarily separates bc of this (I suck at test taking)."

It’s hard when you can’t help but compare yourself to other parents and constantly feel like you’re not providing for your family like some of the parents who are well off.

I know it’s just money but all I want is for my family to be happy and want for nothing.
