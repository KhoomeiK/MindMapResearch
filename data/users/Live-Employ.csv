bestof,ff2od56,t1_ff25jve,1579516202.0,I’m so sorry this happened to you!!
bestof,ff2nvh4,t1_fezp9w5,1579515453.0,"This happened to me! I started becoming suicidal. But then realized I didn’t want my life to end, I wanted how my life was to stop and that was the precursor to wanting out of the relationship"
bestof,ff2nt6h,t1_ff0m146,1579515350.0,"Super kind of you to offer to buy someone a copy !!! I’m making my way through my copy & it’s so spot on it’s really hard for me. Like at one point I had a panic attack because I felt crushed by the weight & reality of how the abuse has been so much more than the few physical assaults but was also emotional, financial, spiritual etc"
CasualConversation,ff2n8ot,t3_eqyc25,1579514466.0,This is my favorite thing I read today! Keep touching salt shakers & being you!!!
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,ff2mtdi,t3_erao4a,1579513804.0,I agree- it seems like the Nex always wins. It’s damaging the kids & I just want to run away
CPTSD,ff2lre8,t1_ff26jdh,1579512170.0,Yes! Reading used to be my favorite thing & I feel this is something he has robbed from me. I want it back! Which workbook?
LifeAfterNarcissism,ff1xc9g,t1_ff1wsky,1579488323.0,Thank you !
LifeAfterNarcissism,ff1tdoy,t1_ff1loay,1579485750.0,This was super helpful!! Right now I find the body keeps score too triggering but maybe I can follow someone on IG re:boundaries because I really struggle with that
CPTSD,ff1t141,t1_ff1cxsp,1579485529.0,This is interesting & I think you may be on to something- > addressing basic needs first
CPTSD,ff1svhm,t1_ff0o3ra,1579485431.0,"I have been unable to read it also. Too triggering. I also am trying to read, ‘Why Does He Do That?’ by Lundy Bancroft ... about abusive men ...and it caused a panic attack, it was so on point."
CPTSD,ff1sp0d,t1_ff1ft39,1579485318.0,Such good points!!! And as both a POC & a woman i experience this with both mental health professionals AND physical health professionals. It’s exhausting to always have to be on the defensive before you can even have any hope of getting help to get better. And then when I say it’s hard to trust it gets blamed on me like I’m ‘playing the race card’ or ‘the woman card’.
bodyweightfitness,fe6tean,t1_fe64q06,1578904579.0,Thank you

LifeAfterNarcissism,fe5x8nf,t1_fe5tm2s,1578876976.0,"This is me too. Each week when I see him to exchange our son for court ordered visitation, sets me back and I can’t go on like this"

todayilearned,fe1hth8,t1_fdwwm3e,1578826708.0,"Yes! The last time someone asked me if my infant was sleeping through the night, I laughed and walked away. Figured such a dumb question didn’t even deserve a response"
todayilearned,fe1hebm,t1_fdx0iuf,1578826532.0,Yes! They also sell them - called hands free pumping bra. I got one on a lightening deal on amazon for $6. But either way they are definitely a lifesaver
todayilearned,fe1fbub,t1_fdvelks,1578825922.0,If you take the oligosaccharides from bovine milk do they help with the gut bacteria in humans? Interesting thing to contemplate. Do they contain the milk proteins that so many babies are allergic to?
todayilearned,fe1ep0g,t1_fdvlynf,1578825659.0,"This is so true! And also we feel guilty for not producing enough milk AND not producing enough work. Sometimes to compensate for the milk we get up in the middle of the night to pump. (We In this case is many moms in my mom group) but the sleep deprivation takes its toll on everything else - work, relationships, etc 

I’m not back to work yet and am staying out 6 months. I am only able to do this because I’m of ‘advanced maternal age’ and have been at my job 17 years and have a ton of leave I’ve never used. We don’t have any paid maternity leave where I work. 

However I want to continue nursing and I’m really stressed and worried about pumping & commuting and everything else."
todayilearned,fe1d825,t1_fdvcoa1,1578825201.0,Love this!!! Reading this thread while breastfeeding my 5 month old.
todayilearned,fe1civt,t1_fdxe2mu,1578825038.0,This is true. Having a lactation consultant can be very helpful for those who are struggling but not everyone’s insurance covers it.
DoesAnybodyElse,fe1b48a,t3_en4cfr,1578824577.0,Yes & for me one thing that made me realize the depth of my trauma while trying to get out of an abusive marriage while pregnant is that the music has stopped. The silence is so painful to me. It’s like the loneliness has taken a physical shape and is suffocating me.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fdm8tjs,t3_em2jdk,1578542663.0,"This! Even when you get out, they’re still in. This is where I am now and it’s hell."

Divorce,fd9pzko,t3_ekcj6p,1578236595.0,This was my marriage too. Proud of you for getting out!
raisedbyborderlines,fd9pq8n,t3_ekbrp2,1578236485.0,Bingo!
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fd2t4qt,t3_eji31c,1578151367.0,I agree about him making me look crazy! Is 15 minutes late sufficient to report?

KindVoice,fd21ir0,t1_fd20amz,1578140210.0,It’s still new! Have you made any friends in your political activity? I used to be very active in local politics and met some really great people. Am not active right now because I’m going through a divorce and have a new baby at the same time. But some of those friends I made back doing mundane things like canvassing and phone calls have been there for me now in my struggles. Kudos to you for trying something new! Keep it up! Keep trying new things!
NarcissisticAbuse,fd20u0i,t1_fd0k0wc,1578139886.0,Omg !!! This is a huge revelation for me too!! #same in every way. On his own he had nothing
KindVoice,fd1xw08,t3_ejtg6c,1578138536.0,Sorry this is happening- plz don’t give up! Was it the trying out politics that you thought would make things better?
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fd1wngs,t1_fcxvi23,1578137974.0,When people say document violations of agreements what does this mean? Just write it down? File a police report? I’m going through this now & just I’m lost
CPTSD,fd1w9vw,t1_fcvk61x,1578137803.0,"Ugh and I’m supposed to see my parents today & dreading it. Both because I’m wondering what heinous crap she will say to me & also, why doesn’t my dad ever stick up for me?"
Empaths,fd1w3ko,t1_fcvx2mr,1578137732.0,"Yes!!! This is one of my New Years resolutions actually - staying calm with her. I figure if she’s struggling to find her way, and I’m panicking, that definitely is NOT helpful!"
CPTSD,fd1vgfb,t1_fczp2gf,1578137445.0,"Thank you so much for posting this! I need to hold some boundaries with my own parents today and you inspired me!  I get those feelings too and it usually stops me but the fact that you did it anyways, that’s just awesome!!!"
CPTSD,fd1um7u,t1_fcztvir,1578137062.0,"This comment was super helpful as I’m trying to learn boundaries too & when triggered I struggle with what to say.

To OP, good for you!!!! Don’t fix it & don’t go! I’ve been in a similar situation where I tried to go for my nieces & it turned out horrible- first off it wrecked me emotionally and secondly I realized that my nieces were also being groomed as flying monkeys ..."
CPTSD,fcvkcrt,t3_ej0ixo,1578003948.0,I’ve had to intentionally reach out and begin to form community- sometimes I have to force myself because it feels unnatural but it has been so worth it
CPTSD,fcvihy9,t3_ej0ixo,1578002801.0,"I relate to this so much - both in my upbringing and in my marriage which is now ending after he escalated the emotional abuse to physical and assaulted me while pregnant. At first my parents were the only ones I told & leaned on for help but once I also started therapy I started to realize how messed up not just my relationship with my husband was but also with my mom. I was pregnant, on bedrest and my mom was telling me that her situation was worse as I was putting her through so much pain as my mother. Crazy huh?"
Empaths,fcvguoj,t1_fcn38cl,1578001812.0,"Oh and also, I think she feels the same as you about therapy- just tired of talking about it when it’s not changing"
Empaths,fcvgn71,t1_fcn38cl,1578001690.0,"This is super helpful! How old are you now? Since she’s been so hesitant to drive, I got her a good bike last spring and you’re right- she really enjoyed it in spring & summer. Now it’s pretty cold & snowy but I hope she enjoys it again. I will admit I kept asking her to practice driving but I’ve stopped. I haven’t asked in a couple months."
Empaths,fcvg0a1,t1_fcmylxx,1578001309.0,So glad you guys are close now!
CPTSD,fcnckt2,t3_ei2e3g,1577808794.0,I’m going through a horrible divorce & want to change my name but can’t figure out what to change it to. I took his last name when we got married & now we have a child together. But I also have two daughters from before him so I don’t know what last name to use and I’m sad every time I hear it.
Divorce,fcmt398,t3_ehyy3z,1577790924.0,Definitely open your own (secret) bank account. Start putting any cash possible in there & don’t spend it. Another thing I did as part of my exit plan was I bought $25 grocery gift cards every time I went to the grocery store for a long while. So now I’m using those to buy food. I also have a five month old baby boy.
Anxietyhelp,fcms397,t3_ei0tmg,1577789499.0,"I’m sorry this happened & that you didn’t get advise from the nurse. I feel like often you will get the advice to exercise at the doctors. And exercise is really good! But nutrition really makes a difference. If you ever find that you’re exercising but not losing weight, try also paying attention to what you eat. I have struggled with weight a big part of my life and I remember feeling like the doctors thought I was lying when I described how much I exercised and still didn’t lose weight. At any rate then I got into holistic nutrition and things got a whole lot better. And I wasn’t starving and miserable."
CPTSD,fcmrqxx,t3_ehrxh6,1577789005.0,Wow! I never thought about this before but I can so relate to this.
CPTSD,fcmod3r,t1_fcb4ct9,1577784171.0,Thank you sooo much! Very kind!
Empaths,fcmobe8,t1_fc903fh,1577784104.0,How old is your son?? Please tell me you guys are close? I really want a good relationship with my daughter. I hope your son appreciates your humor!
Empaths,fcmo9aw,t1_fc9f5cn,1577784022.0,I’m not sure why you got down votes on it but I can definitely relate to the healing yourself. I’m glad you found the source of what was causing the problems
Empaths,fcmo7lt,t1_fc95aeo,1577783956.0,"Interesting, i haven’t looked into this but when she was younger I was able to keep her on a structured schedule and control her foods -> avoiding dyes & chemicals etc and it honestly did make a difference. Now that she is a teen, when she’s not with me she eats so much crap it’s like I’m fighting an uphill battle.  I definitely think that many of us have something that is a total drag on their immune system & psyche such as you with the mercury, my daughter is very affected by dyes in foods, for me it’s dairy. Even though I don’t show up as allergic but only lactose intolerant in whatever test they do at the doctors. Eliminating dairy drastically improved my intractable migraines & my GI issues to the point I’m not taking any daily medications any more. 

Unfortunately my daughter won’t listen to me on the nutrition front right now. She does at least still eat whatever I make at home. It’s just the crap she eats when she’s not home."
Empaths,fcmnyms,t1_fca2j1i,1577783606.0,I’m really sorry you went through this. I do think this sounds like her - that everything is frustrating so why try. What were the things most frustrating to you if it’s ok to ask?
Empaths,fcmnvhj,t1_fc9upq3,1577783483.0,"So she had a dog that she said she loved but she started not walking her, feeding her, interacting with her... when I would intervene, she’d get mad? 

This is her 4th year varsity soccer & basketball. Her soccer coach kept recommending her for club soccer (higher level of play) & offering to help her with the college recruiting process. She would say she was interested and then when it was time for her to attend an event or follow through on something, she would refuse. 

I had her in art lessons for 8 years - she’s an amazing Artist! The folks there were trying to help her put together a portfolio to send to colleges. At 13 she was rec’d to take a summer class at a college an hour away from us. I took her every day. She got college credit. Said she enjoyed it... but now refuses any art class/instruction. Any thing I suggest or offer to take her to.

She used to do dance pretty avidly... she stopped that. 

There’s more but I keep trying to help her find her ‘thing’, like what she enjoys. But it seems the harder I try, the more she refuses but then complains her life is boring."
Empaths,fcmnmea,t1_fc96csy,1577783133.0,"Omigosh! I am an avid essential oil user, even got certified. She refuses them too! But you’re right, I can use for myself. She used to be game for it, I set her up with her own diffuser, made her many roller balls.. but now she won’t use. 

But yes to anxiety- especially when it comes to school. That’s why we had the therapist & tutor."
Empaths,fcmnhos,t1_fc93uwf,1577782951.0,"Thank you so much. I really want to comfort her but can’t tell if she finds me comforting any more. This is going to probably sound very idiotic but lately when we are together and she’s just quiet, I try to tell her corny jokes. She groans & rolls her eyes. But i run out of things to say when she’s always silent and I really don’t want all of our interactions to be either me telling her to do chores/homework or us fighting.

I think I’m getting through a little bit because even though to me she says the jokes are awful, recently her older sister (who was away at college when I started this) said she heard about ‘joke time’. So maybe she enjoys it but just doesn’t want me to know? Is that a teen thing??"
Empaths,fcmn4x3,t1_fc903fh,1577782464.0,"Lol you’re funny about the drivers!!! Yea the therapist didn’t suggest until years in. But I hear you, it definitely wasn’t the first ( or 2nd or 3rd...etc) thing we tried. 

I’m willing to do anything to help but so frustrated when everything I try is rebuffed- even the things she wants.

Another example is when she wants to go do something with friends - she can be super excited& happy about it, but still late which is aggravating to me as her ride and to her friend who she had specific plans with. Not that it’s ok but I totally get it if you drag your feet to clean the toilet; but I don’t get it when it’s for what she wants to do, when she wants to do it."
Empaths,fcmmzz7,t1_fc8ez5x,1577782276.0,Good to know I’m not the only one!!

Divorce,fcmmiyx,t3_ehov4b,1577781640.0,Your brunch sounds amazing ! I’m struggling with the loneliness - I wanna be your friend!
Empaths,fc8yc9v,t1_fc8vtt3,1577544063.0,"It’s interesting that you mention the giving & the responsibility. I’ve started trying to analyze myself to see where I’m not actually helping but maybe enabling if that makes sense. One small example ... I started 11/1 saying she has to be responsible for getting herself up in time to work. Lots of tears & anger saying she couldn’t do it. But I held my ground, told her I believe in her. She was late a few times but is in a better routine now. It’s only once a week. I think she also is getting some self esteem from working there & learning to be a good team member. 

I also cannot tell you how many times her school talked down to me thinking I was ridiculous for not medicating her. When she was younger, keeping a strict routine helped a lot. But now she doesn’t want me to help but also gets overwhelmed with keeping track of everything. And I feel like the meanest mom in the world watching her struggle."
Empaths,fc8ufq4,t1_fc8rz2x,1577542153.0,"The medication was recommended by her pediatrician, therapist, tutor & some teachers - they said we should give it an honest try since we have tried everything else.

Sadly I can’t say my teen years were anything to compare. I was never like this to my parents - not because I’m so great but because they beat us all the time. So I spent most of my time trying to keep them happy & avoid their wrath...."
Empaths,fc88mhh,t1_fc88di2,1577529332.0,"I think she doesn’t accept herself. I’ve pretty much always maintained- you are not your grades and that not every subject will come to us instantly but just don’t give up. So the negative part wouldn’t be from me. As an aside, when she does & turns in her schoolwork, she always gets A’s & B’s. She only gets into the failing zone when stuff isn’t turned in."
Divorce,fc88dgk,t3_egn7f9,1577529160.0,Definitely consult a lawyer but take the money out before filing for divorce because assets will be frozen once she files
Empaths,fc870cf,t1_fc86uhv,1577528279.0,Yes. I totally get what you’re saying. Will go back to drawing board with therapy- maybe a different one
CPTSD,fc86vqb,t1_fc6ihwj,1577528197.0,Omg I think this is what my daughter struggles with -> doesn’t do stuff & makes her own life harder. And just wanting to be left alone in self loathing. And I’m so worried about her. My reminders make her mad. My letting her be let’s things get worse. I don’t know how to help her. She’s in high school. This year she’s refusing to go to therapy. Refusing to go to tutor. Refusing to finish college apps. Just everything. I’m so sad for her and at wits end. But omg you guys underneath the angry exterior she’s so kind & nurturing. She’s a great writer. A great artist. Strong & athletic. When she smiles it lights up the universe. I don’t know how to help her get past this
Empaths,fc868l7,t1_fc860vk,1577527784.0,What do you do though when the person refuses to go? She has even told me it was helpful in the past but refuses to tell me why she won’t go now. I’ve offered to find a different therapist too? She won’t budge. Refuses to get in the car
Empaths,fc85ybq,t1_fc85u7z,1577527602.0,Oh yes! I’ve been taking her the past 4 years. We tried about 7 different ones initially. I let her choose the one she was comfortable with. But she has started refusing to go these past few months.
CPTSD,fc837gz,t1_fc5lja1,1577525744.0,This!!! Starved of empathy & compassion. This is where I have been for so long
raisedbyborderlines,fc44c9j,t3_efvge1,1577406298.0,Mine gave me a book about the problems encountered in deciding to create a museum. Umm what?? Mind you I’m going through a divorce with 3 kids. I don’t even want anything for myself. Just like diapers? I’m also in the middle of moving and hurt my shoulder. My mom got mad at me for taking a break washing dishes. Why did I even go there ??? Zero support. Zero compassion. She kept trying to convince me that she is more tired. I’m not in competition with anyone but I have had a hell of a year and should be able to say I’m tired.
BreakUps,fc2ecy2,t3_efr4cg,1577355314.0,I feel like such trash even though I’ve worked super hard to rebuild. I bought a condo. I’ve made new friends. I am hurting so much though why am I not enough to be loved ?
