Mavericks,ffap4zp,t3_eroq2m,1579741200.0,"Unfortunately this is the state of mental health treatment in our country.  Unless the person gets help, they have serious mental issues.  Once they get medical help and medicine, if they don’t stay on them, they revert right back to the same issues.  

The law can only go so far as far as treating mentally ill people.

I have a relative with these type issues and if it weren’t for my family, they would be lost and homeless.  

I view homeless people with a much more sympathetic eye these days."
pettyrevenge,ffadnic,t3_esat25,1579733102.0,"My wife had a guy come up to her in high school and tell her she was ugly.   She was mortified, of course, and was left in tears.  Her dad had recently passed away and it really left a scar.

A couple of years ago she friended him on FB just so she could post in his page for all to see that not only did she remember him, but that she remembered how mean he had been to her in high school.   She went on to comment that she noticed from his pics that he had gotten fat and bald at a pretty young age.

golf,ffa6p2p,t3_esbthj,1579728938.0,"The best golf story about anger was via a buddy of mine:

He was teeing off, playing by himself.  This guy drives up almost to his tee box, jumps out, pulls his golf bag off of the cart and throws it in the adjacent pond.  Guy jumps back in the cart and drives away very fast.

My buddy was still standing on the tee box kind of shocked and all of a sudden, the golf cart makes a u-turn and starts coming back.  So my buddy thinks the guy has calmed down and is going to get his bag.  

The guy pulls up, gets out of the cart, waded into the water, finds the bag, lifts it up, unzips the bag and pulls out his wallet and keys.  He then throws the bag even further out into the pond, walks to the cart, gets in, does another u-turn and drives away.

My buddy said he just stood there the whole time and didn’t dare say a word....."

Astros,ff4awct,t3_eq9t6l,1579559353.0,"I unsubscribed today from The Rangers.  As a fan of both (I have lived in both DFW and Houston for 29 years each), I just finally had enough of the b.s..  The Rangers fans are convinced that the only reason the Astros ever win at all is because of this.

Of course, the Rangers have been losing because of this, too.  Has nothing to do with a crappy GM, lack of quality starting pitching or bullpen, and above all, the fact that our great White hope is a guy that is a .211 lifetime hitter that strikes out 4 times out of 5 who had his first Sac fly of his major league career after being in the bigs 5 years.  Has nothing to do with playing such crappy baseball that I can’t even watch them anymore and haven given up my season tickets.  

Proof is in the pudding to see how the Astros hitters respond this year.  For selfish reasons, I hope they all have lifetime years, that would certainly silence a lot of folks."

However, for the last 25 years he has been trying to prove to everyone that he was the reason that the Cowboys won 3 Super Bowls, bit the fact is he just isn’t a football guy.  His ego will not let him admit it and we as cowboy fans have suffered for that shit.  Jerry might write the checks, but it was solely JImmy that brought the talent that won those super bowls.

On the other hand, if you can discount having to cover the plate for a fastball and know an off speed pitch is coming, then you are ahead of the game as a hitter.
