I don't get these people who think that having a vaginal delivery somehow trumps a C-section. You won't be having the baby prematurely, you won't somehow fail to be a mother, and it isn't really the easier option as both have their own set of complications and benefits."

Talk to your local Social Services office, they often have options other than WIC. Imagine my surprise when I didn't qualify to get food stamps but did qualify to have my electric bill paid for 2 months. 

If it is a company like Enfamil or Similac, you and all your friends and family should sign up to get coupons. They will send out $15.00 or $20.00 fairly often.  I got them long after I was finished with formula and would give them to friends or offer them to people in mom's groups on Facebook. Also contact them, CALL the customer service line and tell them your situation, they may send samples or once in a lifetime super coupons."

offmychest,fei1ou0,t3_ep79r2,1579128348.0,"Not a hunter, but I come from a family of hunters. Literally 90% of my family hunts.  Dad, Uncles, Brother, Aunts, Sisters, Nephews, Nieces, Cousins, etc. EVERYONE. So again, this is coming from a non-hunter.

The thrill of the hunt. I have been on the land my family hunts and heard the dogs give chase and seen the deer charge right through where everyone was eating lunch.  Seriously, Maybe 20 yards from the picnic table where we were eating. They guys were laughing they weren't grabbing guns or anything but that rush, hearing it coming, the anticipation of that deer shooting out of the woodline, the guys were pointing to where they thought the deer would emerge, watching for it. Such a rush.  

Notice how I said above, everyone eating lunch? There is a camaraderie. The guys talk, joke, enjoy hanging out together. There is a lot of solitude to hunting but there is the getting together doing something with everyone, some competition, some just being around people that like the same things you do. I take my kids out to the land a couple times a year to spend time with ""the guys"" (although the girls are there too.) They have a meal and then go sit on a stand with their grandpa, uncle, cousin, whatever. Until they are too wiggly or talkative.  They build memories. 

There is something about bringing home food you actually harvested on your own. It's probably like I'm pretty pleased with myself when I pick berries for several hours then turn it into jams, jellies, syrups. I am doing something to provide for my family. Not only that, there are a lot of hunters I know that will stock their freezers and donate meat to people that need it in the community.  A lot of my family prefers wild game over store bought meats. Antibiotic free, growth hormone free, completely free range meat. 

There is still probably something primal about killing your own food. Not just killing. My family that hunts are generally extraordinarily compassionate regarding animals. My dad hiked MILES in the snow to save a hawk that my brother found. Dad called the game warden and went to save the hawk caught in an illegal trap. He won't have mouse traps that kill. He saves kittens. He has helped me steal a dog from someone that was mistreating their dog. One branch of my family runs a wildlife rescue and have saved all sorts of animals from ducks to deer. My family is pretty close to nature, appreciate the beauty around them and are somewhat in awe of animals.  We all teach our kids to respect nature, that there is a reason for every animal and that killing just to kill isn't right. 

I don't know if this helps at all. Like I said, I am not a hunter. I just go off what I see in my own little world."

SingleParents,fdmjj4l,t3_em45kg,1578552215.0,"Taking care of a child temporarily is way different than having kids. He's being a good parent to his daughter by helping her mom and sibling. It's stressful enough for a young kid to have an ill parent they aren't able to see, even worse if they are separated from their sibling because of it. 

If they have a positive relationship while co-parenting then it's good for the daughter. He's showing his daughter what a caring and compassionate man is, which can influence her future relationships with men 

He may develop a relationship with the ex's new child like a favorite uncle, which wouldn't hurt anyone. Just because he doesn't want to be a father again doesn't mean he's going to avoid all children."
AskReddit,fdm9gl3,t3_eluch8,1578543141.0,"Post C Section hemorrhaging. I had been out of surgery long enough to no longer feel the effects of the spinal block when I felt a huge clot come out. I called the nurse my head felt funny, my feet went numb. Next thing I have a room overrun with nurses and doctors, getting a ""uterine massage"" which is basically getting fisted while they press down on your stomach which, in this case, was just cut open less than 5 hours earlier. Nurse McFisty was on her knees in between my legs to get enough leverage as she was pushing down on my stomach. She was neither gentle nor loving as she displayed her torture technique for the room. One doctor is telling them to give me morphine, another is saying to wait on the morphine, which I could only guess was because she was sadist or in case I needed to go into surgery or something. OMG the pain. 
A nurse (God bless this woman) had thought I was bleeding too much earlier had gotten a certain drug for helping hemorrhaging sent up 30 minutes prior to keep on hand ""just in case."" So the drug was injected fairly quickly.  No transfusion needed but I was kept in bed for an additional 24 hours before I could get up and walk."

Also, every church I have attended was independent and doesn't have a governing body to ""move priest/pastors/preachers around."" Preachers might leave a church to go somewhere else but not at the demand of an overseeing board. They can be fired but that is done through the deacons. Hiring has to be done by a church wide vote. There is actually a ton of research, background checks, interviews with members of their current church, it's crazy. Like the FBI of religious wingnuts. So, it's never been another board somewhere off in another place calling up and saying, ""Hey, you are getting a new Sunday school teacher in two weeks. 

Absolutely, every denomination and religion is going to have people that take advantage of their power. Speaking with my friend who is a detective, they stated that the biggest problems are the pop-up churches. In her words, pedophiles will find a way to gain access to children, churches, sports, Chuck E Cheese, WalMart kid's department. Pop-up churches are desperate to have members, desperate for people to volunteer. They also tend to be in poorer areas or in areas with a large number of people that may not speak English. In other words, the more vulnerable populations. People tend to trust those in a church setting and let their guards down when it comes to their kids safety and they shouldn't."

Being saved doesn't change that you are human, with human emotions, human temptations and human failures. Being saved is accepting that you are a sinner and you need forgiveness for your sins to enter heaven.
