The ability for the Saudis to demand a blood sacrifice to continue the deal not only compromises the US government for hinging their budget on that deal, but also means that anyone is fair game to be killed if it means more weapon sales.

That's probably a safe start. This is all public record, as he served in government for years and has been on the record saying these things. I've provided a number of different sources here, just to verify. It's really just a matter of googling, though. 

I think one of the most damning pieces of evidence that this is not a matter of 'whoops, didn't know they were like that' is that, not only has he had countless opportunities to clear the record, but he also has blatantly stated the exact same sentiments publicly over the years."

My point was that there wasn't even an attempt at diplomatic intervention until it was too late because, again, some people sympathized with Germany due to the absolutely castrating effect of Versailles, and some because they severely underestimated Hitler's barbarity and psychopathy. 

Like I said, I feel that a lot of the Nazis reputation was created posthumously to justify earlier inaction. Of course, hindsight is 20/20 and WWI had everyone reeling at this point, so it's understandable to me, but it was probably an easier sell to the public that Hitler was a supervillain.

As for Germany's capability, there is no doubting that. It's simply the Nazis incompetence I was commenting on. after WWI, Germany actually had a ton of extremely experienced soldiers and military commanders, many of which, IIRC, were frequently ignored or passed over by Hitler in favor of sycophants. Had they had a different leader or party in control (like, say, Bismark), WWII would have gone a completely different way."
pics,ff2hth2,t1_ff2hbwo,1579506753.0,"Yeah, I'll give them the uniforms, but yeah, that's it. 

I mean, I feel like a lot of people after the war tried to make them 'worthy opponents' by promoting ideas like Hitler's genius or how the 'trains ran on time', but it was all completely bullshit. The reason they succeeded early on was because the rest of the world, still nervous about the terms of Versailles, gave the Nazis a lot of leeway and underestimated them (likely due to Hitler's brash and bombastic personality). He wasn't even elected; he was appointed by Hindenburg after a failed election due to him being viewed as a compromise because of his fringe status.

There are so many horrible, stupid decisions; invading Russia prematurely, declaring war on the US early, refusing to fallback to a defensive position in Africa, turning on the peasants in Russia due to ridiculous pseudo-science (the peasants actually were super supportive of the Nazis, seeing them as liberators, but once they started rounding them up, they became the dread partisans that helped stall the Nazi-war-machine in Russia), abandoning the three pronged attack in Russia, failing to commit as much recon to Russia as they did to France (I mean, they didn't know about the T-34), etc. The list goes on and on.

I guess explaining that the Nazis atrocities happened because the West refused to act early on due to their guilt over Versailles and their underestimation of Germany is not as Romantic as a brilliant psychopath and his army of black cloaked soldiers suddenly springing an attack through trickery and brutality."

Nazis are coward pussies who are afraid of women and children, they have a philosophy that is equal parts 1800's pseudo-science and fantastical historical revisionism, and to top it all off, they were one of the biggest failures (for reference, their '1000 year reich' last less than a decade, compared to the War on Terror, which has been going almost 20 years).

funny,feophtr,t3_eq7hw3,1579303521.0,"I mean, yes, but model is also a much looser title than soldier, so it's not a 1:1 comparison. Like saying, ""I'm an artist"" can mean a great range of things, and no way implies that you are skilled or famous. ""I'm a soldier"" sort of implies you've been trained or at least have some sort of battlefield experience."
gaming,feoonku,t3_eq06bx,1579303162.0,"I find it funny how elitist some of us are about the 'good ol' days', completely ignoring all the crap and shit we put up with like arcades, movie/tv tie ins, and ridiculous expensive peripheral devices. Oh, but no! Microtransactions are the real problem! The game industry was perfectly altruistic before that!"

facepalm,feomy1z,t3_eq3o7l,1579302429.0,"It's such a stupid decision on their part. Morality aside, this is a perfect fucking publicity opportunity. The deed was already done and punishment wasn't going to reverse it. Firing her only makes them look bad. On the other hand, if they would have promoted the story and sold it as some sort of, ""The Bank that cares"" testimonial, they could have got tons of free publicity and a good reputation they could, excuse the pun, bank on."
todayilearned,feomp39,t1_feo529u,1579302289.0,"I mean, it's sorta bullshit, pseudo-intellectual, drivel, though. Sure, he was happy in the woods. That doesn't mean everyone is happy in the woods. He might find technology burdensome, but for some of us, its liberating. 

Even the car thing is garbage. If it was an argument about the dangers of, say, sweat shop production in meeting high demand for over-produced products, sure. However, cars save tons of lives. Police, fire, EMS, search and rescue, etc all use cars to save lives. That's not even counting the use of vehicles in infrastructure to supply and support people, such as cars use by farmers or truckers to deliver food and supplies.

I mean, I get that technology has inherent risks, but the reason we are living such long lives is because of technology. That doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to issues that come up, but a lot of us are alive right now because of the technology we developed.

I also find it a bit disingenuous when any person or group calls down 'modern technology' because they are arbitrarily drawing a line at the technology they find disreputable and ignoring any technology they utilize. For example, he can talk shit about cars, but would he have the same opinion about modern firearms? Or how about those people that want to live off the grid and are perfectly happy calling down modern technology while buying pallets of MREs from their local Walmart. It's absolute hypocrisy."

There are different types now, representing different playstyles (hegemony, science, etc) with different rules, (for example, one has psychic duels for leadership). Seems pike an overhaul of diplo in general. There are also now origins and traits. Some traits are moved to origins, while new origins are added. For example, you can start on a doomed planet that will be destroyed within 67 years."
AskReddit,felf1um,t3_epduqa,1579220652.0,Picking locks. The only real difficulty is getting the muscle memory to hold the tension wrench with the right amount of pressure. The rest is just moving up and down the cylinder poking at the pins until they all click into place.
darkestdungeon,felbz76,t3_epgc90,1579218608.0,"Looks right. The only other real explanation is that the shot from the intro was taken during an incursion into the ruins, where the ancestor decided to rest in that exact room. It's also possible that, given the manor seems to be some sort of eldritch location, that the dungeon is reshaping itself based on the ideas and memories of the ancestor (which is sort of viable, considering that the only enemies and monsters that pop up are the ones that the ancestor had recorded knowledge of or interacted with)."
