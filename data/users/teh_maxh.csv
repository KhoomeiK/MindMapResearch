The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense of informed representative government provides no real security for our Republic.

worldnews,ff7wbfq,t1_ff7tn1x,1579659896.0,"Well, the MCAS implementation was flawed (it only used a single sensor, so if that sensor was faulty it wouldn't work right, where working right means not forcing the plane into a fatal dive), but it was fundamentally a bad idea in the first place. What Boeing did was build a plane that wouldn't work the way pilots thought it did. Generally, when you're telling gravity to go fuck itself, you want to know how you're doing that. Initially, Boeing didn't even tell pilots or airlines about MCAS existing. Only after the Lion Air crash did they publicise the system, and even then, they failed to share sufficient information. Once MCAS activated, pilots had four seconds to recognise the problem and disable it without problems; after just ten seconds, the flight would be unrecoverable.

Boeing really didn't have any good options here. Design decisions dating back to the 1950s meant that they couldn't quickly produce a good competitor to Airbus's latest offering. Unfortunately, they made the worst possible choice, and 347 people are dead."
worldnews,ff7s7js,t1_ff7h3i0,1579657082.0,"The whole point of the new plane was that it would fly the same as any other 737, but be more efficient. They wanted to be able to compete with Airbus, who had just done the same thing with the A320neo. The problem was that the A320 actually could fit a more efficient (larger) engine in the same place, and therefore keep its flight characteristics. The 737, though, had its engines mounted lower, so a larger engine wouldn't fit in the same place. (It's worth noting that the A320 was launched in 1988, whereas the 737 was launched in 1968, with a design ultimately based on the 707 introduced in 1958, so Airbus had an extra 20â€“30 years of design knowledge to work with.) Moving the engines altered the flight characteristics, which should have required pilots to learn a new type of aircraft. So Boeing got a bit stuck: They could keep their planes flying the same way, and not need to retrain pilots; or they could introduce more efficient engines, but need pilot retraining. MCAS was supposed to be the trick that made the plane act like an old 737 even with the engines moved.

It wasn't a very good trick."
