They put in an enormous effort so that the digital character actually *is* animated from the actor rather than teams of animators.  If I was one of those people who made that possible, I think I'd be very proud that my product was ""just digital makeup"" to the actors.  That was the goal in the first place, after all."

AskReddit,ff7394b,t1_ff67e6s,1579640242.0,">Sucks that massage is associated with the sensual/sexual because i really like helping people overcome aches and mobility issues but it's hard to advertise without getting calls from guys wanting their dick tugged.

This is the issue that finally led me to conclude that prostutution should be legal.  I like getting massages, but there are so many illegitimate places in my area that I just don't bother; I don't know which places are just fronts.

If you want sex, you should just be able to go to a place that is openly selling it, and leave the massage therapists out of it.  Other professions don't have to deal with this, so why should they?"

aww,feu51v5,t1_feqgl6g,1579383180.0,"It was in no way an unwelcome surprise.  We have an older girl who we tried for five years to conceive before doing ivf.  Once our daughter turned two, we really started wanting a second one.  We had one serious conversation about whether we would adopt, use a donated egg or embryo, our even do ivf again.  Five days later, my wife woke me up by saying ""you've got to to see this"" and holding up a positive pregnancy test.  It was possibly the happiest moment of my life.

The resulting child is playing at my feet as I write this, and turns two this week.  My little freebie."

vim,fdxv7h6,t1_fdveak5,1578773257.0,"If you are already comfortable with redo (`.`), then macros are really just an extension of the concept.  Instead of a single action, macros replay a series of actions.

So if you want to add to beginning of a line, you can already did it with a single action.  To do it to the next line, you just go there and redo, which replays the last action.  Macros are the same thing, but with more actions, like adding to both the beginning and the end of a line.  You can then get clever and navigate to the next line as part of the macro, so you can then run it n times for however many lines you want to change."

atheism,fcckqb1,t3_eh0rd7,1577599523.0,"Just remember, atheism is basically the default setting.  He has nothing to prove to you, but if you want him to take your beliefs seriously, the burden of proof is on you.  You are the one making claims.

Most theists (people who aren't atheists) tend to think supplying evidence is too difficult.  Seeing as nobody in the history of humanity has successfully coughed up proof of their religion...they're not wrong.  It's an uphill battle to say the least.

The most important piece of advice I can give you is to reciprocate any expectations you have of him when discussing religion (do unto others as you would have done unto you, if you will).  When you engage in this discussion, do so expecting that you will come around to his way of thinking just as much as you expect him to come around to yours.  Going into the discussion any other way is disingenuous, a terrible thing to do to someone you are in a relationship with, and a sign of great immaturity."

This is why anti-vaxxers are so awful.  Kids with cancer depend on herd immunity to keep them as healthy as possible while going through years of chemotherapy.  Anti-vaxxers chip away at herd immunity, knowing they are hurting kids who already have cancer.  Fuck those people.
