The mechanics were all similar, the looks were all similar, the play styles were all similar.  This is supposed to be a commentary on the played out idea of hiding usable objects in boxes, crates, etc or just littering every scene with those objects as you stalked through a dozen variants on the same game.  It became a shorthand for combat style grittiness.  The joke is definitely taken to the extreme, though.  Plus a lot of just weirdness.
