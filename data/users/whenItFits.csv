SuicideWatch,fe9p0fy,t1_fe9ng3l,1578940179.0,"Well try it. When my mom divorced my abusive step dad they asked me if I wanted a therapist and I said no. I kinda regret it because there are still things I need to work through. I still have PTSD.  I still have issues that would have helped me and I wished I spoke up. Just tell your parents how you feel, tell your school counselor, there are people out there that want to help you. If you can't talk to your parents about it then write a letter to them and hand it to them.  they would be wondering what they could have done better if they lost you, they will be broken. You have time to get help, don't be afraid and it's nice to have friends that our there for you but they are not professionals. Please tell your parents how and what you feel."
SuicideWatch,fe9obtc,t1_fe95bvy,1578939933.0,"Depends on the person. For me it was being free of my abusive step dad, joining the military (which was hell but a necessary stepping stone) finding love, having kids, getting a job that I couldn't dream of, buying a house, finishing college. Now i enjoy small hobbies like growing mushrooms. I like playing games with the wife and kids, felling free to do whatever I want without someone yelling or hitting me. It got better for me, will it get better for you? Well that depends on you. Sit down, determine what you want to do in life, then move towards that goal one day at a time. If you focus all of your energy on your goals one day you will look back and say "" I'm happy I'm still here"". I had the realization at 16 what I wanted to do in life. I stopped taking drugs, didn't even smoke weed. I knew what I wanted to do and how to do it. 12  years later and im exactly where I wanted to be. Was it easy? Hell no, but it was worth it."

SuicideWatch,fe83o4x,t3_eo33ci,1578922153.0,"Don't do it. Who determines what is an important future? A future is better then no future. That's great you don't want all that stuff right now, but you are young, you will change. Do you know how different I am from 10 years ago. Do you know how different I am from when I was 13. I had no drive, no purpose, I was abused, bullied, abandoned, neglicted, cringy. Today, 15 years later I am none of those things. I made my life what I wanted it to be. I didn't let no one else have control anymore. You might think suicide is taking control but your wrong.. It's losing control. Make your life what you want it and strive towards it every day. I hope you have a future."
SuicideWatch,fe82ie5,t3_eo3qgl,1578921730.0,"Your still young. You haven't even got the chance to experience all the great things in life. Focus on yourself, don't worry about anyone else. Find your purpose in life and focus on that. If you can't find a purpose then try to spread positivity and just get through one day at a time. School years suck for a lot of people. Things will get better, but only if you want them to."
