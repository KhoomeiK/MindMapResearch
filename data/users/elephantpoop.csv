AskGaybrosOver30,fej9296,t1_fedbce5,1579162195.0,I'm 33 and just signed up for meet up. Im also single and not holding my breath. I just hope to make some new friends and whatever happens happens. What kind of group did you join? And which did you have the most success in? Any tips? Just the tip lol jkjk
Aquariums,feges5f,t1_fegcd66,1579090269.0,Nope. I'm pretty sure it's cyanobacteria. Look at the glass behind and the rocks. And no plant has that dark green blue hue. The brown stuff is just algae but that's not what's on the plant killing it.

Aquariums,feg8be5,t3_eowp2i,1579081833.0,I do it every two weeks (even then my nitrates are under 20 but I change water for more oxygen and nutrients) because I'm lazy and I keep all my tanks understocked just for this reason.
Aquariums,feg7jeq,t1_fefsb7q,1579080729.0,"I personally would do 6-8 neon tetras, 3 cories, and shrimp in a 15 gallon. They are all cheap enough and common enough to replace just in case since you are new to the hobby. I killed many fish before I learned from all my mistakes even after doing a lot of research online. Just feed the bottom dwellers some sinking pellets and flakes for the tetras. Or you can just over feed the flakes so some sink to the bottom and not do pellets. 

This is enough to get you started. Eventually, if you see success, you will naturally want to improve your tanks with more variety of food, decor, plants, and everything else. Good luck! You will get algae and you will get mad but be patient. 

Best beginner tank I would ideally suggest is Betta. Just by it self with some anubias. That's the easiest and you won't get hardly any algae.

Oh and get nerite snails. They are the best with amano shrimps for algae. Also very cheap and no need to supplement anything extra."

Aquariums,feg688n,t1_feg4puz,1579078875.0,"Simple answer is yes. But every tank is different so you really need to monitor it and learn what works for you. If you're new, I would not suggest newts."

politics,fed3w0d,t1_fecrhmb,1578997531.0,"There is no way anyone who is interested in politics to miss any candidate. It has to be intentional. Google search of ""presidential candidates"" will give you info about everyone! If they can't even do that, they need to find new jobs."
AskReddit,fecpu7v,t1_fecpffj,1578980302.0,Yeah but changing your mind about education and what you want to do in life shouldn't ruin anyone's life. America's education system is fucked up. It should be okay for someone to aspire to be a doctor but change his mind to be something else. How do you expect an 18-20 year old to pick a major in college and run with it for the rest of their life with no option to turn back.

LifeProTips,fcn5pps,t1_fcmqxf4,1577803964.0,"It may not matter to you but you gotta respect that may matter to other people. If I buy a home and suddenly my neighbor decided to plant trees or whatever and if there branches come over to my side and the leaves fall and I have to do extra hard maintenance because of it, I can be annoyed by that. Or if they decide to raise chickens or something, and it attracts more raccoons or more insects over to the whole neighborhood, I would be annoyed. If they build high fences to obscure my view or build something that constantly puts glare in my window, I would be annoyed. Or if they build a balcony so they now have the option to view into my house from a different angle, I may now have to be more aware of that situation and even possibly buy myself more privacy. Or whatever they decide to build suddenly blocks out the sun in my bedroom so I don't get the nice sun light coming in, I will be annoyed. Or if they decide to install flood lights for night light and it is constantly turning on and off with motion detection, I will be annoyed. 

Everything is all situational. And I'm not saying it will happen without hoa, but it's a possibility.

If I had neighbor who did this, I will be annoyed."

LifeProTips,fcmql66,t1_fcmprkn,1577787331.0,"But that's the risk. Your neighbor could be nightmare in certain situations. And you can't just ""move"" on a whim. At least with hoa you can safely know your neighbor can't just plant a massive tree or build high fences or keep all their trash in their backyard or whatever."
GetMotivated,fcmprgx,t1_fcmoa8r,1577786163.0,Thank you very much for your honest reply. I wonder if her unhappiness was caused by external actions or internal drift away from her feelings towards you. I guess I should try to accept that a relationship is based on conditional factors which is sad to me but I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic.
GetMotivated,fcmotxa,t1_fcmg6kw,1577784831.0,"Don't put down people choosing to live single and die alone. I'm sure it was never their intention nor their ideal life and they thought about it a lot and made peace with it. It's not about being ""strong"" but doing whatever you want cuz it's your life and learning to find your small happiness in it before becoming worm food."

GetMotivated,fcmnxc5,t1_fcmlw7f,1577783554.0,"What are you going to do about it then if you were in his situation? You will have to deal with it cuz it can happen to anyone. Humans are fickle beings. You can't just ""fuck that"" and ignore it and it'll just go away. You will move on like everyone else. Time heals. The show that we call ""life"" must go on. And eventually you will have dealt with it.

Unless you think suicide is the answer. That's the ultimate ""fuck this I'm out of here"". Then yes you won't have to deal with it. But I don't think that's what you meant."
GetMotivated,fcmnlmd,t1_fcmgxio,1577783103.0,"Can you elaborate on why she felt unhappy? I'm trying to figure out in my own life, what is ""chemistry"" in a relationship and having a difficult time answering it."
NintendoSwitch,fchf4t8,t1_fcewktn,1577649888.0,"If you're new-ish to Pokemon games out under 10 years old, it's fantastic. Other wise, there's not enough gameplay content for it to be justified as a 60 dollar triple AAA exclusive to switch game. The graphics are horrible, the gameplay is repetitive and same as all the other Gameboy games, and very predictable."
