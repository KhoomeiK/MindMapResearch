Baking,ffi0230,t1_ffhmrbn,1579960896.0,"We used [this recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/lemon-cake/) for the cake part. We only used 1 tbsp of lemon zest so the cake isn't super lemony and overpowering the raspberry. 

And we used [this one](https://www.attachmentmummy.com/2018/06/blackberry-and-raspberry-upside-down.html?m=1) for the raspberry topping. Instead of doing raspberry and BlackBerry like the recipe says, we only did raspberry, so we did 300g raspberry."
