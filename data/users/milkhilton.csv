aww,fcs16rf,t3_eijnbq,1577909821.0,"How many movies or series originating from this early on makes a strong impact on children growing up today? Can anybody think of other examples excluding Disney cartoons? Let's clear the air here and say this wasn't always Disney. Which brings up another question: 

Do you guys think Disney has influence on the kids who are impacted by star wars? If disney never bought it out, would as many children enjoy it? I love to see kids from a couple generations being fans of the same series of movies. I'm sure the cartoons and video games play a part in it, it's a large entity but nice to see."
