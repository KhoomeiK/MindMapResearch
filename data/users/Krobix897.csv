clevercomebacks,fe0a3ot,t1_fe092jw,1578807404.0,"i see. then, in that case, you were right."
clevercomebacks,fe08w0i,t1_fdzubdb,1578806304.0,"but i believe that he was making a fucking joke and that he wasn't making a statement about his beliefs. i agree, nobody gives a shit about his opinions, and that's because that wasn't the subject of the comment."
clevercomebacks,fdzu66x,t1_fdztqcq,1578795873.0,"because the comment was ultimately related to the post, so r/nobodyasked doesn't apply.

and, i didn't ask about your belief on the matter. i don't care if you think that guns should be banned or not. i was attempting to tell you that your comment is irrelevant as the comment that he made was related, and then you decided that i was agreeing with his believes for some reason, when, in reality, i was trying to tell you that you misunderstood the original comment."
clevercomebacks,fdztftn,t1_fdzt5nr,1578795391.0,"did you not read my last comment? he's saying that guns shouldn't be banned. doesn't mean he's against gun control. he's saying that he doesn't believe that trump cheated the election, and finally, he's saying that he thinks that feminism is stupid."
clevercomebacks,fdzswlq,t1_fdzsn6n,1578795029.0,"no, he said that guns shouldn't be banned and that he thinks that trump didn't cheat the election. only one of the things you said were right.

guns should be banned != gun control

trump cheated the election != trumps impeachment.

feminism == feminism"
clevercomebacks,fdzsi4p,t1_fdz3yab,1578794752.0,i think that you and 7 others didn't get the joke
antimeme,fdzsf3x,t1_fdzs9wf,1578794697.0,"true, but, those seem to be very rare as a lot of them aren't anti memes but just r/bonehurtingjuice or r/speedoflobsters"
antimeme,fdzs516,t1_fdzqfjj,1578794508.0,isn't that... what an anti meme is?
tumblr,fdyov8f,t3_en9qiq,1578782105.0,"isn't that the guy who was stupid, executed a bunch of wives who failed to have a son, only for the one son he had to die? or am i confusing with someone else?"

ProgrammerHumor,fdlb2vt,t1_fdlautj,1578520238.0,"ok. that's reasonable, i'm just wondering as to why you don't like js so much, cause the only thing it does wrong that's really and is error handling, and you only have one example."
ProgrammerHumor,fdla21v,t1_fdl92mf,1578519637.0,"to be fair, python has that, as well as an exec() function. what js has the python doesn't, however, is html, gfx support, and bad error handling. besides the bad error handling, js can be used for a few purposes. i'm guessing that you're a systems programmer who's just butthurt that other people can program in an easier way and still get the same experience out of it."
ProgrammerHumor,fdl4ugp,t1_fdkuqx8,1578517066.0,javascript is a fine language. why do people hate it so much

BrandNewSentence,fdejjk5,t3_ekx50s,1578340375.0,"i'm not an expert, but according to what i've heard, this is total bullshit. the teachers in my area make something around 100k a year, which is higher than average, and definitely more than the garbage man (and yes, i know that that was just a hyperbole). then again, this most likely isn't true in many other areas, but from what i've heard, teachers make a lot."
