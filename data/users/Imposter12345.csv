videos,fc6truc,t3_eggegg,1577489291.0,"This report seems to be mostly bullshit.

The drought in Australia is not ""man made"" at all. The drought is a result of lack of rainfall across most of the catchment in the Murray Darling Basin.

The water flooding the Barmah choke is because all the other upstream rivers are completely dry. Usually downstream states would receive their water allocation from the Murray, and the Darling rivers, as well as other minor river systems. But because of the drought, most of the up river systems have completely dried out, meaning the source of upstream water that flows through the Barmah is the ONLY source of upstream water. In order for the states down river to receive their water allocation, it needs to come through a narrow stretch of river.

Just because one farmer sees a lot of water flowing past his farm, doesn't mean the entire food bowl of Australia isn't in drought.
