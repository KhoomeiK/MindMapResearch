Pokémon black and white
Splatoon 2 

Kinda weird picks all together, but I like both pretty music and crazy. :)"
videogames,felhmz5,t1_fekymfz,1579222388.0,Agreed. My dad and I used to play this together all the time. Very fun and interesting.
videogames,fe9p7iq,t1_fe9p3l7,1578940249.0,Aww! Maybe I’ll check it out. :)
tipofmyjoystick,fe8xcnf,t1_fe8wzdg,1578932009.0,YES! That’s it!!! Wow it looks waaaayyy better now! Thanks!
TheRightCantMeme,fe8qix9,t1_fe6v06a,1578929337.0,"I don’t really know what a mental health check would do anyway. Does she have depression? Let her get it otherwise that kid is not gonna make it. Does she have a severe mental disorder? Let her get it in case she is just trying to help herself survive. Is she perfectly sane and just wants a freaking abortion? LET HER GET IT otherwise she might develop something, especially resentment towards the child and that’s not helping either of them."
TheRightCantMeme,fe8pncb,t3_ensq3b,1578928986.0,One year wait period? Wtf??? Lmao this is all kinds of asinine.
videogames,fe8o6u9,t1_fe5lqg7,1578928439.0,Oh cool! I’ll do that!
videogames,fe503nr,t1_fe501jd,1578864431.0,Well I was like ten and a girl sooooooo
videogames,fe4q7lv,t1_fe2z1ud,1578861809.0,"Really? What does it look like? The one I mentioned was mostly monochrome until you kill enemies, and then the bodies would become rainbow pixels."
aww,fe2xbfo,t3_enfkv1,1578843915.0,AAAASSHHHH I want one so bad!!!
AskReddit,fe2x4s2,t3_eni3n7,1578843825.0,"Interviews and the dream job. Honestly, if that happened I wouldn’t have to go to school. Frick that."
AskReddit,fdfl19m,t3_ekt5n3,1578364168.0,Nope. Hate my current job and I’d just call and say a family emergency came up and I couldn’t really get to a phone.
AskReddit,fd9rljb,t1_fd8fooi,1578237083.0,Why is this so perfect?
aww,fcrodd1,t1_fcrmwbs,1577904456.0,"Huh, thanks! That was really helpful info!"
aww,fcr8fsq,t1_fcqkqfj,1577898298.0,Reminds me a lot of pit bulls. Such sweeties.
AskReddit,fcr6ss7,t1_fcr5xt8,1577897612.0,"Pretty much anything I can get my hands on. Sometimes I go for something less layered like post-it’s or copy paper, usually I like softer stuff like receipt paper and especially boxes like the ones you get candy in at the theater (it has a bunch of layers, so it’s super satisfying, and the layers between the paint are suuuuper soft). I just realized while typing this out how much of it I have down to a science. Lol. It’s so that I don’t pull out my hair (I have Trichotillomania) and I have a huge jar by my bed that has an inch of tiny balls in it. Haha. 

TL:DR: all kinds. Depends on what I’m feeling like."
AskReddit,fcpbt64,t1_fcp2607,1577857512.0,"I really only like some of the slime stuff, but it’s just because i like the sounds, not because they give me tingles."
AskReddit,fcpbqg0,t1_fcp7gip,1577857434.0,"Ok, this. Fidget spinners are too much of a distraction. I much prefer a cube or just balling up paper because I don’t have to look at or hear it. It’s silent and I can pay attention to what’s in front of me instead of something that’s in my hand."
AskReddit,fcpbesv,t3_ei8q1b,1577857098.0,"Couple of knives here and there, some zombie parts, and a frick ton of magical items/small creatures."
aww,fc8j0dh,t3_egnazr,1577535951.0,I want ooooone!!!
aww,fc8iven,t3_egisn6,1577535863.0,I love that dopey little grin! :)
AskReddit,fc77566,t3_eg9alg,1577499330.0,"Well, since someone already mentioned a giant dildo, I’ll go with my second choice which is just a really decorative hand axe. I just like them. Maybe something with some stones in the handle and a couple extra points on the top. I know it’s kinda lame, but why not."
AskReddit,fc76z0a,t1_fc56927,1577499204.0,So glad I’m not the only one whose first thought was just a giant dildo.
AskReddit,fc76hhg,t1_fc6rxx6,1577498834.0,Ok I’ve wondered this since I started working. I want to know. DOES ANYONE KNOW
AskReddit,fc75u4v,t3_egdzph,1577498339.0,Pokémon Go. I know like two people who still play it and it just kinda faded into obscurity.
confession,fc70u12,t1_fc70fv6,1577494521.0,"We are a very small company, and HR usually is not a big help when it comes to that kind of thing. It would almost definitely come back to bite me in the ass, especially since that’s not the only thing I would tell them. Luckily I’m already looking for a new job. The environment is beginning to feel more and more toxic."
AskReddit,fbc0h15,t3_ecbgkz,1576712662.0,"When a hockey player thinks they just scored and throws their hands (and by extension their stick) up in victory, only to have the puck bounce off the goal post, and now they just smacked someone in the face and got a high-sticking penalty. Good job."
