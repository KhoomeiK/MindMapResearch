Can literally Google how to make this."
Fire,ffbau93,t3_enk9hf,1579757848.0,"I’m slowly making my way towards FIRE, but I drive a 2005 Accord. I really need more cargo space, so I’m hoping it will last a few more years until used hybrid CRVs start hitting the market and I feel more comfortable paying that much cash from my savings."
LifeProTips,felxrs4,t1_felngow,1579233627.0,"I grew up rarely eating fast food. My family would get whoppers once a year to bring to our school picnic and it was a crazy treat.

But my life can get crazy hectic, and when I don't have time to go grocery shopping, fast food is just easy and cheap. I worked 80 hours per week for peanuts at my last job, so I'd eat a burger on my way home before flopping into bed. I'm currently working 12 hours per weekday and and driving 8 hours each weekend to help out a friend because her mom's sick, so my weekends are fast food heavy. I love cooking and I'm a damn good cook, but life man."
DontFuckWithCats,feiz8pl,t1_fecyugg,1579151428.0,"I found it kind of weird that the documentary presented it like the Facebook group brought him to justice when they didn't- they had the best intentions and did a ton of work, but it didn't really have a tangible effect on anything. They didn't even figure out his identity, it's clear that Luka doxxed himself to the group. They went to the police with his Toronto apartment address, and the police responded and found that he no longer lived there. When Jun Lin was murdered they were pissed that the police wouldn't listen to them, but the police were able to figure everything out on their own pretty quickly, and they eventually found all the videos. Luka was finally caught by sheer luck. Like, mad respect to their sleuthing skills, but it didn't impact anything."
JustBootThings,fdp8gqt,t3_emc5o6,1578622456.0,"I dated a guy for two years that was obsessed with enlisting after college. His dad was career military and he had been in JROTC, so he was a “military expert “ and was constantly shitty to me because I “didn’t understand the sacrifice he was making” and “wouldn’t have what it takes to be a soldier’s wife”.

Dude graduated college and became a fuckin librarian."

aww,fdczios,t1_fdcqmld,1578289032.0,"My family was struggling a lot when I was little and we didn't have many treats. My mom didn't want us kids to expect treats out of the blue when they were so rare, so a few times a year, when we'd gone a long stretch without a treat, she'd bake a cake to celebrate the dog's birthday (we were really little and couldn't tell the passage of time very well). And then we'd dote on the dog all day because it was her birthday.

To this day she was my favorite dog ever. She passed away when I was 10, but I still have her license tag.

Edit: I'm 30 now."
aww,fdasieh,t1_fdaju9o,1578249537.0,"I saw you got downvoted, but it's a fair generalization. Many cats are super standoffish, and they sleep so much they aren't usually as present as dogs. However, some *are* just as affectionate as pups when they're awake.

Mine are *so* needy sometimes I wish they were less affectionate. I only have two hands!"
aww,fda6be6,t1_fd9njs7,1578242266.0,"I adopted two adult cats.
My best friend adopted two kittens.

In hindsight, she and I agree that you should only adopt adults. Kittens are not worth the nightmare."

I'll pay the stupid price for that popcorn on the rare occasion I go to the movies, there's nothing like movie theater popcorn. But I'm not paying $5 for a gigantic ""small"" soda, which will still be over half full when I throw it out."
SubredditDrama,fc6cwvp,t1_fc5u0ys,1577477615.0,"Ironically, it's always the people that wouldn't survive eugenics that are obsessed with passing on their genes.

witcher,fc1zru9,t1_fc0rczb,1577334948.0,"I've only watched through episode 5 thus far (The books are enroute and I'm playing Witcher 3 after I finish my current game), but I strongly dislike Yennifer based solely on the show. She's whiny and self-important, and I have yet to find anything redeeming in her character.

Hopefully the books will shed more light for me, but I'm just really not feeling Geralt/Yennifer.

Renfri is my homegirl."
