It's completely possible to eat very small portions of calorically dense foods, or large produce and lean protein filled meals. I have worked very hard on regulating portions and retraining my tastes toward fresh produce and whole grains. It's because I have done so much work on healthy eating that I am still physically healthy. My set weight/metabolism seems to have been somewhat fucked by starvation, so it is higher/lower than it was 7 years ago, though."

I'm not arguing being fat is healthy, definitely not in OP's cousin's case. Simply saying A. Don't call fat people gross and dirty (which I don't even know why that needs to be a conversation) and B.

What just mentally, and sometimes in interactions with others, is that this is a chain that started as I entered treatment for anorexia. I was constantly facing criticism that said ""eat less, exercise more"". But I was gaining weight on the lowest meal plan that was physically safe, and I was medically banned from exercise. Even my drs were suspicious at first, until they got my records. I'm sorry, there's so much more. I don't mean to just splash pain all over here.

Also, body positivity has been incredibly deformed from its original intent. It was originally just a philosophy rooted in not hating your body - nothing against working to become healthier, including losing weight if necessary. Just don't loathe yourself while doing it.

I totally get what you're saying, and as someone who is fat, healthy*, and body positive, I want to smack those people.

What you mainly see in matriarchies is a complete shunning of men from everyday life. Male children are sent to live with other men - they may be completely segregated from the women or relegated to their own area close by.
