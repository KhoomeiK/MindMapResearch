AskReddit,fcxm45d,t3_ejdlbw,1578066231.0,"Roughly a 2 year friendship with this individual: this person was OBSESSED with being in a relationship and consistently violated boundaries. 

Some of the highlights: 
-I had 3 new roommates move in last year and his first response after telling him was, ‚Äúare any of them single?‚Äù 

-Over the first 4 months of living with my roommates, he consistently made jokes about fucking one of them. Mind you, these jokes made me very uncomfortable and he still made them. 

-I told him to not call, text, instant message, or FaceTime me when he‚Äôs drunk because it‚Äôs a trigger for me and he still did it. 

-He did not stand up for me when his roommate was verbally attacking me, proceeded to stick his nose in places where it didn‚Äôt belong in the name of ‚Äúmediation‚Äù when his roommate and I weren‚Äôt speaking, then sided with him after everything. He tried to apologize later on but I told him to fuck off."
