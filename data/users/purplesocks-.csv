WWE,ffdtk0w,t1_ffdtgoq,1579828575.0,"oh yes, can never go wrong with Taker. when he returned at WM20 against Kane, that was probably my single favorite entrance of all time. so damn badass!"

quittingkratom,fdepg4t,t1_fdeoy4w,1578343876.0,"actually yes! a really good heating pad was a game changer. granted, restless leg wasn't a huge issue for me. 

sometimes at night it would get annoying, so I'd just wrap the pad around my knees where it gets the worst and that really helped."
quittingkratom,fde2h9b,t1_fddjwcr,1578329697.0,YOU'RE A BADASS SAMMY
quittingkratom,fde2dd6,t1_fddpthm,1578329625.0,it's only gonna get easier. YOU'RE A BADASS SAMMY
quittingkratom,fde29jf,t3_ekutu6,1578329556.0,"this is awesome. I'm on day 5 cold turkey from ~60gpd for almost 4 years. I know what you mean about the first few days. being accustomed to dosing every day for so long, the cravings are something else. 

considering my dose and length of use, it's not bad so far. not gonna lie, as soon as you said it got bad around day 5, I skipped that whole part.. if I have the mindset that my experience will be anything like yours, it'll kill me. 

although I've been laying in bed staring at the fucking wall for the past 5 days, I'm 25 and very fit and active, so I think that may be playing a big role in why I'm not feeling *too* terrible. 

at the end of the day, it's important to remember what you went through. may this motivate you to stay away for good. 

congrats on the most important 30 days of your life :)"
