relationship_advice,ffcvlag,t1_ffc2enf,1579808175.0,What your wife did was wrong.... however I say this gently I wouldn’t think “ you wouldn’t be like this with him” because this is about how she treated you. She lied she cheated and she abused you. She likely was “moody” with him too but he is a serial cheating and is likely in it for the rush of cheating and sex and literally does not care how she treats him. For your own self don’t focus on him focus on her.
AskReddit,ffctze2,t1_ffbntjo,1579807219.0,I started hating it because “why don’t you cook your so much better at it” like no I’m not your personal chef.

AmItheAsshole,ffcryhq,t3_esrtrc,1579806030.0,Sometimes it is better to quit because it looks better on your resume when applying for the next jump he can say oh we had scheduling differences so I quit... don’t feel bad because he chose to do that
memes,ff7ivl8,t1_ff7g3d0,1579650591.0,I hope you find a new passion! That fucking sucks but I would suggest keep trying in school you might end up finding a career path you like that needs good grades... either way hang in there you got it!
memes,ff6yo24,t1_ff6tpxj,1579637599.0,I was gonna say that a lot of injuries get ingnored just because kids are young. I know 3 people who complained of got pain and everybody brushed it off as a sprain and all three broke something. Personally I slammed my thumb in a car door and broke it and by the time my parents got it checked it was too late reset it. My thumb doesn’t bend right and hurts everytime the temp drops below 70 and it’s relatively minor but theoretically it could’ve been avoided.
AmItheAsshole,ff6y3qh,t1_ff6axm9,1579637268.0,"I think the parents over reacted. First they should have a talk with their child along the lines of you need to eat what is available. Second it’s not OPs fault the child is upset about it and they didn’t need to insult OP. Also OP is doing them a favor with free childcare, OP is not trying to interfere with their parenting just feeding what is convenient for them."
college,ff6xcmj,t3_eruvps,1579636826.0,Unfortunately I feel like understanding the way it’s written takes practice but it may help your comprehension to read sparknotes or other summaries.
college,ff6wbq9,t3_erynja,1579636221.0,Crash course has a lovely video on this called how to take notes that is a great entertaining summary. I would suggest using an outline so think I make big ideas bullet points and if you have to add details you can. The Cornell method is another good idea just google Cornell method and some good guides will come up. Also I’ve hade my notes used as examples a few times if you message me I can send you scans of them if would like a visual example.
college,ff6vktn,t3_erwadk,1579635777.0,Find a community on campus to join it will ease the homesickness and help you stay focused on school by keeping involved on campus
college,ff6uw3u,t3_eryxub,1579635377.0,Maybe an online degree will be less stressful for you? Or maybe a smaller campus? Definitely y’all to your counselor your school might offer a program that can give you Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help with your anxiety. Also talk to your doctor I hate to jump to medicine but it sounds like your anxiety is getting in the way of your education and you met need medication. Hope this helps and good luck!
AskAnAmerican,ff6rgib,t3_erv98w,1579633333.0,Another thing I haven’t seen mentioned if you have a major party where you are planning on having heavy drinking it’s common practice to have people just stay over... almost all of the college parties I’ve been to have that as an option or they will warn ahead of time don’t get trashed cause you can’t stay here
AskReddit,ff6arta,t3_err9f0,1579623098.0,"I worked as a paralegal for year. 
It was a divorce case and the client had selected to do a regular delivery of service, instead of sheriff delivery despite the fact that she was divorcing him over abuse. You can if you need to deliver service and a restraining order at the same time the sheriff( or equivalent police officer) delivers it. Our client selected regular delivery because it was 45$ cheaper. The husband brutally beat her and raped her. I cried for an hour plus because I even tho my boss directed me to do regular service I could’ve done the sheriff service."

AmItheAsshole,fezqyp6,t1_feyby0m,1579460539.0,I have food allergies (specifically gluten)... if I eat gluten I get seriously sick. I STILL dont expect other people to accommodate me. I ask hosts before hand if I need to bring myself a dish (in a polite manner of course) or I will eat before hand. Tony is expecting everyone to eat like him. Rude thing #1. Tony also expects everyone to listen to him ramble about his diet. Rude thing #2. Finally at this pot luck there were 3 dishes for him and he still ruined your dish. Steak sandwiches are expensive and I’m sure would’ve been a hit. I have no idea why this diet turned him into a selfish asshole but I would suggest one of your friends telling him (for his sake) that he needs to be considerate of others or he is going to loose all his friends.
college,fezoufa,t1_fezamav,1579459804.0,The mistake made was you said you used to. This means in the part you had suicidal ideation and need medical treatment. But you used to that means something as improved and you don’t need medical treatment now. The law allows him to call because they would rather they be safe than sorry. I’m sorry you were put in that situation if a similar situation comes up say “ I was struggling awhile ago but I am fine now. I have no active sucicidal ideation”

IncelTears,fdah00o,t3_ek6gh3,1578246025.0,"Marriage has been shown to be statistically significantly bad for women. (Found as early as 1983) Women are often subject to the infamous “second shift”. Women in marriage are often expected to work, perform most child care, and most domestic chores. Basically the reason it’s hard to pursue a career and get married is because men benefit more from marriage than women. Now this is a consistent pattern not true in all cases but I believe If we taught our men to be more conscious of their actions and expected them to equally participate in domestic take we can solve this problem. Also this dude is clearly a pedophile."

amiugly,fctrnok,t3_eirv3c,1577955952.0,I cannot say this enough you are so beautiful!!! I think you would feel more convenientionally attractive if you change your hair cut or style. All you need is for your hair to frame your beautiful face for example in prom photo it’s pushed back a bit and you can see your face shape better... if you wanted to do makeup and wear tight clothes you are definitely a 9/1 0 all natural I would say a 7/10 only because your beautiful face is hiding in your hair.
amiugly,fctreq7,t3_eim8m6,1577955598.0,The haircut really improved things I would say your facial structure is good and body is good 7/10! Also there is a clear change in confidence that helped you!
