Elantra,fg9z00t,t1_fg9rwbv,1580644828.0,I think you are right about that. I don't know how it works but the two dealerships for honda and Toyota close to me has a 1 price deal where you don't have to deal with extra stuff. Bought my sister's car from there before and they did it in a few hours. It sucks because I really do like hyundai and I wish dealerships were owned and operated by the manufacturers so it's the same experience for everyone

They have really bad dealership experiences for me. I've visited 3 so far and every single one of them tries to trick you or make you feel unwelcome if you are coming to test drive a car. I've also visited both Toyota and Honda dealerships and that was a completely different experience. No hassle and no push for anything."
CrappyDesign,fg8jopl,t3_exa6p1,1580621620.0,You do know that you bought it right?
Elantra,ffy3wnm,t3_evum2h,1580338062.0,"So this is one thing I learned recently and I wish I had learned in the past. Anytime you are installing your Cold Air Intake, make sure you reset your ECU so that it starts recognizing that there is a new intake unit in your car. 

Now as far as mods are concerned, CAI are pretty useless unless you make additional mods to your car such as down pipe and catback exhaust. From personal experience, that is where I felt the biggest difference. Otherwise, you are taking more air into your intake while pushing out the same amount of air that your stock had."
