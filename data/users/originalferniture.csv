AmItheAsshole,ff2wtsf,t3_erbdtp,1579527107.0,"NTA, this sounds horrendous. I really feel for you. Some good discreet cameras then go from there. Write and record everything"
AskReddit,feqozoz,t3_eq7gkm,1579344427.0,"Emo üôÑ. I had my reasons though, unfortunately. How i have changed!"
AskReddit,feqocge,t1_fep8cr5,1579344188.0,Feel sorry for the guy but can't stop laughing!
AskReddit,femq10c,t1_felvwbo,1579266209.0,"My grandad had a rough childhood with no money however he still was looked after as best as my great nan could, but he died a few years ago a millionaire but he got banned from his local library for hogging the free papers and he would refuse to put heating on if he was paying for it, wouldn't pay for new shoes and at his house you weren't allowed to charge your phone or anything. I loved him but didn't understand him one bit."
AmItheAsshole,fehqdpn,t3_ep6kzw,1579121787.0,"NTA, it was a gift. You don't take them back or ask for payment. I had a similar situation years ago with an ex, we bought xmas presents, spent same amount of money but apparently his weren't good enough. I broke up with him not long after due to a load of other things as well and i heard through my 'friends' that he was pissed and wanted his money back! Err... no."
AmItheAsshole,fehcbj4,t3_ep5nzd,1579113627.0,"NTA, always trust your gut feeling. Your parents wouldn't be saying your overreacting if you went missing but on the other hand they may have been trying to steer you to a more 'comforting' explanation rather than seeing you were so frightened but i don't know, I'm glad you just got out safe."
AskReddit,fedgk0t,t3_eojl6b,1579010939.0,I used to work with a girl who would be stopped by the police on a regular basis for driving
AmItheAsshole,fedfcop,t3_eobkk6,1579009991.0,"NTA, your dog sounds amazing just make sure that annoying guy doesn't get your dog in any trouble though. Guy sounds like a creep"
AskReddit,fedexds,t3_eojqln,1579009648.0,"Annalise Keating, but as soon as she got me cleared, I'd run!"
AmItheAsshole,fedepx3,t3_eohob3,1579009477.0,"NTA, she needed to know. I would want to know but i wouldn't have wanted to see those messages just because you don't need to add that in to the mix"
AmItheAsshole,fecwm5d,t3_eofyl9,1578987540.0,"NTA, brilliant dad! She'll appreciate this as she gets older. My dad has taken me shopping for stuff like this too because my mum didn't have the money and yh it's awkward but it would have been more awkward and embarrassing if i walked around school with no bra."
aww,fdv8bl0,t3_emz78t,1578744496.0,"Love this! My dog would do this if she could, swear she happily glue herself to me!"
AmItheAsshole,fdv871z,t3_en26md,1578744413.0,"NTA, can't believe your own mother thinks her grandchildren can wait over an hour for her to turn up and possibly miss their appointment?! No one has appointments for no reason."
AmItheAsshole,fdq41x3,t3_emimf3,1578653839.0,"NTA, would have been a nightmare if she'd forgotten to pick any up. That was really nice of you"

AmItheAsshole,fdjggw5,t3_eliwde,1578469750.0,"NTA, absolutely brilliant response"
AmItheAsshole,fcxq5je,t3_ejbolo,1578068827.0,"YTA, if you want to dine at a fancy restaurant which could work out expensive, either you pay for the invited guests and deal with the upset uninvited people later or invite the others AND pay for everyone. If i was 'sort of' invited to a posh meal but told i had to pay for myself but other more 'important' guests were being paid for I'd say stick it tbh."
AskReddit,fcxpgn9,t3_ejgiuf,1578068396.0,Ears!
AskReddit,fcxon5t,t3_ej51z3,1578067878.0,So my partner wants me to put the word 'minge'! And the fact there is so many words for that lady part in the British language
AmItheAsshole,fcx011k,t3_ej5jdk,1578045102.0,"NTA, I can't stand when people do this. It's rude and cheap as they end up getting a free engagement party! I would have done the same as you. I definitely wouldn't be going to their wedding either."
AmItheAsshole,fcn6j22,t3_ehw713,1577804568.0,"Really?! Any mother would WANT you to talk to your daughter like this, especially so young! Sorry to be harsh but she needs to sort it out!"
relationships,fckwptv,t3_ehim4g,1577734830.0,"They both sound ridiculous, he can't be trusted and if this was me i wouldn't particularly want two very confused and manipulative people around my young child. Sounds like you need to keep away from both of them for your own and your sons son's sanity (as he grows up). Awful situation"
relationships,fckqnl2,t3_ehop0e,1577731096.0,"You sound heartbroken and he sounds not bothered at all. Personally i think, leave and go home and then start divorce proceedings. You need to be happy as well and so does your daughter. You're not abandoning him and i don't think alot of women know 'what their signing up for' exactly because it can change so much and some people act so different when they're away from home. I hope you find happiness."
aww,fcds29m,t3_egydmk,1577613054.0,Wow what a doggo! ü•∞
AmItheAsshole,fc59yjq,t3_eg8hdn,1577450445.0,"NTA - but don't go! I think what you've said you'd do is funny but it could backfire big time. Definitely cut them off though. See if the ex you were gonna go with wants to do something else, if you enjoy each others company? As much as you want to get back at them ignorance really is bliss and they sound like the type of AH's that would love to get a reaction out of you."
AskReddit,fc0yig4,t1_fc0a5uh,1577303146.0,"I turned it off half way through, was so confused! Then looked it up online and was like 'whaaaaattt'?!"
relationships,fc0xv01,t3_efggyd,1577302620.0,"Shouldn't be picking sides. You should support your parents on their individual situations and not let this interfere with the other, if you respect them both"
aww,fc06tgi,t3_efg2r0,1577281068.0,Aw poor baby girl. Feel better soon beautiful ‚ù§
AmItheAsshole,fc05qtu,t3_efcc8u,1577279794.0,"NTA! Why do family think it's ok to get involved! No, i think you just need to tell them what happened and let them make up their own minds but sounds like Sarah has manipulated this. They all sound ridiculous in this situation. They should be supporting and staying loyal to you. 

Edit - maybe breaking out of the window was a bit much but this girl has obviously really hurt you. Maybe you should have left through the front door whilst saying 'why would i want to talk to a cheater'"
aww,fby91zm,t3_ef3lou,1577211050.0,"My partner does the same to me if im working and he's off at home! Or if I'm away anywhere for the night! It works, i feel tortured too lol"
