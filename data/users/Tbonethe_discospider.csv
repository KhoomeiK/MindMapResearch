AskReddit,ffwb7aw,t1_ffw9h9h,1580293532.0,"Like the commenter that replied before me, all chilies come from Mexico. 

Mostly chilies are referred to as “peppers” in English. The reason for this is because to the Europeans, “chillies” tastes similarly to what we regularly know as “table pepper”. So, the name “pepper” stuck. 

“Chili” is a Nahuatl word. It’s why mostly Mexicans call it, “chiles”. 

A lot of South Americans who don’t eat chilies the way Mexicans do, call chilies the equivalent of “peppers” in their Spanish. (Pimentos)

Pimento in Spanish = the word for table pepper."
AskReddit,ffwako4,t1_ffvvby3,1580292609.0,"I have a mini-story that might be one of the most fucked up things you’ll read. 

When I was around 9 years old, I found a pigeons’ nest. 

It was in the morning. Everyone was sleeping. So I decided to be a sneaky jerk, and bring the nest with the eggs in. 

Now, 9-year-old me knew that the momma bird laid on the eggs to keep them warm, and therefore hatch. 

Well, I couldn’t wait any longer to see those cute little pigeons hatch!

How do you warm something up quicker so it’s... “done”?

::light bulb!:: 

I grab the nest and run to the kitchen microwave and set the nest for 2 minutes. “That should be enough! They’ll hatch quickly now and I’ll have cute baby birds as mascots in the house!” 

Well, I giddily put the nest, and wait. I watch from the tiny microwave window the little eggs rotate... and rotate... and rotate... and BOOM! 

Baby bird guts splattered completely in the microwave. It was a murder scene. 

I screamed at the top of my lungs. Wake up my entire family, and the neighbors next door. 

My mom found me screaming in the kitchen. Completely scarred and horrified at the sight before me. 

I’m 33 years old now. It still haunts me to this day."

I went through major depression, and in the last year I have finally been able to crawl out of it.

One of the things that I have done to be able to overcome it, is to make a list of things that make me happy. I only focus on those things.

The things that have made me happy is loving my friends, and loving my family.

My cognitive map of the world definitely does not add up to the values that my mother told me to practice. Things like respect, caring for your fellow human, things like that. My mom taught me to be nice, and respectful. It has put me at a huge disadvantage. The only people I see who advance, are people that are not respectful and are not nice.

Many Cubans that I have spoken to have arrived in the United States in the last 2 to 5 years. I think if I can regurgitate everything they have said in a sentence is, “If Cuba just had more food, I wouldn’t have left.”

I grew up Mormon. Immediately left the church at 18. Never went back. 

I’m a progressive. Actually, scratch that, I’m a goddamn proud leftist. 

I’ve always tried to figure out how we can convince other people in my politics spectrum to meet once a week/month the way republicans do. 

Coffee houses sounds like a good idea. 

But, growing up Mormon, I look back and think that the reason why I LOVED going to church was because of the community. (I didn’t agree with the belief system, but I did love being around all my friends/family everyday, on weekends, on vacations, etc)

If the left were to provide something similar to its “followers” we’d have to form a community. Not just teach about justice and equality, but we’d have to have non-political activities as well. Have games for the kids, support for the elderly, and something for the adults.

It’s culture, and community. 

Most Americans are sick of the American system. We do better economically, we have more “stuff”, but we are SO DAMN isolated from each other it’s soul crushing. 

We don’t talk to our neighbors. We rarely have time to visit family. Spend time with friends. 

We don’t have a culture that puts family over economic obligations.

Some interesting facts I gathered from this article 

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/11/us/after-riots-riots-put-focus-hispanic-growth-problems-south-central-area.html

1. East Los Angeles (where most Mexicans lived) was large unaffected. 

2. A third of the 58 people killed in the riots were Hispanic 

3. 40% of property destroyed in South Central LA was Hispanic. (People that lived in South Central were predominantly from Central America) 

4. South-Central Hispanics were recent arrivals, and lacked the historical roots that Mexican-Americans had developed in East LA. This made them less prepared for the riots, and were disproportionally affected. 


Well, I guess I answered my own question. Apparently many of the people who joined blacks in the riots were recently arrived latinos from Central America. 

The last part of the article mentions (to my disappointment) that the Mexican political establishment in East Los Angeles wanted to make sure that people knew the Latinos who were participating in the riots were not Mexican."

She researched all her emotions. She said she wouldn’t have a boyfriend again until her self-esteem was good, she had money and a career, and she was comfortable being alone. 

Well, she attained all of it! When you ask her why she’s single, she always says, “i still haven’t met a man who gives me more happiness than I have now.”

news,fd0689u,t1_fcyyjcq,1578114241.0,"I always laughed at when they call California failed. (I’m from Nevada, born and raised, so I have no horse in the race)

But, who the fuck in their right mind calls California a failed state?

This is the usual arguments online. 

(1) Rampant homelessness: yep! You’re right about that. The housing crisis is real. People call California communist? There’s nothing communists about having thousands of human beings homeless. It’s acrually a result of unfethered capitalism. Extremely well-paid individuals and highly educated people love in California. Displacing people who can no longer afford it. That’s just good-old capitalism to me. Republicans should be proud of California! 

(2) it has the most welfare recipients of any state. This true. Both in absolute numbers and as a ratio of its population. But, do you know why? First of all, Californians don’t cut their social welfare’s to the bare bones like other states do. So what if Kentucky can claim less people on their welfare rolls? That just means there’s less people that are receiving help. That’s not an achievement. 

(3) Bunch of gay, brown people have taken over the state. This one I get. It’s white fear. They’re afraid that a brown state that’s multicultural, accepting and welcoming of other people is successful.  People that hate on California do it with a slight twist of underlying racism. Nothing unites Californians more than kicking some nazis ass. They hate it when they unite. They’re afraid most white people in California don’t buy into their supremacist bullshit. 

Really, hate usually comes from fear of the unknown. This is where California hate usually comes from. 

California has always been a symbol of where our country is heading. They’re afraid that a minority-majority state is succeeding because it goes against everything they’re preach."

It sounds insane. To just casually say, “Yeah, we can take over the world, for a little bit if we wanted” Sounds completely sociopathic. 

I’m not saying you’re sociopathic. I just wanted to point out my observation as an outsider. The thought of war, killing innocent humans, invading a country, is so normal and part of your lexicon, that you don’t realize how insane this is.

There’s this box hanging in the middle of the stage, and it’s supposed to explode with the word said audience member chose. 

Well, this teenage girl decides to choose the word, “faggot.” (Or fag... I don’t remember)

Angel, surprisingly, went along with that word, and, BOOM! The box explodes and a giant ribbon with the word faggot appears across it. 

I couldn’t believe it. 

My friends couldn’t believe it. 

Half the audience did an audible gasp. 

It was so fucking terrible. A few audience members walked out. 

The show started late. Some tiny magician guy came out and performed magic/comedy for us for like 20 minutes soon after this incident. 

I thought it was part of the show. 

A few days later, I read in the newspaper the staff from Cirque were threatening to leave in the middle of the show and that’s why the tiny magician was deployed. They were trying to distract the audience while the executives were doing damage control behind the curtain.

You mention that once you give the state this much overreach, you’re out. (Overreach in what? Please correct my assumption, but I am assuming you mean, “the overreach to decide on how to obtain resources (taxes), and distribute them in a fair manner.”) 

If the debate is about equitable (and fair... I mean, who can argue against fairness, right?) distribution, then, do you sincerely believe the corporate class is more trusting than the political class?

todayilearned,fctrax2,t1_fctd7hd,1577955447.0,"You mentioned in a previous comment that you were in the top 5% of the income bracket. 

I don’t think anyone is arguing to “steal” (word you used) your income if you’re the top 5%. 

According to Investopedia, the top 5% of households earn around $299,000/year. 

This is a household defined with dual incomes. 

You, being the 5%, is NOT whom these laws are intended to be aimed at. 

You’re doing well, very well, but you’re certainly not “rich”. 

The reason why I say you’re not “rich”, is because you also mentioned in a previous comment, how one “defines sufficient wealth.”

No one is upset at those making $300,000 and less a year. 

YOU are not the problem with America. As a matter of fact, I think you’re one of the situations where YOU are a great asset to our country. You’re solidly upper middle class. You’re the type of citizen that has a great effect in the economy. You probably have a moderate savings account, probably consume goods and services that keep other Americans employed, but not so damn wealthy that your wealth no longer brings value to our country. 

In my opinion I think people like you shouldn’t have their assets touched. 

When you ask, “what is too much wealth”, I think 90% of Americans mean those rich people that have so much fucking money, that their money sitting in their savings, is not doing good, (and also harming) our country. 

We are talking about people that make millions a year, while they’re not using their wealth to generate more wealth for the country as a whole. People that have multi billion dollar corporations, but whose employee still have to rely on the state for food, medical care, and shelter. (This is a market failure)

At $300,000 a year, you are not the problem. You don’t have that power over anyone. These laws aren’t aimed at you."
