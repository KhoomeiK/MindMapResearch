I'm usually in decent shape, but after an injury and a death in the family, I realized I had gained so much. Reforming those habits are hard, and dammit it's cold, so I really don't want to go to the gym in the morning. I can't run as far or fast as I used to, and can't lift as much as before, but we both got out of bed and did something. And that's what counts. If you can keep it up and just get past the feeling of ""i don't want to"" and at least do something everyday, you'll get there."

We don't all live near each other and we knew it would be the last trip my grandma could make it on, and every one on the ship made it absolutely amazing. From making sure we ALL got to sit together for EVERY meal, to having our cabins close, squeezing us all in photos that the background isn't big enough for, and being able to meet everyone's needs from the antsy 3 year old to the 84 year old with a wheelchair and oxygen tank. She's gone now, and  those are the memories we will all hang on to when we remember her at the end. That is and probably always will be my favorite experience and I will forever be grateful for each and every cast member that helped make it so special for her and each one of us"

That could work. It's not what I had in mind, but it could work"
crochet,fccadq3,t3_eh1uoy,1577596150.0,"Heres a link to the square blanket I've made before. I thought if I added a corner stitch on parallel sides it would make a rectangle, and that's not the case so far.

I put everything on the hangar that I can, underwear, scarves, tank tops, etc. That way I just spend a few minutes extra while putting laundry away, and I don't have to think about outfits the rest of the week"
