worldnews,fey99c9,t1_fey8jv3,1579442415.0,"No, nothing can be done to prevent bushfires in Australia, because it’s part of the ecology and the environment here. 

And nothing can be done to make them not worse when it’s hotter and drier. That’s ground zero, from there we can work on how do we prevent the damage they cause as best we can, not just move away. 

Why don’t you move down here and share your expert knowledge with the fire services? I’m sure if you just put your heads together you’ll be able to solve the issue completely. It’s not like they wouldn’t have thought of it before.

- “More off season burning” What target do you think should be achieved? How are they falling short now? What about the fact that only areas burned *this year* had any effect in slowing down the fires?
- “If it is too wet, then clearing  with equipment.” Too wet? Hilarious. It’s been too hot and dry, hazard reduction burning is dangerous at the best of times, that makes it much harder. Clearing with equipment is done around towns but I think you underestimate how remote and inaccessible most of the Australian bush is.
- “Removal of brush around homes in fire prone areas.” Nah we just let it build up, LOL. There’s laws around doing this. 
- “Increase fines for discarded cigarettes from cars.” It’s now $11,000. 
- “AU has a history of fires :(“ We fucking know.

You are the one that made the claim that these fires were due to bad management, it’s up to you to prove it."
worldnews,fey513r,t1_fey49g1,1579440870.0,"Mate, that’s not what I’m saying at all. Things can be done and are being done. But in the absence of burning the entire country down to stop a fire burning the entire country down, after a few years of record heat and dry, all that can be done when the inevitable fires turn into mega-fires is try to protect property, limit the damage to the bush, and wait for rain. 

I was honestly all ears for your thoughts and suggestions, but you don’t have any.

To give you an indication, here’s how fires spread in Australia (up to a firebreak in front of a town). Notice it’s the treetops that are burning. https://youtu.be/u6jbx0vlRiE"
worldnews,fexutzg,t1_fexunlb,1579436786.0,"Mate, you’re blaming fire prevention *without even knowing what happens currently*.

Yes, we can do more, but there will be fires every year in Australia no matter what, because it’s covered in fuel that wants to burn. And when it’s hotter and drier like it is now they’ll be worse. Capiche?

You know nothing, and you’re not willing to be educated, so you don’t get a say."
worldnews,fextnwz,t1_fexs916,1579435884.0,"I’m not a firefighter but there’s copious information online. According to the NSW fire chief the burn targets were met this year. The problem is the extreme heat and drought In the last few years (combined with fire being a natural phenomenon in the bush) meant:

- The period we can safely burn in the off season without just causing a huge bushfire was reduced. 
- Areas burned even two years ago had no effect on slowing these fires, they just burnt right through it again. Which means, of course, we would have had to burn the whole bush down last year to prevent... the whole bush burning down. 

Firebreaks and preventative burns are typical features in Australia that have been going on for decades, they’re a part of life. But when you’re faced with a megafire creating it’s own weather systems, lighting fires in front of it with dry lightning and ember sparks blown 30km on the wind, 30 story tall flames travelling at 40kmh, burning an area the size of Kentucky, there’s only so much you can do.

And there’s an $11,000 fine for flicking cigarettes or infringing fire bans, and serious jail time for arsonists. 

These fires are not the result of bad forestry management practices, and you should be ashamed saying they are, with absolutely no knowledge. And then saying “well they should do more” as if you can just stop a natural phenomenon, 🤦‍♂️."

- The areas they cleared just two years ago are currently burning, so to prevent this fire they would have had to have burned the entire country last year. 
- People complained about smoke but they did the burns anyway. 
- The time they can safely do hazard reduction burns, without it spreading out of control, has reduced. Last year was our hottest and driest on record: hot and dry = not safe to burn. We had out of control bushfires in the last weeks of winter, 
- Despite that, the burn targets were met. In NSW alone, that’s an area of 200,000 hectares. 

Shane Fitzsimmons is an unbiased, knowledgeable person that should be listened to. His father died in a hazard reduction burn, but he’s upped the burn targets since he’s been in office. 

You, however, don’t know what you’re talking about, and don’t really care. An earlier comment of yours said we don’t clear “brush” or do preventative burns *at all*. 

You’re just wanting everything you’re obviously learning about for the first time to fit in your pre-conceived notions. It’s insulting that you’re so ignorant, but feel entitled to give your opinion on the matter.
