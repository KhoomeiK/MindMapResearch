boardgames,ff7c8eg,t3_eryyda,1579646163.0,1889 is a great board game from Japan.
todayilearned,ff5t06v,t1_ff4x8cv,1579609116.0,Well with the Stasnys (and Sutters) you get both brother *and* family points.
todayilearned,ff4fyl8,t1_ff4eau2,1579562680.0,Bingo.
todayilearned,ff4fnt2,t1_ff3y52g,1579562478.0,He was on the Lightning.
todayilearned,ff4flb6,t1_ff415e0,1579562431.0,Yeah but Jared played like 20 games and I dont think Mark ever scored a point on purpose.
todayilearned,ff4ffho,t1_ff48gk2,1579562321.0,Gordie and Mark Howe are probably fairly high for a pair. 1800 some for Gordie and I'm sure Mark put up at least 600 or so points from the blueline.
todayilearned,ff4f90h,t1_ff4ca66,1579562198.0,Sutter brothers had more. But most for a pair - yeah.
todayilearned,ff4f7cb,t1_ff4cf3b,1579562166.0,"Sutter's do - unless question is limited to ""pair"" of brothers."
todayilearned,ff4f517,t1_ff4depu,1579562124.0,Not the Staals. Sutter brothers do (there were six of them). They win by like 100 points.
18XX,fey5pvx,t1_fewztpz,1579441158.0,About 1/2 inch has worked for me.  I think it was like 9 bucks on Amazon (freedom credits).
hockey,fextt1c,t1_feu2ay3,1579436069.0,Crosby easily. Ovi is a closer call but I think falls short. Playoff inconsistency just keeps him from that rarified air imo.
hockey,fextpox,t3_eqlyts,1579435948.0,LW? No. Goalscorer? Close - probably yes.
hockey,feph59w,t3_eq3bvj,1579320370.0,No.
boardgames,felnrnk,t1_fekxqjy,1579226590.0,"You can find the files for 89 and 49 on their bgg pages under files.  There are a few different versions for each, but the differences are basically just style.

I got the 28 files from a link by jc Lawrence on bgg, so you can probably find it on google. I dont remember where I got the EU files, but they also shouldn't be too hard to find."
boardgames,fekzsvs,t3_epp2iv,1579211021.0,A COIN game based on the emu war. Make it happen.

boardgames,fegq9ln,t1_fefyfwv,1579099988.0,89 is also available to print and play.
boardgames,fefw74z,t1_fef62j0,1579067195.0,1889 or 18Chesapeake are solid entry titles.
boardgames,fee1moq,t1_fedz9og,1579024516.0,Almost all 18xx games are asymmetric regarding the companies (67 is the only one I can think of off hand that isnt). I think 18GB might have something like variable player powers as well? Not sure about that one - only heard about it from the Train Rush guys.
boardgames,fedhc8f,t3_eogak0,1579011533.0,My entire group now owns Decrypto and BattleLine.
hockey,fec77s0,t3_eoallh,1578967840.0,Tampa should go back. I miss those unis.
boardgames,fea5f3l,t1_fea1mdq,1578944567.0,Game sucks either way. House rules just extend the torture.
boardgames,fdyxq4q,t3_ene1vv,1578784639.0,"Star trek. Game of Thrones. Malazan. 

I mean - yeah. Anything. Ants. Trees.  Cars.  Whatever you want. It's a simple game."

hockey,fdq5ek9,t1_fdq3rmv,1578655628.0,Yes.

boardgames,fdley1v,t3_em012e,1578522566.0,"I preordered this on a lark and absolutely love it.  Not the prettiest and some of the flags are a bit too similar, but it's a ton of fun."
boardgames,fdk1fph,t1_fdj5bao,1578493680.0,89 is a nice entry level game. So is Ches.

boardgames,fddtttw,t3_ekpx7c,1578323813.0,"Mine is in my basement, but a decent dehumidifier takes care of the moisture.

As for risk - absolutely. Before I officially built my game room down there I put two games downstairs for about four months  and both got moldy and had to be thrown out (they were old games - Monopoly and Risk, but still)."
boardgames,fddqc1z,t1_fddpxui,1578321141.0,"Privates are a bit different, and the map is different, but I'm wondering the same thing."
boardgames,fddqa48,t3_ekgrjm,1578321095.0,"1822 definitely. Maybe 1889, but I already own that so I'm not sure (also not sure how often I'll play 89 when I get Ches in)."
boardgames,fdatc7i,t3_ekgk3u,1578249866.0,I just hit thrift stores for my chairs.
boardgames,fd97le7,t1_fd95rui,1578229621.0,"It just has more rules, and has some significant differences from most 18xxs.  Two track gauges, a poor map which is especially unforgiving, a huge but tile manifest, and non-conventional trains are probably the biggest reasons.

Like I said - not impossible, just more rules to remember for a first play which will make it harder to understand and - if the other players are also new - a much harder game to teach.  I would worry about scaring newcomers away from 18xx if this was their first, whereas something like 18Chesapeake or 1889 has less rules overhead while still giving the full 18xx experience."
boardgames,fd5iouv,t3_ek3txx,1578178002.0,I mean - economic games? War games?
boardgames,fcytix4,t1_fcuzo1k,1578086757.0,"1862 is not a beginner friendly 18xx. One of the tougher rulesets honestly. 

1889 and 18Chesapeake are good though."
boardgames,fcuupxm,t3_eiyy8d,1577988910.0,"So me and a buddy got two war games done this week - Freemans Farm and Sekigahara. 

Freemans Farm was... not a great experience for us.  It felt incredibly random with both the cards and the constant dice rolls with little chance to mitigate.  Not looking to get that one to the table again any time soon.

Sekigahara I liked a lot more, but my buddy had some issues internalizing the movement rules, which led to him putting some armies in bad spots at times.  Definitely want to play again though."
boardgames,fcu91ln,t3_eiyo3m,1577975443.0,Good time to love train games.
boardgames,fcu62t5,t1_fcu368b,1577973446.0,"I've played Ches. Its 1830 down to the privates with a slightly nicer market (more ledges), more lucrative board, and train exporting to keep the game moving. It takes away a tension point with the last 4T, but I think it's very beginner friendly while still being solid on its own."
boardgames,fcsxleb,t1_fcsts2o,1577927660.0,"49 would be tougher as a first, but outside of stuff like 17 and OE, I don't think any are impossible. 89, Chesapeake are good starting points though. 30 isn't bad either."
boardgames,fcrr849,t1_fcridl3,1577905527.0,"1817 is a massive game that has a ton of financial shenanigans, including shorting stock.  It's a unique game.

49 is pretty different from 89 and 30. Incremental cap, two track gauges, and companies can close. Also the order of companies is random (and they have to be floated in that order). Fantastic game, but a bit more complicated."

boardgames,fcn7hnw,t1_fcn47vw,1577805274.0,"Age of Steam has plenty to chew on. Cube rails (such as Irish Gauge) introduce share holding.

Edit: that being said, I dont think 18xx is a huge step up in complexity from AoS. One of the smaller ones like 89 or Ches should not be hard for a guy that knows AoS."
boardgames,fckmeav,t1_fckedhj,1577728481.0,"I'd point out that there is way more variety in 18xx than you give credit for (mergers, auctions, capitalization, company sizes, in a couple of games companies themselves can buy stock, different track gauges and train types, etc), but if you dont have a group ready and willing to try 18xx, cube rails aren't bad by any stretch."

boardgames,fciupjd,t1_fciivjj,1577670259.0,"Well... UR 1830 BC is probably the closest, but of the big ones, I'd say FCM, Indonesia, and Bus all capture part of the spirit."
boardgames,fcibt68,t1_fcia5o1,1577660245.0,"I mean- you sell a share it goes down, companies float at x%, and cant have more than x% in the open market. Not a whole lot more to it than that from a rules perspective. 

Lacerda simply isn't comparable imo. As to your experience  - I dont know what it was, but splotter fans and 18xx fans have a lot of overlap. One of the things I appreciate about 18xx is since the mechanics are similar it doesn't take long to play a new one competently, while splotters are each a very unique beast."
boardgames,fcib9kv,t1_fchc4f1,1577660042.0,"Maybe not 30, but why not a game of 89?

I agree Cube rails are much easier to get to the table and good in their own right, but it doesn't scratch nearly the same itch for me."
boardgames,fcib3hw,t1_fci9ngl,1577659981.0,"The thing is - 18xx isn't that complex. In a stock round you can do one of two things  - buy or sell. In an Operating Round you go through 7 steps and either do or dont do the available actions at those steps. 

The mechanics are simple. The decision space is not. The only thing that approaches that sort of simplicity to depth ratio that I've come across are splotters."
boardgames,fchmnr1,t1_fch3nfi,1577651895.0,"Tbf I dont think 18xx games are that complicated compared to a lot of Euros on the rules side. I feel like you could get a thorough teach in about 15 minutes outside of 1817, 60, 52, and 41 type games."

boardgames,fca427e,t3_egt2e2,1577562769.0,Just call it when theres a clear winner? 18xx can have someone run away with it. Just shake their hand and start a new game.
boardgames,fc2mley,t1_fc2lq55,1577367213.0,"I'm of the opinion that while it has a stock market, it's not really a ""stock game"" like 18xx. There is very little manipulation of the market that goes on as far as dumping companies, manipulating prices, or floating new companies."
boardgames,fc2egln,t1_fc1eu8z,1577355487.0,Try 1889 or 18Chesapeake when it comes out. CotBS isn't really 18xx style beyond having a stock market.

boardgames,fbxzuaq,t3_ef1sdw,1577204686.0,"So general strategy question on when to start second companies in 1830 derivatives (89, Chessie, Mex, etc.).  It seems there are two trains of thought here (heh) - assuming a game where you're pretty likely to be able to start a second (so not 5p 89 or 6 player 30 or something) - I generally start my second generally when you have either just popped or are about to pop the 5s.  This allows me to obviously buy a permanent for both companies and run them fairly well.  But should I be floating one earlier instead? A recent game of Mex a lot of people floated their second before the 4s popped (which with the one train per OR means you tend to have a decent amount of capital early to do so).  

Just general thoughts or advice here?"
hockey,fbwpkrm,t3_ee9ml6,1577156046.0,Yeah top 100 player Jonathan Toews is right Blackhawks never get overrated.
