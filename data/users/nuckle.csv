fuckthesepeople,fdy2ywa,t1_fdwymqu,1578775481.0,"It pretty fucking embarrassing on my part but here it goes:

I bought a super pricey cpu for which I had never socketed before with an asus motherboard. When I went to seat it i couldn't get it seated properly and couldnt figure it out. I contacted asus support and told them the problems I was having. The support guy told me to seat it a certain way, I tried it and it still didn't feel right. At this point I hadn't closed the bar down on it.  I took photos and sent them to the support guy, he said all was good to go ahead and seat it as I had it. I did as he told me and it turned out the guy apparently had no idea what the fuck he was doing either. I kept records of all the chats and tried to talk to management. For days and days it went on until finally they said you are fucked and I was out the cost of the cpu the support guy had me break.

I haven't bought a single Asus product since and try to trash them as every chance I get.

\* I buy lots of hardware."
