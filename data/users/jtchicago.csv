I didn't want to be home all the time with my family so I went on Tinder and met this handsome, funny medical student. We had an amazing weekend together. Almost surreal. He drove me to the airport. I offered to him to travel to me but he didn't want me to pay. I've thought about him and what would've happened if I stayed. It makes me a little sad but I met someone here who is pretty wonderful."

jobs,ffh80ms,t3_etaggh,1579925730.0,"I saw a speech therapist/interview coach for a few weeks. Here are my takeaways.

1. Pause before you answer. That moment gives the interviewer time to finish speaking. It also helps formulate thoughtful responses and slows down your speech.
2. Give yourself an additional moment if needed.
3. If the questions are convoluted, ask yourself what interviewer is trying to determine. (One interviewer gave me an extremely specific, hypothetical scenario. He wanted to know how I prioritize.)
4. Breathe! Seriously.
5. Limit your responses to a few sentences. Let them ask for elaboration."

What's the difference? Also, no need to list ""ability to work independently..."" and ""Excellent Communication Skills"". Rating the latter skill is subjective. Be consistent with capitalization and punctuation (""execution of strict""   
 and ""maintained product integrity"" have periods while others do not)."
resumes,ffepuab,t3_et3gcd,1579859456.0,"If they are very similar (as in the same responsibilities), it would be redundant to have the labs listed twice. I would include your prior experience to show that you have a work history and skills relevant to your internship."

resumes,ffbcjs6,t3_eslscm,1579759672.0,"1. List your most recent education first, which is your UI/UX Design program.
2. What is ""tech foundation""?
3. I'm not savvy on grammar but there is inconsistency in the wording of your job responsibilities. For example, your current server job uses verbs like ""training"" and ""troubleshoot"" while the job before uses ""High standard of customer service"". The following uses ""Accepting, delivering"", etc. 
4. Use ""oversees"" instead of ""overseeing"", ""maintained"" instead of ""responsible for"", ""troubleshooted"" instead of ""troubleshooting"", ""provided high standard"" instead of ""high standard of service"", etc.
5. Use past tense for previous job responsibilities.

I can't tell what kind of career you're looking for in this resume. I see UX/UI Design but you mentioned an e-commerce job. UX/UI design isn't relevant to the job so perhaps remove ""Currently learning UX/UI Design"" and list specific skills related to the e-commerce job. 

Overall, a good start. I know it can be frustrating to change careers when you have little to no experience. Funny, I studied an area that's similar to HR. I didn't think I would want to work in HR but HR has SO many functions. If you're ""techy"", there are jobs in HR Analytics and HRIS (HR Information Systems). I love working with data so those two jobs are quite appealing. Just FYI."
resumes,ffbbec2,t3_esn4cw,1579758444.0,"1. Avoid adverbs like ""efficiently"" and ""accurately"".
2. I would probably merge the first two responsibilities of your Data Entry Operator. ""Prepared Department of Revenue and Department of Public Health documents into IL database.""
3. ""Performed routine closing procedures and security measures""
4. ""Patrolled premises to prevent potential losses, theft, and vandalism""
5. ""Informed and reported violators of rule infractions such as touching artwork, unauthorized photography""
6. Remove ""Applied effective communication..."".
7. Use ""Provided customer service and assisted visitors by providing directions and answering general questions""
8. ""Performed general housekeeping which included sanitation of work areas""
9. ""Restocked merchandise and removed expired items""
10. ""Answered general inquiries and promoted new products""
11. ""Loaded, transported and delivered groceries to local clients""
12. ""Reviewed orders and delivery information for accuracy""
13. ""Entered Form 1040 into IL IRS database""
14. ""Operated farm equipment in compliance with safety regulations""
15. ""Transported large volumes of water to nearby facility""
16. ""Maintained farm equipment such as parts replacement and routine (whatever)
17. If you don't have a degree, don't highlight ""None in"". If you are pursuing a degree, then it's fine to say ""Bachelor's of Science in Whatever"". I would include expected graduation date and list relevant coursework.

Overall, an okay resume. I would shorten and word the job responsibilities differently. I recommend looking up ""data entry"", ""stock associate"", etc. resumes or job descriptions for inspiration, which is what I did. I'd list more skills too."
AskWomen,ff6hfsn,t3_erqfef,1579627274.0,"Not really a ""malfunction"", but I wore all white on a first date with a BF. I didn't care to check my calendar for some reason. Things were going so well until I went to the bathroom. I told him that I needed to go home because my period started. I didn't want the date to end so I invited him to my apartment (without expectations). He immediately offered me his sweater to wrap around my waist. I thought that was so sweet. We went back to my place and spent the next 10 hours together. Best date ever."

jobs,fdpeofd,t3_em8cus,1578626693.0,"I've been seeing a speech therapist/interview coach. (I strongly suggest seeking out those services.) I learned a few things:

1. Before responding, give yourself a moment to think of a thoughtful answer.
2. A pause also gives the recruiter a moment to finish speaking.
3. Keep responses brief and concise. If you ramble as I do, give them a short ""summary"" followed by details. Example: ""What did you do at your last job?"" Answer: ""I managed a sales team of fifty employees and lead regional business development efforts."" Elaborate when they ask.
4. At the end of the interview, ask them specific questions rather than ""What's the company culture?"". Instead, ask "" What activities does the company offer to promote team building?""
5. This is probably a given, but send a post-interview thank-you e-mail."

AskWomen,fdm7vat,t1_fdls472,1578541965.0,Sounds like my younger sister (your middle sibling). I don't get why. I haven't done anything to her.
AskWomen,fdm7seq,t3_em0dan,1578541907.0,"Like u/x0rose, I have given up my relationship with my sister. I've spent all of my life trying to have a positive one. She, despite being younger, bullied me throughout childhood. She is highly critical, condescending and bossy. She is a mean person. She wasn't supportive when I suffered from depression and BPD. I was sexually assaulted twice and she was annoyed by the whole thing. She'd tell me that I'm too sensitive. (I told her she was too and she got angry at me. lol.) She lives an IG lifestyle. She travels, parties, dines yet when I asked for a $12 hot water kettle for Christmas she got angry because I didn't say ""please"" and that I shouldn't expect her to get me anything. She makes almost $100k. If I made that much, I would buy the kettle without a second thought. She works at a major consulting firm. I've been trying to get a job there for years but she doesn't want to refer me. I asked her if she could connect me with someone in HR but she refuses because she ""doesn't know any HR employees"" (she won't reach out to one). I've been unemployed for three months. I could really use some help, any help.

She and I are two very different people. Relationships are important to me. I like helping people when I can. My younger sister only cares about herself and her small bubble of friends. She lacks any empathy and compassion.

Before anyone tells me that I shouldn't expect her to help me get a job, you're right. That's unrealistic. I wanted to talk to someone in her HR department about the company and the roles I've been applying for. I appreciate my friends, former professors, and acquaintances that have helped me during my job search. Even my chiropractor sent me a job listing for his medical group. They know it's a tough job market and that references are incredibly important. 

Before anyone tells me that I shouldn't expect a Christmas gift, maybe you're right. Maybe I shouldn't have asked her. I thought, at $12, my younger sister would LIKE that the kettle was cheap and practical. (My baby sister immediately offered to get a kettle, which I declined but she sent me one anyway. She didn't have to do that but she tells me that she loves me. My baby sister is a darling.) $12 is the cost of a fancy salad. 

Also, my younger sister made it apparent that it was a financial burden to visit me for my college graduation. I asked her to come. I didn't need her to come. But hey, she went to Australia and New Zealand for an all girl's trip. Not cheap but don't tell her that because she'll curse you.

I'm ranting a little bit. I try not to think about her anymore. I don't need to waste my time with someone who won't reciprocate friendship.

TLDR; My younger sister is not very nice."

depression,fdbwdbo,t3_ekcqrj,1578262846.0,"No one ""beats"" mental illness. Mental illness is often neurobiological.  It can usually be treated effectively to minimize the symptoms and allow the individual to function. I've suffered from depression and borderline personality disorder for most of my life. I started feeling better when I learned and applied DBT skills. DBT changed and saved my life. I experience BPD and depressive symptoms sometimes but they aren't life-threatening. You should strive to be ""better"". Happiness is temporary, as it should be, that's how we know the value of it."
