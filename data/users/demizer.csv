politics,ffdm3sx,t1_ffctwic,1579823789.0,"This is what happened in 2016. The DNC shoved Hillary in our faces and the voters wanted Bernie. So they voted for Trump, or just didn't bother at all. We all knew Trump would be a disaster, but honestly, it's going to have to get much worse than this before we get real change."
politics,ffdlksz,t1_ffcntrj,1579823466.0,"I've been commenting the last few months that there is no way trump is leaving at this point. If he loses in November and actually leaves office, he is going to jail. No way he is going to do that willingly. The GOP is complicit, also no way they will give up power to be prosecuted."
SanJose,ffci6lx,t1_ffcguo3,1579799990.0,"We adopted a sweet girl from Rocket Dog Rescue. The first few nights she could not sleep, so we got some cbd treats to ease her into her new home. We would give her half of the treat and my puppy the other half. While she calmed down a bit, the puppy acted weird. It was strange."
politics,ffas9z9,t1_ffam4dc,1579743311.0,"They know trump is not going to leave no matter the outcome, and we won't protest it because we are afraid of losing our jobs and healthcare."
cars,ff8319q,t1_ff6jq35,1579664659.0,My 2016 Maxima had 80k and no problems with the CVT. I sold it to get something more fuel efficient. It was a great car while we had it.
cars,ff82jch,t1_ff6i8a6,1579664294.0,I got ANOTHER recall for my 2016 Maxima today. This is like the 8th one in 4 years. Good thing I sold it.

teslamotors,ff46sju,t1_ff3onda,1579556787.0,Their quality control is not great. Not sure why it has not been fixed yet. A lot of people who buy the cars don't have an eye for quality. The shit I found when taking delivery of my model 3 in December my wife did not notice nor even care about.
teslamotors,ff46ii2,t1_ff3pw5s,1579556616.0,"One of my door handle on the model 3 I took delivery of in december at the Fremont factory was not flush with the door skin. They said they would need to replace the door. Fuck that. I'm just going to live with it. That, and a rattling sound from within the dash were the only two problems."
teslamotors,ff461l3,t1_ff3lb6y,1579556324.0,I'll take a lower quality car over having the culture of working 12 hour days 6 days a week for little pay. Fuck. That.

politics,feima5d,t1_fei6b4y,1579141849.0,I hope the DNC gets leveled. It is more concerned about big money donations then actually saving us from the most dangerous president in the history of the United States.
politics,feg30w1,t1_fefw5bu,1579074698.0,And it seems they made a lot of money getting Trump elected unfortunately.

Machinists,fdpscfm,t1_fdp37i0,1578638597.0,"We had the 2002 version of this machine at a shop I once worked at. One night the latch broke off of the arm at the point it attached to the fancy door that slid in and out during tool changes. The tool change arm did not give a fuck and whacked the shit out of the door. The arm and the door had to be replaced.

 The guy the programmed this machine got it to make some really nice parts, but we barely used 1% of the machines capabilities. He was the only person that was allowed to program it."
