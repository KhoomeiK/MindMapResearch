Warhammer,ffepxtv,t1_ffepsb8,1579859608.0,I just feel its all hight. No other space has been used. He could be pointing his staff forward 1 for less hight 2 for more dynamic magic casting pose.
Warhammer,ffepvuo,t1_ffeihbk,1579859524.0,I was thinking this. Compare to the cyber horses. And the cyber horses have more fluid and natural motion. The elves seem to hark back to the older models.
motorcycle,ff3jfwo,t3_eqz5qj,1579542336.0,"I've just picked up a pair of gore tex Richa(? They have Richa written all over the glove) they are winter pair doing quite well combined with handle bar mittens in - 1 UK weather. No phone conductivity (just tried) but I've never seen any phone comparable main gloves but then I've never looked. I picked up a base layer glove from a walking shop that does have connectivity that I can use to keep a bit of heat in if I have to check the phone when I stop.

Hope that helps."
sylvaneth,feh4qut,t1_feh245m,1579109115.0,I second this. it shows that the roots are commnig from all directions. you could even attempt to make the skeleton muddy to show its original location. true dwellers below fashion.
AskReddit,fctmvfp,t1_fcsqxb1,1577949418.0,I'd thought about this one for a while. First thing I would do is add special energy/essential vitimin and mineral storage in my body. As well as the ability to photosynthesis or absorb minerals from the ground (not sure how).
britishproblems,fckkslj,t3_ehk5uf,1577727493.0,"My pet peve is when mummy comes in on the stretcher with baby. Sitting calmly. And is saying. We had a ride in the 'nenor'. Baby's fine, ambulance hasn't had any intervention with baby.
When asking mum is anyone with her she states: they came from home and dad (who was also at home) is parking the car and will join momentarily.

If you came from home and had a car. That you've just drove in. Why not drive in as soon as you were told to come. Why waste an ambulance and drive in at the same time!"
LearnUselessTalents,fcjcuic,t1_fcibsqu,1577683285.0,"It's better to breath as you normally do however in times of stress or when you arnt actually focusing upon anything. I. E washing up or sitting down or just walking with no other distractions. Focus upon deep full bellied breathing.

Each breath is relaxed. Not forced just natural. All your doing is ensuring you getting a full breath. Hold it a second before a gentle exhale. Do this regularly and your natural breathing will change."
LearnUselessTalents,fcd9pek,t1_fcd4j87,1577607981.0,I'm going to add to this though with some of my own thoughts. Practicing intervals of shallow breathing must not have a completely negative impact however it will most likely improve how much oxygen your blood can contain in single breaths. Much like practicing swimming under water improves how long you can swim underwater. Thus for stressful situations having practiced this breathing it may help. However there are probably better ways. Such as endurance exercising with very short breaks in between. As you'll improve the body's ability to work and it's recovery time.
LearnUselessTalents,fcd4j87,t1_fcbqq7u,1577606266.0,"Not a professional in this just an idiot who does it some times. Start by lying down. Or when your in bed before sleep. Just spend a few breaths 3-5 just taking shallow breaths.  

A bit of science: everything I've looked for has come up negative for 'benifit of shallow breathing.' as your reducing your air intake to your body as well as how much waste gas you can expel from your body. Prolonged shallow breathing causes a build up in c02 in your system imparting brain function. Raising stress and blood pressure. And reduce energy. 

Deep breathing was the primary results of any 'benifit of shallow breathing search' which is useful for proper gaseous exchange,  reduced stress, relaxed muscles, improve energy, reduce blood pressure and when focused upon can improve mindfulness and aid in handling stressful or tense situations. 

Edit: science.

When I tried wet blending I wasn't very good with the technique. (still not) and ruined what I was happy with."
