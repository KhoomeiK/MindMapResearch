And all the precedents and procedures that Trump has trampled over have been very little use in stopping him from doing exactly as he wants.

I don't think our current system is inefficient, I think it is beholden to interests that do not have either our best interests or the interests of the planet at heart. 

I don't disagree that the rise of right wing nationalistic populism is a response to a failure of democracy, but I also think democracy was deliberately made to fail. For simplicity's sake, I'll blame Murdoch (but there are other powerful liars as well).

I certainly can understand the desire for an outsider, but I don't know why they would vote for an ostensible billionaire. Once you have that kind of money you are an insider no matter what you do. It's not like the political elite that Trump has brought into power has done anything worthwhile, the very few who manage to stick around."

Ever noticed how things can be funnier with a friend? You find yourself laughing at and enjoying things that aren't so funny on their own, but with their sense of humour are enhanced? 

We are social animals and laughing together is one way we bond. Our monkey brains like it when we have the same response to something as those around us. That's part of why on the internet you'll get these included emotional responses to these jokes. People want to know it's not weird to laugh, basically, that the collective culture that you are part of approves of the joke.

Tumblr even has its own unique collective culture or hivemind about how it expresses this joke signifier, which you identify. Personally, I think Tumblr's collective personality is cute as fuck, and is both feminine and lgbtq coded, which is a nice change from the straight maleness of Reddit's collective voice.

newzealand,fdzxdtt,t1_fdzt58b,1578798115.0,"Added to the difficulty of investment, I suspect another major obstacle is the legal framework. There's lots of stuff designed for the typical business structure, and I think you'd struggle to get a lawyer to develop the processes you'd need, and make them match with what's actually out there. I'm also speaking out of ignorance as to the 

In my example co-op, and because I already work in a professional field, there is an example of co-ops already: Partnerships, like in law or accounting or architecture. Some people get together and start a business and they share ownership. It works in professional fields because the start-up costs are in education and experience (social capital), paid for by personal loans, and starting a new business requires little capital investment. Once you're chartered, you can start a business from your bedroom should you choose. A more ideal form of this would be to drastically lower the barrier to entry for someone to be a partner, and have tiers of partnership, so your graduates are granted a tiny say and share, and your seniors have more. 

It's a bit different if you think of a fish and chip shop. Ma and Pa needed to take out a mortgage to buy the place, and to allow all the other workers to have an equal stake to Ma and Pa, they would either have to take on a similar share of the debt, or the business would have to own its own debt. But that would be the same as if there was some other kind of investor, the business would have to buy out that investor's stake for it to be shared among the workers. 

In general, I think that the rewards for ownership are often out of proportion to the rewards of labour, especially when there's any form of limited liability at play. The fact that I own shares in a Kiwisaver fund, and through that fund I'm demanding with my money's tiny voice that all the businesses on the stock exchange to eat themselves alive if its necessary to make my numbers go up is quite disgusting to me. I don't exactly have a solution to that, just that it's gross. I am complicit in my own oppression (if I worked for a publicly traded company. But I'm sure that my money is invested in property holding companies with an interest in keeping house prices out of my reach forever, so I'm still part of my own problem).

Perhaps my solution (if I ruled the world and could bring about my luxury space communist utopia) would be to limit the rights of ownership over a business, that every new person brought onto the business created new shares in it, so that an investor in said business would be incentivised to sell their stake back into the business sooner rather than later, lest their stake diminish. I'd probably also set up public or community based mechanisms to invest in new business and allow more people to start their own. Lowering the barriers to entrepreneurship to extend it past the class of people who already have money can only be a good thing."
newzealand,fdzud2q,t1_fdzbk4p,1578796003.0,"I'm not so sure. I work for a very small company, and if there were a mechanism by which I was gaining a share of ownership in the business (while I still worked there), I would still be deferring to my more experienced boss to be making the decisions. It's likely that my other colleagues who don't have the same insight into our industry would also defer to his expertise. 

In this scenario, I would be less insulated from the risks involved in the business, and would expect a lesser salary, with the balance being made up from the company's profits. my boss on the other had would be more accountable to his employees, and would have a greater duty to us to explain his decisions and why he's making them, but the business risks would also be shared with the employees. I'm also not sure whether I would want that style of involvement with the business, I don't know if I know enough to properly assess whether my boss does a good job and I don't know if I'm interested in taking on that responsibility. But if I were getting a share of the profits, I'd have more incentive to increase profits than I do now, where my practical incentives (regardless of what's on paper) are to develop my career and do the exact minimum work to avoid getting fired/get a sufficiently good reference to move on.

That's just one possible model of a worker-owned small business. I'm sure there are others with different incentives and structures.  

Certainly I don't think there's much incentive for an entrepreneur to do this to their own business in our current society, besides ideology. A co-op makes sense when there are a number of equal partners sharing the risk. 

Fonterra, for example is a spectacularly poorly performing co-op. My pet theory on this is because the farming community cannot afford the risks that Fonterra need to take, which condemns Fonterra to expoerting commodity grade products. It's understandable though. Farmers are some of the least secure businesses running, heavily dependent on the weather, commodity prices and a huge number of factors out of their control. If I were them, with my livelihood almost entirely dependent on Fonterra, I'd want one less risky thing going on if at all possible (mind you, there's enough alternatives developing out there that I think there's a few risk takers among farmers).

I suspect if the people employed by Fonterra (the business) were given an ownership stake and could vote on decisions, then there would be an improvement in its performance."
newzealand,fdzsd6j,t1_fdylpad,1578794661.0,"Similar to how a CEO can be fired by the directors after an IPO? 

Besides, in a worker co-op, the boss is not the owner, except in part. If I started a business myself and then hired people, I'd be giving them a smaller stake to represent my own seniority. The business would have to outgrow me before it got rid of me, so if I'm managing poorly to the extent that my workers would do better off without me? Then yes, there should be a mechanism to remove me as manager."

australia,fdjd4ca,t1_fdg1jyc,1578465912.0,"I own some shares. 

That means I have ownership of a tiny piece of a company. If you own something, you can decide what to do with it, within some legal limits. So I own a tiny piece of decision making power over a company. That means I can help this company make all the best decisions, right? Give it a conscience? If enough good people like me own shares in this company, then we'll make it make good decisions. Brilliant. 

But I don't actually own any shares. I have a busy life, spending all day working at a car company and I don't really want to get involved in the decision making process of the flower company that I have shares in. Voting in the city elections is hard enough, fuck, and you expect me to be able to think about this company that operates in a different industry industry and how it should operate? I only get one vote out of a few thousand at the shareholder meetings, why should I bother to go to all the effort? All I want is for the money I can manage to not spend on necessities to grow a bit faster than the speed at which everything's getting more expensive. 

Owning shares in just the one company is a bad idea. I have no idea how they operate, what if the supply of flowers dries up and the company goes under? Then all my savings are gone. Even if I bought into two or three, or two or three dozen companies, that's just more and more effort, and less and less decision making power to have the little bit of influence I can get with my money. So fuck it. I need someone else to manage my money. That person's job will then be to maximise the return on my investment, and I don't have the time or energy to decide on how they vote.

Except I don't go and get a managed fund, people cost money, and so does their time. I'll just get an outfit that buys a little of everything and makes absolutely no decisions. Index fund. They are great. Instead of owning shares and the responsibilities that goes with them, I own a chunk of a fund that owns them for me. 

Except it's even more complicated than that. The fund I've invested in owns all sorts of shit. Bonds, property, other financial products. They don't even own the shares themselves! That's too much work even for the finance company looking after my money! They go through a larger outfit who packages things for them, like I think Vanguard is one. 

So Vanguard makes the choices for me, who hires people whose jobs rely on them encouraging companies to increase share prices above all else, because if Vanguard don't do it, another company will happy do it for them, make better quarterly figures, and my finance company will take their business to the better deal, because ultimately, I'll use the company with the 8% return over the one with the 7% return. I have traded my influence over the companies that I own in order to lower my risk exposure and minimise the work that I need to do. And my shares in those companies demand that those companies eat themselves alive in order to make the numbers get bigger, so they hire lobbyists to write the laws for them that let them do that. So I'm also making the rich evil people richer by lending them my money.

Investing is one of the least ethical activities I engage in. It's right up there with buying clothes or chocolate made by slaves, putting plastic into the ocean and generally helping our civilisation burn itself off the planet. Hell, investing helps do all three things at once, and more besides! Capitalism is a hell of a system.

If my ownership was in the company I worked at, then I'd be able to make informed decisions about it, without too much extra effort and research. I'd already understand the industry, and I might even be in a position to regularly meet the people I elect to direct the company, and they would be mandated to me and my interests. I could have the company eat itself alive for that little bit of extra profit, but then I might be out of a job next month when it all comes crashing down."
worldpolitics,fcvummw,t1_fcuxnyp,1578010474.0,"As a kid, and probably still, there is a well publicised, corporately sponsored kids event called the TRYatholon. As far as I'm aware, the event only has awards for completion. The kid who came in first knows they came in first, and can probably compete in more dedicated events down the line where that will be recognised. But the marketing push for this event is encouraging it's completion and challenging children to train so they can finish so they they know they can do it (and also eat <CORPORATE SPONSOR'S> cereal, of coyrse). The ideal candidate for the completion award is the child who is surprised that they could do it. 

So there is nuance in participation trophies in a 'race'. I have a certificate lying around somewhere that states I completed an outdoor education course that included a half marathon. I didn't really know that I could djo that beforehand, and I probably could again, with some training. So there's some merit there."
Foodforthought,fcq7k7o,t1_fcq5qvq,1577880415.0,"Yes, my argument is better stated along the lines of ""stop being shitty to minorities/immigrants/etc and the economy will grow."" I think you would agree that the slave labourers in US prisons are oppressed to the extent that more authoritarianism in the US would not meaningfully affect their degree of economic participation on an individual level. Societally, more authoritarian government in the US would likely take the form of being tough on crime, so that the private prisons stay nice and full for their oligarch shareholders.

Foodforthought,fcp59b6,t1_fcotq3a,1577850888.0,"I'll hazard a guess: China and America were and are approaching this authoritarian state from different directions in terms of economic development. Over the last century China has industrialised from largely a subsistence economy and then started to convert into a service economy. America has been a service economy for some decades now, relying on an educated workforce to provide those services, as well as a well developed middle class by it's prosperity post-WWII.

Now with this turn towards authoritarianism, the USA will restrict freedoms to a part of its populace that could provide consumer demand, which may diminish the size of the economy. If you make eg gay marriage illegal, gay people won't spend on weddings. 

By contrast, China has been able to use it's authoritarianism to assist it's growth, and I understand that there are still restrictions on freedoms of movement to prevent cities from overcrowding, and negative results from that.

In summary, China is developing it's economy and authoritarianism serves to assist that. America already has slow economic growth characteristic of a developed country, and by adopting authoritarianism it may restrict its growth by reducing demand by oppressing people who could otherwise contribute."

If B then blabs about it on Facebook, then B has breached the order, but A is probably getting in trouble too, just maybe with their boss more than the legal system.

The court (not the government) does have the power to grant name suppression, preventing reporters from naming the person. They also have the power to clear the court under certain circumstances, as well as to forbid the reporting of ant account if court proceedings."
