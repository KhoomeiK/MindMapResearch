The reason why I'm checking out of Drag Race is I'm tired of marginalized persons being deliberately set up to be harassed by an increasingly toxic fan base. The Boulets' ""we're not here to judge your drag because drag is art and art is subjective..."" gives me life, plus having the full spectrum of performers (male, female, non- binary).

That being said, Ru herself is an icon that deserves accolades for drastically increasing visibility. However the show specifically I don't feel is a safe space for the performers in the same way Dragula is."
