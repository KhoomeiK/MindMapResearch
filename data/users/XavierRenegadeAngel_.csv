How are we using this ""false science"" to build the things that rely on them being correct?

For little money, you could build yourself a cloud chamber to demonstrate the effects of radioactive decay. You could do basic science and field strength testing based on that. 

Further than that, you can see that the emergent effects of gravitation are perfectly sufficient to maintain an atmosphere. You can see that where oceans are layered due to different densities.  Yes, the scales are very different but the principle that gravity is able to capture molecules without them becoming dispersed into lower density regions is what's important."

Instinctively, my first question would be, how does one ""store"" phonons since a phonon is just an excitation of the very medium it's traveling through. Kind of like how an ocean wave is merely an excitation in water. It would be like trying to ""store"" a wave in a tank.
