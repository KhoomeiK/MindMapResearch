movies,ff446hk,t1_ff3p4qq,1579555151.0,"I hate when movies gel the need the explain everything. I prefer ambiguity. Let the audience hash out the details. It makes for a more engrossing experience, IMO."

movies,fea16g7,t1_fe9gplk,1578943274.0,"Sony should put out a low key internet campaign seeding the rumor that it was, in fact, a prequel. Boost them DVD and streaming sales."

MMA,fe7v7cn,t3_eo03yg,1578919536.0,"Not much landed, right? Hate to sound disrespectful, but looks like Lewis was just gassed and didn’t want to be in there anymore."
aww,fe7tajd,t3_eo135x,1578919038.0,What on the boob tube? Sound interesting.
MMA,fe7t0l3,t1_fe63v3o,1578918945.0,It’s an MMA thing. Seriously. Not all WMMA fighters are attractive. But they essentially all have great asses.
MMA,fe7ssjm,t1_fe5oeah,1578918873.0,Kind of a bummer how pleasing it is to watch ppl get CTE in slow motion.
MMA,fe7sc22,t3_env9s4,1578918681.0,Definitely not spit. Looked like...I honestly have no idea what that was.

movies,fe69g14,t3_enqrbl,1578884727.0,"Most accounts that I’ve scene lead me to believe it’s a snoozer. If I don’t enjoy watching a movie, it, by default, isn’t good. That’s the main point of film for me."
movies,fe69brf,t1_fe55b9s,1578884647.0,The colonel was supposed to be frail and malnourished. Brando told Coppola he would lose the weight come time to shoot. He ultimately gained weight by the time it came to film his scenes so they altered his character to be a glutton. He just seems like a lazy asshole to me.
MMA,fe5zdwd,t3_enqkfw,1578878332.0,"Who next for WB? Guys a damn good fighter. I’d say, better then his record might indicate."

MMA,fd2kfum,t3_ejrhnw,1578148500.0,So has he changed his fighting style from his first 3 octagon appearance? Or has he just been “lucky” enough to land shots that finish fights quicker in gas last 3?
MMA,fcytfmn,t1_fcyo2dv,1578086700.0,"I just don’t think he has much of a chance against khabib. That is, if khabib would even take the fight. Either way, I wish him well. Hopefully he’s cleaned up his act outside of the cage. For the sake of women and old men."

AskReddit,fcxo4xe,t3_ejdlbw,1578067551.0,One of my friends was accused of sexual assault of another friend. He said/she said type of thing. I went back and fourth a lot between these 2 emotions with both individuals through the ordeal.

MMA,fct3ltx,t3_eijahr,1577931997.0,I feel bad for ppl when they’re picked on. I think that’s why I hate rampage so much. He loves making ppl feel like shit.

MMA,fcntb9j,t3_ehzi4w,1577818008.0,Was this a single day tournament? I’m confused with all these Gifs. Seems like these fighters have multiple wins on the same day?
MMA,fcnt4jq,t3_ei178g,1577817908.0,I’m out of the RIZIN loop. Was this a one day tournament? I asked because I’m pretty sure I just watched a GIF of Pitbull starching some other fighter.
MMA,fcnsugw,t3_ehuaaa,1577817759.0,I’m ok with it. Sounds like an exciting fight. I just hope we don’t consider Conor a triple champ if he wins.
MMA,fcnscl8,t3_ei2yt3,1577817491.0,"Anyone who is excited about this needs to go back and watch his last few UFC fights. I was a huge fan when he was in strike force. But, IMO, didn’t give a fuck anymore during his last 3 fights."
MMA,fcnrz8t,t1_fcnixa7,1577817302.0,I hope he gets back in shape. But a greatly dislike his personality. He just comes off as a bully to me.
MMA,fcnrov8,t1_fcn68rc,1577817149.0,Is it just me or does she come off as being quite stuck up in that clip?
MMA,fcnrahz,t1_fcnlusp,1577816946.0,I disagree. Barboza has incredible standup.
MMA,fcnr1gn,t3_ei0w7x,1577816816.0,"Why is CB allowed to wear shoes? Also, good on homeboy for not following up with any unnecessary shots."
MMA,fcnqvl2,t1_fcmjuwq,1577816729.0,"Not a fan, honestly. It just seems so brutal. Kind of like I thought I’d be a fan of bare knuckle boxing. For the same reason, I am not."

movies,fcm86xt,t1_fclvc6v,1577766811.0,Not quite his take. That scene was written by Roger Avery. Source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/uk.movies.yahoo.com/amphtml/top-gun-is-it-really-gay-134449518.html
creepy,fcl271h,t1_fckxl1b,1577738197.0,"Ya, didn’t even notice until you pointed that out. Odd that they did it that way, eh?"
aww,fcl1qv4,t3_ehni6t,1577737921.0,"Birds shit every 15 minutes. Not ideal office pets, IMO."
movies,fcirio5,t3_eh9p1n,1577668103.0,Reading through these honesty makes me wonder why everyone wants every aspect of a characters decisions explained with a scene.
movies,fciraot,t1_fcgznme,1577667948.0,I couldn’t disagree more. That scene completely grinds the pacing to a halt. Not every single aspect of a character’s personality needs a scene to explain it.
movies,fcifnjd,t3_eh1tbe,1577661816.0,"For my tastes, the original is the best of the bunch. But, all have something worth watching and most are damn good."

MMA,fc98dc9,t3_eg8wg9,1577548656.0,He looked great in his last putting. Here’s to him having a few more good fights and knowing when to call it quits. Not many fighters do.
MMA,fc980d4,t3_egpkul,1577548496.0,Seeing short docs about up and coming fighters makes there UFC debuts more fun to watch. Looking forward to seeing him. Best of luck to him.
MMA,fc96pwx,t1_fc87sxb,1577547902.0,"Off the main topic but, I hope max starts taking responsibility for his last few losses. He hasn’t see to, this far."
MMA,fc956ww,t3_egqrq0,1577547222.0,He’s insufferable.
MMA,fc4g6zj,t3_efx2w2,1577415724.0,"I’d love to see a rematch. But alas, it appears I will not."
funny,fc3t6zr,t1_fc29x1v,1577398005.0,Well said.
MMA,fc3qg58,t3_efwia7,1577396049.0,Tonys around a 2:1 dog. Seems like the odds makers agree that he’s going to have a hard time beating khabib.
MMA,fc3qb7b,t3_efu9c8,1577395955.0,Leon is so unassuming but seemingly very hard to defeat. Not a huge fan of T Wood but probably would rather see him fight again for the strap then Woodley. Leon’s just such a point fighter. It’s not fun to watch.
MMA,fc3q16g,t3_efw9t5,1577395766.0,When’s Bryan’s next scrap. Dudes so game.
MMA,fc3psu1,t3_efx52n,1577395603.0,This is the most obnoxiously edited video I’ve seen in a while.

movies,fc3pdk9,t3_efu6eh,1577395297.0,I’m a big QT fan and was quite disappointed by this movie. It just dragged on a lot and the violent end as this point seems so typical for QT. Maybe a I’d benefit from a rewatch.
movies,fc3o333,t3_efv1xj,1577394364.0,"I watched it recently. I found it quite boring. Maybe I’m not smart enough to get the metaphors or themes. It looked good (you need to watch it with the lights off or won’t be able to see anything) and the dialect was interesting (watch it with subtitles). But in all, It really didn’t draw me in."
movies,fc3nrk7,t3_efujh0,1577394132.0,I’ve never seen a Bay film that I care for. Maybe I need to give this one a rewatch. I haven’t seen it since it was in the theatre.
movies,fbynxy2,t3_ef59xi,1577221757.0,Is it dubbed or subtitles?
