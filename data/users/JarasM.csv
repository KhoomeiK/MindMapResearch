AskScienceFiction,ffbz8tj,t1_ffbvcp6,1579787406.0,"That was a movie line, but the Ring intended to part with Gollum - it slipped off his person on purpose, to depart the Misty Mountains caves and make way to Mordor. What the Ring *did not* intend, was that the creature that found it was a Hobbit, and not a goblin or man. Not that it would ""realize"" the mistake (the Ring's sentience was *very* limited, if actually any), since I really doubt Sauron, and by extension the Ring, knew much about Hobbits.

Basically, the Ring wanted to get away from Gollum by any means necessary, but destiny had it that it was picked up by the most likely creature to resist its corruptive power, while probably the least likely to ever be encountered where they were. If anything or anyone else picked it up, the Ring would return to Sauron swiftly."
AskScienceFiction,ffbs96z,t3_espsht,1579780793.0,">Plus since the ring is said to adapt to the size of the finger, I don't  think it'd be a problem no matter what state the penis is in, it'd  always fit. 

The Ring adapts its size not exactly to fit the size of the owner's finger - it adapts its size to further its goal of coming back to Sauron. So it would fit as long as your possession of it would be useful for that goal... but once it somehow needed to abandon you, it... wouldn't fit any more. I really would suggest avoiding putting it on in this fashion.

Plus, Sauron and the Nazgul can sense and see you plain as day from miles away when you're wearing the Ring. Do you want to be visible to the Dark Lord while wearing a large part of his spirit on your cock? His gaze does pierce flesh, you know."
