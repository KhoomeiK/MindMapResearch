~~OP how many serious relationships have you been in?~~

I'm not into rushing women as I tend to take my time getting to know women before dating but that's because I usually date people I meet under different circumstances where I'm going to be around them a few times to move things slowly.

IMO they probably should have kissed or something. I'm not one to expect things from a girl but were I to go on a date from online dating I would probably try to secure that kiss lol at least by date two.

edit: reread the post and saw I missed that part. Explains a lot.

Just a few quotes from you:

""You can't pretend to be a 6'+ handsome white guy in a nightclub to see what that's like.""

""9/10 looks require a great facial structure, height, and being white.""

""A man's race is probably the most important thing he has to a woman. They are obsessed with race as you have experienced and are far more racist than men.""

""Most women expect men to look like supermodels. Unfortunately we can't.""

""What are your racial, height, facial, age, and build requirements to swipe right on a man?""

""How on earth are you doing that? What's your height? Race? How's your face?""

""How can I get a fuckbuddy if I'm short, a man, and not white?""

""Average white guys are on godmode. That's when your personality starts to matter.""

""What's your height? Race? Looks?""

""A man's value is the sum of his looks. That's it. Women don't care about anything else.""

""Are you a woman or tall/good looking man?""

""Send him to a plastic surgeon. Then maybe once they're done you can love him.""

""Men lead, women follow. Those are the traditional gender roles.""

I would say your best bet is to focus on your self for a bit, instead of what you think the other side wants. Perhaps therapy?

The sad fact is that those are the only subs you use. How full of negativity are you?

Perhaps you suffer from a Napoleon Complex. Not sure but there is some definite projecting going on.

I'm most certainly not an incel, check my history, I got some weird shit. But I'm not a hateful projecting thing like you.

Hope for the best for you. Maybe you will find some calling besides hating on others you consider inferior.
