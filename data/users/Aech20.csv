todayilearned,fejmkzl,t1_fejmka4,1579179956.0,Ok that’s my favourite theory
todayilearned,fejhww5,t1_fejhv7d,1579175013.0,Only reason I can guess that would justify it is that they didn’t know how to do it
AskReddit,fejhs3e,t3_ep9ur1,1579174842.0,"Was on fifty fifty subreddit, watched a video of a woman getting decapitated with a machete. They just cut around and around till it came off."

AskReddit,fdmqzre,t3_em2vfz,1578561475.0,Dad and grandparents on my mums side made me finish all the food I had on my plate. I think it’s because they grew up during that period of time where food was scarce but it didn’t do wonders for my eating habits down the line.
dndnext,fdl8r86,t1_fdjw82w,1578518970.0,My DM made use of some bodaks + a banshee and it was nearly a TPK. For some reason the cleric with good CON couldn’t succeed a CON save ever and everyone but the barbarian didn’t have great CON either.

AskReddit,fdgdv0m,t3_el2az5,1578392098.0,It was Community so do I get to pick or orgy?
AskReddit,fcvqsb8,t3_eixc75,1578007997.0,Been ghosted by the rare person who matches with me  on tinder. One person I actually was talking to regularly ish but she kept coming up with excuses as to why I we couldn’t meet up despite living walking distance away from me (we both lived at seperate but still close dorms at university). Oh yeah and my “friends” tricked me by making a fake account and talking to me through it.

dndnext,fch628b,t3_eh88mc,1577647634.0,"My group has taken 2 years to get to level 13 (we spent a lot of time at level 4-6, like a long long time) and I will say that if your DM isn’t used to playing games at that level it can be overpowered."
patientgamers,fc2j9vd,t1_fc2h8ti,1577363148.0,I think everyone agrees that the best thing about DA:2 was Varric
patientgamers,fc2j1id,t1_fc21j23,1577362813.0,I can’t imagine how difficult that must have been. A lot of clutch moments in my play through of that were because of lucky deflections
patientgamers,fc2izn1,t1_fc20ilh,1577362737.0,"I forgot how to shout for a good first part of the game because it only showed the key binding once and I forgot, thankfully I pressed it by accident and proceeded to abuse it for the rest of the game"
patientgamers,fc2im6h,t3_efn24m,1577362199.0,"Not sure if this applies but healing magic in Dragon Age Origins. Killed the companion who had it by default first play though, and just auto levelled Morrigan because I was lazy. Never finished first play through because I would run out of healing potions at the final siege and keep dying. Second playthrough didn’t kill the companion and gave morrigan some healing magic too, it was a game changer. Bosses and areas I struggled so hard with the first time were able to be accomplished reasonably well. Finished the game too."
