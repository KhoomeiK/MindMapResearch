interestingasfuck,fc9kgnm,t3_egdrhq,1577553993.0,"The easiest way to understand this is to realize this - The further apart the string and the vertical match are separated on the table match, the stronger the hook you're making will be."
interestingasfuck,fc9h895,t3_egdrhq,1577552641.0,"The match on the table is stuck in a crack. 

Even if you changed the center of gravity of the hanging weight, you're still pulling from a spot off of the tables edge.  

Without the match on the table being secured, the weight would pull the match off the table.

Edit: Now I see how the vertical match is pushing on the table match at a rigid angle and not letting that match lift up. It's pushing the free end of the match up which pushed the table end of the match down.

Edit 2: The string is the fulcrum point. A diagram would have to show the vertical match pushing up PAST THE STRING. That's what pushed the match down on the table. 

The center of gravity of the weight is just an indication of whether the pressure on the head of the table match is strong enough to keep the match flat on the table."

Say you're on the outside of a rotating body that is rotating faster than it's gravity (a space ship). And you're being held on the surface by a string. Say the string let's out at a constant speed. Will the string stay perpetually to the surface? 

Or say you are feeling gravity on a rotating planet.....actually this one seems more apparent.....the force you feel is down and toward the rotation, right? I mean if you were on the surface  and felt gravity, and the surface gave way underneath you. You wouldn't fall straight toward the exact center of gtavity, right?
