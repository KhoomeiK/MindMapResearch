HDD keep increasing in common sizes: 8 and 10TB drives are now ""common"" ; thus common sense says 1GB NIC for a NAS is going to be an issue.

Many of their Packages are rubbish : I really wanted to like Synology Notes, Calendar package, and countless others - but they do not work well, they are buggy; and cannot be 100% Trusted; and are seldom updated.

It's a very good NAS, Hyperbackup works very well - but so much of what they Market to consumers is either rubbish or very difficult to implement. I fully agree with OP that 10GB needs to be on all devices. They put a SATA port on all Synos for years, and how many people actually used an external powered SATA HDD?

I strongly suspect Marketing is driving the decision to NOT include 10GB ports for Synology wants customers buying a $200 10GB NIC Card; which is just a re-badged Mellanox I believe. They are $50 on eBay."
synology,fea0lce,t1_fe6mau2,1578943116.0,"> Let's put my important NAS data on an alpha OS, what could go wrong?

Simple: have a decent Syno box and install the Alpha OS on a Virtual DSM

Also, when Alpha comes out, I'm sure someone will have a nice YouTube video on it."
synology,fea05z6,t1_fe6n7j3,1578943044.0,"Of course, I would never put a Alpha or Beta OS on any production machine. I was pondering using Virtual DSM on a RackStation with a decent CPU and RAM."

Given your spelling of the months, I am curious. What is your native language?"
synology,fe9yaly,t1_fe9a3wo,1578942552.0,"While I am not doing this task you wrote out,
just wanted to compliment your ability to give excellent instructions"
synology,fe9v2cz,t1_fe6kyjo,1578941732.0,"any package such as Syno Moments will modify the metadata in some format; so will other photo management apps.

So will music apps like iTunes modify .mp3 files metadata (often ruining your own carefully curated files).

So my simple solution is to keep MasterPhotoFolder and MasterMusicFolder and then copy photos to /photo and copy .mp3 files to /music

In this fashion, I do waste HDD space (I don't care) but I know my original files still exist if/when some package/program screws up the copy files."
synology,fe62aq7,t1_fe1ff00,1578880187.0,"> I appreciate your response and there should be plenty of airflow. The room is about 10'x4' + an area under the staircase going up. 

Under the stairs ? Depending on the nature of the framing construction; might a human walking up/down the stairs have any impact on the studs you will be securing the vertical server rack to ? I'm thinking about that vibration impacting the RackStation HDD causing serious issues.

I don't know how easily you will be able to change out the RackStation fans; and you certainly wont be able to change the fans inside the PSU.

RackStations are loud."
synology,fe61s63,t3_enq3hy,1578879857.0,"Fully agree with OP : it is insane ABB does not work with an Encrypted Shared Folder

I do not if technically possible, but I also find it annoying the entire ABB folder must be selected for Hyperbackup (vs being able to select which ABB Tasks I wish to Hyperbackup)"
synology,fe5z9yf,t1_fe5d5kn,1578878262.0,"why wait for 6? months

No one knows what DSM 7 Syno Photos even looks like."
synology,fe5z6cz,t3_enr40e,1578878199.0,"OP : I would never trust anyone to screw around with the original meta data of all my photos.

What I do is this : on the NAS, I make up my own Shared Folder (MasterPixFolder) for my pix; and then *COPY* them to /photos on the NAS

So yes, there's two copies of every pix; but if/when the metadata gets all screwed up in /photo , I still have the originals in MasterPixFolder.

What Syno do you have? Moments will take a long, long time to crawl thru 40k of pix due to the AI facial/scene recognizing.

I would perhaps add 5000 at a time and wait till that batch is done."
homelab,fe3guiy,t1_fe33lpq,1578849114.0,Thanks for your continued help; I've been away from home and will try to swap the PSU when I get home later tonight
homelab,fe323su,t1_fe2zuxu,1578845211.0,"PSU Question if I may ask:

PSU1 (on the left) only has the TOP light green, the other is simply off, its not blinking amber)

I failed at trying to google that situation, you have any experience/thoughts on that?

PSU2 on the Right both lights are green.

OpenManage Power shows green/healthy for both PSU"
homelab,fe31qj2,t1_fe2zuxu,1578845104.0,"first, i greatly appreciate you asking 

but i'm away from home until this evening

When I get back home, my plan of attack is to power it all down , pull the 2 Power Cords, swap PSU1 and PSU2; plug back in, run diagnostics and see if the PSU error goes away.

The error on PCI slot 3 : PCI Slot 3 holds the PCI H310 card (which is flashed to IT Mode for FreeNAS passthru) : plan there is to put into another PCI slot and see if the new slot gets an error."
synology,fe2y73p,t1_fe2tcnn,1578844156.0,"you still did not say how many current TB of data exists to store; and how many TB do you expect to add next year.

Are you a video business with only 10,000 files but they are large in size

or a typical office with a million small files.

Do you only want a NAS to backup the 3 computers; or will you be storing data on the NAS itself 

The point of a NAS is centralized storage; office workers in-house save the data not to their PC but to the NAS.

also I personally would never combine personal use and business use on the same NAS.

You also have not indicated what type of business, small office who does most work on paper and you are only looking to backup a few thousand Microsoft Office files; or a business who stores all files in digital format (so your business fails without them).

Point is : your question remains vastly too vague for anyone here to give you a qualified answer.

imo, Best small-business Desktop NAS is a DS1618+ , BtrFS, RAID6, fill it with ECC RAM, no SSD Cache, a good business-class APC UPS

But given your lack of details, I have no clue if that is overkill for your needs."
synology,fe2qli1,t1_fe2dw9a,1578841793.0,"as /u/ssps wrote, the synology DSM firewall is very basic; and can be challanging to get very granular results.

Would your goal work by creating encrytped shared folders and using account names and passwords for each user you want to access the synology.

you can easily allow user David to have access to /music and /davidfiles but no one elses. 

Then user Nancy only has read access to /video

you can even require 2FA for more security if you wish.

Otherwise, you need to set static IP addresses for every device at the router; and then can use the synology firewall and input these static IP addresses and control access via that method. But from what you are saying, I'd use the DSM usernames to control access."
