Genocide isn't just the deliberate killing large groups of people - but with intent to destroy a group of people. If you kill off an entire group of people in say a war as an enemy deliberately because they're an enemy, that's not genocide, it's a casualty of war. If in the war you see the opportunity to exterminate a group of people and do so - that's genocide."

It's not really the consumption of meat that is ""wrong"", it's how one obtains said meat to consume that is generally wrong. No one but religious nutters care about putting meat in your mouth and the chemical reaction of meat digestion in your body. Well also unsustainable land use and farming contribute to the ethics of lands use and waste - especially things like tearing down the rain forest for beef production is particular unethical - including of course shooting natives living there to do it and the corruption in the supply chain. Also cows are bad the environment vs non-ruminant animals that produce less methane.

The concept of lab meat for example - is ""potentially"" ethical. There's unethical ways of getting certain stem cells for meat generation as well that require slaughter but there's ways that don't for other types from what I recall. If you can make meat ethically - there's no problem - outside of the question of the long term sustainability of the practice once it gets off the ground.

Whether it makes for good dietary choices aside."

No, but philosophical and unethical nature of eating meat should. As well as the fact that it's a far more sustainable way of living for everyone and should be generally cheaper for you as well.

 At least for the most part. 

Part of sustainability can also be population controls and if you're hunting for population control - it can be understandable to then consume the meat - not sure if it's potentially better to let the wild have it however. However can is not the same as using the argument that hunting should be done to maintain populations - [which is generally not the case.](https://freefromharm.org/common-justifications-for-eating-animals/hunting-wildlife-population-control-ethical-eating/) Actual population control should be determined as an actual necessity at the time barring specific historic non-anthropogenic cyclic increases that are validated rather than using population control as argument to pre-empt population growth for that to be an actual viable stance.

It's fine to teach your kids where meat comes from - it's disingenuous to lie to them about the rationale behind it and lack of necessity.

That being said - difficulty in transitioning can still be a thing. Still not saying oh people are responsible for this - society as a whole is as much as any individual. But we should look to improve our way of living and vegetarianism is definitely a better way to do it."

Which we're doing. It's just the most of the land-world is our environment and we're one of the few species to inhabit it so thoroughly in that way with as large of an impact. Technology allows us to extract and use more resources and understanding gives us the desire. Likewise - curiosity and consciousness is also a thing in other animals. They're just not as adept or capable for multiple factors - which factors into them being less capable of the same level of damage. Over time any species that evolves the traits we do for intellect and communication by definition has to have the exact same problems we have.

I meant - musically. None of that comes through in the music, that's not in the music. Which is what I'm referencing. That's stage theatre art - and I suppose that's a valid commentary on ""shock"" for theatre as it were. Which if that's how you're meaning he's a diet rozz - in shock appeal. I suppose - but your statement implied musically, not theatrically.

Laidback meaning of course also meaning ironically, that going through Rozz's music isn't aggressive or in your face - even if his antics are.

> Rozz Williams and Christian Death were before anything, a Punk band, emerging out of the California Punk 

Which is great but that doesn't come across in Christian Death's music as stylistically punk'ish. Even if they're culturally punk. If I wear punk clothing, hang out with punk bands, even play with them - but in my own band I play bluegrass music. That doesn't make my bluegrass punk music in any way directly - even if I am myself am punk and am involved in the punk scene. It doesn't even make the music punk-adjacent bluegrass unless I incorporate some stylistic elements. Which is why I suggested that potentially a term for Manson in that I caught more of that influence of sound - not culture. Just the way it sounds. Not to imply that he even had anything remotely to do with punk itself as a culture - which is why I put it in quotes in the first place and added commentary that it might not be quite the appropriate word for having a bit of those elements.

> ironically like you're able to like Manson without hearing the Bowie in his work.

There's influence there that I do hear but he doesn't ""sound"" like him in the same way that the work I listened to with Rozz. 

Either way it seems like you're arguing that comment from a cultural perspective rather than strictly musical. Just as you linked Manson saying he liked Bowie as ""in his work""... except... him liking Bowie is not the same thing as him producing music that sounds like Bowie. 

> The point of bring Rozz Williams into the picture was to negate that depiction and point to the larger continuum of musical evolution that exists.

I'd agree with the the concept of musical evolution there - that's why I wouldn't consider Manson diet ""musically"", because like my post mentioned - they seem to diverge and go in different directions entirely and not one in which Manson is somehow less. I'd consider something ""diet"" if it was trying to be the same thing but just not quite as good or ""watered down"" in some aspect. And musically and only musically for that consideration I wouldn't say that. But if you're talking theatrics and shows, which I honestly don't actually care about since that's not my experience  with them and not something I'm looking at - I can see where if Manson was trying to accomplish similar counter cultural shock to a similar audience but less extreme than rozz sure - in that arena then sure I suppose he would be a ""diet rozz"" in that aspect, which I'm taking your word for on the theatrics. 

I'm not Goth or into Goth. But given your comment and going into check Rozz, that statement did not apply to the music - for listening. Since I went in expecting to hear Manson be somehow a sound not as good as rozz in some manner and that's not what I heard. I heard two different sounds (yes with some influential similarities in some aspects) but overall being two different things that weren't even attempting the same thing with neither being directly better or worse just, different. But also most of the stuff I listened to with Rozz over various albums was more relaxing to listening and fairly consistent if anything. Different moods entirely.

So I dunno - I think your semantics are busted there in your original comment - that lacks clarity in communicating the cultural aspect barring people who might know ""what you mean by that"" rather than what it reads as directly."

 It's different, it's influenced by multiple different groups. Not just re-purposing or changing it's accessibility trying to be a ""diet"" version of older goth music. Influence is fine - diet is a different commentary than ""some shared aesthetic"" it implies it's trying to be the same thing but in a lighter/weaker form.

Which sort of goes to show actually how little some of these games actually cost to develop given gigantic publisher backing still especially given how much they rake in. If you make a game for 1 million and you sell 1 million copies for 30 bucks - you're looking at 30 million bucks minus overhead, if you put even 1 million into marketing and distribution, that's still 27 million made. or 900% profit. You could cut  into that way more which is why some games have stupid amounts in marketing vs actual development cost - which is why CoD2 MW2 spent 238 million 2020 dollars in marketing vs 60 million in development. Which sold 22.7 million copies... if you assume that it sold for 60 bucks (might have had a lot of sales purchases), then that would be 1,362 million dollars minus the 298 million for development and marketing - 1064 million dollars. Infinity ward currently has 537 employees - which is more than they used too but let's pretend they all worked on CoD2MW2 - if you split that money between all of them that one single game would give every employee 1.8 million dollars and they could probably stretch that out and almost never have to work another day in their lives.

I'm not really hearing it.

They seem like they go in fairly different directions there and not in any way I'd consider ""diet"". Manson's stuff was highly aggressive and in your face. It was more akin to something like Industrial Shock Goth Metal. Where Shadow Project and Christian Death seem to be more like laidback Glam Goth Rock. Rozz seems like he's more classic goth stuff. Whereas Manson is more Goth ""Punk"" if that's an adequate label. Maybe there's something more fitting - I never really rolled into Goth genres so much.

No it definitely is not. But amount of episodes that are particularly bad is pretty fairly low with most episodes being decent enough. So, there's little point in rummaging about to skip like 5 episodes of a 182 that are particularly bad and they're relatively spread out. Most of the weaker episodes aren't so bad they need to be skipped. 

Also Pulaski sucked. Even though Crusher manages to have two of the worst episodes in the series herself - she's still a better replacement any day of the week on average. Pulaski is a buzzkill technophobe that had no place on an exploration vessel. Being a technophobe isn't being critical minded. It's being aversive for aversions sake. She's right to be a transporter-phobe though - fuck getting gooped into atoms with the same technology that can't reproduce dinner.

The last two are bad, but they're also technically lore of the show, so... eh. The other two are garbage.

Darmok is also crap but people love it - it's not terrible to watch though unlike the others, it's just a vastly stupid premise. It's basically a kickback to the Kirk monster wrestling with a TNG spin. It's a really loved but really weak episode and skipping it is missing out on the memes and discussions about it. So even though it's almost not worth watching - it manages to trip itself into being one of the ones you unfortunately have to watch but not one that is altogether unwatchable. One of the better of the bottom of the barrel episodes.

Similarly ""Goo gets Yar!"" is both a really bad episode and one you have to watch because of Yar's relevancy. 


Though I'd agree - there's little point in really skipping any of them. Watch one a day and you'll finish in half a year. If you marathon 12x2 hours on a weekend you can take out 128 episodes in a month, leaving 54 episodes. With 2 episodes each weekday and at least four 3 episode days tucked in, you can finish the entire run of TNG in a 5 weeks.

They did give a reason for that. The setup was that he ""lost faith in starfleet"" and he says ""they were no longer starfleet"". If he considers them not to be Starfleet - then from his perspective it's no longer the organization he said that about. He pointed out that they stood down on the rescue and he that he wasn't prepared to do nothing - IE being ordered to stand down when he needed to rescue people and ""be a spectator."" He used to view Starfleet as the thing that saves lives, and here that's not the case. The bigger issue is how Picard was possibly as naive as he was in TNG about Starfleet given every time starfleet shows up it's usually a shit show - which frankly were the weaker parts of TNG. We're expected to believe everything is super dupes from the accounts on the Enterprise about Earth - but somehow Starfleet is almost always morally bankrupt, bumbling, or alien space worms and then everyone went home and just forgot that Starfleet was invaded."

That'd also be plausible. Also, there's nothing wrong with them using chemistry to examine fundamental properties of stuff without actually ""building"" stuff. Maybe someone or she's more learned up on robotics but not chemistry and she's working on that side as well. Maybe she works in multiple fields and why not make use of what you have? Why wouldn't they use simulations... Probably for empirical reasons or something related to why they can't replicate matter properly like food in a replicator - still would never touch a teleporter in that case.

Just like a human neuron doesn't just make whole brains nor programs them, if you have them and put them in a jar and boom brain. You can't replicate the programming of a neural network of positronic neurons by simply having one even if it did somehow regenerate, which to my knowledge not how they work. All a positronic neuron would do is give you a fundamental unit of a positronic brain for you to reconstruct which then needs to re-learn/program the whole of it's functional neural network because they don't hold the state of other neurons - that's literally the purpose of other neurons to each hold their own neural state in the network. One part of a persons brain matter if perfect state condition if you could retrieve it - doesn't let you rebuild their entire personality. Da fuck, you work here lady? Shit, I think I know why they actually shut this place down.""

The writing of that whole scene was just bad and misunderstands philosophical and scientific concepts and replaces them with thriller drama ignorance tropes rather than trying to write good dialogue that makes all of this work cohesively. Also apparently there are still poverty areas in the Federation, which... [you know in TNG was sort of the point them saying we were beyond that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp3OhC3NoMk)... but no... let's have poverty area with sirens, graffiti and shit because - SUSPENSE - CRIME PLACE!

And of course you know you've got all those flying cars - there'd never be a reason to have flying shuttles that literally just fly above everything or anything - no - they need to warn other cars that are in the way and get stuck in traffic I guess? But they can fly. Good fucking job emergency services, you suck. Also doesn't help that the existence of police force implies crime is not only a considerable thing - which is generally caused by lack of material conditions for people but also that there's a class based system that's making that a necessity in the first place.

Then you have super aggressive reporter trying to put spin on shit? When the whole thing should have been scoured by scores of academics in society and all over the place constantly discussing the philosophical ramifications etc... and it's not like he was court marshaled, so what the fuck is this even on? 

The whole thing feels like it's going to be an action mystery thriller Star Trek PiKirk - and of course that makes sense given the writers come from backgrounds in that shit and generally bad ones at that. Writers what they know. 

Some of the point is to create political commentary - but it throws away the TNG universe to do so. That was the fucking point of TNG's universe was to have a future worth striving for that's beyond crap because it succeeded. But to make political commentary you have to examine societies that more resemble our own. In this case, by making the federation resemble our own to make such commentary what it tells us about the universe is TNG is basically all bullshit and never happened that way and society is still completely fucked up. Q would have ravaged Picard just by putting him on Earth during his trials in that case. If they're trying to save a buck, I dunno. Unless all of this is some long term inception dream within a dream shit, they're either cutting corners or have no idea what TNG was intended. TNG took generic scifi social political commentary and wrapped them in a unified package meant to be an inspirational vision of a utopian world. This world - is the opposite of what TNG was ""trying"" and admittedly TNG made some mis-steps too in that vision - especially with federation leadership.

They are never not the bad guys because there is no perspective which changes the fundamental reality of what they were and what they were doing. There is only truth and fascist revisionism.

I don't actually expect HR hiring to understand that, especially if they actually ask it. So while I'm ironically suggesting there's a plausible reason to suggest it - the probability of it being plausible drops considerably if it's actually asked if it's not a large part of the employment itself - it's okay if you're maybe hiring spies or some shit."

I propose what he does is work out an input domain consisting of proportions of expected_traffic_area to turtle_avoidance (mobility of transport and acceptable tolerances for accidental pressure or bumpage). Then take ten thousand jobs with a random number of equal distribution of turtles produced via a [Mersienne twister PRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) (WELL generator is also acceptable) for a [Monte Carlo solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) seeing what gets fired and what doesn't. That way he can approximate the of turtles with respect to traffic at any particular type of job so long as he know the bounds of traffic.  

There may be some hidden variables like transport speed vs turtle cuteness appreciation - jobs around motorists would for example likely not have time to appreciate the turtle cuteness whereas pedestrian zones will have an amplified cute appreciation effects. But overall it should give him a decent approximation that should be applicable to other jobs.

He can probably use a regression analysis over x-domain with the data set produced for estimated variations and use a bisectional root solve if he needs more accuracy."

That doesn't mean you can stop thinking or that you can ""perform"" as if you don't act non-deterministically.
