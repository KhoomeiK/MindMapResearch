offmychest,femzotf,t1_femyfrc,1579273680.0,Idk how specialised your field is or what your degree is in but 14 jobs in two months seems like not nearly enough. I applied to about 15/day and got back many responses the week of. It’s a numbers game. How are you going about your search? Are you using all the tools at your disposal?

AskReddit,fejw5jk,t3_epia9x,1579187231.0,"Huh, most of the replies are all emotional feelings but I hate the feeling of dry cardboard on my dry hands. Idk what it is but it feels like nails on a chalkboard. Fuck, just typing this is making me cringe. And when I have to fold cardboard boxes or flatten them for recycling, eugh!! Idk what it is but I’d fully hire someone to take care of my cardboard stuff in another room where I can’t even hear it because even the noise is disturbing."

Back when I was single, guys would always be surprised that I insisted on splitting the bill every time. That confused me because like, you know, this is the 21st century and all... Women who claim to be feminists but insist the guy pay for everything, or even just dinner the first date and not feminists. I agree that it’s cool for the person who does the asking out to pay the bill but even then, I feel uncomfortable letting people pay for me. I always felt like it was a dent to my self-respect, having people pay for me. After being together for over a year with my bf, only now am I truly comfortable with him paying for something for me without immediately wanting to venmo him my part."

It can hurt to feel like you’re not enough, and to feel like the love you have invested in someone isn’t reciprocated. Having said that, however, no one is worth sacrificing your self respect and dignity over. Distance is good if you’re figuring things out. I’d just ask that you love and appreciate yourself more and analyse this situation from a different perspective. You are enough just the way you are, and if someone doesn’t recognise that, well, it’s not your job to fix that. Know your self worth, and understand that no one is going to be with you more than you so the person who needs to love you more than anyone else in the world has to be you. Take care of yourself."

unpopularopinion,fcwwg0u,t1_fcw05wz,1578040508.0,"Well then they can be grown up about it, talk to their partner about being unsatisfied, and if things don’t work out, go their separate ways, and fuck whoever is willing to have sex with their immature ass. Cheating on someone is cowardly and an insult to the person who is cheated on."

I told him I wasn’t interested in seeing him in that case because I couldn’t do that to another woman and he was an asshole (especially because this wasn’t an open relationship or anything, she didn’t know about any of this). He had the audacity to be confused at my response, saying he’d spend so much money on me and wouldn’t I find it super hot to fuck on his wife’s bed? I just thanked my lucky stars I was too busy to meet him earlier in the week like he suggested and so I didn’t have to wear jeans for this moron."

It was like I could see the cartoonish green gas enter my nose. I was genuinely concerned for him but he was okay. Never letting him live this one down for sure!"

You are enough just the way you are, and if someone doesnâ€™t recognise that, well, itâ€™s not your job to fix that. Know your self worth, and understand that no one is going to be with you more than you so the person who needs to love you more than anyone else in the world has to be you. Take care of yourself."

Heard things like â€œIâ€™m just flirting with youâ€ or â€œwhat the f-hellâ€ instead of â€œIâ€™m just fucking with youâ€ and â€œwhat the fuckâ€ and thought, huh, I guess this is cable tv so they gotta censor all the â€œbadâ€ stuff.

Cheating on someone is cowardly and an insult to the person who is cheated on."

I told him I wasnâ€™t interested in seeing him in that case because I couldnâ€™t do that to another woman and he was an asshole (especially because this wasnâ€™t an open relationship or anything, she didnâ€™t know about any of this). He had the audacity to be confused at my response, saying heâ€™d spend so much money on me and wouldnâ€™t I find it super hot to fuck on his wifeâ€™s bed? I just thanked my lucky stars I was too busy to meet him earlier in the week like he suggested and so I didnâ€™t have to wear jeans for this moron."

Iâ€™m not at all shy or quiet and anyone who knows me would find it hilarious for me to be described as such. No one (other than my bf, parents, and close friends) would ever call me introverted because of my personality. But thatâ€™s not what being introverted is. Oh well"
