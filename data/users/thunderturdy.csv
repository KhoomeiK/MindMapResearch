DobermanPinscher,ff9fb3a,t3_esal7u,1579711787.0,"As a snake owner and lover this makes me sad...but then also as a Dobie owner it's pretty cool that the dog ""protected"". My dog thinks snakes and rats are toys and bats at them like a cat. Totally useless."
BravoRealHousewives,ff8vw9m,t1_ff8v02e,1579697853.0,How dare you?!
BravoRealHousewives,ff66pep,t3_erqz82,1579620439.0,What actually happened to the dog? Does she still have him? I feel like after kyles daughter got bit they just never brought him up again.
BravoRealHousewives,ff50083,t1_ff1b6bn,1579576589.0,"Not really. Grew up in Orange County and my mom is an insurance broker who actually works with the largest insurance provider in the area (USI). She's met Vicki at conferences and seminars and stuff. Said she seems normal/professional in person. And yes, my mom has watched the show she just thinks Vicki is trashy so never got excited to see her in person at these events lmao."
AskReddit,fet25op,t1_feppzfz,1579371124.0,"I feel like she’s been over doing music for a while now. Luckily for her, the other projects she’s involved in are so lucrative she only needs to make music and perform if she feels like it."
AskReddit,fesx7jc,t1_fephha6,1579369842.0,"Can confirm as the bassist is actually family. The lead singer Serj sorta outgrew the other guys. We still regularly see John and Daron at family gatherings but Serj isn’t around anymore and I have a big feeling that has something to do with it. 

I will say tho, when he is around, Serj is still a wonderful person, just not as close as they used to be you know?"
BravoRealHousewives,fesagai,t1_fepnx5w,1579363226.0,Um have you seen the comments on her insta or Twitter? Her thousands of brainless followers don’t seem to care an iota about the horrible shit she’s said/done.
BravoRealHousewives,fepasdj,t1_feotc09,1579316003.0,">racism makes people feel like that daily.

BINGO. Oh poor you Brandi, you were bullied for something incredibly stupid and insensitive YOU DID YOURSELF. Now imagine somebody being bullied for real, for something they have no control over! Maybe if she'd tied the two together and actually showed she learned something from this whole mess I'd have a modicum of respect for her. Looking at the instagram post and all her brainless sycophants telling her it's ok makes me sick. There are kids (hi, one of them myself here) who were bullied for their fucking ethnicity growing up, and having an adult asshole like Brandi being lauded and backed up for doing it herself is insane to me. FUCK BRANDI REDMOND. I don't want to see her stupid ass face on any of my screens again."
BravoRealHousewives,fep9e51,t1_feocogi,1579315084.0,I mean with all the fillers she's had she's not too far off.
BravoRealHousewives,feoe163,t1_feo9eu7,1579298822.0,I 100% meant to write that. It's an inside joke between my husband and I and I slip it in wherever possible :P
AmItheAsshole,fenq3bu,t1_fen3v85,1579289205.0,"My husband HATES all of my little keepsakes and souvenirs from trips (he's a minimalist), but he knows having them displayed around makes me happy. Instead of making me put them away he put up a nice shelf where I can display them all however I want, that way they're not strewn about everywhere but I can still display them. Win win. OP's girlfriend sounds like the AH."
BravoRealHousewives,fenml77,t1_fenkxc0,1579287910.0,"Yes. The amount of times shit is glossed over on American Bravo shows is ludacris and makes me wonder at times why I still watch and participate. I've officially had it with VPR and no longer watch, but will that cancel the show? Probably not."
BravoRealHousewives,fenk7e8,t1_femyiy2,1579286460.0,If Lisa was an ally the show wouldn't have an all cis het caucasian cast. There is not one LGBTQ/POC on that cast and when there were their treatment was so bad they left or were fired. This show needs to end already. They're out of excuses.
BravoRealHousewives,fenk0ma,t1_fen0hvw,1579286345.0,"IDK my parents were racist bigots but I also grew up attending American schools and this shit was never tolerated in elementary, middle or hs. There were obviously assholes who thought they were being funny or edgy saying this kind of crap but nobody tolerated them and they were called out bigtime for it. Also, I'm older than Max. He very much knew better, he just thought that because he was being ""funny dude"" it was ok. 

My parents slowly learned but it wasn't media that pushed them, it was my brother and I bringing over friends of races they were uncomfortable with. Maybe some kids will blindly follow the dumb shit their parents say, but a lot do know better and can think for themselves."
BravoRealHousewives,fek6j02,t1_fek45ux,1579193642.0,"SERIOUSLY. I get the n-- one is bad, but I also knew a lot of stupid teenagers in our waspy highschool town using it because they listened to rap and thought it was cool (and OBV NOT OK but kids were dumb even back in 2010). BUT saying you want to inflict pain/violence on an entire race of people is shockingly disgusting. HOW on earth are people glossing over that?!"
AmItheAsshole,fei3yh1,t1_fegzl95,1579129755.0,Is there any way she could go to her parents appointment then be picked up by you on your way home? It's still a big favor but then at least you can have your meeting in peace and still help them out afterwards?
BravoRealHousewives,fegmkn8,t1_fegj3lu,1579097307.0,"He seemed like a frustrated guy who had zero check on his anger and  emotions. I'm sure he's not completely bad or half their kids wouldn't have left with him, but MAN he didn't do himself a single favor on the show. Dude needed some serious anger management and therapy."
BravoRealHousewives,fef1xrh,t1_fec4qug,1579046260.0,That was the most difficult to watch garbage I've ever witnessed. She was (still is imo) completely unbearable.
videos,fedwg11,t1_fedw5v4,1579021332.0,"I guess in my mind the point was he spoke up when it mattered, where someone else would just collect their check and leave."
videos,fedt2z7,t1_fediywj,1579019301.0,Doesn’t matter. He spoke up and when they wouldn’t budge he was no longer a part of the show. The fact that Mark McGrath came in knowing and seeing the abuse and not caring is despicable.
Futurology,fec7as2,t1_fe8pg24,1578967885.0,"Same. I go a few weeks on a vegan diet, will break for a chicken sandwich or some salmon. Don't eat beef ever because it's high in saturated fats and terrible for the environment and I don't eat pork for personal reasons (they're as smart as dogs and I'd never eat a dog so why eat a piggy?). 

I've found that after a year on this type of diet whenever I'm served beef at bbqs I no longer like the flavor. It tastes like the smell of manure and I'm pretty put off by it. I've also found that after a year some of my favorite foods like ramen, sushi, and fast food all have their equally tasty vegan dupes so I don't really feel like I'm missing out on anything.

The ONE and ONLY thing I miss is a good old fashioned bbq. Ribs, sausage, brisket... I'll treat myself to it once a year but even then I feel like I'm kinda getting over it slowly :/"
videos,fec654h,t1_fec4wls,1578967274.0,"Holy shit that is horrendous. WTF. I own snakes and lizards...dumping reptiles into ice water will kill them from shock. Could you imagine being piled on top of other people in a dark box, then suddenly being dumped into a massive deep ice bath? If you wouldn't do that to a human, why on earth would you think it's ok to do to an animal? What a horrible show! Glad it got cancelled and glad Steve-o quit. Just another reason to dislike mark mcgrath I guess."
