So, in the future, if I am limited in wood and/or don't want to use the fire for warmth, then I'll set it in the platform style; but if I have lots of wood and/or want it for warmth, the teepee style is best.

coolguides,fdfjpey,t1_fde0hs8,1578363301.0,"From my most recent experience camping I noticed that when I set the wood as in the platform style, the fire lasted longer, though he heat from it was not as intense.  Then I changed it to the teepee style and the fire burned through the wood much faster--about four times as fast--but the heat from the fire was more intense.

So, in the future, if I am limited in wood and/or don't want to use the fire for warmth, then I'll set it in the platform style; but if I have lots of wood and/or want it for warmth, the teepee style is best.  I mean, both styles will give you heat, but for the platform you'll have to sit/stand closer to the fire."

I said it like that because they start talking about all the things I could cook and without prompt start spouting recipes expecting me to just memorize them, but then they start arguing with each other about some of the condiments because one prefers a little more of one or just none at all and have suggestions on what to use instead. They go on and on, I think even forget I'm in the room anymore, haha, I just watch and enjoy having my old folks near."

aww,fdclmrj,t3_ekm5q0,1578277966.0,"I  am male, the youngest of six and the only one still single. I moved out 18 years ago and 2000 miles from my parents since then, yet my dad on his most recent visit brought me two of their old pans because the last time they visited they thought the ones I had were too new and not ready for the kind of cooking they envision I should be doing. Two old pans made a 2000 mile trip across the country in my dad's carry-on so that I could cook 'properly'.

So, yeah, parents will do that even when they don't agree on your moving out before getting married because that's what parents do.

EDIT: I forgot a third tiny one, ""*for when you have left overs, you can reheat them in this.*"" I don't have a microwave oven and my kitchen is small."
