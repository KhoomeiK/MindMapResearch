cats,fepmo5y,t1_fepm7sa,1579324574.0,"He gets a quarter cup twice a day, but recently I've been give him a small fraction of that then giving him the quarter cup soon after, so he can gobble when he's hungry, then eat slower, but maybe I need to look into special bowls"
cats,fepmglu,t1_fepm7pz,1579324399.0,"This has been one of my main assumptions, I used to feed him once a day, and when I switched to higher quality food he seemed to slow down but after a while he seemed to gobble it up quickly so I switched to twice a day, but I've recently started giving him a tiny bit to let him gobble it then giving him his normal amount."

legaladvice,fepkrzm,t1_fepk9uu,1579323082.0,"Hmmmm I don't know much about the legal side of marriage, and I do truly love this woman, but it seems to me that if I work for my pension and something terrible happens that we find ourselves needing to be divorced, we don't plan on children and she works, then why would the money I earn towards retirement be something she's entitled to? I guess if I cheated on her, then maybe it's my fuck up, but if she cheated on me how could she gave claim to the fruits of my labor?

Seriously I don't mean to sound callous, we don't exist to get divorced I just work with a lot of angry older guys who talk about pre nups and how bs marriage is, I'm just curious how these things work"
legaladvice,fepjva3,t1_fepjnd8,1579322381.0,"Neither one of us has any real assets, but I have a union job with a pension, and though we don't plan on getting divorced, if it happened I just don't want to end up in a situation where my retirement money goes to her. I'd rather we mutually decided how to split things, which is how she feels too. So do we really need lawyers for that or can we handle it in an easier way?"

PhotoshopRequest,fem0wlg,t1_fem0oh1,1579236185.0,"Well I'm a leftist and I work with a big trump supporter, we get along alright, but I know sending him a picture like that will really make him roll his eyes. In other words it's for the lawlz brah"
gaming,fefijkj,t1_fefgytr,1579057049.0,"Quest 64 is terrible rpg game I played using the GameShark, so no you probably wouldn't have loved it, but I did thanks to cheating.

Mystical ninja was phenomenal and if you have the opportunity I would definitely recommend it."

This looks the same, though the male end on mine is yellow, and this has terrible reviews. I'm wondering if I'd be better off getting composite extension cables"

It's worth mentioning square sells older games on their website, but they come with the greatest hits label which I don't mind so much, but obviously the black label is cooler"
