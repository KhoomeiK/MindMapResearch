Yes, if you have a fixed number of gears, a higher top speed means you need to space your ratios further, which means you might spend a *little* more time out of the sweet spot in the power band, but it's not as significant as I suspect you are envisaging.

It's the same misunderstanding that many people have regarding changing final ratios in bikes (cogs) or cars (diffs), where it is assumed a shorter final ratio will give better acceleration. In reality, you might get more acceleration in first but you will also need to shift earlier, and won't see any ""benefit"" past that point - it's mostly perception.

Remember power to the ground is power from the engine minus losses, changing your final ratios changes your shift points and potentially top speed, but not your overall acceleration."

Firstly, no,  we didn't do hazard reduction burns because it just wasnt safe to do so. Most firies are Greenies - that's why we do it - and we are also not effin stupid.

Secondly, hazard reduction is not some magical silver bullet that prevents bushfires. Most of these fires are  big enough to be in the treetops, and the only way to stop them would be to clear ALL trees. 

Generally, all hazard reduction burns can do is protect some property and change the path of fires.

explainlikeimfive,fcj0f3e,t1_fchrv71,1577674181.0,"And why, when you peel it off, is it totally not sticky anymore? To follow on from /u/meeep08:

So we know that wet things like to cling to other things (technically due to van der Waals forces and surface tension) in effect making them stickier, but the water also acts as a lubricant and a failure point.

 Think of, say, a thick jam sandwich made with toast or strong bread. The jam will stick the two slices together, but as you pull the slices apart, it is also the weak link - the jam stuck to one slice breaks away from the jam stuck to the other. Basically you have bread+jam+jam+bread, where jam+jam is the weakest bond.

As the water dries from our paper, it keeps pulling the fibres tighter and tighter against the surface and into every little nook and cranny. Now instead of the paper stuck to the water stuck to the ceiling, it's the paper stuck directly to the ceiling without the weak water to water bond in the chain. 

These adhesion forces (van der Waals) rely on heaps of the molecules of paper being super *super* close to the molecules of the ceiling in order to work. Dried and stuck, it's surface exactly matches the bit of ceiling it is stuck to, like a weird 3D puzzle piece, but anywhere else (like you hand) it just doesn't fit properly and won't stick."

The reason why dragsters use low pressure with large contact patches is because the rubber compound is incredibly soft (also known as ""gummy""), which means it is very weak - think like an artist's eraser. At the limits of traction, the rubber itself fails under shear and wads up, making little rubber log rollers.

It's a similar story with off-road driving, only swapped around where the ground is the weak material that will fail under shear and the large contact patch will increase traction by increasing the strength of the patch, not increasing friction.

tl;dr: low pressure in drag cars is to protect the soft rubber tires, not to create more friction."

You are right in that paying firefighters on a ""per job"" basis has worked out badly in the past, and for obvious reasons. What really needs to happen is brigades need to be properly funded.

I have always argued that the defence force - at least the Army - should be trained and capable of fighting fires.

Futurology,fc50k15,t1_fc4vroj,1577436895.0," If you have a machine set up to do only one part (or only one material) such that your shavings bin was reasonably pure... In theory, yes. Actual material cost is typically a tiny fraction of the part cost, though, especially in aero, so there isn't much motivation to do so. 

For example, a $1200 aluminium part might be made from $60 of material, with the majority of the cost being equipment/tooling followed by labour and overheads. 

That might seem extreme, but tight tolerances costs money. Cutting heads are expensive and might only last a couple of parts before they are out of tolerance (if they are provided under contract, you might not be able to continue using them on lower tolerance parts, either). 

Production speed is slow, and so you probably need a multi-million dollar CNC machine dedicated to only producing that one part in order to meet delivery (and it needs to be payed off through the parts it produces). You might even need to build more building space to fit the production line. 

Staff have to be trained to check and assemble the parts. There are usually pretty steep penalties if you ship a bad part (imagine what a recall costs for an aircraft) so QA needs to be top notch and you need insurance just in case.

This is why aircraft cost as much as they do."
