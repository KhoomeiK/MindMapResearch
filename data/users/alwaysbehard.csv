Rian Johnson can make good visuals, but if you remember the lightspeed ram, all of those good visuals only work as still images. Not as cinema.

saltierthancrait,ffdcywc,t1_ffc42gq,1579818261.0,"In my opinion JJ just did his thing in TFA. Made a competant, if uninspired piece of entertainment for modern audiences. Kathleen Kennedy probably thought that by handing over sole creative control to the director of the middle chapter of a trilogy, it would take on a life of its own and automatically just be a good movie. That is kinda what the MCU does. They let their writers abd directors call the shots, and it seems to work out. **But** Kevin Feige steps in to make sure the movies are still a cohesive series, and none of them undercut each other. This is why franchises need people who's job is to make sure the movies and people who make them, play nice with each other."

saltierthancrait,ffbah7e,t1_ffaezbo,1579757427.0,"If anything the shipping is inherently sexist. It conforms to the societal expectation that good girls want bad boys, and that is a stupid and implausible relationship to establish.

Other forms of relationships aren't as dramatic, so they aren't going to be as immediately noticeable or impactful to young viewerz. ZoÎ and Wash from Firely were a happily married couple; there was literally just one episode of strife where Wash and Mal were able to get over their tension. Btw K2-SO is best droid because of good ol' Alan Two-Dicks. Homer and Marge Simpson have a marriage with plenty of ups and downs. But they both actually work on their problems in hilarious 22 minute intervals. Eric and Donna from That 70's show had their issues, but ultimately the dweeb who is really into Star Wars still ends up with the tall girl next door.

Romance itself has been romanticized. And I start to think of it in terms of Darius Kincaid from The Hitman's Bodyguard. Darius loves his wife, their romance was that of a husband who made a mistake but ultimately was dedicated to his partner. He wasn't a bad boy, despite being a total badass. He had a love for love itself, and took time out of his day to give his wife a new set of flowers to look at. Romance deserves a more realistic portrayal in the fundamentally unrealistic works of fiction. Because that helps the viewers feel grounded in the setting. I mean hell, Han Solo still got to second base with his girlfriend despite being in a heated battle on the forest moon of Endor. If that's not a real form of love, than what the hell is love? That's a reformed bad boy right there."
