GoldandBlack,ffbjvaf,t1_ff4adwn,1579768752.0,"I think we disagree on fundamental aspects of our understanding of freedom. My feeling is that you have a very uncompromising digital view where you are either completely free or if only one incremental piece of your freedom is taken you are completely unfree.

I have lived in many different countries with different degrees of freedom and I can tell you that there is nuance for the experienced everyday life. To me freedom is a spectrum and the fight is not about an end goal but a maximization of freedom. 

If I analyze the most important current threat to freedom or my personal freedom, its is not my fear of restraint of free movement. Honestly, if you are a self relyant successfull person that does not need the coerced monetary support of unrelated others, there is basically no restriction in where you are allowed to travel or settle and freedoms today are much higher than even the not so far past. Restriction is typically only set for people with a preset expectation of dependency. In that sense the restrictions of free movement are quite well aligned with an expected situation in a fully libertarian environment.

The major threat to my individual freedom now is cultural push to expand the circle of dependents and extend it to all sorts of groups or causes that are less and less related and also to increase the degree of entitlement. When the havenots talk about the 1% what they actually mean is the middle class. I live in Europe where we already have middle class people give more than 50% of their income to some type of redistribution and the mob is still not sattisfied."

Especially for the FED or the idea of interventionism I feel that the flaw is inherently built into the institution. 

My point is that it does not even really matter what decisions are made as long as they have a political aim of steering the economy. In that sense a market based monetary service would be much more favorable than the FED. At least here I seem to be somewhat in agreement with the lady. It apears that she has some basic understanding of the imposibility to make the right decision regarding the FED but I also must admit that I do have too few knowledge on her to make a really qualified judgement. In the end I can not really analyze if she would really attempt to reform the FED or if she would be just another delusional megalomaniac who believes she can achieve an unattainable goal of steering the market in the right direction and make it more efficient than it would be on its own. 

If we accept that Hayek is right with his economic calculation problem, the discussion of who is in charge of a non functional system is a little like the discussion if our rapist should wear a red skirt or a blue skirt.

Regarding pegging the dollar to gold, I think the answer is not so black and white. It is realistic that a lot of investment would flow into the dollar if it had an at least psychological stability against inflation. This would certainly make it hard for foreign powers to manipulate the value as they would be partially harming their selves and given their often flawed operating systems for their markets they are much more vulnerable to volatility than the US or other Western economies. Also if the US would peg against gold, it is likely that other major economies would have to follow suit in order to avoid a drain of capital towards the US. Likely only developing nations would keep fiat but certainly the Euro, the BP and Yen would also need to jump on board. With China slowly but surely thirsting for foreign investment I do not believe that they would not also have to somehow peg against dollar if the global economy is set up accordingly. Potentially they would have a dual currency system with fiat for internal trade and gold pegged currency for external. If I am right and all major economies would go for gold, it would make a manipualtion fairly hard as you would need billions if not trillions to make a notable dent to scare the markets. To compare, the FED has increased its balance sheet by several trillion in a very short timeframe after the financial crisis, yet this has not lead to loss of trust in the dollar. I can not imagine that if the dollar was pegged to gold some dark channel manipulator would really be able to have a considerable impact with his reserves.

Currently the total reserves of China are at about 3 trillion, of Russia at about 0.5 trillion and of SA at about 1.8 trillion. I do not see a scenario in which any of those major potential adversaries would be able to sacrifice a substantial amount of that to target gold in a meaningful way woithout taking a much deeper cut. In the end the direct hit they take is much higher than the indirect hit imposed on the US. It is a little like burining my house down in the hopes that my neighbors house is damaged."
GoldandBlack,ff6ah16,t1_ff4x77p,1579622904.0,I disagree. I think that someone who has a constructive contrarian view can help to transform an organization like the FED to make more sense. One example would be to come up with an automated mechanism that aligns the monetary value with the increased value creation inside of a time increment and ads a preset inflation margin like Friedman proposed. The major flaw upfront is the illusion that the FED is something that functions. Based on Hayek one has to assume that there is no one that is good at steering FED and it will always divert capital from efficient actors as it creates false incentives in its flawed attempt to use monetary volume to steer economic growth and unemployment.

You assign agency to me acting in self interest but pretend that others acting in their self interest is a fact of nature. I have no other choice but use the available tools of arbitration to manage my self interest where it collides with the interest of others.

You pretend that a recipient of wellfare that primarily seeks for a specific destination for the expected benefits is not party to the violation of rights. Also you pretend that the remuneration of the wellfare seeking migrant is not creating future obligations to reach even deeper into other people's pockets. The morality of it is not going to change the real world result. 

Also your assumption of the state of society vs. an ideal world libertarian construct is a little off. I see it rather like this: Citizens are forced members of a construct that is somewhat comparable to a HOA which has private homes and some shared property and infrastructure. In the frame of the HOA, my rights to define rules extends to the borders of the HOA and rules can only be defined in majority vote. With the current state of civilization all of the property is with HOAs or in some cases dictatorships that would be probably analogue to public housing. In order to get into another HOA you need to be accepted by the rules of the existing HOAs. I really support your will to transform the HOA into a non HOA neighborhood but to pretend that I can not make decisions in the frame of the HOA that will protect my interests because the HOA itself is not an ideal form of property management is absurd.

If Trump and his team still would not testify then we could talk about a valid case of obstruction. Making it a case for impeachment before all tools have been depleted is a funny move because the counter side will make exactly this case and rightly so. 

You have to play the devils advocate once in a while to gain a little perspective. If Trump assumes that the Dems are after him, why should he play their game and comply. He would be completely right to avoid any request from Congress assuming that they are acting as a partisan actor and exhaust all of his options before a cooperation is mandatory. 

Also I suspect that this kind of piss in your face by the different branches of government is sort of what the founders have intended to make government rather slow and inefficient.

Finaly no one argues that impeachment is not a political move and this is how it was designed.

Thanks for the splenaishon but you obviously do not know how the printing press works. When a government takes debt, it issues bonds or treasuries that are bought up on the market by anyone willing to purchase those bonds and in return they get a yield. This debt is not the printing press and is also not causing any inflation as the quantity of money was not expanded. Only people that own dollar can buy bonds or equivalent financial tools and accordingly there is no change on quantity of dollar. The printing press is when the fed prints money and  brings this into circulation beyod the value that is justified by actual economic activity. This volume that is circulated is reflected in the balance sheet and is one part of the printing press, as here assets or obligations are purchased on the market that are not paid for with money that was actually earned but with money that is created out of thin air. During Trump the balance sheet has decreased meaning that Trump has not used the printing press and also considering that the Fed Rate is at 2% ish compared with other major economies the US is not really utilizing the printing press to boost its economy.

Regarding Russia's willingness to meddle in the election, I think no one in his sain mind doubts it.

Actually under Trump the detrrant capacity of the US and by association of its allies has massively increased, which should be a thorn to Russia. 

The US under Trump is clearly confrontative with Russia on topics that matter, like the opposition to Northstream 2 and also regarding willingness to support Eastern European allies e.g. establishment of a military base in Poland. Also the military took out a substantial number of unmarked Russian soldiers in Syria that participated in an attempted land grab in the same spiel that Russia conducted in Krimea. Also Trump actually forces Nato and other allies to heavily increase into their military capabilities which also can hardly be in the interest of Russia. Call me a conspiracy theorist but I think that the narrative of Putin being sustainably pro Trump is rather serving as an excuse to those that produced a false narrative instead of actually reflecting the reality.

Regarding the wage hikes, it is certainly a combination. I think that the low unemployment rate is more attributable to deregulation and tax relief which fans the economy and enables min wage without decrease of jobs. But in such an economy I would be suprised if only min wage labor saw such a sharp hike and other low income stagnated. Also I think in public discourse the relevance of minimum wage in the context of the total economy is somewhat inflated, keeping in mind that only about 2.1% of workers earn min wage or less according to the bureau of labor statistics but by the nature of setup the lowest percentile is made up of 10% of the wage earners and the article even talks about the bottom 25%. Here the share of people that earn above the federal minimum wage and even above individual state minimum wages is substantial and certainly the vast majority and I would argue that the impact of min wage is negligible."

But I feel that you are avoiding the point, especially as a filthy rich can also be hit by mental health issues with no better cures available to him yet you apply moral responsibility to him that you would not to your self. 

I am not saying you are selfish to complain. I m saying if your morality makes it a virtue to look after the fiscally less fortunate, then this mandate should apply to everyone along the lines of their possibility. 

This was refuted by many people in the discussion with ""hey there are others that are so much richer than me, they should help and not me"". To which I respond if you are a Westerner and have an average income of like $ 35,000 you are inside of the global 1% of highest wage earners. That means that if you stand in a room of 100 random global citizens you are the single richest guy in that room. 

If you still feel that others have the obligation to help financially then you you should reevaluate your morals and maybe not demand from anyone to help, not even the ""filthy"" rich. Where is the moral cut of line, being the richest in a room of 1,000, of 10,000 of 1,000,000? 

My feeling is that people just do not want their selfs to be in that responsibility and shove it to someone else. That is also why so many people today are calling for the government to step in and do it for them because they are not willing to comply with self set moral standards.

worldnews,fecxcwh,t1_febeeor,1578988428.0,"You make good points I still disagree on the clasification of Suleimani. 

My major disagreement is on the application of international law and standards to Souleimani. In general standards for politicians along the lines of international law do not apply to terrorists and rightly so. This means if actors chose to engage in military agression outside of the conventions of fighting with marked armed forces complying with common accepted rules of engagement then also the protections to officials who directly participate do not apply. 

Based on my limited knowledge Souleimani is a Terror organizer. That means he supports main terror groups that do not fight in accordance with international law like Hesbolla, Hamas, groups in Iraq and Syria and so on. Here Iran is trying to have it both ways by actively circumventing international law through surrogates that are tied in to the chain of command and at the same time calling foul if a major actor in said chain of command that disregards international law and acts like a terrorist is eliminated in the same fashion as any other non state backed terror leader would. 

We have to keep in mind that international law is not a supranational law but much rather a direct agreement between individual memebers. You can not cherry pick which parts you want to adhere to, you have to respect the full set. 

I am not saying that the US is squeeky clean in this regard, in the recent past especially activities in Syria and in Lybia that lead to destabilization are highly comparable to what Iran is doing and one could argue that the US had engaged in acts of terror. In other words the concept of the CIA and the way it actievely influences other nations is quite comparable to the IRG and should be reconsidered."

worldnews,fe8gp43,t1_fe84ayx,1578925967.0,"The problem is that Iran acts both as a nation and at the same time as a quasi terrorist organization. 

Suleimani is directly responsible for terror acts performed in several armed conflicts accross the region. None of the activities backed by Iran and coordinated by Souleimani are legal along international law. The problem is that Iran is playing it both ways, acting as an asymetrical agent and engaging in terrorist activity with non marked soldiers using human shields as defense and at the same time claiming that international law applies to their terrorist actors. 

That is not how it works and the international law does not extend to terrorists and rightfully so. It is the same shtick that Hamas is playing by seperating their ""political"" arm and their ""militia"". Like this they pretend that they can conduct armed conflict without adherence to rules of engagement and at the same time reserve the right to outrage whenever an official is taken out as this is not ""legal"". The point is that once you engage in terrorism and ignore international law in combat the protections granted by said law are also invalid. 

International law is not a law that is agreed on from a supranational organization and then forced upon nations. It is a tacent agreement of engagement between nations in their interrelation. If a nation ignores the common rules on one aspect it cannot expect compliance with the others. 

Regarding the uncloaking, of course it was not clear to everybody. Not even 48h ago half of twitter was fearing outbreak of WWIII because of some delusion that Iran is actually powerful.

It is like preaching water and drinking wine.

The average person in the West has access to health care, education, enough food, shelter, individual mobility, water, enterteainment, holidays some form of old age compensation or care and also they enjoy other non fiscal advantages like secured rights, voting rights, living under rule of law, right to property, freedom of speech and so on. 

Now a global poor person usually does not have sufficient access to any of the above while the global rich have access to the above just partially at higher quantity or better quality. I think you really do not understand what poverty means if you think that the average guy in the West is poor. 

By your logic of moral responsibility only applying to the ""filthy rich"" anyone can abstain from acting morally as long there is someone else who is relatively richer.

Morals should be universal guidelines that apply to everybody if they are useful or worthy of living by and not to others first otherwise the morals are shit. Again I do not even agree with the morality of charity but if people think that charity is a moral thing they should not point to others and demand they be more charitable but rather go ahead and motivate by example and positivity. The way you see it there is a cut off at which the moral obligation starts and that is just really immoral as it allows individuals to live by different standards depending on their cicumstances.
