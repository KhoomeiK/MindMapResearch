college,ff7ige1,t3_es36ax,1579650306.0,You can stay. If she didn't like other people she could have gotten a single room
college,ff6v353,t3_erzos9,1579635492.0,No major is a dumb major. A lot of people with Gender studies can go into HR and management. It all depends on what you do with the degree...
college,ff6k07w,t1_ff6h7oj,1579628837.0,I'm really happy for you then!! I hope you do well if you take it again :))
college,ff6joct,t3_ery3bg,1579628635.0,It all depends on your major and where your strong suits are. It'll also depend on your professors and the school itself
college,ff6g08n,t3_erx9sn,1579626386.0,"I just used khan academy for free. You can study for as long as you want/feel necessary but honestly the test wasn't really meant to be studied for.  As for attempting to lower the fee, it's something you should be able to do but I'm not sure what the process is. Talk with an advisor about it"
college,ff56b83,t3_erolgg,1579581463.0,I think you can get your refund as long as you don't use the access code
college,ff564y4,t3_erpeis,1579581318.0,I'm going to be sending in my application in late February-early March and I'll be calling my high school's counseling office for confirmation on what to do
highschool,fem4hzg,t3_eo1grn,1579239476.0,"Look. First of all, I'd like to say I'm so sorry this happened to you. No one deserves to go through this amount of pain. Second of all, you're 19. She wasn't the girl of your dreams because she wasn't interested. She didn't feel the same way you did. I did agree with other commenters that your approach was wrong. Trying to buy her love and writing a 20 page sorry note just came off as too strong. Don't beat yourself up over something that was never going to happen. Keep going to therapy and remember that one person shouldn't keep you from being happy again."
college,fekbov4,t1_fek9nkj,1579196695.0,It happens. You were just on a break so you're probably just taking a second to adjust
college,fek5vps,t3_epl1gx,1579193257.0,"My first semester I took 10 credits which gave me time for a job. I took easy classes but I was really happy when I got all A's. I only worked about 18 hours a week because my job was only open on weekends, but if it wasn't I would have had extra time to work. It's 100% manageable, but if you wanted to graduate in the traditional amount of time, you may have to take 1-2 more classes next year. If you're okay with the possibility of doing another year, you can take as many credits you're comfortable with."
college,fejvsqf,t3_epkeb8,1579186998.0,"I'll be completing 23 this year and I'm a freshman too. Unless your school or financial aid requires you to complete a certain amount of credits, you're fine. I'm just going to take more classes a semester next year in order to ""catch up""."
college,fej4v1h,t3_epfl22,1579156982.0,Yes!! My options were an ebook for $170 or a physical copy for $260. Had to be bought new for an access code which is unfortunate since it's a 7 week class. I was doing my first assignment and I spent 15 minutes looking at one page because I couldn't bring myself to absorb the information
college,feikkum,t1_feikft1,1579140698.0,Oh and my English professor is also a published writer
college,feikft1,t3_epca3e,1579140603.0,My bio professor went to medical school to become a pediatrician. She didn't want to be a professor until later in her career
college,fef1l7x,t3_eoqaxj,1579046026.0,You can tell your professor you don't have enough and you have to wait until your next paycheck to purchase it. They might be lenient and let you turn in work later.
college,feen3ex,t3_eoqqn6,1579037100.0,Why not leave a few minutes before class ends instead of skipping entirely?
college,fedlljn,t3_eolnk6,1579014542.0,"First of all, I'm happy you found something you're passionate about. Second, music is a very difficult major to find success and jobs in. I recommend talking to your professors for advice and options that aren't teaching."
college,fe81exg,t3_eo0ujm,1578921324.0,"You can transfer whenever you want but some schools only take junior transfers (not a lot but a good handful), so do some research to make sure"
college,fe2lxvf,t3_eno6z2,1578840255.0,"4-year colleges are closing the application process soon.  You won't have a lot of time getting the required documents, but depending on the school's filing dates it shouldn't be impossible. 
With this last minute decision, you can apply to community college at any time. If you change your mind you can always transfer within a year or do the traditional two years. It's more cost efficient since you're not sure where to go."
college,fe09k1r,t3_enje3r,1578806906.0,You can transfer after any semester. Most people wait until they receive their associates
college,fdrypvn,t3_emxhax,1578691757.0,"If you think you won't get a good job unless you attend a big name university, then maybe college isn't for you..."
college,fdon0s3,t3_emgzuo,1578608469.0,Think about gas costs as well. Will gas ultimately be more expensive than the class itself?
college,fdkics9,t3_elvcrl,1578504430.0,There are grammatical errors (no commas) and make sure to add a period to your last paragraph
college,fdhdfk1,t3_elex98,1578420382.0,Why would you spend money on a class you don't need? If it won't go towards your degree then don't do it.
college,fdf9eeh,t1_fdf6zun,1578356376.0,"I feel like you're making fun of people who write thank-you emails?? Plus, while good evaluations are nice, it feels more personal when professors receive a positive email. A lot of them receive their ""can I have extra credit?""emails so I literally do not see how it can be overkill."
college,fdf93wn,t3_el2mmt,1578356181.0,"Yes. Some key things you should mention are the fact that you enjoyed their class and that you wish them well for the future. This is a time where they're getting emails asking them to round up grades. They'll appreciate your time and positivity.
Don't think about it like you're sucking up to them. You're not. You're just writing them a genuine email to show genuine appreciation."
college,fde5fy4,t3_ekpwkz,1578331587.0,I'm in a similar situation. I have one who has to actually post the final grade and one who has to change my grade. I'm positive they wouldn't just leave my grade like that so I'll put trust into them. If it's not fixed by the end of January I'd email them or directly talk to them
college,fde52ro,t3_ekq79x,1578331359.0,"I never want to say it's too late to do anything. If you truly want to go through with changing majors, you may have to do another year or two in order to complete it."
college,fdciehl,t1_fdci8p0,1578275670.0,"You may find it harder than your classmates, but if you're willing to put the extra work in, go for it."
college,fdaf622,t1_fdaeqxv,1578245392.0,This is an awful and untrue statement...
college,fda0dsv,t1_fd9zkpg,1578240267.0,I'm so happy you found something you're passionate about :))!! I 100% agree with you as well. I see a lot of STEM majors on here who aren't actually driven.
college,fd9wwuu,t3_ekdpt9,1578239000.0,"Everyone thinks ""if I go to New York, I'll have a lot of opportunities"". Yes, you would, but every state has opportunities too. Do some more research before choosing to move to a way more expensive state."
college,fd6p9cp,t3_ek6zfq,1578194068.0,"I may be wrong so asking your admin would be a better option, but I believe it'll say that you've earned x/x amount of credits needed to graduate. I have no idea though..."
college,fd6n6lh,t3_ek55hy,1578193349.0,You never know unless you apply
Anxiety,fczi92o,t1_fczi6dk,1578101835.0,I did;; I didn't get a response yet
college,fczb0fb,t3_ejmfsa,1578097286.0,"I really enjoyed the thought of going to this school. Applications were interview based and I enjoyed the campus. I read the reviews which ultimately led me off from not applying. I heard one saying that their daughter couldn't get a job and another one saying that their assignments were to watch a YouTube video. Maybe it's a good idea, maybe it's not. I can't say because I didn't apply or go there, but the overwhelming amount of negative reviews speaks for itself."
college,fcuha0a,t3_eizlua,1577980932.0,"You can apply and use a section of the common app explaining your situation with your grades. Overall, community college is a great plan that will save you money and they don't care if you have a 4.0 or a 1.0 GPA. I did really bad my freshman and sophomore year but I was able to slightly pick it up and graduate with a 2.8. I go to community college and I earned a 3.9 my first semester. You have a decently good chance so it's still worth a try :)"
college,fctb55s,t3_eiqrbr,1577937825.0,"I would love to major in something like engineering or computer science because it's so interesting to me and I know it'll bring me a stable job with a good paycheck. However...I know that I won't excel in the courses necessary to complete these degrees. Also, don't listen to what anyone has to say about what a ""good"" paycheck means. Major in what you love and who cares about how much money it brings?"
college,fcs2jgl,t3_eiiwrn,1577910500.0,Once you're on your death bed
college,fcoyscy,t3_eiclfr,1577845338.0,Just be careful because some 4-years want you to complete most of your intended major there
college,fck334k,t3_ehio0x,1577715130.0,"If you went to their office hours a few times, you should be good. Even if you didn't, I'm sure they'd be more than happy to help you"
college,fc6h603,t3_eggmtz,1577480475.0,You're able to appeal any letter grade
college,fbyyn0q,t3_ef8nq5,1577229925.0,"To my knowledge, you have to send your full transcript. You can't just pick and choose what semester you can send (of course it might be different in another state). If it makes you feel better, having a grade track going up can look better than if you were just average. Just all depends on the administrator reviewing your application."
college,fbyi82x,t3_ef66nl,1577217537.0,You can appeal any letter grade. You can get a B and appeal if you think you deserved an A.
college,fbumc67,t3_eemam0,1577116814.0,That's a decent amount of distance. You'll get your independence depending on how crazy your parents are
