You might miss it, but Gust says the schools need rebuilding in Kandahar, Afghanistan after the Soviet-Afghan war ('79 - '89).

They weren't rebuilt, and the US funded, and trained Mujahideen became the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and the rest is the history of the early 21st century.

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Wilson%27s_War_\(film\)):

> Gust vehemently advises Charlie to seek support for post-Soviet occupation Afghanistan. He also emphasizes that rehabilitating schools in the country will help educate young children before they are influenced by the ""crazies"". Charlie attempts to appeal this with the government but finds no enthusiasm for even the modest measures he proposes. In the end, Charlie receives a major commendation for his support of the U.S. clandestine services, but his pride is tempered by his fears of the blowback his secret efforts could yield in the future and the implications of U.S. disengagement from Afghanistan."
