LifeAfterSchool,ffgjw0h,t3_et5fnu,1579907921.0,"My ex had this image in his head that by age 24 he would have his college degree, be at least engaged, employed with Raytheon, and have a house. 

We met when he was 24, he was a college dropout, he was working as a delivery driver, living in his brother’s spare room, and I think he wanted me SO BAD to be his dream girl so he could get engaged. 

I’m not saying there’s anything bad with making plans. But don’t always expect things to always go your way. I didn’t judge him for not being at the point he wanted to be at that time. I knew he was gonna get to it. Just later on. He needed to slow down. I think he started up community college again, still dreaming of becoming an engineer. I think he’s still with the girl he dated after me. I’m not sure about much else. All I know is that he’s not a failure for not meeting his timeline. Life is hard. School is hard. Relationships are hard. Doesn’t matter if he doesn’t make it until he’s 44 instead of 24. He’ll make it. And so will you."

I see just about the same results that I saw using .05% tretinoin, but MUCH less irritation and dryness. The differin is definitely very drying, but it’s a manageable dryness that I can counter with a night cream.

They use the excuse that BMI isnâ€™t a good health indicator because there are athletes and bodybuilders (like The Rock) with 30+ BMIs who are healthy. But they fail to realize that these are ATHLETES and BODYBUILDERS. They bulk up with strict diets and tons of exercise. They have low body fat and high muscle content. Linebackers have a six pack underneath the chub. And the people Using the BMI in athletes excuse forget that they are couch potatoes with horrible diets and know comparing themselves to people like The Rock is a bad faith argument

I donâ€™t force myself to finish a plate of food. If Iâ€™m full Iâ€™m full. Iâ€™ll try to eat the rest later. Sometimes Iâ€™ll order a to-go pasta from a restaurant and eat that plate as lunch and dinner, sometimes even take it to eat at work the next day. I donâ€™t stuff my face. I think a huge problem is portion control. People eat portions for 2-3 people in one sitting just because it fits on the plate."
