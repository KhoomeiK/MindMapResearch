acne,ffan8ub,t3_ese2wn,1579739927.0,"Fuck them kids. You‚Äôre gorgeous. With and without makeup. The purpose of makeup, the reason Rihanna is a billionaire, is because it makes us look a lil different from what we normally look like. You‚Äôre absolutely not a catfish. You‚Äôre a girl who wears makeup when she goes out, like 99% of other girls who go out."

Skincare_Addiction,ff51zwx,t3_ernmvl,1579578062.0,"Just go easy for the next few weeks. Try to avoid actives and moisturize. I burned my skin using TO AHA/BHA mask even though I used it multiple times in the past. Whatever moisturizer you use, i recommend putting a tiny bit of aquaphor above the moisturizer to ‚Äúlock‚Äù it in. I started on differin and it dried my skin like a desert. Cerave night cream and a drop of quake was oil, let it sit for a little, like 5 minutes, then the aquaphor on top made a world of difference. My skin stopped flaking after like 3 days of doing this at night. Drink tons of water!"
niceguys,ff51ouf,t3_eri79b,1579577834.0,This reminds me of my ex. I couldn‚Äôt text him every second of the day and hed get pissy. If I would be on the phone texting someone he‚Äôd be like ‚Äúnice to see you got time for other hoes‚Äù. And one time we went out I said I thought a girl at the club looked pretty and he said ‚Äúwell why don‚Äôt you go make her your GIRLFRIEND‚Äù very angrily. That was the last night I ever went out with him. I slowed contact down before breaking up with him over text because I couldn‚Äôt find a time to see him in person and the conversation kind of grew into a breakup conversation organically
crochet,ff4jsuj,t3_erhey3,1579565326.0,"I have a question, and forgive my absolute ignorance- I only picked up a crochet needle for the first time a month ago and like Jon snow I know NOTHING- do you guys stuff these little guys or are these crochet all inside?"
acne,feypbhp,t1_fexcj9c,1579448604.0,"I recommend hada labo gokujyun premium toner in the orange bottle after the face wash (if you check it out it‚Äôs gonna say lotion but that‚Äôs the Japanese word for toner) It‚Äôs sort of slimy but it‚Äôs great for dry skin and gets a bunch of the day‚Äôs hunk off hour face. 

I started on spiro and differin about a month ago and I was struggling with flaky skin. The toner did a world of difference. Also I got a dedicated night cream (I think it‚Äôs cerave, a white tub l with a green lid, with a drop of squalene oil for an extra moisture boost). It honestly makes so much difference. I notice that the nights I don‚Äôt use the night cream and oil for whatever reason (like I forget to after I let my differin dry out) I wake up with dry, almost flaky skin. 

Don‚Äôt forget to use sunscreen every day!"
SkincareAddiction,feim71c,t1_feiaohb,1579141791.0,"I got prescribed spiro differin and clindamycin. I‚Äôve been using the spiro and differin for about 3 weeks and I purged badly for the first 2 weeks. I started the clindamycin last week. I added hada labo premium lotion, and a drop of squalene oil to the night cream that I use and my skin is SOFT. I still can feel acne underneath my skin, but the little bumps that had all over are disappearing. I think I‚Äôll start seeing more results regarding my acne by the time spring rolls around."
tretinoin,feiia35,t1_fehfqeh,1579139165.0,"I used this exact same brand and strength from Mexico and it worked great for me for a few months, but my skin is personally just way too sensitive for it to be used more than once a week. It worked wonders for my skin during the 5-6 months I did use it daily though. The dryness was just out of control in my case. Right now I‚Äôm off it entirely because my derm prescribed spiro and differin which is working wonders."
tretinoin,feihv8s,t1_feho4hj,1579138893.0,Farmacias Similares are common like a Walgreens or CVS. They function about the same.
tretinoin,feihr37,t3_ep6ke5,1579138815.0,"That‚Äôs the exact one I got! I had to stop using it because my skin is just too delicate, but wow did it work wonders for the 5 months I was using it religiously. 

Also y‚Äôall topical clindamycin is very often prescribed by dermatologists. You can get this down in Mexico as well without a prescription and without breaking the bank. Only topical though, no oral medication. Also VERY cheap."
SkincareAddiction,fei5p08,t1_fehzunu,1579130850.0,"I LOVE differin. I was actually prescribed it, the clindamycin, plus spironolactone. I had a pretty horrid breakout on the left side of my face that was a combination of closed comedones, blackheads, whiteheads, and cystic acne. 

I‚Äôve been on this regimen for about 3 weeks and I‚Äôm already seeing results. I feel like the differin has done wonders especially for the deep acne. I see just about the same results that I saw using .05% tretinoin, but MUCH less irritation and dryness. The differin is definitely very drying, but it‚Äôs a manageable dryness that I can counter with a night cream. I couldn‚Äôt do anything about the dryness and irritation from the tret and had to stop it altogether. There was a little bit of a purge, but for me it lasted just about a week."
SkincareAddiction,fehc20d,t1_feh7sey,1579113472.0,"Several oils, creams, exfoliants, retinoids, etc. I took out a bunch of actives from my routine. A 5 step routine with different products for morning and evening isn‚Äôt complicated, in my opinion."

SkincareAddiction,feh3eek,t1_fegkl6e,1579108321.0,"Sometimes a simple routine will work much better than one with 80 products in it. I had an extensive routine based off products on this sub and it was making everything worse. Now, I just have my face wash (oil wash first if I wore makeup), my toner, vitamin C, and clindamycin in the morning followed by sunscreen, and differin at night followed by cerave moisturizer with a drop of squalene oil bc my face is sensitive and dries out to the point of peeling and flaking. If I‚Äôm going out I add an oil that is a light mixture of jojoba, argan, and something else that I can‚Äôt remember at the moment for some extra moisture (again, my face dries out!)"
toastme,fec8hwc,t3_eo5dhj,1578968498.0,"Congratulations! Being in the navy was my dream for so many years. Enlisted during my senior year in high school.

fatlogic,fdobjij,t1_fdnymsy,1578602204.0,That‚Äôs what I try to tell people. They use the excuse that BMI isn‚Äôt a good health indicator because there are athletes and bodybuilders (like The Rock) with 30+ BMIs who are healthy. But they fail to realize that these are ATHLETES and BODYBUILDERS. They bulk up with strict diets and tons of exercise. They have low body fat and high muscle content. Linebackers have a six pack underneath the chub. And the people Using the BMI in athletes excuse forget that they are couch potatoes with horrible diets and know comparing themselves to people like The Rock is a bad faith argument
fatlogic,fdob5fh,t1_fdnjae5,1578602015.0,That‚Äôs another thing. People say ‚ÄúBMI isn‚Äôt an indicator of health! Lots of athletes/ bodybuilders have a high BMI!‚Äù Yeah but they are ATHLETES and BODYBUILDERS. They bulk with specific macros and for a purpose. Most people with a BMI of 30+ are couch potatoes with a terrible diet. Their weight is fat and not composed entirely of muscle.
