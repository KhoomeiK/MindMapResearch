Pic is for reference."

Monsterverse,fexr617,t3_eq53g7,1579435015.0,"Because even if it was said he's still has to grow, his parents' skeletons weren't that big, and he appearently  grew four times larger from teenager to adult. I know this is pretty much fantasy but that's one hell of a growth spurt."
GODZILLA,fexq1vt,t1_fexpf2v,1579434635.0,"It's the same, Showa just has no design continuity. From Raids Again to Terror of Mechagodzilla there's only one Goji"
Monsterverse,fexpouz,t3_eqh98r,1579434512.0,"1.- Probably utter shock that beings that big exist, however I'd probably start trying to find more info about them, with me loving both paleontology and biology.

2.- There was no Titan in my country (Spain) so I'd probably be just glued to any news source I can find 

3.- By that time I should be studying biology already so I'd probably try to get involved with Monarch and try to study the Titans"

witcher,fdgfgzw,t1_fdfsy8g,1578394368.0,Well while that's true I feel like their wings should connect with their thighs or knees like Pterosaurs or Ghidorah from the last Godzilla movie. They just feel so small.
