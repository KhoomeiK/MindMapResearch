Seattle,fffofwx,t1_fffjejm,1579888328.0,"I hope you don't mind me chiming in as a regional native. The freeze has a couple separate common components. 

One is that we don't tend to interrupt or initiate idle conversation without a social cue, like standing in line or such. We're also polite and reserved in general. That doesn't mean we don't still enjoy chatting in cafe's or bars, but we generally consider it more polite to just stay quiet than to keep a conversation going for it's own sake. I have some Floridian friends who took awhile to learn not to be surprised/disappointed when an idle conversation simply ended.

The other commonly cited component of the freeze is that we don't do the mid-west or southern style ""casual"" friendships. We have friends, and we have acquaintances, but we're not going to spend a lot of time/effort maintaining large groups of almost-friends. As an example, hanging out once doesn't mean that we're going to make it a regular occurrence, which seems to confuse some people moving to the area. We also don't tend to do large frequent events like neighborhood barbecues. You're rarely going to receive an invite to an event from someone other than the host.

It's also worth noting that [only 3 out of 10 Seattleites were even born in this state](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/most-people-in-seattle-are-from-somewhere-else-so-what-does-that-say-about-the-seattle-freeze/).

Skirt and Ribeye (if you like chunky fat) are popular for this. I generally prefer skirt, though I've heard that hanger is even better.

I go for higher heat. A long slow cook will get you pot-roast.

Salt your meat (which you should be doing a few hours before anyways, it boosts flavor and holds juices better no matter how you cook it). Let the steak come to room temperature (doesn't take long), don't try and cook it still refrigerated, or if you're feeling fancy maybe try a sous vide (never done this myself).

I like to pre-heat a cast iron skillet (using the closest size to my cut of meat) at max temp in the oven, give it just a touch of oil to prevent sticking, then drop your steak into that, and use the broiler like a grill (or if the weather is nice just use an outdoor grill). Turn only once during cooking, as flipping repeatedly can dry it out (which is where I think a lot of people mess up). You want a nice flavorful crust.

Then make sure to rest your steak for a few minutes before cutting into it. You can pull it earlier if you want to rest it in the pan, or pull it later for better crust and rest it in another warm dish. This is often where people go past well-done and into dry territory, since the steak doesn't stop cooking immediately when taken off the heat.

**Quickly** roasting them in a nice hot oven (at least 400) with olive oil and salt is going to be the simplest method. You can also saute them in a good heavy pan. The inside should be steaming, soft, and sweet. Sort of like broccoli (which is also often overcooked). If you're just getting started, err to the side of underdone instead of overdone.

Alternatively, you can caramelize them by cutting in half first, liberally coating in oil, and roasting them a little longer (going to depend on your oven), flat side down to the baking sheet. A little char on the outside (like grill marks) is fine. Err to higher heat and shorter roasting, again to avoid drying them out and turning bad.

This way they come out sweet and crunchy. These are great on their own, and even better when tossed with some caramelized onions and crumbled bacon (an excelled holiday side dish). Brussel sprouts are easily modified. Try stuff like a sprinkle of parmesan about 10 minutes before pulling them out. Or drizzling with balsamic and grilled.
