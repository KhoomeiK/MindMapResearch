 It looks like ""next fucking level"" material but is computer-generated. Any player input can be generated by a computer program, and is testable, exact and measurable. This looks impressive and shows possible benchmarks, ie. here's how fast the game can be beaten. 

Call me cynical, but any videos of ""godlike"" Mario performances, especially ones without video of the player's hands, raise the question of tool assisted gameplay."
