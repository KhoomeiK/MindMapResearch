You’re beautiful because of your courage to confront your father and your decision to live despite hardship. Remember always that the body wants to live, and that only your psyche wants to die and take the body along with it as collateral. Life is courage itself. Every moment you are dying and being reborn. Anyways I wish you peace and love."

His years in the city as a merchant is a reflection of the hidden worldly desires within him. They needed to manifest. Otherwise his surrender of worldliness would be phony. Therefore he explores this side of himself. This is a big part of the book as far as I can tell. It must all be experienced."

Though he has no attachment. This is the desireless state."

This requires an understanding of Zen as well as every other field of study. I, on the other hand, am saying that throughout my study and practice of many other ‘spiritual’ practices besides Zen I have noticed that the lessons behind the Zen sayings I have become familiar with are practically the same as those that other paths give. If you haven’t studied or practiced other things, you can’t talk. After a while a deep study is not even needed, anyways. After a while a deep understanding is gained only through the first sight of something. I will admit that on the outside Zen seems pretty unique."

This is ‘reality.’ God cannot be in the same realm as the ‘physical.’ Think about it. If he created this reality then how could he also be of the substance of this reality? Who would have created the substance that makes up his self? Therefore, god is no self. God is infinite consciousness, and you are that same consciousness, only limited by the mind, clinging on to your reality."

zen,ferty8q,t1_ferrczs,1579358297.0,"Sure. The process of giving up is full acceptance. Acceptance of who you are, fully, removes your agency. Once you start accepting you will see who you really are, because you will accept who you are not and stop focusing on who you are not. In other words, you will stop all ego and just be. This is the overall meaning of it. But also it means that it is not necessary to go and do anything right now. The journey of the Jiva is long long long, and the path is a genuine one, not a fake one. So there is no reason to attempt to give up your mind when you are not ready. There is really no difference between mind and no mind. It is only that mind is an attachment. This is why acceptance is the way. It removes all attachments. Attachment is a refusal to accept reality, so you cling to one thing out of desperation. Accept all things and there is no desperation, no attachment, no worry, no ego, no mind."

If you do anything halfheartedly then you will not attain anything. Thankfully all that you're seeking is not an attainment and is already there. But it is no easy joke to realize enlightenment. To lay down your mind. That certainly does require the greatest amount of self effort. Self surrender is the greatest self effort. It is real death, and only the strongest and most sincere can go through that. Is this you? Are you ready to give up everything you've known? Well good thing you don't have to! You don't have to do anything but be yourself, with all your flaws. If anyone is reading this besides you I will have my Zenny Boy status removed so don't tell a soul. Self surrender is full acceptance of who you are: the person who wants to change himself to attain something. That's who you probably are. I don't know, I don't know you. But you do. Accept that person and surrender to him. Then as time goes on and incarnations come and go or maybe they don't you'll realize you're God and then realize you're nothing. This is the void. Congratulations, you've attained it. Nothing. How's that an attainment again? It's not, you were always nothing, and this is a silly game. I'm a fucking goose, you get it? 

As for your practice, do what is most sincere to your nature! You cannot fake it! How silly this notion. You can try out the fake it till you make it if you want to. Most everyone does. Then they realize they're not being genuine so they stop and become true to themselves. Enter the dark night."
zen,fephomw,t1_feph31r,1579320764.0,"So how can my opinion about the Buddha have any impact on yours? Do you think that if more people think the Buddha can fly it will have any impact on the truth of the statement: ""The Buddha can fly""? Gosh, you'd have the most horrendous time reading *The Autobiography of a Yogi*, and you would miss all the beautiful insight the book has. Likewise if you keep focusing on such things when you read a koan. It is like how countless Indians look at Rama and say ""this did not happen!"" and then they miss the entire point and beauty of the Ramayana, as if the scientific merits of the book meant anything at all. You should just believe what you believe. Believe what you have experienced. Otherwise you are not genuine. Don't believe that the Buddha had siddhis. It doesn't matter. Anytime you see a koan that mentions a siddhi (I don't even know if there are any), disregard that aspect and see it in the light that you see it in. You can only believe what you have lived. Maybe someday you will live some other experience and your views will change. Until then, be confident in your current views. Just don't become an asshat like me."

The jokes and trolls are a big part of this sub. Only when you can see everyone as the same can you see how they are actually incredibly beautiful. You won't find yourself with Zen.

nihilism,fep2ic7,t1_feozwut,1579310676.0,"They are rhetorical questions, aimed to make you think about what you've said. My position is not an addition, just a consequence of nihilism. There is no meaning to life, so live that and be open to it all. To be open to it all also means that you can be open to the idea of closing yourself off from things. It is basically saying nothing, which is the most nihilistic thing you can say. The point is to be free as a nihilist. It is the only thing which follows almost directly from nihilism. And still many so-called nihilists are slaves to their own minds and opinions of the world. Nihilism is not a practical philosophy, because its foundation is rooted in the most basic principle of what is. Stillness, meaninglessness. Therefore when that principle is added onto and the world manifests, the nihilist basically becomes stumped because, should he or shouldn't he? ""Life has no meaning, I should not."" ""Life has no meaning, I should!"" There is no answer in nihilism. The idea is to not be stumped and to just do. Just be."
singing,feoyqvs,t3_eq4a91,1579308303.0,"Soul and spirit is what matters. This is it. If you have the spirit and soul to commit yourself to taking lessons and perfecting the art of singing and you do this with great vigor and intensity then you will be a fantastic singer. If you have no such spirit but your spirit lies in some other aspect of singing, like for example perhaps you sing differently like Bob Dylan or Connor Oberst then you will also succeed despite not having the most technical skill. The intensity is what matters. If you go about learning how to sing without much intensity, you won't be very good."

islam,fem5ivi,t3_eps33m,1579240489.0,"Basically none of this is true. Firstly, few people actually mock Muslim women, they either criticize the faith, society, or men who make their wives and daughters wear it. Secondly, the fashion industry does not deal with love at all. It is mostly about lust, and is a product of man's lower nature. It is up to the family of a young girl to instill values in their child. To be upset with society for its natural lower urges is futile. It won't be changed anytime soon, and repression isn't the answer. 

My question is if women are supposed to cover up out of respect for God, why don't men also have to do this? It seems more so that this rule was made out of egoic fear that basically all men have of other men seeing their women."
