teenagers,fgx4sif,t1_fgwpaw9,1581169082.0,"Why are you thanking them for spamming dots all over the screen back at you after you did it? That’s really no reason to thank anyone for. It would make sense to thank me when I spread my knowledge on the subject of the supertatives that allow for you to instigate the inclination of willful ignorance in relation to a 1080p monitor, a subject which I am an expert on, but not an annoying spam comment of a bunch of dots which you shouldn’t have posted in the first place either. Due to the lack of discussion and encouragement of such from these posts and comments, I have downvoted them all and you might find this upsetting because you didn’t expect your useless post to get called out for what it is, nor have this received an in-depth, intelligent response such as this, and from someone of my intellect. So think logically here, you were using Reddit in a useless and irresponsible fashion and I called you out for it, plain and simple. What I have said is fair to say so at the end of the day there’s really no reason to downvote me whatsoever. I left a helpful comment unlike yours and do not deserve it. You cannot downvote a comment like mine."

Imagine a 1080p monitor that only displays in black and white, what a nightmare that would be!

The tees, bushes, habitats, wildlife, bamboo mountains like Mt Everest which is where you can go if you instigate the inclination of willful ignorance in relation to a 1080p monitor using the appropriate supertatives, clouds, climate and more.

And if you think this is cool, you must be out of your mind to the point where squirting a ton of mustard and ketchup all over your hands is a cool look, because that’s all I see when I look at this poorly made “guide”. The officials on Mt Everest probably will not let you in their huts if you seriously don’t wash your hands properly, which is a shame for you if you’re planning on going to Mt Everest by instigating the inclination of willful ignorance in relation to a 1080p monitor anytime soon.

gravityfalls,fguwjsc,t1_fguto9g,1581131024.0,What are you saying? Are you seriously claiming that leaving out the “a” is more correct? Because that is outlandishly stupid and I hope you realize it.

arcticmonkeys,fguhg60,t1_fguh6l6,1581120897.0,Why do you want them to make a music video disrespecting their awards? That’s a very dumb idea and only The Weeknd can do that good. See the Starboy music video to see what I mean. I downvoted your comment and this post because it’s plagiarism of the guy’s Instagram.
