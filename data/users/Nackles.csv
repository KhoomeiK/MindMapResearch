MakeFriendsOver30,ffqty9u,t3_euoetb,1580143576.0,"I've been in similar straits and it suuuuuuuuucks.  Two recs for funny listening:

1. [Ep 220 of the God Awful Movies podcast](https://player.fm/series/god-awful-movies-2504626/gam220-gramps-goes-to-college), about a movie where a transparent Mary Sue character defeats ""evolutionists"" in his local college.  I think anyone who isn't atheist might find this podcast offensive, because it's not kind to religion, but it's also very, very funny;
2. [Episode 90 of the Songtopsy Report](https://player.fm/series/the-songtopsy-report/ep-29-the-most-insane-christmas-song-ever-written-an-old-fashioned-christmas-daddys-home), about a Christmas song where people think their father died, but then he didn't.  How festive.

And for stuff to read that makes me laugh, it's juvenile but I will always crack up--no matter how many times I read them--over the Amazon reviews of the [Haribo Surgarless Gummy Bears](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/michaelrusch/haribo-gummy-bear-reviews-on-amazon-are-the-most-insane-thin).

And finally, [this game](https://armorgames.com/play/6450/epic-coaster) is incredibly simple but also (IME) hypnotic.  Sometimes you need something that just keeps you from thinking.

Good luck."
