DMAcademy,fgsl01k,t3_f09vc2,1581086949.0,"It's common to struggle as a new DM. It takes practice like everything else in life. It's great that you listen to feedback but don't let it ruin your motivation. It's ok to avoid negative feedback until you get more confident. Talk to your players, you are new and you need support. If you/the GM breaks, then there will be no game at all.   
  
It's ok to create group rules that makes things easier like ""everyone cooperate, or you make a new PC"".   
  
Do only the things you like to do. Some play homebrew and some play pre-written, some prepare while others improvise, some create fancy maps and some just scribble some lines on a paper or run theatre in mind."

You have stated the following:  
-	wife returns home after being out with her sister  
-	husband stayed home to care of kids  
-	husband says that he also did other chores when they get back  
-	sister of wife thinks he is proud and also makes the assumption that he wants to be thanked  
-	wife tells her husband that he should not expect any compliments just because he did more than expected.   
-	you are inspired by how wife treated her husband  
  
And you call me bizarre. There got to be more to the story that makes her action justified. Right now the wife just sounds bitter and rude. Not a great inspiration."

battlemaps,ffwd6th,t1_ffw5yyc,1580296257.0,The AP is pretty good as it is but don't be afraid to adapt the situation as a GM. You can add/remove/change/move enemies on the maps depending how easy/hard it is for the group. This final fight can be anything from a walk in the park to a struggle depending on the group.
Roll20,ffwcgok,t1_ffw6lz6,1580295269.0,"Talk to DM about it and let he/she deal with the player. If it doesn't change and this is a big deal for you, then you should leave the game."
DMAcademy,ffu9512,t3_ev8zc8,1580237091.0,"Does the BBEG end the world the instant PCs lose? Many end-of-the-world scenarios take time. We played a campaign where the BBEG would enslave the world if he managed to get free from his dimension. Losing that fight would create a world where his armies cross the lands. This would also upset others super villains that tries to stop him since it ruins their plans. Another scenario is releasing an even greater enemy in which the PC would need to cooperate with the old villain to be able to defeat.   
  
Worlds seldom vanish, they can change for the worse but you can still play in it. They even did that in Avengers.  
  
Don't know much about this Atropus guy but it does sound like even he needs some time to lay waste to a planet and with a world with a pantheon of gods, there gotta be some powerful resistance. Personally, i am not a big fan of gods as villains since they should be in a totally different league. Like throw-away-the-rulebook-level since they are powerful to do whatever they want as creators of the universe."
rpg,ffipfwq,t3_ettoi4,1579979446.0,"I run modules and APs from Paizo/Pathfinder and I really wish they had better maps. The low resolution is not good enough when you want to use them in roll20. Worst scenario is no map at all for an encounter. I love pictures that can be used, except notes. I can create my own notes if you give me the text.   
  
Other than that, I think they create great stuff with indexed PDFs, background for each encounter and explenations why npcs are there and what they want. Ironfang Invasion AP and The Harrowing module have great designs that allows the players to deal with different areas in any order they like.   
  
Another thing I really like is that they have started doing [trailers](https://youtu.be/T43E5KSwTzE) for their adventures which help hyping the players (and GMs)."

I would rate it at the same level as PoE2 but I am way more interested in Golarion. The last extra-chapter of Kingmaker does suck though and PoE2 did have a better end-game.   
  
**Compared to BG**: BG1&2 use a very old ruleset (2e) with few options during level ups. BG1 has even less options than BG2. Both games have very good story and characters. As for today, I would choose the more modern Kingmaker. As for characters in Kingmaker, I do love the gloomy dwarf Harrim, Amiri is another classic which is also an iconic for Pathfinder. The villain is interesting but no way near Irenicus in BG2."

The world is called Golarion has some minor lore changes like elves having alien eyes. For gods, this game focus much on the dwarven god of creation Torag, the beauty goddess shelyn, the doomsday god Groetus and the demon goddess Lamashtu.
