Prevolt I am not forgetting you, I just wait for biochip to see if from UK he gets better pricing and timing for the shipping.

after checking with france postal services they confirm 30 euros / 10 days (without insurance or tracking)

I don't know if you are in a hurry of not to get the parts :)

I'll look here everyday, or you can message me in PM.

hotas,fd8e6oj,t1_fd5u039,1578217379.0,"Ha!! the  Ü2 NXT gimbals were made by an australian genius ""ian johnston"" in the years following the cougar's arrival. No 3D printing in that time, They are machined aluminium and are to be paired with contactless hall sensors that were provided by another mad engineer ""cubpilot"".

Both guys dropped from view, even though I contacted ian a few years back to order enough springs so I can use the cougar until the stick itself break or the electronic burns :)

Here are some pictures :

If you think people are following the russian sticks manufacturers delivery time today, its nothing compared to the NXT mania we had then :D

I just made a quick weighting of the original gimbals, they are a tad under 800 Grams, or 600 at second weighting, or maybe 700..? Okay I have a shitty kitchen scale :) . Using up to 1Kg to be sure on the postal services site, the posting from France is starting at 25-30 euros :(  and up to 10 days to deliver :( .

I have a feeling that biochip will have a better deal in cost and time, being closer and in the commonwealth and all...  :)  Even if he's a silly british kinigget...
