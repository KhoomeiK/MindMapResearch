MakeupRehab,ffmg1qj,t3_eqlxfw,1580054196.0,"I’ve dreaded doing a skincare inventory too honestly.. it’s wayyyy worse than my beauty inventory. And I’ve been working on purchasing less stuff for the past 3 years! This year I’m on a no buy and I also want to pay off debt. But i feel more frustrated then happy about the accumulation of unnecessary things. And I’m happy about that because I do think my mindset of overspending and having a back stock is finally changing. It takes time to make these changes, so don’t be too hard on yourself."
