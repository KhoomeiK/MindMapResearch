tumblr,ff3k3gp,t1_ff2d8hs,1579542737.0,Technically we do but if they actually have copies I wouldn’t know because I’ve never been able to get one. So they could have a few copies that are constantly checked out but I can’t confirm that.
tumblr,ff1edfg,t1_fexh86q,1579478130.0,Yeah. Like $40ish for the $200 ones and like $10 for a cheaper one. You rent for the whole semester.

college,felevb7,t3_eppk13,1579220531.0,"If you eat cheaply and don’t drive much. I use about $150ish for gas in a month because I have a far commute and food can cost even more if you don’t budget carefully. 

The food is totally doable but can be hard watching everyone else eat whatever they want. The gas really depends on how much you drive and your mileage."
college,felei7n,t3_epplm0,1579220288.0,"My birthday is actually coming up next week so I’ve thought about this a bit — although because of my schedule I’ll be celebrating on the day before. Though I’ll be honest, I’ve never done more than go out to eat with my family for my birthday so my ideas might be lame but here goes.

I’d definitely say whatever counts as comfort food or a treat for you is a good plan. I like the cupcake plan! I might steal it honestly. If you decide to do a movie you can grab some popcorn and snacks and hunker down somewhere comfy. 

Maybe treat yourself to an item you’ve wanted for awhile that’s cheap but you still haven’t bought it anyway cause other things were more important — a good book, new earbuds, a nice pair of fuzzy soft socks for lounging around, a new movie/game/album, some nice pens.

You could also do something online — maybe skype/video chat with someone. You could make them sing happy birthday to you.

Also you could just do a “treat yourself” day if it won’t completely screw over your budget. I recommend pedicures for everyone — foot massage and a mini hot tub for your feet! It feels excellent. But seriously most important is to do things you like obviously."
college,feku14g,t3_epl7cy,1579207588.0,I’m really concerned about principles of biology I and principles of chemistry I because I really struggle with sciences and I’ve never taken two at the same time before.
college,fekt5ih,t3_epncr2,1579207069.0,"1) I stay at home with my parents and siblings and they’ve said I can stay at home rent free as long as I’m in school unless I get married before I graduate. We’ve got a pretty good, trusting relationship and I update them with my schedule and where I’ll be in case they need me and in case something happens and they need to know where to look for me. I sometimes stay with friends on days I have early classes since I live about 25 miles from campus and I always let them know so they’re not waiting up for me worried. 

It’s definitely not for everyone as all of my friends have left home — either by choice or not — and even my younger sister moved out as soon as she hit 18 but it works for me and I get to save up for the future. My parents wouldn’t be okay with me partying but since I’m not interested in that it works out fine. 

2) See if you can stay the night at a friend’s before going to a party. That’s all I can think of. I don’t really have any experience with parties and alcohol so I don’t have anything else there. 

3) Clubs, extracurriculars, sports, part-time jobs, volunteer work, study groups, “study groups” as an excuse to hang out with friends, all-night study sessions at the school library, stuff like that. All of those will get you out of the house.

I hope you figure it out."
unpopularopinion,fekqeh8,t3_epoqso,1579205455.0,"I was under the impression that “talking behind your back” was when people were speaking negatively and saying bad things about you when you weren’t around to defend yourselves.

college,fei8t6q,t3_ep67uu,1579132841.0,I was a history major who switched to biology because I decided I wanted to be a doctor and also thought it would help. Has been pretty jarring but will be worth it in the end I think. The important part was to take the core stuff so that I wasn’t wasting any classes.
college,fefkwpw,t3_eotmyj,1579058504.0,Online classes were a lot harder for me because there was a lot more self-discipline involved and you don’t get any lectures usually — some have pre-recorded video lectures. It’s also a lot harder to form study groups. I don’t think there’s any way to get it faster if you can only take so many credit hours. Maybe make sure you’re taking only classes that count? Best of luck to you though.
college,fefjkmr,t3_eow0xd,1579057677.0,"I had that happen too! One semester I made lots of new friends and we were all so close and then everything just fell apart. But people are coming in all the time — freshmen, transfer students, stuff like that — and though it’s a little bit harder when you’re not all in exactly the same boat people do definitely still make friends. You’ll definitely make new friends as you go so don’t give up! Talk to people about the homework, ask them about their lives, stuff like that."
college,fefj6te,t3_eowba1,1579057443.0,I did mine through the financial aid office at my school but it was like registering for classes in that I couldn’t do it mid-semester. That might’ve just been my school though. Definitely ask the financial aid office who you need to talk to for student loans cause that’s usually the place it all goes down.

No idea how that ended for her but she was like 9 or 10 and we ended up moving across the country a month later. We still laugh at her for it though."

When I tried to get them back I ended up chasing them across the room before getting in trouble for running one of the chaperones made me stand outside until the dance was over. So I’m crying, banned from the stupid dance, and my friend finally shows up and gives me back my shoes and is like “wow that was wild dude.”

Also at this dance the chaperones made us do the chicken dance, the electric slide, and some other one I don’t remember anymore before letting us freestyle. For the majority freestyle ended up being hopping up in down in a group. Like a super tight-knit circle of people hopping. Was super weird. Then the shoe thing happened. I don’t understand kids."
