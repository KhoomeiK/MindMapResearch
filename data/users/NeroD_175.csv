depression,feqc06k,t1_feohpeb,1579340007.0,Saying you are not just your brain makes you a complete ignorant to science. People who believe in religion or in a soul just  trick their brain to feel better. They are weak. I am someone who faces reality and tries to make the best out of it. I would never believe in something I have no proof for and trick myself into believing that everything is fine and we aren't just brains that are going to die in a few years.
