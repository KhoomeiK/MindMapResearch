addiction,ffumdpw,t3_euja0t,1580245018.0,"I didn't expect to come here and immediately find what I was looking for, but here it is. I haven't found any useful help for this addiction. I feel like YouTube is a security blanket sometimes. I used to feel like I was learning or being entertained, but now it's just noise. I know I'm feeding an addiction, but unlike my other addictions, this one legit scares me to tackle. Like if I don't have my YouTube friends... ya know. Anyway, I'd love to have a group to talk to about it."
depression,ffqmrsu,t3_euonmr,1580138725.0,"When you live with anxiety and depression, anxiety and depression can become all you think about. It's all consuming. I find that it's one of the only things I really feel comfortable talking about, like it's the only thing I really know and understand intimately. Unfortunately, it isn't conducive to productive conversation."
science,ffql15w,t1_ffqjrl5,1580137462.0,"My hands indicate to the world my level of stress. The more torn and bit up my fingers and knuckles are, the worse I'm feeling. But I don't do it on purpose. I'll scold myself for it, only to find myself doing it again minutes later."
depression,ffqkn4e,t3_eum9vv,1580137171.0,Sometimes just getting that feeling off your chest helps a bit. It helps even more to verbalize it to somebody who will listen.
politics,ffgf7gh,t1_ffgewm5,1579904885.0,"Not that I have seen, the few turds I've seen doing interviews are still saying they're learning nothing new, this is a waste of time, Burisma this and that, oh god we are so fucked."
politics,ffg6c0d,t1_ffg5z50,1579899401.0,"""Dems botched this""? Really? They presented an ironclad case with evidence to back up every claim, and the Republicans are coming out and doing interviews talking about how ""weird"" it is that Hunter Biden was on the board of a foreign company and how it's BORING to listen to I mean come the fuck on."

politics,ffckf4u,t1_ffck1bk,1579801342.0,"My hopes are that Roberts at least puts them in their place. He isn't stupid. And he isn't like them. He listens to cases and weighs evidence in the highest court. He must see what's happening. I hope that he sees what's happening, and even if he isn't able to stop the inevitable, he will at least speak his mind when the time comes."
politics,ffc5kg3,t1_ffc4n29,1579792043.0,"I swear, Adam Schiff explained the whole story in such detail, I don't know what defense they could possibly have. And what's more, to have a real defense, they would have to introduce new evidence, or cross examine the witnesses. They really boxed themselves in here, the Republicans. It doesn't matter because it's completely rigged, but if this were an institution with any merit, the prosecution just laid down, in two days, an undeniable coverup."
politics,ffc486n,t3_eskh1t,1579791137.0,"So, what happens today?"
politics,ff9zk1s,t1_ff9yfm0,1579724856.0,"So would Democrats, though. It would be bipartisan."

depression,ff3wiyd,t1_ff3fvo5,1579550389.0,"It's an inherently human thing. As far as we know, we are the only creatures in the universe who create purpose from nothing. You aren't wrong, but how you frame it matters as well."
explainlikeimfive,ff3vpme,t1_ff3sfsn,1579549884.0,"Hmm, I wonder. Bleach doesn't evaporate like alcohol, and I assume bleach is already diluted a bit. I'm just spitballing though."
politics,fepproj,t1_fepi4ep,1579327234.0,He said he “worshipped him”. Had a “shrine” to him. That sounds exactly like the kind of person Trump would keep close by.

politics,femzoqa,t3_eq1i5o,1579273678.0,"An entire media organization, an entire political party, and a full on cult of supporters. Guys I think this whole thing might be rigged."
politics,femyze1,t1_felziig,1579273193.0,"America elected an internet troll as President. And as most of us here know, it takes a troll to bring down a troll. Many others have tried but had no teeth. Parnas has teeth, and nothing to lose. And receipts. So many fucking receipts.

edit - that being said, proof isn't going to sway anyone these days. This is a cult. I don't know how you sway a cult."

2meirl4meirl,fegk8rm,t1_feg5pvk,1579095292.0,"Same, except it’s work, the whole family is dead or estranged, and hurting myself and others seems to be the way I pass the time these days. I don’t have the patience to play video games myself anymore either so I just watch others do it on YouTube. I expect I’ll be doing this until I die. 

Wait we’re supposed to be reminiscing right now? 2011 was pretty wild. Maybe decades start out strong and just end bad."

depression,fdn8s49,t1_fdmtss6,1578580325.0,">The problem is when you don't want to do anything anymore.

I got to a point where I \*feel\* like I want to do things, but not /really/. I realize my life would be better if I did something with it, and I have ideas about what I might maybe possibly want to do, but the drive to do anything that doesn't provide instant gratification is hardly there. It's a deep, dark hole and nobody really takes it seriously. Not even myself."
