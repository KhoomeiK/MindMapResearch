coolguides,fer5vtq,t1_feqqqpa,1579350231.0,"Not really. All the food products in supermarkets in my country have the metric measurements on them ex: 1L of milk, 1.5L of milk, 300 grams of cheese, 250g of butter etc. So when you want to make a recipe, some ask for the whole standard package or you eye it to put more or less of said ingredients. My mom also has a big measuring cup for different volume ingredients such as ml, sugar, cacao, grams, etc. Mom uses a scale when she makes a big recipe or when she doubles/triples one."
