It seems sad at first, and sometimes I’ll miss opening presents, but it’s also such a relief!

A family member used to not even take the presents with them, and we’d find them under the bed when they left or we all left wherever we were staying.

This wasn’t necessarily for Konmari reasons, but it comes down to the same. 

Clutter or not, sparking joy or not, we just don’t think it makes sense getting people things they don’t want."
