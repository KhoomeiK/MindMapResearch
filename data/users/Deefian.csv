>Grants Atk+3, inflicts Spd-5. Neutralizes ""effective against dragons"" bonuses. If foe's Range = 2, calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res.  
Unit can counterattack regardless of foe's range. Unit attacks twice (even if foe initiates combat). During combat, neutralizes effects that prevent unit's counterattacks, effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks, and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks. If unit's Spd < foe's Spd, reverses Spd calculations.

SubredditDrama,fekg6bn,t1_fek9iwr,1579199360.0,"It probably helps that FE is a way nicer community in general, and I'm saying that as someone who enjoys both the FE and Smash franchises. The Smash scene is so incredibly toxic. Hell, their sub even had to put up a thread that was basically ""don't send threats to Sakurai/the dev team pls"".

Meanwhile, the worst that FE has is the infinite salt mines, and even that is more limited to FEH."
