depression,fe84ovq,t3_eno7v3,1578922529.0,"I can tell you my experience with this, and I can relate to what your saying, and yeah I thought about that as well when I was young, and for most of life I was depressed and growing up with a religious family, they always brought me to church like 6am in the morning... And I tried my best not to sleep or else my grandparents would scold me for doing so, and they would always bring me to church not only on Sundays but whenever they possibly can, but also growing up in a Catholic school for 12 years of my life... And what you are saying is true. When I was depressed I prayed and begged the Lord to make it stop and it did not it led to a point where I was deeply depressed that I begged the Lord to kill me, and yet I'm still here. I'm not a perfect Catholic, I've had my fair share of frustration with Christ, sins that I committed that I am far too ashamed of telling a soul, screaming and yelling why am I like this. And still to this day I still praise God even though my life is shit. When I was young I was molested by my barber when I was in 3rd grade, growing up I never had a father, my family was poor where in some occasions we shared one fish for the 3 of us, I had an abusive drunkard uncle, my mom was out of town so I had to stay with my over religious grandparents, and never had that many friends in school and my junior high years where I was occasionally bullied. But regardless of how much I didn't like it, I worship a God not because of what He does, but who He is. Christ isn't magic where all my problems would get fixed, but He let it happen and I will be honest I hated my life and attempted suicide 4 times because I hated my life and at some point frustrated with the Lord. And yet I'm still here, I finally understood that my life was like this and stopped blaming Jesus or my religion, when my life is again falling apart I tell my self ""God's knocking on my door again"" the moment when you start a relationship with God, automatically there's a bullseye on you, and when a Christian or Catholic says my life is with the Lord, they're liars. That's all it's just a piece of my experience with my religion and God..."

depression,fduxv1m,t3_en5u2f,1578740747.0,"I can't imagine the magnitude of what you are going through right now, it must be overwhelming and I hope you get through what you are going through, I know it seems like everything has fallen apart and nothing could be done, and it feels like all hope is lost... Some people are going through the same thing, it might not be exact, but you're not alone, there are people who are willing to listen to you... I get it, you are seeing what's ahead and what's going to happen...maybe when this pans out, you can restart and be better than before, you might give up hope but hope doesn't give up on you... I wish and pray you the very best, friend."

depression,fdr0qhd,t1_fdqzz7k,1578677879.0,"Damn... What exactly happened? If you like to share that is... It is fine if you don't want to, for privacy's sake"
depression,fdr02h5,t1_fdqzkiu,1578677731.0,"Yeah like you know what is going behind the curtains... Listen, true friends will come, people that listen to you, and understand you, it's good that you shared your experience, and if and when you're feeling down, we are always here for you buddy! ðŸ™‚ Au revoir mon ami"
depression,fdqzkla,t3_emtrlb,1578677433.0,What happened? I know you're not feeling fine ðŸ˜ž
depression,fdqzaou,t3_emtxp1,1578677268.0,"I too hate it when people get your mood down, I understand how you feel... And believe me, the good out weigh the bad, and wow everything else seems to be going well for you, that's awesome! I hope and pray no other troll will do such thing to you again, take care!"
depression,fdqz054,t1_fdqypbt,1578677094.0,"If I can survive, I believe you can too, and don't mind people with negativity, it's not because you're not good enough, but it's because they are not good enough for you... How are you feeling though? Any better now that it is off your chest?"
depression,fdqy2t9,t1_fdqvjc4,1578676531.0,"I have been depressed for nearly 8 years... I had a girlfriend 2 years ago and a bestdriend that u derstood me... But exactly two years ago, they betrayed me, my best friend and her had been doing stuff behind my back, and when the day came, they broke me... They did it while I was in school, they shamed me for everything I did wrong, and left me there to cry and a teacher of mine saw me and he said why I was crying, and I just replied with ""I'm okay""... When I had gf and best friend I thought my depression had ended, but it got worse... For 5 months after that day I was so lonely and I empathize with you, friend, because I know how it feels to be lonely and depressed, you're not alone, time will come where you will have someone with you"
depression,fdqxegg,t3_emt0xm,1578676164.0,"I am amazed by how aware you are about yourself... My friend no one keeping track of what you do, I understand that there was a pressure when people give a suggestion, and you ask yourself ""am I doing things right?"" no one is listing down on your mistakes, and I know it can be hard to see your batch mates and peers get ahead of you, but there is no need to prove to everyone because it might seem they're doing great but they have their own problems, and I am sensitive with my words...there is nothing wrong with you, I suggest that you lay off from social media from time to time, like FB, because people post things there, the things that people want to see and for me when I see my peers going on vacations, posing like celebrities, and showing smiles like they were happy makes me anxious. And then there's me with nothing... I realized that I kept looking around me, seeing all this just made me stressed... And pressured to keep up the pace, I believe you got what it takes, it might not be now, but soon, just keep facing forward, no need to look around, just press on... And when you are feeling weak, don't worry, you can still press on whether you are a weak or strong, no one is keeping track of you except yourself... I wish you the best, friend"
depression,fdqv1lf,t3_emrup3,1578675230.0,"In some sense I know how you feel... I know why it feels like to have depression that has been going on for years, and then one day you find a friend that would become your best friend, and that would person would talk to you, understand you, and all around know you...... But then one day they just left, and at the peak of my depression, I had no one to talk to, about my feelings, no one to listen to my agony... No shoulder to cry to... And I felt this deep dejection and loneliness. Do not worry friend, you do not need people that come back rather people that will stay with you, people that love you and want to see you become better, time will come where you will find a friend that stands with you against the world, I believe in it... Take care"
depression,fdfwa9d,t3_el5bme,1578371931.0,"I'm glad to see you press on when life is kicking back at you, your in good hands... And when you're feeling like you are giving up hope, remember hope does not give up on you... It is good that you shared this, because you are letting it out instead of internalising the feeling, don't ever let it brood it in you, I believe in you, and God will always be with you, He will always guide you through life, I pray and wish you the very best, friend"
depression,fcwj29c,t3_ej7jaz,1578026963.0,"I'm sorry for what you are going through, I guess my best guidance I can give to you is, to surround yourself with people that love you and care for you, take comfort with your friends, a best friend who listens, a friend that is a shoulder to cry on... I understand that in some nights it gets more intense, and that you feel this sense of worthlessness and I am here to tell you that it is not true, I believe you are strong and capable person... It is good that you are expressing this outwards by sharing your experiences, and that is good because you are not keeping it to yourself because it broods inside and leads to depression... And I understand that you mentioned killing yourself... ""better to die and to rest, than to live and made to suffer..."" death has always been an easy escape, I remember pulling the trigger of my gun, and hearing the hammer hit the back of the gun, and a cold shiver went through my whole body, I realised I was still alive... And now I see... Surround yourself with people you trust, people that love you and care for you... And there is nothing wrong with you, like many other such as myself are experiencing the same thing...stay strong friend, I wish you the best..."
depression,fcwhg56,t3_ej7ufv,1578025718.0,"Do not hate yourself, you've done nothing wrong, you're surrounded by negativity, and you mustn't blame yourself for it and what is going on...i understand it must be difficult to live in your situation, and I do not know how much it weighs on you, at least you have someone close to you that knows... Do not give up just yet, I too am awaiting my death but you have come this far and you are strong! I believe you are strong and capable, it is just a shame that you are surrounded by this negativity... There is nothing wrong with you, the circumstances are overwhelming, and you do have someone, your boyfriend, he cares for you and I believe he helps you get through this... Stay strong friend... I wish you the best and hope you get through this"
depression,fcwg84j,t3_ej8899,1578024819.0,"I myself had a hard time figuring things out on what I could do, because the fact is we're gonna die eventually and I also asked my self ""what is it all for"" I've been depressed for nearly 8 years now, and nothing is stopping, and last year was the peak of my depression, that ultimately changed me, and I gave up on my dreams... And it took the death of hope to change the way I saw life... ""what is my purpose?""... And I still remember pulling that trigger, and hearing that hammer hit the back of the gun, and a cold shiver went from head to toe... I was strong enough to end myself, but fear came in after I realised I lived...I couldn't bear it, and after few months after that incident, I told myself ""I have been suffering for far too long now, nothing changed... No amount of advices or encouragements changed my past or my situatuon, and so I said to myself I want to leave something behind before I die, I will die and I have embraced it, now I want to do good, I want to help people avoid becoming like me, because I know how painful it is to live like the way I did... To find meaning in life, in the end it is us who whom we choose to be and who we are for... And yes, life is not easy, it never is... The best you could do is show the world that you are strong... You don't have to work hard for it, you can do it when you're feeling weak, as long as you press on, no one is keeping track... You will find yourself friend, I hope this helps"
depression,fcumkq3,t3_eiz6p4,1577984232.0,"This might sound odd, but the way I started loving myself was when I started being selfish... And I am not a selfish person, but it gave me a perspective of what I want and what will make me happy... Ultimately in the end it made me feel better about myself knowing what I want and what will make me feel happy... I started exploring other things trying to find out what suits me and knew how to take care of myself, and ask yourself often ""what could I do now, that will make me happy?"" it could be anything, just even a tiny bit. As for hobbies do recreational activities that suits you, exercising can boost your self esteem as well as your physique... Find what is best for you and do so, the internet has a lot to show you ðŸ™‚"
depression,fcukfbc,t3_eizq9t,1577982993.0,"Same, I do not know how much this weighs on you, but I believe that you two still talking and keeping good relations is good, I understand break ups are terrible, but at least she is still there, and it looks like you still care and love her the same... And she's not gone, I know it's gonna be hard accepting it, and it will take some time to get used to it, I've been in your situation as well, took me a few months to realise that, she is still there and the only difference is that our relationship downgraded into a friendship, hard for me to see her with somebody else but as time went on I accepted what happened, do not resist because it will brood those feelings inside, instead let it out, because if you keep it inside, it will end in depression, it's good that you shared this, that way you are expressing outwards and not inwards... Hold on friend, you will get through it"
