Engineers,fgup0gk,t3_f0k50e,1581126101.0,"it seems you will get variety and options at OEM. what are your career goals? 

and as to salaries its more than just the pay number:
i just turned down an offer for 150% of my current salary (offer in the 200k region) at a place that, on hearing that i got an external offer, decided to up my pay by ~10% (about 80% of my offer). (basically a retention attempt).  but despite being lower pay they put 10% into my retirement compared to 2% at the offeror. i got 11 more paid vacation days (not that i have time to take them but still, 21 vs 10 is a helluva thing). and they rolled vacay and have to pay it out if i quit (max limit is about 2 months pay). its a very high stress high performance r&d position and i normally bring in and execute on 4 million a year in r&d hence the salaries but the other main reason was i do engineering, bd, management, and research here and i turned down a position that would have pigeon holed me into a pure bd role. also i would have been working remotely with a lot of travel to home location - apparently the irs taxes that reimbursement as earned income!?!?!?! so i would have been taxed at about 30k a year higher than my actual compensation.

tl;dr: 1) will you be pigeon holed at one place and is that cool with you? and 2) pay is one thing compensation is another. are they the same vacation days? are they allowing rollover of vacation. do they pay out vacation if you quite? do they put asside the same retirement. are there other bennies like educational reimbursement?"
