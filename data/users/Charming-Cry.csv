humanresources,ffhiaxu,t3_ergd2h,1579936509.0,Get out of recruitment and into HR or out of HR completely in the next few months.
dubai,fffh71s,t1_fff9t2z,1579883882.0,Hah.
dubai,fffg6l5,t1_fffe490,1579883255.0,Can you be more specific? Have you checked Facebook? Yeah European is not a nationality.
socialanxiety,ffeu509,t3_et8hju,1579865635.0,I'd love to be self employed.
dubai,ffeh369,t1_ffddmn5,1579847744.0,"But, I can't find jobs that actually hire without already having that experience. Which means either an unpaid internship or connections or something."
humanresources,ffcyqy2,t1_ffc40li,1579810035.0,Yes after months of searching one of my candidate's got rejected because he wasn't the right 'fit' or whatever. So he met the requirement's but because of some arbitrary nonsense I have to find some new candidates. I feel theyre under the impression that there are lots of free candidate's looking for jobs in highly specialised areas.
humanresources,ffcy8pb,t3_estpt5,1579809741.0,I started in recruiting \[first hr job ever\] last year and so far I hate it. Sure it's not the worst job but at times I feel like what's being asked of me is unrealistic. I have been given requirement's \[job openings\] where multiple profiles \[candidates\] have been submitted and rejected. If not that then the hiring team takes months and by that time the candidate is busy OR the candidate refuses to sign the contract last minute and sourcing starts from scratch again. The worst one's are where someone is shortlisted but there is a delay in providing the offer letter and everything goes to shit. I keep telling myself it's just my company but it seems to be the nature of the recruitment business. Honestly all this has left me despising HR even though I know it's not all recruitment.
dubai,ffcupxl,t1_ffc96pz,1579807648.0,Yeah but how do you get a digital marketing job? What skills are they looking for?
careerguidance,ffbn2fz,t3_eskoi9,1579773586.0,I wish I could help you. But I'm in the same boat. I'd like to be left alone and the only jobs that allow this are either design or senior positions. Recently I considered going into compensation and benefits or rewards management because it seems good for an introvert. I'm also a comms grad. However after my first marketing job I transitioned into HR. I get short spaces of time alone but otherwise it's just as interactive. I have to be on the phone and in meetings all day all the time. But the HR Manager is in her office with a door. It seems very process based so you get occasions alone. You need to find a career like that.
careerguidance,ff83nrj,t1_ff83f1v,1579665126.0,"It does get easier even if the job sucks. My first month was really sucky. The people weren't friendly, I felt alone and the everything sucked. Now it's a little better 3 months in but I still don't enjoy the work.

I am actually looking to do something like in-house marketing because it seems a little more laid back than recruitment or agency jobs."
careerguidance,ff82syn,t3_es657p,1579664489.0,Can you stick it out for 6 months? I took a job that I didn't like for the money and I'm going to quit after six months irrespective of whether an offer comes or not. I'm not in PR but HR/recruitment. I have the same issues with what they're asking of me. I'm being told to find candidates for very specific requirements without even posting a job ad in about 24 hours.
careerguidance,ff3l837,t1_ff309uz,1579543422.0,Exactly and some are even unpaid ugh. No way I am leaving my full time position for something like that just to enjoy Monday.
introvert,ff3hrry,t3_er9npy,1579541313.0,"Please don't ever do sales or recruitment. Both jobs suck for introverts. 

I am desperately trying to upskill somehow and become a graphic designer or something where I can work without having to deal with cold calling."
humanresources,ff395nu,t3_eq1hxd,1579536624.0,So how's it going?
humanresources,ff387oz,t3_eq5aaz,1579535999.0,"Europe, Hah! Try Middle East, Dubai...it's so different from what I read on this sub. I'm in HR recruitment and we have positions with age, nationality \[majority expat city\], gender \[male/female\] specifications. I have begun to hate HR generally and I'm only 6 months in this profession. I would like to work somewhere else \[Canada\] but it's not the kind of job you can travel around with."
humanresources,ff2o6ea,t1_ff2o0kt,1579515918.0,Yeah my personality isn't suited to HR either. How did you move into consulting?

dubai,fexejs7,t1_fewsne7,1579429710.0,Okay I see. Were you in digital marketing before or were you a total beginner? I was looking into that but getting into DM is not that straightforward.
dubai,fewj0tc,t1_fewhgdu,1579411531.0,"I mostly have experience with the marketing/design side of things like wordpress, basic HTML, Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, AfterEffects, Canva etc. So no real IT programming experience in reality. The bootcamp is for people with no experience."

careerguidance,ferazg2,t3_eq8dfj,1579351829.0,I am 4 months into my first permanent job post college and I want to resign. I keep thinking if it's because of this job or my inexperience in the field.
GradSchool,fepk88a,t3_eq4ks3,1579322657.0,"I found something two months out of grad school and it was great actually. They wanted a master's grad and they had around three rounds of interviews. You can obviously start searching now. But it was easier once I graduated to do the interviews and focus. 

You'll find a job. It takes time. I jumped on this opportunity but I'm not really 100% sure this is something I want to do down the line. I'm just working to not have gaps on my CV and move into something I enjoy more."
GradSchool,feo2b5z,t1_fenh22x,1579294151.0,I did the same thing stayed home for undergrad and moved for postgrad to another country. It was the best. I pulled all nighters regularly. Stayed in the library all night or just hung out with friends more. It was great. Now I'm back home and working. I think I'll move out by the end of the year permanently. It's just better being away from them. They're not the most fun people to have around.

PublicRelations,femfa4e,t1_fedytw3,1579252463.0,I was considering PR but I got a paid job in Human Resources and decided against going down the agency route. Seems like a lot of work for low pay.
dubai,femc9pd,t3_epg101,1579248257.0,Honestly it's hard to find a guy here and I know some people have done it but the transient mentality ruins everything. It's not about numbers as I don't casually date. I'm either with you or not that's it. I find it really difficult to keep the same people around as people leave Dubai every couple of years it's too transient. All relationships kinda suck.

careerguidance,fe3nux8,t1_fe3muy8,1578851187.0,I have an interview with a boutique agency. It's small (8-10 people) they mostly deal with fashion clients. Would the working hours be crazy? Should I still interview with them... I'm nervous. I'm 23 it's a little late to be starting in a new career.
careerguidance,fe3lsb6,t1_fe3l47a,1578850472.0,At least some of them paid you.
careerguidance,fe3loes,t1_fe3ldee,1578850437.0,I see. I am considering a shift into PR from Recruitment/HR. But one is very stable. The other seems interesting but extremely stressful and not very stable.

It's quite messy and disorganized but the pay is good. I am still early 20's so I can do an internship and transition but I am not sure how much time I should give HR before I give up on it completely. I am not sure if I am overreacting.

I have content writing experience but only as an intern. Can I leverage that into a copywriting position? Will a PR role help?
humanresources,fdu69gg,t3_emqjxc,1578728312.0,I absolutely abhor the way most hiring managers act where I work as well. Multiple profiles submitted and no movement whatsoever for months then randomly they try to rush the process because time is running out. Recruitment is broken.

Oh and FYI they mention gender and age too. Specifically to ensure their teams stay male or female dominated. So before you think they're treating you fairly think again they're looking at all sorts of criteria that wouldn't be acceptable in their countries."

humanresources,fcxxkg4,t3_ejh053,1578071893.0,"What did you not like about HR Ops?

I'm in recruiting tying to enter HR so I'm doing the opposite in a way. Recruitment seems very sales focused. Lots of cold calling, advertising jobs, selling companies (depends in-house vs agency) and they seem to take anyone who can sell. The requirements are basically just to be able to fill positions and close deals."
