litrpg,fffihs8,t1_ffeexbu,1579884686.0,"Any idea on everybody loves large chests vol 5? I know it’s a web series but I don’t know much about it, or if there is a plan to release volume 5 on audible or in books?"

Watches,fdabn4q,t1_fdab4qw,1578244203.0,"Well considering this was a complete and total surprise, rather then me hinting at it. Keep hinting I’m sure she will get it.

That’ll get her"

Watches,fd7utr8,t3_ek9wtj,1578210459.0,"Whelp, here is my newest addition to my collection. It’s by far my best piece, and most legit watch I have ever received and owned.

First released in 1953 and built to stand up to the toughest environments, the Oyster Perpetual Explorer and Explorer II models embody the spirit of adventure.

The Explorer’s official story famously takes shape with Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay’s pioneering ascent to Mount Everest in 1953. To commemorate the feat — and to remind people that Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches were worn during that expedition — Rolex released the Oyster Perpetual Explorer that same year.

I’m so thrilled to own this piece now and a gift I won’t soon forget. Very thankful for the generosity. So excited to dive head first into this new hobby/addiction."
