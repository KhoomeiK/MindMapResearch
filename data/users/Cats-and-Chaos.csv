Aquariums,ffafpi4,t1_ffa9wo6,1579734670.0,"So the fish line anchors the islands? Nice! Are the plants live and if so what kind?
How does boiling help the pumice sink and can larger pieces than that work? 

Anyway, such a cool concept!"

He sounds incredibly toxic and while you may “love him” or doesn’t sound as though he’s capable of loving you."
relationship_advice,ff9u2ca,t3_esgfzl,1579721309.0,She doesn’t even respect you enough to tell you the truth. It will be hard at first but you’ll be better off without her.
Aquariums,ff94f3g,t1_ff93fhv,1579704586.0,Looking very much like a birchir
relationship_advice,ff5vc96,t3_errja4,1579611514.0,"I’m so sorry this has happened to you, OP. If you intend to meet and talk to him I’d suggest you do it in a public space such as a coffee shop. I’d also consider having somewhere to go and decompress afterwards such a trusted friends house.
Also remember only HE can make the necessary changes to address this problem. That means he first needs to acknowledge and accept that his behaviour towards you has been abusive. He then needs to make active steps to change and be better. 
Also, his whole ‘if you gave me sex more I wouldn’t have effectively raped you’ rhetoric is abhorrent."

relationship_advice,feylno6,t3_eqtvo8,1579447258.0,"As others have stated you’re a mandatory reporter and have a duty of care towards the student. As the ‘whistleblower’ there may be unfortunate repercussions for you but that does not trump the fact you are obligated to report this and should do so as soon as possible. 
This may sound harsh but you need to put all thoughts of your friendship with ‘Henry’ aside. It’s a really horrible situation for you but you have no choice but to put personal feelings aside.
I agree with those who have advised you contact your union rep. Also be sure to document everything. I’d suggest you ensure all communication regarding this matter is done in written form where possible and that you keep records of everything that is said. If meetings are to occur in person then ask that your union rep accompanies you and that a record of what is discussed is taken if the meeting itself can’t be recorded."
relationship_advice,fews1ui,t3_eqo3so,1579418636.0,"His behaviour is controlling and manipulated. He’s emotionally blackmailing you with “you don’t love me.” Quite frankly it’s appalling and you deserve better, OP."

Aquariums,feehla5,t1_fed1fkq,1579033907.0,I’m not sure but I think the smaller species (like this guy) are fairly common. Could always ask your LFS if they’d consider adding them to their next order?

Nellie was apparently acquainted with Everard Calthrop who patented the guardian angel parachute. I’d need to check but I believe she was involved in testing it."
