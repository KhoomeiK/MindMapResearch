Outside of modern society most humans weren’t that traumatized by corpses either. Until fairly recently people did most of the care of their dead themselves, at home."
dogs,ffi9ofh,t1_ffhrx4h,1579968653.0,I believe the expert recommendation is to only keep puppies indoors if you live somewhere with high parvo infection rates. Otherwise it’s higher risk to miss the critical socialization windows than it is to keep them at home. And you can always keep them in some kind of carrier since parvo isn’t airborne.

Peeing is self reinforcing, like eating and chewing, so when you have a more difficult to house break dog you have to prevent him from peeing inside as much as possible."

The new regs won’t be somehow more lawsuit proof, they won’t come with corporate backbones, so it stands to reason that companies will continue to do nothing and then complain they’re all out of ideas. People who flout the existing rules will flout the new ones, and the only change is disabled people have to jump through extra hoops for no reason."

Especially once kids get to the ambulatory stage, they can be incredibly distressing for dogs of all sizes and temperaments, and distressed dogs can bite. Even dogs that normally like kids and have never bitten anything before can be pushed too far beyond their comfort zone. 

LW’s dog is absolutely hard mode and they have some difficult decisions to make. But people are way too damn lax about dogs and young kids in general. I’m super annoyed with the husband and his mom (or her mom? I forgot) just shrugging that everything will be fine. That’s not how this works dummies."

Alternatively, ignore her first request to go out and get her to settle back down. See what happens, if she bugs you again it might be a real need, but if she goes back to sleep she was fine. Still leash her if you take her out, though, you want midnight bathroom trips to be the most boring thing possible or she will keep asking for them even if she doesn’t really need it."

This works well when your older dog will do that but it isn’t universal. My older dog communicates uninterest by moving away from the other dog, which never discouraged our younger dog. Waiting for the older dog to escalate to nipping just resulted in a rude ass, pushy younger dog that we’re now retraining. 

It doesn’t need to be an either/or situation, it really depends on the specific dogs and what the handler wants. Even if both dogs are fine with their play, maybe I want to redirect them to bring their energy level down."

It’s such a huge topic, you *cannot* adequately cover it in 30ish minutes. I’ve read three books about cultural/societal aspects of pregnancy and childbirth, that’s just scratching the surface.

I was also super irritated that they just sort of casually dismiss policy as being at all relevant. Bullshit. I don’t know if she meant policy in a lawmaking sense or a corporate sense, but bullshit on both. Legal and hospital policy can and does greatly influence how childbirth goes down - ProPublica’s excellent deep dive into maternal mortality rates being just one good example on that topic."

Although tbh it seems like the biggest issue is poor enforcement of existing rules. If airlines (and restaurants, workplaces, etc) had a better understanding their existing rights to ESAs and service dogs being well behaved, and actually started holding a line on that, I wonder how much we would need additional laws.

A designer dog is basically a mixed breed puppy with a so-so breeder (at best), so they’re not predictable like a puppy from a good breeder would be. It’s as much of a crapshoot. 

If there’s a good foster based rescue in your area they might be worth checking out. The dogs are living in homes so their behavior is a lot more analogous to how they will be in your home."

Our older dog is really laid back - we adopted him at around 13 months and aside from some chewing issues initially he adjusted beautifully. The second dog we got as a puppy but it turns out he’s a totally different breed mix than the rescue thought and he is *so needy* with regards to stimulation. He’s 15 months now and commands probably 4 times the amount of work that our first dog did at the same age, just to keep his energy levels manageable."

dogs,ffc6ahi,t1_ffc5kql,1579792530.0,"Don’t get a second dog for his sake. First off, I wouldn’t assume he’s bored during the day just because he doesn’t chew a treat. Lots of dogs sleep when their people aren’t around and are more interested in treats and play when they’re with someone else. And 6 hours is eminently doable for an adult dog. 

Secondly, you can’t safely leave them alone for quite some time, and you really don’t know if you’ll ever be able to. Our younger dog is 15 months or so and still crated during the workday because he is not reliable around the house. You also have no way of knowing if they’ll become friends. Bully breeds in particular are among those breeds that are more dog selective or even dog aggressive.

If he needs more attention or enrichment it should come from you before and after work. There are a million options depending on what he likes to do."
