Except the authoritarianism part, I'd say communist Russia and China still fared better due to a meritocratic politburo over one single individual. Can't say the same for Castro or Tito. 

And now we have an unofficial politburo of retarded individuals and Cabinet positions are only titles, no responsibility. Look at Nirmala not invited for the Budget discussions."
