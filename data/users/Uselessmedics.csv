It disgusts me the way people act like driving is some kind of right and ""oh but I need to drive to work"" or ""it'll be inconvenient"". NO, you don't have a ""right"" to drive, driving is a way to get places conveniently provided you can do so safely, if you cannot drive safely due to a medical condition, mental condition, or just general immaturity you should not be allowed to drive.

Actually what the fuck place is only a 20 day suspension for that? Especially when you've only just got your licence, pretty sure where I live I'd straight up lose my licence if I did that, also why doesn't the suspension come into effect immediately?"
AmItheAsshole,fdu0awl,t1_fdsuh3h,1578725230.0,"I mean where I live you can't get a licence at all until your 18 so it's really not the end of the world, besides driving is a privilege, not a right"

If you want privacy so much, don't buy an xbox, the terms of service allow them to do things like this, and to think they aren't looking at your messages already is naive.

Besides what do you think happens when someone reports a message under the current system?"

AmItheAsshole,fdbrhqy,t1_fd9epge,1578260866.0,"That's actually quite common, not necessarily for babysitting, but often for other business they have what's called a locum house where the new hires live as part of their contract, it's normally a temporary thing while they're on probation and haven't sorted out their own accommodation yet, it's popular in regional areas where it'd be very hard to convince someone to go for a job"
AmItheAsshole,fd1kj16,t3_ejisgf,1578132520.0,"YTA, you left the line so you lost your spot in the queue, that's how that works, just because you were quick doesn't mean you didn't leave the line, the next guy had no idea how long you'd left for or how much longer you were going to be.

Just accept that someone else got their first and get back on with your life"
