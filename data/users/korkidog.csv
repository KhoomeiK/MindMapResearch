ChildrenofMorta,ff33e3k,t1_ff32i6c,1579532648.0,"After you unlock other characters, if you continue to play with one particular character, you’ll develop  ‘corruption fatigue’ and have far less HP. It’s the games way of getting you to use other characters. When you unlock ranged characters like Lucy, it definitely will change your play style. It’s so great!"
ChildrenofMorta,ff2yv3o,t3_erd8h3,1579528996.0,"You’re playing the game right. As you upgrade abilities, you’ll be able to get further and unlock other characters. I found “safe spots” if I got overwhelmed by enemies.  Those rooms that have barriers work well for that. Lead a batch of enemies outside, then step out and gradually finish them. Anyway, that strategy worked well for me."
Chihuahua,ff2spmg,t3_er98zc,1579522513.0,I’m very sorry for your loss. I lost one of my little guys a few months ago. Never forget all the great times you had.

aww,fcypdyp,t3_ejgf12,1578084390.0,"Had something similar happen when I went to pick out a puppy almost 13 years ago, I was sitting in the floor trying to get one of the six puppies to come to me. I’d grab one, but pretty soon it was off with the others. Then one broke away from the rest, crawled into my lap and went to sleep. He chose me and I brought him home. One of the best little guys I’ve ever had."

ChildrenofMorta,fcp4v3y,t3_eichbz,1577850528.0,"Finished the game about a month ago and it’s great. I like choosing different family members and unlocking their skill trees as you progress further and further in the game. If you get stuck at a boss battle, try a different family member and you just may beat them. So much fun!"

ChildrenofMorta,fc3vro0,t3_efyezg,1577399883.0,"I found if I had trouble killing a boss, I’d change family members. Perhaps go from a hand to hand fighter to a ranged family member, providing you have any of them available."
television,fc0dg9h,t3_efgehx,1577287731.0,"Finished the first season last night, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. One episode, I believe it was 3 was a bit confusing, but when I figured out the time jumps it was fine. I look forward to season 2."
