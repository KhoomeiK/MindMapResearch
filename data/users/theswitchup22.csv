Boxing,fdlbr8z,t1_fdl6x9k,1578520640.0,I definitely don’t see Khan as a bum. The dude is a winner. I just felt like he could have been even bigger if he actually fought those 2 years during his prime.

I’m actually working through the book “automate the boring stuff with python” as an intro to python, but am not sure where to go next. Do you recommend any specific book/video? I was thinking a python cookbook or even data analysis with python. What are you thoughts?"

Documentaries,fddwe2p,t1_fddnhrk,1578325612.0,You’re absolutely right and getting downvoted just further proves your point.
Hijabis,fdajbu4,t3_ekfu7f,1578246701.0,"Stop it. Youre absolutely wrong and know what you’re doing. In no way is it a right. There were very specific reasons people had multiple wives and that situation doesn’t not exist in current times. Just because idiots are trying to justify it now doesn’t it make it acceptable in Islam across the board. 

Also, do you think the fundamental cornerstone of Islam is the allowance of multiple wives? And that if you go against this you’re going against Islam?? Remind me which one of the 5 pillars is that? 

Take you’re alligator tears back to your hate sub.  Your actions speaks more about your ideology and how fickle your mental capacity is. 

Idiot."
