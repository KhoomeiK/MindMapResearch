badwomensanatomy,ffxk1t3,t1_ffwb2zt,1580326717.0,HG is treatable but not always manageable. Tell your OBGYN your mother had HG and ask for preventive nausea medication to take if you feel nauseated. Treat nausea at the first sign. Contact the HER foundation or the Hyperemesis Before During and Aftermath foundation if you want or need more information!

Frugal,ffvkevp,t3_ev82qh,1580266196.0,"Have you considered a high quality concentrated castile soap as a replacement for some of the things you are currently using? Dr Bronners is the most well known brand, but Walmart makes their own brand (i have not tested their brand as it has an ingredient I avoid that dr bonners brand does not).  A high quality castile soap can replace MANY of the things you currently use, namely 100% of the soap products you use. It is 15$ for a 32 oz bottle, which on its nose seems more expensive than what you're buying. However, it is EXTREMELY concentrated. Two drops in about four drops water will clean shoulder length hair totally. A few drops will clean your entire body. A dime to nickle sized amount will wash your entire dog. A small squirt will clean the entire floor. It works as a degreaser and basic clenser as long as surfectant isn't needed (your orange cleaner has a surfectant).  A drop on a sponge will do your dishes. You can use it to clean fruits and veggies, you can use it as a pesticide if you ever grow your own foods. A 32oz bottle lasts me an entire year washing myself, a toddler, and a 140lb Mastiff. When i do dishes with it too it lasts slightly less than a year

In fact, most deaf people can and will dance and move to the beat and often can keep time better than those who can hear. Also, not all deaf people are profoundly deaf, though most are. Some deaf people can hear very loud sounds, ie: a concert at full volume sitting next to a speaker. They wouldn't be able to distinguish the sounds, but they could hear tones. The same way some blind people can see patches of color blobs or detect light vs dark."
AskHistorians,ff1seqn,t3_er10jq,1579485137.0,"Yes and no. A branch of our Government did gave seeds from 1838-1923 ( though there were not directly from Congress, they were the compliments of a senator or representative, thus ""congress""). The Patent Office actually started this program, it was transferred to the Department of Agriculture shortly as it proved way too large a burden for the patent office.  It was started because the government realized it had done VERY little to contribute to the agricultural betterment of the country, despite it being one of the main industries of the nation at that time. It was decided that to foster this industry in both farmers and in civilians, this was the best option. They also knew that mass-producing these plants allows for further development of the species and better selective breeding. There was no downside to giving away free seed. However, as the face of the country and those residing within it changed, so did this program. By the 20s, considerably fewer people were planting gardens, mostly due to a change to more city based life with less room to grow things.

Note, that the government still ""gives"" seeds to people who are very poor...EBT, the new name for Food Stamps, covers seeds and food producing plants, as well as food! It just isn't available to every citizen the way this was.

A good [single](https://history.house.gov/Blog/2016/May/5-23-photo-seed-distribution/) source can be found here at the governments own website.

TwoXChromosomes,fev6so0,t3_eqhi8w,1579393783.0,"This is late, but I see you had HG.  Do not feel bad. So, so, so many HG moms have to make this choice and you ARE NOT ALONE. HG is a very serious and life risking disease, and you have a child to consider. You survived literally one of THE WORST things pregnancy has to throw at any woman...in some ways HG is as bad as losing your child (come at me moms, I've lost a newborn as well as pregnancies, and had HG, i am well able to say this in confidence) because you lose your pregnancy, you spend 9 months utterly terrified for you and your childs life. Your body is failing you and your child and docotrs have very little idea on how to treat it...some doctors don't understand the scope or seriousness of HG despite extremely intense evidence and wonderful new studies including a very, very strong genetic finding by UC. And on top of all of that, you know that if you do it again? The same thing is going to happen. You are therefore terrified for life to even have sex...what happens if it happens again? HG often ends with (verified) PTSD in the mother. PPD is more common in HG, as well.

Please. Check out Hyperemisis Before During and the Aftermath on facebook if you haven't and need support. You are really not even close to alone, I promise.

For anyone wondering....HG is a severe, debilitating condition of pregnancy that maintains one of the highest maternal/fetal death rates in the developed world: an astonishing 1:3-1:4 HG pregnancies ends in death (termination, miscarriage, still birth, maternal death) because it is UNMANAGEABLE. It is characterized by extreme nausea and vomiting...not morning sickness, this is 50-200 times a day, violently. You often will vomit blood, you can not keep down enough food or liquid to keep yourself and your fetus alive easily.  It is treatable, but only with some degree of success...not all cases are treated successfully, and many of the second and third line treatments are downright dangerous (such as the use of a central line, an IV that goes all the way to your heart to deliver IV food, called TPN, which is extremely hard on the body and can easily cause a blood infection called sepsis, which is extremely dangerous and often fatal, and the use of anti emetic agents known to have an effect on the fetus such as ativan, a strong benzodiapine) and can result in death themselves. The only way to manage HG will be to cure it through gene therapy, or to find a targeted biologic drug that repairs what the mutated genes causing HG do."
AskHistorians,fetyrua,t3_eql9ft,1579381412.0,"The Crusades happened in the middle ages, and this probably answers your question... at this point, Rome would have been the seat of the Church and condemned anything that wasn't itself. Of course the middle ages lasted a LONG time.
