My mother would tell me she beat me because she loved me. It was her job to make sure I was a upstanding citizen and a good daughter.  Therefore the beatings were my fault because I wasnt doing the right things and I needed correcting. 
That sort if treatment  turns a abused  kid into a abused adult.
I am so grateful that I had people step in and teach me that my mother was the monster, not me.
I am so grateful that I realized that love should never hurt physically,  or mentally. 
Not everyone realizes this and ends up like this young woman.

Again.

This isn't trashy , its tragic."
