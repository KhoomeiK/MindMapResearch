A general area of town where you may find options in your budget that don't really attract students and have a whole ecosystem of amenities away from campus is the North East area (Capital Circle NE & Hermatige up to to Thomasville/Bannerman). Maybe also look at the apartment complex near Buck Lake (across from Costco) or the ones on Miccosukee between the Hospitals, or surrounding the Southwood subdivision."

aww,fg02ty0,t1_ffztpnz,1580398977.0,"I'm no expert but currently teaching my old mutt to put her toys/bones in her toybox...and training is just about breaking the acts down into small actions, rewarding until they understand what you want, not letting them fail for too long (which will make them frustrated - just go back to ask for something they already understand to keep you both motivated), and then linking them with a big command. Assuming you've already established a relationship and some basic commands (sit, stay, watch, etc) so that your dog understands the whole equation of ""I does human request""=noms(and/or)praise(and)heart emojis  
I would first work on the tug action with the rope in hand during play time, then attach a word like 'open' by saying 'good open' when the dog tugs, then attach the rope to the a door (maybe a fridge) and transfer the open from play to a treat (yay!)....do the same with your hand/high five to link the actions of the the door closing, and later move on to working with the can.   


Jeez I just wrote a book because I miss my dog right now."

Tallahassee,fdheqpt,t3_ekj5d0,1578421093.0,"Lots of good suggestions already.

Not sure where you are working, but if you're downtown - Andrew's Downtown (and its associated Rootstock / Capital Grille) are great for after-work people watching in this nicer weather. I would opt to move over to Savour or Il Lusso (both pricey, but delicious) or Harry's (regional chain) if you get hungry and want to stay in the downtown area.

Then take a walk over to College Town/Gaines St (as the name implies, skews to younger but there are nice places there) and I think GreenAnole has you set there...Or ride-share to midtown area for more walkable access to a variety of fun local night stuff. In Midtown Finnegan's Wake is a good start early in the evening for a mixed and social crowd then drop some quarters at Fire Bettys (barcade)or get a cocktail at Fox and Stag around the corner. Grab a seat at the counter for some good grub at KoolBeanz, Izzys, Maria Maria, Sakura, or Liberty and if you're into intimate live music, see if the Blues Tavern has anything going on or just check the vibes at Ology, Waterworks, Brass Tap, Leon Pub (dive), etc in the area.

Enjoy your visit."
