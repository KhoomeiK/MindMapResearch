rpghorrorstories,ffaak6q,t1_ff9y0ph,1579731112.0,"I find that outright disallowing the race just encourages those people to take their crap elsewhere. You let them play the race, but punish them ic and ooc for this bullshit. 

You have Tabaxi NPCs treat them like moronic lunatics who insult their race and society by behaving this way. They question the problem character's reasoning for being such a cracked egg. 

You have other NPCs essentially call the loony bin people to take them away for their insane behavior. Priests attempt to exorcise them or commit them because clearly they're fucked in the head. 

You have your BBEG and their underlings treat the problem character like the funniest, most ridiculous shit ever and tell them so, to their face. The BBEG doesn't even deign to acknowledge them beyond brushing them and their stupid behavior off. 

You make it a persistent persecution enough... and they'll start to pick up the cues. I'm merciless about this kinda idiotic behavior in my games, even the lighter-hearted ones."

dndnext,fdq3s71,t3_embe4v,1578653463.0,"I currently play Verity, a tiefling serving an entity whose very name tells you what it is: Astralaria, The Living Library.

Astralaria is a sentient dimension that loves knowledge and wishes to collect and archive as much written knowledge as possible. It is tye ultimate library and in fact, can link up to any library in the universe. It is True Neutral with *some* leaning towards good as it isn't inherently malicious. It's also something of a ""secretary"" to the distant and indifferent god of stars. 

When it needs to manifest an avatar it appears as a bird-like creature made of a shifting starfield. 

Its served by a multi-plane spanning order or librarians, scholars and scribes called Order Of The Feather. Not all are warlocks. Verity comes from a family that has long served Astralaria. She was chosen by Astralaria as a Talon, a field agents assigned to protect, defend or recover books and other texts from dangerous situations. For that purpose she was given a literal talon of the entity, which becomes a sword, making her a Hexblade. She's currently in Barovia, doing her best in the face of adversity... and possibly about to turn into a werewolf."

- No meds of that sort.

- GM and players have indeed helped as much as they can, problem is I was the one with the most excruciatingly detailed notes...

She is going to become the same kind of unholy terror Strahd is, but fueled by righteous (in her eyes) rage and bent on his destruction because she's fed up with the cycle and Strahd. Even if she dies, she's rising as a revenant or wraith to carry on the obsession with destroying Strahd. The PCs might go from allies to unwitting instigators and enablers of something far nastier than Strahd.
