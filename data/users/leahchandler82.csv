AmItheAsshole,ffd7zid,t3_esupuo,1579815192.0,"Absolutely NTA. Her reaction is further proof that she hasn’t changed at all. You should not feel the slightest bit guilty about not accepting her apology. You don’t exist just to make her feel better about being a complete nightmare of a human being. She has a lot more learning to do in life, clearly."
AmItheAsshole,ff5k6dq,t3_erijgn,1579596767.0,What in the actual fuck. Your sister is heinous. I hope she sees this post and reads every single thread. Even then she wouldn’t scratch the service of understanding what an absolute and utter piece of shit she is for doing this. Good lord OP. NTA. Cash out and get the hell out of dodge.

RealEstate,ff1zoow,t3_er5k26,1579489954.0,I agree with others who have suggested inserting a better tub/ shower combo. An updated bathroom will create added value (regardless of what you end up deciding) but being a one bedroom you’re already fishing in a smaller pond of potential buyers. By removing the tub as well it could further affect who your home appeals to. I think installing a nice tub and shower will be your best bet and safest option in terms of ROI down the road. This is what I would tell my client if they asked me my opinion on the matter.
vancouver,fewuor7,t3_eqk1kc,1579419767.0,Omg this is amazing! Thanks for the PSA
AmItheAsshole,femb5b8,t3_epovf1,1579246813.0,"YTA. If your lease is good until June, your lease is good until June (at least this is true where I live). Yes, the new buyers could try and strike a deal with you to move early, but you wouldn’t be obligated to do so. The seller shouldn’t be forced to keep the home just to make you happy - come on man. Who knows their reasons for selling either. The new owners will have to honour your lease so chill out. Furthermore, maybe the new owner is looking for an investment property and you’re being TA for nothing.  Grow up."
ChoosingBeggars,feht6ls,t1_feh4a1u,1579123378.0,"Yup came here to say this too. Absolutely take this to small claims. It seems like a pretty open and shut case and you’ll not only recoup the cost of replacing the iPad but will also get confirmation that you haven’t done anything wrong here. Plus on a very petty level, it’ll be a giant FU to their entitlement."
dogs,fehrg2g,t3_ep5jpm,1579122397.0,The saving grace with animals is that they don’t think about death the same way we do and so Emily isn’t worried about how many days left she may have. In the end all she will know is that she is loved. Sending lots of love to you during this heartbreaking time. Deciding when an animals life ends is truly a heavy burden - I struggled with this when we put our cat down 7 years ago. It’s gut wrenching.  Maybe you would feel more comfortable if your vet could come to your house instead of bringing her in? It might make this a bit more bearable on you to have her pass away in familiar surroundings. Whatever you decide will be enough. Wishing you strength during this heartbreaking time.
AmItheAsshole,fdxbfxe,t3_en6jau,1578767177.0,"NTA. You are absolutely doing the right thing and thank you for taking her to task for her terrible behaviour. As someone who was bullied in school I can attest to how isolating and hurtful the words and actions of my classmates could be. She needs to learn that actions have consequences and hopefully from having so much taken away from her, she will realize how much she stole from the girl she bullied. Kudos to you and your wife."

PoliticalHumor,fdplbj3,t3_emlr5v,1578631809.0,Iranian citizens were on the plane but it was not an Iranian airliner. I‘d delete this post and save yourself further embarrassment.
AmItheAsshole,fdpkd07,t3_emlrqp,1578631016.0,"NTA. I think in the chaos of the moment you recognized a shitty situation and were probably shocked at the audacity B had to demand such a thing from you.  I can imagine having done the same thing. In hindsight, since she has consistently displayed a disinterest in being a mom, maybe it would have been better to take the child in and then call the grandparents.  But OP, don’t beat yourself up at all.  You made the best decision you could in that moment. Perhaps you can call CPS and tell them your story so they can make a record of it on her file."
awfuleverything,fdnivbj,t3_embrkb,1578586735.0,Can we believe David? He’s usually full of shit.
AmItheAsshole,fdmnzm0,t3_em35ua,1578557436.0,"NTA. Also it’s funny to read about your cat’s change in personality after the shave. We got our cat shaved last summer and instantly she was calmer, less annoying and generally seemed happier. Strange that a hair cut could change their behaviour so much. We will be doing it again this summer! Also, the lack of hair balls was a bonus."

RealEstate,fcc4t7t,t1_fcbuv8q,1577594417.0,"In Canada there is realtor.ca. We don’t have fully automatic housing values the way Zillow provides for homes in the US, but you can see what housing prices are in Canada based on available properties. Real estate is local and you really do need to get in touch with agents that know the community and local market you’re interested in."
