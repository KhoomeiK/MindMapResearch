""Incentive"" is a more correct word.  Motivation is something that occurs if the incentives are good.  But yeah, what you posted is pretty much spot on.  Most of these companies provide incentives for you to do okay enough for no one really to pay attention to you so you can stay gainfully employed.  Many of us have done the ""Busting our ass"" and have realized it doesn't gain us anything.  Raises are the same size (if at all) and all it ever seems to do is increase the expectation of your output.

The house was basically built right up next to the property line in a corner with most of the yard on one side and the front.  The back and one side was barely wider than a saw-horse (important later detail) between the house and fence.

When I got past the side yard and into the back there was a saw-horse blocking the path.  It had been there for ages.  I clamored up onto it with both feet (standing) and went to jump off and slipped.  I then fell into fresh snow and my left arm started hurting really badly.  Couldn't even move it.  Turns out I broke my elbow by falling into fresh fluffy snow at a distance of no more than 3ish feet.  Since this was a tiny town, my mother had to drive me like 40 miles to a town with a hospital on a winding mountain'ish road with fresh snow on it in a beater ford station wagon.

worldnews,fdeugjr,t1_fdeu5wr,1578346845.0,"In some states yes.  In many no.  It is on a state-by-state basis for a federal election.  Goes to show how big of a cluster fuck our system really is.

Voting should be convenient, and have absolutely no possible penalty for the citizens."
AskReddit,fdettis,t1_fddl7uq,1578346464.0,"Really depends on the job.  There are some jobs that absolutely make no sense to work the 8-5 hours.  (9-5 was something that kinda ended in the 80's and is not typically accurate for most jobs now.  Keep in mind people worked 7 hours with a paid lunch... now you work 8 hours with an unpaid lunch.)

Back on topic.  There are plenty of jobs that are ""response based"" meaning you have work to do contingent on some condition being met.  This is anything from being a sales clerk to an IT admin.  Those types of jobs must have someone readily available at all times so it makes sense having the warm body there even if they don't always have something to do.

Other jobs that are more ""production"" based and either have an end-goal or a target number and if your portion of the job can be completed without direct input from others... there really is no need to have a set schedule at all just a deadline."
worldnews,fdetbzq,t1_fdd69xr,1578346175.0,"Yep, something along those lines.  Hell, even a ""half day"".  Something that allows everyone an opportunity to vote with no concern of paying their bills due to the missed time."
worldnews,fdet5au,t1_fddkf1d,1578346066.0,"I get you.  I was specifically speaking to things like the Iraq ""war"".  We invaded them under false pretenses and spent quite literally trillions.  So basically the (R) party defrauded Americans of trillions of dollars... yet none of those clowns went to prison.  Nope, instead they just got rich."
worldnews,fdesxk5,t1_fddlk8b,1578345938.0,"Yep, that would also ""mostly"" work.  

Notice I got down voted.  Love it.  Because you know.. ppl should have to chose between being able to vote in a democracy and being able to keep food on their table and a roof over their head.  Great system this."
worldnews,fdd0bpq,t1_fdctc9s,1578289814.0,"Yep, voting day should be a forced paid national holiday."
worldnews,fdd07wg,t1_fdckraw,1578289711.0,"I am still of the mind that Iraq was solely to place 2 land fronts (sandwich) in Iran which was the real target.  (R) just ran out of time because the ""wars"" became unpopular then a (D) was elected."

news,fdcz1sj,t1_fdahj13,1578288598.0,I avoid Walmart except when I can't.  Sometimes they are the only one open that for sure carries something that I need immediately.  This Christmas I bought a one of those new Xbox's off them cause they were the only one with the game package the kids wanted.  Couldn't find it anywhere else (maybe it was exclusive to them.. dunno).
pics,fdcyp0c,t1_fdbkqit,1578288273.0,There is a gal I used to work with from Ireland but she married a guy in the states and lived here.  We would be in these big con calls together and any time someone with a thick irish accent would start talking she would immediately revert and now there were two people I could barely understand :)
AskReddit,fdcus89,t1_fdbfeuv,1578284908.0,"Yep, that is me also.  I'll start buying one a draw once it busts 500m.  Buying 1 ticket gives me infinitely more chances of winning and allows me to dream for a couple days."

worldnews,fdcturk,t1_fdciavo,1578284153.0,That seems like a hard way to do a number that simple.  I would go with 10x6 + 7x6.  Pretty much everyone has learned 0-10 x 0-10.  And the least amount of sums you need to maintain in the old noggin the higher your chances of being accurate.
worldpolitics,fdct9c8,t1_fdcesj5,1578283672.0,"Yep, they have been maneuvering to attack Iran shortly after we attacked afghanistan.  WMD's anyone?  Yeah, those panned out.  But it sure put us on 2 land fronts vs Iran."
