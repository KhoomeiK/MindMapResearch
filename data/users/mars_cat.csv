offmychest,ffap9xl,t3_esh79n,1579741294.0,"Not sure how much this will help, but petsitting helped me keep some money in the bank while I was between jobs. It's generally pretty easy to manage even if you have other jobs and responsibilities. I advertised on Facebook and the Next Door app and got some repeat business. It won't pull you out of debt but can help ensure you have food and gas."
AskReddit,ffaodim,t3_eskb75,1579740689.0,Did the work that I put into improving myself today pay off? Am I happy?
AskReddit,ffao4ng,t3_esj11g,1579740523.0,"Indirect insult but it still stung:

I was in line for a book signing when I was around 17 years old, the peak of my insecurity. Some guy within a few years of my age asked if he could cut in front of me because he had another event to get to shortly after. I wasn't in a rush so I said sure.

Not even a full minute later, in full view of me, he turns to the hot girl behind me and asks if she wants to cut in front of him!

I should have enjoyed getting my books signed by one of my favorite childhood authors that day but instead retreated further into self consciousness and used that incident to ""prove"" to myself that I was dumb, ugly, and worthless."
MeatlessMealPrep,ffancws,t1_ffakoic,1579740003.0,"Thanks! They're super easy. I can usually prep the bread, veggies, and hummus in the time it takes to boil the eggs. Feel free to mix it up with some other veggies as well. I've also used bell pepper, cucumbers, broccoli, and cherry tomatoes"
MeatlessMealPrep,ff5wyb5,t1_ff5d4u9,1579613012.0,"I'd never actually calculated the calories until now, but going through the ingredients it looks like about 270 caloroes/box.

I usually eat it as a whole meal for lunch, but my husband will eat them as a meal or as a snack"
MeatlessMealPrep,ff5wkdf,t1_ff580dg,1579612654.0,"I mean, eggs are a byproduct but not actually meat since they don't contain the flesh of an animal or require an animal to die for human consumption. They're not vegan, which is why I didn't post it in a vegan sub, but I've seen eggs posted here before. 

If you wanted to adapt the recipe to be completely vegan, just replace the egg with a handful of nuts. 

Edit: added more info to comment"
MeatlessMealPrep,ff3yhzy,t1_ff3x732,1579551624.0,"Because when I've done it without separating it from the veggies, the bread will start getting moldy from moisture after a few days. I wash and reuse my zip lock bags to minimize cost and plastic waste even when I do have to use them"
MeatlessMealPrep,ff3sqbk,t1_ff3psda,1579548035.0,"I have several different ""lunchable"" rotations for each week. One of our other common ones is sliced cheese, triacuits (usually garlic and herb), apples, and a scoop of peanut butter.

I remember seeing the Starbucks snack boxes one week after making that box and being happy about how much less it cost for me to just make my own!"
MeatlessMealPrep,ff3sjqx,t1_ff3qjtn,1579547924.0,We just got a family sized tub of Sabra garlic hummus. A family sized tub gives me exactly ten scoops
MeatlessMealPrep,ff3pslq,t1_ff3liqv,1579546237.0,"Thanks! They're easy to make (took be about 20 minutes to make all of them), inexpensive (under $2.50/box),and they're one of my husband's favorite meals. Win-win-win!"
MeatlessMealPrep,ff3cukv,t3_erfo6b,1579538611.0,"Each box has 1/2 pita (cut into triangles), 1/2 stick of celery, 5 baby carrots, a scoop of hummus, and a hard boiled egg.

You could easily leave out or replace the egg to make it fully vegan!"
mentalhealth,ff1ws19,t3_eqy0sy,1579487958.0,"You should strive to be patient and understanding as long as they're willing to recognize and willing to work on their toxic traits. You are not responsible for someone else's wellbeing. My husband if very patient with my mental health issues, but part of the reason he's willing to be patient is because I'm actively working toward change and improvement."

offmychest,fen7jh9,t3_eq0mo8,1579278688.0,"Often this is done to try to prevent people from applying. Employers will already have a preferred candidate in mind but are required to post a competitive search so they'll say something like ""Entry level research, requires Ph. D and 5 years experience. $12.50/hour"". No entry level worker will actually have those qualifications and anyone with those qualifications won't want to apply for an entry level $12.50/hr job."

hearthstone,fe9vtei,t1_fe9re34,1578941860.0,"My husband is much more of a gamer than I am and had tried me on several games, some of which I've taken to well and some of which haven't interested me. He got me into HS, Monster Hunter World (which he wasn't expecting me to get into because I'm very much a beginner with console gaming), and Smash Bros on the Switch.

Edit: said PC when I meant console"
hearthstone,fe9r4xq,t3_eo4wgs,1578940767.0,Never played WoW. I got into HS because my then-boyfriend (now husband) was playing it regularly and I wanted to be more engaged with his interests. We have very different play styles and deck preferences but we still play together nearly 4 years later.
mentalhealth,fdwnm4g,t3_en8sa3,1578760549.0,"Something that's helped me reduce self harm is holding ice cubes firmly in my hands when I get the urge. It triggers a pain response without actually causing harm to myself. Usually by the time the ice melts, my hands hurt and the urge to do anything more has passed."
AskReddit,fd2tyot,t3_ejuqlz,1578151629.0,"My fiance, best friend, and I vandalized a sidewalk.

Someone had painted a swastika on the sidewalk and I had to walk past it every day on my way to work. It ruined my morning every day and the city didn't do anything about it. When complaining about it to mh best friend and fiance, we came up with a plan to spray paint a 4 leaf clover over it.

None of us had ever done spray paint before so it looked more like an ugly blob than anything, but it was better than the swastika! My best friend actually told this story to over 70 people during a toast at our wedding a few days ago, if that gives you any idea of how little we regret our act of justified vandalism."

mentalhealth,fcfrpvr,t3_eh3le2,1577633117.0,"Getting started on self improvement is the hardest part. If this has sparked a fire to get you motivated to start, use it! But once you've found a rhythm and routine that you can maintain, then work on shifting your focus from revenge to self care."
offmychest,fc0h7kz,t3_effutk,1577290773.0,"Based on your previous comments, and the advice from the doctor, you did the right thing. The right thing isn't always the easy thing or the thing that feels best. It sounds like an awful and scary situation for everyone involved, but you prevented a woman you care about from hurting herself. You had valid reason to be concerned for her safety. I hope you can all recover and move forward together. Sending good thoughts your way"
mentalhealth,fbuiudn,t3_eekvjm,1577115143.0,"I switched from zoloft to welbutrin in high school while I wasn't sexually active, but I've been on it while I'm sexual relationships and it hasn't acted as a libido suppressor for me.

The biggest thing I noticed in thr switch was that I was able to lose weight again. On Zoloft I gained about 15lbs and even with a strict low calorie/high exercise regimine I was barely able to maintain my weight. When I switched, I didn't instantly start shedding weight but I was able to lose weight again when I tried."
