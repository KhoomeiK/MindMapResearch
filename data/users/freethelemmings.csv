There is only about a 72 hour window right before ovulation within each cycle where there is the greatest chance of getting pregnant. This typically occurs in the middle of the cycle, but there are physical signs, such as body temp, discharge is similar to that of an egg white, as well as the presence of luteinizing hormone in your urine."
bulletjournal,fe6ogqx,t1_fe5k1er,1578898153.0,"Exactly! The act of doing it is more important than it looking amazing. Besides, you'll likely have time to try different creative things here and there, and as long as you're not tied to it turning out amazing, if you're like me, you'll still feel like you've accomplished something, and take some pride in what you did. And that's who it's for anyway, amiright?"

bulletjournal,fe4bjjv,t3_enr1r8,1578857611.0,"I'm also not artistic, and I literally started bullet Journaling 3 days ago, but I'm super optimistic about the value bujo will add to my life. I've really just resolved to not get caught up with the aesthetics too much.

So far I've played around with an art deco typography, and design. Both aren't terribly dependent on being a great artist, really just keeping a consistent ratio between what I was trying to draw, and what fell out on the paper. I've also just done a little bit of hexagonal designs that are super easy, but add a little flair to the page.

Are you familiar with the phrase, don't let perfection get in the way of progress?"

MTB,fcuvyj3,t1_fcuju96,1577989644.0,"Actually, I've found the opposite to be true for long rides - clipless pedals have a float, which varies, but is usually somewhere between 2 and 5 degrees of twisting movement. This gives my knees the ability to vary where stress is being put on them.

With flat pedals, I ride 5 Tens, and so my foot is practically glued to the platform. I've noticed on a couple long rides that my knees really start to hurt after a bit."

GalaxyS6,cqpiqr0,t1_cqhyz8u,1430081188.0,"Yeah, the folks in store that I've talked to suggested excluding their 4G network until a fix can be pushed. Customer care on Twitter said about as much as well. 
I did end up exchanging my phone, and no more auto rotation issues. However, I've seen a couple new things with my new phone (le sigh). 
A bunch of my apps were missing from my home screens when I woke up this morning (I would guess that at least 30 dropped off the screen and out of folders). Also, my edge clock is set up, but the screen is not entirely off (hard to describe, but I'll try). 
It's the difference between the phone being off, and the phone displaying a black background. The latter is a really dark gray with a slight glow. 
Cheese and rice. "
