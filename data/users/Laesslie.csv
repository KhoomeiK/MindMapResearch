Usually, when someone says harmful things, you tell them so why make an exception for religion ?

""If you genuinely believe God exists as described in the Bible, what is your remedy?""
If you genuinely believe that every woman that doesn't hide her face deserves to be stoned to death, what is your remedy ? Therapy and education
If you genuinely believe that black people are inferior to white people, what is your remedy ? Education.
If you genuinely believe that emotional manipulation is okay because that's how your god behaves, what is your remedy ? Therapy and education and since it's hard to change the abuser, we can at least say publicly to help victims get out of this and AT LEAST, not make things worse saying we should ""respect these beliefs"".


I don't understand why you think some behaviors are okay just because ""well these people really believe it's real and okay so what is your remedy ? You wouldn't say that what they believe is wrong, would you ?""

You are speaking to me like these beliefs are somewhat okay, that since it's a belief, we should all respect it, never criticize it and never ask people to question them when they have consequences on the way they treat other people (and with *other people*, I include their children). We shouldn't educate people, we shouldn't help people that are hurt by these beliefs.

I don't have a problem with christians that use religion as some kind of spirituality and understand what is wrong and right with their beliefs because usually, their faith doesn't have many consequences on others.. I have, however, a problem with brainwashing and I don't understand why you are trying to make it into something non negative at all and something we shouldn't criticize because ""It's a belief""

""They believe it really happened"" isn't an argument. It's a fact, a terrible one actually. 

If you live in fear of a god that will come for you just for stepping out of line one time, you're bainwashed and you can be extremely dangerous for both yourself and others. I'm talking about emotional abuse here, in case you were preparing to say that ""they are not violent towards others"" 

I have sympathy for some of these brainwashed christians because I know they are victims of a system but that doesn't mean I think their beliefs is okay and that we should all ""respect"" these beliefs because these beliefs have consequences on the way you treat others and yourself.

Geez, you sound like this lady in a government that didn't do anything about a sect where children died because their parents never took them to the doctor  because of their beliefs. She was talking about how the parents ""really believed that it was what was right to do so.... We have to respect their beliefs because they are good people wanting the best for their children, you know"". 

It's maybe time they become responsible and put the wellbeing of others (especially those they have power upon) above their beliefs.
I'm merely asking for individual responsibility, a thing you apparently think christians should not have.

As long as they don't hurt themselves or others, there is no problem. Problem is, that these beliefs will usually make you hurt yourself or others. And not killing, not hitting and not raping isn't ""not harming"" as emotional manipulation is a terrible thing.

If THEY can't question it themselves because of the emotional background these beliefs have then WE at least can question them and say it's not okay."
facepalm,ff8u0is,t1_ff8s5j4,1579696040.0,"That makes them even worse actually. It means they don't care at all about the consequences that happens to victims and don't care about humans at all.

It still makes them hypocrites since they are asking us to have sympathy for them because THEY suffered but don't show any sympathy for their god's victims.

If what happens to the victim isn't important since when it's God that does it's acceptable, why should we have any sympathy for what happened to them ? Remember how what happens to the victim doesn't really matter ?
They say we should have sympathy because they suffered, not because ""romans didn't have the right to do so"". So when it concerns them, their suffering is important but when it's another victim, it's not important since it's God's will.

If God gets away with making people suffer, it means someone's suffering isn't important so why is THEIR suffering suddenly important ?

You can't say you're against sin but worship the being that is the most sinning. That's like worshipping a rapist that tells you not to rape and saying you're against rape while perfectly accepting that this rapist rapes because.. well, he's the one that created all Of us including the rapists whom he lets rape because he values the free will of the rapist more than the dignity of their victim AND then say he is against rape. 
If God is so different that we can't judge him, then we shouldn't even say he's loving, good and benevolent  because saying something is positive is already judging it. If you can't judge something, you can't say if it's bad or even good. 
What they doing is pure favoritism, which is hypocritical.

The very fact they worship this kind of god makes them hypocrite. They're hypocrites because they judge God by saying he is benevolent but say we can't say anything negative because ""we can't judge god""."
facepalm,ff8py0k,t1_ff8pm7n,1579691070.0,"Dude, just take a loooooong look at my post where I wrote that ""every system has its problems"", showing you that I absolutely know that.
I don""t remember saying that religion was ""the greatest threat in the world"". I just said that there is a problem with christians not wanting to acknowledge the negative in their religion, hence aggravating a problem that is already there. There is then absolutely no need to tell me that ""X is a greater danger that Y"" since, as you can see, I already know that 

Also, the ""This thing is more terrible so you should stop talking about this already terrible thing"" argument is absolutely stupid. If you were talking about the terrible things americans do and I would come telling you that you should take a loooong look at what China does and stop psychoting on americans, wouldn't you think I'm stupid ?

We're talking about religion here so I'm going to talk about religion and what it does. If you don't want people talking religion on a religion topic, do not come on a religipn topic.

Not everyone that is pointing out the problems in a system and saying it's terrible is ""psychoting"". 
If we were talking about ""what are the most terrible threats in the world"", I wouldn't talk about religion. 

Stop psychoting on me, will ya ?"
facepalm,ff8phvg,t1_ff8ozp9,1579690430.0,"You're the only one here speaking about sentencing people to death. They're not to be sentences to death since they're not terrorists but they are part of the problem when they say that terrorists have absolutely nothing to do with Islam. Terrorists are not terrorists just because of Islam since absolutely anyone can become a terrorist for anything. However, saying it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with Islam in this context is just wrong. It has LITTLE to do with Islam but it still has.

Nuances are important in this world. 
Just because you're part of the problem doesn't mean that you're guilty of all of it. The same goes for the other way : just because you're not the worst of your system (a terrorist, a pedophile, etc.) doesn't mean that you're not part of the problem AT ALL.

Do not put words in my mouth. I extremely clearly said that all christians weren't pedophiles so why would I treat muslims like they are terrorists ?
Also, I said that EVERY system has its problems but that what makes religion a bad system is the fact a lot of its members do not want to acknowledge the problems in it, hence encouraging abusers to abuse and victims to shut up and accept everything."
facepalm,ff8mnds,t1_ff8mbz3,1579686127.0,"I didn't say christians killed egyptians. I said that god killed egyptians (although the way I wrote it makes it confusing, I agree).

I meant that that very fact christians accept that it's okay that innocents are killed just to teach one guy a lesson makes them immediately hypocrites when they cry about innocent christians killed by romans. 

I wanted to show the lack of empathy they have for other victims of massacre when they ask everyone to pity them.

Also, yes, there are deaths that are nicer than others. Massacre usually means that it will be extremely rough and cruel."
facepalm,ff8l2df,t1_ff8g92w,1579683682.0,"As long as you accept the bad christians are bad because of their beliefs like you think the good christians are good because of their beliefs and thus, accept that there IS bad in your beliefs, there is litterally no problem. 

People are tired of this ""They are not real -Insert social group"" bullshit who is just a technic used to deny problems that are present in your social group. Why do you think abuse victims are so mad when you say this sentence to them ? Because you don't actually acknowledge the abuse they suffered from which is more than just what the abuser did to them. 

You can't say that religion is good because ""look at these good christians that make good things"" and NOT say that religion is bad when a christian does something wrong in the name of their belief.

For every idea in the world that can be good, there is a dark side. 
For example, Christianity encourages people to forgive and it works as long as people treat each other decently. 
It becomes a terrible thing when people are abused by others because it makes the victim :
1) Forgive their abusers for every abuse and never leave them.
2) feel guilty when they don't forgive.
3) developp a pride for ""handling all of this and being such a good person"" when, in fact, they hate themselves and this pride at being a good slave is the only pride they can have. You know, like these women that become terrible mothers because being a mother is the only thing they were told they could be.
4) It makes the people around the victim judge/discourage the victim when they begin to rebel against their abuser.

The ""God if Love"" thing can be harmful because it teaches people that ""love"" excuses absolutely everything, something abusive parents use as an excuse. For litterally every comment about someone explaining the abuse they suffered from their parent, I saw a christian explaining to them how ""their parents do it for their own good because they love them""... 
Yes, you, a good person, will never treat your child that way. But you will prevent victims from defending themselves and healing themselves by constantly defending your belief that ""God is right because is loves us"" which defends the idea that anything is acceptable as long as the person that does it ""loves us"". 

Focusing on the good in people is a really great thing as long as the person in question isn't doing any harm to others. 

THIS alone is something that is linked with religion itself and that justifies the critics you receive. This alone makes religion in itself dangerous and harmful, whether christians are good people or not.
Being 'loving and kind' isn't enough when you encourage a system and doesn't want to acknowledge the bad in it. 
Every system has its own problems and harmful things but what makes a system better than the other isn't the lack of bad things but rather how you deal with them, something christians don't do since ""well... they're not real christians and we treat others normally so the problem isn't our beliefs""...


Not every christians is a pedophile but you'll all be accomplices as long as you encourage their victims to forgive and not be angry. You'll be an accomplice as long as you shame people for divorcing. You'll be an accomplice as long as you'll believe that love makes you automatically a good person.

You'll be an accomplice as long as you will not acknowledge the bad in your beliefs and as long as the sentence ""They're not real christians"" will be in your mouth."
facepalm,ff8jqv7,t1_ff8hjyo,1579681736.0,"The Roman Empire didn't even oppress Christians that much. Actually, it was more Christians belittling others for having multiple Gods while romans accepted the christian god as being ""the christians' god"" just like they accepted Appolo to be ""the musicians' god"".

Romans were faaaar more tolerant of the christian's god than Christians were of the multiple gods. Christians need to accept that Christianity was a SECT during that time that caused a lot of trouble and that wasn't even oppressed for a very long period. Of course, it doesn't excuse the massacres that occured where innocents were roughly killed just for being born in a christian family but just playing the victim like they were persecuted during an era where they were the ones making trouble is downrights pathetic.

Also, it's funny how all the christian rules never apply to them. If you're taken prisoner, you're supposed to just accept to be treated like a slave and obey, but strangely, not when you're a christians enslaved by a non-christian. We're supposed to nicely accept that we can't have what others have because it would be sinning but strangely, christians can cry about how  they were ""persecuted"" during the roman era. 
Killing innocent egyptians is okay because god wanted to ""teach Pharaoh a lesson and show his political authority"" but killing innocent christians to ""teach christians a lesson and show them your  political authority"" isn't

So everyone has to accept their shitty situation as long as christians are the ones in power but when you inverse everything, it's suddenly persecution."
facepalm,ff2ojuj,t1_ff2n4y3,1579516489.0,"Brainwashed is a strong word that implies a lot more things than just ""being stripped out of your individuality in one specific environment during a specific period"". A beaten up wife is brainwashed, a child-soldier is brainwashed, a slave is brainwashed, a fondamentalist is brainwashed.
A brainwashed person will find an excuse for every behaviour their brainwasher will have just to avoid questioning it because they have nothing else. A brainwashed person lack common sense and lucidity for everything that concerns their brainwasher ans of course lack empathy for every victim that suffer because of their brainwasher, including themselves.

Nobody said you were brainwashed. People are merely saying that the army uses technics to strip people out of their individuality.

The fact you don't notice it isn't the only argument for it to exist (otherwise, it would be a lazy argument, like you said, just like saying the devil exists because it's greatest trick was to make us believe he doesn't exist.....)
But it's as lazy as saying ""It doesn't exist because I, myself alone, didn't notice it"" when, in fact, manipulation can't work well with you noticing it just like cooking can't work without food.

It exists because we can notice the tactics used by the army that ARE tactics used to strip people out of their individuality. Uniforms, group punishments, everyone shouting the same things at the same time, everyone walking at the same time, etc. 
It exists and the fact you don't notice it just means that it worked well on you, that's all.

The fact you were feeling good in the army is actually more of an argument for it stripping you out of your individuality than the opposit.
We love it when we have no individuality.

It's really strange how you don't seem to want to even acknowledge that and keep on using this ""not all armies are the same"" excuse. It's litterally how the concept of army works. It's litterally how group dynamics work.
If you weren't at some point stripped from your individuality, it means you weren't in an army at all to begin with. It even means you weren't in a group.
The only difference you will see between armies is how much of your individuality is taken.

That you think that god is above you isn't different from an atheist hurting others in the name of justice or any other concept you could find. 
Litterally EVERYONE do things in the name of something, a value or a god. 
If believers do not think they are the final authority for humans since it's god, neither do the atheists because they do things in the name of concept or greatest good.
Hitler did  his terrible things because of ""greatest good"" just like any dictator. He didn't do it because he ""wanted power and thought he was better than everyone else"".  It's a pretty naive and childish way of seeing things.

Also, I hope you accept that any human you hurt has every right to judge you. 
That's the problem I'm talking about : the fact that since you think ""only god can judge you"" and that ""only god matters in the end"", it will lead to you not caring at all about the consequences your actions have on HUMANS and hurting others without caring how they feel.

Also, the moment you call someone ""insane"" is the moment you show you do not have any understanding of their psyche. 
People do not become terrible because of ""insanity"". They become terrible people because they think they are doing what is right and stop caring about the consequences of their actions.
It's a thing that religion sometimes causes since believing in a god would lead you to think you are always right as long as you follow what your god says and that you don't have to worry about the consequences your actions have on any humans since ""God decided that so it's okay to abuse others and it's not really abuse since it's God's plan and God is love so he can't be abusive"" 
Btw, what I just quoted, the whole thing about ""love"", is a very common manipulative trick abusive people use : It makes the victim not only think they are not really victims of abuse and make them feel guilty for not ""appreciating"" the love of their parent/god/spouse/etc. enough.
