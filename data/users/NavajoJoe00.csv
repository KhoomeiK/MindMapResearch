""Between alcohol and food, I always choose alcohol"" is something he always added to his stories of the past. My masaní and cheíí both passed away because of alcoholism shortly before he met my mom. After dating for awhile my mom gave the same ultimatum: drinking or her. He gave up on it but had a couple of slip ups along the way. 

Talking to other relatives, apparently my dad was a mean drunk. He'd get into knock out drag out fights and has a bunch of scars. He now looks like a Navajo dwarf all short with a beer gut and an I-will-end-you stare, but will joke and tease if he likes you. Dude had an industrial oven blow up on him and looked like nothing happened a week later. Except his eyebrows took a little longer to come in. You go Mr. Downey, healing for love"

I get mild panic attacks driving through them. Pulling over and just sitting in the woods helps. I think it a perspective thing between being in a car vs walking around. Reverse prairie sickness I guess but so worth being in an old forest
