StockMarket,ffhyl6h,t3_etky9g,1579959402.0,"I learned a lot using investopia.com and youtube If I'm being honest. 

However, when cruising social media as a new investor, take caution over trading vs investing. I see a lot of newcomers get lured into the world of trading without any experience in the stock market, but see a lot of flashy traders on social media with robinhood accounts making thousands of dollars on trades. More times than not, if you don't have the knowledge and risk threshold, it comes down to gambling away your money."
TooAfraidToAsk,ffhq9pa,t3_etl02h,1579948165.0,"It’s difficult to feel superior when I look around and see (Appalachia) our infrastructure and grid is crumbling, our roads look like the surface of the moon, kids on the verge of diabetes, and parents even more sickly. I’ve experienced 8 suicides at my place of employment, have lost 3 friends to suicide last year alone, and overdoses are weekly some months. Healthcare is god awful in my area, while being incredibly expensive. Our only dentist office that has been updated since the 70s is Aspen Dental, which is predatory. People can’t afford to maintain their aging homes and get condemned frequently, and house fires are everywhere. One freezing rain storm in January can mean no electricity for a week, and places with ISPs pay an arm and a leg for internet, while people on the other side of the state still have dial up. Despite me and my partner making more than double the median household income for my area (which is around 35k), her student loans are insane, and to get ahead of them gives us increasingly less spending power to enjoy our young adult lives and save. 

It’s really just the suicides and heroin that really depress me. Rural regions are always a “developed” country, so whatever. But, to watch so many good people silently suffer until they kill themselves, day after day, is disheartening, and I can’t really believe this is normal."

weedstocks,fff3s5k,t1_fff00e9,1579874931.0,"That’s not at all an example of socialism, but an example of the Keynesian economic model adopted by much of Western Europe and eventually FDR. Again, it would behoove you to understand the difference. Socialism is not merely government intervention alone, nor has to be. Much of western society is as such, through lobbying efforts, that by and large, government intervention is in favor of the short sightedness of corporate institutions, hence the term “trickle down economics.” The 2008 recession is no different than Nixon inviting China to the UN, giving a green light to American business to go to China, Reagan attacking unions while cutting taxes for the rich, Clinton signing nafta that green lighted business to move to Mexico, bush invading Iraq to expand the military industrial complex/funneling tax dollars to private enterprises, Obama funneling your income into the hands of private insurers, and trump giving nearly 30 billion dollars to agriculture/cutting taxes while adding deficit spending and increasing the national budget. It’s government being curtailed by business in some mystical hope that labor will reap the benefit. That is not socialism, nor is that social democracy. Know the difference.

edit: also in reference to FDR's New Deal, you absolutely are missing the context for the time period. If you had an understanding of American history, you would understand why the New Deal happened. It is easy to critique the New Deal 90 years later, however, if you think this country is divided now, you should really read into the labor movements and fascist fervor within the United States post collapse of the Classical Liberal period. Hence why FDR arrogantly claimed to have ""saved capitalism"" with the New Deal."
weedstocks,ffexc18,t1_ffescqb,1579869278.0,"It would behoove you to read more into Venezuela, and why their economy collapsed. I think it’s blind devotion that is most bizarre. An economy such as ours, that has the might of most economies combined, is still susceptible to collapse, as it nearly did in 2008, gives little merit to the “but Venezuela!” Do you blame the Great Depression and 2008 recession on capitalism? To disallow yourself to hold any criticisms of economic practices, while blindly devoting yourself to powerful institutions is how this country has gotten to where it is. Frankly, I can’t think of anything less American than blind devotion to hierarchy."
weedstocks,ffetkbf,t1_ffet53r,1579864878.0,"That is objectively what Bernie is doing. Plain and simple. His strategy for ""reforming"" an economy such as ours, as a leftist reformist, is not through socialist means, but a mixed economy. Which rationally, I guess, makes sense to a Democratic Socialist, being how we have a huge reach by corporate America. It's important when being an informed voter, and a participant of the electorate, to have some basic understanding of political theory. 

As far as a Trump vs Bernie election, it would be interesting indeed."
weedstocks,ffet27j,t1_ffeszc7,1579864194.0,"Exactly, that is the entire point. He is presenting social democratic policies similar to the nordic model. That is why he is not presenting socialist policies.

for clarity government taxing the rich and giving everyone welfare is not socialism"
weedstocks,ffesguy,t1_ffeqszh,1579863362.0,"Democratic Socialism is an ideology to reform capitalism towards workers owning the means of production through democratic means, as oppose to revolutionary means. It was a very popular ideology during the labor movements, and once again during the civil rights movement (MLK was a Democratic Socialist), as it is rooted in an effort by the grassroot labor striker/civil rights advocate to peacefully transition society towards giving power to labor (""Power To the People"").

Bernie's strategy is very much what one would expect a reformist take in the United States, being that our ""left"" is merely ""center right"" and our ""progressive left"" within our center right party are mostly keynesian liberals (which is conflated with Social Democracy, however, is very much not). That strategy is purely Social Democratic policies, similar to Nordic countries, especially post ww2. Since our society is moving aggressively towards a corporate society, forcing taxation on concentrated wealth, and using that taxation to invest in labor/common people, in theory creates a mutual benefit towards both business and labor, as business will have a healthy, mentally sound, housed, and educated labor force and labor wont bring the guillotine to the ivory tower to kill the wealthy (which has happened in the past) as they are healthy, mentally sound, housed, and educated. 

However, I think there is merit to the thought process that everything will have to collapse. Liberalism of local economies have eroded greatly, as small town America to the Burbs rely heavily on corporate America for basic services, where those same services would have been provided by your local economy a hundred years prior. Meaning a handful of people living on the west coast, who hide their money in the Caribbean, can control the economy of a small town in Pennsylvania, that relies on Dollar Generals, Walmart, Amazon warehouses, McDonalds, and aspen dentals for jobs."
