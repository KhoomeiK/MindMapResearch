SuicideWatch,fe5v81f,t3_envjqq,1578875701.0,"Hi, sometimes our mind play tricks on us and we are very judgemental towards ourselves. But sometimes the facts maybe different. For example, I'm sure many read what u wrote and care because we all messed up badly at one point or more in our life, but don't know how to encourage u. Point is, our assumption may not always correct especially in stressful situation. 

Please don't cut urself :("
intj,fdzlakx,t3_ena9gg,1578791276.0,"Not sure if this is apply to every intjs, but two who I know can only perform a short time of small talks, soon they can't hold themselves to ask meaningful questions and if the conversation is boring, seek a way out (by telling u they hv other plans to do), no, they won't stay to make everyone happy. Lol."

As an infj, being understood is a huge thing and my intj is a good listener also mature. The only downside is we think too similar sometimes, it can feel like talking to urself."

SuicideWatch,fdf7k2k,t1_fdcramb,1578355135.0,"I heard some people call themselves a gender neutral. Basically genders are boxes and I know it must be not easy to not be able to get into those boxes because society make it. 

I hope slowly u can find comfort being yourself no matter what boxes available right now, because how we shape our life, share love with people around us and enjoy our time while being here is the most important things. 

Give it some time, if you can't find out what box u should in, make one for urself."

mentalhealth,fd5ueja,t3_ejztno,1578181625.0,"Hello there, a good friend of mine seems suffer the same thing. He is such a sweet person and I don't hv many close friends so he means a lot to me. We talked almost everyday and he has been much happier since then. He is smart but because of his depression, he couldn't do much. I always tell him to not compare himself to others, that he means so much for ppl around him because of his gentle, loving character. 

I hope I don't lose him to the depression, I believe some ppl love u too, tho idk how to help, but I wish u being strong and find many happiness in ur life."

SuicideWatch,fcvwdmx,t3_ej0da1,1578011602.0,"Hi, As a woman, honestly I don't think that is the most important. It has some importance but women can also easily enjoy themselves with their toys. 

Pls don't lose hope right now because u might meet a woman who loves you as a whole and she's been looking for someone like u. There are many types of women, u only need to find who works out with u and be loving to urself. Afterall, when we get older, companionship, laughs and supports are the things that truly meaningful."

intj,fcms3pc,t3_efczs9,1577789516.0,"My husband diagnosed with autism. But he is highly autistic which seems normal from the outside, he has a good job, friends, etc, but once I lived with him, he started showing his autistic side. We barely communicate, he always plays computer game and our conversation is only about dinner. It's a very lonely marriage.

But I didn't blame him coz he also didn't know he is autistic. He admitted that he tried very hard to communicate when we were still in the dating phase but never really need it. And he can only mask to do that for so long. The doctor said he won't change, I should just accept it.

Being far away from home, only know my husband and realized I made a wrong decision made me very disappointed in myself. This is the most difficult part I guess. I like being calculated and this decision has changed my life in a big way. Well, I didn't want to suicide, but there was a period I couldn't see my future. All my plans were ruined. 

So I asked myself do I wanna live or die, and the answer is I want to live. Then I started to make plans. I worked on my mindset and I despise the fear of divorce, the fear of having no stable income I used to have, the judgement of family and friends because being a widow in my home country earn a bad jugdement. Nevertheless I made the decision, I will make my life as I want it to be.

I have many things I wanna try, I'm going to uni again because I'm interested in a different field now, while slowly making the new business. But I'm glad with all my life experience so far, without all this pain, I might not understand how to be truly happy as I do right now. 

For me, there's no point of looking back, it's all been said and done, and I have made best decision I could atm. Time will only move forward. I wish u a happy new year and a joy in ur heart!"
intj,fclpqts,t3_eh616c,1577753486.0,"Hi, how about you figure out how u want a guy to treat u, what kind of relationship you want, no matter if he is intj or not. Goodluck in everything u decide and hv a nice day!"
intj,fc6fjrm,t1_fc2de5t,1577479381.0,"I think the part of self-reflection is very INTJs thing. I like that about INTJs. I have two close INTJs friends and they are some of my favourite people coz I find they are funny, interesting and asking meaningful questions.

In short, my business has to be closed due to my decision to get married and moved to another country. Later in the marriage, my husband was diagnosed with a mental condition which I couldn't cope. That leads me into the depression for around six months. 

In my depression, I noticed, I never truly happy, I was always worried what if this and that, I never felt the peace stayed inside of me for a long period. My mental state seemed to depend on the situation which can change because of many unpredictable factors. I will be prone to depression if I keep doing this pattern, I thought to myself. 

I found my happiness in my lowest point because I'm fed up being unhappy. If I don't want to commit suicide, I'm gonna live my life being happy. Therefore I made the commitment that night and I never change it since. It's been six months later now, I still constantly feel joyful most of my time. 

By the way, do you feel miserable in your own company because your mind created many thoughts that don't help you feel good about your life and yourself? if that's the case maybe it's worth to try to be picky with your mind and only entertain thoughts that are useful for you. I think our brain is a wild kind of stuff, it will create so many thoughts, some of it is beautiful, useful, and uplifting, some is just like rubbish and meh. 

Heyy I think u r inspiring too, that's why I want to react to ur post, it must be hard in ur situation but u don't give up. I hope u had a nice day!"
intj,fc1pyxo,t3_efczs9,1577326040.0,"Hi there, sorry to hear about ur depression. I think it's admirable that u still go to gym etc and make improvements in the way you can. 

Im not an INTJ, but INFJ. I guess it doesn't really matter if it's about depression. I don't know about some ppl who hv it because of their brain chemicals are just different, but it seems ur depression is because life doesn't go as you plan. 

I myself experienced depression some time ago, I made a decision about my life that made me lose my company and my marriage just fallen apart around the same time. But when I was in the lowest point, I found my happiness. 

This is sounds clichÃ©, but I will give it a shot. The secret is being decisive. I decided to be happy no matter what. I asked myself, do I want to spend my life being happy or in misery? I made my answer and adjust everything accordingly. 
Because being happy makes me able to do many things, as the opposite of being depressed. 

For example, I don't listen sad songs coz It makes me sad. I don't recall my past often coz it makes me sad. Many ppl say they want happiness but their actions are not aligned. 

Up till now, some things works out for me, some don't. But nevertheless, I made my decision to feel happy as long as I can breathe. I don't second question my decision coz I can feel the benefit of that decision. Sometimes I can feel sad too. But only for one or two hours. But it's rare nowadays. 

Sorry for my bad English. I hope u find ur way through."
intj,fc1ej89,t3_eflx09,1577316386.0,"Hi I'm an INFJ with a high T. I got test result as  an INTJ too, but it didn't make sense coz my bestie is an INTJ and I know my pattern of thinking just different from her. Until one my INTP friend mentioned that I probably an INFJ. Took some tests and got INFJ few times. Other results remained INTJ. 

 And I know I'm an INFJ coz since I was young I had this feeling I hv to contribute in a large scale for humankind. That's so confusing for me coz I'm just another girl. Like, who am I anyway. Lol. Sounds funny but INFJs born as catalyst. Or hv desire to be so. So that kinda makes sense in that way. 

What I observe is, my INTJ bestie can put herself first easily and simply won't sacrifice anything easily while it's natural for me to put others before myself. Which sometimes I don't realize coz it's just as natural as breathing. 

She has a trust issue especially towards strangers, while I tend to look ppl from their bright side. I notice their negative sides, but I just prefer to see what's good left from them. 

On handling arguments, I can easily cry if it's with my close relationship, family, love ones, best friends. She is way more articulate and never cries during argument. It's like she has separate compartments for emotions and logic. 

She is way more rigid with her short term planning, while I can be more flexible with unexpected hurdles. She believes careful planning is the key for success. She can be very annoyed if something interfere her planning. 

She puts her pride into being competent and look up for ppl who can demonstrate a high competency. I put my pride being dependable which is very people oriented. We both hv our own company but we hv very different leadership styles. 

A guy I'm seeing also an INTJ and possesses similar characteristics with my bestie."
intj,fbweoq2,t3_eeezoo,1577147943.0,"Hi Infj F here, currently I'm dating an Intj M. We have just known each other for roughly 6 months, and I really like him for who he is. 

After he broke up from his 7 yrs gf, he waited till 2 yrs before he met me. He wouldn't compromise his values and very picky, not because he thinks he is perfect, just because he wouldn't even want to start a relationship where he couldn't foresee the future with the girl. Although there was a girl showed interest towards him. His reason simply didn't want to waste anyone's time. 

What I can say is, as INFJ, once I met him, I feel like meeting someone who is very similar in mind. We both are future oriented and support each other's goal. We care about each other well-being, mentally, physically. Honestly I hv never met someone who are willing to meet my effort half way like he did and he feels the same way. 

Another thing I like is efficiency, we don't do small talks and both of us can just be honest if our topic was boring and choose to do something else that is productive. Time is the most valuable thing so we both respect that mutually. I like him coz he is mature and interesting. Many times his opinion was unexpected for me, opened up a new (logical) perspective and he finds me caring, lovely yet decisive. 

Sorry for my long rant, to sum up, infj-intj pair works in my case."
