landscaping,fepq9y3,t3_eq970v,1579327691.0,"I‚Äôm guessing since your renting this spot you don‚Äôt want to drop 10k on it. I would dig out a path going from the steps maybe 4 feet wide that‚Äôll go from the stairs over to the gravel patch. Get some 4x4s and some giant stakes. Use those as borders. And then fill walk way with gravel. The 4x4s will keep the gravel in place so it will get compacted which will make it Lil more pleasant to walk on and not slip under people‚Äôs feet. If you go this route definitely get some weed barrier fabric. The good shit though. So not from Home Depot. Wherever you get gravel, mulch in bulk. A landscaping supply store.

landscaping,felzcd8,t3_epv7fy,1579234871.0,It looks like that is a high volume clay ground. Clay is awful for drainage and offers minimal nutrients for the grass. If your really wanting grass you would have to remove that clay about 6 inches down and replace it with a 6 inches of good quality topsoil.

lawncare,fecjtlp,t3_eod61w,1578975649.0,Yeah you‚Äôre def going to wait to get some fresh top soil and pest moss. That‚Äôs the bare basics of planting new grass. Im not sure if this is the up to date pictures but I would consider rototilling the ground. Your going to lose the grass that has grown but tbh for the long term it‚Äôs in your best interest. Grass isn‚Äôt like a weed it can be little finicky. Especially when your starting from just seed. If you don‚Äôt have nutrient rich soil and the ground is compacted you‚Äôre not going to have a high percentage of grass that‚Äôs going to take.
