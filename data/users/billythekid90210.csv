depression,fecyze8,t3_eogck0,1578990501.0,"I beat the shit out of my bed today. I know exactly what you mean. I used to wallow in self pity. But now I just want to hit stuff, and stuff hurts your hands when you hit it. For paranoid legal reasons, I feel compelled to say I NEVER have bad thoughts about myself. Never. Ever. Never. Neeeeeeeeeeeeever. Not even once. Not even just now. Not this afternoon as I took a walk and felt violent. Nope. Not me."
SuicideWatch,fecyq3c,t1_fecvl6y,1578990164.0,"Your feelings are natural and valid, and your situation serious. BUT, you have the power to turn this into a good thing in the end. Things are probably going to suck, and I'm sorry that they will. I don't know what will happen, but I know that you are a good person and even though you're feeling scared you are stronger than anyone knows. You will overcome this."
SuicideWatch,fecwt68,t3_eohwxg,1578987772.0,"I'm not going to address the important thing here.  


All I have to say is that this is extremely well-written, from the title to the sign-off. Excellent writing. I'm legitimately impressed."
SuicideWatch,fecwjxs,t3_eo9ex3,1578987470.0,"I think genetics definitely play a role, because your genes are the story of your body, including your brain. I knew a girl who had multiple men in her family commit suicide, even when they firsthand knew the effect it would have on the rest of the family. Everyone has a different genetic inheritance and sometimes you get shafted. But there are ways to turn every disadvantage into an advantage."
SuicideWatch,fecwcgq,t3_eof0ba,1578987222.0,"100% agree. Everyone is busy with their own lives. Even when you say ""I need you, I'm mentally REALLY FUCKING unwell"" they won't take you serious until something real happens. It's like everyone has a ""thats never REALLY gonna happen, they just being dramatic"" shield that always up until something real happens. People often don't choose to help until the last possible moment, or too late. It feels bad. I want to blame runaway capitalism for making people money-seeking sheep, or something, idk."
SuicideWatch,fecvsd0,t3_eoc598,1578986583.0,"When I think of my death, I imagine fading out in a hospital room. I have a loved one nearby, but because my body is shutting down, I flicker between recognizing them and total confusion. During recognition, I try to say I love them, but I am no longer capable of speech. Then it's just a slow fade of trying to remember that I wanted to say ""I love you"". Then, trying to remember that I was trying to remember. Eventually, just being perceiving light and being confused by it. There nothing left worth noting at that point.

It's my deepest fear.   


I DO feel like I'm destined for Alzheimer's or cancer. A slow withering death where I lose everything."
SuicideWatch,fecvjat,t1_fecu3jk,1578986301.0,I'm also going to eat your cat. I'm so sorry.
SuicideWatch,fecv7tt,t3_eohsjj,1578985939.0,"It's that shitty feeling where you see all the ugliness in side yourself, right? Like ""who's hands are these?"" ""Who's messed-up brain is this?"" ""Surely, this isn't me! I'm going to wake up or someone is going to come bail me out at any minute."" But it doesn't happen, it's real, and the shame is intense. I know that feeling. I get this.

You don't deserve to die. There's no point in lying or pretending. Yes, you made a mistake that hurt yourself and others, but dying would be the same mistake, amplified!

You are worthy of your life! You made a mess, but you can choose to move forward, even if you have to do it slowly. You can still learn from this and salvage your life! Future you will thank you for choosing life. And it will be so beautiful."
SuicideWatch,fecuhpa,t1_fecu3jk,1578985113.0,"Yeah, the more you need your friends, the further they pull away right? because they don't know how to help/are scared/don't want to commit."
