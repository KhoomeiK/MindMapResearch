Where the difference between rulership and leadership comes in is when that person starts using the other four as human shields between themselves and danger, you can't just remove a ruler from their position.

What's stopping them now? Dictators are installed by Western powers pretty reliably by utilizing the power endowed to them by the hierarchies that exist. They'd have a lot harder time if they didn't possess a monopoly on violence. There's no incentive to keep producing ridiculous weapons, either, since there's no profit motivation anymore, either.

>If the bulk of society organizes to put down those groups, how is that different from the state asserting its power

The state isn't the bulk of society, usually. It's the ruling class. So there's a major difference between a bottom-up, democratic use of violence and a top-down, authoritarian use of violence.

Nothing is completely insulated from corruption, and that's not the point I'm trying to make. A decentralized community is going to be much harder to corrupt, though. There can still be peace-keeping forces and militaries, but they function on a voluntary and democratic basis. Leaders are elected and can be removed democratically, and their authority is ad-hoc, they don't have rights over the people under their leadership. A private can slap a general for getting out of line.

Simply put, you remove the mechanisms that promote power."
politics,fdd26fd,t1_fdcohg7,1578291806.0,"There's no monopoly on violence by the state and, for a lot of variations, no currency.

If someone wants to play dictator, there's no police force or military to stop the populace from forcibly removing that person from their position of leadership. They may have loyalists, but they wouldn't be any better equipped than the general populace.

This is not to say it's a perfect solution, but there isn't one. The purpose is harm reduction."
