todayilearned,ff6y9jl,t1_ff6wbp9,1579637361.0,">you can type word for word the title of a post and not get any results.

That's not true at all lmao, unless you mean you're searching the ENTIRE title and the search engine is truncating something that's creating a mismatch? 

The ""exact match'"" thing is actually THE (main) problem with reddit search engine, it ONLY searches for exact matches. There are a few extra search features, but one of the biggest issues with the design of the search engine is that it doesn't do anything to help with misspellings, synonyms, etc. That's a big reason Google seems so good comparatively. If you are searching reddit and misspell something, or misremember a word in the title, even though the rest of the words match, it won't give you results.

Another issue with searching on reddit is that many posts are titles something barely related to the content. Like, a gif of some cool science experiment might just be titled ""this blew my mind..."", so when you're trying to remember it a few weeks later to show a friend and search reddit for ""color changing science experiment"", you won't find anything, because none of those words are in the actual title, and even if all of them but one were, your searching that one word that isn't would exclude that post from the results.

As a tip, you can use Google and add ""site:reddit.com"" (no quotes) to the search, that almost always works as you'd expect a search engine to.

All of that is to say that, doing that in this case didn't return any more results."
