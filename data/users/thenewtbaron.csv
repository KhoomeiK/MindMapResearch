The actual final ""tests"" would probably be making your own intoxicant for use at a service - has to be something that you can legally make in the USA(Or wherever you are) - usually beer, wine, mead, weed. There would then be sexual performance while giving the day's teaching at the previously mentioned service - this can be sex performed with a willing individual, masturbation(of whatever variety), could be bondage performed upon you or a willing individual by you.

""Hello Children. I am here to talk to you about Consensual sex. First off, you do not have to have sex unless you want to, and making that choice is not bad or wrong, either way.  But we are here to talk to you about how to make safe and healthy decisions. Are you ready for sex? well, that question is up to you but you maybe pressured by others and let me tell you, they are assholes. .. Let me tell you about sexual diseases, there are ones that can be gotten rid of, some that will stay around for your entire life but may not be a big deal... while some are big deals such as babies... here is birth control, here is how to use it, here are the side effects and problems.""

""our next topic is Intoxicants. At your age, you should not really be using intoxicants because they can have a negative effect on your growing body but we know you may try some so let's give you some information. First off, consistent and regular use of intoxicants can be a symptom of depression or other mental health issues, if you have to escape your life/reality or whatever on the regular, you may need help, and there is nothing wrong with that. Next, never drive or do anything that may endanger your life or the lives of others while you are intoxicated. Find a time and a place to partake, such as when you don't have a lot of work or an important test, and with trusted friends in the woods camping, or such. Weed/Marijuana is generally safe if you get it from reputable sources, the biggest issue will be if someone panics, trust me, anxiety can be peaking with some of the strains because of their chemistry or by the sheer strength of the strain... so remember to breath, get a glass of cold water, and try to talk with your friends about what you are feeling or perhaps distract yourself with a fun show or music. Remember to take it slow, let the drugs work, give it time. You don't want to jump straight to the redline because you can sometimes go beyond the redline and you won't have a fun time. Now, we will talk about some of the drugs you should not use to get high, Opioids, don't do them, they can easily get you addicted and they do have the potential to kill you very easily, generally stay away from crack, crack cocaine, cocaine, meth. We generally tell people to stick to weed and alcohol but some experimentation is fine. but be safe.

now, I want to thank you for time, I will answer some questions if there are any but I hope to see you at services once you have become 18 to 21(depending on how you wish to join)."

automaton is a mechanical device the just performs actions mechanically. it can do the same things over and over again, it can be programmed to do more and that programming can be complex but the general idea is that it cannot make decisions itself.

robot originally meant synthetic/artificial human in RUR, the play that first coined the term but we changed it to be basically a more advanced automaton.

drone started off as the worker units in a bee hive, a small part that doesn't control the whole but acts as a group.  that is why individual borg are called drone.

cyborg is a part human and part machine that can be used from a modern human with a pacemaker or mechanical limbs, it could be a robo-cop(brain in a machine) or like the borg.

android is a robot that is dressed like a human.

Cylon is a specific universe's version of robot but in the original they were the species that created the robots, the robots killed them off and took their name but they did make an android. In the new series they had the robotic versions and completely synthetic humans.

AI is just artificial intelligence. intelligence is the main part there, they are thinking machines, it is what puts them separate from an automaton. AI can also exist independent of a specific bit of machine.

Synthetic can just be a term used to described as something not ""natural""... a lifeform that didn't crawl up the evolutionary tract but ones that were put there by their creators.

We also do not know if the mechanical androids(if there are any) are any different than Data. He didn't become a ""lifeform"" in any appreciable way until years and years of existing, the same for the doctor. So, perhaps they are the baby lifeform of androids, without experience. Maybe they have had parts of the code erased or bits removed... once again, things we have seen from both the doctor and data."

Android seems to indicate mechanical parts and no rights of being a lifeform. as the poster stated, ""artificial"" may hold a negative connotation, e.g. fake. 

then, you rambled on about star trek not using ""nuke"" but another form of much more destructive bomb/weapon is bad... but star trek is a world where ""project Genesis"" exists, where nanorobots exist, where torpedoes exist that go beyond fusion/fission and go straight to matter/anti-matter. so, yes, why would star trek stop at nukes and not go to a bomb that can uses nanobots to destroy larger chunks of the livability of a planet.

Then you ramble on that they should use robot rather than ""ai controlled drones"". dude.  do you just call all cars/trucks/suvs and the like just ""automobiles""? probably not, people and language tries to use descriptions that are useful. To give a fun example, is the enterprise a robot? If Data is driving the enterprise, would you just call that a ""robot""? no, and why is that? Because it isn't a good description, useful to the situation.

You see ships coming in. are they carrying lifeforms, payload or both? A drone would indicate that it would probably be payload. ok, is there a pilot on-board, are they being flown-by-future-wire, are they ballistic(shot and no changes to the direction), are they going off rudimentary computer control with limited capabilities, are they flown by an on-board robot, are they being flown by a computer system.

Now, Data does point out that there is a difference between android and robot BUT Scotty did call Data a Synthetic commander. Bashir even called Data a synthetic lifeform

perhaps calling an individual ""synthetic lifeform"" is a term to allow a being to have certain rights as a lifeform rather than an android. Bashir calling Data a synthetic lifeform could mean that Bashir recognizes that Data is just more than a computer in a human suit, that maybe Data is sentient and an actual life form.

dndnext,ffdqe9x,t1_ffdhi9q,1579826440.0,"I'd argue that a low level priest being able to protect one person for 10 day by using 10 minutes and an action isn't horrible because no undead horde is going to try to grab like 6 people and the horde isn't going to sit back and let the priest have time to do that anyway.

no matter how large the church is, they are not going to be able to pump out priests fast enough to protect everyone, even if they are  able to give a full week's or ten day's worth of protection. this is because you still have to ship them around to various places, keep them guarded and even if the priest is able to protect everyone but they aren't able to hold the town/city or whatever, the undead can kill them all, grab the protected bodies and drag them back to wait until the spell wears off. 10 days isn't that different than 7, if no one is around to guard and protect the dead.

I was taking your idea of multicasts and putting it in a fashion that would work better with more standard spells.at first level you can protect one person for 10 days, if you upcast it you can get longer days or more people. the way I am thinking of it is that a higher level priest should be able to protect more people, like a level 20 dude should be able to protect everyone in a good distance.

I do agree with the fire and forget problem the issue I have is that the cleric is using resources to complete a task. in a ritual, it is time which is sometimes a very limited resource... or a spell slot which is a very limited resource in most days.

the issue I have with making the spell a higher level spell is that there are much better spells by that point... and if the person is just going to be cremated/needs to be cremated.

anyway, gentle repose is a 2nd level spell and clerics don't get that until 3rd level. so, if we up that to a 3rd level spell, that is a 5th level cleric and at that point they can make circles to keep all undead out, revivify or destroy 1/2 cr undead. 4th level is pretty low on spells but you don't get that until you become a 7th level cleric. and if you put this at 5th level spells, you have hallow, which lets you make every thing dead within a 60 ft radius not be turned into undead and undead can't enter it.. gentle repose is a far below that. and a 5th level spell is 9th level cleric. 

it is supposed to be uncommon that people get that powerful

but a level 3 cleric is going to be ""rare"", most people don't run around in the face of death to gain levels.

I would suggest a gentle repose that is a level one spell. it does all the protecting it normally does but for a couple of days instead of ten. let's just say like 4 days. you can ritual cast it  for half of the timeframe(2 days). You can upcast it to give four days up to two people. you can ritual cast it up to your max spell level and it double for each level but it take that many times longer to cast. 

you cast it as a 4th level spell slot, you get 8 people for four days, or one person for a month. if you ritual cast it while at that level, you can get 4 people for 4 days, 8 people for 2 days, or one person for 16 days but it takes 10 minutes x 4,. 40 minutes."

Gathersday, Torchday and Ashday started as a time period where the local populations would get together to burn their dead on regular periods. in the darker times when death was more common the need for burning the dead was more common.   

on Gathersday, all people would gather the prerequisites for the coming days.  They would gather the wood, the dead, food for eating and food/supplies for alms.

On Torchsday, those in attendance say their prayers while the bodies and pyres are prepared. The fire lighters are those closest to those lost, or in some clans the youngest member of the family/clan, or if those that were lost had nobody the local leaders/witchy women. there are solemn celebrations or loud parties depending on the group/area the whole day, those that lit the fires will tend the fires burning until the break of dawn.

Ashday, the fires die as do the parties/celebrations. This is a very solemn day for all. Some for emotional, some because of the hangovers... but all because of the final loss of the individual sets in after all the work and partying is done.

now, in the modern world, we bury our dead in stout stone mausoleums. Some are warded with necromantic defenses but those are for the more orthodox of the believers.

On Gathersday's day, the normal workday ends by atleast sundown. The orthodox literally use when the sun goes down but most recognize that with our modern ability to light  larger areas, the sundown just means when one gets home. There is a great deal of shopping, and most office workers get their paychecks. People are gathering their supplies. Some family orthodox and even the more reformed churchs usually hold group burials on Torchsday, so funeral homes have fleets of transports to ""gather"" the dead to the burial areas.

Torchsday is a lot less combustible as it was day. Some individuals do put aside money for a full pyre burning/party but most go for the symbolism approach. The typical approach used as pulled from the regularlly cited ""The Reformed Pyrebuilder"" states the following :The individuals are laid out on stonetables that are the slab they are interred on, in a field. The priest or the individual places a couple of inch pin into the heart made of cold iron topped with  a personal design of magnesium. The individual to light the pin states their name, their connection to the fallen, calls for a prayer and sets off the pin. The pin burns for a few seconds but as bright as a sun. The family(church or mortuary workers) then carries the slab to the interment stone hole. The holes are not closed at this time. This gives the individuals the ability to look at the dead or leave their gifts.  The funeral home keeps a larger field open for individuals to celebrate in their own ways.

Ashday is typically the day where the holes/stoneslabs are sealed up. The final goodbye as it is. after about half of a year or more, depending on the weather of the time, the funeral workers will remove the bodies for mass burial in the town pit, they will clean the stones and return the name plate to the torchbearer for the individual. Some families do ""help"" transport the body from the tomb to the pit but it is rare.

families typically do not visit the tombs save for on Torchsday where they have lost someone or are helping someone they care about in losing someone.  If one is lucky enough not to lose an individual that year, many visit the burial pit to keep that person in their heart and to hold on to that bit of understanding of the death that others are dealing with."
dndnext,ffcfc69,t3_esufuo,1579798244.0,"I would honestly ask yourself, ""how did you present this""

I could see being annoyed at a DM asking for me to keep track of every bit and bobble of each ""ash of this"" and ""gum of that"" in normal everyday situations in a game. This is because it is possible that the DM will make arbitrary decisions about what spells I could use.

I could also see a fairness balance issue. Will you as the DM keep track of all the items the enemies/other spellcasters have? Will the player's be able to loot the other spellcaster's component pouches?

So, I guess my questions is ""what are you trying to do"" with this? Why do you want to do this? are you trying to make spellcasters track things, are you trying to limit spell selection, are you trying to make quests/plothooks

have each character start with a component pouch(if they don't already).. that way, they already have every component they need unless the spell specifically states a cost over a certain amount.

in certain cases, such as jail, being prisoners or such... then they won't have any components they can't find nearby... and in extreme cases finding consumable replacements maybe impossible."
dndnext,ffceaej,t1_ffcbgn2,1579797599.0,"The issue I see with your suggestion is that your reasoning proves why it would be taught to neophyte priests.

We have morticians that preserve the body for a family funeral now, and usually a religious person guiding the family through a remembrance service and/or funeral. it is a cheap and easy spell that can be ritually cast for free.   There is also the idea that dead bodies hold sickness and do eventually rot, so preserving the fresh ripeness of the body could be seen as a disease stopping endeavor…. 

then, if the undead are like a real rampant problem.... why wouldn't the priests cast the spell to preserve the body until enough bodies can make massive pyres more efficient. If someone dies and everyone is super worried about an undead threat, they could burn that person right then and there(which has problems) or they could preserve them so that everyone could be burnt on ""torchsday""

this doesn't change your ideas of enslaving spirits, mass murder or stealing of corpses because getting a priest to a location still takes time, even protecting 6 people takes an hour(meaning that after a mass death/battle, it would take a lot of priests a lot of time). there is also the logistical issues with carting a dead/oozing body to a burn pit takes time... and unless you have a burn pit going all day... there will be bodies hanging around. If you have burn pits going all day long, that means you have a lot of people cutting and carting wood... unless you have a mage or two there.

I do like the idea of up-casting to extend the coverage but you can't ritual upcast. so maybe you can upcast the time of the with spell slots AND it goes up in ritual area power as you level up. A level 20 priest/cleric could preserve a whole battlefield for 10 days as a ritual, or maybe preserve one person for eternity with spell slots."

could just be a third-cousin to the king and good at army movements. Being a king doesn't mean that they are a level 20 diplomat or whatever. They might have money and resources to give them protections, like guards, magics and the like..

so, having the first hit be advantaged and if hit a crit should be enough... then the person flailed, screamed out, or alerted a guard."

Winter doesn't start until like February. so, this is like late fall... and 70's and warm and stuffy is exactly fall weather. We've never really had a white Christmas... so not getting snow is ok.

but really, yea... PA used to feel a lot colder or temperatures felt like they stayed the same without the random flips. oh, it was freezing a couple of days ago... nope, now it is humid and hot. then summer is going to be the hottest and rainiest for like 4 months."

straight-ish cis dude here. I ain't waiving my cock around in the bathroom. I don't care who is in my bathroom. use the facilities that are available, do your business and leave.  just don't be a creepy asshole in the bathroom and no one should care.
