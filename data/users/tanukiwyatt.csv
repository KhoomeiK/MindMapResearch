AmItheAsshole,ffrekpw,t1_ffr65vg,1580156495.0,You're kidding... Please tell me this didn't happen!?? I don't understand how you saw *yourself* as the issue in that story!
AmItheAsshole,ffr6prc,t1_ffr5y2p,1580151640.0,"Honestly if it's an expensive strip club all you need is a vip room for a couple of hours and some decent alcohol to spend that. (definitely doesn't mean he got anything extra, not sure if that's what you meant)"
madlads,ffnnrbz,t1_ffng3ga,1580068267.0,If you want to be able to keep calling someone it doesn't matter if they're blocked. Apps etc let you get through and if she had to change her number  that'd be fucking ridiculous since he could just stop harassing her.
relationships,ffndlpt,t1_ffj448h,1580064572.0,"I'm just guessing here but I'd say he's angry that he's made all these big life choices and they haven't magically made him happy. He refuses to believe the unhappiness is in his head. It's a hard thing to accept but tough shit to him he doesn't get to put you through that, it's time for serious boundaries."
AmItheAsshole,ffiamai,t1_ffi43rm,1579969310.0,The surgery is far more reversible and less risky than the one his wife would need.
UnethicalLifeProTips,ffi6jbm,t1_ffhrolf,1579966409.0,That's an easy way to have your kids spray a whole bottle of that stuff at once
AskReddit,ffhawsr,t1_fffej2j,1579928305.0,Was it a reflective bowl? I've heard the reflection can put them off?
AmItheAsshole,fffcq75,t1_fff2eq2,1579881079.0,You're right! She should've kept her legs closed so tight she folded in onto herself and compressed into a diamond.
AmItheAsshole,fff5jzc,t1_ffd4e34,1579876258.0,"Maybe he was awkward because he knows how his girlfriend reacts to things like that so he over thought it, looked guilty while trying to work out what to do, got questioned and then answered."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffeuo91,t1_ffa6ac1,1579866317.0,"If you think there's an argument to racism and that I should sit and listen to people who think like that I don't know how to help you. Yes racists need education but that doesn't mean everywhere gets to be a safe space for racism to be protected, personally I don't think they're owed that on reddit."
AmItheAsshole,fferi8r,t1_ffeok8t,1579861952.0,The pregnant woman isn't involved in this though?
AmItheAsshole,ffere89,t1_ffee90t,1579861783.0,This response was so harsh and so true it's hilarious.
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffa5m7k,t1_ffa4rpn,1579728343.0,"I don't really care about taking the time to teach someone on an anonymous site a lesson about racism. That's not really going to work. Reddits rules matter to make people feel like this is a welcoming community that doesn't accept that bullshit. So yes, you are missing the point."
AskReddit,ff9uzlz,t1_ff94whs,1579722038.0,"Even the guy who told the story said it was shitty when he replied to me so obviously it went against their agreement.

Main point: opening up the relationship in certain ways doesn't entitle people to suddenly pretend there are no rules. The only reason I'm saying this is because a lot of people misunderstand what opening a relationship looks like."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ff9uu1n,t1_ff9bz98,1579721917.0,"You're missing the point. If he wants to be racist in a place that's fine with it then cool, whatever, he can claim what he likes. But reddit specifically says that attitude is an issue and so reporting it is perfectly reasonable to keep racism out of reddit where possible. If you have an issue with that then the issue is with reddits rules."
cringepics,ff8ocwm,t1_ff8nvj6,1579688740.0,Everyone saying its sexual is more than likely kidding. Having dated someone with a foot fetish this is disturbingly similar to that kind of behaviour though so it's hilarious.
Damnthatsinteresting,ff8nyox,t1_ff8flpj,1579688143.0,The best way to stop male alcoholism
FragileWhiteRedditor,ff8no0k,t1_ff8508h,1579687689.0,Wanting people on reddit to follow rules that help people not be subjected to harassment isn't being fragile it's making reddit less toxic.
AskReddit,ff82b6j,t1_ff7vmh5,1579664126.0,That's not really something you just decide for yourself when a person from the typically monogamous couple leaves and isn't aware of the situation.
FragileWhiteRedditor,ff81f6u,t1_ff7bggn,1579663472.0,Lame? If they're following reddits rules nothing will happen. If they aren't then they should be banned.
AskReddit,ff7flhp,t1_ff7elkn,1579648416.0,"Oh I wasn't really trying to judge you, more just seemed unfair your ex was cast as a crazy person by the person responding. I'm sure you've grown a lot, we all do shitty things."
relationships,ff72h8m,t1_ff60i2e,1579639796.0,"Google what alcoholism REALLY IS. It's not just the men sitting with paper bags in the park. You can be functional and be a horrible drunk. There are quizzes about it, take them with him."
AskReddit,ff6wulf,t1_ff6srgo,1579636528.0,"I read that as meerkats at first and I thought that was a strange combination.

Would you really want to deal with rik and morty creatures when you aren't rik or morty? Not sure you'd last."
AskReddit,ff6w2bd,t1_ff6oz3q,1579636067.0,I guess it would suck to have arranged something really fun for your partner and then having them and your friend do that to you right after. Seems a lot of effort to go to for revenge honestly but anger is a power thing.
AmItheAsshole,ff6e8dc,t1_ff6b44m,1579625282.0,"Like I said, I still think the kid is wrong. I'm just explaining where his original thought process probably came from. Understanding how he reacted and took the divorce is helpful for OP to understand his sons anger. We can all sit here and point out that the kid is an asshole but that's not really productive beyond telling OP they did nothing wrong."
TheSimpsons,ff60m3h,t1_ff5h3lu,1579616059.0,"A lot of positive stereotypes are still an issue for people. People assuming things in general, like Asians being good at maths causes teacher to overlook them when they struggle in class, so it does create problema. This isn't my vote on apu, I'm not Indian, I'm only writing this because I struggled to understand why Asians being good at maths and such was a problem."
fasting,ff5twxe,t1_ff5seeo,1579610098.0,That smirk says so many things and I love it.
TwoXChromosomes,ff5rnek,t1_ff4i64a,1579607580.0,"Oh God, is this real or a joke?"
AmItheAsshole,ff5mk7g,t1_ff52ee8,1579600357.0,"I think the point was that cancer is in no way a positive thing but being transgender isn't negative, it's only difficult because of people like your BIL. I understand that you were trying to point out the struggle they both experience."
AmItheAsshole,ff5l7l4,t1_ff4upf1,1579598282.0,OP had every right to leave but I think as a kid watching your family get pulled apart you can just want the anger and pain to go away. The affair couldn't be undone so OPs son saw the only person as able to stop this whole thing was his dad. None of this is OK obviously but I can see where the thought process came from.
unpopularopinion,ff3n9sk,t1_ff2smf0,1579544694.0,"The idea of that is hilarious, demanding a refund for a kid. It's fair definitely but I imagine it'd work like child support as in, it wouldn't really work unless the other parent goes along with it."
AmItheAsshole,ff3eldn,t1_ff3a3x4,1579539490.0,You'd be surprised how much you can lie to yourself. She genuinely could never have figured out that she's not ugly and it's clearly a mental health issue.
AmItheAsshole,ff2oppc,t1_ff2o7ps,1579516744.0,Seems kind of creepy either way honestly. Asking if she'd ever consider having short hair before asking her to cut it off and give it to her would've been the less emotionally manipulative way to go.
AmItheAsshole,ff1220z,t1_ff0xabq,1579474426.0,The reason the law is how it is is because you can't force someone into a pregnancy or an abortion and you shouldn't be able to! Yes op is in a shitty situation but if he's not the one carrying the child he doesn't get to decide if it continues to be. So he has the option of setting up a payment plan and having no contact with the child and move on with his life or he can enquire about cutting parental rights in whatever country they're in.
AmItheAsshole,fezc1mc,t1_feyoaxg,1579455805.0,"I don't know, if a vulnerable kid was hanging around my partner newish I might start getting worried if they were willing to explain it a little."
AmItheAsshole,feza8cc,t1_fexyimk,1579455269.0,"It's not explicitly stated that she's disabled because she's fat, she could be fat because she's disabled. And even so I don't think we should judge her for her weight, the relevant part is that she acted entitled to sit in a dog bed. Disability makes life awkward and the cousin should've talked to op about seating arrangements either before or privately."
AmItheAsshole,fel6kqs,t1_fejq3hn,1579215150.0,Apparently the whole alcohol evaporates off your food isn't true. I'm not an expert on this obviously but some alcoholics will have a chemical reaction to it being introduced into their system apparently?
wholesomememes,febhkml,t1_feas2ek,1578958840.0, Women get weird crushes. I don't know what you. Look like but as a woman I can tell you that when we talk about who we've crushed on the answers are hilarious and unexpected.
AmItheAsshole,fe8c77y,t1_fe82x7e,1578924686.0,"I'm not trying to diagnose her, more just pointing out that OP should know if this routine is important enough to make her have a breakdown if it's threatened to be disrupted or if this is just a weak excuse."
AmItheAsshole,fe80nc7,t1_fe7idbn,1578921032.0,It could be but I imagine OP has never seen his wife break this rule or he'd say so.
AmItheAsshole,fe5r6yr,t1_fe4xg5y,1578873419.0,"Good point, op maybe message the daughter and explain to her that you're very happy for her to spend time with the cat but that she's loved. Everything you explained here will let any normal person know this cat is loved. Easy to assume she's not taken care of as an outdoor cat if you don't have the info."
AmItheAsshole,fe3o0uc,t1_fe36rtz,1578851220.0,Yeah he's not clueless at all. He knew that was shitty and he's just doubling down on it playing dumb.
AmItheAsshole,fdxk749,t1_fdwy9av,1578769544.0,Maybe sell the prize to another bride? Then you can offer the money towards something else for your FDIL and feel included but not waste the prize.

AmItheAsshole,fdjyih5,t1_fdj4h4p,1578491442.0,"Signing your rights over won't stop people harassing you to become ready to be a mum one day. If you want the abortion, get it. It sounds like you know it's for the best."
AmItheAsshole,fdjyaeh,t1_fdibbxl,1578491263.0,Sounds like she's trying to communicate a kink she's ashamed of and playing it off as a nice wedding activity.
MurderedByWords,fdju1o6,t1_fdjs10m,1578487482.0,I was agreeing with you that it's wrong
MurderedByWords,fdjrk73,t1_fdjqhzk,1578484840.0,"I think you're right because that kind of attitude doesn't just hurt people who the comment was directed at. Being short, having a small dick or being over weight etc isn't something people should feel ashamed for but I think we're all guilty of suddenly changing our tune about that once we hate someone because it's an easy target. I know I still do it, it's awful and a reflex when I'm upset at someone but I definitely know it's not OK."
AskReddit,fdh1chl,t1_fdgipzo,1578413241.0,"Well, honest people and lazy people"
facepalm,fdgvpu1,t1_fdgr7u5,1578409508.0,"Seriously? Peta in general are a shit show that don't fully think their demands through. Google their campaigns against sheep Sheering and calling it cruel. It's not a hard search. (this isn't a statement against vegans BTW, just peta)"
facepalm,fdgvkxi,t1_fdgrdgv,1578409412.0,The context is peta not people who have ethical issues with farming. I can see that argument but I mean peta are idiots when you look into their ideas on animal welfare and rights.

facepalm,fdgqdai,t1_fdgms9o,1578405559.0,"Right, but to then say that shaving them is wrong is stupid is the point the reply is making obviously. We can't really change how they were bred in the past."
AmItheAsshole,fddg6b9,t1_fdcm8qf,1578310827.0,I mean how is op not the asshole here? Asking his roommate not to play in the litter box is a bit unreasonable.

AmItheAsshole,fczr4gx,t1_fczmtd5,1578107195.0,Some people develop issues that create fake illnesses (or truly believe them) in their heads that go beyond little kids lying for attention. Ops friend needs serious therapy no doubt but this kind of thing does happen in adults.

AmItheAsshole,fcqxmp3,t1_fcqtjfy,1577893758.0,You should do some research into the purpose of pubic hair on people. Genuinely shaving makes the chance of stds etc more common (open cuts for an infection to get into). I understand not liking it as a personal preference but if its just that you think it's actually a sign someone isn't clean that's a bit flawed. If you have time there are some peer reviewed articles on the argument.

TwoXChromosomes,fcph92q,t1_fcot76x,1577863966.0,"As someone who spends a lot of time with people in different forms of open relationships that's not her getting to keep anything good. She technically gets to keep her husband, but he's being forced into something to fix an issue. He's not happy. They are not properly happy. This is not what an open relationship that doesn't end in flames looks like. She's a very selfish person to the point that she will destroy everything in her life. Even if it seems like she walks away untouched."

AmItheAsshole,fcm3xlp,t1_fcm2sy8,1577763603.0,He said he still wants them there and op is being pressured to pay for them still. Big no. He should tell them they can come if they want but that he needs to talk to them about their disrespectful attitude to his partner.

AskReddit,fce8mnt,t1_fcaf2bq,1577617958.0,"It's probably a lot more boring than you think though. How many people do you really have any level of hate for? There are people you find annoying, many you think that of because you don't understand them but really dislike for a real reason that matters? I can't think of many. And if I knew this I'd get to avoid people who unfairly judge me. It'd suck at the start but then I wouldn't waste time worrying about it. I'd just know who to spend energy on."
