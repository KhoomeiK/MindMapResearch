magicthecirclejerking,ffg6m14,t3_etadi4,1579899572.0,What does this mean?
GrowCastle,fffnznf,t3_ern3e8,1579888057.0,"First of all your archer and tower cost should be the same, that's a good way to keep everything balanced and powerful. Use those diamonds to promote your stuff, I would suggest one of your wizards and putting all the of them together (ice is quite useful, when promoting him a would do the one that does a bigger area). The three archers ar always good to have around especially dark elf and ranger. Switch out cannon for worm, in my experience cannon has done jack shit and worm (when fully promoted of course) is amazing. Since you can now change your towers (the ones your heroes stand on) when your ready to buy them (I would suggest promoting all your guys to max THEN do) imo use from bottom to top; poison castle, mini gun, ballista then lightning castle on top.

Hope this helped :)"
