It's got a super interesting and bizarre world. Incredible lore, and it's very mysterious because it isn't completely laid out and it's sort of dropped in little tidbits where you have to try and piece it all together. The world building is very much not in your face like other fantasy. It's also got otherworldly creatures and monsters that you really don't know much about. Maybe minor spoiler, but not really, I'll tag anyways but you find this out pretty early in the book anyways and doesn't really ruin anything, >!mountain sized underwater monsters trying to enslave humanity!<. It's the coolest and most interesting lore I've ever read in a book. Be aware, though, these books are more challenging than regular fantasy.
