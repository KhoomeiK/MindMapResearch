xboxone,fepvawo,t1_feory7d,1579332580.0,"You can go into xbox setting and basically make a ""dead zone"" on you sticks so that it doesn't have to go to the VERY edge to register as fully pushed. That should fix the issue you speak of."

I'm sure all the gas lines are well grounded, but would it be ok if hit by lightning?"

Justrolledintotheshop,fc935az,t3_egnj79,1577546264.0,Well there's your problem
3dprintingfail,fc76k24,t1_fc5sykj,1577498890.0,How.. Please explain to help others. What was the issue. What did you do to fix it.
3dprintingfail,fc5g2i5,t3_eg3m1v,1577456571.0,"Looks to me like something is loose on your X or Y axis. Check all your belts. Make sure they are fairly tight so it's not skipping teeth on the belt. Make sure you're drive motors are alll secure and that the set screws and couplings holding the motor to the drive pully are tight to the motor shaft, otherwise they may spin the motor without the pulley spinning.

I think it looks like your x-axis is the issue. 


Otherwise, you may be skipping steps on your stepper motors. In this case, belts may be TOO tight, Rollers may be out of their grooves, etc. Check all those things."
SweatyPalms,fc2o8ol,t1_fc2iw8e,1577368917.0,"Maybe our new busses are transits because of our location. I live in West Virginia. The busses have to go long distances on very very narrow, one lane winding roads in the hills. The roads have some very tight turns so I guess that would make sense. Frequently I remember having to stop and do a multi-point turn in the middle of a normal road cause it's so sharp. This is good info. Thanks!"
SweatyPalms,fc2fudo,t1_fc29ja7,1577357825.0,"New busses in the US have a flat front like you describe. This is an old old bus that is still in service, probably because our public schools are so under funded. üòû"
howto,fc1zhix,t1_fc1z4r2,1577334662.0,"Yes! And easily customizable. You could use all kinds of things like a relay, motor, etc instead of a servo. The code would only need to change very slightly and it's easy to learn if you are interested :)"
howto,fc19v03,t1_fc194ca,1577312427.0,":( Arduino or something similar and a servo will probably be the way to go.

Use this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/afPxj0LS0LU) for reference.

It will give you the basic idea and you can customize it to fit you're needs. Obviously the silicone finger won't be need for the application lol.

Instead of using Alexa, we could write some very simple code to push the button every 2 hrs"
howto,fc12r2h,t3_efifbd,1577306592.0,Have you tried just holding it in to see if it stays at 2 hrs. If so just zip tie it pushed down
