They could have had a child early, had to raise their siblings, or both. Any number of reasons force wisdom and experience beyond one's age. The older person could have led a ""normal"" life. That they just appreciate the struggle of the other person and the wonderful person that adversity produced. People are widely varied. Try not to be so rigid.

The same could be said for this as well."

ThailandTourism,ff25l3y,t3_equwzb,1579494439.0,"It's not too hard to find a lady that'll play. You could try ThaiFriendly or Tinder to find a freelancer that way. Many of the working women have some pretty dim views of foreigners, and may shy away from them, because they don't treat them like people. Just remember that little nugget when you're out and about. You catch more flies with honey. Working women are still women. Also, take a good look, she might be a lady boi. Unless, of course, you're into that."
ThailandTourism,ff251yf,t3_er08fl,1579494014.0,"I went to Thailand for the first time in December. It was an overall great experience. Chiang Mai was actually my favorite stop and the air quality was fine around that time. Forgive me, I don't know the name, but I went to a nearby mountain top temple that is all clad in gold color. It was especially nice at sunset. If you do happen to go that way, I made friends with a very friendly and economically-priced driver that could ferry you about to various spots. Just let me know and I'll shoot you his Line ID. 

One extra note for you. Make sure you do your research on an elephant sanctuary before going to one. Many of them are not really in it for the welfare of the elephants. Any that offer elephant rides are definitely fake and the way they get elephants to allow that to happen is barbaric. I went to one outside of Chiang Mai that was a great experience. You feed the elephants, pet them, give them a mud bath, and wash them off in another pond. The handlers also tell you about their mission and did so with humor. A small Thai curry lunch was offered as part of the deal as well."

I know plenty of Chinese, Korean, and Taiwanese that change their names to something they like the sound of in English when moving to the U.S. and getting their documentation in line. Even my ex had this setup. Her U.S. passport had her chosen English name and it didn't cause issues."

One noted how he went as one of the shooters for Halloween and got all of the details right. The other quipped with a fun fact of a ""did you know...

I wasn't specifically looking for it, but when I built my new computer about two years ago, the mid'ish range motherboard came with one USB C. I still haven't used it even though my phone has a USB C connection. I'd imagine many other desktop PC users wouldn't have a USB C since PC upgrade cycles are longer."

changemyview,fei5nyn,t1_feh0bsv,1579130831.0,"I'd imagine that you don't have experience living in an expensive city. Many of these, for example, would include places like San Francisco, New York City, London, Melbourne, and others. A million dollar net worth is nothing compared to the cost of living and average house price. A person's net worth in an area such as this would definitely not equate to ability to pay and disproportionately affects them over someone with a more liquid million dollar net worth in say, the state of Oklahoma. I would suggest, instead, that the fee be a calculation that takes into account cost of living in their area vs their disposable income. Something that will inherently rob them of some enjoyment or benefit in their life for some time based on the severity of the offense."
worldnews,fei0ug4,t1_fei0fpu,1579127834.0,"Not to appear snooty, but presumably, if you can afford to purchase an iPad Pro at that steep price, you have a reasonably modern laptop to connect it to that has a USB C port. My several year old non-Apple laptop has a USB C port so surely something newer than that would have a good chance at having one. So I don't see an immediately pertinent reason why they'd want a USB A connector, unless it was for a car.

It's quite frustrating for a traditionally straight male (and I'm assuming females as well) to sort through the many dishonest people posing as a cis-woman under the traditional category. Many of the apps have trans and other categories so I don't see why they aren't labeling themselves as such so potential partners that want to be inclusive, will have that choice. I respect people's choices up until it directly affects me. I've even had one be dishonest about their gender up until meeting. It was clear upon seeing them that they were trans and I didn't get mad, but they really wasted both of our times by doing that."

changemyview,fcltel0,t1_fclm3ie,1577756018.0,"That may be the stereotype that only cheap stuff comes out of China, but there's a dangerous ignorance carried with it. China is the manufacturing hub of the world. Precious few things don't come from there now. Many of which do not have manufacturing centers elsewhere. Almost every product from your favorite home store like Target or Walmart comes from China. Need a washing machine or a dryer? China. Sure, there are boutique high-end items that are made in the U.S. or Japan, but even that is a lie. The made in the U.S. note usually means a certain percentage of the parts are from U.S. supplies since they know it's unrealistic or impossible to get them locally. 

The note about rare earth supplies is the largest issue since China runs a virtual monopoly of that resource. Something as simple as a CPU heatsink for your computer, phone, laptop, cable box, etc. Comes from a factory in China. Sure, we could build up the capability in the U.S. or Europe over time, but our labor rates and safety requirements make that move untenable cost wise. No consumer will pay the requisite price hike of likely more than 100%. Big and small businesses alike function in this world on low cost to deliver goods at a price that is acceptable to their target customer. That will never change. Consumption or the ability to consume drives economies. 


So what do businesses do instead? The US and China trade war has shown that when the price of doing business becomes unacceptable or unsustainable, they move to a new country with a better offer. Right now, the darling is Vietnam. Thailand, Taiwan, and Malaysia make specialty items. Businesses want India to be a thing, but their financial and regulatory environment isn't worth the hassle. Barring any change there, the next stop once Southeast Asia is used up will be Africa. China is already building up infrastructure there to take advantage later."
