Medicare revenues comes from

*    41% Funding from Income Taxes
*    38% is funded to the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund, is financed primarily through a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9 percent of earnings paid by employers and their employees (1.45 percent each)
*    13% premiums paid by beneficiaries
*    7% Taxation on Social Security, Interest on Social Security Investment Lending/State Funding

We will need to increase the fica taxes another 3.8% just to have Medicare paid for the current enrollment

Then we need 1.24 trillion minus the 50 billion in profit more for the funding of all those on insurance to now be on Medicare. Add to the 80 million under insured.  For rounding sake let's take half the cost of current Medicare 60 million enrollment, $350 billion 

So 1.5 Trillion in New federal tax cost

According to the report

* Disclosures: Dr. Himmelstein reports that he cofounded and remains active in the professional organization Physicians for a National Health Program. He has served as an unpaid policy advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders and has coauthored research- related manuscripts with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. He received no remuneration for this work.

Freestanding Doctor's Offices are reported to have $151 Billion in admin cost (20% of Healthcare Admin Cost in the Report)

The problem is this number as the report states is based off of a 2011 report. 

Which was based on surveys from 2006

* The surveys were majority aimed at for Doctors office with less than 3 Doctors on staff.  
  * The number of physicians working at practices with more than 50 physicians—15% in 2018, 13.8% in 2016, up from 12.2 percent in 2012
* The report then uses the Doctors' survey results that, the average Doctor spent 3.4 hours per week on billing at an annual cost to patients of $57,147
 * I don't even understand this.  This means doctors are billing there patients $323 an hour to do back office work.
 * Which means Doctors average Salary would be Closer to $680,000 not the median today of $208,000
* But then it adds in an additional 77 hours of billable time for other departments doing admin work with insurance with annual cost of $112,155
 * So additional work is being done at $54 an hour

This is of course the american way of work where we dont hire some one else we just spread out the work. So it is saving money if there are new patients

* But Doctors are already at their maximum patient size, 2300 per year vs Global advice 1,500 and AMA Advice 2,500


Now what Canada has is a program where there's only 20 hours of work in billing all handled by a billing dept. 

But is it savings anywhere?  At best what happens is the Dr can fire one of the secretaries (saving $40,000 or about $18 a patient) and Medicare will hire half of them

The group the study says has the highest Admin percentage cost is in Home Health & Hospice Care (27%/40%)

* $90 Billion of the estimated cost of admin

As the study even says Home And Hospice Care is rarely paid for with insurance as Cash and Medicare are the main payers

politics,fff7njh,t1_fff38le,1579877767.0,"> For physicians, a single-payer system could lessen administrative burden and free time for direct patient care. Uncompensated care costs resulting from lack of insurance or unpaid cost sharing would no longer be a concern. However, these benefits may come at the expense of physician autonomy and increased demand for care (81). Many single-payer proposals would base payments to physicians on Medicare's flawed payment system, which encourages volume over value, undervalues cognitive services and primary care, overvalues procedures, and bases payments on the input costs of each billable service rather than on value to patients. As discussed in the companion ACP paper “Envisioning a Better U.S. Health Care System for All: Health Care Delivery and Payment System Reforms” (2), any system of universal coverage should not perpetuate the existing flawed Medicare payment system. Most primary care physicians in particular probably could not afford to accept current Medicare rates for all of their patients.

Twin Brothers Chris and Jeffrey George make $43 million from 2007-2009 from the illicit sale of oxycodone and other drugs out of their South Florida pain clinics. When patients start dying, their pill mills get unwanted attention from the Feds.

 * $4.5 million in cash was hidden by the twins’ mother in her attic.

Late in 2007, Chris George, a 27-year-old former convict with no medical training, opened his first pain pill clinic in South Florida. With no laws to stop him, George and his twin brother, Jeff, were about to become kingpins, running pills up and down I-75 — quickly dubbed “Oxy Alley.”

Their top clinic, American Pain alone prescribed almost 20 million pills over two years.

 * Inked muscle-heads ran the clinic's security. Former strippers operated the pharmacy, counting out pills and stashing cash in garbage bags. Under their lab coats, the doctors carried guns--and it was all legal... sort of.

The clinic’s top performer was a young doctor named Cynthia Cadet. During her 16-month tenure, Cadet became the No. 1 writer of scrips for oxycodone pills in the country — some days seeing more than 70 patients.

* She made roughly $1.3 million during the 15 months she worked at American Pain

Cadet and another clinic doctor stood trial for distributing narcotics for non-medical reasons and a resultant seven deaths. In fact, Cadet alone had served 51 patients whose deaths could be linked to prescription pills.

**Both doctors were found not guilty.** Cadet's defense: How could she possibly know if patients were lying about their pain levels?

* acquitted of the most serious charges of causing the death of 10 patients, both were convicted of a money-laundering conspiracy 

After a 31-day trial and deliberating for roughly 20 hours over three days, the 12-person jury found the only crime Drs. Cynthia Cadet and Joseph Castronuovo committed was money laundering."

Uncompensated care costs resulting from lack of insurance or unpaid cost sharing would no longer be a concern. However, these benefits may come at the expense of physician autonomy and increased demand for care (81). Many single-payer proposals would base payments to physicians on Medicare's flawed payment system, which encourages volume over value, undervalues cognitive services and primary care, overvalues procedures, and bases payments on the input costs of each billable service rather than on value to patients. As discussed in the companion ACP paper “Envisioning a Better U.S. Health Care System for All: Health Care Delivery and Payment System Reforms” (2), any system of universal coverage should not perpetuate the existing flawed Medicare payment system. Most primary care physicians in particular probably could not afford to accept current Medicare rates for all of their patients.

> It isn’t a mistake that taxes in Scandinavian countries are structured this way. In order to raise a significant amount of revenue, the tax base has to be broad. This means higher taxes on consumption through the VAT and higher taxes on middle-income taxpayers through high payroll taxes. Business taxes are a less reliable source of revenue (unless your country is situated on top of oil). Thus, Scandinavian countries do not place above-average tax burdens on capital income and focus taxation on labor and consumption.

Freestanding Doctor's Offices are reported to have $151 Billion in admin cost (20% of Admin Cost)

The problem is this number as the report states is based off of a 2011 report. 

* Which was based on surveys from 2006
* The surveys were majority aimed at for Doctors office with less than 3 Doctors on staff.  
  * The number of physicians working at practices with more than 50 physicians—15% in 2018, 13.8% in 2016, up from 12.2 percent in 2012
* The report then uses the Doctors' survey results that, the average Doctor spent 3.4 hours per week on billing at an annual cost to patients of $57,147
 * I don't even understand this.  This means doctors are billing there patients $323 an hour to do back office work.
 * Which means Doctors average Salary would be Closer to $680,000 not the median today of $208,000
* But then it adds in an additional 77 hours of billable time for other departments doing admin work with insurance with annual cost of $112,155
 * So additional work is being done at $54 an hour

This is of course the american way of work where we dont hire some one else we just spread out the work. So it is saving money if there are no new patients

Based on the report the current Doctor's Office has about 80 hours a week of backend billing work per doctor.   Now instead of hiring 2 fulltime Medical Billers 

* the Dr instead does 3.4 hours of work himself.  
* The 2 nurses on staff are picking up 20.6 hours of that work.  
* The 2 secretaries/Office Manager are doing the remaining 56 hours of that work

Now what Canada has is a program where there's only 20 hours of work in billing all handled by a billing dept. 

But is it savings anywhere?  At best what happens is the Dr can fire one of the secretaries (saving $40,000 or about $18 a patient) and Medicare will hire half of them"

A VAT vs Sales Tax

Assuming both spend all thier money earned. 

* In the US sales tax median rate is 9.9% but only 1/3 of consumption purchases qualify to be taxed


* UK 25% VAT

In the U.K. I believe means $9,000 in indirect taxes

*  The median UK is paying $13,000 in taxes, but Maybe less?

*    The median American is paying up to $5,000 in taxes, but many are around 3 or 4 thousand per state tax exemptions, but many have a negative tax rate due to the eit

> It isn’t a mistake that taxes in Scandinavian countries are structured this way. In order to raise a significant amount of revenue, the tax base has to be broad. This means higher taxes on consumption through the VAT and higher taxes on middle-income taxpayers through high payroll taxes. Business taxes are a less reliable source of revenue (unless your country is situated on top of oil). Thus, Scandinavian countries do not place above-average tax burdens on capital income and focus taxation on labor and consumption.

The US spent $1 Trillion employing [16.5 million workers in Health care] (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home.htm)

* 15 Million of them are directly working in healthcare
 * ~5 Million  Nurses and 900,000 MDs for a population of 330 million 
 * 366 people per Doctors (of course most Drs are specialized)
 * 66 People per Nurse

While NHS list 150,000 Drs and 320,000 nurses for a population of 67 million

 * 447 people per Doctors (of course most Drs are specialized)
 * 209 People per Nurse

That means that we need 3 million less nurses and 200,000 less doctors

* Saving us $400 billion dollars annually
 * The median annual wage for medical pay in the NHS is almost half the US so that's another $100 billion in savings

We also need to close hospitals, we're way to low utilization 

**We spent $121 billion on medical structures and technology**

Why is this big? 

High Cost due to poor utilization

* [50%] (https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/bulletins/ukhealthaccounts/2017) of medical care in the uk is done at a hospital
* [33%] (https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/index) of medical care in the US is done at a hospital 

And this leads to low utilization 

The [OECD] (https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/___media_files_publications_issue_brief_2012_may_1595_squires_explaining_high_hlt_care_spending_intl_brief.pdf) also tracks the supply and utilization of several types of diagnostic imaging devices—important to and often costly technologies. Relative to the other study countries where data were available, there were an above-average number of  

 * MRI machines per million population 25.9 (U.S.) vs 6.5 (France) vs (OCED) 8.9
 * CT scanners per million population 34.3 (U.S.) vs 15.1 (OCED) , 
 * Mammographs per million population 40.3 (U.S.) vs 17.3 (OCED

this is not the plan Sanders is putting forth

In 2018, 8.5 percent of people, or 27.5 million, did not have health insurance at any point during the year

* 51.6 percent are above middle class jobs making 25 dollars an hour jobs

The problem isnt some people pay more, its people pay less.

There are 5.1 million people that make over $100,000 that are uninsured. These people spend 0 on insurance that would be required to spend $15,000+ in a European style approach from taxes

There are 9.1 million people that make $50,000 - $100,000 that are uninsured that are spending 0 on health insurance and would be required to spend $10,000+"

The average overall physician salary—including primary care and specialties—is $299,000. The profession saw a modest increase in earnings over last year: In 2017, primary care physicians earned $217,000, compared with $223,000 in 2018; specialists earned $316,000 in our 2017 report compared with $329,000 this year. For employed respondents, compensation includes salary, bonus, and profit-sharing contributions. For partners and solo practitioners, it includes earnings after taxes and deductible business expenses but before income taxes."
