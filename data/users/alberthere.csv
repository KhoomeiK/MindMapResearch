DejaReve,ff1vh7m,t3_eqqwwt,1579487090.0,"I have. Three attempts.

First Dream: Mid-conversation with HR. I made a joke about how we shouldn’t be open for work this weekend even though I know people need to work to make up hours. He agreed with me.

First Attempt: I recognized the setting, just before the moment I decided not to say anything about this weekend.

First Result: Changed the event, but didn’t change the result because HR made an announcement that no one can work this weekend due to system-wide updates.

Second Dream: Mid-conversation about losing an account. We don’t know what the real reason is.

Second Attempt: Account manager called me to request for something. Gave her the info. Remembered the dream regarding losing this account. Asked one of our guys to look at what I gave her. He told me it was off by one digit. Immediately called the manager back with the correct info.

Second Result: Unknown. Hoping we keep the account. If we still eventually lose the account as per deja reve, I’ll update.

Third Dream: I’m sitting shotgun in a vehicle. I see some snow. We drop off a short cliff. We land frontside first on the ground. It’s clear I survived the fall but I didn’t look around.

Third Attempt: I refuse to go anywhere near the mountains or places that I’m know will have snow. In fact, we had a family trip to a cabin up in the mountains. I’m the only one in my family that stayed home.

Third Result: So far, so good. I’ll update if I survive an accident as per deja reve."

* LA Metro Watch Transit App by Barum Rho: The accuracy of their bus and rail schedule is uncanny. Highly recommended.
* Uber and Lyft: Download them both so you can get the best rates at any given area/time.
* Yelp: Pretty much on point regarding restaurants--can't go wrong (except service) with restaurants that's 4-stars and up.

Speaking of Yelp, please make sure to check out the following restaurants while you're in L.A.:

* In-N-Out (Combo No.1: Double-Double--Animal Style and Fries--Well-Done)
* Langer's (No. 19 Pastrami Sandwich)
* Jitlada (Crying Tiger, Coco Mango Salad...also, there's a ""super secret off-menu item"" called the Jazz Burger. It's only available the chef feels like making it. Hope you're lucky enough to be there when Jazz makes it. [https://youtu.be/KGGM4iJfKJo](https://youtu.be/KGGM4iJfKJo))
* Daikokuya (Daikoku Ramen) make sure you specifically go to the Little Tokyo location...if you get there before 6pm, go to Fugetsu-Do Bakery Shop (Korey's Chocolate Mochi) while you wait for your seat/table because wait times for Daikokuya will vary between 30 min to 1 hour + Also note they're cash only.

Honorable Mentions:

* Taco trucks are everywhere here. I suggest you check out Kogi BBQ ([http://kogibbq.com/](http://kogibbq.com/)), Guerilla Tacos ([http://www.guerrillatacos.com/](http://www.guerrillatacos.com/)), Leo's Taco Truck ([https://www.leostacostruck.com/](https://www.leostacostruck.com/)), and Tacos 1986 ([https://www.instagram.com/tacos1986la/](https://www.instagram.com/tacos1986la/)).
* I highly recommend Howlin Ray's ([https://howlinrays.com/](https://howlinrays.com/)), but the wait is waay too long if you're visiting...if you got nothing else to do that day, check it out.
* I also recommend Porto's, but their locations may be too spread out for you ([https://www.portosbakery.com/locations/](https://www.portosbakery.com/locations/))."
