Thought his water was empty and he was thirsty but that wasn’t it.  Wasn’t anything life threatening but turns out he had a big piece of it stuck between his back molars and his cheek and he couldn’t get it out.  He let me jam my whole hand in there and get it no problem.  Usually he will not let you jam ur hand back there like if trying to give him a pill so I def think they know when you’re trying to help them and I like to think they appreciate it on some level.
