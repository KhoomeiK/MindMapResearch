Lots of Amy's canned soups are vegan. Imagine makes some AMAZING vegan boxed soups. I prefer their creamy tomato, portabello mushroom, and potato and leek soups. 

Annie's has vegan boxed mac and cheese. I think the gluten free box has the best sauce. 

Canned beans are heaven. I often microwave a sweet potato and top it with drained black beans, salsa, and nooch.

Pasta and jars of sauce are easy.

Rice is always easy imo. Add lime juice, cilantro, and salt.

The only thing that is correct is that factory farms are highly efficient. The downside (besides ethics) is that despite their efficiency, they still aren't remotely sustainable.

There are only enough dead animals to pass around because we are literally eating ourselves deeper into climate change. There won't be enough to go around soon, even if these practices don't change.

The typical alternative to exercising a horse is stuffing them into a 12'x12' stall their entire life with an occasional turnout in a square pen that doesn't foster the daily long term movement horses need (track paddocks are much better but it's rare to see anyone put all that money into completely redesigning their space if they even have enough space for it). Horses also need to be trained like dogs otherwise you run into similar issues as the untrained dog that you mentioned. Lots of horses get abandoned on the false belief that they can instantaneously survive like a wild horse. I used to foster rescue horses in southern AZ. It is not pretty.

I'm not saying to keep breeding horses, but a lot of people who say to just let the ones already alive be don't seem to understand that horses need a LOT of movement to actually be healthy in muscle, joint, and weight (like a dog). In the debate of caring for hooves, frequent long movement actually helps keep their hooves in good condition if you keep them barefoot.

I'm blanking on the name of the hurricane, but one of the recent devastating ones experienced this with the thousands of drowned pigs. Livestock that's been experimented on can wind up in pet food (I think it was Iams who got in major trouble with this hears and years ago because pets were dying due to sourcing). Diseased livestock animals initially intended for human consumption get relegated to pet food.

When choosing a brand, dont just look at fillers. Verify the animal products in the food come from animals raised and slaughtered specifically for the food."

One thing I've been learning in school that I really appreciate is that despite everything environmental going on right now, sustainability isn't going to be a homogeneous movement. It is going to look different for every individual in every culture in every climate across the globe. What works in one area doesn't work in another. What works for one person doesn't work for another because even social/cultural sustainability is a thing. We all have to start where we can and with things we think we can upkeep (it's no help if people jump too deep, cant maintain, then shun sustainability all together). Were all learning and improving, and it is going to keep getting easier with time.

An awesome book you and your parents might like is *No Impact Man* by Colin Beavan. He has a fun writing style, sources studies, and talks about his own journey of extreme sustainability for one year. He gets into how individual action matters, but also where it isnt enough/doesnt make a difference. It's a really good book, imo, about sustainability as a movement and what we can all do"
environment,fcnvdcl,t1_fcnnok6,1577819178.0,"SAD is the Standard American Diet. They averaged out the typical way Americans eat (so apologies if you live elsewhere).

Essentially, as far as emissions are concerned, the impact you have eating local is relatively minimal. You have a much larger impact by cutting down on/out beef even if you change literally nothing else about your diet or sourcing.

The less meat (and dairy) you eat the better, but it does have diminishing returns. So while eating vegan is the largest reduction, the majority of your emission reductions will come from eliminating beef followed by reducing/eliminating other sources of meat. Just find where on the spectrum you're comfortable.

Eating local should be low on the list of concerns for emissions from diets (though it does still have a small impact). However, this isnt in the article, eating local helps the local economy, can promote farming methods that are more sustainable in terms of biodiversity, land use change, and biogeochemical flows (like nitrogen runoff into waterways). You can also talk to the farmers and even visit to make sure they are treating the animals and farm workers in a way you consider ethical (I highly recommend this). The ironic side is that eating meat at the quantities we do cannot be sustained on a local, sustainable farming scale because there literally isn't enough land on the planet to sustain the quantity of farm animals we have outside of factory farming conditions.

Basically, eat local mostly for benefits outside of emissions produced, but still cut back on meat to make it a truly sustainable option. Like you are :)"

The short of it is removing just 25% of beef from SAD reduces emissions the equivalent of growing and processing every single thing you eat in your own backyard.

There are other reasons to eat local I am happy to discuss if you would like though (sustainable ag is the career field I'm entering. still a lot to learn, but I really love it).

Another thing US people often don't know is for a package of food to be labeled ""Made in the USA,"" it only needs its final place of processing to be in the US. Most of our free range beef comes from Australia and New Zealand, but US law requires it to pass through packaging and processing in the US, so it can be labeled made in the US."

vegan,fci2r2f,t1_fch772w,1577657050.0,"\>   just cause one has plants and the other is made of metal and rock doesn’t mean it’s not an ecosystem

Not the point I was making. I actually think you know that though because I literally described the definition of an ecosystem in my description of both of those.

\>  an ecosystem can be anything

Not true. I think you know that too though.

\>  humans are still mammals , we are animals just like any other animal to ever exist,  we just spread out more then most animals

Didn't say we aren't and didn't. It's amazing how adaptable we are. That is actually a pretty cool trait that's expressed to an extreme degree in the human animal and is due to a variety of evolutionary traits.

\>  just like the dinosaurs that use to walk the earth and be the dominant species

Dinosaurs weren't a homogeneous, singular species. That's like saying all apes are one species.

\>   things have not changed since then

Climatologists, paleontologists, oceanographers, and environmentalists would like to have a word

\>  humans are just the replacement for dinosaurs currently, another species will eventually replace humans , thats nature

Not entirely sure how you mean that since all any species does is fill am available niche, not replace one another like newer versions. This seems like a slightly evolutionary ladder thought (which used to be common in textbooks, so no shade).  Steven Novella: “Evolution is a messy branching bush, and we’re just finding more and more twigs all over the place”

\>  lots of animals tend to build their ecosystem

They interact within with available materials, but individual species don't build ecosystems (except maybe in a petri dish). Unless you're trying to say manipulate? But even that takes the whole community interacting.

\>  others just roam the land from place to place

That's still just interacting with their ecosystems

\>  and the human ecosystem is not just city based

No duh? Not sure the point of this. Also, what do you mean by ""human ecosystem""? An ecosystem isn't made of a single organism. We don't say ""a lion ecosystem"" where lions are dominant because that's a severe oversimplification. Unless you're just trying to say the ecosystems humans interact with? In which case, I still never disagreed.

\>   we do have farm land and other area thats well established

Again, no duh?

\>   well established with their natural surroundings

How are you defining this? Farming is actually deliberate maintenance to keep an ecosystem in the early stages of development indefinitely. It's never really established because you're preventing the progression of natural processes (not saying this is a bad thing). If you mean as a mutually beneficial coexistence, agriculture is the leading cause of pushing biodiversity, biogeochemical flows, and land use planetary boundaries. Farms can also be rewilded, and that is one form of conservation and way to combat climate change. Farms aren't really established at all in the big picture. They're maintained in a particularly fragile state as far as human developments go. Edible food forests (permaculture and some forms of regenerative and agroforestry) would have the most clout for being established, and even that depends (my particular field is sustainable agriculture, so I'm all about this haha).

\>   to be part of the land as well

Everything on the planet is a part of the planet's land. Even cities. To circle back to my point before, a city and a farm is also not the same thing, as you sort of highlighted.

\>  humans can be like a school of fish with the outer layer (working class and soldiers) protecting the inner layer

Being like is not being the same. That was my whole point.

\> or we can be like ants (working class and soldiers feeding the queen)

again, we have a lot in common with ants, but we are not the same as ants

\>  a human ecosystem can be interchangeable to many types

See above about human ecosystems.

\>   we can even be the type that just roam the earth from place to place as well

Everyone knows what nomads, moving, and migration are.

\>  we are no different than animals when it comes to our natural instincts to conservation/preservation

How does this relate to conservation/preservation being the same as militarized war? We act on our instincts in many unique and distinct ways, as do most species which you kind of funnily elaborated on earlier.

Nothing you've said here demonstrates that conservation/preservation is the same as militarized war, and you have totally missed the point I was making above. At this point, I actually have no clue what your point was because you're simultaneously saying everything is essentially homogeneous while pointing out unique characteristics and differences. I think you're reading a lot of what I'm not saying into my text and constantly redirecting the conversation. It was fun to pick apart this comment because I agree with practically everything you said in it even though your tone suggests you're trying to educate me or something, but most of it is obvious.

Since this comment chain spiraled from population control being the same as war to the definition of an ecosystem: many things are ecosystems. That does not mean all ecosystems are the same thing, as you demonstrated. My point through all of this is similarity is not the same as equating. To go to the original point again, promoting ecosystem health and political warfare might have some far fetched similarities, but you will not be able to convince me that they are essentially the same, like I said way back. Going increasingly vague to demonstrate how things are all the same is not gonna win me over. I guess we're at a stalemate.

Have a happy new year :)"

vegan,fcgxfh1,t1_fcgn94j,1577645020.0,"I know that's a thing, I just dont know how it applies in various wildlife reserves. One reserve I've been to is no hunting period, but it is a massive unfenced reserve. The other I've been to is almost enclosed by residential areas and says no hunting but allows catch/release fishing (which I dont agree with), but idk if they do anything on the govt level if a species gets overpopulated with close human proximity. I support federal culling events over hunting permits for pop control personally because it doesn't target the fittest species members like recreational does, but I still find it a complicated issue and don't necessarily agree with it.

I disagree with the war thing being an apt comparison. The goals of both are wildly different. At least as far as I know, we don't kill other humans in order to try to preserve/conserve an ecosystem. If anything, we do it to gain the ability to deplete an ecosystem for XYZ resource."

Wildlife reserves as I understand are essentially massive parks with various limited uses (usually hiking and walking or controlled safari tours) and only house animals of that habitat. Some are not fenced in at all, and some are fenced in only on the parameters of a massive territory. Predators and prey live together in a typical ecosystem because it is a preservation thing, not conservation.

I have mixed feelings about zoos because the best ones do a lot of work with wildlife conservation, but I'm tired of people acting like living in a territory a tiny fraction of their natural one is *paradise*. People seem to have grasped that psychological health matters for whales and so generally hate seeing them in any form of captivity, but it always reads like people stop caring about psychological health as soon as it is a land animal because this applies to farm animals, too. It's almost like because they don't commit suicide like a dolphin for not having the same sense of ""I"", their mental health isn't as real to people.

The only two possible cases of zoochosis I noticed when I did an internship at my local zoo, which I consider to be comparatively great, was the tiger and the wolf pack, all of whom paced back and forth incessantly in their cages, and it broke my heart. Especially to see people commenting on how great it was to see such active animals at the zoo since they didn't understand. I've seen similar behavior in horses when I grew up with them, and we all knew it wasn't good. There may have been more, but I wasn't deliberately looking for stress and suffering.

Again, I have mixed feelings about zoos for the conservation aspect. But they certainly aren't paradise. To consider them as such I think actually lends itself to accepting their living conditions and not continuously looking for ways to improve them.

Not to mention people LOVE dinosaurs. Haven't seen a dinosaur zoo yet. A lot of people in my environmental program also haven't been to zoos because they don't support them. Like the love of dinosaurs, they gained their love of animals through books, shows, movies, green spaces, etc.

Zoos aren't my field, but I hope we come up with a better way to get funding and put the animals in captivity rather than the customers first."

I don’t know how to explain it. I think it made me distrustful, and angry, and frightened of humans, humanity. I just thought it was such a gross abuse of power in a way. I think that during that moment we knew that we were not going to eat meat anymore. We said to our parents, “Why didn’t you tell us?” It’s amazing. I remember my mom’s face, I remember her crying. She didn’t know how to answer. It became very obvious we weren’t going to eat meat anymore.

This right here.

This is 100% anecdotal, but as someone who has been across the board from swearing off relationships to desperately searching for ""the one,"" my worst relationships have come from being on either extreme while my best have come from being open to dating but not needing nor avoiding one.

I say this as someone currently single, to be fair, but enjoying life for what it is took practice and...I feel pretty ok being single now. Lonely sometimes sure, but I know I won't settle for someone I don't really work with. I'll find someone who adds to my life, not takes from it.

This is deeper down the line, but even a failed marriage doesn't necessarily mean hopelessness in relationships. My mom, for another anecdote, is grateful for her first marriage because it gave her my oldest brother and led her to her second marriage with a man she still loves 30 years later. She freely admits it was hell in the moment, but looking back she is grateful for the lessons. This is of course barring a spouse becoming a monster in divorce, but that isn't something you can predict beforehand and is ultimately a risk we all choose to take or not when we marry (sorry that was grim).

A major trend in the military is to rush into marriage at a young age for BAH and tricare, and often with people you dont know well enough (holy shit the stories I've heard). That's going to increase the rate of failed marriages for sure. You've got to take your time and even go through failed relationships to figure out your own dealbreakers and tolerances as well as learn who you are marrying.

People in military relationships can go a year without seeing each other or, in the case of my ex, have 2 2-3 month patrols every year (we failed for other reasons, the distance wasnt at all a deal breaker).

People move across the planet for and to be with one another.

If you go into dating with an expiration date you made or an expectation that it will fail, i think you are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Your partner will be able to tell you're planning to end it or not giving it your all because you expect failure. You get good at reading each other like that and feeling when the other person begins deliberately or inadvertently distancing themselves from you.

I'm not suggesting you force a relationship by any means, but I don't think you should force yourself to avoid one either. With the right person, it will click. With the wrong one, it won't. It would be that way whether you were pursuing whatever career you are or not. Even if your career makes the pool smaller, there is still a pool and it will be filled with those who don't consider your decision to be a dealbreaker.
