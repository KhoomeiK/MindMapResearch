The thing is, I think the expectations of perfection are what drags us down, we are extremely imperfect creatures, and the most loving couples i know still struggle some days to make things work, so it's never going to be all lovey dovey 

The way I see it is : the older you get, the more refined of a taste you acquire, the more you understand what you need and what you can deal with in a person, I think that actually increases your chances of eventually finding someone and thinking, ""oh, i feel something here"", but it won't be ""rushed"", it won't be because you're scared of not finding anyone, it will be because you took your time, and really allowed yourself to feel that ""*this is right'* feeling

The father of a coworker of mine was a mafia man, and i owed him something, and in return he wanted me to kill this dude, but i refused and ran away with his daughter (my coworker), we ran away to a fabric market, and asked one of the owners to hide us there because we were being chased by murderers, they refused to hide us but gave me a small vegetable slicer to defend myself.

Murderers show up, vegetable slicer is useless, we continue running till we reach a savannah field, but my friend was acting all weird .. that's when the murderers found us, and it turns out, my friend betrayed me \*dun dun duuun\*, she calmly told me there's no point in running, and i had to go back to her father's (the mafia man) mansion place for my punishment for running away.

At the mansion I found many of my coworkers, all of which were telling me goodbye, everyone, including me, was just accepting my death (because of my imminent execution), it was actually pretty scary there, until one of my coworkers was like .. ""why don't you go to kuala lampur?"", and so I ran to the bus station and got on the first bus to kuala lampur.

On the bus, i befriended a girl who was a prostitute/con-woman, and kept teaching me how to handle myself since I didn't have any money or a passport, she made a scene on the bus then told me to jump off it to avoid the ticket

So i did

and the second I hit the pavement, I got thrown off by a police car .. I was physically okay, the police just reversed a bit and told me ""have a nice day"" and drove off

THEN while i explored the streets of dream kuala lampur with my new prostitute friend, I found all sorts of stalls that sold sheep, except they weren't sheep, they were huge black bananas hidden inside sheep fur, and everyone was haggling for them

and then.. i woke up.."
