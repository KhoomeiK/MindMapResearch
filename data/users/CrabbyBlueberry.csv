pics,fdoe8o5,t1_fdn94e0,1578603500.0,"You can withdraw from your 401k without penalty when you're 59.5 years old. Until then, you can borrow against your 401k, but if you don't put the money back, you'll pay a 10% penalty on early withdrawals.

If you contribute to a Roth IRA, you can withdraw the principal at any time. For example, you could put in $6000 right now for tax year 2019 (you have until April 15, 2020 to do this). In 5 years, that $6000 may have grown to $9000. You can withdraw $6000 of that to make a down payment on a house. You'll have to wait until you're 59.5 to get at the investment earnings without penalty, at which time you won't even pay taxes on that because you paid your taxes when you contributed.

Your 401k is typically limited to whatever mutual funds your employer's plan offers. Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs you can open with any broker, so you'll probably be able to invest in any stock or mutual fund you want. If you've switched jobs at any point in your career, I highly recommend rolling over your old 401ks into a traditional IRA, which you can do without tax or penalty as long as you report it on your tax return.

You can also invest outside of your retirement accounts if you want to save for something shorter term than retirement. That's what I mean when I can say you can start with as little as $100."
