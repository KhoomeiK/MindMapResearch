drums,ffb7dug,t1_ffb5cgu,1579753837.0,"Yeah, that's a new addition too. We'll get a proper setup at some point. One of those is actually one side of a double pedal, but I don't have the correct other side. So that's what he does for now."
drums,ffapjrx,t3_eskjkn,1579741477.0,"I don't mean to say this in a negative way, sorry if it reads that way....  But how the hell does someone who has been playing for 10 years not even give him a listen?  Surely you've had the ""who's the best drummer ever"" type discussions with other musicians, and he has come up every time I'm sure. Did you just assume he was just overrated or something maybe?"
RedHotChiliPeppers,ffaokln,t3_esid7e,1579740824.0,I could listen to this song every day and not get tired of it. Easily in my top 5 favorites.
politics,ff8872o,t3_es6gck,1579668808.0,"Imagine if there was a murder trial, and the jury consisted of friends of the person killed and friends of the person being accused of killing him. Now imagine if before the trial even started, the jury decided on whether or not any actual testimony would be allowed. Whether or not any witnesses would testify. Guess what, whichever person has the most friends in the jury is going to win. Why is this whole system so flawed?  Why isn't there a neutral person deciding what will be allowed and what won't for such a major thing like potentially removing the president from office?"

CPAP,ff26s1l,t3_er6zq2,1579495422.0,I took a bandana and wrapped it around the strap a bunch. That helps quite a bit because it makes it a much wider strap.
IASIP,ff0w89v,t3_er2jik,1579472848.0,I hope they do. It's hands down the best show on television IMO.

RedHotChiliPeppers,fe52hzb,t3_entju5,1578865090.0,"I have a bunch of credit on Google from the rewards app. I bought the audio book version of it basically for free, and just finished listening to it last night. Don't expect a lot of RHCP talk in the book. There is some of course, but for the most part the book is his life right up until they start being a band together. It is very good though, and you're right having Flea read it to you is awesome!"

My first introduction was when my (way cooler than me) older brother was rocking songs like Knock Me Down, and Catholic School Girls Rule. I remember jumping around like a crazy kid to Higher Ground and other classics, and getting excited when they had a new CD coming out, which turned out to be BSSM! They've pretty much been favorite band since then!"
