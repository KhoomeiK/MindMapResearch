Parahumans,ffc6yd1,t1_ffbnjdh,1579792965.0,Labyrinth is also a top tier Shaker though that’s hampered a bit by the fact she’s least lucid when her power is at maximum so she can’t really exploit it that well when it’s working best and when she can think and strategize better her power is weaker.

From what little I know about him, he doesn't seem to be in a particularly bad place mentally. But then again, maybe the stress of leading Parahumanity through *another* apocalypse is getting to him, who knows.

depression,fd43jt2,t3_ejx4cu,1578164071.0,"They don't understand that depression doesn't care about facts. Regardless of how much money, love, support, and safety you may have, your brain is still malfunctioning and making you feel like utter shit. Depression tries its hardest to twist everything against you, magnifying every little flaw and hardship while blinding you to any good things you may have. It takes away all your energy until you can barely move or think."
depression,fd42eea,t3_ejw74l,1578163736.0,"It's a hard feeling to shake, and it haunts me too even though I'm just 24, but know that at the age of 19 you've just started laying the foundations for your future life. Regardless of if you're going to college or working, you've still got many decades ahead of you to try out different paths and see what fits you best. Even if you are in something you don't like for the next 5 years, you'll still be young and you'll have plenty of time to change course in your life. So yeah, like others said, it'd be better to focus on all the years you have ahead of you to do things you want and try new stuff out instead of thinking about what could've been."

Parahumans,fcvsjq2,t1_fct9kjj,1578009137.0,"I could also see your power making you into a sort of Doppelganger. Stranger/Changer would be the primary classification as your power could revolve around you changing your appearance to match that of other people, with a Master power that makes others more likely to perceive you as the real deal and the person you're imitating as the impostor, and on top of that you'd have a Thinker power that would allow you to gain basic information about the person you're currently copying and be able to mentally fill in gaps to better BS your way through their social/work circles."

depression,fcvol2w,t1_fcv1eyv,1578006595.0,"About the house thing, that is not an easy thing anymore. Dunno how old your parents are, but I imagine they got their house pretty cheap when they were young and they still think it should be a simple matter despite housing prices having gone through the roof lately and houses becoming more and more of a luxury rather than a basic good. Nowadays most millennials (including me) are either renting property or staying longer with their parents cause housing's no longer someone everyone can easily afford (especially with student debt), so I think homeownership is not a valid metric to measure someone's success in life despite what your parents may tell you. But that's enough of me pretending to know economics.

About the wanting to go out but having no one to go out with, I have no advice for that so I'll just offer sympathy and say I'm going through very similar things right now regarding my social life."

Still bored out of my mind and not really connecting emotionally to anything. Each day I'm just killing time in the way that takes the least amount of physical/mental effort until it's time to go sleep. Then wake up and do it again. Logically there's things to look forward to in my future and which I know would excite and energize me if I weren't so dead inside, but I don't feel anything one way or another when I think about them.

Honestly surprised I didn't get any Master rating, though the rest of it seems pretty accurate. But then again, trauma from personal losses or toxic relationships would be much better conflict material for shards than frustration at an inability to form meaningful relationships. So I guess it still fits.
