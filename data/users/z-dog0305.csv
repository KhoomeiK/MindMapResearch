depression,fdxt9f7,t1_fdxqt2r,1578772674.0,Could you elaborate on “slips often”. I often slip up myself. Say the wrong thing around people. Do the wrong action. It’s a learning curve. It makes us better.
depression,fdxqn4i,t1_fdxqdy2,1578771892.0,It’s ok to ruffle feathers just as long as we learn from it.

technology,fdvk4r6,t3_en0flu,1578748267.0,This should bring people. The car company has barely turned a profit. The only reason why it’s making money is because of investors. People that’s what we call a bubble. The auto industry is looking like the housing market of 2008!
depression,fdvidk0,t1_fdugj8o,1578747707.0,I get that. I came out as bi in 7th grade and then just gay in 8th it changes who people act around you. But that’s just like parents being dumb and sometimes it’s the kids who are being dumb ab it
