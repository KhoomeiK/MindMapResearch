FrugalFemaleFashion,ffg6xty,t3_etg35u,1579899775.0,"Costco has a two pack for about $12 that I’ve been wearing for about a year now, they show no signs of fading or pilling."
Stretched,ffc4ecv,t3_estsnn,1579791253.0,The increases are so minimal I’m sure it’s the relaxing if the tissue that allows you to go up in size. I got my lobes done about ten years ago and just from natural stretching from earrings I am able to get a 14g in just fine.
bigboobproblems,ffc43oj,t3_esty97,1579791050.0,"As a temporary solution, I’ve sewn a heavy duty fabric (like denim) over the hole. It didn’t help very long since those fuckers poke their way through everything. What brand bras are these?"
piercing,ffa7q6g,t3_esik4k,1579729512.0,"It should just screw off. If it’s proper jewelry, it will be internally threaded (meaning the ball will have a little bit that screws into the bar, with external being the other way around)."
piercing,ffa5gfz,t1_ffa52sz,1579728253.0,"I use those swimmers ear plugs since I really really hate getting it. You can find them at Walmart for a few dollars usually. In a pinch, I held a cotton ball over the canal opening as I sprayed the saline. The ear plugs worked the best for my conch piercing. My sister prefers the cotton ball method. It’s all preference and what you have on hand. I swim a lot, so dedicating a pair to jewelry cleaning isn’t that big of a deal for me."
piercing,ff96suu,t3_esd4g9,1579706192.0,"Make sure you’re not getting saline in your ear canal, as you may be accidentally giving yourself swimmers ear (which causes pain in ear canal and down neck, based off past experience)."

piercing,ff2b62x,t3_er8tj1,1579499350.0,"Re: cost. Every quality shop I’ve been to with titanium jewelry, which is the best to heal with, charges about $20-30 for the piercing itself and another $20-40 for the basic titanium jewelry. Shops will vary, these are just the numbers I’ve seen at a few shops in a few states. Avoid the $20 only shops as the jewelry is typically low quality and sometimes the person isn’t as knowledgeable as they should be."
college,fewqaap,t3_eqt0tv,1579417879.0,"I transferred to a university and was lucky enough to have family that lived nearby with an extra bedroom. I don’t have to pay rent or utilities, but still need to maintain a car, any medical, phone, and “extra” food (which was most of my food, since they primarily ate out while I am at work) 
I have two part time jobs, and honestly I would be struggling really badly if I had to pay rent. There aren’t many jobs available for college students where I’m at, and many of the transportation based jobs (eg instacart, Uber, food delivery) are hard to get since the demand is much lower than the number of drivers."
piercing,fes5p9p,t1_ferz1hn,1579361689.0,This happens to me too. I’ve decided I can’t wear the L shaped studs. I can sometimes get away with the screws if I’m careful but the best jewelry for me has been a hoop (which you shouldn’t put in until it’s completely healed).
college,fejtr9m,t3_epk3nh,1579185652.0,"None. I even looked it up and it is not a thing. If you can’t take another foreign language next year through the high school, see if you can do it at the community college and get credit at the high school."
piercing,fe8mt69,t3_eo5619,1578928059.0,"It will probably close in five hours, depending on how fast your body heals. I know mine would. 
The big issue would be the trauma and the risk of irritation or infection. Might just want to say goodbye to an eyebrow piercing until you are out of school."

torrid,fdj9hh4,t1_fdj9ecb,1578462351.0,Oh! I know we got a pair of boyfriend style capris in. As far as cover ups there are some kimonos and looser dresses. I would definitely check clearance!
torrid,fdj8yvx,t1_fdj8usf,1578461895.0,"I know my store still has some swim suits in clearance, but they’re not in matching sets anymore and they’re uncommon sizes. I would still check and ask your local store when they’re expecting what you need! I know at my store if someone really wants a particular item, we will call them when we get it in. Idk if every store does that though!"
torrid,fdj8raa,t3_elny01,1578461709.0,"I work at torrid. We’re getting swim suits in about a month, and we just got shorts in this week."
college,fdgy3eo,t3_elcmhp,1578411157.0,"Take it slow and don’t be afraid to switch shifts with coworkers so you can have some breather time. I have classes on tuesdays that have me on campus from 8-6, so I told my managers that I will not be available that day. I have really chill managers though, and they put school above work. Take time to breathe, and schedule in homework time at the library or something, then you won’t be cramming after a closing shift."
college,fdevhkg,t3_el0j0f,1578347453.0,"I always stick with Barnes and Noble, amazon, or chegg. Check with your bookstore and see if they’ll price match!"
mealprepsundays,fdcqm9t,t1_fdbwy6f,1578281599.0,"Gotcha, it’s definitely a science of trial and error! I’m still only doing fridge stuff right now, planning on delving into freezer stuff later this month!"
mealprepsundays,fdbrc1i,t1_fdbr5y3,1578260758.0,"I cook what needs to be cooked and let it completely cool to room temp before I put it in the fridge, which cuts down on condensation a bunch! Other than that, I’m just pretty careful about what goes in what container if that makes sense? High moisture foods by themselves, low by themselves, that way everything stays the correct texture (which is a huge factor for me)

EDIT: I just realized you probably meant the water from the ice pack lol
I usually put a paper towel or two around my ice pack."
mealprepsundays,fdbptwr,t1_fdbps0c,1578260021.0,"I’m just super particular about keeping my prepped foods cold until I eat them, it’s totally preference lol"
mealprepsundays,fdb5xqc,t3_ekhyce,1578254160.0,"I would take it cold in a lunch box with an ice pack, then heat it up at the office."
HairDye,fd2ioxk,t3_ejwm6v,1578147801.0,"Depends on what time you want. If you want a really neutral brown, get a red toned brown dye. If you want a warm toned brown, dye it with a diluted red first, then the red toned brow dye. 

Edit: wording"
BuyItForLife,fczwsl3,t3_ejqtlq,1578109957.0,"I found a brand new Ralph Lauren king sized comforter on the side of the road and used it for almost twenty years before it got a huge hole in it. I know they’re pricey, but considering I never used any cover on it and washed it biweekly I would confidently purchase one."
Makeup,fcv7zmw,t1_fcuxfd1,1577996542.0,"It’s been my favorite glue, I’ve tried almost all drugstore and high end and they all lift up in my inner corner by the end of the day except this one. Good luck!"
Makeup,fcunb8o,t3_ej0qo3,1577984657.0,"It helps me a lot to tilt the lashes and look down to put them on, and make sure they’re trimmed properly. They usually need to be shorter than you think. On a regular pair of Ardell Demi wispies I cut off almost two bunches to make them fit my eyes. I suggest getting a glue that stays kind of tacky for a while too, as that helps a ton. My current favorite is [this](https://www.shopmissa.com/products/a-super-lash-glue-dark?_pos=2&_sid=9777b493a&_ss=r) as it is pretty much always slightly tacky and stays on really well. I’ve been in wind and rain storms and my lashes have stayed on haha"

Makeup,fcka6op,t3_ehnjvw,1577720667.0,Keep an eye on Facebook market place and craigslist. I got a set of Alex drawers brand new in box for $40. You can also find full vanities on there for fairly cheap!
drugstoreMUA,fc1zsmm,t3_efqh7e,1577334970.0,"I actually really like the NYX glitter eyeliner. It’s similar to this one in how well it wears, the only downside is NYX doesn’t have as many fun colors, and they all tend to have silver glitter in them. Overall though, a perfect shoe (especially considering the NYX ones can be as low as $5/each at Ulta)"
CrossStitch,fbmhynb,t3_edzgxd,1576984038.0,"There’s a little[tool](https://www.michaels.com/enfile-aiguille-dmc/10357939.html?cm_mmc=PLASearch-_-google-_-MICH_Shopping_US_N_Crafts%26Hobbies_N_N_N_N-_-Crafts+%26+Hobbies&Kenshoo_ida=&KPID=go_cmp-1671307630_adg-66512094604_ad-323727059970_pla-634811286404_dev-m_ext-_prd-10357939&gclid=Cj0KCQiAovfvBRCRARIsADEmbRKtA6FX0Zc9OUwqVqbCrCJkrv-ouDq26XmcJjlYqqascMpUDbWS1egaApRGEALw_wcB)  that DMC makes that makes threading super easy, as you just need to get the thread through a large hole. Most cross stitches actually don’t need you to knot the ends, as you can secure it as you go."
