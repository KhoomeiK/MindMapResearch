facepalm,feea2r6,t1_fee9trq,1579029509.0,Though I do see this shit here in New York. I did spend about two months in Phoenix though and I intend on moving there to marry my girlfriend. It makes even less sense in the case of New York though since we're a northern state.

facepalm,febkd6j,t1_febjqye,1578959688.0,Hey this is nothing new for CNN. They constantly try to downplay candidates like Sanders while acting like idiots like Biden and Buttigeig are serious candidates. They don't even just do this with Sanders they do this same type of shit to Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang.
n64,fe5efg7,t1_fe581ya,1578868372.0,It does do component. Kinda. If you mod your system for RGB there is a company called HD Retrovision who make special component cables for the SNES and N64 which converts the RGB signal to Y-PB-PR component.

n64,fdzorwl,t3_emuwj2,1578792506.0,Grab OoT and Star Fox. I would also recommend Excitebike and Wave Race but you could find those anywhere.
retrogaming,fdw1j7n,t3_emyute,1578754127.0,I'd recommend for DVD cases of you don't have the room for full shelves to store your games try getting some wall mounted DVD towers. I've been using some and they've gone a long way of streamlining my setup. I found it so convinient that I somehow ended up with 6.
