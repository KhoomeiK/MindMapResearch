We will see international famines and mass migrations and then world wars and horrific genocides. All of this will happen as the amount of available land becomes smaller and smaller every year, displacing people living on the coasts or small islands and concentrating all of the chaos.

Billions will likely die from myriad causes connected to climate change. If you think this is like anything we’ve seen before, then you are mistaken.

“What? You're mighty deft. I had the chance to talk with the zoo keepers in charge of the mating, and learned there is a small mating window. You're just a mean person.”




I was making a joke about you trying to get with a rhino... It was meant in a lighthearted manner and I thought it’d be immediately obvious that I was joking.


It is possible that I wasn’t clear enough that the original comment was a double entendres: horny (down to clown) and horny (literally having a friggin horn on their heads) being used with a certain degree of ambiguity in order to create statements where one can be replaced with the other to a humorous effect. This is generally considered humorous because it subverts our expectations of where the conversation would go, creating an alternative interpretation that is frankly ridiculous.


The next comment was humorous in that it took that alternative interpretation to the next level by projecting a mental image of a person trying to get freaky with a rhino, only to be devastatingly rejected. While I understand that humour is subjective, I find this scene to be at least a 7 on the funny scale (out of a possible 8.4 points).
