nvidia,ff3d70y,t1_ff2ttsl,1579538772.0,"Kinda jumping in mid conversation but you have a good point. Even after factoring in cost of hardware, a $60-70 game which brings 20-60 hours of entertainment (depending on the tittle maybe more), It’s a whole lot more cost effective than a night out in the movies. Even if you spend $2000 on hardware every year and say $600 on games, if you have about 10 hours every week to enjoy them (520 hours a year), it’s only $5 an hour.

intel,ff0dbht,t1_fez1oox,1579467828.0,"The only reason a 9900K (or the high tier ryzens) right now is “only better at high fps scenarios” is because there is massive headroom compared to GPU performance. This changes over time as games and graphics evolve. A 2 and a half year old 8700k is just as valid today as 3600x, a tad (5-10% ) faster stock for stock. It will remain valid as long as a 3600x is.  
It did cost a lot more ($360) than the 1600x ($250) which debuted the same year. People who got the 1600x and later planned to upgrade to the 3600 or 3600x ($200-250) now have a cpu which is slightly slower that the old 8700k and $400-450 invested into CPU.  
  
I guess what I’m trying to say is that for gaming and general use we are going to be GPU bound for a long time with 8C CPU’s. My previous 2500k (8 years old) is still semi-valid and I ran a gtx1080 with it. It only really really started to show it’s age in the last couple of years when games started to leverage more threads, like they probably will more so in the future because of 8c/16t Consoles.

That’s when the CPU headroom will help vs going with a 3600 or 9700, it’s not nessisarily about the 15fps today. I wouldn’t recommend grabbing a 9th gen intel unless it’s in the 9900 family. With Ryzen you can of course go for a 3600 and pay and extra 200 in a couple years for a top tier AM4 if the 3600 (or 3700x) bottlenecks new GPU’s. This is considering not waiting for next gen cpu’s to come out."

pcmasterrace,fee8rtm,t1_fedxj0u,1579028742.0,"I’m just astonished to the length that people will go to with their bigotry and assumtions that everyone lives in the same conditions and again your quick “facts” with no support of differences in MTBF with power cycling or not don’t really substantiate your argument. It sounds like people saying don’t turn off the light in the bathroom as turning it on and off consumes more electricity and costs more.

Free heating in the winter, that’s going to need some more math again since my heating is with natural gas, which currently is much cheaper. Currently about 1/4 of the cost of electric heating with nominal rates and further much more cheaper with peak rates. Remember in my circumstances (and millions of other people) peak rates increasing costs is a thing.

To boil it down to the dumbest level. Your saying it’s lower cost to pay the extra say $100 more a year to leave a system on, rather than risk replacing a component which doesn’t like 200 power cycles a year? What would you say is the MTBF oof PC component power cycling? I would guess it’s in the >1000 cycles rather than in the hundreds.  

How would you also weigh in the risk of fire? I did have a DVD drive crap out and melt the PSU wires before protections kicked in and took out a PSU as well. Got home and the apartment smelt burnt. Anecdotal I know and this was at the time I subsidized leaving our PC’s on 24/7 by just keeping my AC like you said a tad higher than the neighbors to get some cooling from them. If I have to pay my 2% deductable to have my house rebuilt because there is a fire, that pays again for a lot of PC’s. $50k is a huge risk.

Also in the winter time the apartment had electric heat, so that is a non-issue if I heat with the PC’s or not. I also kept the apartment cooler in the winter, again to slightly reduce power usage. Your message reads like people are mindless zombies not understanding to look at all aspects.
  
So in closing again, makes no sense in my situation (and millions in my area) to keep 2 PC’s idle when everyone in the house works and has other activities as well. The power draw even at best case scenario’s at 50w hours per PC in the summer adding heat load which needs to be cooled not at 100% efficiency, is still an extra +100 kwh a month ($8 minimum per your number) assuming 90% of the time the PC is not used and a 100% of the time it’s during the day. Say one component fails a year earlier, still not worth spending hundreds on electricity if it costs me one more PSU or motherboard every 5 years.

Further the increased fire risk is not worth it. Which again in apparent with centralized fire alarms and staff on site is less of an issue, but with a house it most likely would burn down before anyone gets too it."
pcmasterrace,fednkga,t1_fed7wbd,1579015846.0,Bad mafs at that
pcmasterrace,fednfs8,t1_fed5f7s,1579015763.0,"Hi, your math is bad and you should feel bad for posting complete garbage and making assumptions rather than asking questions.

You should double the number for wattage consumption firstly since there are 2 systems. Secondly every watt of electricity the PC consumes gets turned in heat, which the AC unit has to cool.

Thirdly, if I have nothing going on why leave equipment to idle? Are you proposing I burn 400w of idle power in, the worst case every hour just so I can save 5 seconds if I happen, or my wife happens to sit at the desktop PC that day? My life doesn’t unfortunately revolve around having enough time every day to do something with the desktops.
So using your math, corrected for amount of PC’s and heat loading it comes out to roughly 3000kwh a year and this is just idle time. I deducted a generous 500kwh since they don’t always idle.

Fourth, As for the price, I use Griddy which has a variable market price depending on supply and demand. This means at peak demand (when I’m at work usually and no one is using the PC’s) leaving a PC’s to idle and rack up 30-50c/kwh doesn’t make any sense and has a proportionally large impact on the bill. I’ve found Griddy a good way to balance my use of power to keep loading down during peaks, it’s also the ecological thing to do and helps the power grid as a whole, though I understand my demand is a drop in the bucket.

I realize a pool takes more power, hence why I run it off peak if I can but sunlight and chemical balance plays into it and I actually do my own pool maintenance (including upgrading pump motor last year to a slightly more efficient one with overall much less power draw, the old one was oversized one size fis all somutio ). HVAC control (Ecobee) and some other devices use Griddy’s IFTTT interface to not run while electricity costs over 10c/kwh.  
  
So now that you have some context, you should understand better why 2 PC’s and turning them off has a impact. This winter I’ve been around the 750-1000kwh mark a month with the pool."
pcmasterrace,feco3rv,t1_febzz6w,1578978827.0,"I used to do that, till I bought a house in a hot climate with a pool and had to pay the power bill. PC’s on 24/7 made a pretty big dent.

Pompeo warned them on Dec 13th to cease hostilities and the base strike was 2 weeks later. Embassy raid a couple of days after that. This strike is a kick in Iran’s nuts for continued hostility. Eye for an eye."
nvidia,fcwtukc,t1_fcvmsfw,1578037377.0,"Same here, I went from a GTX 1080 so kinda a side step on paper but actually feels like a bump. It’s fine, once new cards come out I’ll make the call if I dump another 500-600 into a new card or not. Not worth waiting a year, plus I had pressure to upgrade since my 1080 had other uses."
todayilearned,fcwd4mm,t1_fcvymr3,1578022643.0,"Yup. I’ve lived in the US long enough that going to my childhood home in Finland doesn’t smell quite right for the first few days. Then it goes away. When I return to my own home/house 2-3 weeks later, I always wonder a bit if it’s always smelled so odd in here."
AskReddit,fcw1i35,t1_fcvggiv,1578014976.0,Yup. Leaded glass kinda solved the radiation issue of the very very first CRT’s. And even unleaded ones produced just barely more radiation than a person takes in from background ration every day.
pcmasterrace,fcw0xxt,t1_fcvtrtv,1578014606.0,"Well the 9900k was $420. AM4 is dead after Zen3 so if it matches 9900k in games, or even bests it a little (and that would be a pretty good jump) there’s still no avoiding a new mobo + memory and cpu down the line If you wanted substantially more performance. I guess going to a 3950x would have possibly been an option when their prices dump but again thats buying twice. Figured it didn’t make sense to spend 300 now and 300 with zen3 when the likely outcome is the $420 part will do what I need it to do. By the time 8c 16t are obsolete, there will be something substantially faster available."
pcmasterrace,fcvtnx9,t1_fcvi5kp,1578009853.0,"Here’s hoping. One of the reasons I didn’t go with a 3700x or 3800x is I felt those in my use would have to be upgraded 3-4 years down the line (and the 3900x was more expensive) and while Zen3 might be faster for gaming or match Intel next year, buying 2 CPU’s is a hell of a lot more expensive than one. I’m hoping a high cycle 8c/16t cpu will still have enough grunt to be GPU limited for at least the next 2-3 GPU cycles so 6+ years from now."

Now if he laundered someone else’s money to give the corporation a contract on the premise they would take care of his book deal later, it would be a bit concerning.

pcmasterrace,fcc5u7v,t1_fcalyxp,1577594751.0,Gotcha. Just wondering as with comcast some people ran into outdated modems back a while ago. I buy my own so not too familiar with the issue.
pcmasterrace,fcaic2a,t1_fcacztt,1577569738.0,Is spectrum cable internet? What modem do you have? Just asking if that might be a bottleneck.
pcmasterrace,fcahr11,t1_fca5drl,1577569458.0,"I guess I’m lucky as I’ve always had the advertised speed (on steam, epic, origin and battle.net game loaders anyways with large downloads) plus the +10% over-provisioning. Then again I own my modem so at least that’s not a bottleneck and is much cheeper than paying $10 a month."
DrainTheSwamp,fc2vvw7,t1_fc2ma8n,1577375438.0,"One of the down sides of social media. Kids have more pressure to act grown up as they are much more exposed to what are considered adult themes.
