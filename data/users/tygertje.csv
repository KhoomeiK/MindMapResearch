AmItheAsshole,fd5avhu,t3_ek1zyh,1578175845.0,"ESH. Guns dont go of on their own but if someone doesn't handle it properly it can. It's very dangerous to leave it somewhere where pets of even children can reach it. Your own home, fine. Someone elses? Not okay! What if they didnt check underneath the bed and a 4 yo found it. 

Also. Guns are used to hurt or kill people. When you give someone a gun you give them an easy way to kill you. The owner didnt know you and to hand someone a gun like that you have to trust someone. I think the solution that the cops gave it back to you is the only proper solution in these circumstances. He maybe shouldn't have said you're crazy or whatever and provided the solution that you wait for cops to hand it to you. But if he was truly spooked by the gun he might have felt really intimidated by you.

I sure hope I never meet you, nothing personal, but I like my safety."

AskReddit,fcms36j,t1_fclgv4t,1577789497.0,You can't. No birth control has been proven to be 100% effective. You're making the life of new parents even more difficult and punishing them for being human.
