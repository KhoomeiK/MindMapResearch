fatlogic,fe9lugi,t3_enqy84,1578939269.0,"To be fair, alternatives to BMI measurements like body fat measurements are super helpful to weight lifters/ athletes that would be classified as overweight using (the somewhat overly simple) bmi classification"
fatlogic,fdzci0y,t1_fdypqsr,1578788905.0,Woah I wish!! You must save tons
fatlogic,fdya156,t1_fdy97ij,1578777626.0,I think you mean 10 year old ðŸ˜‚ but at the same time Scandinavian clothes are so pretty

I mostly shop at thrift stores nowadays to minimize plastic waste and it's so weird how I can fit XS all the way through to L in different brands.  thank god for my sewing machine."
AMA,fdy4nnx,t1_fdy2y36,1578776111.0,"oh mood. good luck! go get some portable chargers, thosell be helpful if you like using your phone a lot"
AMA,fdy2pwk,t1_fdy26xn,1578775386.0,"I legit had to google the f to c conversion. that's not bad! I survived by charging my phone at coffee shops, having like 10 blankets and a toque while I slept, and tea lights! 

on another note, what happened?"
AMA,fdy1y8b,t3_encsxu,1578775178.0,lol I just went through this. luckily it wasn't below freezing yet- how cold is it where you are?
fatlogic,fdy1rm5,t1_fdwwwer,1578775112.0,"That's so frustrating! I'd rather wear size 30 than not have clothes at all! I'm a rugby player so I'm built a little larger, and when I fit into size 4 stuff I'm so mad, bc I just know that means that people built smaller than me won't be able to fit into clothes, just so I can wear something that says I'm smaller than I probably am! ðŸ˜¡"
fatlogic,fdu5bol,t1_fdtz57y,1578727816.0,There's so weird! Do you think they shrunk or do you thing the brand started vanity sizing?
AMA,fdjgekv,t1_fdgmf5p,1578469672.0,"Very wise! It feels great to have the weight of your shoulders I will tell you that- I was really physically sick for weeks and as soon as I came out I felt better. It was like a miracle, if you believe in things like that. And you won't be forcing people to pay attention to you! If you feel comfortable in your own skin, it doesn't matter what other people know/don't know about you. Good luck."

AMA,fdftw5f,t3_el4w3l,1578370098.0,"Would you be interested in coming out if it were safe to do so? (I came out while at a religious school, wasn't fun)."
fatlogic,fdejcr8,t3_ekgr6e,1578340260.0,I work out to be a better rugby player! We have plenty of larger people in rugby (mostly props) but they still workout- just mostly strength training!
AMA,fb3jcor,t3_ebaw20,1576475123.0,Will I get a family?
