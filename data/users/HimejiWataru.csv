Reddit is an extremely similar concept in that it's meant to be a website/app you curate towards your personalized interests.

Do you even see what's happening in the video you linked? The doe leaves alone the animal that's actually touching her fawn to charge the dog who's minding its own business. The doe attacked the dog because it perceived it to be a natural predator (like a coyote). It's extremely common for deer to not get along with dogs. Notice how it was wary of, but didnt attack, the cat. A doe wouldn't attack a human either. Deer do not perceive humans as predators unless explicitly cornered (and even then bucks are the ones that are more prone to attack).
