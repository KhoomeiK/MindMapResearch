offmychest,feypzta,t3_eqwcv8,1579449076.0,"The real sign of getting over someone is not caring. One day the thought of writing an ode to him won’t occur to you. When you hit that day, you won’t celebrate because you won’t care. I think you’re making good steps to get there, though."

unpopularopinion,fdw47kk,t1_fdplgoc,1578754829.0,"I was trying to add to your point. Celebrity new (a Kardashian gets married) is different than when a celebrity comments on real news or current events (a Kardashian tells us why Bernie Sanders isn’t fit for office). Both are not interesting to me, but comments from celebrities about current events really irk me."
unpopularopinion,fdpl4yp,t3_emhb60,1578631657.0,"I hate it when legit news reports on what a celebrity (actor, singer, etc) had to say about a political event or policy. Why should we listen to him? Because he pretended to be someone else in a movie?"
AskReddit,fdhv31a,t1_fdh9m7u,1578430672.0,I got my comment removed with a warning for questioning an obviously fake post on r/childfree.  I made a snarky comment back and then got banned for 5 days.
offmychest,fdgu27n,t3_el969u,1578408328.0,Can you see a therapist? I’m not sure we’re qualified to give advice with something so heavy. Sorry for your pain. He’s a terrible person.
science,fdcqmge,t3_ekmj1w,1578281603.0,"My coworker wore a hyper-short mini skirt, thigh-high pointy boots, and either kitty stockings or she has some kitty tattoos way up high. I work at an engineering firm. I admit, my face looked like I smelled a rotten fart when I saw her. It’s not jealousy for me, I just think some people try to get by on sex appeal at work and I don’t respect it. Maybe I’m just too old?"

offmychest,fcc6bvr,t3_eh1fiy,1577594910.0,"My parents also didn’t want me (teen pregnancy) but kept me and love me now. Their circumstances kept them from wanting me, not anything to do with me. It's the same for you! You're lucky you have love and a family."
atheism,fcbxgff,t3_eh0rd7,1577592053.0,Why don’t you ask him? We can’t know what he thinks. Good luck.
mildlyinfuriating,fc9765f,t3_egp3t7,1577548115.0,I used to give money to homeless people but now I never do because of this. I give my money to organizations who help the homeless instead. Where I live many make “camps” around town that look like the dump when they’re done.
