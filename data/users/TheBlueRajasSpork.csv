OurPresident,fepkef1,t1_fenqdb9,1579322792.0,You should spend like literally 30 seconds learning about the things you talk about.
CollegeBasketball,fe5mbz1,t3_envdhm,1578871314.0,"Never in doubt. On to the next one. 


^Cries ^in ^22 ^turnovers"
CollegeBasketball,fe5d3lu,t3_enshxj,1578867892.0,This offense is beyond broken.
CollegeBasketball,fcn6vgh,t1_fcmcdtl,1577804821.0,"If it was only the “Fuck Tubby” snapchat, I’d agree with you but he burnt all of his Memphis gear after he left. That’s disrespecting the program so I can see why people would want to boo him."
CollegeBasketball,fcm5s52,t3_ehxh05,1577764963.0,I totally forgot KJ Lawson existed there for a while. And I’m going to go right back to it.
CollegeBasketball,fcm2i5u,t3_ehvat9,1577762530.0,I think people forgot we had a second lottery pick up our sleeve
churning,fckpn2o,t3_ehk9tb,1577730473.0,I have a one week Hyatt stay coming up this week and I’m trying to decide whether to upgrade P2’s legacy Hyatt card to the new Hyatt card. She has the 5k point upgrade offer. Probably worth it? Total hyatt spend will be around $900. She’s well over 5/24 so probably won’t be applying for the new Hyatt card outright anytime soon.
awardtravel,fck6394,t3_ehf5zd,1577717636.0,Hyatt Place Waikiki is perfectly adequate if you don’t want to spend a lot of points. Short walk to the beach and plenty of food and drink options around. Breakfast was fine and there’s a pool there. We got upgraded to a corner room with a beach view and that was nice. It’s no red carpet hotel (negative to the beautiful room and luxury pool) but it was fine all around. The breakfast had kimchi and miso soup which was interesting.
PoliticalHumor,fcfvkbw,t1_fcfq0k6,1577634153.0,Do you have any 80 year old family members?
PoliticalHumor,fcfvbiy,t1_fcfh83a,1577634072.0,"Other than the $20 billion dollar fine on top of the $28 billion BP spent on clean up, you’re totally right."
churning,fcbouu1,t1_fca5jle,1577589333.0,Mostly Amex and Barclays
churning,fcbotb6,t1_fcb7imy,1577589319.0,Not many of us super risk averse churners apparently. CP is way too valuable to me to risk the 0.001% chance.
churning,fc9ad3b,t3_egpl4n,1577549604.0,"Is anyone else working toward CP renewal but too scared to finish off the spend requirement until 1/1/20? I have $70 left on my SW business card and the statement closed on 12/6. I know I’m safe to hit the minimum spend now because the points won’t post until the statement closes next month but I can’t help myself but wait. My SW personal card’s statement closed yesterday and I have $350 left on that but I’m probably going to wait until 1/1 to hit that one too. Just way too risk averse to do it. The minute I hit the spend, Chase is going to change their policy and post the points as I swipe the card just to spite me."
worldpolitics,fc92dll,t1_fc91xib,1577545914.0,Maybe something that isn’t Bernie Sanders?
facepalm,fc8zjp9,t1_fc8xjgq,1577544613.0,That’s quite the false dichotomy. Having zero faith in Bernie’s ability to get a constitutional amendment passed =/= do nothing about it.
worldpolitics,fc8x0xx,t3_egpent,1577543432.0,I suppose today is the day I unsubscribe to this subreddit.
facepalm,fc8wx58,t1_fc8whf8,1577543372.0,"A constitutional amendment is passed by the House, the Senate and 3/4ths of state legislatures. It has nothing to do with the president. If Bernie wanted to overturn Citizens United, he’s better positioned to do so in the Senate than as a president. But talk is cheap and “Bernie would pass a Constitutional Amendment” sounds just grand."
facepalm,fc8v97d,t1_fc8rrsn,1577542565.0,How is he going to overturn a Supreme Court case?
churning,fc5xzr2,t1_fc5xp0a,1577468236.0,Turns out I’m not targeted but thanks for the heads up
churning,fc5lhm3,t1_fc5j002,1577460768.0,What is this 25% bonus?
CollegeBasketball,fbyav5z,t1_fbxvhlz,1577212319.0,Doesn’t look like anything to me.
CollegeBasketball,fbwpyx3,t1_fbuw0or,1577156342.0,The defense has been a really pleasant surprise. Offense leaves a lot to be desired though.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fbtikyq,t1_fbtgyed,1577080189.0,What part of “sounds about white” is racist to you? They aren’t saying this is stuff white people do. They are saying this is the leniency white people are treated with.
