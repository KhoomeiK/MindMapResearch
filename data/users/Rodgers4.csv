movies,ff9qewy,t1_ff94wsc,1579718677.0,"This is so true.  I’ve fired similar rifles and they’re not the most easy when laying down and shouting at a sitting target 25 yds away.  Hitting a moving target while standing/running at 50-75 yds is going to be very tough!  Plus, these are 18-22 year old kids with little training."
movies,ff7um9z,t1_ff6x9vp,1579658749.0,"I agree but I can’t imagine going into a movie completely blind either.  Sam Mendes doing a WWI flick should sell itself but I can’t watch a movie on the billing alone.  The alternative would be reviews which give away just as much as trailers if not more (wouldn’t have known the single-take from the trailer).

I agree it’s annoying but it’s also hard to pick a movie with no trailer or reading reviews or you’re gonna watch some crap in your pursuit."
nfl,ff5dvvc,t3_erpd5q,1579588757.0,The interesting thing about losing to Kyle Orton & the Chiefs was that we beat Kyle Orton pretty handily earlier that year...when he was the Broncos starter.  What a weird and unexpected revenge game for him.
Huskers,ff5bip1,t1_ff4zrs1,1579586240.0,He needs to go the Venables route & realize he’s a bit of a nutcase who just wants to coach and be a crazy person without all the ancillary head coach glad-handing & responsibility.
Huskers,ff5bdp5,t1_ff4un0d,1579586100.0,"The scheme is good, it’s a pro scheme, but it requires pro-talent or just really high football IQ players.  When we had one or both the D was a monster."

Huskers,feoexrm,t1_feo9osp,1579299142.0,"Any reason to expect Held would be a good OC?  He’s a good position coach & recruiter, doesn’t say anything about OC skills.  Plus then he’d be too involved in game plans to recruit."
nfl,fen8xmb,t1_fen71mb,1579279549.0,"Yeah but those sites are notoriously off.  Hell, it says AB’s net worth is 30m.  I would be absolutely shocked if he has even half of that currently."
nfl,fem47z8,t1_fekk4am,1579239208.0,"I could be completely off base here but I question the net worth of a lot of NFL agents.  NFLPA has a hard cap of 3% and an agent like Rosenhaus spends a lot of cash on his clients for training, transportation & any number of things plus he’s basically a company that has to pay for staffing, lease, bills, etc.  

He has a ton of clients but it also takes a lot of contract money to make a little, for example that 40m for AB would only net him 1.2m, then figure taxes & all expenses...

Again, I am too lazy to research but I wouldn’t be surprised if they have to work to keep up the lifestyle.  Hell, Lee Steinberg, who Jerry Maguire/Bob Sugar was based off of, is broke."

CFB,fdyoaid,t1_fds1e3f,1578781892.0,This is exactly the case.  At Nebraska we’d have a team like NIU get a 7pm CDT kick.  So I’m expected to miss the end of the good 2:30 games and all of the evening slate to watch some blowout I’m not interested in.  I’m surprised we still sell those worthless games out.
Huskers,fdr7p1v,t1_fdhu2as,1578680648.0,I don’t mean to be ‘that’ guy but for future reference it’s ‘beaucoup’.
Huskers,fdr7cun,t1_fdhn4j5,1578680534.0,Just curious.  Held’s one of our better recruiters.  Is there any reason you want him at OC?  I’d as soon leave him as a position coach and bump his pay.
Huskers,fdr74ja,t1_fdnp70i,1578680402.0,"I’m not sure if you follow other teams or not but this is plenty average, if not a little less.  Some players want to play.  Hell, three of the four QBs in the playoffs were transfers."
AskReddit,fdp7asq,t1_fdp42w1,1578621672.0,"I know, it really makes no sense.  I think both sides are so deep into their own sound chambers they can’t possibly conceive why the majority of the country may not agree with them (on either side). 

It’s like me saying “everyone I know feels X way” when I’m really referring to my & my friends’ opinions."
AskReddit,fdp2x7s,t1_fdp27ht,1578618729.0,"That’s the craziest thing to me.  If they rolled out a moderate candidate they would probably get elected fairly easily but with many of the candidates now they’re so far left it scares off a large chunk of moderate voters on both sides . 

I have no idea why they don’t push a moderate candidate and throw party support behind them.

Edit:  of all the downvoted comments I’ve made, this one seems most baffling.  It’s not even controversial, it’s pretty close to factual."
todayilearned,fdf41yd,t1_fdeobdy,1578352821.0,"I’m confused why he expected that money at the end?  I don’t think it’d be reasonable to expect a 25% reward (or any reward) for saying “sorry, this investment won’t work” be it criminal enterprise or legit bank."
nfl,fdekw7t,t1_fde13l8,1578341193.0,"It varies but Glazer’s (and other connected reporters) sources are anyone from high-up FO people, agents, coaches, players & even the owners themselves.  

As to why they leak the news it really depends on what the leak is.  A hire like this was likely leaked from McCarthy’s agent directly.  He would do this as a favor to Glazer for talking up other players to his FO sources, or maybe they’re just friends and he wanted to give him the scoop. 

There’s typically an ulterior motive for the leak but sometimes people just like talking."

movies,fdcc1d6,t1_fdc99lb,1578271296.0,"I see your point, but, for me, seeing DeNiro alone and worn down in a home wasn’t any more impactful than Liotta bored in a tiny midwest town, Denzel going to jail, or any surprise murder/finale to other mob movies.  Scorsese didn’t reinvent the wheel in my opinion.  Many/most showed the negatives of that life."

movies,fdc7o5y,t1_fdc5jjw,1578268706.0,"Honestly I don’t think it added anything to the genre, it reminded me of every other period mafia piece but wasn’t paced as well or had any sense of stake."
movies,fdc6261,t1_fdbs0o7,1578267815.0,"Interesting.  Was there any particular reason why?  Personally I felt The Irishman was a copy of Casino/Goodfellas/etc. only paced slower, but many people loved it, so different tastes for everyone I suppose."
AskReddit,fdbsbtj,t1_fdb2s7i,1578261177.0,I think at some point it just becomes the thing you do because it’s what you’ve always done.  Maybe look into other weekend activities?  Don’t have to keep the same routine.
AskReddit,fdbhqes,t1_fdabnna,1578257528.0,I’m probably way OOTL on this but don’t many video games have features locked from the beginning until they’re earned?  Does this just usurp that by letting you buy the features instead of earn them?

In fact, quite the contrary, it says they were just like-aged people who shared the same beliefs and drew from the same anti-Semitic literature.

I don’t see any backing to your bold claim."

CFB,fcuxig5,t1_fcuq0l9,1577990510.0,That’s kinda unfair since every team but Ohio (where his dad coached) and tOSU (where his dad called in a favor) didn’t offer him.  It wasn’t like he had a top ten of blue bloods but was holding out for that NU offer.

nfl,fc4o3bq,t1_fc4nzem,1577422500.0,I’m talking strictly about life after football.  Make 250k for the next 2-4 years then tell me how the next 50+ years of retirement withdrawals looks.
nfl,fc4mzxy,t1_fc4fc7y,1577421524.0,"It’s not as much as you think.  A million/year after taxes and agent fees is a little less than 500k, then I would assume he losses 40-50% of that on child support alone, so he’s at 250k each year before other expenses.  Until he’s out of the league in a few years.  It would be hard to put any of that away for him and even then the 401k earnings would put him square in lower/middle class.  

Maybe he’s been contributing to his 401k throughout his career as well, which would help.  He’ll never be broke because his NFL pension will still provide him a few 100k each year, however."
