worldnews,fehda0k,t1_fegaak4,1579114180.0,"I haven’t read scripture in a while, but it was Jesus who blinded Paul in the road to Damascus because he was going to persecute Christians there. It wasn’t until Ananias is told by God to heal Paul that Paul is healed, becomes filled with the Holy Spirit, baptized, and is converted.

OK research completed now time to analyze the joke.

The joke then seems like it is saying that Trump has been blinded by God, and that he should visit Syria where he will be converted.

Then like some kind of comedy genius Putin adds another layer to the joke, as crazy as that concept is, that Trump would jump at the chance to visit and that he will arrange it. 

So yes again you are correct in the fact that there is no explicit stating of Putin saying “I own you Trump” or  “Trump has to do everything Putin says lol”. What is present is to world leaders feel comfortable enough to joke about how they can suggest things to Trump and he will just do them. 

“Reddit” doesn’t so much as have a hard on for shitting on Trump as much as it is a place for discourse. There are plenty of shit on Trump subreddits though, but this isn’t particularly one of them. 

If you want to hear nothing but positivity about Trump and go back to the_donald. Go back to 4chan, Go back to the echo chamber of what you wanna hear. Isn’t that one of Trump’s main messages? “If you don’t like it here. Leave.”

Also, calling me pathetic does nothing but make you look like an asshole."

worldnews,fedx3nz,t1_fedvc0c,1579021732.0,"The point of the Fox News article was to show you that they were indeed laughing at Trump. 

In our debate I gave you two pieces of evidence, one a quote from OPs article about the conversation said (the one that says Putin can tellTrump what to do) and two the Fox News article confirming the conversation and the joking did happen. This was a response to your question about how joking is the same as saying Trump is Putin’s puppet. 

Then you shifted the debate away from the “puppet question” to argue that I didn’t quote the Fox News article. 

I responded that nope I didn’t it was the OPs article. Then gave my *interpretation* of how a joke can also show manipulation of one person over another. 

I mean you can scroll up it’s all there, I understand you are answering a bunch of inbox messages. 

So far we disagree on the interpretation of the conversation, judging on your other comments, manipulation of Trump by Putin needs to be EXPLICITLY-stated or else it didn’t happen. Am I correct about your stance?

What would it take to prove it to you? I don’t think I can prove it personally, but I wonder if it’s even possible. 

If not the we can agree to disagree and move on."

Assad: Aw man there’s some white dog poop. 

Putin: I bet we can get Trump to eat it. 

Assad: Lol that would be great. 

Putin: I bet he would jump at the opportunity, and if not I will tell him to and he will eat it. 

Both: *chuckle*"
