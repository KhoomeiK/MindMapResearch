fatlogic,ffe0lqr,t1_ffdbycl,1579833609.0,"Exactly. I had a busy day and had only eaten about 450 calories all day before hitting the gym. Afterwards, I didn’t feel like cooking (and my husband and kids left the kitchen a mess) so I got an Impossible Whopper and had 2 pieces of chocolate, and was still under my calorie limit for the day. I don’t do that all the time (it’s still crap food), but I love the freedom of CICO."
CICO,ff7wkjr,t1_ff7srsp,1579660068.0,"True. As long as you don’t get dependent on stimulant laxatives, you should be fine. And some people don’t poop every day....and that’s ok. You should get concerned with a sudden change in bowel habits (with no discernible cause, like dietary changes) or new onset of (ongoing) abdominal pain, bloating, etc."
CICO,ff7rogl,t1_ff7r1qz,1579656718.0,"As an RN, I can attest to this. If you rely on laxatives (esp mag citrate), you can pretty much guarantee you won’t be able to poop without it when you’re older. You are better off upping water and fiber."
fatlogic,feygrtc,t1_feyeh38,1579445321.0,"I still get stuck in that trap sometimes. I went out for dinner with my parents and ordered a grilled salmon salad. I really didn’t think it would too terribly bad, esp since I was light on the oil based dressing. I only ate half of the salad, but when I roughly calculated the calories in MFP, I was shocked to see that half of the salad was about half of my daily intake. There were 300 calories in half the salmon alone! It was a really eye opener for me."
fatlogic,fey5phs,t3_eqvvrb,1579441151.0,"“Underreporting” is the PC term for “flat-out lying”.

I can see underreporting 100 calories or so, if you don’t report the small amounts of oil used to prep food (and that’s still a significant amount when you look at weekly caloric intake totals), but 1000 calories a day? 

Then again, people truly don’t have any concept of what is in the food they are eating. I stick around 1,200 cal/day when cutting. People are shocked when I show them what I eat in a day. It’s not that much food. You really don’t need that much to thrive and be healthy."

STRUFFOLI DOUGH
	•	412 g flour
	•	0.75 teaspoon baking powder
	•	pinch salt
	•	75 g unsalted butter (melted)
	•	1 zest orange
	•	2.75 tablespoons sugar
	•	Juice of one orange (~3 tablespoons or so)
	•	3 eggs
TOPPINGS
	•	300 g honey
	•	sprinkles
	•	slivered almonds, candied fruit 


Instructions
	•	In a large bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder and the salt, then add the butter, orange zest, sugar and orange juice, start to combine with a fork until crumbly.
	•	Add the eggs one at a time and mix to combine, when almost combined move the mix to a lightly floured flat surface add an extra 1 - 1/2 tablespoons flour and knead together to form a soft dough.  Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for about 30 minutes. (Add a little more juice if the dough is still crumbly when kneading, but not too much. The dough will come together more as it rests)
	•	Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface (Sometimes I don’t need to flour the surface at all) and roll into thin ropes 1/4 inch in diameter.  Cut to make small cubes and roll each cube into a ball slightly smaller than a marble (a bench scraper works best for cutting the dough). Try to make them all the same size (they will puff up a bit when fried).
	•	In a medium pot add 2-3 inches of oil and heat to 350°F, add the struffoli (in batches) turning a couple of times and when golden drain on a paper towel lined plate and let cool. It will only take a few minutes. While one batch was cooking, I rolled and cut another batch. 
	•	While struffoli are cooling, heat the honey in a small saucepan until warm and slightly watery, about 3-5 minutes. Place the cooled Struffoli in a large bowl and cover with the honey. Add sprinkles, slivered almonds, and diced candied fruit, as desired. 
	•	Then form the honey balls into desired shape, dome, donut, pyramid.  (I just dumped it on a plate and topped with candied cherries). Let the finished Struffoli sit until the honey solidifies (approximately 1 1/2 - 2 hours) and then serve.  Enjoy!"

I adapted this recipe for the cake and buttercream. I upped the servings to 16 and used 2-8 inch pans instead. 

I didn’t have chocolate for the buttercream, so I mixed 1/4 cup of brewed coffee, about 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder and a touch of heavy cream in a measuring cup. Once all the butter was incorporated in the meringue, I added that and 1.5 tablespoons of instant espresso powder until I got the right taste/consistency to the frosting. 

Instead of the ganache drip, I used crumbled cake crumbs to decorate."

Your progress may be slow...you may fall off the wagon a time or two, but please be kind to yourself. We have all fallen off the wagon. What’s important is getting back on track and staying the course for the long term. 

This is not a diet! You are teaching yourself healthy food habits that will optimize your health. If you think of it as a diet and look at your results in the short term, it will be harder to maintain success. 

Good for you! You can, and you will!"
