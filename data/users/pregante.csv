Edit: The name of the street/ plaza"

Is the inside of the back diffrent in any way from the side? If so, the red tip could be plug the hole were the glue comes out. And the inside is forced out with pressure and maybe heat."

We talk about a 3 year old!!!

Imprisoned for being born in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's the saddest fucking thing that a 3 year old has to spend his birthday in detention and can't even get a fucking card to cheer him up. 

What a sick world."

europe,fc7xhze,t1_fc7rq3s,1577521248.0,"It is more complicated than that, at least in general (I don't know any specifics about Montenegro).

Church property, like property of past ruling families and nobility was in many cases acquired with public money in a non-secular time. So with the modern state coming into power the publicly founded buildings should fall into the new representing power of the public a.k.a. the state. This is the argumentation in France and other countries.

The obvious problem is, that this only works if it's used as a general rule, concerning all churches. In a lot of countries there is still a close connection between some sort of state church (in Europe always Christian) and the government. The EU fights for secularization between them tho."

Solid argument, not fearing war anymore."

But I totally get where you coming from. A fair deal to artists should be a given and I will try to consider this going forward."
