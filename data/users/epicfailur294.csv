I think a MOC might be in order..."

lightsabers,fguwjth,t1_fgtd4pa,1581131024.0,I’m assuming he probably made it. It’s tagged as a build and I’ve personally looked pretty hard for any prebuilt pikes and haven’t found any. If I had to guess I’d say he built it with saberforge parts as that would be the easiest way I’ve found.

facepalm,fgfsnas,t1_fgfhjgi,1580746715.0,"Definitely not 100% true. I’m super far right (like quite a bit further right than your average conservative), and being in the military most of my friends are around the same political mindset as well, but most of my friends back home are liberal. I’ve definitely had conversations with my conservative and liberal friends alike about some of the more far out crap that I’ve seen from my party (for instance, Global Warming is scientific fact, not a matter of opinion...). One thing I have been asked by my liberal friends is why I don’t openly criticize Trump especially when they know my mindset, and the simple answer is that being in the military I’m literally not allowed to openly criticize my commander in chief, or any prior one for that matter (the idea is two fold: open criticism could cause dissent in the ranks as he is at the head of literally everyone’s command structure, and that no branch of service wants a single person’s views to be misconstrued as the official opinion of the branch as a whole). I have noticed though that generally my liberal friends tend to consider and criticize personal character far more than my conservative friends who don’t really care about the dumb bs as long as there is what they consider to be sound policy being passed."
legostarwars,fg9y7ak,t1_fg820b5,1580644474.0,"Personally I prefer the CAC P2 helmets. The LEGO P2 helmets look off to me and I think it’s because of the long “nose” if you will at the front of the helmet. The air hose attachments in the front-bottom of the helmet don’t stick out as far, which I think looks better and feels closer to movie accurate."

funny,fg3pa0u,t1_fg3gou3,1580486734.0,I think it was about this time last year that there was a whole week or so in Midwest Wisconsin where the high temps didn’t go above -37 degrees Fahrenheit... there were a couple days where it’d be the middle of the afternoon and the temperature was like -53...

legostarwars,ffbxoi1,t1_ffbj3zk,1579786103.0,"I do think though that Cody’s helmet was slightly different from the standard. At least it looks different in TCW, though it’s not quite as drastic as with these minifigs. Unfortunately I can’t find any good photos or screenshots to support this, so I could be wrong."
legostarwars,ffbwbum,t1_ffbhd7b,1579784918.0,"Not sure how he did it, but it is possible to build a parts list outside of the BrickLink website and then upload it to the site. I’ve never done it because the few MOCs that I’ve done have been very small and the part count just doesn’t warrant the process, but it would definitely be an easier process than finding each part individually for larger MOCs such as this. Often times custom instructions for purchase will come with a parts list like this too for easier parts purchase."

facepalm,fek89vx,t1_fejy20r,1579194681.0,"Don’t think about buying new, but used. If a used car comes in and the keys are in rough shape then the dealership will order new keys from the manufacturer, and a lot of times for convenience will cut a key out of blanks that they have on hand for the interim. Sometimes dealerships will also cut keys specifically for their own use regardless of the condition of the keys that came in with the car. These are usually used for driving the car between the dealerships. I know when I bought my used Malibu, the first key I got was one that the dealership had cut, and about a week later I got the original key that shipped from the location that the car originated from. Alternatively, if the car was previously owned by anyone relatively car savvy who wanted the convenience of that key-fob combo, they could have bought a blank and had it cut, or cut it themselves. Considering that regardless of who owns what, VW key fobs are compatible with Porsche vehicles so it’s completely feasible that that key runs that car."

I got this set over Christmas and put it together almost immediately. I could not be happier with it.
