CasualConversation,ff6yrnc,t3_es02ye,1579637657.0,"Don’t give up so easily. Let people know your dream. Maybe your girlfriend’s opinion would surprise you. Optimistically, does your career/source of income transfer over there well enough? That’s one thing to consider, but there are always ways to make these things work if you really want it. Look into it. Try to see if it will work. Nothing will happen on its own. It’s your future. Norway *can* be your home. This is possible."
CasualConversation,ff6kn2r,t3_ery6pz,1579629228.0,"Maybe it’s in reverence to the fact that your loved one is still alive? Sounds morbid but not everyone has a mom, etc. still alive. “Congratulations on another year with your dad!” No idea if that’s the explanation but that’s one way to see it."
CasualConversation,ff6javb,t1_ff6i4ip,1579628410.0,"It’s definitely possible to have friends like that! Just have to communicate about it directly if it doesn’t happen super naturally, or else you risk leading them on or making them uncomfortable. Maybe “cuddle buddies” is a good nickname for it? Just don’t whisper sweet nothings in their ear and you’re good."
CasualConversation,ff6iduw,t3_erxki8,1579627850.0,"Sounds like you’re processing things healthily before a transition. It’s good to look back at the good and bad, you can learn a lot about yourself reflecting on the past in a balanced way. Do you feel differently now about any of your experiences than you did while they were happening?"
CasualConversation,ff6hxem,t3_erxv54,1579627572.0,Maybe get some of that through a loving dog or a friend who’s comfortable with platonic physical affection?

CasualConversation,ff6ahio,t3_erwfq9,1579622912.0,"Maybe I’m being too optimistic but it sounds like he’s fucking with you or just trying to get attention. Some people just want to feel special by making those kind of claims, like they somehow know better or see beyond the veil. Or maybe he’s just a prick trying to rile people up. I say ignore completely and give him the indifferent, cold shoulder that nonsense deserves."

CasualConversation,fen9dts,t3_eq2v2i,1579279822.0,"I don’t know what you do or how much you make, but don’t quit until you find another job. Even if it’s stupid and an annoying cut of your time, 2 days of work is no big deal and brings in a consistent amount of money while you look for another job. I don’t see any advantage to quitting without something else lined up."
CasualConversation,fen83ho,t3_eq2nzh,1579279035.0,"I don’t like loud venues in general, so. I do have a good time drinking but I do it pretty sparsely. It’s not something I’d want to do all the time, feels like a crutch otherwise. It’s kind of a turn off when people constantly want to drink/smoke, etc. to have a good time."

CasualConversation,fen13fp,t3_eq0xvt,1579274611.0,"Sounds like you’re in college.

Compared to me in college (I did well): 

You sleep more (it’s great you get good sleep, don’t change this (but you could probably get away with less)) I would average probably 6 hours a night

You study a LOT. I would only study as much as needed to feel prepared, and 7 hours for each class a week would be major overkill. Is that really necessary? I tried to be as efficient as possible with studying, and saved a lot of time.

Morning routine taking an hour may be a girl thing, but either way, I bet you could speed this up (if you’re desperate for more time).

What’s your commute like and what extra-curricular activities do you do?"

CasualConversation,fektoy0,t3_epp5e5,1579207389.0,"The best way sometimes to learn what you want to do is to learn what you don’t want to do, even if that means actually trying something and realizing it’s not for you. 

Imagining and doing makes a big difference. You’ll want to know the people, culture, daily life, and bullshit of a job/career to know if you want to do it, because for a lot of people dealing with that shit is the brunt of the job. 

Most people I talk to just sort of end up somewhere. Consider that even having an idea of what you want usually leads somewhere else, anyways. 

Anything you know of that you feel you’d have an okay chance of getting in the door with? Start there and see what you learn about yourself. Pay attention to what you like and don’t like/how you work on the job. That will help.

Sorry for the messy advice."

If you regret getting shy next time it happens try to keep talking - I’m sure your English is good enough and a lot of people will find the effort endearing which will make them like you even more. If you feel bad just tell them you’re French and if you don’t understand something just be honest and have a good humor about it. Have fun!
CasualConversation,fek7m3s,t3_eplxta,1579194288.0,"So instead of imagining everyone else naked, imagine *yourself* naked, and then, uh... uh..

I think you just have to do it and slowly get used to it, as you seem to have already experienced. Just be prepared and remember that it’s an extremely common fear that everyone relates to, if that thought helps."
depression,fek4un8,t3_eplg9c,1579192641.0,"Yes I can relate. All this shit is ridiculous but it’s also amazing. What are the odds that knitting came into existence as just some chill activity for old smart-apes. Personally I find it’s about seeking what you value and find meaning in, and pursuing that while in combination learning to be *humble* and not being horrified that we’re not above wearing t-shirts with anthropomorphic sharks with sunglasses on a surfboard to pretend we’ve been to an island. Find beauty in the absurdity. We are lucky to be experiencing anything more than a dot of light and an undying drive to consume food and fuck. We are capable of appreciating, creating, experiencing so much complexity and emotions, while also still shitting into the ground like every other beautiful animal on this awesome, horrifying, absurd planet infested with evil, parasitic, but somehow lovable human beings like you and me. Cut us some slack and enjoy the ride, I say."

I’m sure even they’re intimidated by how they look on tv. If you had all the same you would be surprised at how great you’d look as well. Real life is different, and in my opinion, even more beautiful. I promise you there are plenty of men who would be attracted to tour features and body, we can be quite good at that. They don’t see you how you currently see yourself, what they see is much better than you give yourself credit for, and I hope one day you can appreciate your body as much as they do/will."

CasualConversation,fek0api,t3_epl0mi,1579189858.0,"I had a similar situation but got badly concussed on the first night. Was very excited about the trip and was feeling great and then WHAM. Didn’t even know where I was and had a few minutes of memory until the next day. Tore up my hands and had other injuries all over my body. Spent the rest of the trip taking it slow, trying to recover, and enjoying/doing the most I could. I was super heart broken, though. It’s kind of bittersweet, but I still have fond memories of the trip. I was with my girlfriend and family and it was nice how caring they were. Accidents happen! Focus on the good times you already had and I hope you recover well."
self,fejyedg,t3_epkhml,1579188671.0,"Do what you like and makes you more comfortable. Things like that come down to style, and while it may be a bit effimanate now, there’s nothing wrong with having some feminine qualities, and one day shaving your legs and polishing your nails could be the stylish thing for men to do, you never know. Most modern men do things now that would be considered very effeminate not too long ago. My point is it’s a little arbitrary at that level and you should just own it and not worry about doing something a little uncommon. Maybe you’ll be part of starting a new trend for men. Who knows. 

Also, the shaving thing is very common with certain types of athletes so that alone makes it not really that peculiar."
CasualConversation,fejxer2,t3_epkciy,1579188044.0,"If you have a really strong passion for it, go for it. You will have to move a lot for your career, and be in a lot of isolated places. Getting experience in the field/outside of class will be really important (but fun and rewarding) and everyone you work with will be equally compassionate and passionate about it. Pay may not ever be very good, unless you work your way up towards landing the right jobs (like climbing rank moving between zoos if that’s your interest). It’s a very meaningful career but difficult and a bit hardcore if you go all the way (which would be recommended). It will be really difficult having to come to terms with how fucked everything is, but the small part you have to help will be rewarding, but may never feel enough. I know this through a friend. If that sounds desirable, go for it, I think there’s a lot of honor in that kind of life."
