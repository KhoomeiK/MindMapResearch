They will send police or sheriffs out to evaluate her for an involuntary 72 hour hold (5150 in California, Baker Act in Florida, other states have similar laws). You need to truly believe she is at risk of harming herself or others. Be prepared to tell them exactly why you feel she is an immediate threat. They will take her to the nearest mental health facility or ER for evaluation by mental health professionals. Be aware that in many areas there is a shortage of inpatient psych beds, so she could be held in your local ER for a day or so until placement can be found.

It is not you actual credit score from the 3 big agencies that track that, but I have found it to within about 20 points when I applied for a mortgage. I know Capital One and Juniper Bank credit cards offer these. I would be shocked if the other big financial companies like Wells Fargo/Chase/Bank of America.

If you offer extended office hours or would be willing to do so, mention it. If they need to make an appointment for those hours, let them know  that.

I can sympathize with her desire to see the same provider throughout, but in my opinion the decision to go with a lay midwives is downright scary. I worked in neonatal intensive care before I became a family NP and I can think of at least 2 instances of very very bad outcomes for either Mom or baby due to using lay midwives. I am talking life altering or potentially life-ending scenarios. The problem is that most deliveries are routine and could be done at home with good outcomes. However, when things go bad, they go bad very quickly and lay midwives do not have the training to recognize when things are going wrong or the relationships with OBs or hospitals to hand over care in case an emergency happens during labor or delivery."

They either work directly with ob/gyns or have an obstetrician in a supervising or collaborative arrangement depending- agreement specifics vary by state law.

They could also decide on furniture that you could help them acquire as birthday or Christmas gifts. If they play with Barbies or other dolls, it could be sized to fit whichever dolls they like to play with. Thrift stores might also have material or even tile that could be used to decorate. There is a Habitat for Humanity in the next town over from that has a lot of building supples that could be repurposed and reused.

This applies to confirmed cases and is done to prevent the ~4% of untreated cases that progress to scarlet fever or rheumatic fever (3+% scarlet fever, < 1% rheumatic fever). There is less concern for resistance if you primarily stick to penV, because it is not used a lot for other infections and there is almost no resistance to it by strep; at least to date. Background: nurse practitioner in US. I am much less concerned about people being over prescribed pen V for strep than all the antibiotics prescribed for everyone who waltzes into their doctor or urgent care on day 3 of a cold and gets antibiotics for a ‘sinus infection’. Other countries may have different standards on when or if to treat strep, and you could certainly argue whether or not avoiding rheumatic heart disease is worth treating every case of strep, but there are certainly reasonable arguments in favor of treating  it. The problem is many providers don’t run a culture or do a rapid strep test and treat presumptively. They also often treat with other antibiotics that would be better off saved for other infections unless the patient has allergies to penicillins."
