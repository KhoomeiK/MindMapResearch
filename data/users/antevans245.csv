Glocks,ffo3d94,t1_fflo1xn,1580073665.0,Every shop I've been to says they haven't seen a 17l in a long time. I'll have to check out the next gun show that comes in to town
Glocks,ffkhkv9,t3_etyvmi,1580022878.0,I love the 17L. I really want one
projectcar,ffkgxmp,t3_eu2l9w,1580022577.0,Your garage won't be that clean for long
Justrolledintotheshop,ffkgqrc,t3_etst07,1580022486.0,Who thought it would be a good idea to make the caliper look like a banana
modernwarfare,ffk4tn2,t1_ffjmli2,1580015883.0,I got a pair of the lower end hyper x headphones. Got them for 50 dollars and I've loved them for the past 2 or 3 years
CherokeeXJ,ffjsma9,t1_ffjp82h,1580005840.0,Maybe we can link up when you get back. Thank you for your service
CherokeeXJ,ffjb2yz,t1_ffio9yb,1579994566.0,My dad lives in churchland. Id love to but dont have much time between college and work
CherokeeXJ,ffjaomq,t1_ffj8w4j,1579994343.0,Well unfortunately I had to sell my project xj. I'll be getting another after college tho and finally make it to some trails.
CherokeeXJ,ffigwg4,t3_etqzru,1579973589.0,Where do you go offroad in VA? I live in va beach and I dont think theres much here for that
VAGuns,ffczbk7,t3_esuhig,1579810354.0,Someone should start a GoFundMe
CherokeeXJ,ffcyw8c,t1_ffc7x9s,1579810118.0,F
modernwarfare,ffaaob0,t3_esgdqd,1579731178.0,My friend got the error and pressed yes. He said he still had his rank and items. Take that as you will though because its just one case
AnimalsBeingBros,ff99owv,t3_es371q,1579708045.0,It's the rats from coroline
modernwarfare,ff8dntj,t3_es7yzp,1579674143.0,Sorry about the stretched view... I play on an ultra wide monitor
Glocks,ff7fz2p,t1_ff7ftq9,1579648665.0,"Oh yeah. Sorry I just see all these modded out glocks with custom slides and new triggers and everything else. Great for competition and looks. I wouldnt do that for a EDC. Personally, I like how my 26 feels as is. I know a lot of people like different grips though. And if you dont you can just take it off"
Glocks,ff7ef3c,t1_ff6g0jv,1579647640.0,Glocks are extremely reliable as they are. I wouldnt make any major changes on it because if you need to use it you want to have the best chance possible of it going off. That's just my view on it though
modernwarfare,ff4r07y,t1_ff4qvzf,1579570352.0,I dont blame you. It's the first one I've played since MW3. More people should support it so they dont go back to the other bs they'e had going on for the last few years
modernwarfare,ff4qth3,t1_ff4qf6i,1579570225.0,"Dont get me wrong, I love the game. It's by far my favorite and most played game right now. It just seemed unoptimized at launch, at least on PCs side. Infinity war definetly took a step in the right direction with this one."
modernwarfare,ff4q1pf,t1_ff3xeyb,1579569692.0,The game wasnt optimized before they put it in the game...
modernwarfare,ff3tyco,t3_erey3s,1579548789.0,I could have a start like that and still get 7th place.
AskReddit,ff2aio2,t1_ff29spr,1579498729.0,Oh I didnt know it was just in out area. I'm right on the boarder though. Virginia beach.
AskReddit,ff26glo,t1_ff25g2h,1579495158.0,I'm only 18 Haha. But I was there because of my dad so I'd say that counts. I only know of 1 food lions though. All the mega stores like Walmart are killing them I'm sure
AskReddit,ff26cem,t1_ff25ytv,1579495060.0,I'm from virginia... what made you think NC?
AskReddit,ff070ak,t1_fezz7va,1579465834.0,"Confidence definetly helps though. I once watched a guy walk into a food lion, grab a case of beer, and walk out waving to the cashier and a smile on his face. They didnt even question the fact that he stole it or tried to steal it."
watchpeoplesurvive,fet6pyy,t3_eqgmts,1579372273.0,He landed it like a plane
DunderMifflin,fesk4hv,t3_eq9vwc,1579366058.0,Snip snap snip snap
GetMotivated,fea60c7,t1_fe6oq2e,1578944762.0,Theres nothing wrong with that then. If you can control it and it's not hurting you or anyone else then I dont see a reason to quit
GetMotivated,fea4mmi,t1_fe6spl0,1578944323.0,That's great to hear! It's nice to hear about people who overcame their problems to make a better life for themselves
GetMotivated,fe69u4n,t1_fe5uvrz,1578885003.0,Yeah. Wasnt really what I was trying to do by cross posting here...
GetMotivated,fe69q0z,t1_fe63kjd,1578884922.0,Good for you. That's great to hear!
mildlyinteresting,fe683nu,t1_fe5lw5t,1578883867.0,And a long rope to tie to the outside and follow you. Or at least some duck tape or spray paint as an indication of the way to the exit
nottheonion,fe3ic6q,t1_fe3hmsb,1578849514.0,That's true too. I'm sure they're thinking that most cases will be okay. That's not enough if someone gets hurt though. Itll be interesting if anything comes out of it
nottheonion,fe3d99y,t1_fe2gqyn,1578848255.0,200 kg is about 440 lbs. The weight of most athletes in the 2012 summer games was about 55 kg for women and 75 kg for men (according go the guardian)  I dont think it will happen that often but I guess we'll have to wait and see
HappyTrees,fe3a9xt,t3_ennj7j,1578847449.0,"Your lake looks amazing. Im not very good, but I'm sure it all just comes with practicing the techniques"
AskReddit,fe0cl4y,t1_fdwdk2x,1578809860.0,And the naked gun movies. I love them
