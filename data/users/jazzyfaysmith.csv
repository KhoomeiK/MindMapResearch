starbucks,ffun603,t3_ev6wah,1580245481.0,"1. I did but the experience is really what got me here
2. Customer service experience (which you have) can get you anywhere you want to go. As an HR rep, I can tell you that it's the hardest quality to ""train"" so use that to your advantage.
3. I've been in the HR field for 3 years post Starbucks and retail. I started at $16 and have gone up to $21, chose to work for a non-profit to do more good than make money and am happily at $14 right now!"

bipolar,ffujrfm,t3_ev7p0q,1580243425.0,"I'm an HR rep, as previously stated you may qualify for FMLA depending on a few factors, number one - have you worked there for a year? number two - have you worked over 1250 hours during that year?

You will have to fill out a bunch of paperwork at some point (hospital may be able to do it depending on if you give them signed consent). They also may force you to use any PTO you have to cover your time off as well. Feel free to reach out to me at any point in time as this is what I do for a living!"
bipolar2,ffpevut,t3_euh6r9,1580093319.0,One of my old sorority sisters. I was undiagnosed at the time but she would be a total bitch and blame that or use it to get Frat boys attention when she was depressed (aka she was being ignored). It’s come out since then (8 years ago) that home girl will fake everything she can to get attention. Pisses me off so much.

weddingplanning,ffo76qn,t3_eu8xet,1580074838.0,Dress 1! But you are Killin it in both!
weddingplanning,ffo6u9v,t3_eu0ce1,1580074726.0,"I appreciate the concern. There is a lot more to the issue regarding those word choices and his feelings but we were able to work it out today. I know he loves me more than anything he’s just an old fashion grump sometimes lol 

I am safe and happy. I think deep down he sees messy thrown together me every day and loves how vibrant and confident I am regardless of any effort put into my looks. He loves that about me and I’m sure he wants everyone else to see that side of me too."
weddingplanning,ffndupn,t1_ffmbomt,1580064631.0,Nope never he doesn’t care at all. We’ve also never had an issue because I’m pretty modest in every day. But I do my hair and makeup and he’s never said anything besides how pretty I looked.
bipolar2,fflw84e,t1_ffloisa,1580044951.0,I’m guessing it’s affecting you too then. I never ever have nightmares and now it’s also wake up with a panic ones!!
