There are very few places we've seen declines be met with rising quality of life (not to mention, most nations in the west that would be comparable to Japan have had growing or stable populations for the last 100 years or so). AI and automation are not at a point where they are ready to be deployed to match the current drop in population. And these problems are short term, but their consequences will not be. Japan's population is expected to drop by nearly 1/4 in the next 30 years. The burden of carrying for the elderly and the lack of job prospects for the younger generation outside of caring for older people is going to set the nation back far more than 30 years.

Divide GDP per capita by less people. presto! Higher GDP per capita. it happened after the black death and wars in Europe several times and those economies relied on manual labor heavily. Japan doesn't. AI and Automation are only decades from devastating the transportation industry, medical industry, financial services, retail, manufacturing, etc. Well actually the industries will be booming, they just wont have any jobs. The jobs lost in those industries will free up labor to move to other markets, people currently in those industries will be hit hard, but there is not much you can do about that, except implement a UBI.

Aside from the fact that it shrinks the market, i.e. those “AI”-produced goods have to be sold abroad under generally worse conditions and only following adjustments to various foreign standards, you also have costs that don’t decrease with the population size.

It's actually a pretty common occurrence in history. There are some trends that work in the opposite direction because without certain levels of population some public works projects are not feasible and you don't get as much innovation with a smaller population, but it's not like Japan's population is going to change by an order of magnitude any time soon, so those don't apply as much as dividing a set amount of resources by fewer people.


> One of these is that you still have to maintain the infrastructure, which only fewer people will be paying for. 

This is a problem in the short term. Something that will be figured out regardless of increasing immigration.

> Another one is defense. China doesn’t give a shit if the average Japanese has to pay more to maintain the defensive capabilities of their nation. 

This is a complete non-issue. China and Japan will never go to war as long as the US exists.

Yes, the issue is trivial.

> Does your wife like that local channel with the local comedians? Too fucking bad, you’re going to watch the Tokyo owarai, because the TV station can no longer afford that show. 

Actually, the opposite, because there will be more wealth spread among fewer people, creative pursuits will become more economically viable.

> And then there’s the transition from the pay-as-you-pension system to funded pension systems, where several generations will pay an increased load to fund their own pensions while paying for the elderly. 

That is a big issue, but not one that can be solved with immigration. Japan's pension is not sustainable. It will have to create a new system once the Showa die off and the young population more adequately matches the old.

> Speaking of the elderly, without a higher birth rate and with improvements in medical science, they will be making for an ever-increasing portion of the welfare budget. Enjoy paying more and more for the obaachan despite having already reached your population stability.

AI will definitely bring down the cost of medical care a great deal. but beside that, the elderly are only a huge problem atm because the post war birthrate was so high compared to the current. Once they die off in 20-30 years, It will be much easier for the country as a whole to afford the elderly.

> So, yeah, great idea. AI is just the latest hype in a long process of productivity growth. 

Its really quite different than any that has come before. Of course, it wont be overnight, but compared to the problem with the elderly, it will be rather quick.

Prior to the singularity, autonomous vehicles will completely displace truck driver and taxi driver jobs. AI will replace huge swaths of personnel in the medical, financial, and  countless other industries.

billiards,fe6iu46,t1_fdxllfu,1578892278.0,"Yea, the intentional foul is just delaying a loss. It might work on players who hardly know which end of the cue to hold, but it should never work on anybody who actually knows how to play.

Although, as you have it diagrammed, the jump is a hanger. I think in the op, I prefer the kick, but the jump is definitely an option if there are other stripes on the table blocking the 3 rail kick."
billiards,fdq1rnu,t1_fdq03yo,1578650601.0,-ish. you gotta adjust because the cue ball will come off the first rail short. looks closer to a 7-4 from the picture maybe give it a bit more running english to catch the 4th rail above the 8 instead of aiming it directly at the pocket.
billiards,fdpwo9r,t3_emnv7u,1578643632.0,3 rail kick the 8 in.

billiards,fdg9nzc,t3_el7ndy,1578386056.0,I think its because either a) predator cues are generally above the price range of most people who post asking for cue recommendations here or b) Mezz is usually recommended to people asking for recommendations of higher end production cues because they are better quality build-wise than predator at similar prices.

billiards,fdb2g7a,t1_fdadihp,1578252995.0,"That's actually pretty much exactly the case. Look at any of their azb profiles and their only entries are WPA events. Obviously they play in tons of tournaments in Asia, AZB just covers the US and international major tournaments. 

SVB has 5 majors, all US opens

&nbsp;

Wu has 4, WPC 9 ball, 2 China Opens, and an All Japan, plus an WPC 8 ball title (not really a major, but still a world title)

&nbsp;

Ko has a whopping 6 majors. WPC 9 ball, WPC 10 ball, China Open, and 3 All Japans.

&nbsp;

Note: Wu and Ko are both only 30 and Wu took off 5 or so years in his prime because of nationality problems and battling leukemia."
billiards,fd8kcke,t1_fd5yiya,1578219412.0,I would throw Wu in between Earl and Sigel and put Chang and KPY tied with Shane.
billiards,fd2yy1n,t1_fd2trwq,1578153157.0,"Efren had to contend with Earl who is hands down the best 9 ball player ever. Also, you mention the whole world showing up for the US Open, but that is only a relatively recent thing. From about 2010 to 2015, it was a lot softer. Probably the softest it's ever been. 2016 was probably the toughest field Shane ever came out on top of, though.

Did I mention Efren has 2 All Japan titles?"
billiards,fd2x4y7,t1_fd2nll5,1578152510.0,"Players of his era ran plenty of packages in 8 ball. Ralph Souquet has like a 25-pack. Efren still beat them, consistently."
billiards,fd2je7x,t1_fd2gj7l,1578148080.0,"Because you only need to make a ball and not scratch in 8 ball. You don't need a very hard break to do that. Efren has half a dozen world 8 ball titles, while some of them may be borderline in terms of sanctioning, at the time, the WPA didn't have much authority and world 8 ball tournaments are held much less than annually so he has waaaaaay more than his fair share. Not to mention his 2 big IPT wins."

billiards,fd28o5p,t1_fd25c4a,1578143421.0,"Efren beats Shane at 8 ball (Efren is probably the best 8 ball player ever). 9 ball is a toss up if both were at their best, but 36 year old Efren would probably have the edge over a 36 year old Shane because Efren had a much longer prime than Shane. 10 ball would go poorly for Efren because of the break, but he would probably have figured it out if it was the dominant game of his era. Efren could still probably torture Shane at 1 pocket."

In all fairness, though. I don't think SVB himself ever put himself above Efren. Just some nut huggers who have never run a rack in their life."
