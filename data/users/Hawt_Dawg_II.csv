It's evil to cheer over someone's death **unless they've started wars or caused mass deaths** 

but of course, by that logic we could cheer when Obama dies cause the American military kills a lot too. But we won't cause Obama is cool. My point is that you have to judge for yourself who's still ""human"" in this case. And for me killing a few dozens bulls just isn't as bad as 6 million jews."
watchpeoplesurvive,fg0002w,t1_ffzzqpd,1580397139.0,Yes you're refuting it by using an unrelated example that wouldn't obviously be an exception.

watchpeoplesurvive,ffzyboo,t1_ffzy3ul,1580395994.0,I think cheering about a human being dying makes you an evil person. Like i get that hurting animals is bad but it's not bad enough to die for. Especially not since its not some crazy illegal animal fighting ring. Its perfectly legal and not really all that rare.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ffzy3iy,t3_ew3rdh,1580395837.0,Ok ok ok. Best grappling hook game to date is that free to play attack on titan fan game. I don't even watch anime but that game fucking rocked. Still does probably.

TwoBestFriendsPlay,ffzxw5p,t1_ffzwji4,1580395694.0,The grapple in Apex is identical from titenfall 2. Apex is mostly built of the titenfall 2 engine and the movement barely changed.

However, when i frequented that sub there were sometimes posts of people straight up dying. And like i know i know ""they're doing a bad thing"". But still, people in the comments were all happy and cheering about a dude getting gored in the arena in front of everyone. Probably in front of some friends and family members as well, maybe not directly but they're gonna see the clip eventually. That just felt wrong.

Like no matter how bad someone is, no one deserves that brutal of a death. And the family definitely doesn't deserve to live with that."

BadChoicesGoodStories,fffx422,t1_fffvxl6,1579893715.0,"Yes cause spray isn't some special medical name. It's litterally the same word in Dutch actually. 

But no, you're right, you didn't make that specific argument. but i asumed that's why you thought it'd spray because you said you do procedures around arteries, in which case a puncture wound could only be quite small.

2. Why don't you understand that the bigger the hole is the lower the spray force would be? Saying its a 50cent size hole was litterally to give the smallest hole possible giving your theory the most chance. And it still didn't add up.  I guess we could asume it just lightly nicked the artery but even then it's too deep to spray all the way through"
BadChoicesGoodStories,fffukav,t1_fffu1yo,1579892113.0,"Yeah i have no concept of understanding of how this works. You're the one claiming a spray of blood from a 50cent coin sized hole would still spray through at least about 7cm of wound channel and a lair of cloth and still have force even if it's coming from a sub-artery. 

I'm sorry man but knowing the fancy sounding names of arteries doesn't mean you're right."
BadChoicesGoodStories,ffftkpx,t1_fffqawi,1579891501.0,"Yes it sprays cause its a small hole and that's how pressure works. We're talking about this situation though. A hole this big wouldn't spray at all. Especially not since his muscles tensed up and would've kept the hole shut.

E: the superior rectal artery also lies very deep. This may be a part where you're not getting me. I'm not saying it wouldn't spray if it was out in the open. I mean that the spray wouldn't make it all the way out the wound channel without hitting the wall and turning into a slow stream of ass blood. So you'd never see the spray. And even if it did make it out the wound it wouldn't go through his pants aswell."
BadChoicesGoodStories,fffpvet,t1_fffpibg,1579889212.0,"Yeah it could cut whatever ass artery it wants but it wouldn't spray.

Idk how high you think someone's blood presure is or how thin you think blood is but blood is highly viscous so it doesn't spray. It's litterally an evolutionary result so that you don't bleed out over a mean gash or puncture wound. It slowly runs through the cut and clots up in the wound so a scab can form across it."
BadChoicesGoodStories,fffm9yd,t1_ffdk6ij,1579887012.0,"Blood really doesn't ""spray"" unless you puncture an artery. Which aren't in your ass. The closest one would be inner thigh but that's too deep to spray."
