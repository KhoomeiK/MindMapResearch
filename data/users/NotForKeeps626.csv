AskReddit,ffdjagf,t1_ffditv6,1579822062.0,"I prefer ankle socks of any kind. As long as they’re the same material and thickness, then colours and patterns don’t bother me. I prefer to mismatch and be odd."

mentalhealth,ffd868p,t1_ffd4skn,1579815297.0,"She truly is my sanity right now. Going through so much and I know gotta hold on for her. I’m lucky enough to be a low risk pregnancy but all this stress and anxiety can not be good for her much less me. The realisation I’ve come to though, is that I can’t bear to lose her, and the second I do. I’m gone. I know for a fact that I would not be able to handle it. Thank you for responding, it means a lot that there are others out there who kind of understand."
AskReddit,ffcvdes,t1_ffcp2dg,1579808043.0,I would want mine filled with socks. Eccentric socks with fruit or animal patterns that I can deliberately swap and change.
AskReddit,ffcv6hn,t3_est2b4,1579807925.0,"Thumbtacks. I’m lame. But I’d imagine they all fall and kids rush forward and get them stuck in their little footsies, granted they’re not wearing any footwear. They’re also extremely annoying to pull out of shoes so that too."
offmychest,ffcucup,t1_ffctus1,1579807436.0,I think when it tries to auto fill the form from the information you’ve provided on your resume. *Tries*.
offmychest,ffcu8kn,t3_esvl1h,1579807367.0,Indeed is a joke here as well. Aus. It’s annoying to be basically double handling as we’re repeating what we’ve already spent time on. Arghhhhhhhhhh.
AskReddit,ffcerl3,t1_ffbiq31,1579797897.0,"Friends aren’t everything. Best friend I had for near on 20 years became a stranger. But having that one person can mean the whole world. You don’t need a whole horde of friends, but one supportive mate can help you through the worst of times."
narcissisticparents,ffc3hic,t1_ffc2kd5,1579790617.0,"Thank you. Every moment spent with my mum is me reminding myself I’ll never make my child feel like this. She pretty much shows me what I shouldn’t do, and how I feel reinforces the fact that I’ll never be like her. It’s horrible we have to experience all this but if it makes me a better person and a better mother for it, then so be it."

JUSTNOMIL,ffbxmjg,t1_ffba0on,1579786057.0,"Exactly. She’ll be wondering some more, I bet when he’s a little older she’ll want a peek to see how he’s coming along. I find it vile that she’s even wondering about her grandson’s bits like that."

ChoosingBeggars,ffac5x5,t3_esem3u,1579732072.0,"Some people are really nice and helpful. Idk, being 7 months pregnant in this heat I’d suck my pride up enough to ask for some help. Living in a small town where our community bands together, I’d bet someone’s got a spare aircon they don’t use. Unless they rudely asked and implied they’re entitled to what someone isn’t using then I’d say shove it but I find to the title of this making a mockery of this person asking for help and how fucking hot it does get here."

ChoosingBeggars,ff9e04o,t1_ff9653c,1579710962.0,"If he was making an effort then I’d give him the benefit of the doubt and help him but because he’s so entitled and demanding I’d tell him to shove it. Sitting on my arse all day and then demanding people do this and that for me, I’d get told to fuck off plain and simple. Tell him to have sleep for breakfast, lunch and dinner with a side of grow tf up."
ChoosingBeggars,ff9dtkb,t3_escys0,1579710841.0,He’s big and hairy enough. How entitled and delusional one must be to make such demands.

FiftyFifty,ff33vr1,t1_ff2mhmm,1579533015.0,It’s pretty sad that I knew if I got the safe one it’d be that particular hair product (the dumbass commercial used to come on aaaaall the damn time). Super curious about the nsfw one.
pregnant,ff33bym,t1_felvjko,1579532602.0,I’ve always been a side sleeper but lay on my tummy when I’m reading or on my phone. I’m 29 weeks now and still lie on my tummy but I don’t think I could sleep on my tummy. It’s never been comfortable for me.
harrypottertheories,ff2jzmh,t3_erahxf,1579509613.0,I think it’s just one of those things people say. Everyone has a natural talent for something and others have to work at it. His dad just happened to be a great seeker as well. Coincidence I’d chalk it up to.
FiftyFifty,ff2gfzq,t3_er7rqw,1579505063.0,The driver had heaps of time to slow down. Yes pedestrian could’ve been more aware but it doesn’t take a fucking a lot to not be a cunt of a driver. Hope he got charged.

Having your belly touched without permission and then to have someone dictate what I can and cannot drink/eat would definitely warrant a slap. Lady being so darn aggressive at the same time, I hope PM is ok. I would’ve bought her and you some cupcakes to go with that coffee."
raisedbynarcissists,fervsz8,t3_eqg8ez,1579358881.0,"Throw them out. If they ask don’t even acknowledge it. I’m truly sorry that they would be so insensitive. Or gift them to someone if you don’t want to throw them out, but remove them from your home. You know yourself."

Grade- A knob you are. God forbid any vulnerable guy already dealing with this comes to you for some advice. Just rug sweep. “*You’re not worth the effort because society only believes women.*”

What a shitty thing. No. Men deserve the same recognition and support and should be fully encouraged to seek help instead of being told to sweep it under the rug."
