NoStupidQuestions,ffi3iz8,t3_eti97g,1579964035.0,"Yes. You do have a distinctive smell that you give off, whether that be good or bad. You're used to it so often times you can't smell it but others sure can. The mix of whatever is smelling on you and your pheromones combine for a unique scent. 

This is why it's important to wash yourself daily and make sure that your clothes are regularly laundered. If you start to smell a little bit, you're not going to notice at first because it's your own scent. However, others will. If it's gotten to the point where you can smell something bad on yourself, it's to the point where it's potent to other people. 

This is also why putting cologne directly on your skin is the proper way to apply it. That gets the cologne the chance to mix with your natural pheromones and work in tangent with it instead of just latching onto your clothing."

Back when I was looking to become a private investigator, I mentioned it to the loan officer at the bank when I was applying for a car loan and she mentioned that she has a client who runs his own PI firm and would ask him if he's hiring if that was okay with me. I said hell yes that's okay with me and a week later, got a call from him as well as an interview and got the job. 

I posted this advice on Reddit and within 3 hours I had somebody p.m. me saying that they did this exact same thing (mentioning that you're job seeking to everybody) and had an interview at his neighbor's sisters accounting firm scheduled for next week.

Biden is leading in the vast majority of polls by a SIZABLE margin and only polls that you see in which Bernie is leading are the cherry-picked ones on Reddit and that have questionable legitimacy in terms of data handling and gathering. 

The American population is dumb. The corporate media is doing everything they can to trash Sanders and Joe Biden has far more name recognition. Joe Biden is going to get the nomination and then it's a coin toss as to who's going to win the election.

Educate yourself and brace for it so that you're not completely blindsided like the rest of reddit when Biden wipes the floor with Sanders over the next coming months.

Fundies deny the human side of their marriage and just assume that whichever person catches their eye and they are married to in 5 months will be God's perfect plan and he will take care of it. 

There's a reason why so many people who get married in their teens or early twenties get divorced; your mind and body changes drastically in your twenties and if you're married to somebody during that time, you just have to hope that you change together. 

Like I said previously, fundies deny the humanity in their marriage and assume that anything that happens in the marriage is God's will, even if it means being absolutely miserable. We watched it happen with one of my sister's friends and her husband. They got married when they were both 19 because people at the church and their families pressured them into it. Of course, they immediately had three children when only he was working and it was a low-paying job at that so they had a lot of troubles. within five years, they were basically just living as roommates, not even sleeping in the same bed. They didn't have sex for two years straight but did not believe in divorce so they just stayed miserable.

FundieSnark,ff3jgkw,t1_ff3icmc,1579542349.0,"Yeah I was unfortunately forced to go to Liberty under threat of my parents not paying for my college. I lived off campus and would go to this fitness center called The Racket which was about five miles off campus and only a couple of minutes from my apartment. I signed in at the front desk like normal and walked over to the workout machine room when I was physically stopped by an employee who told me I had to wait a few minutes before I could go in there. I asked why and they said that the owners were currently in there working out and they don't allow anyone else in there while they are working out. Mind you, there was about 20 workout machines in that room (half cardio, half weight training). 

About 10 minutes later, Jerry Falwell Jr and his wife waltz on out of there with their personal trainer in tow. I do have to say though, their personal trainer had an adorable husky that would walk around the gym sometimes and I would pet him in between my sets. Anyways, yeah they were treated like deities everywhere they went and it was annoying.

I was doing some more digging and saw that there were reports of Jerry Jr sending racy pictures of his wife in provocative and skimpy outfits to ""thank him"" for helping her maintain her figure to who he thought was that personal trainer but he accidentally sent them to a few other people. Other staff members report that he is extremely open and graphic when he talks about his sex life in front of other people, including him saying that his penis is too big for his wife to comfortably take. 

I honestly don't doubt that for a second. I had Elmer Towns, the co-founder of the University, for a lecture class my freshman year and he was about 20 minutes late one class and he just gets on the mic and casually says ""sorry I was late for class, everybody. I was busy having sex with my wife and it went a little longer than I anticipated"".

PublicFreakout,fewf2w8,t1_fewesa6,1579409528.0,Lol. You remind me of this retarded kid in my class in middle School who would say the same three lines from Looney tunes over and over again.
Justfuckmyshitup,fewerlx,t1_fewep5v,1579409378.0,Is it really ableist if I'm just simply pointing out what you are and making suggestions to you based on your cognitive disabilities that might be of use to you?
PublicFreakout,fewel6u,t1_fewds2h,1579409295.0,"Still waiting to hear my supposed racist remarks. 

I'll give you a while since you're no doubt sifting through my entire comment history looking for something to throw back in my face. Spoiler alert, there's nothing there for you to throw."
Justfuckmyshitup,feweiaj,t1_fewdu5r,1579409257.0,"Man, it amazes me that you're this autistic yet you have the ability to read and write. Has anyone ever done a study on you before? I'm sure your mind would be of great scientific value in the study of autism. At least that's one good thing that you'll do with your life."

Wellthatsucks,fewbpk7,t1_fewbkwg,1579408047.0,That's what I thought. I never asked for your address you fucking retard. So now you move goal posts and you have to put words in the other person's mouth in order to form an argument. Tell me again how you're a PhD student? LMAO

PublicFreakout,fewabbv,t1_fewa504,1579407493.0,"I'm genuinely asking what your arrangement is like. I'm a straight guy so I don't have much experience in alternative lifestyles so when I come across somebody such as yourself who engages in homosexual acts for money, I'm genuinely fascinated because I've never been around that before."
