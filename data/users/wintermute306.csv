cfs,fft1xr3,t3_euz68r,1580202689.0,"We're here to tell you to, we understand how shit it is, you still got this. It's likely a mixture of all of those things. 

When I'm in a hole, I think about the light at the end of the tunnel."

Pacing is always chasing your baseline. I wish we could check our energy levels in the morning with a little blood checker or something."
echoes,ffq9fv1,t1_ffj9sy1,1580127021.0,"I have a hotas and us it on my sofa, it's not perfect but it makes the game SO much better. LOVE it. Worst thing is I mostly play on xbox now as my mate only plays there."
echoes,ffq9doy,t3_etogy3,1580126948.0,"I've started a fresh save on Elite Dangerous. It's been great fun to be fair, missed that game. Echoes will be better for me though as I don't get much time for console gaming anymore, mostly mobile...which is why I play a lot of Runescape 3."

gaming,ff8v2p4,t1_ff8svln,1579697088.0,"I'm with you on this, if people want to drop a few quid on a cosmetic. Let them. However, it shouldn't effect anything in-game unless there is a respectable way for someone to earn the currency in-game. 

F2P games like Warframe are kept afloat by MTX. Largely they've done it well."

burial,ff2ji61,t3_er86lj,1579508956.0,"There isn't any that I know of. You'll-at best-have to look for a garage night but that isn't really the same thing. Most venues in London are multipurpose. 

I would advise seeking out a Boxed night if you like UK bass. Those guys know their shit even if it has nothing to do with Burial."

Art,femg603,t3_eptsm1,1579253796.0,This has a bit of a banksy vibe. It's insanely well painted from what I can see.
cfs,femdfow,t3_epp7dm,1579249821.0,I can safely say over this place has been a lifeline for me over the years. Even if it's just to read similar stories so I didn't feel alone in my suffering.
bigseo,fek88m5,t1_fek2b70,1579194660.0,"Hahaha

If you write it, they will come.

I think in reality he's just really happy that it worked out. It's a gamble isn't it?"
bigseo,fegd7ia,t1_feg9p53,1579088482.0,"I mean, what is the difference between you and them? I wouldn't believe everything you seen on YouTube. 

Do you have any connections you can work on? Have you tried networking through Linkedin? How many jobs are you applying for a week? There are dedicated recruiters for your level of skill as well. 

Basically, have you exhausted all the options? Getting a job is hard work. Getting your first one is four times as hard."
bigseo,feg8k9m,t3_eor6kv,1579082192.0,"I know a lot of people are saying this but you'd be better off training as a front-end dev. If you don't like coding then look into SEO. If SEOs are honest with themselves, they'll tell you it's a tough job that required a shit load of boring work. Certainly at the start."
burial,fe9899p,t1_fe8t08e,1578935262.0,Exactly. Nothing worse than when your heroes end up being prejudiced arseholes.
burial,fe8rm4l,t3_en7e3r,1578929798.0,Props to Grimes for popping Locil in there as well.

>*“I put my heart into the new EP, I hope someone likes it. I wanted the tunes to be anti-bullying tunes that could maybe help someone to believe in themselves, to not be afraid, and to not give up, and to know that someone out there cares and is looking out for them. So it's like an angel's spell to protect them against the unkind people, the dark times, and the self-doubts.”*

But you know, we don't know."
learnart,fe71qlh,t3_enpt8m,1578908888.0,"Enjoyable, really like it. I won't disagree that it could do with some darker tones to it. However, it looks stylised so if that is the look you intended then, job well done. 

Better than I can do for sure."
cfs,fe6t2j7,t3_enso3q,1578904099.0,"100%, even when I was socially active and in remission so to speak it would be one day on six days hermit. These days it's more like once a quarter."

bigseo,fdpytjk,t3_emo0wh,1578646457.0,"Honestly, sounds like your content is being read. Have you designed the content and pages to interest people to click further in? I think the biggest issue is the mindset of your user, they are searching to answer a question and they are either having it answered on that page or they're going look elsewhere.

Do you have a related content section on the page? What is the overall goal of the site? Are you selling or just informing? If it's the latter I would assume you're being successful.

If you're worried that bounce rate is effecting your ranking, I wouldn't, there isn't much you can do about it and there are TONS of high profile sites that have similar user journeys."

cfs,fdpxflm,t1_fdph369,1578644602.0,"100% this. 

I think it's the aspirationalism that has been forced down the millennial's throats. It's designed to make you feel like shit if you're not making huge amounts of wonga. 

I've spent most of my life earning less than my friends it's only in my mid-30s that I've realised that it makes me no less than them, nor does my lack of education."

videos,fdk2tm7,t1_fdjxgz0,1578494682.0,"I realise my mistake now. I tried to engage Reddit.

I was merely trying to make my point that no industry should have sexual assault as a gateway to success. That is patriarchal and disgusting."
videos,fdk2k20,t1_fdjzbi4,1578494493.0,"The point is, that it was the only choice if you wanted to work in that industry. You shouldn't have to be sexually assaulted to make it in the industry."

Not true at all."

Art,fdgef54,t3_el0u5b,1578392894.0,"What is with all the digital hate? It's a format. People were like this when they introduced digital photography as well. You'all get over it in time. 

I really like this work."

xboxone,fcwyg0d,t3_ej96l3,1578043031.0,"Personally, I tried to play it a while ago after a long long hiatus. I died , then got verbally abused by my team mates. All round a toxic shitty community. Wouldn't bother unless you want to play the solo stuff.

runescape,fcur5n9,t3_ej08z1,1577986821.0,"Pretty sure the real answer is mobile. RS3 is members only and on android. When it rolls out F2P and IOS I think it'll do well. 

I've tried several times to get into OSRS but the combat and old school mechanics are a barrier for me. I think RS3 is better, I never played RS when I was growing up so I couldn't give two shits about nostalgia."
runescape,fcuq3pw,t3_eiya3m,1577986232.0,I absolutely love it. I don't really play PC at the moment. I play on my Samsung tablet and on my Oneplus 6t. The latter runs it so much better and I can get a good couple of hours play before it dies.
cfs,fcugq4y,t3_eizhr3,1577980554.0,"In a way, yes. As a full-time worker I'm almost constantly running on fumes. Soon as I get some time off or the weekend I just flop out and feel like shit.

CHEERS BODY THANKS FOR THAT."
learntodraw,fctryob,t3_eisunz,1577956402.0,I should do more of this. Largely when I'm not feeling inspired or creative I'll do a few of these just because I enjoy making marks. It's also relaxing when watching the box.
