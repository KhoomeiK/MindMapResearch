thesims,ff1afks,t1_ff1545m,1579476847.0,Omg haven't watched that season yet but I know how that character looks and I already agree
thesims,ff0yzkf,t1_ff0xq6h,1579473676.0,"Ikr when I saw her posing in front of the mirror with that outfit I was like ""omg she's a sexy and extravagant villain and I love her"""
bulletjournal,fdharc1,t1_fdh6u0n,1578419018.0,"It was just recommended to me about half an hour ago! I know some similar apps but I haven't try any of them because I thought it wouldn't be so useful for me because of my very irregular periods, but I may try it then! Thank you :)"
bulletjournal,fdh4ip4,t1_fdgzdx9,1578415210.0,Oh thanks! I know some apps that works similarly but I've never used them because I thought that I wouldn't find them so useful because of my very irregular period. I may give it a try tho :)
bulletjournal,fdgt0rw,t1_fdgp1ks,1578407569.0,"I thought the same! I understand that it's still a taboo (I personally am still a bit embarrassed to talk about some things that are sex related in some contexts), but I also think it's important to talk more often about it because it's a health thing anyway"
bulletjournal,fdgoko6,t3_elaond,1578404092.0,"I have seen plenty period trackers online but I like yours a lot because I understand it better. This may sound a bit dumb but I've seen plenty period trackers in which people track how long do they bleed and when they're ovulating (and I never know when I am ovulating). And my period is very irregular, so my symptoms really change from one time to another (and because of it being irregular, I've had more than one scare weeks after sex, so that part of your tracker is very useful too). All I've been doing until now is adding a red dot on my calendar when I start bleeding, but I may add something like this to my bujo too, thx for sharing :)"

bulletjournal,fcge70n,t1_fcfpgr5,1577639066.0,Aw thank you! :) I said that because I usually see really decorated and beautiful spreads and I usually do more minimalistic ones hahah
