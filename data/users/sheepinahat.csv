depression,ffijega,t3_etqbpl,1579975285.0,"People talk about people... That's just life. I'm not trying to downplay the hurt you feel. Naturally it is hurtful, but I started to look at things a different way as I got older. 

I have talked about people often in my life. I think we all have. I've said things about people that are good and bad, and things I wouldn't say to their face because it's pointless and would just upset them.

Each time I've done This, I haven't really cares particularly about what I was saying. It's something to talk about with people you have little else in common with.

I know people more than likely have said negative things about me in the past, but it doesn't bother me, because I know ultimately they don't really care. Because you are the centre of your own world this issue will be far more important to you than to them. 

Also, when people talk about me negatively I couldn't really care less. Why? Because if what they are saying is true then it's true. Why shouldn't they talk about it to each other. It's true and they can if they want, why should it bother me?

If what they're saying isn't true then it's not true. They're talking shit. So why should their dumbfuck weird opinion bother me?

This kind of stuff used to bother me so much, but now I really don't have any shits to give. Xx"

If you're thinking rationally, then yes, suicide is selfish. You're torturing the people who love you by committing suicide.  If my son ever did that my life would be destroyed and I would die.  


The issue is that when people commit suicide, they aren't thinking rationally and aren't in their right mind. They're usually at the lowest point in their lives, and often genuinely believing that no one will care or maybe even that people will be glad when they're gone.   


I do, however, don't think there is any valid excuse for killing yourself in a way that risks other peoples lives or mental well-being, eg, jumping off bridges on to busy roads, or like someone did near me the other day, drive into a lorry."

Ignore this dickhead, mate, sounds like one of those types who has to put other people down to make them feel better about themselves.

You don't have to come out to anyone but your romantic interests, you're not prevented from marriage, you don't have Most, if any, of the issues that the are the reason that LGBT is an alliance.

I was even reading something here the other day about a bisexual who was basically kicked out of an LGBT club by its straight leaders for having a boyfriend. That's seems to be the way it's going. 

I now see the LGBTQ club as having very little to do with lesbians, gays, bisexuals a large amount of actual transgenders or anyone over 25. 

Heck. The other day I was watching a cisgender gay male arguing with a transgender woman about trans issues and telling her she was wrong (he was very woke)."

TrueOffMyChest,ffg7tkv,t1_ffg4uol,1579900324.0,"I can't really. The LGBT community has a history of being oppressed, abused and even criminalized.

No one's parents are going to disown them for not having a sex drive. No one has ever been beaten for only finding intelligence attractive. Quite frankly, all of this labelling personality traits as somehow being LGBT is downright offensive.

And the fact that people are literally making shit up so they can feel victimised, like all of these genders that are nothing more than personality traits is pathetic.

We have spent decades trying to defend ourselves from hatred on the basis we don't choose who we are, to be taken over by people literally the opposite, insisting they can choose exactly who and what they are."

Deleted one for calling me a right wing capitalist nazi because I called Jeremy Corbyn a tosser and one deleted me because I asked them for reasons that I should vote Labour. 

I'm not exaggerating or only giving half a story. The first one I wasn't even talking to, but was commenting on a post on the Jeremy Corbyn page. The other I was genuinely asking for reasons why I should vote Labour, who told me it wasn't her job to educate me... typical lefty patronising bullshit. 

Ended up voting labour anyway for two very good reasons. 
Tories have don't nothing good for ten years, and I figured might aswell let someone else have a go at fucking up the country, and also so when I tell these people what cunts they are they can't just call me a Tory."

AmItheAsshole,femoxp1,t1_femohgt,1579265175.0,"I dunno. Don't irritate the cat means don't irritate the cat so you just don't do it once you've been told. Kids aren't stupid, they bloody well know what behaviour is and isn't acceptable for the most part. Especially when it comes to serious stuff like hurting animals and stealing. 

I'm just judging from my own perspective from when I was a kid. Maybe other people's kids genuinely don't know how they should behave, but most kids do seem to know when they are being naughty because they will hide it and lie about it, therefore they know it's wrong and that they shouldn't do it."

I get the point of baby showers. I just personally felt it wasn't for me and I wouldn't want to invite someone to something where they feel obliged to buy me stuff. 

A wedding is one thing because it's an event, but I just feel with a baby shower you might aswell save everyone some time and say 'oi, mate, buy me some stuff for my kid and drop it off when you're passing.'"

I didn't have a baby shower and I won't be wanting gifts for my wedding. I'd rather the people I know spent that 100 quid or whatever on buying themselves something nice that they want.

I understand in the past people gave gifts to help the couple because at the same time as getting married the couple would also be moving in together and furnishing a house so the help was needed, but life is rarely like that any more."
