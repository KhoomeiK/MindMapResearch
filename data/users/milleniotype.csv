AskReddit,ff996yh,t3_es53p0,1579707732.0,"I once dated a girl who, as nice as she was was just that... Nice. She didn't have any career ambitions, she didn't have any particular taste in music, or movies, she didn't play games or want a pet or... Well, anything really. I felt bad because she was really nice but there was just no passion there, for anything. She was boring."

AskReddit,fdxgra1,t1_fdwbrb6,1578768536.0,yeah I can't argue with that. I think the fact I didn't watch the original for a long time before I watched the remake helped so I wasn't actively comparing them the whole time. Also it's probably a lot more effective if you haven't already seen the twist end.
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fdw7uee,t1_fdv80ne,1578755958.0,Depends when it happened I guess - tvs definitely didn't have timers when I was the age of sleepovers and a cheeky gander at babe station when the parents had gone to bed. Had to wait though because you could only watch one channel at a time and we all dreaded the day babe station would suddenly flick over to the history channel for upstairs

AskReddit,fdvw0wp,t1_fdvv1h6,1578752253.0,"Isn't that kind of the point of the episode tho? The duality of him just being nice to a kid vs Oh no actually he's a paedophile. Plus, I think pedos tend to have like *really* specific tastes so she might not have been his 'type' anyway and maybe he *was* just being nice but now that is tainted because we know he likes little kids."
