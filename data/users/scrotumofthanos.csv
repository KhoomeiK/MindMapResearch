ForHonorVikings,fen9hoy,t1_fen984v,1579279887.0,I get where you're coming from but the only thing she really shares with the berserker is her side attack but even that's different since zerk can only do that as a light whilst shaman does a heavy.

You can't win with these sorts of people, welcome to the club brother."
retailhell,fekcil6,t1_fejxb89,1579197185.0,"I'm not even kidding you retail overall has sucked me dry of any real happiness, social skills, or dreams I've ever had. My current job has finished me off."

happy,fcxp4x5,t1_fcud7dr,1578068191.0,"This is honestly one of if not the biggest thing that's keeping me going. I wasted far too much cash on this shitty stuff and for what? I haven't gained anything from it besides weight. I'm wanting to go on a holiday to somewhere I've never seen before, perhaps somewhere in europe or even somewhere sunnier. I've always wanted to go to somewhere like Columbia."
happy,fcxosse,t1_fcu6nlh,1578067978.0,"Thank you so much friend. I unfortunately know first hand how dangerous they can be, my older brother is a fully fledged alcoholic and although I love him I dont want to go down the same dark path he's far too deep into. So far I've coped, had some uncomfortable symptoms but nothing that's raising massive alarms just yet."

RantsFromRetail,fc6q34z,t1_fc5sy1v,1577486624.0,"I can see where you're coming from and I can safely say that's not accurate at all when it comes to myself. I come from a working class family who's known hardship especially around christmas time. Sure what I said might have come off as a little pompous but its not what I intended.

I would think if you know anything about working in customer service/food service you would know that over time you build up such a hatred of people due to shitty customers you forget about the good people amongst them hence my rant."
