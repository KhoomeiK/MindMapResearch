When I was little Ken the Corona man would deliver soda in glass bottles and you'd get 10p for returning them. The bottles were returned, cleaned and refilled. This was 40 years ago.

Ken also sold veg on wednesdays and video rental on fridays. I lived in quite a small village with one corner shop and a pub. Ken saved many car journeys to the supermarket which was some miles away. He probably did more for the environment 40 years ago than the most dedicated recycler could hope to do in their lifetime in the present day.

Thank you Ken."

Soap and water is sufficient for washing hands in a community setting. I despise this over reliance on antibacterial agents since it minimises efficacy in settings that really need it, I.e. hospitals. 

I have 3 cats (until very recently 4) and an incontinent dog with dementia. I'm not one for cleaning but I do like tidy spaces.

It's no coincidence that autoimmune diseases are on the rise as we don't give our immune systems the workout they were designed on a regular basis for eg big infectious agents like diphtheria, campylobacter etc. And our over reliance on antibiotics means that there's not much left to treat these big life threatening infections when they do happen. That's why it's really important to do the basics, you know. Like washing your fucking hands when you enter a room covered in shit and touched by people who have wiped their arses and touched their genitals.

unpopularopinion,fdsjg2d,t3_emzd2c,1578703906.0,"FFS! You wash your hands to rid them of contamination by faecal aerosols and other biological threats left by people not washing their hands. When people shit they literally spray tiny bits of shit into the air. The shit then lands on everything and contaminates it. It’s why you should keep your toothbrush covered when not in use. 

I don’t wash to combat my own bacteria etc since my microbiome will encourage a natural immune response. But other people carry different biological threats to me hence the need to wash. If you eat after visiting the toilet you are literally eating other peoples’ shit.

E2A: also washing when you toilet encourages a certain frequency of handwashing that will rid you of other microbes you’ve picked up from elsewhere.

Oh, please please don”t use the antibacterial hand gel. You generally don”t need to sterilise your hands and the gel only works on already washed hands. Organic matter denatures the gel rendering it useless. And it encourages bacterial resistance which means it won”t work in hospitals etc where it really is needed.
