I am actually so thankful for this sub. I post here semi-often and always receive such positive support. This sub makes me feel not so alone."

cancer,ff6stcq,t1_ff6se3w,1579634151.0,"I didn’t think you meant it in a rude way. My apologies if my previous comment came across harshly. Seeing how my dad reacted to chemo and pretty much knowing the outcome of pancreatic cancer, it was a battle he was going to lose either way. Pancreatic cancer has a 2% chance of survival? Something really slim like that. I just wasn’t ready to face that realization at the time. I think if I were to ever get diagnosed, I would not want to do chemo. It’s incredibly harsh on the body. I remember after his last treatment, he refused to go back because it almost killed him. I don’t blame him."
cancer,ff6rzul,t1_ff6ox7m,1579633657.0,"My dad would do the same thing. He would amplify his sneezing lol you could hear his sneezes from across the restaurant, I swear! 

There are things I’m mad at myself for too. It’s hard forgiving myself. But your father knew you were safe, and that is what mattered to him."
cancer,ff6ro89,t1_ff6no05,1579633461.0,"I’m not sure. It was pancreatic cancer that spread basically everywhere. I think if it wasn’t for the chemo, his last few months would probably have been a bit more enjoyable at the least and not filled with stress and starvation."

dating,fev1i97,t1_feurclx,1579392079.0,"Haha! I got your comment notification while driving and couldn’t help but crack up. I definitely get you though! I’m trying to bust some guts, not trying to talk like a toddler."
dating,fetd1n6,t1_fetcagb,1579374063.0,"Early 20’s. Definitely too old to be talking like this. I encounter it more when I get to know them a bit more. The more they get comfortable with me, the more they do it. Some girl did it on the first date just a few days ago, and I just had to shut it down. Couldn’t see her again because of it. She started talking like that and I asked her why she was talking like that and she looked at me as if I was weird. She even said “what? You don’t do baby talk”? No, I don’t do baby talk. I’m 23! I’m not a baby."
dating,fetcdru,t1_fetc7f5,1579373871.0,Is it a symptom of past trauma or really just a character thing?
dating,fetbkj0,t1_fetbart,1579373646.0,"Definitely! Not going to lie, I did this crap in high school too. But I’m an adult now, and I’m dating other adults. It’s just weird. It’s like they are still in the high school dating phase."

Like they mispronounce words like a baby and talk like one too. I understand the cute pouting a woman does and stuff, but the baby talk is just too far."
dating,fetasu5,t1_fetafp1,1579373419.0,I don’t know how to explain it. It’s like talking as if you were a baby? all soft and cute like
EnoughLibertarianSpam,fetalej,t3_eqf0zf,1579373368.0,"But like, this is also just a generational issue. This is how they grew up. My grandma was a slave in WWII, worked more than she slept. Once she was freed, she worked here in America knowing no English. She was probably about 12 when she was captured. I remember when I was 15, she couldn’t understand why I didn’t have a job. I didn’t need one at the time because I was just a high school kid living with my mom obviously and was living off of her like most 15 year olds. But because she worked her entire life, and because her friends worked their entire lives, she just didn’t comprehend why I didn’t need a job."
