crashbandicoot,ff3s8lh,t3_erhp7w,1579547733.0,"“Rubber Hose” Crash is basically just Japanese Crash. That is probably the main reason why I prefer the Japanese design. It is just way more simple and timeless, like Mario or classic Sonic."
AMCsAList,ff1vrdy,t1_ff1susw,1579487275.0,"The pilot killing actually represents everything that I am talking about. The only meaningful death in the film just comes from a nameless, faceless enemy soldier who is portrayed without any nuance and only bloodlust. It feels like they really stripped the humanity from the Germans to give the movie an easy villain.

The main character then shoots his way through several more faceless soldiers in that town before he chokes out an enemy soldier with seemingly little thought. It feels more like a video game quick time event showing the stakes of battle rather than another example of the war’s senselessness.

There is a general detachment from the implications of what our protagonist is doing and I credit that largely to the bias of Mendes who seems to have set out to make a film that glorifies his late relative. I am sure that these stories were exciting for him to hear as a kid but they feel really inappropriate when depicted like a thrill ride to a modern audience and I am legitimately worried that this film will do lasting damage on how future generations perceive WWI.

Colonel MacKenzie is a perfect example of side characters handling the little critical exposition there is about war. It feels like something tacked on to the end of the movie to drive home ‘war is actually bad’ when they just spent two hours turning it into a linear video game.

The bodies really do not seem to add much aside from set design — it almost feels like Indiana Jones encountering skeletons in a temple or something. It serves the pacing and storytelling rather than the themes and messages the film has to give us about war. We also don’t really see many on screen deaths and they are largely relegated to the final battlefield scene, in which they are relegated to the background as our protagonist runs.

And yes, you admit what my top criticism of the movie is, in that trench warfare is basically absent for the entire movie. We don’t see the repercussions of chemical weapons. Rats and disease are unsettlingly used to comedic effect as opposed to comedic effect. Barbed wire is a brief piece of startling set design that is never revisited outside of the intro. We see a single dogfight from a distance. It is the videogameification of war that was as far from an action adventure as possible. This was a war that stole an entire generation and striped the world of its humanity. I see none of that in this movie. It is a thrilling experience and it absolutely should not be."
AMCsAList,ff1av72,t1_ff1a1tv,1579476915.0,and there are plenty of people out there who would disagree with you on this because it seems to be the primary criticism of the movie that I have seen
AMCsAList,ff15n04,t1_ff0t90l,1579475484.0,"You can’t see how general audiences could easily misinterpret it as being an action movie? It stands in stark contrast to something like *Dunkirk*, which I have heard a lot of casual moviegoers refer to as ‘boring’ (it was not). Nearly all of the scenes here take place outside of the trenches and follow the linear path of our protagonist who basically shoots his way forward and dodge bullets on what feels like a theme park ride and not an exposition of the horrors of WWI."
AMCsAList,ff14lsm,t1_ff0n13v,1579475135.0,"it has the pacing of an action movie and the framing of an FPS story mode

it is completely unrepresentative of trench warfare and the horrors of WWI, often approaching points of seeming to glorify or justify it, and the few critical moments are basically sidelined to offhand remarks by secondary characters (particularly in the last 15 minutes of the movie)

it seems more like a tribute by Mendes to the courage of his ancestor, whereas most other WWI movies act as a direct condemnation of the senselessness and brutality of the conflict

the bunker escape scene almost feels like something from an Indiana Jones movie

the music is often times very inappropriate for what is happening on screen

trust me, I am far from alone with these criticisms"

movies,feuvkkw,t1_feutunq,1579390395.0,"I do think that the prequels are legitimately bad movies and most of the points in them are valid. I do think he went in way too hard on *Revenge of the Sith*. That review was kind of the turning point for me where I started to realize that they were focusing on things that really do not matter in the grand scheme of things.

I never read the rebuttal but someone really does need to put them in their place. They definitely have done a lot to contribute to the toxic state of pop culture discourse, not just with the *Star Wars* prequels and *Ghostbusters* but they kind of are directly responsible for terrible things like CinemaSins and Animated Atrocities. The way nerds watch movies now is broken because of them, and it has extended to other things too (the vitriolic reaction to the last Chance the Rapper album comes to mind). It is like the cynical RLM style fused with Gamergate harassment tactics and that is applied to any major pop culture event that has the potential to ‘ruin childhoods’ or not meet whatever unrealistic expectations that these people have on a given day."
movies,feus525,t1_feur6sb,1579389390.0,RedLetterMedia has basically become the very type of people that they directly criticized in their prequel reviews. They are nerdy nitpickers who look at movies as a binary checklist as opposed to an artistic experience meant to move the audience.  Their analysis has shifted from ‘this fundamentally does not make sense and here is why’ to ‘this does not appease me and my desires.’ They rant about things clearly not made for them (men who grew up around 1980s popular culture) and spend their time whining about things like female Ghostbusters **years** after everyone had forgotten about that reboot. It is sad because I used to really like the Plinkett reviews but they have just become way too reactionary for me to tolerate anymore. They fear a changing world and cinema.
movies,feun3t7,t1_fetpspb,1579388109.0,"*Whiplash*, *The Grand Budapest Hotel*, and *Boyhood* (I said it — it got railroaded by a smear campaign) are all significantly better films than *Birdman*.

boxoffice,fe48nuq,t1_fe0l7cs,1578856840.0,"most of the entire first stretch until they reached the house felt like the story mode of an FPS — the escape from the bunker straight up feels like Indiana Jones in tone and it is really weird

the only real major death in the movie is caused by a knife fight too and not the brutality of the battlefield

then you have that entire stretch of the battle in the village where he is dodging all of these stray bullets and just taking men out from a distance — the most ridiculous part of the movie is when he chokes one out and it almost plays out like some quick time event

the linear ‘single take’ thing does not help either because it just gives the vibe of a video game and that is just really inappropriate for a WWI movie, which really should be focused on the horrors of trench warfare instead of mostly sidestepping them or exploiting them for set design

it is a masterful action movie that took a lot of technical thinking to pull off but it left a bad taste in my mouth and I have seen *a lot* of other people saying the same thing on places like Letterboxd and Twitter

*Vice* was purely designed as an Oscar contender. *Phantom Thread* was directed by PTA and featured the final DDL performance. *The Post* was a Spielberg movie and was basically always a lock. *Hidden Figures* was always always viewed as an underdog story in that race. *The Revenant* came fresh off of the previous Best Picture *Birdman* and had a huge campaign for Leo. *American Sniper* was Eastwood and also basically a lock based off of its gross. *Selma* only won in a music category and was generally viewed as a huge snub that year.

Context matters.

It’s not **always lethal** but it definitely does not help. And none of these movies were serious contenders for Best Picture outside of *The Revenant* (because he won the previous year)."

boxoffice,fdxyc9f,t1_fdxl831,1578774180.0,"*1917* has all the money and publicity campaign of Comcast backing it though. They knew surefire that it had Oscar potential and basically paid to bombard voters for the past two months despite the movie not even being out. This movie had a huge budget and was **designed** for the Oscars. It is completely different from something like *Just Mercy*, which is a standard lowkey Oscar drama that will not be competing in the technical categories, and Warner treated it as such.

I saw both and I honestly believe *Just Mercy* is a much better film. *1917* plays out like a linear video game while *Just Mercy* has some incredibly powerful filmmaking in its death row scenes. *1917* is very technically impressive, of course, but a film about one of the most brutal and inhuman wars in history should not feel like a theme park ride. They completely ignore things like chemical warfare and most of the movie takes place outside of the trenches. There are times where it almost feels like a pro-war movie. *Just Mercy*, even if some viewers see it as cliche Oscar bait, just has so much more emotional depth and really won me over in the theater. People cheered at the end of my screening.

I agree that it is tragic that they overlook great black actors like Michael B. Jordan, and that speaks both to Warner’s lack of confidence in this film and the racism of the Academy itself."

He also uses The Wrecking Crew on those early Mothers albums, which gives it a similar sound to things like *Pet Sounds* or the Simon & Garfunkel albums. They were also produced by Tom Wilson, who did the early Bob Dylan albums and the first two Velvet Underground albums. Those early Zappa albums are very much in line with what The Beatles were doing at the same time (sprawling, experimental psychedelic concept albums), and *Freak Out!* was a big influence on *Sgt.

I actually think *Knives Out* has a stronger shot at a nomination, especially given the box office. I love both movies and think they each have a good shot at making the list.

*Uncut Gems* is the real tragedy of this season. They released it way too late and it will probably be ignored. They should have swapped its limited release date with *The Lighthouse* and given it wide release around Thanksgiving.

I wouldn’t call *Parasite* a lock either, sadly, simply because of how the Academy treats foreign cinema. It doesn’t have the name recognition or Netflix backing of *Roma* either, although public support seems phenomenal.

*Joker* I could see going either way because of the controversy. It sort of feels like this year’s *Bohemian Rhapsody* except actually decent.

*Little Women* getting released so late I think was an intentional act of sabotage by Sony because they did not want anything competing with *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* and do not want a Beat Picture win in 2020 with Amy Pascal’s name attached, plus they figured that it would probably do best as a family holiday movie (which is valid).

that say that the career arc of Chris Terrio is comparable to that of Rian Johnson in any way is absolute insanity

as has been said a million times over, *Star Wars* is not comparable to the MCU and in fact Disney’s attempt to copy the MCU formula and give an individual character a prequel spin-off is precisely why *Solo* failed, because they had spent zero time doing what Feige had done at Marvel and just expected a bad film to work because it carried the brand — even if a huge box office disappointment, the fact that *TRoS* is doing this well with such bad reviews shows that *Solo* was a failure unto itself and the product of a multitude of bad decisions at Disney

for what it is worth, most people that I know enjoy *TLJ* but are hesitant to see the new one because of what they have heard from friends and how bad the RT score looks, which was the top topic on Twitter for a full day prior to opening night

*TRoS* opened to the worst critical reception the franchise has ever seen which immediately tainted word of mouth — a movie with 54% is going to go downhill no matter what franchise it came from, and *Star Wars* never had the Chinese market to back it up, unlike *Jurassic World* which will be huge in China no matter how bad the series gets in subsequent installments

and ignoring the fact that *Solo* also had a pretty weak critical reception and had a bloated budget because they basically remade the entire movie with a significantly worse director

all while *The Mandalorian* seems to be a huge success by any measure

I don’t think the issue is *Star Wars* — the issue is the quality of the last two movies (*Solo* and *TRoS*)

Guess which one actually matters to the average viewer? And guess why it has that RT score? Most of the critics are complaining about its deviation from TLJ!
movies,fcb0tp6,t1_fc7vpky,1577580455.0,"He is Armenian, which means that he is probably Christian. They say his last name early on in the movie and it ends in -ian. That is why his relative complains about him saying “happy holidays” during Passover like it is Christmas and compares him to an “intruder in the tribe” or whatever."
AMCsAList,fc797nh,t3_egj8qe,1577500873.0,*Midsommar* was my #1 until *Uncut Gems* came out.
StarWars,fc52dkt,t1_fc529hy,1577439541.0,"I was worried when he announced like five other projects within the last year.

They will probably still make it without him eventually and it will be an abomination."
StarWars,fc528nk,t1_fc50pzo,1577439340.0,He needs to make *Akira* before they hand it to someone bad. He is the basically the only person I trust to do a decent job with it.
AMCsAList,fc326bt,t3_efv618,1577379733.0,It has been like this for a decade if not longer (that was the reputation when I lived there).
todayilearned,fc2wdx5,t1_fc2jm5z,1577375810.0,"I mean I have heard the story phrased this way many times over and I have never heard of this podcast

it is pretty standard Hollywood trivia that OP probably had never heard before"
NintendoSwitch,fc29umf,t1_fc16cik,1577347590.0,*PaRappa the Rapper* is censored now because they used some copyrighted milkshake name so I would believe something like this
todayilearned,fc28wb3,t1_fc1zhka,1577346073.0,"or maybe they posted this because it is Christmas and this is a movie highly associated with the holiday and they were probably just reading about it somewhere today because it is a pretty well-known story that has been written about all over

this is some bizarre gatekeeping"
todayilearned,fc28ra4,t1_fc255af,1577345860.0,are you seriously worried about people not receiving royalties nearly a century after the fact
todayilearned,fc28n99,t1_fc27qiv,1577345693.0,"Right, and that has nothing to do with time, so it is literally not an example. The same thing happened to *Charade*."
todayilearned,fc28fau,t1_fc1jbys,1577345362.0,"Frank Capra was already set in stone as one of the greatest Hollywood directors of all time by the time *It’s a Wonderful Life* was re-evaluated by the public. If you direct multiple classics like *It Happened One Night* and *Mr. Smith Goes to Washington* then people will without a doubt examine your entire catalogue.

It is kind of a similar situation to *Singin’ in the Rain* — it was never an obscure film, had A-list names attached to it, and got a lot of press at the time (both were nominated for Best Picture), but people did not truly recognize them as masterpieces until decades after the fact. Both fully live up to the hype and deserve their place amongst the greatest films of all time. There is a reason why they transcend the much-derided AFI list and are held as influential by auteurs and critics worldwide."
fanedits,fc20g28,t1_fc0yrrz,1577335633.0,I actually think it would benefit from being longer and having more meditative scenes or room to breathe. Hopefully there are deleted scenes that can make it feel a little less scattered. You can’t repair the core issues with movie (the Palpatine stuff) but hopefully it will be possible to make it flow better.
StarWars,fbzqbh4,t1_fbyy7vb,1577256232.0,a lot of other people are clearly spending money on *Knives Out* so I really don’t think he needs your box office receipt lol
StarWars,fbzq8aw,t1_fby1cgf,1577256123.0,yeah this is a nuclear bad take
StarWars,fby042r,t1_fbxywlc,1577204874.0,"They are both terrible. That is what I was getting at. I was saying that at the very least Terrio did not slip in weird libertarian stuff into *Star Wars* this time.

I don’t think the movie was ruined. I had fun. It is just a mess but still somehow surprisingly enjoyable. They really should have let Rian finish it or given it to Edgar Wright, but Disney already burned their bridge with the latter. J.J. has never really been an auteur either and has no clue how to elaborate on the initially interesting ideas he creates. I assume that Terrio was just there to please the DC-types with geek fanservice, and I actually did not mind a lot of the throwbacks. My problems with the movie were bigger (mostly Palpatine).

I cannot think of a single Snyder movie that I consider good. They are all ugly, meandering pseduointellectual redditbait that represent pretty much everything that I hate about nerd culture. He feels like someone who watched *Fight Club* and took everything at face value."
