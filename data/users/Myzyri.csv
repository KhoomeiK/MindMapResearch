Personally, I think the owners kid got into an argument with some friends and they took revenge. They added “Trump” to try and point blame in a different direction. 

In the case on our block, the family that was targeted was a Mexican woman with a Japanese husband. Someone spray painted “Beaner Chink” on their garage with a swastika.  It turned out to be a couple Hispanic girls who got into an argument with the couples’ daughter at school. They tossed in the swastika to make it look like some white racist skinheads did it.

But it seems like all these countries that operate so smoothly and throw their noses in the air operate on a different scale.  They have a much smaller population, they’re *generally* pretty xenophobic (yet still helpful in crises, I must say), they tend to have taxes around 50%, and they also tend to have a generally homogenous culture as “people of XYZ country.”

America is no longer a melting pot.  They’re teaching kids that it’s a salad bowl because no one should be assimilating and losing *any* of their heritage. Again, I may be wrong, but *on the surface,*I think this creates more of a divide and makes it more difficult in bringing us together.  So, we have different cultures that have vastly different belief systems and opinions on the virtues of a “good” society.  We also have very different incomes, jobs, taxes, government bureaucracies, etc. 

As I see it, comparing the USA to Finland is like comparing apples to oranges because what works there for certain aspects of society could never ever work here.  There are too many differences and such a huge gap in wants, needs, and balanced implementation procedures because someone will always be left out.  And that’s no longer acceptable because changing something for the people who are left out is either considered favoritism or discrimination depending on what accommodations they’re given."

I’m seeing a lot of this in schools. 

My neighbor’s 6 year old was home from school. I saw hime home playing video games in their family room (it’s a glass room - I wasn’t being a weirdo). When I saw my neighbor, I asked if he was sick. Nope. Keep in mind, he’s six. He called another kid a “homo.”  First, the other kid wasn’t. Second, he didn’t even know what a homo was when they asked him. He heard it being used as an insult somewhere and thought it was funny of whatever. Suspended for 3 days because THE TEACHER was offended. The teacher pushed for the suspension because the kid had offended her so much that she needed to see her therapist for an extra session!!!  WHAT THE FUCK?!?  

Here’s another. My daughter was in KINDERGARTEN and I got called to the school in the middle of the day. They said she couldn’t go back to class until I came to the school because she said something “so inappropriate” that they couldn’t “have other children exposed to her” until I spoke with her. They wouldn’t tell me what she said over the phone. I cancelled appointments, I cancelled on clients, and one was a $10,000 deal. I was terrified that my daughter was going to get expelled or something. What the hell could she have said?!?  

I get there and she’s in tears. I comfort her and the teacher’s assistant and principal take me into a conference room and tell me it’s inappropriate to have my daughter present.  Omg. I’m freaking out. Did she bust out the N-word?  Did she go Southpark on a disabled kid?  What the fuck?!?  I get in there and the teacher tells me my daughter offended “the integrity of the entire school” when she loudly asked....  are you ready?  Brace yourself...  if you’re easily triggered, stop reading...  she loudly asked “Who farted?!” when she smelled something gross. 

I went silent. I was fucking livid. You bring me in here for that?!?  She’s a kindergartner. Farts and burps are hilarious to five year olds. Fuck, I’m 40 and I love a good fart reference!  I manage to stutter out, “Are you serious?”  They ramble on about it being inappropriate and offensive and blah blah blah. Then they ask, “We’d like to bring her in. Can you please explain to her why this is so offensive?”  

They bring my daughter in and she looks FUCKING TERRIFIED. I don’t know why. I rarely yell and I don’t beat her or anything. She’s a good kid. I can only imagine what one of these bitches was saying to her about how she’s going to be in so much trouble. 

I hug my daughter and say, “You’re not in trouble at all. You did absolutely nothing wrong. Don’t say fart in class. Even if you have to fart, or smell a fart, or think a fart is funny, or anything about farts, because farts are offensive and you shouldn’t fart or talk about farts. Go back to class.”  

As soon as she left, I turned to the teacher’s helper and the principal and unleashed with, “Do you realize how fucking stupid this is?  SHE’S FIVE!!  You drag me down here and make me cancel work because she said FART?!  You’re out of your fucking minds!”  This is when they asked me to leave. This is when I told them that any kind of retaliation against my daughter would be met with immediate legal action. They rolled their eyes as if they’d heard that before. The principal actually flinched a little when I handed her a business card for my family’s law firm and said, “and it won’t cost me a single penny but it’ll make you look like a ticking moron!” 

And I left. I damn near had a heart attack. I was so pissed off. And I still am a decade later. My daughter doesn’t even remember it and I’m glad she doesn’t. They wanted her to be punished because the teacher’s assistant was offended by the word fart. Ridiculous."

The more we talked, the more I realized I’d never be able to do everything she asked. I could probably work up a good piss, but that’s about it. 

As for details...  she basically said she liked being pissed on and shit on. She didn’t want to eat any of it as a meal, but “a little taste can really get me going.”  The thought of a wet diarrhea shower got her all excited. I could never do that to someone. Another thing she said she enjoyed was having someone pee in her ass. Weird, but not crazy and not really messy. Piss in her pussy was another weird one. The worst was when she told me she wants me to take a shit on her pussy and try to get it inside like a shit-dildo. She would then fully pack her vag with my shit. Once she was full, she wanted me to fuck her shit-filled pussy.

My grandmother died in 2018 and everything was squarely on my shoulders. The funeral itself was $16,000 for the casket, one night of visitation, prayer cards, and the “standard stuff.”  On top of that, we laid out an additional $600 to a deli for sandwiches, drinks, pastry, etc. and here’s where I lose my shit...

The funeral home recommended Jen’s Guest House in Willow Springs, Illinois for the meal after the funeral. They told me it was a family style blah blah blah and a good price (like $14-15 per person). 

I was so distraught, I glanced at the bill and just handed them my credit card. We had about 30 people and the bill was in the low $700 range (including their automatic 20% tip). So, with quick math in my head and a couple drinks, it seemed correct. They gave me the receipt, I signed, and jammed it in my pocket. 

When I got home, I freaked the fuck out. I looked at the receipt and it was for almost $1300. It was $15 per person and there was a 20% auto-gratuity and the WAITRESS added another 20% on it. Then, I had a $600 bar tab!  It listed 17 beers and 3 glasses of wine. Each beer was $32!!!!  Each glass of wine was $20!!  I called and asked if there was a mistake. I was rudely informed that i already got a discount because unless I had 20 beers, the price was $35 each. FOR A BOTTLE OF FUCKING SHITTY BUD BEER. Wine was $25 per glass unless there were 20 ordered. I don’t even know what the discount would have been. Then I mentioned the 40% gratuity mistake. I was rudely told “you signed off on it.”  Yeah, I signed off as I was saying goodbye to my distraught family while I was emotionally upset and you’re shoving a bill in my face. I was distracted. And yes, that was partially my fault. 

In the end, I called American Express and disputed the charge. I didn’t pull the entire payment, but I reduced it to $15 per person, $5 per beverage, and 20% gratuity not including alcohol. American Express fully agreed that the alcohol prices were outrageous. After a couple weeks, American Express said I won my dispute because the restaurant refused to return their calls and offer a defense for their gouging. 

To this day, even though I got most of that money back, I’m still fucking livid over that kind of price gouging. They’re a simple restaurant in a Chicago suburb.  For fuck’s sake, stadium vendors and the hottest nightclubs in the trendiest neighborhoods don’t even charge that much for a beer!"

Trade it in over in Indiana?  That won’t work. The tax is connected to your residency. (Although I just heard on the radio that may not be the case, so don’t quote me on it, but I initially heard it was tied to residency.)  

Just like many years ago, people from Illinois would buy cars out of state because of cheaper taxes. Illinois made sure they got their taxes by tying it to your state of residence, not the state in which you purchase. And I bet the trade in tax will be the same if it’s not already. Mainly because Illinois car dealers will be screaming if people aren’t trading in over here. Used cars are the bread and butter of car dealerships (profit is up to ten times more on a used car). 

As for leaving...  Just because I don’t like a handful of things about Illinois doesn’t mean I’m going to leave.  My businesses are here, my family is here, and there are many other things I like.

UpliftingNews,ffieq93,t1_ffi80su,1579972104.0,"It’s not an obsession. It’s a very deep concern. The Education Advisory Councils for the various professions are the entities who develop the material to educate professionals on dangers/changes/highlights to their professions. Most of the changes are there to protect the public from being defrauded, but most professions have a council. 

When I say professions, I mean anything that requires a license to operate in Illinois. This includes any profession that the Illinois Department or Financial and Professional Regulation oversees.  Doctors, lawyers, mortgage brokers, bankers, mold remediation people, asbestos removers, plumbers, etc. 

No, I wasn’t on the council, but it scares me that they’re not there anymore. For my profession, they sent out emergency notices for safety and sent out interpretations of new laws in quick bullet-point summaries. It’s not the end of the world for my profession because we’re surrounded with lawyers and vendors who will disseminate the information (albeit more slowly).  My job works with the public, but is more financial. But what about professions where health and safety are the concern?  Their councils were developed to keep the public safe, too. And some of those entities were made of up hundreds of people researching chemicals. Let me make up an example based on asbestos and lead based paint from years ago...  You’re a home builder. You got a general contractor’s license 15 years ago. You don’t have to go to continuing education or any kind of refresher course every now and then. A new law goes into effect stating that carpeting made by Wang Industries contains old asbestos fibers and anyone caught using it after *today* can face fines and be sued because home-buyers are at risk. Or some kind of woodworking varnish you use causes kidney failure in pets and children.  The Education Council is who informs you. They inform the people who generally won’t get it from another source.  And it depends on what kind of person you are, but you still need to know...  Are you an asshole who uses the last of your supply anyway?  Are you the one who’s just afraid of being sued later?  Are you the type to go back to previous clients to notify them?  Or are you the angel who goes back and offers to swap out the carpet for previous clients and encapsulate all the woodwork with a fresh layer of non-toxic topcoat? 

For some professions, it’s not a big deal. For others, it’s a huge deal. And not all of the education councils were disbanded. I’m only upset about ones that protect the health and safety by getting information out in a timely manner. Instead, in many of these cases, the education council was disbanded and the disciplinary council was expanded to handle more cases of people breaking the law...  because they weren’t informed of it by the council that used to keep them up to date. 

The tiny conspiracy theorist in me (I usually don’t buy into that stuff) thinks it’s just about making more money. In my profession, a minimum fine is $1500 and that goes up to $65,000 depending on the infraction. (The fines can be lowered by the disciplinary council, so it’s $1500 on paper, but the disciplinary council could make it less than what’s written.)

And you’re right. I’m not unbiased. What I do involves a lot of licensed professionals and for one area, my products are passed on to the public. I’m a realtor, a real estate educator (independent - never been on the council and never knew anyone on it), and I’m also a home builder. This affects me less, but it’s still a concern since I contract a lot of work out to other licensed professionals. What are the chances that there’s going to be some earth-shaking change in plumbing that will kill a sale?  Zero. But if people are working with the public and people are trying to make safe products for the public, the people involved should be up-to-date on the best and safest practices.

Maybe that’s just me, but I’ve seen a lot of horrible things. I had an old lady who had mold in her basement. She hired a mold remediation to come out. He used some cheap biocide and basic primer to make it look good. She never went in the basement and didn’t realize that the mold came back in force. She had paperwork and insurance, but the contractor disappeared. The paperwork showed that the biocide listed was outlawed years earlier. And, her insurance company wouldn’t pay because, in Illinois, home insurers aren’t required to pay for mold remediation.  The house is still there filled with mold 15 years later. I assume the old lady died by now.  We were never able to sell it because she couldn’t afford to repair it. 

In the end, I just feel that more information and readily available help can never be a bad thing for people who want to be the best and most current at what they do."

You go to trade it in and you get taxed again on the same car, but since the value is less, the tax rate is 3 times what it was when you purchased the car. 

We’re not talking about rich people. We’re talking about average citizens being taxed “just because.”  My sister had a new Subaru Impreza. She and her husband ended up having twins a year and a half later. She traded it in because she needed a bigger car. She’s not rich. The tax wasn’t in effect back then, but she had a $14,000 she wanted to trade in for a bigger one. They don’t make a lot of money, so losing $2k on that trade in could have been a burden when moving up to a bigger car. 

In the end, you seem to be okay with large taxes as long as their not routine.  Why is it okay to tax people just because you can (especially when it’s a tax on something you already paid tax on)?"
UpliftingNews,ffhk169,t1_ffhgizc,1579938823.0,"There’s the problem. Illinois tries to fix the problem by raising taxes. Period. There’s no cost cutting and if there is, it’s a lateral move as an expenditure. Let me explain. 

In my previous comment, I said the education council was disbanded. We saved money!  Cost cutting!  Not really.  6 seats were added to the disciplinary council. Those jobs are 2-4 days per month and the pay is just under $100,000. The education council had 17 employees making anywhere from $22,000 to $38,000 and the chair making $123,000. Most were in the $25,000 range. Its a government job. Their salaries and names are all public record. They saved roughly $580,000 by firing 17 people. Then Pritzker created 6 jobs for his cronies that cost $588,000. That’s not saving money. That’s spending more and making the entire system worse. 

As for taxes, were taxed to death over here. In fact, we’re “double taxed” with the governor’s new used car trade-in tax. You trade in your car for $10,000, you owe the state up to $2000. You already paid the tax when you bought it. Now you pay when you sell it too. Recreational marijuana is now legal in Illinois. Recreational marijuana tax is 10% up to 35% depending on what you’re getting and how much THC is in it. A pack of cigarettes in the city of Chicago is $14. In Indiana, they’re $5.00. Gas tax is insane. We have one of the highest gas taxes in the country. Chicago sales tax is 10.25%. And anything from the Illinois government has a surcharge like Ticketmaster. I renewed my personalized license plates for $208. It’s a sticker. I paid $208 for a sticker. On my other car with regular plates, it’s $151. When you pay, there’s a $3.50 convenience fee.  Illinois is known as “The Land of Lincoln.”  It should be called, “Death by Nickel and Dime.”"
UpliftingNews,ffhj5mw,t1_ffhdsta,1579937630.0,"I’ll reply to your points like you did. 

1. I apologize if it seemed like I was attacking you. Not at all!!

2.  You probably won’t hear about it in the news. I learned about it because I’m a real estate broker and I also teach prelicensing (the classes you need to get a broker’s license). I had to read the new license law because Pritzker changed it back in August. We went to the Education Advisory Council for help understanding the changes so we could educate our students and our offices. Guess what?  The Education Advisory Council wasn’t there!  I mean, they were, but they weren’t working. They were archiving so the could be out by the end of December. That’s when I started looking at the sweeping changed Pritzker made at the IDFPR. It’s crazy. 

3. Property taxes in Illinois are insane. Mine are $9,000 per year. I don’t live in a mansion. I have a friend in a nicer neighborhood who has a 2000 square foot, 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath, with a 3 car garage, and unfinished basement. He pays $16,000 in property tax. It’s out of control.  As for the trade-in tax for cars, Illinois House Republicans have already drafted a repeal. Who knows if it’ll go through. 

4. I don’t have a problem electing a billionaire because it’s ALWAYS going to go to their head whether they’re rich or not. It’s the way politics works. They go in all idealistic. They walk out giving pricey speeches. 

5. Become a millionaire and pucker up, buttercup. I’m sure he’d love it."
UpliftingNews,ffhcl63,t1_ffgyfj7,1579929946.0,"As an Illinois resident (just outside of Chicago), the governor is insane. He’s a multi-billionaire and he’s instituted or proposed crazy taxes. He’s also cut funding for professional education councils. 

For taxes, he has already implemented a tax on used car trade-ins. While the tax could currently be up to 16% depending on your municipal taxes, he wants to implement a flat 22% tax for trade ins. This is double-taxation to gouge people who can afford to buy a car.

Another tax he wants to implement is one to keep people from leaving the state. He wants to implement a real estate tax if you want to leave the state. If you sell your primary residence and move out of state, you get nailed with a 5-11% tax. But here’s the HUGE kick in the nuts. It’s not only a tax on your primary residence, it’s a tax on all property you own in Illinois. Maybe you bought a cheap vacant lot years ago. Maybe you inherited your parents’ house and you’re renting it out. Maybe you own a dozen apartment buildings. They will estimate the value on *all* your Illinois property and tax you on it. That’s his great plan. Tax tax tax tax tax.

As for education, he’s ended several professional education advisory councils. The people who come up with education guidelines for many financial sectors all got fired. He gave that job to legislators who aren’t in the field. He also expanded disciplinary councils for all those fields. Many were expanded by 5 or 6 members. And guess what, they’re *all* positions that are appointed by the governor. They’re not hired or elected or promoted. They’re fat cat friends of a billionaire governor who supported him and the got appointed to $100,000 a year jobs where the only requirement is to hold disciplinary hearings a couple times each month. It’s a perfect job for people running big companies because they don’t have to take much time out of their schedule to suck up some taxpayer dollars. 

This state blows and so does that poseur Pritzker. Talks about the poor, taxes everyone, pays barely anything in taxes himself as he exploits the hell out of everyone who’s hard work feeds his bank account."

We don’t know that what we’re doing now is going to pay off later, so we re-evaluate to make sure we’re not doing something stupid. 

Look at my neighbor’s dumbshit kid. He picked up a hammer and a box of nails. He pounded the whole box into a tree trunk. Then he got more nails and pounded those into a tree trunk. 400 boxes later, he had a hedgehog tree. 

He wanted a treehouse. Had someone told him to step back and evaluate whether or not he was making progress after the first box, he wouldn’t have wasted his time. 

(This really happened to a degree, but he was nailing board to the trunk. He was about 7. Now he’s 20 and I have no idea what he does, but he brings home a lot of men and sucks their dicks in the back yard. It’s so weird. Right in the open. His parents have this “boys will be boys” attitude. So weird. I mean, hey, he’s gay, that’s fine. But you don’t suck someone’s cock on the patio and not flinch when neighbors come out. Boys will be boys!  Suck a cock in broad daylight!  Silly boy!  We’re in the suburbs. My patio is 40-50 feet from his. I’ve also seen him get blow jobs from women. I don’t know what his deal is, but I’ve caught him at least 20 times. How many times has he done this where he *didn’t* get caught. And I’m not looking, but I’ve got kids and don’t need my young daughters seeing that. I’ve mentioned it to him and he apologized.  But did it again, so I mentioned it to his parents. But boys will be boys!  Fucking weirdos. He’s gotta be a walking STD. Good lord. I’m becoming the neighborhood kook.  Sorry.  I’m done.
