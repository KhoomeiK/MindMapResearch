relationships,fegb61m,t1_fefyj4c,1579085874.0,He says that our house is clean enough so we don't need to clean. He says it doesn't bother him to live in a messy house so I guess I just have waaaay different opinions with my bf. But maybe it is true that he just doesn't care at all and say that because he is lazy and want me to do everything for him. We definitely are not a good team.
relationships,fegavzh,t1_fef7ugs,1579085481.0,"I wish it was this easy. We have tried doing it but  he ends up not doing the chores. He says he ""forget"" to do them or says that he will clean or wash dishes ""tomorrow"" or ""soon"". It never happens even if I wait. Sigh..."
relationships,fegao3e,t1_fef9ilz,1579085181.0,Yeah I have started to feel just the way you said. That I want to play house... And I'm really embarrased because of that. I'm young and these comments I have read made me realize many things. I don't have a lot of experience and maybe I just act that I'm much older than I really are. I wish I just could chill and be calmer about things but having all housework done feels like it is the goal I have to achieve every week. Maybe I just need to calm down because the reason we are in this situtation with my bf is possibly my fault. Maybe. I'm not sure. I kinda wish that I was as carefree as my bf is.
relationships,feg74nk,t1_feg5kmv,1579080145.0,"Maybe I am codependent, I've been lonely my whole life and my bf is the only one who have ever loved me and took care of me. He's my only friend. I'm really shy, introverted and have anxiety when only thinking about socializing and I hate being like that. I don't try to hide it because I know that I have problems. I'm having a shitty life and flowers and chocolate are the few things that make me happy because I don't have anything else. And maybe I am dump because I'm afraid of losing my only relationship and that's the reason I'm still in this relationship.

I'm sorry if I try to defend myself. I don't do it on purpose. I've come to conclusion that I myself have a lot of problmems because of my attitude towards people and my bf. Yeah I know my boyfriend isn't perfect either but I'm not any better than him. I'm sorry if I sound hypocrite... All this just makes me really confused and anxious."
relationships,fefuwmq,t1_fef2p3e,1579065981.0,"Thanks for your comment, it was really helpful for me! I reserved an appointment to meet my counselor tomorrow."
relationships,feejffd,t1_fedy2hv,1579034970.0,Because of all these comments I got I can promise you and all other people here that I WILL NOT DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. You all made me realise that my school is my future and I will be awesome when I finally graduate. I'm going to be a famous architect and no one can stop me. I will settle this relationship problem up and start focusing on my studies more after I have solved the problems with my bf.
relationships,feehx84,t1_feefx00,1579034099.0,Thanks! I understand now what you are saying.
relationships,feehqbi,t1_feegxc8,1579033986.0,Thankfully he is and he tells me that often.
relationships,feeeq43,t1_feedu60,1579032231.0,"Not at all... But you do dump decisions when you are in love. And I'm still in love so i will do the dump things again and again... 
But when the things are great and we don't fight I have the life I've always wanted. Ugh... This is so complicated."
relationships,feee5ry,t1_feecy9n,1579031898.0,"Thanks for your reply! Your comment is important and I will definetly think about these things. I have a huge burden on my shoulders and I have decided to take it even though it is not necessary. As you said, I have to take a step back and think about my decisions."
relationships,feedkcv,t1_feebos4,1579031548.0,"Managing his eating disorder is not my job, but if I had an eating disorder I'd be so grateful for the person who takes care of me when I myself can't. I do it because I love him. Maybe it is fucked up but that's the way I am. And I hate being like that. Sometimes I wish that I just could not care about people. But it is not possible for me. 

And yes, I am stupid... I think too much about other people and don't focus on myself. That's one of my biggest problems of myself. You are right when you say that I need to take care of ME, not him. After reading these comments I get I've realized that I'm not a perfect person either and I have to think about myself more."
relationships,feeam2f,t1_feea4ab,1579029823.0,Yes I undestand that and I know that normal person would eat if they are hungry. I don't know if you saw but in one comment I told that my bf has an eating disorder and that's why he can go several days without eating at all because he just don't feel like eating. He is really underweight and because of that I fear he will starve. And this is the reason I'll give up and make food for himself too.
relationships,fee951i,t1_fee8ulf,1579028959.0,Me.
relationships,fee6zc3,t1_fee5gbf,1579027688.0,I didn't say this in the post but I think it is relevant now. He has an eating disorder and that's the reason I fear he will starve. If I don't make food he doesn't eat at all and can go like this couple of days and that is the point when I give up and make him food. Luckily he's in therapy.
relationships,fee5mwn,t1_fee509z,1579026893.0,"Some of the reasons I love him: if I'm sick he makes me food and says that I can stay in bed. After a fight he will eventually apologize and buy me chocolate. We can have long and pleasant conversations and I love it when we do activities together (like play games, go to cafes, abroad, cottage). He always says that he loves me and that I'm beautiful and it feels really good. He has many good traits and I really enjoy being with him when the situtation is good."
relationships,fee505s,t1_fedyui4,1579026517.0,"He has a superpower to sleep even if I try to make noise. He says it doesn't bother him. I have also tried to do exactly as you said but I always end up doing food for him too because I start to fear that he will starve. I guess I'm just too kind person. I admit that I can be a monster but it can't last long and after I have calmed down I'm the kind and supportive person again and I make him food, wash his clothes etc. and do suprises for him as an apologize of my attitude and behaviour."
relationships,fee3x5e,t1_fedyl2r,1579025879.0,"Thanks for your answers! I think you are right. 

>what makes this relationship something you want to keep in your life?

I don't really know why I am like this. I'm maybe afraid what will happen if we broke up. I don't have friends so if we broke up I'll be lonely as hell. When my bf helps me or spends time with me he is the most wonderful boy in the world and usually after a fight he brings me chocolate or flowers and is very nice for me. It feels good. But eventually we fight about chores etc. again and we are back in the start again. I seriously need to think these things and talk with my bf about the situtation."
unpopularopinion,feaxlg8,t3_eob6mb,1578953254.0,I think it is ok to boil whatever people want to boil if they wash the pot afterwards. Plus when you boil water most of the bacteria dies.
AskReddit,feaw9s0,t3_eoauw8,1578952829.0,I live in Finland. It is currently snowing right now and in Lapland we have even 90 centimetres of snow.
toastme,fcz0s7r,t1_fcyz7xr,1578091363.0,Oh I love ABBA! I'm going to do it right away!
toastme,fcz0mvt,t1_fcyz7o2,1578091266.0,Aww that was cute! Thanks a lot!
toastme,fcz0l7x,t1_fcyzstb,1578091237.0,Thanks for telling! I'll remember that.
toastme,fcyz6ma,t1_fcyyqd2,1578090331.0,I'm not really sure if it is the right term to use in this situtation. English is not my mother tongue so I just guessed and directly translated the word from Finnish to English. :'D
