But if it's just cause they're still growing then that makes me a lot less nervous. As for the skin peeling it was happening half a year ago and if it was a yeast infection or something its most likely gone. After reading the article its most likely just growing cause yeah puberty and maybe allergies cause it feels like the itching is from beneath the skin so I'm going to take some antihistamines and see if that helps"
