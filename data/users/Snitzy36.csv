It's like this. Imagine paying for a private tutor and going to their house to learn about maths. If they don't want you to make political statements at their house, that's their prerogative. They can kick you out for it at any time without any lashback. Public universities don't have this option because they take money from the government, and are thus subject to the same laws as any government institution."

> Students at public colleges and universities enjoy the full protection of the First Amendment. The core purpose of the First Amendment is to protect speech, especially political speech, from censorship. As the Supreme Court of the United States has written, “Whatever differences may exist about interpretations of the First Amendment, there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.” Mills v. Alabama (1966)."
