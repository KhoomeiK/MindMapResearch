GuiltyDogs,ff77qze,t1_ff75sw1,1579642778.0,That comment was mildly agreeable
AskReddit,ff5puv3,t3_ergjyj,1579605265.0,"Woman comes over she's lovely and chatty, she tried to return some goods with a receipt over 28 days old, I said I can't refund them but we can exchange them, as soon as I said this she flipped she said there wasn't anything she wanted, I told her she could hold onto the items until there was something she wanted, she flips out and trys giving her items to people still queuing who just look at me like wtf is she doing. 

She leave to find some things anyway and comes back about 20/30 mins later almost in tears saying she doesn't understand why she cant just have her money back, so I politely state it's just company policy everywhere has a refund period of around 28/30 days.
She starts to cry and hyperventilate as I'm trying to put the transaction through so I ask if she is ok is there anything we can get for her a glass of water or does she just want a minute to calm herself. 
She gets angry and says she just wants to get out saying it's not fair that she has to shop in store when there nothing she actually wants with the usual ' I'm never shopping here again' so I finish it and theres still a couple of £ to be spent, she says can I not just put it on a credit note, I say no we don't them anymore, so she grabs these candles from the next customer waiting in line and says just put those on, literally just snatches then from the guys hand
He then gets called to a till with empty hands looking at me like 'can you pass them back please' I'm like I'm not messing with this clearly unstable woman mate' so I asked for another pack over our headsets to be brought down.
All the while she randomly turns round after I've scanned them and give the candles back to the guy, at this point there is still like a £ to be spent and shes crying her eyes out at me when my manager brings the candles over, she then cries harder cause she says she didn't want the candles, I said but you told me to put then on, she said after having a go at me 'I was trying to buy them for him, are you stupid' (she never stated that, she only said just put them on) 'your not listening to me' I replied I'm trying to but your not explaining yourself clearly, I've tried to be as helpful as I can.
At this point my manager stepped in and ended up putting the £ on a gift card for her which only angered her more cause she said why couldn't we just do that in the first place even though my manager had explained we don't do it, it's a one off.
At this point I walked off I'd done all I could to stay calm and I'd had enough. My manager said the gift card she threw it at another customer and told them they could have it before walking out. 
Absolute mental bitch."
