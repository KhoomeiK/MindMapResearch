Unless you mean the OTHER slang definition for gay, and you're the sort of person to use homophobic comments that automatically imply that being gay is bad and/or stupid, in which case \*you\* are bad and/or stupid & Fortnight still isn't able to be gay because it has no body."

Wellthatsucks,feyjpo1,t1_fer4rfe,1579446431.0,"it's populist creep. The Liberal party didn't have the votes to form government without catering to some group of conservative swing voters & they chose the alt-right. Once you start to do that crap, you have to keep catering to them to stay in power. In short order the new loonies in the party push for their favorite talking heads to run for office because they feel welcomed.  So those talking heads run for office, get in, and then you NEED those new MPs (who your swing voters like) to be happy so their alt-right fans will stick with the coalition.    


A little while later you have the three stooges (Abbot, Turnbull and Morrison) creating a steady creep to the alt-right for the whole party... with Peter Dutton rubbing his hands together and thinking about how grand it would be to be an authoritarian despot.  


The same rot happens to all large political parties.  Given time they embrace 'big tent politics' for the votes, and grab for big money because it can be used to win elections.  To keep that cash they essentially become lobbying firms that make money by selling political influence. This has happened to both big parties in Australia, the USA and the UK.  


This is what populism gets you."

no we can't. Humans can only survive in a small window of environmental conditions. The universe is a vast and uncaring place and we are fragile.  


This era has been one of the rare times in our planet's history when the conditions necessary for homo sapiens to thrive been here for long. The planet has gone through some serious extremes, and two of them (extreme ice ages, and of course extreme heat and oceans with lots of hydrogen sulfide) are both things that can happen from high levels of greenhouse gasses.  Indications in the oceans show a very real chance of the planet moving into a phase of really high global temps with extreme weather, a highly disturbed (or outright stagnant) gulf stream and big hunks of ocean dangerously high in hydrogen sulfide (which would kill us all). The world's fisheries feed the majority of the human population and they have been collapsing for a while.

The Liberal party (like the Republicans) continually refuses all sane economic policy advice, despite constant warnings from economists and from our reserve bank.  The only tool the reserve bank has to fight the dumb, is the official interest rate. They keep trying to keep the economy from crapping out so the the official rate keeps on dropping.

First, even if the law is still fucked up where you live, his effort to blackmail you into sex counts as ""without your consent"" because it is coercion.  So that was attempted rape via coercion even if the laws where you are fucked up & disagree (most sexual assault laws are idiotic in at least some aspects).

Second, since you are under 18, that video of you counts as child pornography in much of the USA (and other locations) so he's in serious legal trouble. He showed it to you, which most likely counts as distribution of child pornography.

So Third, no matter how embarrassing this is to you, you need to tell your parents. And no matter how they react, the cops need to be brought in.  If they won't - you gotta report this guy. Ideally you need some additional proof (like via messages on your mobile if you can get him to say something incriminating in a chat),

That person needs to be charged with at least child porn, and attempted blackmail. In a US jurisdiction, the DA will try and scare the little piece of shit into copping to a far lessor plea (because in the USA very few people convicted ever see a trail) ... and that will more than likely keep him out of prison - but with an arrest record & at least one conviction."

Not only were they funding their favorite  terrorists in direct contradiction to Congress, but that drug reference.... the CIA was selling coke by the ton to the bloods & crips in the USA - to raise money for the illegal support of the Contras.   Cocaine flooded the USA at low prices and this got the gangs so much cash they could afford really good guns. So US streets turned into shooting galleries with automatic weapon fire. A whole lot of people died. They don't even bother lying about this anymore."

He really did have dementia.  His health was bad after being shot ... and yes the US did need 'gun control' back then - in the form of having abetter aim so that assassination bullet could have done it's freakin job.  


Honestly though, he wasn't ok & he wasn't in charge.  He fell asleep all the time in meetings. He no longer knew that the roles he had in Hollywood were just acting gigs.  He thought he had been a navy pilot, not just in a movie called Hell Cats of the Navy.  Nancy,  GHW Bush and the cabinet ran the nation. Nancy did a lot of it and she fucking used telephone psychics to get advice. When the info came out Republicans stuck with Ronnie.  So mostly Nancy and GHW Bush were in charge - and this happened at the point where the US and USSR were the closest to nuclear war that they ever got."

Back in the mid to late 70s there were still towns (like Burbank) where it was illegal to be in town after dark if you were non-white.  The cops enforced it. Just like South Africa... come in & clean houses and leave before dark.  


Oh yes, and we shouldn't forget Ronnie and his actions toward People's Park.  Reagan sent the guard in to beat the hell out of (and shoot) a bunch of college students and hippies in a public park.  I have a relative by marriage who was there when it happened.  It was a park set aside by the city with permission for them to be there - but it was associated with the left & various student movements, and Ronnie wanted to make a statement to his base. He was playing to his audience."
