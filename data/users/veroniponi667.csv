1) Sleep - most adults are chronically sleep deprived. We don't sleep enough and when we do, we don't get the quality of sleep we need. It's not always possible, but on your days off force yourself to sleep-in. Try to put your phone away before bed and don't fall asleep to a TV; the quality of sleep you will get will play a huge difference. 

2) Exercise - science confirms that exercise is one of two best things for anxiety and depression. More specifically, long endurance exercise such as running, walking, or biking that not only release dopamine in the brain, you give your body and mind enough time to relax and ""space out""

3) Meditation/mindfulness - the other second scientifically backed way to remove anxiety and stress. Meditation takes practice, but the goal is to disconnect yourself from your thoughts. You are practicing being in the moment and not thinking. Similarly, mindfulness is simply being in the moment. It is very important to spend even 30 minutes a day where we do nothing NOTHING. (What rocks do) You are not watching tv, not sleeping, not distracted by noises, and not concentrated while driving; you are simply laying or sitting in silence for as long as needed letting your brain relax. 

4) Social interactions - again very important to have friends and family who you can be honest with, talk to, and spend some quality time with."

Anxiety,fcjk6h2,t3_ehidcs,1577690883.0,"What you have is very common and I think to a certain degree is natural. You obviously have an anxiety, but you are able to cope with it to at least live your life. Research shows that the two best things for anxiety are Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Endurance Exercise. Unfortunately, there is no trick that you can learn to just get out of it because anxiety is a completely natural part of human nature and even the healthiest people experience it. The way I view research of CBT and exercise is like this:

1. You want to make yourself feel as good as you possibly can.
2. You want to change the way you think. 

BODY

So let's break that down a little further starting with the first one. I always say, it is rare to find athletes who suffer with mental illness because mind and body are connected. You may also notice that sleep, eating, exercise, and health are all intertwined. Generally if one suffers all of the other suffer.  Just as anxiety physically alters chemical composition of a brain so is exercise. Certain things not only simply make you feel good, but they actually restructure your brain chemistry which is why things that bring positivity into your life are so important. For instance, I am sure you've heard of ""runner's high"" it is a real thing because running is one of the best things to increase dopamine in your brain which is responsible for feeling of pleasure or well-being. Stress is just the opposite because it reduces serotonin. So you want to eat healthy, exercise, have good social relationships and just do things that help you enjoy life and elevate your mood. 

MIND

CBT, Guided Meditation, and Mindfulness (ability to be present in the moment and be aware of your surroundings) are all essentially different form of the same thing. In short, you are spending time in your brain and restructuring your thought process to be positive. Confidence is defined as:  a feeling of self-assurance arising from one's appreciation of one's own abilities or qualities. You  basically not only want to tell yourself that you will be ok, you want to believe it, and even more importantly believe that even if tragedy happens you are more than capable of overcoming it with positive outcome. 

The things I practice that have been helpful is first allowing yourself to be truly bored; it is just you and your mind no distractions. You will quickly realize that being without stimulation is very weird, but your brain is much more capable of rational thought when it is not bombarded by external stimuli. I also love to hit a sauna at the gym, to take a hot bath at home and make it an experience, and I force myself for 5 minutes before bed and after sleep to simply be in the moment to feel my body and acknowledge life and my symptoms."
Anxiety,fcjj987,t3_ehic1z,1577689753.0,"There will be no magic solution, but ask yourself what would you tell someone who was afraid of driving a car or riding a bus? Probably something along the lines of ""try to get a good night sleep, that cars are very safe, just take a deep breath."" 

You want to get yourself out of the panicked state and increase general well-being and then consciously redirect your thoughts. I would recommend taking care of your body in the next couple days by increasing your dopamine levels (running, walking, exercising, taking a hot bath, hitting a sauna at the gym) are all excellent ways to knock yourself out of the overthinking and only then when you are not TOO stressed trying to meditate and work on your thoughts. 

You are not going to cure your fear in a week, but your goal is to fly as rested and feeling as well as possible with your mind having some positive thought ammo loaded to help you deal with it. But also, just accept that you might be a bit anxious because you deal with it and that's ok!"

First think of things like this:

* Worry is a mental process of thinking more than needed about a particular event with emphasis on the likelihood of negative outcomes.
* Anxiety is a general state of being over-vigilant to bodily senses and events while constantly seeking out and expecting something to go wrong.
* Peace is ability to be aware of life and certain life events, but not be concerned with them.
* Confidence is the ability to know that you are able to overcome adversities, that negative events are unlikely, that you are in control of things in the future, and even if the future brings an unfavorable tragedy, it doesn’t have to be severe or result in negative outcomes.

Cycle of worry

Trigger (bodily sensation, distressing thought, or external observation), Tunnel vision/fixation on that thought, Assumption of negative connotation or possibility of it, bodily response (muscle tension, shortness of breath, body tremors, increase in heart rate), more fear because of the bodily symptoms.

Your Goals

* Decrease general anxiousness and increase general well being
* Decrease moments of fear, work on confidence
* Control Panic Attacks

Steps

* Decrease overthinking  

   * Learn to not dwell on thoughts and being in the moment, but don't try so hard that it becomes work
* Work on redirecting negative thoughts  

   * Practice mindfulness such as guided meditation or just simply being bored and in the moment for an hour during the day. You want to become a friend with your thoughts and control the direction of how you think instead of running away from them. You DO NOT want to distract yourself from negative thoughts as they never truly go away, but come back later on.
* Increase general positivity  

   * Work on things that increase your dopamine such as running, taking a day to relax out by the sun, go for a hike, or I personally love to spend a relaxing day at the gym stretch, run, and maybe chug a beer and hit a sauna and go swimming.
* Work on your body  

   * Create a sense of general well-being through quality sleep, mindfulness, relaxation (hot bath, sauna, hot tub), take vitamins, exercise, limiting alcohol and caffeine, limit time with TV and computer

Panic Attacks

Accept that some days they might just kick your ass even when you did everything right because even completely healthy mentally strong people can get anxious or have a panic attack.

Because your thoughts and fear trigger real chemical responses in your brain and physical responses in your body, the goal is to reverse those symptoms and climb out of that cycle.

* Remove all distractions
* Sit down or lay down in a comfortable position or if at work maybe go to the bathroom.
* Start by relaxing your face muscles
* Close your eyes and take a couple deep breaths and try to slow your breathing.
* Bring your awareness back into this moment by simply acknowledging your presence. Say I acknowledge my heart beat, I acknowledge life, I acknowledge my breath, I acknowledge the pulse in my fingers, I acknowledge death, I acknowledge my presence in my own body, I acknowledge my city and universe. Move your awareness around to those areas as you say those things. If your mind starts giving opinions about it, say it's neither good or bad; I simply acknowledge it.
* Then go for a walk or a run and take a hot bath if you can.

Think of these two quotes

* We are so focused on spending time with others or watching TV that we forgot time to spend quality time with ourselves in thought and wonder.
* We are not bothered by monsters in our closet that we can’t imagine, it is when we start to imagine them, they manifest themselves to be real and then we start fearing them. Just as the things we fear become real when we imagine them, we need to learn to alter our thoughts by imagine positive outcomes. When a warrior steps in the ring and he is not scared. He has fought there many times, and yet he is in the ring for the first time. But he has trained for this moment and imagined being there many times. He imagined facing his opponent and prepared for every move possible and impossible, likely and improbable. He knows exactly what he is going to do and he has a plan. He has imagined victory and accepted the possibility of defeat, but he is prepared to win."

I had to look backwards not at what I want to do, but at who I am and then based on who I am I was able to narrow down a career choice which then I thought made perfect sense. Don't worry about a specific job, because my last two professions were in my field and I did not even know those jobs existed. I would suggest making it a process of doing research, looking at interests, taking career tests, and then when you don't seem like you are making any headway just letting it go and allowing your mind to process that information. Once you gave yourself a couple weeks or however much time you need, try again. Eventually you will figure it out."

Anxiety,fce931j,t3_eh4t14,1577618129.0,"It sounds like you are doing all the right things already, but just accept that some weeks could be worse than others. I think running makes a difference because specifically running and cycling are the two things that increase your dopamine. Literally sometimes three miles of an easy jog is a tremendous difference as I'm sure you've heard of ""runners high"" before which is why running is so great. 

Also spending a day to just disconnect from the internet and stay away from TV. I have one day where I force myself to sleep in, hit the gym and just do whatever the heck I want to (literally have fun without structure) maybe get a great stretch, go running, and then hit the sauna and go for a swim."

Anxiety,fccty11,t3_eh1mjl,1577602598.0,"Sometimes you can get into a mental fog of tunnel vision or fixation where you feel generally unwell and may even feel negative like a sense of impending doom, fear, or and nausea. It is completely normal as anxiety can manifest itself in a number of ways. Just remind yourself that you are ok, but that it is also sometimes normal to feel like this especially for someone suffering anxiety. 

It is unwise to distract yourself from your thoughts which only further reinforces the fear towards them, instead, I would recommend doing some things to simply make yourself feel better.

* Close your eyes and take a couple deep breaths. This carries extra oxygen and will make you feel better. 
* Take a hot shower or a hot bath. You want to relax your body and your muscles.
* Go for a walk or for a run. This increases serotonin (chemical responsible for feeling of well being) in your brain. 
* Make sure you get a good night sleep. 
* Also, try guided meditation if needed  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vx8iUvfyCY&t=539s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vx8iUvfyCY&t=539s) 

For anxiety prevention you want to try not to let your anxious thoughts build up.

* Give yourself time during the day to be ""bored"" to meditate or just space for your brain to think without distractions. This is a form of mindfulness and connects your consciousness to your body and reality essentially helping you see the norm. 
* Make sure you eat healthy, exercise, sleep well, and limit caffeine and alcohol. Anyone of those things off balance generally throws everything else off balance with it."
