In later years of the empire it was more based on Christianity rather than Roman culture itself as what identified it (to my understanding at least). If it was just the Roman Empire and Byzantine empire I would agree but in a text that says ""Roman empire"" from 1127 that could be referring to two completely different entities and when a modern historian translates that they're going to have to label it as one or the other based on context."

thanosdidnothingwrong,feko04t,t1_feknitk,1579204028.0,"So the hulk is capable of beating back one of the alien centipede things by bracing himself against the floor right? Those things also had the ability to plow straight through buildings. Since hulk is a lot denser than the buildings he needs less resistance in total but that's still a clearly large amount of muscle mass. Hulk likely weighs around as much as a house, packed into a much smaller space. Since thanos with the power stone was able to basically match hulk for strength but outdo him in skill, and we don't have an exact measurement for how much stronger the power stone makes you, we can guess that thanos weighs between 500 pounds and maybe like half the weight of a house in pure muscle."

So eventually they decided to give him to a family that could keep him safer. They happened to have some friends two states over (were in Washington so the only real options are California and Montana, but I'm unclear on the specifics) who were looking for a cat.
