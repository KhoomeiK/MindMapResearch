That would only apply to an Orc with a 2H axe though. Non human/orcs still need 9% and if you're dual-wielding going above 6 or 9% isn't a total waste either, even if it's not ideal."

wholesomememes,fewbff5,t1_few2wid,1579407939.0,I did and I'm sorry if it seems like I'm disagreeing with you. I agree but I'm also trying to add some additional context and how I would feel in that situation.
wholesomememes,few59hb,t1_fev18l0,1579405593.0,"Honestly this is just a suggestion so take it with a grain of salt, but if you're worried about it, if you find someone you like and start dating, I would just take it a bit slow. Don't get into the bedroom for a few months even. Let them know that you might need some reassurance. If that's what you need, then that way you have time to feel out your relationship and who they are as a person. All relationships are going to have a physical aspect but there's nothing wrong with taking time to get to that point.

If you are happy being single that's one thing, but I think it's better to take a chance and see what happens than to deny yourself the chance."
wholesomememes,few2afm,t1_fev0t6g,1579404485.0,"As a guy this is just my personal take, but I would never get tired of my girlfriend complimenting my appearance. Whereas almost any compliment from a girl I'm not talking to/dating would make me uncomfortable. I also generally don't compliment any woman unless we're already involved at some level. 

With that said, I feel like I can understand where that feeling comes from in women but I also feel like at some point you have to give a guy a break if you're dating him. If you feel like he's only interested in you physically that's one thing but if you disparage him for complimenting you and he was being genuine that would feel really awkward for him. Ultimately it's complicated but if you find someone who you can just enjoy their compliments and want to compliment them too I feel like that can go a surprisingly far way."
