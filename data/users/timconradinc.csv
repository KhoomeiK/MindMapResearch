AskFoodHistorians,ffdpbpk,t3_et176w,1579825766.0,"archive.org has old books and there may be something. I know that there's books from the late 1700's from a British perspective.

Generally I'd suggest figuring out what routes ships would be taking of that era. The ships themselves change too as the Med would have had smaller ships than ones going elsewhere.

And really think about not having any sort of refrigeration.  I think you're thinking it'd be a lot better than it would have been. Sailors jobs wasn't to do stuff with food. Their job was to sail.

Even as with modern times, the Capitan would have the most luxury. While in port, they probably would have had a servant that would have been able to quickly go and find the favorites and return them to the ship. Something no one else on board would have had.

Officers would be similar to now - food would have been better and overall treated better. Not sharing berths even if they were only big enough for a bed and a writing table.

Regular seamen had ranks, as well. But generally all ate the same food. But surely higher ranking seamen had better choice to the food.

There's also a distinct difference between Naval vessels, merchant vessels and pirates. Keep in mind that piracy most likely isn't what you think it is. But it was a way to make money.

Unless you have really specific desires for the 17th century I'd recommend around 1800. There's a lot of information about that era and the age of sail."

(This is a cookbook written 'for men by men' - it seems to be [celebrities of the era](https://archive.org/details/stagcookbookwrit00sher/page/34)) The cookbook itself mentions that every recipe is tested, but that recipe plainly states that the pasta is to be cooked for an hour.

Which really bothered me. Doing research into the words 'pasta' and 'macaroni,' I found that prior to the 1920's (Per Harold McGee in On Food and Cooking) people would cook pasta for long periods of time like that.

I don't recall which cooking / travel show it was, but they were in Italy and talking to a chef there. The chef mentioned that when people were poor and didn't have money for pasta, they'd grate stale bread on top of it. It looks like grated parm, and helps the sauce stick to the noodles like parm does.
