SuicideWatch,ff70k7r,t3_erww7i,1579638704.0,"It's ironic isn't it, that you can have the kind of quality in life that includes experiencing the beauty of nature, a meaningful job, lasting relationships, no lack for food or shelter--things that many ppl strive for--and yet the thought of needing to end it all seems so much more reasonable than continuing living. Society just needs to get on board and destigmatize death. I'm sure it's been mentioned somewhere else already but how is it okay that ppl can put pets out of their misery and yet ppl are made to feel guilty for considering suicide, when it's usually a decision made after much serious thought.  I think it's so forward thinking that Belgium and the Netherlands have assisted suicide for mental health conditions*--the world needs to stop torturing ppl with so-called treatment and let ppl die with dignity.

Btw, this is not to say ppl shouldn't get treatment if they want it--just that ppl should be respected for informed choices.

*it's a rigorous process though; there must be proof that all avenues of treatment have been tried and a panel of doctors review the cases"
SuicideWatch,ff369v5,t3_era6pi,1579534694.0,"Is this your first one? Cuz I was pretty broken up when my first relationship crashed and burned. Of course, everyone has their own unique experiences when it comes to being in a relationship, but after dating other ppl, I realized, at least for me, that ""love"" is only what you see on TV, in the movies, and in fiction, because at best, all you'll be able to find, is someone you each can tolerate. Actually, that's not completely true; most times, I love Mom unconditionally. That's it though. Couples? I think the number of divorces speaks volumes. I'm sure many couples feel they're in love at the beginning of the relationship, but that does not last. I hope you find other things in life that are meaningful to you besides this idealized thing called ""love,"" what I feel is an illusion (delusion?)."
SuicideWatch,ff33xrc,t3_eraoax,1579533055.0,"I feel selfish to say this, but I hope you're still alive because I really like the way you write. 

If you're not a writer, you should think about getting into that field, because you're thoroughly compelling as a writer. You resonate.

I mean, “a blob of sadness and anxiety.” Enough said.

And then you follow that up with “I hate my existence. I apologize to everyone that knew me.” So on point.

Of course, I totally don't cotton to your second to last line because I read your post and in no way did I feel I wasted my time. Also, high school years should be erased from everybody's memories. THAT was the real waste of time.

And you're so right--it would be a bummer to “wake up quadriplegic or with more mental issues.”

So I hope I get to read more from you..."
CaregiverSupport,felfzcg,t3_epk1m5,1579221278.0,"sorry you're having to deal with it.

if you're able to, maybe you can have one wheelchair for the outdoors, and one indoors.

after so many years, insurances will usually spring for a new wheelchair."
languagelearning,fekzv8l,t3_epfjnd,1579211059.0,"There's a lot of good suggestions about how to go about studying, but in your downtime, maybe try to find English subtitled j-dorama (it would be nice to find videos with both English and Japanese subtitles and maybe there are in Japan but I was only able find English subbed videos in America including on Netflix or Viki and YouTube, although there are options to download videos and add j-subs via .srt files which might be a good investment of your time but you just need to make sure you download from trusted sites (I think you can download Netflix videos)). Perhaps in this relaxed period of passive listening/engaging, you'll figure out the common words without even having to try too hard. 

Ganbatte ne!  頑張ってね!"
SuicideWatch,fejdx01,t3_ep3z6q,1579169304.0,"it is weird that the majority of ppl feel they need to talk ppl out of suicidal thoughts; it's almost like a god-syndrome, that they feel they know what's best for you and sure, many have good intentions but they see things through blinders. they can't fathom that there is a logic behind certain suicidal thoughts because it's a blind spot and they will forever believe it's wrong for ppl to commit suicide; they cannot see that suicide as a possibly reasonable choice. i don't know if it's ok to mention this, but the netherlands has an assisted suicide process that's not easy to get approved for, but if a candidate is approved, part of the process is having meetings with friends and family so that everyone is in the loop and not shocked by the act/procedure when it finally comes to it."
SuicideWatch,fej8np2,t1_feimtwu,1579161656.0,"I'm not saying whether you should or shouldn't kill yourself, but just for the heck of it, have you ever tried therapy? It may or may not make a difference (as you can see I don't have strong opinions about this subject matter), but the one thing I'd like to say is, I doubt you're a coward--how is that even rationalized? I believe that there is a condition where a person can have a good, meaningful life, good friends and family, hobbies, and still feel like offing yourself at any given time, and whether or not treatment--be it talk therapy or meds--can help is one thing, but cowardice is definitely not the term I would use in what you're describing. I'm just wondering if, before you decide to end it all, if you'd thought of seeking professional help (and like any profession, there are good ones and bad ones, so you'd need to find a good fit, if you decide to go that route)."
caregivers,fe5oyhk,t3_eng3lt,1578872438.0,"It sounds a bit like you get what you give; that you are helping your client, begets others helping you with your client. Kudos/karmic points to you and them. It is definitely a wonderful thing. Like you, I'm grateful to the many ppl, who just happen to be nearby, who offer to help (opening doors or help getting mom in or out of the car), and when they do, find out many have experience with caregiving, some who are professionals (CNAs, RNs, etc.)."
podcasts,fcixmcm,t3_eh8pzz,1577672259.0,"Ok, so this is gonna fall in the ""curious topics"" category. One episode that might be of interest, is ""17 - You don't know jack: high on drugs"" (disclaimer: that this is my podcast on SoundCloud and other podcast sources (but maybe just using keywords: cantonese mandarin medical)) and it's ""curious"" because we're talking about drugs from history and into modern times like ancient Mayans using shrooms to communicate w/the gods to this year's Oakland decriminalizing shrooms; from the Roman Empire buffets of psychedelic fish to medical marijuana, past and present; drugs and wars, etc. HOWEVER, all of this is in the service of learning to talk informally about health and medical matters in Cantonese and Mandarin from an English speaker's perspective.

Btw, since this is a 15-hour bus trip you're talking about, the latest ep, ""25 - Using the public restroom - PART A,"" might be of interest... (just in case, bring pocket tissue (dry and wet), portable toilet liners, air freshener with you)

The former recommendation might be more suitable because back then, I was only introducing single-sentence episodes so there's just that much more in English explanations as opposed to the latest ep's nine lines of dialog. 

Bon voyage!"
CaregiverSupport,fcipx3l,t3_eh7084,1577667023.0,"Testament to the power of survival and family bond to the exponential degree. Kudos to you all for weathering the storm and vigorously living in the aftermath. I never paid any mind to alternative medicine--one could say, even disrespecting it--until I started seriously learning Chinese as a language and you can't learn the language without dabbling into its culture, so I got exposure to it that way, and a newfound respect for it. It doesn't mean that everyone should try alternative medicine--just that it does not need to be dismissed out of hand. I'm glad you all were able to reap the benefits of alternative ways of healing and living. All the best."
