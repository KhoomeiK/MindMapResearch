SapphoAndHerFriend,femqnfq,t1_femhgth,1579266774.0,">Grant had a huge amount of insecurity stemming from his humble working class back ground and lack of education. I think he used love and sex to bolster his self esteem, whether it be with a man or a woman.

I find it strange this isn't brought up more often with a lot of people. ""Sex addiction"" might make people laugh and say it's not real, but that always struck me as strange - it's obvious that sex, like food or drugs or alcohol or shopping, can be used in unintended ways to deal with uncomfortable truths or emotions. 

In terms of Grant, he even boasted how he did everything in moderation, except ""making love"". Considering he was an alcoholic and smoked a ton (and then gave it up? not sure), it's clear he had an addictive personality. If he used sex as validation, then he probably didn't care much who it was who was validating him in terms of gender or sex."

AmItheAsshole,fdsat9m,t3_emv42p,1578698332.0,"NTA.

What I really hate about this situation is that a lot of the stipulations they're demanding are individually not unreasonable, and honestly, your parents are making it really... ugly. Helping your siblings get around should be something an older sister should want to do (I used to drive my siblings around!), but by tying it to your usage of the car, demanding a bunch of money going into it, not allowing you to keep the car or take over the payments when you're older and moving to college, etc., your parents are making what should be helping you, and in turn you helping the family when you can, into a business transaction. What happens when you have an upcoming event but your little brother needs a ride?

In short, they got greedy and were outdone by their daughter. I'm going to take a wild guess that they aren't the type to feel comfortable enough to ask their kids for help when they need it. If you're the oldest, maybe that's something they just haven't gotten used to yet, and they'll learn from your (surprisingly very mature!) response that they put too many stipulations under the guise of ""good parenting"". That's the best case scenario. Worst case, they're selfish and want a legal slave. I'm going to guess the truth is somewhere in the middle (I'm hoping for your sake it's closer to the former)."

hbomberguy,fdknx21,t1_fdjinzp,1578507498.0,">Hitchens was pretty smart about a lot of things but I can see why the alt-right segment of the skeptic community sees him as one of their figureheads

Agreed. Christopher Hitchens is such a weird anamoly. He was a Trotskyist who was also sexist and for the war in Iraq. And he had a weird boner for the USA. 

That being said, he really wouldn't fit in well with the alt right. I think if they think he's a hero, they really should reconsider."

From the article:

>Climate change remains a huge threat to our globe, as does compassion fatigue in the rich world, and it’s likely that we will miss a United Nations target of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030. ***Meanwhile, here in the United States, Trump presents a continuing challenge to our institutions, and millions of families have been left behind and are struggling.*** We should keep pressing on all these fronts (the last one concerns me enough that it’s the topic of my new book), but we’ll get a morale boost if we acknowledge the backdrop of hard-won improvement."
