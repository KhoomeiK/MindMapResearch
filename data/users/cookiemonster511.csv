velvethippos,ff43f9x,t1_ff43ahk,1579554688.0,I can't take credit. The rescue named him and he'd been there for 6 months so he knew it was his name. It's grown on us though. We often call him Turtellini.
aww,fehxb8m,t1_fehwuk3,1579125718.0,Mine did it for two months after I adopted them. They were 4 and I got them from a friend who had developed severe allergies to them. I was at the point of thinking they must be completely unhappy and I was going to have to give them away when I found out about middening. People always tell you cats are clean and don't do these kinds of things so I was NOT prepared. They settle in shortly after that thankfully and it only happened when I went on vacation.
aww,fehwl1v,t1_fehacad,1579125302.0,There is a name for that behaviour: middening. Cats do it when they feel insecure. The cat feels insecure and wants to mark the place in the house that smells THE MOST like the owner to prove that they and the owner BELONG TOGETHER. No place in the house smells more like you than your bed and your laundry basket so those are popular targets. A friend had a cat that always pooped in her gym bag when she went on trips.
aww,fehvptg,t1_fehnxno,1579124814.0,Our terrier mix has a tail and when he gets really excited it looks like he is trying to touch his nose with his tail w/o turning his head. His back half comes almost far enough forward to do it too.
aww,fehvf28,t3_ep3shu,1579124643.0,Ours is smaller but when I've taken him to pick my partner up after a trip he's literally dragged me across large parking lots. At this point we arrange dog safe pick-up points and the one holding him just lets him loose so he doesn't rip our arms out trying to greet a returning family member.
AmItheAsshole,fcurgam,t3_ehw713,1577986990.0,NTA. You love your kid differently than your wife. And it is a more permanent kind of love because your kid is your kid forever. Your wife needs to talk to a therapist imo.
aww,fcn64wk,t1_fcmxqne,1577804280.0,All cats are secretly Sith Lords. Or Nazgul. Or Death Eaters. Pick your fandom.
aww,fcmnq3g,t1_fcmljsp,1577783279.0,There is no place to put a dog crate on a modern European train. There is barely space for carry on luggage on some of them.
aww,fc3i9je,t1_fc2j6m4,1577390393.0,Mine was like this. What helped my girl (who was plucked from the street with her brother and 2 sisters at around 9 weeks) was herbal supplements with lavender and valerian root. Any good pet store should have sth similar esp this time of year because of NYE fireworks.
aww,fbggvh9,t1_fbft7pw,1576849064.0,"Cats with special needs are often hard to find homes for so I am sure if you reach out to your local shelters they will have a friend and partner for you pretty quickly. I think adopting a cat who ""matches"" your disability is a great idea. It happened to me by accident - one of my cats had a wheat allergy and I developed a wheat allergy about 2 years after adopting her. I always joked that we could Freaky Friday."
