But that doesn't happen here in the US, just goes straight from red to green. You might know it's coming if you pay attention to things like the pattern of the crosswalk signals, but otherwise it's just a surprise."

crochet,fedrcns,t3_eon6y4,1579018233.0,"Pattern: [http://www.leeleeknits.com/cozy-and-free-baby-blanket-crochet-pattern/](http://www.leeleeknits.com/cozy-and-free-baby-blanket-crochet-pattern/)

Yarn is Hayfield Spirit Chunky, Sundown color. I love the way it worked up!

I made a couple of minor changes to the pattern: Instead of chaining and then doing a row of sc, I just did a row of fsc and then started in on the dc rows. I also made it a little bit wider and longer, final dimensions are about 24inx35in. I also did a bit more around the border - instead of two rows of sc, two sides actually have three rows and the others have two rows. I did that because of the colors in my yarn and how the edges looked - an uneven number of rows in the border looked more equal."
aww,fed2f4d,t3_eohdxm,1578995352.0,"I'm currently laying in bed with two kitties and trying desperately not to disturb the calm. They've been antagonistic and hissy ever since we took in the stray kitten four months ago. A few days ago, the older one started to join me in bed while I snuggled with the little one, but it hadn't lasted longer than about 10 minutes. Going on about 45 minutes of relative peace right now."

dcwhisky,fdqy8c1,t1_fdqxaxr,1578676625.0,"They hand out tickets to the line before opening. They tell you what bottles they have left and you pick which one you want. Pretty sane crowd from my experience. The line moves very slowly.

For the bottles they're putting out on the floor at various times during the day, there probably won't be a mad rush to get them.

For the lotteries. they usually post a list of names in the store window next to the door."

I don't think my tension was quite as tight as the pattern-maker because I had fewer stitches and rows for most of the panels - I just worked as many as I needed until I had the right dimensions for the large size. As a result, I used about one skein less of yarn than I expected."
