IdiotsInCars,fde1xry,t3_ekwmvs,1578329346.0,LOL at first I thought you posted in the wrong sub but I see you are sharing Barry all over the place.
socialanxiety,fdc0ld0,t1_fdc05ku,1578264805.0,Thanks for the idea! I'll check that out. I really do need some way to fill my time at night now that I'm not just sitting here worrying about another person :)
socialanxiety,fdbzaem,t1_fdbwp7t,1578264187.0,"Thank you for that :) I never figured out what I wanted to major in but I loved learning. I was really looking forward to college just for the sake of learning things and left after a year. I went back and left several more times, enough to no longer be eligible for the pell grant at least. I've been thinking about going back (I at least have 1.5 yrs  of classes finished) but it seems so expensive and I still never figured out what I want do, I just like to learn things :)"

leaves,fdby4vf,t3_ekjv2q,1578263672.0,"Time. It wasn't weed alone but I stayed in 2 abusive relationships for roughly 20 years and used weed/alcohol to cope. Lots of weed. I only drank after work, but I smoked in the morning, at lunch, after work, after work again, after work again, after work again, before bed, etc.  Just now working on dropping all 3. I can't really blame weed for all that but it did contribute greatly, for me."

socialanxiety,fdbszh2,t3_ekjhjy,1578261595.0,"I can't give much advice on how to proceed, but I can tell you how it went for someone who didn't break up, twice.  The first one was already abusive, cheated on me, I went with an open relationship as long as she was honest, she was not. She never worked or helped with anything just made me feel bad but I was still trying to make her happy. After 10 years she left me because I guess  I had nothing left to offer her. 3 months later I found myself in another relationship which I was started going downhill about 2 years in. Now 12 years into the relationship it is over and I'm looking forward to doing things I wanted to do 22 years ago. So I'm 38 with the mental state of maybe a mid 20s person doing things I should have done way back then and it sucks. 

I'd like to think my situation is a little extreme and that most people realize issues before this, but I was only barely into both relationships before I knew it was bad for me and I stayed both times. I've never been on a date (they both found me which maybe should have been a red flag?), never had my own room, hobbies, or friends, and I left college and never went back due to my unhealhty codependency. I had reasons every single time to stay together. 

Hopefully someone comes in with actual advice, but you can do this."

leaves,fcwc22x,t3_ej97kc,1578021931.0,At least you are aware and still working on it! I know I would struggle if lived with someone still smoking. Great job on realizing it wasn't a good decision and having plan for tomorrow.

socialanxiety,fcw3vm5,t3_ej870q,1578016545.0,I do this all the time but I don't even post things. I just tilt my phone so they can't see it and scroll back and forth over google news or something.
