Know that just being able to read this and comprehend is a blessing that some don't have, you have a phone or computer with internet, something that some dream about... I used to have deep depression, many years ago found myself on seizure watch in the hospital for 4 days for an ""accidental"" overdose. One day all the pain, emptiness and sadness was gone and I'll tell you what did it. I found a documentary on life in poverty on YouTube in the Philippines and in Mumbai. My issues, while so deep rooted seemed so fking small. Keep your eyes open to the positive in your life and your 100 days will be 1000 days before you know it, and you'll look back so much stronger."
