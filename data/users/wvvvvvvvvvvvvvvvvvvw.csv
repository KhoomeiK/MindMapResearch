dogs,ff6jzv7,t1_ff61vgd,1579628831.0,This works like a charm. It doesn't last forever but every few weeks I spray my microfiber couch and it solves this problem. Hasn't seemed to hurt the couch at all.
dogs,ff5ag6s,t3_erpn7i,1579585191.0,Some kind of bully mix. Her weight looks great! She looks very fit.

dogs,feea7uf,t1_fedlwbu,1579029592.0,">Goldens tend to be more outgoing and boisterous than poodles and will be hams in every context. The poodles I’ve met and worked with are a bit more reserved with strangers and really open up their goofy/ silly side at home with their humans.

Yeah, I agree with this. My girl is a total goof and it shines at home and with people she has gotten to know. Doesn't take a lot for her to open up with new people, and she's not shy, but if you just meet her on the street and want to pet her she's going to come off as reserved while she decides if you're cool. She's a loving goof with anyone who ever sees her on a regular basis, and humans with dogs get into her circle much more easily, lol.

Totally."

dogs,fbnmmn0,t3_edqgjf,1577000102.0,"I would get the same breed, color, and sex from the same breeder. But they wouldn't look identical to me even if they did to someone else less observant or less familiar with the breed. I enjoy watching dogs develop their individual personalities so I'm not particularly worried about projecting. I have no interest in a literal clone.

I figure I picked my dog for reasons that will still be valid when I get another dog and I'm not going to go with something different just for its own sake. I wouldn't be getting that dog for the purpose of looking as similar as possible."
