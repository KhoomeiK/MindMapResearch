Every single presidential administration of probably, the last 6 has slowly been causing a chain reaction of toppling governments. Each administration has inherited a Middle East more volatile and unstable than the last. Each president has inadvertently made the same mistakes over and over. We do not have any reason to be in the Middle East other than to promote our version of stability that does not possibly mesh with the controlled chaos of the Middle East our current goal seems to be on par of the containment policies of the Cold War. We see the same human rights violations in China and we do nothing. The terror organizations of that region are truly the one reason we could use for being there but we don’t use that reasoning. There is not a reason , other than terror, that we should be there but even our policies on those organizations are as bumbling and ineffective as all of our policies on Iran."
