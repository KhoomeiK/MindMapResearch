They suffered tremendously and despite that, kept giving to everyone. Never stopped. Most selfless person I've ever met. They believed in themselves because others believed in them. We support you. 

I know it's hard. I have a mental illness diagnosis as well. I can tell from your photo you have a lot of hurt, but I bet you have a lot to give. You have caring eyes.

You aren't ugly. At all.

You are not your diagnosis. You are *you*. Remember that.
