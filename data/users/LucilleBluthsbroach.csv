exjw,fgus3p2,t3_f0i94w,1581128152.0,"I moved to a new area of the country. Having been roundly ignored by all of the congregations I've been in ever since I became disabled and could no longer attend meetings, (8 of them) having to listen on the phone, I called the hall in my new area. I told my situation, and asked for a visit and a bible, as I'd given mine to a non JW who wanted one. They came, no bible though, but they said they would come back with the bible. They didn't. It's been a year and a half and I've never heard from them again. That was the last straw. I have a long history of much worse mistreatment by both elders and the rank and file.  I move quite a bit, but some of the 8 congregations in question I'd been at for quite a while so they had plenty of time to get to know me if they weren't ignoring me.

A lot of things were instrumental in waking me up, but this really was the last straw."
femalefashionadvice,fguqoqf,t3_f0ifon,1581127215.0,"A Prada spazzolatto logo frame bag like the one Miranda Priestley wore in her first scene in the devil wears Prada. It's marbled caramel color, with such a big logo on the front (which I usually don't like) and the leather is like butter.
I feel a bit embarrassed about the logo, and while the quality is phenomenal, I'm so afraid of damaging the buttery satiny leather when I use it. But I do feel like a million bucks when I wear it."

So would everyone I know."
