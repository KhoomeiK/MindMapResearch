PublicFreakout,fec2bzt,t1_fe6htag,1578965633.0,"I totally get where you’re coming from, when enraged, we may say things we don’t agree with at all, just to hurt the other person. 

“If a bully was fat, I’d say something about that to hurt their feelings”  Sure! That’s a physical trait that is not desirable, and “insultable”. I’m just having trouble equating it to THIS situation, because being black is not “insultable”. Sure..the N word is an insult tied to a physical characteristic, but it’s tied to a physical characteristic that is NOT a hindrance or flaw, such as obesity. So that’s the disparity I wanted to shed light on."

PublicFreakout,fe9bq3x,t1_fe6jx6f,1578936121.0,"No what I’m being picky about is that obesity is undesirable, being black should not be. It should not be an insult. Can’t believe I got downvoted for that, maybe people just misunderstood what I was saying."

If you hadn’t explained that the line is continuous it’s still very cool, but interesting to think about how a simple explanation of process can enhance a piece...the same goes for music “we used a tape machine to loop this audio but and to make this cool sound” or “this song was made all with sounds from a washing machine”. The piece should be able to stand alone and move people beyond just the “wow” factor of the process, (or I guess it’s just “head music”) but having a cool backstory can really give a better understanding of whats being conveyed.
