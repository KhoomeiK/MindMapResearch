facepalm,fdhjfi4,t3_elchqg,1578423925.0,I mean... I saw a post on a chronic pain forum about micro-dosing psychedelic shrooms for pain. Maybe illegal substances are the new essential oils?

Sims4,fdels7x,t3_ekwl54,1578341725.0,He showed up at one of my houses and stayed for five days straight. (Not part of the welcome wagon.) When the welcome wagon came he sat at the computer and refused to be nice to anyone and including him in conversation made him angry. My sim talked to the neighbors which made him angry and the neighbors all had little thought bubbles with his face crossed out. Only playing chess in silence can appease him.

Fibromyalgia,fd67ncr,t3_ek2o43,1578186719.0,"My ankles or something in my foot pops with every step I take. Not always super loud, just a soft clicking."
Fibromyalgia,fcthrm4,t1_fcscdml,1577943706.0,"I have a cyst in my brain and half the medical community is certain that cysts in this location are not symptomatic and nothing needs done and the other half is certain that it causes problems with circadian rhythm, migraines etc. and removal is a good idea. I have all the symptoms that they say are common but the only place to get proper imaging done is by people who are on the side that the cyst is not causing any symptoms. Like okay bud. Live a day in my body and then say that."
facepalm,fcoejjq,t3_ei3vms,1577830315.0,"Here's the thing: in retrospect, the fear of new millennium seems like absolute paranoia and hogwash because we know more about technology now and (I assume) have programmed technology to handle the issues like  digits represented in dates that caused most of the concern. Back then, this was such a big concern for tech companies and businesses that many were working nonstop to find solutions and monitor equipment in case of failure with the new millennium. My dad was working in computer security then and was working overtime the whole holiday season to try to prevent the company's programs from breaking. I remember spending New Year's Eve in the office that night with the vaguest idea of why we were there, but my dad was on call to make sure things transitioned okay.  Many people throughout the tech field were probably in the same position. People put a lot of work into it and gave up a lot of family time to make sure what they thought to be a very real threat played out smoothly."

I don't think they even knew what that meant other than their parents probably equating it to bad because the district is full of stuck up, wealthy conservatives. Jokes on them--I'm really bi/pan."
Fibromyalgia,fccg83l,t3_egsejy,1577598032.0,"Dang. I'm only in my 20s and have felt this way more times than I have fingers. I feel like mental health professionals need to be more aware of the toll that chronic illness and pain takes on people. Frankly that's why I turned to Reddit forums. People actually understand and can offer advice here.  
If you haven't had an MRI recently it may be worth looking into. There are several ""benign"" masses that can still have dramatic effects on brain function like circadian rhythm. I had similar symptoms and ended up having a large pineal cyst. (Still no treatment because the only doctors who will operate are out of state, but they DO exist.) 
I really hope that things turn around for you."
Fibromyalgia,fccb90c,t3_egqsfb,1577596434.0,"If there's a specific post that's a problem then say something on that post, but nothing is wrong with someone sharing their success with a medicine or treatment method. As someone who has yet to find a knowledgeable doctor,  I like to compare stories of people actually living and experiencing the treatment to the known studies out there so I have a  better idea of  what  to  discuss with my doctor. If not for these posts I would have resigned myself to solely taking painkillers and not seeking out more preventive methods of  pain relief like lifestyle changes and trying different antidepressants."
