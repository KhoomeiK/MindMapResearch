antiwork,ffg22jt,t3_esw471,1579896777.0,"As someone who transitioned from technical to management, your raw skills will matter less and less the higher up you go. Knowing enough to remain relevant in a conversation is what you'll need, whereas your ability to coordinate a team and have them driving towards the same goal is what will carry you to success.

It's very much intangible compare to pounding out measurable metrics. Managing people is much more difficult than dealing with technology, but that's why there's an increase in compensation.

Given your post, I would recommend you work on leadership and coaching skills. Know when to step in and offer advice or guidance, and when to step back and let someone figure it out. This will vary from person to person because some people have the confidence and ability to figure it out for themselves (and many, in fact, despise the correction). 

Your boss brings up a good point though - are you going to be happy in management? There are a lot of times that you will be directly responsible for a failure because your team wasn't able to deliver on something, and there will be nothing you can personally do about it since you won't be the one delivering. You are the interface between your team (the workers) and the company (upper management typically). You exist to make sure that your guys can keep working unimpeded, even when everything else is conspiring against them.

So you really have to ask yourself, do you want to be the one doing, or the one enabling the doers?"

It took me a while, where I would wear hats to cover up despite knowing that nobody really cared that much. Only after a year or two like that did I finally come to terms that my balding was inevitable, and that hiding it under a hat was not a solution. In fact, it reflected poorly on my self-confidence.

In the same way that a lot of women are made to feel self-conscious about their appearance, there are many subtle and not-so-subtle ways that men get the same treatment. Balding, in my experience, is one of those things. It was especially apparent when I was single and dating - lots of women found balding to be a deal breaker. Not all, of course.

I feel like there's a breakdown of language there. I can imagine a cube pretty easily and manipulate it mentally, but at no point do I ""see"" it.

I think that I have a pretty vivid imagination, but never do I really visualize anything.

For example, if I imagined an iceberg, my imagination ""loads up"" the concept of an iceberg floating sort of in the distance, but the ""image"" is pretty much nondescript until I mentally focus on any one aspect of it. So like, if I think what colour is the ice? Then the ice will take on a colour. Is it floating in an ocean? Once I bring my attention to these other factors, my mind then fills it in, since it becomes required for the complete scene.

gamingsuggestions,fep3u14,t3_epvi8a,1579311523.0,"I'm in a very similar boat and I have yet to find anything that perfectly scratches that itch. There are a few games that I've found appealing that come close to certain aspects of raiding...


* **Battlerite** is an arena PVP game, however it takes the MMO archetypes and pits them against each other. While you don't figure out a fight, there is the cooperation aspect between your teammates and plenty of ability dodging. Check out some YT videos for an idea.

* **FORCED** is a hack and slash action RPG at its core, but built around a campaign. It has a ""endless"" mode that is pretty satisfying to figure out. Each class has skills/abilities that are unlocked via the campaign and features a fair bit of customizability. The appeal I found here was figuring out the right build to progress deeper into the endless mode. The interplay during the campaigns has moments similar to raid-bosses - I'd recommend checking this one out, especially on sale.

* **Gauntlet** is pretty similar to **FORCED**. Plenty of fun moments that felt similar to a raid, but there's a bit less teamwork involved. As long as everyone frags hard, it's fairly straightforward.

I think the hardest part is to deconstruct what aspects of raiding you enjoyed the most, and looking for those types of games. For me, I think it boils down to 3 major factors (in no particular order):

1. Cooperation with a team of people
2. Discovering/mastering a fight's mechanics
3. Making full (and optimal) use of the toolset I have on hand to accomplish the fight

The games above provide you with a basic toolset and throw you into situations that you must use them to defeat it. You have the choice of coop, and so ticks off 1, and by and large there's some learning involved in level mechanics, so also ticks off 2.

Hopefully this can help point you in the right direction."

Games,fep0ebg,t1_feozzy2,1579309339.0,"I had a difficult time with that until I reframed the game movement in my mind.

I use the directional attacks, and I consider the mouse movement to be the ""wind up"" for the attack. Basically, to attack left to right, I would move my mouse left, as if winding up to swing. Once I started thinking like that, everything starting making more sense for me.

Alternatively, I've met players that need to frame it in the inverse way, where they use the mouse movement to indicate the direction of attack. (The setting toggles either way). So if I wanted to swing left to right, I would move my mouse right as I clicked, to indicate where the weapon should swing.

If you still own it, try toggling to the opposite method and see if it works better for your brain.

Also, as for being dumped into the deep end... look for 1v1 duel servers. There are a lot of very friendly people that will show you the ropes. You'll also get destroyed a lot, but it's great to be able to see first hand how a good player picks you apart in 1v1, rather than die in the middle of a 5 man melee."
