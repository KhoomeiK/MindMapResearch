I already have a zz plant and a golden pothos, so I'm kinda familiar with the 'abandon-me-and-i'll-have-a-good-time' regime. Was just convinced dracaena wasn't one of dudes :\`)"
plantclinic,ff3re8q,t1_ff349ea,1579547216.0,"It's good to know that leaf drop is normal to some extent:) Currently, the soil is kinda dry? (4 cm / 1.5 in from the top). My apartment is pretty dry indeed, might need a humidifier. 

Is it best to water on a schedule or by checking the soil?

Thank you so much!"
plantclinic,ff3qbf3,t1_ff344wh,1579546556.0,"The soil was very dry when I just got it. I watered it almost immediately - it dried - I watered again. (Maybe it just didn't dry entirely? idk). So no, I wouldn't say it's been consistently wet.  Sunlight = indirect. Can't say much about the soil.. It says ""universal"" on the package, 5.5 - 6.5 acidity pH. Has coconut coir in it. The planter has drainage holes + pebbles on the bottom.  

And I gotta admit, I had no idea that misting could contribute to overwatering! A lot of articles I've seen about dracaenas say that they like to be misted. The garden section salesperson really encouraged me to keep it moist as well. And here I am, overwatering my plant. 

Thank you so much for your answer!"

thanks!"

re leaves: no idea! i‚Äôm a non-native eng speaker, so any plant part that vaguely resembles a leaf is a leaf to me lol"

will keep the plant as it is for now. hopefully it‚Äôll get better with the grow light, if not - will do the cutting thing. thanks again:)"

i‚Äôve checked the plant for insects - there aren‚Äôt any. could that be mold or mayhaps some mineral deposits (i‚Äôm just guessing)? should i isolate it from other plants for now?"

GenderCritical,fdxmxw9,t1_fdvw8dd,1578770777.0,"maybe politics was not the right word to use, as on the governmental level ukraine is still very much a good old post-soviet homophobic country.
personally, however, i‚Äôve been having a lot of encounters with pro-queer/trans narratives. for example: i‚Äôve been looking very hard for a gay-friendly psychotherapist. found one - came out to her - she puts transgender-themed brochures all around her office to show ‚Äúsupport‚Äù. then debates my gc views for some reason. 

more and more ppl identifying as non-binary or agender or queer or whatever without ever being able to explain themselves. 

the largest ukrainian lgbt ngo (who are now an lgbtqi+ ngo, excuse me) organized a trans pride - separate from a usual pride held in summer. 

so it‚Äôs kinda minor stuff for now but i feel like The Inevitable will happen soon"
GenderCritical,fdvwl4e,t1_fdvv5n3,1578752489.0,"fun story: last summer i got cancelled on twitter for being an undercover terf. lost a lot of followers, but not the point. the point is that dozens of russian-speaking mutuals of mine got cancelled as well due to being connected to me, a known terf. and then i had TRAs coming to my dms to ~interview me about the oh-so-scary russian terfs. wild, huh

bipolar,fd92hf6,t3_ekbl1l,1578227396.0,"I‚Äôm both on lithium and quetiapine - been on the latter for about 10 months. I‚Äôd say quetiapine definitely affects my sleep far more than lithium (which I doubt has any effect on sleep whatsoever). 

I‚Äôm taking 100mg quetiapine now, but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm super satisfied with it. 100mg gives me nasty restless leg syndrome, stuffy nose, tachycardia, I sleep more than I want/usually need to YET it‚Äôs still hard to fall asleep. 150mg makes it all worse, 75mg is not enough to even fall asleepüôÉ"
bipolar,fd8gyr2,t3_ek6vct,1578218263.0,"Not that I can relate in exact same way, but I also experience something vaguely similar while hypomanic. I‚Äôm a lesbian, so men don‚Äôt interest me neither sexually nor romantically. However when I hit extra spicy hypomanic highs, I gradually start enjoying/wanting attention from them. I want male admiration, I don‚Äôt mind them flirting or making comments I otherwise would oppose. Ironically these experiences have nothing to do with my desire or attraction - I still don‚Äôt find men attractive and I wouldn‚Äôt reciprocate anyone‚Äôs advances. I guess I just want as many people as possible to be attracted to me when I‚Äôm hypomanic, so that‚Äôs that. Loving a good ego tripü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Also recently I‚Äôve seen a very, well, confusing case of a TIF being a drag queen. Didn‚Äôt refer to herself as a bio queen, no. Let that sink in: a TIF is dressing up and painting herself as hyper-feminized caricature of a woman - and that is some sort of a woke activism / self-expression. Then, in her regular daily life she puts on ‚Äòmale‚Äô makeup (contours and all) and ‚Äòpresents male‚Äô - and that is her authentic self apparently. Why even transition if you‚Äôre gonna spend half of your time being a ~drag queen? Dysphoria who? I just cannot comprehend any of that."

offmychest,fcufcgb,t3_eit90m,1577979600.0,"Thank you so much for sharing this. I hope you find strength to heal from the trauma you‚Äôve experienced. 

When I was a teen I used to experience pretty intense gender dysphoria. Changed my pronouns, was obsessed with an idea of getting a hysterectomy, just downright hated my body. My whole dysphoria thing happened in mid 00s, so kinda before I had any access to information about trans issues. And tbh I‚Äôm glad I never got to join any kind of a transgender community online, because who knows where it would led a fragile teen like myself. 
Long story short, turned out I just couldn‚Äôt accept my homosexuality and the idea of two females having a fulfilling relationship of any sort. Not that I‚Äôm done dealing with my internalized homophobia, but at least I‚Äôm glad I figured out who I was."
Shoestring,fcrpd5l,t1_fcrfbvq,1577904827.0,"sure. keep in mind that the prices i‚Äôm about to give are relevant to kyiv, the capital. other big cities like lviv, kharkiv and odessa would be even lower (at least 10% i feel).

so the food. i spend roughly about 35 USD on groceries a week. i cook all of my meals at home and don‚Äôt have any dietary restrictions. i believe you could go lower than 35 bucks with a vegetarian/vegan diet. 
if you prefer eating out - you can find decent (albeit modest) options starting at 5 USD per meal. a nice meal at a good chinese place would be ~15 USD. 
street food is obviously even cheaper. a plenty of take outs & deliveries here. 

accommodation: if you‚Äôre looking for a studio apartment, central kyiv starts at roughly 450 USD per month. anything higher than 600 USD would be unreasonable for a studio apt. 
if you don‚Äôt mind a 30-60 min ride from the center, 400 USD or even lower might do the job. public transport is bearable, but not definitely not great. some would call it an interesting cultural experience :^)

other stuff like utilities, wifi, phone bills, medical expenses and entertainment of whatever kind you prefer would vary of course."
Shoestring,fcqvnaq,t3_eihsa1,1577892896.0,"op do you consider eastern europe? dirt cheap compared to germany. budget wise would be very doable for a digital nomad imo (i don‚Äôt know what exactly you‚Äôre doing, but nonetheless). 

i currently live in ukraine, the capital and some other major cities are kinda nice. idk what exactly you‚Äôre interested in, but you might wanna look into eastern europe if cost of living is your biggest concern."

is there a way to tell auditory hallucinations and actual sounds apart?"
bipolar,fc6i6e1,t3_egg19v,1577481156.0,"I was on Lamictal ~5 years ago, so don‚Äôt remember the exact dosage. The only thing I remember though is that it left me with a nasty hypomanic episode, suicidal and eventually hospitalized. 
I don‚Äôt think this is a common reaction. I was taking clomipramine back then as well, so maybe the combination didn‚Äôt work out, idk. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt even Lamictal that triggered the episode. Anyway, not trying to spook youüòÖ

bipolar,f8fgriy,t3_e0npqj,1574543399.0,"hey there! i can relate. several years ago i was in a long-term committed relationship. things were going alright, but i wasn‚Äôt diagnosed yet and the whole ‚Äúare you ill or are you an asshole‚Äù question was taking a toll on our relationship. 

although undiagnosed, i remember having hypomanic episodes vividly. during every single one i would get hypersexual and i would try to cheat on my partner. craved the attention from other ppl and was convinced i was fully deserving of it, too. i did flirt with some ppl, but didn‚Äôt take it any further. 

have you spoken to your fianc√© about the cheating thing?"
