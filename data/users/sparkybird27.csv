relationship_advice,ffypsl3,t1_ffyij1c,1580352183.0,I can see your point. But.. idk.. needing to know is highly important. I wouldn’t marry my wife until I KNEW that one ex wasn’t a temptation. You have to be sure someone is worthy of your honesty and love. Can’t waste time with people these days
relationship_advice,ffyif7d,t3_evx1pc,1580347174.0,Catfish her. Create a fake email and use that to creat a fake Facebook or whatever.. get an app with a different number. Or! Just realize the fact that she is hiding it and texting other men means.. she isn’t loyal.. or won’t be for long.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffxyios,t3_evt1hu,1580334931.0,"For those who would like to know, I mention how it was sad that two men where let off on a robbery charge because they had the witness killed and I got this racist response."
GenderCynical,ffx8tdv,t1_ffx5hfu,1580320146.0,"Dysphoria, while it made cause distress.. is not the argument. I’m speaking of being transsexual.. not having gender dysphoria. They may go well together but are not the same thing. Although paying taxes causes me dysphoria I still have to do it and not misrepresent those said taxes."
GenderCynical,ffx49qm,t1_ffwzb9w,1580317430.0,"Yes.. solely because you are not sure if it’s a thing.. doesn’t mean that’s facts. Research is at our finger tips people.

GenderCynical,ffx3o9x,t1_ffx360q,1580317068.0,"I don’t fit into the box you are trying to put me in. Strawmanning is a clear sign you are not making a clear argument. 

A cherry pick is yes.. my three points.. from the article that you cherry picked the last paragraph from. In such quick time that there is no way you read all of it and absorbed the information. 

Anti vaccine and flat earth conspiracies are not what this conversation is about, please google what a strawman argument is. It will show you that you are adverting.

Science is experimental and ever changing."
GenderCynical,ffx3d34,t1_ffx2w8c,1580316881.0,I understand. By impersonation I am referring to a sex change or representation of the opposite sex they were born.
GenderCynical,ffx2ovx,t1_ffx1y2n,1580316469.0,A solid point I’d like to make.. I am not approaching trans people to tell them they aren’t who they think they are. It is the trans community who does not think they are who they are.
GenderCynical,ffx2jmf,t1_ffx1y2n,1580316377.0,"I feel you are wrong and inaccurate. I am not concerned with you “sparring someone’s feelings” it’s having a good moral character to engage in discussions with people who are of a different mind than you. To assume I am a bigot is a want to shut someone down because you aren’t liking the statements they make. It has left me with no choice but to consider your arguments invalid and overly emotional.. therefore, skewed. Unfortunately, I will not engage in conversation with someone who resorts to immature tactics to “win” a discussion."

My point being that science is not sure! There are few facts. Picking out a certain part of the article is strawmanning. It also mentions that hormone treatment is affecting the accuracy that of these studies."
GenderCynical,ffx1fl7,t1_ffwzb9w,1580315693.0,"I feel that you get the impression that you are talking to a guy because of the things you see. Are you getting this impression from a trans male that is in appearance, a woman? Or do you think that it may be because of what your visuals are telling you. The impersonation of a man. 

Sad that I have to say this.. but these are genuine questions, it’s not to “argue” with you, it’s just an “in response” to your statement."
GenderCynical,ffx12v0,t1_ffwzelp,1580315476.0,"I also would like to request respect. You can still have a discussion without ridiculing or attempting to one up one another. I find that the only way to change someone’s mind is to show understanding for their view and express your own, it’s up to them if they reflect on what you have said and feel differ to from that conversation. But being a jerk gets walls thrown up and doesn’t leave you a chance to even express your true point on the matter."

I found this article quite interesting. It shows that the science is very uncertain and still learning about this condition."
GenderCynical,ffwyy3y,t1_ffwy93t,1580314146.0,"No identity is “the fact of being who or what a person or thing is.”

Not what a person wants.. the FACT of what IS."
GenderCynical,ffwyl9y,t1_ffwxx1b,1580313923.0,"I wasn’t asking if being a tomboy made me trans... hah

My point is, the treatment for this medical condition that is gender dysphoria, should be treated as such. 

As you would expect racial dysphoria wouldn’t be solve by providing someone with the ability to change their skin tone and eye shape or anything that would be that of the sort. For instance... if I painted my face black because I identified at a black person.. that’s not acceptable and is racist. Wouldn’t you find it insulting to a born male or woman that someone of the opposite sex is impersonating their sex?"

relationship_advice,ffrv0vn,t3_euw55i,1580166460.0,"Let him get evicted. Use what money you have to plan accordingly. Change your number and block his accounts. Tell everyone you want what happened so you can find support to prevent him manipulating you back into this relationship. It’s gonna hurt, you will cry a lot. Just do it and be strong. Or.. it will be in front of your children in the years to come.. or maybe.. he will yell and hit your children too. Prevent all of that by having self respect."

relationship_advice,ffrnshr,t3_euv169,1580161888.0,"Any woman who is a bitch about that is obviously doesn’t take it as it should be... a big ass compliment. I am a woman and I’ve always been confused about that.. so if he takes too long you complain that you aren’t tight enough or he doesn’t find you sexy... but if he cums super fast it’s his fault and he is a weak man.. pfttt.. don’t be embarrassed. If she isnt cool about it and understanding than she should probably read and learn about that because she isn’t aware of the facts. You should stop some more and read about some ways you can last longer, but don’t hate on yourself because you came fast... that’s normal af"
relationship_advice,ffrnidy,t1_ffrlqe3,1580161719.0,"If you are a reader I suggest browsing the self help section of a good book store and reading some. We all are a bit insecure, but I’ll let you in on a little secret. Every single person is faking it until they make it. Some are born with the perfect genes and never know the feeling but even then they question if they are funny or liked. I used to be too intimated to speak in a room full of people.. not anymore because I realized we are all doing the same thing.. judging ourselves harsher than other."
