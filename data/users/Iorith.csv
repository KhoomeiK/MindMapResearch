facepalm,ff2c9g4,t1_ff2ap49,1579500441.0,Is it so awful to you to simply treat others how they wish to be treated?  I mean this sincerely.  Is the idea of simply using different words to make someone happy so alien to you to be unacceptable?  It takes so little effort.  That you're so opposed to it speaks volumes of your character to me.

Also, one of the largest things you learn in any major science course is the idea of disproving things.  That's why most scientific concepts are called theories, not facts.  Because they are true until they can be disproven by a better theory.  You prove it by showing that it cant be disproven."
