'Today Mr Finch smeared his shit all over his bedroom 5 minutes before my shift was up,' I say at the dinner table with a grimace. The only person interested is our friend who is a vet. She launches into a magical discussion about cat scrotums. Everyone else at the table has stopped eating, they even look a bit sick... The vet and I, the nurse, continue discussing how how raw meat can make you hungry... What raw meat are we talking about? 

My partner puts her utensils down. 'Karol. This is not dinner talk,' she says, looking at me with an expression that I've leaned means 'not now, we're eating'. 

Another person at the table coughs. 'So, how about that demon heart you put in a jar during the last session? Seems fishy right.' I don't realise until later that everyone, bar the vet, is praying we'll start talking about DnD and not veer off into how necromancy is basically medicine. Tonight we do not."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fel97m8,t1_feke2ew,1579216811.0,"She was a Just Yes before this, which is why I suspect it's her reaction to impending death. The dying process can also make people very erratic. Also, she's likely on a whole cocktail of cancer meds (plus her indulgences) which can and do cause delirium. Delirium is not nice for anyone: someone who is perfectly kind and loving can become a monster under delirium's sway."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fejichf,t3_epbhfl,1579175547.0,"Can I just ask... has this behaviour only started since the diagnosis and sudden change in life expectancy? If it has, this is your mother's response to the fact she is dying. She is terrified and not in her right mind. Doesn't excuse her behaviour but gives you some insight.

Also, as she gets closer and closer to passing this aggression might get worse. At that point I want you to understand that it is not your mother at that point because she is not in control anymore. It can be very frightening to deal with and I'm sorry you are potentially going through it."
AmItheAsshole,fdpnb49,t3_emch4u,1578633564.0,The one and only circumstance in which you could be the TA is if you were the baby's mum. And then I'd be worried you were suffering from post-natal mental illness.
AmItheAsshole,fdfk76h,t1_fdfjtxh,1578363625.0,"You've got to find someone who believes you. It's hard and you might go through several in the process but if they're worth their salt they'll try.

Step dad had a brain tumor in 2018... and then the cancer scare last year... I feel the same way. All this money and personal stress is taking a toll on her and I just want her to be happy."
AmItheAsshole,fdfisr0,t1_fdfhpvb,1578362689.0,"No, not rude at all.

I felt guilty about it for a very long time but I've been going to therapy for almost 20 years and it's helped me see that I don't have to love him or even like him. Just because he's good for my mum doesn't mean he's good for me. Because of him I tried to kill myself and got kicked out of home, because of him I was furious with my mother for a very long time. 

If he dies all I will feel is relief. This was brought into stark relief last year when he had a bowel cancer scare (he's got Crohns disease) and all I felt at his potential passing was relief. I was even ready to forgive him and move on - I'm a nurse and I offered to go home to look after him - but it turns out it's just undiagnosed Crohns so he can fuck himself. If it kills him because he's a stubborn asshole then it kills him, my mother has tried to get through to him and the few times I've talked to him about it he's not really seemed to care.

I have the benefit of 10 years (I'm 33) of experience and therapy that you don't. You did the right thing moving out when you did. If he has to be at the wedding then he is there as a courtesy to your mother, he is, in essence, her plus one. 

This man did not raise you. He intruded at your mother's invitation. Too often parents forget that their children have their own opinions. Blended families, btw, are bullshit too. More often than not the kids from each side can't stand each other or the step parent but we have this fantasy idea of Brady Bunch households."
AmItheAsshole,fdfd1vp,t1_fdfckwd,1578358833.0,"My step dad seems to be less of a general asshole than yours. His abuse was focused entirely on trying to control me and because it was so focused most people didn't see it, even when it was right in front of their faces. 

I honestly don't care about my mother's relationship with him beyond courtesy and genuine interest in her life. He could die tomorrow and while it might be hard for the grief it would cause my mum I'd honestly only feel relief. He is a nuisance that has destroyed my ability to trust men and so I say good riddance.

They made me read a fucking poem about connection at their wedding ceremony. The only saving grace was they made his daughter do it too and she can't stand my mum."
tifu,fdf8qg2,t3_ekuxcs,1578355926.0,Your mum is being silly. You're concussed of course you're going to make ridiculous decisions because you're not in full control.
AmItheAsshole,fdf4qha,t1_fdezrf3,1578353269.0,"From personal experience it's possible to be very close with the bio parent and distanced from the step parent. I detest my step father for similar reasons to OP but I have a wonderful relationship with me mother. I don't talk to my step dad unless he is present (I live on the opposite end of the continent to them) or he has answered the phone.

If he wanted a better relationship he could reach out but he won't and I can't stand him. I tried in my teen years to like him because everyone went around saying how much I should love him due to how happy he made my mother. He never made ME happy or even attempted to try so fuck him.

OP, you don't have to let him down the aisle. You don't have to give him a seat at the wedding party table. He's not your father, he's an interloper who moved in and did what too many men do; it's my house now and you'll live it or suffer. 

Your mother, who I believe loves him very much, is blinded by her emotions. But you, her daughter, deserve to come first. You always did and I'm sorry she forgot that in favor of her dickhead."
