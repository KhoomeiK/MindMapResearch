depression,fekvi9j,t3_epiyby,1579208457.0,I do this quite a lot. The feeling of escaping reality and imagining a world with people you've created is so liberating especially when one's own life is bad. It's a coping mechanism that I've come to appreciate
SuicideWatch,fe93109,t3_eo0v3v,1578933684.0,"I would like to vanish... If there were ever a moment to just disappear from people's minds as if I had never existed, I'd jump at the chance..."
depression,fdrmstg,t3_emrpqy,1578686761.0,"Happy Birthday to you, friend! Best wishes!"
depression,fdkf2e9,t3_elqwy9,1578502509.0,"A lot of it is repressed emotions that I can't express, having little to no voice or control over my own life, told to be something I'm not, not having a great support system from family, and some other things. There's a lot of factors that contributes to my depression's growth. Most of it stems from family and social upbringing, then you add having anxiety and the constant fear of not being good enough... A lot of intricate factors as to why."
infj,fdiudvr,t3_eljq3v,1578451250.0,"In my case, I write for a number of reasons whether it’s to get things off of my chest or I do it for recreational purposes. 

I mostly write poems (90% of them are dark while the remaining 10% is light-hearted.) or if I have the dedication, I write a chapter for some idea for a book I have.  Writing comes easily to me because it’s the only way I can get my complete thoughts down. The perfection part comes in the forms of choosing the write words or style whether that’s more heartfelt or a “robotic” way of writing things. 

I honestly like writing in my journal because it’s the one place where I can truly speak and let my emotions out without having to face judgment from other people. I guess you could say it’s therapeutic in a way."
depression,fccntnj,t3_egz4nv,1577600549.0,"Yes, it feels like I’ve tricked people into believing something about myself that isn’t true."

AskReddit,f7yas62,t3_dxyc96,1574090886.0,"I think about this a lot. From simple to complex things, I bash myself on the daily about social missteps. It's like the more I try to catch myself, the more often they appear. I randomly remember conversations where I was a bit harsh with my words with a smile on my face. Even when I look back at texts, my end was strongly worded, trying to iron out all my thoughts and feelings towards an issue out. I look back at those and they haunt me so bad."
