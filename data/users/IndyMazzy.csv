But I don’t think it lost anything in Dolby. While the expanded ratio gave me more to look at, the story is more of a dramatic one punctuated with amazing cinematography. If you’re really dying to see it now I would jump on it in Dolby. Who knows if it will be available to watch in any premium format for you if you keep waiting."

pelotoncycle,feguve2,t3_ep3jb3,1579103058.0,"As far as Apple Watch integration. I choose not to wear mine during rides as the watch can’t broadcast my heart rate directly to the bike. This feature isn’t likely as the tablet is an Android device. No big deal. I use a stand-alone heart rate monitor that can transmit to the bike. Your account CAN link to your Apple health account to fill your rings and record complete metrics on your ride (distance, constant heart rate, etc). While I would love to just use my watch the alternate method works just as well. There is an app (BlueHeart) that can allow you to use your watch to send your heart rate to the bike. But it has to use your phone where you start another workout which results in duplicate workouts in Apple Health. Not worth it IMO."

pelotoncycle,febwpek,t1_feb1cm7,1578963589.0,"As far as whether you can get a good workout, the answer is yes. Most of the instructors encourage you to modify as needed. So if they’re calling a resistance level that seems too low I usually kick it up 10-20 resistance and focus on on matching the cadence that they’re calling. You’ll get the full in studio level workout on a Peloton."
