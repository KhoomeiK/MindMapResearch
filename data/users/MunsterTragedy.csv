What I was attempting to convey is that it is impossible to quantify the true ROI of TARP since it averted a global depression which would have wiped out trillions of dollars of potential output and asset values. And not only didn't it cost taxpayers anything, it actually made the government a profit of over $100 billion, so the true ROI is infinitesimally higher than your  alleged 7%.

MurderedByWords,ffb9ud7,t3_esnsbc,1579756589.0,"I understand the sentiment but this is disingenuous.
