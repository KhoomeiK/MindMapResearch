Either way though if you are making the game try both pick the one that's more fun."

IndieGaming,ffah4cv,t3_esargx,1579735609.0,"Hey I saw this so I bought your game on switch. A few things I noticed. 
The loading screen animation in the corner seems to lag with load and with the load time makes me think the game is frozen because it's a still picture. 
Load levels is pretty long which isn't a huge issue but when I went to Goldenwoods and am locked out it's 30second+ load time just to see that I can't go farther than a screen and then another 30second load back. Finally I just noticed that your sword animation happens on top of ledges and looks a little funny to me that one is a little more personal opinion.
I like the game so far just figured I'd mention those things cause the rest of the game seems very polished and well done they stuck out."
engineering,ffaeiqz,t1_ffac68s,1579733780.0,That seems like a lot of different things. What's your goal here to get a job as an EE or to make video games? I would figure that out and try to get a job in that field.
engineering,ff9v2vv,t1_ff9r7x2,1579722107.0,I don't think masters is worth it if you want to do programming. That's what I did.
engineering,ff9i8xj,t3_esdwpu,1579713584.0,No one leaving school is good in the field. You learn a lot of things as you go. Also interns do next to nothing of the complex stuff by themselves. No one is expecting you to be an allstar day 1. It takes years to become a top performer. Also I think at my company no one expects you to perform a positive workload for a few months as a full time employee.

3Dmodeling,fdeodll,t1_fdelwv4,1578343257.0,Blender has a full game engine essentially.
arduino,fdedy8q,t1_fdedmpa,1578336928.0,Oof. Tell me where so I don't buy it from there
videos,fcxoh06,t1_fcxmm0e,1578067768.0,Let's talk about reading things the way you want to hear it.....
dogswithjobs,fcv5rk1,t1_fcv1jd4,1577995217.0,"Invented is a little strong, but you might not be flying anymore then so you won't have to worry about it."
dogswithjobs,fcuzdfp,t1_fcuydo3,1577991537.0,"Actually there are options for people with allergies to overcome them by being introduced to very small amounts of the allergen. I agree with you that having a respiratory issue is worse, but that doesn't mean dogs should be banned. Maybe airlines just need to take the extra step and let people know there will be a dog on the flight or that there cannot be. Whomever bought their ticket first."
dogswithjobs,fcuwva5,t1_fcu49cb,1577990149.0,"Couldn't they bring their own scuba gear? Or a private jet?
But seriously if you have that kind of respiratory issues I feel like the plane is not your issue. 
Are drug sniffing dogs at the airport ok? What about people walking their dogs in the city? I'm just confused at how this only applies to airplanes."
dogswithjobs,fcuwhgw,t1_fcuo9ju,1577989940.0,Mental health isn't talk to someone and it's fixed. The dog helps now the talking helps later.
dogswithjobs,fcuwep9,t1_fctynh7,1577989897.0,"I don't think anyone is unable to fly without it, but I will say that some will have panic attacks and be much worse off. I feel like of it's something as simple as having a dog next to you it's more selfish of you not to allow them. Most people don't have a deathly allergy to dogs. 
Why am I selfish for wanting to eat peanuts on a plane when people are allergic to that?"
dogswithjobs,fcuw2jw,t1_fcu1p6j,1577989706.0,"I feel like you need to take your own argument then. If someone is going to have a panic attack on the plane or something similar then that does seem as bad as an allergic reaction. Also it's not a sugar pill it's a treatment that works for some people. I'm not saying everyone that brings their pet on a flight is one of those people but it does help some. 
By your same logic we should not be allowing peanut butter and jelly in schools. Maybe even people that own dogs and cats should need to buy new clothes at the airport so the dander is gone."
dogswithjobs,fcuvm2n,t1_fcumxg9,1577989455.0,What do they do after the plane ride?
powerwashingporn,fcrcyaq,t1_fcrcoj2,1577900152.0,It doesn't really hurt the environment because there are tree farms. Unless you are going outside and cutting down a tree in the woods and not replanting there isn't too much harm.
specializedtools,fcgv2c4,t1_fcfyyql,1577644287.0,I don't think they hit higher speeds. Highways didn't exist yet
Unity3D,fcd029g,t1_fcctljt,1577604698.0,"If you take a look at the scene view he isn't really zooming. There is no scene movement, so maybe he is working with the numbers differently."
oculus,fby5ock,t1_fby3y63,1577208703.0,I think you just went against your own point...
