dankchristianmemes,ff4xv7x,t1_ff4dc0p,1579575067.0,"You repent of every sin, you have committed and will ever commit, sure people will argue if you keep doing specific sins then you weren’t truely repented, but that’s for God to judge. No matter what you do you will always sin again, it doesn’t have to be in action, it can be in your very thought. You’re not going to get away from sinning. God sees nearly every sin the same, so yeah it’s not fun being compared to murder, but that’s how it is, again, with every sin. Speed limit 70? I go 71? Does the Bible not say obey the law of the land and thus me breaking the law is a sin? So me driving 1 mile over is the same as murdering people? People get so caught up in comparing the sin of homosexuality that they don’t realize the dozens of sins they commit every day. It’s just so interwoven in our lives to the point that denominations do try to twist certain sins as worse. But I’m the end God only asks that we believe in Jesus. It doesn’t matter what people try and twist the Bible into. God himself said it. You can argue with people till you’re blue in the face about if you “really believe” but that’s between you and God. Now yeah, once you do believe, it is scary to know do you “really believe” And thus are “actually” saved. But I feel if you’ve gotten to that point then you are saved because common day Pharisees arnt concerned about that. They care about being wise for the sake of being wise. God loves everyone. God hates sin. We’re all sinners, God doesn’t care what sin you commit (*) as long as you believe Jesus was/is able to take them all on for you.

It is clear your heart is still stone, so these words won’t reach you till God softens your heart, and I will pray for that. But maybe this will be a seed for you. And one day you will actually understand the context of what you’re reading, and not have them be meaningless words. For it is not my opinion that I shared, it is the gospel. I pray one day you can read it with an open heart that will let you see what the words actually stand for. That you will research for yourself the WHY. I’m doing so you will understand Jesus better and thus love Him fully for what He truly did for us.

dankchristianmemes,ff3xf44,t1_ff3dkbc,1579550955.0,"Hey I need to chime in, you can be gay and go to heaven, this whole “burning in hell for being gay” thing isn’t true. Everyone just clarifies it is a SIN. But we are all literally sinners, and you will ALWAYS be a sinner, being a Christian does not make you “not a sinner” literally the only person who is not a sinner is Jesus. The argument is actually, if you love the lord, and know sinning hurts the lord, and chose to sin anyways, do you really love him? But God and Jesus say that it has absolutely nothing to do with what you do that gets you into heaven. It’s about believing in Jesus. Full stop, that’s it. Can a murderer go to heaven? Yes. Came someone who commits suicide? Yes. It literally doesn’t matter what you do (besides openly blasphemy to the Holy Spirit) You go to heaven. Again the only argument people have is “if you really believe in Jesus you wouldn’t commit life style sins (sins you purposely chose to do everyday)” and thus arnt “really“ saved and will go to hell. But it says GOD will judge everyone, to see if they really meant that they believed. Sure, being gay is a sin, so is doing 100’s of other things. God knows we will sin, being gay won’t stop you from going to heaven."
dankchristianmemes,ff3wp2q,t1_ff336of,1579550496.0,"I really think you just went and cherry picked what you think would be good for this argument instead of actually understanding what the context of the verse means. And that’s what the other commentators are trying to show you. In the Old Testament God only made himself accessible in the tabernacle, and thus the people of that time had to do certain things to make themselves worthy of being in Gods presence, but once Jesus came he tore the veil in the tabernacle signifying that God could be reached by all who accept Jesus, no longer do you need to do the rituals because no longer is God only in the tabernacle, no longer is God behind the veil. The Holy Spirit literally lives inside you now, YOU are the tabernacle now. And thus you should do all you can to not sin for it hurts the lord. But the ceremonies from before do not apply because Jesus came and BECAME the sacrificial lamb for slaughter. That is why you no longer have to sacrifice animals, give your grain, etc. HE was the ultimate sacrifice and thus fulfilled the very need to do those ceremonies. We no longer have to go to the tabernacle, God is no longer only there. That is the truth in the Gospel."
