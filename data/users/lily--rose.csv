I would try getting a trainer involved who works with reactive dogs. There are a lot of positive training methods you can try that are simple concepts to demonstrate in person but much harder to explain (at least for me) in writing. 

There is absolutely hope for your pup! Just be patient and work with him to learn that strangers are okay. 

Just a note, though, that it’s unlikely your pup will be a social butterfly any time soon. I don’t take my BC to the dog park or let her spend too much time with or around dogs I don’t know. She tends to get bullied and then starts to act out.  They are very a sensitive breed and tend to do better with a smaller group of friends. Thats okay. They don’t need to be best friends with everyone they meet (I know I’m not friends with everyone I meet). But they also need to get over the lunging/barking (I don’t hit strangers I don’t like, either). That’s possible, so just be patient and consistent and you’ll get there"

They could be training the dog too, trying to work through its anxiety by walking around other dogs who aren’t actively in the anxious dog’s space.

I don’t let my dogs approach any dogs (on or off leash) unless I know they are friendly, but I know not everyone is as strict as me with that. If a dog is on leash, you definitely should not let your dog approach it. You have a small dog - it could get really hurt if it approaches the wrong dog and that dog is reactive/anxious. 

Even if it isn’t an anxious/reactive dog, it could be injured or sick or in training, and it’s not really fair to that dog to have a stranger that close to it’s personal space 

It could be that they are working on getting positive exposure to other dogs (at a bit of a distance) so that eventually the anxious dog can be comfortable at the park. Clearly they aren’t there yet, but it sounds like they’re trying

If you are honest about it and the new owner agrees to take it on, you can’t be held liable. That’s the law where I live. Obviously, I can’t comment on the law everywhere.

Selling a gun as a private seller is illegal where I live too (loaded or not) so maybe I just live in a place that suits me and my safety better than wherever you live. But most people are purchasing a gun as a weapon, not as a pet. They are intending on purchasing an inherently dangerous product. It’s not really the same. 

I understand the point you’re after - if I were to sell someone a car and say it was safe, even though the brakes had just failed on me and I hadn’t got them fixed,  that is a problem. If the purchaser found out I had misrepresented the item, particularly the safety of the item, I’d be in some legal trouble. 

If I was sold an animal advertised as friendly, it came to light that the reason for surrender was an attack history, and the animal showed any signs that it was going to attack or did attack, I would have absolutely no problem raising either a civil or criminal suit (depending on the severity) against the seller. Especially a rescue organization. That’s extremely negligent and they should not be in operation.

The question implies there is a chance the dog can find a suitable home - the fact that people will push so hard for someone else’s pet to be destroyed before even considering having an actual professional behaviorist evaluate the dog or that the dog might have other options is really sad.

Sure, keeping everything off the counters is great in theory but not necessarily practical (families get busy, kids forget, humans forget, guests come over). Taking away the choice doesn’t really help the dog learn to make the right choice.

I would give the dog opportunity to fail when you are capable of correcting it. Keep the dog leashed if needed. Wait until he starts to go for it, and use that opportunity to correct. It’s not an ‘easy’ solution. It’s definitely work. But you’ll have a better dog for it in the long run, and you won’t have to tell everyone who comes over for dinner that they have to go out of their way to make sure your dog doesn’t get into anything.

You can use Skype or FaceTime or something to monitor her when you are in the other room or outside the house to proof that training later 

I know people who have trained their dogs to stay out of the kitchen and dining room entirely (no baby gates involved). I like having my dogs follow me like ducklings, but if you like the idea of them out of those spaces entirely it’s definitely possible. They just sit at the edge of the room, usually, and seem perfectly happy with that.

I had trouble with my border collie not waiting her turn even with that, and she has a pretty good stay in most situations. She just didn’t understand why I wouldn’t be talking to her (after two years of being just the two of us, it kind of makes sense). 

I put both dogs in their crates beside each other, and let one out at a time using it’s name, doing one or two tricks, then sending it back into the kennel and letting the other out. After about 5 minutes I could do that with the kennel doors open. She just needed to realize jumping in front of the other dog wasn’t really an option. That was the easiest way to do it without negative impact on the other dog’s training (I didn’t want him to pick up the habit of interrupting).

I used to have a ton of anxiety leaving my girl at the vet (or anywhere, but that is where I normally I board her) for the same reason. The last time I picked her up I found out she has actually made a friend! I used to be a helicopter dog mom too, and now that I have more dogs and also dog sit often, I’ve found they actually behave better once you learn to relax. I am still always watching out of the corner of my eye, and the minute I see things starting to get rowdy I shut it down right away.

My adult dog crates are almost the same size as a crib and the dogs are only 32lbs and 41lbs. It is like their bedroom and they usually curl up in a corner of the crate anyway. 

It is for their own safety - they get bored or curious, especially as puppies, and can eat things that might kill them. They also need to learn that it is okay to be in a crate- if they need to go to the vet (another user mentioned surgery), it can be a serious hindrance to their recovery if they are super stressed out being in a kennel for the first time. They also may need to have limited movement at home following a surgery in order to heal, which is very difficult to reinforce without a crate

Every behavior issue has a solution. That doesn’t mean the dog is going to be a social butterfly, and it doesn’t mean the dog will ever be exactly the dog you wish it was, but if you put the time and effort in it IS possible for those triggers to be less stressful for the dog and for you. That said, it is a LOT of work and a lot of patience. Depending on the severity, it could be a very large chunk of every day spent training for a long time. If you’ve only tried one or two trainers, do a bit more research and try and find trainers who know your dogs breed(s) and have experience with this kind of behavior. 

If you aren’t able to put that time and effort in (not everyone is - people have families, jobs, etc- and that is okay), or if you really feel you have exhausted training, then start thinking about re-homing. 

I absolutely do not agree with euthanizing a dog for behavioral issues. Most behavior issues are symptoms of handling problems; we (people) are the root of the problem, it is our responsibility to fix it. It’s our responsibility to teach them how to behave in the world that we expect them to live in. 

My first pup would definitely have fit the personality description you gave. I had to recognize some things I let happen to her as a puppy and how they affected her behavior later. I still can’t trust her all the time (3 years of training later) but she’s worlds better and still improving. We’ve had two great trainers and some that made the issues worse. I’ve learned a lot about my own handling and her and I both have a toolbox now to get through stressful situations.  According to my local SPCA criteria, she would have been put down if I had surrendered her there three years ago. She still has her issues, but I never have those days any more when I think about re-homing."

As you say, it’s not that hard to keep dogs from reproducing. I never let my dogs roam unsupervised, but I’m more concerned about car accidents than I am about reproduction. My male gets a holiday with his buddies for a few days every eight months. It’s hardly an inconvenience. 

IMO, all surgeries should be ‘only if medically necessary’. Fixing for convenience doesn’t really seem fair to the animal if that is your only reason. Even without long term health risks, it seems selfish to put your dog through unnecessary procedures and not put the time in to actually teach it how to act around other dogs. But this is up to the owner, at the end of the day, and I’m not going to judge anyone who does fix their pet. 

I understand why shelters would fix before adopting out - they see negligent owners every day and see unwanted pups every day. But that doesn’t mean everyone is negligent. I’ve always figured most people can barely handle one dog; they don’t have an interest in dealing with a large litter of puppies in their home. It’s nice to see this article supports that."

Dogtraining,feru3ra,t3_eq29mc,1579358353.0,"This kind of story drives me crazy. 

The dog in the video absolutely should not be allowed on an airplane.  Especially if it is ‘recoiling and barking’ when approached. You aren’t supposed to distract a service dog as a courtesy, but they absolutely should be trained to ignore distractions and focus on their task as much as possible. You can’t change the public’s behavior - you need to teach your dog to be ready for those situations. Barking at a stranger is an unacceptable stress response for a service dog.

There are legitimate service dogs (and handlers) who have put a lot of work into their job. They are professionals. Emotional support animals have their place as well, but demanding the same privileges (being allowed on an airplane, in this case) without putting in the work is incredibly disrespectful to the teams that do put the work in. 

It’s this kind of behavior and entitlement that will end up really hurting those who actually need service dogs."
kelpie,ferl2ex,t3_eq5fu5,1579355294.0,"With my puppies they don’t get any food at all unless they are working. If she isn’t very food motivated to begin with, you’ll likely waste a lot of money and time trying out better and better treats that aren’t healthy for her in the long run.  I take my pup’s daily food and put it in a bag/treat pouch and they don’t get anything for free for a while. If she’s generally very well fed, it might take her a few days to figure out she has to work for it. 

When they are a bit older, I sometimes use high value treats when I’m training a specific behavior (you get your kibble for heeling, and chicken or something for whatever trick we are working on this week). I try not to overdo treats because they end up eating less of the healthy food when they’re full on treats. 

We do a lot of play with toys on strings- the game always involves the pup following me or coming to me. The game gets more and more fun the closer your pup gets to you, and you become more fun to be around. I never chase my dogs around the house - they have to chase me. 

Always make her come to you for the food, avoid going to her if you can. You can work on her down at the same time as recall - make her down and keep telling her ‘good down’ until you’ve backed up enough for ‘come here’. 

I start any training inside, then slowly move outside (either to a fenced in enclosure or with a very long leash as security) and just keep building distance and adding distractions. If you’re using a lead, try to avoid letting her know it’s there (if it’s a 20 ft lead, your max before you call her should be about 15ft so she has time to make the right choice before the lead catches. It’s there as a safety net) 

I like using a clicker to mark good choices, but you have to build to what you want (shaping). So, first you click when she starts walking away from you (this should prompt her to turn back to you to get her treat). A few days of that and you should be able to catch her walking a few paces and then looking back or stopping without a click.  Once she offers that, click for the the stop or look back, and once she seems to be confident in that, click for her first step back to you. You won’t have to keep a clicker on you all the time- it just helps you communicate with her and mark precise decisions she is making better than your voice can. Once she gets what you want from her, you can lose the clicker. If you’re working her on stock, you could put her on lead and do this around your stock often, getting closer and closer to them so she learns that her habit around stock is to listen to your instruction. 

Don’t expect too much. She’s a puppy- her attention span is probably short. More frequent but shorter sessions are better to start. Try to end the lesson when she is still doing well, before she loses interest or starts to get frustrated. 

I’ve had a lot of success as long as it’s consistent.  

I’ve also found, at least with kelpies & border collies, if you give them a whistle name they tend to come to that more consistently than their English name. There is less emotion when calling with a whistle so less pressure, I think, for the dog if they sense you getting frustrated (a feeling I am very familiar with). 

If you’re really struggling with her, it could be worth a couple sessions with an actual trainer too - just make sure to do your research into what the trainer’s style is and make sure it will work with your own. It doesn’t matter how good a trainer is if the methods they suggest aren’t things you can consistently keep up with or don’t feel good about. If you’re using her for herding, I’d try to find someone with experience with that. 

I don’t know what you’ve done already with respect to training, so hopefully that is a bit helpful!  It’s kind of long, and training absolutely varies with each dog. As long as you are consistent, firm, and kind, they’re likely to respond. Kelpies are super smart. They’re more like people than most dogs.  I love talking training - if you want to go into more about what options you have already exhausted and what else might work, DM me! 

TLDR: 
- feed her less so she isn’t full when she’s working, use her kibble as treats instead of fancy treats 
- start small (no distractions, short distances, enclosed spaces) and build up. Don’t expect her to be perfect. 
- dont over do it. 15-30 minutes a day is good, end sessions when she’s still doing well 
- use a clicker to help shape her choices 
- don’t chase her, make her chase you (it should be fun to come to you) 
- consider a couple sessions with a trainer but make sure you pick someone with the same general mindset as you. Don’t waste your money if you aren’t going to do the follow up"
