The Dr was really abused and ignored as a child and had an incredibly shitty life all the way up till middle age.
His evil schemes and plans always fail or backfire or get thwarted by perry the platypus(the main characters pet who is a secret agent) regardless of how well planned it was simply because the world hates him so much. 

His own parents missed his birth(yes his mother didn't show up either) and favored his brother in every way imaginable, to the point where his father made him sit outside for days to be the family lawn gnome, while they pushed his brother to extreme success as an adult while he got kidnapped and raised by ocelots in the wild and the parents didn't even notice. 

He has a 16 year old daughter who he wishes the best for and takes care of her very well. 
He even maintains and friendly Relationship with his ex-wife in order to keep his daughter happy too.
