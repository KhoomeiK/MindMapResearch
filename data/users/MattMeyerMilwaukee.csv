DeathStranding,fepbljk,t3_eq6uv9,1579316545.0,This gave me anxiety just looking at it.
Cheese,fdpl270,t1_fdpkvej,1578631594.0,"I mean... why even keep the noodles at that point? Beer cheese soup, anyone!? Hahahah."
Cheese,fdokq63,t1_fdo4ooa,1578607109.0,"I’m on the roux train.  Frankly, I’m not sure how I feel about straight milk (and a lot of it), butter, cheese."
dogs,fdlva5m,t3_em0198,1578533319.0,"When I adopted Axel he was 10 years old.  What I found was that he really didn’t like doggy daycare.  It really stressed him out, and he preferred to simply stay home and sleep all day.  I suspect you might find something similar.  

I have the opposite problem with Ax and the bed.  He can’t jump up, but he’ll jump down off bed.  I’ve considered stairs so he’s a little more comfortable both ways.  Amazon and other online marketplaces sell them.  While it doesn’t matter to me... I think such a thing results in being forever single.  Haha.

Would meal prep help your lunch situation?  That could certainly save some decent time."
funny,fdlukfq,t3_elyz1z,1578532839.0,I was expecting something creepy.  I am pleasantly surprised.
teenagers,fdi0o6j,t3_elbgqn,1578433637.0,Dude! Nice job!
ratterriers,fdha8ps,t3_elegch,1578418738.0,Is this mid-stretch? Very cute.
Wellthatsucks,fcypqwl,t3_ejhslk,1578084585.0,"I’m sorry.  Blake was a handsome boy and I’m sure you have him the best life he could have had.  My dog means more to me than any other human, so I can’t imagine what you’re going through."
ratterriers,fcyaarj,t1_fcy8w73,1578077042.0,"She’s cute! 

Any whiskers yet? Ax has his fair share of old man whiskers."
ratterriers,fcya4ah,t1_fcxn0xo,1578076949.0,"Axel actually used to have a black face with a few brown spots.  I wish I could claim salt and pepper, but the old boy is just progressing in age.  I adopted him at 10.  He’s 14 now.  He’s getting grey.

That being said, I volunteer at my local humane society and saw a little guy come through with a salt-and-pepper snout.  If I recall correctly he was 5-6."
ratterriers,fcy9qaj,t1_fcxe4ak,1578076782.0,"The blanket situation is interesting.   While he likes soft stuff to nap on, his favorite blanket is an old-school military replica wool blanket.  It’s incredibly scratchy, but he loves the thing."
ratterriers,fcwhswc,t1_fcwhpmh,1578025983.0,I just can’t get over the little ball he curls into.
ratterriers,fcwancx,t1_fcwadpu,1578021002.0,"Is it from some sort of condition?

I adopted Axel when he was ten from our local humane society.  He had the condition at that point.  I know it’s common in small breeds - I’ve noticed a few chihuahuas around town who look like they’re experiencing the same thing.  For what it’s worth, it doesn’t seem to bother him.  Unfortunately, he’s too old that I wouldn’t be comfortable having him put under for surgery."
ratterriers,fcw9gs6,t1_fcw9853,1578020215.0,"You have a lot of wonderful time left with Tanner.  Axel is 14 years old.  He has a luxating patella, but it doesn’t slow him down!  His old age has just caused him to enjoy snuggling a bit more."
ratterriers,fcw7o2y,t3_eiyfwg,1578019028.0,"Pics like this are exactly why I subscribed.

Unfortunately my little grandpa gets sick in the car."
wholesomememes,fcp7a6l,t3_eibnus,1577852834.0,The question mark is the best part of this.
Rainbow6,fco8uou,t3_ei7tn9,1577826370.0,Nice job! Looks great!
ratterriers,fcanig8,t3_egvpwp,1577572775.0,"My guy is 14, and he’s as sweet as ever.

...around adults.  He seems to have an issue with small children.  He always has.  But it’s seemed to get a little worse as he’s grown older."
vegetarianfoodporn,fc4rc6h,t1_fb24x9k,1577425582.0,"Gotta throw the eggs on top, for sure.  This is happening Sunday."
PublicFreakout,fc4r1md,t1_fc49g8i,1577425293.0,I’m not sure what isn’t sad about either situation.  What’s truly disappointing is that she’s been made a spectacle.  I’m thankful the cops used their discretion and didn’t come in shocking or shooting.
funny,fc4kte3,t1_fc3oktu,1577419602.0,OP doesn’t realize how jealous some of us are of this mistake.
dogs,fc3ftob,t3_efrzm0,1577388857.0,"You’ve done a great job getting yourself back up on your feet.  And the fact that you were able to see and do what was best for your dog through this says a lot of good about your character. 

I think it’s important you recognize your dog is different from others.  For example, mine doesn’t ever jump up and down and make noise when I get home.  He doesn’t do that even though when I’m gone on trips.  But that doesn’t mean he isn’t excited to see me.  And it’s surely the same situation with your dog.  They’re all different, just like we are.

You made a very difficult, heartbreaking decision, but you’re through that.  Your dog loves you.  Focus on the good moving forward."
dogs,fbzmjsy,t3_ef1v9r,1577251843.0,I’m so sorry.  Hopefully you’ve had some solace knowing that you gave Chewy a wonderful life.
ratterriers,fbza2it,t3_eb6g2h,1577239848.0,So cute.  My old boy does the same thing.
