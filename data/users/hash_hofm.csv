college,ffi70if,t3_etm9fz,1579966761.0,"Colleges likely won’t even look at HS results from 3 years ago when making a decision about anything.

Pull yourself together and move forward. Seems like the only direction left for you to go is upwards. Cut out these people from your life.

Best of luck."
college,ffi6hb6,t3_etl7w2,1579966368.0,"It is, even with the scary STEM majors. It is all about sacrifice. Now, I don’t put a lot of merit into the whole triangle of things “you can only pick 2”, but there is certainly truth to the essential idea. You will need to prioritize the necessary over the unnecessary. Most of the time those things come down into categories like Social (partying, friends, etc.), Academic (including GPA, ECs, etc) and personal health (Gym, Sleep, etc.). You probably only really have time to solidly commit to 2 of these things, but it’s all dependent on what your goals are."
college,ffguvdb,t3_etfpv7,1579915657.0,"Get Google Calendar and put your class schedule, homeworks, tests, and finals in when you can. Saved my ass numerous times. Prepare for probably the most stressful semester of your life. Do or die my friend."
college,fffas3o,t3_et56dq,1579879844.0,"If you’re an engineering major or something, then it’ll definitely be harder. My friends who ended up doing engineering in school don’t have great GPAs (think <3.2), but it’s all about work ethic. The best thing you could do is take a shitload of APs and work through that struggle in order to expose yourself to roughly what college will be like. I took like 7 in my senior year and it definitely helped me prepare."
college,fffaiy3,t3_et5eli,1579879684.0,Don’t go to a party school. Usually people are right when it comes to assessing that kind of stuff.
college,fffaab8,t3_et76mg,1579879531.0,Yeah... these kinds of things are at best one liners you put in the summary part of your college on LinkedIn. Most of the time they won’t amount to anything more than a recurring membership fee. The only case imo where they’re somewhat relevant is when you have the opportunity to take a leadership position in them. But even this pales in comparison to things like GPA and GMAT (assuming you’re interested in business). ECs in general aren’t worth a ton unless you’re talking about research/internships.
college,fffa30u,t3_eta9zu,1579879399.0,"Do it for the credit. I did. Saved easily like $20k+ that would’ve otherwise been wasted on geneds. It won’t really help your odds, but you might as well end strong."
msu,ff8agp6,t3_er6okr,1579670884.0,"Talk with NatSci advisor and talk with Broad advisor. They'll be able to tell you whether or not it's even possible. To declare any major, all you have to do is set up an appointment with the respective major advisor and ask them."
msu,ff89xjl,t3_erivb9,1579670381.0,"Go for an anonymous noise complaint, or something along those lines if it gets bad enough. RA is gonna be useless and just make shit worse most of the time. If you can't resolve it one-on-one with this guy, you probably won't be able to. Worst comes to worst, get in direct contact with housing and ask to get a room change for whatever reasons you feel will accomplish that goal. Feel free to PM me for more info. I had a similar situation last semester that I was able to get out of. Best of luck."
TransferStudents,fehzp29,t3_ep5kq2,1579127145.0,"You kinda just know. That’s it. College is for 4 years, which is a long time, but your whole life is likely to be much longer."
gradadmissions,fedw4um,t3_eolen9,1579021145.0,All is not lost (very far from it actually). Retake.
msu,fedj8xk,t3_enuz7k,1579012923.0,"Pros: 
* Get to do whatever you want with classes. You could take a full schedule of grad classes in your first semester if you so desire. But that would be a terrible idea.
* Early class signup
* Being Honors college does make you more competitive for things
* Honors floors are meh imo, but they’re good for some people
* All classes besides honors classes have the ability for you to get honors experiences

Cons: 
* More work, but as a college student this is something you want anyways.
* There aren’t really any real drawbacks."
