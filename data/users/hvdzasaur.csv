For example, most of them offer a tax deduction for investing your money in a pension savings/investment plan (like a 401k). Building an emergency fund is universal, etc. 

So I'd look into the sidebar, and check what your country's equivalent is of it. If you want to invest your money yourself, look into you local country's investment plans. It's a bit hard to give advice for us Europeans, because things can vary a lot between countries. Despite European rights, a lot of financial institutions still don't allow you to open even a basic payment account with them without (kind of) being a legal resident in the country they're seated in (fuck you, France).

However, generally you cannot go wrong with building towards an emergency fund for later on when you are going to start living on your own. While I don't know your parents, I'd say they have it when you spend a lot of money on frivolous or luxury goods. Have a sit down with them, and tell them you want to learn about saving and investing money, want to start building towards a future now, and they will probably be more lenient or even supportive.

Showerthoughts,fdyulbo,t1_fdxlzwa,1578783737.0,"Just to reiterate, fats make you feel satiated faster than the other macro nutrients, and takes longer to digest. Also remember that your body converts and stores excess glucose (from ingested carbs) as body fat. Your body will generally prioritize using glucose as your source of energy, before it starts touching your fat reserves. This is why people who go on a low carb, high fat diet tend to lose weight, because you are limiting your glucose and fructose intake, and forcing your body to draw energy from ingested and stored fat. Then because fat makes you feel full, you are less likely to overconsume.

Furthermore, in case if you are worried about increased risk of heart disease from higher fat consumption, there is a meta analysis of a ton of healthcare studies find there is actually no significant supporting evidence for a link between (unsatured) fat consumption and risk of heart disease. That widely peddled claim basically is bogus. In fact, recent studies indicate it's more a combination of lack of exercise, high cholesterol, and high refined carb consumption."

During the Syrian conflict, Germany hosted over 700k refugees by itself. Afaik, the way it happens is that first they flee to nearby countries to refugee camps, and they then apply for asylum in the EU. UN organisations then aids the refugees to get asylum and reach EU, ofcourse with permission of the host countries. The second largest pool of refugees Europe had was from Afghanistan. Freedom of movement does not apply, and some also pay traffickers to flee here illegally.

The legal refugees are typically distributed over the EU, but the problem is that some countries are adamant about not taking them (Italy literally just let a rescue boat full of people sit at sea), or take less than other countries, leading to an uneven burden that puts a strain on their economies. It's a bit wild when Belgium was prepared to host more Syrian refugees than France, or that Germany hosted more than 75% of those that went to the EU.

The fear of some people here is that if the conflict grows worse, European countries would be left to pick up a large part of the displaced people (since Turkey and others are already overwhelmed right now). Especially if they live in a country that has a track record of hosting way more than some other memberstates.

Even if the EU stays out of the conflict, we will be adversely affected by it. That is the point I was getting at.

We found evidence of this between 2011-2015 Why do you think that article has no listed author? Let's look at the publication date of that article ... 2015. Oh, hmmm.

source:  [https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%2816%2930331-2/fulltext](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%2816%2930331-2/fulltext)

Plenty of research indicates there is no real evidence that fat is solely to blame, and instead indicates that sugar is more of a risk factor. Also, I said that ""fat clogs up arteries"" is complete unscientific nonsense, because that's literally not how it works.

It's still a hotly debated topic however. What is conclusive however is that high cholesterol, high refined carb intake (such as sugar) and lack of exercise COMBINED means you are at higher risk of CHD and CVD.

Then you also have this meta-analysis study that re-evaluate this and found that there is no signficant evidence to support a link between saturated fat intake and higher risk of CHD/CVD. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648#](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648#)

This has been dubbed the ""French Paradox"", but on closer inspection it's more so because the typical French diet includes a lot of natural foods, and low amount of processed foods compared to British and American diets.

From what I remember when I last read the papers, the issue lies more so that CHD is due to a combination of highly refined carbs intake, high cholesterol and lack of exercise. High saturated fat intake supoosedly has a correlation with high cholesterol (which some new research points out is now not true), but so does sugar. And sugar has been found to cause a whole slew of abnormalities in the body. High cholesterol by itself is not the sole contributing factor, nor is it the problem by itself.

When you replace fats in food, something else has to take it's place. And to make up for the taste, the food industry increase the amount of sugar in their products because it's cheap.

There are also some recent studies where they observed the cholesterol effect of high consumption of eggs and/or cheese (both believed to be responsible for high cholesterol) in an otherwise healthy diet, and found no significant increase compared to the control groups.

Look, I get very anal about changes an adaptation makes to the original source material (fuck youm Game of Thrones), but I also know that some things simply do not translate well to TV format. Drawing out Ciri's arc to way before the fall of Cintra wouldn't have translated well to the screen, I feel.

The effort they made for the character looks is a bit inconsistent tho. They had their cast wear contacts for the right eye colors, but then couldn't be bothered to give Triss proper red hair, what?"
wow,fcpljrx,t1_fcohwsm,1577866957.0,"No, it's the showrunners bungling it up. Reviewers were sent selected episodes to review ahead of time. That backfired because of how the season is structured. Other reviewers waited until the entire show was online.

It happens quite often that shows do this, they either sent the first few episodes out, or selected ones. They probably thought because the season was kind of episodic (at least geralt's story), it's safe to send out selected."
wow,fcpkqgg,t1_fcoocrq,1577866478.0,"It's not as bad as you make it out to be. Ciri's storyline suffers the most from it because they really wanted the series to end with their first meeting. The rest of the changes were very minor or shifting characters a bit around, which is to be expected with adaptations."
wow,fcpk332,t1_fcok1og,1577866105.0,"To be fair, the short stories are meant to do the world building, show you what witchers are, what they do, geralt's character, and dropping lore along the way.

So that you are then prepared for the big main story, which is coming in season 2. 

There are 2 problems with the Witcher series (imho) why it feels disorientating for new people to the universe and casual viewers, is that the episodes have 3 timelines that are intercut with eachother, and that Geralt's POV for the short stories were meant to that worldbuilding/explanation. When you cut from one scene to another in conventional filmmaking (and what most audiences by now are conditioned to be used to), you lead the audience to believe that the scenes are happening concurrently. Which is not the case for the Witcher series. You have one linear timeline of 3 weeks, 1 linear timeline of 30-40 years, and 1 episodic timeline that jumps. 
Because in the books you're only dealing with Geralt's POV initially, you gradually get introduced to the characters that are going to be important in the main storyline. In the series, because of how it's cut, you get thrown head in first in two threads, and then name drops get retroactively explained in the other threads, rather than be prepared. Now a lot of the worldbuilding felt like exposition dumps because either they have to retroactively explain a name drop, or prepare the audience for a important name drop in that same episode."

YouOnLifetime,fcb5g7c,t1_fc4mxad,1577582595.0,"They're clearly thinking about milking this series for another season when they shot that final scene. 

I personally think it's great they don't take a clear stance on it. It really fucks with your own brain, makes you question your own moral compass as you are watching the show as they get you to root for two psychopathic killers. Honestly, this show makes me feel disgusted with myself. I've had similar thoughts compared to Joe throughout my life, but never acted on them. They scare me. And I think it's amazing that the writers of the book and show managed to hold that disturbing funhouse mirror up to me.
I never had that while watching Dexter.

Had they taken a clear stance, I don't think I would have had that experience. But for sure, don't let anyone without critical thinking skills watch this.

Edit: to be clear, I never stalked anyone, I never masturbated outside someone's house, or killed anyone. Have I thought about these things? 2/3, yes."

gaming,fcanpcz,t1_fc0fyqt,1577572887.0,"Yeah, it's a problem related to patches in general that they can sometimes break things. It's why day 1 patches are typically huge downloads. You're not downloading a patch, you're downloading a new build of the game, because that has lower risk."
AskReddit,fcam2mb,t1_fc43rbn,1577571933.0,"Not super familiar with it, has something to do with fresh accounts afaik for GTA online.

But as for typical MMO grey/black market trade, they typically cycle through accounts because they keep getting suspended for breaking TOS to accrue ingame currency. To offer some perspective, Blizzard announced they had over 100 million WoW accounts in 2014 (when you still had to buy the base version of game). Sale numbers/account numbers for MMOs are not a realistic representation of how many unique players you have. It makes for good juicy headlines tho."
wow,fcakjpp,t1_fca7iyx,1577571012.0,"You're not dealing with one texture map in WoW, fyi. Spec/Gloss maps must be adjusted as well.

However, the real reason might be data bandwidth. Each recolour costs the same in terms of texture memory resources. Blizzard bakes color into their textures (source: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/82Qx6), so each recolor is a unique set of textures. 
In a dynamic level streamed games like WoW, typically textures are loaded in last, and occupy the rest of remaining memory. So when you overstuff your memory, textures get loaded in at lower mip levels (downscaled resolution that is baked into the file), leading to overall degradation of the game's textures across the board (depending on the load priorities).
From what I know of WoW texture artist workflow, they typically still handpaint parts even for recolors of sets, so it's a bit more work than simply color tuning the maps.

I like the work OP has been doing. He really shows off his panache for combingin color schemes to make striking sets, and I do think more player option is ultimately better. But I also know why they might not be offering 10 recolors for each heritage set. If anything, him posting these here leads to him getting on Blizzard's radar, and possibly getting his foot in the door of the industry. (yes, a lot of devs actually read subreddits of the games they work on, because they're sadists. Speaking out of experience)"
