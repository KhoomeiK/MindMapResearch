Some doctors try to give you a shot every two weeks but that would have your hormones all over the place as Test Cyp and Test E's half-lifes are not suitable for 2 shots a month without feeling like ass.  
  
I do twice a week and I backload the oil into a insulin pin (the tiny ones). Super easy and much less scary than the 1-1.5 inch jab to your backside lol. You have to backload because the insulin pin can push the oil through but takes forever to draw with it. slin pins are a game changer, even I felt uneasy when I would jab a 1.5 inch into my ventro glute or glute."
gifs,ff2803q,t1_ff2363t,1579496463.0,"HGH alone will not give you any noticeable muscle gain but is safer in that it doesn't shut down yout HPTA like Test or steroids do. HGH is more of a vanity item that should be combined with AAS. At 2iu a day you'd see better fat loss at your age, maybe some nicer skin due to collagen, deeper sleep. You will not experience acromalgy as in growth of hands or anything at that dose lol that happens to bodybuilders slamming a vial+ a day (10iu+). And no you need to take HGH before your growth plates fuse as a teenager for it to have any effect on height.  
  
At 31, married especially if you've had your kid(s) or don't plan to is a pretty awesome age for TRT. Don't want to do TRT? Beginner cycle is always just 500mg of Test for 12 weeks then PCT to come off safely. If you don't like needles don't bother, if you can't handle the mental aspect of coming off don't bother. I don't care what people say when you cycle unless you are lucky there is a shitty period of 3 weeks - 1 month were you feel like ass on PCT.
  
Downsides: If you are prone to male pattern baldness in your family it will accelaerate it, gyno/tissue growth if you have issues with estrogen, shuts down your natural test production and the longer you stay on the harder it is to kickstart back up.  
  
benefits: Faster recovery time, better growth, a look you won't achieve naturally, increased libido at your age potentially, increased sense of well being/confidence potentially. Faster results, used properly with a solid foundation of training like you say you have they really can be cheat codes but they aren't just pay2win where you inject it and look like the guys on the magazines like half of reddit seems to act like.

I tell most people santa isn't real folks even the ""Fit"" models on the magazine covers are juicing it is so, so, SO common now and it's really unfortunate that men don't get the same attention that the ""no makeup or photoshop ads"" women are starting to get. Some of us will push it to the limit once you realize what is and isn't possible for a natural lifter look. I've accepted that fact and went down the rabbit hole, there really is no turning about for me now as I've probably shut my natural production down to the point where it won't come back or I'd be damn lucky if I ran a Power PCT protocol and it started up.  
  
You got illegal underground labs literally buying multi thousand dollar machines just to fill their vials etc. like ISO quality production in the US and Canada for steroids. Generic HGH being produced in China/Russia and then sent in for testing for quality. It's a billion dollar business.
  
As a natural lifter unless you have insane were talking god tier genetics your most important factor is TIME. Time and consistency to get anything close to what a lot of guys want, we're talking a few years of lifting, eating, muscle maturity, and then a deep cut.  
  
and then the main point of them all, the shittiest one we can't change is genetics. The way you look, if you do take steroids genetics are huge as well. Those guys you see standing on stage are literally god-tier genetics as well as grams and grams of steroids no matter what lies they tell you. As someone who isn't afraid to dabble and has tried HGH, and most injectable steroids the shit those guys do to themselves terrifies me. Shooting insulin 3x a day and making sure you have a sugary drink incase you go hypo and die, copious amounts of HGH, GRAMS of injectables, and one of the worst enough orals to make your liver cry.

ALOT of people feel like shit during the initial week where your body switches over and you deprive it of carbs but after that it's a much ""cleaner"" feeling energy with a lot less dips and valleys in your energy. But the first week can entail flu like symptoms for some people like headache, lethargy, etc. Recommended to consume electrolytes like BCAA or even broth to help with this. After that week once you stick to it, it's smooth sailing.  
  
But I will say this, they did do a controlled study (like these people had to stay for the week they were observed study) where they gave one group low carb and one group low fat. The low fat / higher carb group actually lost a decent amount more % weight than the low carb group. But again this was only one week. I'll dig up the study if anyone is interested.  
  
In the very end it's simply calories in vs calories out. Calculate your TDEE  (google TDEE Calculator) and subtract a couple to a few hundred calories off what it tells you to consume per day to cut and voila.

FairFight is biggest roadblock all but eliminates aimbotting, I've read it even identifies LOS if you snap to someone through smokes etc. I can believe it because I saw a list of what APEX tracks and they have a huuge list of metrics that they could do the same it just takes a shitload of work I'm assuming."

apexlegends,fdoduie,t1_fdnkq2y,1578603312.0,"There's not much you can do besides HWID bans. HWID bans really are a bitch for cheaters, they create a footprint based on typically motherboard/HD or whatever mix of hardware serials they want so you if try to create a new account, VPN, etc. it still bans you within a game or two.  

Now there are HWID spoofers but these are another layer that idiots must discover and use and they also can be detected like cheats. So now the cheat user must pay for a HWID Spoofer + Cheats and they have another vector to be banned from.  

EAC has improved 10 fold from the old days of whatever they had implemented (every games implementation of EAC is not the same/good Rust being an example of EAC on steroids).  

You can't eliminate cheaters, you can only limit them. In my opinion the worst nightmare for cheaters, especially people who want to rage is a system like FairFight. Back-end server statistics that can catch people right down to tracing through smoke or places they shouldn't have Line of Sight."

I don't even watch baseball or have a team, I just do my research and I like the juice myself.

apexlegends,fdle78n,t1_fdlb1tw,1578522118.0,"What? Unless in the TOS it says you are to only have one account your comparison makes no sense. Leveling another character vs Alt-F4'ing is a ridiculous comparison. SBMM will eventually pair you with your skill level, dashboarding consistently protects you from RP loss.  

  

Creating a new account to play on neither falls under exploit or abuse definition?"
apexlegends,fdl6r9o,t1_fdl4df2,1578518000.0,"Whatever you say bud here's his stats eliminating the years of 1999-2007 where he was juiced to the gills:  

 \*If his career had ended in 1998, Bonds would be a .290 hitter with [411 home runs](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bondsba01-bat.shtml#cumulative_batting::none), 1,917 hits, 1,216 RBI, 1,357 walks (289 intentional) and a .966 OPS (164 OPS+). There are four other players eligible for the Hall of Fame with at least 400 home runs and 1,900 hits combined with a .290 career average and 160 career OPS+, all are enshrined in Cooperstown — Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams. \*"
apexlegends,fdl2h04,t1_fdkyvko,1578515933.0,"Dashboarding/Alt-F4 is basically abusing Respawn's loss forgiveness mechanic but ensuring if you're team is going to wipe when you're still at negative RP one of your teammates dashboards or Alt-F4's. Apex thinks that client crashed and provides loss forgiveness to the entire team allowing them to effectively climb to predator with no risk of ever losing RP if done right. Sure you can get raped tons of games in a row but anytime you guys are negative RP they would Dashboard/""Crash"".  

Basically with all the exploits this seasons Predators are so watered down compared to last season. There was also the other exploit allowing you as a predator to join your buddies into a bronze/silver ranked match at the last second and clean house for easy wins."
apexlegends,fdkzbbp,t1_fdkvema,1578514259.0,Definitely not the greatest but those that attribute all his success to juice didn't watch him before he became a juice freak with a GH head. He was an amazing player either way.

nba,fdf5mjs,t1_fdeywqr,1578353850.0,"But when looking at MVP voting it was clear the Triple double anomaly is what catapulted him, whatever factor KD not being there had it was mostly the retarded stats and then no matter how inefficient he was that season he just kept pulling off the most clutch wins for OKC. I would agree with you but the previous poster makes it sound like it was a pity MVP that WB needs to thank KD for."
nba,fdenbyy,t1_fdeklmp,1578342640.0,"WB MVP had nothing to do with a small market being ditched by KD. The argument can be made about Harden for MVP but your point is ridiculous. That wasn't even part of his narrative it was accomplishing something that hadn't been seen in over 50 years and playing out of his mind in the games near the end of the season that typically push the narrative in your favor.

Explain the logic behind the voting? ""Aw man OKC must be heartbroken KD left, give Westbrook the MVP to cheer them up"". No it was holy shit this guy averaged a triple double for the whole season coupled with the clutch games near the end of the season that won him that MVP even with a lower seed."

nba,fdej5rt,t1_fdef3bq,1578340143.0,"You can say that hes inefficient but you can't really say he's not a winning player, those thunder years were stacked and he was obviously a huge part of them. Are you referencing the years after KD ditched his ass and he was basically trying to carry a team that couldn't shoot? Even after that the guy put up 3 seasons of triple doubles with a MVP season."

\*

Vice Admiral Robert Howard, USN who is a Navy SEAL commanded, as a Captain, The Task Force K-Bar which was a combined special operations force that included many units from the American special forces community as well as the Canadian JTF2 (and units from other countries). After the operations were over, he made some comments on working with JTF2.

*Captain Bob Harward, USN, SEAL, Task Force K-Bar commander, commented:*

*“This is the first coalition direct action mission since the Second World War. You guys all pass into history right now.” Indeed he said JTF2 was his first choice for any direction action missions.\**"
