hottoys,fcabel0,t3_egocej,1577566118.0,I got this too and have done almost the exact same pose! He's a really awesome piece!
hottoys,fc54f7v,t1_fc4ycuh,1577442607.0,I did it. I got Maul. They had another 2 Obi wan's so I get the feeling he won't be going anywhere soon
hottoys,fc4y6vx,t1_fc4y38u,1577433562.0,"Yeah Maul is likely what I'm gonna get. I've already phoned and asked for him to be put aside, but that was just an ""oh shit"" rushed decision the other day when I realised they had him in. They've had Obi-Wan for like 4 months and nobody's bought him yet"
