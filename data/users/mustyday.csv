EDAnonymous,ffidtlt,t3_etnju4,1579971493.0,"It seems like one or two bad days of eating will make my weight sky rocket up by about 5lbs and then 3 or 4 days of a deficit will make it go straight down. I’ve gone from 143 back up to 148 in two days then back down to 143 in 4 days of restricting. Not even heavy restricting, I’ve been eating 1000 a day on average since my last binge (which was only 1000 calories above my tdee)

I don’t get it, why is it so easy for me to gain and to lose? If I ever go back to maintenance calories I’ll balloon up 30lbs in a month. This is literally the ONLY thing stopping me from attempting recovery. I don’t even want to lose anymore I just don’t want to gain."
