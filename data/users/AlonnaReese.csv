Back in 2017, the Brookings Institute published a [study](https://www.brookings.edu/research/lessons-from-the-end-of-free-college-in-england/) on why free college in the UK ended up being problematic. Firstly, it lead to an increase in admission standards to the universities as a growing number of students fought over a limited number of slots. An admissions standards arms race hurts students from low income families because they can't afford to pay for test prep courses or private tutors to meet the new requirements.

Second, the cost of food and housing were a more significant financial barrier to higher education than tuition. This is often the case in the US as well. Doing the first two years at a community college and then transferring to moderately priced four-year school can be done relatively cheaply. Students from wealthy families are at an advantage when it comes to living expenses because their parents may allow them to live at home for free or rent an apartment for them."
