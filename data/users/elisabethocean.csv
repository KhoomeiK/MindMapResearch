college,ffjjozz,t3_etuh50,1579999765.0,"I took this Intro to business course so I could take a marketing class for my elective requirements.  She said if you were taking this class for an easy A you came to wrong class and that you had to work for your A. She gave us packets of work and information for the semester. She also said 2 people were failing last semester. During the last 2 weeks of class I think they worked really hard with a tutor to pass the course. She said they had to work hard for their A and so would we. She also said we had to do ALOT of outside of class work. She also encouraged us to work with our schools tutors if we found ourselves having trouble because her class was hard. I dropped the intro class that night and the marketing class the next night. I picked up one class for required for my major that I was waitlisted on that opened up. I didn’t even show up to my marketing class the next day. I went to the class I picked up first class meeting and then spent the next hour I would’ve been in my marketing class finding a professor to sign a over the limit form for a elective “related” to my major. I needed to take the intro course in order to take marketing class I originally wanted. I thought it was way to much work for a intro course I DIDNT NEED and didn’t even want to take. That intro course also has nothing to do with my major.

Edit: 
TL;DR is I dropped a intro to business class after 1 meeting because professor said it wasn’t an easy A course then had to forfeit and didn’t show up to 1st marketing class meeting that I originally wanted because intro was a perquisite"
college,ff32e2b,t3_er72ir,1579531884.0,School has definitely effected by mental health. I did 3 years of community and transferred to small private college in my town. Not only is my self esteem at an all time low since like sophomore hear of high school but I’m also emotionally and mentally drained. I was such a different place mentally a year ago. I was so confident and yes stressed but I was still happy. I’ve noticed I’ve been more cranky these days and easily bothered. I also took so many steps back on being self conscious. It took like years to get to a place we’re i loved myself now I hate myself. I don’t only hate my body but I hate my life and personality. It really sucks I’m so stressed  about the present and future. I also have not made any friends yet. Acquaintances? Yes but not real friends. I’m hearing seniors complaints and not looking forward to senior year. I thought it would get easier but it’s only get harder.
college,fdqqc8g,t3_emr95v,1578672607.0,Use the resources your school provides and think about going to a therapist if you can afford one. You definitely needs some time to stop and process this. Schools usually provide mental Heath services so look into that.
