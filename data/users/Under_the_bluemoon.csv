ForeverAlone,fh5rn7b,t3_f1duvf,1581291717.0,"All of your descriptions of “women” here refer specifically to young, thin, conventionally attractive women. Life is nothing like this for women who are older (even middle aged), fat (even moderately fat), and/or ugly (even just below average looking).

I’m a member of all three of these groups, and life is a constant stream of discrimination for things than my male peers face little-to-no discrimination for. Men who are older, fat, or unattractive can get jobs consummate with their education and experience. Men who are older, fat, or unattractive still have dating options (I and my similar female friends never date). Men with these qualities can achieve high political office (women rarely do). They can be promoted into executive positions (most female execs — who are much less common — are very thin, and have had plastic surgery). 

Men, regardless of their size, looks, or age remain seen and treated as *human beings*. For women, being seen and treated as a real person is so often contingent on her appearance and body. Men are taken seriously when they express their opinions. Men are usually able to move about freely without being subject to harassment (cat calling or fat calling) or danger from other random folks beyond possible robbery. Women are paid less, and are less likely to be given raises when they ask. Women are more likely to live in poverty. Women are more likely to be diagnosed with mental health conditions, and more likely to attempt suicide. Women who are attractive enough to marry are dependent on being able to maintain their looks, and have the ‘privilege’ of being expected to work as much as men, while also doing most of the housework and childcare. Women have staggeringly high rates of sexual victimization throughout their lives. Women are highly likely to face online harassment, and are more likely to be victims of stalking IRL. Women who don’t or can’t have children are often hassled and devalued by others, but women who do have children face discrimination in the workplace.

I have to get back to work, but it’s easy enough to look up more gender discrepancies.

If they leave me by myself, I either get salespeople asking, “Are you looking for *a GIFT for someone*?” Or I get ignored but with looks from the salespeople like I’m lowering the value of their merchandise just by having my fat arse in their thin-people store."
IncelTears,ffivwt6,t3_etu85f,1579983979.0,"I mean, the problem here isn’t that this guy thinks these women are fat, it’s that he thinks that *being fat makes a woman inferior*. (And that referring to a person as “obese” is acceptable. It’s not.)

Kind of disappointed by all the comments that think that saying “but she isn’t fat!” is a good response here. Would this be okay if she *were* fat?"
Trufemcels,ffievh1,t3_etbg0j,1579972204.0,That post is so degrading. It’s speaking of women like livestock for sale or a painting to hang on the wall. I feel terrible for any woman who gets sucked into a relationship with that trash man.
Trufemcels,ffi3rpo,t3_etm4zq,1579964238.0,"I don’t stress out much about this. There are certainly people here who have BDD, and mental illnesses like that can often keep women out of relationships no matter what they look like. If someone feels compelled to hide in her home because she’s fixated on her appearance, she’s going to be alone.

Also, we need to stop copying the bizarre incel claims that attractiveness is all about “bone structure” and that weight and skin conditions are “fixable.” I can assure you that almost every single woman who is even the least bit chubby or has severe acne has, at some point, tried everything she can access to “fix” it. If a woman is fat or has skin problems, it’s because that’s the way her body is, not because she’s not putting in effort, or nonsense of that sort. The problem is widespread prejudice against those characteristics."
Trufemcels,ffhjbye,t3_etn8ho,1579937863.0,"Appearance shouldn’t be anyone’s motivation for eating healthily. In spite of all the media hype claiming that healthy eating will make skin glow and bodies shrink, it isn’t true — but it will help you feel better (it will especially help with mental-health issues, which are pretty obvious in your posts).

I’ve been a vegan and a health-food person for decades now. But it will never make me attractive — I’m very, very fat, and have the masculine features and bone structure, beard stubble, and hair loss, that are all typical with PCOS.

But having a nutritionally complete diet, with an adequate intake of food (I was anorexic for years), has given me great energy for my work, and a stable mind that has weathered some major blows. Without good nutrition and enough calories, you will have trouble thinking clearly, mood swings, depression, and potentially other issues (like BDD, anxiety, etc.)."
Trufemcels,ffhe7pf,t3_etktzv,1579931635.0,"This is a situation that requires therapy.

It’s VERY worrisome that you’re behaving this way when you’re in an occupational role that involves working with vulnerable people. Doctors deserve to be told when they’re terrible people, sure, but you’re spending most of your time with patients and families, presumably often in crisis."
IncelTears,ffhdysy,t1_ffh8fn7,1579931368.0,"Yes, I agree they’re the opposite of asexuals in that regard.

I’m not defending them at all. They’ve chosen their toxic attitude. But not all of them have a choice about whether or not they’re alone — some of them are clearly very mentally ill and paranoid, for example. Most of them have been bullied, and are easily sucked into incel communities that promise them acceptance when they’ve only found rejection elsewhere.

Many people have no choice over their aloneness — but most don’t become incels. Just look at the many women (including myself) around the world who are romantically or sexually shunned for unalterable aspects of our appearance. Very few women become toxic and outwardly hate-filled because of this exclusion (many do come to hate themselves, though). This itself reaffirms that taking up incel ideology is a choice, even in cases where being alone is not."
IncelTears,ffh7h0c,t1_ffh53uk,1579925270.0,"I’m not clear what you mean.

As I’m sure you know, many asexual people do have sex.

Among self-identified incels, many have made choices that keep them alone. But some are also on the autism spectrum or have mental-health issues or physical differences that prevent them from getting sexual partners (this was even more true of ‘incel’s original usage, for socially isolated people).

Some incels could find partners if they made changes to their attitudes and behaviors, but there will always also be ‘forever alone’ people (most of whom don’t identify as incels)."
IncelTears,ffh2imw,t3_etfipw,1579921359.0,"The ‘involuntary’ is placed before ‘celibate’ to qualify that aspect (choice) implied by the latter term.

There’s the kind of social privilege you refer to here, but also thin privilege and beauty or looks-based privilege — and even some of the most-marginalized people will cling to these like talismans if they have them."
