toronto,feht8xl,t1_fehjr06,1579123414.0,If the 407 was free then it would be gridlocked too.  I drive from Scarborough to Brampton everyday for work and coming back on the 407 takes me 45 minutes tops.  Using the 401 can take anywhere from 2-3 hours.  It costs me 16 bucks to take it home and the 2 hours of commute time I save makes it all worth it.  It’s a selfish way for me to think but i get to spend those extra hours with my wife and kid and dogs.

toronto,fecbfg7,t1_feca7cd,1578970122.0,Yeah and maybe the company goes under and then another company comes up and their drivers are willing to be paid less so they eliminate these guys who are making better wages.  And then it’s just a cycle of the same shit which is probably why Taxi’s operated the way they did for so long.  Not just anybody can be a Taxi.

The driver is approaching a crosswalk and it’s his responsibility to stop when someone is standing there.  Otherwise what’s the point of the crosswalk? Might as well never stop and just have cars continuously drive through indefinitely.  That way no one will ever be able to cross.
