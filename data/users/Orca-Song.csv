pokemon,ffgewbw,t3_etdhfy,1579904691.0,"I thought it said ""Willywag"" for a minute and I was concerned. I am too corrupted."

pokemon,fffkz6v,t3_et9jhc,1579886220.0,That's pretty neat! Kind of reminds me of the blue dragon sea slug.
childfree,fffkgux,t1_ffejfjz,1579885908.0,What a horrible thing to say! Just because he doesn't like something doesn't mean he should consider killing it.
childfree,fffk92l,t3_et6za9,1579885772.0,"Well, where's the lie? Yes, of course pets consume resources too, but compared to even a single child? He hasn't got a right to complain about the resources a dog is taking up when he's planning to bring *four human beings* into this world."

HydroHomies,ffdexzf,t1_ffddiku,1579819452.0,"I don't recall ever hearing any of that during my certification, but I'm not an expert either. It always felt more like a gentle suck more than blowing (which I mean as innocently as possible but I know I'm asking to get memed on with that terminology)."
childfree,ffdbo0a,t1_ffd4hjv,1579817428.0,"Not quite the same, but one of my classmates posted pictures of her stillborn on Facebook a few years back. I don't care about baby pictures, and I *definitely* don't want to see dead baby pictures."

childfree,ff9w2pe,t3_esdtf3,1579722771.0,"To be fair, if the trade-off was a dragon at the price of relentless questions, I'd take the dragon.

childfree,ff9hxvx,t3_es98jm,1579713398.0,"Any dummy can get creampied/creampie someone else and make a baby. It's been happening for millennia. Almost 8 BILLION people on this planet at this moment prove you are not unique in your ability to breed. It's really not special.

Meanwhile the only guaranteed way of not getting pregnant is to just not let anything up in there ever. And if you like hetero sex, then you're always taking a risk until you can finally convince a surgeon that yes, you are 1,000% sure you do not and will not ever want children, please yeet the fertility away."
