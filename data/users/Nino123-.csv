I could improve relations though, so thanks a lot!"
eu4,ffovu8s,t3_euf5i0,1580082456.0,"R5: I have full annexed my animist neighbours giving me now 27 dev. I have a force limit of 7k. My economy is 0.51$ per month. I'm allied to no one and have no vassals and I'm still at tech one. I have three stability (lucky events). My general is a 3/1/1/0. And my ruler is a 3/1/2. Eventually I want to form Maya.

My Aztec neighbours have multiple allies and I'm afraid to attack them since they get a morale of armies boost and they have a lot more troops than me. I have a couple of plans on who to attack but I wanted to get some reassurance.

My first possible target is Tonala who is allied to Matlatzinca or Tohancapan who is allied to Zapotec and Matlatzinca

I could also attack Otomi, but they have way too many alliances.

Please help me."

eu4,ffdh6cz,t3_esyqrg,1579820776.0,"Malacca is a fun choice and you can get a pretty high economy and form Malaya. Malayan  Ideas are goodish and help with colonies. 

Bengal is a strong choice for an Indian expansion game. They have costal provinces at the start (unlike some other Indian Nations) which makes it easier to start colonizing quickly. Bengal also has good trade and some challenges with Vijayanagar/Bahmanis/Orissa. Bengal is able to form Hindustan if you stay Muslim, but if you convert to Sikhism or Hinduism then you will be able to form Bharat.

An interesting and hard one would be playing as Byzantium. If you defeat the Ottomans it will start getting easier though. You can also form Rome with Byzantium."

And yes you can convert to Judiasm, but it's usually discouraged by Rabbis and Jews."
minecraftsuggestions,ff80h32,t1_ff7u9ym,1579662790.0,"I mean if you're wearing full unenchanted diamond armor the explosion (which does vary between difficulties and proxmitiy.) will leave you with one health if I did my math right.

I will decrease it a bit, but the stronghold shouldn't be easy imo. Thanks for the feedback."
minecraftsuggestions,ff7cjui,t1_ff7a40a,1579646390.0,That method of dye-ing does sound less tedious. I'll write it as a better possibility for making dyed haybales
minecraftsuggestions,ff6yvsf,t1_ff6y9vl,1579637725.0,"Yeah, the feathers do seem weird lol, idk why I even considered it. The speed potion also seems kinda weird so I'll probably remove that as well. 

For the gold carrots I was kind of thinking a more advanced zombie drop, since normal zombies do drop regular golden carrots. 

Thank you for the feedback."
minecraftsuggestions,ff6yhv3,t1_ff6wpwi,1579637498.0,That's a really cool idea. I will add it in.

minecraftsuggestions,ff1ge3z,t1_ff1ewyi,1579478810.0,That does sound pretty reasonable imo.
minecraftsuggestions,ff1eb1e,t1_ff1dl3z,1579478103.0,"You do have a good point, but I'd still rather leather, chain, and gold to have some good use instead of being useless once you get iron and diamond armor."
minecraftsuggestions,ff18rhj,t3_eqwxa3,1579476380.0,"Does this occur only when wearing the full set of the weak armor? Does this also occur if you're wearing, for example diamond boots and everything else is chainmail?

&#x200B;

I do think that giving weaker armours some advantages over strong armors is a good idea."
minecraftsuggestions,ff17i8h,t3_eqya9n,1579476040.0,Wow this is a really fitting idea! I really like the design of the Queen Bee too.
