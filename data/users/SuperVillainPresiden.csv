There are the Mongolian ants that just take over the next ant colony. Their queen kills and takes the pheromones of that queen so now all of those ants follow that queen. They have a concept of jail. The moment they gain hyper intelligence is the day they take over.

Not all people who do bad things are bad people. Sometimes we screw up, badly, and sometimes we go through a stint in life where we are assholes for a while.

ADHD,fdkr7yw,t3_elws7f,1578509470.0,"I went into the military at 18. The one thing I recommend most is waiting until you are at least 20 to join. Live and learn about the world before joining. Otherwise you could end up learning about the world while you're in and not be able to do anything about it, because you're in a contract(so to speak). Understanding the world will make your time in the military a lot easier and being 21 will help a lot since you can go and drink with your superiors. Also, don't go into the military if you don't want to travel. If you have a gf, fiance, or wife you could end up 1) moving around the US or abroad and 2) you could end up deployed for 3 months - 2 years, so they may get stuck behind.
