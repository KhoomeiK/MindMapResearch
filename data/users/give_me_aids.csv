jakeandamir,fddk2xh,t3_ekopft,1578315360.0,"Hey Jake and Amir! I can’t tell you how much I love all the content you guys put out. I’ve recently been going through all the NADDPOD episodes in order after hearing the episode Amir went on and it’s become my new obsession. 

Anywho, my question is this: I’m a fourth year male in college and one of my friends recently got evicted from their apartment and for the past 3-4 weeks he’s been living at my place. I thought by the time Christmas break was over he would have a new place, but he’s sleeping in my room as we squeak with no plans of moving out or even getting a job! I want to tell him he’s got X amount of days to get all his shit out of my 1 bedroom, but I also don’t want to force him out if he’s got nowhere to go. Before he started staying here he was sleeping in his car, which fucking sucks especially during a Canadian winter. How do I get my apartment back without making my friend homeless? Any advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: come do a show in Nova Scotia! You guys can crash with me"

Before that I was doing a 4 step process morning and night for maybe a few years straight. I would agree that most people could clear it up with something like this but getting rid of my acne was my #1 priority and it took years to notice any improvement.
