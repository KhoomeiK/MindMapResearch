antiMLM,fcyv07j,t3_eji7n4,1578087670.0,"I’m sorry, but this complete thread is based off of wild speculation and an inherit bias against all mlms. You hate mlms and have molded a single parcel on a porch to the worst possible scenario. 

I’m not defending the company or mlms, but all of this conjecture is absurd. 


“Talking to the neighbor, it sounds like the wife miscarried twins last year and had a breakdown.”

We’re getting personal information (rumors) from a neighbor. 

“I imagine a doterra hun took advantage when she was vulnerable”

You are imaging the worst possible scenario. MAYBE that’s what happened, but you don’t know. Maybe she was involved way before. 

Maybe she was just a customer and occasionally bought items. Perhaps this parcel was a gift from someone because of what she was going through. 

“I have to guess that this was a contributing factor to them losing the house.”

That’s a pretty wild guess.  The wife could have lost her full time salaried job after the mental breakdown, they could have gotten into a terrible mortgage, they could have just stop paying and ran away from their troubles here. You have no fucking idea of anything involving this families personal and financial situation. 

The fact everyone is piling on that the worst scenario is the factual is crazy. Use some logic and stop jumping to conclusions to fit your narrative that mlms are the central cause of this family’s problems."
