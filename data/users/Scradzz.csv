Glad to hear you made it to the other side of the thoughts whatever it may be that saved you.

If you ever need a chat ill be around üòÅ"
depression,fds8ng1,t1_fds7i1g,1578696861.0,"If you actually want me to i can, however i haven‚Äôt yet"
depression,fds6oxv,t1_fds5hbp,1578695576.0,"Thats fine, talking to someone might, your other posts looked trollish esp with your name too,.. lol"
depression,fds6lnm,t1_fds5hbp,1578695518.0,"You brought the negative, I‚Äôm sorry that i said your post about how music annoys you was in the wrong place, considering the OP was saying music was their savior basically."
depression,fds5afq,t1_fds4iji,1578694672.0,"I offered too but you wanted to keep being negative bud, cant say i didn‚Äôt try. Please point out where i made fun of you btw."
depression,fds496i,t1_fdpvwfn,1578694039.0,"Hey to you and the few above me, i still have depression, i used to have huge anxiety/panic disorders,
Part of me getting over it was me giving up and thinking well fuck go on finally do it then, go on, kill me, thats right ya cant ya fucking bastard, dont get me wrong i still have the depression side of it too and its very draining but we can get through it üòÅ

EDIT... after reading a lot more

Wanna know why you have the obsession with someone else doing it for you? In an alley or wherever?

Thats because you know and you do know you have too much to live for and too many people would miss you and hurt, I‚Äôve been there before myself and didn‚Äôt do it for those reasons thinking of those people."
depression,fds2cms,t1_fds186i,1578693231.0,"What for though? Only reason i told you to leave it alone here was this guy was saying they wanted to end it all if it wasn‚Äôt for music and then you say music is annoying to you, I‚Äôve offered to talk to you if thats how you feel too.

EDIT...

Looks like your a bit of a troll judging by other posts too, so you can kindly fuck off and maybe get some help because you probably need it ;) love ya"
depression,fds13ow,t1_fds0svc,1578692666.0,"Your all good mate, if it was a positive post of yours and i was responding it would have been completely different."
depression,fdrzjh0,t1_fdrx2gu,1578692064.0,"You weren‚Äôt picked on or hated, if you weren‚Äôt negative on their post you wouldn‚Äôt have negative feedback, even from there i offered to chat with you as I‚Äôve been there too where everything is negative man. 

Just think if it was your first post and you were feeling really shitty and the first thing you got back was a very negative comment, how would that make you feel? 

Still got no probs having a chat and I‚Äôm happy to open up first."
depression,fdrwz54,t1_fdrw3vb,1578690947.0,"Considering the post was about them enjoying music and struggling without it, then you come along having nothing but negative comments about the situation and nothing constructive then i would say my opinion is spot on but sure, go on, prove me wrong."
depression,fdrvu7r,t1_fdrqob3,1578690500.0,"Tbh, you picked the wrong spot to say what you did and got called out, if you dont like it, move along."
depression,fdrq4fd,t1_fdrjwya,1578688065.0,"Completely different to what i said, you just chose the wrong place to say what you did how you did, im open to have a chat with you if you feel like you want to talk though"
depression,fdrjnfs,t1_fdrhybr,1578685460.0,"Considering its in a depression post where they are saying the only thing they look forward to is music, No worries mate. Head back into the cave you came from. You wont be missed."
depression_help,fdrhxpl,t1_fdr02b0,1578684714.0,"Very well said, I agree with everything and love the last paragraph so much!

Legend"
depression_help,fdrh7hx,t3_emrryb,1578684520.0,"Mate ive been in similar instances, not to the same extent, but seriously just reach out to your dad and i guarantee he will be with you for the whole ride of the rest of his life with you, listen to some good music, have some beers and talk about it. Yeah its fucking hard but it will make everything easier. Hes potentially had similar experiences in his life he can pull from too. 

Yes ive been where you are and did the same thing as im recommending, no dad didnt have the issues i/you did but he helped a lot, i live abroad and we still talk weekly/fortnightly now."
depression_help,fdrflq0,t3_emkn00,1578683836.0,"I completely understand you man, i have a bunch of friends where i used to live, i only talk to one back home now but he‚Äôs been through similar things we have so can understand. 
Its very tough to make new friends and have them understand too so dont have very many here either...
I also feel like my partner doesn‚Äôt understand me even though she days she had anxiety and panic attacks.. it can be very hard to express yourself sometimes and sometimes we cant even describe it when its happening or afterwards if wed just like to forget it.

Happy to talk in a dm if you feel like it"
depression,fdrcvvf,t1_fdqn9hw,1578682656.0,"Fair enough, but i guess i come from the same place as them, and as i continue to go through hard times i enjoy the fuck out of music, even if i am in that space and it makes me feel something.. means the artists been through rough times too and I‚Äôm feeling what they have been through the music, sometimes it can be empowering, sometimes it can be sad hopefully we can find some mood changing music because life keeps on ticking on regardless."
depression,fdqlt6l,t1_fdpvbmn,1578669732.0,"Real talk dont use alcohol to try drown your issues as a teenager. This is coming from an alcoholic that did the same thing and im now 28 nearly 29 and drink too much every day. Not worth it. I was introduced early and realized it helped fix it for the time being. But thats it.. a short term fix. Til you become addicted and it becomes a problem and an expensive one at that, also its not a fix its a band aid."
depression,fdqinl9,t1_fdpzgug,1578667608.0,Please suck a dick. Not the right place to be writing that.
