Coronavirus,fgl8jvv,t1_fgkutda,1580885864.0,"I'm obese and have a 130 day supply of multivitamins (at one a day). But I also have about three weeks worth of food (some MREs, some camping rations, and about 24 cans of chef Boyardee which is a surprisingly tasty emergency food at 400 calories apiece).

I have gloves but the basic surgical masks (I know, not very effective) are on backorder. I bought some benzalkonium chloride hand wipes (400 of them) which will last a few months.

I am no prepper.  I bought the MREs when I was bored months ago, the gloves for painting and 3d printing. But they're repurposed now!

I should get a gun safe next."
Coronavirus,fgl7qlp,t1_fgkr6w5,1580884968.0,"Personally I'd feel that the impact it had on respiratory health, even if minor, is an unacceptable risk until this thing is over. Smoking even one cigarette does damage, stops the cilia in the bronchial tubes from working, lowers the immune response to inhaled pathogens.

I'd take edibles but I've been told that the effect is protracted over like 12 hours and takes hours to take effect. That's unacceptable."
Coronavirus,fgl7fpf,t3_ez1fjy,1580884646.0,Our own people just cancelled flights to an upcoming trade show in California.
Coronavirus,fgl5xe3,t1_fgkt3vt,1580883107.0,"They don't release them until they have two negatives if I remember correctly. And the hospital is swarming with it so I imagine that they're just stuck there. 

Maybe. the CCP dictates override any doctor saying 'ok you're fine'. Like 'if you release them without two negative results we will shoot you.'"
Coronavirus,fgl5nz2,t1_fgkx9dj,1580882852.0,"Two of our cases in my Canadian province are in home isolation which tells me it's pretty mild but that the number of exposed is massive.... Which wouldn't surprise me as it's either mild until it really isn't or it stays mild..

At least that's my read on it."

Coronavirus,fgk2wxo,t1_fgjwcyk,1580856370.0,Not at all but it might make it less lethal in developed nations.

Coronavirus,fgk16hq,t3_eyyct9,1580855377.0,"Depends if the mutations cycle the parts that antibodies connect to. Flu has this, a cycling mix and match that creates new versions of old strains every year.

If the virus caused that much pneumonia, a concerted worldwide effort to eradicate it would probably isolate it. Hopefully."

Coronavirus,fgjrsop,t3_eyx01b,1580850131.0,The reason I posted this is that the hardest hit area in China is also one of the smoggiest places on earth and no doubt that plays a factor in disease severity.

Coronavirus,fghwxkc,t1_fghekcg,1580796430.0,Tshtf?
Coronavirus,fghwati,t1_fghm680,1580795834.0,"Right. Plus the criteria for recovered depends upon country. China might be an overabundance of caution. Canada might test someone who is still coughing and they're not shedding virions and say 'yup' and maybe China is 'well they're still coughing so they're here forever' (especially if they are trying to keep order by keeping coughing people off the street)

I mean, who the fuck knows? Canada released 3/4. Germany released none of those autoworkers. Even though origin guy was apparently fine.

Unless the criteria is indentical there's no way to be sure of the recovery rate."

But anyhow, I think the reason they make this bloc with their identity, this hive mind, is because maybe a lot of these people don't have shit all else gong for them and low self esteem (probably originating from family issues - maybe not feeling accepted) so they make their entire life about their cause.
