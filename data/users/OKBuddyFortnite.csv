whowouldwin,fghk5v4,t1_fgg20hv,1580786656.0,"That is really impressive for sure, but we’re talking about universal level characters, so I don’t think that matters much comparatively. It’s a good feat of stamina though, another stat Superman beats Goku in."
whowouldwin,fghjokz,t1_fggt6yd,1580786341.0,"I mean the scale from what we usually see from superman isn't super consistent, but I don't think the authors accidentally did this, as he has previously done this before, and shows feats similar to this a decent amount. I think it's on you at this point to prove why he wouldn't be this fast, as I can keep giving feats whereas your just going off of head cannon.

In DBZ, Goku was planet busting level back when he fought Raditz. The 40 ton feat is from after the Cell saga. Goku's physical strength (as ki blasts and physical strength are seperate)is at least planetary during the Namek saga. Goku has to be 10s of 1000s times stronger, in base, by the start of DBS. Yes, this ant-feat is similar to superman's yet-to-be-shown anti-feats.

If you power scale, Goku is at least universal in base, the saiyans are shown to be regular saiyans, round about Saiyan saga Vegeta level. Goku was confident that potaro fused Vegito with ssj2 stacked wasn't enough to beat Beerus, so much so that he didn't try. This confirms that ssj red Goku is stronger then ssj2 vegito from Buu saga, and seeing as red was then absorbed into his base. 

tl;dr How on Earth would Kaulifa even come anywhere close? There fusion certainly wouldn't be as strong as buu saga vegito and vegito ssj2 is weaker then Goku red."
whowouldwin,fgglhkg,t1_fggl2ra,1580764350.0,How about when Goku was in base being at solar system in base but wasn’t able to lift 40 tons? That’s just off the top of my head. I can probably find tons more. Or when fused Kale and caulifa was somehow beating base Goku?
whowouldwin,fggkri5,t1_fggeb37,1580763917.0,"It would be ridiculous to say that a humans travel speed is equal to a jet, because the humans are in the jet. You’d say the jets travel speed is supersonic not the human’s. What part of the jet is biologically human? 

Pointless anyway because the feat I gave shows he’s able to fight at the speed he’s travelling at"
whowouldwin,fggk4ry,t1_fgg5xdq,1580763541.0,"Him losing would just mean that the people who beat him are stronger, but yes, there are feats that don’t make sense. But that’s also the same with most characters in DBZ. What’s the point in bringing that up if it’s equally true for the villains of DBZ & DBS?"
whowouldwin,fgfkbcd,t1_fgfi47x,1580741061.0,"There isn’t any reason to say his combat speed would be any slower then his travel speed. You know that even if Goku is 10000x the speed of light, that doesn’t touch Supes. It’s ridiculous how vast the gap is in speed, which that alone is enough imo.

Edit: Just found out he once flew through the entire universe, destroying missiles (so yes, his combat speed must be on par with his travel speed) before a single human heartbeat. That’s 1.87 sexdecillion times the speed of light. That’s casually millions times faster then Whis, this isn’t a fair fight."

whowouldwin,fgfd2to,t3_ey1n7m,1580734987.0,The problem most of these characters have is their lacking speed. Superman doesn’t have impressive strength feats but he crossed his entire universe in some ridiculous time like 10 minutes. This is faster then what Whis uses to get to and from Earth.

ClickerHeroes,fg5cfch,t3_ewtorv,1580523807.0,"So theres two calculators you should always use.

[The first one](https://kepow.org/clickerheroes/) is used for ascensions. For this, you go into settings, save your game, open the file and copy it into the calculator. Just do exactly as it says and you'll go up faster then ever.

[The second one](https://driej.github.io/Clicker-Heroes-Outsiders/) is used for transcendence. Exactly the same as the first except you'll get an option under where you paste your game file that asks you what build you use. I recommend either hybrid or active as this is by far the best way to progress but if you just go on the game once a day for 5 minutes to collect offline earnings, use idle.

These calculators work indefinitely as far as I know. The only problem is that the game begins to feel like a chore using calculators however, if you don't use them, good luck completing the game within the next 10 years (legitimately)."
