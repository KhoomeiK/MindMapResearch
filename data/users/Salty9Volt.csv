I think he'd rather have 60% of what he wants versus maintaining status quo. I think with Bernie (which is smart) is he starts at level 10 (so to speak) with negotiating. Whereas most Democrats start out at a level 6. But he'd be happy with a level 7 or 8 in the end, if that makes sense."

If the USMCA was going to be a close vote, he may have voted for it.
