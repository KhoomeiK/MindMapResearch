depression,ff9rlxh,t1_ff7uaa6,1579719601.0,"Sounds like a toxic friendship. But, to begin the process of actually receiving help for depression, you DO need to decide you actually want to be better. Hopefully that’s what she meant, but it’s a long shot"
depression,ff6vpmk,t1_ff6kkbc,1579635855.0,You wouldn’t be my friend. Trust me. And ps I only recently became the legal age to drink so yeah. Good luck to you
depression,ff4zkzm,t3_eri464,1579576277.0,"Honestly if you want tonight to be your last day feel free to let it be, but it should be for something reasonable, like terminal illness, or complete financial collapse. To me, it seems like one of the core reasons you’re unable to cope right now is that you “gave everything to someone, and they spat it in your face”. If you’re severely depressed and suicidal over someone external that you’re unable to control, I don’t think it really makes zero sense to kill yourself. Life is long and people come and go. Even family and friends are temporary, why choose to leave over just one? I was considering death for a while as a solution to my anguish. The only reason I don’t at this point is because after suicide attempts, hospitalization, therapy, and medications not doing anything, I’m really more frustrated than suicidal. I’m alive to spite depression’s attempt to kill me. I offer you this, throwaway account"
depression,ff4yey9,t3_erh5kr,1579575447.0,I’m glad you’re grateful/thankful to them. You must be in a good place. I wish the EMTs and police never interfered and “saved” my life. I wish i was already dead
depression,ff4xzib,t1_ff3yb94,1579575151.0,Where do you get LSD?
depression,ff4xv6n,t3_erfmu2,1579575066.0,Where do you get shrooms?
depression,feyeui4,t1_fex2ixe,1579444531.0,"Right? I don’t think there’s really any solid counterpoint to not wanting to put up with life. Unfortunately, the default answer is that you’re not thinking clearly or lazy."
depression,feyd6xv,t1_fewv2o9,1579444015.0,"Yeah the problem here is that I really do want to spend what might possibly be my last and only life bitter and alone. It probably is the right thing to do enjoy life, but I’m not going to."
depression,fek8rce,t3_eoxun3,1579194968.0,"Then stay depressed, life is overrated imo"
depression,fe66x1u,t3_env9a0,1578883151.0,"I kinda feel the same. But as much as I hate it, I still do it. If I had my way, I’d probably just sit in a dark room doing basically nothing for the rest of my life, but I don’t think that’s a healthy mindset. Kinda grateful I don’t have a choice sometimes. Other times I just wanna kill myself. So I just assume when I really hate working, it’s probably just an increase in depression/anxiety."
r4rNYC,fe667w0,t3_ek7cis,1578882702.0,Damn figure that most girls would assume y’all would kidnap and trafficking would be easy from then
r4rNYC,fe6584r,t3_ek7cis,1578882057.0,Honestly how do any guys think this will actually work?
depression,fe63kwc,t1_fe5ogev,1578881009.0,"I wish I had faith like you do. But I don’t. Praying, attending church, keeping my heart open and looking for signs, none of it works for me. I’ll keep trying, but depression and Catholicism are just so difficult. I don’t want to try and cut you down, but if there’s a God, he most definitely has abandoned us already."
depression,fe62px3,t1_fe5vbug,1578880452.0,"But doesn’t it make you a bit sad that God, who loves us, who knows what ails us, doesn’t just put us all out of our misery?"
depression,fe5su5y,t3_eno7v3,1578874183.0,"It sounds like your religious relatives are invalidating your experience of depression. They try to offer something they really buy into, expecting it to “cure”, when there are other things that need to factored in to treat it. Sounds pretty frustrating. I don’t know if you’re religious or not, but either way, I hope things get better for you."
depression,fe5se0k,t1_fe5moc4,1578873909.0,"No one is or ever will be 100% good. If you believe in an omniscient, omnipotent, and all-loving God, then he does at very least allow us all to suffer greatly throughout the course of our lives."
LucidDreaming,fdp7l7f,t1_f9svsos,1578621863.0,No
depression,fdp7k1i,t1_f9t02k8,1578621841.0,It sounds like you’re experiencing dissociation  and depression.
LucidDreaming,fdp790p,t1_f9wdhhh,1578621639.0,No not really
depression,f9svjuf,t3_e6no4y,1575601601.0,Yeah. I feel like I kinda just exist and people don’t think I do. And no one would ever rely on me really for anything.
