*Don't do it* is good advice. 

*Go for it* is good advice. 

Every situation is different. Some employers prohibit it. Some frown on it. Some don't give a rat's ass. 

One AP invited me out for drinks and flat out told me that she wanted to fuck me, so that was easy. We were friendly before that, and friendlier after. I wish they were all like that. 

The others took some time. One had a similar sense of humor (meaning crude) so we'd joke around all the time about sex, then the hints started dropping both ways. We went to lunch one time, and she told me that if I wasn't already married, she'd be all over me. That was the last hint I needed. 

The other didn't work at the same place as me, but we bought/sold stuff to each other every day. Calls became less about business and more about flirting, then I'd find every excuse to drop by and see her in person. When things couldn't possibly go any further without getting romantic, I made my move and asked her if she was attracted. She said yes, then I asked what we were going to do about it. She said she'd think about it, then she sent me a note a little later saying we couldn't go any farther. We did."
