I was going right back to my room anyway so there was no need for me to take it to wash a bowl. It was a coincidence that my mom happened to also be in the kitchen so it took longer since I stopped to talk to her. He wasn’t worried at all, just curious as to whether she had changed her mind about staying home. It took less than 5 minutes"
insaneparents,ffr5jtf,t1_ffr5b6w,1580150922.0,"Yea, I did. I told him that before he spammed me. I was talking to my mom and washing my dish when he spammed me. I told him she was home after I got back from doing so. I didn’t take my phone with me to do that"

insaneparents,ffqvbel,t3_eupjmx,1580144459.0,I may delete this post soon since I think I impulsively posted this when I was still super annoyed and it doesn’t really feel like it belongs here anymore.
insaneparents,ffqv3k1,t1_ffquu4v,1580144318.0,He didn’t care about how she was doing. He only cared about whether her car was still at home.
insaneparents,ffqtuyv,t1_ffqt6ch,1580143516.0,"He is often like that with not only my mom, but me and my brother as well. He will sometimes get mad if I go somewhere and don’t tell him. All three of us think he is very creepy for doing it. My mom stopped using Life360 because he was using it to spy on us. My mom always knows where me or my brother is because she’s the one who is home more often and he works longer hours. He never asked about how she was doing. He only wanted to know if her car was there. I actually went and checked on my mom yo see how she was before telling him she was indeed home."
insaneparents,ffqtapt,t1_ffqss32,1580143150.0,He’s not abusive but he is definitely controlling at least to me and my brother. He’s very set in his ways and has a very superior attitude at times. My mom has made it clear that she agrees with him and yes’s him to death because it’s just easier
insaneparents,ffqt26p,t1_ffqsq4i,1580142994.0,"I was about to get up anyway and honestly I’ve been getting tired of his expectation that I have to immediately drop everything the second he wants me to do something. 

I probably should have just done it but I don’t exactly have the best temper in the morning and he went from 0-100 in one text"
insaneparents,ffqsnhk,t1_ffqs4q5,1580142726.0,He doesn’t usually lose it like this. My mother usually pacifies him when he gets pissed because me or my brother don’t comply the millisecond he asks us to do something.
insaneparents,ffqsh89,t1_ffqrtvo,1580142610.0,"My dad didn’t care about how she was doing. Only about whether or not she was home. He knew she was staying home today. I was about to get up anyway. 

Other than that I would have looked. I actually went and checked on my mom, sort of coincidentally because she was making herself coffee or tea, before I told him she was home. That’s when he spammed me. I have a long week of classes and like to get as much rest as I can before I have to get up. I wouldn’t have posted this if he wanted to know how she was doing/feeling"
insaneparents,ffqr2nk,t1_ffqqsi2,1580141673.0,Honestly it’s because I’m tired of my dad’s attitude of “shut up and comply robot”. My mom is too if I’m being honest. I could have looked earlier but I just didn’t see the need to
insaneparents,ffqqxlj,t1_ffqqg0z,1580141577.0,"That’s awful, I’m sorry. 

I saw her after and asked how she was doing. She has migraines every so often and sometimes are bad enough she stays home, not sure if it’s chronic or not, so I didn’t think much of it. Also, he didn’t ask me if she was ok and didn’t really seem to care. He just wanted to know if she had decided to go to work"
insaneparents,ffqqmye,t1_ffqq88b,1580141376.0,"My mother is, obviously, an adult. He shouldn’t get so worked up about whether or not she was still home. He shouldn’t have a problem with waiting a few minutes for me to get up. I told him I would just not at that moment. I am also an adult. He started to spam me right after I told him I would in a few minutes. There was not reason for this escalation. I didn’t say “no” I just said “hold on I will in a few minutes”."
insaneparents,ffqq61k,t1_ffqq09s,1580141059.0,"I’m 22 and have a long week of classes. I was about to get up anyway due to the fact that it was 10. 

Edit: if it was only because he didn’t want me to be lazy then I wouldn’t have posted it here. Even though I still feel that’s a bit insane."
insaneparents,ffqpj53,t1_ffqpevt,1580140630.0,"If he wanted to know how she was doing, then yes and I probably would’ve gotten up a little sooner. But he only wanted to know if she was home, not how she was feeling"
insaneparents,ffqp70o,t1_ffqoxc1,1580140399.0,"It was 10 am and she was awake. And my mom is really good at answering texts and I told him I would look when I got out of bed which would’ve been witching the next half hour anyway. Also, my mother is a grown adult.

Edit: he only wanted to know if she had randomly decided to go to work, not if she was ok"
insaneparents,ffqp0xq,t1_ffqosxo,1580140283.0,"That’s what I thought! The irony is, my mom will always answer a text while my dad won’t answer and will sometimes claim he didn’t see one"
insaneparents,ffqopfs,t3_eupjmx,1580140065.0,"¡Explanation. 
Normally I wouldn’t post anything here but this was so over the top I just had to. The screenshot is from the near end of the conversation right before I actually answered him. My mother stayed home from work with a migraine today. My dad texted me asking if she had decided to go to work after all. I really don’t know why he didn’t just text her. I told him at least three times that I would answer him when I got up out of bed which honestly wouldn’t have been much longer after that. He started to spazz out spamming me. I then got up and went to see how my mom was doing and to get ready for my day. She was up and would’ve seen it if she had texted. I then responded to my dad saying that she was home and awake. He then proceeded to try and lecture me over text and said the classic “I’m done!” I wasn’t able to have the last few texts he sent in the screenshot.

Edit: he’s still texting me know and completely oblivious as to why my answer was basically “whatever” after his mini rant. The rant was after I had said that my mom was indeed home

Edit 2: I forgot to mention, I told him she was indeed home immediately after his last text but it doesn’t fit in the screenshot

Edit 3: Those texts were sent while I was actively talking to my mom and cleaning my bowl so I didn’t see them until I got back to my phone"
tvtropes,ffm15wg,t1_ffm0dn0,1580046848.0,That makes sense. Although I don't know why some shows now will do it since it's fairly easy to find older episodes.
tvtropes,fflr7j0,t3_eu3vqq,1580043106.0,"I’m starting to hate the “getting crap past the radar” lists. They’ve started becoming people purposefully taking things out of context, misreading into things, and/or twisting something innocent into a sexual innuendo

Just because someone said the word “balls” due to seeing a bunch of sports balls does not make it an innuendo"
tvtropes,fflqtky,t1_ffkv4c9,1580042938.0,"The Harsher in Hindsight sometimes is full of things like “the twin towers were seen in the background of a scene in New York in this show shot in the 90s”. I get it, but why list things that are in the background and not even a big part of a scene.
