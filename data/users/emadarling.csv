You are doing your job, which is to protect your child."
raisedbynarcissists,ffffwbr,t3_et3wd6,1579883080.0,Noone should have to go through this. I'm glad you're doing well.
JUSTNOMIL,ffemog5,t3_esxnmk,1579854730.0,"Everything you wrote is more than reasonable. If your SO is on your page, he can also step with transgressions such as kissing the baby, smoking, hogging...in and you can keep repeating ""please don't"", ""thank you, we've got it covered"", ""thank you, we will consider it but we've got our own way of doing things""...
If you feel it is becoming to much, leave. Good luck!"
JUSTNOMIL,ffd53qh,t3_esx9qg,1579813593.0,She is being an asshole and victim blaming.
JUSTNOMIL,ffctp71,t3_esjv7e,1579807055.0,They probably think that your wife needs to earn the privilege of being considered family which usually translates to popping out a few kids...
offmychest,ffcnchq,t3_esvnft,1579803120.0,"Maybe it means that you are a good listener. People often want to be heard and are in return met with people who don't shut up about their own thing. Or it could mean that you are able to converse about a wide variety of topics. Whatever you're going, keep doing it."
JUSTNOMIL,ffcmeqb,t3_esuq34,1579802542.0,"Make a checklist of the behavior that is not appreciated, including but not limited to comments about your appearance, questioning your logic on the wedding prep, behavior towards you and each other, etc. Send it to both of them and tell them you are reaching a breaking point and that they should either grow the fuck up and behave like adults or that they will be experiencing your wedding via photos once you send it to them."
offmychest,ffc8gjs,t3_esstm6,1579793934.0,It's a weird hill that your BIL' s gf decided to die in (no pun intended). Sounds like someone that does not stand any criticism...
offmychest,ffc4hq8,t3_esni40,1579791317.0,I'm sorry you are going through this. Whether we like it or not we are being judged daily. I hope you find happiness that you deserve.
JUSTNOMIL,ffbjshf,t3_esjaqd,1579768642.0,"Yeah, your mum is shitting on her own parenting skills. Her job is to help build your into a confident adult and she is not doing that..."
JUSTNOMIL,ffbjpyl,t3_esm8hd,1579768543.0,You owe it to yourself to run and not look back. Your mum failed as a parent and she will likely be pissed that she is losing her Dobby. Tough luck! Don't let anyone tell you that your first priority should be someone else. You need to take care of you first and foremost. I doubt from what you've written that your mum has your best interests at heart.
JUSTNOMIL,ffbiysm,t3_esntcs,1579767493.0,"""MIL, you're not helping, I can't deal with this subject any more. I need positive thoughts in my life. This subject is seriously depressing me and I'm kindly asking you to not bring it up again."""
JUSTNOMIL,ff8ilfc,t3_ertypr,1579680153.0,"Once you deliver, you absolutely must be around people that are 100% supportive. Postpartum depression is no joke. Even with the best of support it is often difficult. You certainly don’t want anyone criticizing you when you’re just getting to know your child. You will probably be doubting yourself in this period anyhow, you don't want anyone building on your doubts... Have your boyfriend read some of the articles on the topic. It's important that the two of you are on the same page."

JUSTNOMIL,ff2i3hn,t3_er76dn,1579507102.0,The whole bunch sound awful...
JUSTNOMIL,fetvdwk,t3_eqfsh9,1579380442.0,Ask her how many countries there are in Europe. What is the capital of Albania. What she thinks of Basque... she is obviously an agile out to humiliate you. You might as well return the favor.
raisedbynarcissists,feschn6,t3_eqdlat,1579363829.0,Maybe she's baking it wrong...
offmychest,fesbfw4,t3_eqb1y5,1579363498.0,True revenge will come when you no longer care what she thinks.
raisedbynarcissists,ferr609,t3_eqd7vo,1579357403.0,She sounds like a special kind of asshole...
JUSTNOMIL,femx6z1,t3_epwzh0,1579271947.0,"It all depends on your bf... If you are on the same page, you will be fine... Move away and lessen your contact with her... If however he still has a soft spot for her, let me illustrate a possible future: you guys move out, she gets kicked out of her house because of debt, she cries to her son and the next thing you know you are living together. Or... You have kids and he lets her cross boundaries... 
So.... Read the posts in this subreddit and wisen up. Determine now, before you are fully committed, whether your guy's spine is all shiny because he is the one that has to cut the cord with her, otherwise you will always have the crazy in your life. 
Good luck!"

insaneparents,fel2gil,t3_epp042,1579212616.0,I'm sorry you're having to deal with this.
JUSTNOMIL,fel2bat,t3_epm142,1579212526.0,You can't control whether she resents you or not. But you sure as hell should not let anyone walk all over you and this is something that you can control. So it's good that this confrontation is about to happen as it will signal to her that it is not ok for her to disrespect you. Also your BF should have said something immediately.
HomeworkHelp,fekvoyt,t3_ephgon,1579208566.0,"Since you like politics.. It is now 30 years since the fall of Berlin Wall, 30 years since the fall of communist regime in several Iron curtain countries including Romania, where it's dictator and his wife were summarily executed on Christmas 1989.

JUSTNOMIL,fekdnou,t3_epkfb4,1579197860.0,You are not helping her by serving her. And your parents are met helping her. They are enabling her. You worked hard for the things you have. Point her in the direction of a bank loan and tell her to finance her own car. It's one thing giving a ride to your sister once in a while but you shouldn't be obligated to do it. Each of you spent money on what you deemed worthy. She travelled. What more does she want?
JUSTNOMIL,fekb7ax,t3_epk5oo,1579196406.0,"Just ask her to stop, it's just weird... But as a thought.. Does she do that only when your wife is around or all the time?"

JUSTNOMIL,fe8kv89,t3_enwfc9,1578927302.0,Consider the fact that he views her behavior as normal because that is what he's always known. It might take a lot of time for him to come out of the fog. Start with little steps. The good news is that they live hour and a half away so this might give him some space from her and he might start getting out of the fog.

Also I think you may have a bigger problem than your MIL... and it's your husband. He is the one that should be seeing boundaries.
Also, fuck her for undermining your confidence when you had just given birth. 
Next time tell her to just stop. Get your kid onesie that says ""my mum doesn't need your fucking advice"". Just tell her that you are managing everything and you've got everything under control. You are not there to debate your parenting skills, it's not up for discussion."
