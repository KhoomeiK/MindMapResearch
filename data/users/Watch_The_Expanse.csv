I have three questions:
• 1) Can I use my VP40 LE receiver to shoot my VP40-Tactical and VP9-Tactical? This will safe space in my range bag. 

Answer = 'Yes for VP40 and VP40T not recommended for VP9..'

• 2) There are no differences between the VP-Tactical versions and the VP-LE versions, correct? Besides the threaded barrel. So, I could use the VP40-FDE-LE frame with my VP40-Tactical? 

Answer= 'Correct, only differences is the threaded barrel.'

• 3) The VP-Tactical models are suppressor ready, correct? 

Answer = 'correct.'

• The magazines fit in the receiver of both calibers.
• The slides appear to operate when swapping the .40 and 9mm slides with their counterparts receiver.
• I own a VP40-FDE-LE, VP9-FDE-LE, VP40-Tactical, and VP9-Tactical."""

He could have used this book to have Skippy discover himself in a way that the MBOP could investigate ir discover with him, some sort of story, like any other boom would. But, no, we got a bullet point list and no explanation as to how he gained access to his memories. It was cheap, lazy, and I say this as a massive fan of his. I have two of his autographed books. Craig really needs help with his storytelling. It's very weak and his outlining is the only thing he has going for him, and he got lucky with that."

We got the wall up on top of our knees, and I told the team to get under it, and lift it to our shoulders. The extra gravity was killing me. 

""Then he says 'you save five children from a burning building, and when you walk down the street, do people say there goes MacDougal, the rescuer’? No, they don't.""

 ""Valdez, will you shut up a minute? All right, people, lift!"" I said in my best US Army voice of authority. We got that bitch of a wall unit up above our shoulders, and were winning the fight against gravity, when Valdez gasped

 ""'Then MacDougal says, ‘but you fuck one sheep’-."" 

We lost it. Men scattered as the wall unit came crashing down, and people were rolling on the ground laughing. I tried to bark an order, but I was laughing so hard that a snot bubble came out of my nose, and when people saw that, they fell over laughing again.
