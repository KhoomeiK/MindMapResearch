RandomActsOfGaming,ffbp0xv,t3_esngn4,1579776533.0,"One of my favorite games of all time is Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. It was the first 3d GTA game that I played and it blew my mind. It was unlike any sandbox game that I have played before. The 80s Miami setting was gorgeous with all the nice references to pop culture of that period. The scarface mansion, Tubbs as Mr Lance Vance Dance etc. Fantastic main story aside, I spent months exploring every nook and cranny of the two islands, finding every hidden package, doing all the extra taxi, vigilante missions, collecting the damn cars for sunshine auto etc trying to explore everything this game has to offer. There were so many cool radio stations playing 80s hits and the talk shows were hilarious. For me it was the ultimate life simulator that provided me with a form of escapism whenever I was stressed.

College was a utopia where everyone was free to pursue their aspirations (protests, join societies etc). Its also a collaborative environment where you meet great people and they will help you out. You get to plan how you spend your own days without restrictions. In short: freedom.
