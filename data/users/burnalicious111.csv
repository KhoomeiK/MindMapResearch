I'm usually able to kill a good amount of people with Orisa, and don't usually get gold damage. I will also use her gun to do things like get a Widow to move away from her perch. And I do particularly love to use Fortify to intercept a charging Rein and shoot in his face.

But I'm not sure I'd be able to explain why I'm having that experience and you're not. You're also faaaar from the only person who has complained about this with Orisa (including my partner). So my curiosity has been growing for a while. Thanks for explaining!"

Overwatch,fekv5s5,t1_fekonsp,1579208251.0,"Fully agree. Overwatch has done a terrible job on educating its player base on how to play the kind of game it is.

However, this only works for the ""extremely online"" sorts of players who will look up additional resources outside of the game in order to improve their play (or just observe streams/pro play). The others don't learn key concepts about how to successfully play characters like Reinhardt, which makes them not fun to play!

Overwatch,fekurhf,t1_fekg9rb,1579208017.0,"Yeah, the #1 thing they need to do is add more tanks.

AskReddit,feia1ti,t1_fehrktz,1579133655.0,"I don't think anyone can just ""get over it"". But I do think people can make choices that affect how their brain responds to situations. That's kind of what the focus of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is about, and it's helped me with depression a lot.

Depressed brains tell us a lot of distorted views. ""Nobody wants to be around me,"" ""they didn't respond to my text because they hate me,"" and so on. CBT involves helping you identify thoughts that might not be based in facts, and presenting a different narrative to replace it with. It sounds kind of silly, but it makes a difference.

FWIW, ""there's nothing I can do about my situation"" is one of those distorted views. It's called learned helplessness. It makes sense that after a long time of trying and failing to control your feelings it'd feel like there's no options to deal with your depression; but what if there are options that you just haven't tried that do work (that don't involve just trying to will your brain into a particular emotional state)?"

AskReddit,fei9cb4,t1_feh8kar,1579133190.0,"Anger happens when we expect something should be different than the way it is, and when that difference threatens us. Sometimes when we suppress it, it can become misdirected -- erupting at something that wasn't the original cause because we can't hold it in any longer. Also, sometimes anger can happen for what feels like ""no particular reason,"" but there actually is a reason that's just hard for us to identify. I eventually learned I can get angry when someone speaks to me out of nowhere while I'm trying to focus partially because I have ADHD and it's very, very difficult and effortful to maintain my focus, and I feel upset when I lose that precious resource. But before that I thought I was just getting mad at them for speaking to me, for some reason.

FWIW therapy should be able to help you identify what causes your anger."
AskReddit,fei8zdc,t1_fehvlqv,1579132953.0,"I explain recovering from depression as learning to walk again. Your motivation and satisfaction muscles have atrophied. They can't carry you much of anywhere. You can push yourself for a bit trying to seem ""normal"", but eventually you'll collapse -- you're going to be hurting and even more tired.

Just like with a muscle, the way to help it recover is to slowly and gradually exercise your brain more each day. Can you normally not get out of bed, but you can manage to get into the shower today! Congratulations, that's progress, and that's enough! You don't even need perfectly upward progress, either. People hit plateaus, or backslide, or just plain need rest sometimes. As long as you can do one small thing to exercise your mental health more than you could before, it's a step towards getting better, and it's wonderful.

You just can't cure depression all at once. Your brain kind of has to re-learn how to access the healthier thoughts, feelings, and behaviors gradually, with practice. You may know how you ""should"" be but that doesn't mean your brain is ready to do all of that at once."
