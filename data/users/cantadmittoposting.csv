One of the hardest parts about the last few years is *just how much* the sides aren't the same. Our brains aren't trained to accept that one group could be so outlandishly bad, so good people naturally seek balancing issues to make the world make sense.

Sure... Hunter's resume almost *certainly* got a boost because his last name was ""Biden"" - absolutely, he was privileged and perhaps that's not ""fair"" for any number of reasons. But ""privilege"" is not inherently, and certainly not in comparison to the current GOP, also ""corrupt,"" and there's no evidence that Hunter was performing any corrupt acts.

The surprisingly hard to accept truth is that the American right wing is being run like an organized crime outfit with the apparent goal of seizing and maintaining political power by whatever means necessary, and anybody to the left of that goal is a candle in broad daylight compared to that threat"
politics,ffxn1u9,t1_ffxjqbb,1580328462.0,The problem is that the only media that is not obviously biased already has taken a [view from nowhere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_nowhere) strategy which is absurdly dangerous in situations like this.
politics,ffxmwxw,t1_ffxb7zd,1580328384.0,"CNN reports as a ""View from Nowhere"" organization which intentionally avoids weighing the validity of sources.

It's a cancer on modern news reporting. (thanks Nate silver!)"
politics,ffxmsva,t1_ffx6bdw,1580328317.0,"CNN, despite being aggressively ""centrist"" most of the time, mentions that the accusations against Biden are baseless or false every time they put it in a story."

Parnas can spill everything about what Trump & Co. do and head on home to his own crew with no problems."
politics,ffxkm9t,t1_ffxgk83,1580327051.0,"The US passed a law allowing certain international lawsuits, theoretically, allowing US citizens to sue Saudi Arabia regarding 9/11.

Obama pointed out this would allow citizens of other countries to also sue the US for similar reasons, and vetoed the bill because it was stupid.

McConnell's Senate overrode the veto, and when they suddenly realized a day later what they'd done, *immediately* blamed Obama for ""not engaging with them sooner"" even though the veto provided precisely the reasoning needed to avoid doing something stupid.

See here, for example: https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/29/politics/obama-911-veto-congressional-concerns/index.html"
politics,ffx761h,t1_ffwreo4,1580319167.0,Like that time Obama's clear explanation of why he veto'd something... Wasn't clear enough for McConnell
