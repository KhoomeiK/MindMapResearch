Kink is a way for many people to deal with their emotional issues. As someone who has been a sex worker, I can assure you that many people's kinks are not born out of healthy mental states. Not to mention the many people who let kink take over their lives. It's not healthy to base your lifestyle around sex in any capacity.  That is a sign of mental illness."

todayilearned,ffbyvud,t1_ffbbxpo,1579787116.0,"""do you drink a lot of coffee?""

"" no, I spill most of it"""
todayilearned,ffbf633,t1_ffbejxw,1579762631.0,"The fact that you ignored the emotionally broken part is very telling. Also, the fact that you said ""mostly normal and overweight people"" tells me that you might have different standards than many people."
science,ffbf0od,t1_ffbesd5,1579762452.0,"Oh. Good. So if i check back, there will be even more deleted comments. What a great sub..."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffbey7x,t1_ffb31or,1579762372.0,It's the same reason you can't just order a medium coffee at Starbucks. Everything has a stupid unnecessary name.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffbevj7,t1_ffaz14k,1579762283.0,Are you actually from the midwest or the south or are you just making a generalization? Because I've never seen anything like this in the midwest or the south.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffbetgk,t1_ffb4nbb,1579762217.0,Let me just squeeze by.
science,ffbciv7,t1_ffbani2,1579759643.0,"Also, there are still a ton of personal anecdotes in the comments. So what's the point of deleting some of them and not others?"
science,ffbcalj,t1_ffb50wn,1579759393.0,"The white hairs could be sebaceous filaments and could indicate a mite infestation or another parasite. I had the same thing and now they're gone. Wash it with baking soda then put lavender or tea tree oil mixed with walnut oil on it for a week and see if it disappears. If so, get tested for pinworms. If it's mites, wash your blankets and throw away your makeup and continue to treat your body with baking soda and oil."
science,ffbbz3e,t1_ffbb625,1579759055.0,There is no good way to morally obtain a control group for the experiment if done on humans. Especially considering that stress and its effects on people are relative concepts.
politics,ff9zb05,t1_femhfz0,1579724711.0,"Uh...no. I do not agree that casually discussing a hit on a few people, even if they have a fancy title, is in any way worse or even comparable to the amount of suffering that war causes and has historically caused. In fact, the idea that anyone would even say that physically repulses me."
videos,ff7xigu,t1_ff7k488,1579660705.0,People lie sometimes. Look at what happened with Emmet Till.
politics,fem7sqp,t1_fekxhsx,1579242850.0,Nixon made a deal under the table which made the Vietnam war last longer.  I'd say that's pretty bad.
videos,fekwe9m,t1_fej9azg,1579208984.0,I've got five dollars on the fact that you've never read any of that research yourself. I'll bet five more dollars on the fact that you don't even know the sample size in those studies and probably can't tell me if their results imply causation or correlation when taking socioeconomic factors into account.
politics,fekvxnr,t1_fekv19a,1579208710.0,It's been happening in the USA for our entire history. Trump is just dumb and trashy and not used to being around poor people. It's totally acceptable as long as nobody acknowledges it.
politics,fekvq4v,t1_fekuqje,1579208586.0,I hate Trump but Nixon was easily just as bad. And let's not forget Dick Cheney. He might as well have been the president considering the control he had on Bush.
videos,fej5qm5,t1_fej58vw,1579157981.0,It's a terrible idea. Hormones control every function in your body.
news,fei2u8a,t1_fehankk,1579129053.0,You can see a list of all the people who visited him in jail in 2011. There are a lot of celebrities on that list.

facepalm,fe0iw7h,t1_fe0bwyu,1578814104.0,Probably.  This sub doesn't seem to understand that they're not the only people with a sense of humor. Or that not everyone's sense of humor hinges on pointing out other people's percieved flaws. Self deprecating jokes are often seen as accidental admitions of idiocy.
AskReddit,fe0dpio,t1_fe05wpd,1578811072.0,You're really buckling down on this and it's weird. Some men play games and some don't. Men and women aren't as different as we'd like to think. I've had long conversations with men about the games they play when they're interested. It's not a big deal. You don't speak for everyone. You don't sound like an expert on sociology or psychology but I could be wrong. It's okay to be wrong sometimes.

cringepics,fdhmyqm,t1_fdhjnxg,1578426068.0,"Maybe if there was a draft, we'd think twice about going to war over stupid shit."
cringepics,fdhmvjs,t1_fdh63m1,1578426014.0,I would like to preemptively thank you for your service.
madlads,fctpfwn,t1_fct8wg1,1577952821.0,"Of all the awful people in the world who have Twitter accounts, you'd destroy PETA?"
AskReddit,fbhabxn,t1_fb8za1p,1576868963.0,I used to do that and then I found out not every guy likes that and that dicks are just as complex as vaginas. Just communicate and find out what works best.
