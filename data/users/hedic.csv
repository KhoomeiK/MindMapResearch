WinStupidPrizes,fghz98m,t1_fghynsd,1580798741.0,See now you are being racist because you know they are culturally the same as the mean and yet you still use a race/culture stereotype. This particular example is funny to me though because I have been called racist trying to explain how people from China without the same strict laws are shitty drivers by American standards. In this case one is a good safe driver the other is meh.

UpliftingNews,fghy686,t1_fghxs00,1580797653.0,I'm not being mean. I'm just frustrated and disappointed that you are trying to turn this into an argument. Sure they are living creatures but I wasn't calling for a pogrom I'm just saying don't encourage harmful invasive species out of a false sense of fuzziness. Supporting feral cats isn't just saving cats its also decimating any small game population around.
WinStupidPrizes,fghxppm,t1_fghxegd,1580797197.0,It's not splitting hairs at all. I have multiple coworkers that are genetically Chinese but pure fucking Americans.

WinStupidPrizes,fghwhf1,t1_fghrohg,1580796002.0,It's not actually. It's calling out a cultural issue not a racial one. This is a common mistake. The problem is we don't have good vocabulary to differentiate between the culture and its predominant race. So people confuse insulting the culture with insulting the race.
WinStupidPrizes,fghwax7,t1_fghl09y,1580795837.0,Any sub singling out one race whether positively or negatively will eventually become racist.
