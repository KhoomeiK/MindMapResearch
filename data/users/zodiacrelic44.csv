WranglerTJ,ffjptwy,t1_ffjfp84,1580003915.0,Black plasti-dip works wonders. I bought a used sahara flare and moulding kit for my 06 Sport that were in pretty poor shape but was a deal I couldn't refuse. Plasti-dipped them and they came out great.
WranglerTJ,ffjpgde,t3_etyg6s,1580003663.0,Another thing to consider would be what seems to be called a tummy tuck. It raises the height of the transfer case and everything decreasing your likelihood of bottoming out. I had been thinking about doing this on my own 06 TJ

windsorontario,ff7yiph,t1_ff7hhph,1579661400.0,Depends who you know. I have a job I can walk on to anytime in the small town. I can't find a job here that pays well enough to be worthwhile.
windsorontario,ff77dgh,t1_ff6htye,1579642574.0,Key word: cities.

Most cops aren't actually bad people. What a concept!"
windsorontario,ff609n3,t1_ff605k8,1579615787.0,I have to move back home. Go to a college closer to where my parents live and commute. The key words to what you've said is similar size. Where I'm moving is SIGNIFICANTLY smaller.
relationship_advice,ff5zs26,t1_ff5zq0n,1579615392.0,Okay? They don't know that unless you tell them.
windsorontario,ff5zqm8,t1_ff5yrf8,1579615360.0,"I'm not even in downtown Windsor. I'm in sandwich. Still getting forced out. This will be my last year here. I can't afford tuition on top of rent, food, gas, and everything else."

That's a pretty crappy excuse."
relationship_advice,ff5z1wk,t3_ero31m,1579614803.0,Your neighbor took it very well and seems grateful that you reached out and tried to apologize for getting the porter. You two are still friends! Everything seems fine. You were definitely in the right to want the party quieted down.

If you're doing a heart transplant, why stay with a 4.0? Or even a stroker kit?

WranglerTJ,fenme9x,t1_fengdhb,1579287792.0,"I thought you had to have an adapter for the lug pattern to put those wheels on a TJ? But yes, even a 31 may require some adjustment to the steering lock depending on the backspacing of the wheels. Also OP remember that if you're not on 31s/32s already then you may want to change your speedo gear so that your speedometer and odometer remain accurate"
WranglerTJ,fe3fyzo,t1_fdlcp8n,1578848931.0,Alright... I can't seem to find it on quadratec or anything like that... Sorry man

insaneparents,fdvwmfs,t1_fdvvwv1,1578752503.0,"Agreed. In her real family, she probably was. But her kidnapped family siblings (CPS and police should investigate to make sure they're all not kidnapped kiddos) I mean. They didn't ask for their ""mother"" to be a degen. It's not their fault. You can't hold them accountable for their ""mother's"" actions"
insaneparents,fdvvr2h,t1_fdvt01n,1578752119.0,She should at least love her siblings. They didn't ask for their mother to be a degenerate. They likely didn't know any different.

WranglerTJ,fdj6pe9,t3_elk21m,1578459980.0,I don't know about this... But I have a rack on my TJ that has brackets that go on the windshield hinges and bolt in behind the tail lights in the rear... Might be something else to consider.
relationship_advice,fdgw2up,t1_fdgvuxe,1578409763.0,It doesn't. But it could explain why  mom is afraid to say something.
WranglerTJ,fdek95r,t3_ekvvzt,1578340805.0,Wish I could have this. I get like 3 weeks of top down weather and then it becomes hard top season again.

insaneparents,fcr9n25,t1_fcqr61n,1577898782.0,"Again. Depends where you are. Because I know for a fact that a nursing home is significantly cheaper where I live. If you live in an area where nurses and/or doctors are in excess, sure, I could see it being cheaper. But where I live, nurses and doctors are in EXTREMELY high demand. Half my town doesn't have a family doctor. There's two here for the whole county. One hospital, that doesn't even have enough nurses to run by itself. You want a full time care nurse here? You're gonna have to ship them in from the city, which isn't cheap at all because of the distance from everything."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fcnvm8n,t1_fcnkgey,1577819324.0,Did it get up?
insaneparents,fcn25wy,t1_fcmwiio,1577801143.0,"That depends on where you are. Where I live, a full time nurse will charge the same daily as a cheap nursing home does monthly."
WranglerTJ,fcf8grn,t1_fceyzus,1577627523.0,"Everyone's been telling me to bed line the floor of my 06 daily and ditch the factory carpet and everything... This is something I've worried about after helping a friend bedline the back of his Ranger. If you're using it as an off road vehicle only, it may not be such a big deal... But for me, I feel like bedline would make the jeep way less comfortable to ride in"
windsorontario,fc9wflk,t3_egmzwl,1577559196.0,Blue collar. Hard-working. No-nonsense. A little depressing sometimes.
