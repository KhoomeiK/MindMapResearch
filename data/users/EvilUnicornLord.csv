characterdrawing,fe92gwt,t1_fe7ewo1,1578933435.0,"I wouldn't say *most* historians say they're ornamental. In Rome, muscle cuirass was typically worn by high-ranking captains and generals and stuff so a lot of it was never struck and also very-ornamented (despite popular depiction, Roman footsoldiers usually didn't have metal chestplates). It was fairly common among the Greeks, however.

I suppose it is worth mentioning that fantasy muscle cuirass is often more fancifully ""toned"" than irl muscle cuirass. The metal muscles in most Greek muscle cuirass aren't nearly as obvious as they are in some fantasy depictions of the armor.

And one last fun fact about Greek armor is that not all of it was muscle cuirass and scale mail. Look up the ""dendra panoply"" for a lesser-known example of Greek armor."

Although I suppose I should elaborate that animals aren't *just* eating one thing every day for the rest of their lives and that they're very opportunistic.

Like most predators eat the organs of their prey while we tend to only eat the muscle meat. And herbivores aren't entirely herbivores. She did say her cat only lived off of tuna but it might have hunted critters here and there, or stolen food off the table when she wasn't looking, or went through life entirely on a diet of tuna and was just lucky enough to not have any notable health problems."

characterdrawing,fe793gx,t3_eo25zq,1578911635.0,"Everyone claims that the red armor design (sometimes called ""boobplate"") is extremely unrealistic and downright detrimental for a female adventurer to wear. 
They say that it'll break your sternum and send blows directly into the center of your chest.

But, in reality, it's not that different from muscle cuirass which was historically used by the Greeks and was suitable protection. 
So long as it's custom-fit to the wearer and the cleavage isn't digging into the user's chest, boobplate should definitely work as armor.
It's an inferior design to a peaked chestplate, but it's far from worthless."

DungeonsAndDragons,fcph625,t3_eifbq8,1577863853.0,"Souls mimics are one of the most terrifying depictions of mimics. 

Everyone knows about the mimic that hops across the floor, the one with spider legs, the one that pulled itself along with its tongue, and the one that hovers off the ground with giant bat wings. But when's the last time you've seen a toothy chest stand up on two gangly legs and do a flying backwards roundhouse kick into your face? Or the other variant that walks belly-up on all fours and spits acid at you?

The only mimic encounter that ever topped that was the one that sprinted circles around the room shooting dozens of magic lasers in every direction the moment we opened it. It turned a tabletop RPG into a bullet hell for a few rounds and downed the paladin."

Plus, I really don't know *how* you see me sitting here writing paragraphs on my beliefs and then you say that I'm being slippery on theology. At this point, I'm tired, I hate arguing about religion (especially on Reddit) and I don't even know why I started.

The Mountain Meadows massacre was the result of a group of Utah militia who acted independent from the church aside involvement from some local leaders, disguised as native Americans and attacked a wagon train and then returned again to murder the witnesses as they feared they had been recognized. The church excommunicated them and condemned the incident as it is: a horrific tragedy.
Despite any accusations, the current prophet (who, if I recall correctly was Brigham Young) didn't command them to attack anyone, the militia commander acted on his own."

dndmemes,fcl71lr,t1_fcl142o,1577741197.0,"In the 18th century, church leaders received revelation to practice polygamy. Joseph Smith was wed to many women but evidence that he had any children with any but Emma, his first wife, has been mostly debunked due to genetic testing. He was not the only person to practice polygamy during this time and many members took up another wife. After some time, the practice was ceased and is now condemned.

This is something of a peculiar topic in the church (we discussed this a lot in Sunday School) mostly because, although the saints had been given revelation to practice polygamy, they hadn't been informed why.
My personal opinion (don't take this as doctrine, this is just what I could glean from church history and history of the era) is that this was enacted to support the single women in the church since, back then, women in the U.S. were very reliant on their husbands to support the household since it was very difficult for them to get jobs, own land, etc. And there were more women than men in the church at that time. They were commanded to stop at about when that ratio evened out, probably so people wouldn't go around building their own harems.

As for the military history of the church, the early saints were heavily prosecuted for their beliefs, in fact, the Missouri Executive order made it legal to actively hunt and kill Mormons (it was issued as a threat to drive them out of the state moreso than an actual ""hunt and destroy"" order) and it wasn't repealed until just a few decades ago.
Many other states in the South likewise shunned the church (mostly due to their stance as abolitionists) and the Mormon pioneers suffered many mobs seeking to drive them out as they journeyed to Utah.
It should come as no surprise that many of the early figures in the church's history were very ""rough"" due to the constant persecution of their faith.

You might say I'm foolish for not believing stories set to condemn the Mormon faith, but they have a very poor reputation. From the Salamander letter to modern misinformation testifying that we have horns growing out of our heads, well... I think it's fair to be skeptical.

And, yes, I have a testimony of God, Jesus, the Holy Ghost, that Joseph Smith met an angel and translated the plates, all that jazz.
I also believe in the scriptures which state to not ""cast pearls among swine""."

dndmemes,fcks4el,t1_fckhtj9,1577731999.0,"Current Mormon here.

It sounds like you just misread deep doctrine because we don't believe that at all. Whether or not experts argue that we can be defined as Christian or not doesn't really matter. We believe in God the father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost if that clears anything.

There is some deep doctrine concerning man being able to be elevated to God but it's way more complicated than that and, despite over 20 years raised in the church, I don't even understand it fully. 
It's called deep doctrine because it's like the triganometry of gospel, you need to know the gospel arithmetic and gospel algebra and all that first to even get it. Plus, it's not nearly as important as it sounds (not sure if important is the right word).

And Christ does atone for your sins, but that doesn't mean you get a free pass to heaven no matter what you do, the plan of salvation created by God in the beginning (in a very simplified manner) means after death you either go to spirit paradise or spirit prison (similar to heaven and hell) and those in spirit paradise will teach the gospel and the atonement to those in spirit prison. After some time, everyone will be sent to one of the three degrees of glory, those being the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial kingdoms with some *very* few exceptions being cast into outer darkness. (And keep in mind that's a very simplified version of the plan of salvation not covering the premortal existence)

And, as someone who has held a temple recommend and has gone into multiple temples to perform ordinances such as baptisms and ordination for the dead (no, we don't baptize corpses, it's a proxy thing), you're making it sound like a cult with secret inner circles and stuff. Which it's not. There are certain holy ordinances which can only be held by those with the priesthood such as the sealing of families to remain together for all eternity, however.

I have a strong testimony that the plan of salvation is indeed accurate. I've prayed with an open heart and a contrite spirit and felt confirmation from the Holy Ghost that the church is true and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and that we have true prophets today."
