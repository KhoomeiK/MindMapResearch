boxoffice,fh7kf5d,t1_fh3zx49,1581335949.0,They did a lot better than that. They are the reason the numbers today are even what they are. Those films were the starting point. And yes it did build up well. All of the films weaving into one another and constantly becoming better films every batch that came out. It was a perfect progression.
boxoffice,fh7k9sl,t1_fh45ym0,1581335770.0,"I think that Superman has to always be the embodiment of hope. Snyder’s Superman was a distraught alien that had an identity crisis. He should’ve been way over that by even his second appearance in BvsS. But he continued to be that way even through Justice League. Maybe until the very end of that film. He needs to always be a beam of strength and light. I don’t think Man of Steel was bad, it definitely gave us fights like we’ve never been able to see before for SM, but he just didn’t act and feel like SM should."
boxoffice,fh2nhdq,t3_f17ls7,1581258360.0,"They failed because they tried to cash in on the success of the MCU without any build up. The MCU was very carefully planned and crafted. They jumped right into BvsS and Justice League without even giving us some time to explore the characters. I personally love Wonder Woman, I thought Aquaman was entertaining, and Birds of Prey was really great and unique. DC should just stick to solo film properties without any connection. Joker was phenomenal. I think they should keep moving away from a connected universe and come back to it one day in the far future when they reboot it all and then set up a proper Justice League universe."
aww,fh1pxdl,t3_f0zyks,1581220787.0,It’s me
boxoffice,fgzs468,t3_f0tdkz,1581197114.0,It’s a great film that might have legs once word gets out how fun and entertaining it is. A definite passion project much in the vein of Deadpool. I’m excited to see more of the future from this film and Margot.
boxoffice,fgzrj9r,t1_fgyfjuo,1581196912.0,There was a bunch of R content. And I definitely feel it added to the film. Especially the final battle scene.
funny,fgv9vqy,t1_fgucufo,1581141752.0,But do they know WHO they are doing?

Fitness,fglot14,t1_fgjdohp,1580906687.0,"I have a compressed cushion disk at the base of my spine and if I go days of working out without stretching after, I’m a complete mess. Pain and difficulty moving. Stretching IS crucial. Especially if you already have injuries or ailments you’re living with. Also if we don’t stretch then as we get older, everything tightens to the point where you can barely move in old age. I don’t ever want to be one of those hunched over elderly people that can barely move on their own."

StarWars,fglju7w,t1_fgkipvx,1580901338.0,Cassian Andor is getting a series. It’s been announced since last year.
Marvel,fggoajx,t1_fggifbh,1580766008.0,"Stature is Antman’s daughter. Kate Bishop is in Hawkeye. And the twins and Hulkling are all rumored. So yes, the Young Avengers are more than likely coming. Not sure where this “alluding” has occurred you’re talking about."
boxoffice,fgfos1e,t1_fgf5c6j,1580744195.0,"The international audience loves this series. I personally don’t. The US bo is fine, but international numbers are ridiculous. So we have everyone else out there to thank for this...lol"

motivation,ff91880,t3_es9qai,1579702287.0,"Teaching your kids to have ethics and be good people and make the right choices is one thing, but you should always be supportive of your child being who they were meant to be. Whether it's being gay, playing a sport they want to play or doing an activity they want to do (not what you want them to do), and grow into a career they want to (not one you choose for them)."
marvelstudios,ff90s75,t1_ff8s173,1579701944.0,She's a killer so she's supposed to be lol. In the comics she can be borderline psycho.

television,femm8l9,t1_femlx43,1579262300.0,"The setting, feel, and story of the show did not feel like Watchmen. I don’t know what more to say. The show was not that appealing to me. It’s not like some sort of argument here. It’s my opinion so move on."

television,feml7s8,t1_fele3hz,1579261064.0,I struggled getting into it too. It just didn’t feel like Watchmen to me.
television,feml5xq,t3_epotfk,1579260998.0,"With as much as I love Watchmen, this show just didn’t feel like Watchmen to me. I wasn’t really excited to watch each episode, although I do think they were well done. I’d say give someone else with a new vision and story a shot at this."
boxoffice,feknizh,t1_fehjy4n,1579203743.0,I agree on that. David was so complex and well-done.

boxoffice,fehe5hi,t3_ep36re,1579114686.0,"I nominate Michael Fassbender. He's 42, fit, great actor, and could pull off a different type of sophisticated Bond swagger, but still manly. Not to mention very easy on the eyes lol."
marvelstudios,feglvkf,t1_fegfy27,1579096756.0,"Everyone you named did embody the character whether 100% true to the comic or not, especially in look. Put Cheadle next to Rhodey in the comics and it just doesn’t match up."
marvelstudios,feglopg,t1_feghwwk,1579096604.0,"I don’t mind Howard. I wasn’t super impressed with him in IM, but i think he could’ve grown with the role. I kinda wish we had someone else though besides Howard or Cheadle."
marvelstudios,feglj4q,t1_fegf99p,1579096482.0,"I think they’re both good actors, I just don’t love how Cheadle plays the role. Something about him doesn’t fit. I do think he’s a little old. They should’ve cast someone bigger and more imposing. It’s also the way the character is written. He probably shouldn’t have been written with anything comedic."
marvelstudios,fegcsv8,t3_ep0a0f,1579087987.0,"I never really loved Cheadle’s War Machine. I feel like someone else could’ve played the role better. Unfortunately he comes off a little cheesy at times. I will say though, the scene with him and Nebula, relating how their bodies have changed, was really good."

boxoffice,fedcgw5,t1_fecmvvw,1579007541.0,Then Widow.
boxoffice,fed5ebm,t3_eoa8c5,1578999724.0,"I think he’s a great writer and director. That being said, too many, including myself, don’t agree with some of the choices he made in TLJ. I think they need to start fresh. Let Rian make his original films, but take him off SW. I think there’s too much bad blood out there at this point when it comes to his name and SW. They need to start fresh and give someone else a shot at this. If they put him on another SW film, the backlash will never end."
movies,fe9q2ro,t1_fe87fjw,1578940426.0,Wow. It must be such a “horrible movie” to have almost made 1 billion at the box office. Which is insane for a drama film. People loved it. I thought it was fantastic and his performance was amazing. Both films are great. Don’t be so extreme.
