PoliticalHumor,ff42qti,t3_eresuq,1579554268.0,"Legally hunting big game is realistically the ethically the right thing to do. These (legal) hunts are offered by the conservatorship. These hunts promote conservation of endangered species by providing some of the funds (the cost of the hunt) needed to run the conversation. Also the animals being hunted are particular animals that have become a detriment to the rest of a population. One anecdote is of an alpha male rhino (at least I think it was a rhino) who was no longer mating with the females, but none of the younger males could dethrone him i.e. he was a detriment to the cause, and allowed to be hunted. So the big game photo isn't the best choice for proving your point.
