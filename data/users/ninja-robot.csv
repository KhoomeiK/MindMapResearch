startrek,ffcgy8s,t1_ffcg2k2,1579799235.0,A changeling tried to pull the plan off but there is no question that Dukat knew. His involvement with the creation of the plan is debatable but he played his part in it knowingly.

startrek,ffazhmg,t1_ff99v2v,1579748092.0,"The fact that the Starfleet wasn't supposed to be militarized is one of the strangest aspects of the Star Trek universe to me. Every group the Federation borders is militant or else probably already in the process of joining. How are you supposed to not have a military when you border the genocidal Klingons, fascist Cardassians, and imperialist Romulans. The only plausible reason I can see for them to not have been conquered already is that they are massive compared to their neighbors so the small percentage of Federation citizens that join Starfleet can match the huge percentage of the various other species that are part of their military forces, it makes sense seeing as the other groups all appear to be dominated by a single species while the Federation notably has at least a half dozen major species and over a hundred minor species as members."
neoliberal,ffatv5y,t1_ffal8ds,1579744365.0,It is known to the people who care about such but most don't care. I imagine if you were to do a poll you would easily find less than 30% of the public was aware and a good number of the people who have heard it either don't care or approve of it as they love Reagan and will support anything any major Republican candidate has done or would do.

neoliberal,ff554xo,t1_ff3ycfw,1579580510.0,At this point this information just goes on top of the mountain of proven examples of institutional racism files. The question has never been does racial bias exist it has always been how much can the racist get away with before someone calls them out on it and anyone who says differently is either extremely ignorant or trying to increase the amount of horribleness they can get away with.

AskReddit,ff0ptmy,t3_equ586,1579471169.0,"I would pay off my college loans, buy a house or condo, furnish the place, and buy a car. This probably wouldn't equal the amount of money he earned but it would lower his bank account as that money isn't going into his bank it represents an increasing net worth mostly due to the amount of Amazon stock he owned and its increasing value. It isn't liquid and isn't represented by the amount of money in his bank, so realistically unless its a pay period his bank statement probably doesn't increase on any given day even if his net worth does."
AskReddit,feves3o,t1_feroc37,1579396524.0,Ah man that brings me back to high school when I was really into Cybernations. Its like Nationstates and a lot of the people in nationstates actually moved over and formed groups there and we had big wars and all kinds of crazy shit.
todayilearned,fev77nz,t1_feug9kb,1579393946.0,"Yep, bananas are actually a good argument for evolution since natural bananas are huge ugly things full of seeds but man changed them over the generations to fit their needs better.

StarWars,fej3xee,t1_feisc2d,1579155971.0,"It would make sense that Luke went his father's family and Leia was taken in by her mother's. Additionally the two planets Vader would want to visit least would be Tattoine and Naboo as they are full of painful memories. Plus it would add more weight to the destruction of Alderaan if we actually gave a crap about it having seen it. Instead we have Naboo being basically the same, a peaceful blue green planet with a monarchy, that never appears again anyway."

Even I start to get comfortable enough with the cold during the winter that I can walk around without a second layer of pants and only a medium jacket in 30 degree weather. I wouldn't walk a mile like that but to and from the car or across the street no problem."
StarWars,fef0g87,t1_feb8hux,1579045274.0,I would have changed Dooku from a sith to a legit grey jedi who got played by Sidious. He would form the Confederacy of Independent Systems because of very valid concerns regarding both the Jedi and the Republic alongside General Grevious who would be introduced in Episode II and allowed to show off how badass he was at some point instead of just appearing as the Episode III villain.
DMAcademy,fee8hmq,t3_eojqpx,1579028574.0,"I like to give my guards advantage if they are within 5ft of another guard. Similar to how hobgoblins get extra damage.

dndmemes,fdqps7y,t1_fdqo2r2,1578672257.0,It would be if it wasn't for their being free property nearly everywhere in d&d. Having the local government sign over the rights to an abandoned ruin that was recently occupied by bugbears if the adventurers request it is hardly significant incentivation since to the town it is a valueless ruin. Same is true for an unused chunk of land outside town. Plus as adventurers these benefits nearly always follow completely some town saving quest so they are mostly a form of payment.
dndmemes,fdqmtwd,t1_fdqkpfb,1578670397.0,Unless a government subsidies the adventurers or does something to incentives them it isn't trickle down. Rich people spending money isn't trickle down economics it's just having an economy.
dndmemes,fdqhj10,t1_fdq4era,1578666816.0,"I don't know about your groups but every group I've been in had at least one person who wanted to build or restore a mansion or castle at some point. That means hiring construction workers, sourcing material, and a long term on site staff. Specialist from bigger cities will have to be brought in but the simpler stuff will be done by locals. And knowing how a lot of adventurers treat money everyone is getting highly payed for this work."
dndmemes,fdqgqov,t1_fdpukfq,1578666255.0,"Not really, in this scenario the government isn't giving anyone money but rather the adventurers are bringing in outside money. In fact it might cause pretty bad inflation depending on how it works out."
dndmemes,fdptotd,t1_fdpqlet,1578640067.0,If I was a town mayor I would happily give a group of midlevel adventurers some property around town. Mostly because in 5-10 levels they are going to have an excess of cash and will happily spend absurd amounts of money building a mansion or castle there which will create lots of high paying jobs.
MapPorn,fdmjipo,t3_em1k9k,1578552203.0,"Romeo's greatness was more than its size but also its endurance and lasting cultural legacy. Multiple languages today are derived from Latin. Rulers of other great empires titles themselves after the old leaders of Rome calling themselves Tsar or Kaiser. Even today we use the latin languages regularly in the fields of law and science. 

The mongols came like a wave but didn't last long. They didn't spread their religion, culture, or language across the world and in the areas they ruled the longest they often became just another dynasty in a long list as they adapted to the native culture. This isn't to say they did nothing but their cultural legacy is far less than Rome's despite their greater size."
neoliberal,fdm27x1,t3_elyoo1,1578538061.0,"Is this a reference to something? I think Biden is fine but he is hardly historic (unless you mean his age) and while I will vote for him should he win the nomination I don't care for him overly much. Mostly it is because he doesn't seem to realize how politics has changed since he first entered the game and despite having a front row seat for the Obama administration he still appears to believe that republicans can be negotiated with. His drug opinions are also out of date as well. 

Again this is in comparison to the other dem nominees, in a Biden v Trump election I'll be backing Biden 100% but if we are talking Biden v Pete or even Biden v Warren I have a tougher choice to make. He still beats out Bernie however."
neoliberal,fdm1iu3,t1_fdlj8jp,1578537592.0,Honestly if you want the most unity your best choice is probably Warren. While some on this sub don't like her for a variety of good and bad reasons she at least gives solid (if debatable) reasoning for her ideas which should make the moderates at least accept her as being reasonable (or at least able to be reasoned with) while also being progressive enough in appearance (I say appearance because all the major Dem candidates are running on fairly progressive platforms with just a difference in rhetoric and a perceived willingness to actually put those ideas into practice) to win over the majority of Bernie supporters.

Stellaris,fdboozk,t1_fdbhezi,1578259578.0,Games are released for more than $60 all the time they are just called special editions and have $2 plastic figure included or some in-game exclusives. Additionally their are far more people buying games now than ever before. We see plenty of games making money on just sales cost alone and I see no reason to believe that increasing the cost of games would do anything to help those who actually make the games or reduce the infection of micro transactions.

todayilearned,fcyouct,t1_fcygmf3,1578084085.0,I doubt the cars will be the same size as modern cars. Why build a car with lots of storage space and seats for 5 when it is a self driving car for 1-2 people. Thus you get self driving Van's that act as mini busses and transport multiple people on their commutes and tiny cars which transports a single person. The van probably still cost but it transports a lot of people a day and the small car is cheap as it is designed to be.

I agree that the Red Dead series needs to move on from the Dutch van der Linde Gang and focus on other stories, settings, and characters. I really enjoyed Redemption 2 but I fear that all the games being called Red Dead Redemption kinda of forces the stories to be about redemption while there are a lot of other stories to tell in the west that don't follow the same kind of character arcs."
