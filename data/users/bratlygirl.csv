DarwinAwards,ffe376u,t3_et2stq,1579835512.0,I don’t think that killed either one of them.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffdg0rc,t3_et05iu,1579820099.0,Don’t have a party with a bunch of kids. Dork!
AmItheAsshole,ffbi4tz,t3_esjef0,1579766368.0,My parents made me and my boyfriend sit on the porch until someone was home. Yes we had sex but it was much harder sneaking around.
PublicFreakout,ffaoxpl,t3_esblb2,1579741069.0,Did I hear her say there are 9 days in the week? I guess her check is going to be bigger than usual.
lastimages,ffaoeyd,t3_esc8o1,1579740717.0,I wonder what has happened  emotionally and mentally to the sets of twins that don’t like each other? I believe I have read about two girls and one either killed the other or tried to have her killed.
AmItheAsshole,ffannwc,t3_esfxc0,1579740209.0,NTA I guarantee you when he does find someone he likes or wants he will be paying a lot more than minimum wage. He doesn’t care about you or he would reward you for being the only one he trusts. Run from that job and don’t feel guilty.
AmItheAsshole,felc9l8,t1_felauo6,1579218798.0,I agree! And she doesn’t even like the stepmother. She could split the mo ru up and make a big difference to many different charities.
WatchPeopleDieInside,feknns7,t3_epmlyi,1579203823.0,He’s so darn cute I’d give him whatever he wanted.
AmItheAsshole,fekmzhn,t3_epmdeh,1579203420.0,"NTA please don’t cave in. I work for a large non profit and believe me, $13,000.00 would be welcome to any organization. If everyone thought like that we couldn’t fulfill our mission. I agree she is a greedy little thing and buying a house isn’t helping like charity it’s just making her life better."
shittyfoodporn,fejs8rx,t3_ep5fpt,1579184577.0,I think payday is this week for everyone on this sub.

PublicFreakout,fejr8ez,t3_eph6cm,1579183838.0,We need more people like the dog walker in this world.
AmItheAsshole,fejr2ps,t3_epbfgz,1579183721.0,"Maybe he had something to offer you, such as friendship and companionship as you grow older. Please update us."
AmItheAsshole,fef448n,t3_eoojak,1579047722.0,Your husband is delusional.
news,febwjsm,t1_fe9f7cz,1578963521.0,Do you know of any companies that can clean up someone from the internet? Essentially any record or negative news stories?
offmychest,febtc7u,t3_eoczhp,1578962466.0,"Literally say “ I. Another note... sometimes when my dad touches me I get a weird, strange, possibly sexual feeling. His family has a history of sexual abuse. Could I be paranoid or could I be repressing thoughts of this happening? That is how you approach the subject. I have heard of cases where a parent dies and the remaining parent transfers feelings to the child. It could be something."
offmychest,febs250,t3_eoczhp,1578962025.0,See a therapist. Trust your gut.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fe5ka1l,t3_enr5t4,1578870463.0,I’m sure this trick was funny on their first date. I’m with her.
shittyfoodporn,fe3ltx8,t3_enp3s1,1578850487.0,Cute!
offmychest,fe2kjg4,t3_enknog,1578839528.0,"This exact thing happened to a sweet girl and didn’t end well. Look up Kelsey Smith. Such a sad situation. When I was younger I was followed home by a creepy guy behind me in a grocery store. I would never have known but he was in a loud souped up truck. I called 911 and they told me to drive straight to the police station, which was out of the way and he still followed me. The police followed me home and watched me shut garage door. I was newly divorced and after time I realized this horrible incident was a blessing because it taught me to have my guard up. I see you are also learning there are bad people out there."
AmItheAsshole,fdqytof,t3_empvgk,1578676984.0,She’s been okay with it for 11 years?
offmychest,fdp58wp,t3_emjggj,1578620297.0,I’m curious why you didn’t take plan B?
offmychest,fdp4s97,t3_emj6iu,1578619988.0,"It was a tragic thing that happened to you and I’m sure it will take a lot of time to process and understand. Eventually you will be able to give yourself a little pat on the back because the timing of everything meant his life was saved. The fact you saw a very young child try to kill himself right in front of you is something you will never feel good about. I’m sure you reached out because you saw him move or sensed he was going to jump and it was instinct kicking in. You should talk to a mental health professional or find a support group to work through all of this. You are a hero to others, especially his family. ❤️"
AmItheAsshole,fdfvm7y,t1_fdfuric,1578371405.0,She probably thought it was an extra $10 tip. Maybe you should have made a point to text or tell her in a note that you appreciate her and were now giving her a small raise. I think you will have a hard time finding someone you trust enough to give a key to your house and allow them to clean while you aren’t there. Think about getting rid of her long and hard before you do it.
AmItheAsshole,fdf9642,t1_fdeuzti,1578356222.0,"She may not have wanted to see it but she wanted to know about the “illicit” behavior. She’s nuts, he’s 20 for goodness sake. Good for him!"
confessions,fdf7sn6,t3_ekzrqr,1578355293.0,I think it’s awesome you took her in when you were so young and knew you wouldn’t ever have a normal 19 year old life. Maybe you are glad to have had a second chance at making a life for yourself rather than glad she is dead. You would have turned out a success if she had lived but maybe not at as a doctor but now you have that opportunity.
shittyfoodporn,fdcq285,t3_ekleuf,1578281186.0,Sometime simple food is the best! Looks good.
lastimages,fdaugch,t3_ekdz0n,1578250322.0,"So sorry, he sounds like an amazing person. You must be proud."
lastimages,fd6o859,t3_ek6f2t,1578193710.0,So sorry!
AmItheAsshole,fd6nv0v,t1_fd38yfi,1578193585.0,I love this!^^^
PublicFreakout,fd6b5yv,t1_fd562oo,1578188294.0,I was thinking this dog is so happy he gets to put all that training to work! Good Boy!
trashy,fd1wy6z,t1_fd1vjz6,1578138117.0,Obviously there wasn’t room or this man wouldn’t have sat on his legs for no reason. Maybe the kid should put the phone down and be aware of his surroundings.
shittyfoodporn,fd0cdu4,t1_fd0b49e,1578116827.0,Give it a try!
AmItheAsshole,fd01r9q,t3_ejp9sy,1578112358.0,It seems like the bride is trying to make herself feel better rather than you. It seems like a lot of added expense that really won’t benefit you at all. Go to the weeding as a guest and you will probably have a much better time in a dress that’s a lot less and what you get to pick out.
PublicFreakout,fd00h6m,t1_fcznkmu,1578111772.0,She was in the bulkhead and had no way to put him/her under the seat at any point in the flight.  It the best place for someone with a pet. They probAbly wanted her to put him somewhere else. She should have moved. Problem solved.
PublicFreakout,fczwr0n,t3_ejk7av,1578109935.0,I want to know where Nate has been and for how long?  Anyone else curious?
AmItheAsshole,fczvoh1,t3_ejm454,1578109403.0,"I don’t think you and your husband had to agree on a name. One of you should have said to the other pick something else or give me three options to choose from to avoid this. Also, do you want your daughter to always be associated with her dead cousin each and every time her grandma, grandpa, aunt and uncle look at her?"
shittyfoodporn,fczrrxy,t3_ejhpq2,1578107519.0,Why the bag? You could have used the cutting board. I love it either way.
shittyfoodporn,fczrgqd,t1_fczpa3j,1578107363.0,Thank you! It looks like a mess and is a mess to eat but it’s oddly tasty.
shittyfoodporn,fczrb3n,t1_fczov8y,1578107287.0,I think it’s making its way south of WV.
shittyfoodporn,fczr8cv,t1_fczkjz6,1578107250.0,Most people think putting cole slaw on a hot dog is shitty. I did until I moved to WV.
lastimages,fczgirz,t3_ejn18i,1578100751.0,Wow so sad!
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcyortp,t3_ejirpd,1578084048.0,I’m sure he’s grading the paper of the one filming.
AbruptChaos,fcwvbc4,t1_fcwemtl,1578039114.0,How about this - looks like a rocket launch? Better? Don’t take things so literal.
AbruptChaos,fcvtw5b,t3_ej3ced,1578010000.0,That looked like an Apollo 13 take off. Who would put that in their bare ass? I’m sure the idiot has severe burns.
AmItheAsshole,fcvtg5t,t3_ej1n0f,1578009713.0,She’s a rude entitled cow. NTA
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcvraxu,t3_eizqau,1578008327.0,I love him! He is so cute! If I knew how I would show you Chico!
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcvcld2,t3_eizqau,1577999275.0,Awe! I had a black long haired Chihuahua named Chico.
offmychest,fcu5atp,t3_eirilf,1577972902.0,I love this! Next time have either a rolled up rug or a big black garbage bag next to you.
AmItheAsshole,fcu5470,t3_eiqkar,1577972773.0,I immediately thought it’s a brother. YTA
whatisthisthing,fctayzg,t3_eipp0z,1577937684.0,It’s so weird that I see a picture of this nutcracker and it takes me back 40 years to my dad cracking me nuts at Christmas.
whatisthisthing,fcssycs,t3_eipp0z,1577924315.0,Nutcracker- especially for walnuts. I remember we had one in the 70’s.
AbruptChaos,fcryszj,t3_eimm42,1577908554.0,Love the title!
PublicFreakout,fcr9tv7,t1_fcr023v,1577898865.0,I love when people chime in and have nothing to do with the issue. The officers handled it well.
shittyfoodporn,fcr8wf4,t3_eij6py,1577898476.0,So close but yet so far from French onion soup.
shittyfoodporn,fcr8oy6,t3_eiiyle,1577898396.0,"For the love of all that is holy, blur that haggis out or make this post nsfw!"
lastimages,fcojfx1,t1_fcnu91d,1577833739.0,So sad. Renting is difficult with pets. My thoughts are with you.
PublicFreakout,fcn3qp4,t3_ehsbeh,1577802441.0,I didn’t hear you say freeze.
WeWantPlates,fca4sbe,t1_fc9uwik,1577563053.0,"Honestly, it’s not the best candle holder so it make work better as a “plate”."
WeWantPlates,fca4myg,t1_fc9vkz5,1577562994.0,I was missing a rat with mine. Darn!
WeWantPlates,fc8ppvj,t1_fc7wwkc,1577539729.0,I should have used it for Christmas dinner. If I had only known the possibilities sooner.
WeWantPlates,fc7cwcu,t3_egko4i,1577503738.0,That’s a tealight candle holder from Crate and Barrel. I have it.
AmItheAsshole,fc0ib8u,t3_efgh2m,1577291467.0,They suck!
PublicFreakout,fbxgzmy,t1_fbxggjn,1577186984.0,Love it.
