You're right it is a made up term, but wanted to show that it isn't interfered with in any way.

And hunting isn't *needed* in a modern capitalist society that is as thriving as we claim.  If we are using the 2A as the sole test for tyranny then we are doomed. There are many other ways to be tyrannical that allow weapons. So while I won't take a lion's claws, because he uses them to hunt I wouldn't expect it to decide between chicken,pork, or beef at a store. You argue >forced to use our brains to come up with tools to do the jobs that other creatures take for granted
Well gathering and farming answers that and we don't need to hunt, we do so now for fun and heritage. Self defense I have a hard time arguing against I'm just pointing out that there are issues that need to be addressed.

You're right that the majority of police and military are pro 2A but they are also the tools to be used by said tyrannical government making it circular logic. Also while they too oaths to defend the constitution, it is not their job to take down a tyrannical government. As the definition is not clearly stated in the constitution then this is open to interpretation. Patriotic duty is to defend the country not to ensure we have guns."

PoliticalHumor,ff2rjrx,t1_ff2lz51,1579520941.0,"I agree with you.

The mythos of a ""good guy with a gun"" and ""over throwing a tyrannical government"" is what has kept guns so strong in the states.  I support a redefinition of the American 2A in which we figure out if we want it for sport, food, protecting one's self from violence, or to over throw the tyrannical government.  Each case supports differing types of weapon (self defense for example would be more supportive of pistols, hunting would be of rifles with a low cycle rate -think bolt action rifles, and tyrannical government would favor  semi you fully auto weapons along with weapons that have a strong but accurate shot).  The funny part is many 2A supporters think you can only support the 2A by supporting that clause of the amendment everything else is an added effect. 

However the arguments of a good guy with a gun and being willing and able to overthrow the government are opposing sides. As the good guy with a gun is a law abiding citizen armed and able to stop (violent) lawlessness, and over throw of the government is generally a crime (see also: treason, extremist, or terrorist); it is impossible to be laying in wait to commit one crime while being a good guy with a gun which then erodes one of their arguments on why we need more guns.  Added to the fact that law enforcement/military grade technologies are either restricted/not available to the private individual or not affordable to the masses there is a huge discrepancy between the two sides.

 A group of drinking buddies armed with AR rifles  modified to full semi-auto to auto may match the fire power ability of the common logistic unit in the military but they then have little support for the following military capabilities : air support (with aircraft intended for that purpose), missiles, rockets, drones capable of great vision even at night and capable of initiating an attack on an unknowing target, grenades/high explosives in general, night vision devices/enhanced optics.

Yes you can argue that Afghanistan has shown that individuals with lower technology are able to resist, but they still had to tactics taught to them by us long ago and refined by time, practice, improvisations, and lessons learned.  Plus we were the other side of the fight, the possibility of your friend or family being targeted was astronomically lower than the same fight being within the States.  Add to the fact that there are other means the government could target that group hoping for a peaceful end (ex: freezing funds, restricting travel, declaring you a terrorist threat abroad, etc) and weapons become much less of a valid argument.  

Plus there isn't a constitutionally agreed upon definition of tyrannical government, so if either side feels too much had been given up without any sort of return they have an out. If their side wins, having that [clause] added into the constitution seems redundant and unnecessary. If their side losses the fighters will likely be branded as terrorists or treasonous and having that clause again seems unnecessary because while they followed that amendment they violated many other state and or federal laws.


So which side will it be America ""good guy with a gun"" or the ability to ""overthrow a tyrannical governance?""  

And yes I realize this monologue focuses on only one of the 4 reasons I gave for redefining the 2A.  I can agree that there is merit and detriment in the other arguments. For example sport is not defined and could be construed to give permission to hunt solely to have a trophy, permission to foul up a bunch of land with lead, or it could be used to see who can shoot more accurate, or what a machine gun feels like when shooting at inanimate objects. 

Hunting seems pretty straight forward in making sure populations stay within ecological balance (must be coupled with regulations to prevent man from squeezing the land away there by reducing the numbers of ecologically sound population for x animal down to 0), but also allows for the ability to provide food (if that's how they choose to provide food).  

The self defensive position seems the most logical at home, but does present challenges especially when minority populations are brought into the mix or the self defense isn't at home. These limited examples would have to be addressed and maybe there isn't a catch all answer for each, but redefining the 2A allows the American people the chance to take all the (federal) laws that have been developed and restate them so they don't oppose one another (at the federal level), and just as our founding fathers would have had a hard time wrapping their heads around the technologies that would be developed and lumped together in to one category we should attempt to look down the road and make a best guess on emerging technologies.  

Technologies like directed energy weapons (ex: microwave guns, laser rifles, laser blasters, plasma shooters, etc) and rail-gun don't fall cleanly into the definition of firearms (where as RPGs and grenades do) but they can have a similar or more detrimental effect to many firearms currently available and may be otherwise untraceable once used."

 Tolkien studied languages and attempted to build the languages for the species he selected.

I think iirc Klingon was used in the show in a useable system and the fans made use of it same with GoT Dothraki. Star Wars (yes *star wars*) created their own ""font"" to allow for use with mostly English syntax- essentially you're writing the words in different looking glyphs but typing it in English (again iirc). So it truly spans the spectrum and depends on how much effort they put into the design of the glyphs, the mythos, the actual syntax, and wanting it to feel real versus just being a prop that suggests ""I'm not happening in the US/UK.""
