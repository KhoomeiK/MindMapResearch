AskReddit,femjfxk,t1_felfa2b,1579258674.0,"oh my god, I used to do my nails a lot but have now stopped. I recently looked at my old polish collection and a sense of dread came over me, realising how much that cost.. but it made me happy at the time, that's what matters!"

relationship_advice,felgp6n,t1_fekvrqd,1579221757.0,"I agree with you in that she should be honest and open with you in private, and that this behaviour is bizarre, but the above commenter is on to something.

Academia can be a terrible and soul sucking environment, even more so if you're a woman. And it's extremely competitive, if you don't fit in with the norm for your field or department you'll be spat out. And it's very hard to fit in when the norm usually is self-important elderly men. I'm not saying she's correct but she must be very stressed, particularly if she's going to be out of a job soon."
relationship_advice,felfc42,t3_epn9qw,1579220840.0,"yeah don't have sex at the mall, that's gross. also, having sex is not what makes you a man.

anyway, it's normal to be anxious. forget about porn and try not to see it as a performance, treat it more as a fun way to explore and connect with another person. and for most people their first time sucks, so don't fret it too much.

omg I felt so old writing this. good luck."
relationship_advice,fele1ld,t3_eprosd,1579219983.0,"woohoo, enjoy your date!"
relationship_advice,feldufq,t1_felbz7t,1579219849.0,"OP is this your other account? If so, is it fiance or husband and how old are you guys? Are you already in therapy? Because that's what you say in the other post.

Anyways, in case this is not a fake story- in the end you're only responsible for yourself. Get some therapy and support for your alcohol addiction and codepedency, do the hard work so that you can be in a better place and during that process you'll see how the relationship with your partner evolves. You don't have to decide what will happen with him now and it's not only up to you. Take care."
relationship_advice,felaaja,t1_fekrc7a,1579217504.0,"yeah they both have problems, but it's possible she's skewing the story so that he sounds like an insufferable ahole.. maybe she just wants validation or doesn't want to have to change and is doing it subconsciously."
