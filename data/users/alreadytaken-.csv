toptalent,ff9qclz,t1_ff97bpr,1579718631.0,Yeah because of one of my hobbies I feel I could probably pull this off in a few attempts honestly
Kendama,ff6pmn4,t1_ff5oz8o,1579632244.0,Of course man! Nobody puts out content with the same level of professionalism and quality.
trees,ff3tuqo,t3_epetqi,1579548728.0,This sounds so similar to the hospital experiences I've had and my friends have had where I live. Are you Canadian by chance?
FREE,ff1jopl,t3_er31c0,1579480271.0,I haven't been able to afford rocket league on pc but have been wanting to make the switch to pc. Fingers crossed
Kendama,ff19q3b,t3_eqst4l,1579476608.0,I was just checking your channel for new uploads last week. Glad to see you back man I really enjoy the content
AskReddit,fel1oej,t1_fekwbzj,1579212133.0,I first heard the rooster teeth guys talking about how good it was. Both are free in the xbox game pass and I've considered checking them out. Are they really original or is there another game they kinda compare to?
AskReddit,fekuvl8,t1_fejzdow,1579208084.0,If someone had never played either would you recommend the second?
PublicFreakout,fejw3my,t1_fe7oq6x,1579187197.0,Why are there so many crazy white people trying to start black lives matter rallies. I get the meaning behind it and support it but it feels borderline racist when it's white people making it their problem
PublicFreakout,fejv2xz,t1_feg1m9q,1579186527.0,I've never gotten in trouble with the law but I have had some terrible experience dealing with police. I would have been so thankful to have someone there to witness any of my situations. Thank you for what you do genuinely

woahdude,feifbyp,t1_feiey5s,1579137202.0,100% I'm shocked by how good it looks in this video honestly but nothing compares to seeing it in person
GamingDetails,feiaf54,t1_fehpo7t,1579133902.0,I saw one on the titanfall sub I think and people didn't have any proof that this was anything beyond a fan theory made around a mistake. I'm not taking this as fact when all op probably did was see the same threads we did and wrote it as if it's a fact because it's so easy to state things confidently on reddit and have people agree with you even when you know nothing
cringepics,fei9yst,t1_fei8anx,1579133599.0,"I finished part one and yeah, wow he was a scum fuck. So much worse than I realized"
RocketLeague,fei3bu0,t1_fei2mcc,1579129357.0,Same I think it's one of the coolest decals ever which is why it's so infuriating that they messed it up and could fix it so easily

cringepics,fehgk1e,t1_feh3ac8,1579116089.0,"I've stumbled across a few of his videos and didn't hate them I'm gonna have to chack this out, I'm hoping it's easier to follow than countless hours of interviews"
shittymoviedetails,fehg3f7,t1_fehavng,1579115818.0,Me neither but if you sort by top of all time youll quickly see why I'm getting down voted. Somehow the popular opinion is that repeating the same jokes and phrases mindlessly at each other is comedy
RocketLeague,fehejlq,t1_fegoe6r,1579114911.0,What you don't want the wheel equivalent to magma?
woahdude,fehebyj,t1_feh63uw,1579114787.0,I think that's where I experienced this. To anyone curious it is as cool as it looks and I'd strongly recommend checking it out in person if you can
shittymoviedetails,fehaec9,t3_ep47go,1579112484.0,"How many time is the ""I'm watching the wrong movie"" joke going to get front page. I'm tempted to make my own for how easy the karma is"
Kendama,feevr19,t3_eosvqb,1579042258.0,Sourmash has an option to order a custom I believe but that's the only thing similar that I've seen

Kendama,feer7g4,t1_fee4pr1,1579039479.0,"1a yoyo is a blast once you learn the basics too, I'd second this suggestion if you have money to spend on something new. It can be cheap to get into but can become a really pricy hobby if you start buying more"

todayilearned,feeg5sd,t1_febxwbw,1579033080.0,Edmonton has some amazing parks. And the streets on the south side of the river with all the tree cover have to be my favourite streets in any city.
todayilearned,feefx2s,t1_feccmqz,1579032939.0,"As someone who's taken trips to camp out in bc where you won't see another person. I have to agree. It's hard to leave Alberta because we have the best of every world with mountains, plains, Forrest, dessert (almost) but nothing really compares to the beauty of bc. I try to take a yearly trip out in the summer if I can"
todayilearned,feefi3p,t1_fec6wdz,1579032694.0,And breathing feels so fucking weird at that temp. Even the sound of your footsteps in the snow is super different. -40 shouldn't happen

gaming,feeeskh,t3_eoctg7,1579032271.0,Can't have a reddit worthy pic of a gaming set up or basement without the sky blue and magenta led strips
Kendama,fecs69l,t1_fecnegq,1578982572.0,You know if I read your name I probably could have guessed that. But yes kendama and weed are better than getting into heroin or something like that
Kendama,feclu0i,t1_feche4t,1578977101.0,That's fair. I have no knowledge on the brand I just remembered people getting anal about it
Kendama,fec8irj,t1_fec6o37,1578968511.0,"Well shit I'm gonna have to at least give this another shot, it looks super inexpensive but really nice"

Kendama,febnx5d,t3_enib2m,1578960866.0,Your enthusiasm and excitement makes me want to pick up my kendama. Great clip! What kendama is that btw?
Kendama,febnrtv,t1_fe3uu5z,1578960806.0,"It's probably the main benefit but overall a dull spike will likely just come with downsides for a new player, after years I still can't do border balances"
Kendama,febngcw,t3_elid9e,1578960668.0,"I remember a lot of my schools reaction to it after attempting it and failing to land big cup was ""its dumb and a waste of time"" a few friends and I got into yoyo and kendama during highschool and put hours into it everyday despite it not ""being cool"". Now that I'm past high school I'm glad I put the time into it that I did, I wish I put more time into it because I didn't realize that would be the last time I have that much free time. I wouldn't listen to them personally, high school is such a weird environment compared to what you'll face later in life, take the time to focus on what you enjoy. We live in an age where you could make a career out of it if you're lucky"
Kendama,febmjks,t1_fdi5ney,1578960431.0,I mean dama blends so well with weed that I'd guess a lot of us are doing drugs too but there's nothing wrong with how anyone spends their time as long as they aren't hurting anyone. Keep playing op!
Kendama,febm19s,t3_elvq3r,1578960214.0,Every part of a kendama is pretty tough and damage resistant. I've never had a string break so I wouldn't worry about that. The only thing I'd ever worry about is paint chipping or cups chipping. That being said I've gotten lucky and have never chipped a cup so even that isn't a big worry
Kendama,febjpqo,t3_emcz45,1578959544.0,Either my old grape spectra homegrown or the grain split. I really need to try a new sweets shape now that I think about it

Kendama,febhmhf,t3_en12ll,1578958860.0,I first learned lighthouse on a shitty slick paint kendama while killing time in high school woods class. It definitely is easier on sticky paint but it's definitely possible to learn on any paint. More practice and you should have it in no time
Kendama,febh5nl,t1_fdyejju,1578958730.0,I see a bit of damage but you must have a fairly gentle play style. They all look so good still

Kendama,febff3h,t3_enenba,1578958224.0,How do you avoid them tipping over and causing a domino effect with kendamas? I'm currently making a shelf and was going to make it this way but had them all falling off
Kendama,febefsv,t1_fe60i9q,1578958012.0,"Hey that's one way to handle a dirty bong, just replace it with a clean one"

Kendama,febdoes,t1_feaxd03,1578957757.0,A random brand off of amazon. I remember op asking if they were any good a few days back and everyone warning against it
PewdiepieSubmissions,fe9bvie,t1_fe7xcmc,1578936168.0,It should warn you that it's unoriginal and puts out maybe one funny tweet a month while spewing dozens a day.

AskReddit,fdrsxn5,t1_fdqaoaw,1578689253.0,"Just found out about the super Nintendo you can download on the switch. My girlfriend and I stayed up playing super Mario world for the nostalgia. Nintendo just knows how to make fun games, it's not the most powerful console but the switch is easily my favorite of the current Gen consoles."
AskReddit,fdp09cu,t1_fdn7djt,1578616936.0,With ah my interest slowly faded as the dynamic of the original 6 members started to get broken. I found I never ended up seeing the people I subscribed to see which was disappointing

news,fdo1rlq,t1_fdn9jot,1578597303.0,I think it was chamath palihapitiya talking about the downsides of social media who expands and explains he left Facebook because it felt like they were trying to brainwash and manipulate the people viewing the site. I'm not sure how much truth there is behind it but you may enjoy what he says
news,fdo12bp,t1_fdn37ik,1578596929.0,Praise feels inappropriate still. I stopped using Facebook after realizing we are the product they sell. They convinced us we are the customers and so purple think they have a day on the ads but they fail to see that to Facebook they are nothing more than a bunch of sellable data and Facebook gets paid to shove ads down their throats so they are gonna put whatever ads pay well on the site. People should use the site if they want but keep in mind what your role on the site actually is.
news,fdo0bp3,t1_fdnl7fj,1578596490.0,"I'm more bothered by the idea that we are all the product Facebook is selling. They make their money off of ads and that only works if we see it, that and all our personal data they sell makes it very clear we are the sellable product Facebook is making bank by using. I don't know why this became a political issue but the problem will likely continue unless people can stop dividing themselves over political nonsense."
news,fdnzzoy,t1_fdn35w3,1578596295.0,"If that's why they did it I would. I'm glad that's a side effect but they do this to make money, not protect our rights let's stay reasonable here"
news,fdnzuub,t1_fdn9m2z,1578596217.0,"I think people need to take some responsibility, don't just fall for this kind of stuff and use your brain. I saw an old Facebook employees speech about how Facebook is trying to manipulate your thoughts and emotions and so the easy counter to that is to just use your brain and do your own research"
news,fdnzjv6,t1_fdncujh,1578596039.0,"Does it not just disable the app? If I undo that option I don't have to download Facebook again, it just reappears. I'm pretty sure you'd have to root to fully remove it, or get something with pure android. From personal experience pure android phones have been the only ones to not have Facebook, I went out of the way to get my current phone because I'd rather have no phone than have Facebook preinstalled"
news,fdnyt5u,t1_fdn6bn7,1578595608.0,Exactly. And trumps party likely can afford a bunch of ads
news,fdnynr4,t3_em8l2c,1578595521.0,Why would they though? It would only benefit the people using the site and those people aren't the customers they are the product that Facebook is selling. They make money off of us seeing ads no matter the ad so they are obviously going to go with whoever is paying. It's incredibly foolish to think you're anything more than a product to sell if you're using a site like Facebook
bonnaroo,fdhkt0e,t3_elbuoq,1578424759.0,Damn.. Billy Strings would be so awesome to see

cringepics,fdc3q7b,t1_fda50a1,1578266511.0,And they have a weird culture around not understanding that imgur is a site to host images made for reddit and thinking that their stuff is being reposted or stolen for reddit
Kendama,fdbcy1i,t1_fcyorcf,1578256158.0,I found out of the recent kendamas I've gotten sweets paint has been the best for its price/how easy it is to get. And they have great patterns for tracking. On the pricier end the paint on my grain theory is pretty decent and nothing has compared to the slaydawg for me
Kendama,fdbakob,t3_ejppkg,1578255533.0,"Went to add to cart, there were three left. And when I clicked add it was out of stock... Going to catch the next good drop hopefully"

Kendama,fdba6nq,t3_ek2pty,1578255398.0,"I second the sweets beginner playlist. They have a ton of tutorials of all difficulty too I haven't stopped watching their tutorials.

blackmagicfuckery,fd0hn8w,t1_fczruoj,1578118929.0,I feel like it could work as a puzzle game even. Not exactly sure what it would look like as I'm not a game designer or anything. But this looks fun to mess around with in the same way that portal was to me
worldpolitics,fcybcer,t1_fcxvg73,1578077606.0,It's scary that it's next to impossible to tell with his tweets

halo,fcm12x6,t1_fclwv6h,1577761471.0,"Yeah my internet has been randomly going out for a minute or so at a time lately and it's been a fear of mine that I might get banned over it. That's so dumb, I'd get it in competitive matches but I shouldnt get banned for leaving a public match when other companies have included a post/pre game lobby and the ability to join matches in progress to prevent players leaving being such a big issue. I don't like that we get punished as a solution to their problem"
unpopularopinion,fclynyx,t1_fbtsbtq,1577759706.0,"And as someone who's been in the hospital by my own choice I have to say staying there will be a lesson. It taught me to pretend to be happy because, at least where I live, the funding is too low for them to really do much helping so a lot of people will be stuck in there for way longer than they should be. It's not their intention but it genuinely feels like a prison"
unpopularopinion,fclyc0s,t1_fbwusl4,1577759468.0,"Not at all, most people don't have a ton of police interactions in their lives. There are good cops out there, enough that it's possible someone may not ever see the corruption happening from their handful of interactions. I also think it'd be ridiculous to assume that police are the same level of just and honest in every part of the country/world. You probably have had good luck with police, I wish everyone could say the same"
unpopularopinion,fclwy6m,t3_egcaxa,1577758486.0,I agree with you completely but I've heard this for a long time. No part of me feels like it's an unpopular opinion.
halo,fclvsl8,t1_fclunt8,1577757677.0,It better be true because I have stuck out so many matches my whole team has left just so I didn't get banned
halo,fclqtc9,t1_fclay8o,1577754224.0,Does it ban you if you leave too many games too? I swear it warned me against something like that
AskReddit,fcj7ybu,t1_fci1bj0,1577679540.0,Did you find being sober after smoking for a long time that being sober felt like it's own high because it was such a different feeling?

MovieDetails,fc6m1no,t1_fc6he9c,1577483767.0,Yeah as someone who was enjoying their series about cg I've noticed that a few days after each episode there's a reddit post making it seem like the person found it randomly
modernwarfare,fc2tkxh,t1_fc2cxl3,1577373654.0,That's not a trophy as far as I know what are you talking about. It was children's soccer not a major league. It's a video game man. Isn't sitting around relaxing good enough?
modernwarfare,fc0p78n,t1_fc05v45,1577296370.0,Well yeah it does. But why should losing feel good? Use losing as motivation to get better. I didn't get a trophy for ducking ass at soccer as a kid but yet I wasn't depressed. How did everyone become such snowflakes that they need to be congratulated for losing? Just accept the other team was better and move on. There's nothing wrong with losing. It's an opportunity too evaluate yourself and improve
