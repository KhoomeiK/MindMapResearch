The hyper conservative Roman senate hated him for his acting and love of performance and certainly other reasons. The plebs may have shared similar views about acting but they definitely wouldn't have felt as strongly about it as the traditionalists in the Senate. 


The lavish spending on public works and games is exactly the kind of thing that tended to keep emperor's in the good graces of the peasants. His prosecution of the Christians wouldn't have meant much to them either. They were a strange and foreign cult at this time which tend to make pretty good scapegoats. His active prosecution of Christians very well could have helped his popularity with the plebs."

If the military is drafting people 24-25 year old by the time they're trained and put in action they're only going to be in their primes for a short amount of time. They would rather train 18-19 year olds so they can already have some experience by the time they enter their primes and so the military can use them for the entirety of their prime."

todayilearned,ffcv7zo,t1_ffci3tq,1579807950.0,Japanese dedication in WWII was intense as fuck. There was a Japanese guy on an island who didn't surrender until the 70s or something. In an effort to get him to surrender they dropped newspapers describing modern day Japan. He claimed that those newspapers only proved that Japan had not surrendered because so long as a single Japanese was left alive then it wouldn't surrender. He was taught that every man woman and child would die before Japan surrendered and he seemed to believe it. He does not seem to be alone in that belief.

If hanging out in a sub dedicated to hating dogs isn't a sign of being obsessed with dogs I don't know what is.

I do feel like these subs that are set up exclusively in opposition to something are almost bound to turn toxic eventually unless the mods are extremely active.

Also I love Nintendo for what it is but they make all kinds of weird ass decisions and based on their history it seems pretty useless to attempt to force them to change.

In any case the ""nothing is truly infallible"" argument is more of a philosophical argument than anything else, if we're taking infallible to quite literally mean perfect with a 0% chance of being incorrect. I have no problem saying that some things can be proven to be so close to infallible that it makes no difference for real world applications though."

In general I do think that an employer should be able to fire someone for whatever reason they like so long as it's not discriminatory. I'm sure part of that is growing up in an American culture that prioritizes freedom to such a degree that it's often harmful. I like the way Europe does a whole lot of things but I can't shake all of the American freedom programing I've received.

I think you could also argue that no evidence is truly infallible. Is it really worth spending much more money and risking killing innocent people just so we can kill some criminals instead of letting them rot in prison for the rest of their lives? 


There's really no argument for the death penalty any way you look at it."

television,ff78db8,t1_ff6tdri,1579643131.0,That's definitely true but I do feel like it's a little different since there was some separation between the personality and the goals of the two versions of Kovacs. It allowed them to do their own thing to a certain degree but still feel like the same person. Adding someone new to the mix who should be essentially the same as Joel Kinnaman's Kovacs seems much harder to pull off. And that's without getting into the emotional attachment to the Joel version. Even if you have no problem in principle to having a new actor as Kovacs it's still reasonable to be a little upset to not have the guy from S1.

Showerthoughts,ff50c4q,t1_ff4srh9,1579576830.0,"The problem with arguing this with logic is that magic is inherently set up to not be contained by logic. There's only a handful of things established that magic and spells can't do and from there it's pretty much a free for all. 



If there was a full out war between muggles and wizards they could potentially invent spells that would protect them from firearms or invents spells that would instant melt all the muggles guns or something.


I do think the wizards ass backwards devotion to tradition has put them at a severe disadvantage to muggles in a lot of ways but it's more complicated than ""guns shoot faster than spells"". I think muggles could probably beat wizards in an all out war mostly due to outnumbering them so much but technology would definitely play a role."

That's the only metric that matters. Obviously a lot of people get in because they're smart and smart people are likely to be successful but a lot of people also get in because they're well connected and well connected people are also likely to be successful."

nfl,fefhmw0,t1_fefe0vf,1579056510.0,"NBA has a soft cap instead of a hard cap. Teams can spend more than the cap they just have to pay a ""luxury tax"" at a high rate for every dollar they go over the salary cap. Warriors had no problem spending a lot of money going well over the salary cap because it allowed them to have dream team which dominated and brought in tons of cash."

politics,fef3f81,t1_fee909m,1579047256.0,The problem with having a guy like Trump is it doesn't have to be overt at all. Anyone who spent any amount of time with him leading up to him calling for the strike probably could have told you he was pissed and going to escalate things with Iran. It's absurdly easy to take advantage of him and the situations he causes.

Everyone is going to have their own view on what constitutes cheating and there are gray areas that are important to discuss. Good luck with your future relationships if you don't feel that way though."

AmItheAsshole,fecjly6,t1_fecj1se,1578975502.0,"That's not how relationships work. Bodily autonomy is not a blank check to do whatever you want free from consequences. My girlfriend is certainly allowed to exercise her bodily autonomy to post videos of herself masturbating. Same way she has the bodily autonomy to masturbate with someone in Skype chat or have sex with whoever she wants. 



I'm also allowed to consider those things cheating and break up with someone for doing them."
AmItheAsshole,fecipli,t1_fecbb78,1578974883.0,I'm not possessive at all but if I found out my girlfriend was posting videos of herself masturbating I'd probably break up with her because that would be cheating in my mind. This is absolutely the type of grey area stuff that should be discussed ahead of time. It's ridiculous to just assume your partner is going to be okay with something like that.
AmItheAsshole,feciiln,t3_eoe91c,1578974745.0,"NTA this is absolutely the kind of thing that needs to be discussed beforehand. If the genders were reversed there would be no where near this many people defending a girl posting videos of herself masturbating without telling her bf. 



This would essentially be cheating in my mind and it's common sense that you'd need to discuss if your partner is okay with that kind of stuff."

There's no real cultural importance placed on the actual drink offered though, it's more just a polite thing to do in case they're thirsty."
therewasanattempt,febhsfm,t1_febbvfp,1578958924.0,I think so. It doesn't mean that wattage isn't a factor but it probably does indicate that's it's more about Americans just not drinking tea. I don't think stovetop kettles are particularly common here either.
therewasanattempt,feb1p3q,t1_feb00hq,1578954593.0,I was just curious and was very clear it was just about what I personally do. I use a coffee maker for coffee and don't drink tea so that's those. Since you have to boil it all in a pot anyways for pasta and rice (also don't make rice) it still doesn't seem worth having an entire appliance dedicated to getting my pot of pasta to boiling temperature a little bit faster.
therewasanattempt,featujd,t1_feamegp,1578952165.0,I disagree but that's just based on my experience. I tried to find a poll or something about how common they are but couldn't so who knows.

therewasanattempt,feaepza,t1_fead7hj,1578947799.0,I can't find any figures but there are tons of articles talking about how American's don't have electric kettles and trying to explain why. Saying they aren't a thing is obviously exaggerating but everything I can find indicates they're extremely rare. It's probably far less than homes with an Xbox and that's only a specific brand of game console.

therewasanattempt,feaalwu,t1_fe9wtgt,1578946329.0,Electric kettles are rare in the US. I've heard it's because our standard outlets are a lower voltage so they don't boil as fast but even ignoring that issue we also just don't drink that much tea. A lot of people don't have stove top kettles either.
