lifehacks,ffg5qla,t1_ffelr93,1579899033.0,Well to be fair if the teens really have mental health problems then taking their smartphones away would actually be helping them mentally more than punishing. Even if the teens don't realize it. Social media and this whole smartphone craze is the cause to a pretty big chunk of todays depression/anxiety/feelsad pandemic.

It's a 52k 117.9 m² house in a place where there is just amazing nature, has a 1272 m² yard, 5bedrooms, fireplace and a sauna. Theres a lake nearby too. Could use some work to make more pretty but is completely liveable exactly as it is now as well."
TheCircleTV,ff56kis,t1_ff2q90m,1579581682.0,"So i also did some research on the subject. Apparently in Estonia all the gambling/lottery winnings will be paid out in the full amount, no taxes on winnings of any sort.

Then there was the differenence between apartments and condos, if i understand correctly the biggest difference in the US is actually in ownership, as you said apartments are owned by complexes and mostly only rented out and condos are owned by separate owners. Here we just have one word that means both apartments and condos. I've always been using ""apartment"" thinking it was the correct term. It's either an apartment or a house when you buy realestate here. There are not many apartment buildings that are just owned by one person/company. So most of the local 'apartments' are actually condos around here, i didn't know there was a difference.

So i guess it's a lot more life changing to win something in Estonia as opposed to the UK or America. But we're also a lot more poor in general and have waaay lower wages.

Also thank you for your long and specific answers, it's really interesting to read how different everything actually is between where we both live. :)"
TheCircleTV,ff2pl4w,t1_ff2p3by,1579518072.0,"I live in Estonia and it was actually kind of shocking to me when you said that people can't buy individual apartments where you are. With a 100k i could buy a completely new apartment in a city, 55k could get me an older apartment.

Currently my rent is 250€ (277usd) and utilities are usually around 50€. Which is actually kind of low because i got lucky with the apartment but 400-600€ is pretty average for rent around here for nicer apartments.

Oh and out of curiosity, why did you say ""buy the rights to an apartment"" instead of just ""buy an apartment"" ? Sounds like the laws here are massively different from wherever you are."
TheCircleTV,ff2p0ib,t1_ff2odbl,1579517205.0,"I could most definitely buy an apartment with even 55k in the city. Granted it would be a smallish 2 bedroom apartment that's not in the best shape but i don't need much and would rather spend the money on renovating my own apartment that i would otherwise spend on rent. 55k could also get me a house in some remote location in a small village further away from bigger cities. Which is still extremely close to everything in american standards, my entire country is roughly 350km (~210miles) in diameter.

 Idk where you're from but where i am buying an apartment is completely normal, noone is stopping anyone from owning apartments and most companies that build them actually would rather sell them all individually than rent them.

Oh and also, did a quick calculation, for 55k i could pay my rent and utilities for about 13years."

TheCircleTV,fewl0ir,t1_fejeku5,1579413157.0,"Yeah, she knows how people on the internet treat fat people so if she can't handle it and keeps crying all the time maybe she should get off social media and reality tv? You know, for her own mental health."
TheCircleTV,fewkt9p,t1_fejn9pb,1579412959.0,"The biggest moment for me was when joey tried to explain why he chose to boot her but she just hysterically cut him off and kept repeating that it was because of her weight. If that's not insecurity i don't know what it. Joey also booted miranda who he found attractive, she was cool with it. If sean really was as confident as she says she is then she wouldn't have taken getting voted off a reality show to be purely about her obesity. She didnt even consider that maybe it was strategy, maybe it was her personality, she went straight to ""no u vote me off cause i fat.""

Karyn never cried about being fat, so she probably actually was comfortable in her skin, unlike Sean. She chose Merzedese as a strategy, not a body shaming movement."

TheCircleTV,fevwrmc,t1_feszxh1,1579402431.0,"Fair enough. I guess i saw it as more of a social experiment than reality game show tbh. Confirming that most people, no matter the backround, have a really hard time actually being themselves when presented in a purely online presence while knowing they will be rated by others. 

The addictive dopamine rush of being rated higher than others, seen when every single player who becomes influencer says that it was horrible/""hardest thing i've ever had to do"" to make the decision and yet when it happens again they jump through the roof in happiness. Shooby even says that he has become everything about social media that he hates but you can still see he gets the rush from getting a lot of internet points.

So in conclusion, i feel like most people irl who use social media daily are also fake on it to a degree, only showing their good side or a version of them that they would like to be, not actually are. The problem being social media in it's essence, not just the circle."
