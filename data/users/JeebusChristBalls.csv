The one on the left looks like a real ""bready"" sandwich and the one on the right looks more like a decent looking burger (as far as McDonalds goes that is)."

iamatotalpieceofshit,ff30mz6,t1_ff2q0fy,1579530493.0,Why would they board up the windows before they move?
dogswithjobs,fes7xjr,t1_fes6pkp,1579362315.0,I think so.
dogswithjobs,fes6jyf,t1_fer3j4p,1579361922.0,Poncho liner. Issued us mlitary field gear. Super cozy.
dogswithjobs,fes63v2,t1_feqqioj,1579361840.0,It's a poncho liner. Kind of like a lightweight blanket issued to soldiers/marines as field gear. They are comfortable af.
dogswithjobs,fes5xh0,t1_fepmxjo,1579361773.0,They are super cheap to buy. Like $35 on amazon.

StarWars,feil229,t3_ep7fvb,1579141017.0,Luke Skywalker was completely unqualified to form a new Jedi Order. He had barely any training and every mentor he had died. It really is no wonder it failed.

worldnews,febt05a,t1_febjoex,1578962323.0,"I don't think so. These billionaires take everything and give nothing back to society for the most part. Amazon does not pay taxes. This donation is probably helping them avoid taxes again next year as well. I am not sure why some people stick up for this shit to begin with. They could donate millions and millions to multiple causes and not even notice. I would probably feel better about them not paying taxes in that case. Hell, some instagram model donated $700k to the same cause by selling nudes. That is a saint. Not this cunt. He just dumped his change dish in the bucket at 7-11."
worldnews,febroih,t1_febo278,1578961911.0,"I think the point is that he and the other ultra rich really do not give much to society. They have made more than they and multiple generations of their heirs could possibly spend on the backs of the people and the planet they live on. Meanwhile they toss a couple of coins into the hat while almost breaking their arms patting themselves on the back.

It is nice that they did it but for fucks sake, Amazon pays ZERO in taxes in the US. This is probably why most people are saying ""fuck this"" and that they should pay way more because honestly, you cannot get that rich without cheating throughout your life. These billionaires are not good people no matter how much some want you to think.

Oh, and you wanting to be rich so you can be a cunt while sitting on your pile of money like Scrooge McDuck ""owning the libs"" just sounds kind of stupid."

AdviceAnimals,fdfo6w3,t1_fdfm21y,1578366235.0,I don't think that's how it works... kind of sounds like you are talking out your ass.
AdviceAnimals,fdfo2nu,t1_fdflgvq,1578366159.0,Sounds like your job sucks so you want his/her job to suck as well. Why not wonder why your job sucks worse than his/her job sucks instead of telling them to suck it up. Maybe both of your jobs suck but yours sucks more.
