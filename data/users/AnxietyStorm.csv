Outlander,fffbr2w,t1_ffebvy2,1579880465.0,I agree! I liked Dougal. He did have asshole tendencies at times but I also think he was terribly misunderstood. He had a very deep sense of honor and loyalty. Very interesting character.
corgi,fff6826,t1_fff5f8z,1579876750.0,As is their right.

CollegeBasketball,fdlrcn8,t3_em1bby,1578530661.0,I’m usually pretty excited for this game in Ames. Not so much this season.
Outlander,fdlnzli,t1_fdlnmdu,1578528367.0,"Totally get you on GOT. Loved it but never had the urge to rewatch it. I can’t seem to quit Outlander, show or books. On my 2nd reread of the books."
Outlander,fd42w8r,t3_ek0mkf,1578163870.0,Just Wanted to reiterate my vote for Sam Claflin as young William. I feel the resemblance is just remarkable.
Outlander,fcxfant,t1_fcxeetl,1578061421.0,"All fair points, and I certainly don’t disagree about Rogers character. However I do think that with the miracle of make up, good acting, and careful editing, it could be done. Again, this is just my wishful thinking. I think if I saw both of these gorgeous gentlemen on the screen at the same time, my head might explode anyway."

Outlander,fcuw3j9,t1_fcuvf0h,1577989721.0,"Changed flair from Fiery Cross to Season 5, but not sure this is a spoiler since it’s just wishful thinking rather than fact. Thanks"
