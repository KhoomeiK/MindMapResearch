DunderMifflin,ff4zhim,t3_erieyh,1579576207.0,I always try and look like I've got my shit together when I run to Target. But Walmart is like a personal dare to see how close I'll get to wearing straight up pajamas in public.
happy,ff47jdw,t3_eri5v3,1579557251.0,"OP, are you reposting these for solely for the useless internet points? Or are you really the gangrenous, cave-dwelling lich I'm picturing you as? Either way, get fucked."
90DayFiance,ff2h4kb,t3_er3aam,1579505895.0,"Anyone remember the movie Death Becomes Her? After Goldie Hawn took the potion and went full zombie/vampire/whatever mode?  Natalie's eyes look just that ice blue and it's freakin me out, maaaan."
SkincareAddiction,ff22lf8,t1_ff1z9tb,1579492099.0,Yes! Their 2% emulsion is awesome for me. I've got somewhat sensitive skin and this doesn't dry or irritate it! Great stuff and I love how affordable their whole line is.
netflix,feys1hz,t3_eqw3vb,1579449878.0,"Oh man, I love this movie. My husband and I still quote lines at each other."
CrawlerSightings,feo6vtz,t3_eq17bi,1579295898.0,"I think it's within the realm of possibility. Though extraordinary, super tall people exist. 9 ft or not, things in stages of decomposition start looking pretty other-worldly and gnarly. Here's some really tall human people next to regular height human people.

Esthetics,fecwabs,t1_fe2i947,1578987155.0,"I agree. In a perfect world, she could have handled this a bit more smooth, but I think this was a gut-feeling reaction on her part. This guy's account is super creepy."
happy,feb0pf3,t1_feaek51,1578954266.0,"Oh sweet, it is! I'll definitely have to watch that later :)"
happy,fea2t8u,t3_eo6oum,1578943787.0,"Amazing! Those looks are giving me happy flashbacks to a movie I watched too many times as a kid, ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead."" You'd probably get a kick out of it. All the looks in the movie are bonkers colorful and playful. I desperately wanted Christina Applegate's whole wardrobe. You have such a fun and vibrant sense of style!"
witchcraft,fe162hw,t3_enes6t,1578822955.0,"Definitely! I'm in Georgia. Started the day feeling lots of spring-like energy in the air; it was too still, warm, and potent. Had a hell of a downpour finally pass through in the evening with crazy wind. It's really off-putting having March weather in January."
Esthetics,fe0zlyw,t3_enke70,1578820807.0,"Well, she cancelled after admitting she was uncomfortable working alone on an unfamiliar male client. I can't say whether that's normal or not since it's highly situational, but that's her professional comfort level so she is right to establish her boundaries. Yes, this is okay."
period,fdgatzu,t3_el7tpi,1578387667.0,"Yes! I usually have one awesome day where I'm in extra confident, sexy goddess mode. Love how I look in my clothes, feel like my workouts are really paying off, can't wait till the husband gets home from work, etc. Next day; am Medusa, avert your eyes! ...That day is bogus. Don't listen to it. Sometimes outfits simply don't vibe the same on different days, too. I bet you looked great!"
Humanoidencounters,fdex39i,t1_fderpb5,1578348425.0,"I just saw your cross-post and came here. Granted it really sucks you had to move the items since whatever their intentions were, they were meaningful to somebody. (Someone took a piece home?!?) But I also get that realistically it's a stretch you guys wouldn't use the clearest pathway into a worksite due to voodoo you have no familiarity with, lol. Best of luck on this job, for real though."
80sdesign,fd7nifm,t3_ek69ws,1578207197.0,"My parents had this color scheme in our sitting room. It had soft green carpet, stiff salmon pink couches, and supremely treacherous glass coffee tables. Many a pinky toe got wrecked in there, lol."
realwitchcraft,fd6pzzi,t3_ek5b5i,1578194314.0,"Sounds like playful excitement topped out. He's dealing with sensory overload from all the foreign scents, sights, and sounds of his new home. The shuffling/rustling sounds could have instigated a confused play/attack instinct. Those dangly pole cat toys could help to get better acquainted and play with some safe distance for a while, lol. I'd also recommend he has a good place to process all the newness in peace (a place to hide). Should help him get happily settled in!"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fd1mamd,t1_fd10a6j,1578133286.0,"Oh that's my childhood right there! Mom went turbo Christian. I hated everyone putting their hands all over me and speaking in tongues/gibberish. Couldn't complain about it cause that meant you were probably full of demons! Smh. I remember her calling the ""church elders"" to verify it was ok for my brother and I to roller skate on Sunday. Fucking insane."
Humanoidencounters,fctz55i,t1_fctnphq,1577966667.0,"How charming, the ""be with me or suffer!"" persuasion. I wouldn't devote myself to a human who argued that, let alone a deity. That's abusive af and ridiculous."
netflix,fb29wg7,t3_eayyls,1576447447.0,"I've been getting those frequently, too! I just forward those bad boys right on to Netflix's scam department: [phishing@netflix.com](mailto:phishing@netflix.com)"
