fatlogic,fgnz0a9,t1_fgmmxqj,1580956024.0,"It can still be managed by not eating and just being ""hungry"". Find something else to do like clean or read a book, if you still feel the same way in an hour you may actually be hungry. Waiting a while to eat doesn't hurt anything, if you're not diabetic or hypoglycemic."
fatlogic,fgnyrxz,t1_fgmpovd,1580955874.0,"Green beans also work if you are like me and hate cukes and celery. Nuke with a little salt and whatever seasonings you want, honestly my favorite breakfast."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgkfj7l,t1_fgkecao,1580864369.0,"Children have weaker immune systems than adults, that's why childcare providers and teachers are almost mandated to have up-to-date vaccinations."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fgkeho4,t1_fgkdrd4,1580863675.0,"Tamiflu doesn't do much for the flu other than possibly lessen the length by maybe a day. It has some serious side effects that are well known and apparently worse in children. Not giving a baby tamiflu is honestly a wise choice, even adults can barely handle the stuff. The flu is a virus and until we figure out how to stop viruses, it just has to be ridden out no matter what."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fgke8nw,t1_fgkbyoh,1580863511.0,"Legally DCFS has to follow up on all calls, even if the reason for them is not real/stupid."
insanepeoplefacebook,fg7s472,t1_fg6vfus,1580600088.0,I dislike skirts because of the impracticality of them for active lifestyles. You can't jump a fence or roll down a hill without showing your entire ass while wearing a skirt.
pussypassdenied,fg7q8yi,t1_fg7pkhr,1580598744.0,"True that. My kiddo has 3 parents, me, the woman who birthed her, and the man who impregnated her mother. We share parenting duties equally and all genuinely care for and love this child. We have all been her parents since her conception, and even if she isn't genetically related to me, I would die for this kid."
TumblrInAction,fg7nwe3,t1_fg7m45x,1580597093.0,"Calm down there, this obviously isn't an attack on asexual people. Misspoken kindness is still kindness."
TumblrInAction,fg7mh6y,t1_fg7c3wu,1580596099.0,"That's a nice wish, but not all asexual people are suffering from trauma or hormonal disorders. I'm asexual and am fully capable of having and enjoying sex, I just have no desire to do so. Having sex sounds like about as much fun as going for a sunday drive. Sure, it's nice to roam and look at the countryside, but there is other stuff to do that is just as enjoyable."
BadMensAnatomy,ffjctly,t3_etwco2,1579995590.0,"Lol my aunt (dad's side) and two of her sisters were conceived during wartime, all three are girls. This was during the blitz so no claims about ""it's because their mom was in a peaceful location""."
science,ffb5dzi,t1_ffaymnk,1579752245.0,"I'm all for healthy, sustainable diets but will never go vegan, it is not healthy. Any diet that does not contain the necessary nutrients for life and has to be supplemented is not a healthy diet."
sewing,ffb548r,t3_esiwcy,1579752039.0,Why not just strip kiddo down and let her have at? Nothing wrong with a little mess.
trashy,ffb4yf1,t1_ffb3tfj,1579751917.0,"Because his response is completely unneeded and just whining about his own life instead of being happy for others? He saw someone willing to donate money for a good cause and got jealous that it wasn't being donated to him, so broke out the sob story about his rent."
TumblrInAction,ffb425k,t1_ffati31,1579751247.0,"A lot of deaf people are kinda crazy and don't see being deaf as a disability that they have to overcome, just something other people should have to jump through hoops over."
FiftyFifty,ff9zhb4,t1_ff9uvu8,1579724812.0,"It's not real. Albino dude was under the water and black dude swam away. Acid that strong would melt your skin off, not change the color."
ShitMomGroupsSay,ff9ttcw,t1_ff9g2gs,1579721128.0,"Depends on the kid, I started taking pills at 5 because adderall wasn't available in liquid, and liquid meds are gross."
clothdiaps,fev43qm,t1_fetk5oo,1579392917.0,"It's great! If you make the elastic casing a little wider, the elastic won't do that weird little curve."
JUSTNOMIL,feuyy4p,t1_fesu0i7,1579391334.0,"It didn't seem important because her children weren't important to her. Seems like one of those people who had kids because ""that's just what you did back then""."
JUSTNOMIL,feuyein,t1_feupydq,1579391157.0,"That was very hateful, but suggesting ptsd evaluation to someone you don't know and hasn't mentioned any symptoms is unnecessary."
JUSTNOMIL,feuxhq5,t1_feuml5o,1579390952.0,Tell them as soon as they are able to understand and remember. Allergies can crop up at any time. They may not have a reaction until they are grown adults.
cringepics,fetkhra,t1_fetbujs,1579376354.0,"My family is this comfortable with each other, and it's honestly great. No subject is off the table and things can be discussed and joked about without someone clutching their pearls and fainting."
cringepics,fetk78m,t1_fesihiu,1579376262.0,"But if you don't posses the capability to taste or break down those complex flavors, who cares? Ultraviolet light has just as many shades of color as visible light, but we can't see them so we don't appreciate them, either."
cringepics,fetjj9u,t1_fesaw3o,1579376086.0,That's what my mom would say. Sorry your moms are so boring.
JUSTNOMIL,fetfcf8,t3_eqfsh9,1579374885.0,"Heck, I'm american born and bred and can barely name all 50 states, sure can't point them out on a map either. Some states honestly aren't that important to know, anyway. I bet she couldn't pass a mock citizenship test!"
fatlogic,fef1u19,t1_fedv5zz,1579046191.0,"Starchy foods like potatoes empty out of your stomach faster, making you hungrier and eat more often. Fat and protein like in meat take a lot longer to digest, making you hungry less often."
ShitMomGroupsSay,feezvnh,t1_feel0gb,1579044901.0,"In some people Tamiflu can cause more symptoms than the flu itself. I was prescribed it once and got a severe headache, was super sweaty, and couldn't get any sleep. Never again."
TumblrInAction,fdxwnqm,t1_fdwhfrs,1578773684.0,"Absolutely no one ""deserves"" sex. Sex is not needed to live and is not owed to anyone, from anyone. If someone wants to have sex, they need to put in the time and effort to make themselves appealing to others. If they are a disgusting slob that no one wants to have sex with, that is their probpem and only their problem. If they don't want to put any effort into finding a partner to have sex with they can go masturbate and continue being unappealing."
gatekeeping,fdi8zn7,t1_fdi11u6,1578437886.0,"I've held the same job for 5 years, I must not have it either. Gonna keep the addy rx tho."
gatekeeping,fdi7jpo,t1_fdhwxfb,1578437136.0,"Adhd isn't a dealbreaker in any career, you just have to learn how to deal with it and make yourself succeed. Not really any jobs where adhd would be a plus, though."
gatekeeping,fdi78bs,t1_fdi3cp0,1578436968.0,"Not really. Adhd can lead to missing social cues and cause some upset in social situations, but doesn't mean you have social anxiety."
clothdiaps,fd9uyuj,t1_fd93wop,1578238379.0,"No, they work the same. However, a proper wash routine doesn't need any boiling or bleaching, the diapers will be squeaky clean out of the washer."
