May I ask what are these overall outcomes that you are happy with? What are the specific situations (i.e. patient financials, patient healthcare, provider costs, insurance costs, etc.) where you are satisfied with that makes you side with privatized healthcare over socialized healthcare?

I wholeheartedly disagree with your statement about there being no improvement in government-controlled healthcare. This is 100% not the case in developed countries with socialized healthcare. If anything, financial incentive is what drives healthcare DOWNWARDS because it incentivizes cost-cutting measures, providing the barely legal minimum amount of care to patients, or simply grift the patient entirely because there is currently little accountability in the American privatized healthcare system."

And that 'charm' is definitely coke-fueled, lol"
TheMandalorianTV,fcglyao,t1_fcgd3rp,1577641558.0,I think it's the gap in skill between Death Troopers and the average stormtrooper that is hilarious for me.

If you're fresh into ESO, it's got plenty of story content to play through. I'm talking hundreds of hours of fully-voiced quest content. Dungeons, Raids, PvP, playing the Markets, etc.

I personally just really like the combat system! The animations are definitely stiff, but the depth makes it fun to explore and being able to solo 90-95% of the game's content is really nice too.

I recently got back into the game after a few years off and man, there are quite a bit to do! I started a character fresh and have just been playing through the base main story again and remember why I liked this game so much!"

She burned and scraped my utensils, stole my stuff and sold them off, go through my Costco block (25+ rolls) of toilet paper in 2 weeks, totaled her car rear-ending someone else, and chronically paid rent late because it's never her fault, so she doesn't have to take responsibility for any of it."

Except it's a suicide cult."
