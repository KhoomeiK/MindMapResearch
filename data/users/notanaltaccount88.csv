UnresolvedMysteries,ff0mvxk,t1_fexllqp,1579470370.0,I was physically sick. I have a 3 year old daughter and thinking of her in any of those situations makes me so fucking sick. That poor baby. Hog tied from the roof? Raped with objects. Burned. Omfg.

cats,felcbf3,t1_felav9k,1579218831.0,He’s very gifted. He’s in piano lessons so he has a good foundation for music but he really doesn’t like the structure of it lol. He has big dreams of being a famous DJ like Marshmello (it’s the only DJ he knows of)
cats,fek7mqn,t1_fek79j8,1579194299.0,"That’s wonderful! Keep encouraging her with it! 

My son is 10 and last year he came home and told me he had a “recital” at a hall the next day but it was “no big deal” so I emailed his music teacher and this kid had been learning to play a whole instrument all year and was showcasing it! So I go and he’s phenomenal, his teacher tells me that he is really gifted in music. 

We bought him a keyboard and he teaches himself to play his favorite songs by ear! I enjoy listening to him mess around but it takes a lot of encouragement from me for him to think it’s a big deal."

instantkarma,fek5s4i,t1_fek5ceu,1579193198.0,"I agree! It really does take a certain special kind of person to work with kids and make a positive impression on them. Kids are chaotic in every aspect of their lives and as adults, we expect them to fit into a mold of what we think a kid should be. Some people understand that kids won’t fit into that mold, and some people see passed the crappy behaviours and know that kids just need someone to support them. Even as a parent I forget that often and find my self telling my kid’s to “knock it off” or “drop the attitude” when it’s just them trying to portray an emotion they are feeling that’s very new to them. 

Thank you to all the teachers, coaches, daycare providers, bus drivers etc who see our kids as people and not as paychecks! There are parents out there that appreciate the crap out of you!!"
instantkarma,fek264z,t1_fej8aj1,1579191012.0,"I have VERY bad anxiety and when my two boys were small and in daycare we had an issue with their daycare provider not providing proper care. It caused me to have panic attacks when dropping them off, when I found this current daycare lady, I immediately knew she loved each child like her own. The boys went to her daycare about 6 years ago, so they were not in her care when this event happened but it only proves what my gut told me; she would fight for my children the same way I would. Her wait list is now two years long!"
instantkarma,fej44mv,t1_fej1e7j,1579156182.0,"She took a group of daycare kids to a park to play, a man approached and he snatched a small child and ran. She screamed and chased after him, he dropped that child and she got all the other kids up on top of the adventure playground. The man came back and in between her kicking him in the face as he tried to get up, he managed to grab a second child off the playground. Daycare lady managed to fight him off that child and scream for all the kids to run to a neighbours house. In that chaos he grabbed a THIRD child and ran with him. Daycare lady chased him down a second time and he refused to let the child go, using her self defence classes she broke his nose and almost blinded him. 
None of the children were harmed physically, daycare lady was very much harmed physically. He got out of jail in a few weeks and sent to another city to a “facility” because he was known to police to have a mental illness and wasn’t taking his medication, therefore didn’t know what he was doing. Also, his lawyer charged daycare lady with “excessive use of force” because they were not sure he’d ever gain vision back in his one eye. Crown (or what ever they are called) threw those charges out immediately. 

The facility is a mental health facility and he can check himself out at any time. Daycare lady received a courage award and strongly suggests self defence classes."

UnresolvedMysteries,feeh3ei,t1_feed5z9,1579033624.0,"I was 25 years old when I gave birth to my second child and was thoroughly convinced that someone was going to try and break into my house and steal my newborn. Every night I would jump at small sounds and couldn’t sleep, it eventually got so bad that 2 YEARS later I was setting booby traps in front of my front door so I could hear an intruder. For 2 YEARS I suffered with post partum Anxiety disorder (PPA) and has no idea because it had NEVER been talked about. I knew it wasn’t PPD, it wasn’t until my husband came home from work on the road and knocked over my tower of canned goods did he say it wasn’t normal and I needed a doctor. 
   Don’t be so quick to judge a woman based on your limited knowledge of these things. Pregnancy is hard physically and psychologically and does not just stop the second you give birth."
UnresolvedMysteries,fec4ucd,t3_eo5vk6,1578966671.0,"When I was 18 I was an avid Nexopia user. I used to “edit” people’s pages for $5 adding different fonts, colours etc. One day this guy pm me asking me to edit his page. So I do but after we started talking and agreed to meet for coffee. I didn’t drive at the time but was used to taking the bus everywhere so I declined his offer of a ride. When we got to the bus stop across from the coffee shop something inside of me screamed for me to stay on the bus. I got up to get off anyways and my stomach was turning so I sat back down and carried on the route to my cousins house instead. I ignored all his messages, embarrassed I stood him up. 2 years later his name and photo are in the paper for murdering girls he met online. I stood up cody legebokoff."

Just a fair warning for others, friends had a dog who LOVED to carry things around and would often grab food wrappers etc and show her people excitedly. They have kids who love to game in the downstairs living room, one day they left a bunch of food wrappers on the coffee table while they all went out for dinner and when they came back, the dog had eaten all the family size chips from the bag. Unfortunately she got her head stuck in the bag and suffocated. They were gone maybe an hour and a half and came home to their best friend gone :(
