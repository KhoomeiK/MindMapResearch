AnimalsBeingDerps,fgdct4u,t1_fgdb8gv,1580681096.0,Correct.  Those needs can only be met by expanded territory.  No amount of catnip and playtime is going to do it (they get plenty of that as well).

insanepeoplefacebook,fgd5sxz,t1_fgcznbo,1580679211.0,"They're not getting tax write-offs because people don't like patronizing establishments that hire the disabled.  They're write-offs because they're not producing the same quality of work as a neurotypical person.

I know people in this situation.  We're talking about people who live off a government disability program, and the government actually cuts off funds if the person makes above a certain threshold.  They typically live with family or in assisted living facilities; their expenses are covered.  When they work it's through an agency that provides a one-on-one supervisor to help them perform the basic tasks of the job, and/or in-house piecework (for those who can't manage outside work even with a coach).  The quality of work produced is not up to minimum wage standards.  Companies are not profiting off them.  In fact, it's not the companies that pay them, the agency does, and programs like these are chronically underfunded.

The alternative to sub-minimum wage is no work at all, and the pride of having a job vs. sitting in a care facility all day is worth it to them."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fgczdfe,t1_fgcnt0f,1580677563.0,"When I get a new cat, my process goes (where "">"" = ""cat in evident prolonged distress that increases over a period of months""): Keep them in all the time > provide access to an enclosed patio > take them out on a leash > supervised outside time in an enclosed area > let them out between late morning and mid-afternoon.  As I said, never at night.

Imagine yourself trapped in a house your entire life.  Cats go stir-crazy too.  In nature they'd have a 1-2 sq mile territory to patrol."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fgcmnmv,t1_fgcfbij,1580674168.0,"I'm for keeping a cat inside as much as their sanity can tolerate.  Some of them just get too stressed when they're cooped up.  Always keep them in at night, though, for their own safety."

I called the cops and we exchanged info and it wasn't too bad of a scrape anyway, but she told me it would be ok and about her daughter having an accident recently, she was really kind.  These things happen, but it feels like shit, so much regret and second-guessing yourself.  A little kindness goes a long way."
