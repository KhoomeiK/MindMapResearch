Apparently someone in the building that day hadn't followed the rules regarding infectious material, they just figured it out, and my friend's Dad was at risk of exposure due to being in the lab that day.  Since I had a meal he had direct contact with in cooking, they tested everyone at that meal (friend's family + me.)

While in there, they went full Sherlock Holmes on me asking me what I touched that night, when I washed my hands, how hot the temperature was, if I used the soap bottle, basically running through all my habits, good and bad for the next 24 hours, just to close the loop.  Then they still tested my parents for good measure.

Edit: This just reminded me of the legendary way my father got himself in the doghouse with my Mom from this event.  My friend's parents called my parents to apologize for the trouble, if they had known they wouldn't have had me for dinner that day, yadda yadda.  My Dad was pretty chill over it, because he worked in a field with similar concerns, just chemical, not biological.  My friend's parents said they'd understand if my parents didn't want me going over for dinner anymore, to which my Dad said, ""Even if it was infected, still more edible than the food he usually gets for dinner.""

If you do not earn your professional license within 5 years (requires teaching for at least one full year), then you have to go through an entirely NEW teacher preparation program.  Worse yet, the way some education preparation program are built, this can sometimes require an entirely new bachelors.

Time will teach you that gaming isn't something to flog yourself with as punishment for your brother's passing, but a way to connect with him even when he's gone.

.... This is not what makes a strop a strop.  Denim and leather are used as strops, hell, ***balsa wood*** is used as a strop, and yet you claim it's because 'cardboard is much more abrasive than wood.'

A strop is merely the lowest-abrasive surface (or in other terms, the finest surface) used in the process of sharpening, working off any burrs left by sharpening stones and straightening extremely fine blades that don't need a full round of sharpening / after daily use.

And by that definition, your point is inherently disproven, as strops are a ***mild*** abrasive, then cardboard can't be as abrasive as you claim.  Ultimately that's irrelevant however, as you don't strop with the glue of cardboard, you would strop with the surface, which is a paper/linen, but again, denim and leather are infinitely better.

Special Ed is in massive demand, whether working with high-needs exclusive population or mainstream support / co-teaching.  You will have no trouble finding a position in even the most competitive districts.  

Additionally, for the state of Colorado, once you have your ***first*** teaching license / endorsement from a University, all that it takes to get a second endorsement is passing the content exam.  To use myself as an example, I got my first endorsement in Technology Education via an Engineering Degree.  But then, I took the exams for Math and Science, getting certified in both, without having a degree in either.  Getting an added English / Language Arts endorsement would be fairly trivial, needing at most a bit of brush up on the du jour literature used in education.

> health insurance, retirement

Teacher benefits have taken a pretty significant hit over the last 15 years in Colorado.  Regarding health insurance, you'll find that depending on district, your own personal health insurance will either be outright covered, or cost up to $100 a month, fairly competitive with industry, decent copays, HSP if you desire, etc.  Family care is what really got gutted.  Teaching used to have great family benefits, now, family health coverage starts at $1000 a month *after* your district's contributions.  I know an unhealthy amount of colleagues for whom the joke goes: ""I pay the insurance, my spouse pays the rest of the bills.""  Compared to finance and STEM careers, this is abysmal family coverage.  Compared to hospitality industry, I don't know.

Regarding retirement.  PERA, the state pension, *has* always been strong.  I'm not sure how to qualify it at this point, but to put it succinctly, they managed to lose over a billion dollars in last year's stellar economy.  Right now retirees and pension members are extraordinarily concerned about the fund's management.  PERA has always been stable.  The current general rule is that for every 10 years you work, you get 25% of the average of your 5 highest years of salary, up to a maximum 87.5% (meaning there is no financial benefit to working full-time after 35 years unless it is drastically changing your highest-average-salary (HAS)).  All things considered, this is a pretty great pension.  Districts are feeling the pinch right now however, as due to fund mismanagement, the State is forcing all districts to contribute an extra 3.5%.  2% comes from the district, 1.5% comes from your salary, and like it or not, you better believe the district will make up that 2% by not supporting future pay raises.  This is overall leading to a standoff at the state level about teacher pay, as ultimately, the state is to blame for poor education funding and poor PERA fund management, not the districts, who for the large part have been working their hardest in a shitty situation.  

All in all, don't put all your eggs into one basket with your pension.  Your pension contribution will take out about 25% more from your paycheck than social security would have all said and done.  You'll want to contribute to a Roth IRA / 403b  independently, to have some fallback options.  35 years is a long ways away, and while everyone ***says*** PERA is stable, I'm sure you could travel back in time to the 1970's and not a soul in Detroit would have told you their pensions would go belly up in the 2000's.  Plan ahead.

> union dues and are the unions out here a good resource?

Decent question!  I think about the union so little despite being a $50+ hit to my paycheck every month.  It's so worth it I don't even think twice, however.  Unions will cost you anywhere from $30-$70 depending on district.  Yes, it's a cost, especially when you're a new teacher, but just do it.  Think of it like taxes that pay for fire protection or homeowner's insurance.  Just because *you* haven't needed it lately doesn't mean they haven't done tremendous, valuable work.  Just like the firemen tear down dead tree branches hanging above power lines, or do controlled burns to make sure brushfires don't start, the union has been advocating for your compensation and benefits.  In my district, it has reaped significant rewards that I can't thank them enough for.  Would I like to get paid more?  Sure, show me what teacher wouldn't.  

Full Disclosure:  During your first three years of teaching in any district, the union has essentially zero power to help you.  You are considered a probationary teacher who can be released for any reason, at any time.  This sucks, but it is the district's 'trial period.'  Once you make it to your 4th year in any Colorado district, you become 'non-propationary' or 'continuing.'  This means you can only be fired if the district demonstrably proves you are an ineffective teacher.  You have significant more protections, and the union can protect you much more here.  I still joined my union the first three years.  While they couldn't directly support me in many ways, indirectly they supported me in many others.  I also got some decent discounts out of it, got hooked into a great resource for my first 403b, and their union social events were how I started meeting some people in the community which I was new to.

Not every union in Colorado is as good as I think mine is, so to a varying degree, this is a personal judgment call.  Douglas County School District managed to decertify their union, so that district has been hurting for compensation, benefits, and legal protection for years.  They technically have a union that operates on the side, but no collective bargaining.  

One last important bit about the union I forgot - mine provides a nifty $1,000,000 insurance liability policy while I'm in the classroom.  This is pretty clutch for me as a shop teacher, as the spectre of student injury is always hanging over my head.  But it's also nice to have if/when false accusations fly by, or whenever a legal hand is needed."

In regards to local politics, JeffCo just recently came out of some pretty bad years with their Board of Education.  The majority of their board was recalled three years ago due to utter villainy.

I'm not sure where you live, but you'll be riding pretty bare bones for the first 5 years if you're teaching on the Front Range, and you'll pretty much need a spouse, inheritance, or 10+ years in district to get even close to affording a home.  I'm a 5th year with a masters and my salary is just enough to buy a 1 bedroom condo, nothing more.

Despite the pay issues, I have always found education incredibly fulfilling.  Recognize that you'll be heading into an almost equally congested sector.  English teachers are in surplus, as that is the catch-all for most humanities majors when they go into teaching.  You stand a better chance of marketing yourself if you focus on ELS (English Language Support - teaching students with educational or learning disabilities) or ESL (English as a Second Language) - both of these are in tremendous demand in Colorado.

What jobs are available for new grads are typically positions you will not find yourself wanting to stay in, unless you have a tremendous resume or be in the right place at the right time.  Many teachers find themselves in Title I schools or schools with administrative deficiencies that can make the first job tough, leading to burnout.  If you can fight through this, or get an ideal placement, then it is truly wonderful and enriching, personally.

**My #1 Recommendation:** Start tutoring.  Market yourself as a tutor for reading/writing, or apply for a part-time job at a tutoring center.  Many, many teachers go into education with the thought that they love it, and their first classroom experience or interaction with children is a very sudden, unpleasant wakeup call.  This is not something that you want to go to school for 12-18 months before discovering (much like Nurses finding out 24 months into their program that they can't handle blood!).  Do your best to place yourself in situations where you have the authentic opportunity to teach.  Summer camps are also ideal for this.

Lastly, I haven't looked at the Language-Arts tracks, but Colorado is so hard-up for teachers, there are special master's programs at University of Denver and Metropolitan State University that can get you your master's in education and your license within 12 months.  As you came from hospitality, I don't know if this would apply to you, but it is DEFINITELY worth checking out, to save yourself time and money.

Last but not least - Colorado has been on a downward trend since the last recession, and the next decade is looking pretty bleak for the state (think Kansas or North Carolina).  Since the recession, the State is now underfunding education by nearly 1 billion per year according to constitutional requirements.  Through some of the most impressive legal gymnastics I've ever seen, the Supreme Court ruled that states, which are traditionally required to have balanced budgets, can write an IOU.  At this point that IOU is worth a little over 7 billion.  Education has become so catastrophically underfunded in the state, that over half of all districts are only open 4 days a week.  A new piece of legislation up for debate this semester, if approved, may put the final nail in the coffin, lowering funding even further (10%), to the point that affluent metro districts are on the verge of bankruptcy.  On the plus side, Colorado has elected entirely blue last election, but there's still some shitheels in the state Senate.

Edit:  Just some data here:  The [average teacher starting salary in Colorado](http://www.nea.org/home/2017-2018-average-starting-teacher-salary.html) is $33,300 in 2017-2018.  Now, you'll be coming in with a masters, with is typically a $5,000 pay raise across the board, increasing with longevity.  This means you'd be averaging $38,300 your first year.  Metro districts will pay more - you can expect to see $43,000, but rural districts will pay much less, as low as $32,000 again.  If you divide that by your working hours (not including overtime, at home grading, etc etc), you're looking at $21.62 an hour, starting."
