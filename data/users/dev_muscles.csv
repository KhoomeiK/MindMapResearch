Peace u f***"
cscareerquestions,fcofbv4,t1_fcn6big,1577830863.0,"You just don’t care about people’s health or fitness do you ? How health/fitness not related to CS career? As a person who’s in CS career, my fitness matters to me and it is related to my career because it is impacted by my career since they both compete for my attention and priority? Do you see the relation ? You ought to be able to follow simple logic as science major."
cscareerquestions,fckmtsu,t1_fcj71dy,1577728740.0,I don’t see 1 and 2 as problems. 3 is easily fixable by finding a new gym or using barbells

selfimprovement,fcgtgwa,t3_eh5iqd,1577643858.0,"Find something that you are intensely interested in and get insanely good at it. That will give you the meaning you are looking for. Are you interested in Art ? Literature ? Painting ? Public Speaking ? Find what you are interested in and follow that interest and see where that takes you. Life is not about hobbies or friends or socializing. You need to find your interests, passions and apply yourself every single day, master them and offer that mastery as value to others.

You are young as fuck and have not realized how long life is yet. Look up Jordan Peterson and watch his content a little, it might do wonders, it did for me back in the day.

I wish you best of luck, don't ever give up, life is long and your journey is yet to start. But it won't start until you find what your meaning in life is, you need to try multiple things and see what resonates with you."
selfimprovement,fcgrnh3,t3_eh6wc2,1577643377.0,""" Why did it take me so long to understand that achieving anything worthwhile requires persistence"". I think this because as young people we fail to realize how long life actually is and we are only concerned about save the day which makes us come up with short term solutions thus short term results. Be in it for the long term brother, don't fucking give up and be a better man each day then you are yesterday. Stop watching other people or TV show characters and start watching your own show, your own life. 

I wish you luck, I think most of us have been where you were but realizing that persistence is the key is the start of something great."
Entrepreneur,fcgquni,t3_eh6o7f,1577643067.0,"I found his content on YouTube and found to be very high quality and no BS in any sense. I didn't however, have taken his Program. I also don't see the usefulness in calling someone a Scam artist. He obviously is a successful person and good at selling. 

I have been a part of some other programs and have seen people not succeed and I will tell you why. Most people are lazy f\*\*\*s and wouldn't execute, they give up easy, they are hurt easily by rejection and are looking for easy fixes. They have no value to offer and instead of building themselves as a person they think they can make money without having some value to offer. In any program like this, I think it is reasonable to apply 80%, 20% rule. You will see only 20% of the people in these programs getting 80% of the success and out of that 20%, 20% of that 20% will have great success.

What I don't agree with is the lack of screening. If I ever had a program, I would screen those who I know to be lazy and are not interested in building value and tell them they are not suited for success. 

Again, I think it is unreasonable to blame the guy who is OBVIOUSLY good at selling, successful and has tons of content on YouTube for free that is no BS.

Peace."

selfimprovement,fccbn40,t3_egxxh1,1577596556.0,"I don't see a problem. Talk to those that you are compelled to talk to. If you are compelled to talk to someone but you just won't because you have social anxiety now that is problem. I generally keep to myself and get stuff done in my life that I think is productive to my desired outcomes. Don't be one of those who talk just to talk. Talk when you feel like it and if you don't feel like it, the last thing you should do is to talk. Silence is more effective than words in most cases. peace"
selfimprovement,fcca8pw,t3_egzkdy,1577596104.0,"Thank you for doing this man. This is what I have as a problem: I have been trying multiple things, trying to find what I'm destined to do and it's been hell of a ride. This year especially I have focused on developing myself as a person and improving as much as possible but more I improve more I realize there is so much more for me to do to become the valuable person that others would benefit from. I won't stop growing and my only problem is always the question ""Am I doing the right thing, Am I using my time the most efficient way ?"""
confidence,fcc923n,t3_eg75m4,1577595745.0,"Start practicing not giving a fuck. You care about what others think of you and you constantly compare yourself to others. Understand that you are unique and there is no one like you. Maybe record videos of yourself and watch yourself from another persons view. Try to understand you are unique as fuck and no one can take that away from you. Be more of you, not someone else. Embrace your true identity, otherwise this problem of yours will never go away. You will never be as good a copy of someone else as you could be you."
confidence,fcc8ng0,t3_egus6i,1577595620.0,"I have an advice that I use. Record yourself in a video where you talk about something you are passionate about, your current day, maybe goals, problems etc. Be fully yourself and then watch the videos looking at this person talking. What is he like ? What does he convey through his communication ? Do I like this person ? What should he improve on ? This is I must warn can be a tough thing to do because most people dislike themselves too much but I found it to be very helpful and in time I came to realize I'm a person with real problems, goals, dreams. And that person is someone that I respect and like. It takes time tho, be patient."
confidence,fcc86pp,t3_egzxo5,1577595479.0,"I used to be the same. When you talk too much people often lose respect in you. What I suggest is self awareness. Think to yourself, am I adding any value by saying anything right at this moment or am I just talking to talk. Through this process you will start saying less. Other people might make comments as you change, disregard their notice and press onward."
Entrepreneur,fcc7vp8,t3_egth8u,1577595383.0,I'm doing that right now and it is nice to reach out to your niche. I think the question is : How many clients you'd have to get through LinkedIn Premium to justify that price.
Entrepreneur,fcc7nou,t3_egz715,1577595311.0,"I tried that once and I think optimizing your house (assuming you work alone anyway) is much more productive. I found shared office spaces to have problems often such as internet, loud people, distraction etc."
confidence,fc7m4ol,t3_egl6m9,1577511945.0,"Start going to the gym and get stronger. Look up starting strength and get as strong as you can get. That’s 1. 2 start going out and approach people, start slow by just saying hello then try to keep conversations going. It’s not easy work but you won’t get anywhere by contemplating on this shit. YOU NEED TO TAKE RADICAL ACTION. Go out, hit the gym, talk to people, force yourself to talking to people. 3. If you can afford, get a confidence or a social skills coach. Because I have a feeling you can use some help. What you need is RADICAL ACTION and not fucking reddit. Peace."
Entrepreneur,fc314a8,t3_efx4wn,1577379066.0,"Man, I'm trying to start my own thing and I'm absolutely crushed under stress and time that I'm putting into making it work. I think there is a time period where you are learning, adjusting and changing so that you can polish your offer and your skills around presenting that offer. It takes a long time and I'm hoping I see the other side. I think it'd be helpful to stop working after some hours to ensure quality sleep. When I work until 11PM, it takes me a good 2/3 hours to wind down and get ready to sleep. I feel your pain OP, don't give up."
