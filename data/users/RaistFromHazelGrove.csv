Hey, it’s one of the reasons Christians are looked down on. Keep on flinging all that hate.

Do the people who worship with you know that you wouldn’t be admitted into heaven or do you keep that to yourself like a shameful secret?"
TopMindsOfReddit,fcb410k,t1_fcazn8r,1577582062.0,"No, what we’re saying is that the tiny amount of racism you’ve experienced (one teacher?! Oh the horror!) is only a tiny fraction of what others experience. I’ve been fired for my minority status but there was no recourse because no one believed me.

It must suck to have all the social power and still have to hear some words that made you feel icky. I wish that was the extent I had to deal with bigotry. That’s why we mock you. Imagine having that teacher as friends, bosses, coworkers, every day without fail and you might be able to empathize.

Instead you claim it’s extreme racism when you have to feel any tiny pushback."
TopMindsOfReddit,fcaynb2,t1_fc9wf29,1577579214.0,"And the “so happy I live in North Dakota” actually has a clause on the end they usually refuse to say: “and I’m so glad that my state’s deficit is handled by the blue states and their surplus.”

Hate on California as much as you want, but don’t forget it’s my taxes that ensure places like Kentucky can continue being hellholes with no consequences. It’s like when people talk about being happy with a California secession; they won’t be happy as soon as budget day comes."
TopMindsOfReddit,fcay1ri,t1_fcax98u,1577578870.0,"That’s correct, those only exist in your mind."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fcaxs0d,t1_fcaj656,1577578718.0,But that’s factually incorrect.
TopMindsOfReddit,fcax4hv,t1_fca1k3v,1577578349.0,"It’s not. At all. I grew up with Dominionists (the ones who wanna take over the world in a Christian theocracy) and, if you censored their specific mentions of their god/religion’s name, ISIS and Christian evangelicals would get along just fine. My (Christian) church included curfews for girls (but not boys), mandated head coverings for girls, included arranged marriages, definitely included training against the enemy, and many other things that would be called extremist if they were done in any other country.

These are the people who would cheer at Gilead from Handmaid’s Tale becoming reality."

> But when I see black people now, I'm catching myself thinking ""are they going to hate me for being white? I should probably avoid them."" And it's honestly because of mindsets like the one held by this sub.

Must be tough to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes. Usually it builds empathy, but you’ve manage to hate the original owner instead."
SubredditDrama,fcavksm,t1_fcasvjp,1577577469.0,Yeah. Why would you want to enable and encourage racism and bigotry? Age isn’t an excuse either.
politics,fc9kldd,t1_fc90gos,1577554051.0,"No, it’s about dancing. “Jesus stepped.”"
politics,fc9f62a,t1_fc9d1pi,1577551772.0,"It’s because they isolated his mic to make it seem like it was a deranged or ultra passionate scream when it was just him getting the crowd riled up.

I feel bad that I fell for that. It seems like a lifetime ago that Howard Dean and swiftboating was a thing."
TopMindsOfReddit,fc7k2l7,t1_fc6eogz,1577509944.0,"They claim it’s “rigged” because no Republican can get voted in. No, we in the cities just remember how not even 20 years ago the republicans had driven us into a huge deficit and allowed things like the Enron scandal.

It isn’t that it’s “rigged,” it’s that republicans ruin our cities and municipal policies and we can see it. The few places that are still conservative hold outs are either owners who have been there forever or farming communities (despite republicans screwing them too)."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fc7jo3v,t1_fc6u85s,1577509561.0,"I mean, no, based on visuals the earth is round."

politics,fc6pxwz,t1_fc6n7bp,1577486523.0,I wouldn’t give him a kudos for repeating an interpretation that doesn’t have any historical backing.
facepalm,fc6pmgv,t1_fc6p92x,1577486296.0,"But school was no less difficult when women weren’t allowed in, so why use that as a hyperbolic reference?

It’s like me saying “driving tests are hard, can’t we go back to when medicine was just blood letting and herbs?”"
facepalm,fc6oena,t1_fc6m8ie,1577485428.0,What’s the joke?
FragileWhiteRedditor,fc6iebc,t1_fc64bat,1577481306.0,You also have to be careful of eye damage from extreme eye rolling.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fc5ibzh,t1_fc5dgpe,1577458397.0,"I just do not understand bragging about that.

“Yeah, if society were filled with people like me, we’d still be living in caves afraid of constant murder. Lol!”

And then they’re surprised when they can’t have more than a surface level relationship with people."
worldpolitics,fc5g57s,t1_fc5ds5c,1577456635.0,So he’s paying someone to guard him from an imaginary enemy? The metaphor is real.
worldpolitics,fc5fubh,t1_fc5eiyh,1577456382.0,It’s super obvious when they lie. “I just post on the biggest Trump safe space and also post about how much I hate minorities and women. I’m not a Republican! I just hang out in their spaces and say the same things they do!”
worldpolitics,fc5fkxa,t1_fc5995g,1577456158.0,"Man, after all those investigations about this wrongdoing, she must be in prison for a long time.

Wait, no - those investigations showed that there wasn’t enough wrongdoing for a conviction. Whereas Trump’s didn’t.

Oh well, maybe try again next time."
worldpolitics,fc5f661,t1_fc5ck2p,1577455802.0,"Sounds like a level head to me. You know, noticing the obvious crimes and noticing how evil he is. Seems really deranged to disagree with reality, so I guess I’d agree, TDS is real; supporters that stick to a known criminal *have to be* deranged, right?"
politics,fc47t7y,t1_fc47cj8,1577408945.0,"We still have racism in the cities, it just has to be a slightly different flavor.

Still there though."
politics,fc45guv,t1_fc44bfa,1577407134.0,"Seriously. Republicans can’t complain about anything done just for PR but technically within the rules. They spent 6 years (Obama’s first two they didn’t have majority) doing absolutely nothing but obstructing everything.

Fuck em, they deserve every turn of this wheel."
