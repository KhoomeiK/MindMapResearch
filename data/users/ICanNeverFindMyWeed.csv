I left Christianity too, because I just kept thinking that Jesus would be hanging with the ""outcasts"", because he was cool like that. He would be visiting prisons, welcoming immigrants, and giving all of his love to everyone equally. 

The only time Jesus got righteously angry was when folks were using the church for the wrong purpose. I think your church is doing that too.

You have a lot of anger that you need to vent, but I respectfully ask that you never let them see any of it. You'll be ok without them. I'm willing to bet there's a church around that will accept your whole family as you are. If not, start one in your living room... or just take your kid to an Ani Defranco concert and soak up all the good gay vibes.

I apologize for being sappy about this. I think the reason why it hit me so hard was due to a similar/not similar circumstance in my own life. 

One of my college roommates was an artist. She did this deceptively simple painting that I loved. I stood in front of that painting many times for a long time trying figure out what I was seeing. She was smart to let me make my own interpretation. All at once it dawned on me one day that this was a painting in a surreal form of her best friend's suicide. I gasped when it hit me and cried for her pain. 

Her best friend had killed herself when she was 13 by shotgun blast intentionally. Her best friend was her next door neighbor. Then her father died of cancer shortly after. There had always been this aura of sadness about her. I'd learned the story before I saw the painting, so there was so much depth there.

That's my overshare for the day.

I hope you feel better."
