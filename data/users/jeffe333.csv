If your employer isn't going to take this seriously, force them to take this seriously.  Finally, I would seek legal counsel in order to represent you in a claim against your employer.  They have an obligation to protect you from workplace harassment and sexual violence, and they are quite likely in breach of that.  

I would also start looking for a new job.  This is clearly no place for you, or anyone for that matter, to be working.  If they're unwilling to protect you from something like this, I wouldn't want to imagine how much worse it could get.  I wish you the best of luck resolving this."

It speaks volumes of you as a person, and to do so at such a young age is really remarkable.  You should be incredibly proud of yourself.  Well-done!

To piggyback off some of the other advice offered, you might consider asking Lauren specific questions that will require her to answer w/ more than single-word responses.  For instance, if she says that name of a character from a movie, such as Captain America, you could say, ""Oh, I liked Avengers: Endgame, too.  I thought that it was sad what happened to some of the characters that we'd watched all these years, though.  What did you like about the movie?""  Open-ended questions such as this will hopefully elicit more verbose responses from her.

You also might consider what caused her to draw back.  Was there a particular interaction between the two of you that you believe may have caused her reticence?  Did she possibly see something from some of the other students, or did someone potentially say something to her, that caused this?  Is it possible that she's having difficulties at home?  There could be multiple contributory factors.  You might get further simply by asking her?  You could just say that you miss having more in-depth conversations w/ her, and that it's all right for her to open up to you.  If she realizes that you're her friend, you're on her side, and she can trust you, she might be comfortable tell you why she's withdrawn.

Any way it shakes out, I really hope that it works out for the both of you.  I hope that you make it back this way to let it know how everything turns out.  Be well, faithybird, and good luck!"

When you first inquired regarding the speech in the video, the way that I inferred it was that you were unable to locate the volume control, and when you asked again, you didn't mention being hearing-impaired, so I, again, assumed wrongly that it had to do w/ the volume control.  

I just wanted you to know that there was no malicious intent, as the other user implied.  I would never do that.  If I had realized what you were asking, I would have happily transcribed the speech from the video for you.  

I'm quite active in this community on a regular basis, and I try to be as helpful as possible.  If users create posts searching for help for one topic or another, I'll often take time to search for answers from reliable sources of information, and write up guidelines for them to follow, so they can get started in the right direction.  I do this for other similarly based subs, as well.  I think that it's important.

Frankly, when that other user accused me of being inappropriate, I took great umbrage, b/c I find it offensive that someone would mock or treat as less than someone else, just b/c they have a disability.  It's not right, and It's not something I would ever do.  I wanted to clarify my stance on that.

For future reference, I will be mindful that when users ask about that sound in videos in this, and similar, subs, they may very well be referring to hearing impairments.  Again, you have my apologies.  There was no offense intended.  It was simply an incorrect inference on my part."
