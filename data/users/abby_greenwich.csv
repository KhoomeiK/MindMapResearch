ACL,fdb58wz,t1_fdb3uno,1578253965.0,"I had a hamstring autograft, no meniscus damage luckily. After I had a recheck and my dressing was undone I kept a compression sleeve on over the steri-strips and having less padding helped me feel the coldness more!  I kept the machine and wrap on my leg for the first 4 days non-stop.  Wrap was off on day 3.   I think the ice helps my pain for sure.  Definitely felt less with the padding but I think it helped!  I plan on using it in the future too. Now I do about 4x a day a minimum of 30 minutes.  Mostly for swelling but also pain!
Hope your recovery is going well!!!"

I agree, a strong support system is so important!  I hate not being able to get up and help with the pets or the house but he's a trooper and hasnt complained!
I hope all is well with your recovery too!"
