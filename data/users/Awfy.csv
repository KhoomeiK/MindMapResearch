Technically cammer would be trying to squeeze him out rather than the other way around. This is clearly a zipper merge lane, so cammer must yield to the car in front at the merge point.

I just can’t see how the cammer can be in the right at all here. They were tailgating, overly aggressive during a legal zipper merge, and actively made contact with another car when they didn’t need to. The car that was hit doesn’t seem to have done anything wrong other than be first to the end of the zipper merge before cammer."

2. Use sensors around your place to trigger specific lights when you enter/exit rooms. Similarly, using the location of your phone you can automatically have all the relevant lights turned on before you've even reached your front door.

3. Set up ""scenes"" for different things you do in your apartment. If I'm cooking in my kitchen I want a lot of light so there's a scene for cooking.

dankmemes,fgh1pnr,t1_fggw8et,1580774601.0,"Agreed, but this is the wrong way to do it. You regulate on minimum expectations from device performance. That means consumers are guaranteed a performant device within their region. You don't regulate how that performance is provided because that's harder to allow adaptions and improvements to come into existence. If micro USB was mandated on all phones before USB-C was invented, we'd all be stuck with micro USB right now because USB-C has literally no way to enter the market or be developed.

This isn't US vs. Europe, this is understanding how technology is developed and improved on. I'm very much in favor of companies being regulated to ensure consumer safety and financial protections are in place, they make complete sense. But we have to be careful in the pursuit of those ideals we don't prevent improvements to the products coming into existing due to us being unable to adapt as fast as technology can.

To put it simply, governments often can't keep up with the pace of demands from society or technology which can often mean we suffer as a whole. We need to regulate in a way which enables us to also improve on whatever we try to standardize, otherwise we trap ourselves."

The only reason we even have USB-C on the market for them to make the standard is because it was developed on the backs of these companies and the existing technology. If micro USB had been standardized, your phone today wouldn't have USB-C even on the list of possibilities since the standard would have prevented it from even entering into existence.

I love hearing their stories about how the drive was in them since they’re not your usual cars. More often than not they’ll follow a route I tell them too as well to get most out of the car for the time they have it.
technology,ffjcsg8,t1_ffijd2s,1579995571.0,Credit cards are accepted in so many places carrying cash is pointless. The rare occasion you’d need cash is so unlikely it’s not worth carrying it with you any other time. It’s 2020 not the 1990s.
PS4,fff9tqe,t1_ffdlefz,1579879232.0,I just happened to get a PlayStation back in the day and was so used to the controller by the time the Xbox was released that I’ve never made the switch. I’d be consider brand loyal but only due to my own laziness to learn a different controller layout. I’m definitely not running around bashing competitors or bigging up PlayStation.
unpopularopinion,ffe7f7i,t1_ffdj9zi,1579838717.0,I taught myself web design in my early teens.
unpopularopinion,ffd34y0,t1_ffc4a3k,1579812488.0,"Yup. I left home at 16 because I wanted to enter the job market since I had offers on the table. So I left high school, moved countries, and started my first job. It was hard and I had to learn as I went but if someone tried to tell me I couldn’t do that simply because I was 16 I’d be so confused. Just because other 16 year olds can’t do something doesn’t mean I should be prevented from doing it by law. I hate that sort of shit. Parents are responsible for their children’s development, if they fucked up to where their 16 year old is incapable of surviving on their own then they should be blamed not some group of kids that happen to be the same age.

I’m 29 now and plan to raise my kids to be independent and self taught. As soon as you have those two skills, which can be learnt at a very early age, life is so much easier. The more we baby and protect kids the more they’re gonna need to raise these artificial age limits due to our own inability to look after kids."
Whatcouldgowrong,ffco8kv,t1_ffb6dog,1579803671.0,"I know all my close family’s birthdays and I don’t even live at home or particularly celebrate birthdays. It’s such an easy thing to remember about a loved one that there’s no real excuse for not remembering, like you said.

But I’m a guy, so anyone trying to explain it as a gender thing is misguided."
Whatcouldgowrong,ffcnnzr,t1_ffbk5m3,1579803318.0,This is another reason why you should still make them random with a password manager. I’ve never actually answered those questions with a real answer.

Audi,ff9tb1y,t3_esdvky,1579720800.0,"I actually dislike analog gauges. They make a car instantly feel old and behind the times. Just like today’s digital gauges will in about 5 years time. I’d still prefer a 5 year old digital gauge than any analog gauge though.

After having analog gauges in my two previous cars, it’s nice to have full digital gauges in my current cars. Really excited to see where digital gauges go in the coming years too as manufacturers try to win the cockpit battle."

AdviceAnimals,ff9snq8,t1_ff9pnsc,1579720379.0,According to the Commonwealth Fund the NHS ranks above all the other Europe healthcare systems. So it likely depends on the methodology you use to rank them.
Dashcam,ff9cdok,t1_ff8xdd0,1579709792.0,They’re altering the wiring of your car which can lead to electrical fires when done incorrectly which are far riskier on more expensive cars with complex wiring.
Autos,ff8rw0j,t1_ff7irea,1579693651.0,It’s always the car guys who suck at taking pictures of cars.
assholedesign,ff8o5gd,t1_ff8dhki,1579688423.0,15 years later from what I can work out. That was a cable included in a product sold in the mid-2000s.
assholedesign,ff8nvv2,t1_ff8egw4,1579688023.0,They are also arguably the driving force for USB-C since their adoption really makes an impact in terms of consumer use. The fact the phones are lagging behind is just a symptom of the lightning connector being ahead of its time long before USB-C came about.
AdviceAnimals,ff8not3,t1_ff8kdbl,1579687722.0,"Spain isn't even the most far reaching or cheapest healthcare in Europe either. The NHS is absolutely mind blowing what they achieve (arguably the world's single greatest healthcare, even though Brits like to believe otherwise) yet if you live in Scotland there's pretty much zero out of pocket expense at any point in the process, including prescriptions."
Dashcam,ff8d8i3,t1_ff7j9b3,1579673673.0,Guarantee most of that is to cover their insurance cost. I know a lot of shops won’t hardwire dashcams in cars over a certain value due to the liability insurance required. I had to drive quite a bit out of town to find a shop to install it in my cars.
todayilearned,ff8cfta,t1_ff7ndya,1579672838.0,It can’t be since one is reversible and the other isn’t.
Audi,ff8b67i,t1_ff8awi6,1579671564.0,Sad news is SF salaries don’t really allow you to own such cars. For me it was purely down to luck of holding stock in a company that succeeded far beyond what I could have ever of thought when I joined them in my early twenties.
Audi,ff8b22p,t1_ff8awac,1579671452.0,"Yeah, just unfortunate about the vividness of the blacks in Audi’s. I get the sense once they fix the screen it’ll be like the jump from 720p to 1080p and we’ll feel odd using the old density."
Audi,ff8awo2,t1_ff88alk,1579671307.0,We’ve not had true analog gauges since the 90s though. Anything after that has those bad LED displays.
