securityguards,ffik9p9,t1_ffijhst,1579975884.0,The amount of times you misspell your main subject matter here is bothering me sir. Vag-rants... If you break it down we can have all sorts of fun with it.
PublicFreakout,ffcp9ag,t3_esra0c,1579804294.0,Ahh. The old muppet show.
PublicFreakout,ffbhaqt,t3_esejzx,1579765269.0,Bra... Minor.  Lol. Chee
ToyotaTacoma,ff4nb6b,t1_ff4clxr,1579567774.0,How are you still on about this dude? Sorry you cant handle the truth.
PublicFreakout,ff2575v,t3_er54qf,1579494128.0,Where was that fuckin teacher before the big kid stepped up?
PublicFreakout,ff1o33h,t3_eqz4t7,1579482415.0,Lol. Synchronized headbanging can surely generate a good amount of force. Poor kid looks like he's genuinely worried.
ToyotaTacoma,fez5xmy,t3_eqr9h2,1579454106.0,Haha. One hell of a spotter you got there. Also that looks like some challenging wheeling. Slippery stuff can be quite the task.
ToyotaTacoma,fewiepj,t3_eqq21x,1579411161.0,Sweet pic! The newer gen definitely makes it look more futuristic. All those cool blue lights.
PublicFreakout,fevq0af,t3_eqfny7,1579400087.0,Damnit Panza. He's not a bad dude. Just has some bad habits like this.
PublicFreakout,fep2qxh,t3_eq4ilm,1579310828.0,"
Welp. He does sound almost like a lil cholo. And it does look a lil like the VL sign homes."
ToyotaTacoma,feovigx,t1_femsafz,1579306310.0,"Yup that is the ticket. Not any vehicle will last as long or be as reliable with normal maintenance and not have as many mechanical issues as a Toyota, for the most part. Why you mad? Lol"
ToyotaTacoma,fel6ct7,t1_fekr44u,1579215014.0,You can definitely get a new one for 1500 to 3000.
ToyotaTacoma,fel4en2,t1_fel1d0u,1579213820.0,"Yea no. Why cant you just admit that Toyota is more reliable and lasts longer. It's the truth. Sure there are other old cars being driven. But with regular maintenance, toyotas have a track record of lasting longer with less things breaking in between."
ToyotaTacoma,fel0itl,t1_fekl5xv,1579211448.0,I'm not brand loyal actually. This is my first toyota. It's just a matter of fact. Also this is Hawaii. It's even more noticeable here.
ToyotaTacoma,fekgvsj,t1_fekaslz,1579199787.0,Oh lucky I dont do instagram. Toyota is not similar though. They've been proven to be more reliable and last longer than other vehicles made the same time. I still see a lot of old Toyotas going that was made in the 90s. Not as many domestics 90 vehicles going as long and as hard. You should know this if you own many.

ToyotaTacoma,fehb0vb,t1_fehaj2x,1579112855.0,"The 2008 supposed to have had them instead of the TRAC system. I think if your rear diff had the add LSD oil sticker, you do. Also you could check with giving your vin to you dealer. But sounds like you changed it out already? Have fun! Lol"
ToyotaTacoma,fehabcj,t3_ep3yuc,1579112433.0,Didn't they come with mechanical limited slip until 2009?

news,fe6yyfs,t1_fe6y4n4,1578907856.0,How does execution laws help with order if that's the case? Maintaining order has to do with victims and their family it's part of the process.
news,fe6xpmw,t3_envsho,1578907393.0,If he is on death row for murder which I think is always the case? I dont think they should have the right to choose how they die. Their murder victim did not. Real justice is fair.
news,fe6xbv8,t1_fe5yz3b,1578907152.0,"If you were the spouse or close family of a murdered victim, would you feel that is fair justice? If you were murdered, would you feel that is justice? To kill them in the most human way with the least amount of pain, or incarceration with no probation?"
PublicFreakout,fe6vq8o,t1_fe2l357,1578906247.0,Would never have know that it was a cop if I didn't read comments. Wow. Is this America? How is he not shot if so? Madness
iamatotalpieceofshit,fe6b8j6,t1_fe5vhnf,1578886016.0,"Sadly if departments actually did this there would be only a few people in them. The good ones who dont say anything in fear of losing their jobs or getting demoted are in the minority here. The culture is changing but it'll take a bit more time and a lot more courageous ones to stand up for this change to happen. Also, it helps that things are recorded these days. So if you see something, record and report."
todayilearned,fdtuar8,t1_fdtan9v,1578722317.0,This. The best thing for me with spotify is the ability to download songs for when I have no service. I use youtube to find music cause spotify hardly ever recommends similar music that I like.
todayilearned,fdttya4,t1_fdsonvz,1578722161.0,How do you find this? Because I'm getting tired on listening to the same songs over and over and I've had spotify for few years now.
ChoosingBeggars,fdrkjpq,t3_emtqn3,1578685782.0,I think he tried to help but I dont think they're the cheapest place. And it's not their fault that she didn't check somewhere else first.  But 54.00 for an intake manifold gasket? They're usually like 15-20.

ToyotaTacoma,fdoozk3,t1_fdn6jsd,1578609658.0,You've made me rethink my future armor situation lol. It's too bad there aren't any tests of this we can see on youtube or something. It's such a big investment.
ToyotaTacoma,fdmxxvm,t1_fdmrr2o,1578570746.0,Interesting thanks. I guess people with that philosophy are against steel bumpers then?
ToyotaTacoma,fdmr3jp,t1_fdmiikc,1578561621.0,"I would skip those and upgrade to the next one up, 5100s. Much thicker, better handling and not much more expensive.

ToyotaTacoma,fcwclee,t1_fcv9en4,1578022286.0,Me too. I remember someone saying they changed it cause of the new safety features. But the other day I was riding behind a new Jeep Truck and it was narrower than my 2nd gen... It could be done!
