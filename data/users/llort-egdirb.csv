While I gave no notice for reasons other than pettiness, it brings me great joy to know that quitting at this time inconvenienced the management the most while being a minor inconvenience to my coworkers who were all great to work with.

KitchenConfidential,fezdwxp,t3_eqy9v1,1579456346.0,"I had a coworker that was a god at organization, she never forgot a single thing and was very skilled a culinary degree She started working at a company two years ago and is still in an entry level position. I think she has autism and thinks that she can’t be hired anywhere else and the company is taking advantage of that lack of confidence. She could he a great manager or head chef, but she doesn’t have the confidence and the company systematically keeps people “in their place” through various tactics. The managers there are either borderline emotionally abusive or full on. A lot of the older people encourage her to pursue something higher because she has the love, passion, and skill for it, but then the managers just bring her back down :/

sleep,fe3jw0m,t3_enit6x,1578849921.0,"Like the other comment, a large box fan might be a good option. It works for me and most of the time I sleep through the dump truck outside my window. I live in an apartment on the second floor facing an alley with huge garbage containers and every night between 3-7 am the garbage truck comes and it’s so loud that it shakes the entire 5 story building and I can sleep through it if I have my box fan on. There’s a bout 30 feet between me and those containers too so I could literally reach out and touch the garbage truck if I wanted to.

If you do get a box fan, the loudest position is to lie it on the floor facing down.

Also, I’m not certain on the exact sciences of how the ears work, but I do know that when people wear earplugs, the brain will adjust to the dampened sound and make the ears more sensitive so you might be experiencing something similar with noise cancelling headphones. With a box fan, the brain probably adjusts to the constant noise rather than the compromised ears. So, based on my knowledge, it’s not always the volume of the sound but a change in sound that alerts the brain something changed. If it’s been quiet the brain will wake to a loud sound and if it’s constant white noise the brain will wake up if the white noise disappears. AFAIK the white noise increases the amount of variation in the sound needed for the brain to take it as a sign to wake up (assuming this wouldn’t be the case with headphones due to the brain becoming over sensitive to different sounds)."

Any show riding on it’s reputation to remain popular is very far past when it should’ve stopped. I’d honestly say if you just take the first couple of seasons of each, they’re equal. 

I think ending Futurama was a good choice otherwise it could’ve ended up like the Simpson’s where every character is just a shell following a formula to appease die-hard fans (as well as pandering to politics to appease people rather than focusing on what the show was originally for). I feel that selling out a good show with a focus on profits will eventually ruin the show."

Advice,fdpplcj,t3_emk6ce,1578635748.0,"While you might not be going to a top college to get a degree, there are still options for you! Also, you don’t always have to go to college immediately after high school. I think it would be smart to take some time for yourself to get everything sorted out because I know it can take a long time to recover from rock bottom and when you do pursue further education, you’ll want to be at your best! 

If you decide to go the route if taking some time off, you can do things to boost your college resume like taking relevant classes at your community college (which can sometimes transfer!) or getting relevant volunteer or work experience. You could even take some time to explore other career options. I do recommend staying somewhat busy. When I’ve been in a position of not having a job or going to school I tend to lose all motivation to improve, but at this stage (if your parents are still paying for everything) the world really is your oyster. Also, you could pretty much take as much time as you need. My grandma went back and became a registered nurse at 40, 20 years after she graduated high school and was able to graduate at the top of her class. I believe she went to a state school as well which had a pretty competitive program to my understanding. 

To add to the other comment, I think your first priority should be to quit smoking. Nicotine can wreak havoc on your brain chemistry which can make your mental health much worse. I know addiction (if you’re at that point) is one of the hardest things to overcome, but if you’ve made it this far I’m sure you’ll be able to manage it!

Also, keep trying to find things that help your depression even if it only makes it 1% better. Also, you could also discuss the possibility of a misdiagnosis. At one point I was also diagnosed with depression and started meds which didn’t make a difference. I started researching my other symptoms and it turned out I actually have add. A lot of the symptoms like lack of productivity lined up. So, because I wasn’t being productive, I started to become anxious because I wasn’t doing any of my hobbies, I would spend the whole day on the couch surfing all of the internet, my room was a mess, etc. basically everything depressed people do but for a different reason. 

Good luck!"

It’s hard to really appreciate the music and art world when from the inside it’s a shark tank.

When people say “oh I’m going into art/music because I just can’t do anything else” it’ll happen one way or another. They either can’t imagine themselves doing anything else and they might succeed, or they literally can’t do anything else because no one will hire them (mostly because of the stigma surrounding these degree whether their true for the individual or not).

There’s also a lot of social stigma (or pretentiousness) when it comes to musicians or artists getting dual degrees or switching majors. They’re seen as being weak or a failure when they actually probably just enjoy doing other things or they’ve realized that they don’t need to make something their entire career and identity just because they’re good at it. This might be a mindset that’s more prominent amongst classical art/music though."

Once you’re comfortable with things such as fingerings and getting pitches, then I would say split your time 50/50 or something between practicing technique and practicing music you like. You could even focus on the music part more and do 20/80 or something since any playing at this point will make you better. At this stage, the importance of technique is to prevent you from creating bad habits that can hold you back later on. If you have a teacher, a good one will help your technique without taking all the fun out of playing and they will also help you play how you want to play rather than how they want you to play (while still educating you on what the proper performance practice is).
