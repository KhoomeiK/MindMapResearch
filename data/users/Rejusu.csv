Given the average minimum entry requirements for sixth form and the average number of GCSEs most students sit he'd have had to have failed roughly half of them to miss the mark by one GCSE. And instead of resitting his GCSEs and doing better he instead turned to forgery. That's less a drive and determination to succeed and more a drive and determination to just cruise on through with the minimum of effort.

I should know since I cruised from A-levels to university by sheer luck (no skullduggery, just the right circumstances). I managed to turn things around once I got there but what got me there certainly wasn't a drive to succeed.

And honestly I think it's possible that they're not doing themselves any favours by continuing to force themselves into education they're not well suited for. I say I was lucky to get into university but I'm not sure it was right for me. I did well at my degree, I'm gainfully employed, and I made many lifelong friends out of it. But I also don't like the career path I'm on, have lost all passion for it, and feel myself regretting the loss of the opportunities that were open to me when I was younger. Opportunities I might have pursued if I hadn't been fumbling my way through university."

Automation is only getting more and more sophisticated in what we can do with it. Most people wouldn't consider language translation to be unskilled labour (because it isn't) and that's something machines have been steadily encroaching on for years. There's also a lot of specialised systems that exist that made skilled positions obsolete years ago. Large aircraft used to have flight engineers that were responsible for adjusting the aircraft systems throughout the flight. It was a skilled position that required a lot of technical knowledge. It's done by a computer now.

Oh sure there's plenty of jobs dedicated to creating and maintaining those computer systems. I should know given I worked on them for years. But there are no more flight engineers. And that's really the moral of the story, the only jobs that are relatively safe are the ones that create the automation. Even then who knows, we might one day be able to automate that. But it's a common misconception that skilled jobs are safe from automation.

It's going to happen eventually and by attempting to limit or restrict it you're just delaying the inevitable. Not to mention that automation should work towards benefiting us as a species if we manage it correctly.

Regarding Otto it's kinda funny how on a lot of threads about self driving vehicles you see truckers chiming in that what they do is far too complex and that machines won't be able to manage it any time soon. But really long haul trucking is going to be one of the first sectors hit hard by automated vehicles. The majority of it is highway driving which is the easiest nut to crack for self driving vehicles. Even if for a while the automation can't handle city driving companies can eliminate a lot of man hours by having robots truck between distribution hubs and having humans take over from there. Taxis will be next once self driving cars can handle urban roads reliably.

It isn't about whether the left is flawless or not, it's about what they're willing to accept. Yes the right don't care, no they don't have standards, but that isn't something the left is capable of changing. Certainly not with its current strategy at any rate. And while the fact the left has standards isn't a problem in and of itself those standards, those idealogies are at the core of the problem the left faces right now.

Why? Because there is no one set of standards. Across the breadth of the far left to the centre of politics no one can agree on what standards we should be following. Some people just want more liberalism, some want to go further into socialism. And the other side of the problem is on the left there is zero appetite for compromise. Zero tolerance for any views that are even slightly removed from their own. It's you're with us or you're against us.

We're talking about a few sprays and a wipe down and using a board to prep food on rather than the surfaces (which you should do as much for the sake of your knives as you should for cleanliness). I know my hands are relatively clean, I still wash them before preparing food. It's just good practice. It's definitely not above and beyond basic food hygiene, and acting like it is just reinforces my original point that a lot of people don't practice the basics if they think something as simple as wiping down a surface and using a board before prepping food on it is too extreme.

And yeah I get the ridiculous attitude that people have towards cats in this thread. You're right that it is absolutely possible to teach them boundaries. I wouldn't have them up there but more because I'd be worried about them hurting themselves/causing damage/stealing food than about them making the surfaces dirty."

Secondly there are other alternatives to allowing them complete freedom to fuck up or just simply restricting them so they can't fuck up and never explaining anything to them. You can put the limits in place and sit them down and explain why they're there. You can talk them through how to manage money while doing it for them and then slowly give them more freedom to do it themselves until they generally know what they're doing.

Children can and should bear some responsibility for when they mess up but they shouldn't be responsible for failures in education.

I grew up in, what I later realised, was a relatively weird bubble where my Dad taught me more about computers and technology than the other way around (which was actually more common for my generation) because he had been working with them long before they were in every household.

Teaching kids about the world is hard because it moves so damn quickly. I don't know if I could teach my kids about the process of buying a house because by the time they do it nearly all my knowledge will be outdated. Heck my parents probably had to relearn this when they moved a couple of years back because the last time they bought/sold a house was around thirty years ago. The things you learn either get outdated or become irrelevant, and you don't learn a lot of the things your kids need to know because they're not things you needed to know.

Others just pass the buck and blame other people, like the kid for not realising that data costs money, or the store for not spelling it out to them that data costs money.

MarvelCrisisProtocol,fe8ur5y,t1_fe8hne6,1578931130.0,"Not sure what the point of posting character cards so blurry that you can't make out much beyond the stats. Not the best pics is definitely an understatement. Still some interesting stuff to be seen in the readable images. The Infinity stones are definitely interesting. Are they tactic cards you pay threat for? Or some kind of new type of card. It looks like they attach to a specific character as an upgrade. Also wouldn't be surprised if that's just one of Dr Stange's default superpowers.

Price of failure is definitely interesting, though you effectively save your opponent an action they may have spent KOing that character it has the potential to generate a lot of power for your team at the cost of a piece that was shortly going off the board anyway. Also gives you some extra tactical options if you're playing with a crisis card that requires characters to be holding objective tokens. An opponent might be ready to jump in and steal an objective from one of your injured characters but you could just kill them and use a healthy character to pick up the dropped token.

Blood to spare looks interesting but without seeing how easily the characters can get health back from their attacks it's hard to fully rate it. It also only works when a character would be dazed so it's a dead card if all your characters get injured and you don't use it.

Execute is pretty mediocre looking. From what I can squint off their cards you want to keep the two of them close together but having to have one of them within range 1 of your target makes it more situational than I'd like. Four power total is also a lot to pay for an effect that honestly doesn't feel that potent. Defense dice are worse than attack dice (3 success sides rather than 4) and most characters aren't rolling large numbers of them. 4 power just seems like a lot when realistically you might only get one point of damage more out of it. But maybe there's some synergy it has with their other abilities that I'm missing.

Edit: After seeing the better quality spoilers it seems pretty clear that the infinity stone cards work with the ""Gem bearer"" passive superpower. And I'd probably expect a similar gem bearer superpower to be on Dr Stange's card. Execute seems a bit better as the wife/husband superpowers make it a lot easier to set up, but I'm still not sure it's all that potent. Especially since both of them have better things to be burning power on."
