Charcuterie,ffhkk1e,t1_ffh33tw,1579939556.0,Wow. I’ve got three hanging now and I don’t know if I can wait that long. I don’t have a dedicated drying chamber yet so when it warms up here they will have to go in the fridge. The last time I was at about 18% loss when I sliced it up. So delicious!

UNCW,ffgo6y6,t3_etbzcw,1579910847.0,"It depends on a lot of factors, but you will absolutely have to apply just as you did for undergrad. In my field, teaching, most graduate programs want you to teach for a few years before you apply. In addition, better keep those grades up. My undergrad GPA was abysmal and it took a lot for me to get into a program. Even after 15+ years working in my field I was still a provisional graduate student until I made A’s in my first three classes."

I worked on farms for over 15 years. Being in the AC all day, having freedom to conduct my classroom much as I see fit, and only working 10 months a year are such benefits I feel the pay is adequate. 

That being said, I’m currently in the process of trying to be paid for my non-teaching experience in science. I’m satisfied, not stupid."

Teachers,fet4ohj,t1_fesfm1q,1579371784.0,"That sounds like typical bureaucratic inefficiency. It’s just another way to quantify something that is already quantified enough. Some kids aren’t going to perform as well as others, smart teachers just aim for the middle and try to help the highs and lows as best they can. It’s also a tremendous time waster. I’m a BT this year doing social studies and reading interventions based on I-station data. It’s pretty ridiculous how much time I spend planning for intervention, close to what I do for social studies. We already had one teacher quit because they told her she was going to have to teach social studies as well as reading and math interventions."
