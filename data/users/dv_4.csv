Um, of course there are no ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù reports. Since when does Apple confirm anything about unreleased products? The only time I can think of was with the Mac Pro, but that‚Äôs an extremely rare thing for Apple, and they had a good reason for doing it in that case. (Pros thought they were abandoning the product, and they wanted to reassure them.)

I agree that it‚Äôs probably unlikely that they‚Äôll move the desktops to ARM, though I could see the iMacs switching at least.

Either way, you can‚Äôt deny that ARM has significant power advantages over Intel‚Äôs mobile chips. You have ARM laptops which can last 48 hours on a charge.

I really don‚Äôt care what chips Apple uses, as long as they‚Äôre the best. Apple isn‚Äôt going to switch unless they can get something both faster **and** more energy efficient than Intel. If they can‚Äôt get both, they won‚Äôt switch.

I don‚Äôt care if Apple stays with Intel, switches to ARM, switches to AMD, or even switches back to IBM, as long as they can get something both faster and more efficient than what they‚Äôre currently using. If the alternatives aren‚Äôt both of those, there‚Äôs no advantage to switching.

But from what I‚Äôve seen, Apple‚Äôs custom ARM chips seem the most likely candidate for them to use in Macs. I know you don‚Äôt like Geekbench, but the fact that a passively-cooled tablet chip is even in the ballpark of Intel‚Äôs laptop and desktop chips is extremely impressive.

The fact is, we don‚Äôt know what an Apple-designed laptop or desktop chip would look like. It‚Äôs very unlikely that they would just slap the A12X in a MacBook Air and call it a day. If they‚Äôre planning to switch some or all Macs to ARM, they would absolutely design Mac-specific chips for those products with more cores and higher clock speeds, which would be actively cooled with a fan.

Obviously, the A13 can‚Äôt exactly compare with a 95W+ desktop chip, because it‚Äôs a phone chip... but the fact that the performance is even similar is very impressive."

I never accused you of being homophobic, so that‚Äôs an odd claim to make. I also never said I was the victim of anything, so that also doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

I‚Äôm just against stereotypes in general, because they‚Äôre typically inaccurate for the majority of the group they‚Äôre about, and only apply to a small group of them.

For example, when you see gay characters on TV, most of them have the exaggerated flamboyant and feminine personality that‚Äôs really over the top. Some gay people act like that, but most don‚Äôt. So I find that to be an inaccurate stereotype and I don‚Äôt find it funny."

The A13 literally beats the i9-9900K in single thread performance. That‚Äôs huge.

And obviously, Apple isn‚Äôt going to put the A13 in a laptop. It‚Äôs a cell phone chip. They would design Mac-specific chips that are larger with more cores, higher clock speeds, and would be cooled with a fan. So they‚Äôd be even faster.

>  yet people are acting as if it‚Äôs right around the corner.

Reliable sources are, actually. It‚Äôs not just sketchy rumors at this point.

Mark Gurman at Bloomberg reported it, and his record is excellent with Apple reporting. Then, Axios independently confirmed it, by speaking with developers and Intel officials. Then, reliable analysts Ming-Chi Kuo also predicted it.

They‚Äôre all in agreement that we‚Äôll see an ARM Mac this year or next."
aww,ff5rzfc,t1_ff56hax,1579607977.0,"Cats are totally different, and so is spaying for females.

I haven‚Äôt seen anything saying that neutering or spaying cats at any age is harmful, and spaying dogs has been shown to have several health benefits for them.

I‚Äôm only talking about neutering male dogs here. Also, remember that if everyone with a female dog spays them, there will be no way for an intact male to breed...

For all dogs, it‚Äôs recommended that you wait until the age of maturity to neuter, if you decide you want to neuter. You‚Äôd have to ask your vet what that age is for your specific breed. Typically, it‚Äôs 1 year for small/medium breeds, and 2 years for large breeds.

Using this Great Dane as an example, he wouldn‚Äôt be fully grown until 2 years old. It may be that he‚Äôs less than 2 years old, or the owners decided not to neuter him at all. Both are okay, and it‚Äôs their choice.

Personally, I‚Äôd be really annoyed if someone came up to me with my dog and started lecturing me on why I need to neuter him."

> And I wish this weren‚Äôt true, but people in general are irresponsible even when they don‚Äôt mean to be. Also, shit happens. I‚Äôm a very responsible dog owner, and mine has broken off his leash once or twice in the 14 years I‚Äôve had him. He sees a raccoon on our walk, for example, and forgets all the training we‚Äôve done. So it‚Äôs better to err on the safe side, in my opinion.

That‚Äôs why harnesses are a good idea for walks, especially for breeds that are known for being escape artists. Like Huskies, for example. Pretty much everyone says not to walk them using just a collar, since they can slip out of them easily if they want to."

aww,ff4msw0,t1_ff4lnb0,1579567414.0,"Oh, yes I already agreed that unfortunately a lot of people are irresponsible pet owners. But if you can‚Äôt handle an intact dog (which is very easy), you really shouldn‚Äôt have a dog in the first place.

I still disagree with s/n agreements, since it‚Äôs entirely within my rights to never neuter my dog, since it‚Äôs mine. But to answer your question, yes, a s/n agreement is of course much better than doing it as a puppy.

And actually, most s/n contracts actually make you **surrender the pet** back to them if you don‚Äôt follow through with it, not just pay a fee. Which of course I think is really wrong and messed up. Like, it‚Äôs a legal contract and they can legally come forcibly take the dog back from you.

However, very few shelters have those agreements. Most will just automatically neuter as young as 1-2 months old. And I will never support that."
