ThatsInsane,ffc3nm0,t1_ffallm6,1579790739.0,Could maybe get the cattle dog but a Dutch should take care of a fox without the slightest issue lol
ThatsInsane,ffc3dbb,t1_ffajxkh,1579790535.0,"Nah u fine we have them here in Chicago area too and my husky has chased off quite a few even bigger than her.  These animals aren’t used to getting charged by something and will take off when confronted it’s the only way they have made it as long as they have in the streets.  They aren’t risking a fight with a formidable dog.

These 3 wolves on the other hand would kill any dog without the slightest problem.  This guy just slipped away luckily.  I think that’s a golden retriever those wolves are like 6 times its size insane"
dataisbeautiful,ff1ghdj,t1_ff15bzl,1579478852.0,That is an extremely interesting fact actually thank you. I guess I was kinda saying there is a large agricultural / rural population that lives near much of the Great Lakes region causing that to show not necessarily that they get all their water form the lakes
dataisbeautiful,fez134c,t1_feyoipn,1579452922.0,I think it’s moreso the agricultural effects of the large populations near the lakes that have access to an abundance of water

worldnews,fe336e6,t1_fe2usxb,1578845487.0,Trump trump trump.  Trump trump trump trump.   Trump trump trump trump trump trump trump!!!!
OldSchoolCool,fdwlyl0,t1_fdw6mlj,1578760055.0,However look at the recent increase in that number.  Poland is absolutely on the uprise in a big way
OldSchoolCool,fdwlgno,t1_fdwkcd6,1578759875.0,Lol this is far from an incel comment just a self-deprecating joke that many of us agree with.  Seems u are the incel
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwk7w4,t1_fdwh57j,1578759556.0,While not denouncing the poverty and living conditions in many places in this country...  America really is a great country.  Despite these conditions people live in the Culture such as food religion family values and devotion to home and the American Dream are still shining extremely bright
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwjk5j,t1_fdwgjgl,1578759385.0,Mm I disagree as war lords (gangs/drug cartels/corruption amongst government officials and police in this case) actually do effectively rule many towns and happily sell them to the highest bidder to watch them crumble
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwj1yk,t1_fdwf6dv,1578759170.0,Mmm possibly not as much as you think to be honest.  Care to be specific as to what gives them a leg up?  If you visit these areas and speak to these people I don’t think they would agree that they have any advantage.  Possibly even a disadvantage by being US citizens as the income disparity continues to grow and become more impossible to overcome
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwio02,t1_fdwc8ad,1578759034.0,I disagree that this is exactly what people mean by referencing third world conditions.  What you are explaining is more of a systemic failure/repurcussion rather than the actual living condition of much of the rural areas of the country.  People are basically living in delapidated sheds in towns with no remaining infrastructure and no sign of help in the future
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwi16b,t1_fdwcwub,1578758852.0,If you live in Detroit and get out in the surrounding areas enough... you should know that the person you are replying to is absolutely correct
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwhfgp,t1_fdwerde,1578758727.0,Missouri may also be fair to put on this list as a state entirely.  Outside of the few nice areas of St. Louis and KC you can find some seriously jarring living conditions
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwh24p,t1_fdwcdjw,1578758603.0,They’re still American cities but people’s standard off living in these places are extremely similar to those of 3rd world countries
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwgsi3,t1_fdwdu8s,1578758511.0,"Georgia, Ohio, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas take your pick.  Recently went through rural New Mexico also which may possibly even top the list"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwgdd8,t1_fdwcr0f,1578758393.0,Would definitely argue Mississippi is not the exception.  Take a trip through Ohio or West Virginia.  Some parts of Michigan are just as bad also.  I’m confident you can find a comparable poverty level to Mississippi Delta somewhere in almost every state.  It’s bad out there if you actually get off the interstates/highways and go through these towns
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwfnc2,t1_fdwe0la,1578758211.0,Yea it’s pretty much almost all rural areas of the country.  The economic disparity is mind-blowing when you get 45 mins outside of pretty much any  us city.  Would argue Alabama isn’t even the worst try driving through some rural towns in Ohio/West Virginia and see what those have become since the recession and pharmaceutical crisis
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdwexyc,t1_fdwco5m,1578758024.0,Agreed all you need to do is tour some of the rural parts of the country in some of the less economically advantaged areas (Deep South/southeast/Midwest rust belt).  Rural America is in extremely rough shape.  Nearing slum conditions just without the population density
husky,fdw5bfr,t1_fdtz0fa,1578755246.0,Do you know anything about dog modeling?  I have wanted to do with mine for a while but don’t know where to start

aww,fczjys4,t1_fczj6wp,1578102888.0,Well considering the other “west coast” cities (I use this in quotes cuz I know it’s not technically pacific coast) (also cuz I’m from us) they do a good job of keeping it behind the scenes/controlling it
aww,fczixfq,t1_fczeyit,1578102250.0,Yea this op is dumb Victoria the times I have been there have barely seen any homeless/vagrant/junkie is really a gorgeous clean BC city

aww,fcziqr6,t1_fcyz3ef,1578102136.0,Victoria rocks.  Would move from US Midwest to Vancouver island in a heartbeat if I could
PublicFreakout,fcu58dn,t1_fct4wby,1577972856.0,Shitty response.  Makes you almost just as bad by generalizing entire communities in the same way
news,fcskzq1,t1_fcra7px,1577918726.0,The guys in gangs doing most of the shootings don’t have couches to lay on to think about time these guys are straight hustlers who do nothing but run the streets every waking minute

Sending positive thoughts to you."
