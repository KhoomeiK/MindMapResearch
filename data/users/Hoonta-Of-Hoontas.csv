assassinscreed,fd0d0e9,t3_ejriwo,1578117080.0,"lets be honest. It's SUPER successful for UbiSoft. even AFTER the disastrous Ghost Recon MTX, they'll still make it an RPG MTX-system. Why? So players spend more time in the game, and have more a justification to spend money on it. 'I'm here, so might as well spend $5.' multiply that by how many copies + the whales. 

We, as a community, have to accept it or reject it. (I'm going to reject it)"

assassinscreed,fcmg6r2,t3_ehytdc,1577774047.0,"IDK. 

I just miss the *Assassins* part of *Assassins Creed*. 

Like the thing that unites all the games is the creed. From those raised into it (Ezio) or those who scoff at it (Edward). it's all the examination of the creed. 

I like Odyssey, but the mystery of the characters' relationship with the creed is what makes the other games more compelling."
