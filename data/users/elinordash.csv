blogsnark,ffbald1,t1_ffaesdc,1579757571.0,"> This survey is so not based in evidence or research and absolutely smacks of privately educated people thinking no one knows what they are doing in state schools, so just comes across as incredibly patronising.

I don't think this is entirely fair.  I wouldn't expect any of the Royals to do research themselves, at most they might lend their name to an existing campaign.

There are established methodologies for surveys and existing scales, but surveys aren't really ""evidence based.""  They're an evidence gathering tool.  A needs assessment survey could easily be 5 vague questions.

But a lot of surveys can look kind of dumb to outsiders.  Like sometimes they purposely repeat questions (to see if answers are consistent) or ask things that most people think are crazy (Babies try to manipulate adults around them- agree/disagree).  If you think the 5 questions are patronizing, you'd be shocked at what some legit evidence based scales include.

I think the survey is about starting a discussion more than collecting data."
blogsnark,ffa76cj,t3_eractj,1579729205.0,"I feel like there are some weird ideas here about non-profit work and how rich/famous people can help make the world a better place.  

I don't think anyone is making serious money as a non-profit board member.  Board members tend to be donors, not people who get paid.  People make serious money on corporate boards, but that is a whole different ball game.  [The American Cancer Society board is all volunteers, no famous people](https://www.cancer.org/about-us/financial-governance-information/board-of-directors.html).  They also have [brand ambassadors](https://www.cancer.org/our-partners.html#Brand_Ambassadors) including LL Cool J's wife Simone Smith who donates the proceeds from her jewelry line.  North Shore Animal League is a regional animal shelter [here is their board](https://www.animalleague.org/who-we-are/our-team/).  Beth Stern (wife of Howard) has been involved for years and she's the reason they get major hosts for their benefits.

I don't think anyone wants a random rich/famous person to come in and create a new initiative.  At one point, I worked with a board member on a specific project.  Despite being involved in the organization for years and having a somewhat related career, most of her ideas were not actionable and I was constantly having to rein her in.  It was a frustrating experience for both of us.  I've heard a lot of stories about random celebs showing up and trying to tell the employees how their organization should work and based on the people I know, it is seen as obnoxious, not helpful.  The celebrities who have the best rep IME are people who do actual long term volunteer work and are up for the boring stuff.  Like stuffing envelopes and moving furniture kind of boring.

It is relatively common for wealthy people (particularly the non-employed wives of wealthy men) to throw fundraisers in their own homes.  The costs of the event are a tax write off for the host, but they don't get paid.

Being able to sell tickets to an event based on the host's name is a big deal.  The host might be a famous person or a well connected business leader.  IME most of the time, the host does not get paid.

Non-profits are thirsty for any kind of press attention because it raises their profile and helps them raise money.  Photos of a super famous person can get you press, but most of them time they don't.  Like press releases with photos get ignored despite multiple A list celebrities. 

There have been a few major scandals with celebrity non-profits.  Wyclef Jean and Leonardo DiCaprio come to mind immediately.  It really isn't that easy to create an organization from scratch and good non-profits function in ways that aren't entirely intuitive.  Being the ribbon cutter for other groups is IMO a better idea for the average famous person than starting something from scratch.

A lot of people here seem to have the idea that all the Royals should be creating major initiatives.  I think that really underestimates how hard it is to create a worthwhile program.  It isn't as simple as having a brilliant idea.   But ribbon cutting does get press attention, which attracts other support.

I think Kate's survey is odd.  The questions are really general.  At first I thought it was designed to see whether they should focus on nurture or ""it takes a village,"" but having thought about it, I actually think the point of the whole thing is to get the British press talking about child development.

Focusing on early childhood is actually a quasi-political move in the UK.  [Sure Start funding halved in eight years](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/20/sure-start-funding-halved-in-eight-years-figures-show), [Government 'hid' report revealing full impact of cuts to Sure Start children's centres](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-hid-report-revealing-full-impact-of-cuts-to-sure-start-childrens-centres-a6808321.html).  With the visits and the survey, Kate is indirectly pushing the press to talk about the funding cuts and why they're bad for Britain.  

I'm not stanning Kate here.  I don't think she's doing anything revolutionary.  The thing is, I don't think anyone in the Royal Family should be expected to do revolutionary work.  The Royals are the anthesis of revolutionary.  At their best, the Royals highlight the work of others.  The Queen's Honours, the DoE Award, and Invictus all highlight the work of others.  

I think there is a legit argument to be made that Meghan was more interested in doing the work of Royal visits than Kate is.  Personally, I've always assumed that Buckingham intentionally set their expectations low so Kate could have a slow entry and offered Meghan the same.

But at the same time, I don't think any of these people are creating massive change.  They're not elected leaders or experts in any world changing field.  They're celebrities."

There is an old fashioned joke about telling a guy you could go out with him because you were washing your hair.  That was based on the mid-century tendency for women to set their hair once week.  So that once a week hair wash was a long involved process.  

And before that, a lot of homes lacked the indoor plumbing necessary for daily hair washing.  

I don't know enough about the history of specific hair practices to know whether or not the no poo method or any other specific technique was appropriated, but there is nothing new about white women washing their hair once a week and just piling on products in between.

Letâ€™s take an example flight â€“ a Boeing 737, one of the worldâ€™s most popular commercial jets, will burn somewhere in the region of 750 gallons an hour. Over the course of a three-hour flight, it will therefore burn 2,250 gallons of fuel, producing 21,533kg of CO2.

So there is a history of ""fancy"" people having surnames as first names.  And I think parents often use surnames as first names because it feels fancy.  But there is less weight to the name when it is just a name you like and not a part of your history.  And I think the fanciness is fading."
