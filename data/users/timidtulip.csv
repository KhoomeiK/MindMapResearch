To be honest, I didn't deal with the feeling at all, was happy to be miserable and just rode with it. I guess at some point I got distracted from it because thinking about it now, the feeling has mostly totally faded away without me noticing.

Embrace it as a totally valid emotion - we are allowed to be negative as well as positive! Don't try to fight against it, just ride it out and it will fade.

As I got older, I have come to accept that I just do not have enough patience for children. I'm too selfish to have children.  I have plenty in my life that I do not feel there is a gap to be filled with a baby. I do not want my life to change (when I say change, I mean be totally uprooted, decimated, obliterated) by having children.

Kudos to those that do - that's their choice, it's just not for me.

So no, no event that turned my mind against, just a growing understanding of my own personality which shows I would be completely unsuitable as a parent."

AskReddit,fcii4bh,t3_ehcsiw,1577662920.0,"HUMOUR NEEDS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED. What one person finds humorous does not mean IT WAS MEANT TO BE offensive to anybody else. IF the words said were MEANT to be hurtful disrespectful or targeted, then that's different,and NOT humour

Note to a very great comedian: **Nothing happens when you are offended.** 

Nothing happens except your own indignation.  Apparently - I'm Offended"" is now means for a lawsuit. What utter cr@p. No-body would ever tell a joke again if it came to this.

Humour is what tells us apart from the higher thinking mammals: it doesn't start a war, nobody stops selling socks on a bridge, there i no milk crisis, the internet didn't crash. the stock market is fine and the world will still turn. You are offended. Big deal, it's just words. WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGED IN THE UNIVERSE?

If you are offended by something - You expect all YOUR  opinions to be the right, current, valid ones,  WHY?

You can't understand why people don't respect you're standpoint - but THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

People can live in communities with different opinions .We can love each other without agreeing on everything. 

We just have to tolerate, and find the humour.

I'm fully expecting this one to blow up. Help!"

Your diet and sleep are absolutely PARAMOUNT to to the rest of your life. Your body will  cope with amazing stress if it is fit, healthy and nourished. I'm just guessing, but you are denying yourself at least one of those things. Change one, you change them all. Please take that leap."

Every word you say makes sense. 
I am in hope that if i say ""NO"" next year,; I will be able to back it up with previous years of ""service"" And that my spine will have grown.

Side note: Do we think that hosting during the year would help or hinder?

Luckily there are no issues with the locks, so we can just make arrangements - up and leave.
But it's certainly worth seeing who would clean my house......

There are a million ways to be happy. There are a million ways to not be lonely.

Personally, I'm  looking forward to old age. Because the important people in my life will already be in place.  They will already selected themselves, they can decide whether or not to be in the rest of  my life. The rest of it, I can't control. So Ive given up trying. I love ttham. Lets see what happens."
