crashbandicoot,ff2gv2a,t3_er83o6,1579505568.0,"Right? I'm browsing some old threads for the lols of it and seeing people say Hasty had ""no chance"" of being in the game. How Yaya would be a laughable character to include (and that she looked like a bad OC) 

Just so much negativity and bashing peoples hopes down and yet...? The game has delivered so much more than anyone had hoped for and quite frankly spits in the face of critics. I love it. Really won't be shocked if that Mr. Crumb dude appears next Halloween or sooner just because why not?"
tifu,ff2fxiv,t1_ff2fs16,1579504447.0,"Pffffft. Okay, I'd take a call saying ""why does your kid hate forks so much?"" Any day lol"
DoesAnybodyElse,ff2es2f,t3_er75iv,1579503128.0,"Yes! Visuals are one thing, but actually hear the whatever? Like, I'm used to unpleasant imagery, but noises are much less common and much scarier"
tifu,ff2c30w,t1_ff24s2c,1579500259.0,"Hehehe, that sounds reasonable, I just worry that a teacher would call me some day saying ""soooo, your kiddo taught the entire class some very colorful language today..."" Irregardless of rights and wrongs, people get ideas and I gotta curb my tongue before even thinking about youngins... 

Unless I'm raising pirates. All bets are off then."
crashbandicoot,ff2a36j,t3_er0g62,1579498322.0,"ASDFGHJKL noooooooo. I was in a lobby with one other person for like, 30 minutes straight, getting 1st/second interchangably and enjoying rocketing up the leaderboards and then.... Goodbye connection randomly... The struggles are real 

Ps. Meisterlegend???? (I think, give or take some numbers to replace those ????'s) thank you for the good times lol."
tifu,ff23o50,t3_er7i1t,1579492928.0,"Pfffffft, and this is why I worry about what would happen if I were a parent. I'm sure that PG mindset comes with having to deal with kids that are ready to absorb everything and I just... I don't think I'm ready for that ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ 

That's one of those underappreciated skills I'm sure"
tifu,ff03wec,t1_fexwwxc,1579464892.0,"Was saying the exact same thing to my girlfriend just now. Like, OMG, these both somehow manage to hurt my non-existent nuts just by reading them."
relationship_advice,fet5dek,t1_fesdb6b,1579371963.0,"Mildly off-topic, but I read that in her voice not even knowing it was her because I'm unobservant. Thanks for pointing that out"
DoesAnybodyElse,fehief3,t1_fegpw18,1579117169.0,"TBH as a random casual passerby, I thought you intentionally did that as a joke to say ""see no one's perfect"". Had you not blown up that is."
schizoaffective,fdbwlo1,t1_fda11g8,1578262982.0,"That's where it gets money witholdy. They won't let me have money in hand unless I know the exact cost I will be facing and anytime I tried to explain it I always get ""payment due at time of service"" or ""you don't qualify for sliding fee scales so we don't bill"" or ""she should have set this up for you already, I don't believe you have a payee"" and my rep payee demands they send her a paper bill they dont usually do. (For instance my cable company is paper-free and because she refused to learn how to pay it online, claiming she can't, I have to eat a $100 late fee because she mailed my money to somewhere that didn't exist before finally figuring out how to pay it in the way the company asked for) she does this with everything that needs money. My cat actually died because my vet said they wouldn't bill and my rep payee wouldn't talk to them to explain. 

Even if there are simple, normal, solutions, they over complicate it to the point where I can't do it or get psyched out. Which sucks because I was homeless before and they get extra funding for homeless clients that use their homeless shelter."
schizoaffective,fd9tpya,t1_fd9ev08,1578237952.0,"I've tried, they keep dropping me off and staring the wait over every time my case manager quits and my treatment gets put on hold until the next one is hired. 

I would have included in the first post that but I had a rough time figuring what details were important and which aren't."
rant,fcxmr7r,t3_ejbtsz,1578066656.0,"And then we're told ""you do have an active role in this as a citizen of the USA"" or ""if you live here and buy this product, youre taking part in our war"" etc etc ... As if we all can just decide to not use cars or whatever one day. As if we have no where we need to go and deadlines to meet"
rant,fcw2x8f,t3_ej5tjr,1578015910.0,"Feel like sticking your tongue on ice? According to some adult types I met in my youth, this helps tongue wounds feel better, even if I never noticed it"

CatAdvice,fcvdork,t1_fcux299,1577999933.0,"Oh goodness. Well I'm out of ideas beyond just trying to get to his level and speak his language. My cats knew what a hiss was because their mother taught them, but I don't know how all cats work. Ever tired hissing just for the giggles of it? Worse comes to worse you just made him question your life choices more ðŸ˜‚"

dogpictures,fcv5j0t,t1_fcutiax,1577995076.0,"Heyya I'm not the type to say ""you're not prepared for this breed"" to a total stranger. For all I know, you grew up raising purebred Dalmations ðŸ˜‚ I'm just trying to be a punny loser lol"
crashbandicoot,fcv5a5f,t1_fcv46l6,1577994933.0,"That's where semantics matter. Last to place, and last in the line of racers are different in how the game acts. Technically sure, the last in line is last, but that's not what they're talking about ðŸ˜‚"
crashbandicoot,fcuzt11,t1_fcuyq1r,1577991771.0,"Great, now I gotta explain semantics... If you didn't finish a race you can't be last to finish because in order to be last, you have to finish, first.  They lump all DNF racers into the same rank and rewards, unless they never completed lap 1 at all. Hence why there is a mild distinction between who actually finished last, and all the rest who didn't finish/rank at all.

Edit- a missing comma"
dogpictures,fcut4tz,t3_eixtlb,1577987983.0,"Man you're in for a rough time with a Dalmation... You're never gonna get your house spotless again, and if you don't give him enough pets? Automatic eternal dalmation... On the plus side though, you can now work out whenever because you always have a spotter! Not to mention all the puns you'll have to face ðŸ˜‚"
crashbandicoot,fcus3x4,t1_fcup23r,1577987384.0,"You ever play Crash Team Racing online? There's a time limit to cross the line after 1st place wins. ""Last"" in this case means before that limit ran out."
CatAdvice,fcurnh4,t3_eizwvv,1577987106.0,"This won't sound polite because I'm no expert, but since cats don't like water and sinks have water... If you splash him, would he leave for dryer ground and start associating the sink with ""the wet bad place""?"
crashbandicoot,fc360fe,t3_efsspg,1577382298.0,Right? I hate it when it happens to me but like ... Ain't no other way I'm catching up and 1st had no qualms about rocketing away my blue fire sooooo vase in the worst place
