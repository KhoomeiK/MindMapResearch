Picard,ffe3qa5,t1_ffdatzy,1579835905.0,Steamed milk in Earl Grey aka A London Fog.  Personally I drive Organic Earl Grey from David's Tea.  Best earl grey around.  Just dont let it step for more them 3 minutes or it will get a bitter taste.
cats,ffdfsm0,t1_ffc9gaj,1579819964.0,I didn't see that show and now I really don't want to.  What's the name so I can avoid it.
blackpowder,ffd63ft,t3_eszer1,1579814142.0,"If the barrel is less then 4"" (and it looks like it is), it's prohibited in Canada.  To easy to conceal."
battletech,ffarchv,t1_ffae7cg,1579742691.0,That one may fall down the list a bit but I want it just for my collection.
alberta,ffar9i1,t1_ffap68r,1579742632.0,"Same idea from what I understand.  I'm just not sure who pays the ""taxes"".  If its the feds/province or the lessor that pays.  Either way if there is equipment/buildings on that land the owner of those pays taxes.  The reason being is that the municipality needs to maintain the roads around those leases, because the oil companies are the ones moving big heavy equipment on those roads and they need more then just regular traffic amounts of maintenance."
alberta,ff9nl6l,t1_ff9h813,1579716746.0,"Replying to my own comment about why they can't go after the landowner.

So the land owner leases out the land.  The land owner pays the taxes on all of that land (including the leased area).  What the municipality taxes of the oil companies is the surface equipment.  So if they build a well or put in a compressor shack that is what is taxes.  A lot of these oil companies saw the writing on the wall a few years ago and just started walking away from the equipment.  The municipality doesn't take the equipment because it's not worth anything.  Basically they are just out that money with no way to recover it.  Taxes are not considered secured credit so when they declare bankruptcy they will only get pennies on the dollar if anything."
alberta,ff9h813,t1_ff88c3w,1579712959.0,Municipalities don't arrest people for not paying property taxes.  They just wait until they are 3 years in arears.  After that the municipality takes the property and any buildings on that property and puts them up for sale (usually for just the amount they are behind in taxes).  The problem with most of the oil and gas taxes are they are for leases not actual property.  The land owner leases the land to the oil company.  The municipality can't go after the owner for the back taxes (not sure why).
battletech,ff9gmbg,t1_ff9dwsx,1579712588.0,"Thanks for the info.  I'll check them out and see what they have.  Might give them a heads up before going.

I know all about Sentry box.  I used to live just 6 blocks from them.  Spent way to much of my pay cheque there.  They are having their 40th aniversery this year.  I guess I'll have an excuse to go visit my daughter now.  She lives about 10 blocks from them."
battletech,ff989vz,t1_ff83jaf,1579707143.0,Thanks everyone.  That helps a lot.  I picked up Tunder Rift from DriveThru last night.  I've also got the hard cover of the latest print edition of Total Warfare.  I'll wait and see if I can pick up the other books as they come out (so I'm already behind).
guns,ff4ez1m,t1_ff1yqtd,1579562014.0,"I started with a Remington 700 in 6.5CM SPS tactical in coyote tan.  Then I got an MDT LSS Gen2 chassis plus 2, 10 round magazines.  Then a Vortex Diamondback Tactical 6-24x50 scope.  Used a buffer tube and stock from an old AR15 build I wasn't using.  Total all in is around 2500 Canadian pesos.  Forgot I put a break on it which cost around 100 bucks.  Incredible rifle to shoot.  I may have posted a pic of her on here some where."

StarWars,fenw9me,t1_fen3hy3,1579291765.0,"Ever watch ""Chasing Amy""?  Kinda reminds me of when Banky is called a ""tracer""."
cats,fenvk9s,t3_eq0ebp,1579291569.0,I would have said yes.
canadaguns,fekir17,t1_fekid3s,1579200896.0,It does take a bit of getting used to loading.  If you have the bullet on to much of an angle it won't go in.  At first I was pushing the bullet tip straight in to the door and had problems.  Once I reduced the angle and let it slide along the door it loads much easier.
canadaguns,fekfmc5,t1_fek33nw,1579199028.0,I could get 9 in it no problem before.  Now the tenth one is tough but it fits.  I may take a couple more coils off to see if that helps.  It doesn't have any problems feeding.
battletech,fekfg11,t3_epepvw,1579198925.0,Where do you buy your mechs from?
canadaguns,fek0k4r,t3_epbzv1,1579190019.0,I've got the exact same one.  Had to cut 2 inches of spring in the tube so I could fit the tenth round in it for cowboy action.  Only thing I don't like about Marlin's is the bolt tends to be sharp  and can nick you if you have a thumb close to it while racking it.
canadaguns,fdtfnty,t3_en0uxy,1578716081.0,I think I sold you that barrel.  Have you shot it yet?
iiiiiiitttttttttttt,fds8xta,t3_emr9ie,1578697053.0,I setup our printer/copier/fax machine so people could send a fax right from word/excel with a cover letter even.  Nobody uses it even after repeatedly showing them how.  They still print off a blank cover letter and their document.  Then manually write on the cover letter then go to the same machine they printed it from and fax it.  Drives me nuts.  I guess they wouldn't know what to do with the extra hours a day they would have doing it the simple way.
canada,fdgzdgs,t1_fdfvwzx,1578411986.0,"I read a report on running shoes that said they are only good for about 500 miles.  I buy runners based on the fact that they will only last me about 6 to 8 months and I don't run much.

Now I have a pair of boots that I paid almost 300 for.  I have resoled them once in 2 years.  They are great boots and I wear them daily.  Only problem is I can't wear them for exercising.  That and they are comfortable."
canada,fdgz19d,t3_el4wtd,1578411769.0,I'm looking for a new washer and drier set.  The set I have now I paid 500 bucks for both but they are small and we have to do twice as many loads and it's not efficient so uses a lot of power and water.  My budget is $1500 for a new set.  Problem is the reviews of a lot of them suck.  Seems like they have just as many lemons at $1500 as they do at $500.  I want to pay for quality and have something that will last 15 to 20 years.  I'm just not sure that's possible anymore.  Talk to sales and all they can talk about is how nice the machines look.  Nobody cares.  You put them in the basement and your the only one who sees them.  I'm getting really tired of this throw away society.
keto,fdfexxn,t3_el0ajn,1578360108.0,"I'm exactly the same.  I fell off the wagon after losing 35 pounds and was well on my way to being my goal weight.  Then vacation came.  Then I travelled for work. Next thing you know I'm breaking out the fat pants.  What makes it worse is I eat bad food when I get down on my bad eating habits.  I absolutely love sugar and it pisses my off.  I need to find the will power to get over it.

Your post has helped.  Knowing I'm not alone in fighting the addiction helps.  All the best with getting back to keto."

alberta,fdfdnvq,t1_fdf4op9,1578359247.0,I tried the generator but it doesn't work.  I think I need to ground the genset.  This is part of the problem if an electric goes empty on you.  Easier to tow to a charger.

funny,fcvpxq2,t1_fcvdd87,1578007452.0,I call it the stupid tax.  Your stupid to buy a lotto ticket.  But then again I do get one when the jackpot hits it's limit (they have limits to some of the lotteries here).  It only happens about 5 times a year and for 25 to 30 bucks a year it doesn't hurt my standard of living.
funny,fcvpors,t1_fcu6ouk,1578007292.0,First thing I'll do if I win is give half to the wife and tell her she can stay or go but there is your half.  It's more likely I would be begging her for money in a year.  She's much better saving then I am.

cats,fcocx4p,t3_ei7ums,1577829170.0,"I grew up with cats from as far back as I can remember.  My mom got our first cat when I was 1.5 years old and against my dad's wishes.  Turns out dad and that cat (dad called him DC or Damn Cat) where best friends after a month.  Since then I've had 6 cats.  My wife and I swear after this one (Sunshine a beautiful orange tabby) is gone we are not getting another pet for awhile so we can travel since the kids will be out of the house by then.

I give it a month before we have another one.  Cats are the best companions people can have.  Independent, strong, soft, cute, cuddly."

Blacksmith,fcnb8yc,t1_fclmtgj,1577807905.0,"Thanks.  I'm going to do that when they re-open after new years.  
  
I did pick up a new male end that goes from the regulator to the tank but the old one just won't come off.  Not sure what they did but that thing is in there tight.  I don't want to destroy the whole regulator trying to get it off.  So I guess it's back to the shop where I got my tanks from and see if they can help."
Blacksmith,fcnb06m,t1_fcmdw7w,1577807741.0,That's how I noticed it.  Problem is it's cold here and the water freezes fast.  Might have to bring the tanks in to the house to warm them up a bit.  By cold I mean -15 c over night and around -5 c during the day.

amateurradio,fcl74m3,t1_fcl6mhs,1577741247.0,But I've listen to it for literally and hour during the CQWW SSB.  He had multiple people sending their calls.  Most would send it about 5 times before giving up and moving on.  Sure he could have been AFK for lunch but should have given up the frequency.  There is lots of space on the bands.
amateurradio,fcl5fhg,t3_ehnpn8,1577740202.0,My favorite type of contester is the ones that record their CQ.  Then they play it back with almost no space between to actually hear if someone is calling them.
amateurradio,fckyxfh,t1_fckpz8r,1577736181.0,"I would but like I said, I've had enough of contests.  I got in to ham radio to communicate.  I've been active for about 5 years of the 10 that I've had my license (moved so couldn't get an antenna up for HF).  Of those five years I can count on one hand the number of real conversations I've had.  I really need to call CQ more often rather then listen for the CQ.  
  
I enjoy things like FT8 for about 5 minutes before it just becomes the same old thing.  I've tried some PSK and RTTY lately but it seems everyone has moved to FT8."
alberta,fckrjck,t1_fckifp9,1577731640.0,I live rural and didn't vote UCP.  I voted AP.  Not that it makes any difference.  The ones that did vote UCP are not saying much about the cuts other then I got a 0% raise because of it (I work for a municipal government).  Council doesn't care that it's actually about a 5% (or more) pay cut because of increased costs of living.  They got their money so fuck everyone else.

Canada_First,fckgfs9,t3_ehahrx,1577724768.0,"No.

Something that is free has no value.  Student loans have only made tuition and other fees higher, as schools know that the Government will issue bigger loans to cover costs.  I still think that there should only be 10 to 20% of the population allowed to go to university.  Everyone else can either go to trade schools, get a diploma (2 years) or get an unskilled labor job.  Granted I also think if you don't go to university you should be able to earn a livable wage.  May not be 100k a year but you shouldn't have to worry about paying the gas bill or eating this month."

canada,fblk9tg,t1_fbliozr,1576964235.0,While I would like to think this is true.  I have family that now live in TO and they think this is a great idea.  They have no clue about the existing gun laws and have zero interest in learning them.  You just can't explain it to some people.  They equate guns with everything that is bad in this world.
