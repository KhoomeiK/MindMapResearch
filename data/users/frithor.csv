getdisciplined,fedipht,t3_eo5mvp,1579012542.0,"What worked for me is to use a good chunk of time to develop a schedule for the upcoming week. Structure your ideal days with what you want to accomplish, and how you want to feel at the end of the day. By actually dedicating some time to this you feel obligated to do it, and actually start enjoying doing your tasks. 

Procrastination often originates from a habit of blurring out what actually needs to be done, resulting in procrastinating even when it causes more stress than relaxation. Schedules often clear these things up ;)"
DecidingToBeBetter,fd902qo,t3_ekbv42,1578226142.0,"Thank you so much for putting this, all too important lessons, into such great wordings. I recently found the reasons for my early signs of alcoholism were originating from my unconscious, knowing the future I was heading toward. The future being an inevitable source of suffering, disguised by the society we live in. Studying for a Masters Degree in Electrical System Designs was by everyone around me accepted as a successful journey. Landing me a guaranteed good paying job. Granting me happiness and motivation. 

2 years in, I realized it won't. I am now certain it won't. After reading a few books about mindset and general philosophical topics my entire view on life has changed, just as you are describing. I constantly want to improve myself and investigate further, the true potential we possess. Potential I truly feel is dampened through society's systems of picturing ""The Right Way""... 

I also intend to make 2020 a year of development of self. Develop myself enough to qualify in helping others truly see their potential through my future results.  Thanks for sharing your story, and good luck :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,fcx6y58,t3_ejc6lu,1578053753.0,It feels even better by sharing the story :) We’d love to hear! Congrats btw
getdisciplined,fcx6m8h,t1_fcx53ox,1578053375.0,"If you have a goal you want to achieve, money, fitness, relationship, whatever it is, visualization has done some truly remarkable stuff for me and many others. 

The visualization I'm talking about utilizes the concept of truly immersing yourself in your future self, who has obtained the goal. Immerse yourself in a way where you become that person. Feel the same, see the same, experience the same. The more detailed, the better. Don't think of the ""how"". We have no concept of how remarkable our mind is. It will do the work. 

If you see it the other way. When you think of the bad stuff in the past, awkward interactions, huge mistakes, etc. you can feel the intense bad feeling you felt in that exact situation. How often have you heard the phrase ""Why does this stuff always happen to me!?"", lots right? I believe it's connected to the way we feel when truly visualizing something. It's just easier to connect feelings through thought when it has already happened in the past. That's why people who keep their focus on their previous self, often are stuck with the same future. 

I hope it made things a bit clearer? If you watch ""The Secret"" on Netflix, or read the book, it gives some oversimplified explanations on how this concept has affected a lot of people."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcx4bsl,t3_ejcmna,1578050642.0,"It's insane how much the body generates pain to not give up something of habitual nature. Every time you get this surge of pain, just think of it as the progress of destroying a bad habit and replacing it with a new one. You're taking a huge leap in your self-improvement. Congrats!"
getdisciplined,fcx3cdb,t1_fcx2ykk,1578049412.0,"Joe Dispenza has some great stuff that I'm currently listening to (audiobook). 

Breaking The Habit Of Being Yourself, is my favorite so far.  
(It's a bit more on the scientific side if you're into that)"
getdisciplined,fcx2ee9,t1_fcx13hz,1578048193.0,"It’s doesn’t follow a very strict regime like many other routines, but work for me.

1. I wake up, visualize and truly FEEL (important) my goal. (15 min ish)
3. Eat a good tasting and well nourished breakfast.
2. Note my checklist for the day. Each point is what I believe will leave me with a good feeling at the end of the day.
3. Find or resume some sort of motivational and educational content (audiobook, YouTube, book, etc). I usually drag these feelings into my visualizations in the morning.
4. If my checklist is done and I have more time, I either add extra points on my checklist or resume motivational/educational content.
5. Before going to sleep I will reflect on my day and again do the visualization process.

Building my day in order to feel good about myself is the essential part of how my work ethic is built upon. It is also the reason for the visualization process and motivational/educational content, as it makes me feel great at the end of the day. I believe body, mind, and the way we feel, is more interconnected than we think and by focusing on this we can truly begin to tap into our potential. 

Love stuff like this, feel free to send PM to talk more about if anyone is interested :)"

personalfinance,fcx0zeb,t3_ejcymn,1578046353.0,I would treat it as a motivator to improve my financial situation to the point where 8k won't leave a huge dent in my current situation. Situations like this can force you to think of a smarter way to improve your current way of making money.
getdisciplined,fcx0ix3,t3_ejd2r3,1578045758.0,"The gamechanger for me is meditating/visualizing my future self and actually feel myself in that moment. It gets both my unconcious and my body to move forward in the right direction. 

In addition, getting things in writing is a must for me. Writing daily must-do tasks so I don't forget small, but important steps."
selfimprovement,fcwvevt,t3_ej4t3k,1578039234.0,"A very powerful technique that has worked for me is to shorten my goal to the point where I can write it 100 times. I know it sounds weird, but writing and repeating is a very powerful way to get goals to your unconsciousness and drive your thoughts to complete your goals. The problem with lists is that you only write it down once, and probably using lots of time making it look good and structured. Time that could be put to getting your goals to your mind, and not on paper."
selfimprovement,fcvnfsc,t3_ej2qg4,1578005872.0,"The worst thing to do is thinking of the bad stuff in your past. It creates a mindset that naturally will follow the same structure and habits only to end up repeating your past. Visualize and feel your ideal future daily and fight to take small, but daily measures to improve yourself and others around you."
selfimprovement,fcn9lvm,t3_ei3317,1577806778.0,"I was the same before, still am to some degree. I found that friends who point out your insecurities usually do it to push some of their own insecurities on to you. It may be in an uncomfortable situation with others, usually was with me. It varies from person to person.  

What helped me was the simple fact that not everyone will like you, no matter how perfect you are. Look at your, insecurities as a strength to attract people that truly likes you for who you are. It is a strength to create real connections, unlike many overly attractive people. 

It also helped me to ask myself why I react the way I do. Usually I find that most of it is solved when I answer this question. Questioning yourself brings out your rationality from another perspective than your subconscious."
selfimprovement,fcn7lc3,t3_ehtv64,1577805348.0,"I think your ability to become gung ho about something you should use to get out of your situation. I am the same, but once someone thinks bad of it, the feeling gets wrecked. It truly sucks, and its the exact reason why I keep some of my hobbies away from others, only to show them wrong when I have accomplished results. 

If you can find something to generate this feeling for, and ideally be able to turn it in to a replacement for your current extremely time-consuming job and work from home, I believe you can do great progress. Keep it away from others (probably not your wife if she is supportive), and prove them wrong. Its my main drive to be able to change my situation."
getdisciplined,fcn3wbd,t3_ehs9zh,1577802564.0,"Doing most of this myself and has done wonders on my mental health. I would also recommend writing a two-column list with your daily Successes an Failures. Go through the list, remember the feelings you felt and tell yourself “I want/don’t want to feel this feeling again. 

Made me eliminate lots of my negative thoughts:)"
