MMA,ffafd6f,t1_ffa5ojz,1579734432.0,Isn't that the exact same argument to make against Conor getting a Khabib rematch?
MMA,ffaez4r,t1_ffa6an9,1579734139.0,Masvidal also beat Till and Askren. He was arguably fighter of the year before the BMF fight. Let's not pretend that his performance against Nate was the sole reason he's in title contention.

MMA,ff9nxm3,t1_ff9irnx,1579716949.0,"Conor doesn't hit harder than Hendricks. GSP can't make 185 in a healthy way. It's not too much work to waltz in on fight night at 170 and grind his way to a decision.

Even better, imagine if he KO'ed Conor with a left straight."
MMA,ff9nq20,t1_ff9fwm8,1579716827.0,It's not a NYC issue. Even Dana said the stoppage was justified once he saw the cut backstage. The doctor said he could practically see his skull. You don't want a cut that deep widening.
MMA,ff9nlq5,t1_ff9kn0v,1579716755.0,Meanwhile there are contenders with 6/8/10 fight win streaks struggling to get a title shot. How exactly would a 165 division water down the talent around 155?
MMA,ff9ngy7,t1_ff9i5ht,1579716677.0,"I think there's an awareness here that Conor's time in MMA is very limited, for any number of reasons. He could lose a fight and/or lose his star power, he could walk away from the sport and/or to go to another sport, he could be dragged away from the sport as a consequence of the criminal charges against him.

If you want to suck the most money out of him as soon as possible, the Khabib rematch makes the most sense. If you want to pretend that he's going to have any longevity in the sport and would actually defend a title, then it makes more sense to have him earn his way to another title."

freefolk,ff6k7y5,t1_ff65r5y,1579628969.0,In the books perhaps. I don't think it was quite the same for the show because everyone was aged up. Bobby B was almost 50 when he filmed for the show.

explainlikeimfive,fe9thr7,t1_fe9j8ee,1578941338.0,"That's what ""dark energy"" is, and we don't know anything about it other than it exists.

Wikipedia:

In physical cosmology and astronomy, dark energy is an unknown form of energy which is hypothesized to permeate all of space, tending to accelerate the expansion of the universe.[1][2] Dark energy is the most accepted hypothesis to explain the observations since the 1990s indicating that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate.[3]

Assuming that the concordance model of cosmology is correct, the best current measurements indicate that dark energy contributes 68% of the total energy in the present-day observable universe. The mass–energy of dark matter and ordinary (baryonic) matter contribute 27% and 5%, respectively, and other components such as neutrinos and photons contribute a very small amount.[4][5][6][7] The density of dark energy is very low (~ 7 × 10−30 g/cm3), much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, it dominates the mass–energy of the universe because it is uniform across space.[8][9][10]"

Salt is a category of chemicals and table salt (NaCl) is just one example. Most descaling salts become very acidic when water is added and most of the buildup on the pipes is basic. The acid dissolves the buildup until the solution becomes pH neutral.
