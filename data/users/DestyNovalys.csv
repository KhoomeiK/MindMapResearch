AskEurope,ffvrx09,t3_evbl3q,1580271528.0,"I’m German, and I only know the story of my mothers parents. I was never that close with my dads parents.

My grandpa was a soldier, because it was either that or be dead. He was at a front near Russia where he was shot twice. In the leg and in the chest. He was sent home to Germany to recover in a hospital. (I think) They removed the bullet from his leg, but left the one in his chest. That one became an issue a decade or two later, when he was working on a farm. The bullet moved towards his heart and he collapsed. They removed it, and he lived until he was 92. He died of Alzheimers. 

His favorite story was the one about the camp, when Hitler visited to lift morale. He contemplated shooting him. He kept his hands on his gun and thought long and hard about what to do. The reason he didn’t do it, from what he told us, was that he knew that the war wouldn’t end with Hitler getting killed. Idk how much truth there is to that story, and I can’t ask him since he died 13 years ago. I also wouldn’t, but that’s a different story. 

My grandma, who was 10 years younger than my grandpa, still lived at home, in a town that is part of Poland today. They woke up one night when the Russians broke into their house. Her parents hid her, but they found, raped and killed her sister and mother. She was able to flee, and eventually joined a lazaret. They fled from town to town, always just leaving as the Russians were approaching. She was young and scared, but she eventually found relatives in northern Germany, which is where she met my grandpa several years later. 

They both hated Hitler and the Nazis. It’s always a bit weird to see this topic online, because people rarely think about the people in Germany who weren’t Nazis. I saw a post from an American who shared a picture of medals, which he’d earned killing Nazis in WW2. The comment section was in awe of his accomplishments, and anyone speaking up for the German soldiers was downvoted to hell."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffvozmv,t1_ffvk1yq,1580269340.0,"People can surprise you in the worst ways. I had one in my friend list who I’d met at a party. She seemed completely normal. Then one day, out of the blue, she posted that only women who wear headscarves are respectable. She didn’t wear one, btw. 

So, I asked her if she was serious, and thus began a conversation that revealed a lot of surprises. She told me that she didn’t believe in evolution, and that the earth was 6000 years old, that women without headscarves were “asking for it”. She was adamant that women who didn’t cover up were responsible for their own rape. She has three teenaged daughters. So I asked her if she thought that I was responsible for being molested at 11? Which she denied, of course, except that I looked like 18 when I was 11, because I had boobs the size of cantaloupes. So, according to her own logic, since the guy was a stranger and I wasn’t covered up, it would have been my fault. She didn’t get that. I blocked her after that. I feel sorry for her daughters."

At least not anymore. We had two who were covered with scars from head to toe. One had slit her own throat, and, on a different occasion, had tried to cut out her belly fat with some scissors. They were in recovery and didn’t have any fresh wounds, but they were still very ill. I still think about them sometimes, 16 years later, and wonder how they’re doing. None of us stayed in touch after getting out, so I have no way of knowing."

coolguides,ffnyghf,t1_ffntxet,1580072251.0,"It’s not really about being a victim. The issue of chronic illness is incredibly misunderstood, and it has led to some very grim consequences. Try reading through some of the chronic pain subreddits, and you’ll see people who can barely walk be denied their medication based on gross misconceptions and blatant vilification of the medication we depend on to get out of bed. It’s stuff like “being in the right state of mind”, “eating healthier”, and “pain is really more mental” which makes it even harder, because it all boils down to “you could do more”. We could do yoga, eat vegan, or keto, or paleo, or maybe gluten free, or have we tried meditation, or weight lifting, or that thing that the friend of a boyfriend of an acquaintance of the aunt of your coworker tried. We have tried pretty much every thing under the sun. Until we couldn’t, because it hurt too much, or cost too much, or because we didn’t have the energy to. So, yeah, as someone with eight chronic illnesses, I call BS on the statement that my pain is mostly mental."
coolguides,ffnwd0h,t1_ffnsv6b,1580071588.0,"That’s kind of hard for chronic pain patients. Chronic pain often leads to depression, so healthy emotions are somewhat difficult - even with antidepressants. A flare, or even just a bad day can lead to what some refer to as “painsomnia”, where it hurts so much that you can’t fall asleep. And if the chronic pain comes with certain chronic conditions like ehlers danlos, fibromyalgia, or similar illnesses, then exercise is going to be a little complicated. Yes, they certainly would like to be more active than the physical therapy they may be fortunate enough to receive, but if your joints dislocate from doing pretty much nothing, then you’d be careful about what exercises you did, too. 

It’s not as simple as having the right attitude or state of mind. Chronic pain is very complicated, and often dependent on the underlying causes. With chronic pain from physical injuries, there are different treatments than for pain caused by other health issues - autoimmune disorders, connective tissue disorders, neurological disorders."
coolguides,ffnrgth,t1_ffnp5z4,1580069775.0,"So, you’re saying what, exactly? That people can will themselves not to be in pain? That only weak people are suffering from chronic pain because they’re not trying hard enough? 

Pain is a really complicated subject because it’s so individual. Even pain scales are pretty much useless, because you’re 10 could be a 3 for me. And while you can test tolerance to certain outside stimuli, that says nothing about how people feel pain coming from within their own bodies. Some people say that shingles is the worst pain they’ve ever felt, while it’s only on a 9th place on my top 10. It’s really not as easy as just willing yourself out of something that is certifiably painful."
coolguides,ffnk7lv,t1_ffmkxmj,1580067067.0,"Yeah, as someone with chronic pain, I’m calling BS. I’ve been diagnosed with several conditions, after years of exams and procedures. It’s only all in my head in the sense that that’s where my pain is processed by my brain."

AmItheAsshole,ffhjlhd,t1_ffex5k7,1579938223.0,"Yeah, I’m disabled, and honestly, this is a bit extreme. A lot of cafes don’t provide any special seating, and people still manage. Right now, I can still mostly get around with my cane, but I might need a walker or even a wheelchair in the not too distant future. If I can sit at a regular table, then there’s no need to cause a fuss. I think this was more about this being HER table. 

There’s plenty of discrimination and shittiness towards disabled people out there, don’t get me wrong. But this was a grey area. Amy could have used a different table, she could have made an arrangement with the manager to have someone clear the table for her. The student could have moved (or simply studied at a library instead). I don’t see how this was some terrible offense. It could have been handled better, but it’s not a disaster."

niceguys,ffes561,t1_fferdwa,1579862899.0,"Well, that’s a complicated question, because I have been in pain since I was 13 years old. It started with headaches, then came the migraines. I have always been hyper mobile, and my spine has been a problem since childhood. The lower back portion of my spine is twisted, and it partially dislocates from time to time. When I got into my twenties, my shoulder started to hurt. I couldn’t move my arm some days. That started the exams and procedures, and as time went on, it started to spread. Eventually, all my joints started to hurt. They became stiff in the morning, and were simultaneously so loose that they would partially dislocate several times a day. My muscles started to ache because they kept compensating and trying to keep my joints in place. Now, they’re constantly cramping.

Women, like most human beings, are more than just shallow, greedy, calculating sex objects. We have actual personalities, with independent thoughts, opinions and tastes.

AmItheAsshole,fe87a6d,t1_fe57q7k,1578923372.0,"It’s also entirely plausible that the sisters resentment stems from her mother passing when she was so young. If they were in their teens, the youngest could have been as young as 10 or eleven. And even if she was 13, at that age your not always very rational. She may have been angry at her mother for dying so young, and never processed those feelings. It’s really heartbreaking to think about."

TooAfraidToAsk,fe6zpp9,t1_fe6wbtv,1578908215.0,Exactly! I bought a singular fork with a black handle because my husband was against changing out all of our cutlery. It’s the perfect fork. He doesn’t care as long as it’s clean.

wildlypenis,fdwwu51,t1_fduoilj,1578763084.0,"Yeah, that’s not gonna do much good. It’s too smooth, so there won’t be any traction. And most women don’t shove things up their vagina when they masturbate. We kinda focus on the clitoris (it’s not called “ringing the devils doorbell” for nothing), and for that this thing seems pretty impractical."
wildlypenis,fdtuj51,t3_en2tek,1578722425.0,I’m really curious how you’re supposed to masturbate with that. Seems impractical.

After about 15 minutes, I pretended to answer my cellphone and had a pretend conversation about how the emergency pharmacy fortunately did have that stuff for my explosive diarrhea, but I’d have to change my pants anyway.

I’m still getting used to my new limitations, and it’s potentially harmful and dangerous to ignore them in order to “try harder”. Fuck that noise."
