Cypher System for being able to handle just about any theme you throw at it, and having a lot of fun existing settings. 


Battletech Alpha Strike for a much less crunchy version of the original wargame, so light in comparison it gives room for more RP fun. Not specifically and rpg though.

ketogains,ffyxg9q,t1_ffxqvo6,1580357612.0,"Thanks. I've got some pretty bad issues with mental health and self-esteem, so I'm trying to work on those in tandem with the gym. I keep hearing a lot of anecdotes about people tapping out on keto whilst strength training too, so I'm trying to not fall victim to the placebo effect!

I was surprised (or not) at how strongly my reactions were to some clients' past behaviours. As I'd always grown up thinking (as a kid from a welfare family in a poor neighbourhood) there are a lot of systemic, intergenerational and familial/environmental factors that can drive behaviour.  

Which was less the focus in psychology other than the biopsychosocial model. I feel like I have too big an awareness now of the various facets not to treat people as equal humans and use my understanding NOT to justify behaviour, but see how it occurs. 

When advocating for clients I'll often be asked by all manner of services and people why I'm still advocating for them with X behaviour - my mantra is 'Behaviour doesn't have to be justified or accepted, but can always be understood'."

2. I have had my perceptions of a lot of socially disadvantaged groups that I held strong personal feelings for shattered, particularly criminals and perpetrators of family violence.

Having spent from 2008 to now in direct service work, I'd say the housing/homelessness sector is the craziest I've worked in. Have also worked in disability, mental health, family violence and justice. 

I am pretty past the frontline case management work and am currently applying for roles in the macro sphere of things. Beauty of social work training is that encompasses a very, very wide net of roles, strengthens your onus on systemic issues at work and is rewarding.

Now, having bipolar means that could've gone from latent to springing itself at any time at some stage, but work stress was definitely the instigator.

They're about to start their own community, and many NPCs have joined on the strength of their know how with helping and aiding other towns and communities.

I ran a game for a guy in a short arc that had 2 sesikii who acted as sniffers for delving, backup etc, and he totally leaned into the 'im a dog guy's charm angle in the social aspect of his character. It was actually really fun to RP on both ends."
