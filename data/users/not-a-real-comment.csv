I totally get why it isnt a French name but French names still make up a good portion of common names in Canada.  Also, it just seems so different than my experiences. Ive met maybe one person who has Smith as a last name, that I know about, so it strikes me as odd that I havent come across more"

Cannabis isnt so much a progressive/conservative issue, though it often ends up being because of parties, its more of an authoritarian/libertarian issue.  Amsterdam is a city but, ya, we are ahead of the issue on that aspect when it comes to european countries. 

Ya we are 9th but peoples perceptions of us are kind of over generalizations and not necessarily true. Some people even buy into false information about our laws, like Jordan Peterson and the Ontario Human Rights code and people just get the wrong idea.

I never said anything about the police, not sure where youre getting that from.  No place is 100% safe, shit can happen everywhere and you should take reasonable precautions. Its just that simple.

Ive never heard anyone describe every politician as right wing.  The conservatives get flack for being right wing and liberals get flack for being centrist, its not like the NDP dont get flack for being left wing.  Its the nature of politics to talk negatively about policies you disagree with its just easy to describe economics on the left right spectrum.  If you dislike 2 right wing politicians who may not be on the exact same spot on the spectrum, why are you obliged to advocate their policies for them?  Let them distinguish themselves.  Its not that people get shoved on to half a spectrum, its comparing where they are relative to other politicians.  Im fairly certain most people on the left would consider Bernier more right wing than Scheer.  Ive never heard anyone not admit to that.  People are advocating for their cause its an important aspect of democracy."
