depression,fd9k5mq,t3_ekcmjk,1578234533.0,"What if an unrepentant pedophile were to read this? Or a murderer, or a rapist? Would you ""love"" them just the same? What the fuck does love mean to you?"
depression,fcx93d7,t3_ej4ay4,1578056021.0,"You're 9 weeks? You're way too young to have a baby!
Hope this little bit of humor helps. I'm sorry for what happened, dear."
SuicideWatch,fcx8sgd,t3_ejd1jw,1578055713.0,"In summary: don't kill yourself because there are good things and people will miss you. Those ""arguments"" are often repeated, but they are missing the point. The ""people will miss you"" is ridiculous, it expects you to live for others, not for yourself. The ""there are good things"" for some insane reasons assumes depressed people don't know about whatever well-known ""good"" thing is being talked about. Just because they're written pretty doesn't make these ""arguments"" any less empty."
SuicideWatch,fcx8ber,t1_fcvdoqc,1578055224.0,It's a terrible justification. Being natural doesn't mean it's right.
depression,fcx81rr,t3_eizsdo,1578054943.0,"They are the same thing. There is no ""right way"" to live. Though it would be preferable not to have depression, you're not less alive because of it."
StardewValley,fcmx1ic,t3_ei1cn3,1577796077.0,That looks like a lot of work. Why don't you ask Kent to help you with your D-Day?
SuicideWatch,fcmwmjk,t1_fcmwg9s,1577795589.0,"It's ok, you're just trying to help. It's just that too many people don't read it and try the generic uplifting texts, it gets frustrating. The mods will probably remove your post soon, though."
SuicideWatch,fcmwacy,t3_ei0gh1,1577795183.0,"Wanna give us something to read, why don't you read this subreddit's guidelines first?"
limerence,fcmvqa6,t3_ei1yrw,1577794488.0,"There's a third option, which is therapy. It will hurt as well, but will lead you to a happier and possibly limerence-less future."
SuicideWatch,fcmutsq,t1_fcmucwg,1577793325.0,"Gah, my curiosity is almost getting the better of me, I really want to know what it was, but unfortunately I understand your desire for privacy. But I think I know what it is. Well, friends come and go. I know very well how hard it is losing a best friend, but eventually you get over it (though that ""eventually"" can sometimes last a long, long time). It'll hurt, yeah, but you can always find new friends."
SuicideWatch,fcmtyh3,t1_fcmth8w,1577792134.0,"The first forgiveness you need is your own. The victim's would also help, but it may never come, so you'll just have to live with that. I'm assuming the victim is that best friend of yours, and that the crime was sexual. Am I correct? Nonetheless, though you may deserve punishment for your actions, please understand that you still deserve to live."
NotHowGirlsWork,fclofuv,t3_ehedwp,1577752590.0,"Uhm, no... there are human beings that go into heat daily! They're called firefighters!"
limerence,fcl5rn3,t3_ehr1p9,1577740408.0,"You need to understand that it's not that simple for some people. Just because it works that way for you doesn't mean it will work that way for everyone. Please don't say ""you don't need therapy"". This condition is more complex than the experiences of an individual."
SuicideWatch,fc3uhu8,t3_efyay1,1577398954.0,Change therapists and report him.
SuicideWatch,fc17syj,t1_fc0jhos,1577310709.0,"What a thoughtless answer. There's a guide on this subreddit teaching you how to properly help people. You're not supposed to say ""it gets better"" or similar stuff."
