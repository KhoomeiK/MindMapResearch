smalldickproblems,ffeabzg,t3_est1dz,1579841128.0,"I seen you say that you're a guy, and I would assume that it's easier as a gay guy to be open about it on dating sites or hookup apps. For instance, it seems like you would get some bites if you put that onto a Grindr profile..."
gonewild,ffdz7v6,t3_esxsr9,1579832608.0,Sometimes I see a woman that looks like you and it's like my brain kinda glitches out. It's hard for me to wrap my mind around the fact that women as hot as you actually exist in real life...
amiugly,ffd3jj9,t3_esv6ai,1579812721.0,"I get your sentiment and agree to an extent, but in the world, there's a clear divide in the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" when it comes to looks and general attractiveness. Theres a difference between someone being generally attractive and being niche attractive. Like me, for example, I would objectively (I'll say) be considered ugly. You might find an odd person here and there that might find me not ugly, but on a general scale, I'm ugly af. If a girl that's a regular poster on GW posts here, no one is going to think she's ugly, even if she did for some weird reason. And that's the point of this sub. It doesnt have anything to do with your own opinion about yourself. So whether you think your ugly via dysmorphia or whatever, it doesnt matter."
milf,ffcgcak,t3_essw6x,1579798858.0,"That's such a fantasy of mine, finding a hot milf wearing a dress like that with nothing under it, teasing me, and then letting me have my way..."
StarWarsLeaks,ffc5fup,t1_ffc4p48,1579791957.0,"Your comment backs up the idea that no matter what anyone did with Ep. 9, it was a lose-lose situation. Yes, there are things someone could have done to please the majority of the audience but that stuff was just never going to happen. Johnson just painted them into too specific of a corner with what they could do."
RateMyNudeBody,ffc58v5,t1_ffc2au7,1579791828.0,"Possibly. I dont really look at it as judging every girl against another. I can see two different body types and think they're both an 8/10. On the same token, I've seen skinny girls that I would give a 10/10, so it just depends on a lot of varying factors."
RateMyNudeBody,ffc1tu2,t1_ffbxpfb,1579789402.0,"Personal taste, like you said. I'm way more attracted to this girl and her body type. I'd be more likely to give her an 8/10 than I would some really skinny, petite girl that posts on GW."

StarWarsLeaks,ffaorsw,t1_ffamboz,1579740959.0,"It does make Kylo look weak. Not to mention, were they ever going to address the issue of Palpatine's master being Darth Plagueis? Seems like a strange plot hole."

Even my closest family members, I can tell them I'm suicidal and I might as well have told them I stubbed my toe. It's so foriegn to them."

SquaredCircle,fehj2iz,t3_ep384j,1579117561.0,"While I think there are many things that make AEW much more enjoyable for me, the crowd would probably be at the top of the list. It can make or break a show, and for the most part, WWE's crowds in the last several years have just sucked all the oxygen out of the room, save for usually the RAW after Mania. Of course, I'm not speaking about NXT crowds."
relationship_advice,feg3itv,t1_feg32gb,1579075307.0,"Fair enough. He might one day look back on it and wished he had been able to salvage the friendship but to be honest, he's more likely to just never wish he'd told her his feelings, which again, he would have experienced pain over. When you're caught in that situation, its honestly a lose/lose."

relationship_advice,fefrk2j,t3_eoqgd1,1579063122.0,"Yeah, your friendship is done. But you shouldn't resent him for it. It's just the way it worked out. I would honestly feel the same way he did and would react accordingly. I'm not saying you're to blame at all, you dont have feelings for him. But as a guy, shooting your shot on a girl that you have feelings for, especially one you are already close with and have known for a long time, and you get rejected, all you want to do is run and never look back. Don't blame him."
relationship_advice,fefrdzb,t1_fef0ql3,1579062992.0,"How would that cause him more pain in the long run? A fast, clean break like that is less painful. You must have never been in the situation."

smalldickproblems,fef44jh,t3_eon8g3,1579047728.0,"I dont understand how incel became such a blanket term for so many guys. There are lots of different feelings and ideologies that fall under the term. I would consider myself literally an incel, as I'm involuntarily celibate because I can't find anyone, but I dont believe some of that dumb shit like women are property, etc."

smalldickproblems,fedx6ue,t1_fecs9dr,1579021785.0,"Are you still friends with this other person? If so, don't be. That would be the first step in trying to fix this. Other than that, sadly, there isn't much you can do. Unless you can get him to just mentally accept that you DIDN'T tell her that, and just enforce how much you love him and how happy he makes you. Don't talk specifically about his dick. The less attention brought to it, the worse, even if it's good attention. What I mean is, even if you keep complimenting him about it, it keeps the subject alive and the thoughts fresh. Even if you keep telling him how much you love his dick, while that's a good thing, just the conversation alone keeps it fresh in his mind. It's just something he is going to have to deal with mentally and emotionally within himself."
depression,fecsmex,t3_eofgoa,1578983051.0,"I'm in the same boat. I'm one of the very few people I know that, if I died tomorrow, nothing would change in anyone's life. Sure, my family and friends would be sad for a few days but really nothing about anyone's life would change in the least."

movies,fe92lo0,t1_fe86fq7,1578933492.0,Me too! My biggest disappointment by far. I was hoping against hope that it would be that little oddball flick that could sneak in with a best pic nom. The fact that Dafoe got snubbed for best supporting actor is an absolute tragedy.
datingoverthirty,fe8pjbm,t3_env27f,1578928912.0,"All this talk of ""reversing the genders"" is nonsense. Men and women are different. We take compliments and flirting in entirely different ways. It would be an interesting social experiment to say that to 20 men and 20 women and see the reactions. I guarantee the VAST majority of men would be very happy and flattered and interested in you with that kind of comment. Women, however, it would probably be the opposite, unless it was a really attractive guy giving the compliment. Most guys really appreciate a woman being that forward. I wish more were."
amiugly,fe8h7yb,t3_eo0d96,1578926094.0,"What a stupid argument. How many of those people are well outside of your age range. For example, I'm 34. How many of those fall within an acceptable dating age range for me? How many of those people live in far off lands that I will never visit, speak languages I don't? How many of those people aren't compatible with me because of hobbies, interests, belief systems, etc.? Nice try."
movies,fe8f1pt,t3_eo00jp,1578925469.0,"Movies like this bring joy to my heart. And not because I think it'll be good, but because I know it's going to bomb and a movie studio is going to lose a shit ton of money on it. One of life's great mysteries to me is how movie studios and executives can be so insanely out of touch to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on these terrible movies that no one gives a shit about."

movies,fdppte3,t3_eml958,1578635972.0,Weird. I've been seeing all over the internet that this project had already been dropped. I'm not a huge Star Trek fan but the series deserves something good.
