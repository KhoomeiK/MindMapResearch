$9.49 for a footlong steak and cheese by me. The local sandwich shop grills their steak to order, slices their cheese to order, and has fresh cut veggies and really delicious bread and charges the exact same $9.49 for it. Why would I ever pick subway?

And fuck $3 to add chips and a drink? I get they need to drive profit but for $3 I can buy a big bag of hot Cheetos on sale at the grocery store and a 2L of soda. They want $3 for a little bag and a 20oz soda? Give me a break. Lunch at subway with a footlong chips and drink is pushing $13, no thank you."

conspiracy,fepbq7x,t1_fen9jqq,1579316633.0,"I don’t get why travelers don’t all get a nice travel card. I have a Sapphire Reserve, costs $450 a year (going up to $550 after April) but with it I get $300 reimbursed on travel each year automatically, so in reality it costs me $150. Then factor in free global entry, so that bumps it down to $50 for the first year. Then included priority pass membership, and one lounge visit is about $50 so already the card is paid for.

Even if you don’t fly frequently, it’s worth it. Every time I fly, I will go to the lounge and have a snack plus 2-3 drinks. Same when I am returning. Anyone who flies knows a snack at the airport is about $10 and each drink also about $10, so round trip lounges save me about $80. Flying once a month that is $960 in savings over the year. Well worth it in my book.

Only thing that sucks is more and more people are realizing what a good deal these cards are so the lounges are starting to get more and more crowded. I’m hoping soon maybe some companies release a credit card that has a $1k yearly fee or something and offers access to “premium” lounges, offering better food and drink plus less crowded."

So basically, just the bowls but I heard you can ask for any burrito to be put into a bowl so you don’t have to eat the tortilla. 

It won’t be too easy though as Mexican food was literally designed to be cheap while high in calories. A cuisine heavy on beans, rice, cheeses, avocados and sour cream will be hard to diet on lol"

Since we worked in the field take out was what we opted for mostly, and I ate a lot of BK simply because it was the only place to get non breakfast food.

The juiciest burgers I ever had were always at those places that make thick burgers and cook them fresh, literally had juices drip out the back as I took a bite. Otherwise for fast food I would say probably the McDonald’s quarter pounder now that they make it fresh to order. Wendy’s doesn’t freeze their beef but they aren’t as juice because the burgers are cooking then left to sit in the warmer until you order it and they put it all together, so the juices kind of run off or evaporate and make the burger not juicy."

I like the 2 whopper jr and 2 small fry meal. Still very filling and closer to the 1,200 calories mark so it is also pretty high but not “I can’t eat anything else today” high lol"

Jokes aside I have a love/hate with the nuggets being $1.49. Back before they were this cheap, I used to get the deal that was a large fries and 10 nuggets for $3. This was back when 10 nuggets was about $4 so a solid deal.

The nuggets suck now because BK cooks a ton and lets them sit forever because so many people order them as they are so cheap. Any fast food nugget sucks when they sit out. If you ask for them fresh they are pretty okay."
BurgerKing,fdd7l3x,t1_fcwrrih,1578298375.0,"You can also find inconsistencies with app pricing and store pricing. I remember like last week I was ordering BK via the app and noticed every sandwich except the whopper jr had the option for free bacon. 

I also found on the McDonald’s app they have the same fuck ups. Last time I was flying I was in Denver airport and the line was long so I decided to mobile order. Noticed McDoubles were $1 in app when I saw on the menu they were selling for $2.49 (pretty high but normal for airports). So I ordered 2 then I noticed that a side of bacon bits was free. Never had this before so decided fuck it and ordered 5 sides of them. What they ended up giving me was 10 strips of bacon in the big breakfast container. So for a total of $2 I had two McDoubles and a literal pile of bacon strips, where this would have been $10 at the register (2.49 per sandwich and $1 per side order of bacon)

The luckiest I ever got with the app was a few years ago when they were doing the 2 for $3. The local store put them in the app at a price of $0.00 for all the 2 for $3 options. So I got some buddies and we went to test this, we ordered like 12 bacon McDoubles and a side of apple slices (mobile order total had to be above $0 and these were 50 cents). They gave us all that food for just $0.54 after tax, but this was fixed by the end of the day and I didn’t abuse it anymore because I felt bad lol. 

Also a side tip for McDonald’s, if you order a sandwich and add Mac sauce, it’s extra. If you tell them “substitute ketchup for Mac sauce” then it’s no charge. Worked every time I did this, because apparently on the point of sale the add and sub buttons are different. I haven’t tested this theory further, but I have a feeling that maybe you can even get away with a substitution like “sub onions for an extra patty” or “sub mustard for bacon” at no charge"
BurgerKing,fdd6y26,t3_ekf24e,1578297525.0,"Last time I was at BK they had no sign so when I said I wanted zesty sauce when they were giving me my food they said it’s extra.

BurgerKing,fdd6vze,t3_ekfrxg,1578297450.0,"50 cents for onion? I think BK is the only restaurant to charge for those, even at Taco Bell where they charge extra for literally every single ingredient gives onions for free.

I was always curious about profit margins, if you do $5k a week it means about half of that is spent on labor (I just used 2 employees 14hrs a day at $12 an hour, which I know is on the high end and not always 2 people are working) and considering how long those cases last I am sure ingredient costs are not insanely high. I used to hear on this subreddit a lot that franchises are struggling to profit but if even a slow store appears to make a good profit I am wondering where they are going wrong."
redditbay,fdd5ian,t3_eka80l,1578295687.0,Just curious but why didn’t you just use them to buy gift cards then sell the gift cards for like 80% of the value to card pool?
subway,fdd4wh2,t1_fdd4dts,1578294926.0,"At all the subways by me we have the meatball for $2.99.

Also I wasn’t aware that Turkey costs more to order. How many sandwiches can you make from a case of meat? That’s a pretty big jump in price considering at the local grocery store the difference between ham prices and turkey prices is usually less than $1 per pound."
funny,fdd4d0s,t1_fdcm3ev,1578294265.0,"This is what always blew my mind. People criticize these companies yet keep giving them money.

It’s like getting pissed your child is addicted to drugs but every week you continue to give them money whenever they ask."
subway,fdd41b5,t1_fchbpwg,1578293879.0,I picture them saying this as they are walking thru the door not even near the sandwich making station 😂
subway,fdd3xiu,t1_fcn20ph,1578293757.0,Does this mean any remaining stock is just old? Earlier today I was at a subway and they had it.
subway,fdd390v,t3_ejq4ie,1578292983.0,"Lol what a cheap owner, how much could a 6in portion of steak even cost. My local subway doesn’t even weigh the meats they just use a scoop to place it and they give much more than the other subways that weigh them out."
subway,fdd30k9,t1_fd6gppz,1578292722.0,"Yep and if a bad reputation is built it takes a long time to fix. At my old house there was a subway nearby but I drove to another one (only an extra 2 minute drive) just because the team there sucked. I eat subway almost every day for lunch and during lunch they always had this miserable guy who was one of the owners working and he would short the fuck out of every veggie and talk under his breath about you when you asked for more. If I skipped lunch and went for dinner it was his brother or something and he would try to speed run your sandwich and it was always such a mess, ingredients all over and bread sometimes ripped. 

That store now loses out on about ~$200 a month from me alone since I now go to the other subway to eat, and I am sure I’m not alone."
subway,fdd2sfk,t3_ekgd9o,1578292473.0,"Flatbread with meatballs, double meat, then 3c the regular portion of tomatoes."

Damnthatsinteresting,fdctek0,t3_ekm3gb,1578283785.0,So if you want to get something past airport security just check a bag and put that item into a jar of iodine?

Kind of how I broke up this comment. Wasn’t really necessary, but seems easier to read lol"

todayilearned,fdbvzkv,t1_fda0i4m,1578262731.0,Funny part is the gravy is shit and I think McDonald’s is good for what it is.
todayilearned,fd98dlo,t1_fd972jc,1578229850.0,Usually it is with flour which is what gives it the consistency.
AdviceAnimals,fd91ns4,t3_ek6mai,1578226925.0,Trump kills a terrorist and leave it to the bots of Reddit to try to sway public opinion. Remember when the Syrian airport was bombed and nothing came of it? Remember when the hospital was bombed and nothing came of it?
todayilearned,fd91ab7,t3_ek0slo,1578226719.0,"What’s this? A money hungry man tried everything he could to profit but at the end of the day he had to do whatever it took to appease workers?

Yep, capitalism has failed."
