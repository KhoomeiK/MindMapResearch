> The State Department will also issue you a second passport if the travel stamps you already have in your passport will deny you entry to other countries you wish – or need – to visit. The most common example of this is having Israel stamps in your passport and wanting to go to Iran or Syria. In order to get in, you'll need a new passport without Israel stamps.

Might be able to use it the other way, make the case that you want to go to Iran but you don't want to be restricted from going to other places based on that stamp."
