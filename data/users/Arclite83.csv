todayilearned,ff644tm,t1_ff5mq3g,1579618660.0,"Yep, really-really! I'm a senior architect at a major healthcare software company, I'm part owner of my own contracting firm, and I have made (and continue to tinker with) games on my own, usually for ""beer money"" equivalent monies.

My main employer has a sponsored DeepRacer team, check it out, some cool stuff there. I haven't had nearly enough time to get ""serious"" with it. but I do own a CUDA-ready video card and I've toyed with the idea of just training some networks locally on my own, we get a lot of Amazon server time but it feels wasteful if I'm not actually tweaking a race-ready algorithm.

I'm in design discussions literally later on today for some cutting-edge AI work that I can't really talk about - sorry if that's too vague, but I'm kinda stuck in that sense. But yeah, that's my job.

...and really, if somehow I WASN'T doing those things, I'd find spare time to do them myself regardless. I'm the kind of guy who rolls out of bed and says ""hrm, maybe I'll teach myself Unity today"". That's the attitude that got me where I am; I taught myself Android on the side by making a podcast app, which eventually led to a mobile team position and learning iOS on a company's dime.

All these tools are available online for FREE - I would have killed for this as a kid, instead I was stuck coding chess on my TI-83 so we could play in study hall. I have an old tome somewhere for Alchemy, the original Doom level creation tool. I surf YouTube instructional videos pretty much constantly - 2 Minute Papers, Brackeys, and many more.

I've turned down literal dream jobs because right now I have the flexibility to basically work from anywhere, on my own schedule - I made the call years ago to put family first. That's the double-edged sword of loving your work sometimes.

I mean... don't believe me if you don't want to, that's cool. But yeah, I'm ""living the dream"" - or at least, my dream."

todayilearned,ff344sa,t1_ff3078a,1579533200.0,"As much as I loved playing with Legos as a kid, yeah. To me, coding is like that, except I can make any custom Lego shapes I want. I've made everything, from games to government systems, restaurant ordering apps to custom factory equipment. I get to meet and interact with people doing the same, from cutting edge cochlear implants, to deep neural networks that will detect and target/remove cancer better than ever before, to the tech behind self driving cars.

""Convince myself""? Nah, I'm pretty sure I loved all of this from the moment I decided I liked making STUFF. The only reason I'm not making puzzle boxes or designing escape rooms or something, is because tech and coding has fewer ""limits"" on what I can invent: if I can dream it, I can make it appear on the screen.

And it turns out, making other people's dreams appear on the screen is worth a pretty penny, so... I do a bit for me, a bit for the customers, and everyone's happy.

I love my work, because I'm passionate about making just about ANYTHING."

There's not much an internet stranger can do for you, and your support system seems weak to this; they all left the situation. One day you will likely too, and maybe that's for the best, but it should ideally come from a position of strength and growth.

Find a therapist. Find coping mechanisms, and realize his verbal abuse and the anxiety and fear of future screamings are a big part of what's bringing you down. Imagine him as an equal; you're an adult now too. This isn't how normal people should speak to each other, and it's not okay. When he raises his voice, respond with calmness and civility. Don't expect him to be the bigger person, because he sounds pretty awful. But that should not stop you from raising your own bar. And you should never allow someone to make you feel that low.

Depression isn't your fault, but it is your responsibility. Coping mechanisms and therapy will go a long way to healthy boundaries and you making positive steps in your life; the cleaning and care will come along with that, but you do it for YOU, not him. Set a standard as if you lived alone."

We're not perfect, but we try. And this messy broken world, with wars and famine and country class systems where the strong stand on the backs of the weak is quite simply ""just"" how we operate as a species. We use MANY tricks of government/etc to try and outsmart our baser natures, like consistently passing power, finding ways to communicate with each other and bridge boundaries, but it's a BIG rock and in the end you can easily live and die without fully appreciating your position in all of it, by design or not, because in the end YOU are alone in your head, and so is everyone else. We are limited, and all the moral philosophy in the world can't change that, even when people come at things with their purest best - and we don't even do that yet, usually.

Anyone ""can"" become rich, but few beat the odds. And wealth isn't a measure of good or bad; if anything, it simply drives home that the best AND the worst of humanity are rich. More money just (generally) means more power, but what you do with it varies - just like anyone with power... and we're back to the ""tricks"" we use to make us better than our natures.

So ya, back to this. When the world gets tougher by degrees (global warming, lack of water, etc), who's going to shell out for the fixes? Those that can afford it, or are in positions where those in power can provide it to them - and that means those people can all continue to not think about it, and what it means for those who can't."
