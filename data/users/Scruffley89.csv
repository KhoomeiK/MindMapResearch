I think you're also missing the point in that turning animal suffering in to entertainment is the issue here. Inadvertently causing suffering as a means to an end isn't nice, but causing pain deliberately for no other reason then you enjoy it is another injustice entirely and speaks of a disturbing mind."
rage,ffcoizc,t1_ffc0t0f,1579803851.0,"I've recently gone back to being veggie, as yes the meat industry is awful. You simply can't produce meat on a large scale without sacrificing the wellfair of the animals to an unacceptable degree.

But the avarage person who eats meat doesn't know this. They've grown up on it and have never been encouraged to question this. It isn't something they see, and they would have to go out of their way to do so. Not that ignorance is an excuse, just that it's more of a societal problem then an individual one. In these circumstances it's rarely very productive to attack the individual. From their point of veiw, you're unjustly attacking them for very widely shared sets of values. 

Shock tactics rarely work either, as that will just encourage people to put up a defensive wall. What's much, much more healthy and productive is to be understanding with people, and open up a dialogue.

From a point of mutual understanding, you can put forward your reasoning in a manner that leaves both parties feeling respected and listened to. Once people have been allowed to relax and let their guard down, you'll often find they agree with you on a lot of points anyway.

Also, that said I will have to call you out on your false equivalency here. Eating an animal is selfish yes, but actively attempting to see how much pain and discomfort is something entirely different. You don't have to be a sadist to enjoy the taste of pork, callous to or unawareof its suffering yes, but this guy actually gets a kick out of causing as much suffering for as long as possible. That's something entirely more messed up."
rage,ffc28tm,t1_fdfh5ni,1579789714.0,Ah. Thank you for explaining the issue because god knows what the article said. Right. Good on the ex mafia bloke for calling out a shitty rescue that's killing dogs despite saying they don't kill dogs.

rage,ffc0jro,t1_ff7d8ig,1579788430.0,"Yes but it doesn't make this good does it?

I don't get where you're coming from here, are you saying that it's OK to hurt animals for amusement because we hurt them for food? 
Are you arguing that people eating meat are as sadistic as this guy? 
Or are your just saying that you're a pussy if you eat meat and don't watch cows getting slaughtered.

Regardless, you're coming across as a bit of an insufferable edgelord I'm sorry."
creepyPMs,ffbt4l5,t3_esg5lh,1579781783.0,"I agree that it's probably best to just let him down nicely. He's a bit full on and obviously not totally socially clued up, a little weird maybe, but he probably just needs a gentle rejection to get the hint."

TumblrInAction,ffbi4g0,t3_esheyo,1579766355.0,"So we're just going to medically ignore that excess bodyweight is a thing. This was meant as an instructive insight in to the body, and if excess fat causes changes to the body, they're going to talk about it. Nobody should be made to feel disgusted or ashamed about themselves, but people also have the right to be informed.

I think it would be far more outrageous to deny that being overweight causes issues, and allow people to blindly get themselves in to medically unsafe states. 

Like if you are overweight and you know the issues but just don't care, fair enough. Your body your rules. But don't hide from others potentially life altering information."

creepyPMs,ff8thxs,t3_erhbyu,1579695500.0,"No you weren't in the wrong. This guy is also not autistic, he's (poorly) attempting to manipulate you.

If you're ever unsure, good solid red flags to watch for are;

Calling you pet names

Repeatedly bringing up topics of a sexual nature

Repeatedly bringing up their personal kinks or attempting to use terminology related to it

Continuing to push for something from you (a picture, your number, where you live, even just a reply after you've told them to stop)

Continuing to repeat any behaviour that you've explained to them is uncomfortable for you

Not respecting your wishes after you've told them to stop or said ""no"".

HAVING A PARTNER AND WANTING YOU TO BE A SECRET BIT ON THE SIDE

Run when you hear the words ""she doesn't have to know"" Run far. You were right to block this dude. He doesn't deserve your patience, or the relationship he had with his gf."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fe26jts,t1_fdqps61,1578835042.0,"No. It is not. You're a good person trying their hardest to do their best, but have just been put down and disorientated by an abuser in to thinking exactly what they want you to think. He wants you to question whether you are a good person.

The sickest thing about narcs is that they pick on people who are naturally giving and who want to do good by others. They play on those fears, knowing that by constantly telling you you're displeasing them or not good enough, they'll get you right where they want you.

You aren't weak, you just care. You aren't bad, he's just deliberately starving you of love."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fe20oml,t1_fdqjw93,1578833237.0,"Oh gosh that makes things so much worse, I'm sorry. But at the end of the day it's your life to live, and no one can expect you to stay with someone who isn't good for you and makes you unhappy. Also, if he's like this to you, he'll likely extend these controlling behaviours to your son. At the very least, these aren't good model behaviours for your son to learn from. 

I somewhat understand where your family are coming from. I know the feeling of being sucked in by a narc, and I know that they can be very charming. I didn't know my mum's husband was a horrible manipulator, despite having clocked all the warning signs. He'd sucked me in to accepting him as a family member, to the point I genuinely loved him as my stepdad.

But he had been financially, and towards the end, physically abusing my mother. We all had to cut him out, because he was so dangerous and manipulative. No matter how charming narcs may be, or how far they've burrowed in to your family circle, your family should support you in what you need to do. You are their daughter, and they should trust you and put your welfare first. 

That said I know this must make things a thousand times harder, especially if he's ground your self confidence down.

Think about what your future will look like with him. If you can't do it for yourself, think about how it will effect your son. For both of your safety, you need this man out of your life."

One of the things that narcs do is make you feel powerless and dependent on them, he's purposely making you feel as if you aren't strong enough to leave him but you are. Otherwise he wouldn't be preying on you to begin with. You can do this. Make up some excuse to go home, or just leave whilst he's in the bathroom/sleeping if you can. As soon as you're safe block him on everything. You're much stronger then he's made you believe."

creepyPMs,fcx8j0y,t3_ej33wq,1578055442.0,"No. Not at all. This guy is manipulating you to get what he wants, a cheap thrill at your expense. He's trying to search for any crack in your armour that he can use to get his way. You've handled this in a mature and respectful way and it's his fault he can't respect you.

It's down to you what you want to share, how much you want to share, and with who you want to share. Your body, you're the one with control over it. This guy is a nasty piece of work and you're right to feel unsafe giving him anything. 

Assholes like this have no right to dictate who you are, or what you can and can't do.

Just wanted to ad since I didn't know you were underage, that he shouldn't even be asking you this. This is 100% not your fault.

It's so difficult sometimes to separate what the illness is saying from the person, and even when you know they're not well it still hurts. He's really lucky to still have you around. It's good to hear that he has been improving, and that at least he does take medication when prompted. Watching these cycles of improvement and relapse are exhausting though, one of the worst things as you say is watching them slip back in to their illness knowing that mental health services will only step in when they're at crises point.

movies,fcjv0km,t3_eh8vv5,1577706088.0,"I won't leave any spoilers, but I just really want to share my experience with it here as a warning to others. After finding out it was losing money, I went ahead and saw it for a laugh. I wouldn't recommend anyone else do the same. 

Genuinely one of the most badly off-key, paceless, lazy excuses for a film ever to grace the screen. There's honestly B movies made as tax scams with better overall structure and development. So many bafflingly poor choices and oversights. The CG is so lazy you'll be left asking how they spent the amount of money they somehow did. Parts of characters actually clip through scenery, and one of the most persistent issues is that nothing has been scaled correctly. 

The characters seem to vary wildly in size in relation to background objects, and worst of all it gives their feet (their gross, gross feet) the constant appearance of floating on a thin layer of air just off the surface of the floor. Given that Cats is entirely about dancing, this is distracting to the point of making the film unwatchable. 

The pacing is the other main issue. Despite being about and hour and a half, you'll leave the cinema in what feels like 5 minutes. Weirdly though, scenes manage to drag on for what feels like an age, leaving key plot points largely forgotten to the last second. Nothing hangs together, it places focus on all the wrong elements, leaving the experience thin, hollow and hazy. 

There's a ton more to go on about, but film studies students will be writing essays on this as a case study for poor film making for decades to come. 

You won't have fun with this film. It actively seems to try to prevent you. Maybe borrow a copy off your friend for a rainy sunday evening in your dressing gown. You might get a bit of a giggle or a gasp, but it's just a waste on the big screen."
insaneparents,fcjoysj,t1_fcfc3wj,1577697334.0,"I agree. Had to cut off my father in the end, similar situation. Never officially diagnosed, but obviously bipolar. Self medicated with alcohol & did everything he could to avoid meds. Just got more unstable and destructive to the point that it was clear I had to disconnect, he was just becoming too dangerous.

You're a strong and kind person for sticking by him through this. It's such a crushing pattern of behaviour to deal with, one moment you're their best friend, the next they're calling you everything under the sun for reasons known only to them.

Even more alarming is the very familiar ""come save me from myself"" act. My stepdad once drove across the country because his similarly self medding/alcoholic bipolar brother was claiming to be on deaths door and needed urgent help. Got there to discover him down the pub laughing with his mates. These people will run you in ragged circles if you let them. 

Please, please make sure to take care of yourself first and foremost. You only have one life, be sure not to burn all your efforts trying to keep him afloat. At the end of the day, you can't make him take the help he needs. You can be there to support him in doing so, but what he can't expect you to do is to just take all of this grief. That's not what love is.

EDIT

Just want to clarify that I do not mean all people with bipolar are like this. Lots of people manage their illness responsibly even if they do struggle and have relapses. That's OK and totally normal, and it's more then OK to ask for support. What IS an issue is if you avoid help, despite the fact that you're continually damaging yourself and the lives of those around you."
