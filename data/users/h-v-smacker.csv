linux,fej6eoc,t1_fej58qu,1579158783.0,"These studies are a mixture of self-reporting and ratio assumption. People assume that:

(a) any deviation from the gender ratio in the general population is a sign of discrimination

and

(b) personal estimation of a situation is just as reliable as an objective expert opinion

The side (a) is ridiculous because it assumes there are no differences in interests and proclivities between genders, which we know is untrue — software development in particular is among those spheres which are not attractive to most women. The point (b) is basically leaving the respondents as the final judges of the situation, which means that the whole ""operationalization of variables"" stage is eradicated from the study.

There are also other research questions that are ignored or circumvented in such studies. For example: the gendering of input. It's not that often that you can identify the gender of a person in FOSS, especially post-factum from some logs or mailing lists alone; it also is far from clear whether the gender so established is (a) factually accurate and (b) the same as known to the actual participants at the time of events. Every procedure for doing so poses more questions than it answers. Another example: types of submissions. Not all submissions are equal. There are pull requests that replace inefficient algorithms with far superior implementations, and then there are pull requests fixing typos and indentation. There are pull requests for code and for artwork. There are pull requests that improve the code, and pull requests presenting problematic code written by someone who doesn't know what they are doing. Also consider purely ""ideological"" pull requests like removing ""master/slave"" terms or suggesting to adopt a CoC — a type of activism that not all genders are equally eager to do. And so on. I've yet to see a study who'd make an objective assessment of those qualities.

I hold a Ph.D. in political science, so designing empirical studies is my profession — and let me put it to you this way: if those studies had to go through me, I'd reject them all on basis on poor methodology and research design.

KotakuInAction,fe6bf1z,t1_fe5eksy,1578886148.0,"Well, some people say it all started long ago — right from the reboot. You see, in all the new-who series the lady companions were given a special role, even perhaps out-shadowing that of the Doctor himself, for his companions were vital for the overall story arc, the Leitmotif of a season or even several. I wouldn't say that is bad in itself, it's just a new concept for the storytelling, but as a harbinger of what was to come it's actually quite noticeable in hindsight.

Eccleston's and Tennant's series were quite spiffing overall, I would say.

But it got progressively worse over time.

Poor honest and decent dude Rory was constantly cucked by the Doctor and his fiancee.

The 12th doctor hoped the future is female. At the same time, his companion chastised alien warriors for being too violent saying (quote) ""the universe is full of testosterone"", basically telling them to go be men somewhere else. And yes, mind, she was knowingly speaking to aliens, for whom there is no reason to believe they are governed by the same hormones as human males. That wasn't a message for non-humans...

Then Clara Oswald died, while proving to be a staple upon which the very Doctor himself has been unwittingly hanging all this time. A new companion entered the scene — a black lesbian with no discernible talent, both as the character and the actual actress. Quite frequently the show now made a point to point out her gender, sexuality, or indeed why not both, lest anybody forgets why she is important. The writing quality dropped significantly, and about the only thing that made the show palatable was an immense acting talent of Peter Capaldi. 

Meanwhile, the writers, being as much of talentless hacks as they were, succeeded in shoehorning ""contemporary pressing issues"" into episodes — like racism (pointing out ""diversity"" in London of early 19th century and having the lesbian companion attacked for being a PoC) or sexism (an alien Ice Warrior queen specifically asks for the opinion of the single black lesbian woman, for she would not suffer the puny men in the room to keep running the show). At the same time, the Master returned, now played by Michelle Gomez, whose portrayal I actually quite approve — who was subsequently written out of the show despite obvious talent; nowdays the master is played by an unshaven unsympathetic man who probably never misses any of his three daily sets of six repetitions of munchies. I would say were it not for the bloody abysmal writing, Capaldi would be standing as equal alongside Tennant and Eccleston in my personal estimation.

And then the showrunners thought they were finally out of the narrow fairway and in the proper deep seas, and went full speed ahead. The doctor became a woman. On a side note, I must say I rather fancy Jodie Whittaker, she is cute and fun to watch, but even her costume was compiled by utter imbeciles. But again, the writing is such that whoever compiles the scripts is basically using their writing implement to drive in nails in the proverbial coffin of the show. At this point who gives a fuck, flying or otherwise, about the slacking off sods in the costume department. The main problem is that the showrunners don't even care about the established show ""truths"" for the sake of the Big Woke. It's all progressivist's cannon fodder now.

Consider this: the doctor abhors weapons, violence, and the military. This is an established fact, throughout the series the doctor looked down on people carrying weapons, scorned UNIT, tried to find peaceful resolution to the very end. But the new woke doctor is just smitten with a... (drumroll) ALIEN MILITARY GENERAL, because said general is a woman. Apparently, the whole stuff about violence and weapons and uniformed schmucks goes right out of the window now once the Penis Almighty exits stage left. Kill, steal, shag geese — all is forgotten if you're a woman, you're a hero to the doctor now. The same episode had a pregnant man, btw, but I'm sure someone already pointed that degeneracy out.

Another example: the pockets, which they managed to do in one episode even. The doctor used to love pockets... even said ""bigger on the inside"" one time in Tennant's days. The new doctor says ""I hate empty pockets"" — goes on to wear female clothing which traditionally has small or no pockets even. I just see the traditional gender roles curling in fear, trying to hide their feeble bodies in nearby nooks and crannies of collective memory.

Then there were obvious ""woke"" casting decisions. To please the Big Woke, the doctor now has three companions: a black young man, an old white man, and a young woman of Indian ancestry. Only one of them is played by an actor worth the dime — the old white man — and despite being traumatized by having lost his wife (who was black and female, btw) rather recently he's normally the butt of all jokes with negative male-related connotations. Like he is the only one told specifically not to panic in a plane which has its cockpit blown off. The actor playing the black dude has the same charisma as that football enthusiast in your class who was put in a school play forcibly by the teacher, and now participates reluctantly, with his male gaze averted towards the far blue yonder where the much coveted football field lies, hoping for this torture to pass as fast as possible. 

The young Indian woman, who is also a police officer (because, you know, ACAB, sure — but legit heroes when female, see above) is actually being treated as an accessory. It's not that much of lack of her talent as the literally misogynistic treatment of her by the showrunners. She's basically a living question machine most of the time: ""what is that bright yellow conduit, doctor?"" — ""oh, that, good thing you asked — very, very important... also very, very dangerous. Right, where's my sonic... here, I'll secure it in place lest Graham yanks it away as usual — anyway, this is zecktronic energy cable, will melt off your face if you damage the shielding, but no worries, any woman can easily deal with it."" She's not given any good, important tasks to do, no chances to display her personality — she's either ""there for diversity"", to prompt an explanation, or to add one more person to create suspense, since someone's gotta go run in terror from that Trump-loving arachnid of the day or something, amirite gentlemen?

But then again, even if they wanted to, the show just doesn't have enough screen time to cover 1+3 ensemble with the same depth as 1+1 or 1+2 of the previous series. So here they have basically driven themselves into a corner — something for which surely they blame the Invisible Hand of the Patriarchy or the dreaded angry males all over them internets. It also not helps that the showrunners pre-emptively shortened the first ""woke doc"" season, giving even less screen time to show anything meaningful about the characters. And being as it is, why would the viewers care about those utter strangers in imaginary dangers?

In recent episodes the head of British intelligence (played by Stephen Fry no less) assumed Graham (white old dude, in case that wasn't obvious) was the new incarnation, and was promptly femsplained by the doctor — ""I got an upgrade"", she said. Imagine it was the other way around, and the doctor would have said he was upgraded in the reverse direction.

Oh well. Guess I have written a shitload of text here. But yeah, the current doctor has less acting talent, no writing skills, no interesting plots or captivating villains, and all the wokeness a starving college kid can possibly stuff into 45 minutes of screentime to earn his daily soup bowl and a sandwich at the local Pret-a-manger. Bloody hell, they basically started with inserting ""Orange Man Bad"" into the show. The main actress struggled to find her own take on the character of the doctor, and only recently, as it seems, figured something out — by which time it's already sort of ""who cares"" for most viewers. I guess I'll simply wrap it up paraphrasing the scripture — God hates Chibs and Chibs' enablers."

KotakuInAction,fe0uk7v,t3_enf4rm,1578818805.0,"Let me share a very simple experiment design I have devised some time ago. The only pre-requisite for this procedure is an audience of left-leaning women.

The participants need to be asked the following:

— Do they consider themselves well informed and sufficiently educated on issues of sexism, patriarchy, and other means of societal conditioning of women's preferences?

— Do they consider themselves as having full agency over their current decisions, and full understanding of the implications?

Once affirmative answers to those questions are given, ask the main question:

— Who among you, after being properly informed, re-discovered passion for traditionally male occupations? Who opted to have a second education in a traditionally male field? Barring that, who tried to engage in such fields as an amateur? Barring that as well, who took on a traditionally ""male"" hobby?

Enjoy your blank stares.

Because it's always them those other women over there who are brainwashed by the patriarchy. Every gender theory and feminist studies major always think they have made a properly valid, informed choice to be exactly what they are, and to do what they do. Nobody of them managed to even slightly undo the supposed ""brainwashing"". In fact, they don't think they have been brainwashed into making ""traditionally female"" choices in the first place."

What if a town doesn't have a female mayor? How does that prove the existence of sexism? Voting in officials is not a random sampling process, its results do not have to be representative of the general population by any random parameter.

Do men and women voluntarily engage in politics with the same probability?

Do men and women who engage in politics go towards the electoral route with the same probability?

Do men and women who go along the electoral route support various policies with the same probability?

For example, your logic will fall apart if it turns out women prefer non-electoral political participation — petitioning, social movements, and so on. It will also fall apart if it turns out men and women prefer to embrace different policies. And so on.

Not to mention that most voters are actually women, so it's women who vote in men. Very nice of you to accuse millions of women of sexism. Or is it stupidity that makes them behave like that? Sorry, I'm sort of lost here."

It's like with quotas. I've read a blog post of a female software developer some time ago. She wrote that before her employer introduced ""diversity quotas"" to get more women for the woke cause, she was perfectly fine, accepted and respected as a professional. Once the quotas were established and quota hires got in, she experienced a change of attitude to herself, even from the people with whom she used to work since long before, and who had all the reasons to know she was not a ""quota hire"". PS: she ended up quitting the job, the environment became inhospitable.
