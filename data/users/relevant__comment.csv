The state has this weird affinity to burst into flames every year and apparently the “big one” is always just around the corner. So now I have two bags (one for wife and me) ready next to the door at all times.

AdviceAnimals,fckq1p1,t1_fckdiys,1577730721.0,"Honestly, when I was little (~8-9 years) I didn’t really take much from it. My dad did explain the meanings to me back then, but I was young and young people don’t really care about that stuff. 

Later, around late high school years, I started to  really understand the points and lessons that the poem touched on. I had another talk with my dad about it as well. Nowadays I’m really appreciative of the virtual head start that the poem gave me mentally. It really put me in a mindset to be grounded with the way that I carried myself and looked at things around my immediate being. Sorry that was a bit word-y."
