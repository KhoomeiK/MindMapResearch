WildlifeRehab,fgfooi5,t1_fgfjxug,1580744130.0,"We have a few different types of prey rings. In our 100ft flight cage it is built into the enclosure so it is a wooden ring that is lined with wire to prevent pretty from escaping. In our smaller aviary and mammal cages the entire cage is lined so we have the option to just release prey into the cage but we start with the pet in a contained ring. We have some prey rings that we can move in and out of cages that are lined boxes. For fish we have some cages with pools built into the and some times we use kiddie pools in the enclosure. 

We feed mostly frozen fish (that's been thawed)to our piscivores with sea tabs to compensate for nutrient loss as well. We have a pond on property so usually for shorebirds, wading birds, etc we will add live minnows to help entice self feeding."
WildlifeRehab,fgfj9ia,t3_ey1sfz,1580740261.0,"The facility I work at has different size prey rings depending on the cage size and animal being tested. We raise mice and rats for testing purposes and will purchase or catch fish and crustaceans as well (we work with all native and migratory birds and native mammals)  Generally it isn't a one and done situation. We start off with easy difficulty. For instance a smaller ring it ring with no obstacles and increase the difficulty as the animal proves it catches live prey. Increased difficulty can mean a larger prey ring and obstacles such as branches or brush they must get around to catch the prey. We also have invested in video cameras like go pros and trail cams to determine how the animal is catching prey and in some cases which animal is doing the catching(we raise many young raptors so they often get prey tested together since they are in the same cage). 

Each facility is different in what they are financially and physically able to provide. All of these are great questions and I would say if you have concerns or ideas don't be afraid to reach out to those in charge to help alleviate your fears or see either you can help facilitate construction of prey rings or fundraising to help expand the amount and variety of prey."
