No mate, he clearly came to the UK as a matter of survival. So much so that he chose being homeless for 21 years over going back home. How’s it possible to have such little empathy for your fellow man?

Also good job ending your comment by telling me to kill myself though, it really helps your side of the argument!"
london,fe21746,t1_fe207er,1578833395.0,"Ah yes here’s the comment I knew I’d get. The comment devoid of any empathy. The comment declaring that it’s better for a man to be sent to a country to die for wanting a better life, than to be allowed to stay and just be given the means to be able to get a job.

The asylum laws that meant Sunny got rejected 20 years ago are part of the problem. Sunny deserved the opportunity to at least become employed in this country. He absolutely should not have been rejected."
london,fe1xefj,t1_fe1uidd,1578831970.0,It hasn’t dried up. There is enough money. We still have an insanely high GDP. We could be a country who provides for all of its people but the government prioritises other things.
london,fe1w7ct,t1_fe1sz5e,1578831647.0,"Like I said, there are more than enough resources to fix homelessness but the government chooses not to. The solution would therefore be the government choosing to help. 

Since that probably won’t happen anytime soon, the next step is trying to get the government to act. Voting, protesting etc but this requires getting large amounts of the public to care.

Articles such as this help but it’s a hard battle to fight, especially with all the negative stigma to the homeless. But getting people to just care about those in our country who have the least, is probably step 1 of the solution."
london,fe1j977,t3_enl47s,1578827178.0,"I know Sunny doesn’t blame the government, but I absolutely do. Why was this man doomed to a life of homelessness for 21 years? It’s a miracle he managed to survive. This is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with one of the wealthiest cities in the world, yet the number of homeless keeps increasing. There’s enough resources to help them but the government chooses not to. Fuck the government. Fuck this country. I’m absolutely not proud to be a Brit when shit like this is accepted as normal."

GreenAndPleasant,fdz6wkx,t1_fdy9ijw,1578787246.0,"It’s important because the Daily Mail is the third most popular newspaper in the country, read by millions of voters.

GreenAndPleasant,fdz5i69,t1_fdyoxfx,1578786909.0,"It’s possible to not personally believe you are a racist, yet still do things which are considered racist. You’re essentially saying that doing racist things without explicit intent of being racist doesn’t make you a racist, whereas others are saying that despite the intent, committing racist actions makes you a racist. ESPECIALLY in this case where the Mail is fully aware of its racist actions. 

In other words, if you do something racist for the sake of making more money, that makes you racist."

They wouldn’t hire more than usual unless they need to grow. The truth is there is more than enough money to pay bus drivers a hell of a lot than they currently earn. They should also hire more drivers and reduce the hours required from current drivers (long hours are likely why 17% fall asleep). They can absolutely afford to do this, they just don’t want to because they can get away with paying them the minimum. In order to make them want to, drivers need to take actions like striking.
