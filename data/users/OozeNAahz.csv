The other important thing is to never ever buy other people drinks.  That is an evil feedback loop that will get you feeling obligated to drink whatever your generous friends buy you which takes your control out of your hands.  Don‚Äôt buy people drinks and don‚Äôt accept drinks from others.

AskReddit,ff8i423,t3_es1gaf,1579679512.0,"Teacher in HS had a practice that she didn‚Äôt see through and no one else had figured out how to exploit.  

The day before our finals, she would let us see the test for five minutes.  Could not take notes or anything, just see what was on it to help us know what to study.  Everyone in the class got A‚Äôs on both tests (midterm and final) and she couldn‚Äôt figure out why.  

After she told us how she previewed the tests the day before I organized the class.  Had thirty people.  First person memorized the first two questions.  Second person memorized the second and third.  Third the third and fourth.  Down to the last who memorized the last and the first.  Weren‚Äôt exactly same number of questions as people in class but close.  After the class we all met, compiled the test from everyone‚Äôs memory, using the overlap to double check what each question was.  We also had one guy in the class that had close to a photographic memory so was able to validate the whole thing and fix some spots where the two people on a given question couldn‚Äôt agree.  We then as a group worked the problems as a group and everyone had a copy of the test and an answer key to memorize.  

Teacher also allowed students to play tapes in a Walkman if they showed her the tape was a purchased prerecorded tape.  I showed people how to tape over the holes that made recorders think it was a writable tape.  Then they could record over a crappy three dollar bargain bin tape with whatever they want.  Say the answers to thirty chemistry final questions hypothetically.  So even those who had bad memories and didn‚Äôt understand the material were able to ace the test.  

Evidently took her two years before she realized what we had done and stop previewing her test.  And no one could listen to tapes during exams anymore."

The only scenario I can think of where this might come up is having a three ball frozen to the nine with the nine wired into a pocket.  Ball in hand on the one but no good way to get on the two.  No way to swing at the nine.  No way to play a lock up safe.  Then maybe in theory you might want to push out by making the nine so it gets spotted and out of harm‚Äôs way.  

Having said that, it would never really happen.  Maybe if I want to show off to someone and can set up a trick shot with the push out that I know my opponent will give me back to do something fun.  Would never do that in a real important game but maybe in practice with a friend."
