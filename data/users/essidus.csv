pcgaming,ffp43e0,t1_ffp2o4q,1580085738.0,"Right. I blame Epic for a lot of things, but the state of Borderlands 3 is entirely on Gearbox. The only thing they did ""wrong"" was taking Epic's deal, and I honestly cannot blame them for doing it. They didn't promise a Steam release before making the deal, which is more than a lot of studios can say."

pcgaming,ffoxay4,t1_ffossc6,1580082949.0,"Borderlands 3 has significantly divided the playerbase.

On Metacritic, player reviews are quite nearly split down the middle. Positive comments are mostly ""ignore the negative reviews"" and the usual 10 scores and 8 scores. The negative comments often point to bugs, poor optimization, that the writing is trying too hard, and that there is too much plot and not enough time playing the game. Even console gamers have the same issues, and generally games like Borderlands run more favorably on console than on PC.

I think the big answer is, Borderlands 3 is more Borderlands. Nothing's really substantially changed across the series. That's a neutral statement, because some people will be happy to hear it, while other people are bored with the formula and style."
