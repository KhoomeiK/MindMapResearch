atheism,ff5jwlj,t3_err5xg,1579596378.0,"Honestly, they almost never actually listen to their Bible and where they do, they do it selectively based on what their preacher or some TV evangelist tells them. 

As an ex-Catholic, ex-Christian I cannot begin to tell you how fucked up the leadership is. I have actually heard a pastor tell people not to read the Bible from cover to cover because, and here I quote, it will confuse them and cause them to question their faith.

That consistent line has come from may pastors I have known as they prefer to both spoon feed snipits of the Bible and provide their own interpretations. Or select a part of the Bible from one point then another from another point which together have absolutely no contextual association but are used to prop up what they want to guide their parishioners to believe. 

As an alter-boy as a hatchling I read that damn book cover to cover multiple times and would correct people constantly about their interpretations. One of my favorite pastimes in my early 20's was to have the Jehovah's witnesses show up at my door step so I could debate their Bible interpretations and show them where they were taking things out of context. It got to the point that they brought the head of their Church to my door and we went round and round for 2 hours to the point he said he had to go and think about what I have said because he had no response... Because they were valid points. 

(Don't ask about the whole conversation because honestly that shit was a long time ago)

These people don't want what the Bible says, they want to be told what to do. They don't want to think, it is too hard to figure it all out... The vote what they are told because understanding the issues and the problems and devising a solution is beyond them. They just want a strong personality figure to do it for them, what ever IT is. They fall back to their parents, their priest, their representative and their president. And if any of them disagree, they are filled with demons."

LosAngeles,ff4rib5,t1_ff4on46,1579570695.0,"It is actually, the company provides the trainees a list of homes that are tagged as unoccupied, have missed payments, are in various stages of foreclosure, etc, etc. Then they expect the trainee to send letters, visit the home owners often as a way get an idea of the condition of the home, etc... Then they go into hard sell (buy) techniques if the home is viable with cosmetic fixes.

Honestly it is kind of an uncomfortable thing to watch. They target homeowners in vulnerable situations and try to make them think that the only way out of their predicament is to sell, take their equity, or a portion of it, and run. While they sweep in fix up the home with the least they can and turn it around and sell it to some other  buyer. 

In reality most of these people who sell could do the same thing by taking an equity loan and doing the same thing but just don't understand how to do it."
LosAngeles,ff4lw6l,t3_ermd20,1579566775.0,"Almost always not worth your time...

Typically this is a company that offers to train you how to flip houses for a fee. They have classes and teach you how to do it, yes, but then they walk you through steps in finding a home, convincing people in trouble to save their equity by agreeing to sell the home for a reduced rate, have you do all the leg work then offer you the funding to help buy the home to flip for a percentage... Sounds great until you are deep into doing all of the work and giving away most of the profit. 

What most people realize once they are deep into this is that the company who trains you is actually just using you to do the most difficult portion of the work, finding the properties to flip. It is kind of a pyramid scheme where you make money based on how much work you put in. But to do it all, pay to learn, find the homes with the right cost to value potential (the difficult part), convince the owner it is better to sell than solve the problem themselves, seal the deal with the home owner to sell to you, have the funding to buy the home from the owner, fix it up, find a buyer, have the real estate license to sell the home and finally close the deal. 

Most of these schemes offer to fill in the gaps you don't have to flip the home... And take a majority of the profit... Until you can do it all on your own. But the amount of work on the up front find and buy and fix is the huge hurdle that takes a lot of leg work... And that is what they use you for. It is not a paid job, it is an ""if you find it, we will give you a few dollars.""

I know a few people who have been doing this for years, investing a lot of their own time and money and still haven't showed a positive return. Yea they have sold a few homes, but after you subtract the costs and the percentage they have to give back the end result is a loss. 

Just my experience with these types of deals."

gaming,fesvj00,t1_fernwg4,1579369443.0,"Ahh... Yes, good ole Google translate. Explains it all.

People talk about how tools like auto translate will change languages but don't get that there is a whole cultural world of slang, innuendo, subtext and idiom that any language carries. 

For instance I could say:
You are watching a stump waiting on a rabbit..or just that you are waiting on a rabbit...(守株待兔 Shǒu zhū dài tù.)

And of course you wouldn't know what the hell I was talking about... But anyone from China would. 

This idiom refers to a famous story about a peasant who happened to see a rabbit run head-first into a tree stump and die. From then on, the peasant expected to find other rabbits making the same deadly mistake, and so he continued to wait idly by the tree stump instead of going out and hunting, or making other efforts to feed himself.

The idiom is used to describe someone who waits in vain for luck or opportunity to befall him or her, rather than striving to make an effort or take the initiative.

Foodforthought,fdm5pp9,t3_em2b63,1578540434.0,"Where I disagree with this line is simple... 

Let's compare the author's capitalism to automobiles. Socialism would say that since the speed limit is at most 75mph no cars can be constructed that can go faster than 75mph. Capitalism says we can build cars to go as fast as they can go. So as a result people under capitalism drive like maniacs and kill people. So capitalism cars are bad and people who drive them are bad. 

This is the wrong lesson because it fails to point out that there are speed limits that, when violated beyond the flow of traffic can result in serious fines and even loss of driving privilege.

It is in this distinction that the capitalist world has failed. It is not that capitalism is bad it is that bad actors have not been regulated. For years the far right has strived to remove the speed limits and penalties for capitalism. The results of this are that those willing profit off the weak and vulnerable profit faster than those with morals... And given the rules of capitalism this means that those companies and those people become the strongest and most profitable. They are then allowed to consume their competition. In fact unfettered capitalism rewards the most viscous of these corporations. 

Now socialism has the same problem, only instead of corporations being the great evil, government takes on that role. Politicians profit off the people, one of the reasons people like Putin are some of the richest in the world.

Systems of government and systems of business need to have rules and regulations that define right and wrong. They need systems of checks and balances that say, ""Hey you cannot sacrifice safety for profitability! People come first before profit."" They need both safety nets and stop signs that when violated take away more than the profit that the violation of the rules gave them. Today those rules do not exist. But they should. 

The problem with socialism is that those making the laws are those who stand to profit. The problem with the current incarnation of capitalism is that those who stand to profit are stuffing money into the pockets of those making the laws. 

The solution to the problem of capitalism is to separate the money from the politicians... There is no solution for socialism. 

Whether this can ever happen at this point is to be seen, but some people are trying.

The solution to the problem becomes a blend... Some things should never be motivated by profit, education, healthcare, public utilities... These things should be human rights. You shouldn't be able to say, ""if you want to live, pay me as much as the market can bare."" There should be rules to say you can profit to a point and after that the better good is to provide for betterment of the people. 

Capitalism tries to do this but in many cases the far right has crippled the stop signs or made the fines so inconsequential that driving through them is less painful than a speed bump. 

Is the system broken, yes... But fixing it would not be that complicated.
