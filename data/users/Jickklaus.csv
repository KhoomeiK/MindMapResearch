LegalAdviceUK,fdd53wg,t3_ekmd3w,1578295189.0,"Although from a legal standpoint, you're perfectly covered...
... Just have a think on the personal side of things here.

Someone has invested an amount of their personal money to get this company started. They've picked their top team, you're in it.

This is the team they want to help guide, steer, and move their business forward. The first few years are gonna be tough and scary. There's going to be longer hours than probably anticipated, it's really high risk of failing and that initial investment lost.

And one of the top 5 says they're planning several months off for a baby.

Now, I know it's perfectly in your rights, I'm not saying you can't or shouldn't... But I think any small business owner would panic at that. Especially from one of the senior team.

Can they effectively plan 12 months ahead when someone in your role won't be there? As whilst you're off, someone needs to cover you.  Are there just the 5 of you, or will they need to find someone to cover your role?  Or does it mean sharing it out between the 4 remaining shareholders. 
In a new, and small business, that might be pretty hard to do. And very hard to predict especially before the company has got off the ground.

It's a lot of uncertainty, and it's made him nervous. 
The chap is probably freaking out over the security of his investment."
history,fdcaiwe,t1_fdc8gvm,1578270370.0,"Romans did use spears, but their troops carried shields. So their spearmen, including the triarii, had, well, spears.

A medival polearm... Say a halberd or a pike, would not function in a shield wall. They're big, heavy, two handed things.
Couldn't use them in a shield wall. You'd have half your troops not carrying shields! And that meant if someone with a shield fell, you'd struggle to fill that gap with any speed.

So I think the style of polearm changed."

history,fdc8klo,t3_ekhhoj,1578269215.0,"Honestly, I think the actual answer isn't all that clear cut. 

It would have changed for a variety of reasons... 


Armour:

By the time medival period came round armour was becoming more sophisticated. Like, really really good.

If you had a set of proper plate armour, it could deflect arrows coming in. The different layers of your armour would stop swords.

Who needs a shield wall to stop arrows when you're wearing something that stops arrows?! Hell, they'd have stopped using shields. 


Army size/Training:

Yes, the medival period had wars with huge armies... But very few places had large standing armies.  Ancient warfare, Romans for example, had large standing armies who drilled regularly and had all the right kit.  It was a career. 

Medival times, if you needed an army, you had some trained men, sure. You had mercenaries. But a lot of your troops were just called up from your lands. They didn't have a lot of training, they didn't have matching kit, and they probably weren't going to live long in the fight.

So your wealthy/standing army part would have been mounted, or well armoured. The rest were peasants who could fire a bow, and were given a weapon and some cheap armour.


Cavalry:

Cavalry was heavier in medival times. And could tank through a poorly held together shield wall. And poorly trained troops are more likely to break.


Archery:

Was always prevalent. Yes English longbows would go through a shield, if close enough. Crossbows would have been more of an issue, I think. I believe they had more punch.


Weapons:

Pikemen were common, too. It's a good weapon for unskilled troops. They can't carry shields, and they're probably pretty effective against a shield wall, as they have additional reach.




Sooo... I think it's a lot of things. Shield walls are still used today. Look at riot police!  The tactic still works, just got to apply it right for the environment."
LegalAdviceUK,fdc6549,t1_fdc1c98,1578267860.0,"Well, that's a lesson learned. House sitting always felt like a weird thing to want to do, to me, especially with a strangers place.

I'd recommend:
- print screen all conversations you had with these people, both via text and through the house sitting website, etc

- contact house sitting website, and let them know the whole story. Be honest about your mistakes, but also the presence of the cameras - those guys did break the T&Cs. Also get your account shut down (hence why print screens are important) 

- replace the stuff, if you haven't already


- don't pay for the dog sitter. They were trying to use a free service, it backfired, it's not on you to have to pay up.


- if they keep contacting, ask them not to anymore. They're angry, and trying to scare you.  Just try to ignore.


- if needed, contact 101. The threat of posting online could constitute blackmail attempt. The constant messaging could constitute harrasmsbet. 
Though the video not show anything illicit, from what you've said, won't do much online. 


- You had permission to be in the house, and left when the permission was rescinded, so no one could knobble you there.

- broken the invite people over rule
- done a sneaky and used their printer - they didn't know you were going to pay them back, and printers are expensive
- stood on a beanbag, which lead to it splitting?


If you'd invited someone over near the end of your stay, things might have been different, if you'd built up trust, there might have been leeway. You didn't.


I think the asking you to pay the dog fees is going too far, but I think it's a response from them based on anger.  Which, to be honest, is a valid emotion from them.  I don't think you should be paying it. I don't think they can make you pay it.
