Then the guy proceeded to tell us about job review websites that had bad reviews on them that we should ignore. Yeah, all the alarm bells went off when I heard that.

It's still a really funny show, but when bad things happen it's more of an 'Oh fuck, I can't believe that just happened' than a 'Let's see how will they get out of this wacky situation' feeling."

AskReddit,fd3qsj9,t1_fd3l0lo,1578160910.0,"None of this is even remotely true. There are attractive and unattractive people of both genders, and no, not all attractive women are subject to this kind of attention ""all the time"" and nor are unattractive men expected to ""give out this kind of attention."" The problem is made worse BY isolating men and women from each other. When you don't interact with people that aren't like you, you tend to make up your own ideas about them, and that's where a lot of these problems stem from historically. Men and women have been sequestered to their own areas in life for most of history, and even today, interaction between women and men is rarely considered to be able to be strictly platonic outside of the workplace if they're of similar age. Keeping ""men separate from women"" all the time wouldn't make it safer for anyone. That's how you get places like much of the middle east, where women and men ARE kept separate all the time, unless related or married. In what way do you think that kind of separatist scenario ended up safer for women?"

WhitePeopleTwitter,fckw18i,t1_fckos6h,1577734414.0,"Let me make something clear here. I absolutely do not hate men. I'm a 90's metalhead, a gamer, and a subcontractor, all of my friends and coworkers are men of various races, and my best friend and SO is a white man. I'm not one of those people that lump all white dudes together and assume the worst shit about them, and while I'm center-left, I'm not PC by a long shot. I'm pointing out that you as a 22 year old living in the Midwest are (probably) not making billions of dollars of income. Billions of dollars that other people do make, that is not taxed properly to scale. If these people were taxed properly, that could contribute to these programs. Not you. Also, where the hell are you getting the idea that everyone would just get liberal arts degrees? You do realize a lot of people don't actually know what they want to do in life straight out of high school, right? Maybe if college was free, these kids can go in, look around, find a major and a career that they are actually interested in, instead of being shoehorned into a particular path straight away since that shit is expensive and you don't have the fucking time or resources to see what you might actually want to do in life. The cost of the education to become something like a doctor or engineer at a good school is extremely daunting to most people, and I am absolutely sure many more people would pursue those kinds of career paths without that kind of cost barrier that can only be achieved if you already have money, or are willing to place yourself in a financial hole for the rest of your life. And even if Ashley goes and gets her useless underwater basket weaving degree, so what? Maybe while she's there she figures out that it's not going to be what she really wants to do, and has the financial ability to switch to something else. Maybe she doesn't. To me, it doesn't matter, because for every Ashley out there, there's a kid in poverty that is really into space, or computers, or forensics, or something really cool and interesting, but can't afford to go in the first fucking place.

I'm not trying to be confrontational either, but I get really irritated when I see you kids pointing out the people who you think would ""just take advantage of"" these programs, while forgetting that you're also shooting down the people that *wouldn't be.*

Happy New Year. Enjoy that college education."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fckldyc,t1_fckg39b,1577727860.0,"It would be a totally negligible cost if we stopped pumping excessive amounts into defense and diverted some of that money to things like college or healthcare. There are plenty of ways to have these programs without the cost being on the taxpayers, and even if they were, and taxes were appropriately scaled to income *like they already should fucking be*, then no, Mr. 22 year old from North Dakota, you probably would not be paying very much extra at all so someone else could go to college.


Edit: Hold the fuck up. I missed that last part where you said free college would be ""arguably little social benefit."" Are you mental? In what world do you think having MORE access to education would be such a minor improvement on society overall? Because it certainly isn't one that I live in."
