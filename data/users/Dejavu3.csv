WTFwish,ffhg7ix,t3_etdndk,1579933891.0,This is a prop specifically for magicians. These have existed for quite some time and are not new to wish.
pics,ffhfqby,t1_ffh9u8h,1579933335.0,Just like our impeached president.
pics,ffhfp2l,t1_ffguo34,1579933294.0,Politics is a hobby for a lot of people. For others it's a career. Maybe come up with a better insult.
gamegrumps,ffhfjtp,t3_etj6rp,1579933127.0,Something about the style of this reminds me of road to El Dorado.
13or30,fferzre,t1_ffdwmu9,1579862678.0,"As someone with naturally very full eyebrows, no please. Sure dial it back to a more natural look but the alternative is those shitty pencil thin eyebrows and everyone constantly telling me I should pluck mine unprompted."
TwoXChromosomes,ffegnds,t3_et1e9b,1579847262.0,"The concept of virginity was created as a way to quantify the value of a woman when they were no more than livestock. Just remove the weirdly creepy concept from your life entirely and you'll be better off for it.

But to answer your actual question, no it's not deceitful. And anyone who would contest you on that is not worth keeping around if they don't get it."
funny,ffeg4du,t3_et0lng,1579846690.0,"It's on him, not her, to ensure his relationship is honored. 'Home wrecker' is an inheretly misogynistic term by placing responsibilities of men onto women, he is the home wrecker not her.

Was it shitty of her to go through with it anyway? Well of course. But using the term home wrecker and only getting mad at her is ridiculous."
shittyaquariums,ffc2t05,t3_esnfxh,1579790126.0,That's either satire or a bought review. Sorry this is just too perfectly wrong.
nottheonion,ffc23di,t1_ffat3yr,1579789601.0,"Dreads aren't just a stylistic choice a lot of times for people born with this hair type. They are necessary to maintain it and keep it from becoming damaged. Not all hair can be treated the same, and *that's why these policies are racist.*"
awfuleverything,ffc1crl,t1_ffa2wnz,1579789047.0,I've heard fingertip tattoos last a few months max. Makes complete sense from everything else I know to be fact about tattoos so hopefully that makes you fell better about it.
shittyaquariums,ffbns8d,t3_esnp9h,1579774680.0,The level of filth in that 'tank' is more than five days worth.
TwoXChromosomes,ff5zepq,t1_ff5uwij,1579615091.0,"It's a sterotype that women are bad drivers. It's sexist and incredibly rude, but in the past jokes like that would get approval from other people involved."
stevenuniverse,ff5pllb,t1_ff4yr8a,1579604908.0,"Her arch is shown in reverse. She's no worse than any of the other morally gray characters in the show. (And there's quite a few of them).

No need to be so hateful."
MEOW_IRL,ff5ow9n,t1_ff591v4,1579603889.0,I never claimed to be smarter than everyone and I never said I was too smart for this conversation. That was you. Guess you're not too smart after all though.
shittyaquariums,ff5nhg1,t3_errqtx,1579601766.0,People treat fish as if they're nothing more than an aesthetic and it's sickening
funny,ff4vn14,t1_ff4kurh,1579573529.0,Fish at fairs are not perfectly healthy. They are near death at all times.
NoStupidQuestions,ff4n85q,t1_ff3hj5s,1579567714.0,Cat scratches are itchy generally
aww,ff2jotg,t1_ff2ab3u,1579509204.0,"Just because it's the same motion doesn't mean it's the same intent. Dogs are much more intelligent than people give them credit for, and dogs are widely known for their ability to mimic human behavior for the humans sake, not theirs. This isn't the dog getting confused, he really is trying his best to imitate."
MEOW_IRL,ff1ze5w,t1_ff1yr6s,1579489741.0,"You still going? Big brain just can't let you walk away from an opportunity to prove you're smarter than someone ya? You can think I'm mad if that helps your delusion, I've no problem with that."
Anticonsumption,ff1w10d,t1_ff1qagv,1579487453.0,"Yes, you're correct. This specific forum is not only for that. This sub is also for being against mass consumption, which means you make your own shit."
Anticonsumption,ff1h5xe,t1_ff1b5v0,1579479153.0,"Of course you consume materials. Anti consumption doesn't only mean don't even own anything, just find better ways than supporting mass consumption of corporate goods."
MEOW_IRL,ff0viv8,t1_fezasjp,1579472705.0,"I was not trying to make a point, that would be like trying to speak to a wall. No, I was just fuckin with ya so thanks for being such a good sport."
Anticonsumption,ff0v5td,t1_fez1ctw,1579472585.0,I didn't say it wouldn't. This sub is anti consumption which means make your own shit. Don't consume
Anticonsumption,feyolpb,t1_feyo8uy,1579448367.0,"You can make them, or have them commissioned by a 3d artist."
gamegrumps,fexs2jc,t1_fevu7vz,1579435254.0,"Unless the dog was given up by their owner, most are just strays that are given a random name by the shelter anyway. Doesn't matter if you change it because it's not like the dog knew they were really called that while in dog jail. You have to train a dog to know it's name, and shelters don't train."
