Wall sits are a sport exercise, to it is exercising/sport. These children, very young, associated sport with suffering so they are very likely to be more than discouraged to do any sport. That's the best way to cause problems to your children because we all know how important is exercising.

It can fall whenever it wants. I get tired very easily now, much more than years ago, and I can't do sport as much as I used to because my belly hurts when I run only a few meters. I needed to do another session for my exam because of it...that's not the worst, I still got it with very good marks, but I fear it happens when I really don't want to.
