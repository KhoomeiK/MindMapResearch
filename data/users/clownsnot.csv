I understand this all too well. I’m glad you were comfortable enough to share some of your home life with us because even on the internet, it can be hard to open up. Have you considered looking into going no contact when you can? Also, if you need to vent some more I am also all ears!

depression,feijl0m,t3_ep4bw6,1579140022.0,"I don’t think I’ve ever resonated so well with a post in my life. 

This is exactly what I’m going through right now. There isn’t a passing day where I don’t think that my movie should’ve already ended, but there was an unexpected turn of events and suddenly I’m being forced into improvisational work I never signed up for. I’m a lost actress in my own movie and it sucks."
depression,fegm5pl,t1_fefva56,1579096980.0,"To be fair, I think it depends on the person. While it may not work on some, it could definitely help others. I am glad you were able to become happier."
depression,fefk5h1,t1_fefjr0f,1579058036.0,"Thank you for the suggestion. I’ll have to try that out sometime because honestly, it does sound kind of peaceful. Being able to have a place to escape from reality for a little while. As of right now, I escape using stories and character developing. I take what I experience and put it into characters as an outlet, but I think having a physical location where I allow myself to unwind could be beneficial. Again, thank you"
depression,fefgrei,t1_feffjuf,1579055988.0,"I think some people may see it as that. They think it would be somehow helpful, but it rarely ever is. It comes from a place of ignorance and laziness. Instead of communicating and asking would could help you out, or even looking up how to approach something like that, they take the ‘easy’ way out and end up hurting a depressed friend/relative/stranger etc. etc."
depression,fefg3r9,t1_fefdv2p,1579055594.0,"It’s only invalidating to our own experience and does little to make us feel better. Hell, I’m sure if we started telling our parents that there were more unfortunate people out there while they were in the midst of ranting about something like annoying employees (or maybe even something larger), they wouldn’t be too happy?

I hope everything goes smoothly and your mother begins to recognize some of the things she’s been saying isn’t exactly helpful to you!"
depression,fefc4qk,t1_fef95cy,1579053091.0,If only I had the balls to make him acknowledge the fact that even owning a car might be a luxury to some-
depression,fefbyew,t1_fef8g4h,1579052974.0,"“Sky God”. I chuckled because he is religious and has tried to “fix” me with self help books that talk about “finding God” and how it cured their depression.  

Honestly, I think that’s the point— he tries to hurt my feelings. When he gets mad he hits you where it hurts most to get a reaction, no matter if you’re his family member or not. I’ve watched it happen to many and it’s happened to me plenty of times. Part of me feels dumb for ever exposing those vulnerable spots."
depression,fefb9tm,t1_fef692s,1579052525.0,"If only I had a place to go to decompress like that. Unfortunately, my bedroom is the only place I can go to, and even then it isn’t safe because privacy doesn’t exist and they’ll walk in with no warning. It’s infuriating. 

Honestly, I resonate with that statement. There are parts of me that do want to get better but at the same time it’s like, “what’s the point?” and I would let myself perish with ease."
depression,feesysb,t1_feeob5h,1579040545.0,"Oh Gee- 
Being open about my feelings is something I’ve been trying to work on. Thank you for that"
depression,feesjfe,t1_feeqvtx,1579040286.0,"Thank you again. Even though I don’t know you, it means a lot to know that someone is proud and believes in me."
depression,fees49u,t1_feerrl6,1579040031.0,I genuinely have absolutely no clue. He could’ve been lying about the depression part— he has a history of lying— but I don’t want to believe that he was.
depression,feerlci,t1_feemf7l,1579039711.0,"What’s mind boggling to me is my father has depression also, as well as CPSTD. That’s partially the reason I felt I could confide in him— because I thought it was something he would be able to sympathize with and offer support. Ignorant on my behalf seeing as he’s called me all those things, but still. 

Apparently it was something he had gathered during therapy. I don’t know if he misconstrued what she was saying, put words in her mouth, or maybe she really did say that? But I just.. even hearing it, I couldn’t imagine it was true. I agree with you; the richest people in the world can have depression, and it doesn’t matter if they’re grateful for their fortunes or not. It hurt regardless because of what he was implying, though. 

I’ll look into that— gratitude journaling."
depression,feeqnf2,t1_feen359,1579039153.0,"Thank you for your kind words, and even giving my post the time of day. I’ll definitely keep what you’ve said in mind and try to commit it to memory. I really, really do want to get better; the process of doing so is what scares me. Like you said, there isn’t an easy solution- but I worry I don’t have the energy or right motivation to work for a better future. 

Nonetheless, I’ll try my best to not give up on myself and I sure do hope I’m not destined to be living in the back of my car like my father."
depression,feepo1h,t1_feen0u7,1579038588.0,"Thankfully, it is a lot easier to distance myself from him as I live with my mother (I’m 17) so he isn’t my primary caregiver. On the flip side, my mother makes my problems about her so she isn’t the best either. 

As much as it pains me to even consider this, I think I might try to go no contact once I can move. It won’t be the cure to my problems I’m sure but it’ll help regardless, and I’ll then be able to work on myself without fear of disturbing some of the peace. My father is a tricky individual. He’s far more affectionate and supportive of my aspirations but he’s also the worst when it comes to my mental health. I don’t know. It’s definitely a rollercoaster."
