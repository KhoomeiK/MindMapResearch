I used to always read tabs, but I think working the song out by yourself is more rewarding."

depression,ff1h3ay,t3_er4qix,1579479120.0,"Tough to say really, pretty subjective choice on whether to change, It sounds like your change in lifestyle (grad programme, away from fam etc) might be making things generally worse, dimming the benefit of meds. Though on the other hand, it’s always worth getting professional advice. Hope this helps, I’ve been on fluoxetine for 6 years and I’ve had a few dips."

depression,fcvuxyf,t3_ej6q3o,1578010677.0,"‘Help’ can mean anything, but it is completely relevant to your situation. I found that help came through a mix of talking to family, medication and therapy. Though it doesn’t have to be through all those. I wish you all the luck, it’s good that you’re trying to find out what to do next."
