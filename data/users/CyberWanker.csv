As I’ve said multiple fucking times. What she accomplished is still a feat and is no less impressive than if she did regular. I’m just stating that in my experience sumo is easier and requires less effort due to the movement itself. That’s all I’m saying ffs."
BeAmazed,ff7pu0c,t1_ff7pc35,1579655427.0,I guess because that’s how I was taught. I go to a gym run by ex army guys. Most served in both the Soviet and American military. Also I live and am from an ex communist country so maybe there’s that.
BeAmazed,ff7p67b,t1_ff7p2kp,1579654959.0,Start with just a stick. No weight. Watch videos and get someone to check you. Get them to stop you whenever you bend your back or you stop when you feel strain in your lower back.

BeAmazed,ff7o13z,t1_ff7n870,1579654156.0,"Because its not the original exercise? There isn’t a world record for knee push ups are there? The correct deadlift is regular. It’s also not putting other down. It’s just pointing out the technical aspects of the exercise and how in a competitive environment it wouldn’t be counted. 

Of course it’s awesome she lifted that amount. It’s obvious she’s enjoying herself. But just because we talk about the technique used and ect don’t assume we’re being negative. As someone who does powerlifting a lot of the people I know talk about technique all the time, constantly trying to better ourselves. You have to be critical because when lifting heavy weights it can be dangerous. It’s just there sport and the culture, and I’d say 98% of the time the criticism/talk of technique comes from a good place and members of the community know it does."
BeAmazed,ff7npbr,t1_ff7n6cv,1579653925.0,"I kinda have to agree with the guy. Sumo makes the whole action a lot easier and less difficult as you’re not having to go down from a full squat (bum lower than knees) and end standing straight up. It’s definitely a lot easier to lift sumo. Regardless of that though, awesome job to her. She looks like she had a good time and is doing a lot better than a lot of other people."
BeAmazed,ff7ng71,t1_ff7grnr,1579653747.0,Sumo is easier right? I can’t remember. I don’t like doing sumos because they make my knees hurt.

AskReddit,ff529d1,t1_ff451ub,1579578264.0,"I used to have night terrors when I was a kid. Ended up getting ptsd because of them, still get them every once in a while now. Thanks depression. 

When I was younger I’d wake up screaming or crying and my parents were always there. They’d hear me getting agitated and come in and slowly/gently wake me up by saying my name. I’d always follow their voice and I’d be safe.

I learned how to do this because my dad told me that when I was having a bad dream I need to go to the white door in the white fence. Like a door, surrounded by a white fence. He said open the gate and walk to the door and when you open it we’ll be there. 

So while I was a kid id have night terrors I’d always look for the white door. I’d always find it, following their voice and I’d open the door and boom, I’d wake up and they be there. Either my mum or dad. 

So here I am, an adult and whenever I have night terrors I look for the white door. I always find it and I always wake myself up. My parents might not be there, but I always feel safe and happy when I wake up. I then promptly pass out again into dreamless sleep."

You say everybody knows white lives matter and ect. I hate the fact we even have to have a separate black lives matter.

There we go ladies and gentlemen. Another nazi sympathizer. 

Don’t think I don’t hear what you’re saying. Yes I also believe we should love people, but Nazis are not people. They are Nazis. They are not human in a any shape or form. There’s forgiving someone for stealing money, or hurting someone and then there’s forgiving a literal fucking genocide and mass murder of women and children. One of those things is not like the other. If you think Nazis are good, Nazis as in the definition I stated above, then you’re fucking nuts dude and should probably keep that to yourself before someone knocks your teeth out. Not a threat but you say that to someone irl, the wrong person, they won’t give you the time to explain love and hatred and all this other bs you’re spewing. That’s the reality of the world."

Quick question. Are Nazis evil?"
pics,fdg8ilw,t1_fdg1xdg,1578384541.0,"Firstly, when your enemy has literally been building factories for killing human beings I think fighting out of hatred is justifiable. If the Nazis had won they would have killed hundreds of millions and purge countless innocent lives. What the Nazis did and wanted to accomplish was completely and utterly unforgivable. They committed genocide against children, women and individuals who had no choice in the way they were born. 

No it’s not a mistake to turn our back. It’s what we should be doing to make it categorically clear that it is not acceptable or tolerated in any shape or form. Regardless of whether they are conditioned or not, I’m sure if some political figure started telling you killing a specific race or ethnicity was ok you’d think and be able to realize yourself that is not the case. This post is not conditioning people. There was no merit or evidence to the accusations against Jews. It was a mad minds rambling. However every accusation against the Nazis is true. We literally fought a war dude. Another thing, the Jews never actively wanted to commit mass genocide against any other race/ethnicity or ect. Nazis did.

My response never mentioned anything about the Jews or gestapo? Not sure if you’re trying to make a comparison but it makes no sense. Me saying I’d kick a nazis teeth in is nothing compared to what the Nazis would do if they caught a Jew. Not sure if you know of some of the atrocities the Nazis committed but here’s one for ya. When Jews entered concentration camps, they had two separate lines. One for men and one for women. If you were deemed to weak, young, old or sick you would be separated from the group and put into another line. This line led to a pit in the ground. The pit was on fire, you’d reach the edge and see the countless burning bodies of those before you and then you’d be pushed in and burned alive. All because you believed in a different god. You were innocent.

I never said you were a nazi. But it’s quite worrisome that a) you think you are one and b) I stand by what I said. Nazis deserve no protection, they are a parasite to the human race. They are not like Jews, they are not innocent, they would it they could cull the planet of anyone of any color or background that is not white. And before you ask the dumb fucking question of what a nazi is again. It’s very fucking clear, use a dictionary or just in case you’re too fucking lazy to do so, here’s the definition 

a person with extreme racist or authoritarian views.

And 

a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party.

So basically a nazi, is someone who believes in what the original Nazi party believed in. And is also someone who is incredibly racist and has extreme authoritarian views. Wishing to forcible remove non whites from any country is racist. Believing all non whites are lesser humans is racist. It’s not difficult, if you are not extremely racist or believe in authoritarianism then you shouldn’t have to fear about being called a nazi. It’s worrisome that you can’t differentiate yourself from that though."

The only thing that helps me is tv shows. But I have to work and work depresses me because I’m so overly critical of myself that I hate going and working even though it’s a job I always wanted to do. I always feel like I’m shit or not worthy.

I’m running out of things to distract myself with. I wish I could go back to high school and fix my grades and shit, fix the relationship with my ex and feel happy and comfortable again.
