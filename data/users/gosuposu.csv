I lean heavily NTA here because it's not really their business what you name your kid, BUT I have a feeling that the name may be a little more obscure than something like Dimitri. The only reason I think it matters is IF your  friends / family are reacting so negatively to the name, that it may be indicative of how people in your community may react to your kid's name, and that it could open your kid up to bullying. That is my only concern with your kid's name, and I don't think it's a concern with a name like Dimitri, but if it's something more obscure, well. People suck. It's a reality, and I would probably err on the side of caution for naming my kid to reduce the probability of him being a target for something as easy to target as a name.

makes sense because even if the advice is absolutely correct, it does not help OP in any way right now, and there are better subs for it. I think that's what u/thesongofstorms here is getting at here.

Either she needs to let you wear pants or whatever and be in your wedding, or accept that you won't be part of her wedding. Or, if you want to go to her wedding, just don't be a bridesmaid so you can wear what you want? Because the only other option I can think of is for you to wear a dress, which you clearly don't want to do."
