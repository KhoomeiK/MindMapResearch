news,fdnsjvo,t3_embf2x,1578591971.0,"I knew when I read the judge's outburst the defence team would try to get the judge removed. A shitty but brilliant tactic considering they will probably use this incident as grounds for appeal when Weinstein loses. The lawyers will be making bank off this case for ages.

Quote from the judge below.


“Is this really the way you want to end up in jail for the rest of your life by texting in violation of an order?” a clearly exacerbated Burke barked at Weinstein on January 7 in front of the defense team, prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney and others."

gamedesign,fc7mbkn,t3_eghc8r,1577512134.0,"Prison Architect is a really successful sandbox game. There are two factors I think that keep my play sessions long (1070 hours? WTF?). Anyway, the first factor is I'm always trying to optimise my layout to improve flow. So I'm constantly rebuilding sections of my prison. Secondly, each day there are more prisoners arriving every day so I have to keep expanding.

In your game, once you have built the basic structures, is there any reason to ever go back and optimise or expand them?"
joinsquad,fc3gyf4,t3_efz1d0,1577389569.0,"Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + ESC) and change to performance tab. Is anything CPU/MEM/GPU etc hitting 100%? Change to processes tab. What's chewing up your memory? If you can close that software then do so. Make sure the drive you are running the game on has a dedicated page file. 

For the purposes of troubleshooting, close all browser tabs and other software. Temporarily pause Antivirus/Malware Antibytes software.  In-game, set graphics to low to see if you still get stuttering.  Make sure there is 10% free space on system drv and drv the game runs on. 

In Steam, disable the Steam overlay to see if that makes a difference. Disable OBS if it is running. Disable Gamebar in Windows Control Panel if that is enabled. 

Update your graphics video drivers. Make sure they the drv is current by checking the drv date stamp on your video csrd in Windows system properties. 

I've found Squad performance can be adversely affected by both SQUAD and Windows updates. 

These are some basic troubleshooting tips. A new drive and extra RAM will help but working out if windows is slowing you down also has benefits."
