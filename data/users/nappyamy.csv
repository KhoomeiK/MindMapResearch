AskReddit,ffbhrbj,t1_ffaum6p,1579765870.0,what job did you move on to?
Blackbear,ff8oh4h,t1_ff718cj,1579688914.0,i notice he does wear a lot of platform type shoes that give him some height.
Cheerleading,fejcsy8,t1_fejcrgq,1579167615.0,"oh i forgot to add, since you mentioned flying... flexibility!! you may have lost some since you took a break? but that’s an easy skill to work on solo and at home so starting there would be great!"
Cheerleading,fejcrgq,t3_epdvsn,1579167555.0,"it’s hard to get tumbling back without privates so my only suggestion would be open gyms? 
Any athlete friends you still have from cheer may be helpful, and be able to help you get back into stunting.
have you considered a 6.0 team ? i’m not sure if 5.0 is popular where you live but where I am it usually goes open 4.0 or 4.2, 5, straight to 6.0.
Now that they changed their levels (i’m sure you’re aware, since they added level 7), you should be able to manage a 6.0 team depending?? just my opinion though, best of luck and i wish you the best! keep us updated :) id love to know how your journey reentering cheer goes."
Cheerleading,fdq5ld4,t3_ehxsyq,1578655868.0,"definitely try out! depending on how lenient the program is, they may let you wear another brand of all white shoe that does carry your size. They’d have to understand your situation. Be careful not to get any with a tall sole; ive known quite a few cheerleaders buy non “cheer” branded white shoes and been fine on the floor."
YouShouldKnow,fdmsgek,t1_fdm1nrv,1578563527.0,"i understand why people might find your comment offensive, but i grew up having a close to phobia level fear of “going to hell”. The idea that i would be tortured for the rest of eternity was hard to swallow i guess.
So i can see where the mentality lies even though i don’t entirely agree with your comment."
YouShouldKnow,fdms8fw,t1_fdm56sr,1578563211.0,"i can confirm when i was younger i was scared of dogs because my aunt had this particularly scary ankle biter that would chase me/ actually ended up biting me once.
to this day i have a hard time warming up to dogs, and throughout my time growing up always had a fear of them. i feel as though i was more afraid because the family never did anything about it, my guardian ignored it and so i was raised to believe some dogs acted like that normally / it wasn’t looked upon as a bad thing."
YouShouldKnow,fdms24x,t3_elyibx,1578562963.0,this (i am hoping) discludes anything in incognito mode?

AskReddit,fdgdv6z,t1_fdgdbom,1578392106.0,i’m watching the one where michael finds out stanley is having an affair and then makes up rumours about everyone else to cover it up... ending with Pam’s pregnancy being revealed.
loot_crate,fcz5t9y,t1_fcz564r,1578094256.0,is it possible to remove your card info from the loot crate company site or whatever?
Criminology,fa9olvi,t3_e68iqm,1575883532.0,"law 12 is definitely a helpful course, psychology as well. i had a lot of overlap in those courses with some of the material in my first year"
