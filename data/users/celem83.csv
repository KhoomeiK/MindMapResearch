Let's say you go back 1 week.  You do your thing for 7 days, winning lotteries or whatever.  You then reach the day you travelled from originally.

Do you go back in time again?  You already got rich right?  If you decide not to, well, then you never did the first time either and never got rich, maybe it all goes poof, maybe your memories of that trip vanish since it never went down.

On the flip-side you might be smart, you might see the above paradox and dutifully travel back again.  Congrats, you are rich but eternally trapped in this week if you want the changes you made to hold.

explainlikeimfive,fe7jfa2,t3_eo2oyn,1578915390.0,"The key is  'prevailing winds', which direction the air tends to come from. In the case of Cardiff it's the returning maritime airstream. (Not Gulf Stream, that's an ocean current, not a wind)  This comes in off the Atlantic heavily saturated with moisture.

As the air hits the land it starts to climb, Wales is rather hilly, so it ends up being forced to climb hills very shortly after landfall.

As air rises it's temperature drops and with it the amount of moisture the air can physically hold.  The excess drops as rain.

This is rather common in temperate countries.  If the air comes off the sea and climbs, it rains.  (Tropical zones may behave differently, warmer air holds a lot more moisture, its an.exponential curve)

Edit: not to be confused with anabatic winds, which climb hills where the ground is warmer than the air, though this may in turn lead to precipitation as it can power the above effect.

Beyond that lies the question of spin.  Relatively few such outlets are non-partisan and they will definitely have interests in certain stories gaining traction or sinking without trace.
