Except it wasn't the brake but the accelerator. We went through a chain link fence and a 6 ft tall holly hedge before coming to a stop in our neighbor's front yard.

I feel for this kid. His father's reaction is perfect."

But, aside from the tinnitus, absence of other sensory input for awhile is relaxing. I've just accepted that the tinnitus is there but I don't have to add to it with additional distractions.  I'm a bit ADD, though, so it's a challenge. . . but a worthwhile one."

homestead,fdwcwod,t1_fdw462k,1578757461.0,"Second on the dryer outlet. Hopefully the trap is pretty routine but it's easy to forget about the outlet. Ours is in an area where we rarely go around the back of the house, so it was unintentionally neglected. Fortunately, its getting clogged *only* resulted in the heater element burning out. A couple hundred dollars later and we were good again. Could have been much worse. I check it more frequently now."

FUCKYOUINPARTICULAR,fdv93iv,t1_fdu8z5h,1578744814.0,"Disagree completely. There's nothing wrong with what you describe but the whole Karen meme is more about attitude, entitlement and bullying someone for something rather than simply asking politely. Of course there are times when asking for a manager is the best course but the Karen meme seems more about someone shitting on someone else out of self-importance.

Edit: to your point about misogyny, I don't mean to dismiss that misogyny exists. It does. It sucks. And it's wrong.  

Karen-equivalent guys who do that are equally as reprehensible and don't get a pass. There are other gender-specific stereotypes for males (e.g. Chad, Dick among them) who present themselves similarly."

instantkarma,fdbbq6o,t3_ekhmnl,1578255829.0,"My brother used to have a POS BMW 1800 that had been race-modded by the previous owner and then ragged out on the track. Paint was all alligatored but it still looked like a race car that had been detuned for the street. One day at a stoplight, a guy in a Mustang pulls up next to him at a light and looks over at his car with distain. Brother looks up the road a bit and sees a cop getting ready to pull out of a side road, so he starts revving his engine a bit. Mustang driver presumably thinking he'd show BMW shit-head how the world works gooses his throttle too. Light turned green, brother makes a lot of noise going into first and then just assumes the speed limit. Mustang is long gone....and my brother waved as he passed the guy getting pulled over.   


Brother of course wrecked the BMW within a few months.  He's still a dick."

cycling,fbwhmop,t3_eeo7jk,1577150163.0,"My experience riding twisty roads leading up to the Blue Ridge Pkwy in NC is more motorcycle based:

- The worst are people riding crotch rockets. They're loud AF, close in on you at a high rate of speed, and buffet you as they go by (because speed). They also tend to pass closer if you're on a curve.

- Next are Harley Riders but mainly because they're loud and travel in packs.

- BMW riders tend to be more courteous, ride a bit slower and have quieter engines.

- But Honda Gullwings riders are the best. Way quieter, ride slower and are very careful and respectful of the space available. Maybe because they skew older as riders.

Gross over generalizations to be sure but based on multiple years of riding the same roads.
