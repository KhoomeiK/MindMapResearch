funny,ffmtujg,t1_ffmaw8c,1580058820.0,I was not taught this in school but noticed it on my own except Kentucky wasn’t included in my thought process and Tennessee was a big penis.
WTF,fdzrewx,t3_encggp,1578794044.0,Am I the only one who read it as “Why...just wait” and proceeded to stare waiting for the gif to load....

I try to praise her for putting in good effort rather than being smart because I don’t want her to think everything will come easy just because things come to her so easy in school right now. Being I. 2nd grade, a large portion of the school curriculum is focused on reading. She far excels her classmates there so I don’t want her thinking things will always be so easy."
todayilearned,fdllfn0,t1_fdlchzk,1578526680.0,"Do internet search for “My Baby Can Read”. I don’t know if they still sell them or not. Came with flash cards, dvd videos, these little slide cards. It was less than $100.  Very worth it we thought."
todayilearned,fdl7t3b,t1_fdkx380,1578518509.0,"That’s how those “My Baby Can Read” programs work. We used it with my daughter when she was a baby. Typically kids learn the real world has sounds that represent objects and later ideas then later we explain to them that those sounds they learned can be represented by symbols or it dawns on them when we read to them. The baby reading programs just show them from the beginning that things can be represented by sounds AND symbols all at the same time. I assume for some disabled people you just leave out the sounds bit. It worked well for us, my daughter is in 2nd grade but reads at a high school level."
OculusQuest,fdl6ku0,t1_fdkwe7v,1578517916.0,Very much looking forward to it. :-)
OculusQuest,fdkw3oz,t1_fdkpbrh,1578512367.0,I’m not. I got my quest at release but just got Sidequest a couple weeks ago. I tried to install BMBF last night but it was t working and it was too late to keep trying. I’d love to play some custom songs but I barely have enough time to put my headset on and play for 20-30 minutes. That’s what is really selling the Quest I think. Ease and speed of setup and use.  Most people aren’t going to go through the effort of Sidequest until they feel they have exhausted most of the easily available experiences in the Official store.
