gaming,ffbyd6d,t1_ffbss6c,1579786687.0,"It sounds weird because people typically use ""male"" and ""female"" in clinical settings, like when you're filling out forms at a doctor's office or when they're referring to animals.  

Don't you think it's strange then that people will say, ""female,"" but you never see or hear anyone type or say, ""male,"" when referring to a human being?  

Ever since someone pointed that out to me, I can't unhear it.  Please, don't get defensive, but she said that it's like we're subconsciously and regularly treating women as specimens or animals while we don't put men in that category.

Once she explained her point of view, it seemed pretty obvious that it's the product of systemic (and sometimes internalized) sexism.  

I don't use that word for men OR women anymore unless it's in the context of my job at the hospital, and I try to point it out when other people do it because it genuinely bothers me now that I've given it some thought.  It cost me nothing to cut it out of my vocabulary, and I truly believe every little bit helps in the journey to true equality.

Edit: Btw, I'm a woman too."

Then it cost me about another $2000 to hire a lawyer when his live-in girlfriend of three years refused to relinquish his things... some of which had been in our family for generations and had a lot of sentimental value.   According to her, he ""gifted"" her ALL of his belongings before he died suddenly and without notice of a heart attack.  But despite having evidence that these things belonged to our family for years before he even knew her, the judge still let her keep over half of it.  Yay!  ""Justice!""

The problems come because we have different ideas of what families should look like, and studies have shown Republicans tend to prefer a strict, stern parental model while Democrats prefer one that focuses on compassion and empathy.

People get pretty fucking judgy about pets here.  I've had someone tell me I'm a terrible dog owner and my dog should be taken away when I asked for help because he was going through that puppy stage where he ate EVERYTHING and we couldn't kennel him because he would either hurt himself in there (broken teeth) or escape.  


It's like PETA logic in here.  These people would take pets away and have them euthanized before allowing them to live with what they arbitrarily considered a bad pet owner.  


My dog is just fine now, btw. He's three years old and now he only eats dog food and treats instead of furniture.  It took him a few years to grow out of it, but turns out it was just a nightmare puppy phase.

And finally, it's laughably hypocritical that the sitting president whose daughter is his senior advisor and whose son-in-law is the ""White House Innovations Director"" (while his two actual sons continue to run his business in the Trump name despite the fact that every other sitting president has honorably divested themselves of those kinds of holdings) suddenly honestly cares about nepotism.... but only when it applies to Hunter Biden.

I would send this to her if it didn't have that last little dig because maybe it would make her start to realize the rest of the world doesn't live this way.  As it is, when she hears them condemn Idiotman, she'll just shut down/harden her heart and immediately call it fake news and propaganda or something crazy.

BlackPeopleTwitter,feb0465,t1_fean8yt,1578954079.0,That sounds fucking horrible.  I get 50 notifications somedays just from one group chat with my mom and sister.  (Not an exaggeration!)  30 to 40 people??  Burn the phone.
interestingasfuck,fea0xva,t1_fe9zxwb,1578943213.0,"I do too, honestly.  I feel like Biden's skin is going to fall off with a strong wind, but no one ever says he's too old while they've said it about Bernie plenty."

Those you work with could just be cheap or they could be in debt from medical issues, student loans, trying to live above their means, gambling debt, etc.  Maybe less likely in the UK (where I assume you're from,) but all incredibly common in the US."

TheCircleTV,fe8msg1,t1_fe8hbu6,1578928052.0,"Or maybe she thought being a catfish at first was acceptable if it was the only way she could get on the show at all before revealing her real self and continuing the game in her own skin. 🤷‍♀️  

To be honest, that would be a 100% positive message, like ""I was afraid to be myself because of societal pressure to be this thin, airbrushed, picture perfect woman, but I had a change of heart, put myself out there, and people accepted me for me.  You can do that too!""

Or maybe her whole goal was to illustrate that she WOULD get treated differently based on her pictures... another good message, showing audiences that everyone loved her until they learned her size despite the fact that her personality was the same.  

People just love to hate..."
interestingasfuck,fe7maye,t1_fe6q1qb,1578916399.0,"Not to get too political, but I'm 90% sure this is why the media portrays Bernie as basically decrepit while Biden gets a pass even though they're only 1 year apart in age."

TheCircleTV,fe4pps9,t1_fe448mw,1578861656.0,"I think he's definitely worried about his image.  Plus, he hasn't been there that long!  Keep in mind that the show is taking place over 15 days total AND he had only been there a day or two at that point.  He probably missed his wife, but not enough to get teary eyed over it yet.  

He reminds me of a ""nice guy"" too though.  I just feel like there's plenty of reasons to dislike him without adding any!"
TheCircleTV,fe2xjuf,t1_fe08nh9,1578844009.0,Sean is basically being herself... Why did you include her?  You even have specific examples for the other two.  I'm thinking there's a reason you didn't include one for her and it's because you can't think of one.
TheCircleTV,fe2wx4t,t1_fdzrm8h,1578843718.0,Sean isn't offensive or entitled. She's been nothing but nice and sincere despite her fake pics.  Really there's just been one really bad catfish and I don't think I even have to name any names for you to know who I mean!
TheCircleTV,fe2w61w,t1_fdxl1or,1578843508.0,"I get what you're saying and you're right.  It's hard as a woman to be forthright or even an authority figure without being labeled as a bitch, but I think people call Mercedeze that for different reasons. 

She was labeled as a bitch in Sammie's eyes from the moment she put \#prettygirlsrock in that first girls chat.  I think Sammie would've liked her a lot better if she had just been more honest and herself.  


Chris liked her, yeah, but I have a feeling they had more one-on-one chats.  At one point they say they talked everyday I think.  


Rebecca/Seaburn saw a little more of her real personality that day he private messaged her to see how she was after everyone pegged her as a catfish.  I got the impression that he didn't really know her that well before that and I think the other players probably mostly feel the same way.  

Also, I personally hated the way she kept calling the women ""females,"" but never once called the men males. Bleh. Made me wonder if she had some internalized misogyny going on."

TheCircleTV,fe2sazv,t1_fe2qedb,1578842359.0,"Ooh wow.  Now that you mentioned it I zoomed in and she basically has Joey's face on a woman's body... crazy!

I wonder if the fact that Miranda isn't there says anything?"
TheCircleTV,fe2rsph,t3_enj7cd,1578842185.0,"I don't like it.  I think it would take away from a lot of the guesswork involved because suddenly now there's proof.  As it is you just have to take someone's word for it and that plays into the ""Do they trust that person?"" angle."

TheCircleTV,fe2ouig,t1_fe0j3tk,1578841317.0,"Yeah, he's obviously pretty charismatic and it shows through text.  Plus, I think all of them were impressed by his job, so that started him in a position of strength as well."
TheCircleTV,fe2o41p,t3_enkjcj,1578841074.0,"I like Shooby a lot, but I think there's more to him.  He says he's just being genuine and values loyalty, but then he does stuff like try to convince Sammie to keep Mercedeze as a ""smokescreen.""  And then when I learned he wanted to go into politics, I really thought he might be manipulating people into thinking he's genuine while secretly he's putting up a front.  I'm just not sure."
TheCircleTV,fe2n4b3,t1_fe1j6i2,1578840791.0,I thought Shooby was a software engineer himself.  Didn't he say he works in virtual reality?
TheCircleTV,fe2mitd,t3_enfnd5,1578840570.0,Is he really an artist??   Because that picture was godawful.
