chomsky,ff1ptx1,t1_ff1k7df,1579483505.0,"No, I do not mean in any way to say that it was necessary.  I don't think ""necessary"" is meaningful in these discussions because the entire concept of nations existing and having the claims that they do never enters into the realm of necessity from the start.  I'm simply saying that in the context of war, no answer to the question of how to prosecute torturers can be truly distinct from waging war in the first place.  Violence is violence, whether or not the person thinks they're on the right side or not doesn't really enter into it from some perspective of universal good or evil in a vacuum.  I don't intend to say that all acts are equal, but more that national governance as the sole legitimate agent of force and violence is almost always a self-insistence in ""knowing best"" that frankly has little or no root in the arable soil of truth.

And I'd say that ""should"" is also totally meaningless here.  Really break down a country's raison d'etre and history and you're rarely going to find a ""should.""  It's a land and supremacy claim, that they either defended or not, likely originating with some semi-warlord kings a few or many centuries ago.  There is no legitimacy to these claims beyond force or force of their allies and the vagaries of chance.

I suppose what I'm trying to get at is that nation-states as they exist today exist based on the abject evils and war-crimes of many thousands of years of waged violence.  War as the forge of nation-states is *already* the greatest possible evil.  Retroactive acceptance of torture is certainly an evil, but I struggle to find a way in which it is distinct or a greater transgression than the ""peaceable"" status quo.  We are not discussing the cessation of The Last Hostilities In The History Of Mankind and how to mete out meager justice.  How to turn out the lights of national violence, so to speak.  Instead, we sort acts of war into false chambers of acceptability.  Combatants, when taking up arms, do not surrender their capacity for pain or suffering and therefore the bulk of every action taken in war meets a trivial definition of evil."

Hostile to the artists, wants to control industry and consumer trends, meddles in artistic output, predatorily controls deadlines, plays adverse selection as hard as it can.  The perfect game from the perspective of the industry is one that releases yearly, with trivial changes, and requires constant buy-in.  Just like the ""big artists"" the labels' world revolved around creating.  It's the same machine but with more limited streams (as in, you're probably not playing Fallout 4 on your car radio or at a bar...there are fewer potential revenue streams for games.)"
worldnews,feanjyn,t1_feaf1e3,1578950599.0,"I just don't think it's okay--or ever can be--to diminish self-governance in the name of more or less anything else.  Democracy only works if people get to vote on things.  Voting for someone who selects someone who speaks to some external group behind closed doors for years and comes back with an agreement is simply incompatible with representational government.  It is simply *not representational*.  If a populace does not agree with a given international policy in a vacuum, *it must not pass*.  I trust no one who would place themselves up for election."

pcgaming,feajoel,t1_feaglj9,1578949629.0,"It's the way these kinds of industries work.  Record labels/movie labels (circa the 90s and before) aren't just people who sell records.  They're not just influencers.  They're gatekeepers.  They want to control the pipeline, not only of what sells but what is acceptable to sell.  They want to not only sell you some song you want, but also to show it to you and *get* you to want it in the first place, because it's positioned in a trend they've positioned themselves to exploit.  Piracy democratizes media; an artist is shared *because someone likes* it, not because it's profitable to do so.  And yes, there is a downside to that--some people may get something for free they would otherwise have paid for.  In a vacuum it might be negative.  But the industry is *already* hostile to artists.  They walk away with <15% in *good* deals.  And studies have shown that piracy helps in the realm of exposure, which *does* feed back into sales.  After all, you will likely not have an interest in an artist you've never heard before.  

DRM, at large, only hurts paying customers.  Save for online-only games, there's almost nothing you can't get from piracy and plenty of things DRM will make it harder for you to do.  DRM, for instance, can never *improve* a game's performance.  

It's laughable to say that companies can't compete with free, because *free* has been *freely available* for decades and the industries are doing just fine."

Games,fea5pfi,t1_fea2lvu,1578944662.0,"Especially in the open-world genre, it's not that simple.  You have some kind of NPC agent that can be varying levels of persistent, and your baseline assumptions about user hardware are going to be the determining factor--in ways that a beefier CPU or GPU won't be able to scale up and down with.  If you have 8GB of non-fungible world/engine data that has to be loaded at all times for the core assets, you won't be able to run that engine workably on a machine with less than 8GB RAM.  You can push the ceiling *higher* with texture sizing options and so on, but the guts of the game itself aren't always magically scalable downward."

Games,fe9v4we,t1_fe9t0fy,1578941750.0,"Plenty of open-world games were designed to be not *fully* open world because the legacy generation (at the time) consoles couldn't handle it.

Games,fe9udyd,t1_fe9ssdd,1578941527.0,"That's not really what's at stake.  Things like agent persistence, content streaming (versus loading screens), and other engine concerns limit what games can do.  Like how GTA handles spawning--the world disappears when you're not there, which means ""outrunning the police"" is faked since the police, technically, are spawning around you just out of sight all the time, even if it looks ridiculous and makes no sense and hurts the gameplay when a bunch of police cruisers spawn doing 50mph *down* a cliff that has no road access."
Games,fe9t7uh,t1_fe9jckd,1578941290.0,"I think exclusives are bad, but game engines that have to also work on older hardware are at least potentially going to be stopped from big sea changes since there will likely be core limitations.  Look at something like Skyrim, the cities were behind loading screens because previous-gen consoles couldn't handle everything being open-world.  There were (and still are) mods at the time to make the cities open-world with not much performance hit, but the consoles just didn't have the RAM or drive access speeds for it and there are sometimes side effects to making the cities open-world because it wasn't coded that way.
