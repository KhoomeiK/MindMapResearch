So ""heeling"" will give her something else to pay attention to and also give you something else to pay attention to (so tempering your reaction too in a good way) BUT I would also consider how else to build her confidence and lessen her fears:
  
* don't force her into interactions with strange dogs (we now recognize that throwing kids into the deep end isn't the best way to teach a kid to swim) ... which may mean *before she notices and is triggered* walking away from another dog (especially if you've already passed multiple dogs on the walk)
  
* Be confident, kind, and calm about other dogs and your dog's reaction ... if you get annoyed or upset with your puppy that can heighten her association of ""strange dogs = threats"" because even owner is upset
  
* consider arranging opportunities for her to meet one-on-one with calm, friendly dogs of your friends ... where she can be around them but not pestered by them; if things go well or if her reactivity isn't too much, consider puppy play sessions
  
* pay attention to which type of dogs she's most frightened of (she might be ok with dogs that look more similar to her littermates, or small dogs, or whatever -- build from there!)
  
* her reactivity might be being heightened by being on the leash (she wants to flee but can't so goes to next reaction which is fight) or may be heightened because she's new to you and the city neighborhood is scary ... these are just things to be aware of so that you can build positive experiences with/around them"

In my experience with my parents and their grandchildren, neither one is what I had pictured as a grandparent. Both have been petty and if I am honest, have emotionally harmed their grandchildren at times. While neither is physically abusive now, both have been incapable of loving unconditionally and my mom has been spiteful when she feels the other grandmother is getting more attention (penalizing her grandchildren for loving both grandmothers!) and my dad has been harshly judgmental -- providing a negative perspective of what they did, do, and might do in the future as doomed.

I can't quite figure out my dad tbh BUT this summer I realize that allowing his gaslighting about the harm **he did and does** was continuing to harm me ... that I needed to speak the truth to him at least a bit because I deserved to acknowledge the truth for myself ... it still is hard and I still way too frequently blame myself for their treatment of me as a child... which is really ironic as rationally how does a baby or a three year old or 7 year old deserve to be degraded, neglected and abused."

Think about what questions you have and write them down in advance (as these types of appts can be emotionally overwhelming in my experience and hard to think of all questions on spot) and feel free to ask the vet to let you have a chance to write all their answers down too. I would go by their guidance on what they suggest in terms of any need for additional tests (they may not need more).
  
So, not sure if your first vet told you yet but to minimize stress on the liver, there is a prescription dog food available ... this dog food is lower in protein because protein is harder for the liver to process. Even if not giving the prescription dog food, you can help your dog by giving less protein ( I give my dog2 carrots, apples, etc as treats for example to lower her level of protein in her total diet). I also avoid giving liver or heart treats as these are harder on her liver. Denamarin is also a supplement that is commonly given to dogs with liver issues.

For stateside vet schools, I admit that myself and almost all other customers won't know the difference in age or ranking of the programs ... with some variance for the really big name schools, who will in most part be big name schools based upon their undergraduate and grad school reputations. 
  
Thus, I think Univ of Arizona would be completely acceptable and even favored by basically all clients.
  
For veterinary practices, I would bring up the quality and reputation of the instructors when applying for a position. As others have said, these instructors are surely coming from other vet schools? In fact, for all grad programs (not just vet school), the reputation of the instructors has a huge influence on the reputation of the program for those within the know.

reactivedogs,ff4j4nm,t3_erkoob,1579564851.0,"Let me reassure you. You didn't ruin him. And post-adoption anxiety and even regrets are completely normal.
  
Decompressing from the shelter takes a while and aspects of their true personality come out so he may have appeared one way in the shelter but now appear reactive (he's still not adjusted completely, he was in pain from the neutering when bro was there, etc.) and his true personality may be reactive in certain situations and to a mild or middling level.
  
Some things to help you get through:
  
* Breathe and realize both you and your dog are trying your best and both are stressed and this stress is normal.
  
* That you'll both feed on each other's emotions ... and you can't tell him to stop reacting in a way that triggers you (he's a dog and doesn't speak language) so it's on you. What's making you stressed with him ... and what can you do to reduce your levels of anxiety so it doesn't heighten him. For example, if I see a dog approaching us and start to think ""oh boy, dog2 is going to freak out, oh boy, she's going to freak out, oh I don't want to deal with this, please strange dog don't come over here"" she can tell and it makes her more likely to react because I am telegraphing to her that the other dog is a ""threat"" to our well-being
  
* what are his triggers, taking what you already know and getting more detailed? Practice being like a scientist. Notice is he less stressed when he's in a certain location? Is the leash making him more reactive (can't  flight from threat so turning to fight) -- if yes, start to turn and walk away when you see something that will trigger him ... calmly and without thinking ""threat"" yourself. . . Sometimes I turn around several times or cross the street on our walks with dog2 ... every time a strange dog seems like it might come within X distance of us ... and often I can avoid dog2 even seeing the other dog.
  
  * what types or look of people are triggering him? What types of clothes? It's common for dogs, especially new rescues, to be more frightened of men (bigger, deeper voices, testosterone). And being reactive to people doesn't mean abuse by that type in the past -- it's often a lack of exposure or socialization during the puppy window and so now, new = scary and fear as a threat. Dog2 was likely not around other dogs at all as a puppy ... she doesn't understand dogs or doggy language and unless she is taught dog isn't a threat, she fears them. 
  
* Be aware of trigger stacking -- one ""threat"" may be ok, the second may elicit a middling reaction but the third is just way too much 
  
* Remember to praise yourself and your dog for the good times and the progress (it's too easy to dwell on the bad times)
  
* Read up on techniques for dealing with reactivity in a positive way and handling introductions to people that may scare your dog (it often is having the new person ignore your dog and even rain treats upon the dog while not talking to or trying to touch the dog)"

dogs,ff36g0c,t3_erddae,1579534811.0,"You are correct in wanting to take care in where you get your puppy. Puppies sold at Petland and other pet stores are almost certainly from puppy mills and definitely *not* from reputable breeders (no reputable breeder will sell to a pet store > reputable breeders screen their prospective puppy owners). Getting from a puppy mill or a pet store, you not only have a puppy born into misery (with its parents and other relatives suffering too) but also a poorly bred puppy that is at a much greater risk of inherited health issues because 1) the breeder didn't do health checks on the parents and all relatives 2) the breeder doesn't care and continues to breed dogs with known issues in their lines. You also will have a puppy that suffers some psychological deprivation from not being in the environment best for it in early puppyhood (a healthy, relaxed mom; people to cuddle and love, a home to be socialized in). Puppy mill puppies are also often separated from their mothers and littermates way too early resulting in lack of socialization with other dogs that they need to be well-adjusted. Dog2, my adopted rescue, is likely dog reactive (fearful of other dogs) because she didn't have the opportunity to learn about other dogs from playing and being with her litter ... she was likely separated from her litter too early so she could be trucked to the pet store and sold at the youngest legal age to sell.

I get it -- unless you've interacted with the system, you won't know ... and that website provides a way too rosy view of it. The truth is Legal Aid groups are overworked and underfunded. They get many more clients coming to them than they can usually assist. They may apply income criteria about who they will serve. And they also may only take on certain types of cases. They also triage their cases (because they have to) based on how likely they are to be able to settle or win.

dogs,fezo817,t3_eqzs33,1579459591.0,"This is animal abuse ... even in states with minimal animal protection laws, dogs are supposed to have food, water and shelter. 
  
I agree with the other posters about contacting whomever in building management you'd contact if there was an emergency. At the least, the dog outside on the balcony is hurting your own enjoyment of your apartment (you can't just have a relaxing weekend when a dog is potentially dying right outside your window)."

dogs,fezbh2y,t3_eqy8b2,1579455690.0,This is horrendous. They are torturing dogs and proud of it. And to proclaim that they do this to poodles ... a breed that just wants to do what its owners wants and are sensitive to even vocal criticism? To do this to a *poodle* ?!? shows how ignorantly evil they are about dog behavior.
ThriftStoreHauls,feyz1et,t3_eqy05t,1579452255.0,"Don't think they were just birthday cake toppers ... more a figurine you got every year on your birthday and you'd have a collection of them. The figurine would also look older for older years (here looks like a toddler, the one for a 16 year old would look like a teen)."
puppy101,fevqn36,t1_fevcbvh,1579400339.0,"You are right in feeling hurt. There are too many opinions to your post that are imo hurtful and unjust and even cruel. Yes, you may have a disability but it's clear that you and your mum are taking good care of your puppy. 
  
And honestly a look through all the other posts in r/puppy101 shows that tons of people without any health conditions have problems with training puppies through their biting and overexcited phases. 
  
I don't have helpful training advice but I did want to post to let you know that you appear to be doing a good job and should ignore (don't even read their comments) the haters and cruel ones who are not offering any helpful advice ... rather just being ""better-than-thou"" types questioning already made decisions and pushing rehoming. YOU are better and worth more than their cruelty.
  
What I would also advise is to see if your family and friends would be interested in helping out more....people often love to spend time with puppies. It doesn't have to be a gift to you ... you may also be able to trade with them (trading for something that fits you and your mom's abilities, for example, perhaps if an older child or older dog needs some sitting or even petsitting a cat for them). Having them walk your puppy will both give puppy opportunities to learn better how to walk on a leash and use up some excess puppy energy."

Be careful with the level of fat in added treats, especially the bacon, as dogs are susceptible to pancreatitis from too much fat. So lean cuts of meat are far better."
dogs,fetwkzw,t3_eql4yt,1579380765.0,Perhaps mix with chicken broth and then either give the broth alone or broth added on top dog food.

dogs,ferx4xk,t1_ferikli,1579359252.0,"Given the association/linkage of dog foods (especially grain-fee or boutique brands or ones with potatoes and/or legumes) with congestive heart failure, I would ONLY suggest dog foods that meet WSAVA guidelines -- so you know that food trials have been done to have the best chance of actually meeting nutritional needs and not causing harm. These dog foods are Royal Canin, Purina Pro Plan and Purina One, Hill's Science Diet, Eukanuba and I believe Iams (?). Avoid grain-free whichever brand you choose.
  
Since Royal Canin is a global brand and highly trusted, I would go with that one. I would also ask vet for their prescription hypoallergenic version. Otherwise Purina Pro Plan has a salmon version (but avoid the grain-free option)."
dogs,fervjlp,t1_fersl9r,1579358781.0,"It will get better. You are a good owner and your dog loves you. Whom she chooses to sleep with =/= the strength of her bond with the person.
  
My mom's dog is very bonded with her. My mom is her sun and moon. BUT mom's dog will choose to sleep with whichever visiting guests are there, rather than with my mom. Guests are more exciting.
  
As dog1 has shown me, the capacity to love for dogs is infinite and loving another does not diminish her love for me."
dogs,ferueno,t3_eqh1nr,1579358464.0,"It sounds like the owner isn't walking him when you aren't there so every walk with you is *wow, so exciting, oh my gosh so exciting!*
  
He probably also associates even your arrival with *exciting walk times!!!*
  
Until the owner gets involved, it will likely be difficult but it might be helped if you could get the owner to get rid of some of his energy before you arrive ... a active fetch session in the backyard or even a walk with her b4 you get there. If owner can't or won't, I would try and do the play session with him before the walk yourself."

Trust me, my friend, it makes cleaning your bed much less of a hassle if she loses control of her bladder (due to her UTI) on your bed."

Don't force her into any scary activities but also not consoling her that her fears are valid...just getting her to take a time out from her fears and reminding her that life is fun."

dogs,fehlmct,t3_ep4081,1579119037.0,"Dog2 went into heat right when I began fostering to adopt her. (Some very weird pics I sent to the shelter to confirm that she was going into heat 😮😁). 
  
I think it made her stress at adoption so much harder, poor thing. She had a LOT of new things being thrown at her plus her hormones raging. She had great difficulty settling (she would NOT sleep) and was moodier than normal (moodier than what I now know is her normal). She freaked when I tried to diaper her so I ended up not diapering her but having to wipe up spots on my furniture. I live in an apt in Chicago so had no choice but to walk her and the unneutered male dogs next door really bothered her (not good for a dog who already feared other dogs) ... I didn't know she was going into heat and their intense interest in her was one of my first signs. She was actually spayed while she was still in heat (she needed another surgery as well so both were done at same time rather than wait until her heat ended). 
  
Edit -- from other people whose dogs have gone through heat, I know that some dogs get very clingy and my sister's dog has gone through false pregnancies.
  
I know your dog will get spayed after her heat ends so less relevant but her hormones remained in her system for a while post-spay (spay doesn't remove the hormones immediately from system)."
dogs,fehkgr1,t3_ep66cw,1579118372.0,"I really think that Onyx was overloaded after the vet visit [not only being at the vet but likely some fear of what was happening and whether he was being abandoned again plus any pain from the vet check up] and then Dingo really set him overthreshold where all he could see was ""threat."" Dingo was also on edge by being separated from Onyx, smelling Onyx's fear and tension (+ vet smells) when he returned, and Onyx's behavior. And then both dogs also were pushed over by your tension too (my reactive dog2 and dog1 both also react to my emotional state as well) -- really hard to manage my human emotions so not blaming you, just pointing out that dogs, especially when feeling threatened and protective, will also act to 'protect' their humans too.
  
Yes, based on my experiences with dog1 and dog2, I would say these dogs can continue to live together. I think a really positive sign is that they normally play well together and seem to enjoy each other's company. I would seek out a veterinary behaviorist (vet specializing in behavior) as the best source of advice .
  
Perhaps contradictory but I am wondering if they'd have done better if you'd taken Dingo with Onyx to the vet ... dog1 helps reduce dog2's fears when she's in strange or scary places ... it's like it's her bit of normality ... also for Onyx might have reduced her fears that she was being abandoned again. I learned this when I took dog1 and dog2 for grooming and dog2 was taken to the back about 10 minutes before dog1 ... and dog2 started raising a ruckus in the back like I've never heard from her at the groomer's before (using they are taken back together or near together). I would talk to the veterinary behaviorist before going this route but wanted to point out."
dogs,fehj0t0,t1_feh2ego,1579117534.0,"This isn't really true. You can reassure a scared, crying puppy (that is crying because it's a scared baby in a completely different world than it's used to) without ""spoiling"" it.
  
Thinking that every bit of reassurance that a puppy is safe and ok = ruining a puppy IS akin to old-fashioned parenting like throwing a kid in the pool to teach them to swim.
  
For humans and dogs, scientific, psychological experiments have shown that  both do better (learn more quickly and learn better, become more confident and resilient beings) when there are supportive, positive interactions."
dogs,fehif38,t1_feh8e92,1579117180.0,"I have a set of stairs to my bed as well. Dog1 loves stairs and adapted to them quickly. Dog2 is frightened of stairs but was using them for a while ... then something happened and I picked her up to put her on the bed. Now, she'll wander around the bed whining until I pick her up onto the bed ... but still using the stairs to get off the bed!  I am ok with this because the stairs take the stress off their joints and reduce the risk of injury that they'd have if they were jumping off. Also ok with being a doggy elevator because I am a sucker for dog2's pitiful whines."
