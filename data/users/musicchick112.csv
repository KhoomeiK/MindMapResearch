college,ffgzi49,t3_etfpv7,1579919080.0,"I don't want to make you feel bad about yourself but this physically pains me to read. You're paying how much money to go to college and you slacked off this bad? You are really gonna need to get it together big time to bounce back from this. I don't feel bad for anyone who skips class and does this to themselves for no good reason, that is a really poor choice that I can't comprehend. Unless there is a really pressing health and/or family issue (in that case you shouldn't even be attending school and putting effort into healing), this is just really stupid I am shocked you are still allowed to attend the university after that. Do all of your homework, get extra help if it's too hard, study hard for tests, never skip a class, and put all your effort into your studies and grades. Use all of your resources on campus. It's really not that hard to do. I believe you can do it. Good luck."
AskMen,ffgyhk2,t1_fffgdtm,1579918322.0,Omg same. That show went downhill so fast. I got so bored I couldn't keep watching it. And that's saying something because I never get bored like that with shows and this one was just unbearable.
relationship_advice,ffend2e,t1_ffe4cle,1579855724.0,You’re right. Thought the word “might” softened the blow but honestly OP you need to run. Fast.
AskWomen,ffdzcbd,t3_et3lmz,1579832696.0,I ruin my chances by putting people I barely know on a pedestal in my head and then get mad and upset when they don't show the interest/attention that I want from them. So pretty much self-sabotaging is what ruins it for me. Lol.
AskReddit,ffdw0kj,t3_esxqar,1579830317.0,"That your parents know everything. As I get older, I realize that I spent my entire life thinking that the way they do things is the only right way to do anything. I guess I realized that I am allowed to have my own ways of doing and seeing things in my life, and that may not match up with my parents, but that's okay. I realized that I am my own person and my parents and what they believe do not define me and my beliefs as an individual."
college,ffdvfwt,t3_et2twa,1579829913.0,I don't get how this would be bad. That sounds like an awesome opportunity. You are an adult in college I think it is totally fair to accept the job.
relationship_advice,ffduj1c,t3_esxyqc,1579829264.0,"That is absolutely abnormal in my book. She doesn't shower for 3-5 days? That ain't right. And the fact that she doesn't change her underwear all week.... come on with that. What you described is fucking disgusting. You need to be upfront with her or seriously consider what is going through her head thinking that's okay. As a woman, I can tell you that this is repulsive, unsanitary as hell, and extremely unattractive. You might need to move on from this relationship. Good luck."
AskWomen,ffdswxe,t3_eswvtd,1579828113.0,"It's been over a year that I have been single, and I couldn't be happier honestly. I haven't dated much at all and instead I've been focusing on myself, my health, starting my career, and having fun with not a care in the world. Being single has been really fun for me. However, I am starting to feel that loneliness creep up on me (don't get me wrong, I love being alone more than the average person) but I am missing the love, affection, and intimacy that comes with dating and relationships. I don't know if this is naive, but I guess I'll meet the right person when I'm not looking? Would be nice if anyone could offer their thoughts on this way of thinking."
college,ffdsect,t3_esx42g,1579827745.0,"That's awesome! I was in your shoes not too long ago, but I never gave up and things worked out for me. Just stay persistent and good things will happen! Congrats!"
askwomenadvice,ffazfk7,t3_esdrho,1579748053.0,"Happens to me at work and it’s annoying. I have chronic dark circles. No matter how much sleep I get my circles are dark. If I don’t wear concealer, my coworkers say I look tired, hungover, sick, etc. I guess I can’t blame em but I guess I really do look like shit without a little makeup. Takes courage! Good for you though, do what makes you feel the best :)"
askwomenadvice,ff887es,t1_ff6xq6l,1579668816.0,Omg. I feel this so hard core.
AskWomen,ff27fad,t3_eqxs0f,1579495965.0,"My mom never makes me feel like I have to hide things from her. I trust her and because she isn’t extremely strict, it’s made our relationship so strong. She’s understanding, caring, and let’s me live my life but is reasonable at the same time. She supports me in everything I do. She is my biggest fan and she is the most loving person I’ll ever know. I couldn’t have asked for a better mom she taught me everything I know. She knows that I am a person who is growing and learning too.

I really believe that being a strict parent is the number one way for your child to resent you and not feel comfortable confiding in you. I’ve seen it first hand with my friends. The over-the-top strictness does the complete opposite. It forces your children to hide things and lose trust in you. Growing up, it was always the kids with super strict parents who did the stupidest shit and ended up in dangerous situations. I could always call my mom no matter what and she would be there for me in a heartbeat. I wish more parents could see why trusting your child is so important for their health, safety, and their relationship with you."

offmychest,fen9fkp,t3_eq0mo8,1579279851.0,"I literally just said this yesterday how BS this is. If it requires 3-5 years of experience, it’s not entry level. Sorry not sorry."
AskWomen,fem2ajh,t3_epokye,1579237412.0,"My lips get extremely dry, even chapped if I don’t drink enough water. I also get a headache. Drinking a ton of water solves these problems for me and also I do notice my skin just looks a lot more alive and glowy."
askwomenadvice,felqagg,t3_eptudm,1579228328.0,"Never had a sweet sixteen, but went to a few of them. It’s pretty stupid in my opinion. What’s so significant about turning 16? Waste of money. Wait until you turn 21 and do something fun or a big night out... or better yet, wait until you get married to spend money on a big extravagant party. Lol."
AskWomen,fejobb2,t3_epd46j,1579181500.0,"I’m kinda insecure about my nose, and one day I was at work and this gorgeous girl genuinely complimented me saying she loves my nose and how unique it is. That has always stuck with me. Made me feel a lot better about myself."
seduction,feisbu2,t3_ep8fm3,1579145950.0,"I think everyone is reading way too much into this. I think what OP means when saying one should have a high value internally is that they should have respect for themselves and not to forget that they are deserving of someone who truly accepts and loves them for who they are. It's not that deep people. Unless it is, that is NOT the vibe I got from this post. Having a sense of high value simply means just knowing your worth and not getting too caught up in what you did wrong.... why someone doesn't like you... blah blah blah. The right person will come along. Having confidence and self-respect is not arrogant... it's not something that needs to be projected onto other people. It's a state of being."
AskMen,feb7yg5,t1_fe8o9an,1578956204.0,Who are you and where did you come from.
dating_advice,feb3ae1,t3_eo5spx,1578955019.0,"This may sound harsh but you sound like you need to learn how to be with yourself before you try to be with someone else. Try investing your time and energy into the things that bring you happiness and somewhere along the way, you will meet like-minded people who add to your life.

In my own personal experience, getting in too deep with others is not worth the time and heartache when you could be living your best life and bettering yourself so that when you are finally ready to date and love another person, you will be comfortable with yourself and accept that no matter which way it goes in a relationship, you'll be okay. 

Wishing you the best of luck in your future endeavors."
dating_advice,fe657e5,t3_entt5b,1578882043.0,"Trust me, you’re good. I feel like everyone makes a way bigger deal out of the fart thing then it needs to be... yeah I get it it’s embarrassing but if the girl/guy is a real cool ass person, they won’t care and will find it funny/endearing. Good for you, keep rippin ass my friend"
offmychest,fcam5w1,t3_ego7vf,1577571984.0,This is hilarious
offmychest,fcakfbg,t3_egonvr,1577570937.0,"Nothing truer has been said. It’s been a year since my first (and three year long) relationship has ended and it has been the best year of my life. Learning so much about myself, doing whatever I want in my life, and enjoying my own company is honestly amazing. It is strange to me when people hate single-dom so much, because it is some of the most important and fun times of your life. I’ll wait until someone comes along and adds to the great life I already have."
askwomenadvice,fc4qc8g,t3_efsg43,1577424602.0,"You have every right to be mad. This goes back to the basic concept of you never know what someone is going through. By that, I also mean that you never know how much something means to a person, so it’s best to use your best judgment and tread lightly. Now considering this person is your FRIEND, I would be concerned, and I would seriously consider trusting them, keeping them around, and I would question their values and how they treat other people.  That was fucked up what your “friend” did and I would talk to her about it for sure."
AskMen,fc4pxc0,t3_eg5e8f,1577424205.0,I feel the same way. There are alot of people who tell me things that I seriously don’t give a shit about. It lowkey worries me how much idc. Lol
dating_advice,fbci1oh,t1_fbazrz9,1576724393.0,This made me feel a bit better about approaching guys.. maybe now I’ll just strike up conversation with a really cute guy at my gym that I’ve had my eyes on... :)
