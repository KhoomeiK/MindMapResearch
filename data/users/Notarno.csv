I'm sorry, but you can't work through your emotions if you just keep them in untangable terms. Saying things outloud, writing them down, communicating them with others, allows you to be open to changing them or your interpretation. There's a reason people journal and write down thoughts--it's not just to remember them in the future. Explicit thinking allows for much deeper encoding and thought processes. Obviously, there's a time and a place for showing emotion. Being able to control it is much healthier than never showing it ever."
