Sure, give the white house, old and new executive offices, scotus, capitol, and hill/senate offices to ""Federal DC.""

But this isn't 1780 any more, if PA wants to try to force the federal hand by blocking an office, they'll just have everyone telework.

Federal parks are already their own Jurisdiction so that doesn't need to change."

Come to us, we're a gastropub still explaining what a gastropub is in 2020! It didn't make a shred of sense and basically shitted on every non-chain bar and restaurant.

Its unclear what demographic they sought other than perhaps white boomers from small rural towns in Middle America who didn't like how their kid came back from cosmopolitan des Moines eating spicy exotic food like general tsos chicken.

The bar itself in Chinatown was fine as a convenient place to grab a drink but the ads just really stood out as among the worst and most obnoxious that I can remember"

LawSchool,ffk4unh,t1_ffjdz5z,1580015910.0,"Almost certainly not. Very few agencies are going to bother with the steps unless you're coming with genuinely incredible experience. Probably gs13. 10 steps takes what, 15+ years to hit normally? Usually with fed ogcs, you start at 11, then 12 within 2 years, 13 within 5, 14 within 10, and 15 is discretionary. Some agencies are really 11-15 in 4 years. Most aren't. Some force all new hires at 11-12, and some will hire at 15. But 4 years in biglaw? That's probably gs 12-13. Fed ogcs are perpetually underfunded."

You can teach basic, black letter first amendment law pretty easily. There isn't simple black letter 9th or 10th amendment law now"
LawSchool,ffbzwlg,t1_ffa7xqi,1579787924.0,"You're right about doj. They usually have their pick of future litigation employers, though they also often have options with internal investigations, and regulatory work.

OGC in most agencies is where you work if you're a lawyer in an agency. Usually there are a couple separate offices with lawyers (inspector general offices, rulemaking/policy offices sometimes, ALJ offices), but for most agencies that I'm aware of, 90%+ of the lawyers will be in OGC, so it's more the default than the prestigious position.

Most ogcs are broken up into components and suboffices though, and many of those have a specific office of *the* general counsel. I have heard this office called OGC main, the immediate office, or a variety of other terms. Sometimes that office is prestigious and basically acts as legal counsel to the appointees and serves as the final voice when there are internal disputes in wider OGC or major issues. Some offices like this will be predominantly executive service and senior gs15s. Other agencies just dump every agency-wide function in their OGC main and its no more prestigious than any other component.

Complex litigation divisions within OGCs are usually pretty prestigious, and usually recruit heavily from doj, but again, depends on the agency.

I have been a fed for most of my career, and absolutely love it. I have worked for politically significant and insignificant agencies, on all sorts of issues, and enjoyed it all. Even when the sky is falling, everyone is overall more sane because you don't have to worry about wasting billable time, and for most offices, you'll average 40-60 hours per week, with 40 being more common. You can do things like start up your own projects because there aren't billables, and senior attorneys are usually more approachable. There's no partner track rat race, and it's less hierarchical. I was single handedly running complex adjudications worth hundreds of millions of dollars within a year. I did everything from building the record to writing every single filing, and leading the settlement discussions. And that's normal. You don't have 7 layers of billable review for everything, so you can really swim free."

But a bunch of them don't really have any coherent web presence either. One has a weird website, and the street view picture has a phone number with no apparent results, and no business name on the sale poster
