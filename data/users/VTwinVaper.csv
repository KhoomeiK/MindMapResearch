I’m an EMT, but have been considering whether there would be any justification in going for my AEMT here in the next year or so, before going full medic.

Thankfully medic class here is $9500, and is on an every-third-day rotation (except weekends when class doesn’t happen) to allow you to work a 24/48 schedule and have enough time for your rotations (In reality you just don’t sleep for 9 months and most medic classes here have 2-3 divorces during that time due to the stress and workload).

There is a local trade school that does a 4 month EMT course, a 4.5 month AEMT, and a 9 month Medic class. I figure it would suck to finish the AEMT class and think “hell I could be halfway to my medic now if I had picked that one instead.”

I’ll probably sleep on it for a couple years. At the end of the day my I want to ensure I’m not a crappy medic, so for now I’m going to spend as much time as I can learning everything I can to be a halfway decent EMT.

facepalm,feit1ol,t1_feis0hh,1579146464.0,"While O2 tanks are generally charged to 2000 they can function well below 300psi. However oxygen delivery is measured not in PSI but liters per minute. The actual force pushing air through is regulated by the amount of o2 allowed through the, well, regulator—and the actual size of the opening is quite small even compared to the tube diameter. 

If you tried to blow through the oxygen tubing it would be difficult but not much more than breathing through a straw. The diameter is generally somewhere around 1/4” (inner diameter) so it isn’t going to be easy but you could force adequate air through with some effort.

As others have mentioned here though, perfusion is oxygen is not the only issue here—sure the cells are being starved of oxygen, but the CO2 build up is such that the cells are going to hurt a lot more due to CO2 toxicity. 

For those wondering about rescue breaths in CPR, they differ from this example because exhaled air still has oxygen that was not fully absorbed during the gas exchange process. And compressions are going to help considerably in not just circulating blood but also forcing air (and CO2 out). Interestingly enough newer studies hint that passive oxygenation (oxygen sucked in when your chest recoils between CPR compressions) may be more beneficial than the breaths themselves. That’s why fast, strong, interrupted compressions are so important in CPR, even if it means missing a rescue breath or two."

He wasn’t physically abusive, but their relationship was toxic and broken, and now that they have left and found more compatible parters they are both better people and better parents.

Every couple is different, and the perception children have of parents and divorce varies from child to child, and can change as kids age and mature as well.  My sister was 8 or 9 when my parents split and to her it was the worst thing ever, but she had not yet reached an age where she could see how bad their relationship had become, and how much it was affecting the family as a whole.  As an adult she gets it, and since the majority of her life as a minor was spent with a divorced parent who had found a better partner, she had a much better example of what a good and productive marriage can be, so now that she is married she is less likely to have the same problems our parents had.

Most of my life as a kid was spent with parents who fought and hated each other, and my wife was the same way—since we didn’t have good examples of a good parental system for a big chunk of our non-adult lives, we have more trouble when we argue because we literally didn’t ever see our parents have constructive, non-hateful arguments."

Kids don’t have a choice—for the first chunk of their lives they are “along for the ride” and basically go with what the parents do.  They don’t know that their parents are idiots, and shouldn’t have to suffer because of it.

Choosing to raise your kids in a certain religion (or outside of religion entirely), choosing to send them to private versus public school versus homeschool, choosing whether to make them learn how to play an instrument or shoot a gun responsibly—these are things that some would say are dangerous or somewhat detrimental to a kid, but we don’t have overwhelming scientific evidence that any of these things are specifically, fatally harmful.  Things like being unvaccinated, not wearing a seatbelt, not wearing a helmet when riding a bicycle—these are things that we know are statistically much more likely to harm kids, and in such cases I think the government should be able to step in and take decisive action.

I’m about as conservative as it gets, and I think people should have the basic rights of free will on what they can do with themselves and how they can raise their kids—but when someone is taking an action (or allowing their kids to) that has a significant chance of harming another person (or in the kid’s case, the kid himself or herself), all bets are off."

vaxxhappened,fdglmuz,t1_fbcmebv,1578401469.0,"Welcome to the science of medicine.

Just about every thing we do, every pill we take, every treatment for any ailment has its own share of side effects.  Yet the same people who refuse to vaccinate their kids because “1 in 100,000 will have a high fever requiring a possible doctor visit” often have prescriptions for meds with side effects such as “sleep walking, running or DRIVING with no memory of the event afterward.”

With most medications there are much greater side effects than with vaccines, so people have the option to weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision.  I used to take Ritalin as a kid for ADHD-I (called ADD back then before they were rolled into the same umbrella).  For me at the time the side effects (insomnia and facial tics) were worse than the ADD, especially because anyone who was “different” at that age was prime bullying fodder.  As an adult, and a first responder, I need to be able to do things like pay attention, remember addresses, etc. and I can’t compensate for it as well without medication, so I take Adderall.  I do have some side effects which I can manage, but am glad that as a kid my parents gave me the choice.

But vaccines are different.  The statistics are so soundly on the side of vaccinating that there is virtually no reason for most people to be vaccinated.  And while there are some population groups that may have to hold off on some vaccinations (weakened immune systems, not yet old enough, etc.), that only strengthens the argument of mandating vaccinations for everyone else: because it creates the herd immunity, making it statistically less likely that one person who is unvaccinated will meet another (infected) unvaccinated person.  

In general I am very much in support of body autonomy, with the exception of when your choice of what you do with your body negatively and severely effects others.  If your action (or with vaccines, inaction) reaches the level of negligence to the point that you are statistically much more likely to negatively effect others, you should in some cases be forced to take (or stop taking) action.  Being unvaccinated makes you the medical equivalent of a drunk driver: sure, you haven’t hurt someone yet, but your reckless actions are such that the chance that you will hurt someone else is massive, and you need to be stopped.

Kids are not old enough to legally have the option to make a fully informed choice.  I think for them vaccines should be mandatory as well, but I do believe that some other actions (such as wearing a seatbelt) should be mandatory even if they are not mandatory for adults.  I’m all for saying “go for it” if you want to take an action that will likely only negatively effect you, but when it comes to your innocent child, all bets are off."
vaxxhappened,fdgku5q,t1_fbc6olo,1578400699.0,"They can be harmful though.  Many vaccines have very minor side effects, and somewhat major ones that affect an infinitely small percentage of the population.  But the statistical chance of you being affected by any of these pales in comparison to the chances of you contracting a disease if you refuse to vaccinate.

It’s like wearing a seat belt.  My mother in law refuses to because “I know someone who died because they wore theirs and if they had not, they would have survived.”  Yeah, I get that, but statistically you are many times more likely to die from an ejection than you are to die trapped in a car in a river/on fire/etc. due to a stuck seat belt.  And even if you somehow did get stuck, seat belt cutters are a thing (and my wife and I have them bolted on to our car within easy reach, secured in a way they can be easily removed if needed but not go flying in the event of a crash).

Antivaxxers and people who play the lottery/gamble away their paycheck are bad at math to their own detriment.  I bet a push for more education regarding statistics and other mathematical skills in K-12 would increase vaccination rates even more than what we are doing now."

electronic_cigarette,fcx7v20,t1_fcwwheo,1578054743.0,"So when you go buy a candy bar it has a bar code, right? So let’s take Reese’s for example. The Big Cup has a different bar code than the regular, and the King Size is different too. Reese’s Big Cup Chocolate Lovers has its own size, as do the king sized versions of each. E-liquid is the same. If you have 10 flavors with 5 box strengths and 3 pg/vg ratios in 3 sizes, that is 450 different bar codes total for your products.  But with any “tobacco product” as defined by the FDA, each individual barcoded item has to separately pass FDA inspection, which can take years, and you pay for it. Estimates I’ve seen are $300,000 to $1 million plus for a single item.

Marlboro has no problem with this...they release a new cigarette type every few years, pay their fee, and be done with it. But no cigarette company has anything close to the variety and customizability of vaping. And most vape shops don’t have a few hundred million dollars sitting around to spend on approval. Blu does, as does Juul, and since each will only have a small handful of products now, can easily afford to go through approval while everyone else is forced out of the market.

So what will likely happen is a few big names will get three or four unflavored types of liquid approved. Vape shops will happen to sell other things like “candy flavoring” or something similar and with a wink and a nod you’ll add it to your liquid, all the while the shopkeeper will just hope he doesn’t get busted by the FDA who may try to argue that if it’s sold in a vape shop, it’s a tobacco product (even wire and cotton balls).

In the end the gray market will be huge, and the small number of surviving vape companies will be even bigger than that.

ems,fcwn82v,t1_fcwkrm4,1578030464.0,"I don’t, no. If you’re near Lexington I would also recommend Powell county (Director is an EMT so he allows for a wider scope of practice, as they have fewer ALS trucks and learn to do more with less) and Versailles/Woodford County (the director insists if a medic can do it, an EMT must learn it. Intubations, IVs, IO, etc.; even though we can’t do it in the field he feels that if we know how to do it and when to do it we can better support our medic.

I also did some ride time with Nicholasville and they are very progressive and safety oriented. John Mackey, one of their medics, died a few years back after being hit by a car on a dark night on the job (he wasn’t wearing a reflective vest and a young teen driver wasn’t looking out for someone in the road); now their director Jamie Goodpaster is extremely safety conscious and everything they do is based on making sure you are as safe as you can be. They are a bit harder to get on at but it’s a well respected agency.

As for Lexington and Richmond it’s really dependent on what you want. Richmond wants a few years experience and will run you to death but you’ll make like $13-15/hr.  Other smaller agencies like the ones I mentioned will pay 10-12 for full time and you will get to sleep 5-7 hours a night on a 24. So it really depends on what you are looking for; I am in it for the long haul so I picked slower agencies so I won’t burn out quickly."

You just have to do it the right way. If your medic is giving a report maybe offer to put the stretcher away and take that time to sanitize it, put on new linens, put it in the ambulance and put the monitor etc away. Don’t say “I know you don’t like to clean so I’ll do it for you,” just clean it up covertly so when they do notice it is clear you’re cleaning for you, not to trash them.

The hospital right up the road is the opposite, and the hospital even further up the road (all three on the same street in Kentucky) prefers anyone with a pulse...being able to successfully feel for a pulse is not necessary.  

I’m a bit new to health care (went as far as I cared to in the business world before realizing after way too long it wasn’t for me) so I’m learning here as I go—so I’m generally the oldest yet least experienced on any truck I climb into, but I’m enjoying expanding my knowledge nonetheless."
ems,fcu35in,t1_fcu2xl9,1577971147.0,"My bad, will edit. Not a career path that ever really interested me, around here the local trade schools go overboard on recruiting to the point that a CNA is lucky to find a job anywhere except a nursing home or as a caretaker for a rich family."

A CNA is a certified nursing assistant. Very quick to get but doesn’t get you a lot of job prospects in some areas. You could do some work at a nursing home or dialysis center but are unlikely to be working in an emergency room saving lives (edit: depends on location. In my city we are over staffed on CNA’s to the point that there aren’t a lot of job prospects as one but they seem very needed elsewhere).

As for them saying they hate their job, some people on this sub do, but for the most part people want to bitch about their job because it isn’t as good as it could be, but those same people are often unlikely to take the steps needed to change their situation (new location, new education, new career) which tells me they don’t hate it nearly as much as they say.  

As an example if you made a post about how much you love EMS and being an EMT/paramedic your post would likely not get much support and you’d see comments like “don’t worry, once you’ve done this job for a whole month you’ll hate it too,” and so on.

People also complain about being paid “less than McDonalds.” Yet I’ve yet to see a paramedic leave EMS to flip burgers, because it’s unlikely you’ll find a McDonald’s that will let you nap on shift and work 72 hours a week with full retirement at 20/25 years with benefits.  Their hourly wage is less than some McDonald’s, but their actual annual salary is considerably more.

And at the end of the day you can become an EMT with 120-130 hours of classroom training and passing a test that requires an 8th grade reading level, and make close to the median household salary while getting to sleep on shift if you pick a slower agency (salary dependent on location of course). 

Here about 40k a year is the median salary for a family of four and an EMT at a slow-ish agency will make about $11/hr, which sounds crappy until you consider that on a 24/48 rotation you work the equivalent of 3389 hours a year after overtime, or about $37k a year if you don’t pick up any extra shifts. I live in a small town, but from midnight to 7 I’ll normally get a call maybe 50% of the shifts I work, and sleep through the night the rest of the time so I can enjoy the next two days I have as time off. 

Bigger city agencies are much different. My town staffs 2 full time and one part time truck and averages 3500 runs a year, so we have to basically pay people to sit around because the alternative is being short staffed when shit hits the fan.  A bigger city doesn’t have that problem as bad: they may have 50 trucks (some of them part time), and because of how averages and bell curves work may have 25-40 of them actively doing runs at any given time without being short staffed. They may pay a few bucks more an hour, but in a 24 hour shift you may get lucky to get an hour or two of sleep, and people burn out quickly. 

TL:DR - take any complaints here with a grain of salt. This sub is the water cooler and locker room rolled in to one, so saying you hate your job is kind of expected regardless of where you work. If your son likes action maybe he could consider applying to be a hospital ER tech. It’s more money, less hours, but constantly busy. Many of my coworkers will work a shift or two a week at an ER to get a good taste of action without burning out, and many hospitals will hire you with just your EMT."

Our building was built long before ADA regulations existed, like the one in this pic probably was. There are minimum dimensions for a handicapped stall. So since they couldn’t knock out a wall, they did the next best thing: knock out the divider between two stalls. 

But then you’re stuck with two toilets. So let’s remove one, right? Unfortunately some people can’t bear to destroy a perfectly functional item, even if it is useless where it is, so both toilets remained. I bet you this was the same situation."

I’m very sorry you went through this. At my last job we had a meeting that discussed the entire scope of the training, and we then had a couple days break before the training to decide whether we individually felt we could attend.  We were given the option of telling our supervisor, safety team members or HR that we wouldn’t be able to attend and we would be given an alternate written training designed to be less intense. Each attendee was put in random small classes to ensure nobody knew if a person declined to participate or not.

It’s a shame they don’t do this more often. This was for a call center, in an area far from any recent mass shootings—our management just felt it was the right thing to do.

OP: as others have said, a reasonable accommodation needs to be asked for and provided. It is likely that you will be asked to undergo at least some sort of training however—perhaps a written document showing how to quickly and safely exit the building etc., and your acknowledgment that you understand it. Hopefully something that lets you check off a box in their system, while providing you with a much safer, less intense method of instruction."
