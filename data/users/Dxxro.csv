DBZDokkanBattle,ff8wh5j,t1_ff8btwo,1579698373.0,I was thinking start from super and go to kid Buu after the 3-5th turn under 50% health.
DBZDokkanBattle,ff8wepm,t1_ff8vit5,1579698312.0,"I'm saying they should add a new LR Gotenks, we only have goten and trunks and Gotenks going ssj3 had everyone shook."
DBZDokkanBattle,ff8bl7f,t1_ff8arqs,1579671972.0,Nah we already have enough Goku LR. I was thinking LR gotenks transform from base to ssj or ssj to ssj3. Kid Buu would be a beast.

offmychest,fdl2eq2,t1_fdl08pi,1578515899.0,"You're assuming that I'm a child who's rejecting and going against all her wishes and get any and everything I want. I'm not ungrateful I'm grateful for all she's done. It's the fact that she's forcing things down my throat that I cannot get with. I support her going vegan but please don't force it on me. 

For example let's say you dislike or cannot have cheese but you support it wouldn't it be odd if someone forces you to eat it? I'm not very entitled either believe it or not. All the things I have done have been to benefit my family it may not be much but I have what I do now because of my mother and brother and the times I've worked it wasn't for myself it was to support my family. For you to make a bold statement to claim I'm ungrateful, a beat, and entitled is very one sided you're speaking as if you're an old man looking at a rich kid who makes millions. But it is old people who have been hypocrites and try to force things on the younger kids that suits your beliefs and needs because it pleases you and feel like you'll benefit and not the child.

In short I support the cause but don't try to force it down my throat. If you keep forcing someone to do something they'll eventually grow to hate it."
offmychest,fdkzljj,t1_fdkz8y8,1578514405.0,It has its pros and cons I support it as long as you're not forcing it down my throat you know?
offmychest,fdkyy2h,t1_fdkyowf,1578514041.0,"She also said she'll buy almond milk, it's actually pretty good exchange for regular milk if you're making coffee you know?"
offmychest,fdkykwz,t1_fdkye52,1578513822.0,It's fairly new and pretty well packaged so the smell won't leak so hopefully it'll stay pretty holy with the other 4 packages of dairy cheese countering it.
offmychest,fdkyeaa,t1_fdksewb,1578513714.0,I respect it as well but trying to force it on me is a little over the top.

offmychest,fdky0zj,t1_fdkwz1b,1578513498.0,You're name's sasquanched. Also try to take into consideration people's situation and position before making a statement and jumping to conclusions like a buffoon.

offmychest,fdkuuze,t1_fdkuj4z,1578511631.0,I know it's healthy as well but the cons also don't balance or outweigh the pro of how I regularly eat.
