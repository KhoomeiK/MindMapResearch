So, do you agree or disagree?  Reminder: observations, apparently, are unimportant.  As are examples."

That much is clear.

> I asked you how you came to your claims. You answered that they came from observation which I said is a poor way to formulate a claim and offered a better way.

But you didn't show that you performed those steps spelled out in that way, so...

> You said there was no “FragileBlackRedditor” to support your point. I’m pointing out that there are indeed many groups like that, so there is no support there.

No.

First, there is no subreddit based upon attacking a race by name that has been up nearly as long as that sub.  Second, what I said was:

> Yes, but ***to the overly online, woke left***, there's only one group of people that you can criticize for their race/gender- and it's not black people.

So what right the is doing is inconsequential in this conversation.  This is now the *third time* I've had to correct you, with you making assumptions about what I said and then needing to be pointed to my words.  Can you or can you not discuss the things *I've actually said*?

> But there are lots of groups on reddit and other social media that criticize “other racial analogues”. Heck that’s all “r/gamersriseup” does any more.

I'm talking about the woke left.  Why are you responding to me if you're not?

> Will you only accept examples that use those exact terms? It seems reasonable that racism in different communities takes different forms, doesn’t it?

I'm open to see what you straws you can grasp, as opposed to conceding a rather simple point."
moderatepolitics,feuofkb,t1_feun5p6,1579388458.0,"> As an aside, while criticism of Israel is not necessarily anti-Semitic, disproportionately singling out the Jewish state for criticism absolutely is.

Sometimes.  Sometimes, though, there's the type that is just against the US in general- /r/chapotrapohouse types and their dozens of similar subs, rose twitter, etc- and Israel being a huge US supporter draws their ire mostly on those grounds.  These are the most likely folks to talk about Palestinian ""genocide""...as the Palestinian population increases."
moderatepolitics,feun0k9,t1_feuivq4,1579388074.0,"I grew up in Philadelphia in such a place where there were two types of ""white people"": Catholics and Jews.  If you were a Protestant, you were black.  The idea of a Protestant white person was something I knew, intellectually, but wasn't something I ever saw much of until I went to college and met people from rural areas/the South.

So I'm in complete agreement, I just don't understand the anti-Semitism thing from anyone.  They were just kids that went to ""church"" on Saturday.  That's it."
moderatepolitics,feulwh1,t1_feuj364,1579387781.0,"> Hm. Do you think that isolated observations are a good way to build a worldview? If so, I’d like suggest some alternatives I think you’ll find much more accurate.

What ""worldview"" are we talking about here?

> They’re your claims, and I want to know rational they are. I have no interest in refuting them as that would just reinforce my existing worldview.

So, no.

> I haven’t seen a good, rational definition of “woke” so I avoid that word but that sub says it’s left leaning in the sticky post so that part is clear. But there are many similar right-leaning subs like r/WatchRedditDie so I’m not sure what these isolated examples do to support your claims.

What do right-leaning subs have to do with what I said?  What I said was:

> Yes, but to the overly online, woke left, there's only one group of people that you can criticize for their race/gender- and it's not black people. So it can't be discussed on many prominent media platforms, period.

That's the discussion here.  The existence of a sub- for left leaning people, you concede- that exists to criticize people of a certain race- white- but not any other racial analogues is one piece of evidence of my observation.

> You said that not many do, but if many of them have done it at least once, that would counter that claim, no

I said ""many ***prominent***"".  

> I’m not sure but that’s not what your claim was, is it? Issues of racism within black culture are touched upon by most outlets at some point or another. It’s not a hidden a phenomenon and one that’s had a fair amount of study.

Are they?  I'll credit another user /u/reseteros, with this, [part of a post on this very subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/eh6tsh/5_stabbed_in_antisemitic_attack_at_new_york/fcnn44f/?context=3), about anti-Semetic crime in New York, just recently:

Is there an equivalent story about ""minority rage"" or something having a negative effect?  No.  Wouldn't you agree both are bad?

If you believe that those media outlets talk about those things (tips to avoid your black kids becoming gang members, black rage, minority rage), I'd love to see some examples."

I didn't use statistics.  I've observed it.  Do you have some statistics that refute my observations?  Again, would you consider /r/FragileWhiteRedditor to be part of the woke left?  

> You sure did, I misread. So you’re confident no media discussing this exists at all in major outlets? Seems like I’ve seen examinations of this in something like The Atlantic but I could be wrong.

Did I say ""no"" media?  Outlets like WaPo, NYT, and CNN certainly focus more on ""white"" as a race negatively than they do ""black"" as a race negatively.  Which, when we're discussing hate crimes committed by a black people, seems very germane to the discussion.  But you're saying they *don't* do that?  That my observations are just wrong?"
