skyrim,ffmx7jy,t1_ffkpwy8,1580059807.0,So true! I literally had to outrun them when I was at an early level. Vampires can be particularly tough for me also.

teslore,ffcnawv,t3_esqkce,1579803091.0,"I was originally going to mention Ulene Hlervu but she seems to be, like Else God-Hater, not an atheist but a Daedra devotee. I originally thought her an atheist but here is her greeting. 

*I'm Ulene Hlervu, Castle Mage. Perhaps you've been warned off me as a scandalous, blasphemous scoffer and cynic. The characterization is completely accurate. I despise the gods and those who bow before them."" If you ask Ulene about Cheydinhal, she will respond: ""You worship the Nine Divines, perhaps? Have they ever helped or harmed you? Of course not. Now, worship a Daedra Lord, and you get effects... bad ones, of course, but clear and measurable effects.""*

I was going to say “AHA!” But it seems like even she recognizes the existence of the Daedra and likely the Aedra as well, though she sees them as useless. 

I wonder if her attitude changes after the events that led to the end of the oblivion crisis occurred - particularly Martin’s infusion with the power of Akatosh to battle and defeat Dagon. The aedra are not useless."

cars,ff77zas,t3_erxuwm,1579642908.0,"I have a high view of Nissan. My dad came to me and asked whether he should get a Chevy Colorado or a Nissan Frontier. I steered him to the Nissan Frontier because I see those as extremely reliable. It’s a 4x4, had more features than the Colorado, and cost less. 

The Nissan Frontier is basically a mid-2000s truck. It isn’t sleek. It isn’t fancy. It isn’t efficient. But I’ve seen people driving those well past 300,000 miles with no issue. It gets him where he needs to go, won’t slip in mud, and hauls stuff with the best of them. It’s a modern day old school truck. If you want the fancy new technology, look elsewhere. 

In all honesty, I’m fairly surprised to see the negative opinion about Nissan. Sure, the 370z is a total ripoff at this point. But I really like the rest of their lineup."
