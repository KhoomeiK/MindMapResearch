AMA,fffds5x,t1_fffcpvq,1579881742.0,"If you don’t think the arts are worthy of higher education, then I dare you to go even a month without using anything developed by an artist. No movies, no tv shows, no Spotify, no music, no iPhone, no furniture in your house, no clothes. Who do you think made your favorite Disney movie? A bunch of people doodling on their lunch break at their job as an “engineer or someone in finance”? No... those are professionals. Life would be really boring without the arts, and it isn’t the Renaissance where an apprenticeship will cut it. 

No regrets in taking those loans out for my education. I would rather off myself than work a 9-5 job at a desk the rest of my life. I’ll take the gig economy any day."

2) Visualize your mom telling you “we got food at home” every time you think about swiping your card for a $20 meal.

I explained briefly what I’m dealing with right now and he said he totally understands (great sign that he’s not pushing me). I made it really clear that we’re just enjoying each other’s company right now since it wouldn’t be fair to either of us to start talking labels yet.

COCSA,ffa1y5z,t3_esakfw,1579726254.0,"Sorry about this happening. I think the reason why those actions that aren’t normally wrong for parents to do (bathing, wiping) can definitely be a trigger is just because of the mere nature of crossing boundaries and knowing when in time things become inappropriate. 

There’s a weird threshold for where certain actions get passes because of our age, and that’s a weird part about surviving COCSA. We were abused in the same physical places that sometimes adults can get away with touching themselves (wiping your child, bathing them) and that’s a really triggering experience if those are the same spots someone took advantage of"

Once art gets past the thousands, it’s definitely like buying a car or any other expensive purchase- you can for sure negotiate and talking to the artist may really help with that. Not necessarily from a bargain standpoint but knowing the authenticity, etc. 

I do suggest you make sure the piece is made of materials that will LAST! This may end up being a family heirloom one day, so make sure to take care of it as needed.

Pratt,fe2z2lm,t1_fe2x8vp,1578844418.0,"I had a very different experience because I actually went to the PrattMWP campus first. Look into that. It’s cheaper for the first two years if you go to that campus in upstate. 

So I’m a junior now and I live in the dorms. I feel like I can’t really give you an honest opinion about your freshman year experience because I didn’t have mine at this same campus. I’m at the point in college where the campus experience isn’t really why I’m here, I’m just trying to go to class and get out tbh. I love it but I’m not interested in making new friends and stuff right now. Lol. 

There’s lots of events to make friends at, there’s many clubs to join, I highly suggest stalking people on social media like Instagram and DMing them and asking about their experiences. I promise it’s not weird, I’ve had it happen to me a few times and I did it myself too. Look under the pratt hashtag. 

Party scene is dead because you’re in nyc. Nobody wants to party at a dorm when you can go to manhattan."
Pratt,fe2w5c8,t3_enmcph,1578843498.0,"Ok, so, here is a very long explanation in short because you really should contact the registrar for this question for the in depth response:

- No mixing of schools.... sometimes. If you’re in the school of fine art, its very difficult to wiggle your way into taking, let’s say an architecture class or communications (we call it COMD here). It can be done though, I’ve managed to get my way into an industrial design course by emailing the professor and having them agree to letting me take it, etc. So, not impossible, but just know that they definitely don’t *want* you to do this. There is enough variety in the programs though anyways, tbh. 

- everyone is granted ONE “all institute elective” before graduation, and it’s required. Meaning you do get one free pass to take any damn class on this campus but it’s not a normal occurrence. Note that this is great, unless let’s say you really want to take a specific kind of course that requires a prerequisite. That happened to me when I wanted to take a fashion course but I hadn’t taken the one before it so I didn’t qualify. 

- that being said... here’s the important part... you mentioned that you’re really interested in hopping around and taking multiple kinds of classes, like a science course and an English and a ceramic. Well, good news for you, that’s literally required. I’m in the fine arts department, and you’re required to take a science or math class before graduation. You also have to take a few different kinds of “humanities” classes, they’re often very strange and specific but are kinda like an English class. I think I’ve taken three or four of those. You’re also required to take three “technical” courses, like ceramics here where it’s about skill not concept. 

If you’re looking to come to this school because you want variety, this is the school for you, because it’s not only encouraged - it’s enforced."
AskNYC,fe2p4xe,t1_fe071u9,1578841347.0,"Well honestly this person has a point that I forgot to address, downvoters. 

It’s ok as long as you make it go away ASAP. I know it’s not magic, you can’t just snap your fingers and let it deflate, but it’s a freakin art class we get it. The wind could blow and then suddenly the dude gets hard or something. 

ON THAT NOTE, ABSOLUTELY NO FLIRTING OR EVEN TALKING TO THE STUDENTS! This will get you banned from the class!"

AskNYC,fe05d4u,t1_fdzzut8,1578803453.0,"I’m sure every place is different. But where I modeled (and btw im an art student at an art school in the city so I’ve seen hundreds of models) they want : 
- make sure you can hold a pose. 
- have some variety. I would pace mine out. It’s a lot like yoga tbh. I would do some sitting down with one leg across the other, then stand up and have one leg out front, then another laying down, etc etc. just pick like 10 poses and then alternate which direction you’re facing and then bam you’re set. 
- bring a robe for when there’s a break and you can get water / bathroom if needed. 
- don’t worry about your age or body size. They want variety and don’t give a shit. It has a lot more to do with learning how to draw what’s right in front of you and nothing to do with looks. Don’t worry about shaving, but definitely don’t show up after going to the gym or something ya know."
