WatchPeopleDieInside,fffqcz9,t1_fffld94,1579889514.0,"Nope. And even if it was, you’re arguing here to make it “optimal” for phone users, who can easily view horizontal videos full screen as well as vertical, and leaving out anyone who’s not on a phone. Not to mention that, however you’re viewing it, capturing 98% of life is better in landscape. It just is. Your eyes are laid out in landscape. Movies and tv are shown in landscape. Action typically moves left and right. There are a few instances where vertical video is better to catch more of what’s going on, like a tall building, something having to do with vertical viewing. But if the phone is having to be moved left and right held vertically to continually see what’s happening, which it does in situations like this and most everything else, then it shouldn’t be shot that way. The problem is this is now most people’s default mode of recording because of no other reason than it’s the most comfortable way of holding your phone. It’s pure laziness. Which is why it’s so fucking stupid, and you defending it is stupid. Start watching your fucking movies and tv in vertical with all the sides cut off if you think it’s so superior. You won’t."
