In this instance - absolutely. Remember, the key factor here is the complete lack of a policy - not the fact that they are implementing a BF (which is utilising historic data). Had there been a sickness / absence policy in place for the full 12 months of data used - then this would be a moot discussion - the OP would have been in breach of their terms of employment by taking more absences than allowed by their company policy and that would be that. Because there ***was no policy*** \- retrospectively applying a new policy is total bullocks.  


>I see it as follows slight gray area, after an employee has murdered several crows, (note that murdering crows is legal) but on jan 1, crows are now classified as human, are we to forgive the crow murderers even though there is clear evidence that these murders took place? It’s a gray area but if there has never been a policy and now there is, I rule in favour of the company. 

  
Except it isn't a gray area. The whole notion of Legality is defined by a law or policy that outlines that offence. If murdering crows is legal in December - there is nothing to ""forgive"" come January. This is the exact reason why laws are very rarely directed to be applied ex post facto (retroactively)."

>  
>***On the same day myself and another colleague were given letters inviting us to said interviews***, dated the same date as the email, because we had had absences totally more than 50.

This is the first stage of dealing with poor performance - this is not a ""quick, informal chat"" - this is a ***formal meeting by written invitation*** and an indication that the company intends to pursue formal disciplinary procedures.  


>An absence or a series of absences is still an absence, the calculation of when that becomes of interest isn't relevant in OPs circumstances. Drawing a parallel between OPs situation and retroactive legislation misses significant nuance. 

Except, a series of absences without rules about acceptable levels of attendance is just an absence - it is not actionable in any way beyond the employers duty to the employee's capability. Again, in terms of capability assessment - ACAS are explicit on the requirement:

&#x200B;

>The business can us whatever policy they want to review sickness data and they can do whatever they want to have an informal chat/review when whatever scores they've decided reach the point they want to review them.

The business can use whatever policy they want ***FROM TODAY ONWARDS.*** You cannot retroactively enforce a new expectation of performance - not least, because ACAS procedures state that disciplinary action has to be taken ""without delay"" - the employee in this case could have had all of their egregious absences as long as 11 months ago. The company has known the number of instances / occurrences for a period of time and not acted upon it (due to there being no policy under which to act)."

Businesses change policies all the time to make things more consistent - that's completely irrelevant to this situation. Any employee from here on in that fails to conform to the expected standards (as laid out in the companies sickness policy) is, of course, subject to disciplinary action - you cannot, however, expect people to adhere to rules that didn't exist.

That's not entirely true.  
You cannot retrospectively enforce a policy in this manner. ACAS covers this in no uncertain terms - all disciplinary procedures must be fair and reasonable:  


>2. Fairness and transparency are promoted by developing and using rules and procedures for handling disciplinary and grievance situations. These should be set down in writing, be specific and clear. Employees and, where appropriate, their representatives should be involved in the development of rules and procedures. It is also important to help employees and managers understand what the rules and procedures are, where they can be found and how they are to be used.

To be considered misconduct - there has to be proof that a rule was broken at the time of the alleged offence(s). To be considered as poor performance - there has to be a clear definition of expected performance. This is usually laid out in the company's appropriate Disciplinary Guidance / Employee Handbook / Sickness Policy (or similar). Showing up to a tribunal with a document dated ""Jan 2020"" for alleged misconduct/performance-related offences that happened in 2019 is a good way to get laughed out of a tribunal."

This guy is in his 50s and unable to work because of a severe disability. Not only did the NHS administer life saving treatment (that he could never have afforded), but the state also provide extensive, ongoing support in the way of carers allowance for his wife, adaptations for their home, disability living allowance for this guy. As well as that, he has a mobility car (ie a car paid for by the state to aid in freedom of transportation), not to mention ongoing medical checkups / DRs appointments etc. I was literally dumbfounded and had to leave before I scuffed my chin on the floor!!"
