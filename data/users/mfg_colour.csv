Which led to Marc Crawford being fired because Avery spoke out about being kicked. Leading to Daniel Carcillo alleging that Darryl Sutter was abusive in the WHL and that others had spoken to him about abuse by the Sutters. Which then lead to a hotline for players to anonymously report abuses. Dallas fired their coach which people believed related to that but Dallas came out and said it wasn't. Potentially Vegas fire their coach because they're in a slump and see how coaching changes effected Leafs and Flames but that's just assuming
