I have a nostalgic soft spot for Andrew McCarthy as well. Ha."
movies,ffgzf46,t1_ffgwqs5,1579919018.0,"I like this and am going to just imagine a 4th poltergeist film with an adult Danny and Carol Anne meeting and having a daughter or son with whom a malevolent force wishes to consume and they must protect her/him.

And combined they will ""shine the light"" and destroy it."
movies,ffgz5q1,t1_ffgy41z,1579918822.0,"I do like the Castle Rock series, but those aren't exactly Stephen King stories (it's characters and the setting if that's my understanding,  but it isn't like Needful Things getting made it's an amalgam of king?) and I thought It Chapter One would be a good start,  but sadly,  Chapter Two and the new Pet Cemetery kinda blew it for me... and Doctor Sleep feels like a different place altogether, but that is just my opinion. 

I am actually interested in The Stand mini series... but I want a slow burn 4 hour movie. Ha."
movies,ffgrx5m,t1_ffgmvx0,1579913506.0,"In part 2, the other side, the grandma asks Carol Anne to get yarn, and Carol Anne, without looking chooses each color. Later, the grandmother and Diane (Carol Anne's mother) have a brief conversation about how she's gifted, but the mother wants her to be normal.

Later that night, Carol Anne wakes up just around the time her grandmother dies, kissing her on the head - goes back into her room and has a short phone call with her ghost. With these two instances I kinda concluded she had intuition of some sort.

Also earlier in the day, in Poltergeist II, she sees Kane pass through people ( either as a phantom or apparition which noone else notices) he does manifest and the mother does see him, but she could see him before that.

It always seemed like she could communicate with the dead unlike anyone else in the family... ""they're here"" and such.

And with that she may be more akin to Cole in Sixth Sense,  then Danny -"
movies,feg1mme,t1_fedgn7m,1579073045.0,Absolutely agree.
movies,fedbfgs,t1_fed95sp,1579006591.0,"Every movie you listed are classics for sure... what did you think of Upgrade?

My favorite scene.

movies,fedas6w,t1_fed8vpj,1579005973.0,"I agree,  but let me be specific.  I love Pitch Black and Riddick (2013) - they could have him land on planet after planet fighting various creatures and I'd watch all of them. I did check-out on the triple XxX? movie (lold when he was jumping fences in the dirt bike) fell asleep during A Man Apart... I had a point. 

Vin!"
offmychest,fed9r90,t1_fed767q,1579004951.0,"My mum to a tee. I don't want to throw hate on her,  but it has made everything in my life seem trivial no matter what ... girlfriend cheats on me with my best friend,  ""well your dad cheated on me. "" ... doc says I have high blood pressure and that stress is a factor... ""what do you have to be stressed about?"" ...this is years ago though,  I've since learned just to keep everything to myself (outside of reddit, clearly) smile and say,  ""everything is fine,"" which after saying it long enough makes it so. No complaints,  just contributing. 

And to the OP I kind of agree,  but my coping mechanism was to physically and emotionally distance myself from the people in my past; that can be isolating (I'm cognizant that everyone is different) but it works for me I just dedicate my energy to work instead of dwelling on abuse and memories. 

Harumph though,  harumph I say."
offmychest,fed89wi,t1_fed6fjt,1579003389.0,"If I can,  I quit after about 18 years and it's now 4am and im still wired. Herbal soothing tea,  No caffeine, work out (to try to wear myself out) and still,  I just have to wait until my brain shuts off... for me,  it has not been easy.  Trying to give it time. One huge bowl calls to me,  but just fighting it...

I do try to tell my mind to sleep over and over again.  I swear it has worked a few times."
offmychest,fed7yyd,t3_eoewmf,1579003038.0,"Congrats and continue forth!

Im on this journey as well.  Stopped after Thanksgiving after years of being behind the haze. Libido is back,  talking to women again,  dreams back (horrific/ tremendously visceral/ good)  enjoying games and vr in different ways. I still can't sleep,  but I figure in due time I'll find a rhythm without herb.  Blah.

More to the point,  Hope you keep it up."
offmychest,fed7lfg,t1_fe6k64s,1579002593.0,"Thanks for the words. Moreover I've found that it's hard to get deep with people,  like I really want to care about ""you,""  but I want a two way road.

Interpersonal relationship/ friendships have always been difficult for me. Either giving too much too early or withdrawing when I should be advancing.  The ebb and flow is tiring,  can't we just be in the boat together.  Ha."
offmychest,fe638y4,t3_enrwa2,1578880790.0,"You're not the only one. 

If I can,  I felt this hard when one of my dads died out of the blue of a massive heart attack; I was at lunch with ""friends"" and got the call,  to wit, nobody said sorry or offered any support we just kinda finished lunch and they kept talking about whatever. 

I remember giving more time and attention to their dogs after they had gotten in a fight and I just couldn't let go of it so I've distanced myself from them and almost anyone who didn't say,  ""sorry your dad died."" I may reflect differently on it later,  but I'm still irked by it. 

Not a sob story just contributing to feeling like a side character or meaning less to people."
CHSinfo,f91vz7n,t3_e2azny,1575003037.0,"Hi all, I also took the water bottle in the shower - and afterwords just sat on the tub and sipped a quart of water. Honestly,  I'm so glad I found this page,  I thought it was so many different things, but three days into it (I kept smoking each night to fall asleep until tonight as I wasn't even aware of chs) I've decided to quit.  This has been plaguing me for years and it's a miserable waste of time. I hope you can find a solution."
