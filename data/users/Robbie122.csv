AmItheAsshole,ffcqoh7,t1_ffcn1yu,1579805238.0,"Well it's in his employment contract with OP, which he would have access to review at any time if he didn't have a personal copy. So he should know the stipulations for severance pay (plenty of workers in america know this info on their agreement with their employer) there is no obligation for OP to remind him of this when it should be the employee's responsibility to know his own contract.  and so why would OP go out of his way to be kind and remind someone else to benefit them after they just verbally assaulted and disrespected OP and would also be at the expense of OP?"
AmItheAsshole,ffchwv1,t1_ffcf4i7,1579799824.0,"See I fail to see how he 'took advantage' of his employee, for all we know his employee could've known he'd loose his severance package but was too proud to let that happen (plenty of blue collar guys are like this). OP had knowledge of the situation in which money would either go to him or his employee, if the employee had asked him about a severance condition and OP lied then OP would clearly be in the wrong, but aside from that OP is not obligated to advise the employee on which course of action would be most advantageous for them.  The employee should have access to his contract and details through his employer(OP) at all times, and should understand their duties/responsibilities and compensation, it's not on the employer to make sure, aside from initially signing the employment contract, their employee is constantly reminded of what's in their contract.  So with that said the only reason someone would go the extra effort to inform this of the information they should already know is if they're being kind, and at least in American if you personally insult, disrespect, and attack someone they will not reciprocate by going out of their own way and at their expense for your personal interests."

AmItheAsshole,ffcbkiy,t1_ffbwmm1,1579795904.0,"How is it being a capitalist move a bad thing? Dude is a small business owner, small amount of money can make much more of a difference than a huge corporation who can lose a grand or two.  If he can save money where he can he absolutely should as long as it isn't against the law or crossing any serious moral boundaries. That employee verbally assaulted him, insulting the other employees, and clients and has no excuse for that.  'oh well he was getting fired' is not an excuse, and the owner is under no moral obligation to be kind to someone and giving them information about how to make a few grand, at his own expense, especially after being treated with such disrespect.  Just because you lose your job doesn't give you free reign to shit on people, much less expect to be treated with kindness in return.  If you bought someone a gift, but were an hour late to dinner so they were being an asshole to you all night, then you decided not to give it to them.  They didn't know you bought a gift, but you already bought it and it was expensive, does that make you an asshole for not giving it to them?"
vegancirclejerk,ff8wrsy,t1_ff849ic,1579698638.0,"And what if I were to tell you by not using this product more fish would actually die vs using the product.  Because by using the product, or supporting it, there would be less plastic in the environment harming/killing wildlife. so while that fish died at the fishery, that fish being dead won't change since the fish meat industry isn't going anywhere, you were able to save the lives of other animals by utilizing the waste of a death that was inevitable whether or not you were involved in the process or not."
vegancirclejerk,ff81vgb,t1_ff6z5lp,1579663806.0,"Look at it this way, either way that fish is dead and that isn't changing, it didn't die to be turned into plastic despite what every one else is saying I explained why it wouldn't be the case.  By not using this plastic alternative more polymer based plastic will be in the ocean, thus impacting the environment and killing more wildlife.  In one situation one fish dies, in the latter more die because the chance to reduce plastic wasn't taken.  And you can say that the best thing to do is use less plastic and use paper instead which is a nice sentiment in an online discussion but is a total pipe dream in practice.  The intention to use the alternative plastic is for single use plastics in packaging, when you purchase a product outside of produce the consumer doesn't have a choice in how it's packaged.  So it all boils down to a numbers game, the amount of fish killed for food won't change but will change is fish killed by plastic, the result is an overall decrease in death of animals which is the goal right?"
vegancirclejerk,ff80c3c,t1_ff7lo3i,1579662690.0,"Well then buying fertilizer made from animal manure isn't vegan and shouldn't be used in farming because it's an animal byproduct therefore morally reprehensible.  Whether or not this alternative plastic method becomes popular the fishing industry will continue to exist and so will that waste.  Which leaves two options it either gets sold to fish meal producers which sell it as feed to the meat industry or it gets dumped into the ocean/rivers polluting the environment.  Both are negative outcomes, while this method offers mainly positive and the only negative is that maybe it'll be SOOO profitable that companies will have to kill more fish because everyone is greedy which is entirely just conjecture with no factual basis to support this claim regarding this specific alternative to plastic."
vegancirclejerk,ff6rq7p,t1_ff6fiph,1579633495.0,"Doubtful, the costs of operating the farm have to be outweighed by their profit. The production of the 'plastic' itself is pretty cheap, not only that but yields a pretty significant amount from one carcass (14,000 bags).  Also only a certain amount of the carcass is used (amino acids in the scales and skin) so a plastic producer paying the cost of what a whole farm raised fish is vs what they will make of off the yielded 'plastic' is definitely too expensive.  The entire industry would have to switch over and source their raw materials for plastic production to solely from fish for the demand necessitating industrial farming operations."
vegancirclejerk,ff6qewk,t1_ff6cwft,1579632715.0,"Well it's use is to be intended for single use plastics, like in packaging which consumers don't get to choose paper or plastic since the choice happens at production facilities.  Also incentive for profit off of the waste is based entirely on economics.  The demand for fish waste has to be higher than the demand for fish meat by the food industry, otherwise if they expanded fishing operations just for the waste they'd be losing money because of the excess meat from expanded operations would drive the market rate for their fish meat down and the waste is going to almost always be cheaper than the meat they sell. 1 yellowfin tuna makes 14,000 plastic bags, process is efficient and the waste is cheap. They would only expand operations if it was lucrative enough, but by that point plastic producers wouldn't bother because conventional plastic production would be cheaper."
vegancirclejerk,ff6mccu,t1_ff6cwwd,1579630263.0,"Well that's sort of the point of recycling/reuse and circular economics, it's waste if its not used but then it's not waste if it's used for something, what's your point.  Instead of dumping tons of blood and carcasses (which in large quantities act as pollution) into rivers and oceans you give it a purpose.  Reducing single use plastics in the environment and reducing or removing pollution from the fishing industry.  Just because it came from an animal doesn't negate its positive uses."

It's not like they're killing fish to make it, it's made from already existing fish waste.  The end product is also biodegradable that can be broken in a compost pile, unlike plastic that sits in the ocean for decades and just turns into microplastics.  Also it can be produced at a lower temp compared to plastic which would actually save energy.  Why don't you actually read up about it before immediately condemning something good as bad."

AskReddit,ff43sul,t1_ff3ywm2,1579554919.0,"Sure, the general view on sex per country can vary but even with your link the average partner count was 12, that is at minimum 88 less than what we're talking about, there's no real way to get a actual percentage of dudes who would be cool with it but I'm confident where i am at least 95% would not be chill with it. 

  
The main reason why most think it is gross is because of disease, people say if they're safe why does it matter, well the reality is most aren't.  because of things like dating apps the CDC has reported higher cases of STDs, and to think everyone ends up practicing safe sex is naive, and even then condoms break. I'm not you and I have no idea what your practices are, so having a higher chance of getting sick by having sex with a girl with a body count of 100+ is not attractive.  You can still transmit an infection before symptoms start showing

  
Feeling embarrassment isn't shaming either, that's not how embarrassment works. You don't really have control over things that bother you or things you feel shame about (unless you spend a lot of time changing your mind to think the opposite).  If it's something that makes them uncomfortable and they don't like it, you don't really get to say they shouldn't feel that way.  For me (and most people) that's a deal breaker and I wouldn't really want to pursue a relationship with someone who lacks any sort of standards that they don't care where intimacy comes from (that ends up being in a relationship constantly second guessing). If that's shaming them then I don't know what to tell you, we're friends or SO's with people based off the content of their actions so it's ridiculous say everyone should be accepting or agree with your lifestyle.  Look i'm not saying to go off bashing on someone who all they did was sleep with a lot of guys, I'm just saying that most people find that gross and unattractive in a partner (this goes both ways, guy or girl) people need to stop trying to be as liberal as possible and pretend something like this wouldn't bug them.  


And i'm with you on that, in middle school I was the same, and now I would definitely like to be with someone who has had past multiple partners. but 100+ people is extreme, somewhere around 20 is a good medium for someone in their mid-20's."

It's not shaming someone to think that sleeping with over 100 different people is gross and you wouldn't date them.  You're right that its doesn't physically harm anyone, but what someone does affects opinions and how people see them.  Did asshole things throughout your 20's, well people are gonna think you're an asshole.

And I did ask a very specific question, but you kinda answered a more ambiguous question I had about how us and China differ. And it’s relieving to hear there absolutely isn’t any, we all do the same shit, want the same shitty things, but just has two totally different governments."

The people are great here but this place feels like where hopes and dreams go to die and I do not want to be stuck here for another 30 - 40 year lol. but some of those downsides sounds brutal like no paid vacation or sicks, and a company stringing a dude a long and uprooting his family is brutal as hell.  Some of the direct hire companies i've seen that have rotational programs either hire from interns or want someone with a masters or better than a 3.0 which is exactly where I ended at."

The way girls hate getting called slutty is the same for dudes getting called creepy and especially in this me too era alot of guys I know are more cautious to approach random women out in public or outside of a bar setting in fear of getting called creepy.  And on top of that dudes love it when women initiate it takes the strain and fear of rejection off our back because women don't get rejected nearly as much as men. I hate cold opens, and I won't randomly hit on a stranger in public but I did end going on dates with someone that I was sitting next to after a casual conversation that just kinda happened organically."

AmItheAsshole,fdeaxbc,t1_fde3qhn,1578335036.0,"And it doesn't make it wrong because one person had an issue with it.  Have you ever been to a sporting event in America? throwing peanuts on the ground is not breaking the rules else everyone would get kicked out, it's only when someone makes a pretty bad mess or is being a dick about it.  Dude was already getting up and moving, OP was at a sporting event where people change seats and peanut shell tossing is the norm, and I doubt it was even more than a handful of shells being they were only gone for 15 mins."
jesuschristreddit,fddxdtd,t1_fddugp2,1578326291.0,"Shaming someone is not the same as telling them not do what they're doing, like if you ride around on bike without a helmet i'm gonna shame you and call you an idiot but i'm not gonna tell you that you can't do that. If you want to eat your own shit i'm going to be utterly disgusted and shame you but I won't tell that you can't do that. And you're right what someone's fetish is is none of my business unless they bring it up, once you've brought something up in a conversation it automatically becomes subject to opinion unless its factual in nature.  I think some kink shaming is justified, people masquerade some mental illness as a fetish and act like they're being oppressed.  shit like Writing and getting off to stories about raping women is not healthy, and is absolutely deserving of kink shaming.  Don't get me wrong i'm not saying all fetishes fall into this category, just mostly those fringe fetishes this sub has a great list of top posts from subreddits dedicated to this sexually deviant behavior."

I read accounts of terrorist camps being bombed and when the US soldiers rolled up the bodies had no sign of damage from shrapnel but were bleeding from the eyes/ears/mouth (sometimes their eyes exploded) and they said that some of the bombs concussive blast were so powerful it reached beyond the shrapnel range and would eviscerate their internal organs."

I figured entry level would be more difficult than say a AME with 10 years of experience, but time isn't a huge concern for me I've kinda set a goal to hopefully have a new job within the next 6 months.

AmItheAsshole,fddrib8,t1_fdd54a9,1578322079.0,"is it though? I've worked plenty of minimum wage jobs growing up and in college, and I am always considerate of any mess I make when out in public.  With that said it is a cultural norm in the US to to be able to throw your peanut shells on the ground at Logan's Roadhouse and Sporting events.  Don't pretend its not, i'm not saying covering nacho cheese all of the seats and getting popcorn everywhere is chill but peanuts are the exception.  On top of that unless this a place that strictly enforces seat number on the ticket policy and a vast majority of the time seats are just first come first serve then what do you expect. Like OP asked him to get up and immediately did, but then gets heated when there are peanut shells on the ground Like c'mon what do you expect literally everyone does this its not like this dude was just being the one rude asshole.  OP needed to chill but I wouldn't go as far as to say OP is an asshole."

Like I’m not gonna tell someone what they should or should not do but there are some fucked up kinks out there people should absolutely feel shameful about. Like one of the top posts here is from a subreddit where spraining you’re own ankle is a fetish, like holy fuck hurting yourself to get off is no ok.  And on top of that some fetish’s are a result of a mental illness and aren’t healthy, another good one is that hentai child/rape porn.  But again it’s your life and unless your breaking the law all I’ll say is it’s disgusting but won’t do anything to make sure you can’t do that."

WatchandLearn,fcylkdu,t1_fcydxgf,1578082249.0,"I think the biggest issue regarding oil (aside from how profitable it is for big business) would be the consumption by transportation.  You could have the power grid infrastructure still function as it does now with oil but only try to completely switch over our transportation infrastructure to electric. All the hundreds of millions of cars we drive to work and semi-trucks that deliver us goods would need heavy batteries/motors replace their gas tank and combustion engines (expensive to produce). Then there's the millions of planes/Cargo ships/shipping trains that get us places or bring us all those cheap goods we enjoy so much from china.  Even if we had the technology for each vehicle type and means to actually produce it how on earth would it get paid for to switch over to electric.  God I hope fusion becomes a thing, because this is going to take decades to switch to and at this rate we'll be past the tipping point by the time we do."
