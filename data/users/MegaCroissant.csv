The rainbow light is great, and I think you should utilize that with more rainbow bricks and more vibrant blocks (I.e: gemspark blocks, cobalt and gold bricks, etc) and try to vary the house design a bit, since they are all basic slopes roof wood and brick houses. Maybe a party bus in the background, like actuate it after building it, something like that. I love the effort though!"
