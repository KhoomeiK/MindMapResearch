survivinginfidelity,ffi1sa0,t1_ffi1aq1,1579962529.0,Thank you for this and the link. I'm journaling all of these really helpful suggestions and I dove right into Chump Lady. Wow. So much good stuff there along with the gray rock method.
Hashimotos,ffhznj8,t3_etj9jo,1579960493.0,"He had a months long emotional affair with a mutual friend behind my back and it is still going on to the best of my knowledge. He felt somewhat bad with how sick I've been and my recent dx, so he said he just wants me well again and we will deal with the other stuff later. 

So that's all nice."
survivinginfidelity,ffhzhvp,t1_ffhvryb,1579960335.0,Oh - and fuck you. I don't need help or income. I was doing great before he came along and will be fine without him too. Seriously GTFOH.
survivinginfidelity,ffhzdu9,t1_ffhynyd,1579960223.0,"He sees him accepting responsibility or changing as me trying to control him or limit his network/support. He has serious issues with what he perceives as authority. He even argues with his supervisors when they change the rules. 

He keeps saying how he is going to ""stand his ground"". Well, so am I. And having other women in my marriage in a way that makes me uncomfortable and violates my boundaries is a hard no from me."
survivinginfidelity,ffhz49o,t1_ffhvryb,1579959950.0,Maybe you should read my post again about what I've been doing to work on my own shit. And do my nails? What the fuck.
survivinginfidelity,ffhs6c4,t1_ffhjsan,1579951126.0,"Thank you for your kind words.

I've read about chumplady here and will check into more as a reading resource. Funny is that right after it happened and as I was considering confrontation, I journaled out what happened, how it made me feel, how it violated my boundaries, what I needed from him to be able to start moving forward or reconcile if we were going to do so, and what would happen  if he couldn't cut contact, etc. I have to write that stuff down so I don't forget or, as you said, lose clarity especially with my tendency for brain fog. It helped to write it all out. 

He just wants to be here because I'm sick I think. I don't think he cut contact. It feels awful. He doesn't think he did anything wrong and I'm bad for my boundaries."
