Then I'm afraid what I said before applies -- your source is a stack of cow feces. Because that's an unconditional truth, at least in comparison to open office setups. I don't generally place my faith in ""science"" that violates basic truths like this, and I recommend you don't either."

The fundamental truth is that real software engineering is at heart a craft that outright requires you to be able to concentrate, at least a portion of the time, and there's literally centuries of science behind the fact that the absolute best place to concentrate is a quiet place, where you are able to delve into something without being interrupted. There's mountains of science on how much being interrupted actually costs, in terms of getting back into your mental Jenga stack. 

Contrast this with a few people that cannot deal with just walking over and saying hi to someone when they need a human touch. It's not even a fair comparison, for an industry so dependent on the output of engineers."

None of them should have client based control over data that you can't lose or systems you need to be up. All of that should be on servers that you *can* lock down, and accessed through pipes that you can control. 

If you have a system that has critical client side components, then you don't have a secure system even in locked down boxes. You should be able to walk into Best Buy, hand it to an employee, let them work for a month on an *unmodified OS*, and then take that computer, logged out, and put it in the fucking DefCon conference and it should be fine. 

You *cannot* be truly productive in a lot of cases when you require a locked down environment to be ""secure"".
