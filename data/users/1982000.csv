By the end of 2 years working the door, chicks would come in wanting to be dancers, all fresh eyed and rosy. I had a headset and was on a monitor, so I'd have to talk really quietly. I'd say, Listen to me. I want you to turn around and walk away, and pretend you never saw this place. (Topless Club). So many girls came in thinking they'd make a few quick bucks and quit. A year later, they'd be onstage dancing, and their eyes would be dead. Didn't happen to all the girls, but too many for me to want to be a part of it."

opiates,fepe8wd,t1_fep4zfp,1579318337.0,"I've done it and been around it. It seems once people get a habit, they pretty much get super paranoid, miss work, and become obsessed with the drug. Personal health really gets neglected. I went to pick up a $25 bag from some friends I hadn't seen for awhile. They were full on gone. Guns everywhere, my friend thinking I was hitting on his girl. By day 3 (no sleep?)we were up in the mountains with an AK 47, an sks (chinese assault rifle) and an AR15, looking for gold. They had a sluice in their backyard, and it was gold country. We came upon a weekend miner, a normal guy, and I went up to reassure him we weren't gonna hurt him. That's when meth came to Albuquerque in the 80s. I hear there was a tv show about it. I left those guys and didn't buy any meth after that. I went and visited this guy 5 years ago, and a quarter mile from his house was the house used in breaking bad. I saw people using it before that, when I was a bouncer. It's way worse than sniffing dope imo, although I'm not around people who IV."
opiates,fepd04k,t1_fep7fcn,1579317493.0,"So true. The hyperbole and scare tactics that have been used for so long do nothing curb drug use. Once someone smokes pot and realizes it's a fairly benign drug, people wonder what other drugs have been overhyped as the devil's drug, or one that causes instant psychosis or even death. At that point, the anti-drug people lose all credibility."

Boxing,fepc5vy,t1_felsez3,1579316928.0,"I agree that there was something wrong with AJ and his ""equilibrium"". Wasn't he having some sort of medical problem? The knockdown from Klitschko seemed like a normal knockdown. I guess going forward, we'll have to see how he responds when he gets tagged. The fact that he couldn't KO the fat guy in his last fight really doesn't speak well for him. Did he not take risks? If you wanna be world champ, you have to be able to pressure and KO an out of shape specimen like that. If he was too fearful to get close, that doesn't speak well either."
Boxing,fepbch8,t1_feovep4,1579316379.0,"Are you saying that Fury should throw a right, or left uppercut? I appreciate a lot of what you say, but a left uppercut would be an uncommon and likely unsuccessful punch. Larry Holmes could throw a right uppercut from long range, but it's such a long, looping punch from a tall fighter that it would give Wilder a big opening to throw a left hook, the way Holyfield did when he knocked out a taller Buster Douglas. Seeing how well timed Wilder threw the right when knocking out Spilka, I can't get behind that."
OpiateChurch,felu6l7,t3_epslkv,1579231027.0,"I always enjoyed when I could go down to the hood and buy a little this and a little that and build up a collection like this. Pharma drugs are always consistent in effect, and having a choice is so much more fun than only being able to get one thing. Then you can take them according to mood. And street dope is rarely the same. I tell you, kids, doing this in the 80s and 90s was so much fun. Percs and Vicodins were like 2 or 3 bucks. $10 for 100mg. Morphine. Hell, you could go to people's houses and grab a pill or two from the bathroom, because people had them. My friends dad had a heart attack, and they gave him a jug of 500 valiums. Every once in a while, if we were doing coke, we'd grab a few. He lived another 30 years at least. Ya missed it, kids. Don't even get me started on ludes. Variety was the spice of life!"

His ""comeback "" was hyped like hell on network TV, and Leanord looked horrible. He was knocked flat on his ass in the fourth(?). Leanord's face reddened with embarassment. In the ring, after the fight, he said he'd lost his skills, and officially retire again. Considering Marvin was present when he announced his first retirement in like '81or '82, and was visibly disappointed when Leanord announced his retirement the first time, the fight had been heavily a anticipated for 5 or 6 years. Leanord at that time was working on the theory that he could only get motivated for ""the big fights"". If it had happened in 83, no doubt that the outcome would have different"

Hagler was expected to win, but Leanord bargained for a huge 22 foot ring and a 12 instead of 15 round fight. Finally, Hagler had been through some wars, especially against John ""The Beast"" Mugabi 11 months earlier. Hagler won by kayo, but he was really damaged by that fight."
