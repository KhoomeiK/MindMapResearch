wholesomememes,ff4kgh2,t3_erigyr,1579565782.0,The past 7 years I became pretty numb to life after my best friend died. Like I would have bouts where I felt borderline robotic. Had a daughter over a year ago and I’m getting all emotional all the time now and I hate it. But at the same time I love it and know it’s probably good for me. I feel human again.

instant_regret,ff2i99w,t1_ff29sf1,1579507307.0,When I was in elementary school at recess we would play “traffic jam” where you have someone block the end of an enclosed slide then fill it to the top with your fellow classmates. You got out when the person blocking the end decided to let everyone out. That’s when I realized I was claustrophobic.

unpopularopinion,ff22sw8,t3_er1syq,1579492258.0,"I guess because I’ve never been severely betrayed by an animal before and have only been shown affection by my pets. I know wild animals wouldn’t hesitate to kill me without hesitation but I’m sure that’s where the bias comes from. 

One example of why I think humans suck for those interested:

I had a “friend” I was let staying at my house and feeding because his mom kicked him out for failing a drug test for hard drugs, brick my computer because I wouldn’t sell it to him (because he didn’t have the money at the time and would “pay me back” even though all his money went to drugs) after he upgraded it from 32 bit to 64 bit. My roommate I was also let staying at my place basically rent free for awhile that he was fucking told me; apparently I was the ungrateful one. The final straw was when he told his mom he was kidnapped and needed money sent to him and to not call the cops. Didn’t tell me about this at all. Well she called the cops and they pinged his phone and the next morning my house is surrounded. Fortunately I knew the Sgt. and I heard him yell my name to open the door. When I did he stepped in and asked me who I had in my house and I told him and the guy was sitting right on the couch and the Sgt. told me what was going on and they arrested him for having drugs on him but let him go later and didn’t press charges probably only because I know the Sgt. and he had the nerve to show up back at my house. 

I obviously don’t hate all people as I have some very good loyal friends that have always been there for me no matter what. I just don’t put my trust out there anymore."

She said she went to the store the other day to get season 8 but they were all out; she was thinking because it’s so popular but I’m guessing it’s because they barely stocked any in the first place."

educationalgifs,fdwoflk,t1_fctbxta,1578760839.0,I did some more research on various things and Sweden’s “restrictive” abortion laws are nothing like Romania and Brazil’s which is why they don’t have orphanages overran with unwanted children. And this isn’t one or two examples this is two countries full of examples of how outlawing abortion is a bad thing.
