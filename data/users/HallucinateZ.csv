natureismetal,ff9bgx3,t1_ff9ae1s,1579709161.0,"Joke went right over his head because he's so focused on how sad nature is in his eyes when it can be truly beautiful. I could go on but there's not a twinkle of hope or happiness in any of his replies.

I wasn't even that serious lmao but since you asked, I can highlight some things that made me say that."

I thought I knew what to expect with that username but truly, I did not."
trashy,fehrdt7,t1_fehqbgs,1579122360.0,That doesn't make sense because she returned and finished the show.
trashy,fehpzhm,t1_fehpo0e,1579121559.0,I see that lol it should be the main headline.

funny,fdvb5ht,t1_fdv740q,1578745517.0,"I'm glad he knew how far to push it and only gave out 243 packets. He's my hero. That's like asking for extra mayo and the guy ejaculating in it. It's just so much extra, and it's worth a promotion."
PublicFreakout,fdjgplc,t1_fdjfuk6,1578470045.0,"Because it was super easy for most of us to watch that woman assault someone, get smacked and fake faint while trying to claim insurance. 
She's old, but she's scum.

Edit: I wanna add that that smack she received could NOT have hurt much if she had time to mentally plan out her fake fall. Seconds after impact."

Instagramreality,fdar93f,t1_fdage43,1578249201.0,"Let's not police random people online that didn't even judge from pics alone, nor did they outright say it was true, just speculation due to how often she posts about her life. There's a point where someone is so open that it isn't hard to form an opinion.

Edit: forgot a ""to"""
PrequelMemes,fdaj5sr,t1_fdai3fl,1578246629.0,"Yeah that's what I meant when I mentioned the sand people slaughtering. If you were looking for details towards him turning into Darth Vader (I mean, we all were), they're littered around AoTC but it's not very clear. His mother dying is the most obvious dark side moment along with his lack of impulse control in that movie, I'd say. It's been a while since I watched it though."

Damnthatsinteresting,fdab6rk,t1_fda6577,1578244001.0,I wouldn't give Cats anything. That movie was the worst of 2019!
PrequelMemes,fdaaemn,t1_fda4q80,1578243658.0,"I agree. You'd think they'd show him moving towards the dark side more clearly throughout Attack of the Clones, but instead, halfway through Revenge of the Sith his actions drastically change. I know the slaughtering of the sand people showed he wasn't all light side but still, it was a single moment followed by smiles and Obi-wan and him joking around again. 
I feel that's why it's so jarring. You kinda expect him to freak out when his mother dies in his arms."
