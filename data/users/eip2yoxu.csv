They also seem to have acknowledged the issues and replaced the billboard and also said they did not mean to insult anyone.  
I mean it's still shitty, but that does not take away from what they have done for animals. I agree to criticise them whenever it is necessary (that billboard is a prime example), but they should also get credit where it's due.
I tried to find other offensive campaigns run by them and most were just models posing naked or comparing animal slaughter to the holocaust. While I can issues with that, I don't think they are as clearly uncalled for as the billboard you linked. 
So while they are indeed are povocative a lot of times (which is one of their goals) I don't think they cross the line that often, but that's subjective I guess"

After Europe was christianised many customs and 'religious' stories became folklore or were just added to Christianity (like christmas). Despite christian efforts to surpress or delete all traces of paganism, quite a few accounts (like the edda or reports of Roman writers/historians) survived which where used to revive the religion.

PETA is actually highly efficient in what they do. I hope I was able to give you a different perspective. 

PS: the dairy industry is disastrous for the animals. Cows suffer a lot. Males usually get killed 6-12 months after birth, while females are forcefully impregnated, have their babies take way from them within 24 hours so no milk gets wasted on them and then gets milked by machines. This cycle is repeated until the cow can't give anymore milk, which is the point when it gets slaughtered (often around 4 -6 years, a fraction of their actual lifespan)."

These are only a few of their victories, but this comment is already way too long:  

*1980*

* PETA’s first undercover investigation resulted in an end to crippling experiments on monkeys, the first-ever police raid on an animal-testing laboratory, the first animal experimentation case ever heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the first-ever prosecution and conviction of an animal experimenter on cruelty-to-animals charges. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver\_Spring\_monkeys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Spring_monkeys)
* A PETA undercover investigation results in the first conviction of an experimenter for animal abuse and the first withdrawal of federal research funds because of cruelty to animals
* PETA exposed and shut down the U.S. Army’s plan to shoot dogs at an indoor firing range, leading the military to ban the use of dogs, cats, and primates in wound experiments and training
* PETA gets a U.S. Department of Defense underground “wound lab” shut down and achieves a permanent ban on shooting dogs and cats in military wound laboratories
* PETA closes down a Texas slaughterhouse operation in which 30,000 horses were trucked in and left to starve in frozen fields without shelter
* After PETA publicizes the gross mistreatment of animals at City of Hope in California, the government suspends more than $1 million of the laboratory’s federal funding
* As a result of PETA’s campaign, the SEMA research laboratory in Maryland stops confining chimpanzees to isolation chambers
* PETA stops a plan by Cedars-Sinai, California’s largest hospital, to ship stray dogs from Mexico to California for experiments
* For the first time, PETA conducts a year-long undercover investigation at Biosearch, a cosmetics and household product testing laboratory, uncovering more than 100 violations of federal and state anti-cruelty laws
* PETA persuades Avon, Benetton, Mary Kay, Amway, Kenner, Mattel, and Hasbro to stop testing on animals. Note: Many of these companies have started testing on animals again in order to sell their products in China

*1990s*

* After PETA exposes the backstage beating of orangutans by Las Vegas entertainer Bobby Berosini, his wildlife permit is suspended and his show closes
* All car-crash tests on animals stop worldwide following PETA’s hard-hitting campaign against General Motors’ use of live pigs and ferrets in crash tests.
* A California furrier is charged with cruelty to animals after a PETA investigator films him electrocuting chinchillas by clipping wires to the animals’ genitals. In another undercover exposé, PETA catches a fur rancher on videotape causing minks to die in agony by injecting them with a weedkiller. Both fur farms agree to stop these cruel killing methods
* PETA persuades Mobil, Texaco, Pennzoil, Shell, and other oil companies to cover their exhaust stacks after showing how millions of birds and bats have become trapped in them and been burned to death
* PETA’s efforts lead to the first-ever cruelty charges filed against a factory farmer for cruelty to chickens for allowing tens of thousands of chickens to starve to death. The president of the company ultimately pleads guilty
* Following PETA’s campaign, NASA pulls out of Bion—a joint U.S., French, and Russian experiment in which monkeys wearing straitjackets were to have electrodes implanted in their bodies and be launched into space
* A PETA investigation that documented the anal electrocution of foxes leads to the first-ever guilty plea by a fur rancher to cruelty-to-animals charges
* PETA succeeds in getting Taiwan to pass its first-ever law against cruelty to animals after the group rescues countless dogs from being beaten, starved, electrocuted, and drowned in Taiwan’s pounds
* PETA conducts an undercover investigation into the Nielsen Farmspuppy mill in Kansas, which reveals extremely small enclosures and rampant sickness, abuse, and death. Our investigation leads to the closure of the facility and a $20,000 fine from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Nielsens are also “permanently disqualified from being licensed” by the USDA
* PETA’s grassroots campaign, Congressional testimony, and scientific documentation drivethe White House and the EPA to spare 800,000 animals from chemical toxicity testing in the high production volume chemical-testing program"
NoStupidQuestions,fedi8t6,t3_eodxwr,1579012201.0,"I guess this a somewhat different perspective to the other comments, but I heard different opinions make a discussion healthy lol.

I will not just try to answer your question, but also elaborate on PETA as an organization, because I feel they get more hate than they deserve. That means this will become a long chain of comments, as there is not real tldr version that does the subject justice. I also encourage everyone to do their own research and especially to check their sources.

**What’s PETAs agenda?** 

Their slogan is ""Animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way."" and it's what describes their work more than anything else imo. PETA is an animals' rights organization, which means they advocate for animals to have basic rights because animals can demand them themselves, obviously. A lot of people confuse that with demanding the same rights as humans for animals, but that is not true. They want animals to have the right to live free, without being (intentionally) harmed in any possible way. In their opinion animals should not be prodcuts either. To achieve their goals they resort to various forms of protests which sometimes can be quite bizarre. Even though those actions seem extreme, they help PETA to catch the public's attention and help to spread awareness about issues. 

Of course this pisses off companies and organizations targeted by PETA, which funded and still fund websites like [petakillsanimals.com](https://petakillsanimals.com) and other smear campaigns against PETA through organizations like the ""Center for Consumer Freedom"". The CFCF is  a morally bankrupt organisation that lobbies the government on behalf of tobacco, alcohol, and fast and junk food manufacturers to do things like lobby against blood alcohol limits and cigarette taxes.  Their biggest point usually draws from PETA's feral pet control and euthanasia programs, whcih gets us to the next point:

**Why does PETA kill animals?**

Since PETA is one of the more transparent shelter operates, there are pretty precise numbers about the animals they killed. They total up to  30,000-40,000 animals over the 30+ years they have been operating, which is in recent years about 70% of the animals they take in. Now this looks fucking horrific and it is, but the number often gets protrayed wrong, because people are often either naive or uninformed and don't know how shelters work in the US. Basically there are three types of shelters:

1. Kill shelters, which will generally accept any animal, but when they reach maximum capacity, they will euthenize undesired animals to make room for potentially adoptable ones.
2. ""No kill shelters"" that either give their overflow to #1 or outsource their killing. They're exactly the same as #1 in terms of operation, but get a nice-sounding name despite the fact that the execution firms they use do things as ""efficiently"" as possible (ie gas chambers).
3. Actual No kill shelters that truly don't kill animals, except, by effect, the ones they turn down because they're typically very thorough about rejecting the type of animals that #1 and #2 will euthenize, which is exactly where they go after rejection. They do so no knowing fully that it's a death sentence

 The harsh truth no one wants to hear is that we systemically fail our pets, which we claim to love and abandon/surrender more than we adopt every single year. No matter how many donations and how much funding we provide, no matter how many sanctuaries we create for undesired pets, there's an obvious problem around the corner you'll see if you do the math. So what does PETA do? PETA takes in and euthanizes the 'hopeless cases' of animals which are suffering due to abuse or medical problems or are unadoptable due to behavioral problems (mostly agressiveness). These are animals that ""no kill"" shelters reject and refuse to house. PETA takes the position that it is better for them to have a clean, merciful death than to suffer further. PETA also offers free euthanasia for pet owners who cannot afford a vet to do so.

Think what you will about the ethics of running a 'kill shelter', but there's an unavoidable problem of the number of pet animals born into the world and not adopted by responsible people. There simply aren't infinite housing and care resources for a forever-expanding number of pets. The best solution would be for these animals never to be born in the first place, but not everyone does the responsible thing of neutering their pets, and people insist on having specially-bred pets, which requires breeders to produce far more than people can reasonably adopt."

While fire can travel up to 22km/h in grassland and a grown kangaroo can travel at about 40km/h for about 2km, their comfortable hopping speed is 20-25km/h. Considering this kangaroo is still young, I assume it would not have made it without the fence and even grown kangaroos don't escape  the flames unless they make it to a save spot, before they get exhausted."

This happened in a neighbouring city, Krefeld.
A lot of  people already offered to support the zoo.      
 
Apart from Massa, the silverback gorilla, chimpanzees, orang-utans, birds and fruit bats died in the fire. It most likely happened because of a sky lantern which is illegal in almost all German states.   
    
The zoo will keep closed because the employees are still devastated"
