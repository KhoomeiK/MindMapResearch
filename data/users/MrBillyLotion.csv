Gates played for them and absolutely destroyed our team pretty much single handed.  He wasn’t built like a basketball player and was shorter than most of the other players, but he controlled the game from start to finish.  I remember the first time seeing him in the NFL and calling my buddy to confirm it was the same guy we saw balling his ass off.  Dude is a professional athlete for sure."
