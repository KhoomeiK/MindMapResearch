You’re acting on faith for all three, but those are what you commit to them before their mettle can be tested. I bring up Sudo because they don’t need as much to get in, but they’re iOS only so android users will be limited to the others. Personally, I’d not be too happy with either but Wire would be my choice because it’s easier to fake an email than a phone number. Both signal and wire have bad reviews on the app stores and can be not picked so they really are spit and gum solutions for an in person conversation."

He gets into free will, inadequacies of language, spirituality without religion. Altogether, I think it’s the most important book I’ve read and I still have to reread it. I’d give up an awful lot to have been there for his lectures. Here’s a passage that I’ve shared here once before:


We must here make a clear distinction between belief and faith, because, in general practice, belief has come to mean a state of mind which is almost the opposite of faith. Belief, as I use the word here, is the insistence that the truth is what one would “lief” or wish it to be. The believer will open his mind to the truth on the condition that it fits in with his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be. Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go. In this sense of the word, faith is the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any religion that is not self-deception.

[…]

The present phase of human thought and history … almost compels us to face reality with open minds, and you can only know God through an open mind just as you can only see the sky through a clear window. You will not see the sky if you have covered the glass with blue paint.

But “religious” people who resist the scraping of the paint from the glass, who regard the scientific attitude with fear and mistrust, and confuse faith with clinging to certain ideas, are curiously ignorant of laws of the spiritual life which they might find in their own traditional records. A careful study of comparative religion and spiritual philosophy reveals that abandonment of belief, of any clinging to a future life for one’s own, and of any attempt to escape from finitude and mortality, is a regular and normal stage in the way of the spirit. Indeed, this is actually such a “first principle” of the spiritual life that it should have been obvious from the beginning, and it seems, after all, surprising that learned theologians should adopt anything but a cooperative attitude towards the critical philosophy of science."
entp,fe4cf52,t1_fe45o0e,1578857819.0,"If you want to become a surgeon, let’s say, an orthopedic surgeon, you have to do several things. 

Firstly you’re getting into med school. That involves letters of recommendation, great grades, and recent shadowing time. All of those demands that you know the right people and are capable of building up reasons to qualify for their attention. After that, you have to do it all over again for your residency. Ortho is very competitive. And thennn you should probably do a fellowship so you can make the big boy money. Which is again more qualifying. Learning how to make *good* music isn’t luck. And doing more than just “putting yourself out there” isn’t luck either.  Luck has a role in being a surgeon because you just might not get picked. There are only so many seats and you might’ve been competing against a Harvard graduate. But that doesn’t mean that you give up because there might be someone else to take your seat."

privacy,fcvcjxr,t1_fctqlc5,1577999252.0,"Okay I follow now. It'll be tough to help them to the other side. It's easy for people to call privacy enthusiasts paranoid. And it's easier to dismiss something that feels like a non threat. You did it yourself until something bit ya. Id start with your closest people. Come from a place of love, empathy, and good intentions. Tell them, in your own words, why it's important that your messages be protected.

This is what would work on me from someone I really care about. Granted I'm a little weird.

Hey Paladin, what we talk about is important to me. And this thing happened with my Dad. I did some digging and all of my setup is real vulnerable to a lot of bad stuff. (Point towards data breaches or companies acting on bad faith). I want to protect us a bit better. The sanctity and dignity of our conversations are worth it to me so I want to switch over to a safer platform, and eventually, I'd like to transition to something with even less vulnerabilities later. But for now, can we start talking on Wire? It's free and we can do all the same things but it'll also be less dangerous (or another word). 

And that may not work right away. To get everyone on one platform can be hard. Just get them all on an end to end encrypted service. It's part of why people are so loyal to protonmail. That encryption protects everyone *enough* and is less technical. You can't really go off the deep end of privacy with an ordinary family or group. Not without immense difficulties."
privacy,fctn4hx,t3_eip2a7,1577949736.0,"Howdy, I went ahead and made an account to comment here. Maybe I can help you.

***EARLY P.S, I didn't understand your post until after I wrote this stuff down. It may still yet be useful so I'm gonna leave it. Skip down some for some advice on how to talk to your friends without Instagram.***

 Privacy has many layers. But first thing first, you're going to be data mined and tracked by these companies. If you're not okay with that you will have to break away from things like Instagram. Now, I know you don't want to do that. You have commitments to people and you and your family have sort of been corralled into this digital cage.

 My first recommendation is to put some distance between your Instagram and the rest of your accounts. Instagram, like Facebook, can track you even if you're not logged in to it or if you have the app installed. It's algorithms are *designed* to pin you down after all. From this position, the best you can hope for is to limit some of the spying.

 Start with a Proton Mail account. Everyone's recommending them for several reasons. You just need to know that they're safer than most services, it'll be free to you, and you are going to make it for the purposes of this one service. Setup Firefox. go into the settings and make sure that everything is toggled off. If you want to obscure yourself from Windows you will need to download TOR. But first, download a VPN. I suggest ProtonVPN. Again, it's free. We can discuss the importance of getting a non free VPN, but this will do for now.
 Do not attach any identifiable information to any account that you create. Connect to the Netherlands server on your VPN. Download TOR and do configure it to setup a bridge. (It'll tell you what that is) Do not login to Instagram on your phone (I'll explain why). Create a fresh Instagram with a complicated password. If you need help with that we can make it really secure if you like. DO ALL OF THIS ON YOUR COMPUTER ONLY. DO NOT ATTACHED ANY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO YOUR INSTAGRAM.

Your phone is the biggest clusterfuck of anti consumer spyware that's ever been produced. Your apps demand vague and far reaching permissions. You are tellijg Instagram that you're you if you put it on your phone. If, for no other reason than your device's serial number. Your messages aren't safe on your phone. And your phone isnt safe with these apps.

 I know this can be intimidating and off putting. It sucks. If you feed something like Instagram information it will use it against you. Again, your phone, especially an Android. Especially a Chinese Android, is always going to be using your information against you. If you want to continue to use your tech like this you are going to be, best case scenario, in limbo with companies that definitely still have you pegged. All of what I wrote can only separate accounts on a small technical level. And perhaps they'll be a little less obvious about their betrayal. 

TLDR: Practice good digital hygiene. But you won't ever really be free unless you break from these companies.

***okay, so this is the bit where we talk about how you can talk to your friends without Instagram.***

If you're looking for a social media like experience. You're SOL. If you want to message people securely you have options. But first I have a questions. Have you considered getting a new device? Your Huawei has a lot of malicious software baked in and I don't trust it. Assuming that you're not willing to get a new device I'm gonna suggest Wire as your choice of messaging platform. It's free. It works on your browser and has apps for the big platforms. Create a Proton email (see above) for this service and this service only. Get a VPN ( ProtonVPN or PIA). And get your friends to join the club. Wire has end to end encryption. This means that if you and your friends are talking on this the conversation can't be shared by Wire. All they'll see, even with a court order, will be encrypted data. They won't be able to see the messages. If like to answer questions if you have them. Or I could help you if you want to start your own privacy crusade. I'm gonna stop here for now."
