""Here take some Motrin, don't run for 5 days and you're fine."" Bullshit. 

It took about 7 of those profiles over 2 years for me to actually get referred to a Army podiatrist that looked at my feet, records, and x-rays and said ""no more running, you're going to give yourself lifelong pain.

At the battalion/brigade level- their job is to keep you deployable, NOT to investigate your injury for long term health. Pain management my ass. Once I started learning that I took as much control over my health and started asking for MRI's etc, and THOSE started catching all kinds of things that went unnoticed by x-rays.

\> The **Gulf War** Registry health **exam** is a free evaluation for Veterans who served in the **Gulf** during Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom, or New Dawn. Veterans can learn about possible health problems related to environmental exposures during military service.
