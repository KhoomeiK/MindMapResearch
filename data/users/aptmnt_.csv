By us, currently. We couldn't formally characterize different types of infinities, before some smart people figured it out. Insects probably won't ever figure it out unless they evolve better brains. 

I don't see why the hard problem of consciousness can be presumed to be beyond knowledge categorically. It might just be beyond knowledge in the way that chaotic systems are unpredictable, we just lack the processing power and/or the right abstractions."
philosophy,ffg6xqw,t1_fffykeq,1579899774.0,"Wow, making my way through the paper. I am shocked that my impression of Kastrup from OP was someone who generally had similar thoughts about consciousness as I do, since this dissertation sounds batshit crazy.

The biggest lack of parsimony (word he seems to love) is, ""wtf is the rest of the physical world there for?"" We know consciousness is the tip of the iceberg of neuronal activity, let alone other bodily functions. Let alone rocks and flowing water and shoes and magma. Let alone asteroids floating millions of light years away with no living beings to be found. Do only living things have corresponding *dissociated alters*? Just the brains? Just the bits of the brains that are doing ""conscious"" activity, not the parts doing automatic activity like knee jerk responses or filling in blind spots?"

""What it's like to see red"" is not an intrinsic quality of red, it differs by subject and occasion.

> Yes, I do think physical facts and facts about experience belong to different domains. 

Different domains, or on different locations in the same domain? As you say, all that you know about physical facts are mediated through experience. Physical facts are just facts about experience with a lot more justified inference."
philosophy,ffg2zju,t1_fffykeq,1579897343.0,"> Basically, he’s saying that physical facts can’t entail facts about the qualities of experience for the same reason that performing a quantitative analysis of a novel tells you nothing about the content of the novel.

I don't like argumentation by analogy. Who can say whether and how far the analogy holds up?

Is it true that ""physical facts"" and ""facts about the qualities of experience"" are in separate domains? Common examples are the ""qualia"" of colors, versus math and physics and so on. Why does nobody speak about the qualia of numbers, of perceiving so called ""physical facts"" and the qualia of judging them to be correct? 

I find it just as plausible that individual experiences of mathematics and logic are exactly as divergent as the qualia of colors are conjectured to be.

Then the problem is not that we want a quantitative analysis of a novel to lead to a qualitative understanding and can't get it, the problem is that we're always using a qualitative analysis. It seems incorrect to assume that quantitative analysis is the ground truth, and qualitative understanding should arise from it."
philosophy,fffyldt,t1_fffwr41,1579894636.0,"I think people just confuse ""consciousness doesn't exist"" and ""consciousness is imperfect""."
philosophy,fffyguh,t1_fffvyty,1579894558.0,"> So let me build the bridge for you. If your mind can only represent reality, then nothing it experiences is exactly true. If consciousness is an experience, then it's an approximation of a much more complex phenomena in the brain. If consciousness is experience, then it's the approximation process itself. We feel conscious because it's a simpler way of feeling 100 trillion neurons firing off.

You can describe consciousness to your heart's content, this does not build a bridge to proving consciousness does not exist."
