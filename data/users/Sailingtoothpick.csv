ChronicPain,fezefw9,t3_eqxyiu,1579456508.0,"I have fibro and it sucks. For him to say ""its just fibro"" is simply bullshit and demeaning. Fibro affects so many different organs over time that just complicates everything. He dismissed you. I'm so sorry. I have to add that is just doesn't get easier since it will eventually be a catch all for nee pains/symptoms. The drug Lyrica worked wonders for my pain but it caused suicidal thoughts which was a no for me.

I pulled over, he approached asked if I knew I was speeding. Stated that I was getting out of his way and off my ass. He asked me if this was a normal thing - yes if your riding my ass I'm getting out of your way because I want to get home safely. No ticket."

AskReddit,fcvzcb7,t3_eipzwh,1578013551.0,"I was scheduled for surgery and had to have labs the next day. I was nervous and afraid. That night I dreamed that I died during the surgery and also my cat. The next morning I was really freaked out about the dream but it didn't make any sense to me because of my cat dying.

While getting ready I kept hearing a thumping noise - looked under an end table; my cat was seizing. Called my sister to come - I was extremely upset. She took my cat to the vet hospital. 

Once I finished my labs, I rushed home to call and check on her. They said she was getting treatment for possible poisoning and was resting comfortably. Maybe a minute or two passed when the vet called back - she was actually dead not sleeping.

I'm going to skip to the end of my story-my neighbor hated our cat and her kittens because they were shitting in his flower beds. I knocked on his door to ask if he had seen the two kittens - when he opened the door before I could even ask; he said to me ""I trapped them and threw over a bridge. Called the police same statement to the cops, he was arrested but turns out that you can't incriminate yourself, charges dropped."

AskReddit,fcotzir,t3_ei21zo,1577841505.0,"About 30 years ago I had started a new job - while I was on break the only other employee sat down beside me to tell me he was a convicted sex offender. All I could say was ""ok-why are you telling me this"". He wanted it to come from him not someone else.

Long story short - I told the owner that I couldn't work there since he left me alone with him. The owner came to my house sincerely apologized and promised to never leave me alone with him. I agreed to stay on.

The owner began flirting with me which eventually led to him trying to grab my breasts and me leaving."
