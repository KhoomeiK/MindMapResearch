The excuse that they didn't immediately recognize the format of the cheque is ridiculous; it's their job to be able to recognize (and be able to distinguish)  the differences, and, if you think its fraudulent, let the people who are paid to deal with that deal with that; just deposit it and put a hold on it, that's your job."

Nope, just a large family of African Americans, two parents and 4 or 5 kids, and they would often have family over. She shouldn't have been surprised at this, her mom had like 6 kids. But she either didnt think it was possible that a black family could afford a place right next to her, or didnt want to admit that she was living next to them, I honestly dont know but regardless she was either ignorant or racist.

You can see blood spurting from his neck, and one of the support staff (I think the defense coach) ran out on the ice, reached his hand into this dudes open neck wound, and clamped the artery with his hand (a technique he learned as a combat medic). Saved the goalies life on the ice and had to keep holding it closed as he was stretchered off to the emts. What a madlad."

My rescue pup took almost three days to come off of the huge loveseat I laid him down on when we brought him home; he wouldn't walk past the window or the refrigerator or up or down stairs, so we had to slowly introduce him to everything and show him it was ok to be there.

I finally release him, ""fine bro I'm not taking you down with me."" He ran out the room as the figure reached the bed, and like a dementor, got straight in my face, which went frigid and I just felt the life pass away from me.

They really indoctrinated these people, so one one hand, you gotta feel sorry for them being so mislead.

No two people will have the same perception, and it's their perception that defines how they classify you. My psychiatrist is upset that I have a med card, and the other doctor I go to for advice on how cannibas can help me (both for physical and mental problems) tells me that the other girl is whack. It's closer to a pseudoscience than an actual practice, and while it's got a good footing and decent results, theres no consensus on things like this, and it really disillusions me."
