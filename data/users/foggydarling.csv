Shrimping,ffapy29,t3_esif1e,1579741746.0,He egg
aww,ffa81qe,t1_ff9pfmj,1579729692.0,It think it depends on the individual cat. One of the three cats I’ve had seems to recognise herself and understand what a mirror/reflection is. The others behaved as though there was another cat behind the “glass”.
Embroidery,ffa7hb7,t3_esfq4a,1579729373.0,"Great work! And yes, you are possibly weird but also very normal, as it’s not at all uncommon to be attracted to even horrible baddies in movie/tv. Just try to avoid dudes like that irl!"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,ff7kg5t,t3_erxv4z,1579651666.0,"Hahah, my vet has learned by now that when my cat comes in for her vaccinations, they need to call in a helper with heavy duty gauntlets to hold her."
aww,ff7jaa6,t3_eryoih,1579650871.0,"What an idyllic scene with the restful pup, cornfields, old swing, and sunshine thick as honey."
aww,ff7f465,t1_ff72jvu,1579648099.0,"I had these vibes whenever it was like 10pm and my parents were having a dinner party when au was little, and they were having fun and topics of conversation were getting distinctly grown up, and I knew they’d had a few too many wines to realise I was up past my bedtime and listening intently, but I had to fight my own tiredness because if they noticed me dozing off, they would realise what time it was and make me go to bed, when there was still a lot of interesting conversation to overhear and snacks to steal. So maybe this puppy is in the same boat."
aww,ff5t0vv,t1_ff5qtoj,1579609138.0,"I wasn't sure at first, but you've changed my mind."
aww,ff45xi6,t1_ff3mb0z,1579556254.0,The OG robin. American robins were named after this bird because of the similar red/orange breast.
aww,ff1x3uh,t1_ff0fl1l,1579488170.0,People still go to bars despite the fact that some people struggle with alcoholism. Pretty much everything is bad for you without moderation.
aww,ff1wwam,t1_fezn4yn,1579488036.0,"When you keep your cat indoors though, some people will tell you that’s cruel. No winning, really."
namenerds,ff1wf6w,t1_ff1d3qa,1579487715.0,Yeah I can’t help but slur “Missterrr Anderrrsson” at anyone with that name.
namenerds,ff1vv4v,t1_ff1p7lo,1579487345.0,"It’s also a constellation and a galaxy. I have a friend with that name so it sounds fairly normal to me now, but I do remember being sort of surprised by it the first time I heard it."
namenerds,ff1v7n2,t1_ff1oewp,1579486918.0,"Hahah I love when couples have their own weird language jokes. My husband and I tend to refer to everything with just the first syllable. Like spider is spi, blanket is blank, banana is ban... button mushrooms became “butt mush” which amused me to no end."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,felmdk3,t3_eppkns,1579225635.0,This looks like the poster for a party I would 100% want to go to.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fell4pm,t3_eplug5,1579224783.0,Sold!
WitchesVsPatriarchy,felkoou,t1_fekb4g8,1579224482.0,I collected rabbit poop as a kid. I thought they were just cool little balls of grass that had formed somehow. Eventually my mom noticed the growing collection of rabbit turds under the sun chair in our yard and nearly died laughing.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,felkhj5,t1_fek0zvc,1579224348.0,"Oh man, I recently found my “book of spells” from when I was a kid. Really it was a piece of paper with a few things scribbled on it with a sharpie, but I remember being pretty serious about it. For some reason a popular potion ingredient was little splinters of wood from the walls of my grandmother’s 200 year old wooden house, but my mom put a stop to it real quick when she noticed me tearing pieces off the walls."
namenerds,fegefa9,t1_feg33m5,1579089876.0,Wow that’s an awkward nickname to hang on to post toddlerhood.
rarepuppers,fec0mv4,t1_feaa6pm,1578964898.0,I’ve come to sulk in you again
WitchesVsPatriarchy,febzohf,t1_febbxsg,1578964650.0,"I have a bit of this too. A guy grabbed my ass once when I was on the street, and without realising I whirled around and shoved him as hard as I could. Turned out he was wasted and fell over like dead weight, instantly I was worried that he would crack his head on the pavement and die or something. Another time someone grabbed me while I was at an ATM and I did some sort of elbows and kicking manoeuvre that had him let go and run away. Still not sure what exactly happened there. Basically I’m like a horse, do not approach from behind unannounced."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,febyqiw,t1_fe9iwhd,1578964400.0,"Yup. When walking at night I stand tall, walk in a determined way, and make sure that anyone vaguely threatening I come across can see that I’ve seen them and that I’m aware of my surroundings. But it’s sad as hell that this is just automatic behaviour at this point."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,feby6ib,t1_febgtpu,1578964176.0,"This is the terrifying thing. I’m tallish and fairly sturdy in build, and my husband is only a tiny bit taller and heavier than me. We’re in similar shape (or out of shape). But he doesn’t even have to use all of his strength to completely pin me down so there is nothing I can do. I know this because I’ve asked him to do it so I could try escaping, not because he has done anything against my will, just to be clear. But it’s so scary to realise."
aww,febx0zt,t1_fe9whz4,1578963695.0,"Saaame. Rats are so adorable and intelligent, but I don’t know if I can handle a pet with such a short life span."
namenerds,febwlcv,t3_eo73u5,1578963540.0,I pronounced it “lew-lew” in my head.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdr5yah,t3_empm95,1578679928.0,"I can usually tell you what time it is to within about 15 minutes without having looked at a clock all day. It's not precise enough to be particularly useful, but I do occasionally impress people when they go ""what time is it"" and I say ""about 3.15"" without checking my phone or whatnot."
aww,fdq68jx,t1_fdq5xdt,1578656672.0,Yeah no. A lot of people are aware of the existence of big flashy gestures and still don’t want them. It would just make me feel awkward and like I was expected to perform in some way instead of just enjoying the moment.
namenerds,fdngj2y,t1_fdn2vr4,1578585326.0,Interesting! I think Seb is the most common nn for Sebastian her in the UK.
aww,fdmw8ge,t1_fdm2cbo,1578568698.0,Oh hey thanks!
namenerds,fdlpxnp,t1_fdl6c2u,1578529692.0,"Yup. It works for everyone from a baby to a Nobel prize winner, and Seb is a cool nickname in my view."
namenerds,fdlpjnu,t1_fdkjlr3,1578529431.0,"Fun fact: the name Gaston means “guest”, and the words “guest” and “ghost” come from the same root word. I guess ghosts can be a type of guest. I’m currently listening to the History of English podcast, so I had to share."
namenerds,fdlorpg,t1_fdlnqba,1578528901.0,I think I got my obsession with Rose from a version of Sleeping Beauty that I had on a tape of fairytales where her name was Rose.
namenerds,fdlmu0k,t1_fdk9264,1578527597.0,"Well if you agreed on “as long as we call him Auri”, then the mistake you’re making is not sticking to that agreement."
namenerds,fdlmi0s,t1_fdlgno4,1578527376.0,"I love those middle names! I know someone who gave her daughters the middle names Lily and Petunia, which I also find adorable."
namenerds,fdllwc4,t1_fdllbne,1578526980.0,That’s exactly what I thought too.
namenerds,fdlkts9,t1_fdleyse,1578526280.0,"Same! When I was a kid I insisted that I would change my name to Rose as soon as I turned 18. I got too accustomed to my name by that point, but now it’s at the top of my baby name list. Rosa is an option as well, and would work better in my native language."
aww,fdlkiik,t1_fdkr1n1,1578526080.0,"As a person who lives in Scotland, I have no idea what that smells like."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdij3aw,t3_elhgfc,1578444046.0,"Yeah this was an important realisation for me, kind of with everything. Now that I’m 30 it’s finally starting to hit me that it’s fine for me to be a novice at things, or to do them differently or to a different degree than other people. There will always be someone who thinks you’re “not doing it right” no matter how you do it, so why bother caring what they think."
namenerds,fdihgvj,t1_fdhl95t,1578443012.0,"Yeah my best attempt is “Ma-car-sin”, which... isn’t pretty."
namenerds,fdihai9,t1_fdi4k7k,1578442896.0,In Finland at least I’m pretty sure it’s only free once. I changed the spelling of my name when I was 18.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fd9123v,t1_fd7ngu2,1578226609.0,"I offer to help general randos all the time though, Like a small old lady trying to reach something on a high shelf or whatnot, so I would do the same for a person in a wheelchair."
Embroidery,fd5uw7d,t1_fd5ctzp,1578181796.0,"Just for some reason I read “told everyone I could (do something... like, embroidery maybe?)” I don’t think there is anything wrong with your sentence, just a misread."
Embroidery,fd5cmi0,t1_fd57gen,1578176296.0,Told everyone they could tell. Took me a minute too.
aww,fcvyedw,t1_fcu2d35,1578012931.0,"You have to pick your battles with pets, especially if they were a rescue that you got when they were already an adult. They can be so terrified of some things if they didn’t experience them in a safe way from a young age, that there is really no changing it,"
Embroidery,fcvxhbw,t3_ej4pno,1578012327.0,So gorgeous. Your fox piece is in my saved posts and I hope I can make something so beautiful one day!
Awwducational,fcvf54r,t1_fcu91kh,1578000795.0,"I was just recently admiring some highland cows with their calves when another person wandered up and went in for a pet. She very nearly lost a finger. So, I guess, but at your own risk."
aww,fcsr26o,t1_fcs5j3a,1577922948.0,"A racist joke, and SUCH an old and lame one. At least be mildly original or funny if you’re determined to be edgy."
aww,fcju9k2,t1_fcih15d,1577705028.0,Saaame. I also have an irrational fear when I walk past a cop that I will accidentally punch them or something and then go to prison forever.
aww,fc96bq8,t1_fc7zdcf,1577547726.0,It’s most likely the fat in those things that the kitty is after. They can’t really taste sweetness.
aww,fc963w2,t1_fc7oldy,1577547629.0,"Yeah if I have a clementine or something and don’t immediately wash my hands afterwards, my cat avoids me like the plague."
aww,fc78q2u,t1_fc72hat,1577500502.0,"I definitely don’t hate them or anything, but the old “just following orders thing” doesn’t really appeal to me, if it is a job you chose. I know for some there is little other choice, and people have different reasons for choosing it as I said, but unless there is conscription, it is a choice and so you can’t be completely separate from the people who employ you. In any job I work I would hope I was working for a company or organisation where I can say that I generally approve of the things they do. I don’t think the military is an exception."

aww,fc71z7h,t1_fc71n02,1577495401.0,Well I’m referring to the military as a political entity. The people in charge of decisions. But I’m not anti individual soldiers either.
aww,fc6c6tx,t3_egc92a,1577477158.0,Torille?
aww,fc6buuf,t1_fc5o3on,1577476939.0,"This is why nature documentaries are so sad to watch. Whether or not the lion catches the gazelle or whatever, one of the animals is having a bad day."
aww,fc69em8,t1_fc6305s,1577475306.0,What a kind and thoughtful response! I’m generally pretty anti military myself but individual people join the military for all sorts of reasons.
