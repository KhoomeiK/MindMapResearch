books,ff1t9pg,t3_eo1rfv,1579485679.0,"Just finished **The Sons of Blackbird Mountain, by Joanne Bischof** super sweet book if you like historical romances with writing that chances the first person around to different characters in the story, sometimes flipping to 3rd person.  Super good book and put an emphasis on understanding the Deaf community. 

I'm starting now **The Sky Above Us, by Sarah Sundin**.  Another historical WWI piece that I enjoy. I havmt read this book yet but I do love WWI pieces and it had good reviews on GR."
books,ff1sq2r,t3_er0mti,1579485336.0,"I went on a Hamilton kick for a few months and read a 3 book series (Alex and Eliza, Love and War, All For One by Melissa de la Cruz) and as I enjoyed the first one with its familiar characters to the musical, the other 2 were strained and stretched.  I forced myself to finish the 3rd book just to get the series over with.. I wanted to like it but I couldn't get passed how forced and far from the historical relevance it became."
