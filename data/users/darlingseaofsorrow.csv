Soda,fchq6yu,t3_eh2oef,1577652970.0,Dang. My brain put together the bottle of Grape Nehi with the box marked Blue Cream. Now I'm craving my childhood favorite: Blue Nehi.

facepalm,fc8veh3,t3_egitlx,1577542632.0,I'm an atheist and pray all the time. I just assume no one is listening or cares. Like when I talk to my boyfriend...

facepalm,fc8rkm0,t1_fc3rxx6,1577540719.0,"Yet this implies you believe Trump is neurotypical, which he is not. Those with certain mental health disorders, like narcissism and oppositional defiance, are often characterized by deep-rooted selfishness, an inability to recognize or accept that they are at fault for their own mistakes and the consequences of those mistakes, and a lack of concern for the negative impact of those consequences on themselves or others. Someone that self-centered almost never learns from the reactions of others or receiving back what they put out. Instead, they reject the censure and rationalize blaming their own mistakes and the consequences on anyone around them. Faced with potentially negative repercussions, they will generally lash out, argue or shut down communication, and rationalize blaming others rather than ever accept their own culpability. They tune-out all evidence they are in the wrong, and learn only when they choose to recognize and accept that they are at fault for their own bad choices. Trump is never going to learn or accept responsibility for his mistakes because for 73 years his disorder has worked out for him just fine. When his punishment inevitably comes, he will simply conclude he's right and everyone else is wrong, and ignore any/all repercussions of his choices, learning nothing. I fully agree he must be punished for what he has done but this will not teach *him* anything. He will *always* ""go on thinking he's great."" It may, however, deter other more neurotypical corrupt individuals from intentionally replicating his mistakes in the future."
