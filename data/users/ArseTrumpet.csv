todayilearned,ffbh7yq,t1_ffbb9uz,1579765170.0,"I've heard ""half of everything"" thrown about but I never thought bout the nitty gritty of literally dividing up books etc. Like does one person get the fridge with it's contents or do you squabble over how many eggs and rashers you keep?"

europe,fez0wwg,t1_feypuh8,1579452886.0,I suppose given their views on Slavic peoples they would have been much more barbaric in their treatment of the east. It still baffles me that there are neo-nazis in places like Poland when there were plans for the wholesale enslavement and extermination of their population by the nazis.
europe,fey94kt,t1_fey1nqy,1579442352.0,I am sure this was the case and it's something Hollywood etc. shies away from. But the article seems to say the German's left places neat and treated them with respect which seems absurd. Were they not known for destroying places as they retreated?

Avengers,feks9cy,t1_fejok1j,1579206542.0,"Piracy you say? Aye. I do remember sitting penniless pining for a good comic book, a young man full of  hope and wonder. I decided to heed the call to join a wretched crew on a cursed ship. We were to make our fortune plundering on the high seas with promises of American gold and copies of aquaman ringing through our ears. But alas here I sit, penniless, legless and comicless. A broken man. Piracy. Pah."

nottheonion,feg3is4,t1_fefve0j,1579075305.0,"I'm not affiliated with the previous commenter. Not very knowledgeable about cooking I just wing it but I use the point of a knife in the oddly specific following ways: Puncturing a leg of lamb to insert rosmary and slivers of garlic. Making small incisions in chicken breasts to create a cavity with a small opening for garlic butter when making chicken kiev. Making a small cut in the top of a tomato before slicing it (only necessary when the knife edge has become blunt and/or the tomato is overly ripe). I have old knives, too lazy to sharpen, and my tomatoes can't be eaten fast enough."

Last time I was there at about 7am it was a sorry sight of homeless people in sleeping bags, lots of takeaway rubbish, vomit and one very friendly drunk Russian shouting at me. Not that he was a problem he was lovely I just wanted to mention him. It was his 40th birthday. That was a Sunday morning though so worse than other days I guess."
ireland,fe1yh9y,t3_enezuu,1578832349.0,"Lads calm down will ye. We're letting a dislike of daft cunts like Arlene Fister cloud our judgement. I see no downside to preserving a bit of linguistic diversity. Look into pidgin and creole languages, there's a whole world of this kind of thing and it's usually only imperialistic elitist pricks that have a problem with it. Languages develop from other languages. Just because I want to preserve Irish doesn't mean I mock Scots Gaelic and Manx."
