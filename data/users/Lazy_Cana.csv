AskMen,fem20av,t1_felaf5x,1579237159.0,"I moved in with my boyfriend after 2 months of dating. It's crazy but I didn't have much of a choice. I was still living with my mom (I'm 18) and didn't have a job so no money. One day at practice I get a call from her saying she was selling our house the *next week*. She gave me a choice. Move in with her boyfriend (whom she'd been dating for a month) or move in with my boyfriend. I knew immediately what choice I'd rather make but was scared to ask my boyfriend the question because obviously it was way too soon. He said yes though and I moved in. My mom broke up with her boyfriend 2 weeks later and she moved from my sisters house to my brothers house, all the while dragging my 4 younger siblings with her. I like to believe I made the right decision given the circumstances"
