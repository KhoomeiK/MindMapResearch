Latchkey_Kids,ffmllk0,t3_eth1ud,1580056342.0,"""I got spanked and I turned out fine."" - If you want to hit someone who can't resist you just because you're too lazy to use your words, you did not turn out fine.

""Sometimes there's no other way to get them to calm down."" - Yes, there is. Take them outside, do an activity that helps them put their energy somewhere and afterwards adress the situation.

""People are just too sensitive nowadays. What will those kids do in a war?"" - Hopefully nothing. Our society is one built on the hope for peace, not war.

""It was just a light slap."" - It doesn't matter. It's not just about the physicality. If it was, stepping on someone's toes every day just because they annoy you would be a valid thing to do as well. Doesn't do much damage either - to the body. The mind, however...

People always like to act as if ""being above it"" somehow took the assholes' power away but that is only true to a very limited extent. Sure, you can just block someone pissing you off online, but especially in real life, things get tricky. You can be as ""above it"" mentally as you like, if someone starts spreading rumours and working on making you fail, they will have an effect no matter how much you supposedly ""don't care"".

BUT when it comes to the stuff that, technically, doesn't really have to affect you (in example some douchebag online calling you ugly for no reason), I must tell you (as one hell of a sensitive person) that the more you work on yourself and your self-worth, the easier it gets to keep them away in your mind. Sometimes trying to laugh about it can help - a notion heavily advocated by Viktor Frankl amongst others.

Rape is an aggressive assault done by people who wish to assert power. There's studies and books about how the sexual aspect is a mere tool in these instances. Rape is not sex.


The technicalities are complicated. Physically, technically, one could  argue that ""losing your virginity"" is defined as ""being penetrated for the first time"", but quite frankly - so fucking what? I'm with you on this one and I will forever point out to people that rape is not sex. It simply isn't. Calling rape sex is like calling massaging someone's back and stabbing them the same thing. Just because the back is involved doesn't make them equal.


I'd tell your friends that if they wish to support you in reclaiming your sexuality after having been assaulted and put through hell, they better stop creating a narrative where physical technicality suddenly gets more standing in this context than it usually does.

There's a variety of articles and books out there written, amongst others, by language philosophers explaining in depth how the upkeeping of certain notions in language serves to upkeep certain notions in minds - and this is the case with this joke. It's not about whether the guy wants to mock anyone and it doesn't matter if he, in his conscious thoughts, deems women lesser or equal.

What does matter is the underlying stereotype behind the joke which is the only part that would make up the punchline. By upkeeping said punchline, one keeps the stereotype alive - and with it, the notion behind it, which is indeed misogyny. Were people to just research subtext, social constructivism or one of the thousands of other important key topics regarding all this, they would be well aware. But they don't, so they're not - and you end up with so many comments wondering why an individual case of someone making a seemingly ""innocent joke"" can somehow be a big deal.

But here's the thing: It is a big deal. And the people who have done their research know it. And the people who haven't got homework to do first."

I can't think of a single game with a female-only protagonist that really captures the ""power fantasy""-thing. Maybe Edna from ""Edna & Harvey: The Breakout"" if we count ""not giving a crap, not letting anyone give me shit and outwitting all others"" as a power fantasy.

In any case, go you, OP. I'm like you - if it's unfair, I'll be the irritating nuisance. I fell in love with Kant bc of his categorical imperative - which is pretty much just a more complex version of the golden rule. I can feel the anger in your post and I absolutely understand and share it. This was just major bullshit - and you were only 14. It's not like just being 14 wouldn't have been enough of a hassle already - or as if having batshit parents wouldn't have been annoying enough without being threatened with law enforcement.

creepyPMs,ff5qyx6,t3_erhbyu,1579606746.0,"Honey, do NOT, I repeat, do NOT fall into the trap of thinking this *dude* is just socially inept. He *is* socially inept, but the only way this shows in your conversation is that his creepy and gross attempts to ""groom"" you are so badly done that it's almost reassuring because the chance of him ever finding somone who'd fall for his crap is *very* slim.

Since you're ace I presume you haven't dug all that deep into what bdsm is - but let me tell you, he's a predator. The second he said ""Does me being forward and dominant bother you?"" I cringed so fricking hard. He keeps on using lingo that is nowhere near appropriate for platonic conversation - and he keeps on trying to push his crap on you. To him, it's sexual from the very start - even though NOTHING you said indicated that was okay.

This is not a socially inept, ""slightly autistic"" (??) person trying to make a friend. This is a predator blatantly ignoring you repeatedly when confronted with the information that you're asexual and trying to exploit the fact that you're scared of being mean.

I could not be any more glad that you blocked the guy. And I sure hope he always shows his creep so blatantly because noone should have to deal with this shit. As for his girlfriend, I most certainly hope she's either imaginary or she'll dump his ass sooner than later.


I mean, from this conversation alone, the guy can be classified as:


- a groomer

- a creep

- a cheater

- a predator

- a person who doesn't respect or give a shit about consent



You did the one and only right thing, OP. You blocked a horrible person. - and on a sidenote: never fear ""being mean"" when someone creeps you out. Your safety and comfort are more important and we don't owe someone niceness when they go out of their way to be anything *but* nice."

Hear me out real quick - of course it was an asshole move that she outed you. But she was indeed 13 and if you were raised religiously, there's a strong chance she felt obliged.

19 isn't that late to realize the wrongness of what she did at 13. It's comparably early, if you ask me - the people who pushed my head into the toilet when I was 11-14 haven't apologized to this day, and we're all 26 by now. Many people grow old and stay dicks.

But your perspective is perfectly valid. She played a role in your life taking a terrible turn (conversion ""therapy"" is awful and that's not to be dismissed). She is close with people who badly mistreated you and she got things that you would have deserved just as much. That pain is real and absolutely understandable.

I don't think anyone can tell you whether you ""should"" forgive her. You have a right to your boundaries and your needs. But I don't think your sister is in any way an asshole for reaching out, owning up to her mistake and apologizing sincerely.

Personally, I hope you will find it in you to give her a chance. I had to throw my mom out of my life because she will never apologize or even consider the possibility that her abuse was wrong. And there was a time when I thought I could never forgive my father - but it is long gone because I decided to forgive him when he made amends. He is very dear to me and I am glad I made that choice.

But that's just my very personal perspective that of course doesn't need to bother you. No matter what you choose, your reasons are valid and so are your feelings.

I wish you the best, OP."
