TrueOffMyChest,ffvocfu,t1_ffvo51c,1580268884.0,It's almost like different people have different experiences and there's not a universal experience.

When 4 other kids are there at the same time, the center is earning 19.30 an hour, which means they can pay their caregivers AT LEAST minimum wage and still have operating costs left.
