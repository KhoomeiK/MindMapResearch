smashbros,fezrmai,t1_feyxbtl,1579460762.0,"Yeah, I feel like a lot of people didnâ€™t realize that they should wait until the things they were buying are revealed"
smashbros,fezqvll,t1_feyuy64,1579460508.0,Iâ€™d say that down b is closer to warlock punch with Roy neutral-b animation
smashbros,fezp641,t1_fezauow,1579459918.0,Both do I think
therewasanattempt,feyx0b3,t1_fewlojb,1579451533.0,Thatâ€™s why they said
thatHappened,feojkya,t1_fensobe,1579300994.0,"He said:


â€œThis is such a big problem, my guys.

Peoples false worldviews are amplified by these fake storys. Her followers will be like:"" Dude, thats so fucked up! People are so bad!!"". They dont even question it, they will think that people will rage if you call them boomer after they just randomly ask for your gender, deny your gender and call you a trannyâ€"
thatHappened,fenbnoj,t1_fehrd9j,1579281229.0,Then read the comment
thatHappened,fenbfu1,t1_fehz9kn,1579281094.0,That doesnâ€™t change that a teacher *by law* has to take immediate action in that situation. And how did the SRO find the note if the teacher just threw it away?
thatHappened,fenammo,t1_fegpibj,1579280588.0,Happy cakeday
smashbros,fen7rtq,t1_femzl4z,1579278832.0,You blind or something?
smashbros,fen7lee,t1_femxn5t,1579278720.0,"The point is, these new costumes will encourage people to use miis, which is what happened with sans.

Also, I find the miis fun, though a little lacking"
smashbros,fen79lf,t1_fen72y1,1579278520.0,"How would I know? Iâ€™m not a developer so I donâ€™t know what they could be adding. Especially with the new crafting mechanic. But they have a lot of things that could be talked about, Animal Crossing New Leaf got a pretty big segment"
smashbros,fen7187,t1_fen3kve,1579278376.0,There are tons of things you can talk about. I havenâ€™t played the games in a while but this new one looks like it has new mechanics in making the town
smashbros,fen6uy9,t3_eq202f,1579278268.0,Sheik hit them
smashbros,femzxbq,t3_epugt2,1579273839.0,Could you tell what frame you hit him? Or give an estimate?
smashbros,femyqdd,t3_epvtw7,1579273023.0,"Idk, favoritism might be a part of it still. Iâ€™m sure if Sakurai was a big PokÃ©mon fan weâ€™d see a ton more PokÃ©mon as there are tons of them that work.

I donâ€™t think itâ€™s necessarily bad that he plays some favorites, because he still provides a good experience and it is his game"
smashbros,femy3y3,t1_fem6r11,1579272595.0,"I feel like it depends on the character for me. Like I wouldnâ€™t consider Dark Samus or Richter or Daisy to take a slot as they are identical to their original, Chromâ€™s up-b being an entirely different move might let him take up a slot. Lucina is questionable for taking a slot, but maybe? And I forgot if there were any more echoes"
smashbros,femxubh,t3_epwqk4,1579272407.0,"Manado Arts is a top pick, but I would also love Palutenaâ€™s teleport"
smashbros,femxl2d,t3_epx0oj,1579272228.0,"Piranha Plant wasnâ€™t part of the fighter pack, heâ€™s a separate DLC"
smashbros,femxfhm,t1_femdcaj,1579272118.0,"The hell you mean it never worked? The main reason I played and loved FE is because of Smash, and thatâ€™s trye for Kid Icarus as well"
smashbros,femwu3f,t1_femudl6,1579271686.0,"Itâ€™s a joke, calm down"
smashbros,femwoss,t1_femrnxu,1579271577.0,"Wait, so people arenâ€™t allowed to want something because theyâ€™re the minority?

What about Sakurai, who is the DEVELOPER. He wanted this character, and he is happy making them. Youâ€™re allowed to dislike things but you canâ€™t say that other people that do like it donâ€™t matter"
smashbros,femwj62,t3_epymr6,1579271460.0,"Yeah, I donâ€™t get all the anger towards Byleth. There are going to be like 85 characters when the 2nd pack comes out (less if you donâ€™t count echoes as different) and we got heavy hitters like Joker, Hero, and even Banjo. In the base game we got heavily requested fighters like Ridley and K.Rool, and we have 6 more fighters coming."
smashbros,femlip0,t1_felkv2a,1579261439.0,Itâ€™s because he unconfirmed the â€œgrinch leakâ€ which had a lot of well-liked characters
memes,femld5e,t1_femgzjb,1579261251.0,It literally got silver
smashbros,felb2zp,t1_feknjuz,1579218014.0,"Link is a projectile user not really fitting into the archetype of the others, but yeah, I see how you feel. It makes sense"
watchpeoplealmostdie,fel2wci,t1_fbbtems,1579212889.0,"I remember someone telling me that if I ever get in a fight, start with a left hook to catch them off guard"
smashbros,fekwsa6,t1_fekrdtp,1579209215.0,Yeah. I just want some sort of illusion gimmick in a fighter that would be cool
smashbros,fekrb2c,t3_epkxko,1579205986.0,"Has to be Joker, Iâ€™ve wanted him for a while and it was a total shock. My second will be (a controversial pick) Byleth, because Three Houses is one of my favorite games in the last year. Hero is the third, though Iâ€™d never previously played a DQ game, because heâ€™s fun as hell. Banjo and Terry are tied"
smashbros,fekqqzr,t1_fek09xr,1579205660.0,"You really donâ€™t under marketing, do you?"
smashbros,fekqdq4,t1_fekiypg,1579205442.0,Dang I woulda loved for Zoroark to be playable but I understand why it wouldnâ€™t work as a fighter
smashbros,fekpz32,t3_epl5fw,1579205199.0,"Well, I know a lot of terms and techniques and how to do them, but Iâ€™m not that good at the game. I could give someone advice on what to do and what situations, but Iâ€™m not honed on the game."
smashbros,fekozml,t3_eplgxx,1579204610.0,"Theyâ€™ll do the same thing they did this time, have the heavy hitters up front to draw in sales of the fighters pass"
smashbros,feko3f1,t3_epm1od,1579204082.0,"My favorite matchups are dittos, specifically Hero on Hero. but other than that I have a lot of fun playing as Dedede or Ganondorf against DK"
smashbros,fekno1v,t3_epm8qa,1579203828.0,"Well, they are competitively pretty good (in my opinion) so it just depends if you have fun playing them"
smashbros,fekmk4b,t1_fekh610,1579203165.0,"How? Robin does not play like the other swordies at all, and Corrin (while yea they are a bit closer to how the others play) is also played differently"
smashbros,fekm590,t1_fekjpe0,1579202920.0,"I mean, the 69th place is named Joyboy tho, which is a fitting name"
