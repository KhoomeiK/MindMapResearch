smashbros,femyqdd,t3_epvtw7,1579273023.0,"Idk, favoritism might be a part of it still. I’m sure if Sakurai was a big Pokémon fan we’d see a ton more Pokémon as there are tons of them that work.

I don’t think it’s necessarily bad that he plays some favorites, because he still provides a good experience and it is his game"
smashbros,femy3y3,t1_fem6r11,1579272595.0,"I feel like it depends on the character for me. Like I wouldn’t consider Dark Samus or Richter or Daisy to take a slot as they are identical to their original, Chrom’s up-b being an entirely different move might let him take up a slot.

What about Sakurai, who is the DEVELOPER. He wanted this character, and he is happy making them. You’re allowed to dislike things but you can’t say that other people that do like it don’t matter"
smashbros,femwj62,t3_epymr6,1579271460.0,"Yeah, I don’t get all the anger towards Byleth. There are going to be like 85 characters when the 2nd pack comes out (less if you don’t count echoes as different) and we got heavy hitters like Joker, Hero, and even Banjo.
