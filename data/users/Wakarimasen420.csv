AskMen,ffcbwhl,t1_ffbxa15,1579796111.0,"I haven’t worn mine in years.  Partially because she came out to me as a lesbian after 14 years of marriage, but mostly because I never liked wearing one."
todayilearned,feyyw9g,t1_feyoooe,1579452200.0,"I feel that beyond the points made that the iPhone is also for people who want their phones secure, know that anything they download is approved and secure to a point.  While Android will literally have apps in the store that are questionable, and your security is so-so within those apps.

Personally, I use both.  Both have advantages.  Ease of use and security being the iPhone’s main advantage, while Android allows you to do anything you want, even if it is a terrible idea.  It’s kinda like Linux vs Mac/Windows."
todayilearned,feyxvjk,t1_fey7lnw,1579451784.0,"I believe that the online Netflix was offering at the time wasn’t streaming, but an online DVD rental service.

Netflix didn’t even attempt to start streaming video until 6 years later."
science,feove4i,t1_fen92wu,1579306235.0,"As long as they pick from your list of choices you want them to, right?

Having an abortion is not killing a person, and the fact that you consider it to be so pretty much ends this discussion.  Scientists, philosophers, and theologians are unable to define when personhood starts, but I’m sure you are convinced that you have it figured out."
science,fen3kfr,t1_femdwbi,1579276198.0,Pro-life is a terrible term for what you believe.  Anti-choice is a far better term.
science,fen2keu,t1_femf07i,1579275559.0,"My girlfriend’s parents in high school did the same.  I know it messed me up for years afterwards.  She went totally off the rails.

Abortion would have been 100x better (and can attest to that too from experience).

It was a good learning experience though.  Never date Mormon girls."
todayilearned,fembdeq,t1_femasn8,1579247104.0,"That is very true.  It’s nearly impossible to find them.  They have been increasing in number in preparation for the olympics, but it is still not much.

And yeah, it was because of those attacks."
todayilearned,fem76oo,t1_fem61up,1579242202.0,Eating on the go also increases the chances of food and trash on the ground or on yourself.
worldnews,febl02n,t1_febkob8,1578959935.0,"Sorry, didn’t mean to confuse you.  I agree 1 in 52 rapes is the right number.

I was just saying that 1 in 5 for verbal or physical sexual assault seems low."
worldnews,febjggg,t1_febglw3,1578959434.0,"I feel like it would be higher than 1 in 5.  By that definition, I feel like cat calling would qualify, and that alone I’m surprised isn’t higher than 20%."
television,fe572tg,t1_fe55v8m,1578866218.0,"To be fair, Netflix pulled it after a month, when doctors and scientists contacted them about the bad info in the documentary.  Apple, Amazon, and Vimeo left it up on their site.

videos,fdziaky,t1_fdxqwdi,1578790496.0,"I agree.  Their really isn’t a quick or easy fix.  It’s a generational problem, but I think it starts with fixing inequality and social isolationism.  I think a lot of their hate for others, which shutting down asylum and putting kids in cages clearly shows IMO, is due to the outcome of their lives and they really don’t have a way to correct it."
videos,fdxk8qe,t1_fdxizfk,1578769573.0,"A healthy dose of brainwashing, group think, and lies being fed to them, I think would be the situation to understand."
politics,fdpbf5t,t1_fdpa4pl,1578624431.0,"They didn’t do anything about it with former republican presidents either, but they also had slightly more justification than this one.

So yeah, unstable Cheeto Bandito being bad is the reason."

reactiongifs,fdagk20,t1_fda9q27,1578245839.0,"Not True.  False.  There are literally left leaning people before your post that agree that what Obama did was wrong.  There was outcry both at the time, like the ACLU suing over it, the New York Times, the Guardian, and many other left leaning news sources reported negatively on it, and there is still left leaning people against it now.


Can the right make the same claim about Trump pardoning and campaigning with a war criminal?"
greentext,fd5sva6,t1_fd46kdt,1578181121.0,"I’m not sure if everyone can... but I used to have some somewhat severe sensory overload problems.  I did low dosages of LSD as a teenager, and massive doses of shrooms.  It really helped me and I don’t really get overloaded anymore... but I also make sure to do shrooms once a year or so."
TwoXChromosomes,fd5cgrh,t1_fd3is7w,1578176245.0,"I find that past me was both a genius and an idiot.  It doesn’t help that I often have to fix code he wrote some time in the past decade, so I get to see both the bad and the good.

Oh, and another dude.  You got this, you did the right thing."
Futurology,fcuwany,t1_fcumame,1577989833.0,"48,000 is the number that totally snapped.  How many people suffered but didn’t kill themselves?"
Futurology,fcul6tl,t1_fcujvec,1577983438.0,"If I had to take a guess, probably like 60%, and I think I am totally low-balling that percent.  I’d say in my career, it has been about 14 out of 15.

UpliftingNews,fc6msbn,t1_fc5hd64,1577484285.0,"It was a great eisode though.  If you have Netflix, Hasan Minhaj’s show has an episode in season 5 about asylum that touches on Modi, Trump, and just a small bit of what is going on in northern India."
Futurology,fc14syp,t1_fc0xxgn,1577308269.0,"Fair enough, should have just said road instead of big road.  Main road probably would have been a better term, but yeah."
