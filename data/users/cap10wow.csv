Apparently my dad had anger issues and took out his frustrations on me. My mom left him because she thought he might kill me. Fun fact: I moved in with him at 15 because I didn’t get along with my stepfather(who ended up being a gay philanderer using my mom for a beard, but that’s a story for another day) and I cut school one time, my dad nearly beat me to death with a 2x6 bed slat. I fought back after literally having the shit beaten out of me and kicked him in the face and ran, barefoot, pantsless and shitty to my grandfather’s house 20 blocks away, hiding in bushes and the like as my dad circled the blocks in his car. My grandpa hid me in the basement and called my mother, who called the police, who didn’t want to get involved because my dad was an upstanding citizen and school board member. So, my mom was right."

MadeMeSmile,fggl6t9,t1_fggkc5k,1580764171.0,"Most and I do stress most, most towns have something like “community counseling” or something similar, you can get to see a therapist a couple times a month and they charge on a sliding scale, I’ve never paid more than $15 for a session. Group(talk)therapy is another option and that doesn’t usually cost much. Check your local churches/colleges for therapy or support groups. Even the AA weirdos won’t make you stand around in the cold. Just talking it out can do wonders. If, after exhausting all those options I’ve listed, you are unable to get help, then it’s a matter of “could”. Help is out there. Heck, help is in here. Typing out my story and interacting with you guys has been great, I took a 2 hour nap today."

MadeMeSmile,fgfz2y7,t1_fgfxv90,1580750728.0,"Eh. Life is fine if you don’t let it kill you. I had a few emotional issues and at 21 I was diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder. I got married, have a daughter, got divorced and met the love of my life. I struggled with self-medicating for years but now I can just enjoy a beer or two, smoke a joint if I get the urge. I don’t have to drink all the beer to quiet down the idiot screaming and negative intrusive thoughts. I’ve been a successful artist and musician and I’m well liked among my peers, even if I do slide into being a hermit sometimes, my music friends understand that I will be back when I’m up for it. For example, I started a new record around March last year and I have 11 tracks nearly finished but I don’t feel up to doing shows and all the self promotion that goes into putting a record out, but one day I will, and I’ll probably have another 2 albums worth of stuff to procrastinate with by then lol."
