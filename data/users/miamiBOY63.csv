I am a Biden backer, but if Joe Biden does not win the nomination I will be a Bernie voter or a Warren voter or a klobuchar voter, I'll even be a Mickey mouse voter if that means that we get this orange looking orangutan, wannabe lunatic dictator out of office in 2020."

I played college ball at a D2 School Many, many years ago and it was hard but real life is much harder"

All the drumpf administration did was waste our freaking tax dollars to feed his craziness and his obsession with the clintons and next it will be the obamas because he's obsessed with them also, he's just a crazed lunatic that needs to be voted out in 2020 along with his administration and some in his administration need to be investigated, but definitely William barr clearly has to be investigated!!"

I hate to say this but this is what I see in the people that actually like this guy or voted for him, to me they're just straight-up crazy people(not all) but you can't talk truth to them and you damn sure can't talk ""real facts"" because they don't believe in facts, it's like an alternate universe with these people it's a fucking cult so nothing you say that makes sense to the so-called normal person will make sense to these followers of the dear leader. This is not a joke and it's unfortunate that I'm saying this about our fellow Americans, these people are Cult like followers and believers of a dear leader just like the dear leader of North Korea or a dictator in the new USSR(Russia) named Vladimir Putin who is/was pulling the puppet strings of one Donald j drumpf."

Every red state senator needs to be primaried and the dccc need to get off their asses and put some strong Democratic candidates against these red state senators that are up in 2020 and beyond, any senator that does not vote to impeach the orange man is against freedom and democracy and for a dictatorship, because the orange man wants nothing more than to be a dictator and have a dictatorial administration. The orange man is an orange stain on America and it is time to vote his ass out in 2020, as a Democrat I welcome all Republicans, independents and any Democrat that was dumb enough to vote for this guy back to the Democratic party to get him out of office in 2020."

Ghosts,ff97ws9,t3_es2icu,1579706907.0,"To the person who posted this, the first thing you need to do is  not listen to a lot of people that come into these subs and not to comment on the commenters because you're wasting your time,more than likely they'll just keep coming back with more fake ass reasons why your videos/photos or anybody else's  are not real,anybody that posts photos or videos don't have to defend themselves, I understand just as these naysayers/skeptics should understand that people put these videos and photos out there not to be critiqued or ridiculed and if you don't understand this but some people come into these subreddit rooms to talk because they can't talk to anybody else such as family or friends because those people may think they are crazy because they don't believe in the paranormal. Anyone who's trying to DEBUNK is perfectly fine I do the same thing, but when there's nothing to debunk then that means something is going on. 
I'll let you in on a little secret nearly the same thing is and has been going on at my girlfriend's home but with her computer/s and portable landline phones, during a video my girlfriend was making at her home you can see the computer turning on and off and the tower can be heard beeping meaning turning on and off and at other times during the video/s you can hear the portable home phone beeping many times beep, beep, beep (and no the batteries in the phone are not dead they are fully charged) so I for one believe something is going on in your home until someone can prove otherwise (a real reason for this happening not a skeptic or non-believers reason for happening) so with what's going on within your home if things continue on the same path or even get worse you may have to call someone in to have your house cleansed or blessed (if it's poltergeist activity you have more problems) but please make sure you have it done by someone that is experienced, as a believer in the paranormal I'll tell you it is not something to be played with you need to take it seriously, good luck to you"

ParanormalEncounters,ff56pvw,t3_erekhx,1579581809.0,"I wouldn't listen to much to what people say about this could be the future or whatever, to me that is morbid and should not be said to you or anyone else. Maybe get online and see if anything pertaining to what you saw may have happened in your area since you have lived there or prior to you living in the area or neighborhood and see if you can find anyting. You could even go to the local library that is if there's any around and get on the computer and check archives of the area. Just a thought good luck"
ParanormalEncounters,ff56ht6,t3_erekhx,1579581618.0,"I don't know if anyone's ever mentioned this to you or not but you could be what is called a sensitive, a sensitive is a person that can feel, sense or even see spirits when no one else can and they feel the can interact with the living.I've seen shows and read books about some people that are sensitive and it sometimes becomes overwhelming and they have to tell the spirits to keep a distance from them or stay away so if this happens to you anymore I would suggest you get online and read about sensitive in the paranormal and learn about how you can use it as a gift."

Having a cat as a pet, a lot of people believe dogs are the best pets to have and in some cases they are but I grew up having both cats and dogs as I do now at 56 years old and we (my girlfriend and I) lost two cats one last year at 17 years old and the one prior five years earlier at 13 years old and believe it or not it hurt but it bothered me more because I saw how my girlfriend of 16 years took it and still takes the lost to this day. So anyone that reads this take care of your pets as you would a family member, because pets/animals deserve it and there are just too many people out there that don't do this. As I said prior my condolences to you and your wife and Godspeed."

For people that think dogs are the only pets that can make a person/people happy those people have never had a cat, I've had cats and dogs my whole life and you can't go wrong with either one or both and when you lose either one it can be and usually will be a devastating blow to a family or a person because a pet regardless of what type of pet it is that pet is or should be considered a family member, anyways that's how I feel about my pets.

Ghosts,ff35z3c,t3_er40nv,1579534484.0,"The smartest thing you did was take 2 of the same photos one which the shadow figure appears and another it doesn't and that's what paranormal investigators do, they take between 2 and 3 photos of the same area just to make sure that if there is any manipulation in one photo there may not be in any other photos. You also said your pet paraqites were making a lot of noise and that was very unusual for them to do that, animals do act quite differently when there is a paranormal episode happening, these are just some things that can/should prove your photo/sighting to be true. A word to the wise, I was very surprised to read a lot of the posts and for the first time in a long time most of them were positive because when I come into these paranormal/ ghost subs I usually see people making jokes of it or skeptics that wouldn't believe in anything paranormal even if an entity slapped them across the face.

Because when the playoffs come, the heat May face one of these teams like Brooklyn and what happens then?

Download the downloader app on your firestick, download filelinked get some filelinked store codes and pass codes(if needed) from YouTube and then from filelinked download cyberflix or typhoon TV those are the two I have and you get all the TV shows and movies your heart desires. but there are many, many other apks that you may like other than the ones I mentioned and most of them are very good. If you're new to the fire stick you will install and uninstall many, many apks/apps before you find the one/s you want to keep for movies and TV shows.

I'm sure I'm right when I say this, there's nothing that you or any other (right winger) will think is wrong or against the law if it has anything to do with your thinned skinned,spineless dear leader, the wannabe dictator, orange orangutan looking, dysfunctional, dangerous, delusional, brainless and last but certainly not least disgusting POS Donald j drumpf.

Zak bagans from ghost adventures has a lot of haunted collectibles John zaffis who worked with Lorraine Warren one of the most notable I guess demonologist / paranormal investigators in American history has or had a ton of haunted collectibles.

Paranormal,fesjfda,t1_fesfdao,1579365807.0,"What a spirit / entity can/will do when a person let's their guard down is something as simple as touching or scratching a person(this happens even when you have your guard up) to something as dangerous as an attachment or even a possession of a person, thats the very minimal to The very extreme and either one of these can and has happened to many, many people. So unless you're ready and wanting possible problems for days, weeks, months or even for the rest of your life I personally would not continue to interact with any entity or spirit take it for what it's worth you're playing with fire an your safety and health and well-being and eventually you will get burned. If you have pets such as dog/s or cat/s and you continue to interact with this entity/spirit and then you stop, it can/will take its aggression out on your pets, so like I said take it for what it's worth whether you listen or not that's up to you but like I've said before it's not a game to be playing with the paranormal."

And even if you truly believe this is a child spirit you need to keep your guard up and don't get or let this entity get too close to you meaning it's nothing to be playing games with they can be very serious. Just now at your young age but it could carry over for many years to come if not for the rest of your life, take this information for what it's worth and however you want I'm just a concerned older person trying to let you know it's not a game."
Paranormal,fes9anl,t3_eqfgex,1579362816.0,"I was reading some of the comments that you made and the one comment that got my attention was you said that you're not too fond of Ouija boards, I'm many years older than you are and please take it for what it's worth never, ever bring a Ouija board into your home or even use one anywhere else even if your friends think it would be cool because that one so-called cool thing could ruin your life, right now you may think it's fun and cool with what's going on and I don't want to scare you, but you may think you have a child Spirit / entity in your home but what some entities do is get the living person to open themselves up to the spirit by being nice and whatever else and in all actuality the entity / spirit is just being nice and interacting with you in order for you to trust it, so like I said take this advice for what it's worth from a much older person that knows a little bit about the paranormal due to going through it as we speak. Please do not interact with the spirit / entity and if possible turn on your phone recorder and also take some photos and maybe you'll get a photo or voices so you can show your mother that you're not going crazy LOL but do not take too many photos or voice recordings because that could also cause problems and good luck to you."

I strongly believe as a white man that there has been many lands within this country that have been cursed by the natives for what was done to them one day I hope probably not in my lifetime but I hope the natives get back the land/s which was rightfully theirs and that they rightfully still deserve. As I said in my prior post I don't understand the connection that I have with native culture for I am not any part native as far as I know. I have had the utmost respect for the native Americans ever since I was a child I'm 56 years old now and I still feel the same way, as I said in my prior post a lot of the respect comes from the way the native Americans treat the animals prior to and after death it just shows you how much respect they have for the Earth and its animals/creatures and that's the way I feel, but I don't hunt I just have love for animals and creatures and this Earth. Hopefully one day I can go to a real native ceremony and participate I live in South Florida between the miccosukee and Seminole but I don't I know if I'm allowed to participate and don't know who to contact to find out but I will look into it more because it's something I want to do before I go to the heavens."

The only thing I can say other than try it out yourself which I would not tell you to do is to read up on the Ouija board and things that have happened to people while using and after using them, unless you're a skeptic and don't believe in anything like this or in the paranormal then maybe you'll believe what you read for yourself. But either way just stay away."
democrats,fe3a5cf,t3_enn4p5,1578847403.0,"Donald j drumpf and his dirty ass administration officials don't want a nuclear pact with Iran, if you don't know by now Donald drumpf is a fucking racist he's anti-islamic, he's been wanting to go to war with Iran for whatever reason it doesn't matter, he's anti-immigrant(especially against brown people of any nationality not just South of the border), anti anything--but white (BTW I'm a white dude) lol. He surrounds himself with nothing but scumbag racists and the biggest scumbag is the fake Jew Stephen Miller he's a fucking disgrace to all jews, which I am one (non-practicing and non-religious) and he's  such a bitch that his own family has disowned/disavowed him. The only way we'll get a nuclear pact or anything else with Iran or get back to having close allies again is WHEN the demonic entity is voted out in 2020 so Donald j drumpf and your 3 little piglets(kids) don't let the door hit you in the ass in 2020 on your way out of Washington. hahahahaha."

POLITIC,fdzc130,t3_en8lfr,1578788632.0,"To the poster steam engine I've never been in this room and probably won't come back but if you can't tell that these people in here are anti-islamic by the way they talk and more than likely racist then I don't know what to say but the posts that I have read here probably from people that don't know the first thing about Islam as I don't know much about it either and they probably don't know the first thing about religion because if they knew anything about religion they wouldn't say Islam was the most brutal because I'm thinking of a little thing called the Spanish Inquisition but I guess it had to have happened within the past 40 years for any of these people to understand and know about it and throughout history Christianity has killed millions of people, people in here are saying that Islam says if you're not Islamic then you will die well I'm sorry to say the same thing happened with Christianity if you did not convert or believe in Christianity at that time they burned you at the stake, so actually they're two sides of the same coin when it comes to brutality. I also have Muslim neighbors and this family is an extremely nice family and I know they don't want to do harm or hurt anyone so I guess they might be the one Islamic family that doesn't? Just a thought"
Thetruthishere,fdz156s,t3_en6iy9,1578785633.0,"I just re-read your story and to me it sounds like a possible alien / UFO occurrence/encounter due to the blinding white light you said you saw and the loud noise and the distortion of the shape of whatever you  you saw, when things like this happen I have read that it happens in slow motion or it feels like slow motion. The best thing for you to do would get online and look for people that have been involved with an alien abduction I think you'll find what you're looking for, that is if you believe in this type of stuff because I do, to each his own, I say."
Thetruthishere,fdyzgb4,t3_en6iy9,1578785154.0,"You mentioned military one thing I will say IT WAS NOT MILITARY!!
A lot of times when people can't figure out what they have seen weather in the sky or on the ground or in the oceans they always fall back to saying that
""IT MUST BE MILITARY well it isn't and wasn't the military!! That's the same shit people say when they see UFOs, oh wait IT MUST BE MILITARY and no it was not and is not military!! I've read stories about people that have seen or say they have seen UFOs hovering above them and even landing and that they felt like they were in a magnetic fog and everything got real distorted but by the end of the story they were out cold and then woke up and everything was back to what they perceived as normal but most of the time when someone has an encounter with a UFO or if someone is abducted whether you believe in that or not I don't know, but most of the time they don't remember anything until they undergo some type of hypnosis."
Paranormal,fdymd2u,t3_ena49j,1578781298.0,"The best thing you ever did is never touched or got near another board and once again you come into a paranormal/ ghost sub for advice or to tell a story and run into people making jokes, I've wondered why the ones that come into the subs and act a fool don't get a Ouija board for themselves and ask the questions they want answered you know like about the lottery numbers? I can almost guarantee you if they were to get a board and start asking questions some of them would shit their panties and the ones that didn't believe before the board would have wished they never touched a Ouija board. But I'm also thinking the ones that act a fool are afraid to believe in the paranormal or to touch a Ouija board they'll say they're not but they keep flapping their gums. Continue to stay away from Ouija boards, it's not a game and actually can be dangerous and for people that know about the paranormal and have belief in it but also look to de bunk whenever possible understand what I'm saying, but the ones that think it's a joke or the paranormal is joke I would say The joke is on you."
democrats,fdyits3,t3_en8epq,1578780215.0,"Well Mike Lee, welcome to the world of the Democrats now you know how they feel when your dear leader withholds any and all information be it classified or not even though the top Democrats and even the gang of eight which include four of your own right wing nut bags have a right to see or here the info. So I don't feel too bad for Mike Lee or any other Republican that's faking there aggravation with Donald j drumpf. More than likely he and the other Republicans that are whining like the biatches they are will once again prostrate themselves and kiss the ring (probably fake like the fake man of year people magazine/cover hanging in his God awful looking drumpf tower condo) and lick the boots of Donald j drumpf."

Unless the people writing the history books are like Donald j drumpf and don't know anything about history and leave these parts out about kellyanne Conway."
