Except everyone in this thread knows that it's not called a hate symbol because ""people we don't like"" use it. It's called a hate symbol because it's been adopted as a dogwhistle-esque symbol for white nationalism and all that entails. To claim that people are calling ""people I don't like Nazis"" is to delegitimize and equate simple political disagreement with legitimate acts of Nazism. _That's_ why these people get called apologists, because that's what they're doing."
