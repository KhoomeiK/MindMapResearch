Between Raw/Smackdown that's 5 hours of wrestling alone. There's only so much wrestling non-super committed fans can watch per week.

It's probably your first point over and over."
funny,ffe0xvk,t1_ffdc76f,1579833855.0,You gotta learn my technique. Slide big toe of right foot down the left sock. When you get to your Achilles pinch your big toe to your second toe and hold as you slide it all the way off. Do the same thing with the left foot and then you'll have the socks inside one another.

They paid three Harvard scientists to shift the blame to fat, and then one of them became the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture; where the food pyramid dietary guideline was created."

DunderMifflin,ff52b52,t1_ff51hr4,1579578302.0,"You're vastly underplaying his reaction to those events. He goes from jovial, to silent, and his facial reaction drops when he's perturbed."
DunderMifflin,ff51ey9,t1_ff508z8,1579577629.0,"What? He absolutely conveyed visually that he was upset in being called Fat Halpert, being punched by Dwight (e.g. three hole punch Jim), and being called Tuna in varying degrees of uncomfortability."

DunderMifflin,ff4tuir,t1_ff4s3k7,1579572312.0,"He's well adjusted in the sense that he is more mentally and emotionally stable, but not in the sense that he's mature. To my first point, he is almost always used by management in decisions about others.

On the latter point, he's goofy and does pranks until he gets called Big Tuna to where he gets quiet and makes a weird face; instant demeanor change.

He's definitely more adjusted than Michael, Andy, or Dwight. (when he needs to be)"
DunderMifflin,ff4pnon,t1_ff4lf0o,1579569424.0,"He absolutely shows outright discomfort when he's called Tuna; In pretty much the same way Phyllis doesn't say anything when Michael or Packer say anything bad about her/her weight.

EDIT: or when Michael calls him Fat Halpert in S2E01; visibly upset about being called that."
DunderMifflin,ff4lmpr,t1_ff3j6yz,1579566595.0,"That was definitely a tongue-in-cheek joke that Pam and Jim told Dwight.

It was such a rediculous assertion that Dwight should quit to get back at Ryan/Michael. I don't know why people take it at face value...they even chuckled in a way to show that it wasn't a serious notion."
DunderMifflin,ff4l2z5,t1_ff4joua,1579566217.0,">Andy isn't the most self-aware person. If it doesn't seem obvious to him, he isn't going to notice. Especially in the beginning for his character. 

True, but at some point he has to notice Jim being uncomfortable about it. Andy also disregards anyone else's feelings but his own. People constantly tell him things and he does the opposite (e.g. you're not talented enough to do performing as a job) 

It is part of Jim's fault for not telling Andy to stop, but it's pretty obvious that it's also supposed to be a running gag on the show; to either be funny or show how annoying and persistent Andy is."
DunderMifflin,ff4jhgs,t1_ff4iosr,1579565096.0,"Yes, but it's so glaringly apparent that Jim does not liked to be called that. Andy either doesn't care that it bothers Jim or he's so self-absorbed and thoughtless that he doesn't even notice/consider it."
