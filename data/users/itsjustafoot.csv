insanepeoplefacebook,ff1t7kc,t1_fez66ar,1579485640.0,That’s super weird. My high school put baked chips and breakfast bars in the vending machine but didn’t change the lunch menu as much. You were just required to pick out a fruit or vegetable to check out.

I guess I mean changing how you see yourself? People who realize they’re trans instead of knowing it all along have to kind of come out to themselves, too. Idk"
asktransgender,ff1pgm5,t1_ff1fi8j,1579483261.0,That seems to be the general consensus— that people who are trans don’t share the same doubt and dread about it. I’m identifying as genderqueer right now because I just don’t know what this is honestly.
asktransgender,ff1opc4,t1_ff11hmt,1579482790.0,"Listen, I wrote this really sleep-deprived. My wording’s messed up but you know I mean transition, not gender identity.

I just read treble for violin and if I want to hear the bottom line I either translate it to treble or get my sister to play it on cello with me. Idk, we’ll see!
