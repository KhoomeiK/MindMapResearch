Easy answer. Google ""French Ruled Paper."" It's used for teaching kids cursive, but instead of cutesy letters that you copy, the paper is lined specially so that you can practice proper spacing and height of your letters. I personally used it for my print and my cursive, and I would 12/10 recommend it. Just Google it and print it out if you don't want to have to buy a notebook on Amazon.

Then for practice, start with practice by the letter, then by the small word, then start transcribing sentences from a book or song or something."

I'm not attracted to 1980s Arnold Schwarzenegger. But I eat very healthy and am active to some extent (usually walks, sports, mini home workouts, or yoga) every day. So I would want an SO who also enjoys eating healthy and staying active.

I also enjoy a video game every now and then. But it's mostly PC games, and I don't have the attention span or the ability to sit for long periods of time to call myself a ""gamer."" So while I could hold a relationship with someone who likes games, a relationship with a ""gamer"" who is always playing games wouldn't be as feasible.

But overall dude, the best way to get yourself a girlfriend? The same way you make friends. Be nice and approachable. Share interests, and show an interest in what they have to say. Listen first, and talk second. Spend time with them outside of the place you meet at. As long as you make friends with the intention of finding a girlfriend, you won't. Make friends with the intention of making friends, and you will stumble upon a girlfriend along the way."

BasicBulletJournals,fdljm0p,t1_fdlhe8q,1578525470.0,"I don't get why all your therapists are so reluctant to add routine. Any and all humans, even neurotypical ones, can benefit from a little bit of routine! Morning and evening routines bookend your day so life feels less chaotic. It's like the difference between a book separated into chapters, and a book that's just blocks of text. That blank end and numbered beginning gives each chapter more meaning, and separates the whole book out into piecemeal so I don't get overwhelmed!

In a way, I did find that mindfulness helped me with all these things, because being mindful about my what's and why's kept me understanding the point behind it all. I started stretching because I wanted to increase flexibility in my bad knees, so I gave myself an easy, definable goal and googled ""How to Do a Split."" Then I worked from there. Yoga I just looked around youtube until I came across a more calming channel that made all yoga feel meditative, which is what I needed (bohobeautiful).

But I also used mindfulness when I started to get overwhelmed. In college when there was too much info almost constantly, I'd open a window and focus on the feeling of the cold or hot air entering and leaving my nose. Or I'd do a couple doodles and pay close attention to how the ink flowed out of the pen. Or I'd stretch my senses out and acknowledge the sights and sounds around me, like the smell of coffee and the light chatter of the espresso machine in an empty Starbucks. And before any essays, I'd wander campus until I found a random space I could write, walk into the space, take a deep breath, and write for 5 minutes about what the room smelled or felt like. I still do that exercise today, over 2 years after graduation.

I definitely get how depression can be, and I'm really glad you like the info I can give. :)

I don't remember exactly when I got interested in plants. Probably a mix of Instagram, cute doodles of plants online, and this one TedTalk I saw about how 2 medium sized big-leafed plants can replace the air breathed by one average adult human. After that i bought a couple small plants, and i would just get so excited whenever i saw greener leaves or new growth. Like, ""I'm a good plant mom. I gave him what he needed and he grew big strong leaves. :) :) :)""

I think my current therapist is behavioral. I feel like she suggests some of the newer stuff like mindfulness and meditation because she's technically in the last year of her PhD program (she's supervised by a full licensed psychologist), so she's been taking in a lot of info and all those things are relatively new. She knows I prefer routines and solution-focused therapy.

My boyfriend does not believe in forcing others into his opinions. He does not believe in Nazism (he did a few years ago, but he grew a brain). He does not think we should be imprisoning families and separating parents from kids. He just spends too much time on ""all lives matter"" sites and thinks that trickle-down economics is a viable option for an economic system.

Nazis are terrible people and anyone who considers others to be lesser based off of their birth or religion is a bad person. That is one stance that no one can change my mind on. But you writing him off as a vile person that thinks he has any say in what I do with my body just because you heard he's a conservative and reformed alt-right is a good example of the ""Us and Them"" mentality that is preventing the world from coming together and fixing the shithole we call our world."

BasicBulletJournals,fdki2n0,t1_fdkhqx7,1578504289.0,"My best suggestion for *anyone* that's overwhelmed is to start with the absolute most basic system from bulletjournal.com on the getting started page. Do that for a little while until you can keep up with your bujo every day, and then start changing it based off of what YOU need. Not what Google images says you need. For example, I rarely plan more than a month ahead. So my future log is just a dated list. Make the basic system work for you."
BasicBulletJournals,fdkhna2,t1_fdke849,1578504062.0,"Sorry, but I have a lot of info for you and this will be a long comment.

So as for getting overwhelmed, my number one suggestion for anyone is to go back to the basics.  Go to bulletjournal.com and check out the getting started page. Ryder's original system works perfectly fine. Then, as you figure out what exactly you need, change up your journal to suit your needs.

For making a morning or nighttime routine, I'd recommend figuring out exactly what your ideal routine is, and then--over the course of 30 days--adding it in in chunks. Like maybe add brushing your teeth for a couple days, and then add stretching or yoga for a few days, and so on.

For what to include, the specifics depend on you. But from a generalized point-of-view, your morning routine should include:

-- something that will get you out of bed (for example, I make my bed and open my blinds so my plants can get light every morning)

-- a glass of water

-- a quick bujo check

-- hygiene (teeth, shower, etc.)

-- some form of exercise or stretching (get you to move around)

-- hair and skin care

-- a healthy breakfast

-- a mini daily win for various hobbies or goals you have (I take care of my plants and do a 5 minute writing prompt)

With this generic list your morning routine could be as long or as short as you want. You could in theory make it as short as 5-10 minutes.

As for an evening routine, you will want to include:

-- hygiene

-- hair and skin care

-- some form of physical detox from the day like stretching or yoga

-- some mental detox from the day like meditation or doodling

-- a glass of water

-- a plan for tomorrow

-- some goal or hobby daily practice, like reading or making a healthy lunch for tomorrow

-- the navy sleep technique. Go Google it, but in essence it's a meditative technique that was allegedly (because the studies are considered private government information so we've never actually seen them) created by the navy to help soldiers fall asleep in 2 minutes flat, even sitting up

Also make sure you go to bed and wake up at the same time every single day, about 8 hours apart. Humans are creatures of habit, and that's what we thrive on.

For a cleaning routine, I'd suggest googling the kid2kid cleaning schedule. It even gives you a cute little infographic.

For a life roadmap, I'd recommend googling the passion planner roadmap. It's a full planner, but I just use the roadmap (a mind map goal exercise for the next 3 months, year, 3 years, and lifetime). It'll give you a goal focus--something to work towards.

Plants vary. My spider plant is super easy to take care of. But since I live in a rainy area, my succulents need a grow light to get enough sunlight. I'd recommend googling each plant you have for care needs, and then always make sure they have the right amount of sunlight, the right amount of water, and a pot with a drainage hole. Everything else is just extra stuff you can do for it.

For mindfulness recommendations from my therapist, she actually gave me a handout. The bottom of the back page cites it as from *DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second Edition* by Marsha M. Linehan. But it's just a DBT skills overview and exercises handout. I'd highly recommend it if you can get your hands on it, though.

My therapist is actually the second one I've been to. I didn't like my first one because he just insisted that me hitting my head and needing stitches when I was 6 was the reason for all of my problems, and never offered any solutions. If you don't feel like you're getting anywhere, then find a new therapist.

The minimalist bujo Facebook group is definitely not minimalist."

bulletjournal,fdj8co4,t1_fdj7i16,1578461355.0,":)

I've used this system for 6 years now. 10/10 would recommend. But beginner tips:

-- Don't go ham. Start with Ryder's basic system, and then at the end of every day/week/month, do a mini mindfulness exercise: ask yourself if the things you are doing are the best option for you. For example, I almost never plan more than a month ahead. Don't need to. So my future log would be pretty much bare if I did it the way Ryder does, so instead I just have a list with a column on the left for marking the date. But his monthly log works perfectly for what I need.

-- It doesn't need to be pretty. If it's a total mess or filled with mistakes, then it reflects your own hot mess of a brain.

-- If you REALLY want to make your bujo all pretty-fied, my best suggestion is to Google a bunch of doodles. Like I love plants, so I googled how to doodle cute little ivy plants and aloe veras to draw on bookshelves if there's an open space. After enough practice it'll be like 30 seconds extra to add something that'll make you smile when you open your notebook.

-- Start your dailies with just 3 tasks per day. Only 3. A crucial thing, a decently important thing, and an errand. Once you can check off all three every single day, THEN add a 4th or a 5th task.

--  At the core of it all, it's a mindfulness-based mental organization system. Not an art project. Form your base before you add the decoration."

The difference here between you and me, however, is that we make sure to be absolutely respectful (you sound respectful, so I'm mostly referring to your bf), no matter how heated the debate gets. AND he does not write me off when I get emotional as ""why you can't argue with liberals.""

But if you want like specific spreads or something, i can definitely do that.

My therapist really wanted me to track my sleep using the sleep diary from the National Sleep Foundation, so I made it part of my weekly. Sleep diary in the morning, evening, and then also sections for nutrition and exercise, since she recommended I move more and eat less salt or sugar. If you want to try the sleep diary I'd recommend it--it's cool to see. You can just Google it it'll be the first pdf that pops up.

I also take notes from sessions in my bullet journal, and I use a basic form of a habit tracker to try to get a morning and evening routine going, so I can have a sort of bookend routine to give my mind structure and a mental break at the beginning and end of a day.

Also I have a care line for my plants in all my dailies. Ever since I told my therapist how much taking care of things like plants and pets calms me (sadly right after my baby precious kitty Mittens died), she's been pushing me to get more plants and take care of them. It's been helping a lot, since I also have to wake up early to open the blinds for them and having something who's well-being I care about has given me a bit more of a need to care about the well-being in myself.

As for specifically Mindfulness as the concept we've been working on, this week my homework was to work on my observing skills for ""coming back to my senses,"" so I've been journaling the things I observe when I practice the skills.

But after a few months of oof, we both realized he was much more my brother than my boyfriend. So he's been my best friend ever since. And every time I meet a guy that I could potentially date--without fail--i tell them about my ex-turned-bff and I introduce them. My ex and I are super close. Like hugs and cuddling and shizz, cause we were dating for 5 years, so physical contact like that and inside jokes are to be expected. But I just genuinely don't see him like that anymore.

Some guys I meet are uncomfortable. Some are jealous. Some claim to be fine with the friendship but then are aggressive towards him when they see us hug. I always start a relationship with one rule: my ex will always be a large part of my life. If they have a problem with it, I leave.

Currently the guy I'm with is completely fine with my friendship with my ex. To the point where my ex had to work during one of our weekly meetups and my bf asked if everything was okay between us and if there was anything he could do.

Tl;dr speaking as a woman in Emily's position, don't pull back just so she can get a date. No matter how many men she may go through before she finds a good one--one, ten, two hundred, whatever--you will be her constant and her rock to remind her what she deserves in life."

Once it's a habit, recognize what works and what doesn't work for you. Adjust what doesn't work, and keep what does. For example, I plan more than a month ahead so rarely that my future log is just a column for a month/day and a column for a list of events. No sectioning out needed. But I also know that Ryder's monthly log system works great for me, so I adjust it very little, and only when my notebook is too short to fit all the days. And his habit tracker system is all I need, so I keep that one too.

It's all about going back to the basics and then recognizing what YOU need your bullet journal to do. I need a streamlined, fast-to-use system that my ADHD brain can mold whenever it feels like a change. You may need something boxier. And that's okay. Do what works for you."

AskReddit,fcm5ubv,t1_fcm5ejq,1577765006.0,"Yes, hence why the myplate recommends more veggies than fruits. But fruits are still natural energy boosters and are a good thing to have in your diet.

Plus, fruit sugars and added sugars are made of different molecules, and added sugars affect your insulin levels much more than natural fruit sugars. Fruit also (like a vegetable) makes you feel full faster than junk foods, so you eat more proportionate servings. And really, fruit is a better snack than an entire family size bag of cheddar and sour cream ruffles, so"

antiMLM,fc8zk4n,t1_fc7p54o,1577544619.0,"My town has two malls, and mall A was the more popular one because it had a good food court and a movie theater that played films about to go on DVD for $1.50 (great for teens or dates). Mall B was just standard and didn't have anything interesting going for it. Theater, food court, spot for Santa, decent stores, etc. So it was pretty ignored.

Then a couple years ago, the heads of mall A decided they wanted to appeal to a higher class group in order to get more money. So they cut the lease with the $1.50 theater, shut down the food court, remodeled it into being more of an outdoor mall (in a town well known for rain and cold weather), and leased out to more snooty or Karen-attracting stores like H&M or Marshall's. They spend a LOT on this remodel. My construction friend installed the benches that were tens of thousands of dollars EACH (sadly they didn't listen when he said to seal the tropical wood, so when the next rain hit about a month later the really pretty wood color faded to a grayish brown).

They also took their regular movie theater and upped the rent a lot, so the theater had to compensate by raising prices a lot.

Mall B is very popular nowadays."

The minimum recommended amount of exercise to be coupled with a healthy diet per week is: twice of strength training per muscle group, 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardio (or 75 minutes of high intensity cardio), and a day of recovery. Along with a minimum 5-10 minutes of stretching per day, or 10-15 minutes minimum if you want to increase flexibility.
