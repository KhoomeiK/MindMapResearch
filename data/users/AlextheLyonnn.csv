What was stupid was staying there for so long in the first place. I dreaded going to sleep because then I'd have to wake up, and once I woke up, I'd just anxiously count down the hours. I couldn't enjoy myself. My days were 11am-11,pm but add in shower time and commute... 9am-12am.

Often while waiting for my bus, I'd think about jumping in front of it instead of getting on. I had a breakdown TWICE during my shifts, two weeks apart. I spoke to my boss who was very understanding and supportive, and asked if I just wanted to work a different position. No. I want to get out of this toxic hellhole. So I did.

My girlfriend understood. Everyone else told me to suck it up.


Well, now I don't talk to those people and I work a job with a set schedule that respects I need a life outside of work. 7am to 2pm, depending on how fast I clean up my station. The cooks aren't arguing and trying to be better than each other, they help each other, they communicate properly. I'm HAPPY to go in, not fucking miserable.

I thought I was an ungrateful, spoiled brat for so long, because my parents fed and clothed me. I couldn't understand why I didn't feel loved, I thought there was something wrong with me. I thought the hitting and yelling and berating was just normal. I thought that the fact I had to apologize to my parents for them doing me wrong was okay.

That sub woke me up. I was a child. I was curious. I watched my movies and did my homework. I wasn't disrespectful for asking questions. I wasn't ungrateful when I didn't want my parents inserting themselves into my life. I wasn't spoiled for asking for one gift for my birthday and one for Christmas. I was a child.

Some stories may be fake but, you don't know. You really, really don't know the extent of the abuse until you've lived it, and gotten away. I no longer feel afraid to stand up for myself.
