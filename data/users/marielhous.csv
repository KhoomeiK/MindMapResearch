realhousewives,fc6e0hm,t1_fc6dgqv,1577478342.0,I havenâ€™t proven your point whatsoever. Iâ€™m going to go ahead and believe the actual lawyers I spoke to rather than Wikipedia and your second hand knowledge.
realhousewives,fc6cq3b,t1_fc6blzc,1577477494.0,"So as someone who was born in Canada, is a permanent resident in the US and talked to lawyers about what happens to my Canadian citizenship if I naturalize I can tell you that you that even now you swear an oath renouncing your former citizenship but they no longer require you to forfeit your foreign passport. 

Tina Turner was born in the US, Joe was born in Italy- opposite citizenship issue. 

And again, the law has changed since 2008 when I was talking to lawyers."
realhousewives,fc6a73d,t1_fc5u0hb,1577475832.0,"Youâ€™re quoting the opposite situation. When youâ€™re sworn in as a US citizen you renounce your previous nationality. Also, being born to parents that are US citizens is a different situation than naturalizing as a permanent resident."

realhousewives,fc4hjax,t3_eg5c9e,1577416834.0,For a long time the US didnâ€™t recognize dual citizenship and not everyone wants to give up their nationality. By the time the US did start recognizing it (fairly recently I believe) he might have just not gotten around to it.
