explainlikeimfive,ff5x83m,t1_ff5w4h0,1579613257.0,"Fuel consumption is responsible for torque on a conventional vehicle as well.  Torque is rotational force.  Rotational force spins the wheels, which then creates velocity.  Adding more torque will, indeed, make you go faster (to an extent).  You need torque to counteract gravity and friction keeping the vehicle stationary.  As the vehicles gains momentum, speed increases as well.

Think about the gears on a bike.  You have great difficulty getting that much mass moving at high gear, so we start at a small gear.  The small gear rotates a lot of times for each single rotation of the tire.  This is a torque conversion.  It allows the engine (your legs, in this case) to not have to work as hard to get started.  However, even at top RPM, of that gear is spinning 10 times to every 1 rotation of the tires, you may be producing a whole lot of torque, but not a lot of speed.  So what do you do?  Shift to a higher gear.

Now that you have some momentum to help the engine out, you can shift to a higher gear (and lower ratio).  Now, at top gear, you might only be turning that gear at 1 rotation for every 1 or 2 rotations of the tires.  It takes less energy now because you have already overcome the inertia of the vehicle (or bike), and now just need to fight against friction (which is very low on wheels).

Electric vehicles don't have a traditional transmission like a gas vehicle, and the exact gear mechanism varies depending on manufacturer and how many electric motors there are, but it is generally a similar concept to convert raw torque to overall velocity."

Air can be thought of like water; it will take the path of least resistance.  A big long straight area will keep a current following that path.

Also, large bodies of water do have a cooling affect.  They will cool and make the air heavier (humidity) and that can change the weather pattern and course as well."

LifeProTips,fenbzpz,t1_fen9l60,1579281432.0,"I think we were talking about virtually the same thing.  I use low gear because it prevents high speed, but also kicks out more torque when I need it (low gear/engine breaking is also a great way to help slow down on sheet ice and really slippery roads).  I would say Economy mode simply prevents a driver from overtly doing something that would cause traction loss, rather than outright helping the situation.

But a driver experienced in slick conditions probably doesn't care either way."

Most would consider Latin American Spanish a descendant of Spanish, and therefore call it European.  But some people want to make that distinction more pronounced for whatever reason at the time, so they seperate Spanishes by spoken region, not region of decent.

The difference is only based on the current discussion."
LifeProTips,fen6els,t3_eq20ys,1579277985.0,"I think that learning how to drive your vehicle in snow and ice, and knowing how it handles, far surpasses any built-in ""traction control"" features.  For example, on most new vehicles, there is a feature that will detect if you are sliding, and will disable the gas pedal (that is, you can't accelerate during a slide).  In theory,it is a good idea to keep inexperienced drivers out of trouble.  However, if you have a front or all wheel drive vehicle, you actually want to be able to tap the gas a bit to correct the slide.

I like the feature for that split-second between when I start to slide and when I start to correct, but other than that, I can control the vehicle better if the engine keeps putting out torque when I want it to.

For slowing down and starting on slick conditions (and climbing hills sometimes), shift into a lower gear.  You want more power over less rotations (i.e. more torque) to better control your vehicle.

If you drive rear wheel, stay at home."
