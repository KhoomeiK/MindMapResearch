BlackPeopleTwitter,fd9oztl,t1_fd9m5qq,1578236263.0,"Absolutely. This is the drum I was beating when I was teaching. I knew plenty of smart, decent, hardworking young people who had no business going to college right out of high school & yet that's all high schools were pushing (here). 

When I say no business going to college I mean that it wasn't right for them at that time, not that they weren't 'good enough'-- they were wonderful young people who I loved and who had, and still have, lots of potential. I just mean, if you don't like reading and doing assignments and listening to teachers talk, you probably won't like college. No judgement; I knew lots of kids like that. They were still excellent people! They can do very well running their own business in the trades or similar.

College is just one thing. It's not the best thing or the only thing or the standard by which all other things should be judged.

relationship_advice,fd9mvij,t3_ekcp1f,1578235487.0,"How about this: start paying attention to what you're thinking about when there's no dudes around. Probably a range of things: working out, not working out, eating stuff, school things/work things, stuff you've seen, etc.

But try to notice what you do with your brain when there's not dudes around. 

Then do two things:

One, call those things into your mind when you're finding yourself distracted into the ""and then we'll be like..."" game with a random stranger. Focus your mind on what you're gonna wear with your new shirt or why fall smells the way it does or whatever else you would normally think of if he weren't there. 

Two, recognize that unless a person is actively looking to meet a stranger as a potential partner, the above, what I just suggested you do, is what they're doing. The guy on the bus is not thinking about maybe falling in love with you. He's thinking about whether he can sneak a fart out or if a shark would beat a tiger in a fair fight. 

Also, when you do engage with strangers, don't always gravitate towards the guy your own age. Turn the other way and talk to the mom lady in line at the store or chat with the old man sitting next to the sugar and cream table at the coffee place. Lots of people are interesting and worthy of your consideration even though they may not be potential romantic partners. Strangers can make your life richer and bring interesting details into your life--but the idea that one of them is going to be your man & you're going to spot it before it happens is misplaced energy. 

I can relate to what you described. Try to live in the moment and focus on your own individual self in your thinking. You're not an US that's waiting to happen. You're YOU that IS HAPPENING."

Idk I feel like explaining how orgasms vary in intensity & degree of satisfaction might make it clear to him, but honestly I don't believe that as I say it, because how can he not understand this? 

The other thing I was going to say was have you tried watching porn with him where guys are going down on women? That way you could talk him through it before he tries it, in a way. Like ""see how he's doing a finger at the same time? That feels amazing,"" etc. 

There's been a lot of focus on this in your marriage.  The stakes are high for him. If you want him to potentially get over his fear of doing it, if that's what this is, then make the likelihood of him being successful greater.

relationship_advice,fcn6gaq,t1_fcn4tx1,1577804512.0,"Then I'm in agreement with you; I think it's fair and healthy to have friendships outside of marriage. 

I didn't say you can't ever complain about your wife to others, by the way. It's normal to occasionally gripe about your spouse. It's just that those gripes should go to a select few friends, not exes or the opposite sex friends your spouse feels threatened by. Which it sounds like you understand that. 

I think you should talk to your wife and work on communication generally. It's the hardest thing about relationships like marriage, I think most couples work on it all the time to one degree or another. 

But there are a million good resources out there for how to disagree without fighting, how to understand and be understood, good communication practices for couples etc. Find one or more & get her to agree to a set of guidelines (I statements, reflective listening I think it's called or whatever else you like that's out there), and then get to work discussing fears and needs and working out parameters you can both live within comfortably."
relationship_advice,fcn4fzb,t3_ei2w5f,1577802987.0,"Your wife is being childish, but it's somewhat understandable because you're young. 

She feels insecure in your relationship in that she's threatened by the possibility that you get anything from another woman that she's not giving you, afraid that other women know a you that she does not know. 

You have the right to continue and maintain appropriate friendships even once you're married. I am married, I have male friends, one of whom is an ex. But there's a line I don't cross in my relationship with him; I don't vent problems in my marriage to exes or friends of the opposite sex (for the most part). 

I'm not sure what you meant by all the drama of Christmas, but if you're venting about your current wife to another woman, that's not cool. If you're venting your baby mama drama and normal adult shit to a friend who knows all your backstory, that's fine in my book. The answer to which you were doing is important for me to figure out how far off the mark I think your wife is--a little or a lot.

Language is one of the things that sets us apart from other animals. They experience the world through their senses and interpret it as feelings; responses of the nervous system to the environment. Do they have rich inner lives? Possibly, but that's not the point. 

You do. You have not only a bunch of shit going on inside you in response to your environment, such as ""I'm cold, my butt itches, all these people are making me nervous, oh, that guy reminds me of my Dad, this cake is tasty...."" BUT you also have the ability to communicate any or all of that to someone else, using language, which most humans acquire easily and use well for basic communication by age 5-6. That is to say, by late childhood, most people can describe the world around them and the world inside of them in a way that's comprehensible to others without much effort (I know this varies, but compared to not being able to use language at all, it's very easy for most of us). 

In addition to that, you have the ability, with some additional effort, to describe or otherwise communicate completely novel or abstract concepts, or ephemeral and fleeting thoughts and feelings, to other humans. Is it imperfect? Sure. But is your idea more developed for having made the effort to put it into the right words, or less so? Things become concrete as they are spoken. The word is a creative force.

And yes of course there is the receiver to consider. That's why writing is good practice for communication--because if you find that much of what you're trying to get across is lost in translation, as you say, or in transmission, that suggests that additional effort to clearly put your thoughts into words would be beneficial for you.
