UFC3,fegxuii,t3_eox6c2,1579104944.0,"when you went to side control and then went straight for half guard, that was the wrong move.

When you get to side guard, wait. What you should assume is everyone in side guard is either going to go for crucifix or smash your face in with elbows, so i always hold RT (im Xbox) so i can quickly deny the curifix if needed but, im also watching and waiting for them to throw an elbow too.

If they throw a strike, as they throw it (quickly release RT) and go for sprawl.

Now you wait and again, hold RT.

Wait for them to strike your body, if you feel fast enough go on the first body shot they throw, if not, wait for the second, or third if you want and like in side control, wait until its midstrike and hasnt connected and go Over under.

You'll get up real quick into the clinch without loosing much stamina and without taking any major damage (You can also try a getup move but i always go over under).

its all just timing and reflexes, comes with practice. Be patient on the ground, let them work, they cant hurt you unless in crucifix of postured up so be calm, deny what you can, throw a few strikes yourself so it helps you transition a bit quicker and with practice you'll get better.

Hopefully all this makes sense lol, And helps

&#x200B;

Edit - Also when in crucifix, its a risky move but.. hold RT and try to time their strike by flicking left/right when they are midstrike. You'll notice a pop up for ""side control"" will appear real quick when they strike so if you can time it, you'll kick out into side saddle i believe? and take some of their stamina down too. And your face doesnt get smashed :)"
