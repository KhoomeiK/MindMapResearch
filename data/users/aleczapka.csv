The paper: [Neutrinos in an expanding Universe](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/633/1/012034/pdf)

My understanding of it:

- Neutrinos are only subject to the weak force and to gravity (""the gravitational clustering of relic neutrinos inside and around galaxies."")

- Pauli Exclusion Principle: you can't put too many in too small space (""there is a maximum to the number of fermions that can be squeezed into a given volume"")

> ""How does nature prevent violation of the Pauli principle in degenerate matter? In shrinking White Dwarfs, the electrons are forced into increasingly higher quantum states. The higher the quantum state,the higher the velocity, and thus the pressure that can be exerted by these electrons on the outside world, in this case the outside layers of the collapsing star.""

> ""[...] Preventing such a violation could be achieved if space-time around this center-of-mass were **negatively curved**""

> ""**The Equivalence Principle implies that any massive object in the gravitational field created this way would experience the same consequences as if a negative mass were placed in the center-of-mass of the galaxy cluster. The galaxies constituting the cluster would thus experience a repulsive force driving them away from their common center-of-mass**""


> [...]  If our model is correct, this value (neutrino mass) must be about 0.5 eV/c2


My questions:

1. Is this model good candidate to explain the expansion of the universe without dark matter/energy?

2. How far are we from measuring definitive mass of a neutrino?

3. Assuming the model is correct, would it be good explanation for the universe inflation?
