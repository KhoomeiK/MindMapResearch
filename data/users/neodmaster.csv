ChronicPain,ff9qml3,t3_esb1ay,1579718833.0,"Have tou tried Quetiapine for the sleep issues?

I am totally intolerant to most anti-depressants and yet Quetiapine was a life saver for me, even tough I had to begin in almost ridiculous amounts, I’ve raised my tolerance and I am taking 3/4 of 25mg, which is the lowest dose. It really helps and works much better than those horrible sleeping pills which I never could tolerate."
anxietysuccess,ff3nnhy,t3_eqq905,1579544929.0,"Yeah. Anxiety is a crazy situation for the mind/body connection. I can attest to this. I’m healing from an old bullying trauma and the nervous discharges are crazy enough too.

I believe it can be healed more and more. Possible underlying trauma is causing the continuing system overload for many persons.

Also, I believe Anger is a necessary and effective step to get out of the lower levels of angst and despair."
traumatoolbox,ff2twuh,t3_eqyagu,1579524002.0,"Hi. I have an idea for you... Watch the series Sex Education on Netflix, its not a documentary, its a series but I’m sure you will identify and feel things better while watching. Also... Don’t binge watch, watch just one per day or two days and dwell a bit on the subjects."
depression,feyaa77,t1_fewqrfs,1579442906.0,"Yes. I can attest to this. Trauma might be the most impactful thing to bring and maintain depression. I don’t believe human beings are as broken as to have this mental malaise as frequently as it does. I am on a mental detox on my therapy (its getting to a good place and uncovering a lot) from bullying trauma and the curtain is slowly uncovering with brutal symptoms of nervous discharge from the layers of abstraction stored in some part of my brain. I can feel this now, the slow recovery and the sick input from the old neural networks that contribute to the sickness and tiredness and weird thinking. As to how I will end up, I don’t know, I’m pretty broken physically and morally from years of this fibromyalgia like symptoms and management but the trauma is real, and recovery seems possible now."
depression,fejoz36,t3_epe2m7,1579182059.0,"Its a cool analogy, especially the part where the reality is that there is an actual bar that goes all the way to Full! No matter the hopelessness, no matter the pain, no matter the ups and downs, the truth is that there is a concrete Well Being on the high ranges of the bar and with patience you can get there more and more. Is it a bitch that you are currently of the lower end of it? Yeah, there’s no doubt about it, but can you change the situation with time and persistence... yes indeed, and that is a much better alternative than sliding to a further lower scale all the way down to the reserve levels."
cfs,feertlk,t3_eoi1ej,1579039849.0,Chi Kung is quite helpful for me. Its very gentle and soothing. I get a nice perk up after class.
cfs,feer9y0,t3_eonrs0,1579039520.0,"Hi! Anxiety and PTSD (Bullying Trauma) here.

My news is that you can recover from the lowest valleys of energy drain. Regarding the pain and how well it works on your system that’s other story but indeed, general energy can be regained by lowering your anxiety levels. As for meds I would advise asking for Buspirone (low side effects, no sedation, low addiction) to clear most of the anxiety. After that you can think a bit more clear and maybe get some professional help for the PTSD. Trauma can be a bitch to handle but its better to take the brunt of it while trying to work trough it than just be a live spectator of the freak show.

NevilleGoddard,fed5p1y,t3_eoh6dk,1579000144.0,"Amen to that! Keep pushing the edge people! The outer edge of your sensorial and emotional experience is there to be pushed out, further and further."
SuicideWatch,fe7tfod,t3_dqbyn3,1578919089.0,"Quetiapine is a great medication, god knows I’ve tried a bunch of shit to stabilize my sleep issues. I’m quite sensitive chemical so I take a small dose that feels like a lot more. You should trust that a stable med every day is the best option for you, even if you have weird feelings and all that. There’s this place inside you that knows that you want to be better and, damn, that’s the good place to be in. I can’t offer you more than my extreme sympathy and hope that you can find a more stable place each and every day, a bit more peace, a bit more clarity. Aim for it, the body wants to heal, the mind wanders trying to find meaning. Guide the wheel to turn it into the little better feelings as you can. Wish you the best."
lawofattraction,fdxc82e,t3_en2x1r,1578767339.0,"Yes! Thank you indeed for that reminder of the infinite potentials of nTh chances! No matter the past, no mater the story, no matter the physical endurances, all is energy and energy can be calibrated to a better and happier frequency! 

Energy->Emotional->Mental->Physical"
depression,fdwq9tx,t3_en5tmg,1578761351.0,"The default is the default for your current issues. The default can be changed with patience. There is no default in your brain, its just learned patterns. Saying Life default is sadness is like saying kids should be sad and angry and in disgust all day, which is obviously wrong. So, be sad, if you really must. but don’t add further than sadness as such."
depression,fdwhtbt,t3_en7336,1578758824.0,"Confusion is always a great first step to recovery! If you’re 50/50 (growth/stuckness) congrats because the ratio could be a lot worst, you just need to increase to 60/40 and edge it day by day until you get some good thrills going as your approach 80/20. At that point there is no more temptation to return to the dark side, just bumps in the road."
traumatoolbox,fdvuhp9,t3_en5rk6,1578751645.0,"1) Find a Great Therapist
2) Take your time to evaluate therapy options
3) Choose one
4) If after 3 months things don’t go that great then CHANGE THERAPIST - use grain of salt on this step, you might just be resistant 
5) Repeat until you find a Great Therapist"
depression,fdnrkpm,t3_emaudf,1578591428.0,"The personality is under the covers I assure you. For example I was okay 20 minutes ago then got a bit extra tired walking and bang, depression symptoms hit. Just like that, when you get better its like pathways get forged and sometimes the old triggers and old neurons lets say, fire away and you think you are under the bottom line but its not.

We can really get better. Takes a PITA of patience, oh yeah, no doubt, but it can indeed get better."
