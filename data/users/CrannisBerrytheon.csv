VirginiaPolitics,ffbmiee,t1_ff9pmdl,1579772732.0,"No other state has passed legalization though the legislature. All other legalization attempts have been through referendums, which Virginia doesn't have.

They can't sell weed in the ABC store or Virginia would be violating federal law.

They could make it legal to possess and handle the retail later. That is the easiest and most just approach, and there's no excuse for them about needing to set up a retail framework for it. But I honestly think they'll keep pushing it back indefinitely just like a bunch of states have. It's a nice carrot to have on the end it their stick.

Call me cynical but I don't think a bunch of moderate white Democrats really give a shit about liberating minorites and poor people from the drug war, which imo is the major reason to support legalization. In the moderate mind, weed is less of a social justice issue and more of personal choice issue so it's not important to them.

Weed is still scary to middle class soccer moms and old people. And that takes priority over everything else. That's why they'll go 10% of the way with decriminalization. It makes the moderate white people feel nice and accomplished without being scared, and keeps cops happy because they can still use weed as an excuse to pull people over."
