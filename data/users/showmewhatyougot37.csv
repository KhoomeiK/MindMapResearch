POTUSWatch,ff5xnny,t1_ff37yxt,1579613630.0,He means the house of representatives. It's a lie of course. He ordered Bolton to not testify.

Who wants to swim in that filthy water anyway?"

books,fe0z12i,t1_fe08urc,1578820572.0,"I found this quote recently.

>Don't read Kerouac when you're too young. Read him as you join that long death march called steady employment. Then look back. Look back to all the people you knew, those people who went here and there, those people who knew odd patches of philosophy and poetry. They fucked. They doped andk boozed in desperate self medication. Look back at yourself. Jack travels here and there. He knows people with Odd Knowledge. They have plumbed the breadth and depth of human existence. They get laid in the era before The Pill. They doped and boozed. They had the Knowledge. Read Kerouac and look back. And then it occurs to you. It's all been done before. None of your old pals will ever be quite what he once was in your memory. And you'll know Kerouac for what he was. And you know that amidst all the lies, he told the truth. The truth with a little 't'. He wanted to fool you, but he couldn't. It wasn't in him; he hadn't the talent for it. He had only enough to tell you the way he had wanted it to be. How he wanted it to be when he looked back on it.[6]""

penguins,fdzrv90,t1_fdzbecc,1578794335.0,I was going to customize it but I've grown to like the blank. Do you have the diagonal Pittsburgh? That's my favorite behind the robopenguin.

Popefacts,fdx9us2,t3_enakaz,1578766750.0,">Innocent also expresses a desire for peace (possibly unaware that in the Mongol vocabulary, ""peace"" is a synonym for ""subjection"").

AskReddit,fdp3zm5,t1_fdp3nqu,1578619457.0,Except for the fact that he had hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of depts paid off without explanation. But I guess making money corruptly off of your office is par for the course with Republicans now.
penguins,fdnf7rk,t1_fdmx7al,1578584526.0,"Eh, lacking the daily bumps and bruises that come from hockey make me consider him better off. Not having a tweaked ankle, wrist, and shoulder after the long season will hopefully pay off."

todayilearned,fcjxs30,t1_fcjem71,1577709697.0,"He made up facts but you comparing automobile regulations (mandatory classes, licenses, tests and yearly inspection's) with firearms(MAYBE a background check) is disingenuous at best. You're comparing something designed for transportation with something designed for killing. I own my fair share of firearms(and vehicles, though fewer) and you speaking of echo chambers while spewing this nonsense is embarrassingly ridiculous."

He has direct lines to the combatants so he could actually threaten them without a bullshit tweet. But then that would be accomplishing diplomacy and give nothing for his supporters to claim he did."
