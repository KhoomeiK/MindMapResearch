It is very uncharacteristic of me to support anything Trump does, given that the side of me that I need to suppress every day by the desire to be better than criminals wants him at the end of a noose after trial for crimes against humanity.

And the comparison with the failed coup in 2002 is less helpful. The elections turnout was high, and this was also much more directly involved with the military in a few limited hours inside the walls of the president's palace. Guido isn't getting the support of the military to enforce his will, what he needs is the infrastructure to hold a new election, which is plausible to some degree given that the electoral guys held a referendum for the national assembly in 2017 producing strong majorities but little turnout for the opposition. 

He could plausibly even not arrest Maduro, or punish him in any way, and he also worked on a bill to give very broad amnesty, and this behaviour isn't unprecedented, and is actually something that Chavez asked for during that coup back in 2002 to be able to go to Cuba.

Juan Guido is doing this publicly. He needs the public to vote for a new president and possibly some constitutional amendments such as making the confirmation of the presidential cabinet dependent on national assembly votes, forbidding constituent assemblies without the proposal to do so permitted by a referendum, forbidding presidents from more than two terms of 4 or 5 years not 6 year terms, and likely strict limits on rule by decree, likely not actually running himself given that he himself isn't particularly popular or notable. He also importantly needs the turnout to be high enough to give it legitimacy in a way that the 2017 referendums were not strongly supported. 

In a democratic country, the military should be almost irrelevant. Going abroad should be rare and with minimal involvement, and some democratic countries basically don't do it at all. The military does some natural disaster relief too but nobody needs to give them authorization to do so, anyone is entitled to dig Newfoundland out of the snow with this blizzard if they want to. The police should also be doing the same in a democratic country and can't be enforcing opinions or be using force more than anyone else has the right to do. In a true democracy, getting their support as a political constituency should be irrelevant."

Chavez conducted many social programs, and many good things can be said of these programs. But Chavez did not make most of his programs go by a legislature as an act of law, he was given strong decree powers, the constituent assembly in 1999 stripped the legislature of impeachment powers, and the party he lead was and is a democratic centralist one that applies discipline in a particularly harsh way, even on people who aren't the legislators but simply members of the party, and assigns strong power to the president of the party and not to a strong elected and numerous body in contrast to the socialist parties of many of the socialists in democratic countries like the SP of the Netherlands.

And in 2002, it's not clear as to how much control the US had over them. Venezuela still had a general strike going on at the same time, the government was getting increasingly unpopular. The guy who claimed the interim presidency however did not have the power to claim that the constitution was suspended."
canada,ffun9z3,t1_ffttf04,1580245545.0,"That's debatable. 

In the narrative of the opposition, the National Assembly won a vote in 2015 to name them the parties in control of the National Assembly, receiving collectively 56% of the vote and about 65% of the seats, with a turnout of 74%, to be more precise,  7,728,025 votes. They elected Juan Guido as the president, or speaker, of the National Assembly. In 2018, Maduro won 67% of the votes in a commonly boycotted election with 6,245,862 votes and a turnout between 25 and 46% of the vote depending on who is doing the counting.

This causes the National Assembly to have the most recent highest tally of votes in favour when considering turnout and actual votes for who. 

To them, the president never had a legitimate election, given the deliberate boycott by the opposition when the president had stacked the court with judges loyal to him and conducted a constituent assembly which illegally assumed the powers of the national assembly and which was elected with virtually none of the opposition standing candidates nor voting. Ergo, if there is no legitimate president of Venezuela, and who is therefore unable to name an executive vice president, then the presidency of Venezuela is vacant and ergo the president of the national assembly is the next in line for succession, and there should not be worries about the legitimacy given that once this new president assumes control, they are obligated to call an election to occur within 30 days to choose in a direct ballot a real president of Venezuela.

Should this type of body exist? 

I am suggesting that waiting for an election to prosecute such an official can be a risk, firstly to our idea of the rule of law and how everyone is subject to it, second, because the crimes that may have been committed may impact the ability to hold them accountable through other ways such as if electoral fraud is the charge laid against the person, if the election was the only way to oust them, then electoral fraud would be a way to keep power no matter what the electorate thought of you. And third, increasing the time artificially can have other risks such as delaying evidence, which can in the meantime be destroyed or tampered with, witnesses die or move, and the official in question having hidden the crime successfully, potentially using the powers of their office to do so.

These crimes would likely be capable of being used as impeachment grounds too but if they were committed, their nature may well make it hard for the person to be removed if the illegal activity was helping the people who would have to agree to their impeachment or removal. You only need at least 34 out of 100 senators on your side to avoid removal.

Bribing SC judges is certainly possible, but I also add that you'd have to bribe the jury too. A special impeachment tribunal might also be the case, such as say getting judges from each of the circuit districts plus the supreme court and maybe the chief justice of every state, that's common enough in many countries where their courts do have this power over high officials and used in part for the reason you identify, to avoid the group of judges being a small group. 

Plus, Senators back then in 1789 were barely paid, judges were paid well and wouldn't need bribes nearly as much.

CanadaPolitics,ffquiqp,t1_ffqn5gf,1580143945.0,"If the army refuses to fight, that is akin to a strike to me. There are no armies in Bolivia but the Bolivian military itself. Who exactly would they be fighting if they were to take out their guns? If Morales was genuinely popular, he should be capable of winning subsequent votes if it came to it, and there should be protesters supporting him, and a declaration of neutrality by the military and police would also reinforce that they could assemble, and potentially go on strike if Mrs Cato joined in on the fun. 

The best vote we have as to whether Morales was personally popular as opposed to everyone else would come from the term limits referendum, which Morales lost, and Morales also failed to get the majority of votes, although likely sufficient to win due to an oddity in the rules (ballotage where 40% of the vote and 10% lead on the runner up is sufficient if a majority is not attained). This was a secret ballot vote open to all Bolivians, and the turnout was very good, nearly 85% which is almost 20% higher than most Canadian federal elections, in the referendum, and 88% in the 2019 election.

Also, there is no reason why this particular replacement president would have had to be installed if Morales was out. The line of succession was supposed to go to the vice president of Bolivia, then to the presidents of the legislative assemblies and both of whom were members of Morales' party and supporters of him. They could easily have retained their positions but chose to resign. 

The Plurinational Assembly and the Senate is also capable of passing laws, and among them could easily have included a call for a quota on indigenous people and possibly also a gender quota too in the cabinet, and you could plausibly put this on the party lists too for the elections for the legislature, departmental, and municipal councils. They have the majority and they need only a simple majority to override a presidential veto. 

The interim president is also supposed to only serve for 90 days as per a constitutional clause, they were originally going to hold an election on February 7 or earlier, and had the MAS not supported a bill to hold a general election later on May 3, the interim president would be nearly out of office right now. 

And I further ask: Why is Morales himself so important? Was he the only guy who could have helped Bolivia the way he did? Why did he go against the general population will by arguing in front of the supreme court against the term limits which the people had voted against delimiting? Out of a country of millions of people of whom Morales has normally gotten about 55-60% of the population's support in previous elections, the concept that only one guy is capable of being a good socialist president is rather insulting. 

Are Camacho or Anez good people? No. They shouldn't be in power. They attained wealth through exploitation and corruption. But we are in a position in Bolivia where that isn't as significant a problem, because elections can be conducted freely and fairly and where we have new slates of candidates in this next election. Anez went back on her promise to not run (I would entrench this in the constitution that interim presidents can't serve in the byelection) but she is still polling very low with the two guys likely to make it to the runoff (nobody is polling sufficiently high to avoid a runoff right now) is the MAS candidate and another that is somewhat centrist and probably going to be in an interesting power struggle with the legislature but still going to be somewhat respectful of the indigenous people in a way that Anez is patently incapable of doing. 

Morales did not design the constitution such that his revolution would outlast him that well, but that is a fixable problem. Bolivia could mandate in constitutional amendments new succession rules to make it clear who the power goes to, such as going from cabinet minister to the next before turning to the legislative leaders, having the confirmation of the cabinet before the legislature, have a majority vote required to win an election, put the term limits under an eternity clause and expressly make clear that the court cannot override that part not even due to treaty rules, require the legislature's consent to select the military and police high command, ambassadors, to dismiss ambassadors, and to recognize or cease to recognize other governments, and provide for quotae of gender and indigenous representation in the party lists, the election candidates, multi member bodies that are appointive, and the cabinets of the Bolivian Republic, the departments, and the municipal councils, forbidding interim presidents from running in the general election, and to top it off, making independent bodies for the judiciary, auditing and fraud, and the election tribunals into broad nominations such as open applications and public interviews and hearings, nomination by both the governing party and the opposition, civil society, and the institution itself (the auditors, judges, and election officials) with legislative consent, to prevent any one group from having power over them."

One possibility is granting Maduro the right to give a speech, flee to territory he'd be safe in like Cuba, and let him take his friends and the closest family he has there, in return for telling us openly about anything he did wrong and telling us where the truth is, perhaps uploading online a cache of documents that are relevant.

I doubt prosecuting him would work well unless perhaps it were before the ICC, but then you'd have to get Maduro to arrive before it. The best idea I have is for him to resign, get to safety, and this would trigger the Venezuelan constitutional clauses regarding how if in the first 4 years of a term, a special election is held for the president in 30 days, although if it's in the last two, the executive VP takes the role.

Requirement of the confirmation of the legislature to approve of the cabinet and ambassadors and the recognition of other countries. 

Have the national legislature elect proportionally the members of any government owned enterprise such as Petroleum of Venezuela and have them set the numbers of and appoint alone the military and police high command, and remove them both. Require an absolute majority for the election of the president, governors, mayors, and the speaker of the national assembly, with a majority runoff if nobody has a majority, and entrench mixed member proportional representation in the legislature. Require a democratic vote by secret ballot to propose candidates for legislatures and a democratic vote by secret ballot to propose the presidential candidate, these two events occuring within parties. Set the term of the president and parliament to 4 or 5 years with an absolute term limit and an eternity clause for the president of two terms consecutive or not and retroactively applicable. 

And probably, provide for a reconciliation commission much like South Africa did, l parliament elections, and probably 40-50% turnout requirement for any referendum. End the lame duck session of the parliament, and change the appointment of the electoral tribunal, the central bank, the supreme court and possibly lower courts, and the selection of auditors, comptrollers, and similar, by a system similar to the South African process of the judicial services commission which mandatorily requires participation by civil society and the government and the opposition, and the provinces too for that matter (Venezuela is technically a federal republic). End the practice of military tribunals, civilian only, set limits on how much the public can own the media and require dispersing of ownership among independent cooperatives for the rest.

But various groups hold deliberate boycotts, for example how the 2005 election for the legislature was mass boycotted with only about 25% turnout in a country that normally had 80% turnout for presidents. The Maduroists, in response to a referendum in 2017, boycotted a referendum proposed by the National Assembly which declared that the military and police should stand by the legislature as the source of law, that the constituent assembly should not have been held without a referendum actually supporting the creation of one, and to hold new elections.

Then there is the exclusion of candidates from the ballot and parties naming candidates in increasingly suspect ways such as Maduro getting his family members on the constituent assembly.

Other problems eventually included a lame duck session in 2015 with the naming of judges that were blatantly pro Maduro, the constituent assembly declaring it's power over the national assembly despite how there is no reason why it should be dealing with matters other than drafting a new constitution or amendments to the present one, and the constitution expressly prescribes that it is the role of the national assembly to do many tasks such as ratify or reject the president's request for emergency powers.

Article 333 of the Venezuelan constitution also prescribes to every Venezuelan that the constitution must be guarded, whether or not that person has official authority, and ensured to be brought into effect."
CanadaPolitics,ffqc1ys,t1_ffnwh06,1580129861.0,"Bolivia isn't a coup d'etat. The army refused to stand with Morales as did the police, which meant that the president would have no way to crack down if he tried it, that protests would be freely allowed, and perhaps even the legislature might impeach him. It would be like the Secret Service refusing to protect Trump from being disregarded as president and with everyone else listening to someone else then.

Morales resigned fearing more deaths. I'm not actually sure why the president of the senate and the plurinational assembly also resigned, they didn't have to and it doesn't seem like they were going to lose the support of the legislature. They would have been next in line for the presidency, but they resigned too meaning that the presidency unexpectedly ended up in a bad person.

But it is also worth remembering that the Bolivian legislature still has the power to enact laws. The president's veto is also a weak one, only a majority vote is necessary to overturn it. And to appoint members to a number of independent bodies, although not the cabinet and I don't believe ambassadors either, requires legislative consent. And Morales' party still has the majority in both houses. They could pass any law that the president is obligated to enforce, and they have to sign off on the budget and can reduce any line in it to whatever they want, and can demand the imposition of taxes, first by getting the president to propose them, or if they don't do it, to draft the bill themselves.

The Bolivian constitution really should have several important types of limits on the president such as legislative ability to insert items into the budget so long as it remains not at the debt level that the president hasn't asked for, the president should need the consent of both houses to appoint the cabinet and the ambassadors, and the security forces if they aren't already, and to give consent or lack of it to the recognition of governments, and quotae for the president to follow such as tying the ethnic diversity of the cabinet to the ethnic diversity of the country as a whole (so that the Indigenous people would have about 40% of the cabinet members). And Bolivia should require a majority vote for the president and remove the possibility of 40% plus 10% lead as an alternative to a majority, and they should impose turnout requirements and a ban on interim presidents seeking the position in the next presidential election. But they are still capable of holding elections and they will be holding one on May 3."

irishpolitics,fflhdyo,t1_fflalyz,1580039662.0,"Most of them. Basically all states directly elect a governor, a lieutenant governor, an attorney general, and a secretary of state, which is normally the chief electoral officer (although that's not a wise thing to copy, don't do that part) and a primary records officer. A treasurer is also commonly elected, akin to the minister of finance in Ireland. 

The US doesn't have universal healthcare so they don't usually have anything that really is close to a health minister, but they do usually have some state boards of health and some with a director of health that is normally appointed by the governor with the consent of the state Seanad (but these ones are directly elected). 

States also can have a labour commissioner, akin to the employment minister of Ireland. They can also have a superintendent of education and for universities, a college of regents, both of whom are usually elected, so that would be akin to the education and skills minister of Ireland. 

I can't think of any elected officers who might be similar to an environment commissioner but an environmentally progressive person could be elected to a natural resources commission or the Texan Railway Commission (which ironically actually supervises pipelines, not the railways), and a dedicated environment commissioner isn't at all hard to imagine.

Most states also have an agriculture commissioner, so that would do the same sort of stuff as the agriculture minister in Ireland.

Transportation is not something I'm entirely sure what elected officer might deal with that, but an infrastructure commissioner wouldn't be out of place. 

The children and youth minister in Ireland could plausibly be included under health if renamed to health and human services. 

Ireland has a local government minister but most states don't have much of an officer to do things like it due to the nature of decentralization in the US. Most states have a constitution like Ireland in that it only needs a simple majority to amend by the public in a referendum but questions, often multiple questions every two years, are normal, and these constitutions usually hold municipalities and counties in a detailed provision, and state law makes it even more clear, with not really that many things that a city has to ask a dedicated minister or commissioner for permission to do, although it may have things like the authority to build a road decided by a transportation commissioner or something like that. 

The US doesn't have a culture so they don't need culture executive officers. In a more serious tone, they don't have as much of a unifying culture and trying to promote American culture is weird because then you have to decide what is American culture where Ireland has a history that is more clear and without as many groups making up Ireland right now. 

Somewhat ironically for America, a business commissioner isn't normal among state governments. I imagine that it is normally done instead by the chambers of commerce in most places, which is not governmental. You could plausibly add it to the list of things to elect in Ireland though.

They have independently elected attorneys general, so that deals with that issue. 

The governors role varies by state. Most give a strong veto over legislation, often with a 2/3 vote to override in both houses of their state legislature, a line item veto, especially over the budget, and an amendatory veto where the governor proposes amendments the legislature cannot refuse to consider and vote on, but some give basically pointless vetoes where it is a straight up or down veto and needs a standard majority to override. They also usually appoint a number of people on varying boards, commissions, advisory panels, but normally with the consent of the state senate and normally these days many of them have an open applications process for people to apply. They also normally can fill vacancies on other bodies for a period of time but exactly which varies. But you could also give this role to the heads of the other executive branch bodies which are elected or to them collectively, and not just the governor. They also normally have the power to make some executive orders to do various things normally administrative things within the executive branch itself. 

They also normally have a role in the judiciary, with many states having a commission to nominate judges, where the bar association elects a number, the governor appoints an equal number, and the chief justice elected by other judges most of the time chairs the meeting, and they propose a list to the governor who chooses one in a month or a couple of months, and then they face retention elections on a periodic basis, normally between 6 and 12 years with 6 being a common term for a low level judge and 8-10 for a higher level judge with California using 12 for both appeals and supreme court levels but their standard trial court judges normally serve 4 year terms and are elected in a non partisan election in a two round system. Most states also have a pardons and parole board so the gubernatorial pardon power is normally mitigated.

The lieutenant governor powers vary too, some being almost nothing, to the Texan LG who is basically the commander of the state senate who does everything in it, to others who normally sit on and chair varying meetings of state bodies as California's LG is.

Ireland would need a military person but given it's pretty neutral and works mostly at the helm of the UN anyway, it would probably befall on a person appointed by an Irish president and approved by the parliament to manage it day to day and issue it their regulations as the statutory law provides.

Ireland would also need a foreign affairs guy but the EU does enough of this that an executive Irish president could probably do this alone well enough, especially if their other powers were minimal.

The budget would need to be considered somehow. I imagine that an open hearing system within the departments and their heads would provide for the inclusive creation of the budget, the president formally sends it onto the parliament, and they would have an open hearing system and series of proposed amendments, but with the caveat that they can't create pork barrel spending or include more debt or deficit than the executive wants."

Obama interpreted the immigration law as not to punish minors who usually don't have as much legal responsibility anyway and require public benefit by limiting it to those who had no other criminal behavior.

Dual member proportional is probably the single simplest ballot option with the exception of closed list proportional representation with no riding seats (as in Spain) but not too many people are in favour of the latter. Single transferable vote and open lists can be more complicated, but the ballots can still look pretty simple if you design them as such (such as the ballot used in Ireland, or with lists and relatively small district magnitudes such as 7-12 members). The idea of parties working together strongly suggests a proportional system and people seem willing to accept that a single party might not be totally at fault. Local accountability is more complicated but I see open lists and single transferable vote as providing it by ensuring that you have the ability to not conflate the idea of voting for a candidate as voting for their party, especially with STV the ridings are likely to remain relatively small, and STV can promote small parties but does trend towards several larger ones."

Other dictators recognize the importance of the judiciary, Maduro stacking the Venezuelan supreme court for this purpose when he realized he had no control over the parliamentary majority. 

A judge is still obligated to apply those human rights equally regardless of whether there is a minority group or not. They have had to rule on this issue before, or things related to it, such as the rights of fathers and access to children when a given father is not abusing their family. 

Bill 21's equal standards still mean that people who are merely employees can't perform their tasks that have no bearing on the behaviour of others. Imagine if your employer fired you because of having maybe a crucifix on your neck. Wouldn't you be outraged? It has no bearing on others. Equality of opportunity and equality of outcomes are things to consider independently, and while some can easily show biases and problems such as if it is technically the case that one group had equality of outcomes but due to previous trouble such as getting a large inheritance from a bribe once given to their father it is obvious that equality of outcome can be changed. Quebec tries to create equality of outcome but there is no reason to do so artificially. 

As for individual expression, it still applies in a school because they are very much so public employees, and everyone in Quebec pays for them. And there is nothing damaging about an adult employee deciding to wear basic items of religious significance, they just can't teach based on it. Public employment is meant to be based on merit alone through the civil service, and these garbs do not decide whether a person has merit.

If you happen to be in the coincidental position of being assaulted or seeing someone else assaulted you can use any weapon you happen to have though.

It means that something is messing up what a society blind to them from the beginning would have expected, but we know problems like the residential schools really messed up the lives of many before they could develop like we do in say suburban Edmonton.

I don't say that the charter should be sacred. It's a document to bind the government from creating a dictatorship and rectifying past abuses like the residential schools, remaining sexism, preventing abuses by police and courts, enshrining freedom of expression, and entrenching language rights. It's certainly not the most comprehensive human rights document in the world and it isn't especially specific as to how to implement the rights, and such questions as to how would also limit the power of the judiciary by the way.

The judiciary is expressly declared in the constitution to have the power to give redress. It would also be something the parliament would face trouble for much earlier than the judiciary would given the term lengths. The governor genera I might add is not an officer of parliament and is equally bound by the constitution so they could probably be forced to do something about it. 

The judiciary also has bailiffs and sheriffs to enforce their orders, such as perhaps holding the prime minister in contempt. But blatant disregard of orders such as stop mass murdering innocent people and refusing to hold elections would be a coup d'tat. It could also introduce some other interesting issues, such as how the Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights too makes it illegal to raise taxes but with consent of the representatives of the people, so if the parliament really did do a self coup, the power to raise taxes could be seen as illegitimate and end up with the people having no obligation to pay them.

As for the minority rights distinction, I tried to explain but you wouldn't listen. A minority right is in law just a right held by a minority. They don't get additional rights. The right not to be discriminated based on race applies equally to racial majorities and minorities, the difference is in how prevalent in practice it is. 

Quebec with Bill 21 isn't just cultural relativism and national sovereignty, it's infringing upon people to be individually secure in their desire to express themselves. Russian laws making it illegal to express gay propaganda isn't OK just because most Russian people are homophobic and would support a law providing for it, it's a violation of individual self expression that each individual and voluntary and peaceful associations of individuals have. Bill 21 may in the minds of many be seen as an act of attempting to progress society and to improve it, but it is also a limit as to the way individuals can express themselves in a peaceful and voluntary manner, although I would be willing to make it clear that it must be voluntary and parents cannot demand of their children to abide by any given faith or lack of it or to use religious practices. 

As for the weapons, the right of self defense is legal and if you have any thing that can be used as a weapon, it can be used, but carrying the weapon in the first place can't be with the intent of self defense. A person who happens to be walking to a baseball game with an aluminium bat could use it to stop a mugging if they by chance came across it. The kirpan is these days in societies where common crime among strangers isn't especially common would be seen as a symbol of faith and would have dissociation as to why, even if a guru explains it to you as you grow up or convert, just like how Sikhs don't think anything day to day of not trimming their hair even if they do know in the back of their minds as to why. 

And the school isn't private property, it's public property. Public taxes pay for it and it's expressly designed to be for the general population to utilize for their collective advancement and utility and not for any private profit. 

As for the Sikhs alone with the knives, if you happen to believe that it is important to carry a knife, hide it such that you don't create more fear in the atmosphere, seal it like the student in question was willing to do, and are a respectable and safe person, I don't actually oppose you carrying knives regardless of your faith or lack of it."

Conservatives can vary in what they want, such as a stronger protections for religious freedoms. 

To Islam, it's inconceivable that the Koran can be amended, it is literally the word of God to them, whereas even Christians and Jews see their holy texts as being the way humans have written down, such as Paul writing Galatians of his own accord, and so it has flaws because the human recorders were flawed. I'm not entirely sure why Islam doesn't seem to have as much of the same issue in my perception as someone obviously had to write the Koran down somewhere, unless the idea is that someone wrote it down as God was speaking and not years later. 

I actually have a more liberal view of being able to amend the constitution, I think it should be more common and not a sacrosanct thing. But I do not at all trust a parliament to override the Charter of their own accord, and this is why I fundamentally see the NWC as dangerous. Why is it the parliament overriding the judiciary and not the people who created both and upon which both need the confidence of for their power? 

Do you think it is ever possible for a parliament to be so wrong that only a court is likely to be able to have the independence necessary to provide for a fundamental right over the heads of parliament? I at minimum see this as essential for the conduct of elections such that they are held in a free and fair way, such as not dismissing the chief elections officer except for cause. Without this, you can't replace a parliament failing to abide by the confidence entrusted to it. 

As for Anglophone minority rights, these aren't perversions, it's providing for the same human rights to people who happen to be in minority groups. A white person is just as unable to be fired because of their ethnicity as a black person, it's just that it's more typical in racial discrimination suits that they are black. It's also important to remember that a political minority will inherently have difficulty in getting a parliament to agree with it. It doesn't mean they are automatically excluded but they will need more effort to get the same things a majority can. When the wishes of a majority population depend on extracting the benefits or political power or rights of minorities which are capable of being held not at the expense of the majority (a business owner, usually a minority, can only generate profit if the majority works enough that they can put profit into a fund for some purpose and give a fraction back, but it is completely free for the majority population of a country to let gay people marry), their protection needs independent bodies to protect them.

I can see Quebec's argument about secularism. I am skeptical of minors wearing a lot of religious headgear without very strong proof that it was the minor's idea to do so, and especially among populations that religions have repressed over time, such as women, even if that religion may at the time of invention have provided rights they did not before, some behavior can be more like victim blaming such as demanding modesty of women. But I have a lot of doubt that the politicians pushing it through really were thinking of the philosophy over this. The timing is closely associated with a rise of xenophobia. I know that these attitudes towards secularism have existed for a long time, France's lay state system is over a hundred years old, and Quebec's Quiet Revolution has been a long process too. But I think the final push to get it passes was more closely tied to racism and fear of foreigners than actually experiencing a problem with people, and fear shouldn't be the basis of establishing rules in society.

As for the Kirpan decision, a person can have weapons in Canada when they show themselves to be responsible users. That student could actually have obtained a minor's license for firearms if he and his parents had desired to do so. I see no particular reason to believe that this student was in any reasonably likelihood going to use that knife as a weapon unless perhaps he saw someone being murdered behind the school, which is the whole point of a Kirpan to be a tool of self defense and defense of innocents in Sikhism and a right any person in Canada has. Normally weapons in a school is taboo, the people who normally carry knives don't usually loudly tell one another that they have one, but this student and his family did pretty clearly want to make it known to the school that he had one, that he was trained in not using it aggressively, and would hide it. That was reasonable and the school shouldn't have said no. My school had a police officer carrying a loaded pistol all day, but people didn't have real fear."
CanadaPolitics,ffbe59a,t1_ffbaqyj,1579761442.0,"The power to make on the spot decisions works both ways. And we know from countries with lower crime rates like Netherlands and Finland that the police can still be safe in their person and their communities safe despite the restrictions on their power. And restrictions, when publicized, also helps to make the police look less like an occupying force. 

A judge can make their arguments after hearing not just their own thoughts. They sit in courts and read extensively on documents. They release long written descriptions of the evidence and reasoning, and list the evidence presented before them that contributed to their reasoning. And they hold open courts. And in criminal cases and some civil trials, there are juries that make the decision, not the judges, and the rules of evidence is long and detailed. You can read them at will, and most of them are online too. 

I'm not glorifying judges, I'm putting them as a limit to parliament doing unconstitutional actions, but as I mentioned before, I suggest a list of ways to amend the constitution that limits judges appropriately. I also support having a much more transparent and open nominations process for choosing judges, being a fan of the judicial services commission of South Africa when applied in a less dominant party system where normally an election produces parties that go back and forth with power, and like the idea of a non renewable term such as 12 years, where the previous chief justice served more than twice as long. I would even suggest civil law, leaving the constitutionality of laws up to a constitutional court designed for the purpose and a provincial constitutional court in each province, which also makes a better list of what rules judges will rule by. 

Political opposition wasn't about who is targeted now, but who would be targeted if the standard for police was reduced. We see that in the US before many of these civil rights rulings from courts that provided things like lawyers for the poor, the miranda warnings, and the fruit of the poison tree doctrine, among others, that it really did happen that political suppression did occur, such as the dismissal of people with even vaguely leftist beliefs during the McCarthy era from government jobs, many states had police that were truly brutal against gay communities and actively sought to oust them from their jobs and government positions, the FBI sending hate mail to MLK Jr to encourage him to be suicidal, and more. Canada is unlikely to be as bad, but many countries aspire to be like Canada and if we backslide, they lose role models and can turn to more repressive policies like the way Turkey is being gripped by Erdogan. 

Looking at the types of people that police do arrest, it is far more often people of low incomes, and with a lot of people of certain minorities, especially Indigenous people, than their share of the population would suggest. Of course, there are many different reasons why, but it is still clear that much of the arrests are based on this low income and pretty bad and antiquated laws that many groups recognize need reform. We learned from Portugal that decriminalization of drugs and treating it as a health issue, the Netherlands with medical prescriptions for maintenance of addiction, and Canada's legalization of cannabis (though with many improvements required), that these issues can be dramatically reduced, and much of the associated petty theft and some petty fraud, a good number of gang wars and the murders associated with them, and some domestic violence can also be reduced with this. That is only one of many ideas I've got on my list. I don't even harbour particular resentment for white collar crime, it's getting the money back to those who own it and putting those who commit it out of a position to commit it again that I care most about and same with crooked politicians. 

As for illegal searches, it doesn't just protect criminals. It also protects innocents, with illegal searches also finding things that are debateable of illegal nature and with a long trial after often a lot of legal expenses and emotional pain for the defendants to find them not guilty. Without the illegal search, this process wouldn't occur for them. People don't always know everything about their property either, so if their car had say a friend's backpack they forgot to take inside but they didn't know it had say illicit drugs in it, and the police illegally search the vehicle, it's the driver of the car who gets arrested. 

The Islamic jurists are clerics, Canadian jurists are not clerics. Canadian judges can't write law based on religion, and nor can they amend the written word of a law, invent a new crime or offense, nor can they amend the constitution through their actions. Everything they do has to be based on a preexisting law, international treaties or international laws, the common practices of democratic countries around the world sometimes if there is no precedent in Canada, or the constitution, and only if it is a constitutional law is parliament unable to unilaterally amend it if it requires the amending formulae with the provinces. 

What in the Charter is really imposing a right on Quebec? The right to freedom of speech, conscience, the right of association, demonstration and protest? The right to move within Canada and to enter and remain in Canada for citizens and permanent residents, and for citizens not to be expelled? The right of people to vote in periodic elections and to stand in those elections, and for those representatives to meet at least once per year? The right of people of life, liberty, and security of the person? No unreasonable searches or seizures? No arbitrary detention or imprisonment? Counsel and habeus corpus? Presumption of innocence? No cruel or unusual punishment? No self incrimination? The right to an interpreters if you cannot speak the language of the court? Equality under the law and freedom from discrimination? That English and French are federally equal and equal in New Brunswick, to use both in the legislatures of Canada and New Brunswick, for laws to be printed in both languages federally and in New Brunswick and the courts and administration and civil service of both? The right of people in New Brunswick to have education and cultural institutions in both languages? That indigenous language rights and the other rights of language groups in other constitutional rules are protected? That minorities in a province can be educated in their own languages? That the Indigenous rights of people are protected? That separate religious school rights are preserved? That the Charter applies in the territories? That the Charter is afforded to men and women equally? That the Charter is to be interpreted in a multi cultural context? 

Really, what of those rights hurts Quebec? And what rights of them are Anglo Saxon or American? Many of the same rights, such as legal rights, the right of equality under the law, are in the French Revolutionary Declaration of Man and Citizen, written almost 80 years before Canada's Charter, written almost 80 years before the 14th amendment in the US, adopted actually about 3 years before the American Bill of Rights was fully enacted, and almost 200 years before the Charter was written. 

I was reading the Multani decision, and the student isn't violating anything particular to the culture of Frenchness. It was about weapons in school. This student was prepared to have some limits such as keeping it in a secure sheath and keeping it under his clothes. He was sincere in the belief that Sikhs of his type carried kirpans made of metal and that it was never to be used for aggression, and in a school, you are rather not likely to face any kind of mortal threats. 

Quebec could write some rules of it's own as to how to do this, such as prescribing that the parents must inform the teachers of the weapon, and that the parents teach their kids about how to carefully use it. The school board could too. It's hardly an imposition of direct rule. The school board itself was negotiating as to how to address the kirpan in the school, and it was another Quebec school administrator who overruled the local board. 

TL;DR, judges, while they could be improved, are largely working well, I see no need of a notwithstanding law although some more detailed prescriptions for the constitution would be useful and a better way to amend the constitution would be useful, and it's 11:37 PM MT and I really need to go to sleep."
