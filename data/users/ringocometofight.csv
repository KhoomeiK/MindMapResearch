Not because he said you should, but because you deserve to feel happy with your own body and personality. If you don’t like the place you are right now, you could try to change it. Maybe a new haircut or a hobby, learning a new instrument. It’s a slow progress and you should take it with patience and kindness, but it’s totally worth the try.
If you’re young or a teenager, please don’t worry, you have plenty of time to find and work on yourself. Also, it was not really nice of him to say it in such a harsh way, and doesn’t matter how you look, you deserve respect."

I have cats and I’m really happy to keep them safe, and I’d do anything I could to keep it that way. You’re not wrong for being responsible and taking care of your dog. And well, the scarcity in the world is also not your fault lol"

Feeling guilty for standing up for myself it’s the worst part, but as you said, it takes time. That was really helpful, thanks again"
offmychest,ff7mckj,t3_eru1na,1579652986.0,"Man I’m working on that too. I‘ve been the “laid back” my whole life and it’s kinda hard to change things now. Whenever I try to express my opinion on something I instantly hear the passive-aggressive reactions like “oh so you’re speaking now huh” from my own family and I just feel worthless. I’m glad you’re doing fine, keep it up! Don’t take shit from no one."
