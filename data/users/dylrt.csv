SmashBrosUltimate,fffgth8,t1_fffg771,1579883650.0,"I've never played against any because I don't pay for the nintendo online or whatever but I watch high level tourny vids and I've seen tournament gameplay of both and haven't been able to tell a difference yet. I don't play them either so maybe they're tiny little differences that only the person playing them can notice, but as a spectator they're entirely the same.

Ike's being compared because his moveset has parts that are exactly the same as others (Roy, Chrom). It doesn't even really matter if they play differently, if they're the same character then they're the same character. 

The FE characters have lazy designs. If they were to remove some of the old ones to replace them with FE characters that aren't clones, I'd be down. But right now they're just taking up space.

Also, the only difference between the pits are their side specials and neutral specials. Dark Pit's side B sends the opponent forward instead of upward, so you can use it in some pretty crazy ways (I've seen someone land three of them in a row to send someone into the blast zone), and the neutral specials change how they're going to edge guard and when they can kill, because Dark Pit's arrows can kill off the side."
SmashBrosUltimate,ffffr2y,t1_ffffbbs,1579882989.0,"Does it actually make playing them different though? You just stand further away from the enemy as marth, that's it, but they still do the same combos, go for the same stuff, etc. Even if they do play differently they're still the same character. That's like saying Pit and Dark Pit aren't the same character, they have the exact same moveset. Nobody will ever say Pit and Dark Pit aren't interchangeable. 

I figured if there would be anything you disagreed with it would be Roy, Ike, and Chrom because they're not exactly the same like Marth and Lucina."
SmashBrosUltimate,ffff6xz,t1_fff539d,1579882644.0,"Also the only Pokemon that are even similar are Pikachu and Pichu, and Pichu doesnt need to be in the game. Like half of the FE characters are just copy/pastes with minor differences (Marth-Lucina, Roy-Chrom-Ike)."
relationships,ffear4f,t1_ffdkygk,1579841495.0,"I think OP was so invested in the idea that her husband was cheating on her she fully believed it, and took her husband suggesting couples therapy as him saying ""I might be sleeping with this girl behind your back, but you've got problems and it's going to ruin our relationship"". Idk, that's just my initial thought. 

Imagine a scenario where you 100% know your SO is cheating on you, and when you start to express your feelings/knowledge on the situation your SO suggests couples therapy. Not couples therapy for the cheating, couples therapy to fix you being upset that they're cheating on you. That's the scenario I think OP fully believed she was in. Could be wrong, of course."

SmashBrosUltimate,felxexv,t1_felwn8k,1579233360.0,"? Waluigi and Byleth are both wastes of a character. Byleth adds no new mechanics, no new ideas, and is another FE character. Tell me, what new mechanic does he add? Does he have some kind of meter? Some kind of alternate form? No? Oh yeah, that's right, he has nothing new. He just uses a different weapon for each attack which changes nothing about the game. Literally every single fighter (except, ironically, about half of the current FE characters, Byleth included) adds new moves. Byleth's down special is hatchet man reskinned, he's got yet another bow, his nair is pit's nair reskinned, his up special is joker's reskinned with a spike, etc. You're just lying at this point and it's honestly pretty disappointing, but not surprising."

Not to mention Blyeth doesn't even add any new mechanics. Yes, he is a FE character that uses something other than a sword. Whoopdy doo. His only interesting mechanic is the recovery but that's just a reskin of joker's with an added spike."

SmashBrosUltimate,fekvi5r,t1_fekvblv,1579208455.0,"Terry didn't have 7 fighters from his series already in the game. Your argument is invalid.

I never once mentioned Byleth having a sword being a reason to dislike him. His moveset is unique and looks really fun, I'll probably buy him. But he was a wasted slot because there are already 7 fucking FE fighters."
SmashBrosUltimate,fekukxm,t1_fek4w4o,1579207909.0,"Saying it was a wasted slot is reasonable though. It could have been any number of better characters but it was given to Byleth, yet another FE rep. That makes it 8 now, and half of them are practically the same character. 

You can use the pokemon argument if you wish but I don't want any more pokemon reps. Pichu, mewtwo, incineroar, greninja, puff, and lucario could and should be removed to add better, more deserving reps and I would be entirely fine with it. Pikachu is the mascot of the games and pokemon trainer is a no brainer so those are the only ones that need to be in. The only other one we could ever need is eevee that utilizes the eeveelutions as part of the moveset/skins because that's another no brainer.

I agree that people shouldn't be toxic but Byleth wasting a spot is an entirely valid argument, and is reasonable to be upset about."

Sure, some people are happy he's been added and others are content, but I highly doubt that really anybody was sitting up early waiting for the reveal thinking ""God damn, I hope Byleth gets in and not Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Doom Guy, Master Chief, etc.!"" 

Realistically people shouldn't even want Byleth if the best interest of the game is in their mind. He's not from a new series, brings no new representation, and takes a valuable slot away from other, much more deserving characters. He's essentially dead weight."
SmashBrosUltimate,fekf7fu,t1_fejzfqg,1579198784.0,"To be fair, Byleth does look pretty fun, mainly because of his recovery. 

But everybody has a right to be disappointed. We've waited a long ass time for this reveal and it's a character that literally nobody wanted from a series that already has a shit ton of reps (6 or 7?). It's about more than hoe the character plays, it's about representation. To a lot of people having their character/series represented in smash means a hell of a lot more than adding a new mechanic. Spyro, for one, would have been amazing to see. He's a classic and he deserves a spot 1000x more than Byleth.

Sure, there are 6 more fighters coming. That's a cool thought. But what are the chances they turn out to be just as disappointing as Byleth? I'd say pretty high. 

Nobody needs to be harassing him, but there's no valid argument for us to not be upset (unless you're in the tiny minority that actually wanted Byleth)."

Come to now, they're watching a movie, she LAYS HER HEAD ON HIS LAP, AND LETS HIM RUB HER BACK. Clearly she has feelings, right? So Nick does what he does with the tracing her lips and touching her cheek and stuff. It was a bad move, kinda creepy, and it turned out he was wrong about her feelings. But she was obviously leading him on.

Nick offered, OP initiated. She could've said ""Eh, no thanks Nick, I have a boyfriend!"" but she didnt. You can argue with that all you want but it's not really a debatable matter.

Nobody *needs* to spin this into her leading him on because it's a fact; she was leading him on. 

The person you were originally replying to was very out of line, their comment was more akin to an attack on women, but they weren't wrong when they said she led him on. The fact that you're even denying this leads me to believe you have some kind of gender bias behind your argument. When all of the evidence says she was leading him on and you sit here and say ""she wasn't leading him on, you guys are just misogynistic!"" it comes off as an argument that what she did was okay because she's a woman."

That's not to say at all that it's right for him to touch her while she's asleep, you shouldn't do that to anybody that you're not in a relationship with. But given the fact that she was laying her head in his lap, letting him rub her back and touch her hair, etc. you can see why he would have done it. Again, that does not mean it was okay.

But the fact of the matter is that OP was in fact leading this guy on. She and Nick have a relationship that is beyond ""friends"". She's pretty much been cheating on her boyfriend. She either needs to cut nick off completely or break up with her boyfriend. She needs to tell her bf what she's been doing with Nick either way. The end."

The difference between ZeRo and Little Z is that ZeRo does only what he thinks everybody else thinks is funny. Little Z makes original content, which ends up being funny because it's genuine and, keyword, original. Sure, jokes like mario fair and ""my best character"" pop up more than once, if not frequently, but why should they not? Mario spamming fair is a big enough meme that it shows up on this subreddit constantly, and ""my best character"" is unique to Little Z and is funny. ZeRo's attempt at uniqueness is his hentai merch.

relationships,fdkorps,t1_fdk4b8g,1578508009.0,"Yeah, contacting your ex without notifying your current SO is a sure sign of cheating. Especially when they say stuff like ""I've been thinking about you recently"". If she wanted to meet up with him to check if he was alright she should've brought her boyfriend. The best option would be to break up with her, regardless of whether she fucked her ex or not. She's shady."

relationships,fdguvl0,t3_el7aln,1578408915.0,"The only real option here is divorce, unless you can convince him to actually change his mind about wanting a child. The kids that you have are not his and never will be his and that's a biological fact. I'm not sure what the other comments are talking about, as the only nasty comment your husband made was about the cuck thing. Is it not a fact that they are not his kids? Like, you can't even argue that.

Anyways, if he wants a child and you do not then I don't see how a compromise could be made without you allowing him to have a child with some other woman, a surrogate situation or something, or your husband choosing to stay with you even though you won't have a kid with him, which would inevitably leading to him despising life, despising the marriage, despising your children, etc. Something along those lines.

Imo it's a little too late for him to want to have a kid. 39 is a little old. I think he got with you in the first place fully expecting to be able to have a child with you, and now that he can't I don't think he'll be very happy with the marriage. But that's just the way I see it."

These aren't people you should be friends with, but if you choose to then that's up to you. But regardless of what they are to you, you should always do the right thing and the right thing would be to let their SOs know."
