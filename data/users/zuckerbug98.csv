This exact one after a blog I read by another woman who had success with it (among other things)."
tretinoin,ff2tzsu,t3_erclbf,1579524098.0,"(These photos are exactly 1 month difference). Note: I also made my skin care routine a little more simple. The clear up could be purely coincidental. I think the supplement worked but I’m not 100% sure, obviously too scared to stop it now that I’ve started. I could just be excreting more vitamins and minerals out in my urine and my body is not using any of it. I will ask my derm when I go in. The supplement is DIM/Vitex berry combination on Amazon. It’s like 50 bucks a bottle but has lasted me awhile,  you take 2 capsules a day in the AM. I have a Mirena IUD and the thought is that there is not adequate management of estrogen in the body, and that’s what can cause hormonal acne from it.

“Routine:” la roche posay foaming cleanser, the ordinary niacinamide + zinc, sometimes the ordinary hyaluronic acid, the ordinary natural moisturizing factors + HA, Altreno (0.05% tretonin). No spf yet, as it is dead of winter here at the top of the globe and haven’t seen sun in days."
