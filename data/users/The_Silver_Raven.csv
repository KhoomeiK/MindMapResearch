fatlogic,ffg3ps7,t3_etbmyx,1579897791.0,"No, my dear confused 5'9 friend, 5'2 me does not have a better metabolism than you. I just eat less food. But I am glad to see you starting an exercise routine, and I hope the changes stick."
fatlogic,fffi8wk,t1_ffffefs,1579884535.0,"Perhaps we're trying to create something with complex flavors that we can actually taste, in a sugar saturated culture where the subtleties of a well structured main dish at a nice restaurant might be lost on a palate conditioned to only enjoy hyperpalatable foods? Or it could be a product of the ""stunt food"" era that we're experiencing right now?"

fatlogic,ffd3n8j,t3_esucfr,1579812780.0,"Don't know if you can strictly call it a recipe, but one 5-6 oz cup of regular (not Greek) yogurt mixed with 15 grams chia seeds and left in the fridge overnight makes a delicious ""pudding"" that you can add fruit to for breakfast. It has the texture of dessert and is pretty filling."

loseit,ff9vgsm,t3_esbic7,1579722375.0,"I pack and track my breakfast/lunch the night before, and also set out my gym clothes by my bed and pack my office clothes in my gym bag. Means I don't have to waffle around in the morning trying to find things. All I have to do is move my food from the fridge to my lunchbox and get dressed. If I oversleep I put on my office clothes and go to the gym at lunch. It's really worked for me thus far - I hate getting up any earlier than my time based commitments require."
