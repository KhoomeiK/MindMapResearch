After they made it big, their POS manager too all of their money and ran. I had good friends in a local bands that knew them and said it was sad to see a band that had many big hits crammed into an apartment smaller than the ones they had. (Thankfully they got themselves out of that bad situation)"
EntitledPeople,ff8te9v,t1_ff8t109,1579695392.0,"Trust me, I totally understand!! I lived in Volusia for the last 13 years, off and on, but I actually grew up in Orlando, near the Airport. We talked about moving for awhile, then last September we decided to just do it. My hubby shut down his shop, we sold the equipment, and by the first week of October we were gone. We now live just outside of Tallahassee and I absolutely love it, and my kids are much happier - and safer - here."

All that matters to that area is the tourists - no one cares about the residents. I lived there for most of my life (I'm 42, moved there at 4) and it's gone so far downhill, it's sad."
Perimenopause,ff31gmn,t3_eqj3um,1579531156.0,"I just read this article last night! Before that, I had never even heard of perimenopause. I'm so grateful for stumbling upon it (it was suggested to me in my Google news feed) because I have been experiencing so many of these symptoms in the last 6 months- a year. I am 42 (will be 43 in March) years old so I wouldn't have even thought of anything related to menopause for at least a free more years. I've been having serious sleep issues at night for awhile now, and when I do sleep, I wake up every hour or so, absolutely covered in sweat, no matter how cold I am. My period has been getting more and more unpredictable in the last year, and before that it was very regular, especially since getting my non-hormonal IUD put in after my daughter's birth 8 years ago. Not only is it not on a regular cycle, but each month is different - some heavy, some light, some long, some short, some spot for days ahead, etc. Then in just the last 2 weeks, I started getting what I now believe to be hot flashes, but at the time, it scared me - I thought maybe my blood sugar was dropping, since diabetes runs heavily in my family. I definitely need to make an appointment soon to talk to my Gyn about this! It's nice to have a place to go here for support too!"
AmItheAsshole,fezl5x6,t1_fez366v,1579458507.0,"My 8 yo daughter also has severe ADHD, ODD, and SPD. She can be very difficult at times, especially when she's off her meds, but when she's at someone else's home, she knows to be respectful. This sounds like a kid who's been allowed to get away with doing whatever they want and has no respect for anyone else!"

I have Hashimoto's (thyroid disease) and when I was younger, my thyroid was hyperactive, so I couldn't gain weight. I'm 5'3"", and weighed 95-100 lbs and wore 00-1, and XS-S. I hated shopping for clothes because it was so hard to find anything. I had to hear how ""lucky"" I was so be so small all the time, which made it worse. A few years ago my thyroid decided to change to hypoactive, and Im now 35 lbs heavier. I just wish I could be somewhere between the two, lol"

Most of my lessons were at the church my family went to, but I  hated when I had to go to her house for lessons. I've never liked Basenjis because my time dealing with her dogs!"
entitledparents,feczwen,t3_eo9p3a,1578991716.0,"A charity that I just recently find out about, and is one closer to my heart, is CHADD, or Children and Adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. It helps both adults and children with ADHD, as well as their families, to get the help and support they need. My 8yo daughter has severe ADHD and I knew nothing about ADHD, other than the stereotypes you see on TV and movies, until she was diagnosed and I started researching it more. Too many times I've heard ""that's not a real thing,"" or ""she's just young and playful. She'll outgrow it."", Or  ""It's bad parenting/spoiled brats"" It's a very misunderstood condition, which makes it harder on those with it, and their families."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fect0cx,t1_fecru8w,1578983464.0,"Omg, I'm sorry, I'm an idiot - that's what I get for being on Reddit instead of being in bed like I should be, lol. We were shocked that they wrote it off, but it was all their fault. I don't know how you can interview someone on the phone for 30 minutes, get their birthdate, get other personal info from them, and still mix it up with their father's credit?!?! He had gotten some of the stuff to start his shop up with on that card, so he had already put like $10,000 on it. (I don't think there was a limit on the card)"

Several years ago, when he started his business, he got an American Express business card. He had to do a lengthy phone interview with them before final approval, he spoke about his baby, new business, etc. About a month later, his dad just notice on his monthly credit report that he had a new American Express card - they did it in my hubby's name, with his dad's SS & birthdate! So in that interview, they thought it was a 65 yr old man taking about his baby and young kids, new business, etc. They both got out of that debt with no issues - American Express had to admit to being at fault. They closed the card and nothing was owed."

I don't have anyone to help with the decorating, but I still bake simpler things, and love to cook as well. My 19yo son has inherited my love for cooking and is starting to cook a lot now. I also love making homemade chocolates. I've accumulated over a hundred candy molds over the years, and it allows me to be creative without hurting my hands. I also love to do crafts, and do all different kinds of arts and crafts with my 8yo daughter. I'm actually going to start teaching her how to cross stitch soon."

AmItheAsshole,fdmeu32,t1_fdlzmpd,1578547569.0,My daughter would love that!! You and your partner both sounds like amazing people!! My hubby and I are the same way when it comes to gift giving. We just moved 4½ hours away so Christmas was tight this year. He and I agreed we would make it all about the kids. He still insisted on getting me some Stitch pajama pants (I needed warm pjs & LOVE Stitch!) and his gift was a neck and shoulder rub after work. Our greatest gifts were seeing the kids faces since they didn't expect much. (And moving to a much happier place was worth it for all of us!!)
AmItheAsshole,fdlysvk,t1_fdl0b9k,1578535735.0,"There are absolutely different types of addicts, when it comes to what they are and aren't willing to do for drugs. I'm a recovering opiate addict, as is my husband. We worked hard to support our addiction. In the beginning we both had normal jobs, then went into business for ourselves so we could be more in control of our working times. We'd get up early, fighting being sick to go do a smaller job and get enough money to get our fix, just so we could go do bigger jobs. We also still took care of our kids, and were very much functioning addicts. (We became addicts through doctors who didn't educate us on pain meds and addiction, back in the early/mid 2000's before the opiate crisis got so big)  I also knew people who would rob their family blind (including a family member who stole from my then preteen son and tried to blame me, even after I was already in recovery), girls who would offer ""favors"" to my husband for a pill, and more. I do think a lot has to do with the type of person you are without the addiction, but it's also how far you are willing to let the addiction control you. My husband and I made a promise to each other that, even in our worst, we would never let the addiction change who we were. That's how we survived it with still having a good marriage, good relationships with our kids (who are great kids), and no unrepairable damage done to family relationships. It helped that we also had good support from family and friends. I'm sure it's a lot harder without that."

That's pain I wouldn't wish on anyone and my heart truly goes out to anyone who suffers from them. My husband gets migraines so I understand the debilitating pain you were suffering through at the time. He also takes Sumatriptan, but he's never had the nasal spray type. The pills work ok for him, if he catches it early enough, but he prefers the injections. Even with that, he still gets one it two a year that are only helped by going to the hospital and getting a Migraine Cocktail. Those take a couple days away from him, including recovery time."

The crazy thing is, the one who will eat everything is tiny and not the least bit fat, and the one who I mentioned liking chips and Goldfish eats a healthy diet (other than the tail off a Goldfish cracker, or a piece of chip even smaller maybe 2 times a month) and she's the bigger one. The vet said she's just a big girl (she's long and tall too), but assured me she's healthy. She's also very active and playful. I'll always be very careful with her eating habits to make sure she doesn't get any bigger. (She's the sweetest little core Kitty ever!)"

My ex has only spoken to my son on the phone twice, and has never seen him (even tho I know of at least 2 times he was our city) I was lucky enough to meet an amazing man right about the time my son turned 3, we started dating seriously when my son was 5, and we're married 2 years later. They don't call either each other ""step"" - they are Dad and Son. (Most of my son's friends don't even know he's not his real dad) My son is going to be 20 in March - he struggled with my ex's absence in his life when he was like 15/16, while also struggling with depression and anxiety brought on by severe bullying in school (ended up having to withdraw him on his 16th bday, it was so bad & school didn't care) but in the last year he's really found himself and is doing great.

There are different laws in each state, and the states don't always work so well together to enforce the laws. When I decided to file for child support from my ex, I first looked into hiring a lawyer. Unfortunately, because I was in Florida and he was in Texas, no lawyer would touch it. I was also told if he decided to stop paying (thankfully he paid up until 2 months before my son's 18th birthday)  it would be very difficult to do anything about it due to being in different states."

He said he felt we had a strong connection, and out of the 3 women he had gone on dates with when separated from his ex, I was the only one who respected that his son came first.
