Or do all different patterns on each or same pattern (stencil) in different color paint in the rise? Ombré shades of dark green into lighter green? Gold accents could also be really nice. Can’t imagine putting anything fancy on the tread without significant wear.

FinancialPlanning,ff4zjbc,t3_erlrg0,1579576242.0,"Could you maybe rent in jersey or LI for a year before you buy? I live in Hoboken - commute door to door is about 45 mins (to flatiron) and is about $200 (1.60 bus fare plus 2.75 for the path each way). Seems like you’ve factored in a car, car insurance but have you thought about commuting costs and time? Also need to consider hours for childcare (if your child is at a day care) and being able to make drop off/pick up times. I think finding a location within the amount of time you’re willing to commute will significantly influence where you wind up. Maybe renting for another year out in the burbs will help you determine whether or not you’d like to buy.."

FinancialPlanning,fdkf5fk,t1_fdjzg8a,1578502558.0,"This is very true. If you’re not ready to jump ship, look online and see if you can find similar jobs in your area and look at what the average salary is in your role and industry and that will allow you to see if you’re underpaid or making close to/more than the average. 

If you’re making close to/more than the average, going to another company may not give you a significant pay raise (unless you’re spectacular at your job and they REALLY want you - they’ll make you an offer you can’t refuse). 

Ex: my first job in NYC I was paid about $10,000 less than the rest of the people on my team in the exact same position. During my first annual review period, I got a 13% raise (which is very high) which brought my salary closer to the average of the rest of the team in my exact role. The following years at the same company, only got a “cost of living” raise of about 1.5%. After researching the same position in my area, I learned I was still making about $20k below the average. I was able to take my experience to a new company that paid me within average salary for the area. 

If you’re underpaid and want to ask for a raise, think about the work you’ve done and how it’s contributed to the productivity of the company and how you’ve contributed to the company’s overall goals/successes. Basically, you need to quantify your work, productivity, and achievements to further justify why you should get a raise. It doesn’t guarantee a raise but if you have no facts backing up your request, it may be hard for a manager to see why a raise is justified. Because I work in a corporate setting, I know that my manager needs to talk to her manager about me getting a raise and if I don’t give her reasons as to why I deserve it, she has no reasons to give to her manager. 

Make sense?"
dating_advice,fdkalhz,t3_ekteax,1578499808.0,"Vent 1: I reached out to a guy who posted in the r/foreveralonedating subreddit who was venting about chicks ghosting on him. Literally asked him 5 questions trying to engage him in conversation (waited to ask the next question once he answered the previous one) to which he responded with one or two word answers. He literally did not ask me one question in exchange - not even a “how about you” in response to my questions. And then,  complete silence. Now, I am by no means heartbroken that this man didn’t take an interest in me but what irks me is that he was venting about girls ghosting him and then did the same to me. Perhaps it was his lack of engagement in these one-sided conversations that led these females to “ghost” him. His account is now deleted so I’m also skeptical that maybe he was trying to sneak around online, I don’t know. Point is, if you’re not interested in me, just tell me. It’s even easier when you’ve never met the person and you can hide behind your cell phone - you don’t even have to face the person. 

Vent 2: I absolutely cannot stand the constant exchange of text messages when getting to know someone (online or in person but I feel like it’s more frequent with online). Obviously if you’re meeting someone online you will have that initial digital exchange but why is it so difficult to pick up the phone and have a 10 minute conversation with a person? Why would I rather read your “ha ha’s” than hear your actual laugh? Why would I rather read your questions in black and white than hear the variation in the tone of your voice? If you’re falling asleep at night to the thought of someone, wouldn’t you rather be able to play back the sound of the conversation in your head versus second guessing if someone interpreted your sarcasm as intended? Also when getting to know someone, why is it necessary to tell me about how good or bad you slept? Or how bored you are at work? I want to know about the things that made you who you are. Please tell me those things, not as a text."

conspiracy,fcyn1rk,t1_fcykgyz,1578083100.0,"Real life - I saw an article a few weeks back stating he’ll bring his financials to light if we re-elect him. I interpreted that as “drag out this impeachment trial as long as you’d like (literally so it goes into his second term) and give the people something else to focus on while I maybe do some shady stuff on the side that’s not as public.” Even if he does get impeached, I really think he’s going to get re-elected. Pardon my French, but as ridiculous as many think he is, he’s a smart business man. I truly believe he uses his social graces (or lack there of) to distract the majority while he schemes under the radar. 

I don’t have twitter but I wouldn’t be surprised if he was sending out tweets about his NYE celebrations so we could all focus and make comments on his personal life while he executes an attack on Soleimani with none of us knowing about it. 

Just my thoughts on the matter."

I went through a similar situation where my vet mentioned seeing a specialist to do neurological tests on my dog for something but he said ""you'd be spending thousands to find out what your dog does not have"".

dogs,fcndx1p,t1_fcm2y3i,1577809675.0,"He's never had an allergy test - the whole basis was off of what a ""dog food nutritionist"" at a pet store recommended, which was grain and chicken free. When I first rescued my boy, he was very dry and itchy which could have 1000% been due to the stressful situation he was in. I've given him bits of chicken over the last 3 years and he's never showed signs of dry skin/itchiness but I don't think I've given him enough chicken to warrant a reaction. Not really sure though if a small amount would set off the allergies or no, though. 

He's had my friend's dogs food with chicken and hasn't shown any issues but again, it's once in a blue moon in that regard. I imagine I can start mixing some dry food with chicken ingredients into what he's got now to see if he shows any reactions in a longer term setting."
