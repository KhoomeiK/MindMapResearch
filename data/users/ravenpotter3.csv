- the oldest person we can trace back to cane over from America on one of William Penn’s ships like before the whole revolutionary war
- I’m related to someone who was a millionaire during the American industrial revolution
- I’m related (not directly by blood) to someone who was a famous doctor and was like one fo the first doctors to really start to understand that mental illness was caused by other things and not demons (he also some messed up beliefs about stuff and also did some not good things too)
- related to someone who basically had to yeet our of France in the middle of the night during the revolution because they were a Nobel and connected to Marie Antoinette (idk how exactly) so people kinda wanted to kill them. They basically left in the middle of the night and basically brought nothing with them."
AskReddit,fffj8a8,t1_fff9dem,1579885134.0,That’s really interesting that the placebo effect can do things like that. (Is that the right word? I forget exactly what it’s called when someone thinks somethings does something but in reality it does nothing and they think it does the thing)
AskReddit,fffiqa2,t3_et8ioy,1579884830.0,I don’t know all of the details but I know my grandpa on my dad’s side (who I have never met) was in the navy and around the Caribbean... and nothing really even happened there. My grandpa on my mom’s side went to war and was in the army (I’m not sure where). After the war (or maybe at the end of it?) I think they went to Japan and stayed there for a short time. He didn’t do much because I think he got injured (not bad or anything) so he didn’t fight as much. He hasn’t told me too much about the war but I maybe the next time I see him I can ask some more questions. Also he helped out at a orphanage (maybe in japan?). He doesn’t have any really bad traumatic memories (as far as I know.) from the war and he was pretty lucky during it. I can’t remember all of the details of everything but I know that our family has everything written down somewhere.
