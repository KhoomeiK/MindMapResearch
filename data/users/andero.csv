I think one reviewer raised it as a question once, but we were able to get it by without much fuss, we just needed to explain. One might argue it's less unusual of a sample than mTurk or at least no more unusual.

Anyway, if you're looking to control for a particular variable, just measure it. I typically want to measure demographics anyway so it makes those easy to control. Think about whatever stereotype you want (e.g. political viewpoint) and you can measure it. Granted, there's going to be a self-selection bias, and there always it; just make sure that doesn't break your research question or you'll have to find a different source.

Reddit is a great source because it's groups of people self-selecting into interest groups. You'd never find so many such people in one place, filtered by hobbies and interests. Whatever you want to study, there's probably a subreddit for that."

Nope.

>Post-hoc power analysis...

Yeah, post-hoc power is bad and should not be used. One could do a sensitivity analysis instead, though. 

>A priori power analysis assumes you already know the true population criteria.

Not true. You are making an estimate, then testing to see if there is such an effect. The point of running the study is to see if such an effect exists.  
If you run a study without enough power, your study is too likely to be null in the uninformative way, i.e. a waste of time. Plus, if you run many underpowered studies, you're going to find significant effects only in cases where noise causes the study to overestimate the effect size. This will lead to a replication crisis, which is part of how we got where we already are.

Better yet, one can try to power for the smallest effect-size of interest, as described in Daniel Lakens' courses on Coursera, [Improving Your Statistical Inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences?) and [Improving Your Statistical Questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions). For example, I might argue that if my intervention only changes scores on the HAMD by 1 point on average, that isn't big enough to care about. Then, I power to find an effect size based on the minimum change score I would be interested in. One could also power based on width of confidence intervals.

If you have enough power, there are ways of estimating whether your effect size is reliably so small that you wouldn't care about it. Then, you would be able to conclude that it's not worth pursuing any further. Contrast this to the case of the uninformative null, wherein you have wide confidence intervals and, while there is no significant effect, the 95% CI includes large enough effect sizes that you would be interested in them, so running the study tells you nothing (i.e. a underpowered study with a non-significant result does not tell you that there is no meaningful effect; [absence of evidence is not evidence of absence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence)).

>For example, is spending a million dollars to save the life of one child a big or small investment? You tell me.

That's a different question altogether.

Schizoid,ffayld6,t3_esh8r7,1579747493.0,">... free will ...

""Free will"" doesn't exist: you are correct. The closest people get is redefining ""free will"" as compatiblism, which defines away the problem.  
This bit is an aside, but I just thought I'd mention it.

>Can people manipulative/coerce me into being different from how am I now?

Kinda, but it is probably moot for the most part. Here's my take on this:

When trying to influence the world, including when trying to get a person to have a different idea/belief, you have three options plus a fourth special option: 1) Force, 2) Charisma, 3) Reason, 4) Money.

1. Force: Chances are, nobody is going to physically beat you in order to change your mind. Moot concern in this case.

2. Charisma: If you are weak of mind or easily manipulated, someone could convince you to believe something different. This is the realm of advertisement and sexual courtship. This is charm and the cult of personality. With SPD, you may be less affected by the emotional pleas of others, though, so maybe you're less susceptible to this. Maybe you're more susceptible to this so you try to put up your guard if anyone gets too close. 

3. Reason: When someone makes a good argument, they change your mind. 

4. Money: Money is a special currency where someone can convince someone else to do something without using Force, Charisma, or Reason: they just pay them material wealth and that does the trick.

The other thing to consider is that sometimes, you want other people to be able to change your mind. For example, you want someone to be able to use Reason to change your mind. That helps you be less wrong over time. Also, if you have a disordered, dysfunctional way of being as a person, chances are that other people who are doing better in the world could provide you with insights that would help you live a better life. In those cases, you want them to be able to change your mind so that you can become a better version of yourself. You don't want to stay the same if you're in a bad place; it's sometimes better to change.

So, sure, your therapist was wrong about free will. That's fine, some people don't study philosophy. That's not their expertise. Anyway, that seems like it might be a tangent in therapy that's not really getting at what you want to do to make your life better.

The strangest thing is that now, a few years later, I'm older than my older brother. That's the strangest thing and it's one of the things that can bring me great sadness if I linger on it.  
I'd say something, but what is there to say. Your brother died. There are no words.

By the time my brother died I had been to many a funeral. My uncle died when I was in grade 8, my grandmother in first-year university, my other uncle when I was finishing university, then my brother two years later. Both uncles were my father's brothers, and my father's father died when my dad was ten or eleven. He's lost so many people so close to him.

When my more recent uncle died, my older brother took it upon himself to call me and my other siblings to reconnect. We were always on good terms, but we had never been close. By seeing our father lose his brother, he realized that our parents will die and the people you go through life with are your siblings. He built a connection where we would chat on the phone every few months to catch up, which now myself and my other siblings continue on. Now we're closer than we ever were and it's good to check in every few months. I also chat with my parents. It's not a burden because it's so infrequent; it builds a very stable long-term connection and we all get along anyway.  
That may be something you can take away: if you wish you spend more time with him, make more time to spend and connect with any remaining siblings and with your parents. Family can be a touchy subject, especially on this subreddit, but if you have a neutral/decent/good relationship with your family, it's nice to maintain or enhance that, remembering that they will die. Connection is a limited-time offer. [This may help hit the idea home.](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html)

My main note would be that grief is different for different people so you do you. Don't let anyone tell you how you should be reacting or harass you for not doing something they might do. You work through it in your way.

>Now if I suicide my parents would lose both their sons and I just can't do that to them. It would devastate them too much, but what do I do. I never planned to live long.

I read in [a book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/456496.What_Do_You_Say_After_You_Say_Hello_) that there should be two rules for suicide:  
1. No person should commit suicide before both their parents are dead.  
2. No parent should commit suicide before all of their children are adults.  
This rings true to me. You don't owe anyone anything, but it's considerate because you are correct: these are the people you would devastate and you can avoid doing that harm.

As for what to do, well, find something you enjoy and find something you can get paid for, maybe the same thing, maybe different. Make a basic plan for how you could become closer to your ideal version of yourself and put yourself on that trajectory in life. Figure out what you value and go for that. You know you're going to die so you might as well go for what you want in life before it all comes crashing down. It might take a while, but that's what you've got: [time](https://i.redd.it/k4cef2m06cb41.jpg). 

I found that accepting that I wasn't going to suicide until my parents died really helped me put together a more fulfilling life trajectory and cut out the bullshit and procrastination. It helped me engage more because it was the decision to live fully while I'm alive rather than hem and haw about whether I should quit this whole thing early. I can revisit suicide once they're dead, though I've built such a nice life for myself in the meantime that I'm enjoying the ride and have less incentive to suicide by indifference. I'm ready to die at any moment, which makes me free to live."

Telling me that I'm repressing stuff could be viewed as a form of gaslighting, including in the roundabout way that you're doing it. I understand you (probably) don't mean it that way, but people who try to take over never mean to be the ""bad guys"". They're doing what they think is right, it just happens to be wrong for the people they're stepping on. You know this, of course.

In any case, if I'm being blunt here, I'm not going to take psychological advice from someone as depressed and dissatisfied as you. That's a very blunt way of saying that, but I'm not sure how to say it softer. Perhaps you went digging for gold and ""found"" something to assuage your sunk-cost fallacy of doing five years of therapy. I've done therapy multiple times. I was very efficient when I did; I got shit done in five sessions, not five years. That said, I'm not dealing with childhood trauma or gender stuff or self-hatred. I'm happy. I honestly don't have that much shit to deal with because, like I've said, I'm very effective so I make sure I get everything I need, plus most of what I want.

Like I said, I'm integrated, which took years of efforts toward integration. You're making the pre-trans fallacy. That's okay, but you'll understand if I reject your advice as unfruitful. Or maybe you think I'm repressing repression, in which case, that's fine, too. It really doesn't matter if you believe me. It's my lived reality and that's primary for me.

I didn't say genetics. Here's what I said, again:

>>If you're asking for an objective reason, the reason is that your neurons are connected in a certain way that reflects your preferences, and those neuronal connections are an extremely complex chaotic combination of physics, DNA, the circumstances of your pre-natal and peri-natal environment, your childhood, and your immediate past and present. Ultimately, the ""reason"" is circular: you are the way you are because everything in the universe happened the way it did so here we are with you, like this at this moment.  
It's not an ""explanation"": it's a description. There is no ""reason"". The universe is not reasonable, it just is.

DNA is one part of a huge list that includes everything about your environment, including *the universe*.

The point is, you are asking a question where the type of answer you seek doesn't exist (there is no ""explanation""); the answer is the reality (it is a description). There is no one ""why"" for answering how your neurons are configured the way they are; there is no ""cause"" we could talk about in any realistic way because there are countless ""causes"" combined together. I'm not playing word-games. I'm talking about how complex physical reality is.

You have DNA. That DNA determines how your neurons are built from proteins. When you were in the womb, your DNA and pre-natal environment grew your brain in a certain way according to evolution and the environmental circumstances of your mother (who has her own entire history that made her the way she was). If she ate differently, you would literally have been a different person on the molecular level. But that's not all, that's only one of countless peels of the onion.  
Your neurons react to their environment and fire in relation to stimuli coming from your body. All these sensations wire your brain differently. If you were breast-fed versus not, if you had many toys versus not, if your parents held you versus not, if they spoke to you in statements versus questions, etc. Countless circumstantial things wired your young brain to be what it was as a child.  
Then you were a toddler walking around, and a kid, and a teen, and a young adult, and so on. All your experiences were and are wiring your brain. Every time enough photons set off the receptors in your eyes, that lights sends signals into your cortex, and those signals rewire your brain. It's an ongoing process (neuroplasticity via Hebbian learning) that is constantly rewiring the billions upon billions of neurons in your brain. Neurons firing (and thus wiring) is how you are reading right now. Reading right now is literally physically changing your brain micro-states.

There was no special moment where your neurons configured to ""morality"". 

There is no ""why"". Your question is unanswerable.

>I objectively have no values.

Philosophically, sure, but pragmatically, you act in the world as if you value certain things.  
As a pragmatist, I'd call those things your ""values"". Yeah, there's no Platonic ideal of ""values"", but so what? You pragmatically demonstrate your values via your behaviour.  
If you don't like the word ""value"", sub in ""preference"". You have preferences, right? Same thing in my books because ""values"" don't really exist because ""morality"" doesn't exist because nihilism is true; ""moral values"" are  preferences about certain kinds of situations we humans define as ""moral"". Nature doesn't see the difference between whether you like vanilla or whether you think you should pull the trolly-problem lever.

>I want to know why despite my lack of values, I am still inclined to act morally, and by morally I mean the way a non-nihilist would interpret it.

Non-nihilists don't share one moral system. Your comparison doesn't make sense, but you don't need it.

You are inclined to act according to your preferences. Why are your preferences the way they are? There is no answer for that question because that is a causation question and the causal chain leading up to your current preferences is literally the causal chain of all atoms in the universe. Again, not playing word games, just thinking literally here. This is why you have no free will, either. The universe is atoms ticking forward according to physical laws and the atoms circumscribed by your skull are not fundamentally different than the atoms outside it.

Why do you act the way you think some abstract ""other""'s moral system would have you act? I don't know, because you didn't come up with your own system and are just running on the default ideology you got based on where and when you were born? But you're doing that because that's who the universe made you to be (i.e. you were never free to be any different because free will doesn't exist). That's all post-hoc storytelling, though. The true answer is that it is unknowable and that it is the state of the universe as a whole to be this particular way right now."

I don't. I doubt that you do. I doubt that there is any decision not to murder at all. Murder is simply something you don't want to do. It is as simple as not having a thought, which is something you don't control. It's like not being interested in football or origami or euchre. There's nothing deep about it, no decision at all, logical or otherwise. It is not a desire in the first place. At least, that's what it's like to me.  
That was one thing I found odd back in the day when I would talk with religious people about this. They'd ask what stops an atheist from murdering someone, and I'd say it's because I don't want to, not because of a moral code. Frankly, if they *want* to murder someone and the only thing stopping them is their irrational religious code... yikes!

Now that we have that covered:  
I disagree with the wording of morality because I think it confuses things. It's vague. There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" in the abstract. I want to propose that there's a more useful way to think about it.

Action/inaction further/frustrate goals. Goals are aligned/misaligned with values. Values are the thing.  
Values have a dynamic priority to them. For example, I value being sated, but that is low-priority right after a meal. When I'm really hungry, being sated is relatively high-priority. I value being in the proper temperature range, but when I am, that's a lower priority than other things. I value autonomy, which is a higher priority to me than pleasure (which I also value); I think autonomy facilitates a greater overall opportunity for pleasure. And so on.

Each ""moral"" system —which is really an ideology— might be more fruitfully described as a priority-listing of values. Values is what defines ""Noble"" and what defines ""Contemptible"". You want to pursue your values because you value them, i.e. you want to be your definition of Noble (good, proper, right) because you value the things that make up the definition you created. It's circular exactly because there is no ""moral"" foundation because nihilism is objectively true. Nevertheless, out of no objective morality, you still subjectively value things.

Overall, then, the question ""why do I want to do the right thing?"" is trivialized: You want to do the right thing because it's right. Or in my rewording, ""Why do I want to do what I value: I want to do what I value because I value it."" It's circular.

The other question, ""Why do I value what I value?"" That's a doozy. There is no foundation, remember. I think that some things you just value and there is no explanation that will satisfy. Again, it's just like asking, ""Why do I prefer vanilla ice-cream over strawberry ice-cream?"" If you're asking for an objective reason, the reason is that your neurons are connected in a certain way that reflects your preferences, and those neuronal connections are an extremely complex chaotic combination of physics, DNA, the circumstances of your pre-natal and peri-natal environment, your childhood, and your immediate past and present. Ultimately, the ""reason"" is circular: you are the way you are because everything in the universe happened the way it did so here we are with you, like this at this moment.  
It's not an ""explanation"": it's a description. There is no ""reason"". The universe is not reasonable, it just is."

DungeonWorld,fe5v3qs,t3_enust4,1578875627.0,"I find I prep different things and the prep is much less technical so it feels more fun.

In DW, I prep Fronts, which are narrative. I prep NPCs a bit, but no stat block: a DW NPC for me is usually an evocative image I find, a name, a look, and a motive (some reason for them being around); they might also be prepped with an accent, style, or mannerism.  
I also prep some locations because I'm not at the level of GM yet where I can extemporaneously deliver satisfyingly detailed prose descriptions. [I don't think visually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia), but I know my players really enjoy evocative language. I write well, so I prep that stuff in advance and it helps set the stage.  
I find the game also flows better when I prep some adventure hooks. My players are not yet at the stage where they have enough internal motivation to propel things forward so there are a couple options if they're looking for work, but I always remind them, ""Or do whatever you want"". They're learning that looking for work doesn't pay as well as adventuring. That's part of what I philosophically want the world to convey, too: mundane life is mundane and an adventurer must seek adventure at great risk to really grow.

Sometimes I also prep special scenarios, like dreams/visions. I love dreams/visions as narrative tools.  
I also prep special custom moves when I figure they'll come up.

Contrast with GMing 5e: I prepped the same things, but everything was defined by stat blocks, which were way more work to put together; too combat-focused. DW uses tags, which makes it so easy, and if I need a stat block, I can take one minute at the table to put it together while people refill drinks and such.  
I also found that in 5e, I needed a lot more adventure hooks and actually needed to introduce linear scenes for players to move through because the characters were so much less internally motivated. D&D's characters are combat-oriented and you can use it for narrative, but the game doesn't help you. In DW, the Bonds and Alignment XP triggers propel players to do things. My players ask for and set their own scenes to help each other accomplish Bonds. We also changed the default End Of Session XP triggers to be more narrative and less about monsters and treasure:

**Session Goals**  
Learn something about the world  
Learn something about each other  
Do something that increases your reputation  

Because of this, players call for scenes where they can explore or interact. In 5e, it was way more often the case that players would look at me to tell them what happened next and to point them in specific directions. I much prefer a sandbox type game as a GM where I move things in the world and the players react. It's like playing chess: I move a pawn, they move a rook, I move a bishop, and suddenly they're in check so they move their knight, and we dance. In 5e, it was more like they wanted me to give them a colouring book where there's a plot already decided and you get to colour it, but colour within the lines. Oh, and all your colours are swords and knives and fireballs and axes.  
I prefer the chess-dance mixed metaphor."

I don't have it. My number one thought would be that it's probably a symptom of other things. My first question would be: do you have the pillars of life in order?

But yeah, anhedonia? Hit the gym. Easy? No. Rewarding? Typically, yeah. What if it's not rewarding once you're in great shape? Then you've got a brain-chemistry issue so talk to a psychiatrist.

Sounds like you're not integrated. That's sort of my entire point about values and living a value-driven life from the start. It doesn't surprise me that you don't have it figured out: your emotional state exudes that, even though earlier you said you did know what you value. Figuring it out is a thing that helps one overcome existential depression. That's my broader point. You don't just brute-force intellect. You integrate and become a whole complete person by understanding what you value, not just what you *think* you value or what you *want* to value or *should* value or *want to want* to value.

You figure out what you value via a process of thinking/feeling you value something, then committing to it. Then you watch where your behaviours deviate from your values. You take those experience as information in the feedback loop: when your behaviour indicates you values something other than what you thought/felt, either you A) update your values or you B) double-down by changing your behaviours. In time, via this feedback loop, your behaviours and values become aligned. Integrated. Could call it ""self actualization"" as well.  
I'm integrated. My ""unconscious"" values are the same as my conscious values. It was a process that took years, but it was more worth it than any other project I've taken on. Plus, I'm the only one that could do it for myself and if I didn't do it, it wouldn't get done. I was wholly responsible.

>'m just suspecting I'm talking to a too-disconnected-from-feelings-and-needs-to-suffer type schizoid

Not disconnected, integrated. I feel things plenty and I'm connected and aware of those feelings.   
This reminds me of the pre-trans fallacy. It's like how, in Buddhism, someone might (incorrectly) think equanimity means disconnection or depersonalization. The bit about suffering reminds me of the Buddhist parable about [the second arrow](http://mountainsangha.org/second-arrow/). I'm not Buddhist, to be clear, they just happened to have talked about this sort of thing so their ideas are helpful and the dominate the vocabulary.

>sometimes-acutely-aware-both-of-needs-not-being-met-and-lacking-ability-to-get-them-met schizoid-avoidant type like me

You're right, I don't really relate to people who don't meet their own needs. I'm very effective in my life so I'm consistently meeting my needs. If I wasn't meeting my needs, I'd change. My needs are priority-one; that's what makes them ""needs"" (as opposed to ""wants""). I'm very effective, though, so I meet the vast majority of my wants and nice-to-haves, also. I probably have relatively simple desires, as well.  
Here's the thing: If you're not meeting your needs, what are you doing in the meantime? There's so much time! If you're not meeting your needs, you're either fatally incapable or, more likely, you're focusing your attention on the wrong things in life. It's like if someone feels bad because their fat, then as a response to that, they eat more. That's foolish and they know it's foolish. Akrasia writ large.

It's like you said, ""one has to first be aware of things, in order to accept, and then change them"". This is actually my area of study: I'm doing my PhD on meta-awareness, which has to do with noticing when our behaviours are not aligned with our intentions, goals, and values. The thing is, once you know what your values are, you can more readily identify when you are acting against them (akrasia). Then, you have to actually deploy some willpower to ""do the right thing"", i.e. realign yourself to your values (or realize you value your behaviours and update your values). Personal responsibility, you know? I'm not saying every person has sufficient willpower to overcome their own weaknesses immediately, but what they can do is take steps and develop their willpower. Most people, I assert, know what they need to do to make their life better, but they don't do it. I don't think it's an awareness problem per se. Very few people eating at McDonalds think they are making healthy choices, methinks."

>values versus core beliefs embedded from childhood versus attention versus temperament

You can let your childhood beliefs go, right? I believed in Santa Claus and Jesus Christ when I was a young child, but not anymore!  
The etiology is not important, i.e. it doesn't really matter where an idea came from. What matters is not the past, it's the present and the future. If you've got disadvantageous beliefs left over from childhood, process and replace them in the present so they're overcome in the future. Each time they come up, you replace them with a new belief; eventually, they don't come up anymore because the new belief come up instead.

>As for the attitude, yeah, what you say is reasonable. Sort of how intellectual attitudes are often reasonable. But yeah, feelings are different.

That's a very defeatist attitude. Feelings are not special. Ideas, feelings, sensations, and everything else you experience are all expressions of your brain. If you cannot master your emotions, they will master you. If you give up before you begin, you'll never succeed.  
It may not be **easy** to change. Nobody said it was. Most things that are worth doing aren't easy, though.

Personally, since I take this topic more casually, I wouldn't even appeal to metrics or statistics with citations. I'd just use my knowledge from studying history. History was bloody and brutal for most people for most of history. It's still not perfect, but damn, it's way, way better. But like I said, I don't want to toil in the dirt all day.

>I'm currently on an island that's just seen the worst drought anyone alive can remember

Right, which you freely chose to do with your life, right? You were able to leave your home and travel to somewhere, perhaps on the crazy invention that is an airplane. You have the ability to move great distances without being concerned that the probability of dying on the way is non-trivial. You don't need to be overly concerned with malnutrition or starvation, infection and disease, or bandits and thieves. You didn't have to serve in your nation's army for years before being considered a citizen. If you don't like your job, you can quit and find a new one instead of being under the domination of a lord. There's no mongol horde descending on your territory to utterly ravage your village. There's no Achaemenid, Macedonian, or Roman army sacking your town, killing all the men, raping all the women.  
You're right, it's not perfect. I'm also right: it's way better.

I don't think you were being a jerk. I'm not trying to be a jerk either. Just different views. Again, part of the beauty of seeing different values. We don't need to worry about convincing each other since we're bound to disagree by our values.

>It probably helps that I'm a little bit of a Luddite, so I don't really consider oligarchy with microwaves to be some drastic improvement in quality of life for the masses over feudalism with oxen. (I might devalue whatever ""good things"" you're thinking of.)

I value books, the internet, modern medical advances, my warm house, being able to shop at the butcher instead of spend my time toiling on personal agriculture. My work, which I love, is scientific research and academia; in other words, my entire career (that I love) is predicated on society being advanced enough to have the basic necessities of life under control so we have time for ""higher"" pursuits of knowledge and science.

Still, if you cannot see the quality of life improvement over feudalism then you are blinded by your ideology. I get it that things are not perfect, but things are definitely better by nearly any standard of ""better"" that includes human well-being in the equation. It's like saying that things are just as bad for trans people as they were 50 or 100 years ago. That's simply untrue. Things are bad, but WAY better. That's actually one of the thing about modern hyper-progressive ideologies that I find quite distasteful: there is a blurring of language toward black-and-white thinking. There is so much grey, so much progress, and it gets ignored because it's not perfect. It incites divisive thinking and turns allies into adversaries, e.g. when people yell at heterosexual white cis-males as if they're evil for just existing (which is extremely hypocritical). It's a bad look. I'm not saying you're doing that, just mentioning it because it came to mind.

This is a bit technical as it gets into argumentation, reasoning, and debates. More broadly, argumentation is about persuasion, which includes writing scientific articles. You'd have to be interested in arguments to get through this. Learning here would be learning by transferring valuable concepts, not directly made for academics.

More on the methods side, I'd say these two Coursera courses by Daniel Lakens are **maximally** relevant, even if you just watch the videos (as I did): [Improving Your Statistical Inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences?) and [Improving Your Statistical Questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions). Every academic psychologist should do these; it would make the field better. I only write it lower because I'm not sure what you're looking for.

No matter, though. One of the great things about knowing what you value is knowing when there's no point arguing. When someone values something different than you, you already know what your fundamental disagreement is. Maybe if I valued what you value, I'd feel the way you feel. Likewise, for you with my values. We don't need to go back and forth about what should be done, though, because we want different things. I'm not ""turning away"" from what you value, I just don't care about it; it is irrelevant to my action plans. It's like *not* watching football because you don't care about sports.  
There are no universal ""right true"" values so there's no ground to argue if you value different things. We don't have a chance to agree since we don't want the same things.

It sounds like you'll feel better doing that than you would feel if you turned away from that roller-coaster, though. Sometimes you gotta do the hard thing to feel fulfilled, but if your choice is to fight an unwinnable battle, you're signing up for being sad that it doesn't work out.

Totally! I was talking about the shorthand as being a barrier to progress, though. ""Anarchist"" is tied to the outcome. 

On the other hand, your values —fairness, non-hierarchy, autonomy, and perhaps others?— are things you can build into your life. This kind of thing would inform careers that would fulfill you, right? You're not going to be a happy investment banker with those values, but you might be a festival organizer or a political person or someone who works at a co-op.

Sounds like you're already pretty far along, though. I'm not going to belabour the point.

>I think it's pretty difficult to not be influenced (depressed) by subpar outcomes of my actions

Everything you're saying makes sense. I've been there. Multiple times. Eventually, I adjusted my values and built a better life for myself. 

One of the things about life is that you can stare into the parts that make you sad. Some things never change and they will make you sad every time you look at them for the rest of your life. Sadness, grief, disappointment; these are all useful, for a time. Then, they're not so useful anymore. Yes, children are starving. Yes, people die. Yes, society is unfair. Are you going to stare at that unchangeable thing and be sad, or are you going to turn toward something you can do something about?

It's fine to be existentially depressed sometimes. If you're paying attention, you'd be hard-pressed not to be disappointed in this world. At some point, you better move on, though, or else you're going to be sad for the rest of your life. It makes sense that it will come on every so often. Why struggle against it?

I'd wager that this is especially true for you since you value ""fairness"". That's never been a value of mine because, when I was a kid, my dad would say, ""The world isn't fair"". It's true, the world isn't fair. Nature isn't ""fair"". Even if wealth was redistributed magically so that every human being was given an equal ""fair"" share, that would not make society ""fair"". Nature made us all different. Some people are smarter than others and as long as that's true, life will never be ""fair"". If this basic truth of reality makes you unhappy, you are correct, you are powerless to change that. You can either stare at that fact and be sad, let it stare back into you and accept it, or turn away and deal with more tractable issues in life.

Anyway, not everyone shares your values so you don't need to feel bad for anyone else, if that is a factor of your existential depression.  
I don't value fairness so it doesn't bother me that society is unfair. I actually prefer some hierarchy because I'd rather have structure than chaos; I believe there is value in superior-inferior relationships, like teacher-student, mentor-mentee. I do value autonomy, but I've got plenty of that within the capitalist structure; I don't have sci-fi utopian level autonomy, but I'm very able to decide my own direction in life."

Sometimes you highlight how smart it is by hitting them and doing no damage, but other times you should how limited it is by using attacks that pierce armour or hitting them somewhere else on the sheet (""Use up their resources"") or showing how it causes some bad thing to happen (""Turn Their Move Back On Them"").

>Being invulnerable isn’t interesting. 

Maybe not for you as a GM. Being practically physically invulnerable could be interesting to the player that picked those options, though. Why else would they pick them? Ask the player what they're goal is here. 

As already noted, they are not invulnerable: as a GM you have the power to use weapons or effects that pierce armour or that ignore armour altogether. Hit them with a charm effect or some withering necrotic magic that ages them and drains their strength. Threaten something they cherish, like family, nation, or maybe just treasure. And sometimes, hit their armour and highlight how smart their choice was, how epic it is that a dragon just slammed them against a wall and they're totally okay, just a scratch on the paint. Epic high fantasy!

If you throw mundane monsters at them, you are right, it's less interesting eventually. There's no reason not to adapt, though. If they are high level, they should probably be taking on higher level threats, too. Armour isn't the only thing on their sheet that you can hit, nor it is the only thing in the world. They may functionally opt out of taking simple damage, but so what? That's not the end of the world, right? Hit them elsewhere."
Schizoid,fdhfylk,t1_fdg1q3s,1578421824.0,"see other reply

""anticapitalism"" is not a value, it's an ideology.  
If you commit to unrealistic, implausible, or impossible ideologies, you are committing yourself to being unhappy.

The pragmatic goal for leading a more fulfilling life would be to break apart your ideology into its component values in order to figure out a way that you can realistically enhance them in your life.

For example, have you ever asked someone why they are a vegetarian? There are a variety of reasons and different people have different underlying reasons. Some people think it's healthier, others it's because of ethical concerns for animals, others are concerned about the environmental effects of the meat industry, some just grew up that way and don't like the taste of meat. Knowing the deeper reason is important to understanding how the person operates in a broader context and to think about whether their behaviours are consistent. For example, if someone is vegetarian because of ethics, it would be inconsistent of them to wear leather shoes because leather comes from killing animals. On the other hand, if they think veggie is healthier, wearing leather shoes would be fine.

>There is no ethical consumption under capitalism

Sure, lets take this as a fact.  
Your response to this is to be depressed. Pragmatically speaking, that sucks. It's pretty disadvantageous. Now you have a choice: 1) decide to keep your assessment and stay depressed or 2) reframe and reconsider to see if there's a way to accept this reality and find contentment in other factors of life (hint: there is).

For example, lets say there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. How do I address this? Well, I'm already alive so I guess I have to decide between continuing living unethically or the unethical ramifications of suicide. I decide that I'll keep living because I'm going to die eventually anyway. This decision means I'm going to necessarily be imperfectly ethical. What can I do to limit my unethical consumption? Well, I'm not going to have children so right there I limit my unethical consumption to 1 human's worth instead of creating more unethical humans. Maybe I decide that shopping for local goods is less unethical than shopping for goods produced in poverty-stricken areas (not perfectly ethical, but less unethical). Maybe I decide that I'll buy less in the first place. These are all steps toward being less ethical. Having already accepted that it is implausible/impossible to be an ethically ""perfect"" being, I do my best, and feel fulfilled.

Or, maybe I decide that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism so I'm going to set my life against capitalism. I join protests, I start movements, I read [Ted Kaczynski's manifesto](https://archive.org/details/IndustrialSocietyAndItsFuture-TheUnabombersManifesto). I become a freedom fighter (though history may call me a terrorist). I act on me values and try to change the world. I may fail, but in life I am fulfilled because I'm doing what I feel is important work, even if it's hard.  
This worked in the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution). Capitalism was overthrown. Anyone with any reading of history knows the replacement didn't work out so well, but I bet Lenin felt pretty fulfilled when the revolution went through. That's an incredible feat for a person and he will be remembered in history for quite some time.

Or, I decide that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Then I decide I'm not going to do anything about it. I also decide that this is the only way to view this problem and that it is intractable. I feel powerless. I spend the rest of my life feeling depressed because I'm not pursuing what I value.  
That's not the life I want!"

>Whether ACT can actually help one put those values into practice or not, I'm not sure,

That's sort of it's purpose, yeah. Might as well try it, right?

Anti-capitalism isn't a ""fundamental"" value, it is another high-level ideology. Granted, it is different than the mainstream capitalist ideology, but most people have some issues with capitalism, after all.

I'm talking about deeper fundamental values, though. Once you understand those, you really can work toward making sure they are part of your life.  
For example, I value freedom, autonomy, novelty (curiosity), reducing inefficiency. Notice how basic they are. Because of the importance I place on these values, you could probably guess that I'm pretty individualistic. I value freedom/autonomy, so I'm very reticent to lock myself into some responsibility, like getting a pet or binding legal contracts. I am curious (value novelty) so I like to learn a lot of things and that informs my career choices: I need space to learn and grow so I don't get bored. I enjoy reducing inefficiency so being caught in an unchangeable bureaucracy would frustrate me, but if I get the power to fix things so they move better, that brings me great satisfaction.

Note how my values are not tied to a specific political view or a specific philosophical view. Ideologies are not fundamental, they are pre-packaged collections of values and ranked relations between values (priorities).  
For you, I'd suggest that there is something deeper than ""anti-capitalism"". Maybe it's compassion, altruism, challenging dominant ideas, etc. Those are all things you CAN make sure you have in your life.

Part of ACT is the idea that it is a disadvantageous life-choice to hold on to valuing something implausible/impossible because you are setting yourself up for failure. If you'll only ever let yourself be happy when capitalism is dead, well, you've decided you'll probably never be happy. You have chosen powerlessness because you've attached value to something you are not able to disrupt. If you pick apart your system, you may find there are others components that you do value and you could make a different there. It's a pragmatic approach to build a fulfilling life rather than suffering from unrealistic idealism."

It is specifically interested in uncovering and establishing what one personally values and building a life committed to those values, which is a pretty good way to direct oneself toward a fulfilling experience of life.

There is no ""meaning"" in life and the search for such a thing is counterproductive. The pragmatic thing to do to gain fulfillment in light of the fact that nihilism is true is to figure out what you value, then go for that. People with SPD likely don't value ""mainstream"" things so there is no ideological model handed down from society that works for SPD. The ideology handed down from society doesn't work very well for non-SPD people either, but they seem to buy into it more easily. I'd say SPD makes it harder to value family, fame, consumerism, and that sort of ""social status"" stuff; the extreme rejection of these social ideological values causes a stark contrast where the person with SPD doesn't know what to value. Since there is nothing to objectively value (because nihilism is true), that can leave a person in a funk and unsure what to do. The thing to do is create values ex nihilo (Nietzsche's Ubermensch) and the practical implementation of that is to discover what one values for no reason. ACT is a therapy suited to this self-discovery with concrete exercises to accomplish this.

Some of Tony Robbins is pretty okay also, but you need to be ready to reject lots of stuff as well. The exercises, though, are still very valuable."

It's pretty easy for me to write elaborate comments. I generally put some effort into my reddit comments/posts because that's just the kind of person I am. I don't really half-ass anything. Funny side-factoid: years of reddit comments have improved my writing (which is a huge part of my job now) and have also made me better at arguing and discussing things with antagonistic people. I used to be a lot worse at communicating because my writing was more cold/caustic, but practice has helped me cut that shit out. That elaborate backstory is beside the point. The short answer is that I wouldn't comment on reddit if I didn't enjoy it.  
Also, my first comment wasn't only for you, it was for other people so they would know about the inaccuracy of the article. That first comment was to stop misinformation from spreading; the other comments were communicating with you.

Anyway, if I'm honest, it seems like you are running into an ego problem here where you feel like I publicly embarrassed you (if reddit is even ""public"" since you're anonymous). Then being embarrassed got your hackles up. Hence the PM instead of keeping it public, which I'm now circumventing. Why else would you message me directly?

I don't exist as far as your blog is concerned. Your blog would just be more correct, which is favourable for you.

I don't think there's much left to say, right? Either you're going to fix it, or you're not. It's your blog. You already know it's wrong. What's left is asking yourself whether you're okay with it being wrong or whether you want to take the time to edit that section so it's less wrong. I've already said that a dozen different ways, though, so either you'll fix it, or you won't. What else is there to say on the topic? You want to know why I bother? Because it's easy for me to try to provoke you into being better and if you take the bait and do the right thing, that's great, and if not, I feel happy anyway since I tried and I enjoy the process of writing comments anyway.

You don't see the contradiction here? You care acting without self-interest with the express expectation that you will get rewarded for doing so, which is a self-interested motivation.

You have depression? It may be the pragmatist in me, but I wonder about the utility of your world-view/philosophy if you remain depressed. I'm not clear on what the core value of this world-view is, partly because of the above contradiction. It's not a world-view built on truth-seeking: you explicitly call it ""faith"" multiple times. It sounds like your faith has not facilitated fulfillment or an escape from depression, though, so, maybe you could make some tweaks to generate a better versions of your ""faith"".

Your ""But What is the Science?"" section is a mix of incorrect, misrepresentation, and is unsupported by actual science. You're claiming/asserting things we don't know yet. No bueno.

The honest answer regarding the science of microdosing is ""We don't know"". The science hasn't been done yet.

Examples:  

>they stimulate a serotonin receptor called 5-HT2A, which is located in the prefrontal cortex (which just so happens to be just behind our ""third eye."" Coincidence? I think not). Stimulation of this receptor in the prefrontal cortex leads to brain growth, connection, and activity, and also leads to increased memory, cognition, and learning. 

The 5-HT2A receptor is all over the brain, not just in the PFC. And third eye? Come on now, in a ""science"" section? No.  
Stimulating 5-HT2A doesn't do the things you say. There is zero research showing microdosing ""leads to increased memory, cognition, and learning"". 

>This is arguably the most important factor for psychedelics, as this can lead to new neural connections allowing people to defeat cognitive ailments such as depression, psychological addiction, anxiety, PTSD, stuttering, etc.

This is misrepresentation. Again, there is zero scientific evidence that microdosing treats these disorders. The only thing that can be said is that there's a plausible mechanism in neuroplasticity, but there is zero evidence that microdosing actually does anything."
DungeonWorld,fdaj8ev,t1_fd6z8jj,1578246660.0,">One of the other PCs lifted everything

Yeah, this (or its opposite) would be my concern, the one that I'd want to see play-tested to see if it works. It's one of those mechanical things that could really go either way because of it's narrative and interpersonal interaction. Forbiddences puts the Illrigger's core ability in the hands of another player, which could go completely wrong or could work out fine in play. It still feels a bit weird to me, though: if another player is going to lift all your forbiddences, why even have them? What do they add to the narrative? Likewise if they're not going to lift any of them. Maybe other players can only lift one per Bond they have with you? Then there's more potency there since you'll always have at least a forbiddence or two, but they can also lift some?

Maybe it's just playstyles, but I personally would not want to put my core ability in someone else's hands. I play with good people, but I really don't want to have to ask for permission to play my own character, which is how it would feel to me.

Maybe there could be a release-valve on it? What would the work-around be if you want to break a forbiddence so you can earn corruption and use your abilities, but no other PCs are lifting the forbiddences for you? Maybe you could take a debility to lift a forbiddence (a version of Bloody Aegis), which would be a deterrent against doing it all the time, but you could still do it in a pinch? Maybe this would be a separate move you could take?

Just more thoughts :)"
mattcolville,fd6h74a,t1_fd5ovau,1578190964.0,"> feels a bit like ""draw the rest of the fucking owl!""

Yeah, I only skimmed it, but it read like, ""Here's a basic premise: come up with three things. Here's an example... Do that!""

Would be more helpful if it broke down the process more. I find that most ""creatives"" are not very good at breaking down their process. Maybe they don't have a process, they just let their mind wander and then they write down the results. Not sure.

For a process, I'd probably start by figuring out a central narrative purpose for the culture: What philosophical or political ideas am I trying to explore or comment on with this culture?  
What do I think about that philosophical or political idea? What feeling do I want to evoke in the players related to it? What do I want it to look/sound/smell like? What kind of dilemmas do I want to put in front of the players related to the philosophical or political idea? What kinds of questions do I want my players to ask themselves? I don't want there to be simple answers, just grey (my stylistic choice).   
If I know Player A (or their character) is interested in Idea B, how do I challenge that idea with an NPC or social structure? How do I show that idea going awry with a twist? How do I show an idea they hate succeeding? These are the cores of cultures.  

For example, one of my players has some philosophical views that are a bit anti-capitalist. I give him a capitalist society that's working.  
My players are interested in exploring class tension between elves. They emotionally connect with the swamp elves, who were annexed and overtaken by the desert elves. I show the desert elves building a functioning society. They're not ""evil"" in a black-and-white sense. Are they ""oppressive""? I show the swamp elves building a revolution. Are they terrorists or freedom fighters? 

Then, I don't decide any fate. I play to find out what happens. The NPCs are on trajectories, which are the answers to the question ""what would happen if the PCs never arrived or intervened"". Then, we see what the PCs do, and how the NPCs react, and so on.

Hope this helps with your aasimar culture! First thing to ask: What philosophical or political ideas am I trying to explore or comment on with this aasimar culture?  
It feels nice, but there's a nasty underbelly. Is there propaganda? Are normal people pretending there's no underbelly? Or do they know and they're doing their best to help, but it's not working? Are the discontents in the underbelly justified or not? Are they in conflict with the ruling class because they want power, or because the rulers are actually not aligned with their interests? What resources does each side have? What lengths will they go to in order to have their way? How tense are things right now? Are their curfews? etc.

Don't need to answer most questions. Indeed, it helps to have open, unanswered questions in mind to discover what happens in play. You can even ask your players for answers, then incorporate them."

They seem versatile enough that they could be taken mostly as-is, but worded a bit differently for flavour? Maybe make the vows more hellish? (the '         ' is just a ""fill in the blank"" but I cannot be bothered to sort Reddit formatting)

**Infernal Orders**  
When you accept an order from your Arch Devil, state what task is set before you (you decide):

• Destroy '         ' , a blight standing between me and the goals of my faith.  
• Protect '         ' from the attackers that seek to interfere with them and me.  
• Discover the secret of '         ' and share it with my lord.   

Then choose up to two boons:  
• Senses that pierce lies.  
• See through invisibility, disguise, or concealment.    
• Invulnerability to '         ' (edged weapons, fire, enchantment, etc.)  
• A mark of infernal authority.  
• A voice that transcends language.  
• Freedom from hunger, thirst, and sleep.  

The GM will then tell you what constraint(s) your Arch Devil demands of you in return:  
• Contract Law (you are forbidden to lie)  
• Legal Loopholes (use trickery and cleverness)  
• Economical (no superfluous spending or extravagances)  
• Merciless (allow no creatures that obstruct your orders to live)  
• Insurance Policy (regularly sacrifice things of value)  

That's my basic attempt. Thoughts?

Looks like you could also create a move to reflect Baleful Interdict since putting ""seals"" on creatures is a big part of the Illrigger class. Thoughts on that? Perhaps this is where the more ""active"" boons you made for The Chain could be applied?  
Maybe base it on the cleric's Commune:

**Baleful Interdict**

>When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet contemplation with your Arch Devil, you:  
>• Lose any seals already granted to you  
>• Are granted a number of new seals equal to your CHA  
>Seals can be spent, one for one, to induce the following effects on other creatures:  
>• deal 1d8 damage and heal you 1d4 damage  
>• cause the creature to attack its nearest ally  
>• make the creature vulnerable or immune to fire  
>• cause the creature to disclose it's deepest desire  
>• cause the creature's perceptions to fail or be tricked  
>• ???

Seals could be pretty powerful, but they only get a few per day so it's not a huge deal. Maybe it's not a starting move, but a move they can take."
DungeonWorld,fczrlo4,t3_ejohuf,1578107430.0,"I'm not an expert, neither on the Illrigger nor on DW Paladins. I've watched all of The Chain of Acheron, but have not read any extra stuff about the class details. Paladins are my fav class, but I've never played one in DW (I'm a GM).

Love the Human racial trait.

My main thought is that I don't really get The Chain. At first, it seems like a restriction, and a lot of restrictions at that. But then, if you break them, you get ""corruption"", which appears to be a strictly beneficial thing. This means the Illrigger would be braking forbiddences all the time... so they're not really very ""forbidden"" are they? They're incentivised. It's also not clear what it means for a party member to ""remove a forbiddence"".  
I personally think it might be better if it cut a lot closer to the original Quest move. This would be a chance to re-flavour all the Quest missions, boons, and vows to fit what an Arch Devil might ask of someone. Quest is the most flavourful Paladin starting move so there's a lot of meat here you could turn evil (but still viable in a party).

Infernal Conduit is the anti- Lay On Hands. I'm not sure it's written clearly: is this a ""life steal"" ability? What does it mean to ""give someone 1d8 of your damage""? Does that mean you deal 1d8 damage to someone and you heal that amount? Transferring disease sounds cool, but how often are you really diseased? I'd say being able to apply a disease would be cool, but that is a 5th level Cleric spell, so that's pretty OP for a starting move. Maybe here is where you can apply a forbiddence instead? ""Inflict terrible hunger, thirst, or drowsiness on a single being"" seems pretty good and not quite as strong as a full disease.  
I don't really get the difference with ""Bring Me To Life"".

Forked Tongue is straight up I Am The Law. Maybe a bit more flavour? Maybe instead of ""back away cautiously, then flee"" it could be ""cower helplessly in fear"". Perhaps instead of simple ""Attack you"" it's ""Attack you recklessly"" or something like that. (When I've listened to actual plays with DW Paladins, ""Attack you"" is so often the option GMs pick, but that usually makes the move being a success not feel very successful since the whole point is that the player is trying to avoid combat by telling the NPC what to do. Adding ""recklessly"" would narratively imply that the NPC is leaving themselves open to attack instead of just starting combat.)

I love Last Resort. That's 10/10 flavour.

I'd miss Bloody Aegis. I think it's pretty badass, but maybe it doesn't fit with Illrigger?

I think it would be cool to have a version of Divine Favour where you can get spells.

It's like a smart person reporting their accomplishments when confronted about their intelligence: it sounds like bragging because it is reporting favourable information, but it is intended as supporting evidence for the topic at hand, not personal egoism.

Some people feel inferior when they see someone accomplish more than themselves. They ascribe the source of this feeling not to themselves: they project it onto the other person.

Applying Hanlon's razor, if they're commenting, they probably see you as unhappy and they're probably trying to help in their ineffective way.  
If you're this reactive to them . . .  well, you don't come across as very happy. I'm not saying you need to be happy, but if you're not happy, you're going to have people trying to help you. These social people probably feel human empathy for you and seeing you unhappy makes them unhappy, like a contagion, so they try to fix it so they feel better. 

Do I face this? Not really. I exude contentment because I love my life. Nobody questions whether I'm happy so nobody questions my life choices. In fact, my bare enjoyment makes others question *their* life choices. It's funny to see them puzzle over something they took for granted because I'm so different and they can tell that I'm happier than they are. It confuses them. Rightly so, too: they'd be miserable in my life, but I happen to love it.

People I know generally overlook my solitary way of life as an unfathomable impossibility. They don't comment on me directly, but people often do mention generalities that imply social things.  
If someone says, ""Everyone wants a family"", I feel free to smile and say, ""Not everyone. I got a vasectomy when I was 22. I don't even want the responsibility of a pet because I prefer freedom. I mean, who wants to go to parent-teacher interviews, right? Or drive a kid to soccer games. Sounds awful! Na, I'd rather be free.""  
If they ask, ""Are you visiting home for Christmas?"", I smile a beaming smile and say, ""No way, I'm going to work from home. I love working on holidays because everyone else is busy so there are no interruptions."" Then they see how happy I am with my life choices, which is actually a contrast to theirs because most people don't actually enjoy visiting their families for holidays, and they get this quizzical look, as if they're thinking, ""I would feel bad if I had was working on Christmas, but he seems so happy... Would I feel bad? Who am I?"" It messes with their empathy because they really don't understand.

So, if you're happy, show it. Stand up for yourself. If someone says, ""snap out of it,"" just smile and say, ""Na, I'm happy. There's nothing I want to snap out of"".  
But chances are, if people are saying that to you... maybe you're not so happy. If you're not happy, find what you value, find what brings you fulfillment, and then you can get happier and more content. Once that happens, you'll have a ground to stand on to say, ""I don't want to change. I'm happy the way I am"" in a way that they will see.

Instead of planning everything in battle-maps like one might in D&D, you could think of each room in a dungeon as a ""node"" and write some descriptive stuff about that ""node"". Part of your prep would be knowing some of what is there and if entering/exiting/etc. a ""node"" triggers something. By prepping some ""nodes"", you are able to prep content that (probably) gets at least partially traversed before players encounter any later-stage ""nodes"", like your evil fire mage encounter. Players can plot any route they want and you have some idea of what is there without being locked in to anything.

Otherwise, when you are making GM Moves, you can make an effort to start slow and ratchet up the tension as things get closer to the climax. You'll be ""showing signs of an approaching threat"" and ""revealing an unwelcome truth"" in the beginning, but by later on, they know the threats have approached so ""use up their resources"" and ""deal damage"". They know about the unwelcome threats so ""use a monster/location move"" and ""separate them"" for extra drama. You can start making harder moves instead of soft moves. You'll develop a feel for it.

Play to find out what happens means that, in extreme cases, some PCs may die or they could one-shot your evil mage. There is nothing ""unsatisfying"" about these outcomes since there will be a lot of build-up from rolls. Moves tend to snowball so if the party is rolling hot, they could whoop your evil forces, and that's satisfying because the players know they're rolling hot. If you cock-block them, that sucks and makes the scene feel dragged out. Likewise, if they're rolling 6- all night then things are going to get harry; if you pull punches that also robs the scene of dramatic tension and slows things down.  
Your job is not ""make a strong climax"", your job is to follow your agenda, principles, and moves. Trust the game's mechanics to help the climax come about and resolve and don't worry so much about it being ""satisfying"". I think most scenarios would be satisfying as long as you don't break your principles or use GM Fiat in an attempt to force an outcome, which would turn any climax unsatisfying."
