Prozac is a better fit for me for whatever reason, but I know people who have been really successful with lexapro. Best of luck!"
college,fff212p,t1_ffekbso,1579873548.0,"Very fair. And if I’m being honest, I do this frequently as well. I am a procrastinator for sure, but one who works pretty poorly under pressure. So for me, coming up with strategies to minimize the amount of work i have to do when I finally have to do it (eg. having the easy parts of an assignment done even if the vast majority of the assignment is still left to do in a relatively small time frame) has been really helpful. But of course, everyone has what works for them! I really just realized I was underutilizing the time I spent on campus between classes, and when someone pointed that out to me, it helped me out a lot."

depression,fdd69bw,t3_ekqfrc,1578296632.0,"Hey, I am 19 and remember having very similar thoughts at 13, often in the middle of the night. Whether you call 911 is something only you can decide. But you should know that emergency services are not always the best resource for people feeling suicidal. 

That being said, if you don’t know if you can keep control through the night, calling the Suicide Prevention Lifeline could be helpful. They will connect you with a crisis worker and you can talk to them, they might know more about resources available in your area, and talking to them may be helpful. I will note. I am not very familiar with the process myself, or with what comes after it. 

Tomorrow I would recommend looking for mental health resources in your area, maybe a counselor at school for example. You could also think about calling the NAMI helpline tomorrow morning, and they might be able to connect you to resources that could help. If you happen to go to a primary care professional any time soon (your pediatrician or family doctor) they can help too... and you should be able to talk to them without your parents being present.

I don’t know your situation with your parents (I know mine at that age was rough, and I kept a lot from them about my own mental health) but you should know too that if you do tell them what’s going on (even if not all the details), you might have more access to resources that can help you. And at 13, your health is considered their business too... it can be a tough thing to navigate, but there may be adults in your community who can help. 

I want to commend you for looking for help when you feel like this... it’s a hard thing to do, but so important. As someone who has hit rock bottom a couple of times, I just want to say you aren’t alone. Please advocate for yourself. There is help out there, and recovery is real."
