GetMotivated,fcuzglc,t3_eiwdw4,1577991587.0,"This is legitimately stupid. I have read quite a few books (though, admittedly, more fiction than nonfiction) and am typically considered quite smart (source - currently a few years into my math PhD program), but that does not translate well into being good at conversation. I am a proficient writer. However, my conversational skills are sorely lacking, despite having the manners and compassion directly mentioned in the post.

I don't blame the world, or more specific subgroups of people, for my shortcomings (and I'm very aware of what those shortcomings are, as well), but that doesn't magically turn me into a scintillating conversationalist.

Thanks, but no thanks - this post is ridiculous.

Edit: Also, I'm in shape (not as much as I was in high school and college, but still fit) and, despite thinking that keeping up with the latest fashions is inane, at least dress neatly and keep myself well-presented. Guess what? It turns out that an inability to talk to people you don't know makes it incredibly hard to date, no matter how you dress or how much you know. Also, having hobbies that, despite modern female influxes, are still very much sausage-fests doesn't help anything, as the people I meet through common interests are almost always men (in particular, my most social activities are table-top gaming and whitewater kayaking - certainly, more women participate now than at any prior point, but those are both still heavily male-dominated activities).

Edit 2: Just for clarity (and after reading some of the earlier comments), I don't go around bragging about being smart or looking down on others. I only mentioned that I am smart because it is directly relevant to this post, which posits that smart people can all, necessarily, become good at dating. I am presenting myself as a counterexample, not attempting to get validation. Certainly, if I were to spent hundreds of hours on doing nothing but going on dates and receiving \*constructive feedback\* so that I could identify and learn from my mistakes, I could become good at it - but that's not going to happen. Mostly, because people don't give constructive feedback about bad dates, which means that I don't know where I went wrong, only that I suck at it.

The same general issue applies to online dating services - I don't talk much to even my closest friends via brief text messages. Random strangers, I'm not nearly as interested in (prior to getting to know them and becoming emotionally invested), and it shows, which quickly leads to a cessation of messaging."

Consequently, we may safely conclude that at least 90% of conservatives are against gay rights, hence, yes, being a conservative pretty safely means you're against gay rights.

Of course, you could be both gay and against equal rights, but... why? That's even stupider than when normal people are against equal rights and protections, since they, at least, aren't directly harmed by the lack of those things."

You lot can downvote me as much as you want, but it doesn't change the fact that everything I have said is true, and is backed up by actual science, unlike the people who claim that they have no control over being fat (which your total dismissal of my explicit statement - in the very comment that you replied to - that doctors should not be dismissive of obese patients leads me to believe is a group that you are a member of).

Admittedly, the sample does not, necessarily, generalize well (since it was restricted to medical students from a single school, although there was a decent number of them). This does not mean that it never happens; merely, it says that your anecdote is a rarity, rather than the norm that you claim it to be.

It's not even *difficult* to verify these claims (I just search some keywords on Google Scholar and find something from a trustworthy source, usually NIH, with a decent number of citations, then read it to find out the results, followed by a brief check to see if the paper was later retracted or similar).
