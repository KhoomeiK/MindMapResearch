relationships,ffemqxv,t1_ffem3ay,1579854831.0,Well it sounds like it's not exactly secret. And if he knew and knew that it would save a lot of fights why wouldn't he tell her? In private of course. But husbands and wives tell each other so many things if I were to disclose something to one I would kind of expect the other would know too.

That is insubordination and you are well within the right to do so as it leads other employees to think that they can either do the same or that they have to follow him so they dont get in trouble. You are in charge of that business financially and authoritatively. He cannot make a coup and misrepresent to your clients like that. It screws up the whole business. You were right to fire him

You both had the same upbringing. If you could move past it to build up others she probably could have too. That being said she doesnt bully anyone now, as far as we know. Which is a super good thing and shows she understands her past wrongs. Whether or not her apologies are able to be taken at face value I cant say.

But my overwhelming urge here is you are babysitting her for free and paying more to feed her than they are. They should be grateful.

I'd even go so far as to say you are justified in telling them you absolutely will not watch their child this weekend since you're ""a cruel snob"" and tell them exactly like that too.
