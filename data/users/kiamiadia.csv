AmItheAsshole,fezg6n3,t1_feye7od,1579456991.0,"Ok but OPs kids don't seem to have epilepsy. For people without a medical need, keto generally provides poor nutrition at best, and at worst, can aid in the development of disordered eating. It's not a miracle diet, it's just food restriction."

todayilearned,feo5pik,t1_feo2nfe,1579295440.0,Obviously everyone would be informed. I'm not sure you understand how other countries run this. No one is being scammed or misled.
todayilearned,fen6bdt,t1_femnv0w,1579277930.0,....the point is not to opt in. We create a larger organ donor system by opting out. People who don't want to be part can always opt out. People who don't care one way or another stay on.
todayilearned,felt9as,t1_felitb2,1579230374.0,Honestly it's a characterization of humans. It's not country or really even culture specific. We're inclined to take the easier route and save mental capacity for more meaningful tasks.
todayilearned,fela2ra,t1_fel93yk,1579217366.0,"The decision is the barrier though. I understand the point, but it is psychologically more work to change something. Having to respond ""yes"" to any sort of change is more work than saying ""no"". If the US did opt-out, we would have a much larger population that never chooses to opt-out because if the mental effort that it involves."
todayilearned,fel8pee,t1_fel5ov8,1579216486.0,"Yes, that is what they're saying. It's an opt-in program. The option is to join the program. In some other countries they have an opt-out program, where you are automatically part of the organ donation system unless you choose to remove yourself."

AskReddit,fdpad44,t1_fdp9j85,1578623718.0,"Which candidates (of R and D) are interested in prison reform? Real, defined, planned prison reform? I agree that people don't need special treatment. Is there another issue outside of the general expense? We pay for thousands of inmates to receive medication and pay for things like cancer treatment and heart surgery. Why is this different?"
AskReddit,fdpa7t0,t1_fdp9n8k,1578623618.0,"Well obviously people should try to not go to jail but that's not this specific issue and there are so many factors that influence crime rates. I guess prison reform is kind of an answer, but its not something that any republican has talked about in any kind of depth so....

 I agree that people won't change their decision based on that. But we're in the primaries right now, so they're trying to win democratic voters."
AskReddit,fdp98r4,t1_fdp6qch,1578622975.0,"Trans people in prisons experience more violence than the general population. If they get gender reassignment surgery they are able to be housed with their gender. If you are against this, how else do you propose that we would change the violence that is perpetrated against this specific group? I'm not being sarcastic, I'm truly interested."

xxfitness,fdk96yj,t1_fdk821i,1578498924.0,"I also used MFP in the worst parts of my disordered eating. I think it's great that you can identify that this wouldn't be good for you to do. I personally follow intuitive eating now. It focuses on being mindful about your food. Some people following this can be just as extreme as super strict food tracking, which I've found doesn't work for me. If you're on instagram, I really recommend emiliathompsonphd, soheefit, and drnadolsky. Emilia promotes intuitive eating for all goals, including weight loss and gain. The other two follow more of a macros approach but primarily encourage a good relationship with food.


Overall, it has been super super helpful for me to not look at my body in the mirror every day, not weigh myself more than once a week (if that!), and eating foods that make me feel good and also taste good. This mostly ends up being fruits and vegetables, meat, rice, and eggs. I never restrict cravings, but also don't force myself to eat something just because it's in front of me. 

Sorry this got so long winded, but I hope it is helpful!! Intuitive eating has really improved my physical and mental health!"
TwoXChromosomes,fdhbdg3,t1_fdh63p5,1578419341.0,Or two people could just have different life experiences? I'm not trying to tell anyone that they didn't experience harrassment. If you read through other comments you'll notice that I'm far from the only one who is having a hard time believing OPs story.
TwoXChromosomes,fdhb8ap,t1_fdh7i15,1578419267.0,"I don't want it to sound like I'm downplaying harassment, because I'm absolutely not. It is unacceptable and I agree, is incredibly uncomfortable no matter the situation. However I see some glaring differences between your level of harassment and the extremely assertive and aggressive ones OP is reporting. The harassment that I have experienced is much more on par with yours.

A brand new account that was made to only post this and create and very specific (and kind of fetish-ive?) narrative just doesn't hold a lot of validity in my eyes. Personal opinion I guess."
TwoXChromosomes,fdh1vol,t1_fdgy2ko,1578413579.0,"I'm a pretty attractive woman in my 20s and anything even close to what OP is describing has happened to me maybe 5 times. I live in a midsized city too, so I have plenty of possible interactions. OPs story reads like fiction, sorry that's so upsetting to you."
