PlayTemtem,ff9tljd,t1_ff9bx84,1579720983.0,I noticed that lowering settings lowers the triangle count in a really lazy way.
PlayTemtem,ff9tend,t1_ff99pvh,1579720862.0,Yeah I have a super old laptop below minimum spec that runs the game at almost 60 fps on low settings.
PlayTemtem,ff9gd6s,t3_es9ygm,1579712432.0,This is why I go to the steam discussions. Lots of funny trolls.
PlayTemtem,ff9g100,t1_ff8hbzl,1579712227.0,Sometimes I feel that way with some games. Temtem is not one though. Most of the games in question have you download the oldest working version of a launcher that then downloads the latest patch really slowly. ESO is a prime example of this. The launcher takes the better part of a day to install and the patch the launcher has to install is like 30gb and it downloads it at like 2kB/s by the time you finish that steam thinks you have been playing for more than 2 hours and thus will not allow a refund.
ABoringDystopia,ff9f3qw,t1_ff8m6fi,1579711660.0,Unfortunately I dont go to news websites because they all tell me to disable my ad block which I only use because ads are the reason I had to reinstall windows like 4 times on one of my PCs because even Google refuses to check ads for malware.

PlayTemtem,ff77l3c,t3_es04e8,1579642688.0,"its expected honestly. happens a little with traditional mmos but most people playing those are no stranger to launch day server problems.  


i have a feeling that most Temtem players dont play many MMOs and especially not on launch day so the concept of day 1 server issues is completely foreign to them so they just assume that the game is broken. i have played on launch day on a number of MMOs and they all have issues. smaller ones without much fanfair will be playable after a day or 2 while highly anticipated launches will have day long queues and nearly non-functional servers for weeks after launch."

techsupportmacgyver,fezom87,t1_fezm52v,1579459726.0,back when i did something similar this was not the case because the time i would have spent scrounging around for a flash drive or SD card big enough for the media creation tool would have been much longer and would not have born fruit. ended up buying an SD card for this purpose after the fact... that was then swiped off my desk and eaten by a toddler... and this is why i cant have nice things...

&#x200B;

saw in another comment that you dont know if its a good team to battle with. i have used many of these pokemon in one team or another with the exception of Dragapult (because i dont plan on getting S&S):

Lycanroc: i have not used one personally however it looks like it could be a great mid to late battle sweeper. something to clean up after a main suicide sweeper has done its carnage

&#x200B;

Glaceon: as stated is in my opinion inferior to Vaporion however what it lacks in HP it makes up for in a small boost to Special Attack and a large bump to physical defense. makes an okay tank but HP is still more important imo.

&#x200B;

Blaziken: hits hard and fast- and is K.O.ed quickly. not a bad thing- valid strategy actually was one of my first sweepers of this type and one of the more effective  


Gallade: fast physical attacker with an enteresting type and some natrual special defensive bulk. i personally never liked using a gallade but they arent bad

&#x200B;

Milotic: big beautiful stall wall. the master of rest talk toxic/scald cheese.

&#x200B;

Dragapult: again i have never used this guy but i can see it being a good stall breaker. its fast, has high attack, and it has infiltrator. im a bit rusty but this thing may be the strongest pokemon with that ability. i could see a build with U-turn, Sucker punch, Will-o-Wisp, and Hex being effective, though again i have not tested this.

&#x200B;

all in all you have: a stall wall, physical a wall breaker, physical suicide sweeper, physical late game sweeper, bulky special attacker, and a swift physical attacker. this is a very offense heavy team with some bulk. not much  in the way of a hazard layer though i suppose you could re-purpose lycanroc to do that."
aww,fd0ux0w,t1_fczc0gg,1578124091.0,"videos of them running around fast all over the place (known by some as ""zoomies"") is usually done because they cant get all of their pent up energy up. its actually a cry for help. they require lots of walks, and mental stimulation."
