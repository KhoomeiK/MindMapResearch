the Winning side is split between 4 main Lords. The Haytals, who were the defacto successors after the war, but tried to move the capitol from the Silver Keep to their own city, which backfired because everything still depended on the infrastructure of the Silver Keep.

The pavelos who were the richest of the Rebels but lost their standing spending money on expensive hostages 

 The Kidarite family who were more interested in expanding their land holdings in the North than ruling the whole kingdom 


The Farhangi.

The few commoners who do save up enough to buy silver coins can travel and be merchants Common born merchants will show off their wealth by becoming fat, a merchant having a fat wife is practically stereotype of its own.



There is also a big racial divide between regions. Northerners are shorter and have thick accents, southerners are taller, thinner and can't grow beards. Farmers are darker, miners are pale and stout. People from the coast have copper coloured skin and almond shaped eyes. Even if your grandparent came from the coast or was descended from the sea traders, if you have the slightest hint of the features people will say you smell like the sea. Even among Nobles, there are racial differences and groups dont like each other
