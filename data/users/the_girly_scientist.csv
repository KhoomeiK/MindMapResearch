I think the odds of them giving you the answers your looking for are really really slim. I would just do your best, because that’s all you can do. A lot of programs are program specific and really random. People get rejected from lower tier and get into higher tier schools all the time. I’d just say their loss and focus on the rest of the apps."
gradadmissions,fdf7xp0,t3_el26qj,1578355384.0,Although he wanted you maybe he just didn’t have pull in admissions. Are you planning on reapplying to the program?
gradadmissions,fdf7qjb,t1_fdf7bax,1578355253.0,"I did, I have one acceptance and 3 other interviews. I really shouldn’t be upset, but it was my dream so ofc I am."
gradadmissions,fddmfrz,t1_fdc5f7f,1578317725.0,"No questions are stupid. Yeah, you might want to study his more than others if he’s the one you want to work under the most. I wore a button up, slacks, and a blazer. But some people think that’s overdressed. I’d rather be over than under though. 

A lot of women wear dresses, or skirts. That’s just not my style preference."
college,fcxvh6y,t1_fcxuelb,1578071083.0,"What if not getting into that major ends up being the best thing ever? I mean, it’s gotta be really close to 50-50 shot right? Because both paths lead to an unknown. You pick up what I’m saying? Regardless of what you choose a lot of undergrad is what you make of it. 

I ended up majoring in chemistry, I graduated early from hs and never even took a chemistry class. And even in college it was far from my strong suit. I had to take chemistry freshman year and took a C because I told myself well, I’ll never have to take another chemistry class again. I took calculus and failed it. Took it again and got a C. Everyone told me to switch out of my engineering major, because it wasn’t my strong suit. I ended up getting As in Calc 2 and 3. Now I’m interviewing for PhD programs that really value my chemistry major, it sets me apart from others, and I’m looked at being very math and physics strong. 

Regardless, all I’m trying to say is that you can create your path, and you can set up life to be exactly how you want it more often than not it won’t unfold like that. Maybe this other major is going to be better for you, or maybe you transfer and do the accounting thing at your school or somewhere else. The first year at least you’re in Gen Ed’s anyway, so you have time to figure it out. I say give it a chance, you’re at your dream school with finances sorted out. You’re set up beautifully to succeed."
college,fcxu22q,t3_ejeuio,1578070486.0,"Maybe a weird concept but how do you KNOW you’re not keen on the major you got into. You haven’t taken a class yet, as much as you think you know, what a lot of other people said is true. Often people change majors or switch around. And I know majors are different at your school. But you got into an amazing school of your dreams with awesome financial aid? But MIGHT dislike the major? Seems worth it to me."

college,fcvi6px,t3_ej1l00,1578002610.0,"Always try to remember it’s just a bad semester. Not a bad life. Try to see the biggest places you messed up last semester and do your best to not repeat those mistakes. Go to office hours and tutoring. Make plans so other people will hold you accountable. Sometimes if I couldn’t get out of bed for me, I could do it for the person I made plans to study/ meet with. Maybe that will help you too. Hang in there, you can and will crush this next semester."
gradadmissions,fcu2ome,t3_eit88x,1577970665.0,"Ask for an itinerary if you haven’t gotten one yet. Go through each prof you will meet with and prepare at least 3 questions relevant to their current research. Sometimes you may not have a chance to ask them, but for the times you do, most are very impressed at the preparation and time you put in. (Source: I did this for a school I had TWELVE faculty interviews at. And got in.)"

gradadmissions,fc2hnpk,t1_fc2hnc8,1577360761.0,Ah makes sense. Okay
gradadmissions,fc2hiyh,t3_eettxn,1577360559.0,Did you apply CMB at Duke?
gradadmissions,fc2hi81,t1_fbzm720,1577360527.0,"If you know machine learning and you’re applying for a PhD in a field where everyone knows machine learning, why not just say, “I took xy and z courses and learned this, or mastered this, demonstrated my ability to be a self starter, to pursue my academic interests when they’re not readily available, etc”. I don’t think you need to explain what you know, your audience knows that. 

If you want to DM me your paper I can take a look?"
gradadmissions,fc2h8po,t3_efc37k,1577360116.0,Does it ask just general or does it ask biggest strengths/ weakness?
gradadmissions,fc2h5jk,t3_efhajt,1577359980.0,"I didn’t apply engineering but I did most of my undergrad in it (before transferring to a school that didn’t offer my major and finishing up in Chemistry). I had a LOT of Ws. And multiple Cs. My applications usually gave me space if I wanted to comment on poor grades and why it happened. But I graduated with a 3.53 I figured explaining it would only highlight it further and if anyone wanted to know what happened I would tell them. 

I suppose it worked because I’ve received interviews from 4/6 schools so far and no school has batted an eye or even asked about the Ws or Cs. I’d say you’re definitely fine, because like someone else said, engineers often have low GPAs because of the rigorous coursework. (But to me, a 3.6 isn’t low??)"
