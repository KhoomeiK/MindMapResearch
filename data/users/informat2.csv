>Before Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Cuba was one of the most advanced and successful countries in Latin America. Cuba's capital, Havana, was a ""glittering and dynamic city"". The country's economy in the early part of the century, fuelled by the sale of sugar to the United States, had grown wealthy.

Venezuela is doing terribly compared to other oil rich nations like Norway or Saudi Arabia. Venezuela socialist economic policies like mass nationalization and price controls ruined what could have been a wealthy country:
