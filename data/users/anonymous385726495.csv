Not sure why you would bother to tattoo your palms or soles of your feet. Maybe they are masochists or something. All those tattoos fade away immediately due to the location."

If you are chosen as a foreperson, I’m sure parenting would be great preparation."

AmItheAsshole,ffdl0bj,t1_ffdi6pg,1579823114.0,"Agreed and it sounds like in OPs situation, the bully needs to forgive herself, and that’s what she was after. She wanted OP to give her that to absolve her of guilt she clearly has. Fair enough to have guilt but you can’t expect forgiveness, simply ask for it and move on."
AmItheAsshole,ffdkrfe,t1_ffddczf,1579822960.0,"I agree, but I still have nightmares about kids that bullied me. Best to just stay away. If you’re a bully just make peace with your past on your own. everyone is different though. Maybe some folks would want the apology. I would have been trying to avoid the situation like OP."
introvert,ffajxns,t1_ff98gzy,1579737589.0,This. Even when I’ve done a 15 hour shift I can’t go to sleep right away. It’s painful when you are exhausted but your relaxation process requires it.

Wellthatsucks,ff4cfpq,t1_ff423is,1579560361.0,"So I want to second this because my first go at this (I was scared and didn’t ask for all 4 at once. Dentist asked me after I was dosed with anti anxiety meds if I wanted them all out. i said I didn’t want to make such a decision after receiving drugs.) I only got twilight. Shit didn’t work for someone with as much anxiety as I have (it took me forever to even relax initially) and I woke up half way through. I won’t speak of what I saw (the above link will cover it), but needless to say I panicked until they dosed me again. That was enough for me and next go, I did full anesthesia. I’ve never spent $600 so wisely. Be smart, get them all out at once with general anesthesia if you can."
Wellthatsucks,ff4c249,t3_eri8xl,1579560090.0,"General anesthesia is so worth it. And no straws for a while when you’re healing. Mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, pudding, and popsicles will be your friend. It’s also so worth it to buy the dumb ice packs that wrap around your head if you are getting surgery on more than one side. Hang in there OP!"

The person I was in love with since elementary school died suddenly right before I was about to see him again, after he’d been teaching abroad. I had finally gotten the nerve and confidence to tell him, and he was gone. Don’t wait to tell someone, even if it doesn’t lead to anything. It has hurt me a lot, and it didn’t help when I met with his parents and told them this story, and they said the same thing: that we could have been great together. Don’t be me, as I haven’t been able to care for anyone since."
