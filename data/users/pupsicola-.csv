looking forward to the next update, thank you for your work. 🙂"

YangForPresidentHQ,fcfk24w,t3_egzw2j,1577630733.0,why bother with a candidate that we all know deep down doesn't have a chance at the nomination? maybe focus on someone viable? this is the kind of party dilution that got trump elected. democrats need to rally behind someone who has a real chance at the presidency.
jailbreak,fc3cwvu,t1_fc15y3g,1577387014.0,"I have one more small nitpicky suggestion: apple coded the circles around the flashlight and camera toggles on the lock screen to have a dark blur, even on light mode

Example pic: https://i.imgur.com/o6fvkNm.jpg

It'd be nice to have those circles in a light blur (same lightness as the music player above them) when dark mode is turned off so that they match the rest of the ui. (although maybe this would be better as it's own separate small tweak? idk)

Regardless, thank you again for your work! Love this tweak, definitely gonna be a mainstay on my device as long as checkra1n stays relevant."
