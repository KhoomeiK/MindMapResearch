SelfAwarewolves,fe97ptl,t3_eo1qcg,1578935090.0,pointing out forced diversity doesn't make you racist.
btd6,fe94pwe,t1_fe8gahp,1578934243.0,"no, this is right most of the time. chimps being a rare exception(from most perspectives). in game design, buffs are preferred over nerfs because rebalancing is the important thing, not decreasing the overall amount of power the player has; and players don't like having power taken away. 

ergo, buffs are better than nerfs.

as for chimps, people have gotten to a very high level of skill in the game, more than you'd see for pretty much any other TD game; it stands to reason that there'd be a lot of players able to trivialise chimps. as long as a certain tower isn't head and shoulders above the rest(looking at you, ninja) then it's just a matter of the game being inherently easy, rather than the towers being op.

funny how you could be this wrong about such a fundamental aspect of game design and still have the gall to stick your oar in."

yes, i'm continuing to insult you, because you're still saying stupid stuff.
i didn't say i wasn't insulting you, i said you insulted me 3 times first.
at this point i'm convinced you can't read very well.

you insulted me first, three times no less, so i really don't know what you're getting at. and what's more, you were coming from a place of blatant misunderstanding of plain english.
