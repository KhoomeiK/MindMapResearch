I do the head swivel at the range before reholstering. I notice where range officer is, any new shooters in adjacent lanes. 

I'll draw and  fire at my target somewhere between 1 and 3 times, hold out and scan the targets to my left and right, pull back to low ready and do the hard check before reholstering."
funny,fct8ozg,t1_fcskd9i,1577935845.0,"Not entirely. It's a sort of low ready when you keep the gun close to your body, pointed down. There's no real crouching, but some bending of knees and leaning forward to help stability and control of recoil. 

It does a few things: keeps the gun pointed in a safe direction, and maintains strong positive control of the firearm, and he's also able to punch out and fire again if necessary. Nothing to do with being a small target.

He looks around sort of exaggerated to train himself to maintain full situational awareness. He is scanning for additional threats. 

The two stances (and  you refer to are the Weaver and isosceles stances. Very little to do with moving vs stationary, just two different ways of shooting. In theory, isosceles offers a protective advantage for people wearing body armor, while presenting a slightly larger target, but that's rarely the main reason one uses to pick a stance. What let's you shoot best, and fastest, is better criteria, and everyone is different.

2. So literally the thing that proves you wrong happens, and you claim 'no, that doesn't count. He was too good of a good guy.'

You didn't address the question.

The cat is out of the bag vis a vis bad guys having guns. How do you propose handling a situation, at that moment, where a bad guy shows up intent on using the gun?


There is a bad guy who walks into your house right now. You're in an apartment, there's no other way out. You heard him shoot someone just next door, and he just kicked in your door. Your family is scattered around the apartment doing their own thing. 

Don't talk policy. Don't talk about how they shouldn't have them, and that's your solution.  Don't say ""that's unlikely to happen"" because we know it happens, because it happens *every day* somewhere in the world.  Those are all very good, important conversations, but does not address the imminent scenario. 



>Usually the 'good guy' is panicking and is more of a danger to themselves and others by not being a great aim, not knowing the exact source of shots and potentially targeting the wrong person, putting themselves in danger by trying to get to the shooter etc.

>The 'good guy' is rarely a good thing

I think there was a highly publicized fuck up by trained  cops in Florida a few weeks ago. Can you please cite to me instances where what you say will happen, happens?

Why? Explosions happen in there way more violently than a slide release or racking the thing. Slide release or racking it should not be a factor, and can uncover defects like weak springs or out of spec issues. 

100% on all the other points though. 

Story time:

I was once trying to get a p365. Basically had cash in hand. Checking it out before buying, I dropped the mag, cleared it, and released the slide, it didn't go into battery by about a millimeter or two. So I racked it normally and it still wouldn't go into battery. I had to push it with my thumb. I pointed it out to sales guy by making a corny joke about it needing a forward-assist. ( read: I'm not a newbie to firearms) 

Sales droid accused me of breaking it because I racked it too hard, said I'd be responsible for armorer time to diagnose and repair the thing.

 Sorry, I'm not superhuman. I'm not strong enough to break a modern pistol by racking it once. Argument ensued when he tried to get a copy of my ID. Sorry, you get nothing but my phone number, and you're lucky about that. 

He then said, ""well, if you are looking for a striker fired pistol, I can show you the gen 5 glocks. "" as if he could still get my business. 

I walked out. 

Fast forward a few hours, he calls me and sheepishly says ""hey, turns out the frame was slightly out of spec. You won't be charged."" damn right I won't, I didn't give you anything but a phone number, agreed to nothing. He never apologized. 

Goddamn I still get pissed about that.

Edit. This was at a gun store / range in Nova that people here are probably pretty familiar with."
