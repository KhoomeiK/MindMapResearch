I only use the small doses as a paramedic. I'm sure docs have other uses and doses. You probably had another pain reliever, or topical anesthetic on board as well during your procedure. Where they needed/wanted you to stay awake, probably wasn't a lot of other meds though."

It's a benzodiazepine, so it works on anxiety, but it also has an amnesiac property. Other common benzos like ativan(lorazepam) or valium(diazepam) do NOT have that property. Versed(midazolam) is a very common medication used for sedation of children, so that they don't remember being scared or hurt at the doctor/dentist. It can be administered through an IV, but also orally or sprayed into the nostrils(intranasal). Intranasal administration works quickly, but is also non invasive, so the child never feels any pain."

The general firearm season for deer always starts on a Wednesday. This was back in the 80s. I also never heard any of these great nicknames for opening day."
