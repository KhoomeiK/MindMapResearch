Offering a public option wouldn't steepen the divide between the rich and the poor, unless the plan was completely terrible. We can observe medicare as it exist right now. Sure many wealthy people have a healthcare plan on top on medicare, but I don't think many would argue that this has greatly deepen the divide between rich and poor,
