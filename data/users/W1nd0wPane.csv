And why is it his business what size dick her other partner has? Totally inappropriate to ask."
relationship_advice,fdntqxp,t1_fdmo66v,1578592658.0,"I don’t think she handled it badly. She enforced boundaries by refusing to answer his questions but he kept pressing and eventually presented the loaded question about it being about his size when she did nothing to indicate that was ever a problem for her. So for him to ask that was frankly annoying (like I’m annoyed for her!) and I would have done the same thing. “If you’re going to keep asking and you really want an answer to an unfair question when you already know the answer because you have to know that statistically you’re well below average size... then I’m going to tell you just so that you’ll get off my back about it”. It’s not like they’re in a committed romantic relationship either... that doesn’t mean you can be shitty to your FWB but it’s a much lower emotional maintenance type of relationship. If he can’t handle jealousy then he needs to not be in a poly type situation. 

I think he caught feels and is insecure about his size to begin with and would probably rather be in a monogamous relationship but probably faces a lot of rejection due to his size and is taking what he can get. That said there’s much more to a relationship and to a person than dick size but he seems overly focused on that being his biggest flaw when in reality his immaturity and jealousy is a much bigger problem. 

IMO he’s 100% in the wrong."

fatlogic,fdnjlti,t1_fdmm7tc,1578587174.0,"Cancer is weird because there are many more diverse risk factors for it than for diabetes or heart disease. T2 diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease are almost always metabolically related and often occur together in advanced stages. There are dozens of different types of cancer and a lot of them don’t have anything to do with weight. But research is showing that with certain cancers, especially breast cancer, lifestyle choices like weight and alcohol habits factor in a lot. 

There are also a lot of people with T1 diabetes who are like “I’m diabetic and thin!”. When T1 is an autoimmune disorder and is not weight or lifestyle related. They’ll also cite their “thin uncle” who probably had a BMI of like 26 and probably carried his weight well and probably ate too much sugar who died of T2 diabetes. Everyone who is a statistical outlier thinks they’re the exception to the rule, when the science is clear that ~90% of people who are T2 diabetic have an overweight or obese BMI. 

Yes, that DOES mean not all obese people are diabetic or even necessarily will be. Yes, that DOES mean 10% of T2 diabetics are not overweight. None of that negates the science that obesity is the #1 risk factor for diabetes and it’s just people manipulating statistics to fit their nefarious narratives. 

I’m not a doctor nor a scientist but people who are that scientifically illiterate scare me."

fatlogic,fdhqep2,t3_elb410,1578428119.0,"I actually hate that Keto/low carb is super popular and mainstream and gimmicky now because it’s idiots like this that give it such a bad rap. 

900 calories a day is not enough for an adult human, ever. 

You do not need much of a calorie deficit to achieve weight loss, especially on Keto, and especially if your body is used to consuming hundreds of excess calories of sugar every day. Sometimes just getting someone under 2,000 calories a day is enough because it’s a deficit from the 3-4k their body is used to eating. 

I didn’t count calories at all when I did Keto, just carbs. I naturally ate much smaller portions because the fat content was so satiating. I don’t do keto anymore, but i do still keep a reasonable carb/fat ratio, and I’ve been able to train my body/brain to be disgusted by sugar and to like smaller portions. Diets don’t work unless they change your long term relationship with food for the better. 

It’s amazing how people will a.) do a diet wildly incorrectly, and b.) go back to the way they were eating before after achieving weight loss, and then are genuinely shocked when they gain all the weight back. Humans are bafflingly stupid."

All that aside, I really hate how fat activists have co-opted feminism.

I have so many questions..."
RBNLifeSkills,fckqsy9,t3_ehozb3,1577731189.0,"So... I think that you should think about a few things.

Do you absolutely need to go to grad school right now? And will your future graduate degree help you get a better job? Are you able to get a full-time job with benefits with just your bachelors degree, especially if you move to a downtown area? If you don’t absolutely need grad school right now, I’d wait, or even see if you actually need it. In my experience, whatever salary bump I would get from a master’s degree would be negated by the student loans I’d have to take out. Saying no to unnecessary debt is never, ever, ever a bad thing. And the more debt you take on, the harder it will be to be financially independent once you graduate. And... there are a lot of terrible reasons to go to grad school. If you can get an assistantship and if they pay your tuition at close to 100%, then that’s a different story, but IMO grad school is almost always too expensive to be worth it, unless it’s law school or medical school and therefore mandatory for that career. And it sounds like you’re relatively young - you have all the time in the world to pursue grad school. 

You do not need a cosigner for an apartment if you make enough income to qualify for it. That can include roommate’s income if applicable. Typically you want to make 3x the monthly cost of the apt in pre-tax income. 

IMO the first thing you need to do is get the job. Preferably full time. That will make everything else possible. Since you have a car now, work there before moving out and drive to and from. That will give you time to do apartment shopping or look for roommates or whatever. 

The car deal does sound like a leash. You have no way of knowing how long it will take to pay it off, or whether they’ll try to keep their name on the title once they “give” it to you. Typical narc parenting move is to maintain co-ownership on the title so that legally it’s still theirs and they can still fuck with you. The car is only yours if it’s only your name on the title. Tbh, if you can find an apartment and job on public transit lines, that would be ideal, because even a paid-off car is expensive when you factor in insurance, gas and repairs. You can get a decent bike for like $150 and use that + bus + subway or whatever is available in your target city. 

Once you’re established in your job and apartment you need to cut whatever financial and legal ties you have with your parents. That involves putting all your bank accounts, credit cards, etc under your name only. I have seen too many posts on r/raisedbynarcissists about narc parents committing financial fraud on their kids as a means of control."

childfree,fcalwdg,t1_fcakqpi,1577571836.0,Yeah pretty much
childfree,fcadn88,t1_fcad6cj,1577567449.0,Same and I’ve totally been to both that Castle and the Castles and Coasters lol. Small fuckin world.
raisedbynarcissists,fc9x3ep,t1_fc7jyhd,1577559486.0,"Well, about a year after the events described above, (I was 21) I stayed at my (at the time) girlfriend’s place for too many days, wasn’t coming home at all really, and she left me a note on my bed on Christmas Eve that I was kicked out and I should go live with my alcoholic Dad (I moved in with her precisely to get away from my Dad because he wouldn’t even buy me food or anything). He also lived in another state. I was like “fuck this”, packed up a bunch of clothes and all the cash I had (probably like $200), got in my car and went to my GF’s house. I lived there for like two months (her parents were super understanding thank god). I got two jobs: waiting tables and working at one of the offices at my college. I then went to my mom and told her I was permanently moving out. I wasn’t like all “fuck you” about it, just calm and collected. I asked her if I could buy my car from her for $500. Surprisingly she said yes. Signed the title over to me. 

My friend’s grandfather owned a second house and let him and some friends live there. My friend had a room available and said he would rent it to me for $300 a month. I accepted, got most of my stuff and bailed. Have been living on my own ever since. 

Edit: spelling is hard."

LifeAfterNarcissism,fc75fzl,t1_fb9ydip,1577498032.0,"I’m so sorry to hear about all you’ve gone through. I know the feeling of like “why didn’t anyone save me from the abuse & neglect?” Especially my teachers in high school who knew I was a troubled kid but didn’t really dig deeper, especially because my Mom would put on a good, responsible face for them. 

It’s hard to know how to cope when the people who were supposed to love and care about and protect you were the ones hurting you. My situation was less severe than yours, but I still know that abandonment and loneliness.

Hopefully when you are on your own you’re able to find some therapy. If you go to college, most of them have free counseling services for students. Therapy has really helped me unpack all the baggage and trauma my parents left me with. 

I can’t imagine feeling so stuck because of your siblings. I don’t have any siblings myself so I can’t imagine how much harder that is. On the one hand, it’s not your responsibility to parent your siblings, and on the other, you know your actual parents are not going to parent them, and you probably feel like you want to protect them. There’s no good answer to this. I do think you owe it to yourself to progress in your own life with education and work, but you can honor how you feel about your siblings and their situation. If they’re close to adulthood, maybe you can help them get out too with all the independent living skills that you’ll soon learn. And if you can’t help them, you can’t blame yourself, because it’s not your fault to begin with. 

Best wishes on your journey. Remember that it’s okay to put yourself and your sanity and your safety first. They’ll try to make you feel guilty about it, but they’re wrong. Take care of yourself, friend. 💜"
ladiesinsuits,fc745ou,t3_egfuri,1577497049.0,Ugh I want this outfit.
raisedbynarcissists,fc71sai,t1_fc70lmo,1577495252.0,Ah I moved out at 21 (after she kicked me out and I’d had it with the BS) and she passed away 2 years ago. Her being gone is honestly liberating. I hope you find your way out too 💜
raisedbynarcissists,fc70fnl,t1_fc6re0p,1577494219.0,"That’s awful, I’m sorry. That’s so illegal, too. Your personal ID belongs to you!"
raisedbynarcissists,fc70cs7,t1_fc6tq7j,1577494159.0,"It’s crazy. My mom would call my office when I was also 28 if I didn’t call her back. I got in trouble with my boss once because I had the blinking voicemail light on my desk phone and I knew all the voicemails were my mom whining and I didn’t feel like taking time out of my workday to listen to and delete them. She lived 30 miles away, otherwise I think she might have shown up, too. 

The lack of boundaries with these people is astounding."
raisedbynarcissists,fc7008b,t1_fc6z1ph,1577493896.0,Oh man. A curfew is ridiculous. I totally get the feeling embarrassed by the psycho mom thing. I did a LOOOOOT  of explaining to my friends why I couldn’t hang out with them sometimes.
raisedbynarcissists,fc6z3ls,t1_fc6xwe5,1577493227.0,"Gah. It’s ridiculous right? She also yelled at me because I stayed at my friend’s house for a weekend once and didn’t answer her constant phone calls. She’d always claim it was that she was checking to make sure I wasn’t dead or in a car accident or kidnapped or whatever and it was really that I was out having a life and she didn’t like it, and I didn’t want to have to constantly tell her my whereabouts. She didn’t trust me."
raisedbynarcissists,fc6u1h2,t3_egcm55,1577489488.0,"Ugh god yes. I always wonder why my boyfriend sticks around, why he loves me, maybe the sex is good but otherwise he’d leave. Intrusive thoughts like this suuuuck."
raisedbynarcissists,fc6tth2,t3_egghjh,1577489324.0,Same. And a lot of literature out there about grieving one’s mother after her death is like “you’re not just grieving your mom you’re grieving your best friend” and I feel kind of alone like “actually I hated the c*nt and her death was one of the most liberating feelings I’ve ever had” but apparently it’s pretty taboo to say shit like that. :/
raisedbynarcissists,fc6rfyk,t1_fc6qa8v,1577487584.0,"Lmao I moved out when I was 21 because I was tired of my mom’s overall mental illness and abuse, and I’m now 32 and Mom is dead and I’m describing an event 12 years in the past but, go on being a sad troll I guess."
raisedbynarcissists,fc6q2fd,t1_fc6patu,1577486611.0,Lol fuck off
childfree,fc6q014,t3_egazpy,1577486564.0,"The baby pictures are annoying, but so are the parents who post frequently with “is anyone available to watch [kid]?” No."
childfree,fc6pm2z,t1_fc5l8dz,1577486288.0,"A few months ago I did an unfollow sweep of all the braindead mombies on FB and my social media life has vastly improved. 

I still get a few baby pics because there are some moms I’m friends with who also still post relevant /interesting content. Those moms who retain their personalities also tend to just post less about their kids. Those are the ones I’m cool with."
childfree,fc6pdya,t1_fc6p5cy,1577486127.0,"Yes you can unfollow someone without unfriending them. Then, their posts don’t show up in your feed, but if you physically go to their profile you can still see what they’ve posted."
