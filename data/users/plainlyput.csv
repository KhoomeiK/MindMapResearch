politics,ff6dv1x,t1_ff6aewa,1579625051.0,"I live I the SF Bay Area. Have most of my life. I think that if something is not done about some of our major issues; property crime going unchecked due to prop 47, homelessness, housing, transportation/traffic, PG&E/blackouts, there very well could be a turn, especially after Newsom. I am not saying the GOP could do better, but people are getting ready to vote a change. I do think that the trump factor could be the one thing preventing this."

bayarea,fef9hn5,t1_feene4w,1579051345.0,"The property owners may have already been there when all this started, and it could be said it is the 3 tiers above them are actively seeking the $$, while the property owners just happen to be passive recipients of it. Why do they have to surrender so the 3 tiers above them can make more $$$?"

sanleandro,fdwmbld,t3_emo770,1578760174.0,"You're probably as close, if not closer to Downtown Hayward as Downtown SL.  Castro Valley which is a bit more ""upscale"" is just over the ridge, & has some interesting downtown development going on. And if you like the outdoors, Lake Chabot is close. SL has a Marina, that is set do undergo a major redevelopment, so could be a mess in the future, but don't think it will affect any of the shoreline trails.  Bayfair has a great year round Farmers Market. There's a 24Hr fitness at Bayfair, thought it's closed for a few mo for renovations, but another not too far away as well. I'm on Next Door and don't see people from Ashland posting any more than other parts nearby. Of course there are nicer areas, but you would pay more for them."

aww,fdb9pyy,t1_fdaabf8,1578255223.0,"I foster for a city shelter, not a great area. That said, we send most of the kittens out to some great Rescue's in neighboring areas that are far more affluent. It's kind of a joke that people don't come to us because they think our animals aren't any good, because of where we're located. Little do they know they may be getting our kitties elsewhere. We also do a lot of of site events that I will attend. And even at the shelter we have a pretty tough screening process."
aww,fda80hn,t1_fda6be6,1578242773.0,"Kittens are pretty special. Non stop entertainment & guaranteed pure love. But I agree, I would rather have an older cat full time. That's why I foster kittens, yes, you fall in love with them & it's not easy to say good bye. But when you do, you know they're going to a good home, & you get a break from the constant cleanup & commotion for as long as you want."

Each time an incident such as above is reported, I imagine it weighs on someone who might have turned a blind eye prior, especially as it becomes closer to affecting them."

aww,fc320b1,t1_fc2gygx,1577379622.0,"I've taken her to the vet, numerous times & the only thing wrong with her is her kidneys, but her numbers have stayed steady. She's a good example of a cat having 9 lives. A few years ago, she'd had a tooth extraction & a bit after it (not sure it was related), she stopped eating, was throwing up etc. Vet's found nothing wrong. I had actually scheduled an in home vet for her to be euthanized, & had a large hole dug in my yard. I guess she decided nope, and made the most otherworldly yowl & threw up what looked like day glow yellow pudding. She then made her way back to health in a few days. 

Recently she was lost for 3 days,  which alone was crazy because she barely leaves the porch. She came back severely dehydrated such that she climbed in the dishwasher for water, & very thin. Vet checked her & she was fine. So, you're correct, it's not always the end!"

Later while walking back to BART, I witnessed a small scene with a cop apprehending her, she'd bit a store employee while trying to flee with stolen goods. She was putting up a good fight & there was a good crowd of people with their phones out filming. My guess is they were concerned for her being ""abused"". And that is why nobody trys to stop this shit. Do you want to be bit by a crazy person? Or worse?"

migraine,fbzcchj,t3_ef8hvt,1577241993.0,"It's my 3rd mo with it. I had 3 yrs of daily tension headaches with some breakthrough migraines. I suppose I was resistant to the idea of taking an antidepressant, & didn't really give it, or a few others prescribed me a chance. I finally got to the point where I was willing to try anything. It's been great. I started at 10mg but 20mg seems to be the magic number for me. It took a bit for me to adjust, waking up groggy, & sometimes feeling a bit ""spaced out"" but that's much better. It was crazy to realize that was all it took to get rid of that constant pressure in my head. I still am sensitive to bright lights, & fluorescent lighting affects me, though not necessarily triggering a headache. In the 3 months I think I've had about 3 migraines, but otherwise a pain free head! I think the change of mood I experienced was due to lack of headaches. From what I've read it is prescribed at a much higher dose for use as an anti-depressive."

I will always remember it as one of my favorite places to work. I had an amazing position, the owners were gracious people who treated us fairly.  I was witness to numerous acts of charity, along with lavish fundraisers for such. Additionally, the owners were both completely self made. The husband earned his money while at the same time using his skills  to bring justice in some very high profile cases."

And the reason they're paying that much is for the most part marketing. I have been given numerous bottle of very expensive wine as a gratuity and/or gift (related to my employment), realizing that to the person giving it to me, it really means nothing."
