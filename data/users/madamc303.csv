AskReddit,ffh2ggx,t1_ffg3ns8,1579921312.0,I’m a female working in a toxic environment with a person just like that. She always has something oppressive to say. Anticipating her bull crap every day terrorizes me. I’m sorry u r experiencing that. you got someone here who understands your frustration from a females perspective though. I too feel suicidal sometimes thinking I might be stuck here forever.   I won’t do anything harmful for real. Please you don’t do the same. Deal?

daddyissuesclub,ffbxa2q,t3_esn3wq,1579785759.0,"Often dreams are facades for other themes in our lives. Perhaps you honestly respect your dad and want to manifest a man a lot like him in your life.  I had a terrible dad, but if your dad was a loving, protective and validating person you might have had the perfect model for a Man U want to marry or whatever. I could totally be wrong but I don’t want u to think you a weirdo or anything."

self,ff7qr8e,t3_erxish,1579656073.0,"Yeah I could see how sitting that isn’t aligned with the gym mentally. I worked in restaurants where the boss would come up to us if we were posted up chillin and be like, “If you’re leaning you could be cleaning.” It’s annoying buy lots of jobs wreck your body. You mind is eligible for wrecking too by a job. Hope u find what u need and want"

science,ff7njzm,t3_erw0p7,1579653821.0,We are social species. Solitary feels a lot like abandonment or neglect. That emptiness can definitely kill us slowly. I work in a jail and struggle with that but we have some seriously dangerous people here. Seems like the system knows just what to do to punish people.
needadvice,ff7n8c2,t3_erzbn0,1579653594.0,"I get it especially at your age. Try not to let it become a shopping addiction. I try to avoid using shopping as entertainment, also I personally can spend a lot at places like Target so I try not to go in there and finally if I find something I want often I’ll leave it to buy later and if it’s still on my mind the next time I go to that store I’ll buy it. It’s tough!"

Marijuana,ff42qys,t3_erfbou,1579554270.0,I have a couple other clients who were already transient who moved here for the legal weed. You right studies are necessary. I’m relying the information told to me by the people I’m concerned with. Believe me I’m not anti homeless nor am I anti pot.
cheating_stories,ff407i0,t3_er9iro,1579552692.0,So sorry about your situation. I don’t know how you feel about therapy but I’m doing EMDR and it has helped me push my mind past mental obstacles such as the pain of a break up. Perhaps that could work for you too...
Marijuana,ff3znse,t1_ff3vjy2,1579552354.0,Well we legalize weed and shortly after homelessness tripled. People come here with dreams of making it in the business but can’t hang with the rise of real estate.  I work with a lot of them and that’s what they have told me. It’s not a perception it’s what I’ve been told by the homeless population. They are here for the drugs. Sounds like I offended you. My bad. I know there is a lot of other factors but I’m not going to deny the correlation.
