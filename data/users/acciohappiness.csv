orangetheory,ffhxx0o,t1_ffhjjwp,1579958679.0,I second this! All my leggings are from Zella. I highly recommend the high-waisted 7/8 length live-in leggings. If cost is an issue keep an eye out for sales. This is an in-house Nordy brand and at least a couple styles/colors are always on sale during any of their events.
bulletjournal,ff7t6dv,t3_eroa19,1579657753.0,Gorgeous! What pen/marker do you use to color the page black? It looks flawless!
bulletjournal,fclouyd,t1_fck13c6,1577752877.0,Thank you! I copied it from here: https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ryzhychenko-olga/decolot/
bulletjournal,fcj7whu,t3_ehcg70,1577679502.0,Very pretty! Today my cat decided that the elastic band on my new normal would be fun to chew on... but it's not completely chewed through so hoping it will hold up for a while haha
bulletjournal,fc23289,t1_fc22p06,1577338420.0,It is awesome to be able to erase pen! And I like being able to fully erase a completed to do list and leave a fresh clean page. For me it's even more satisfying then crossing off items from the list as they're done.
