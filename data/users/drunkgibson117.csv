formcheck,fckecnh,t1_fcke3h8,1577723433.0,"Your hips firing up faster than your shoulders would suggest otherwise. The position you're ending up in (if you were squatting with the same form) would be a good morning squat. Maybe it's the camera angle that makes it look like your lower back is rounding, but either way the technique isn't right. I'll link you some videos below in an edit im a sec.

formcheck,fckdnks,t3_ehmafs,1577722983.0,"Your hips are rising to fast, you're rounding your back, you're not setting your hips before the pull. 

The first two would suggest that you are not pulling from a position of tensions. What that means is, pulling the slack out of the bar by tensioning your shoulders and back while loading your hamstrings. (It should be uncomfortable). Also better bracing techniques will help that position. 

Now for setting your hips, Dan Greene describes it as ""trying to dip your nuts on the bar"" bryce krywzalskdhsoanf (calgary barbell i cant spell his name) defines it as ""getting your hips close to the bar. 

Some fixes I've personally used as have my athletes, 
1. Deadbug stretch for bracing
2. Chair deadlifts. (Position refinement and bracing)
3. Tempo deadlifts as slow as possible
4. Good mornings (learning to keep medial erectors tight)

formcheck,fbq7kva,t3_ee4jte,1577029024.0,"The one sided pain you mentioned might be a result of hip shift. I cant tell from this angel though. 

If you are having a hip shift issue, start by slowing down the tempo. 3 sec down/3 sec up.  Drive your big toes down into your shoes (this will keep your knees out and hopefully aid in activation of the weak side. Last but not least, do some unilateral work. Hip shift is often the result of your dominant side being stronger than your weaker side

Other that the issue you mentioned. Looks good! Squatting by the fire place obviously add to the technique!"
