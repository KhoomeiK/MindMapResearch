That's it isn't it?  People have asked us over the years why we adopted our daughter as an adult and that was a big part of it - making a legal, permanent relationship between us. She really needed that emotionally - to know that when we said we were her family, we meant it forever, and we needed it too, to legally say, ""Yes, this is our daughter."""
Adoption,ff6yugb,t3_erikix,1579637703.0,"Glad you got the link you needed!

We adopted our oldest daughter after she became part of our family as a teenager after she became an adult and could consent to her own adoption. : ) She was 21 years old at the time, and is now 34.

I wish you well!"
Adoption,ff6yb1l,t3_es0363,1579637386.0,"I'm an adoptee and have submitted my DNA to both [ancestry.com](https://ancestry.com) and [23andme.com](https://23andme.com) (I did the health and ancestry one at 23andme to try to gain some more insight into my original father's family as I know very little).

We also submitted our oldest daughter's and  her daughter, our oldest granddaughter's DNA. Our granddaughter's father is from Singapore, and he abandoned our daughter while she was pregnant and hasn't been heard from in 17 years. We were/are hoping to get some matches from our granddaughter's paternal side to try to lead her to his family.

So far her only matches are from her maternal side, but as more and more people test, we are hoping to get some from the paternal side too.

As far as ancestry - I think both sites did a decent job of giving all of us an idea of where our ancestors came from."
Adoption,ff42scc,t3_erhkrr,1579554295.0,"I hope it goes well.  : )

One of our granddaughters has a father who abandoned her and our daughter before she was born.  When she was about your daughter's age, we talked about why he might have done that and I said at the time that sometimes when people become parents, they aren't ready for it and that it had nothing to do with her at all.  I think she understood/understands that (she just turned 17), but not knowing where he is and who he is has definitely had an impact on her.  If your daughter can have some glimpses into his life, that will help her a lot I think.

Our oldest daughter became part of our family as a teenager, after living a nightmare of a childhood. Her original father did much the same thing as yours did - dropped out of her life after serving a prison sentence for attempting to kill her mother, then got in contact with and kept up contact for a year or so, then dropped her like a rock again until she was in her 20s, then had contact again for about another year, then dropped her like a rock which is where it was at when he killed himself a few years ago.
