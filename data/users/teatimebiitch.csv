I love this sub but it can be hard voicing your opinions here because it’s a predominantly white sub, and they simply do not have the same experiences that people of color have in America/other Western countries. It’s a never-ending fear, one that is even all-consuming at times. It’s especially worse now more than ever, because it just seems that people have a huge, even personal vendetta against minorities/those in marginalized groups. 

I have the same fear, so I have no advice. Just keep on pushing and stay safe out here. Try not to let it get you down - we are worthy."

It is **never** just hair to us. There is pretty much never any other group of people who are actively discriminated against because of *the hair that grows out of their head*.

In the late 18th century in Louisiana, black women were known to wear elaborate hairstyles. Some of these styles weren't even all that ""elaborate""; it's just that to a white person at the time, the texture and the way that black hair holds was just so foreign and alien to them. Not only was black hair foreign to them, it was also very exotic and drew the attention of many white men. To address this ""problem,"" Governor Don Esteban Miró enacted the Edict of Good Government (AKA the ""Tignon Laws"") that ""[prohibited Creole women of color from displaying ‘excessive attention to dress’ in the streets of New Orleans](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5abvx/black-womens-hair-illegal-tignon-laws-new-orleans-louisiana)."" To correct this ""problem,"" they were forced to wear a tignon, or scarf, tied around their hair to hide it. This was a way of controlling black women and reinforcing the fact in that time that they belonged to the class of the enslaved, whether they were free or not, and this is more or less how the politics and policing of black hair began.

**And maybe if you actually asked people why they felt annoyed by seeing nonblack people wear these hairstyles, you would know that it's not the fact alone that they're wearing these hairstyles.** **If you actually ask a black person, just seeing nonblack people wear braids or dreads doesn't make us fly into a rage like you think it does. It's the fact that while wearing these hairstyles, nonblack people get no backlash for it in the sense that they are pushed out of professional and educational spaces while black people are**. There are many more cases that I have seen and experienced for myself that have not made the news.  It's always very telling to me when people who aren't in our community say ""it's just hair"" because you all aren't even willing to look at the actual **history** behind it and realize why we may feel the way we feel about the issue.

So no, it's not just hair."
TrueOffMyChest,fdabk53,t3_ejszsf,1578244167.0,"I totally hear what you're saying and have experienced some of it myself, but it also seems as though you have some ""I'm not like other girls"" stuff going on. Not all women talk about their friends behind their backs, and you would not BELIEVE the petty drama that men can instigate. I think you should work on trying to better yourself and just find people who you can be friends with and relate to, no matter the gender."
TrueOffMyChest,fda8ij1,t1_fda5q2w,1578242992.0,"For real though! It always seems as though the people who care the most are the ones who are walked on the most like doormats. I was raised to be super selfless and put others first, and it's gotten me nowhere."
TrueOffMyChest,fda84sy,t3_eju6l1,1578242825.0,"As someone who was raised with that ideology without the label ""Female Dating Strategy,"" I can tell you right now that this is an extremely toxic worldview for women to have. It just plays into the idea that men are scum and only want one thing. It's such a toxic way of thinking and living, and is also extremely unfair to men. As someone who's currently trying to train themselves to rewire their thinking and not view men as a dangerous monolith that are out to harm women, I would recommend staying as far away from this shit as possible, **especially** if you're a woman."
TrueOffMyChest,fda75wj,t3_ek5291,1578242538.0,"As a feminist, I hate these SJW types. As many other commenters have said, it seems as though they believe that there is no chance of redemption or self-improvement. I'm not saying we have to go around being apologists for Nazis or anything like that; I just don't think that if someone makes one mistake, we should ""cancel"" them forever. We have all made mistakes, whether they have to do with race, etc. or not, and I'm sure that we wouldn't want to be judged as harshly."
TrueOffMyChest,fda6uu7,t3_ek8chz,1578242406.0,"Whether you're a pet owner who calls their pet their baby, a parent of a child, a pet owner and a parent, WHATEVER - why can't we just let people do what they want and be happy as long as it doesn't actively and directly harm anyone else? Parents - WHY are you letting what someone calls their pet affect you? Pet owners - WHY are you trying to argue with them? It just makes no sense. Like damn. No one can ever just be positive anymore and let people live!"

It first started with how she eats with her mouth open and smacks her food, as well as how she swallows and smacks her lips in between each sentence, but now even just listening to her talk makes me extremely uncomfortable and makes my skin crawl. Sigh."
misophonia,fc6jzve,t3_edqjtg,1577482395.0,"My mother is the worst trigger of my misophonia. I’m also completely grossed out by how her face looks when she chews. She opens her mouth as wide as she possibly can and it’s fucking disgusting. She also chews and crunches at the same time as talking. But the fucking WORST is when she smacks and chomps her lips whenever she eats anything, even ICE CREAM? I have begun to heavily resent my mother because of her disgusting habits. 

I’m currently sitting with her right now because of this stupid fucking required “family time”. She’s smacking and popping her lips and the crunch that she makes with these chips is so fucking loud. I want to kill myself."
