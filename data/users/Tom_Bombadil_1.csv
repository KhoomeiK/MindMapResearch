facepalm,fgtz82e,t1_fgtx8d6,1581111308.0,Me too. You smell great btw.
hisdarkmaterials,fgtw6tk,t3_f0fbf5,1581110228.0,Ah yes. The beautiful sausage.
facepalm,fgtvtk4,t1_fgtschp,1581110033.0,"Only speaking from my experience. I don’t want to say all Americans. But the lads I’ve worked with hate the idea ppl might think they’re gay. A classic ‘I’ve nothing against the gays but I don’t want them being all up in my face about it’.

rugbyunion,fgrzd1z,t3_ezr8dx,1581063794.0,"Wasn’t there a time when the flankers were wing forwards and the 8 was forward full back? I feel I read those were old school names. Kinda feel like I’ve sometimes heard wing forward still. 

I definitely understand whit 8 replaced ‘forward fullback’ if this is true and not some mad shit I’m misremembering"
