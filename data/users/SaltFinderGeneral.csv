The only stuff I've seen from legal dispensaries (speaking personally I prefer the quality and price provided by 'grey market' dispensaries) here had normal packaging, although that was after friends/acquaintances got to it so maybe they threw away the extra crap. Haven't had any issues with stuff I've bought in the States either, although that experience has been limited as I'm not south of the border often."
worldnews,ff4nt0v,t1_ff4asmn,1579568123.0,"Care to elaborate? Almost every dispensary I've bought from sold their product in single containers (usually plastic, once in awhile glass), and at least one encouraged you to show up with your own jar/bag to put your pot in. I can think of just one dispensary that had their products prepackaged in 1g bags (which is not just wasteful, but quite frankly stupid), the rest have been alright."

I mean, we CAN feed 12 billion people (potentially much more than that) sustainably, it's just that we WON'T because our current agricultural practices and the western diet it enables are far too profitable (albeit for a very small number of people) to do away with, even if they're massive environmental disasters.

fatlogic,fdkgi8v,t1_fdk8ftc,1578503382.0,"Again, it's up to the consumer to find out where their meat (well, all their food really) is coming from and make the change based on their own values. I don't care if someone stops eating meat entirely to reduce their carbon footprint; that's their prerogative and more power to them if it makes them happy. I do however take issue with people who don't fully grasp the issue, and are under the impression simply cutting out meat will fix the problem, without understanding the majority of their produce is also grown in a way that is incredibly detrimental to the environment, while at the same time failing to understand that there are sustainable and regenerative ways to raise livestock."
fatlogic,fdkg1uz,t1_fdkcl2h,1578503105.0,"Except that isn't inherently the case. Properly managed livestock can be used to repair soil carbon levels (ie: they function as a carbon sink), and it's entirely possible to stack growing space with pasture space (ex: ducks and chickens can be allowed to graze in market gardens if managed properly so they don't destroy produce, sheep are a common addition to hopyards, and pigs can be raised in agroforestry operations). Just because it's uncommon and you aren't aware of it doesn't mean it's not a possibility.

Edit: I think you're also quite naive about how damaging to the environment 99% of plant based nutrition is. Sorry, but conventional agricultural practices are an environmental disaster all the way around, not just where livestock are concerned."

fatlogic,fdifnfv,t1_fdicy1t,1578441827.0,"Possibly, but not necessarily. I think price is ultimately going to become a big limiting factor for the forms of meat that are currently most popular in the western world (or at the very least in North America), which is likely to result in fewer people consuming beef regardless of any other factors. Especially with the big demographic shift in agriculture that's coming up over the course of the next decade or so in the western world we absolutely have the chance to change how we handle livestock in a big way without being forced into never-ending factory farming. I might be overly optimistic about this kind of thing (I run a small regenerative market garden so I kinda have to be optimistic about people changing their eating and purchasing habits), but it's possible.

I should point out I don't disagree with the premise 'people should be eating less red meat', my issue is more with people who pat themselves on the back for eating less beef while still eating large amounts of things that are produced in a manner that is detrimental to the environment. That is to say, I agree people should not be eating so much factory farmed beef BUT I don't view simply swapping it out for factory farmed chicken (or whatever else) as being a good enough alternative, and I'd much rather see people find local, regenerative or sustainable farms and get ANY kind of meat from those sources (bonus if it's something like chicken or rabbit, but if it's pork or beef so be it) instead. I realize I didn't do a very good job of explaining that in my prior post, apologies for that."

fatlogic,fdi4n1j,t1_fdhq33c,1578435658.0,That isn't inherently true. Obtaining beef and pork from small farmers who practice sustainable agriculture is still better than getting chicken and eggs from factory farms. Finding out WHERE your meat comes from is more important than just switching the type of meat you eat (although consuming less red meat would probably still be in most people's best interests anyway).

newSuns,fdaw6kn,t1_fdaqsyz,1578251047.0,"There are 15 breaks between sets, so that's 45 minutes of rest (which is admittedly a lot) at 3 minutes per break. That leaves 75 minutes for actually completing your sets, which means something like 4.5 minutes per set on your t1 and t2. I'm going way out on a limb and guessing that probably isn't accurate.

Take as long as you need before jumping into your 1+ set, but use a stopwatch to make sure you're sticking to a shorter rest time between your other sets. Superset some accessories in between t2 sets, and of course make sure you're staying focused at the gym, and not spending too much time chit-chatting, looking at your phone, or whatever else. Hopefully that helps."
