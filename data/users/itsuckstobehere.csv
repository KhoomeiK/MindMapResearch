I’m not sure if you’re already getting professional help but if you’re not then please consider it. not just for your son but for you as well, because you deserve to be happy"

SuicideWatch,fc6dqri,t3_egejba,1577478164.0,"Hey please could you contact a suicide hotline? I know it’s terrifying but if you really really want to end your life then at least give it a go as you have absolutely nothing to lose. If they’re awful then you can hang up and forget it happened but at least try, please. They won’t violate you in any way, all they want to do is help, they’ll have so much experience with people scared or intimidated to call so please don’t be put off. Take care OP"

People with heart failure tend to have low pulse pressure but this does NOT mean people with pulse pressure by default have heart failure

Edit: Also keep in mind that some home machines are not very accurate, so it’s likely your pulse pressure may not even be this low"
Anxiety,fc44ngm,t3_eg1kga,1577406527.0,"I can relate, trust me tho the maintenance guy will have tons of experience with mess and will not assume or care who did it, he/she has prob been told a million times about mess being made, with regards to how you can avoid feeling this way - think of it as though you’re doing someone a favour by letting them know something is wrong rather than feeling guilty, telling someone and making them aware is a good thing because otherwise they wouldn’t know!! you seem like a very genuine person"
