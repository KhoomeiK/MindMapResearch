Them being Chinese is somewhat relevant... in the sense that it can be reasonably assumed that the simply didn't know. From what I've seen around the neighbourhood, they seems to be the biggest perpetrators of this. If it were the 70s, it would have been the Greeks.  If it were some random Australian family, it'd be worse I guess, because then it would be ignorance as opposed to obliviousness. Preserving the aesthetic of a historical district is somewhat important to me, and it isn't a big ask to have appropriate doors and windows. If you want to buy a house like that, then there is an onus of responsibility."

Everytime I visit for a few days, I'll bring enough water with me. I'll get a small water tank soon though. I'm planning on getting some automatic irrigation going shortly, where I'll be able to water the young trees with a small electric pump when I'm away.  The cabin is completely off-the-grid, and there's a solar panel+battery for powering the lights and other small things. The battery gets fully charged by the sun each day, so it's pretty good. There's a gas bottle under the cabin with a line that goes neatly through the wall into the gas stove."

australia,fdqwzxb,t3_emo6bw,1578676051.0," I also think a major focus now should be to make our land use and land clearing laws a A LOT tighter. Farmers are going absolutely nuts with clearing ever since the laws were relaxed. Australia has become a deforestation hotspot again, and our native forests are being converted into bare expanses of dust. The ground dries out, the hydrological cycle gets altered, and rainfall becomes less frequent and irregular. On top of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, stopping and repairing some of the damage that has been done to our country from agriculture and deforestation should be a major priority! We're literally destroying Australia's world renowned identity as being of place untamed natural beauty..."

Advice,fdmnlol,t3_em4gj3,1578556951.0,"What your parents are doing is very very irresponsible in my opinion. Your teenage years are accompanied by significant changes in the brain. It is a very bad idea to be messing around with any drugs at such a young age. There is scientific literature that has demonstrated marijuana can exacerbate certain underlying mental issues such as schizophrenia. The thing is that there is still relatively little research done on the effects of marijuana as there are ethics issues that make carrying out such studies pretty difficult. There are still a lot of unknowns about the long-term effects. Your parents are encouraging their 14 year old child to take drugs... even you can see that's really wrong. If authorities found out, you'd be taken away from them. If you're having problems with anxiety, it might be best to go to a doctor first and talk to them about it. Tell them weed has helped alleviate your anxiety in the past, and get their advice about treatment options."
