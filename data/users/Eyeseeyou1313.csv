videos,ff9wtb9,t1_ff9klnc,1579723221.0,"Yeah, if you are sad or feeling bad overall, crying helps out a lot in distressing and letting all the pent up emotions just be washed away."
AdviceAnimals,ff9vetm,t1_ff9v744,1579722339.0,"No shit, Socialist ideas are not bad, they are made for the people/every day citizens and for their best interests. It protects us from getting fucked by big corporations that if given the chance they would rather get slaves. A full on Socialist country is not good either, something between Capitalism and Socialism like Norway is ideal and allows many to profit."

AskReddit,ff9qwh5,t1_ff9kdd2,1579719047.0,"It would be below, since a lot of younger people are looking up to them and that can affect how they behave. For example, a lot of people think that XXXTENTACION was a poor victim when he got shot, what they don't realize is that even though he made music and struggled with a lot of problems he was still a horrible human being and nothing good he ever did will justify all his bad actions. Younger people shouldn't be looking up to those type of people."

Corporate usually doesn't even risk it with things like the flu, if two customers get sick because of you then they would get in so much trouble. Unless you worked for mom and pop, then well that sucks."
AdviceAnimals,ff8ewbm,t1_ff8c7iw,1579675529.0,"Nah, that's illegal since if you show up and you are really sick you are a major hazard to the general public. Health Department could close the restaurant if one of the employees is sick. Restaurants shouldn't be risking it that much, I work for one and they do so many dumb things."

facepalm,ff3vxse,t1_ff3vnkm,1579550027.0,"You would think so, but depending on size, how many tables youve sat before to the other server, everything matters. If you do it right, all the tables would be eating in no time, do it wrong and there are a lot of delays."
facepalm,ff3lqdl,t1_ff3ifvm,1579543735.0,"Online reviews don't really matter imo. Every time I go to a new restaurant, I judge it myself and keep the opinion to myself. If I like it I'll come back, but if not then I won't.  Nobody needs my opinion and nobody wants the opinion of Karen or Andrew, they don't even know what they want."
facepalm,ff3l24n,t1_ff3kj68,1579543321.0,That means that there are 10 more reservations and the host are trying to find the most efficient way to sit them correctly.

marvelstudios,ff2ftf2,t1_ff2fiu0,1579504315.0,"Oh, I misunderstood. I thought you said he couldn't wield it. I still think Endgame Thanos couldn't wield it yet, cause he is a bit insecure, but IW Thanos is totally a wielder of Mjolnir as he is someone with confidence and being sure of who he is and what his mission is. He was a villain in that he killed a lot of people, instead of just going for the stones and getting rid of those people. He caused unnecessary misery, plus he would have succeeded if he didn't kill so many, and just attacked Earth by surprise. Gotta go in fast and get out fast, you know?"
marvelstudios,ff2f7ed,t1_ff2f2im,1579503612.0,"So? Mjolnir is for whoever is worthy of it, it includes killing and doing other things. Knowing when to do the right thing, doesn't have to be morally correct, just the right thing."
Serverlife,ff2ejli,t3_er816t,1579502869.0,"Is no one gonna say anything about the workinh for ten hours without a break? You better be making top dollar if you are working for that many hours without a break, otherwise sue them for that illegal ass shit."
