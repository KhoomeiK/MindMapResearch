Shitstatistssay,ffeoz3x,t1_ffdu8i2,1579858140.0,Businesses in America and corporations are all doing quite well and the average employee is paid less now than his father or grandfather before him. Instead of defending a system that needs none of your help maybe examine why you need to crucify and curse a woman online because your precious sociopath-economic conceits feel slightly threatened.
Shitstatistssay,ffddw4f,t1_ffb57pq,1579818824.0,"Only on the internet is a rant like this rewarded. Gotta say I’m not usually heartened by the self-righteousness of butt-hurt dudes calling women cunts. Beyond that you’re basically defending corporations and modern capitalism in a time corporations have manipulated the system to best suit them making the most money ever. And you’re so angry that a tiny woman challenges this idea that you turn this place into 4chan. 

AOC isn’t a communist. Most likely an FDR style democratic-socialist. Which is what we are anyway. Social security, Medicare, Medicaid, police, fire departments, welfare, libraries. Those are socialist ideas. You benefit from them. It is the reality you live in based on facts not indignant internet queefing."

brakebills,ff62r16,t1_ff5xa2i,1579617664.0,The show plot lines are definitely strongest when adapted from book. I’m getting tired of these weak time-filling musical interludes. I didn’t watch this show to watch musical theater  karaoke. I’m just bummed that show seems to think that it has a social responsibility to kill off the white guy because he’s colonizer or some shit.

changemyview,feg183o,t1_fee0biz,1579072576.0,"The problem with your argument is that you’re  building a case for the idea that any amount of firebombing and nuclear devastation would not have convinced the Japanese one way or the other. Especially if you go with the argument that the land war in Manchuria was just as, or more devastating. Especially since there was a deadlock vote ultimately decided by the Emperor.  It seems that the infliction of death by lit signaling that the war was decided and proving that to Emperor.

It’s a terrible fuckup and it’s absolutely Iran’s fault and it should never have happened but it absolutely wouldn’t have  happened because Trump is a massive numpty  fucknut who makes decisions for his own ego at the expense of regular people.

Also, I want to emphasize that redditors talking about Iran is internet cancer. No group is less trustworthy to report or know reliable information than internet dweebs from nowhere talking about a country they heard about in a thread when they were teenagers and only mention in context when they want to point out how free they were under the Shah because he allowed mini-skirts with his secret police."

worldnews,fe6rk67,t1_fe68mi3,1578902038.0,"This is a seriously biased take that seems to have some stake in preserving themoral purity of the United States. Let’s get one thing straight, the US has absolutely, and as a matter of historical record, toppled democratic governments to install despots. In many cases through direct or proxy assassination. 

Secondly, the coup and the Democratic potential of a nation that was previously being oppressed through the control of British oil interests is not in question And (this includes me) no one who chips in on reddit without credentials is any kind of authority worth listening to on the Iranian topic. Which regularly spews forth a stream of people who wish to emphasize what a nice guy the Shah was while ignoring how he was a puppet. Certainly not one that fails to mention the secret police he had. 

You haven’t really provided any real evidence for your points. And the burden of overturning historical orthodoxy is on those with differing opinions. Which you don’t do. Even that link you have about the referendum one scroll down says that there were talks to create a referendum to remove power from the Shah of Iran and start a republic. Which serves to contradict the smarmy point you were making. 

Long story short? “Internet experts on Iran” can piss off and make way for the people who know what they’re talking about. Have a nice day."
