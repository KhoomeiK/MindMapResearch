TumblrInAction,ffgwhqs,t1_ffgq863,1579916833.0,"Rape, of both adults and children, happens predominantly by whatever racial demographics make up the area you live in.  The U.K. and U.S. are predominantly white, and also actively fight against human trafficking.  In other countries there's less reporting and policing, which is why people from wealthy countries travel intentionally to be predators where it's easy to do and not get caught.  Hell, in some countries child marriage still happens regularly out in the sticks, or in Utah (thanks Mormons).

But when you only see the world through your one specific lens of racism you ignore everything else.  It's less about the racism and more about the conformity.  You can call conformity racism if it makes you feel better, but as a ginger I know exactly what it's like to be born with hair outside the norm.  My hair's existence itself is the true minority, 2% of the entire world, so if you really want to talk hair bullying we can.

Everything in the U.S. is a thing with conformity.  Dress this way, wear your hair this way, and god forbid you're also left handed.  I was only allowed to write with my left hand in elementary school, everything else I was forced to do right handed.  Oh, and my white trash rat tail wouldn't fly either, guess that's racist?"

It's worn by people of varying ethnicities, and even the most middle class white suburban individual sporting the hairstyle will be subjected to judgment and punishment.  The stigma surrounding it is not an issue of racism, although it may be for some segment of the population that is racist, it's one of not understanding the hairstyle.  If you want to talk about uniquely African hairstyles, or other ethnic hairstyles, then sure, but this hairstyle in specific has existed in so many cultures that the problems are hairstyle specific and not culture specific."
nottheonion,ffb2lhh,t1_ffay7yp,1579750210.0,"I think it's less about racism and more ignorance about the hair style and the way it looks.  Anyone, of any ethnicity, tends to get flak with this hairstyle.  There's a fair bit of diversity to locs, and to people not familiar with the care and amount of work it takes to do it right it can look very unkempt.

As far as intentionally separated goes, that varies as well.  If you're talking freeform then you end up with the kind of results that resemble what I was referring too, except cleaner.  That's also what people think of when they think of gross dreads, because they don't know what it is.

We know more about this style of hair than the average person.  Assuming they have any idea about time/effort involved is giving them too much credit.  All they see is a bunch of hair hanging in ropes that looks poorly kept, and thus assume it's dirty."

changemyview,ff824gx,t1_ff80js7,1579663990.0,"These are exactly the types of arguments where I'll ask for a source.  Maybe they're wrong, maybe I'm wrong, but if we're both working with different sets of data then it's a pointless debate because we've got different sets of ""facts"" which may be in contention with one another.

The art of lying with statistics makes debates in general annoying, because discussions can often be predicated on something that's misrepresented or not taken in the right context.  Take the gender pay gap for instance.  That's been argued about so much, and there are many statistics that are used erroneously because they're misunderstood.  Seeing the source data helps with those kinds of issues.

I'm in agreement with you, and I think this is where OP is missing the importance of knowing the source of someone's data they're basing an argument off of.  If it's just philosophical ramblings then by all means we don't necessarily need a source, but if we're talking hard facts then we need to be on the same page.
