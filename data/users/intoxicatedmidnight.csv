popheads,ffef0kk,t3_et5kam,1579845529.0,">In the film, then-and-now photos illustrate just how thin Swift had gotten during the “1989” era, versus the still svelte but healthier look she sported by the time she toured behind the “Reputation” album in 2018. Swift says that her under-eating in that earlier time severely affected her stamina on tour.  
>  
>“I thought that I was supposed to feel like I was going to pass out at the end of a show, or in the middle of it,” she attests in the documentary. “**Now I realize, no, if you eat food, have energy, get stronger, you can do all these shows and not feel (enervated).**” Swift says she doesn’t care so much now if someone comments on a weight gain, and she’s reconciled “the fact that I’m a size 6 instead of a size double-zero.” **Swift says she was completely unaware that anything was wrong in her double-zero era, and had a defense at the ready should it come up**. If anyone expressed concern, she’d say, “‘What are you talking about? Of course I eat. …. I exercise a lot.’ And I *did* exercise a lot. But I wasn’t eating.”

Eating disorders is such a tricky experience and comes in various forms and I'm glad Taylor Swift is talking about her experience. I will admit that I truly didn't realize that something was wrong until she gained weight during the hiatus and before the Reputation era. I think it was during [this performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfunk7jSgvU) that I realized that even though she gained weight, she was still slim and at a healthy weight, and that the 1989 era was the one that stood out. Even on this video, I recall reading a lot of comments about how fat she'd become, which is like ??? what. I personally chalked her 1989 era weight to always being tall, skinny and lanky, and you know, being on tour and exercising regularly.

>The filmmaker points out that there were clearly plenty of people who *didn’t*think Swift was too thin back in the mid-2010s. **“You can also just not notice people being really skinny, because we’re all so accustomed to seeing women on magazine covers who are unhealthy-skinny, and that’s become normalized.” Even with non-celebrities, Wilson says, everybody’s a body critic.** “It’s incessant, and I can say this as a woman: It’s amazing to me how people are constantly like ‘You look skinny’ or ‘You’ve gained weight.’ People you barely know say this to you. And it feels awful, and you can’t win either way. So I think it’s really brave to see someone who is a role model for so many girls and women be really honest about that. I think it will have a huge impact.”

I agree it will have a huge impact. I've struggled with my weight all my life and although my struggle with weight is trying to lose it, Taylor sharing her experience is a reminder that even supermodels/celebrities have insecurities and even they have struggles and the way that they look doesn't necessarily equate happiness and health.

>“I love people like (actress and activist) **Jameela Jamil**, because she says things in a really articulate way,” the singer tells us. “The way she speaks about body image, it’s almost like she speaks in a hook. If you read her quotes about women and body image and aging and the way that women are treated in our industry and portrayed in the media, I swear the way she speaks is like lyrics, and it gets stuck in my head and it calms me down. **Because women are held to such a ridiculous standard of beauty. We’re seeing so much on social media that makes us feel like we are less than, or we’re not what we should be, that you kind of need a mantra to repeat in your head when you start to have harmful or unhealthy thoughts**. So she’s one of the people who, when I read what she says, it sticks with me and it helps me.”

Women supporting women? We love to see it. Jameela is amazing and I enjoy seeing her trying to tackle the Kardashians and other members of propagating laxatives.

>Few women viewing the film will fail to nod their heads as Swift describes the impossibility of any body shape or size living up to all the standards for beauty. **“If you’re thin enough, then you don’t have that ass that everybody wants,” she says in the film. “But if you have enough weight on you to have an ass, your stomach isn’t flat enough. It’s all just f—ing impossible.”** As she became aware of the problem, Swift says in the film, it would cause her to “go into a real shame/hate spiral.”

The double standards are insane and the impossible expectations society holds for female celebrities is toxic and shameful. Fuck magazines and websites that profit off of sensationalizing minor issues and making them more dramatic than they actually are.

>She continues, “I don’t expect anyone with a pop career to learn how to do that within the first 10 years. And I know that there’s a lot of bad stuff that’s gone on recently, a lot of really hard stuff my family is going through, and a lot of opposition and feeling pressure or suppression of one kind or another. But I am actually really happy. Because **I pick and choose now, for the most part, what I care deeply about.** And I think that’s made a huge difference.”

This is a very important message and I'm so proud of Taylor for finding her voice and speaking (now) on the important issues: politics, body image, mental health, sexual assault, and detoxing, among others."

Personally, I know from prior experience that once I start skipping classes, I'll be much more lax and trick my mind into convincing myself that skipping another class won't do much harm. Some people can skip classes (for any kind of reason) and still get good grades, but that's not me lol. So, cold or not, just gotta suck it up and go. It's harder to convince myself to get out of bed and not sleep for ""five minutes more"" though :P

You get used to it. I find it much easier in the Spring sem when its just bone cold all the time than Fall when its sunny and slowly descends into awful slushiness. This doesn't mean I don't take a mental health day when needed, though. If I'm down, I'd rather give some time to the feelings than do nothing in class and feel even worse."
