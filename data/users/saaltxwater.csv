SkincareAddiction,ffs7taq,t3_eus69w,1580175262.0,Welp you just convinced me to finally make that derm appointment. I have an odd spot on my nose like this.
Documentaries,ffqkzdw,t1_ffq611f,1580137426.0,"I mean I think this is why the Mormons do it too. Complete indoctrination. No contact with family, can’t watch the news or anything to do with pop culture. It’s fucking weird."
reactiongifs,ffiga7b,t1_ffibakf,1579973168.0,Binge eating disorder is an eating disorder just as much as anorexia. It is a mental illness.

nottheonion,ffd0p96,t3_ess9v8,1579811120.0,"1) lots of checks when scanned into the computer light up the void watermark. 
2) it’s not illegal to have a fraudulent check and it’s way more common to assume that the customer has been taken advantage of than that the customer is trying to take advantage of the bank. 
3) they should have placed a hold if they were worried about it. Zero reason to call the police."

climbing,ff5wgdf,t1_ff54t8f,1579612548.0,It’s actually not that uncommon. If the hospital is small they may not have a large blood bank and so need further donations. In the US it’s pretty common to call specific donors before a patient goes into surgery if they have an odd blood type.
bulletjournal,ff4o7dh,t3_er7a4l,1579568405.0,I’m the same way. My cycle is all over the place so when I finally get my period after two months or so i’m just happy I’m not pregnant haha.
eczema,ff1pb2o,t3_eqxgsg,1579483164.0,I’ve also got eczema down south though I don’t have a dick. I’m gonna recommend La Roche Posay lipikar eczema cream. It has colloidal oatmeal and is honesty the best eczema lotion I’ve found. Might be worth a try.

medizzy,fegqbvu,t1_fegksab,1579100033.0,Or you can just cut the side with the put in half again and it makes it really easy to remove with your hands.
climbergirls,feeja76,t3_eo87ci,1579034886.0,I love that you’re also showing lead climbing. Most vlogs I’ve found are strictly boulder which are fun to watch but it’s cool to see some variety.

cringepics,fe6jspz,t1_fe5wuep,1578893203.0,Haha I was automatically doing the math to see if it lined up with LDS church times.
climbergirls,fdrrnia,t3_emwh5h,1578688720.0,Number one thing with bouldering is to just learn how to fall. There is a proper way (Jenn Sends on YouTube has a video about it I really liked) and you’ll be able to avoid a lot of injuries with proper technique.

climbergirls,fcnc75m,t1_fcl926k,1577808546.0,I totally had this on an autobelay the other day. The whole climb I was thinking “what if this thing malfunctioned?” But as soon as I let go and “fell” I felt fine.
Healthyhooha,fcnawjq,t1_fcn03vr,1577807672.0,There are non latex condom brands.

climbergirls,fcl1li2,t3_ehr38x,1577737829.0,I go through waves of anxiety on the wall. I usually just stop take a minute to breathe and let me heart rate settle and then keep going.

konmari,fc5t8dd,t1_fc5nnwl,1577465352.0,"This is what my husband and I do! My mom asked for a list so I sent her four items I’d like for her to choose from and instead she bought me new kitchen pans that I don’t need and have no room for, and clothing that she herself said she didn’t love but would be good for around the house. Such a waste."
