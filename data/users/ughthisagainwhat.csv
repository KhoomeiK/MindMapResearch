IdiotsInCars,fe4nivs,t1_fe2qq2o,1578861142.0,"This is why we should base opinions on statistics, not biased memory. In virtually every measurable way, driving now is far safer than it was in any year from 1970 to 1989. Some quick driving facts for you:

\- For 2010 to 2018, every single year has several thousand fewer crashes than every single year from 1975 (the first year the Department of Transportation started keeping detailed crash statistics) to 1989.

\- Fatalities are far less common -- per 100,000 miles driven, current fatalities are less than half of any period from 1970 to 1989.

\- The US population has grown over 100 million in that time.

Despite overall driving habits improving and automobile fatalities decreasing, motorcyclist deaths remain high. but it's not phones. First, you can't really make 'em safer like cars. And second, ownership rates and average age of ownership for motorcycles have both drastically increased since 1980.

Blaming phones for distracted driving is interesting because like...people who get distracted while driving are people who get distracted while driving. It's the habit itself, of being distracted, at issue. Not the phone. People take their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel, or mind off driving all the time even without phones, and definitely before phones. Makeup, food, pets, kids, things on the side of the road, boredom, sleepiness, DUI. The stats just aren't there to say that phones are a unique danger, much less responsible for ""10x worse drivers"" or a specific correlated increase in motorcyclist deaths.

Standing rulings determine how the law is enforced unless another law is passed (and this would probably take an amendment), and unlike the memo regarding indicting a sitting president, this isn't just based on legal theory. It's based on multiple SCOTUS rulings and the legal understanding of the pardon powers of the president. Legal scholars saying that it's an incorrect assessment are the ones whose opinions hold about as much weight as that memo, or a sovereign citizen. It doesn't matter what they think.

>There is NOTHING in the law that states the accepter of a pardon is admitting guilt.

Yes, there is. The Constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for crimes against the United States. The Constitution also bestows the power of legal interpretation on the Supreme Court, not twitter lawyers.

That pardon, as determined by our highest court, carries an imputation of guilt. Until a ruling or amendment changes that, it's the law of the land. It doesn't really matter if you think so or not; it's the established legal reality and will be enforced. All the downvotes you can muster won't change that.

The definition is very narrow (10 or more deaths) and the data is very clear.  


So yes, homicides and violent crime in general have been on a downward trend. However, mass shootings are abruptly skyrocketing."

The fact that a fructose-6-phosphate is a step doesn't really change our relationship with glucose or the fact it's our primary energy storage currency. 

It's more like everything on our highways is a car, and everything on their highway is a truck. And you're over here telling me ""well ackshually both have pedestrians at the most basic level."" But we're not talking about the most basic level, and I don't really see the point of writing somebody an essay on the Krebs cycle or glycolysis when the question is ""so what's so weird about the naked mole rat's relationship with fructose?""

If somebody's asking you to explain basic math, there's no reason to go full Descartes my guy. Especially when anybody looking for full, detailed information can just follow the sourcing to learn more."
todayilearned,fcp92p2,t1_fcormjd,1577854622.0,"The headline is awkward, but reading the study as well as the link you posted on fructolysis explain pretty well together. Yeah, we metabolize it, but it's not the \*basis\* for our metabolism -- glucose is. We turn fructose into glucose before actually storing or using it (well, also glycogen -- which you can think of as a long-term storage form of glucose -- and lactate). Apparently naked mole rats can run their metabolism from fructose entirely, which is typically a plant sugar. Our acquisition and digestion of fructose comes from plants, we don't create, use, or store fructose beyond digestion. Unlike glucose, using fructose as a primary energy source does not require a high level of oxygen, which is the cool part here. 

The first paragraph in the link you posted discusses the digestion of fructose and how, in our body, it is turned into glucose, glycogen, and lactate for use throughout the body. Conversely, the brain cells of naked mole rats can directly metabolize fructose into lactate themselves (takes place in the intestines for us), allowing them to survive better in oxygen-deprived environments."

Everything from psychological requirements to basic training is different. Most departments in large cities require education beyond high school, and  police academies often take several months to train officers. The United States does not exert federal/nationwide control over things like local police."
