AnimalsBeingBros,feg9z6k,t1_fefkkcg,1579084206.0,"If they are not drinking water and are dehydrated, a carer, nurse or veterinarian can give them fluids subcutaneously so should be called promptly upon finding the animal. Please do not contribute to this problem with an uneducated argument."
AnimalsBeingBros,feg9w2a,t1_fefrs6u,1579084085.0,"100% agreed. I'm a koala and possum rescuer and carer and every time my mum comes over when I have animals in care, it is a massive struggle to keep her from getting up close to them. It's so important to realise they need to retain the instincts of a wild animal of they are to be released and actually survive more than 3 days! Yes, this koala may seem cuddly. No, it is not cuddly, it is actually very very sick and would likely be biting you right now if it wasn't so sick. Let's not make it become used to people just because you CAN currently handle it, because we want to release an animal that will actually survive!"
AnimalsBeingBros,feg9ogz,t1_feftabk,1579083785.0,"Instead, he should have let the koala lap from the bowl or poured the water further from the koala so the koala is lapping from the stream. Water should never be poured into their mouths, that is a fast way to move from a sick yet recoverable animal to an animal that drowns in the bushfires. Please do not casually disregard safety information like this in the future, it can cost lives if someone reads this, decides they agree with you and pours water down a koala's throat."
AskReddit,fdu9bon,t1_fdrhtlg,1578729823.0,Agreed. I'm an Adelaidian who volunteers as a rescuer for Adelaide Koala Rescue and also Save Our Wildlife Foundation Inc and it is heart breaking every single day. We are so eternally grateful for any donations to help us treat the burns victims we find.
todayilearned,fdtimc4,t1_fdtcs9n,1578717292.0,"A lot of users aren't necessarily too fussed about the quality though. I know for some people it's a massive hobby and they try to get the best quality possible, but for me at least, the quality on Spotify and Youtube and any of the other media sources are more than good enough."
australia,fdf4z65,t1_fddjs36,1578353427.0,"True. We seem to get the really bad bushfires every 5-7 years. Based on this, in 20 years, we will likely have 3 more bad bushfires. If this one is this bad I don't even want to think about the next bad ones."
WTF,fdf45sd,t1_fdf3pte,1578352891.0,Rodents and birds aren't sensitive to it.
WiggleButts,fdde89a,t1_fdd5qtn,1578308177.0,"I would personally never risk it. If I'm going somewhere my dog can't, she stays at home. If I'm out with her and decide I want to go somewhere she isn't allowed in to, I take her home and then go back. She is my top priority when we are out together."

HumansBeingBros,fcph5q4,t1_fcpf8cy,1577863840.0,"It seems like a job really easy to stagnate in, you would almost want to change subjects or move schools or at least change up the classes a bit every few years!"

EDanonymemes,fcity2w,t1_fcis1xp,1577669740.0,"Isn't it interesting how so many chronic pain conditions seem to often be comorbid with ED? I've noticed IBS/Crohn's seems often comorbid with ED too, and even other repro conditions like PCOS etc as well."
EDanonymemes,fcirn9n,t3_ehcwhz,1577668192.0,"And when it causes such crippling pain you're stuck crying in the fetal position because even slightly moving to get up makes you feel like you'll actually rip in half, it's free restricting power!"
Pets,fcc8kzs,t1_fcbwtgg,1577595600.0,"True, a lot of pet stores do not adequately keep enclosures clean. Monthly is pushing it though, id you provide them with clean water at all times then depending on where you live you'll probably find bathing them only once or twice a year to be sufficient!"
Veterinary,fcbxv4r,t3_egx7kn,1577592188.0,"5th year vet student with hayfever allergies here, triggered by animals bringing outside in with them (I am allergic to outdoors dogs and cats but not indoors ones, and I also get hayfever when horse riding or working with cattle/sheep/alpacas). Mine is manageable with antihistamines and it is worth the slight discomfort for me - is the career worth the discomfort to you? Also, consider going to the doctor, there are some longer term allergy management plans available once you have identified your allergies!"
Pets,fcbtj8j,t1_fcaceq9,1577590804.0,"Ferrets actually do smell quite bad even when properly cared for, especially the males. Just wanted to correct that so that you don't have a nasty surprise if you ever do get ferrets!"
