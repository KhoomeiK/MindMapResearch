I mean the person casting the ""vote that counts"" doesn't need to go with the highest voted in their district. The only deterrent against this is a fine and it is only applicable in some states.

It just seems shady as fuck and open to corruption. Why not just have the popular vote from each region selected? Vote for who you want to be president and vice president. Anyway rant over."

Now, the difference is fundamentalists tend to take the bible scriptures in a more literal sense. With that being the case there is definitely some hate/intolerance there for the gay community etc. and some in that group are more likely to be racist in a broader sense as well. I dont need you to agree with me, that is just my opinion.

Edit: I am also atheist and the only dislike I have for religion is when someone tries to ""convert"" me. You're right though, if they're not hurting anyone they can do and believe whatever the fuck they want."

The best thing I heard was a friend telling me he was there for me. If I needed to talk about it, forget about it or go play some pool or whatever. I liked that because it genuinely felt like he just wanted to try to help me in the only way he could.

You're right about it getting easier and coming back. Especially knowing he never met my fiancee, and if I have kids he wont meet them either."
