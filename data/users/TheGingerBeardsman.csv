lifeisstrange,fdb4qnj,t1_fdb1yzb,1578253798.0,"Nathan was the one that drugged Kate, not Victoria. Yes, Victoria bullied Kate pretty hard but Chloe wasn't super cool to Max all the time either. Obviously it's nowhere near the same level but a comparison can still be made. As for bullying Kate with the video, yes it was fucked up but it was Victoria saying ""look, you're no better than the rest of us"" not ""jump off the roof."""

lifeisstrange,fd5r44j,t1_fd5mn02,1578180549.0,"I love their dynamic though and they're actually kind of similar to Max and Chloe. Victoria hides behind her evil bitch mask because of her insecurities and lack of attention from her parents. Chloe hides behind the mask of being an apathetic punk who's angry at everyone because of her abandonment issues and loneliness. Max and Kate are both shy and lack confidence in themselves (Max especially) but are kind and empathetic. Max and Kate help calm and stabilize Chloe and Victoria, while Chloe and Victoria boost their partners' confidence and help them ease out of their shells and live a little. 

Everyone likes a redemption story and Victoria is a prime candidate. She isn't actually evil like Jefferson and Nathan, just pretty self absorbed. She didn't know her good friend was drugging and murdering people. From her perspective, Kate was a hypocrite, preaching abstinence and basically attacking Victoria's partying lifestyle, then getting wasted and making out with everyone at the first opportunity. Victoria was admittedly a vicious bitch but she wasn't trying to drive Kate to suicide. She was just thinking about petty revenge, not the fact that the video would get back to Kate's family and church. 

I think that Victoria was threatened a bit by Kate too. Not as much as by Max but Kate was an easier target.  Kate was another talented girl, well liked by most people (Victoria was obsessed with popularity) and Kate was easier to bully because she wouldn't fight back like Max (not that Max really did) and she didn't seem as immune to insults as Max either. 

Sorry for the novel length response but I just really like what can be done with Chasemarsh."

lifeisstrange,fd02g5q,t1_fcyajbx,1578112652.0,"I think it's just that music wasn't used as well in LiS2. There were a lot of times where the lack of music was actually distracting. We were missing those establishing shots of Arcadia Bay with good accompanying music that helped immerse you in the town and paint a bigger picture. I think they may have cut the music budget in favor of the graphics, at least it feels that way. I also agree though that there aren't as many good songs as LiS and BtS but there were some. The menu song nails the LiS vibe."

AskReddit,fciuv2y,t3_eh8gs2,1577670364.0,"I had to quit recently after smoking fairly heavily for the last 2 years or so. Overall, it helped me quite a bit with depression and anxiety and ironically motivated me to lose a lot of weight (around 145 pounds in total) but after I quit, I woke up 4-5 times a night for almost a week absolutely *drenched* in sweat. I still don't sleep as well 2 months later and get bored much more easily. I live in a legal area but working in the health care industry and they test for weed :c"

lifeisstrange,fcb721e,t1_fcavxww,1577583203.0,"The worst was making the game a roadtrip. You don't get enough time with the side characters to really care about them. The lack of music also really helped it *not* feel like you're playing a LiS game at all and made some parts of the game drag on and took away a lot of the ambience. 

The logical inconsistencies also really put me off. The whole game is based around them being wanted fugitives but that makes zero sense. There is no evidence that Sean or Daniel had anything to do with what happened. Daniel is like 9 or 10 and Sean 15 or 16? They wouldn't be suspects at all.  A bomb basically went off leaving no evidence. Any logical person would assume that the two kids were kidnapped. Then all the people they meet agree with them running to Mexico for no reason. The grandparents don't get them a lawyer? Or their mom? Then in my ending, Sean gets 15 years in prison. For what crimes? There's no evidence he killed the cop, there literally can't be because he was killed by fucking magic. He roughed up the old guy a bit, in an attempt to get away from a *KIDNAPPING*. He didn't cause the explosion at the weed grow farm and even if he was charged for working there, he was a minor. No way does a minor get jail time like that for their first offence. Sean didn't start the fire at the church (don't get me started on how the church lady was illegally holding Daniel when his legal birth mother showed up). When the kids escape police custody, the guards are knocked out with magic again. They were looking at Sean when they got knocked out, how are they going to testify that he attacked them? There's no evidence that anyone finds out about the powers, so logically they would assume a 3rd party knocked them out from behind. I didn't even have Sean or Daniel shoplift or steal candy out of a car. There is NO chance that Sean gets 15 years in real life.

The whole game is built around stupid logic that makes it hard to suspend ones belief basically. There were many more things wrong too but I'm not trying to write an essay lol."
lifeisstrange,fcasxs0,t3_egwfic,1577575983.0,"I would love another Max and Chloe story but I think Dontnod could make a good game with new characters. Lis2 never lived up to its potential because of some terrible choices but the potential was there.
