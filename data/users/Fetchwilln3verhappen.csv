todayilearned,fczl96s,t1_fczib7w,1578103687.0,And how do you explain taking?  In its simplest form: Babies mimick the sounds that people around them make that get them what they need.
todayilearned,fczl43x,t1_fczj1bc,1578103602.0,"Babbling often is very often encouraged by adults, and adults tend to recriprocate the babbling back to them in the same inflection and tone.  A hallmark of Autism is lacking that social reciprocity, so it only makes sense that often kids with autism wouldn’t babble because they are not motivated by the social aspect of it."
todayilearned,fczkt25,t3_ejmgk4,1578103408.0,"There is also research that kids who use technology to communicate “babble” with their Augmentative Communication devices (think iPads that talk like Stephen Hawkins) as well.
It looks like they are just playing with the device and paying buttons to make noise but in reality they are exploring the motor memory skills and other aspects of how to work their “voice.”  It’s super fascinating!"

They have bottomless broccoli you can sub for fries
They also have the option to lettuce wrap all their sandwiches.  Couple that with the fact that you can swap out any beef burger for a grilled chicken breast and you have a wonderful WW meal for low points.  

Or do a lettuce wrapped chicken sandwich and splurge on the fries!"

specialed,fc2qrye,t3_ee4ofd,1577371268.0,"RFT has been a part of ABA forever and is just equlivilance relations and derived relational responding. It’s just another way to use ABA principles. ABA is a huge umbrella. Look up other research from Mark Dixon’s work with PEAK assessments or the research behind it for way more info. 

Just know that the PEAK research was all done by Dixon or his grad students so I wouldn’t necessarily call it peer replicated yet, but that’s just my opinion. It has been in peer reviewed journals but I personally think it needs replication from somebody outside of Dixon’s bubble before it’s put into place. But it IS rooted in solid ABA principles that should make it valid and reliable."
