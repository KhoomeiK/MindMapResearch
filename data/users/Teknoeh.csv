AskReddit,fcpkhi5,t3_eic8yl,1577866326.0,"I do. When I meet the love of my life I prioritize her and being with her over my work and career. 

I’ve reached a solid high point in my career, one I never thought I’d achieve. But while I sit here alone, in my nice apartment with my fancy shit around me I tell you this...

I would trade it all in a heart beat and go back in time and be the person she deserved, rather than the dickhead she ended up with.

Fuck money, fuck all the power in the world. When you are an unloveable fuck who will die alone, it doesn’t really mean all that much what you accomplish, because no one will be around to care."
