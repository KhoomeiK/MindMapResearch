The causes were partially weather and partially Stalin being a totalitarian asshole. Neither of those have anything to communism. 

[Somewhere from 5.3-5.9 million died.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1932%E2%80%9333) You may see alt-right types online saying 11-12 million. This figure is arrived at by comparing birth rates to rates in a 'normal' demographic period. That is not how the death tole is calculated for anything by anyone honest.

The Bengal famine of 1943 is comparable in terms of causes: a natural crop failure compounded by exploitative imperialist export policies. Did those 2-3 million people starve because capitalism is bad or because Winston Churchill was a racist?

Also, Russia in 1917 was poor. It makes more sense to compare it too other poor nations in Asia, Africa or South America, places where I suspect you would not find a famine to be remarkable or claim it to be caused by the capitalist economic system. 

It's worth noting that the relative prosperity enjoyed by the 'free world' is built on the poverty and suffering of the global south.

quotes from various confederate state's declarations of successon:

Georgia

>The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.

Mississippi

>Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. 

South Carolina


>The same article of the Constitution stipulates also for rendition by the several States of fugitives from justice from the other States.

>The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.

Texas

>Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.

Virginia

>The people of Virginia, in their ratification of the Constitution of the United States of America, adopted by them in Convention on the twenty-fifth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, having declared that the powers granted under the said Constitution were derived from the people of the United States, and might be resumed whensoever the same should be perverted to their injury and oppression; and the Federal Government, having perverted said powers, not only to the injury of the people of Virginia, but to the oppression of the Southern Slaveholding States.

>A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  

Since the right exists explicitly to prevent tyranny I don't thank making it about crime is helpful. Many people may just (correctly) think that they are extremely unlikely to be victim of a violent crime and don't worry about it?"

You are right about Star Trek, we are never going to get to post-scarcity space communism without staying armed."

Also JFK theories are plausible, there's alot of weird shit happened around that event. Moon landing consipracy is crap I agree. 911? Who knows. CIA/military-industral-complex certainly got everything they wanted from it. After Epstein's death I'm ready to believe alot is plausible."
