DarlingInTheFranxx,ffhebes,t1_ff9obyn,1579931746.0,"I'm not sure you're right. I've been friendzoned, unfriendzoned, refriendzoned, and then hated by a girl before."

StarVStheForcesofEvil,fe8u64z,t1_fe8u3mt,1578930927.0,I think that's how she dumped him.

stevenuniverse,fdif340,t3_elc4ve,1578441462.0,The Americans who think people should move out at 18 are stuck in the past when minimum wage was enough to live off of. I'm 97% certain that most of america doesn't agree with that any more.
wholesomememes,fdiajii,t1_fdhltfe,1578438704.0,"If that is how you get a girlfriend, then I'd never be single as I have plenty of hoodies. Actually thinking on that a little more, no amount of hoodies could work that miracle."
