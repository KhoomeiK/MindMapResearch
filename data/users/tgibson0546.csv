So yeah back in May, May 21st at 6:42 am to be very specific, I  was in a really really bad car accident...& I SHOULD HAVE listened to my gut & didn‚Äôt...so I work third shift in a factory, it was my 2nd week back on third shift and I got off work and was dead tired. Gas light on, needed some rillos, was even thirsty...I usually stop at the gas station by my work but I decided against it, said I could wait till I got to the gas station closer to my house. I was sitting at the stop light and i thought to myself ‚Äúdamn I always stop watch some stupid shit happen cuz I didn‚Äôt‚Äù I drive maybe half a mile up the road (I‚Äôm on a main road) and a lady pulls off from a side road right in front of me and I hit her...ended up with a broken tibia and fibula and I now have a plate and 9 screws in my leg...I always think to myself why didn‚Äôt I stop? Was there something worse in store for me. I‚Äôm honestly lucky to be alive, I hit her doing about 60 mph without my seatbelt on...so the fact that the accident didn‚Äôt kill me (easily could have). I learned a lot from my trauma and healing process so I guess everything really happens for a reason as cliche as it sounds. I needed to be sat down, and have my strength tested but I always listen to my gut now."
