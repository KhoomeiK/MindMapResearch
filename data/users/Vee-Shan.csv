AmItheAsshole,ffjhsbq,t3_ettdbn,1579998509.0,"NTA. I agree with a lot of the comments leaning towards breaking up with her. If you want to try and stick it out you can be blunt with her and explain that these crying fits are childish and that you want to date a mature woman. A woman that can have a discussion without resorting to tears to get her way. If she can't have normal mature conversations about plans, food, trips, etc then she's obviously 12 years old and you need to move on. Good luck!"

trashy,ffadz02,t3_es06zv,1579733345.0,"I know Sysco food services would demand that their regional reps get a new vehicle every 2 years. My step father was one of those reps in interior BC, Canada. I recall my mother complaining at the astronomical costs that were incurring over the years and how the allowance for the new vehicles was diminishing over the years as well. He would get around $6,000 for the first couple of vehicles then new management came in and it went down every time. From $6k to $4k to $2k and nothing. They still demanded the new vehicles though. Now, my step dad started there when I was 10 years old and worked there for over 20 years. That's at least 10 new vehicles in 20 years. To me that's insane. I remember visiting when I was 12 and being told that they were selling off 2 of their vehicles. My mom had this old Volkswagen Rabbit and my stepdad had this 1950's Valiant. They were hoping to work on the Valiant and teach me to drive on it and gift it to me,but they couldn't keep it. Basically from that point on they would rotate vehicles and sell off one. My stepdad would get a new one, my mom would get his previous one and they'd sell off the oldest. I can't exactly recall when new management came in, but it was at least 10 years into his time there. That's when the allowance started dropping but the amount of territory and sales he had to make skyrocketed. His area doubled and then tripled as they fired older staff members. Also, any maintenance that had to be done was out of pocket. When you drive on highways in the middle of the wilderness you will probably hit something. He had hit several deer and one moose. The costs varied but the moose nearly totaled that truck.

One I remember, from years back, had me laughing so much that I didn't want it to end. In my dream I was working at a shoe store. A shipment came in and the goal was to get them all out on the shelves. I go to deliver a cart of shoes to a coworker and notice that they are all band members of Dethklok (Metalacolypse). Skizgar and Toki were arguing over where to place shoes. There were a lot of ""Stops copies me!"" ""No. You stops copies me!"". Murderface was standing at the end of an isle with his belly in his hands saying ""Well I'm the fat one!"". Nathan was standing mid isle, a shoe in each hand, just looking from one to the other in confusion. When suddenly... Nathan yells out in his growly voice ""GUYS! Shut up. We're here to help Vee-Shan!"". It was so on point with their characters in the show that I laughed my ass off.

insaneparents,fezfup0,t1_feymedi,1579456874.0,"I nearly got fired for going to my grandmother's funeral. My direct manager was on vacation, so I couldn't talk to her to work out a switch in schedule to attend the funeral. So I went to the other managers and explained the situation and offered to switch days with people if it meant that I could have two days off in a row. I was working 5 days a week but they were short shifts. 5-6 hours. Switching days around helped out myself and another rep. This was approved by several other managers (think big box store with managers for each department) and off I went to catch a flight and join my family. I left in the morning, spent the night with family, went to the funeral the next morning and back on a flight that evening. I went back to work the next morning for 7 days in a row. A couple of days in and my manager got back from vacation. Her first reaction to seeing the schedule changes? To lose her shit and demand to know how and why it was approved. Other reps and managers explained what happened. She pulled me off the floor (I was a cashier) and berated me for going behind her back to change the schedule without her permission. She wrote me up and threatened to fire me if anything like this ever happened again. When I explained the funeral and the fact that there was no way to contact her on vacation she told me she didn't care about any of it. I was bawling my eyes out. I was very close to my grandmother and I was only able to spend very little time mourning her before having this happen. My manager went from ripping me apart to bragging about her vacation, even giving me this stupid key chain thing. The other managers were appalled and tried to comfort me or send me home but my manager made me work the rest of my shift. A week later my manager cut my hours down to 12 a week and loaded the extra hours onto reps that were fulltime students. The other reps tried to trade some of their hours to me and she shut them down. Telling them that I wasn't knowledgeable enough to take on their responsibilities. I was actually taking management training in my own time and volunteering to help other departments. I also trained all seasonal and new staff in cash, customer service, etc. So I attempted a transfer to another department. The department was eager to have me but my manager denied the transfer. She was super condescending about the whole thing. Telling me she was just doing it to save me since I wouldn't be allowed back if I failed. She made comments about my clothes, mothering me while bad mouthing my own mother and more inappropriate things. She did this in front of staff, managers and customers.

I got my revenge though. I applied for a job with another company and was hired. They wanted me to start training at the beginning of the next week. It was Thursday, which meant that I couldn't give two weeks notice. I went to the general manager and explained the situation and that wouldn't be able to give two weeks notice. I apologized and asked what he would need to make this happen as easily as possible. He was genuinely happy for me and explained that he just needed a written letter of resignation. Great. I wrote it on the spot and asked if it would be alright if it was immediate as of the end of my shift (meaning I didn't work Friday-Saturday). He agreed. Well, my manager decided she didn't accept those terms and handed out the new schedules. Lo and behold I'm scheduled for 36 hours in the next 2 weeks. I handed the schedule back and told her I won't be here after the current shift and my letter of resignation was already accepted by the General Manager. She went off on me. Telling me that she owns me and that she doesn't care if I was given approval for immediate resignation. She's the manager and she demands two weeks notice. This was all at the till... At the entrance of the store.. In front of customers and staff. I had to call the GM and ask him to please explain the situation and my approval for immediate resignation. She was escorted to the back room for a 'chat' and I barely saw her for the rest of my shift. When I did see her she'd be glaring or fishing for sympathy from a couple of reps on our team. Word spread quickly and I had a couple dozen staff members come up and congratulate me on my new job. The GM came up to me as I was preparing to leave and asked me to come back in 6 months and tell him what I think of the store.

I found out later that my manager was let go as a corporate change over and she moved to Puerto Rico. For years after leaving I could walk into that store and run into people I trained that would speak highly of me to the newer reps. I found out later that one of my coworkers in my department was extremely jealous of my interactions with staff/customers and decided to bad mouth me to my manager. Making up rumours, putting the idea that I knew nothing in the manager's head,how I was wasting time, etc. Meanwhile I had done everything needed for my department and was so bored that I had been helping other departments as well. Even taking on some administrative and slight managerial tasks. She didn't like that and tried to take me down. I wish that I'd had the chance to tell her off.

DestinyTheGame,fdy5pam,t3_en7ru1,1578776386.0,"Every season and expansion has its up's and downs. It will always happen and you can't please everyone. The unifying complaint that I've heard through most of these posts is the time constraints, fear of missing out, the pressure to complete tasks but also fighting an over all sense of stagnation. The cost of Eververse items is high, the ability to acquire bright dust is low. The extreme amount of bugs and glitches that aren't being addressed.

My main concern is that seasons starting with Undying have had a huge pressure to complete tasks or you will miss out on content. Personally this is a big issue for me. I will walk away from the game for days, weeks, months at a time and the new seasons don't allow for this. Frankly speaking, Destiny is a video game and not a full time job. There needs to be balance and the ability to enjoy the game at a more realistic pace. I've seen so many of the long time players just stop playing altogether over throwing themselves into this pace and not accomplish anything that they feel is worth while.

There are many things that have changed for the better or worse, but there's an overall sense of frustration and fatigue in the player base that should be addressed. I gloss over most of the posts that state one particular season was better than the rest and such. I focus on the common threads that I've experienced myself. I've been tempted to make a post myself but I'd want to be thorough and unbiased as possible. Just sticking to observations and possible changes that can be made to help the player base.

The first one I was introduced to was a remote point to point ISP. I noticed on Master accounts that they would list all the equipment on a single page. That makes it easier to view the status of all the equipment right? Nope. The system had a bug. Once you loaded the information for one piece of equipment it would show the same results for all other equipment looked at. You had to individually load each account in its own page for proper results. I tested it many times and then passed on the information to senior staff and the trainer. It was promptly ignored. Well, I noticed other reps loading all the accounts from a single page and getting positive results, so they were under the impression that all was well. Customers would then call back to complain about the services at a specific location and again the reps were getting positive results. Finally the senior rep/trainer received one of these calls and got the same results. I suggested loading the specific account in its own page and sure enough the equipment was offline. I showed him the bug in the system and mentioned the email I sent him. He shrugs and says ""Oh that. I thought you were lying."" I was flabbergasted. I attempted to point out other things going forward, things that the Contracts themselves were aware of, and I was outright ignored or received the ""I thought you were making it up"" treatment.

Thankfully some were completely oblivious to the flirtation and would ask if there was something that they could help with and disengage. Others weren't so lucky though and I've had to page them or ask them for help. I believe that there's this bias that only women get this creepy treatment but it happens to everyone. Honestly, I'd be wary of anyone in the service industry that flirts back to customers. I've run into a few employees that used the customer base as a dating pool and it's unethical and scummy."

AmItheAsshole,fdm6nav,t3_elw66e,1578541093.0,"NTA - First off giving her access to your WiFi is Not a good idea. A lot of devices are discoverable and share information. She could be going through private conversations, pictures, videos etc. Anything done on your connection is under your name. She could be giving out your password as well. If you have data caps you are on the hook (I've seen this sooo many times). Copyright notifications for torrenting, accessing illegal content, etc. This is all besides the lack of payment. I would set up parental controls for any devices outside your own till you've had a conversation about revoking access. And I would revoke it.

As far as the laundry thing, she's inconsiderate. As long as it's not a repeating issue I'd ignore it. Her behaviour towards your boyfriend makes me pause. I'm not sure what to say about it but I don't like it. Honestly, I'd convince your boyfriend to switch the password and ask him to tell her. I feel like she may try to make you out to be the bad guy more if you do it.

Good luck. Hopefully it works out."

That isn't an invitation to take it as flirting. Take it from someone who has had to personally deal with this countless times. You flirt with staff, they are going to laugh it off and change the subject. If you keep this up you are basically holding the person hostage. I can't even tell you how many times some random customer took me doing my job as more than it was.

DestinyTheGame,fd07hwh,t3_ejo4i3,1578114785.0,"You hit the nail on the head. I have been an avid Destiny player since D1 beta. Back when you had to go digging to find the real lore. I stuck it through. Why? I absolutely loved the universe, the gameplay, the ability to EARN my way through the game. Everything feels stagnant now, yet rushed at the same time. There's a lack of progression and feeling of accomplishment. On top of that, these season only achievements and activities are really something that I absolutely Hate. The previous seasons to Opulence all had aspects that have stuck around and I still enjoy. Now certain things and items only appear during the season and then poof. For a game that I've brought people to, sherpa'd through and gushed about... I can't do it anymore. I have seen most of my clan members just disappear. Life happens, but that's not why.

Actually, on the topic of life. I used to be able to step away from Destiny for important reasons. These seasons basically make it so you cannot step away without missing out. This is the biggest slap in the face to me. Time sensitive events and having to throw money at the game to get anything remotely nice looking and only on the single class. Don't forget that buying an ornament set is ONLY for that class you buy it on. Bright dust is so damn slow to come in and some things are 2500-6000 bright dust. Oh and I have two accounts since I had the game for PC and PS4 but I can't combine the accounts, so I can't culminate all my gear, emotes, achievements, etc on a single active account. I honestly feel genuinely cheated on many fronts. Especially since I spent money for everything TWICE. Collectors editions, season passes, expansions, the works. With cross play I can at least bring my main account from PS4 to PC, but none of my progress from PC to my main account. 

Here's the thing. I still love Destiny, I will play it regardless. I wouldn't have minded spending money on the game and cosmetics... IF it went back to current gear/cosmetics in engrams. I don't like this fear of missing out bullshit. I don't want to feel pressured and under time constraints in a game that I play for fun. There's time trials and challenges for that. Not entire seasons and activities that should become part of the game, period. I feel like this shift is going to cause long term players to leave as new players come in. Those who have been extremely loyal and understanding aren't going to stick around. It's a damn shame honestly. I really love Destiny."

AskReddit,fco8vjr,t3_ei21zo,1577826387.0,"I have a few. 

- I was babysitting my younger siblings and a couple of neighbourhood boys.  We were in a field with trees mixed throughout. Their father came to take them home. I was wearing this silly cheap ring that would change colours depending on the angle you looked at it. The father is talking away, spots the ring and asks what kind of ring it is. I tell him that it's called a fantasy ring and he gets giddy and says ""I have a fantasy. I want you to rub my butt"". I noped the fuck out. Took my sisters home and told my mother about it. My sisters weren't allowed to play at their house or without supervision after that.


- Early 2000's I was playing Everquest. There was a married couple in our guild that were super nice and I got along with both of them quite well. One night the wife is playing while extremely intoxicated. She starts talking about finding my character attractive and that our characters should get it on. We're both female in game and real life. I cracked some jokes about how drunk she was but she just kept going. Then she blurts out that she wants to have sex with a dragon. Not just in game, but in real life as well. She went on and on and on. Her husband had to log her off and apologized profusely. They didn't talk to me much after that...


- Same guild in Everquest and the same year. One of my favourite people was a gay man living in the southern states. He tells us a story about his previous roommates eating his food and ylying about it. He'd had enough and bought some cucumbers. He took them home, lubed them, shoved them up his ass and then put them in the fridge without washing. A couple of days later he gets home to find that his roommates had used the cucumbers for sandwiches and such. He asked them where the cucumbers had gone and they fessed up to eating them. He then asked how they had tasted after being covered in Ky and shoved up his ass. Apparently they puked and moved out after that. He was so damn proud. We were all flabbergasted and vowed never to fuck with him. Still one of my favourite people to this day. Unfortunately he was very ill and suffered through hurricane Katrina. I lost track of him many years ago and I hope he at least found a place to live comfortably."
offmychest,fcl8mv7,t3_ehobx5,1577742185.0,"I admire your convictions. I've wanted to call them myself on multiple occasions while I was growing up. Not for me, for my aunt and then for this crazy lady that tried to be my mother for years. I was young though, teens, and begged my father to call protective services on the crazy lady. He was obsessed with her and refused. She had 4 kids with 4 different guys. Neglected the kids, got drunk and high... My dad kept making excuses instead of seeing the dangers. I would stand up to him when he'd start stealing my meager belongings to flatter the crazy lady and turned violent against me when I refused to stand in line. I had a friend call protective services on my behalf. The cops showed up, he charmed them and then he told me that they'd never believe a word I say and not to bother getting them involved again... Or else. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's never easy to call CPS. Stick to your guns and hold strong. The adults here have made their choices, the kids don't have a choice."
quityourbullshit,fckv3c8,t1_fck0sld,1577733832.0,"This is especially true for the email scams. Additionally, don't open emails that you may suspect are scams. I know this should be a no brainer but there's a specific style of email scam that has been circulating for nearly 2 years that imbeds a pixel into the header or footer of the email and relays whether you have opened the email at all. It's a 1x1 pixel object called a tracking pixel. I've had many customers who opened the scam email (usually Sexploitation) and been added to hundreds of mailing lists. It affects mostly those using older style/ISP provided email accounts that don't have the goliath spam filters that providers like Google and Microsoft have.
