As a volunteer in EMS, we avoid putting our health or safety at risk, too. One of the \*first\* things taught in school which we routinely emphasize is to evaluate scene safety. If it isn't safe for us, we get out and call in the appropriate resources. When you see TV footage of people ""standing around"" instead of rescuing people who are in danger, it's likely because they are calling in specialty resources who are trained and equipped to specific hazards.

Ultimately, the biggest risk to EMS is back injuries from having to lift and move overweight people. We can call in extra people to help lift, but you can only have a small number of people carrying a patient down a narrow flight of stairs.

ems,ff6tu0l,t3_ero5sq,1579634750.0,"In general, the amount of exposure we will perform will be related to how much benefit we think it will provide. Most patients we encounter are low acuity. In these cases the only thing I'll need to expose is enough of an arm (preferably) to be able to get a blood pressure cuff on to check blood pressure. I can do this well-enough through simple shirt material, but sweatshirts and sweaters might be a problem. Otherwise, you're welcome to be wearing a parka for all it matters.

The next level up is performing a 12-lead EKG. This involves putting several electrode stickers connected to wires on the patient's chest. If the patient is female and I have a female partner I'll have my partner apply the electrodes. In all cases, once applied I'm going to cover the patient up as much as I possibly can.

Then you get up to the high-acuity cases. These are the torso gunshots, run-over-by-car, or found-unresponsive-in-alley types where you have \*no\* idea what's going on and you need to quickly identify the major life threats (to fix immediately) and the broader categories of injury (to have specialists standing by at the hospital). In these cases I'll try to quickly move the patient to the back of the ambulance where there is privacy and perform a full rapid trauma exam. Doctors get cranky if you miss a knife sticking out of a critical patient or an arterial bleed. Then I will cover up the patient as much as possible. Not just for modesty, but because patients can lose a lot of body heat which screws up with clotting and other things.

At the hospital, the process will be similar. Trivial cases probably won't even have a shirt removed. Most cases will have the patient change into a gown, privately if safe to do so. And major/trauma patients are going to get stripped because that's the standard of care. But once examined, patients will again be covered up for comfort and modesty."

* The efficiency of the fuel-to-mileage is much higher because power plants get efficiencies of scale, and electric driving provides for regenerative breaking.
* The batteries themselves are surprisingly toxic to manufacture due to initial material mining and refining. However, the core materials can be recycled almost indefinitely. And as long as they are well-designed, they may last longer than the life of the vehicle itself.
* They allow the use of (and improved financial viability of) environmentally-friendly power sources such as wind, hydro, and nuclear.
* Even if a dirty power source is used, it allows the power generation to be moved outside of highly-populated areas. So you can have a coal power plant in a rural area hundreds of miles away from rush-hour traffic.
