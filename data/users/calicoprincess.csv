Albuquerque,fgfue70,t1_fgftdna,1580747822.0,"That’s good to know!  I’ve just heard the bad stuff, lack of specialists and long waiting lists, substandard primary docs.  I thought the hospitals in ABQ at least had good reputations.  Is there any concern about the aging population getting the care they need?"
Albuquerque,fgfodmc,t3_ey5u6u,1580743927.0,"I would love to move to ABQ and it’s not even the crime that would scare me off, it’s the lack of good health care.  I’ve heard it’s just not very good or accessible there."

pharmacy,fe4ci93,t1_fe2pjad,1578857851.0,"I’m in a similar situation.  I  think I remember your post from last summer and was a little envious because I wanted to quit my job too!   But then was let go in October so a blessing in disguise.  I’ve been looking at any and all local jobs to see if I can fathom doing anything else and luckily don’t have to be the main breadwinner.   I honestly don’t care if I ever work in pharmacy again.

He started to get hoarse after an hour and a half and gave up and had no more meow left.  Poor guy."
