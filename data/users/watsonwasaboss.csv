This will help lay down a middle ground in a neutral area so no one kids included feel attacked in any way shape or form and it is a safe space for everyone to get their feelings out.

Also couples counseling for you and your fiancee you two need to work on being an united front and work on house rules for the kids. While he feels bad and will let the kids slide on things because he does not see then- that has to stop (been then, done that and I put a stop to it) 

There has to be a constant set of rules for your house and consequences. Sit down and have a clean conversation with the children, explain the problems you see, the new rules, and the new consequences that are in place.

Explain that you understand that it is hard to have to live by two set of rules at such a young age but think of it as having a set if school behavior and house behavior...just two different houses.

Please also think of their feelings this is just as hard for them as it is for you. This is going to take time, patience (alot of patience) and work from everyone. Dad will have to be on board.

Your feelings are valid and important.
Try the family counseling it helped us blend a family of now 5 teenagers lol."
