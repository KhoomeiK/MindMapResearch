IncelTears,ffiyikr,t1_ffisvod,1579985856.0,"What if the girls you are attracted to are not attracted to you?  What if there was a whole world out there of women that wanted to be with you but looked outside of what you are attracted to?  I’m new around here, but have common across many family members with this same thought.  It’s all about what YOU want, what YOU desire, what YOU are attracted to.  But it takes two.  The other person also has to want the same thing.  Maybe, just maybe, you need to re evaluate your approach as well as your standards."
femalefashionadvice,ffg9fhb,t3_etdphu,1579901314.0,"Early aughts were a great time style wise.  Denim spaghetti string body con dresses, denim belted dresses, old navy demin trench in dark wash and Medium wash, demin mini skirt, demin pencil skirt, demin max skirt with slit in front so you can see my knee high chunky Heeled leather Boots.  Boot cut demin both with strategic holes and no holes with Bandana shirt or other completely open back shirts.  What a time to be alive if you love demin."

xxfitness,feexpof,t3_eoje45,1579043496.0,All I want to do is workout in peace.  Why must this guy run a personal CrossFit class at the ymca?  Why must he huff and puff all over the small weight room and then get made when someone else wants to use a piece of equipment?  Why must you flip your sweaty hair everywhere as you huff and puff in a circle?  Why must you use two bench press stations one to bench press and the other to have your dumbbell close by for your insane complex
WeightLossAdvice,fec3han,t3_eod2pr,1578966104.0,"It is hard to hold on, especially since sometimes you don’t see results quickly.  It’s easy to say to hold on and that you didn’t gain the weight overnight but it doesn’t make it easier to have patience and go through the process."
femalefashionadvice,fea9uk5,t1_fe9ygln,1578946073.0,"I have a similar waist to hip ratio and a true hourglass.  I have found that straight leg trousers fit the best, especially if they skim my thighs and fall straight down my legs. 

I also embrace bodycon dresses that pull double duty as tops.  

The way I see, I have lots of curves.  When I can, I make sure to buy clothing that curves around my body."
fatlogic,fdw10gh,t1_fdvibkr,1578753929.0,So are we to assume this person worships Lizzo?
fatlogic,fdok6ng,t1_fdocq0k,1578606795.0,"I got as far as you did.  I can’t believe they published this ridiculous “article”.  Everyone is healthy, until they are not.  Obesity, in my opinion, is a degenerative condition.  At 27, my obesity didn’t cause any problems but 10 years later, I started to have obesity related problem.  If we wanted to talk about this, we should be talking about the cost of emotional eating as a result of sexism/ racism."

femalefashionadvice,fcuhz6r,t3_eiyo2m,1577981404.0,Question.   I love the look of a short empire waist dress.  There is a navy one free people has and it beautiful.  The problem is that I am a large hourglass shape and when I try to wear these flowy dresses I look boxy and pregnant.  Any ideas of what I can do to wear these dresses?
muacjdiscussion,fclqmbc,t1_fclox4q,1577754090.0,Thanks!  I did get Lancome lipstick in pigeon blood.  I think it works very well :). I’ll check out her video though.
muacjdiscussion,fclnzzv,t3_ehss2d,1577752291.0,"In 2020 I will wear bright red lipsticks that is flattering on me.  Growing up, I’ve alway been told that deeper toned women shouldn’t wear brighter lipsticks, especially red lipsticks.  Just a few years ago, a few artist have expressed similar views. And it hurts to think that I never explored a part of my femininity just because of my skin color.  I want to wear a classic red And I will in 2020.  I’m really trying to break away from a lot dumb ideas I’ve held onto because I don’t want to bring these attitudes into the new decade and have them influence my kids."

It’s truly a pet peeve of mine when something is called “nude” but can’t be nude for more than a small segment people.  Just call it something else..."
