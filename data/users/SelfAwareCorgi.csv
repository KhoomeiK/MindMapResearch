Edit: What the hell, it's funny. I'll slink off with my digicam asthma inhaler and milspec pollen allergy tabs now."
JustBootThings,fc9aj0y,t1_fc98ihj,1577549674.0,"I don't know. I don't lock up. My mind isn't racing with a million possibilities. Or whatever happens to freezers. When I recognize the danger, I do react in whichever manner I deem most helpful.

My pulse is pretty close to baseline, which I know with some certainty. I was once in a car crash that required the paramedics to get out the jaws of life. There was pretty much nothing beneficial I could do, so I sat there, replied to questions in a normal tone, but otherwise remained calm. It seemed like giving the professionals peace and quiet for their work would be best, but they kept checking if I'd gone into shock. Eventually I started chatting with them more, since that seemed to make them less focused on checking my pulse and more so on helping me get out of the car.

Had there been anything else I could do, I would naturally have done that."

JustBootThings,fc91hfo,t1_fc8x3fm,1577545496.0,"That's honestly pretty funny. While I don't have the same issues as the woman in the article, I have virtually no fight or flight instinct, and you're not wrong about your assessment. I've noticed it takes longer for me to recognize danger and decide on a course of action, and there's no way I'd be able to do any of those incredible adrenaline moves that you sometimes see.

It's not all bad. Sometimes dangerous situations are best solved by a cool head and rational thought. I'd have made a terrible soldier, but possibly a good paramedic."
TrueOffMyChest,fc8xvvi,t1_fc7x72s,1577543846.0,"I don't doubt your experiences in the least. Personally I'd find both you and OP's heights rather attractive in each their own way.

I don't mean to act thirsty; just urging you to hang in there and try not to think too much about the bullies."
TrueOffMyChest,fc8vyax,t1_fc8cl49,1577542899.0,I hope you two do end up talking. I absolutely think you should both pursue this.
TrueOffMyChest,fc8uuh0,t3_ego7n0,1577542357.0,"I guess this might be a little trashy as a response to a post about the trials of being short as well as the depression it has resulted in, but hey. Let me assure you that I would absolutely find someone your height attractive. I personally find it very feminine.

I do caution you against becoming too bitter or aggressive, because it's a very understandable reaction to being treated poorly by society. Unfortunately it also ruins the few chances for happiness that do arise throughout one's life.

It's easier said than done. The best of luck to you."
TrueOffMyChest,fc8gq37,t3_egnhmh,1577534534.0,"You're asocial, not antisocial. Antisocial pretty much does imply ""evil."" It's people that may be disruptive or outright destructive to the social order. At their nicest, there's still an absense of empathy, and while they may not necessarily harm you, it will be due to the potential consequences being perceived as greater than the perceived benefit.

So, that's sort of an important difference, particularly to people like you, who fall into the first category."
todayilearned,fc727xe,t1_fc6y3h3,1577495581.0,"The consumers buy the cans in a store, and can generally return the used cans to any grocery store. The company doesn't get the deposit, even if it isn't returned to the consumers (as 99% of the cans are). You are correct that the companies then get nice, clean aluminum to start the process over again.
The more trash needs to be sorted, the more expensive the process will be. Why should people pay extra for other people's refusal to sort their garbage?
The system obviously works. Less virgin material is required. People are probably OK with having to bring a bag of cans once a month.
Contrast this with the UK's no deposit system (at the time), where 72% of cans were recycled in the same period. That's probably as far as you'll go on sheer good intentions.
The reason much of Europe is so ""green"" is that nobody is exempt from it. Consumers, companies, government."
todayilearned,fc6xmb0,t1_fc6w1m0,1577492119.0,"Assuming you return your bottles and cans, you're not paying anything extra. If you discard them instead, you're paying for someone to pick them up and bring them to a store."
todayilearned,fc6vtk4,t1_fc6v6qy,1577490797.0,"People do.

Going by 2018 figures, only 1%-3% of non-reusable bottles were not returned in Germany; recycling rates for cans were around 99%."

TrueOffMyChest,fc568z1,t1_fc54m6i,1577445345.0,"Well, people with kids *are* happier than those without. Once those kids move out.

For the 18-30 years before the kids move, people without kids are happier. Somehow."
