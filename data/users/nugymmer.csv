But if you hang on to that crypto, you may well end up making out like a bandit if it does another major ramp up like it did in 2017. Crypto are 4 year cycles from memory, so our next major bubble is scheduled for 2021. That's next year. Hang on until then and see how it goes. You've got nothing to lose since you got in before Xmas 2017 and if you sell now you sell at a loss. At least wait until breakeven, and it will happen."
AskReddit,ffh6pjz,t1_ffg7bit,1579924635.0,"Sorry but I'm going to call you wrong on this. It might have been STUPENDOUSLY lucrative if you got in 10 years ago...hell, even fucking 5 years ago would have been seriously lucrative. But only a VERY small number of good cryptos (eg. Ethereum, Monero, DASH and a few others).

I think there's at least another massive boom cycle in the crypto market. And perhaps another one after that in 2025.

Then I registered via Facebook. Now I just get a completely dead page telling me about how they no longer record data from JJJ but that tells me nothing about where the existing data is. Where is it? Who hosts it? How can I access that? I want stuff from January 2012 and cannot find it anywhere else obviously."

Why won't they at least put some vanilla in? It just has no flavor at all.

And ice cream in Australia is mostly ice confection. Basically frozen lolly milk."

Back before it became illegal here, I used to take it, and the comedown lasted a few days. Depression like symptoms and anxiety. I would get angry for silly reasons and would lose my cool.

australia,ff8hxpw,t3_erc6yr,1579679282.0,"Yesterday I felt the same way about vaping. I've done it hardcore since late 2015.

In March 2016 after a panic attack caused by a nic OD, I quit.

In October 2016 I started again.

It wasn't until August 2018 that I decided to give it the flick. This time coming off was painful. But I figured it had to happen or I'd be stuck being a puff puff billy boy.

In December 2018 I was with a mate who was vaping. I started again. LOL. I thought I'd given up but nope.

Gave up again in late May 2019 whilst suffering a nasty dose of the flu. Coming off was painful, and things were happening that were increasing my anxiety but I stood firm.

On Wednesday night two weeks ago I started up again, but then stopped on the following Thursday.

Then started up again two days ago. Yesterday I decided I'd had enough of the tiredness and fatigue of being nicced up all the time. Gave it the flick.

How long will this last? I have no idea. Might be weeks, months, or years.

Abortiondebate,ff5jctr,t3_elny8a,1579595597.0,"This may be a great argument. However, governments most certainly don't grant us complete bodily autonomy.

Three perfect examples, and they are perfect because they literally embody the bodily autonomy argument in a literal sense.

1/ the government still has the right to tell you that you can't use cannabis (which is less harmful and dangerous than alcohol or cigarettes). The government can literally destroy your life at gun point.

2/ you are not allowed to end your own life on your own terms, in many cases even if you have a terrible life-ending illness that destroys every last inch of your dignity. The government in this case would rather you lay dying in your excrement whilst being pumped full of opioid painkillers.

3/ infant circumcision is still routinely practiced in the USA. This, in spite of the fact that the abortion debate was more or less done with nearly 50 years ago. Infant circumcision has marginal health benefits at best, and these same benefits could also apply to females since they suffer from much higher UTI rates than do males, circumcised or not!!! Not to mention that strapping a screaming infant onto a cold restraint and hacking away at their genitals smacks of a *serious* human rights abuse."

If abortions were free and nobody could profit from them, I do wonder how many service providers there would be? My guess is there would still be several providers, but depending on how much funding they get from external sources, the quality of service would possibly be inferior."

I would think of it like getting a bad dose of the flu. Took me about a month to feel ""normal"" again. Well I'm still not 100%, maybe 90% but it did give me a stupid amount of anger for at least a few hours. Wow I don't think I've ever felt so mad in all of my life."
