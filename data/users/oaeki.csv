Realizing that our feelings can occur independently of our circumstances or events. 

We have come so far, and every waking moment we have next should be a new opportunity for appreciating what we have, and to also be excited for the challenges and adversities that await us in the face of achieving our goals.

I hope you further your spiritual awakening. Thank you for sharing your thoughts."
depression,fenk3ma,t3_epzjky,1579286396.0,"Have you maybe considered that there /is/ nothing wrong with you? That suffering, pain and misery is a vital part of the human existence and there's no escaping the fact that no matter how much you achieve, or how much you have substantially improved- you will continually at different periods of your life, feel sad, hopeless, empty and depressed?

Have you ever tried to sit with the feeling of sadness? To allow yourself to cry and recognize that crying isn't a form or expression of weakness? It is just a way to express emotions that we feel burdened from, and it is completely normal to feel empty.

Edit: because in this universe, feeling empty and fulfilled are two sides of the same coin. However we have MANY influences in society that cause us to continually focus on what we lack rather than promoting how to feel whole and satisfied with what we have.. (otherwise capitalism probably wouldn't be able to thrive)

 so maybe

- try to sit in silence and think of all the things you can be grateful for. The more you practice gratitude, the stronger the ability to snap from feeling empty to feeling fulfilled and whole by what you have to be grateful for.

And by no means is this an easy task. I think one of the hardest and most courageous things one can do is to sit with oneself, to explore the depths of our own misery created by the mind."

offmychest,femar2n,t1_fem962p,1579246321.0,"I mean this in the most sincerest way possible, that your observations are so poetic and beautiful. You are very perceptive and insightful, which means you have a lot of potential to share.

Have you considered that your perception of being so incredibly insignificant towards others in your life, is a reflection based of your own lack of self compassion towards putting effort to fulfill yourself individually?

 The way I understand it is that you want to be recognized by those you care about (and of course, don't we all? We're only human anyway) and while there's no fault to that, im suggesting maybe you're looking in the wrong place. 

I think you'll feel as if you belong to a role among others, when you start treating yourself the way you wish to be treated. Like as a friend. Would you ever tell someone you care about/a friend, ""wow you're so insignificant""?

Edit: let alone, ""why would anyone choose you? You're a tarnished penny to begin with"". I mean, that's a really mean thing to say to someone that you should care about. 

I know you might feel ugly, but you have the potential to be as beautiful/handsome as you want to be. Be mindful of how you're speaking to yourself, because [self fulfilling prophecies are a thing](https://images.app.goo.gl/vz9YhCeQoYsN2vWG8)"
offmychest,fekwzly,t3_epndfj,1579209337.0,"Yeah, life is hard. If you want it to be easy, you gotta do the hard shit. Consequently, if you only do the easy things in life, then life will be hard.

As the saying goes, you can either be life's bitch (seeing yourself as a victim), or you can make life your bitch (construct the reality you hope to achieve).

I would say that from an outsiders perspective, it sounds like self compassion is something you could practice more a bit every day. A simple exercise you could begin with is asking yourself the next time you feel like trash, would you ever tell someone you loved or cared about ""you seem like trash today""? 

Treat yourself the way you expect those who care about you, should treat you."
offmychest,fekwc8b,t1_fektojy,1579208951.0,"Suffering, pain and misery exists in this lifetime. We can never be without suffering, just as how we can never be without a problem free life.

What's key is that happiness comes from enduring what we suffer from (how we overcome and persist from our problems) *credit to mark manson"
relationships,fa0eggq,t1_fa0a7sz,1575753826.0,"Because OP said it himself? That the problem is that their friends think he's being abusive for accepting her crying?

 It doesn't to seem to have negatively impaired his wife nor himself seeing as how they're adults that are stable enough for jobs and to live 'normal lives' etc. Maybe all that needs to happen is clear communication between them and their friends for his wife to say ""hey, honestly I am completely okay. my husband is not abusive towards me. I'm just more emotional than some people are comfortable with.""

I agree with other posts stated above, there's WAY more evidence to support the fact that OP's wife is not being problematic. What's problematic is their FRIEND'S PERCEPTION of THEIR RELATIONSHIP."
