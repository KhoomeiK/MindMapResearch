iamatotalpieceofshit,feiu6xb,t3_ep90zh,1579147318.0,"This woman is not in a good place.  She was the provider of her long marriage, the last decade of which he was having an affair.  This was found out about towards the end of her marriage and she defended her marriage and her husband.  Her husband welcomed a baby with his side chick soon after and Wendy started dating a guy half her age.  Call it karma for all the trouble her mouth has caused or whatever but she’s seemingly getting what she deserves."

Stay behind them but don’t tailgate and as soon as there is an opening to pass them on the right,  you have to go for it!  use ur blinker and all once ur doing it, but a red truck in Texas must never know ur motives!!"
