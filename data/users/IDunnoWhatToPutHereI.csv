couriersofreddit,ff95o0q,t1_ff94asx,1579705431.0,"It looked like a 10 minute drive to me, but I am not from your area."
doordash,ff95kr2,t1_ff930up,1579705368.0,"Yeah, I hate it too. I would love to start dashing at 8am or sometimes shave off an hour, but it won’t let me. So instead I have to sit and reject for an hour or schedule later than I would have liked."
wholesomememes,ff95a3l,t1_ff906qu,1579705171.0,Grown 9 yo female parent checking in. I cried too. Pewds is like a little brother to me. I loved him like a son.
grubhubdrivers,ff94cqe,t3_escc02,1579704542.0,Hahaha! It looks like they just don’t care anymore.
grubhubdrivers,ff9493i,t3_escuff,1579704471.0,I wipe mine out with disinfectant wipes once a week or as soon there is a spill. It seems to keep the inside nice. The outside looks pretty worn.
couriersofreddit,ff943wp,t1_ff8siok,1579704372.0,I wouldn’t take that. Too far for $9. That’s a $12 order if the restaurant is quick.

Really creepy. You need to put a stop to this behavior right now, OP."
grubhubdrivers,ff8ejl1,t3_es4do1,1579675125.0,My favorite part was when the Grubhub spokesperson stated they will fix any problems with the menu ASAP after being contacted by the restaurant. I laughed for a good 5 minutes.
doordash_drivers,ff8devn,t1_ff88do2,1579673868.0,Are you stalking me? Haha
doordash,ff8d8ls,t1_ff8c03s,1579673677.0,"Thanks, I think I needed to hear that (even though I knew it, but you know self doubt takes over). I am sure if it only took 1-2 customers claiming they did not get their food, there would be very few drivers on the road."

doordash,ff8aojv,t3_es3edf,1579671091.0,"I can answer the question on the no tip orders since I tip cash if I am dashing and ordering. Whenever it prompts you to rate the driver, it pressures you into leaving a tip. I ignore it because I tip in cash but it is pretty obvious if they leave a rating. I don’t remember what happens if you ignore leaving a rating."

doordash_drivers,ff87yh6,t3_es5w5b,1579668599.0,Most of it is good advice but I am not so sure about the parking backwards one. I have yet to see anyone who doesn’t take at least double the time to park backwards as they do forwards. Backing up is pretty easy (especially if you have a back up camera) and quick when leaving.
JustNoSO,ff7a1sm,t1_ff72rkk,1579644282.0,"I think it may come to that. I am holding out hope he gets his act together and we can coparent separately, but I think it may be false hope."
doordash,ff79w0i,t1_ff6rryp,1579644153.0,I don’t think I would gamble with that one.
couriersofreddit,ff6s3ah,t1_ff6ny7o,1579633716.0,The downside is that it makes it harder for the restaurant to find the order to prepare it. So be ready to cover for that.
doordash_drivers,ff6ah14,t1_ff5w7qu,1579622904.0,How much is it after?

aww,ff6991o,t1_ff65feo,1579622114.0,Birb knew this and tried to take the pen at the end.
doordash_drivers,ff690ik,t1_ff5w8cg,1579621964.0,Maybe anxious about how much they owe and want to budget now?
doordash,ff68twq,t3_errsjd,1579621844.0,Dogs don’t drink soda! I suspect you were bamboozled.
doordash_drivers,ff68kil,t3_ervafl,1579621675.0,Park near restaurants who get frequent orders. You should be one of the first to get it.
PewdiepieSubmissions,ff68cug,t1_ff66lcy,1579621534.0,We are an army!
doordash_drivers,ff680vt,t1_ff66fzc,1579621316.0,This explains so much! Thank you! I multiapp so most of my deliveries are with another app. I could not figure out why I would sometimes have early access and sometimes not.
PewdiepieSubmissions,ff67orp,t1_ff67946,1579621093.0,That’s not how that works.
doordash,ff67jn3,t1_ff5c4ha,1579620998.0,"And I totally get the 18 yo wanting a nice car. I was that at 18. Not to date myself but I still have that car in the garage on non op and the car will be 20yo in a few years. To be fair, my car at 16 was a POS. It overheated and left me stranded constantly. I did learn how to constantly add coolant and oil on the regular though."
doordash,ff679ih,t1_ff5c4ha,1579620808.0,Can you save up 1-2k and buy a beater to deliver in?
JustNoSO,ff671p4,t1_ff6691w,1579620663.0,"Oh! This is excellent news for me! I can’t afford to start a divorce yet because my JNex won’t give me anything to help support our daughter and I am barely scraping by. 

OP, your post is such an inspiration!"

doordash,ff5by72,t1_ff5b38u,1579586680.0,I wouldn’t use a car that’s worth much for this job.
doordash,ff5b189,t1_ff57nwx,1579585758.0,I paid about that for 6 months of commercial insurance. That is insane! I am also probably a bit older and have a clean record and drive a car that is worth under 2k.
doordash,ff36ek5,t1_ff204o8,1579534784.0,"More 0%. I hang out in the 0-10% range due to crappy offers, multiapping, not being able to remove time in the middle of a 12 hour shift so I have to keep rejecting in the middle of the day when I get my daughter from school, and probably another reason I can’t think of."
grubhubdrivers,ff35iqr,t1_ff2h04q,1579534171.0,"The restaurant that chewed me out told me that Grubhub had never contacted the owner about partnering and that was one of the issues. The owner likely would have partnered had they been asked. All this information comes from an employee, so take that into consideration."
grubhubdrivers,ff2eenu,t1_ff2b12p,1579502715.0,I had one chew me out and told me they turned the last driver away but we’re going to let me deliver this one this time. I passed it onto the customer. Restaurants don’t like being used without their consent. They also don’t like the bad reviews when something goes wrong beyond their control.
grubhubdrivers,ff2e83o,t1_ff2854g,1579502508.0,I find them to be quicker because of the ability to call them in.
grubhubdrivers,ff2e5rw,t1_ff28d6e,1579502437.0,This! I am getting tired of the menu being wrong and I think as time goes on it will just get worse.
doordash,ff1xcia,t1_ff1ofbb,1579488328.0,And they don’t care if it’s an OWYA either. Money is money and they want to make as much as they can.

doordash_drivers,fev4uae,t1_feulo9n,1579393100.0,"While I agree with you for most parts of America, there are some where the cost of living is pretty low and people would be satisfied with $10 an hour for an entry level position."
doordash_drivers,fev2y9f,t1_ferw16v,1579392562.0,"Not to mention the dasher is to leave it at the door, so what does it matter?"

doordash,femub64,t1_fem4nky,1579269796.0,Sneaky Doordash. They pulled that with me too. I was absolutely expecting it to go up.
grubhubdrivers,fel5345,t1_fekucy8,1579214239.0,I have 1 restaurant that always has the pick up time for 1-1.5 hours away. I have since learned that the order will be ready much sooner and to just go in. 14 minutes is nothing.
grubhubdrivers,fekabum,t3_eplzgb,1579195894.0,I’ve had customers tell me there is no where else to put the information.

doordash,fehopdx,t1_feh8pe7,1579120819.0,"Thanks, yes this is what I was looking for."
grubhubdrivers,feh9b53,t1_feh1isr,1579111823.0,"They are going to give out more stacked orders. Probably 3 at a time, 1 will be worth it and the other 2 will be trash but you can’t drop them anymore."
doordash,feh7oxp,t1_fegks55,1579110864.0,Is it $8.50 or $7.50? I have heard it both ways.
doordash,feg2dt4,t1_fefnogo,1579073925.0,How did that work out for you? I am guessing not too good.
funny,feg1wsh,t1_feg0cqx,1579073363.0,"Agreed. And now I am thinking about my hamstrings and how to strengthen them. But I know if it doesn’t fit into my daily routine, I am probably not doing it."
grubhubdrivers,feg13qk,t1_fefi4db,1579072432.0,"They deal with non tippers and rude customers. They don’t like it but they can’t tell who is going to tip when they walk in the door like we can. Of course they don’t have expenses like gas or wear and tear but they will just say it’s a part of the job and become jealous that you can. 

I tell the restaurant that the person ordering probably did not tip and that is the way we make anything. We are lucky if we break even with what GH pays us. I never mention that I just declined that order right before I accepted the current one. They ask me to take it and I joke that I could if they wanted but I can’t take it to the customer. It ends there and they appreciate my honesty and insight."
grubhubdrivers,feftang,t1_fefjxkb,1579064543.0,"If something is going on at the restaurant that will delay the food but the customer tipped well, you bet I am going to text them so they are aware of the situation. They almost always are thankful and I want the good tippers to continue to use Grubhub."
doordash,fefsbjx,t3_eoti8b,1579063724.0,I kept telling my bestie that I got paid to grind like in video games (I was more of an RPG player but I played a bit of GTA) this is exactly what I meant!
couriersofreddit,fefkskd,t1_feez3dc,1579058432.0,I am a woman so I highly doubt that! Hahaha!
doordash,fefkq5d,t1_fedj7rm,1579058391.0,"Grubhub, keep trying. But any of them, just to help fill in the gaps and in case one goes belly up/deactivates you. This job is so unstable and unknown so treat it as such."
doordash,fectlxu,t1_feck38v,1578984119.0,I recommend applying to one of the other apps just in case and because multiapping is profitable. I felt a lot of pressure lift from me when I had 2 apps. I was always afraid of losing my only source of income.
doordash,fectgni,t1_fecoifj,1578983956.0,"If this happens, I ask whomever I suspect is the customer to provide me with the customers name. They should know it if they ordered it. On rare occasions they may need another try because of nicknames or spouse or whatever but they should know it pretty quickly. 
I refused to give a person who was parked across the street an order (after knocking on the 3 doors of the large house and no one claiming the food) because they acted suspicious and could not provide me with the customers name. Doordash told me to take the food. That was h the only time I have taken the food on a Doordash delivery. There was no way to know where the food was supposed to go and I wasted like 20 minutes trying to find the customer."
couriersofreddit,fecsynh,t3_eof75o,1578983412.0,My favorite was simple but made my day. I was told by a Mother wrangling her kids that I was absolutely her favorite person at that time. Totally believable for a moment.
grubhubdrivers,fecsv5y,t1_fechdf6,1578983306.0,"Yes, that’s correct. I had thought it was only 1 block total."
grubhubdrivers,fechlwy,t1_febx19v,1578974116.0,I have had it both ways many times. I always check to make sure the addresses match up now.

AmItheAsshole,feavf2z,t1_fe9klhd,1578952560.0,I had the same thing happen at a KMart years ago. I was out of town and it was the only place in the tiny town to buy a bathing suit I desperately needed. I bought a 2 piece and a few other items. The clerk rang up half of the 2 piece and half of the items in general. It was about a $30 difference. I did not realize until I had gotten to the house we were visiting and immediately turned around to go pay the difference. The manager got upset with me!
doordash_drivers,feah5ov,t3_eo9ofv,1578948650.0,"You are an independent contractor. You can do whatever you want on the side. Which is why so many people can multiapp. If they decide to actually start employing their drivers, it may change."
relationship_advice,fe9wv11,t3_eo59fx,1578942188.0,"The only thing that will fix this is communication. She is pregnant, which already makes the thoughts run wild and now you are hiding things from her. 
Marriage is about being able to communicate with your partner. I think she thinks you were on a dating website and sexting with other women. Offer to go to couples therapy. She will think it’s because you have a problem, it’s ok to let her think this until the communication builds. You need to get on the same page about what you both are comfortable with and what is and isn’t considered cheating. Everyone has different standards. Apologize to her for being deceptive. Let her know you desire her but fear for the baby’s safety, which is ridiculous unless it is a high risk pregnancy and the doctor specifically forbid it. Also, there are ways to be intimate, tons of people do it up until labor. It’s something doctors suggest to help induce labor when a baby is overdue."
doordash,fe6k1nl,t1_fe6jsga,1578893444.0,Agreed. DD is screwing over the customers who tip big because they live farther.
RoomieOfficial,fe6jl5b,t3_enurok,1578893001.0,"Yeah, that’s him. He has no legs, hence why people want to know his height."
doordash,fe5ns08,t1_fe4n4r5,1578871948.0,"I too would like to know what the dashers are messing up. Food being too cold because a dasher won’t use the hot bag, yeah, that’s the dasher’s fault. Food spilling because someone cut off the dasher in traffic, also falls on the dasher. Container pops open and spills all over the bag because the lid wasn’t put on properly, restaurant’s fault, although a dasher may be able to check it and prevent it if the bag does not come sealed. Food missing, absolutely restaurants fault if they did not include it."
doordash,fe5n7sl,t1_fe4py2x,1578871638.0,I believe you are correct. The restaurants taking the tips are from using the website of the company.
grubhubdrivers,fe5ms5d,t1_fe3q9bf,1578871493.0,"Wow, that is crap. Your market sounds like mine. Stats sound like mine but you have a better AR and lower CR.  I would think you should have gotten the benefit of the doubt with just a single order. Customers can lie so what’s to stop them from deactivating us all?"
doordash,fe34zh3,t1_fe0bsoz,1578845975.0,Did you try going in and adjusting the tip manually?
doordash,fe34jg3,t1_fe0f9km,1578845846.0,"I would love to know if they can in the US as well. Also, can you see the tip if it is huge? We only see a small payout until we complete it."
doordash,fe33xf6,t1_fe04xdz,1578845677.0,"This! I am a driver and because I don’t want to pay taxes on my own delivery (for awhile I kept getting my own deliveries even when I tipped in app) I started just doing a cash tip. I always give 5 stars, because I know the reason my order is a bit later. I would rather the dasher make the most from my order by my waiting."
doordash,fe2x8s4,t1_fe00cie,1578843880.0,"This isn’t bad. At least it was all quarters. Anything less and it’s insulting but if someone gives me quarters, I appreciate it. They are trying and probably did not have cash on them."
doordash,fe2vwvw,t1_fe1pgqh,1578843397.0,"I think it depends on what you post. A lot of drivers will get upset at another driver if they are doing things that make drivers as a whole look bad. If you post a generic “drivers are garbage”, yeah, your gonna get downvoted.  But if you post a specifically about a situation where a driver drank from the customer’s drink, drivers will turn on the crap driver."
grubhubdrivers,fe2u9xe,t1_fe0m7xv,1578842933.0,That is crap. May I ask how long you had been working for Doordash/how many deliveries/what was your rating? You are the first person I have heard of getting deactivated from 1 missing delivery.
AmItheAsshole,fdulknu,t1_fdsu2ks,1578734852.0,Isn’t the “everyone does it” defense even more of a reason NOT to do it?
grubhubdrivers,fduevtx,t1_fdtvljp,1578732087.0,"And that’s when I show them the address on my phone and they look bewildered but they finally understand I am not making it up. Customer, I don’t care, just fix it for the next poor driver."
grubhubdrivers,fduenw4,t1_fdu9n1n,1578731987.0,"I am pretty sure I did once, and it worked, but then I got stuck on the phone with customer care trying to clear it after I delivered."

doordash,fdsiolq,t1_fds7ksb,1578703492.0,I used to but the surrounding zones are too far away. I tried going to one once and ended up barely breaking even after the gas it took me to get there and with how slow it was.
