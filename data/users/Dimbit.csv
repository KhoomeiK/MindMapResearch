We both get on the same bus, he sits down first, I sit down some seats behind him and then he moves to sit right behind me which weirds me out, he doesn't continue the small talk on the bus. 

Anyway, feeling weirded out I message my sister to meet me at the bus stop.

I get off at my bus stop and he stays on the bus, but as I'm walking down the road (quiet side street) I get that bad feeling of being watched and turn around and there he is. He either made the bus driver stop before the next stop or sprinted from the next bus stop to be behind me so quickly. Also he looks mad and I'm freaking out, I'm walking faster and faster but he is catching up to me quickly. Fortunately, when he is right behind me I see my sister turn onto the road ahead of me and jump in her car. The guy runs out in front of the car, smacks his hands on the bonnet and glares the angriest glare I have ever seen, then he stomps off and we drive home.
