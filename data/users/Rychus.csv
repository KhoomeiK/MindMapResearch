books,fgpmzbh,t1_fgo1o72,1581008058.0,"I completely agree with you. But it's the same thing they are doing with Ariel for the new Little Mermaid and people who are upset about that are somehow ""bigots"" and ""racist"".

To me, it actually seems more offensive to ""piggyback"" off of the success of a certain character and change their skin color, rather than taking the time to develop and create new characters with diverse backgrounds and skin color. It's lazy. Yet Disney is somehow portrayed as being a hero for introducing diversity."

But I'm so scared I will mess that up. I'm so sorry, you were never able to have a relationship with your father. I will think of you often, /u/HeavenlyRose, when I look at my daughter. It will remind me to always be there for her, and to show her what a father should be.

It's so hard for me to do anything but loathe my mother. But my dad was a great man.

If you didn't detonate in time you would die or something.  


I think I read about it after that it was a bug that was never fixed or something so it made me feel a little better but I still haven't played it since."

My guess, is that the “fulfilled by Amazon” products are designated as to whether or not they are a consumable. Third party sellers may not be though and they are likely the ones purchasing the ads."
