But I can definitely state that being honest about mental health is better if everybody is honest about it. And he's not saying ""let's not do this, I'm depressed,"" he's saying ""I haven't been here because I'm depressed"" which is different. Also, I think, as somebody who was and probably still is depressed (I just feel okay now which is not how I felt before, it was much more violent), it would give me more reasons to be honest as well. Seeing a role model position being vulnerable makes one feel that they might be able to do that too.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fcmlulm,t1_fcjv4b3,1577780743.0,"I do need to state that Tulsi Gabbard does not hold the same foreign policy positions as Senator Sanders at all. Before you downvote me, let me provide some arguments and sources.

On Gabbard's current policy page:

""1. We must immediately end the illegal and counterproductive war to overthrow the Syrian government of Assad.” This language is sneaky because it isn't an anti-war platform. She is not anti-war. She is just against ""regime change wars."" Specifically, Assad. She seems to be ""skeptical"" about his use of chemical weapons against his own people. [SOURCE](https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/07/politics/tulsi-gabbard-assad-chemical-weapons-blitzer-cnntv/index.html).

Okay, maybe this is just my bias, but I will take her own words as well.

""In short, when it comes to the war against terrorists, I’m a hawk,"" “When it comes to counterproductive wars of regime change, I’m a dove.” [SOURCE 1](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard). It comes from the [Hawaii Tribune in 2016](https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2016/08/28/hawaii-news/the-rise-of-gabbard-no-telling-how-far-independent-path-will-take-her/) where she also said “I’m not Obama. I’m not Clinton. I’m not Bernie Sanders,” Gabbard said. “I’m me.” And this isn't what I thought was considered Progressive.

""In May 2017, Gabbard announced on her website that she had recently stopped accepting money from several industries, including the defense sector — but by that point, she 
had already pocketed over $115,000 from arms dealers in just her first four years in Congress. 'Regular contributions from companies including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, 
Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and BAE Systems poured in between 2012 (the year she was first elected) and 2016,' HuffPost reported. [SOURCE](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsi-gabbard-anti-war-campaign-donations_n_5c530708e4b093663f5bfa69?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9hcmNkaWdpdGFsLm1lZGlhL3R1bHNpLWdhYmJhcmQtaXMtbm90LWFudGktd2FyLTY2MGU3ZDFlNGNlMQ&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJWkdBx3Om9PS__C_QF0pkiGb9mi-9dlPag6zmZuMpdCRlwH83SLUpB7-MNHTJNJoFBjEQpMoOvdrMuZ6kshsrvo5GWX622XV2ImrQIIqJr3AybzlbEitE6QlY3OEjYr9Z_TzrQEHsgeFGoeRAKE5HRlY8AqxtUdlNJbd2MrCv5g)

The criticism that Tulsi had over Obama is that we weren't droning and bombing enough:
(https://twitter.com/tulsigabbard/status/649458891168714752?lang=en)

She also [remains skeptical that Assad committed war crimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=258&v=wO9EV3-fd1o&feature=emb_title) even though the contention recently with the chemical weapons was from two attacks in Khan Sheykun and Douma, yet there are tons of [other chemical weapon attacks that have not been contested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War#Reported_chemical_weapons_attacks).

I have [a much more extensive list of things](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wRM0al_cPZ3EpX5zakGzNZnrjIQZF8saOML0Q2kKXh4/edit?usp=drivesdk) that are worrying, and I am not willing to call her the same as Bernie at all.

TL;DR: People should at the very least be skeptical that Tulsi is a Progressive or even remotely the same as Bernie when it comes to foreign policy if I'm being ridiculously charitable, in my view."
