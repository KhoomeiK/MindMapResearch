It's a hard truth for a lot of progressives to accept when talking about class solidarity throughout history, but men like Eugene Debs didn't really represent the average white labor agitator of the late 19th and early 20th century.

Many strikes held by labor organizations that truly were fighting for humane working conditions for themselves were weakened by the black ""scabs"" that they refused to accept into their all-white unions.

I've read what seems to me to be a pretty plausible argument that white supremacism contributed to American labor's institutional weakness in comparison to Europe (in addition to other major differences like America's ""open"" frontier and vast natural resources). Early labor unions preferred to consolidate themselves into individual business unions, only extracting benefits from single employers, rather than find solidarity with the newest wave of immigrants or black people sharing their industry."

I don't know if it was Tolkien's explicit intent, but there is a line from Nienna, to her emissary Gandalf, to Frodo and Bilbo and their acts of mercy and ultimately Gollum's both survival and death along with the Ring.

politics,fey7obs,t1_fexjjqw,1579441854.0,"Because unfortunately, the promise of ""bipartisanship"" that seems like a myth to younger, more left-leaning voters is one of, if not the most, important characteristics a politician can have to the older generation. There's a huge yearning in our society for a return to ""civility"" and normalcy, especially from people who only vaguely follow political news. Biden represents a return to that mythological past for them, and for whatever reason they seem to have selective amnesia about the Obama administration's success when *he* tried to engage with Republicans after promising the same.

I am most familiar with the New England political landscape, since I've worked or volunteered for campaigns here, but there are many, many older Democrats in Maine, for example, who *love* Susan Collins. Why? Because when you're not clued in to politics constantly, her self-promotion and strategic voting lets her brand herself as one of the only true ""bipartisan"" members left in Congress. 

I don't agree with their beliefs, and desperately hope the Maine Democratic Party (and the DCSC, which  is basically gonna try and exert full control over the Senate race) have solid messaging and field strategy to convince them that Collins is not the bastion of civility and compromise they see her as. But those beliefs are very real and very set in."
AmericanU,feusqy2,t1_feulueg,1579389576.0,"Oh I was just being dramatic in regards to my dislike with the wonk thing.

 It was a marketing campaign where AU used the term ""wonk"" as a branded term to refer not just to policy wonks but to AU students in particular. Like they wanted AU students to refer to themselves ""Wonks"" the way that Indiana State calls themselves ""Hoosiers.""

Think posters with a gaggle of smiling students going: *I'm a foreign policy Wonk. What kind of Wonk are you?* *I'm an Accounting Wonk*."
AmericanU,feukpdb,t3_eqk922,1579387443.0,"I graduated from AU in 2013. 

Overall I'd say I had excellent professors and love DC as a city (though I've been gone for 4-5 years now). I'm a believer that school is what you make of it no matter where you are, and American does offer a ton of educational and cultural experiences by nature of being in DC and having professors that rotate in and out of the sectors their students want to work in. 

This is a completely random anecdote, but during an organized discussion/debate between my Sociology of Arab Societies professor and an Obama State Dept. employee, my professor completely predicted in 2012 how the Syrian Civil War was going to unfold and end with al-Assad still in power. The point being that your undergraduate professors know their shit, and also generally enjoy engaging with their students.

But AU was a weird school in some specific regards that came from it being a school in transition during my time there. My graduating class was the last class that was admitted before American started its ""Wonk"" branding campaign (I despised it at the time) and spent a couple hundred million on new, higher-quality dorms and facilities.

American is the third or fourth-choice for a lot of gifted but not-quite-Georgetown-caliber students, and one of the unpleasant aspects of AU culture I remember is the general insecurity among some students and the school's leadership at not being Georgetown or GW. Meanwhile it was my first choice because I was a meh high-school student from a bland background and no money.

Which kinda explains why AU is actively rebranding itself and working to rise in the various media rankings as a higher-tier, selective school.

I lucked out and got generous financial aid in order to even afford to attend, but even with all that rebranding, I think there is an uncomfortable economic question for American University: what makes a degree from them tens of thousands of dollars more valuable than one from a state school? They don't want to be a middle-of-the-road institution any more, and that's their perogitive (if it works, it only makes my degree more valuable, since I probably wouldn't have gotten in to AU with it's current acceptance rate), but they're a 60,000+ a year school once you factor in housing and dining. 

If I had come out of American in serious debt, I'd probably be pretty bitter, because unlike Georgetown, an expensivedegree from my alma mater doesn't come with prestige and an alumni network with deep roots in DC's government and private sectors where so many ""Wonks"" dream of working. Maybe it'll get there, though, and maybe it's already getting there since I'm almost a decade removed from my undergraduate education."

hiphopheads,fetx3ue,t1_fetocwm,1579380953.0,"Exactly. Even if the preachers had complete 180's on their homophobic beliefs and promised to make up for all their past hate-preaching ... they are still a weird crowd to join as some sort of public declaration of your conversion and faith (which is what it seems like Kanye trying to do here). Owners of these prophetic Evangelical ministries are exactly what you said - dangerous and misled (and misleading, for people who are lost or searching). Hopefully this isn't too edgy, but I even place them towards the middle on my personal ""religion-to-cult"" gradient, since they preach that the congregation *needs* the pastors guidance to interpret God's signs. 

I'm not a believer any more but I was raised the son of a female pastor in a relatively social-justice oriented denomination. I would have been so offended and frustrated to hear these fools claim to speak for me as a Christian."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feonus0,t1_feokca7,1579302703.0,"It's not really accurate to say that MLK and the Civil Rights Movement framed themselves as a universalist movement; they were clearly a black liberation movement. His public civil rights campaign began with a very specific event and issue: the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, because the legal segregation of black Americans due to Jim Crow was a specific civil rights violation.

Desegregation was also seen as a *specific* issue that the white mainstream didn't think was worth the civil unrest it caused. Opinion polls showed that the majority of white Americans disapproved of Martin Luther King Jr. prior to his death, and it skyrocketed once he made the case that economic injustice and economic segregation were instrinsically linked in *northern* cities, not just the Jim Crow South."

I don't actually disagree with your points, really. I think it's going to be a really hard election for the Dems. And like I mentioned above, Mainers are just not change-averse, they have a cultural preference for politicians like Collins (and Angus, from the other side) who put up a good show of being moderate and bipartisan, and that is Collins's entire brand.

But Maine isn't as purple as it was a couple decades ago. Dem or ""lean Dem"" voters are more than ten points higher than R or ""lean R"" statewide. If we ignore Unenrolled voters completely, the Democratic advantage is down to 8, but still significant. Dems just stereotypically suck at turning out to vote.

I could be wrong after being out of the loop, but I'm fairly sure the MDP is going to hew closely to the midterm strategy of motivating and turning out as many Democratic voters as humanly possible; they killed it during the midterms. This time, they'll also have to make the case to Collins moderate Dem and lean-Dem supporters that she's not the person she says she still is, but I don't think the Maine Dems are going to spend much time trying to reach mildly conservative moderates because they don't need to numbers-wise.

But Collins has a historically large amount of support with crucial Democratic voters - older, moderate Dem and especially moderate women. Older folks who despise Trump and think he's a vile man will still sayhow much they love Collins; her self-promotion and branding as a ""moderate"" has to be one of the most successful political branding campaigns in recent history.

It'll all be about how much they can tie Collins to Trump's worst behaviors and decisions, and erode the facade that she is a bipartisan presence in the Senate.

Iraq's conventional military was far more effective and deadly than Iran's, and they won devastating tank battles against Iran in the opening invasion and during Iran's initial push against the entrenched Iraqis on their soil.

The Revolutionary Guard and its Basij paramilitary won renown in Iran by operating in small-arms teams that specialized in night, mountain and amphibious warfare, and would close the gap between Iranian forces and the Iraqi tanks and artillery that were punishing them. They were one of if not the most effective fighting forces in Iran during the war; they still use the prestige from that era to brand themselves as the group that sacrificed their lives and protected all Iran from the barbarous Saddam Hussein and his Western backers.

Whether or not that prestige can last in an era where their opponents are now unarmed protesters is another question, but any analysis of modern-day Iran without considering the effect of the war is going to be inaccurate."

neoliberal,feaiunl,t1_fea4y2b,1578949386.0,"Sanders for sure can put his foot in his mouth, but I always understood Sanders' comments on PP and HRC not to be indictments of the organizations, but an acknowledgement - that is true; unlike everyone on r/neoliberal *and* on the leftist subs that dislike you guys, I've actually organized for the Dems - that there is overlap between the staff, leadership & major donors of the DNC/state Democratic parties and those of allied organizations. The Human Rights campaign in particular trained a whole generation of immensely talented field staff for the Dems thanks to marriage equality organizing.

Framing it as him ""taking them on"" was the worst possible wording, and one that he created for himself by branding himself as ""anti-establishment"" and always reframing conversations to that talking point. But there is absolutely truth to the fact that allied orgs operate in conjunction with the Democratic Party, and that PP and the HRC were always going to endorse the ""establishment"" candidate, even though Clinton did in fact have a stellar record on women's and LGBTQ rights. If his point was that these organizations have stakeholders to answer to and that they are not the full representatives of women and the LGBTQ community - as I interpreted it - I pretty much agree.

I would also say that given that the DNC email leaks media scandal in part centered around a staff member claiming that a secular Jew can't win the Presidency (with an emphasis on the ""secular"" rather than the ""Jewish"" part, in the actual text of the emails), and how quickly that story got exaggerated and out of hand as evidence of systemic anti-Semetism in the ""establishment"" DNC, it would be chill to take this story with more grains of salt than anti-Sanders subs are gonna be inclined to do."

Qult_Headquarters,fe3oy0r,t1_fe3hjqa,1578851468.0,"[Here's a NYT article from 1979 calling the PIRA ""terrorists.""](https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/24/archives/fundraising-by-a-group-in-us-called-vital-to-ira-operations.html) A quick search - I typed in ""american opinion of the provisional IRA"" - brings up a bunch of articles where they are referred to as terrorists. 

8 million dollars is not actually all that much money compared to what it costs to fund both a provisional government and an armed insurgency over multiple decades, and can easily be explained by donations from the demographic I described - working class Irish-Americans from Boston and NYC, although one source I read said that Noraid recuited a number of wealthy Irish-American business leaders from those areas as well. 

I'm curious where you got that 40% number from (I'm not saying you're wrong), but even then, support for the cause of a united Ireland in general and support for the PIRA in specific are separate things. I don't know this for sure, but unfortunately most Americans in the 70's, 80's and 90's probably just didn't care or know that much about the Troubles, just like most Americans only know storybook versions of Israel-Palestine and overall don't care unless they're Jewish Zionists, Palestinian-Americans, activists or fundies who want the End of Days to come. Any polling would probably capture that sort of simplistic understanding and framing of the Troubles, unless your poll source tells us otherwise. 

I also didn't mean that the Potato Famine history is propaganda in general, more that Noraid literature and speeches from the time focused on simpler narratives *like* the Famine and British atrocities during the 1920's."
Qult_Headquarters,fe3498n,t1_fe2tqf0,1578845803.0,"I know relatively little about the PIRA and the Troubles, but I think the combination of millions of Americans feeling some sort of emotional connection to Ireland due to their heritage and the ""generalizing tendencies of the 20th century"" to paraphrase my favorite quote from Edward Said allowed them to brand themselves as members of the global anti-colonial movement. That said, I don't think most of America in the 80's *did* actually support the provisional IRA. Noraid represented a minuscule portion of the population, and its contributors were working-class Bostonians and New Yorkers who didn't actually know anything about Ulster; they just read propaganda about the Potato Famine and 1920. Instances like Clinton granting visas to select Sinn Fean leaders were tactics towards a peace negotation he could slap his name across (and possibly a message that the U.S. under Clinton was no longer going to give deference to European powers when acting as Global Moral Authority).

Maybe the word 'chud' is expanding in use, but as someone who leans left myself, I'm pretty certain that most online PIRA apologia would come from those types of leftists that feel nostalgia for a period when Marxists actually revolted. But yeah, tactics like proxy bombing are so brutal and horrifying that I don't think the PIRA's reputation has survived well into the 21st century among the general population that even remembers it; I could be mistaken though."

Iran's interference in and pressure on Iraqi politics is almost always framed as an offensive strategy, ostensibly to ultimately create a bridge of client states towards Israel or - like in this thread - for even more nonsensical reasons like to ""get around sanctions"" and ""that's just what they do.""

Creating a buffer makes so much more immediate sense than to start an apocalyptic war with a more powerful and high-tech military, especially when you've read some history of the Iran-Iraq War; how horrific it was and how Iraq served as a funnel for the West to pour financial and military aid against Iran.
