So if you merge in a way that forces someone to brake or accelerate it is an illegal merge as the traffic already on the highway has the right of way.

[""Don’t merge if you’re going to slow traffic](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/little-known-road-rules-in-colorado-that-you-may-be-breaking)
Merging traffic must yield the right-of-way to all oncoming vehicles. Additionally, drivers must avoid merging if it means another vehicle must slow down for you.""

So although I generally do. I do not *have* to let them merge. It's on them to figure their shit out. And if I do have to let them on they are doing something wrong. Not me."

And yes, essential oil vapors do the exact same thing, but more often than not you are not inhaling essential oils in as large of doses and it Is already not recommended to use them in areas with inadequate ventilation. Not that I use E-oils, it's just an excuse I've heard a lot. 

Not to mention. Smelling someones vape is pretty gross. I mean obviously we are all always inhaling each others air. But when its flavored it's more obvious and gross.

Unfortunately companies recognize this so it's getting to the point where the healthier or more environmentally friendly something is, the more expensive it is. So less people can take advantage of it.

fakehistoryporn,fdr0wcl,t1_fdq3t62,1578677977.0,"True. But to expand on what u/Brockmanstrong. Statistics without context and with incorrect interpretations can be. 

There's a difference between ""more African Americans commit crimes than white Americans, because they are black and that's what black people do."" And ""More African Americans commit crimes than white Americans because there are more African Americans in poverty and people in poverty, regardless of race, are more likely to commit crimes"" 

And then you can take it a few steps further to find out why more African Americans are in poverty than white Americans. 

The statistics that are most often misinterpreted in order to disparage a race of people, rarely ever have anything to do with race. But instead are influenced by socioeconomic status.

This is obvious if you look at one race and compare the statistics of those in poverty to those who are not. Even with white people a poor white person is statistically more likely to commit crimes, abandoned their children, beat their wives, etc.

Now for the real talk. I have both. And there is absolutely no difference in using IOS and Android. Aside from having much more customization and back end options in Android. 

See the camera button...press it....take pic....done. see the facebook button... press it...post some narcissistic shit no one but you cares about...done. 

All smartphones function in the exact same way. So just as the user friendly argument is bullshit when comparing console vs pc gaming, it's a bullshit argument here as well.

The argument for design is bullshit as well because unless you're rich and an idiot, you throw a case on that bitch.
