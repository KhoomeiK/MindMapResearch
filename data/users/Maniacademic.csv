It feels like it should be pretty clear that the part of this sentence people are objecting to, when discussing serious dog reactivity, is not ""needs to be the only dog in the home."""
dogs,ffh3vgq,t1_ffh0fi2,1579922398.0,Not if they're actively trying to elicit that emotional involvement.
dogs,ffgu7de,t1_ffgr4gw,1579915171.0,"Do these rescues want people responding to their ads who don't have the means or inclination to deal with those kinds of serious behavioral problems? 

Realistically, if they have to convince someone to get attached to a dog's profile online and then come in and hang out with the dog in order for those people to consider adopting the dog, they're banking on people making emotional decisions they wouldn't otherwise make. 

I also think this kind of behavior can understandably create an impression for prospective adopters that shelters/rescues are dishonest about their dogs' behavioral issues."
dogs,ffgohi8,t1_ffghg6d,1579911054.0,"Yeah, I don't think encouraging people to get emotionally involved 
with the dog *before* explaining the actual behavioral issues they're signing up for is in anyone's best interest, either."
antiMLM,ffan5zc,t1_ff9zoo4,1579739875.0,I don't think these things are mutually exclusive.
dogs,ff7re6q,t3_erqcm0,1579656520.0,This is my favorite thread on this entire subreddit.
dogs,ff7pyw9,t3_es10m5,1579655522.0,"Yeah, I put down a deposit on a pup from a breeder because I got tired of the competition. I'm a dog trainer who can bring my dog to work and has no real major red flags, but there was always someone who could get in an application faster or who asked fewer questions."
dogs,ff7pkuo,t1_ff7ph4d,1579655246.0,I would suggest not free-feeding them. Especially given that your dogs are biting each other over food.
dogs,ff7outd,t3_es3rur,1579654741.0,"To be honest, your idea of the social dynamics among your dogs sounds mostly imaginary/the result of your own personal projection. 

You should probably feed your dogs separately. It is not normal or necessary for dogs in your household to bite each other."
dogs,ff259h4,t3_er5kn5,1579494180.0,"Hey, anon. I'm so, so sorry you lost your father this way. 

Dogs are amazingly adaptable, especially dogs raised for service work – I agree that getting her on a schedule and giving her a lot of love will definitely be helpful for her. 

Side note: when you're able, you may want to reach out to the organization that trained Daisy to let them know what happened. I can't speak for that specific organization, but I know that the organization I work for would like to know what happened to the dog, and to know that she is no longer working. They may also be able to give you information on commands Daisy knows, or give you contact information for the volunteer who raised her as a puppy. No pressure on that last one if you don't want to have contact, but a lot of puppy raisers would love to connect and know how the dog they raised is doing. 

Thinking good thoughts for you and Daisy both."
DetroitBecomeHuman,ff1ybd6,t3_er0olk,1579488979.0,"The Zlatko chapter or Kara Captured. 

Between Zlatko and the weird basement torture doctor in Heavy Rain, I kind of get the sense that David Cage has an uncomfortable fetish he keeps inflicting on people who play his games. I love Luther and the bear, but the rest of the chapter is just unpleasant. There aren't any interesting choices to make, you just try not to die. 

Kara Captured is just.....painfully tacky. I don't like seeing hamfisted Holocaust allegories being used as a cheap ploy to get an emotional reaction out of an audience, and find that this kind of lazy writing has more of a desensitizing effect on people than anything else? I made my girlfriend play through the chapter once and don't intend to revisit it."
DetroitBecomeHuman,ff1n90b,t3_er1siw,1579481998.0,Sumo.
DetroitBecomeHuman,fezcbe7,t3_eqydiw,1579455898.0,"I get it and agree, but in some cases it would be prohibitive to fully explain what the choices mean, especially with quicktime events/choices. I do also think it can be fun to see gameplay options you didn't necessarily expect. >!LIke, I didn't think Markus choosing not to trust Connor would mean Markus *shot him in the head*, lol.!<"
dogs,fevna4b,t1_fevl8bp,1579399270.0,I'm really glad to hear your dog is getting support and has a diagnosis now. I'm rooting for you guys – hope he comes out of this ok.
dogs,feupoi1,t3_eqmh2x,1579388799.0,It's a normal dog behavior. Just pick the poop up so they can't get to it.

nothingeverhappens,fetczo9,t3_eqk0ne,1579374043.0,"As we all know, any woman describing her child saying something is a lying bitch."
dogs,fet2sz8,t3_eqjt22,1579371303.0,"That is an interesting mix! To be honest with you, mixed breeds are unpredictable. I would anticipate that this dog would be large and energetic (50-60+ lbs). Unfortunately, it's hard to say much else – no one can know how relatively shepherd-y or husky-y or akita-y this specific dog is, or what kind of behaviors he might exhibit. 

Is he in a foster home? Or a shelter where the staff know him well? They might give you the best insight into what this specific dog is like."
dogs,fet1q6k,t1_fet0gr7,1579370999.0,"Dog enthusiasts generally care about dog welfare and aren't crazy about unethical backyard breeding practices. 

I would reach out to a local rescue organization to adopt out the puppies."
dogs,fet19is,t3_eqjtld,1579370889.0,Please call your vet and ask. Phone calls are free.
dogs,fep04he,t3_eq9ag8,1579309167.0,"Your dog is very sick and is suffering. The only answer to this situation is that your dog needs veterinary care. If you can't provide care, you need to surrender the dog to a person or organization that can. 

Please consider calling your vet. It's free to call, and they may be able to give you more locally specific advice."
dogs,feox23m,t1_feovhiw,1579307253.0,"I don't know if you're just not understanding how the tone of your comments comes off, but yeah, absolutely. 

I work for a nonprofit training service dogs and teaching clients to utilize them. It's literally my full-time job. 

I suppose yes, literally anyone could write up any certificate saying anything they want. I could print out a certificate saying that my cat is a service dog. I could print out a certificate saying that the potted plant in my office is a service dog. None of that would particularly mean anything. There's no recognized ""certificate"" for owner-trained dogs that holds any particular weight or meaning, though there is plenty of money to be made selling fake ones."

**Please do not play service dog cop.** Disabled people deserve to be able to go in public without being interrogated by smug strangers."

ESAs should not be in shops, period."
dogs,feog3gj,t1_feng8ro,1579299612.0,"As a professional service dog trainer, I have no idea what you're talking about in this whole thread, or why you're being so snotty and sure of yourself in the comments. I don't know of any meaningful or widely recognized ""third party certification"" that can be done with owner-trained dogs."
