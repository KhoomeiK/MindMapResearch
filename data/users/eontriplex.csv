deadbydaylight,ffueoyv,t1_ffud9go,1580240385.0,"I can agree with the GF thing, however I think that the fundamental difference is that the noise isnt played WHILE demo is stealthy. To be fair he has the loud ass footsteps that give survs more warning, but, again demo is about landing 1 hit, not 2 or more in a chase. 


For me, Demo Teleport works in the same way that the purple Freddy teleport item does: its about making survivors unsure. Unless you can see the portal he is coming out of, or have a swf in comms to tell you, you cant be sure where he went. Admittedly, though, demo is weaker than other killers because its not a 50/50 situation, but a 33/33/33 depending on how the demo acts."

If you hook a survivor, then immediately portal away, there will probably be a surv rushing the hook to give u ur Hope token fast.  The even better part, is that demo can just put a portal under his Devour Hope totem, and then Channel Abyss at like any time to check if its being cleansed

3.) Find and destroy portals near gens. This is tje best for demo as time is wasted AND gens aren't done.

Obviously, smoking out of anything with a plastic downstem or, god forbid, bowl piece, is a bad idea because of putting flame right to it. But smoking from a can should at least be fine because:

A.) Aluminum is not known to be hazardous to human health except in extremely high exposure.

B.)With a can pipe, flame only touches exterior aluminum. This will definitely heat up interior plastic, and indeed you may ingest a little, but 


C.) The plastic ingested via smoking isn't greater than the plastic ingested from drinking said soda. I mean soda is acidic, and while plastic contains acids, its unrealistic to think a fairly strong acidic substance wouldn't chip away at at least some of the plastic."
