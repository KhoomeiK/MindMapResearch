My uncle once got incredibly angry at a barbeque (I must have been 12 or 13) and told my stepdad something, stepdad turned purple (I swear, it was just about PURPLE) and started yelling at some couple to leave and never set foot in his house again. I was confused and upset, but when my stepdad turned back to me he was super cheerful and seemed to be trying to keep me from asking about it.

I was in high school before I found out what had happened. Apparently when I hugged my uncle, the husband of the couple got a thrill watching and he made a comment about what he'd like to 'do' with me...

I always let it simmer longer (both to make sure alcohol is gone, and because letting the sauce simmer for 30min-an hour makes it lucious and tasty) but can honestly say feeding him white wine pasta sauce has not sent him spiralling back into the bottle. 

Although I do bring the exact amount of wine for the dish and keep it in my purse until I cook. Not because I think he'd steal it (since he chose to quit, he had had only a few set backs, none in at least 10 years and none that involved taking someone else's alcohol) but because it seems unkind to leave something tempting in sight when he has admitted he sometimes still has urges to drink.

Nope. That 'husband stitch' ruined their sex life for quite awhile, it was too painful for his wife to make love and although she would try to 'suck it up' for him, he couldn't stand that because ""its not sex if she's hurting, its just selfishness.""

But even mentioning the words gets him spitting fire. He says her vagina was beautiful and perfect and that asshole doctor mutilated her because he was a 'sorry piece of shit who shoulda been kicked outta med school and not even allowed to mop the floor of a maternity ward' And both he and her talk about it very openly because they are convinced if they can keep one couple from suffering the same way, it gives what she went through some purpose."

I had a moment of rage for the snakes that might get injured without the last line. And flashbacks of the time I took a shower to get my friend's asshole Rock Python off me. (He thought my arm was food, or possibly just felt like biting the crap outta me, with Fluffy it could go either way.)"

NuclearRevenge,fe9zs9l,t1_fdtxnr0,1578942922.0,"Dunno how that would work, we lived in Texas and the HOA couldn't bring us into them. But our house was built by my stepmom (well, on her orders, construction crews BUILT it.) several years before the HOA came along.

Maybe they can try to make you join if you buy a house that wasn't previously in it? No idea, I kinda hate all HOAs."
NuclearRevenge,fe9zey5,t1_fdd8vcu,1578942809.0,"My stepmom lived on the border of an HOA. Her house was built something like 7 years before the HOA arrived and they couldn't force her to join, but everyone around us was in it. (Maybe with the exception of one nextdoor neighbor? I know that neighbor had a much nicer yard than anyone else with more plants, so not sure if they were HOA or not.)

Legally they couldn't force us to follow their silly rules (and they WERE silly, we once got a notice from a board member who didn't realize he had no power over us demanding the 5+ year old rose bushes be pulled out. My dad sent back a message that if anything happened to those bushes, he was keeping the phoney notice as evidence the board was at fault.) but they tried sometimes and the neighbor behind us was a major dickhead because he thought EVERYONE should follow the HOA rules like they were the word of God. (Except when his grandkids were over and breaking the rule against 'loud play'. For clarity, apparently my 5 year old brother making 'vroom' sounds with his hot wheels was so loud Mr. Dickhead needed to scream over the fence at him, but his four grandkids with airhorns was not. I'm still sore over that, mostly because airhorns freak me out.)

So yes they can get on your nerves, to my knowledge they cannot do the shit they did to Richard."

I never do, because it seems intrusive. But I don't care that much about a deadname (unless it has something to do with the new name) I just find the idea of people naming themselves very charming and wanna know how they chose it. (I also ask people about their child or pet's name origin so at least I am equal opportunity nosy)

She seemed to need someone to talk to, so I was happy to lend an ear but someone's junk and anything surgical are on my list of topics I don't enjoy discussing so it was kinda hard. (Especially when she mentioned needing to be intubated because she wasn't breathing easy on her own, that just broke my heart.)

Oddly, I found it easier to help her get dressed after she had a outpatient procedure done (noting related to gender, just a basic health thing but she was wobbly and needed a hand) than I did listening to her surgery story. So not sure if I am prude or just hate hospital stuff."

AmItheAsshole,fe3l9v0,t1_fe2sp1s,1578850290.0,"I think its much more likely to happen if the abused adult believes the abuse was normal or okay.

I have known lots of abused people who had kids (my own parents included, the things done to them... jesus.) and did not continue the cycle. My parents even managed a civil divorce without anyone getting abusive. (For the sake of 100% honesty, my parents were not perfect and they did make some choices I will not continue with my own kids. But they were good parents, loved me, and did their absolute best to raise me well. I cannot call either of them abusive and feel lucky they were mine.)"

AskReddit,fdytw1u,t1_fdqpk3i,1578783515.0,"My dad swore he picked up a phantom hitchhiker once. No cemetery though, he picked her up on the highway, she got in the back seat (my uncle was riding shotgun and has claimed he remembers this) and asked where she wanted to go, she didn't say anything so he decided to drive her to a truck stop/gas station that was on a bus route, figuring she'd be safer there than on the side of the highway.

They got there and she was gone.

So pretty much the classic story, just not told about a 'friend of a friend' and with a second person swearing its true. (Admittedly, the spot they supposedly got her from is known for accidents, its a weird curve with no lighting except for cars passing by. I've heard of a lot of people who saw people that weren't there when they checked their rearview in the same area, but Dad said he picked up the girl there.)"
