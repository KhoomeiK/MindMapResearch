GetMotivated,fet3u4f,t1_fesy6qt,1579371565.0,"There's a reason the quality of nurse practitioners is so variable and the pay is lower in comparison. A lot of them set up their own clinical rotations with individual practitioners who aren't hired by the school... So the quality of instruction is variable. 

The hospital makes more with it.

A family practice doctor will bill.. Maybe 200 dollars to manage someone's dm2 and htn.

Or you have a nurse practitioner bill 100 for a visit then refer to endo and cards which bills 400 dollars each.

Idle specialists are an administrators worst nightmare.

If you want to rake in the money with a hospital system, buy up all the local primary care offices and then fire your family docs and replace them with nurse practitioners.  Staff your urgent cares with nps and pas. Make sure the pay is low enough that people leave after 5 years or so so you never have very experienced nps. 

Then watch the referrals, unnecessary lab tests, unnecessary imaging studies, and ER referrals roll in.  All of these reimburse so much better than you get from running a good primary care system.

AskReddit,fe1f377,t1_fe0xujs,1578825836.0,"Here's the problem conceptually with the concept of spiked drinks. It can certainly happen...  But your drink is already spiked... With alcohol.

I've had nights with bad reactions simply to the alcohol I was choosing to drink. Usually they were when I skipped eating a full dinner.

But then if someone is trying to intoxicate someone else, especially when they're drinking mixed drinks, extra alcohol is the first thing to look out for. Men who make women go 'drink for drink' can basically be doing this simply with normal, unadulterated alcohol.

 But 'extra strong' drinks are more insidious as well and I'd consider that a spiked drink. An extra shot of vodka in a sweet mixed drink can be hard to detect, and the bar provides it!  If they don't do doubles at the bar, a shot on the side and adding it to the drink is possible too although looks more suspect.  Someone really trying to put someone under could put 190 proof into a drink, making one drink into more than 3.   But this is unlikely to be 'untargeted' I suppose. And if they test for it at a hospital all they find is alcohol.

I think the bugaboo of 'date rape' testing kits and such teaches people to look out for the wrong thing.  Alcohol is typically the culprit. Would you have noticed the bartender making your drink a double? If you're worried enough the drink you're accepting then maybe you shouldn't accept it.   If you want to accept a drink from someone else then the safest way is to order and receive it straight from the bartender."
