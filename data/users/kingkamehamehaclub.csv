Moping is easier in the short term, but it isn't productive and it will just make the uphill climb that much harder.  I am dealing with the aftermath of my moping right now, it ain't good and I can't believe I let it get to this.  Weightlifting has helped me recently, not power lifting or anything (I'm pretty sure the woman next to me was lifting the same amount of weight as me for the shoulder press), but just for health.  It has really helped my mood when I get low, and it has kept me motivated knowing I'm getting a little stronger each day.  I wish all the best for you man
