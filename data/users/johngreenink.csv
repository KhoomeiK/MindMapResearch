malegrooming,ffch2r9,t3_esw0z2,1579799311.0,"Hi all - I have a (pretty much) all white goatee / chinny beard right now (I'm 51, and the beard at my chin is really white, not even gray.) I'd like to tone it down a bit to a medium gray or just something a bit less bright white, although dyeing it to ""match"" my original hair color would be weird and look silly, I think (I am originally dark brown, but I have too much white and gray mixed now for that to be an option.) I also  shave my head.

Once I tried to do this with a ""gray dye"" I bought online on Amazon, the product came from South Korea I believe, and it essentially turned my beard a grayish purple. About 4 days later it toned it down and looked a bit more normal, but it was never really a neutral gray.

I've heard that dyeing white hair is a challenge. Any thoughts, help, suggestions on how to go about this? I really appreciate any suggestions!"

One thing you might do is check out some sites online that sell clothes, just to see what people are wearing these days. Some of the sites will have dumb clothes on them (I mean, some fashion is just dumb.) But, you'll get an idea of how things are changing. For instance, you can see some pretty cool stuff on Gilt [https://www.gilt.com/boutique/siteSection/men/](https://www.gilt.com/boutique/siteSection/men/), SSense (this is expensive stuff, but interesting to look at): [https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men), COS men [https://www.cosstores.com/en\_usd/men/new-arrivals.html](https://www.cosstores.com/en_usd/men/new-arrivals.html), ASOS (a bit on the younger side, but also some cool stuff) [https://www.asos.com/us/men/](https://www.asos.com/us/men/).

kinda yeah... I think most of us are perfectly aware of stats about what's not good to eat for children. I doubt that these parents are intent on getting their kid addicted to sugar.
