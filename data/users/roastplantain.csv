And then both eyes don't look the same so you gotta adjust the other eye. Gotta fix some of the concealer and foundation under the originally messed up eye.

It spirals and you can't stop it.

And now your skirt somehow doesn't look quite right with you new eyeliner wings so you gotta find a new skirt or switch to pants or jeans and now you need a different top.

""Two of the articles against President Andrew Johnson were based on rude speech that reflected badly on the office: President Johnson had made ""harangues"" criticizing the Congress and questioning its legislative authority, refusing to follow laws, and diverting funds allocated in an army appropriations act, each of which brought the presidency ""into contempt, ridicule, and disgrace"".[11] 


Andrew Jackson defined ""high crimes ans misdemeanors"" as  ""the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust.""[7] Such offenses were ""political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.""[7]

Basically if the president makes the office of the president and country look like a shitshow he can be impeached and removed. You're hung up on what crime was committed, the fact is ia that there needn't be a crime at all. 

""The purpose of impeachment is not to inflict personal punishment for criminal activity. Instead, impeachment is a ""remedial"" tool; it serves to effectively ""maintain constitutional government"" by removing individuals unfit for office.
