AskReddit,fde79q5,t3_ekxa24,1578332730.0,"Depends how bad the situation is. 

1. Tell someone who you can trust.
2. Try seeking professional help, it might take longer to get a psychiatrist and finding a good therapis is also about being lucky, so if the situation worsens get immidiate help, even psych word if that's what it takes to get better.
3. Make prevention, if you ever planned on killing yourself, remove all the items from your house that could possible cause harm, tell your friend what to do if it gets worse (drive you to hospital, call your parents,etc.) 
4. Whatever happens, remember your life matters, it's all just in your head and you are the only one who can change it by accepting the help offered."

They are going to give him the right medication adn therapy he needs, do you have some similar place in you country? I think it's for the best, since we had some family issues also and now he can focus only on getting better and realising what he actually wants from life."

I broke down multiple times, once ran away from library and my friends found me in the locker room, punching my locker.. It's normal to cry, panic, or have an anxiety, you have to learn how to work with it... My friends calmed me down and spoken to me for like two hours to make sure I was okay. They kept an eye on me since they learnt I struggle with anxiety and panic attacks a lot."

SuicideWatch,fcr6vza,t1_fcopjyo,1577897644.0,"I exactly know how you feel, wasn't it for my friends and my luck with doctors, I wouldn't be here anymore. My younger brother has similar issue to mine and it hurts me seeing him the same way not a long time ago. He didn't tell anyone but I somehow managed to get it out from him and trying to do my best to get him better because I know how shitty I felt when I was in the hospital by myself and no one knew I was there. 

He spent most of the days since like 22nd just laying in my room, doing nothing, just watching me study for my exams. Yesterday he completely broke down, went outside and I had to look for him in the field, he kept sending me away but then we both ended up crying for a good hour. I hate seeing my little brother in pain, just wanting to end his own life. Reaching out to someone is the best thing you can do, you have to beat that bitch in your head by yourself, but being with someone and seeing in their eyes that they worry about you and they actually care about you and you left a mark on them is something that can help also imo.. Oh well sorry for the rant.."
