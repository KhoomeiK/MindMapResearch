Animemes,ffjmaff,t1_ffjf4os,1580001528.0,Definitely wouldn't do that

DaenerysWinsTheThrone,ffgcy7e,t1_ffga0jw,1579903471.0,I started to read the books and just couldn't.
IdiotsFightingThings,ffap2kc,t1_ffandsd,1579741156.0,"Exactly. I'm all for owning guns,but good gosh idiots shouldn't be able to own guns. 

My neighbors are perfect examples. Had to call the land lord about them shooting in a spot that was almost directly in front of my home."
MapPorn,ff9aib1,t3_es5cf4,1579708557.0,Not entirely correct. I live in the most Western NC county and there is a Mormon church.

Wish me luck!"

videos,fejf60c,t1_fejdw4f,1579171200.0,"The potential that a modern war has truly scares me. And all something else is that's scary is that war is going out of the living memory of people. There's hasn't been a truly large war since ww2. 

They say in the documentary some of the soldiers romanticized war before it.  Some people are starting to romantiize war again."
