HistoryMemes,ff9wni1,t1_ff9vis3,1579723125.0,"That is correct, but it is still immoral to take from people and give to others. It's not like the workers are being forced to work at a place, they can work somewhere else if they're getting paid minimum wage. It is immoral to take from anybody, to give to  others."
HistoryMemes,ff9rmne,t1_ff9k79u,1579719617.0,"Wow, what a way to twist this. You're an idiot. It is not fair to take from somebody else and give to somebody else who didn't work for it. Socialism is not democracy, so there was no point in you saying that."
HistoryMemes,ff9le1a,t1_ff9kre2,1579715446.0,"Almost all of those examples you just gave, have collapsing currently. And I will say again, if it requires somebody else's labor or money, it is not a right."
HistoryMemes,ff9k33r,t1_ff9j974,1579714681.0,"No, socialism is morally wrong. Its theft. It implies that there are rights that aren't rights. Things that require other people's labor, aren't rights. Ie- healthcare, schooling, bottled water, business made food. They aren't rights if it means another person has to do something for you."

wholesomememes,ff94g0s,t1_ff9405m,1579704603.0,"Actually, most scientists agree with the fact that, we actually have no idea what is happening right now. We don't know if the change is man made or natural. China and India are responsible for 90% of all carbon emissions and land waste. The Ubited States does not need to change anything about its climate or environmental production. Capitalism does need regulation, but that's different from the government making tax payers, pay for something. Having regulations on what can be produced is different from the government making public healthcare a thing and making us pay for it. The policies proposed by Bernie Sanders, would indefinitely obliterate the entire working class sector of the US economy."

wholesomememes,ff90gqy,t1_ff8zsy3,1579701690.0,"Not all conservatives are climate deniers. Most of us agree that there is something going on, but the US can't do anything about it, and destroying our economy is definitely not the answer. Not only that, but we are coming out of an ice age. What is happening right now is exactly what happened during the Roman warming period. 
Bernie Sanders policies would completely destroy the economy of the United States. He wants to completely publicize every business and regulate everything. He just recently called for the regulation of damn house pricing. He calls all of these random things ""rights"", when clearly, they aren't rights. Anything that requires the labor of another person, is not a right. IE- healthcare, schooling, food, bottled water, cars, housing, and literally everything else. People don't seem to understand that public things just do not work. Why do you think the UK was sick of that labor party? Because they were just stealing money and giving it to people who didn't work for it or deserve it. Hence why Boris Johnson was elected, and hence why brexit is on the horizon. People are sick of the economic destruction that socialism is bringing to everything."

Because some stronger person can just come up to you and rape you and by your logic, it's societal to say that's bad. Some stronger dude can just enslave you, but according to you, that's societal, and not objectively evil. Some stronger dude can just come into your house and take your shit because he wants to, and that's societal, and also not objectively evil.
Your arguments are stupid. Privacy is not societal, it is a basic right endowed by our creator."
