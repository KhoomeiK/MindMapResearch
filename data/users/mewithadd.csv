reptiles,fcxuu70,t3_ejfait,1578070750.0,"Facebook has a group called Animals born different (also has Livestock born different).  If you are on Facebook,  look it up.  Quite often,  when people post these types of things, they get offers to buy them from people who are into preserving odd specimens.  

You'll want to Google proper preservation,  I think you need to refrigerate it within a certain amount of time to keep it from degrading."
Horses,fcxfecf,t3_eje1mk,1578061499.0,Its aroma therapy!
Horses,fcrjc6z,t1_fcri43v,1577902571.0,"Absolutely!  I have horses and a dog, and the dog goes out to run in the pastures all the time.  But in the video the dog is following very closely,  and a couple of times even makes a little jump towards the horse's hocks.  Those are the moments when I was thinking the horse might kick out.  These two obviously are very used to each other, and it doesn't appear to be an issue.   But horse behavior in general... they don't take kindly to small carnivores jumping towards their hind legs."
Equestrian,fcldgwr,t3_ehlgdc,1577745262.0,"We taught our gelding this stretch just for fun, because it looks like a bow.  

But this thread has me thinking... we have a mare that my daughter rides that is a bit sway backed.   Would this help her engage her back more, and perhaps lengthen her stride a bit?"
Horses,fclcep3,t3_ehmjn7,1577744581.0,"This makes me nervous... even a calm well trained horse might be inclined to kick with a dog that close to his hind legs.

They are both beautiful,  wish I could see all of the horse!"
