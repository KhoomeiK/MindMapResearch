GradSchool,ffv7af4,t3_euq1sn,1580257378.0,"2 for 12 acceptance rate from my grad. school applications (about 4 years ago).

First round of applications to 4 schools, one of them never got a letter of recommendation from one of my profs. 0 acceptance letters

Second round of applications. Worked much more on fine tuning my applications and cold emailing people at different universities to ask for advice on how to go about the application process and what sort of research I could get into. Still just 2 out of 8 acceptance letters. Cost me around $800 all total for just the second round.

Currently a 4th year math PhD student. Haven't enjoyed graduate school as much I would have liked, but it has been OK.  
The trick, if there is one, is to give 0 fucks, continue learning on your own if you have to, and keep at it if you really feel like graduate school is the only reasonable course of action for you."

But honestly, I've heard from multiple people that year 3 was lacking in motivation. They get done with their quals in year 1, get into some research in year 2, and then the juice runs low in year 3 for a while.

My experience has been, if you're not feeling it, don't work hard for a little bit. Or work hard, but doing something different. I like to read physics and biology or chem. as my version of a ""break,"" but not everyone is...like that ha. But yeah, maybe bring it up with your advisor and see if they'd be cool with you taking a week or two off of your primary project to just do other things for a bit.

You might be surprised at the change in your attitude and motivation after coming back to your research. It can make quite the difference. Also, your advisor might think it's a good idea. There seems to be a notion in my experience with academic people that research proceeds through hard work and effort, but...spinning your wheels doesn't seem productive to me.

Edit: I'm a fourth year math PhD student, by the way. Just so that's clear ha. And I'm honestly feeling quite done with the whole process of graduate school and such."

Physics,ffppldc,t3_euieso,1580101328.0,"Actually not a physics book, but I think Linus Pauling does a decent job of collecting ideas from modern physics in the first 100 pages or so of his *General Chemistry* text. You can find it easily enough for cheap enough. He also does some thermodynamics in that book and even some nuclear chemistry, if I remember rightly. As far as I can tell, Pauling had a remarkable grasp of the prevailing physical theories of the day in spite of being primarily a chemist.

I also like David Tong's notes posted here: [http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html)  
You can really just start at the top of that page and just work your way down and master quite a bit of material as you go.

You'll need a modern physics book at some point. The ones I've seen typically present things from the perspective of an experimentalist, which can be quite valuable. Richtmeyer and Kennard (I think that's the spelling) start their modern physics book with a decent history of physics and then an overview of Maxwell's work. (Maxwell himself wasn't some premier experimentalist, but he basically translated all of Faraday's research on electromagnetism into rigorous mathematical language.) It's good to grab intuition from some of the major names like Maxwell, Noether, Einstein, etc., as you go, even if you have to do so from secondary sources. (I think you can find the Richtmeyer and Kennard book easily enough online, too.)

Fermi's notes on Thermodynamics, which you can find easily enough as a PDF online, are fantastically intuitive, I think. Fermi, if you didn't know, was well known for being a fantastic communicator of material. He just distilled things to main ideas which contained loads of intuition.

Those are just some of the books I've enjoyed over the past couple years as I've gotten more serious in my study of physics. Once I finish the modern physics book I'm reading, I'm going to dive back into Bohm's *Quantum Theory*.

That said, you want to be careful as you tread the paths of physicists. You want to be careful to master sufficient mathematics as you go. Electromagnetic radiation makes a lot more sense with some Fourier analysis under your belt. *Everything*, done properly, requires Calculus 3 and all the languages of gradients, curls, and divergences. You'll want to know some statistics and maybe even functional analysis if you want to do a proper tour of quantum mechanics."
