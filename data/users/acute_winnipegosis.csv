Documentaries,ff55j01,t1_ff3c5n1,1579580824.0,"I think the point of HAES (or, at least what I've taken away from it) is that, instead of focusing on weight, we should measure and promote good habits related to other factors with a direct link to health outcomes. Things like cardiovascular health, etc. For many people, there's a lot less emotional baggage involved in a discussion of cholesterol or blood pressure than there is around weight.

Of course, if somebody is working to improve those other factors, weight loss is probably going to happen, too. The point is not to make it the main focus. As someone who was formerly prediabetic and morbidly obese, it was much more useful and much less crushing to have a doctor focus on my blood sugar and explain how I could change my diet to prevent diabetes, than to hear all of my other doctors just telling me to lose weight."
