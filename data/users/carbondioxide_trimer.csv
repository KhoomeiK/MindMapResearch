gay_irl,ffbeg8h,t1_ffb3t5t,1579761788.0,">Nobody is lying to me to not ""hurt my delicate feelings"". You are the one who started with the attitude, so obviously I struck a cord with you.

No, just tired of hearing this excuse from overweight folks that a perfectly reasonable statistical model is somehow wrong when it's still used rather extensively and gives a very good indication of weight in relation to health.

>All I am saying is that the BMI chart is misleading and not accurate. On average, people live longer with an [""overweight"" BMI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109714003349) and that the BMI chart is not a good indicator for [cardiometabolic health](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo201617). 

I never said anything about this; only that BMI gives a decent indication of weight distribution and how it can affect one's overall health. In the same way that smoking increases your *risk* of lung cancer, you can easily see that a high BMI correlates strongly with an increased *risk* of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, hypertension and other similar weight-related issues. Your two studies pale in comparison to the research done to show the above connections. It's basic health and medical knowledge at this point. The mental gymnastics and lies that people tell themselves in order to feel like BMI somehow doesn't apply or is applied incorrectly to them are quite astounding and I should know because I was deluding myself with your same feel-good arguments just a year ago.

>It is outdated. It is misleading. If it works for you, then great. No need to be a little bitch over the fact that some people don't want to use an outdated measurement of health from the 1830s. Professionals such as the Professor of Numerical Analysis at Oxford University [agrees](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/bmi.html) that it is providing people with wrong information - i.e. short people think they are thinner than reality and tall people think they are fatter than reality.

I've already covered this and even conceded the point in regards to height in my original comment. Still it gives a decent indication for the average person and is *good enough* for the tail ends of the normal distribution of height. It's not misleading in the slightest unless you've deluded yourself that much as many obese folks have and even as I did before finally realizing that I'm not special and that these medical standards are used for a reason. As for the age of the statistic somehow making it irrelevant, that's a common logical fallacy. Until there's evidence that it doesn't work or we have a better model, it's the one that is being used.

So again, if you have a better statistic to quickly ascertain someone's health risks as they pertain to weight, please share."
gay_irl,ffb1rlg,t1_ffawuhu,1579749631.0,"I've done my research and know for a fact you're wrong. BMI works just fine for the average person and is used extensively still throughout medical research regarding excess weight and its effects on the human body. That's why BMI has such large ranges to account for differences across ethnicities and the sexes.

Are there better measures? Sure, and in fact I mentioned them in my original comment. Since I know my bf % I'm not as concerned with my BMI because I can confidently say I have an above average amount of lean body mass compared to the average person. But that's after 4 years of power lifting and then a year of cutting the excess weight.

Are they're quicker measures or ones that have been as extensively correlated with obesity and its host of medical issues and used throughout medical research? Unfortunately, no.

I'm sorry that you're offended by facts and it's a shame that your friends and family have to lie to you to not hurt your delicate feelings. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
gay_irl,ff94bgy,t1_ff8b0nu,1579704518.0,"It works just fine for someone of average height. It even works for someone like me in a pinch. There are additional ways to judge someone's weight distribution like waist circumference and skin fold tests for bf% but as far as quick and easy goes, BMI is quite useful.

When I was 290 with a BMI well over 30 I both looked obese and was in fact obese as dictated by the BMI scale. I've lost that weight and although I look a lot more fit, I still agree that I'm overweight which aligns with the BMI scale.

BMI doesn't judge someone's overall health, it only gives an idea of weight distribution which is still a large part of someone's overall health. Someone with a BMI of 27 (overweight) is probably fine with those few extra pounds. Someone with a BMI of 33 is obese and BMI gives a decent indication of this and correlates with a whole of host of health issues.

If you've discovered an alternative to BMI that's as easy to calculate and correlates well with other health morbidities, then please, publish in a medical journal."
gay_irl,ff807h2,t1_ff7xts8,1579662598.0,"Uhh... That's obese by medical standards! I'm currently 230 lb and 6ft 3in. That's after losing 65lb last year, going from 25% bf to 13% and I still have 15lb to go to get down to 7%. I'm actually still overweight by BMI, FWIW.

I went from a 44in waist down to 34in in pants sizes, not true waist circumference, which was 36in as of last Sun measured just above the belly button.

If you're happy with yourself then fine, I'm glad you're that confident, but you're definitely chubby by the numbers you give alone."

You can in fact have that slice of cake, just not every day and not the whole cake.

A proper set of macro ratios and caloric balance while at a healthy weight will sustain you just fine, but you have to give yourself room to live a little, hence moderation."

KingdomHearts,fev16ep,t1_feugraw,1579391950.0,"No, it's not. I'm saying it's easier than it appears because it's just a series of scales and is highly repetitive. The more rythimic, syncopated music with interval jumps between pitches is much more difficult than just ascending and descending a scale in easily divided 16th notes."
KingdomHearts,fes47u0,t1_ferv460,1579361236.0,"Sounds like scales to me in rapid succession. Any piano player worth their salt probably has played a 1000+ etudes like that and has the patterns committed to memory.

Not trying to diminish the ability because getting to that point of course takes a ton of practice, but it's one of those things in music that you're kinda just expected to be good at immediately as a professional because those patterns show up so often in music."

What helped me the most was using medical statistics and ranges and making sure I fall within those: like BMI, waist circumference, and bf%. Some days I feel like I actually look like one of those Instagram guys, other days I feel like I've put back on those 65lb literally over night and that's when I have to tell myself:

A.) That's biologically impossible.

B.) My new clothes still fit just fine and are still 10in smaller than my old ones.

C.) Get on the scale and recognize that my current BW¬±5lb is all I'm seeing.

This morning was one of those dysmorphic days and a random co-worker mentioned in the elevator that I looked like I'd lost weight over the holidays. Funny how we can be our own worst critics at times."

fatlogic,fdmkeai,t1_fdmk0p2,1578553189.0,"I do feel really good. Or rather, I notice the difference when I don't run and how lethargic I get when I don't get it in.

It took building up to that for sure cardio wise over the course of 6 months. I used to just lift 60-90min/day, 6 day/wk. I was 280 lb at 30% bf and didn't understand why I didn't look like the other guys in the gym.

Started restricting calories and **slowly** increased cardio. When I noticed how much literally **any** cardio had on my weightloss I kinda went crazy with it and really pushed myself.

In my experience, if you're trying to just lose weight, I think a good caloric deficit and a decent cardio routine to further extend that deficit works well. Muscle building and weightlifting can come after.

If I'm bulking then I only run 20mi/wk MAX which is basically 30min/day.

Also helps that I find running to be very meditative in general. Some good music and I fall into pace with muscle memory and I just zone out."

I also lift 45-60min/day, 5 days/wk, and if I go back to my failure routine then I normally burn around 4,000-4,250Cal/day on those days. This is how I do my cuts. They're quick at about -2.5lb/wk and I'm getting ready to go back into one for a 20lb loss by the beginning of April."

It's honestly laughable that people think they need to hate the food AND themselves while losing weight. Just weigh your food and track calories.
