In it I have a geocaching kit that has tweezers, spare logs, spare containers, pencils, pencils, trash bags, and a pencil sharpener.  I like to go out to the woods for caches, so I like to do maintenance if I can to help out cache owners.  In the kit bag I've also got a couple spare poop bags for dog.  GPSr, charging pack for phone, snacks, water, CCW(coyote attacks happen from time to time, didn't carry this in the woods until I lost a pet to a coyote), and a pocket knife.  Sometimes I'll carry a trackable, but I lost one once and feel bad so I don't grab them unless they have been stuck for a long time.

As far as finding caches, They can be hard to find in different ways.  Once that I did was a lord of the rings theme one.  Where you had to gather all the hobbits to find out where to find all the dwarfs and so on until you found about 20 caches.  Then those final caches had clues to where the final cache was.  Took about 40 hours to get them all.  So I'd say that was hard.  But other ones require scuba gear or climbing equipment.

Lastly, I like to cache alone with my dog.  I'll go from time to time with my wife but she is some bad luck lol.

That said, for probably the first 5 years I cached I just went out with my phone, pen, and water.  Once I started going longer and deeper into the woods I got a garmin."

Not only am I extensively trained  in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United  States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your  miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the  price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will  drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*

Then this is a variation of it:

>What in Davy Jones’ locker did ye just bark at me, ye scurvy  bilgerat? I’ll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven  seas, and I’ve led numerous raids on fishing villages, and raped over  300 wenches.

Unions use collectivism to increase negotiation leverage for those they represent.  I don't think they try and hide that ever.  They are an essential balance in monopolistic and oligopolistic markets.  Since free market thrives on competition, unions are really one of the few tools workers have in constrained markets.  As the businesses become more consolidated and power concentrates, the only way for employees to keep leverage is to also become more consolidated and concentrate their leverage into a union.  After all, they can't just go and work for the competition like most employees who want to increase their pay/benefits/etc.
