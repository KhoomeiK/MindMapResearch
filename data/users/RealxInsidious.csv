You also arent responsible for raising your family, each person can and should have a choice on what they do. Its not your fault your stuck in this situation. Just gotta keep your head high and try to breathe."

""You will love. You will hurt. You will dream. And you will die. Each man's past is your future.""

""Then what is the point,"" I asked, ""if all has been seen and done?""

""The question"", she replied, ""is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your choice. You cannot pick the destination, only the path."""
BPD,fdrbu3f,t1_fdr82kd,1578682257.0,"Yea yelling is almost never beneficial in my opinion. Trying to normalize an unethical way of arguing because he endured it in past relationships and childhood likely, is just incredibly saddening to see. Just out of compassion for other humans. I just hate to see people stuck in a toxic mindset and not be able to accept change because of unchallened notions about life and such.  Just disheartening to see."
BPD,fdrazty,t1_fdr9jb6,1578681961.0,"People tend to attack their own weaknesses in others so they prove to everyone else they arent scared when in reality they are terrified. 

Its important to remember that everybody is human, everyone makes mistakes. Hes still a person same as everyone else. While this man needs help and some serious reframing mentally, do try not to demonize him. Its easy to do that against people we hate, but in the end when we hate like them, we stoop to their level. 

You dont need anyone to be happy. While BPD makes it harder, youve gotta rely on you and your own. Otherwise, in my opinion, you cant enjoy relationships and life to its fullest."
BPD,fdr69z9,t1_fdqp6em,1578680108.0,He sounds more broken than most of us do lmao. Imagine belittling people by imitating them at their most vulnerable.

SandersForPresident,fcy1nqn,t1_fcxv5cl,1578073493.0,Hes not even posting sources even after saying his sources are 100 percent correct. Yet we are spreading disinformation lmao

SandersForPresident,fcy11zu,t1_fcxoqi9,1578073264.0,"So youre effectively arguing the opposite of your point now. Your argument said he voted against the russian sanctions. True. However its not just russian sanctions. Its russian and iran sanctions. Hes for the russian sanctions, hes against inflaming Iran more than necessary since Trump has already done that. What exactly are you trying to prove. Your original statement said he was the only person which also isnt true. Rand Paul voted against as well. I fail to see how someone standing out against more iranian sanctions is a threat and a shame to our democracy for a probably correct statement that Iran just gonna hate us more. If you ever actually listened to interviews from people over there youd have a better understanding of their opinion of Trump and the US. Cant say I blame them. Epitome of judging people by their actions and not intent"
YouShouldKnow,fcxnxa2,t3_ejd191,1578067416.0,Aw man where did the person going saying adhd was a joke and saying the american government is filled with nazis poisioning our water supply with fluoride. I had a a whole article typed out for them on it darn.
SandersForPresident,fcxnijl,t1_fcxmx36,1578067152.0,"The goal is here to not inflame any further conflict with Iran which is exactly Bernies point. Every step we take inflames the situation over there and Bernie was literally the only one to say something about it. Its not just about placing sanctions on Russia, its about both of them. Just because Trump said he was gonna pull out of the Iran deal doesnt mean shit honestly. This is the person who wanted to nuke hurricanes, think vaccines cause cancer, and wind mills farms cause noise cancer to people nearby."

If you cared to fact check yourself even once he wasnt the sole lawmaker to vote against it, and he even says hes for the sanctions, however he believes its not the right time for that bill due to the Iran sanctions in it as well."

YouShouldKnow,fckh732,t1_fckap64,1577725253.0,Big difference between seeing someone get helped by AA to posting a citationless source that says AA hurts the majority of people. I think youre blowing this way out of proportion buddy.
