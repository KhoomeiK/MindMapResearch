LoveIslandTV,ffzc356,t1_ffy5cng,1580371666.0,"I don't know the quote exactly, but basically Sophie & Leanne were saying they talked to Nas about who he'd choose in the recoupling, Callum was kind of encouraging it and Shaughna said *""but he's just met someone he really likes, you can't ask him to pass up on that opportunity""*, they both backtracked then and said ""Oh no no, we told him not to pick us""

Later on she and Callum were talking alone, and he was saying he hoped Nas/someone would pick Sophie, because Callum lost his best friend in there in order to save Sophie, and Shaughna told him that he has to take Connor out of the equation because he's gone and she was disappointed the girls would put Nas in that position.

I totally agree with you about Callum, he's said it repeatedly that he's not good at/doesn't know how to express his feelings, just because he's not saying he's mad about her with his words doesn't mean he's not showing it in other ways.

I think he's a genuine sweet guy, the whole thing with Rebecca was that he didn't want to hurt her feelings, not that he wanted to keep his options open.

He broke up with me, apart from my first love I have never experienced heartbreak like that, I was absolutely devastated, it took me months to get over even though it was such a short-lived relationship.

That said, I have nothing but respect and admiration for him and still speak really highly of him to my friends because of his approach, he sat me down, he told me that as much as he loved spending time with me and enjoyed my company he felt that something was missing. He said that if he wrote down his ideal woman on paper, I was it but for some reason he couldn't pinpoint, he just didn't see it working out long-term.

A quote I remember is: *""I could easily spend the next year with you and we'd have the best fun, but I know it wouldn't last much longer than that and I don't want to be unfair to you""*

He was honest and direct, but very gentle and sweet about it - he suggested we try a break for a few weeks but I said no because I prefer a clean break.

It sucks to break up with someone, it sucks so much that I've never broken up with anyone since the first time I did with my first boyfriend at 14. You need to take care of your needs and emotions too, it's just as selfish to yourself to stay with someone you don't love and rob yourself of the opportunity to meet someone you really want to be with, remember that, you need to put your needs and desires first, even if it means hurting someone you really care about -- it's better for both of you in the long run.

All that said, I don't know if you have any intention to stay friends with him, if you do, please understand and be respectful towards him if he can't do that right away or ever.

There have been times I've been too tired to get up (my BF got me a weighted blanked for Christmas, I skipped the gym for nearly 2 work weeks my sleep is so deep with it), and told myself ""I'll just go to the gym after work"", but it never happens! 

It helps mentally, too, like, you already achieved something before you've even got to work."
AskMen,ff5avsq,t3_erlbbu,1579585608.0,"I have several bad date experiences but I think this one is my favourite.

Met a guy on Tinder, chatted back and forth planned to meet up at a bar. I arrived at the bar got myself a drink and texted him that I was there. He told me that he had bumped into some guys he knows through work and he was very sorry but we'd need to sit with them for a bit until they moved on. Fine.

The guys were great craic and it was really fun chatting to all of them, then they went on their way leaving me and date alone, things quickly went downhill from there... 

He mumbled a bit when he spoke, and we were in a noisy bar, he also turned his head when he was speaking so I could barely hear anything he was saying. At one point I asked him general ""get to know you"" questions and he just... sat in silence and didn't reply.

Finally, I decided it was time to leave, so we asked for the bill, this is where things went *really* downhill... The bill came, I took my purse out to may my portion... and he had fallen asleep. The waitress came over, I gave her the cash for my 2 drinks and woke him up. He gave her his card and then couldn't remember his PIN. After a few attempts the waitress said she'd come back in a bit. He proceeded to fall asleep again... She came over, he tried another card, still the wrong PIN. He fell asleep again after throwing up a little bit at the table. 

It got to a point where I gave the waitress various cards he had, and he was trying his PIN on each one, then he had a moment of clarity, said ""Hey, that's mine!"", pulled the card out of the machine and threw it across the room, he then proceeded to throw all his cards across the room.

Where I live, wait staff are treated pretty badly and not paid much at all, I knew if I left the bill it would be taken from their salary. So I went to the waitress, told her I'd paid for the 2 drinks I had and that I didn't want to just leave the bill unpaid but dude was passed out and the remainder of the bill was like €100, if it had been less I would have just paid it and left. The waitress came back, said she was paying for it herself but that he needed to come back the next day to pay it back. So I took a photo of the bill and texted it to him saying something like *""I've paid for the wine, Lucy covered yours, you'll need to go back tomorrow to pay her back, if I were you I'd include a generous tip too""*  


The short version of what happened next is a series of text messages where he had zero recollection (so he said...) of what had happened, that he'd gotten a promotion and took off from work early to celebrate, had been drinking for a few hours by the time I got there and had completely forgotten about our date until I texted that I was there (despite confirming the day before that we were still on for it). He then promised me he'd make it up to me after he went and paid the women back and to give him ""30 minutes""... Several hours later and nothing, so I messaged him ""Half an hour he says..."". He then sent me a photo he had taken of his laptop, where he had typed out (including the following grammatical errors and typos) ""im Sorry name"" Safe to say I did not reply and we never spoke again.  


The worst date I witnessed, was when I was meeting my current BF for dinner one evening, I got there a bit before him, there was a couple sitting beside me and whatever was going on there was just a *vibe* between them. They weren't speaking to each other, they were both staring at their phones and there was just some serious negative energy. I messaged my BF saying that I think the couple beside me hate each other, he replied that I couldn't infer that just from sitting there, then when he arrived, he was like ""Oh wow, they really hate each other."", they got the bill, split it, got up and left without saying a word. It is possible that one of them had just broken up with the other... But why would you choose to do it on a Friday night at a busy/popular bar, and why would you choose to stay instead of just leaving to talk it out somewhere quiet and private?  


**TL;DR** Went on a Tinder date, guy straight up didn't speak to me, was super drunk and kept falling asleep, threw up a little at the table, couldn't remember his PIN to pay for his portion of the (large) bill, sent the most bizarre ""apology"".

I'm 2 years older than her and was deep into my *""I only listen to* ***authentic*** *and* ***real*** *music""* phase. Love Story was the first song of hers I was aware of and I just completely dismissed her as another generic manufactured pop singer.

Fast forward a few years, I was really into 1989, I was going through a break-up at the time and a lot of the songs just resonated with me at that point in my life. Then she released ""Look What You Made Me Do"" from Reputation and I hated it and never gave the rest of the album a chance (a huge mistake!).

This year, my sister alerted me to the ongoing conspiracy theory that she's queer. I did some digging because I LOVE me some gossip/drama, and well, after going down that rabbit hole when blogs are referring to lyrics relating to certain events, if you don't know the song you don't have that reference. So I've gone back and listened through her albums, and now at the age of 32 am a bonefide Swiftie. I just generally have a whole newfound respect for her as a musician and business-woman. She's kind of a badass and I don't think I could name another celebrity who has mastered PR the way she has, which is probably what's most fascinating to me."
hamiltonmusical,fexqvl2,t3_eqqedd,1579434903.0,"Once. In London this summer.

I live in Dubai but am from Ireland, I was going home in September for a friend's wedding, my SO got us tickets for my birthday. It was MADNESS! My BF is English and was in the UK for work so I met him there. I flew 8 hours from Dubai to Dublin, went to my parents house, repacked, slept, got a 9am Rynair (ugh!) flight to Stanstead, then train to London, walked around London a bit, went to Hamilton (Front row on the balcony, amazing seats!). Then did more walking around London the next day before getting a flight back to Dublin at 4pm. Friends wedding was the day after that.

It was SO worth it. I wasn't sure if I should go in blind, but I'm glad I knew the soundtrack inside out before seeing it, I love the wordplay and think a lot of that would have been missed, or I would have been focused on what they were saying rather than being able to appreciate the costumes, staging and dancing."

I adapted [this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/51013/baked-oatmeal-ii/).

* Oats
* Baking powder
* Oat milk, as I don't have dairy
* Coconut oil instead of butter
* 2x eggs
* Maple syrup
* Raspberries & blueberries
* Pinch of salt

Mix everything together in a bowl, spread into an oven dish, bake for 30-40 minutes.

**Thai Curry & Coconut Rice**  
Adapted from a recipe my mum always makes. This one deffo doesn't fall under the ""healthy"" category as I used loads of coconut milk!

Coconut rice:

* Rice
* Water
* Pinch of salt
* Coconut milk

Mix in your pot, bring to the boil then let simmer for 20 minutes, leave to stand for five minutes.

Thai curry:

* Garlic
* Dash of oil
* Curry paste
* Quorn pieces
* Mix of veggies - I used red & yellow pepper and green beans

Heat oil & garlic, add curry paste, leave it for about a minute, add coconut milk for about 2 minutes, then add your protein and leave until mostly cooked, add in your veggies, and a pinch of salt and pinch of sugar.
