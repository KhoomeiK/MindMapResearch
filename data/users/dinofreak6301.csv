dbz,ffj159y,t1_ff5i0dp,1579987770.0,"No we really don’t. I don’t want this to end up like another ToP arc. I want them to take their time to finish this arc so that it can get animated properly, instead of the anime catching up and forcing Toyotaro to rush the manga"
wholesomememes,ffgitsr,t1_ffg6nwx,1579907223.0,Good* teachers are under appreciated. I’ve had multiple teachers/professors that were assholes through and through. Made my life hell but the good teachers made them easier to tolerate
gaming,ffccrt9,t1_ffccgn3,1579796655.0,"I understand that, but not sniping range far. Haven’t played MW in a bit so I don’t know if they fixed it or not, but you could sit on one side of the map and just snipe people on the other side with your shotgun. Everyone hated it"

Advice,ff8e5kn,t3_es82a8,1579674687.0,"Being nice doesn’t make you vulnerable. You’re being a dick, end of story. Watch that edge before you cut yourself. Being nice will get you further in this world than being a dick. If multiple people are telling you to change yourself then there’s likely an issue with you and not them. Change your behavior. Easier said than done, I know, but you have to work on it ASAP because as you get older people won’t tolerate your shit."
Advice,fepyvmk,t3_eqdmei,1579334934.0,Is there a particular reason you feel like you should drop out? Think about all the pros and cons before you make such a large decision. Ultimately you should have a decent paying job if you plan on dropping so you can support yourself. Decision is up to you depending on your circumstances
MovieDetails,feoyz2f,t1_fenocia,1579308444.0,Justice League has multiple scenes with Batman in the day
DCcomics,fefrkj6,t1_fefkx1l,1579063132.0,Because he was never called The Flash in any way in the DCEU
wiiu,fedv87x,t1_fed9fx0,1579020606.0,"Honestly, I never had an issue with the motion controls unless my batteries started getting low. It was my first Zelda game (ironic since canonically it’s also the first in the timeline) and it’s been my favorite ever since. BotW is neat but something about SS is so unique and just draws me back to it. The fact that it has some of the best bosses in any LoZ definitely adds to that"

college,fearo30,t3_eo9d4j,1578951618.0,"No issue with that at all. If you really feel like this is the right choice, go for it. But don’t do it without having a plan first. What do you plan on doing if/when you dropout? Are you going to be able to support yourself and keep yourself busy?"
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fe9az8t,t1_fe9agnw,1578935994.0,Except they literally reached a deal where both studios can use Spider-Man. Why would they take him back when they’re allowed to use him in their movies now
raimimemes,fe8khuy,t1_fe8k9yo,1578927173.0,"How have they not? Tobey nailed the role, Andrew did well with the shit scripts he was given, Spider-Verse is near perfection."
raimimemes,fe8dpio,t1_fe7e3w3,1578925089.0,"He’s been a joke in the MCU since his debut. If anything, Sony has been getting the character correct, regardless of their other mistakes."

Izlam,fdt2b2v,t1_fdszhbp,1578710994.0,"Nothing inherently wrong with that. It just means you should learn more about your religion, to understand why the Kabah is such a significant part of Islamic history. Once you understand more about, you’ll feel more attached to it, in a sense"

Xenoblade_Chronicles,fdfz7ib,t3_el1ak1,1578374423.0,"Possibly an unpopular opinion but idk, I think XC2 has the worst combat out of the 3 games. XC1 has a very simplistic combat system that is very easy to master, XCX improves upon XC1’s combat system in every way, and after having a similar combat system for 2 games this new style completely threw me off and I’m still not used to it"
manga,fdewg3t,t1_fdevvbi,1578348023.0,If this isn’t the final arc then whatever comes next will probably be boring as hell. There’s no Demons to slay unless Muzan creates more Demon Moons so it would more or less just be a training montage until they meet Muzan again
manga,fdevplh,t1_fdeexeh,1578347585.0,"Doubt it. They’ve set up so much for this to be the final arc, that it *not* being the final arc would be absolutely ridiculous. We’ve learned of Muzan’s weakness, got backstories to pretty much everyone, Muzan has entered his final form, the Pillars are dying, all the Demon Moons are dead, this HAS to be the finale."
shittymoviedetails,fdd6v7z,t1_fdd3euw,1578297424.0,"At least it had a fucking explanation. ROS brought him back for the sake of bringing him back, no explanation given. Shitty writing through and through"
wiiu,fdb6jwl,t1_fda9xpm,1578254392.0,"Yeah they are, and they’re virtually the same game with a tiny bit more added content and a $60 label slapped on them. Not to mention the extra $20 you have to pay for if you want to play them online."

DCcomics,fczl59j,t1_fczfois,1578103621.0,"Wonder Woman isn’t meant to be some muscled, jacked out warrior. None of the Amazons are like that in the comics or any interpretations. She looks perfectly fine the way she is"

NoStupidQuestions,fcmbjs4,t3_ehyc2d,1577769634.0,"Practice everything (all types of parkings, reversing, etc). Make sure you know *everything* about the car you’re driving in (windshield wipers, defroster, hazard lights, etc). Your instructor may try to trick you into failing. For example, before you drive they may not put on their seatbelt. If they don’t and you keep driving that’s an automatic fail. Make sure to tell them to put on their seatbelt. They may also try to tell you to turn in lanes/areas you cannot turn in. Stay calm and focus on all the signs so you know where/when you can turn. Other than that it’s all up to you and how proficient you are"
TokyoGhoul,fclmtpy,t1_fclj270,1577751488.0,Not even opinion bro it’s facts. First season was so goddamn good and then they just dropped the ball with the rest of the series. After watching the first season I always advise people to go read the manga because the rest is garbage

NoStupidQuestions,fccvdwh,t1_fccuqxv,1577603101.0,Yeah because a knife is nowhere near long or durable as wolverine’s claws. Not to mention a knife can be knocked out of your hand whereas Wolverine claws would have to be ripped off if they’re gloves and not natural like in the films.
NoStupidQuestions,fccugvw,t3_eh2xw5,1577602775.0,"Hunting and fishing? No, unless you’re like a bear who can swipe fish as they jump out of water. Fighting? Most definitely. Weapon advantage plus it adds extra distance to your attacks"

Advice,fcctju8,t3_eh2w3a,1577602462.0,"Gonna be honest, it sounds weird but not creeper weird. When you say you have a crush, it usually means on a person not on something like social media. So saying “I have a crush on your Instagram account” doesn’t really make sense, either “I like your Instagram account” or “I have a crush on you” would be less weird"
Advice,fccsnp3,t3_eh25o1,1577602165.0,"Maybe you were tired, maybe you didn’t study enough. We can’t answer why your grade dropped, but your professor can. Don’t fret about it too much, it’s completely normal for grades to drop as you continue you education. Classes will only get harder the more you progress"
funny,fcc4osy,t1_fcax7ud,1577594376.0,"Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. Other than the killing, Ben Affleck is better as Batman in every way"
funny,fcbr5mh,t1_fcaudh9,1577590058.0,"Heavily disagree. Bale was good for a realistic take but Affleck was the perfect casting for a comic book Batman. If it was Bale’s Batman in the movie there wouldn’t even be a movie because he would’ve gotten his ass kicked by thugs before even getting to challenge Superman. He could barely handle Bane, what makes you think he would even pose a threat to Superman?"
SpeedOfLobsters,fc7nq53,t3_egjqhz,1577513615.0,2 minutes is too long. At that point I’d just break the bro code and go for the one in the middle
