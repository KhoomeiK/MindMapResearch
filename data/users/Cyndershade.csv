What's sad here especially is a few things:

* The amount of your life you're going to spend sheltering yourself with these beliefs are going to rob you of more time and happiness than what just about any woman could. There are some baddies out there for sure, but the same can be said about any human (this sub is a great example!) 

* It's a real bummer to me that the folks here with the logic of being a strong and independent male also has to come with such a load of bigoted nonsense. I honestly believe the societal value of men and how we're treated on the grand scale has changed tremendously over the years, and finding value in what we can do and our contributions is more important now than ever. The critical point being that we absolutely can improve one thing without denigrating another, and this sub is not what that is at all. 

* The amount of young disenfranchised men / boys who come here looking for advice haven't necessarily had the experiences you've had, and I promise you this 150,000 user group out of the entire internet is not even *close* to a legitimate sample size for all of humanity. Telling some young kid who had a high school breakup that all women are atrocious monsters and are only good for sex is not good for anyone's mental health. If you actually believe this, understand that a part of the problem you have with women is you - if you take a big swig of a drink thinking it's going to be milk and it turns out to be dr pepper, it doesn't matter what you drank because it isn't what you wanted. 

Anyway, just a big old yikes all around from me - y'all don't even need to ban me cuz my ass is *never* coming back here. I can only hope the best of you guys go and get some help or maybe look inwards for strength instead of flailing about here in the echo chamber. There is a prevailing need to increase the average psychological and physical well being of men as a whole, and this is place is definitely not the path to it."

AskReddit,fdjngvc,t1_fdjek41,1578479451.0,">The worst one was when I was in overtime since I’m an intern and want to finish what was given for brownie points for my rating, it was 7PM and my mom was pestering me to go home and not do overtime and that ‘the boss will understand a mother’s sentiment’. That’a not how it fucking works, mom.

Not really parenting advice but some business advice, try to avoid doing extra shit for brownie points whenever possible. I know this sounds counter-intuitive but it will become a good habit in the long run for not being taken advantage of. This is like the biggest, slipperiest slope of dealing with corporate bullshit that will become a near impossible habit for you to kick, I see it in every office I visit. You tell them, ""oh yeah I can take care of it"", then they learn what you'll do for free, ask you to do more, so on and so forth in perpetuity. I had learned of this poor bastard in our IT staff that was doing about 4 jobs that would all pay 6 figure salaries for about 40k a year and when I found out it was the most depressing thing I'd ever heard. The dude just never asked for more, always did the favors no questions asked, first in the morning last out in the evening, that's no way to live. Even worse during a corporate restructure they let the guy go because he had no paper trail for all the favors he was doing for half a dozen departments, the shit is sad, moral here being 90% of businesses do not give a fuck about you with or without the brownies. 

I'm not saying this is what you're doing just yet, and since you're an intern you're already being taken for a ride (but what can you do?) - just be mindful of it. Next time someone asks you to do something extra, just think to yourself internally, ""What is this worth?"", and keep doing it. When you get a stable career option after a few years of asking yourself that question you'll probably have an answer of what your own value is, there's nothing wrong with saying: ""Yes, this time I'll take care of it but if it's going to become a part of the role permanently I'd like to discuss compensatory changes"".

No it isn't, not only is it not pedantic but it's a plan stupid assertion that clearly illustrates how ignorant you are on the subject.

And just so you know, the number isn't even 83%, the data they give you in these articles is skewed across several points, namely: population decline, *overfishing*, *over-used*, *in crisis*, etc. You'll also be sure to note that when you're making a legitimate study of something, IE the bulk total amount of something, you don't include stupid variables like this because what you linked my boy - clickbait my boy. 

Now allow me to demonstrate:

>The Earth as a planet is currently on fire, roughly 100% of the Earth has been on fire throughout its lifespan as well as about 100% of the Earth being frozen solid. What experts are telling us now is that a large portion of the Earth is currently on fire, approx 14.3% of all the continents are currently on fire with 2019 serving as a year where a whopping 85% of the continents on planet Earth were on fire. Noticeably absent however was Antarctica having no forest fires, and remained arguably frozen solid year round. 

Everything I wrote was true, but it's not useful data, you should learn the difference. Lastly, **13%** even if it was true is not pedantry, that is a *significant* difference in sample size when you're talking about literally millions of data points.

Outside of hyperbole though, if you're talkin facts and raw data, American history is an absolute fucking nightmare of overreach and 100% does not paint the picture of, ""The good guys"", because we fuckin aren't. 

There was that time we installed a whoopsie doodle dictator in the middle east, or that time we created drugs in an attempt to alienate black people, or that time where we experimented on our own soldiers with hallucinogenics, or that time where we decided war with vietnam would be cool but then lost it so we changed the official title to, 'conflict' to keep up our flawless track record, or that time we decided to go to war with Iran in the 80's for no reason, or that time we launched multiple weapons of mass destruction against a tiny island nation killing over 100,000 civilians, etc.

This sounds an awful lot like a you problem though, I figured it out in middle school when I stepped in a library worth more than 40 bucks.

pics,fdar677,t1_fdannui,1578249174.0,"Fk it, sweeping changes to how we pay for things as a nation to change how we spend / value our own time is a start. 

10% VAT on all business to business transactions from companies generating a gross over $10MM.

75% Tax on additional income for income over $10MM per fiscal, meaning if you make $12MM in one year, 75% of $2MM is taxed over and above w/e you should normally be paying for taxes.


10% cut to military expenditure and reevaluation of all non-conflict military spending and deployments (IE, soldiers don't need to be in Japan right now etc. etc.).

Sweeping governmental oversight changes, removing special interests from politics and legislating out lobbies for congressional spending loopholes. 

Corporate tax incentives for enforcing a 4 day week with a 32 hour work week cap for all general labor roles as well as clerical (office work), this is a mental health win but I think we need it pretty badly as a nation.

Tax incentives for pro-civilian and pro-veteran assistance programs, for instance: Say you made $12MM but you don't want to pay 75% of the tax on the $2MM you made over the wealth cap, maybe you send $1MM to a regulated charity for civilians or veterans and you can keep the rest, moving your tax rate from 75% to 50% for the year. 

Complete retooling of the IRS, currently their strategy for recouping tax losses is a bottom-to-top methodology, meaning they go for the smallest amounts possible (this is actually around $10,000) from people who likely aren't dodging paying taxes as much as literally can't afford it, and move it to a middle-out methodology. There's people out there who owe 7 figure numbers to uncle sam and will die before they pay any of it, they've admitted as much because it's ""hard to go after them"". I'd like to staff the IRS with diligent legal counsel that gets an incentive based on amounts they recoup from hard-to-win tax settlements, gaining a percentage of their settlement as a cash bonus. 

The above tax will aid in paying for things that concern themselves with the general welfare of the American people, namely: health care, education for well paced students, skilled trade schools for those who don't pace well or prefer to have a hands on career, work value stipends for families with 1 breadwinner, beefing up general welfare programs (let's make food stamps buy diapers etc), the list goes on. 

The biggest concern most middle-class working Americans have with protesting is their time is so precious, I'd work to give some of it back and remove some of the reasons people protest right now. This is all various pipe dreams but I think about it a lot, so here you go."
