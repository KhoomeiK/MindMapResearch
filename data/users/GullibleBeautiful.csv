Plus, we don’t even know for sure that this lady knew the guy was married... maybe she did, or maybe the jilted spouse assumed she did and she actually didn’t know. The only thing we have to go on is one persons interpretation of events. Either way, putting up a sign to shame the home wrecker is trashy and stupid. Your husband cheated, and frankly the woman he cheated with is irrelevant because if he’d cheat with her, he’d cheat with someone else too."

morbidquestions,ffbcb8o,t1_ff9y2rp,1579759414.0,"I'm fairly certain that actual child porn and other horrible stuff exists on sites like Pornhub but it's not something you'd be able to actually look up and find easily. On Youtube, there are people who regularly upload stuff that's against the ToS (usually porn or full movies) but you'd have to do some serious digging (or be linked directly) to find it. It's not like you'd be able to find child porn by looking up ""child porn"" in the search bar but you could probably find it accidentally by going down a rabbithole and just clicking the weirdest videos you can find until you stumble upon something horrible. That's how a pretty large and weird ring of pseudo-pedos got outed a couple years ago... someone actually did that exact thing on Youtube and stumbled upon a goldmine of creepy content.

A lot of these porn sites are huge and won't actually touch content unless it gets reported. Because there's just no physical way to comb through every minute of footage that gets posted there, so it's easier to just assume that the majority of your audience is moral and just enough to report illegal content for removal.

justdependathings,ff7qrh2,t1_ff72nzk,1579656078.0,"It's stupidly easy to get out of being sent to the psych ward unless she has real, concrete evidence of his suicidal threats (like texts or something). Even then, a three day max stint at a hospital is not going to magically fix him if he doesn't want the help. All you have to do is lie about your problems and pretend everything is fine, and act confused as to why you've even been admitted.

I've been to the hospital numerous times myself and seen people who were blatantly unwell pull this tactic off successfully. Unless they have your entire medical history and some solid proof, you can smile your way out of a psych hold."
justdependathings,ff7q9zk,t1_ff7iicl,1579655739.0,"I don't think a lot of people commenting here understand the way some people use suicide threats as a legitimate emotional abuse tactic. My ex FREQUENTLY threatened suicide (even going as far as to make legitimate attempts) to keep me reeled into the relationship. Abusers do this to get what they want out of a relationship. It sounds an awful lot like the guy would use suicide threats as a way of avoiding having responsibilities in a divorce, and/or a cheap scare tactic to get property/custody he doesn't deserve. 

The only way to effectively end these cycles of abuse is to just cut the cord and walk away from the abuser. There is a small chance they'll follow through but what is more likely is that they'll try to linger in your life and drain your soul dry. People are acting like the only possible scenario is that the wife is a psychopath... it seems like she could also be escaping a psychopath who insists that if she doesn't surrender what is rightfully hers, he will kill himself and make it look like her fault."

AfterTheLoop,ff7p7c3,t1_ff77i4x,1579654981.0,"The problem with that theory is that at the VERY BEST, he would have witnessed open and blatant pedophilia and continued to hang around him knowing what was happening. The people who have come out and spoken about their experiences with Epstein have made it abundantly clear that there was almost no time in the day when he didn't have underaged girls in his presence. 

He scheduled ""massages"" with minors 3x a day minimum. He had a former ""masseuse"" as a secretary whose entire job was just recruiting and booking underage girls to be raped by him. His ""girlfriend"" Ghislane Maxwell also recruited and entrapped women as well. He was constantly surrounded by his filth. Girls were coming and going from his various properties at all hours of the day and night. He brought along young girls to his private island. It's noted in a couple different flight logs (iirc mandatory world-wide to fly anywhere) that Prince Andrew was on board when these minors were flying.

Like I said, it's really hard to believe that Andrew was just a poor clueless dolt who had no idea what was actually happening. I mean, Epstein openly toted around these visibly underage girls for ""massages"" and allegedly told the girls to give guests ""massages"" if they so wished. At the bare minimum, a minor should not be even legitimately giving a gross old man back rubs, and it should raise some serious questions if the company you're with is participating in that. 

There is an accuser with photographic evidence of Prince Andrew's arm around her (at the time a minor) and Ghislane Maxwell is also in the pic. This same accuser has listed numerous participants and Andrew was one of the most prolific of the abusers in this child sex ring. Could she be lying? Possibly, but considering the total brick wall of power and money she's up against even after his death, I doubt it would be worth attempting. Plus, literally dozens of women have corroborated and testified to basically the same story without ever having met each other, so there's that.

Again, best case scenario is that he cared so much about his friendship with Epstein that child sex trafficking was an ignorable offense. Which is incredibly disturbing and a bad look for the royal family."
