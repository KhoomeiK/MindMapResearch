depression,ff4bjuh,t3_eriz5y,1579559767.0,Find a short lady and be done with it. Fall in Love with the search you're worth whatever work it takes to be happy!
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fep1opw,t3_eq7g87,1579310155.0,Don't sweat it. It will come back with vengeance. You've lost nothing. Give your body and mind some time to heal and you come out the other side all brand new and probably better
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,feo3vzw,t3_eq2t1i,1579294758.0,Yes. I never felt like I deserved love while in active addiction. I've ruined every relationship I've even been in this way during active addiction..
Opiatewithdrawal,fekgh42,t3_epncf6,1579199542.0,In my experience with a proper taper it negates 95 percent of it. But if you take them and just stop it's an opiate ass well. But it depends on how long and how much and all that jazz.

depression,fegp2ot,t3_eoxun3,1579099161.0,I get this so much. Change can be a cruel mistress.. BUT life can be beautiful. But that beauty is always just outside of your comfort zone. Be open to that path.
depression,fefcfp8,t3_eork3x,1579053291.0,The realization that this is all for nothing did in fact make me depressed for sometime. But it's getting better.

AskReddit,feeuohq,t3_eondj6,1579041601.0,Is it weird that I was thinking you could probably drink a 12 pack a day and not even be an alcoholic? lol I don't drink anymore which is probably for the better haha

researchchemicals,fe7qsru,t1_fe7j4s0,1578918106.0,LOL why don't you just say you don't like it. Instead of trying to convince anyone that you know what you're talking about.  Because clearly you have no clue. An opinion is ok. Preaching about things you don't like or understand is dumb.
researchchemicals,fe2t9t5,t1_fe2e7y6,1578842617.0,Or redosed several times without remembering. I'm a chronic black out redoser.
researchchemicals,fe2ruy1,t3_enk41p,1578842207.0,"Flush whatever you have left and take a month off. Or finish whatever you have left and take 2 months off.

Addiction is something to toy with. I know all to well. Not about this particular substance. But every other one lol.  It's a quick way to flush alot of time and life down the drain my friend. I wish someone would have said this to me when I was first chipping at my habit. Good luck to you my friend. Reach out if you need help!"
