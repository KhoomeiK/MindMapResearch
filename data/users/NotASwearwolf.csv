I think ""Satan's work"", is more accurately descriptive in contemporary speech, as modern Satanism is an established (anti-)religion, philosophical system, and civil disobedience organization. More specifically, the largest (the only large) Satanic organisation is the Church of Satan (aka LaVeyan Satanists). They are philosophically Epicurian and believe Satan is a representation of certain human characteristics, rather than a diety. There have been short lived cults of theist Satanists who worship Satan as a diety and perform what are colloquially known as Satanic Rituals (human sacrifice, ritual orgy, etc), like Charles Manson's, though they're often just manipulation tactics like most cults.

On Epicurianism (basis of LaVeyan Satanist philosophy) from Wikipedia: ""Epicurius believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable ""pleasure"" in the form of a state of tranquility and freedom from fear (ataraxia) and absence of bodily pain (aponia) through knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of our desires.""

It also sounds rougher than mine, in that there's not much you can do while you're having an attack.

Tl;dr: teens *can* understand these complex issues, but they will almost certainly not think about them unless you explicitly inform them of the current situation. Teaching kids from the frame of mind of anything but *where the world is at right now* is doing them a disservice.

>as a parent of teens I can assure you their attitude towards internet privacy is they don't care.

Do they understand the scope of mass data collectionand the reasoning behind it? It's easy to forget that teens literally aren't aware of a good deal of things; they're like toddlers: they don't know things that they aren't told, except with toddlers they don't know physical stuff while teens don't know the esoteric stuff. 

I'm confident they have the mental faculties to understand that companies want to know as much as they can about you because it makes making money easier for them, but unleas you explicitly tell them these things why would they stumble upon that? They can understand that the more someone knows about you, the easier it is to predict your actions. They can understand the slippery slope that is a global corporation predicting your and millions of other people's actions in the pursuit of maximising profits. They won't reach these ideas on their own; it is your responsibility to teach your children (or at least *inform* them) what they *need* know (or be aware of).

All of this isn't to say you don't inform your children of important things. It is just a trend I've observed in elementary school aged kids' folks. They expect them to learn everything they need to know at school, from social skills and basic decency to cooking and cleaning up after one's self to math and history. This complaint is just an extension of that. It's a shifting of responsibility, when that responsibility rests entirely on the parental units. That is, parental units have a moral obligation to teach their children the skills and information they need to survive in their current atmosphere, not the skills and information the parents needed when they were children. We're in such a time of flux, advice becomes outdated in a decade or less. You need to keep pace with the current reality or you do a disservice to your spawn when they come into society without the knowledge they need."

You cannot learn to lockpick on these clear acrylic locks. You can learn the basic mechanics of simple locking mechanisms and how a lock with standard pins works overall, but that's it (and tou can do that just by watching [YouTube] videos anyway. And those are free). Every individual lock is different from eachother anyway, and these are literally designed to be easy to open. If you practice on these locks and try to transfer your newfound ability to the field, you would take ages to get your first open, and that's assuming you don't encounter a non-Master brand lock that cost more than 10 dollars (something that has security pins). Learning to single pin pick on these, you end up relying on visual information (which doesn't exist on real locks); learn to rake with these and you have the detriment of training on a lock designed to let you in, instead of designed to keep you out.

Just go buy a standard hook, a long hook, a bogota rake, and an s/wave rake (and an L/city rake if you want). Then go buy some crappy masterlocks and other cheap locks (visit r/lockpicking for recommendations) to practice on. Once you can spp and rake them, buy the next step up and continue while still also practicing on your easier locks. Remember to buy things like door locks as well (thrift stores are good for cheap access), and once you are quite comfortable with P&T locks, try some dimple and wafer locks.
