I like how someone in the comments put it. With the MC being a control type playstyle, it's as if we're getting a story with Kraugel as the MC instead of Grid. Combat scenes have been nice, the balance of the situations removed me from the story a couple times and made me scratch my head but that's par for the course with these stories i think.

In some cases  they aren’t really purchasing the items since the payment goes right  back to them, but in others they may be using your own debt/credit  card/pay-pal to pay themselves.

You're only fucked if you have serious medical issues, or need to go to the doctor constantly for a disease or something, or have to get any surgery.

Granted, with something like healthcare, yea you want it to be there for those times you do need it. But my point is that if you were to look at a lifetime of paying 40% of your taxes to have all that covered for the country, versus how many times will I actually need to get some medical work done? On average, the health american will have much more of their income than a health canadian.

On a countrywide basis, this means shit and the US is fucked(obviously), but on an individual one(bearing in mind you're healthy), which is the perspective people are talking from, it matters."

Canadians get taxed like 60% of their income and even then some things aren't covered. Your usual healthcare packages come to like 200\~ a month depending on the packages you get. Yes, we have to pay copay on top of that when we go but most are just 50 bucks and last year i only went to the doctor twice. My meds were 10 bucks and i had to get a mri that was 250.
