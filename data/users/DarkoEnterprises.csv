When he does poop, put the poop in the litter box and then put him in as well with his face towards it so he gets a whiff. Different things work for different ferts, just keep trying. We have 6, and all but one is usually pretty good about using the box. We are still trying to figure out how to get the last one with the program."

It seems quite hypocritical with how much they want everyone to accept them for how they identify. I'm sorry you are in this situation. Sounds like you need to decide wether you are going to grin and bear it and continue to let them believe you haven't changed, or announce to your group that you can no longer continue on with the charade but anyone who wants to keep in contact is more than welcome and then cut your losses.

AskReddit,fe3xku8,t3_enqqyu,1578853792.0,"Was working construction at a casino that used to be a notoriously bad residential school on a reservation. We were excavating a foundation for a giant concrete pad, so the tribe had a archeologist on site to monitor our activity and look for any artifacts or bodies we might dig up. We were working away when he suddenly clutched his chest and slumped against the bank. We all went running over to him for him to just tell us it was indigestion or something and he was fine. Well we slowly returned to work and about 20 minutes later, he again clutches his chest, screams and then falls face first into the dirt. We stayed with him until the ambulance got there, but I'm pretty sure he died at the hospital from a massive heart attack. 

He probably smoked two packs A day while on site and A couple days later we found his coffee cup and it was filled with straight whiskey. So it wasnt a huge surprise that he croaked."

Advice,fe3sk6c,t3_enqra4,1578852484.0,"If you stop identifying as whatever you identify as, will it ruin your marriage? People grow and change their interests all the time. I would imagine the people who are into that sort of thing have to be fairly open minded, so if you decide you are done with it but still respect that they aren't, it shouldnt make them hate you. Find new things to be passionate about and then find other people who are as passionate about said thing, just like your ""otherkin"" friends.
