racistpassdenied,ffajvse,t1_ff9qorp,1579737552.0,Hard to say personally given how over used the word is by blacks I think its lost some power yea if someone calls you it you can be upset but at the same time if you just spent 30 mins calling your friend who is also black nigger you dont get to act like someone just stuck a knife in your back or punched your baby in the face. The oddest interaction I've had with the word nigger was from 3 black kids at KFC I'm there eating Nashville tenders which can make me sneeze. The kids are in the booth next to me n this n that takking about getting a 4th grader high at a party I'm cringing as I hear this. I sneeze all 3 stop look at me and go god bless you. I thanked them but still sat there wonder how can kids be talking the way there were and still be kind enough to say god bless you when someone sneezes lol

Gunpla,ff2l6ks,t1_ff2k8rz,1579511311.0,It's a issue with how the suits work. In seed the gat series the main chars use as well as freedom and justice use phase shift armor so the weathering people use ie damage and scrapes on the paint wouldn't happen. Some parts can be weathered like the strikes packs and shields they dont start gray so their normal items and such.

UpliftingNews,ff2fmzy,t1_ff2dq7i,1579504107.0,Yes insurance is the reason hospitals charge $50 for a tylenol version its actual cost. They charge what they know insurance will pay. Think universe will be better? Look at Medicare and their billing not to mention fraud that plagues it.

UpliftingNews,ff2fd2y,t1_ff2djlx,1579503790.0,That was basically an illegal tax the creators are on tape talking about how they had to lie about it to get it passed. And the rates were going up under obama as well so that's a meaningless comparison.

UpliftingNews,ff2cuzf,t1_ff2bovs,1579501056.0,And? As of yet trump didn't change ACA so blaming him doesnt mean anything since obama didn't give universal payer either. Personally we dont really need universal payer we need hospitals themselves fixed. The fees they charge is why insurance is to fucked up.

AskReddit,ff26wr9,t1_ff234s8,1579495531.0,They 50 mini nations. While it may seem off most of the power in the us belongs to the states in fact it's made clear in the constitution that if it is not specifically stated as a federal power it belongs to the states. Its muddy because over our history people put more importance on fed so states have given more and more power to the fed. Most in power didn't care as one you go beyond local city level gov to state level 99% of politicians have dreams of bigger things ie congress. So no one wants to fix the federal level which is entirely doable by states because they all see it as being their power when they get to the fed level.most of the states powers are still the states but funding has become reliant on the fed so you have case like education which is entirely a state power but because shuts gone so stupid states shifted to getting a massive chunk of funding from the fed. Over all it's a cluster fuck. The federal government was basically only around to deal with the military and foreign affairs some other issues as well but the founders wanted the states to be the true power.

gaming,fepkama,t1_fepi8h7,1579322710.0,For business uses not consumer.  Business pay way more and will have access to gear most people would never be able to afford. Do you know what drove most computer and internet dev? Games. Realistically for home use an IBM xt was more then enough even for most office use. You dont need a 3990x and a 2080gtx with 64g ram to do office work(most office work) web and net wise the drivers were games and entertainment. A consumer driven need for better and better tracking and interacts that those type of gloves need require killer apps to expand vr uptake in the home which like it or not is still a objectively unimportant % at the moment. I understand your view but this is my view on it based on history that I see.
gaming,fephe9p,t1_feoyd0h,1579320549.0,No that delay is because demand just isnt there. What vr needs is a true killer app which will be the hard part but is still in the range of possible. Sadly I dont see it coming from vive or index class headsets thenoverhead  is a limiting factor. The true killer app will likely have to come from an improved quest or the other standalone that allows body tracking maybe if combined with a small chrome book like device that you can have the tracking data offloaded to for handling and maybe ar so you can do multiplayer stuff out in parks.

China has 3k fighters Taiwanese 400 plus I assume a shut ton and a half of stingers. I'd also wager their mil gear noticeably better and the training is likely better since you focus way more on it if it's to defend your home and loved ones. Not to mention as much as poo bear has done to fight corruption we know 1 it is against rivals which doesnt mean the allegations against them aren't true 2 only clearly uncoverable if their his own faction and 3 that's just a lot of people the vast majority likely just do it for a paycheck and to keep the party happy so I'd wager quite a bit of training is paper whipped to stay on the good side and to allow corruption by steals funds and equipment.

That insurance would have to be paid for which means much MUCH higher taxes the companies would be on the hook for increased tax rates as would you. So your net income would likely be LOWER then before. And being a gov run system(look at Medicare) fraud would be an insanely massive issue. Make no mistake most peoples net income would go down quite a lot for most people as the taxes to pay for everything sanders wants would have to go up a lot. Fyi the rich wont pay it dont kid yourselves they will find loop holes or some nation will make a very attractive offer to the super rich which will have them and their money leaving. Look at several dem states  several have lost quite a few rich people because of the taxes. Throw a wealth tax on and you will again see a lot find loopholes and or leave the us with their money.
