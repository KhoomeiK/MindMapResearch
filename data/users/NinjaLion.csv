AskReddit,ffgmyoz,t1_ffgjrm0,1579909991.0,"[There are 10,355 Community Housing & Homeless Shelters businesses in the US as of 2019.](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/community-housing-homeless-shelters-united-states)

1/5 of the homeless-on-one-night population is in california (20%) when california represents 15% of the population, so it is not as disproportionate is you make it seem. So lets get that out of the way.

Also worth knowing that the amount of people that will experience homelessness during a given year [is roughly 3.5 million people.](https://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/How_Many.html)

There are also roughly [10,000 homeless sheltering places in the united states](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/community-housing-homeless-shelters-united-states).

For your claim to be true, each shelter would have to house 55 people, which is not astronomical, but i would wager it is above the average number of beds in a homeless shelter. I could certainly be wrong in that, but data for it is hard to come by.

>  **Rates of decline in biodiversity in this sixth mass extinction match or exceed rates of loss in the five previous mass extinction events in the fossil record.[220][221][222][223][224][225][226] Loss of biodiversity results in the loss of natural capital that supplies ecosystem goods and services. From the perspective of the method known as Natural Economy the economic value of 17 ecosystem services for Earth's biosphere (calculated in 1997) has an estimated value of US$33 trillion (3.3x1013) per year.[227]**
> 
> In 2019, a summary for policymakers of the largest, most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and ecosystem services, the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, was published by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. The report was finalized in Paris. The main conclusions:
> 
> 1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.
> 
> 2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution, and invasive species. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from consumption to governance.
> 
> 3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's Sustainable Development Goals for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans, and land. It can cause problems with food, water and humanity's air supply.
> 
> 4. To fix the problem, humanity will need a transformative change, including sustainable agriculture, reductions in consumption and waste, fishing quotas and collaborative water management. On page 8 the report proposes on page 8 of the summary "" enabling visions of a good quality of life that do not entail ever-increasing material consumption"" as one of the main measures. The report states that ""Some pathways chosen to achieve the goals related to energy, economic growth, industry and infrastructure and sustainable consumption and production (Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, 9 and 12), as well as targets related to poverty, food security and cities (Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2 and 11), could have substantial positive or negative impacts on nature and therefore on the achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals""[228][229]"

So to view the whole comment with context

> Nobody likes him *(his co-senators)* Nobody wants to work with him *(because he is a party outsider)* he got nothing done *(in his senate legislative career, compared to other senate careers like her own)* He was a career politician *(not a true outsider like his supporters often believe)* Its all just bolony and i feel so bad for the people who fell for it *(his supporters that think he will be able to do a lot as president without one party or the other standing behind him.)*

and its clear there is **SOME** truth to the first part of her statement, which was taken in the context of his senate co-representatives.

Now, as a Bernie fan, you could read his lower amount of Senate accomplishment and popularity with other Senators as a strength, putting him against the establishment, and that would be reasonable. But it doesnt make her statement untrue."

Yeah definitely, but the difference for the vast majority of hardware is not going to show itself. the gamersnexus testing for the case shows this [here](https://www.gamersnexus.net/images/media/2016/cases/s340-elite/nzxt-s340-elite-gpu-temps.png) where its clearly not as good in the cooling department... but by a very small margin in real world numbers. ~~And this is without a tower cooler~~ Edit: Misread. and they do recommend a tower cooler, (which is a pretty standard thing for overclocking, the only time thermals start to matter), which they say will solve most of the cooling concerns. Shit, even to quote their conclusion on the case

> Let’s be real: As an enclosure, the S340 Elite is competitive. It’s $100 – fairly unbeatable, given its features list and price. There’s not much nearby competition.

so clearly there is some real strength to the case overall

> Edit: The s340 is an older case and no longer for sale.

Youre right, its been replaced by the H500 which reviews almost exactly the same by gamersnexus [here](https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3309-nzxt-h500-case-review-thermals-noise-vs-s340) with the added comment

> This is a successor that compares favorably to the older versions

and its also $70, cheaper than the meshify and old s340

From the review of the meshify C, the thermal advantage is pretty context dependent and relies on you spending extra money on case fans:

Does that clear things up for you? as a native to that wonderful state you probably know humidity is not a problem there and the average temperature is 70 fucking degrees. Hes not talking about NWA, nobody is fucking talking about your stupid goddamn state. This whole thread is talking about areas that are dying off and have nothing to do for work but grind away at 3 shithole jobs. stop being such a defensive tit over knockoff Kansas."

This is the comment i was replying to, if this doesnt describe your area then congratulations, but it describes mine perfectly. The only jobs that existed came from those 3 companies, and they sucked so hard people would leave as soon as possible or do drugs if they couldnt leave. It also describes almost every industry town in the northwest that is dying.

Okay. assuming both of these are true, its pretty damn clear that youre region is not what im talking about, and definitely an exception. Its also very hard to believe that hundreds of thousands of people moved to NWA because of the amazing jobs at ""walmart, tyson, or the gut plant"", and not for other reasons.

Shit, even to quote their conclusion on the case

> Letâ€™s be real: As an enclosure, the S340 Elite is competitive. Itâ€™s $100 â€“ fairly unbeatable, given its features list and price. Thereâ€™s not much nearby competition.

so clearly there is some real strength to the case overall

> Edit: The s340 is an older case and no longer for sale.

Youre right, its been replaced by the H500 which reviews almost exactly the same by gamersnexus [here](https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3309-nzxt-h500-case-review-thermals-noise-vs-s340) with the added comment

Does that clear things up for you? as a native to that wonderful state you probably know humidity is not a problem there and the average temperature is 70 fucking degrees.

This is the comment i was replying to, if this doesnt describe your area then congratulations, but it describes mine perfectly. The only jobs that existed came from those 3 companies, and they sucked so hard people would leave as soon as possible or do drugs if they couldnt leave. It also describes almost every industry town in the northwest that is dying.

>I have watched as this place grew from a few cities of 20k - 30k each into a large region of over 500,000 and still growing

> NWA is a very prosperous area


Okay. assuming both of these are true, its pretty damn clear that youre region is not what im talking about, and definitely an exception. Its also very hard to believe that hundreds of thousands of people moved to NWA because of the amazing jobs at ""walmart, tyson, or the gut plant"", and not for other reasons. Or that those are actually the only 3 jobs in the area that pay 12-16hr."

A much more reasonable approach would be hand in hand sanctions and diplomatic action with our allied nations (similar to the very effective sanctions done against Russia) and a major MAJOR investment in other nations to supply our goods ethically(which is exactly what China is doing with Africa).
