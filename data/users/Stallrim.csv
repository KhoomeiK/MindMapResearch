netflixwitcher,ffco8jh,t3_edypfl,1579803670.0,"I don't care what religion, ethnicity etc they cast, but atleast cast someone accurate to the books description or atleast write her in that way, show triss literally lack personality, idk who's fault is that as I am not in show business, merely a viewer, but there's definately someone's at fault. Even tho I was skeptical of anya as yennefer before, she has that yennefer personality in the show, she gives off those yennefer vibes perfectly, but triss character is horrible, she just don't give off those triss vibe it might be the writer's fault, caster's fault, because her acting was good but she felt like some other random soceress, I was reading blood of elves earlier and  triss ciri conversation just reminded me how bad triss was done in the show, I even saw some game triss video and she's really well done in the games. I hope they atleast write her really well next time, but it would be better to recast her."

celebnsfw,ff3jz8w,t1_fezhaoz,1579542664.0,"Dude she actually nailed it tbh, she might not look like the book yennefer I imagined, (Eva Green would have been perfect cast but she's old now and that's a conversation for another time), She actually did a great job than any other actors imo, her acting made me think, okay I get it why they choose her.

Here's how I think would've been better, two episodes per short story of 1 hour length each, with some ciri, yennefer parallel plot."
netflixwitcher,fdinawf,t1_fdii95p,1578446726.0,"Really man, this show deserved at least 10-13 episodes instead of  most of those marvel shows which struggled with pacing, the season could've have got so much breathing space if it had 10-13 episodes.

StopGaming,fd7jsjt,t3_ek1n9f,1578205614.0,"My man, how long are the breaks? it really wont hurt to play games in the break unless you cant stop to play them after school too, convince some friends of yours, there are always two or three guys who get convinced easily and find some extra curicular activity for your small non gaming group, find some activity where there are girls in them, you know for motivation. Music or theater, dance maybe, anyhing that intrests you or you are curious about. I am sure there might be many other things than games that might intrest you. Swimming is a good alternative too, to cool of.

You can do it my man, and you'll be so pleased that you stopped gaming this early on in life. All the best!"

Earlier whenever I used to see those posts of love yourslef, I used to think what a load of bullshit but when you hit rock bottom you realise you were wrong about so many things.

Till now  me and my sister decided to just ignore her, focus on our future and career. And I won't be moving out of the city because of her, but because I have a course to attend to in that particular city, that helps me with my career, with my life, never lived out on my own, still lives with parents, and also it would help me with my mental state. I want to experience and see how it goes without parents. Yes it will be hard, but it won't be constant bitching around for every small things that happen, now my mom is actually a sweet heart, it's just she worry about literally every small obstacle that comes in her way, and makes everything about her.

selfimprovement,fcmcpa1,t1_fcltaw7,1577770654.0,"This, I am 23 and mostly disappointed with myself, over thinking, mostly on the negative sides, it comes from my mom she is sooo damn negative and never leaves her small comfort zone and won't let me and sis do it too, the reason I never share shit with her because I know she'll always knock down anything I did or will do with her negativity,  this is a very vicisious cycle, the fact that there are always atleast couple of negative thoughts before going out of my house to do anything is really depressing and spirit killing. This lead to Video Games and TV series addiction to constantly ignore the reality that I live in and live in my own reality for the peace of mind. I am getting better tho slowly by realising on my own what's wrong with me. First I was really confused for what was happening with me, now I know the one most toxic person in my life that I Love and hate at the same time the most, has to be  gone from my life, I am just waiting for my college to finish once it's done, I am fucking off from my city.
