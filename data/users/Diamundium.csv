A company saying “we did this to prevent further risk to the company” and “we care for her well being” are both politically correct statements that would have no grounds for a lawsuit. They chose the disingenuous route rather than be real about why they did it. That was my whole argument.

I’m glad a big grown adult came by to tell all us children how the real world is, we’d be lost without you. Thanks for enlightening us."

Suspend her for a few days and give her a stern warning. It would have accomplished the same thing without hindering the well-being of the employee they supposedly care so much about."

dankmemes,feo05y7,t1_fenxxab,1579293343.0,"It's taken on a much more specific meaning because it supports the narrative that white people can't experience racism. I think it's important to take a step back and realize that just because certain white people mistreated black people decades before I was born, that does not in any way mean you can treat me poorly based on the color of my skin and consider yourself free of wrongdoing. Regardless of what you call it, it's wrong. 

Operating under any other definition of a word than it's actual definition makes no sense to me. We don't just get to spontaneously decide a word has a new or different meaning. Merriam-Webster takes into account historically different interpretations of words, hence why they have multiple definitions. 

If we truly, TRULY want equality in this world, we cannot start changing what words mean to justify the things we do. In the same why I will never fully understand what systemic racism is like, minority individuals will never know what it's like to be told that you should feel bad about being white when you had nothing to do with the history that precipitated your existence. I'm tired of being told white people shouldn't have a voice in the equality movement. It's pure hypocrisy, and people need to step back and ask themselves what they are truly advocating; special treatment of minorities, or true equality? 

That's my two cents. As much as a white person can never understand what it's like to be a minority individual, the opposite is every bit as true."
dankmemes,fenxdoz,t1_fenw87g,1579292190.0,"That's the thing, you aren't broadening it's definition, you're narrowing it. Cutting out pieces of a definition does not give it a wider or brand new meaning. We don't get to cherry pick the parts of a definition that fit our narrative and leave out the rest and call it fact. 

I 100% agree that white people do not experience systemic racism. There is no denying that form of racism is solely reserved for minority individuals, and i won't pretend I've ever experienced it. But when I have an african american girl call me a ""fucking white ass bitch"", which happened many times in my highschool days, that is, objectively, racism. 
Saying that white people can't dance is objectively racist. Saying that white people are inherently or subconsciously racist is in itself, objectively racist. 
I understand what people are getting at, however I strongly disagree with excluding crucial elements of the truth to support a clearly biased narrative."

RACISM - n. -  **1:** a belief that [race](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/race#h3) is the primary [determinant](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/determinant) of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race 

 **3:** racial [prejudice](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prejudice#h1) or **discrimination** 

You and many other people are choosing the cherrypick ONE of the MULTIPLE definitions of racism to support this broken idea. Please, stop playing the semantics game and call it what it is. bullshit. 

Systemic racism is one facet of racism, it does not encompass it's entire meaning."
dankmemes,fenqnpy,t1_fenoply,1579289396.0,"I don't blame people for wanting to celebrate their heritage and how far they've come, it's doing it in a campus club or event that crosses the line for me. Organize it outside of school facilitation and we can avoid this issue altogether. What a group of students chooses to do on their own time is 100% their business. It's when you implement exclusivity into a system or institution that it becomes hypocritical in my view. I get where you're coming from though."
