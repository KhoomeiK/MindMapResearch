MacArthurís views about the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were starkly different from what the general public supposed Ö. When I asked General MacArthur about the decision to drop the bomb, I was surprised to learn he had not even been consulted. What, I asked, would his advice have been? He replied that he saw no military justification for the dropping of the bomb. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor.





In the years since the two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, a number of historians have suggested that the weapons had a two-pronged objective Ö. It has been suggested that the second objective was to demonstrate the new weapon of mass destruction to the Soviet Union. By August 1945, relations between the Soviet Union and the United States had deteriorated badly. The Potsdam Conference between U.S. President Harry S. Truman, Russian leader Joseph Stalin, and Winston Churchill (before being replaced by Clement Attlee) ended just four days before the bombing of Hiroshima. The meeting was marked by recriminations and suspicion between the Americans and Soviets. Russian armies were occupying most of Eastern Europe. Truman and many of his advisers hoped that the U.S. atomic monopoly might offer diplomatic leverage with the Soviets. In this fashion, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan can be seen as the first shot of the Cold War."

Eisenhower also noted (pg. 380):

In [July] 1945Ö Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. Öthe Secretary, upon giving me the news of the successful bomb test in New Mexico, and of the plan for using it, asked for my reaction, apparently expecting a vigorous assent.

During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives. It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of ëfaceí. The Secretary was deeply perturbed by my attitudeÖ."

MacArthur‚Äôs views about the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were starkly different from what the general public supposed ‚Ä¶. When I asked General MacArthur about the decision to drop the bomb, I was surprised to learn he had not even been consulted. What, I asked, would his advice have been? He replied that he saw no military justification for the dropping of the bomb. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor.





In the years since the two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, a number of historians have suggested that the weapons had a two-pronged objective ‚Ä¶. It has been suggested that the second objective was to demonstrate the new weapon of mass destruction to the Soviet Union. By August 1945, relations between the Soviet Union and the United States had deteriorated badly. The Potsdam Conference between U.S. President Harry S. Truman, Russian leader Joseph Stalin, and Winston Churchill (before being replaced by Clement Attlee) ended just four days before the bombing of Hiroshima. The meeting was marked by recriminations and suspicion between the Americans and Soviets. Russian armies were occupying most of Eastern Europe. Truman and many of his advisers hoped that the U.S. atomic monopoly might offer diplomatic leverage with the Soviets. In this fashion, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan can be seen as the first shot of the Cold War."

Eisenhower also noted (pg. 380):

In [July] 1945‚Ä¶ Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. ‚Ä¶the Secretary, upon giving me the news of the successful bomb test in New Mexico, and of the plan for using it, asked for my reaction, apparently expecting a vigorous assent.

During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives. It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of ‚Äòface‚Äô. The Secretary was deeply perturbed by my attitude‚Ä¶."

Jeff Young is killed during robbery. Spencer is arrested for the crime despite no physical evidence connecting him to the crime ‚Äî no fingerprints, no murder weapon, and no Seiko watch, wedding ring, briefcase or portable TV ‚Äî items that were taken in the robbery. Spencer is offered a plea deal, but refuses it because he knows he's innocent.

Trial happens and the star witness was 42-year-old Gladys Oliver, whose house overlooked the alleyway where the crime happened. She absolutely identifies Spencer as the murderer and he's found guilty. The jury foreman admits that Oliver's testimony was the reason they found Spencer guilty.

Years later, Spencer's lawyer gets an 'evidentiary hearing' to get a new trial declared. New analysis of existing evidence points at another man and they used forensic scientists to prove that Gladys Oliver would not have been able to identify Spencer from her location. She was 93 feet away in conditions that would've required someone 25 feet away or less to discern facial characteristics. They proved at best she could've seen a silhouette.

The result? The appellate court denied a re-trial. They wouldn't give him a new trial because there is a requirement for 'new' evidence in the case. It turns out that none of this counted as 'new' evidence, just taking evidence that was in the original trial and examining it more thoroughly.

So that's the catch. If they could get a retrial, he'd be easily proven innocent with the evidence that was already present at his original trial. But they can't get a new trial without new evidence, and decades after the crime, getting new evidence is essentially impossible."

TooAfraidToAsk,fejs5n6,t3_ep7sou,1579184514.0,Americans love to casually criticize and stereotype other nations but cant take any stereotypes against themselves. As seen by the massively downvoted comments on Americans on this thread
TooAfraidToAsk,fejrv7q,t1_feidhlw,1579184303.0,"Am Asian and I dont agree. Its not cause we're smart, its cause we have a culture that generally pushes for education since most East Asian countries have been in massive poverty within 2 generations and saw academics as a way out. To say that its just cause we're smart undermines an incredible amount of work that a lot of asians go through.

blacks and hispanics AMERICANS have the same issue with poverty but they've been systematically denied climbing that academic ladder throughout American history so they stopped believing in it until recent years. Ironically, its the same thing thats happening now to Asian americans with ivy leagues"
TooAfraidToAsk,fejrpe9,t1_feigeso,1579184181.0,Ill rebuttal this by saying most East Asian work cultures are far worse and their bmi is far less. Its a cultural issue with Americans loading up their offices with sweets and desiring delivery thats terrible for them
TooAfraidToAsk,fejrly1,t1_fehwbtn,1579184111.0,love the only one criticizing Americans get downvoted. Here's one: Americans love to dish it but honestly cant take it
TooAfraidToAsk,fejqrbc,t3_eph3xy,1579183486.0,"Try to rememberers thats the face she puts on in front of the camera. Thats her showing off her best self. When the cameras are off and shes at home, she could very well be a cool person but shes just as much snacking on cookie dough and watching netflix like the rest of us. Only difference is, where we do that for 8 hours, she does it for 1 and fills up the rest with habits that help her.

Ive worked with a lot local celebrities, and believe me, theyre just like everyone else except theyve got good habits hammered into their lives and also theyre far more conscientious of the reputation than most people. Thats not a good or bad thing, but theyre aware a good reputation is helpful"
TooAfraidToAsk,fejqdx6,t3_epi6pm,1579183193.0,"I can answer this. China was a 3rd world country in massive poverty only up until 2 generations ago. Almost everyone whos in their 50‚Äôs ans 60‚Äôs in china now have probably lived most of their lives dirt poor. Although China went through a huge economic boost, a lot of old infrastructures still remain dated, one of which is teaching material. Though again there have been sweeping reform and updates on literature and teaching methods, a vast majority of students grew up with english txt books that were given to them from the era of Marvins, Agnes, and Yvonnes. It‚Äôll probably take some time for educational changes to catch up with modern english names"

instantkarma,feb5ajm,t1_feb43hz,1578955563.0,fair enough
instantkarma,feapll2,t1_feahjy2,1578951104.0,"that aint dismissing, thats bringing up hypocrisy. And a really important one for that matter."
