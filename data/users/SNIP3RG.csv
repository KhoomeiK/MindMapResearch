I’m not gonna quit school or run screaming every time I see someone cough. 

I’m more worried for my immunocompromised fiancée, who also works medical. But I’m not gonna bar her from going to work or get a hotel room if I feel a little off. I’m just gonna be a little more cautious with our cleanliness at home. 

Honestly, I’d say it’s better to be a little worried than completely blasé about the whole thing. That way, you take precautions and stay on top of the news. And, as I’m assuming you don’t work anywhere near the medical field, I’m not sure you have the right or experience to tell people who do that being worried is stupid."

If the left dropped their stance on guns, they would gain thousands of voters at minimum. I know many people, like myself, who only have a hard time voting democrat because they’re concerned about the loss of their personal freedoms.

And that's before mentioning things like population density, unemployment/social programs, cost and effectiveness of education, etc.

facepalm,ffbvga8,t1_ffbu7u2,1579784105.0,">If you were able to truly and fully put yourself in the place one someone who’s about to die, you wouldn’t pull the trigger.

I disagree. I am currently in nursing school, and, as such, have seen many people who want to die. As someone who has suffered from depression, I can relate. At my worst, I would’ve genuinely wanted someone to pull the trigger. I’ve almost done it myself. And a lot of my patients would agree. So yes, I can empathize. 

However, this is not a logical argument by you. You’ve already admitted you eat meat. If I were a prey animal, I’d rather live my life free until I was taken down by a bullet, rather than live my entire life in a cage before being terminated by a bolt gun. So, in my mindset, the meat I eat from hunting is more ‘morally correct’ than that I buy at the store."

If the left dropped their stance on guns, they would gain thousands of voters at minimum.

However, this is not a logical argument by you. Youâ€™ve already admitted you eat meat. If I were a prey animal, Iâ€™d rather live my life free until I was taken down by a bullet, rather than live my entire life in a cage before being terminated by a bolt gun.

But just because youâ€™re a furry or like feet doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re gonna go rape kids. Those are entirely different things.


Also, there are literally millions of furries and foot fetishists who are not raping kids. What makes you think they are any more likely to do that than, say, people who watch â€œteenâ€ porn? Should we condemn that too, just in case?"

And thank you as well, donâ€™t see much of that on the internet. I enjoy discussions that donâ€™t immediately result in downvoting and name-calling."
