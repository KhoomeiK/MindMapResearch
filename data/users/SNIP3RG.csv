And it isn’t just a narrative, because every time someone says “no one is trying to take your guns!” someone like Beto shows up and says “Yes, we are going to take your AR-15s!” 

If the left dropped their stance on guns, they would gain thousands of voters at minimum. I know many people, like myself, who only have a hard time voting democrat because they’re concerned about the loss of their personal freedoms.

And that's before mentioning things like population density, unemployment/social programs, cost and effectiveness of education, etc.

I'm not gonna pretend to know all the stats and try to say which of these differences contributes most, but I would guess that happy, financially-stable, successful people with readily available mental healthcare are much less likely to shoot up a school, regardless of weapon availability."

However, this is not a logical argument by you. You’ve already admitted you eat meat. If I were a prey animal, I’d rather live my life free until I was taken down by a bullet, rather than live my entire life in a cage before being terminated by a bolt gun.
