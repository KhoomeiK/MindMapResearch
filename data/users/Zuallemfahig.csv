Went snorkeling with my family and I staryed a bit following some fish and suddenly a big black hole was all I could see where the floor was supposed to be. I was so nervous and uncoordinated and at the same time realized that if anything wanted to make a snack out of me I was right there. 

I still love snorkeling and diving but now I try to be more aware of my Space and surroundings. Being underwater is such a calm feeling and it All feels like an alien world."
