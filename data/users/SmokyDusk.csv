It should have been close to the middle or top, in case people got too full to eat the ones at the bottom.

If it had been higher up, then it would have been found sooner, and the kid may not have mauled the tower. This might sound like victim-blaming here, but it's not. It's just that she clearly doesn't plan things well, based on the bad results of not one, but two!, parties. And her reaction to the situation proves she's no victim at all."

I'm not sure what grounding entails for this situation, and taking away his electronics for 3 months should help keep him off social media, which was part of the original issue.

If he goes to the shelter, it may teach him empathy. He might not understand why what he did was wrong, but he will learn over time that people in the LGBTQA+ community are human beings, that being different from him doesn't make them any less than he is.

I want to believe he'll be volunteering at least until the end of the school year."

All he would have had to do is say, ""Wow, this is such a great movie, because you two remind me so much of the main characters. You're like my own little Elsa and Anna!"" It's a very easy suggestion to make the kids think it was their own idea.

And it is only natural for the older sister to decide she's Elsa. Besides, it's practically a coin flip. Two sisters, two characters. There are only so many possibilities for who would be who.

Then the older one would have been like, ""Oh, yay! I love Elsa, because I'm the older sister just like her! Is she the one I remind you of? Am I Elsa???""

""Yep! You're just like a little Elsa. :)""

We have no idea if he made the suggestion or if the kids came up with it themselves and he was just really happy about it.

>The guy cut him off and said “He is choosing not to listen to me! I told him the rules when we got home and he has ignored every single one.” The guy went on a rant saying how the cat was told to use a little box but he pissed on the floor multiple times, how he told the cat to not go into the spare room but he still does.... and so on.

AmItheAsshole,fcj7hni,t3_ehagzl,1577679188.0,"ESH. Your parents suck for putting this pressure on you. Your sister sucks for lying. You suck for invading her privacy. And you will be TA if you out her.

I've been in a similar position. I saw personal student data of someone I strongly disliked and knew was lying about their grades. Even though it was really hard not to say something, I didn't. I wanted to confront them. I wanted them to confess. I wanted their family and SO to know. I knew their family was paying for their schooling and that they and many others were being lied to. I told one or two trustworthy people about what I saw, because I knew I was going to mess up if I had to hold it in.

It was another year after I saw this info that their parents finally found out. I'm not sure exactly which things they learned, but it was enough to change things. It was a tough time for that person, and no matter how much I disliked them, I wouldn't have wanted to be responsible for the fallout, because it was pretty significant.

The results were far more dramatic than I ever thought they would be.

Your parents are volatile. You don't know what they will say or do. Don't make your sibling's life worse to make yours better. That's the difference between someone who is TA and someone who isn't.

Knowing the truth is powerful and intimidating. But this is not a box you want to open.

You can talk to your sister about it, but don't give her an ultimatum. Let things work out how they will, no matter how much you wish to intervene. As someone who has been in your position, please don't do it."

Basically, your brain learns patterns. If your brain developed a pattern when you were younger of wanting to die any time something bad happened, your brain would keep that pattern and turn it into a reflex. Your development affects a lot of how your brain works. Try to make a list of things to do instead when you feel suicidal. As soon as you have the knee-jerk reaction, do one of the things on your list. It'll help you associate negative events with something pleasant or neutral."
asktransgender,fc4l5zb,t1_fc37aci,1577419905.0,">although experiencing everything ""feminine"" feels soo soo GOOD, its just the idea as presenting as such causes me a lot of anxiety

There it is! Fear and anxiety are normal in your situation. You need time to mentally transition as you go through this process--transitioning isn't only physical and social.

If it feels good and right, and you feel like your true self, when you do feminine things, then that means you are 100% on the right track, even if you doubt yourself at different points in the process.

I'm still learning how to soothe my dysphoria, because I didn't even realize that's what it was!

It's important to take stock of how it affects you and how you can combat it. I've been using the one-person bathrooms at work lately, and that privacy has helped a lot. It's not that I feel completely out of place in the women's room; I just find it a bit stressful. I feel a lot more comfortable with how I perceive my own gender, just by doing this one little thing during the day.

Find these little comforts and make use of them. It takes time, so don't feel like you have to rush. Just figure out what makes you feel like your true feminine self. <3"
