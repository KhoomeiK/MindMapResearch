[UNHELPFUL “HELPERS”: WHY UNSOLICITED ADVICE AND CHRONIC ILLNESS DON’T MIX](http://shamelessmag.com/blog/entry/unhelpful-helpers-why-unsolicited-advice-and-chronic-illness-dont-mix)

If I had asked for help, I would absolutely be accepting of your advice. But the thing is, I offered an opinion on a debate citing my own experiences and you took that as an opportunity to give me unwanted advice and ***repeatedly*** question if I am absolutely sure I've tried everything. I never asked for help but you feel the need to insert yourself into my medical care. As much as you blame the other user, your own comments offered nothing to the discussion and were unrelated to the entire point I, or anyone else, was making. I had planned to just ignore your irritating comments until you decided to throw personal attacks at another user who said your behavior wasn't acceptable. Just because you have good intentions doesn't absolve you of any critiques on your behavior. Whether your intent was malicious or not, your behavior sure makes it seem like a thinly veiled attempt to undermine my experiences and say I just hadn't tried hard enough to help my condition. To make things worse, you doubled down when you were called out on it. 

I'm not saying this was your intent for sure, but it can easily seem that way. As irritating as it was, I wouldn't hold it against you.... Just please, for the love of God (or whatever you believe in), please stop giving unsolicited advice. Wait for someone to ask for help before offering your services. I'm sure there's many in this sub that would love to have your help. I'm also sure you might have some great ideas. Maybe I'll look into asking the next time I need the help. For now, I hope you have a peaceful night."

I'd request service animal training for employees to make sure this doesn't happen to you or anyone else again.

Edit: might also be good to pass this info up the chain on command in the police department, considering these are state laws."
service_dogs,fgkoncu,t3_ez1c0u,1580870253.0,"Was it due to your dog alerting to your fiance? It doesn't make it any better, but maybe it could explain what jump started them asking when you'd already been there. I would call the hospital ombudsman in the morning to discuss the event. Have a copy of Texas State SDiT law handy. Since your dog is not fully trained, it is not covered by the ADA and a complaint to them or the DOJ will not help.

I've copied the law directly below from Vernon's Texas Statutes and Codes Annotated. Human Resources Code, Title 8, Rights and Responsibilities of Persons with Disabilities, Chapter 121, § 121.003. Discrimination Prohibited.

> **(i) A service animal in training shall not be denied admittance to any public facility when accompanied by an approved trainer.**

> (j) A person may not assault, harass, interfere with, kill, or injure in any way, or attempt to assault, harass, interfere with, kill, or injure in any way, an assistance animal.

> **(k) Except as provided by Subsection (l), a person is not entitled to make demands or inquiries relating to the qualifications or certifications of a service animal for purposes of admittance to a public facility except to determine the basic type of assistance provided by the service animal to a person with a disability.**

> (l) If a person's disability is not readily apparent, for purposes of admittance to a public facility with a service animal, a staff member or manager of the facility may inquire about:

> > (1) whether the service animal is required because the person has a disability; and

> > (2) what type of work or task the service animal is trained to perform.

***Please keep in mind that while subsection (i) only gives these benefits to an approved trainer, there is no such process or definition regarding how to obtain this approval.***"
insaneparents,fgkhw0w,t1_fgjvimd,1580865941.0,"I would actually assume it's someone that he still actively talks to from his past life, like a  ""friend"", acquaintance, coworker, maybe someone in his family that he still talks to, or something like that. It would explain their disdain for his behavior, their knowledge of the situation, and the ability to contact the new wife. It's possible it's an ex of some sort, but just from experience, it's usually one of the latter."

service_dogs,fgk9lt7,t3_eyyfm6,1580860481.0,"Whenever my doctors play games like this (most of the time it's unintentional) I find it's best to just schedule an appointment. It does suck because you may have to pay to see them (you might be able to fight that with their billing department), but it makes them actually have to sit down , fill it out, and tell you what was taking so long/why they're being unresponsive. I'm so sorry you're going through this."
service_dogs,fgk8i0z,t1_fgjihj2,1580859772.0,I would also love more info. This sounds awesome.

service_dogs,fgk7r09,t3_eyur99,1580859303.0,"It takes a ***lot*** of money and time. On average, it takes about $25,000 over a two year period to train a service dog. It is possible to owner train with the help of a private service dog trainer (instead of going through an organization), but I still wouldn't expect to spend less than $10,000. Do you know have any ideas in mind on how a dog could help assist your disabilities?"
