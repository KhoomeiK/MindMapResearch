Philippines,fewj7cl,t3_eqrkem,1579411668.0,"Backrider here, we rode in the middle of PH summer at noon and jeans will overheat you. Get textile padded pants with breathable mesh, same with the jacket. Quality ones will keep you cool, with ample protection in case of a crash. Riding down highways bring in airflow into your body and it's awesome.

Bring a vacuum-insulated flask, and refill when you do stops. I can't tell you how glad I was that I brought my 2L flask with ice-cold water when our companion broke down in the middle of TPLEX."

My parents are pack rats/hoarders too. Well, most my relatives are. Whatever they give me that I don't need, I give to my cousins, nieces, and nephews back home. They really love it. It's not easy being a minimalist. For me, a house fire and a couple of years put me on this path lol something about losing half your stuff puts you in a different perspective üòÖ"

Thing is, the initial agreement was bring some stuff to his long-time friend. No problem with it, I like the guy, he's great. Then it came to sending stuff to other people that... to be frank, doesn't really deserve anything from us because complicated family stuff ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the rest of the family here doesn't want to send stuff to them either.

I don't know. But, my aunt handled it and she'll have it shipped whether dad likes it or not lol"

Pets,fci7oi8,t3_ehaugg,1577658724.0,"We have the same problem in our country. To think, anti-rabies vaccinations are FREE and provided for by our government, lots of posters and flyers on every street and public areas for information, mobile clinics monthly, a public vet available everyday beside the city hall... And STILL a lot of pets die of rabies, or humans being put at risk of rabies when they get bit by an unvaxxed pet. I saw an owner bring their dog to my vet once, and by then it was already too late for the poor pup. It was having seizures, hypersalivating, confused, and aggressive. So hard to watch. It could have been prevented :("
