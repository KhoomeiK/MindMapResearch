What I see in friends that are more approachable is this: they generally make eye contact with everyone - even passersbys. Then, they smile. It does create a good vibe. The fake persona takes too much energy, OP, and you are worthy as you are."

After all, the guy was inappropriately in your face and denying any wrong-doing - instantly. Anything you could have said would have made it escalate. There is assertive and aggressive after all. You're not a little bitch."
