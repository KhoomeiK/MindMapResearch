AskReddit,ffcr8oj,t1_ffc8brz,1579805599.0,"I learned how to hang doors from a 30 year carpenter working habitat one day. Not at all difficult with the right knowledge of the process. Start by making you hinge side level before you even put the door frame in there. If on carpet, set a door shim under the frame on each side. Shoot the hinge side into the wall. (If working alone, remove the door first by pulling the pins. After this stage rehang the door) then just adjust your frame based on equal spacing around the closed door started at the top on the hinge side and working your way around.


Whole thing takes maybe 20 minutes on a troublesome door frame. 


Exterior doors, completely different scenario and usually take me 3-4 hours. But interior is all about the process"

todayilearned,ff251ww,t1_feysbmj,1579494013.0,"We bought a house 5 years ago and subsequently found ourselves at war with the local chipmunk battalion. Turns out the house had been abandoned long enough for them to claim squatter's rights. Between the holes into the side of the house (so, so many fucking holes we later found) and the new holes they kept making by burrowing in to the crawlspace and then into the main portion of the house, they had ready access and did not take kindly to outsiders in their territory. This is a story for another time as the battles have waged so long I've finally grown weary of removing their damn carcasses. The point is, in the early days of the war when we were still able to laugh we would joke about getting a cake to celebrate our 50th kill. Little did we know that day would soon come in only a few short months. So when we hit 50 my wife went to the local grocery store. They clearly googled ""dead chipmunk"" and printed the picture they found onto the cake. Even drizzled some red glazed frosting from its mouth and placed a few more gunshot wounds in the abdomen. It was glorious. 


I was genuinely impressed they not only did it, but committed to it so fully. And I do have to admit it was a tad unsettling eating that cake while staring at the body of my enemy, wondering what I'd become.


And quick update on the war, which I used to narrate on facebook in the style of old WWII newsreels solely to amuse myself: I'm no longer amused by any of it. It lasted a solid 3 years before we finally got the population under control. In that time we kept track of the numbers and although I'd have to go look to be sure, I'm quite certain we hit 150 in the first 3 years. These days we're somewhere around 170 but have an established perimeter that violaters are summarily executed upon crossing. There's also chickenwire buried around the house to fortify our borders. I've refrained from chemical warfare solely for the collateral damage it would cause to the neighborhood feline population, but a man can only take so much."

But depending on the line of work, it also comes down to getting different experience. I'm an engineer and I've worked for companies that LOVE to just move people up into engineering positions. The problem of course, is that they only have experience designing the things you already make. So innovation stagnates. I've worked for companies that realize this and start hiring externally- innovation and new designs churn out. And companies that never did and went from being the leader to being several years behind the competition. There are advantages to both strategies, but sticking purely to one can hurt you longterm"

Full stop.

Never have understood why you'd put your beliefs all over your car anyway. Not like you're going to suddenly convert someone you just cut off and nearly clipped to your line of thinking.

AdviceAnimals,fdr76hp,t1_fdqz95m,1578680436.0,"To add to this- it's also been kept as Tuesday and without the day off because the Poor tend to vote more D than R, and they are more impacted by not having the day off. In recrnt years some states have started requiring employees be given 'x' hours to vote, but if you're hourly it still doesn't really help the problem, though at least a step in the right direction. It is important to remember that in American politics the goal is to pick your voters rather than the other way around. (Disenfranchisememt, gerrymandering, etc)


EDIT: wow, triggered a few here. Every time the idea of changing election day or adding voting days or mail in ballots comes up,  guess who votes it down? Guess which states actually work to do things such as: close polling stations (Georgia in the last election) almost exclusively in poor areas, REDUCE voting hours, etc. Ya'll seem to (conveniently) forget that the poor tend to work more than a simple 9-5 job and have no access to simply drive themselves wherever/whenever they want. One and only one current party keeps trying to suppress votes in the name of ""eliminating voter fraud"". Kentucky is currently trying to pass legislation to require certain types of ID at the polls, Specifically, they are trying to reduce voter turnout in students and the poor. (The law would require an expiration date on the ID, which neither major college in KY has) The official currently pushing for this even openly admits they haven't had a single case of voter fraud in a decade in the state. 


You want more evidence? Look up Jim Crow era voting laws. ""Tests"" that I couldn't pass if my life depended on it even now. Historically, one and only one party has tried to keep people from voting because it threatens their chances of winning legitimately in the name of ""stopping voter fraud"". (Though Jim Crowe was just openly about preventing an entire race from voting) 


Gerrymandering has been committed by both parties egregiously, but suprpressing the vote is wholely owned by one side."

AdviceAnimals,fd3avy6,t1_fd30is0,1578156461.0,"In most restaurants anymore they include three options at the bottom of the receipt for you to ""make the math easier"". Most start at 18% anymore, but that seems to be trending towards 20 very quickly. 


And a lot of places you enter it with someone literally standing over you if you sign the receipt at the counter on your way out. (I eat out a lot while traveling for work) 


I worked as a waiter in college 15-20 years ago when 15% was ""good"". I was lucky enough to work at a place that paid min wage on top of tips. If you work at a place that pays the $2-3/hour and it's a slow night, you didn't even make gas money. Yeah, the restaurant is supposed to make up the difference to at least get you to min wage in that situation, but the way you report your tips that doesn't really happen. When I worked there you claimed a certain percentage of your sales as tips earned for tax purposes. So you may claim $100 in tips one night, but if a big group stiffed you, you only made $30. But the manager isn't going by you adding up the cash in your pocket (for ovvious reasons- you could just lie) so you may end up screwed."
