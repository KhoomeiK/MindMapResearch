movies,ffmvm6d,t1_ffjw7uu,1580059373.0,"I really think the extended should be the main version. When you watch the extended all the way through it is one of the greatest cinematic epics of all time. I always maintain LOTR is our generations Gone with The Wind(without being problematic) Its this sweeping romance of friendship, faith, perseverance, and hope."
criterion,ffmtw2f,t1_ffm06rq,1580058837.0,Honestly what ever typeface they used for the title card for the movie. Like either the one for The Irishman or I Heard You Paint Houses.
criterion,fflyj40,t3_eu46kp,1580045777.0,I love the shot. Would play with typeface more.
science,fflycoo,t1_fflvfus,1580045692.0,Thank you for the addendum at the end. I struggle with OCD/ and anxiety I took acid and it led to about 3-4 months of hell. So thank you for acknowledging this isn’t the best option for everyone.
horrorlit,ffj911s,t3_etxocj,1579993302.0,I want to read more horror. I am an avid horror fan but been recovering with a major bout of anxiety so I’m gradually getting back into horror. It felt good when I not only could watch Midsommar but actually love and appreciate it.
horrorlit,ffj7fq4,t3_etxocj,1579992278.0,That is a wonderful book. My buddy who does horror vfx has it and its amazing.
movies,ffhe1gn,t1_ffh55q2,1579931449.0,Brendan was perfect for that role. It might be one of his best roles to date. I love Leo but he would have looked like a teenager trying to fight mummies.

worldnews,fenp9lm,t3_epn9qz,1579288822.0,I think critical thinking is key. Always take in information critically and consider the source. Consider the context. And so many people lack that literacy of criticism and were handed the most powerful tool for media and information. And they have no idea how to navigate it.

criterion,feh8wpo,t1_feh8789,1579111581.0,"I don’t think he is pretentious just challenging. He loves to make challenging character films.

Edit: I also want to add that every film he makes is structured around the psychology of the characters in his movies. Even Magnolia which takes an eye of God by way of Robert Altman approach. And every movie is about a dysfunctional family that is formed. Yes Boogie Nights isn’t about porn its about A family of porn makers."
horror,feh7rgb,t1_fegyj6z,1579110904.0,"I think its all a matter of taste and preference. I first saw An American Werewolf as a child and I adore the weird mix of sensibilities. The Howling is a subversive dark satire but its just different. Also the wolf is bipedal as opposed to the grizzly wolf in An American Werewolf in London. I prefer AAWIL but totally get why people love The Howling and its a lot of fun and shows a lot of wolf and the effects are impressive but a different style to what AAWIL was going for. 

I kind hope they’d make a show out of Howling. You could build an interesting narrative around the community for a tv series."
criterion,feer05x,t3_eoqpf3,1579039359.0,The thing about PTA is I guarantee that list has changed and he probably has some very popular and well loved movies on his list. For a director who gets accused of being pretentious he is one of the most down to earth people.

Anglicanism,feddhug,t3_eodlps,1579008451.0,"I honestly want Jesus to come back and open up a can of whoop ass. I want our Divine High Priest to lay judgement upon the empires and pharisees of the world and uplift the oppressed and marginalized. I want Christ’s Kingdom on Earth frankly. I want all things to be brought into subjection through Christ. So yes I believe and hope Christ will come again and we should expect it like a thief in the night. 

I might have been a Southern Baptist turned leftist Anglo Catholic if you can’t tell."
movies,fedcgkw,t3_eobc5s,1579007533.0,So actually funding artists and letting them make movies how ever long the story needs makes better movies? Wow you don’t say!! Also more people have probably seen Marriage Story and The Irishman on Netflix than if they just released it in limited theaters. Embrace and adapt to the future. And its coming. Every studio will start to build a streaming platform eventually and start doing this as well. They will keep following the Netflix route until it isn’t attractive to the consumer. Don’t be surprised if WB starts trying to release prestige content on HBO Max how Netflix is. Even Disney might.
movies,fe6cwg8,t1_fe5lrus,1578887255.0,I love The Jacket. That movie is so underrated. Its such a weird and haunted movie. Brian Eno also made a killer soundtrack

As someone who has been dealing with depression and anxiety and seeing this character grapple with grief, loss, guilt and sanity and coming out on the other side stronger was so moving and empowering."
movies,fdrb2hv,t1_fdqy6ac,1578681987.0,He has a problematic obsession with rape. He talked about writing Dune as a rape of Frank Herbert in the Dune Doc. I wish they could find Mara Lorenzo and corroborate what happened during production. I would at least be able to watch his movies again if she stated she wasn’t raped.

ObscureMedia,fdn6q17,t1_fdmdry1,1578578799.0,"Blair Witch was notable but I think it mainly enhanced the central conceit that it was real footage.

ObscureMedia,fdlei2u,t1_fdlbr7v,1578522302.0,"That’s not true. AI was notable for its ARG, but other movies had websites and advertised on the internet before AI. Matrix, Wild Wild West, House on haunted hill all had fully formed sites. I remember lots of cheesy flash games. House on Haunted hill had one and then I remember Hollow Man had one too. A really developed one was Fight Club."

I loved both movies but I think the direction he goes in Midsommar was very interesting even when compared to other folk horror films like The Wicker Man (1973) . Like i love how well he captures primal traumatic emotions. I felt that Toni Collette just talking frankly about her family history in Hereditary was more terrifying than the supernatural bits. The same for Florence Pugh anxiety, grief, emotional alienation in Midsommar. As someone who has struggled with intense anxiety watching her cope with grief and terror was almost unbearable."
