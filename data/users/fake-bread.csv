SuicideWatch,fd6loay,t3_ek6g0j,1578192822.0,I’ve made too many mistakes that I can’t fix and I live with only feeling regret
SuicideWatch,fct2e91,t3_eiqazb,1577931096.0,Keep going my friend. You’re doing great and I hope you leave 2019 behind and forget about it.
SuicideWatch,fcsf1iz,t1_fcsetho,1577915614.0,Yeah that’s pretty much it. She’s friends with all of my friends and I’m really hoping it goes well and maybe I can turn this all around.
SuicideWatch,fcscqa6,t1_fcsbmbk,1577914707.0,I’m not sure to be honest. It’s been a thing since forever but it’s been getting worse and since Im not close with anyone it gets really hard to talk to people. The reason I don’t talk to my friends is just because when I see them I get really anxious and I freeze up because I just feel bad for being such an awful person for not talking to them.
SuicideWatch,fcs9gyv,t1_fcs8soq,1577913354.0,Thank you and it’s because I’ve been struggling with social anxiety and depression for awhile now. It’s caused me to lash out and push everyone away and now I have no one left. I really just want them back because they’re amazing people and they’re family to me. I stopped talking to them about 4 months ago and it’s really hard for me to start talking to them again. I try a lot but it usually doesn’t go anywhere and we just say we miss each other.
SuicideWatch,f8g3rbr,t3_e0q7qq,1574553623.0,I’m sorry you feel the way that you do but you shouldn’t follow through with this. it isn’t worth it. If you have a second I would definitely like to hear your story and talk this through with you.
