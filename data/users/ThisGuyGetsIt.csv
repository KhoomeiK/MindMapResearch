Animal welfare does need improving. I tried to do some research into direanimal but there's very little in English. Moi franois est terrible, so I didn't get very far with my research.

 If you think black markets won't rise you're being na√Øve.
You can still get illegal firearms in the UK despite the strict regulation over here, my coke dealer has one. You can get cocaine in whatever party destination you go to just out on the street. You can buy ground up elephant tusks if that sort of thing tickles you. If you have money and want something you will find it. 

Just because you've not personally bought these things doesn't mean that they aren't there. They are just invisible to law abiding citizens. In the same way that mistreated livestock would be invisible if meat becomes profitable for criminals to produce."
facepalm,fdhrb5m,t1_fdhoxte,1578428642.0,"ugggghhhh, just did some research thanks to your comment. Demulesing is not what I thought demulesing was. That's awful they should give those sheep some morphine or something. Still better than being devoured arse backwards by maggots though."
facepalm,fdhobs5,t1_fdhl1la,1578426880.0,"Of course it hurts. I'm sure there is a more humane way to demule. Farming as it is at the moment could be far more humane. I said that vegans are 100% right in theory, that means, ethically and in theoretical practice (closed systems). The world would be a better place without animal farming (assuming no black market). I'm agreeing with you there. 

&#x200B;

The only assumption there is that the government uses a prohibition approach in banning the use of animal products. Which is far fetched at best.

What do your guys want to do? Is it an animal welfare type deal? or a decrease demand type deal? have you got any links? I've never heard of an actual vegan policy polititian it might be an interesting read."
facepalm,fdhjy5q,t3_el9n2r,1578424240.0,"Imagine a world of animal product prohibition. A lot of people would follow suit as its the path of least resistance. The majority would conform to the new norm (at least overtly) BUT you get the minority who can't let go of the old ways. They getting locked up and marginalised as poachers, farmers, etc. At the moment there is no way to know who would be one of them. I can't even say no to a spliff never mind a pair of nice warm wooly socks and a stake.  I'd probs get locked up, eventualy.

Al Capone, Pablo Escobar, ""El Chapo"" all have something in common. They supplied a market where people with ethics didn't. If all sheep, cows, those big liver ducks, various cattle that are clearly man playing god where to get mass slaughtered as to reduce future suffering. In that market there would a rise an unregulated ""black market"" in forbidden lifestock and derivitive goods. As this market is unregulated the animals that suvived the original sanctioned massacres would likely live in awful conditions. Firstly to avoid detection by the authorities, secondly because now there is no oversight as to what farmers can do to their livestock.

Genociding animals is pointless because some will always survive somewhere. I propose that we build a eugenics program to breed out the suffering over generations. Fix them the same way we fucked them."
facepalm,fdhjt82,t1_fdh927n,1578424157.0,"Chopping off a toe is a bit much. Demulesing compares more to a toe nail being clipped until the very end. Then touching it with a glowing hot iron so that it doesn't grow back. Vegans are theoretically right about almost everything. But read my digression.

I don't think the NHS will get worse if we stay in the EU, but if we leave under the torries things can only get worse.

It is a shame about the forests. I wonder if you can still access them?"
