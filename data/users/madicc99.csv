offmychest,fgndqyl,t1_fgmpwf3,1580942708.0,All you have to do is do it it’s that simple. It doesn’t feel that simple but it really is that simple.
gainit,fgkvb4k,t1_fgkqhkd,1580874427.0,"I eat 3 eggs and oatmeal with peanut butter and honey for breakfast. Then a snack (like yogurt and granola or something) a few hours later. Then chicken and rice and broccoli for lunch. Another snack a few hours later like a high calorie snack (I make a tuna wrap out of a mission wrap, a can of tuna, raw spinach, ranch dressing and cheese or something on it). Then I have Salmon and Potatoes and spinach or spaghetti or some kind of pasta for supper. Then sometimes even eat a bowl of oatmeal or something at night! Of course, it took me a little while to work up to this. When I first started eating better I would gag eating breakfast and couldn’t ever seem to finish my food but after a while you just get the willpower and appetite to eat it. Now I’m hungry for all my snacks and meals! I have gained 30 pounds in less than a year. I used to be 110 at 5’7 so I feel you."
gainit,fgkok0g,t3_eyypva,1580870198.0,"What kind of food are you eating? Try smaller meals every 3-4 hours. I’m hypoglycemic and had trouble keeping weight on also because my metabolism is so fast. You have to make sure you’re not eating junk that your body goes through very quickly. I make sure I have a high protein diet with plenty of good carbs and fats instead of sugary things. If you don’t eat breakfast, start doing that too!"
offmychest,fgetv23,t1_fgetocg,1580709803.0,"I’m seeing a therapist that I like for the first time in my life. I think maybe that’s why some of the anger is just coming up. I’ve never worked through it. 

And you can associate almost anything to a mental health condition if you think about it. I have spoken to this man after and I genuinely believe he is just a monster. I don’t blame myself much. I blame him and I don’t believe there is help for people like him."
offmychest,fgetgxz,t1_fge8qy6,1580709400.0,I think if someone has to cut off their penis in order to stop themselves from raping a child they should die. They should kill themselves.
memes,fg7xwiw,t3_exbtxx,1580604297.0,One time this happened while I was at the store with my grandma and she waited about .5 seconds and then proceeded to ram her cart through the women and say “excuse me rude bitches”
offmychest,fg5ji8u,t3_ewyodc,1580529172.0,I love this. I love talking about my boyfriend to my friends. I am that annoying person that constantly brings him up and I don’t care. We’ve been together 3 years and I don’t think his name will ever stop constantly coming out of my mouth lol
curlyhair,fg3uidx,t3_ewozq5,1580489948.0,Can you post a before pic??
Anger,fg1ot8f,t1_fg1o60r,1580430992.0,This actually did make me feel a lot better and I should try the writing thing. It has to be better than telling him I hate him and I’ll never marry him and screaming like a lunatic. I don’t meant those things and it makes me feel like a horrible person for saying them... i love him more than anything and he is an amazing man who deserves better than me. I hate it. I know if I can’t figure out how to be better about this I won’t get to ever marry him
aww,ffvovdd,t3_evbisi,1580269255.0,I can smell this picture
CatAdvice,ffdwrqk,t3_et2dvi,1579830852.0,Good luck I just spray mine with the little hose sprayer on the sink and they jump down... they will probably come back for more in a few minutes though.
offmychest,fcru3cs,t1_fcpay1s,1577906629.0,He is actually a great boyfriend and that was not the point of my comment! We have been together for years and I think it’s perfectly okay for him to go do things with his friends... just because I’m not 21 and I don’t have any friends doesn’t mean he should sit at home all the time and do nothing too. (Which he does plenty of anyways). We spend loads of time together. I don’t know why that is what you got out of this comment...
