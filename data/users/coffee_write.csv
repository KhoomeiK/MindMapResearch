I had a cat who didn't like my little sisters because they were loud and obnoxious, but one time one of them got really sick and he laid with them the entire time until they were better. Your cat knows, and he's only cuddling with you to comfort you. Enjoy it, he's trying to cheer you up! I hope you can dig yourself from the funk, that's never a fun place to be."
depression,ffgsb1s,t3_etd5c4,1579913784.0,"Those are my exact thoughts too! I always felt like everyone would be happier if I was gone, and that I was actually doing them a favor. When I have been in that mindset I don't think anything could be said to make me feel better or see that it was a disease talking. Just time to get better or hospitalization. I don't think people know how to approach the subject or what they should say. They mean well, but sometimes it's counter productive."
doggrooming,ffa81mh,t3_esektm,1579729690.0,That looks fantastic! The face is too cute!

depression,fekv3pb,t3_epm2ch,1579208217.0,"Thank goodness you saw his true colors before you married him! No one who thinks nor treats you like that deserves any of your time and attention. I am so sorry he did that to you and you're having to deal with so much. Things can get better, and there is someone out there for you who will love you just the way you are and think you're perfect. Don't give up, you have a great community here alone to cheer you on!"
bipolar,fdzv8er,t1_fdztnhi,1578796596.0,"I have one and it's a sign that life doesn't end; the sentence continues. Suicide awareness, there's more behind it I think. I assume this is what it's for on hers as well, but of course can't say for sure."
bipolar,fdy662u,t1_fdtwc6g,1578776515.0,"Was going to say the same thing! (type 1) Lol, we drew the super short straws on life."
depression,fdfh3ml,t3_ekwbox,1578361546.0,"I totally get this! Plus it's a ton of work to dig yourself up. I'll feel like what's the point in trying to be happy when it takes this much work and energy?? But it is worth it, if you can get yourself back up. Don't give up, you can do it! I hope the week treats you well."
bipolar,fdfd5xk,t1_fd98cep,1578358908.0,"I'm so glad you're in a better place now and have received the help and support that's needed! You have an amazing wife to understand and stay with you through the toughest times. I did something similar when my now husband and I got together, and he too didn't want to give up on what he thought we could have and stayed. It's only been the past few years that I've really tried to get help and work through things, but had always thought I was just depressed until I got on meds that were for bipolar and it clicked that that made WAY more sense. I'm sorry we have to go through the shit to see what's important, but it's nice knowing I'm not alone. I appreciate you sharing that!"
childfree,fd77pm4,t1_fd689k0,1578200518.0,"OH MY GOD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE!!! It drives me crazy when people say could care less. Everyone always hates me, lol. Thank you."
bipolar,fd76d8q,t1_fd6rpg7,1578200014.0,"I completely get that! I used to have terrible social anxiety (on meds which helps a ton now), but my sex drive always won out. Haha. It's great you need to be romantically invested though! And there's someone out there who you won't be able to resist and, will have the bravery to go ask!"
bipolar,fd6m8eh,t1_fd6jgjf,1578193028.0,"Glad to hear I'm not just crazy! I wouldn't say I'm bisexual, but I've mentioned threesomes in the past and it's a hard no from him. But yes, I've been on both ends of cheating and it's the worst! Definitely won't ever do that to him. Thanks for the response!"
bipolar,fd6lukb,t1_fd6jxti,1578192891.0,"Whew, glad it's not just me! I have an appointment with my psych soon so maybe I'll bring it up and see if there's something that would help me with it. It's really rather annoying at times, lol."
tarot,fcsq399,t1_fcqy3g1,1577922250.0,"That makes a lot of sense! Thank you for the response, I appreciate it!"
tarot,fcsq1q2,t1_fcp8swi,1577922220.0,"Thank you for the response! That helps a lot, I really appreciate your feedback!"
BipolarReddit,fcbb3h2,t3_egxtxd,1577584694.0,I totally get this!! Sometimes I wish for a manic day just so I can have that crazy energy and go-getter mindset. But I also don't want to spiral down after. It sucks.
BipolarReddit,fc0wv7f,t3_efh2rj,1577301826.0,Merry Christmas to you as well!!
