You don't sit down with someone with the intent to fire them without any prep work done prior to the meeting. But yeah - I'm obviously wrong here, I just think it's weird and whether or not someone is ""fired"" should not be decided after the fact.

I actually do want to die but I know I'll be less successful if I tell you that, plus I gotta go to work tomorrow so I can't be admitted"". It's a weird mental gymnastics I go through.

When asked how I'm doing. Then I kinda laugh it off and say ""well... No, not great."" But I can't open up emotionally to a stranger, and something about taking that first step towards treatment gives me hope, purpose, makes me feel productive and social - things I lack otherwise. So it's really hard to express how horribly depressed I am when I present myself so well, and actually feel better than usual in that specific moment. 

Also - I've read that women are more used to ""wearing a mask"" and faking smiles. I've gotten extremely good at it I think. Again, my anxiety tells me it's worse to make a scene or be noticed, so I either lie and say I have a migraine, or pretend my depression isn't there. But then it explodes once I get home"

I thought I was overpaid at my current (job I'm leaving in a week) place. But I was surprised to find out that I was actually paid pretty much within the normal range. In the new job I'll be doing the same job but in a different industrial setting, but with better benefits, better hours, and a little over 13% increase in pay.

Edit - I should add that some RNs in my area make SIGNIFICANTLY less than I do (like $15k-20k less). So my income was a huge factor into why I was hesitant to leave. I went into the job hunt assuming I'd take a pay cut but felt it was worth it to get out of the bad situation. I seriously would've left years ago but wasn't ready to give up my salary.

personalfinance,ff5syhm,t1_ff55ght,1579609063.0,"This was me (I literally just put in my two weeks notice a week ago). I found myself having to give pep talks in the mirror, ""you're good at your job!!"" Because I KNOW I'm good at my job - my boss is just nitpicking bullshit and literally gets on to me for doing things I didn't even do. I had a one on one with her back in October where she got on to me for turning in reports and assessments late, not attending conference calls etc. I was dumbfounded - so I went back through my sent folder and proved that she was wrong and possibly got me mixed up with someone else. But she never replied to that email and had several more instances where she told me to fix something that I was literally already doing the correct way. I didn't want to sound defensive every time I talked to her so it just put me in a really weird positron. I started getting paranoid that she was planning to put me on a PIP and needed ""evidence"" that she was asking me to correct things so if I slipped up she could pounce on putting me on a PIP. 

Anyway - I put my resume out there right after Christmas and got a much better sounding job. When I gave my notice to my boss she didn't even care. Which leads me to believe she was trying to get rid of me. She's been my boss for 6 years and she didn't become toxic until about a year ago. It's done damage to my ability to trust others ava trust in myself. I find myself really anxious about going to my new job and hoping that I'm as good at my job as I think I am. I sometimes catch myself wondering ""what if she is right and I'm a defensive asshole that can't do anything right?!"" -- but I know thats not true.

This portion is more uncomfortable rather than ""painful"".

They may have pushed the stone back in the bladder when you got the cath. I have a very uncomfortable almost UTI feeling when the stone is in the bladder (CONSTANT urge to pee, very uncomfortable). Normally the bladder-to-out part is pretty fast, but I've had it take over a week to finally leave. They're unpredictable so it's hard to say. Keep drinking.

AskReddit,femtozq,t1_fek4bh6,1579269310.0,"Yep for sure. It's hard too because no one else really understands what you do in your department. I always end up working 50+ hours a week.

One time when I actually got to leave at 5, a colleague said something like ""oh you always get to keep banking hours [off at 5pm], while the rest of us stay - must be nice!"". I got so irrationally angry by that. Because it wasn't true. And if he were to say that (who knows, maybe he did at another time), in the presence of others, then all the gossipy people would start spreading that I'm lazy. No one there could verify either way since my boss is in other state and I have no one else in my department. His comment wasn't ""bad"" - but the fact I'm all alone it means every comment can be considered an attack on my reputation.

I only have 3 direct reports, but 2 are much older, and the generational difference in the workplace is troublesome at times, especially being a manager and having to discipline/correct people who are my parents age. I know I'm good at what I do though. But it's isolating for sure. I have colleagues that try to reach out and be friendly, but I have a hard time trusting colleagues. I don't want to get too close or share too much - as a manager I feel I can't ""be myself"" in case something slips that can damage my reputation (or someone can flat out lie about you). I also travel between two locations and find myself just dreading the thought of going in to either of them - but my corporate boss insists that I show my face frequently at both locations (it's all just for show - I can easily do my job at home). 

Anyways - this past year I put my resume out there about 3 different times but kept chickening out every time I'd get an email about a phone interview. My husband finally told me to just go along with it this last time and actually attend an interview. 

That was right after Christmas and I just accepted a job at a new place this week (I won't start for a few weeks). It looks like a much better gig.

AskReddit,femrwss,t1_femppln,1579267858.0,"I mean, I felt that way in school, but I actually didn't mind being an outsider (ok, yes I did mind -- but it was easier to remain hopeful). Back then I was able to keep telling myself ""I will graduate eventually and none of these people will matter anymore"". And there were summers off and winter breaks. Don't get me wrong - I was miserable, but it was so short lived in comparison to life as a whole. In the adult world it's a lot more like high school than I ever would've imagined - except it's a lot harder to feel hopeful. Instead of ending eventually at 18 years old with the whole world ahead of you, it drags on for 40+ YEARS and by the end of it you'll be old and nearly dead.

Now with that said, I still would never ever trade places with my pre-teen/teenage self. Those years were terrible. At least now as an adult I have my own home and created my own family - that's invaluable in my mind.

AskReddit,fcsoruy,t1_fcsnb1g,1577921313.0,"Food in general is pricy - but yeah, anything that's a ""specialty"" item (vegan, gluten free, whole food/healthy etc) is marked up. Luckily veggies, rice, potatoes, beans, and tofu are pretty affordable.

vegan,fcrvt9x,t1_fcrq3e7,1577907301.0,"Because vegetarians can eat pretty much all the same foods: pizza (just eat cheese or veggie), cake, donuts, bagels, candy/chocolate. They can share meals and snacks with others without much or any accommodation - so people don't think it's that big of a deal. Also, most people assume vegetarians avoid meat because they just don't like it - I don't think people assume they do it for ethical reasons. Vegans, on the other hand, are much more difficult to accommodate. People see this as a big inconvenience and as if veganism is too extreme. Vegans can't enjoy snacks/meals with others as easily, so they are forced into being center of attention when trying to order to share food with others. People also assume they do it for ethical reasons, which is odd to most people (""who cares about cows/chickens??"")"
