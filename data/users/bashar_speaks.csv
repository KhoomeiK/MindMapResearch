Laugh about it. Let things be, don't have such a controlling attitude about other people's behavior. You might not feel like you are being controlling, but when you get into that ""don't care"" mindset where behavior like hers does not bother you anymore, the previous mindset seems that way.

On a practical level, perhaps it'd help to commiserate with the other students, make fun of her and make jokes about it."

Look dude, mental differences are real. The people who have them can't just lift themselves up by their bootstraps if you keep kicking and shaming them enough. He can't do basic math and reading, probably has a low attention span and executive functioning issues, and that probably gives him huge self-esteem issues, he's got multiple layers of issues demotivating him.

I suggest he go to a therapist, get diagnosed with something. When he gets older he can get vocational rehab, try out different trades. And if he can't handle that, work on him getting disability payments or whatever entitlements are available for him in your country/state/locale.

Don't be ableist... just because someone can't handle academics doesn't mean they are a ""bad"" person."

I'm not a fan of these rules and standards but realistically a few bad apples ruin the entire bunch. Rules are created to keep the worst kids in line, but they have to be applied to all the kids. Making all the kids dress and have the same hairstyle prevents bullying.

It helps to put yourself in the role of the adults. They have a lot of responsibility, and children act like animals, so they do their best to come up with rules.

Here it is...

https://www.bartleby.com/17/1/62.html

A MAN and his son were once going with their Donkey to market. As they were walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said: “You fools, what is a Donkey for but to ride upon?”	  1
  So the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: “See that lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he rides.”	  2
  So the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got on himself. But they hadn’t gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to the other: “Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along.”	  3
  Well, the Man didn’t know what to do, but at last he took his Boy up before him on the Donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them. The Man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at. The men said: “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor Donkey of yours—you and your hulking son?”	  4
  The Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied the Donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the Donkey to their shoulders. They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the Boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle the Donkey fell over the bridge, and his fore-feet being tied together he was drowned.	  5

"" If you were obese, it might be more obvious to more people that they shouldn't make negative comments, but often with thin folks, people let the insults or back-handed compliments fly because they don't think the other person will be sensitive about it."
Advice,fdow1k2,t3_emi1ew,1578614172.0,"""Appearance"" isn't everything. If you look like model but when you open your mouth you sound like trailer park or ghetto trash then that will close a lot of doors for you. There are pretty much zero men who are so ugly that dressing well, being confident, being articulate/well-spoken, and being in shape isn't enough to make themselves attractive. 

Simple empirical observation show that plenty of men who are 4'10, or have some glaring facial physical deformity, missing arms and legs, so fat they are confined to bed, guys with ""werewolf syndrome"", etc. can get a girlfriend. Meanwhile there are so many awkward nerds who are 6'3 conventionally attractive white males who are incels because they can't be bothered to wear clothes that fit and learn to not walk around scowling and glaring at everyone like a serial killer.

But I don't mean to minimize your problems. Confidence doesn't just magically appear when you summon it. The kind of mental blocks you struggle with are formidable and often normies don't understand, and don't help when they like ""just beee yourself dude!"" It is hard work but you can do it, it's just you don't realize that you can do it.

I don't know what you look like but so many people act like their bad looks are endemic when all they have to do is get a better haircut, shave, smile, etc. Most people severely understimate how much their choices affect their perceived attractiveness, and ""attractive people"", as soon as they gain some weight or age a bit, or get a bad camera angle suddenly they are ""ugly"". E.g."" compare Billy Bob Thornton in Switch Blade vs. how he looks in other movies.

But starting from where you are, ironically what you need is to learn to be more humble. Be willing to approach women and get rejected, get a negative reaction, be willing to make mistakes and accept the consequences gracefully. Be willing to look in mirror and make changes to how you groom and carry yourself.

It helps a lot to focus on some other area of life where you feel better about yourself. Maybe you have a hobby you are passionate about, or you are kicking ass at your career/school work. Abraham Hicks often talks about it in terms of a metaphor of ""picking up sticks"", e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NR7MtRbFvA . Then when you get that feeling of confidence, feeling good, not being self-conscious, then that puts you in a state where you are more receptive to positive interactions and being your best, most attractive self."

You're doing that thing where you crush on a girl just because she's in your vicinity and pays basic attention to you. Dating coworkers perfectly fine, practically everyone met their S.O. at work.... BUT only IF you can be cool about it which I doubt judging from this post. If you are single you should be dating around, flirting with all the girls instead of getting hung up on one girl who clings to you at work because she's new and lonely and insecure and you're the quiet ""safe"" guy. Promising romances do not spring from that situation."

Advice,fca0os8,t3_eguuqc,1577561075.0,"Like I always tell kids here: the key to deal with bad parents is to embarrass them as often as possible. Don't keep secrets for them. Tell every adult you meet about what you going through and how your mother is abusing and neglecting you. It usually won't get you instant good results, it'll cause conflict but in the end you'll be 10000000% better off. 

Bad parents are usually narcissistic, in other words: they see their children as property they can do what they please with. Instead of caring about reason, kindness and empathy, they care about what other people say / think of them. Go to every adult you know ask them to talk to your mother for you because whatever they say will carry more weight with her."
