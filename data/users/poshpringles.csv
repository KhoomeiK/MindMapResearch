writersspotlight,ff8meb0,t3_es0gvi,1579685732.0,"“You... you didn’t have to do this, we were friends.”



“Best friends.” He corrected.



“Yet you hurt me, you’ve been using everything we saved each other against to destroy me, all my secrets, the ones I confided to you, are out in the open, yet you say we were best friends.”



“Facts are facts. And deep down you know exactly why I’m doing all this. You’re afraid to acknowledge it, you coward.” And with that I felt a punch knock my lights out. The same fists that used to train besides me were being used on me. I think more than my body, it was my heart that hurt.



Days pass, and he gets worse, bad enough to have gained a reputation for being a bully. The word sounded funny to me. Best friend to bully, sounded like a teen fiction. But it was reality and I was at the centre of it.



The say, wars last generations. But I hoped our would end, just because our fathers and grand fathers were blood thirsty enemies didn’t mean we had to carry it on. I extended out my hand to that injured boy years ago because I was done with the war... 



But family messes up doesn’t it? He was angry, and it was justified, all I could do was bear the brunt, my father orphaned him... and it was tonight that I learned of this... I was his best friend but I couldn’t save him from my family. I had no idea what destruction he’d been going through.



I have to apologise, with these thoughts I ran out, rode a fast as I could in the moonlit night, to where it all began. The river.



The silver light lit up his figure, he was there on the bridge, where we had always met up. His eyes showed anger as he saw me.  I ran as fast as my feet carried me, I fell at his feet. 



“I had no idea. I’m so sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you, I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you.” I begged and repented .



“Do you know, the night he came, your father. He held a gun to dad’s head, to my already bed ridden dad’s head, do you know what he said?”


“Please... forgive me....”




“He said he wanted the throne empty, so you could rule. He held you dear like mine held me. But his love was wicked and he pulled the trigger. Another fire to finish the job....” his eyes were teary now. “Just as he left, I came running in, he looked me in eyes, smiled and left. I didn’t raise my hand nor my gun, because you.... you didn’t want a war...”



“I... didn’t mean for this to happen.” My eyes were wet, I slowly realised the agony I put him through, he lost his father because I didn’t uphold my promise to save him as friends should, he lost his chance to fight back because I was his friend.... but I... I was just a grand talker. I didn’t even know until months after what had happened, I had failed him.




“But you... you didn’t care did you? Busy with trying to get into college as the families and their allies tore each other apart, war doesn’t stop because you want it to. You just wanted your way out. So even though we were friends, best friends, I was angry. I decided to use your way to escape against you.” He sighed. “Because thats what cowards deserve.”




And with that my mind was numb I felt his punches but they didn’t hurt because my guilt had already killed me. I was no friend, I was worse than an enemy. I was a failure.





I grabbed his collar, and hugged him tight, ignoring his violent struggle to get out of the hug.




“Stop, listen to me...” 




He stopped... I felt his shoulders relax. 





“I’ve always loved you, I still do, we were brothers and more, but I made a mistake, I failed you...” I was crying now, the tears wetting his shirt.





“I thought, us getting in would save us, that we’d run away off to make our futures, our families.” I embraced him tighter. “But the throne you and I were destined to, a throne that shouldn’t have existed, it still existed and I forgot to burn it down...”





“You really did” I felt his arms embrace me back.





“Today, I’ll set it on fire. You’ll be free. No longer hurting. I can’t erase the pain, but I can stop it further. Once I forfeit, my father won’t fight you, he never was trying to fight you, only the ones that held the throne and you just got caught in the middle of it all. Power is a dirty game... I’m sorry I made you play while talking of freedom.”





And with that, I pushed him away. All it took was silver night and a bleeding heart to push me out. I felt the cool embrace of the river water, I felt the light lift me up, our fight was over, his pain had ended. My friend had suffered enough, so I drowned out all that made him miserable. 




The water fought with my body but it felt like a mother rocking her child, he was going to survive university now, without the bully tag, he was going to make it out, the war had ended on me. The thrones were now non existant.




My mind was fading now. The light was fading now. I felt a hand, his hand.




“Running away again, you coward. We’re best friends, we stick together remember?”



I smiled, that’s all I could do as we drifted in the moonlight. 



They say wars last generations. But what if the generations don’t."
OCPoetry,ff28olg,t1_ff08367,1579497055.0,Oh thank you! I’m very glad! :D
OCPoetry,fey3jax,t1_fewlvou,1579440325.0,"Aw thank you very much, that’s very kind of you and it made me happy that you enjoyed it and liked it just as I enjoyed writing it :) I don’t dabble a whole lot in poetry so it’s encouraging of you to say so :D

I believe we all have certain preferences, like I myself enjoy rhymes, twist and word play, so the fellow critics helped out of their own preferences and goodwill and I definitely learned a few points! But to know that that others like yourself enjoy it as it is without omission is definitely a treat.

Oh and definitely!! I actually started writing the poem from the last line and then eventually came back again to it so you’re quite right about things being circular! Coming to full ends like life is meant to :)"
OCPoetry,fet3hej,t1_fesyy2p,1579371453.0,"I’m glad you liked it a bit! Ah yes, I now understand upon more careful evaluation what you guys mean, and I’ll definitely try to revise this one and do it over making it shorter, I appreciate you taking the time to read! Thank you very much :D"
OCPoetry,feprudm,t1_feogvnw,1579329137.0,"Ah you’ve caught the slight nagging criticism I had about my own poem. I’m glad you liked it, and I’ll definitely try and make it shorter and sharper in a sense, I think it’ll definitely make the final verse more impactful since the reader won’t be bored already! I think I was really just trying to show how dear or love like it all was that I ended up over describing and explaining too much. So I’ll try to work on saying more in less words!
Thank you for taking the time to read and advise, I appreciate it! :D"
OCPoetry,feprona,t1_fenncii,1579328988.0,"Oh definitely, we’re all here learning and being inspired by each other and as long as it’s constructive we’re good! Thank you once again :)"
OCPoetry,fendvt2,t1_fen4i8n,1579282585.0,"Hi! I really appreciate what a detailed feedback you’ve given, thank you very much!!

I get what you mean, being a sucker for rhymes myself I might have actually made those awkward mistakes you’ve mentioned, I’ll definitely work on trying to give them a more of a natural flow!

And you’re very right, perhaps the line wasn’t really clear, I was actually trying to say that it’s a feeling that very few other feelings can match or outrank in the amount of happiness it brings or how dear it is.

I do want that final line to hit harder so I’ll take your advice and edit it to hopefully eliminate those two verses, thank you once again!!! I’m grateful for your advice and will try and heed it to the best of my abilities, definitely a lot to learn! 

Hope you have a great day! :D"
OCPoetry,femnura,t3_epy2sc,1579264087.0,"I like the poem itself, the idea of the moon singing and warning enchants me. It just leaves me a bit confused about what’s actually happening, maybe it could clear up the relationship a bit more? Otherwise the format is clear, easy to read, so it actually had me read to the end! Precise and rhyming are a big bonus as well! Good going :)"
OCPoetry,femnez8,t3_epvcgc,1579263632.0,"I really enjoyed this poem!
It takes me through and makes me imagine as if I’m the one that’s actually exploring. I feel the sentiments as you write, and at the end it made me excited, excited to finally touch the beautiful moon making my run wild to the possibilities of how I’d embrace it. Though I reckon a few more rhyming verses would really be the cherry on top. Good going :)"
wholesomememes,feh1j1i,t1_fegv5e2,1579107199.0,"Oh my goodness I’m all hyped hearing that, I can’t wait to see smiles! I love smiles, and it’s a double treat if they are because of me, thank you for the reminder!! :D"
wholesomememes,fegq3me,t1_fego2ak,1579099872.0,"That’s a great idea! Your mum is super cool for that.
I used to gift things and food throughout highschool (thank you mum, aren’t they they best :D) but your comment and this post made me realise that I can do this for my current and future teachers as well! I’m excited to start again! (The card idea is now on my list!) :)"
AskReddit,fegkaiy,t1_fegfhpe,1579095338.0,Does... does that mean you’re actually in those 20 minutes?!
wholesomememes,fegjy99,t3_ep1mml,1579095046.0,"Aww man, it’s just amazing how some teachers step out of their ways to make us feel happy, to make an otherwise dreadful journey very fun, they’re truly gems we tend to overlook."
interestingasfuck,fegjpqz,t3_ep1e7p,1579094851.0,That looks so nice and calm!! Can we actually swim in it?
tumblr,feg5h92,t3_eopj2j,1579077832.0,Ohh I can totally see that happening!!
DoesAnybodyElse,fcq3lq2,t3_eighg9,1577877990.0,"Yes! It feels like everything inside is jammed, like I just can’t move, I want to but each task seems so much huger and tougher than it is!! But somehow I barely escape from the consequences and promise to not do that again, except next time I’m all chained up again."
ApplyingToCollege,fc0o7dd,t3_efh3em,1577295714.0,"I know this was written from an ace students point, but it’s still so comforting for me as someone who spiralled down through highschool from an ace to barely C. It’s comforting to know that life doesn’t work by the book, that everyone has a chance and that we shouldn’t let it consume us. I find myself wanting a prestigious university but then I realise I’m lucky enough even if I get into one with my grades. Your post was a comfort. Thank you :)"
