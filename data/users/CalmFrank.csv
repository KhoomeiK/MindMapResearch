Get help, dude. Are you already seeing a Therapist or a Pdoc? Please seriously consider it. It can Take Time before finding the right Therapist or the right Meds Combination for Yourself.

depression,fdyufkh,t3_encf03,1578783680.0,"I am so sorry, dude. I am so sorry your Brother is dying and that you're struggling so much yourself. Can I ask You what is He Dying of? You don't have to Answer.

You will get through this one step at the time. Please don't be hard on Yourself. It takes strength to go through what you're going through and be still there, standing! I know I certainly wouldn't be able to as much as you. See it as a sign of strength. It will take time yo get through ALL of this!

Is there anyone IRL you can turn up to? Friends? Family? Anyone? Please do. Of course we are here for You as well.

Try your best. You are the strongest. I'm not sure what your Dreams are, but don't give up Hope. If you're feeling Suicidal, call a Suicide Prevention Hotline or check Yourself to the Nearest Hospital.

You can do this and You've got this. I am so sorry for Your Brother, dude! Keep us updated! Fingers crossed and many Hugs and Positive Vibes to BOTH You and Your Family! :) :D"

Are you currently sering a Therapist? If not. Give it a try. It takes time before finding the right ""match"". I'd say about 4 or 5 attempts. Also, that way uou can show your Girlfriend that you're REALLY trying and that you WANT to get better.
If she leaves You, don't take it too personally. You need to be with someone who will TRULY Love You and Accept You for WHO YOU TRULY AND REALLY ARE, WITH FLAWS AND ALL! In any case, keep taking care of Yourself and surround Yourself only with people who actually CARE about You! We are here for you as wll! Keep posting! We do care! PROMISE! :) :D"

It seems like those Professionals haven't been too useful. Please keep looking. It takes time before finding the right one. I'd say at least 4 or 5 attempts. Also try to see if there are sone Meds that you haven't tried out yet or some new Combinations.
I'm sorry if this isn't too helpful. I sincerely Hope that things will improve. Talk to me if it can help. We are all here for you and we DO care. I'm Wishing You NOTHING BUT THE BEST, DUDE! :) :D"
