Interestingly, there is also an instrument called a **melodica** that produces sound in the same way a harmonica does, so it sounds similar.

(Try cooking mushrooms without salting them. You're gonna have a bad time.)

DnDHomebrew,ffqwhqm,t1_ffottpt,1580145223.0,"> Like the Ranger class itself, this subclass is definitely intended to work best against a particular type of enemy- in this case, creatures with Darkvision. I think a lot of subclasses are kind of like that, where you have to be a little discerning about what setting you're playing in. For example, if you're playing in a campaign where interplanar travel never happens, you're going to be pretty disappointed with the Horizon Walker's ability to detect portals.

Good points, all. 

As for *light* cantrip vs. magical darkness--I dunno, it just seems off to me to make it an automatic win. I'm sure there's a middle ground that would empower it more than a regular cantrip without going quite that far. What about:

> This light counts as a 2nd-level spell for the purposes of overcoming magical darkness. This effect increases when you reach certain levels in this class: the light counts as a 3rd-level spell when you reach 5th level; as a 4th-level spell when you reach 11th level; and as a 5th-level spell when you reach 17th level.

*Daylight* is a perfect fit, but it's already a ranger spell, and my preference would be to use that feature to grant spells not already on the ranger spell list. I think you can trust that people will take *daylight* anyway.

I might be way overthinking this, so take all of what I said with a grain of salt. Just something to think about."

DnDHomebrew,ffnhr2c,t3_eu4s6h,1580066136.0,"I love light-themed character options, but I have a few critiques of this one. First, I don't think you can declare that a *light* cantrip trumps all magical darkness. Magical darkness and magical light are treated as a contest against each other where the higher-level spell wins, or if they're the same level, whichever was cast more recently wins. Even as a subclass specialty, it doesn't make sense that a cantrip would beat a 2nd-level (or higher) spell.

By contrast, Turn the Dark actually seems a bit weak to me. Humanoids are one of the most common monster types, if not *the* most common. Then to limit it further to only those with darkvision (no capital D, by the way) seems unnecessary. I would suggest ""*Each hostile creature within 30 feet of you that can see you*"".

Finally, a general note: pay attention to how the official books' style conventions and standardized phrasing. For instance, none of the following words should be capitalized: ranger, light (cantrip name; spells are italicized but not capitalized except where they include a person's name), frightened, darkvision, radiant (damage type), blindness."
