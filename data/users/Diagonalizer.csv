 The catch would be that you don't get paid for days you don't work after you run out of sick time. some people need the money to make ends meet so instead of taking the unpaid time off from work to recover they go to work sick and get their colleagues sick."

BetterEveryLoop,feiodlg,t1_fegti0q,1579143243.0,"TL;DR yes they are this awesome

I have a 3 year old Husky. Had her since Thanksgiving of 17 she has greatly improved my life and she is a wonderful companion.

 Very smart and can be trained but as others have mentioned can be stubborn and and Huskies are notorious for their VERY high prey drive. 

She took a while to get used to playing with other dogs (I think she spent lots of time in and out of shelters)  but now lives with 2 or 3 other dogs bigger than her (one visits a lot so while he doesn't live here she gets to play with him 2 or 3 days a week) and she gets along really well with them all. Used to have bad resource guarding tendencies but we've mostly trained that out of her. 

I will say I underestimated the fur shedding and the amount of exercise she needs to be well behaved before adopting. now I have gotten used to my clothing and house always being covered in fur and I look forward to walking her literally EVERY day. She probably gets 10 or 15 miles of walking per week. Big time commitment but it has improved my health in the process."
