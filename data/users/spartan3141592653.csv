No, I didn't. Due process has nothing to do with whether or not you are proven guilty. The definition of due process is: fair treatment through the normal judicial system, especially as a citizen's entitlement. That fair treatment doesn't mean innocent until proven guilty, it means every person is treated the same. If everyone was guilty until proven innocent, as long as everyone was treated the same, it meets the standard of due process. In case you try to point out that that, ""isn't fair"", Fair: in accordance with the rules or standards; legitimate.

TLDR: Due process is NOT literally innocent until proven guilty, it means everyone gets the same, complete treatment under the law.

##Part 1

I agree that if you are arrested without probable cause, your freedom is being denied without due process, but I still disagree that the fourth amendment does not on its own support innocent until proven guilty. It is at best, situational support. 

##Part 2

I didn't say hardly discuss it, I said tangentially touch the subject. These amendments offer support for innocent until proven guilty, however, these amendments would not alone result in innocent until proven guilty. The support is only noticeable once the concept already exists. To use your example of percentages, let's say for the sake of argument that in order for the principle to exist, it needs to be proven by preponderance of the evidence. This isn't saying you are barely innocent or 1% innocent, this is saying that unless and until the principle is shown by more than half the evidence, you are guilty until proven innocent. These amendments together may provide say 20% of the evidence, however they together are still not enough for the principle to exist.

#3rd paragraph response: 

#Part 1

You lied by saying that it was explicitly stated that one was acquitted until proven guilty with that being no where stated in the amendment. I also would not say that it is a fundamental idea of the 5th amendment. Let's go line by line to see what it says, shall we?

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, (No one will be convicted of a crime)

unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, (unless a jury convicts them)

 except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, (unless that person is in the military)

when in actual service in time of War or public danger; (self explanatory)

So far, there hasn't been anything about innocent until proven guilty, so let's continue.

nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; (If a jury gives a unanimous not guilty verdict, you can't be tried for the same crime)

Still nothing about the concept. Side note, I said unanimous verdict, because otherwise it's usually a hung jury, which you can then be tried again for. Moving on.

 nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, (no self incrimination, what most people remember this amendment for)

 nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; (The state can not deprive you of your rights without due process. See paragraph response one)

Still hasn't said anything about it yet, what about the last part?

nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. (The government can't commandeer anything without at some point compensating the owner)

Huh. It seems that not only is it not a main idea of the 5th amendment, it isn't even a minor point.

You wouldn't have to go against the 5th amendment to say it isn't in there, because it isn't in the 5th amendment, period. The wording means that once it was added to the judicial process, the 5th amendment supports and indeed requires it, however the 5th amendment in no way added it.

##Part 2

Now here's were it gets really interesting. Are you ready?

#I WAS NEITHER TRYING TO GET RID OF NOR ARGUE AGAINST THE CONCEPT OF INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

If you'll go back to the first comment, you'll notice that I was saying a fun fact, that it is not laid out in the Constitution. In fact, one thing I haven't said up to this point is that it's unconstitutional or should be abolished. 

Then in my second comment I was pointing out that the fact I stated was, in fact, true. It isn't in the 5th amendment, and while the 4th, 8th, and 14th support it, you couldn't say, based off of those alone that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. In fact, in [the entire transcript of US v Coffin](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/156/432), the word amendment does not ever appear.

To be absolutely clear, innocent until proven guilty is no where in any part of the Constitution, nor is it found in any part of all current amendments. Innocent until proven guilty comes from British common law, and dates back to Rome. The case of U.S. v Coffin is a confirmation of common law, however it does not say that innocent until proven guilty is a guarantee under the Constitution, it says that innocent until proven is a constitutional guaranteed right for the law.

The Supreme Court doesn't on its own add to the Constitution, it makes decisions on whether or not something is constitutional. These decisions are then binding to all courts in the United States, and they are binding by common law, not because whatever decision was made was put into the Constitution."
facepalm,ffebv29,t1_ffeazx6,1579842493.0,"Just to be clear, the 5th amendment never uses the word guilty, nor does it say anything about being acquitted until proven guilty. The decision of U.S. v Coffin is what established it as an explicit legal principle in American law. 

The fourth amendment is all about search and seizure, nothing about innocence or guilt, the eighth only states, ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."" and the 14th amendment has only one part with any relation to this; the due process clause, which only guarantees that no rights will be deprived without due process of the law.

The 4th amendment does not support innocence until proven guilty in any way, and the 8th and 14th are only tangentially related.

Exact wording of 5th amendment, ""No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."""
