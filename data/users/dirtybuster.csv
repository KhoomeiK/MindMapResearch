*whereas by middle school most soccer players have pretty much mastered the mental part of the game.* Never has anyone been more wrong on a subject. ok ok ok, right, so american football players go through colleges right? Football players come through  club academies which they can be a part of from around age 8 to 18 before they even feature for a professional first team. American football is literally set pieces, football has that, and in more variety instead of line up, throw, run, fall over (or score), stop (for fucking ages), rinse and repeat, you can jazz up all the fakes and runs all you like but at the core thats it.. 

Quality?! quality of what exactly? the repetitive plays? The static play? No. I'm sorry mate but i can't, the only sport you guys have that comes even remotely close to football is Hockey and i don't  think that really holds up a candle and actually i think is more dangerous and i think the injuries in football would be higher some of the leg breaking tackles you see will really make you wince.

Lets leave it there, you clearly have such little understanding of the sport i don't think you're capable of understanding the comparison, like a vast majority of americans  you're very blinkered when it comes to anything not american, you made that clear in the first paragraph i didn't even bother with the second.

Whats more important to a team, silverware or the cream of next years crop? The creamy crop without question. Also don't they only play for one trophy a year? a European 1st division team so long as they were successful the year before and earn their qualifications they can win up to 6 trophies in a season imagine the tactics involved to navigate  that kind of success is mind boggling (and it happens).
