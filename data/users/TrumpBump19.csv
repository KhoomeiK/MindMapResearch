WhitePeopleTwitter,ff314hp,t1_fezhl1e,1579530886.0,Your intelligence is suspect if you really believe male privilege exists.  Shit... you probably think white male privilege is a real thing. You probably believe in toxic masculinity too. The real fault lies with women. 100% of all men who have committed atrocities were born by women. So.... based on how you see the world... women really need to stop breeding such terrible men.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fedd8n4,t1_fedcens,1579008229.0,"No, but they contribute to employee 401Ks and no...USPS is not breaking even. Also pensions are a scam on the taxpayers. Federal/State employees should have to fund their own retirement account and pay for their own health insurance when they retire, just like the majority of Americans. Not get it for free. It’s not like fed or state workers are making less than their counterparts in the private sector. Often more and with little or no accountability. You ever try and fire a union worker for sucking at their job??? It’s damn near impossible. Unions are a scourge on this country."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fec4bqs,t1_febztn0,1578966457.0,"Okay, but what if I want to buy better healthcare than what the govt offers me. Do I not get that option? Do I have to settle for one level of healthcare? If I can afford it, shouldn’t I have the option to buy better healthcare for me and my family? Why take that away from me? Housing and food are a basic human rights, but I’m not living in public housing or feeding my family off of EBT or SNAP benefits. I like choices."
WhitePeopleTwitter,febzieu,t1_febx2zc,1578964582.0,That is not factually correct.
WhitePeopleTwitter,febw70w,t1_febve9h,1578963462.0,"Not in America. Not popular and not cost effective. Our government can’t get the US Post Office to breakeven, yet UPS and FedEx make billions in profits. We have the largest economy in the world, take in trillions in taxes and our government still operates at a deficit. Do you really want to trust them with something as complex as healthcare? They’ll fuck it up in a second."
WhitePeopleTwitter,febujpl,t1_febiixo,1578962876.0,"Existing and using something doesn’t mean it works. Maybe you use it, because you have no other option. Maybe you have just come to accept a certain standard of things. I like having options. I like being able to choose any doctor I want, I like being able to choose whatever health provider suits my needs and being able to change providers if I want. I don’t know about other countries, but our government pretty much sucks at anything they try and do. I trust free markets much more."

hottiesfortrump,fdsefck,t1_fdrxthi,1578700807.0,"I do. I think Trump could get 15-20% of the black vote. Winning black women could be difficult as they are solid to Dems. The Dems have kept black folk in economic and political slavery for way too long. We aren’t owned by anybody anymore! I think if Trump wins and we keep seeing record low unemployment among blacks and other POC, the Dems will lose more and more of us to Republicans or Independents as we are lifted out of poverty and into prosperity!"

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdqs7a3,t1_fdqos98,1578673748.0,"I’m glad your doing fine. Kudos! Not quite  sure what an MBA costs now or why that question is even relevant, but salaries have gone up too. My first job, post MBA, paid $70k. I have analysts working for me fresh out of their MBA program that we pay over $100k, so I’m assuming the increase in tuition has been offset by the increase in salaries."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdqgewa,t1_fdplhei,1578666016.0,"First of all.... they shouldn’t be in my country illegally, so your argument lacks merit. I don’t care if you are white, black, Hispanic or come from Germany, France or Mexico. Come here legally and I’ll support you. Secondly, not having a father around and not speaking the language is no excuse. I came over from Brazil (legally), never knew my father and didn’t speak a lick of English. Thirdly, you’re a racist and your effort to keep POCs in a perpetual state of poverty is shameful. As a black man I have seen how an influx of low skilled and poorly educated illegals coming into America has continued to depress wages for low skilled jobs, and unfortunately too many of my black and brown brothers and sisters are employed in these low skilled and low paying jobs. Your desire to maintain the status quo to maintain your privilege and power over us is sickening."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdntm7b,t1_fdnbpz1,1578592583.0,"Privileged??? You dope. That’s your go to word to justify your own failure and lack of hard work. I attended undergrad on a full athletic scholarship....again through out working everyone else (something you know nothing about). Also did an accelerated MBA program, so I could finish in 15 months versus 2 years and only take out $60k, plus I bartended during my MBA to further reduce my debt load. Don’t point a finger at me bruh, cuz when you do, you are pointing 3 back at yourself."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdna1p3,t3_em7xa0,1578581224.0,My 401k is on track to allow me to retire 5 years earlier!! Loving life. Maybe people should aspire to work more than a minimum wage job and then they can afford things themselves. BTW... first in my family to go to college and then get my MBA. Came out $60k in debt from grad school. Paid it off in 10 years. Never thought it was my “right” to have my student loan forgiven.  Anyone can do it.
