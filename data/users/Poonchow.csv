Apparently I reported the issue too late (I was at fucking work, I can't know if my delivery got there in time). I reported it undelivered 9 hours later ... after I got home and saw nothing on my doorstep. Yeah, your picture of my door with a package sitting there was super helpful, thanks. Never had an issue with USPS who just put stuff in my mailbox if I wasn't home, or took to the post office for me to pick up.

The things I bought were stupid small:  envelope sized stuff. I didn't care about the little shit, I cared about the gift cards I ordered for my family -- which Amazon refused to refund. Can't you track that shit? The card numbers have to be digitally activated, right? After spending a few hours with heavy Indian accents I just gave up. Fuck Amazon. I'd rather drive around all day than deal with that nightmare again. I reported the cards stolen, if that's not enough to get a refund, I don't know what the fuck is.

Either hand me something in person or put it in my mailbox (oh wait, you can't, you aren't USPS). I work at night, so I can get anything during the day like a normal delivery service. Showing up at 7pm on a tuesday and leaving it on my doorstep is bullshit, because between shitty drivers and shitty neighbors, things get stolen, and unless you're willing to take that loss for the added efficiency of having your own driving force, you don't get my business.

Fuck Amazon. Never giving them a penny again."

Practice the right way to do the thing, whether it's kicks, punches, or Starcraft APM test / micro. Be variable. Rest on it and work on it in equal measure. Once you work through it, you're golden, it doesn't come back unless you revert to bad habits, but it's the practice that makes perfect, and it's a rare thing to have perfect practice (but it is easier than having a perfect performance).

Chiropractors work in a weird middle-ground between performance art and physical therapy that makes it easy for some to find relief. I think it's overall good if people can get help from it, but I'd never put it on the same medical position is as physical therapy."
DotA2,ff8n11t,t1_ff8kivq,1579686712.0,"I imagine it's pretty common to have one tiny thing wrong that throws the pain-center in your brain into haywire mode. Fix that little problem and you can sort out the rest. Sometimes it's just the neurons thinking ""this thing is fucked!"" and until those neurons get a chance to switch off, they're always going to think there's an issue. Lots of evidence suggests chiropractors are a sham and lots of anecdotes suggests the opposite. 

It's probably helpful overall but not as a medical science. Kind of like acupuncture and the like. It works and it doesn't, but that doesn't mean it can't work.

It can also be the case that you changed the way you perform and exercise so that the problem got fixed by your own building of muscle and your stance, gait, the way you tense up, which muscles you use for particular exercises and actions etc, and what you needed most was a break from bad habits.

There's evidence that suggests we do most of our deep learning while we sleep, for example. Healthy breaks from a repeated stress are good, even physical ones, especially if you were doing things wrong to begin with.

It's like running. You'd think running is the simplest fucking thing on the planet. We're literally apes who evolved to run down gazelle in Africa -- we are weak, we have no venom, we don't have claws, we have legs and can sweat and we have big ol' brains doing this shit for millennia -- so you'd think every human knows how to properly run, right? Nah, it's just a billions-dollar industry to fix running injuries and make proper running shoes etc. People fuck it up constantly and always come up with ""new"" ways to do it.

Proper form is so incredibly important, especially with repeat actions. Fuck something up once and you probably don't notice, but fuck it up 10,000 times and you get all sorts of bad stuff happening."
DotA2,ff8mtxe,t1_ff7zewj,1579686411.0,"A good physical therapist will recommend different things on a case-by-case basis, including who to go to to get the treatment you need. A lot of times it's a combination of exercises, proper rest, and sometimes surgery and the right drugs. Chiropractors can have a lot of success but it could just be the placebo effect in action. The human body is meant to break down and rebuild in certain ways, but when it's done wrong it leads to chronic pain, and the brain is so powerful you can sometimes just circumvent it all (or there's the opposite effect, where you don't believe the treatment is working so it doesn't work).

There's a [Kurzegast video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPPPFqsECz0) that talks about making a gratitude notebook. Just write about stuff you are grateful for a few times a week and it honestly helps keep your priorities in perspective. It's a little reminder that things aren't so bad and you always have something to fight for. If you go out now, it's all lost, but as long as you're here, that list is worth committing to.

A first draft isn't even half the work.

Also, George's story is a fucking mess. Part of what's taking so long is there's like 20 plots and 50 POV characters and 30 relevant settings. Trying to wrangle all that must be a godamned nightmare.

Also also, George obviously doesn't have the discipline he used to. The main obstacle to getting something published is sitting down and just writing the damn thing. King and Sanderson treat it like a 9-5 job; they carve out hours to work and they sit down to write and don't stop until those hours are up. They clock in, almost every day, and that's why they get shit done. George seems to faff it up with conventions and interviews and side projects but doesn't treat writing the main series like a day job."
books,ff8i658,t1_ff8h0o9,1579679588.0,"I think almost every successful author has their merits, their strengths, and weaknesses. Sanderson finishes stories, and he finishes them well.

Things that are obvious in retrospect. If you are not impressed by quality plots or fantasmical magic systems, you probably won't like Sanderson very much.

Rothfuss dedicates a ton of time and effort to his prose and characterization. In the King Killer books, there's at least one killer sentence on each page that made me pause and think, ""damn, I wish I had written that."" The trade is that we haven't gotten a new book in almost a decade."

scifiwriting,fewvbcz,t3_eqn726,1579420050.0,"In addition to all the other advice here, try to think about the voice of individual characters.

It takes me, on average, ~ 20,000 words to find a clear voice in my work. Sometimes I get a character right away, sometimes it takes a while to figure out the dialogue, but in general, I don't really ever feel comfortable with my narration until like 4-5 chapters deep in a story. It sort of just clicks and makes the rest of the work much easier to write.

So, my advice is to think about how the *individuals* talk. What sort of cadence, mannerisms, terms of phrase do you think a grease-monkey who loves engines uses versus a hot-shot pilot? How do you keep these fresh so they aren't stereotypical?

Also, you can steal. Not whole-cloth, but like, Firefly and Mass Effect and Star Trek and a million other works all do this pretty well. Just start with something *you know* and keep going until it sounds like it's *yours*. The rest comes in editing."

Luke realizes the consequences to his actions at the beginning of TLJ and decides to train Rey only for all the crazy bullshit to still go south, then Luke does what he does.

I'm curious what your source is for such a claim, because from what I've actually read, Johnson was approached and began writing the script when he saw the first edit of TFA. He wrote it, he didn't throw away a script. Maybe you're confusing that with Disney turning down George Lucas' ideas?"

To me the sequel trilogy gave way too much to JJ Abrams and his mystery-box bullshit for it to ever come out as a coherent story.

TLJ was a reaction to TFA and its lack of answers. They gave Rian Johnson complete control over something that was all set-up and no pay-off, then everyone got pissy when it went in an unexpected direction. Could TLJ have done a better job of appeasing fans while pushing limits? Absolutely. I really didn't like how it takes place immediately after TFA, or its boring sub-plots, or it's lack of character progress for Finn, and its insistence on subverting expectations, but the Luke + Rey + Kylo stuff was top notch.

Then ROS was a reaction to TLJ... it's like a nested function where you haven't initiated the variables properly.

Disney should have gotten Kasdan, Zahn, and Filoni (or any successful Star Wars writers) to hash out a 3-movie arc before they even found a director. Fuck, bring Lucas in as creative adviser as well, it's not like his ideas were ever the main problem with Star Wars, it was just the lack of people telling him ""no"" when George Lucas became... well, George fucking Lucas.

Get a few passionate, already successful Star Wars writers in a group chat and tell them they need to come up with a good story that can be told in ~6 hours. Threads from previous films, comics, games, and books are all fair play. See what they come up with. Lucas can be the litmus test.

You have this amazing example in your pocket with Marvel on how modern audiences expect their multi-film arcs to play out, why not use what's proven true in the safest way possible by planning out the *story* before you jump in with the execution part? The writing process is the simplest and probably the cheapest aspect to execute for a production this massive. Kathleen Kennedy has blinders on with regards to guys like JJ Abrams. We get it, you're friends, but something as important as Star Wars is to culture in general shouldn't be a reactive composite of business deals and trading hand-jobs.

Once you start getting directors and casting and actual production involved, you NEED a fucking story. Every professional actor and director says that the script is the bible, so start with a good script."

Gender is either fluid or static or somewhere in between, but if there's one thing I'm confident in, it's that misery is a default coefficient in the life equation, so trading one flavor of misery for another seems highly risky.

I doubt they have special formulas and prices for one company out of hundreds unless it's a very small discount (Coke makes money by selling soda, why undercut when you don't need to?)"

Set up regulatory markets where pollution is taxed. A pollution tax means that things like meat farms and old cars cost more, higher costs means market shifts, market shifts mean changing behavior. Anything that causes a negative environmental outcome should be treated as a health risk and taxed appropriately. It creates incentives to do things in a way that doesn't pollute the environment while also turning a profit.

We used this same strategy with tobacco. Tax it and people will realize ""oh shit this is expensive."" Make products cost what they actually cost, not just to produce and sell, but their total economic impact, from production to their health impact. This doesn't mean everything becomes more expensive, it just means that the worse proponents see their cost of doing business go up, and those who do less are rewarded, either with increased business or rebates.

Invest in AI that can predict and react to problems faster than humans can. AI is often toted as a boogey man in popular science, and it can be, but it can also be our savior if we tackle it properly. Some are already doing so, but real public pressure to advance the tech will mean a system of solutions that betters our chances at a real future. We're in a global age of commerce and impact, so we need systems that can actuate that enormous amount of data and make good decisions."

The thing is, individuals account for a tiny percentage of overall carbon pollution, and it's only through elective policy changes that we can change the industries that are actually causing the most damage.

People want to go on holiday because they want to go on holiday. They largely aren't thinking about the carbon impact. If you force the airlines through regulation to be more mindful of the environment, then you don't need to change people's behavior (almost impossible, people just do what they want because they can) to make massive headway in stoppering pollution.

People keep talking about sacrifices and giving things up... but it's industry and businesses that need to change, people will follow suit because they don't have the option to do otherwise. The sacrifices need to come from the top first, the rest will follow."
videos,fd8rnuz,t1_fd7li9c,1578222429.0,"You alone account for something like 1.3 x e^10 of the carbon footprint on this planet, given that every individual has the same potential impact (they don't, but for the sake of argument and math let's just assume we all do).

That's astronomically tiny.

You could be carbon negative with your lifestyle; rely solely on solar energy, compost, garden, recycle everything possible, reduce your consumption and re-use anything that can be, walk or ride a bike everywhere instead of drive, etc. and you're saving pennies on carbon waste versus the 1,000's used daily by a small manufacturing plant.

You could spend your entire life throwing trash in ponds, smoking, burning shit in your lawn, buying processed meat just to throw it away at a constant rate, doing anything you can to pollute the world and you'd probably have less negative impact than your local grocery store does in a week.

The scales are massively tipped toward industry.

We are also notoriously bad at changing behavior. What we can change is policy, and policy affects changing behavior. Seatbelts and car safety, smoking, littering, health codes, fire safety, vaccines... all became better over decades due to government *policy* changes, not individuals simply deciding to change. Individuals might enact change, but they very largely don't affect it unless you happen to be super rich or super famous.

So, while it is admirable that you are making a difference (I also do what I can to change my behavior to help, if anything to feel better about my stance and challenge others to see my perspective), voting and convincing others to vote for a greener future is far more effective than anything else you could do. Convincing your local government officials that you will fire them for bad policy and find someone who thinks more like you does more than any amount of recycling, EV driving, or vegan eating can do, because leaders that put policy in place can cause *millions* of other individuals to change their behavior to more closely fit your perspective, and cause industries that rely on those millions to buy their products to change their behavior as well."

Humans lost fur and kept hair in specific spots, so it didn't just show up in those areas versus others, first. We lost fur because it was holding us back (causing us to overheat, likely). The reason we kept pronounced hair on our heads, pits, and pubic regions are also probably multi-variabled: hair on the head protects us from sun burn, hair in the armpits helps regulate heat when sweating while also making us very smelly (which can be a good thing to warn predators), and pubic hair can signal to potential mates that we are able to procreate.

Australia broke records for heat these past weeks, which should be concerning by itself, but that added heat means less moisture which means greater potential for disaster. A tiny increase in heat mixed with a tiny decrease in precipitation results in climate events that are supposed to happen ever 1,000 years or so but are now increasing in frequency due to all the added energy in the system.

Basically, the electoral college is a compromise to give smaller states more proportional power than their populations would do alone, even if it doesn't actually translate to more or better representation. The founders were understandably against the idea of a direct popular vote (remember you had to be a land-owning man to vote back then, they weren't really trusting of the opinions of the average citizen), and people from smaller states didn't want to be ignored in favor of the big ones.

It all breaks down because many states cast ALL their votes based on who wins a majority of the vote, so you technically could win the US Presidency with only 23% of the population voting for you, if you convinced 51% of people in the most lopsided electoral colleges. This is also why so much of the campaigning, fundraising, advertising, etc is done in a handful of states, because the others are so lopsided in their voting tendencies that they figuratively don't matter. 

Direct democracy with regards to the popular vote has its own faults. People are dumb, flighty, and easily scared into voting based on false information. This already happens, of course, but in theory the Electoral College is a safeguard against bribery, disinformation, and election tampering."

Emperor's New Clothes and all that. Everyone taking bribes is fine with it if they don't see it as a bribe.
