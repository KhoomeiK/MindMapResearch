depression,ff24l2l,t3_eqs4h8,1579493641.0,"I don’t know if this helps, but you have to rid yourself of the shit bringing you down. If it’s a job, don’t let it get to the point where you’re getting dragged down. Trust me, it’s not worth it. Find a new one. If it’s people, I’m sure you know, don’t be around them. People can be draining. That’s why they suck. I’m not trying sound like every other person, but try to find things that make you happy, or content. Maybe there are small steps to actually finding happiness. I know not everyday will be sunshine and rainbows, but maybe there’s some sort of loophole. I’m trying to find this out. Best of luck."

Advice,ff1wpuy,t3_er40xs,1579487917.0,"As far as music/songs, that’s whatever you feel is a good playlist. Playlists are a must, especially for the road. Someone mentioned New Orleans. That is one of my first suggestions. But like THEY said, NOT during Mardi Gras. It’s more expensive there. But their food is exquisite. You will see a lot, and I’m not just talking about the structures. Austin Texas is another recommendation. They have the best bbq. If you plan on driving north, check out Mt. Rushmore. I never was there, but it’s a big tourist attraction. Western Pennsylvania has some sights. In the city of Pittsburgh, if you go up to the top of the one hill (via incline) in a  neighborhood called Mt. Washington, you will get a stellar view of the city. It’s crazy packed on the Fourth of July. Our food scene isn’t the greatest if you’re a foodie, but if you stop by, try a Primanti’s Sandwich, just to say you had one. Many folks go to Las Vegas. The Strip is beautiful, especially at night. Plus, deserts are cool. Not too far from there are old west ghost towns (also depends on which direction you go). Those are a sight to see. Just watch for those wild burros. You may see some. We have a bevy of landscapes. When you get here, I hope you have a great time. Just make sure you know what places to stay out of."
