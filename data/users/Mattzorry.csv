physicsgifs,fc1u6hi,t1_fc1lbqb,1577329833.0,"Fluid flow is on a sliding scale from laminar (this) to turbulent. 

If a flow is laminar, the water particles essentially travel in parallel lines and don't interact with eachother, making it look super smooth.

What the flow ends up as is controlled by a thing called the Reynolds number, which is just a combo of viscosity, density, flow velocity, and the size of the hole (for a case like this). 

So in this case, the conditions just happen to be right for laminar. Looks cold, which changes viscosity and density, and the hole is small"
