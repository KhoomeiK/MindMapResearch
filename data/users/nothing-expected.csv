I know that once someone gets snotty with my, I get snarky but, quite frankly, they really started nipping at my heels almost immediately lol. I can't really take any of it too seriously....it's strangers online. 

**And, for the other person who commented, yes, I am an anti-vaxxer and you can try to bully me on that with zero fucks given on my part as well....but thanks for taking the time to scroll through my comment hx."

TheRightCantMeme,fezo17w,t1_fezd26z,1579459526.0,"I hate to crush your delicate psyche but - focus here - people have the right to voice their opinions (whether you agree with it or not, even if it hurts your feelings)...and in doing so, possibly face the brunt of ignorant anger (which I completely expected, am facing and laughing in the process). If you don't realize that, for the most part, the parties (generally in tandem) are manipulating the ignorant masses because they are ignorant, gullible and SO EASY TO PLY. If you vote Democrat and think they give even a little fuck about you, you're deluded; if your beliefs lie in the Republican territory and you think the Republican party gives a fuck about you, you're a fool - all they care about is themselves and their ability to keep the public subservient so that we don't realize that they're all the same. I'm so sorry that I had to bed the one  to break that truth to you."

TheRightCantMeme,feymnzy,t1_feydk1y,1579447654.0,"I love that you demonstrate the bias and hate that you perceive of the right wing by being biased and hateful 😂 I've got some shocking news for you: they're all the same, they're all heinous and you're foolishly naive for jumping headfirst into the divisive bullshit that both parties spew in a (relatively successful) attempt to keep everyone - races/parties/sexes/orientations/religions at war with each other. They know that if people ever woke up and came together, they'd be a strong force and be able to call for an end to all of their misdeeds...so they keep us in a constant state of fear and hate and hopefully continue with their shenanigans. But luckily, three are fools such as yourself who are more than happy to help them all with their agenda.✌🏼

Edit to add: I'd like to thank the over 150 lovely sheeple who came out in droves to downvote me...let's see if you can't call in the herds and really get my numbers higher 😁"
needadvice,fef5n34,t3_eoiavx,1579048750.0,"I live in Central NY (east of Syracuse)  in a great smallish town, three miles from the mall, secure building, and pay $650 (includes heat) . It's a really big one bedroom fairly basic, nothing fancy but safe, quiet, comfy. It's very close to Utica (you do NOT want to live there), New Hartford, even driving distance of Syracuse for employment. I can walk (safely) to the Byrne Dairy for ice cream, a park, some of the best pizza you'll ever find and an awesome bakery. My doctor's office is 3/4 miles away as well as some great food. I couldn't ask for better."
dating_advice,fedhe6j,t3_eod7p2,1579011573.0,"I’ve got a tie for first:

~ meet a guy at Applebee's, he got antsy because a woman there serving was a family friend (he was separated). He went on to tell me that the reason I'd not heard from him for a couple weeks prior because he'd tried to make it work with a girlfriend. That he'd been on and off with fort years. While he was still married. (Big surprise, it didn't work that time either). This was well over a year ago, and although his divorce was almost final, I saw him on tinder recently and his profile still says separated and he posted that he's in the middle of a divorce. 🤨

~ meet a guy on Match and on his profile her wrote ""I have a lot of empathy"" which I find slightly odd, but after three date or all made sense. guy was late so I bought a water while I waited. He finally showed and bought himself an iced coffee. We chatted for a bit, and the guy asks me if I know the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath (I absolutely do, I literally work in mental health and specifically on the psychopathy floor lol). When I told him the difference, he argued with me because ""a friend told"" him the difference and even went in to pull out his phone and fact check me, reading a long article (I was right). That coffee date was enough to know that I wasn't interested but because of a contest, I was forced too see him weekly for a few weeks. He'd push his way in between myself and my friends, then sit there as we'd talk around him. Every time I'd perform, he'd say something passive-aggressive like ""well, that was an...interesting choice"". He ended up going on dates with a couple other women there and I guess they went even more horribly wrong than mine (verbally and text abuse, intimidation etc). I believe he was -at least - a narcissist and - at most - a socio or psychopath. Lovely gentleman 😂😂"
newyork,feap3rx,t1_feaoaho,1578950974.0,"Fair enough (especially with the foolish choices some make in their majors). But my daughter is a nurse, her husband works in HVAC; with the ridiculous cost of rent in their area (Western NY) and the overall cost of childcare, they rarely pull themselves above water, even without extensive spending or an abundance of debt."
newyork,feao75a,t1_f9pufws,1578950777.0,"Yeah not really. My daughter rents a tiny three-bedroom house and pay over $100/mo plus utilities. And if you're buying a home, you're looking at $2k/year in taxes for an average home. Add to that the exorbitant price of child care and even those with good jobs are having a hard time.

They can raise minimum wage all they want but that's just going to drive prices up all around; people working those jobs aren't going to see any kind of increase in their quality of life."

This leads me to believe that he's not interested; he already knows she's into him, he knows she's down to fool around with him, he made no move whatsoever. He already knows she's no good at being faithful; he might be down to fool around but I don't see him wanting anything real from her."
relationship_advice,fcraqvv,t1_fcqtd8c,1577899238.0,Because I don't think that's the truth; if some think he isn't interested and that was an easy way to try to dissuade her...which failed.
relationship_advice,fcrae1h,t1_fcqrmn8,1577899092.0,"Yeah I've had a (much younger) guy friend for just over two years but because he's SO MUCH younger, I friend-zoned him very hard. He's been very honest about being attracted to me for about  3/4 of that two years and even though I know he'd be good to me, I literally can't work my way to unfriend-zoning him... I've honestly tried. It doesn't help that he's very much a PC millennial who would need a written contract and detailed interactions before he’d try even a kiss (not a bad thing at all ) and I'm an old gen-xer who just needs a guy to pull me in and kiss me lol. Super hard to unfriend-zone 🤷🏽‍♀️"
relationship_advice,fcr7iem,t1_fcqospk,1577897902.0,"Ok I'm probably a pessimist when it comes to love but I had very much the same thought. Seems to me that when a guy really likes someone, they'll do whatever they can to be with them (in this case, is picture a hug, leading to a kiss, and a lot of chatting with hand holding/arms around each other).
