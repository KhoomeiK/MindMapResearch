The literature is far more mixed and obviously depends on the nature of the immigration. You are going to have a hard time convincing me a million illiterate people moving into a high tech society are going to benefit the economy any time soon, while it's quite obvious high skilled immigration in high demand fields is beneficial.

However, there are also the social problems, and contrary to the popular narrative they aren't all due to the native populations.

> It does also lead to some inevitable strain as cultures clash, but that's a passing phase.

The populations of hassidic Jews around the world beg to differ. In reality integration is hugely complex, and a handwave of 'it will be alright' is grossly negligent if nothing else. For example, if a certain group of immigrants form a seperate community without much interaction with the native populations (not uncommon, see the hasidics for many examples) then integration simply will not happen. And if there are cultural practices which we find abhorrent (FGM is a relevant example here in the UK) then that's a problem for everyone, regardless of their country or culture of origin. Ghettoisation also drives fear and distrust, which nobody wants."

science,fctg0ah,t1_fcspduk,1577942065.0,"> on average 25% of jews on average vote for republicans

Using Jews when discussing religion and the political consequences isn't a good idea because it's both a religion and an ethnicity, with the majority of Jews in the west not being religious.

From what I've seen of the breakdown, though, it's more religious Jews voting republican and less religious voting Democrat. If we took only the religious Jews and examined their choices it would likely be closer to the Christian % than the figure you stated.

Let's also not forget in the case of Islam you are a Muslim if your parents are (dont even get the illusion of choice baptism gives), and leaving the faith can have dire consequences, so there are a lot of people in the closet, identifying as Muslim but not actually being religious, and that will be skewing those stats. And you cant average over all other faiths including such diversity as Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam etc. Or at least you can't if you want to make a convincing argument.

> When Christians vote at nearly double the rate for republicans compared both to other religions and to non-religious people, what other conclusion is there to be made?

That people are individuals, not groups. Seriously, you replied to someone making the point that lumping all Christians together isn't a good idea, and you attempted to refute it by saying that no, Christians as a collective group do vote Republican more. Actually kinda funny how much you missed their point to double down on both bashing Christians and viewing people as a collective rather than as individuals. If you read your own bloody numbers you would see they are 55 and 50 percent, which is exactly what you would expect if Christians were NOT a monolithic group.

Also there are no percentages for Democrats or non-voters. If the other 50% of Catholics voted Democrat then what's the problem, other than people voting a way you don't like?

Anyway, what does it matter? So you can keep telling each other how bad Christians and the Republicans are? Don't see how that stops Trump getting a second term, more guarantees that he does. And it will of course be blamed on everyone but the people spewing this divisive crap, making sure the Democrats won't win anything for the foreseeable future.

science,fcte27d,t1_fct8ac7,1577940309.0,"> You think people in cities don't tend to interact with more people in general in there day to day lives?

They interact with more people, but much less serious interactions. Compare meeting 10 people and having a conversation with each of them to hoping the person sitting next to you on the tube doesn't start doing anything crazy, or avoiding eye contact, or mumbling 'thanks' to someone behind a checkout.

Cities are generally less friendly because everyone is always busy (i.e. it's not that the people are unfriendly, it's the situation makes them act less friendly) while rural areas have a slower pace, so getting to know the people in your local community happens a lot more.

Also, the chances are a lot of the people you meet in a city you will never see again, while in a small town you might see them everyday. Not only does that increase trust, but it means you can't be an asshole and have no-one find out, which you can in a big city.

I've tried big city life and it's just not for me, not sure there is an amount of money I would accept to move back to the giant overpopulated, polluted, miserable shithole which is London. Why people like living there so much I will never understand."

And one of the leading gay groups in the UK, Stonewall, wasn't for gay marriage in the late 2000's either. We even had an MP describe not being for Gay marriage as being fundamentally ""not British"" when that was their stance not 18 months earlier.

Our society is changing fast, yet our ability to forgive past actions is decreasing, so you get oddities like this, where a group like Stonewall who exist solely to benefit and support gay people aren't progressive enough, or at least they weren't before it was a progressive cause.

If you demand total purity for all time you are just setting yourself up to be disappointed, and anyone you think fits your definition of purity has skeletons in their closet you don't know about. All this is doing is removing people's chance to reform, don't be surprised when people don't apologise if they know the apology will be rejected or the action held over them anyway.

As usual people sticking up for Cuba end up with some rather convoluted metrics. The US fucked up with HIV/AIDS, Cuba fucked up with their entire country and kept most of their people in poverty (USSR kept the regime in charge with money though), but at least they were on top of the AIDS epidemic (how many Cubans could afford IV drugs? Obviously not many were openly gay. Doesn't seem like a priority for somewhere as poor as Cuba).
