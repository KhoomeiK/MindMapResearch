MurderedByWords,fgfr4fg,t1_fgfpgsn,1580745720.0,"Who told you they hate ""us""? Who told you their children ""suffer for their beliefs""? Not only are you referring to anti-vaxxing like a cult forced on children, you also think it's okay to hate them because, once again, you generalize entire groups. No, it's not okay to hate them and abuse them verbally, physically and emotionally. I agree with the other reply to my comment that they may put their children in danger, and I've never said they don't, but hating a person for doing what they think is best for their children, not out of evilness, but out of actual care, just because they have a different opinion than you is quite ignorant.

Explaining to them the true dangers of refusing to vaccinate your children is welcomed. ""Educating"" them through constant hate and abuse is, however, wrong."
MurderedByWords,fgfjukv,t3_ey3xk8,1580740708.0,"Sorry to be the circle-breaker but I have to disagree with some of what is said about anti-vaxxers. They're humans, with feelings, and generalizing **any** group of people hasn't led to any good yet. They might be mistaken - sure, but my teachers promised that no one will bite you or kill you for a wrong answer, and here you do just that. People who believe that vaccines damage your body aren't careless, the opposite, they oppose vaccines out of care in the belief that they're protecting themselves and others.

It's always easy to blame the other side of being crazy and inhuman, but have any of you even researched the components of vaccines? Because I sure as hell know at least 30% of them did.

I am not an anti-vaxxer, but I am a human being who's sick of the constant accusations and circlejerks that satanize people who think slightly different from us. Hope I've clarified a thing or two :)"

worldpolitics,fg01hle,t1_ffx76pu,1580398115.0,"Theoretically, being anti-zionist is both anti-semitic and not anti-semitic:
Anti-Zionism literally means ""I do not recognize the right of the Jewish nation for a state"", however, it can also mean ""I simply oppose the political views of 9 million Jewish people that Israel should be the Jewish state"".
However, when you actually read their views, you can very easily spot the anti-semitic comments and opinions. For instance, calling Jews ""foreskin sucking Satanists"", while the poor soul did try to say he meant that all Israelis are foreskin sucking Satanists (which makes him only racist, not anti-semitic, such an angel!) is quite impossible since Israelis and Jewish people world wide share the same traditions and beliefs and all Israelis source from world wide.

I am sure you are aware of the existence of r/Palestine, aside from the ridicolously easy-to-stop Antisemitic posts, comments and views there from **both the users and the moderators**, here are some posts about that subreddit that regard Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semism:
[A post about r/Palestine](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/e9ou7w/rpalestine_shows_why_antizionism_is_antisemitism/)

[Summary of responses of Palestinians to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/ecd9c7/antizionism_is_antisemitism_the_antizionists/)

[A Pro-Palestinian's explanation as to why Anti-Zionism isn't Anti-Semism](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/e8kio8/intelligence_squared_antizionism_is_antisemitism/)

As a last note to conclude this quite beautiful sighting, notice that r/Palestine has about 20 flairs for criticising Israel (e.g. ""Israeli Fascist Superiority"", ""Apartheid"", )  and most of their posts are about how bad is Israel, less about other stuff like ""look at this funny sign"" or ""check out what I've cooked"", r/Israel doesn't have a single flair that criticizes Palestine."

TwoXChromosomes,ffw5s8f,t3_ev7x6l,1580285636.0,"For the record, this post is very sided and doesn't show the other side of the story at all. The alleged ""rapists"" (I really don't want to call them that because there's no proof and you guys just seem to forget that) didn't have a lawyer or a translator too, it's not ""blame the victim"" and ""corrupt Cyprus police defending rapists"", it's an equal violation of rights to both sides.

The teenagers were Israeli, and the Israeli state and agenda is ""care for each Israeli and Jew everywhere in the world"", hence the public support of these teenagers although the accusation.

The mainstream opinion at Israel was:
At first - fokin rapists
Later - no proof, maybe they're innocent, still though bad decisions were made
After rumors that the woman has done the same thing in the past - she's a whore and they're the victims
Nowdays - it's complicated, they made some bad decisions but they also had their rights violated and they probably were falsely accused or partly falsely accused.

The entire situation is complicated (and honestly, it's already forgotten) and many criticize the Cyprus police and government. However, showing a one-sided view is never good practice. If you want to truly show someone's innocent, show all the sides of the story in order to let people objectively judge the situation. Accusing Israel of defending rapists and calling these teenagers rapists with no real proof are two mistakes people in the comments and you've made.

Every single time an Israeli is jailed abroad, it is a dilemma to the entire Israel society, and the solutions may vary. As an example to a more relevant situation of this type, read about [Naama Issachar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naama_Issachar_affair)."
