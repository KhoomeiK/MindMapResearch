I have never asked those questions to myself but i will sit down and try to do those, I'll try to slowly build good habits and see how that goes. Thank you so much for the advice"
getdisciplined,fe6aucp,t1_fe5oww6,1578885727.0,"That's a concept i have learned the hard way, i have wasted thousands of hours trying to do a lot of things and then simply feeling overwhelmed and giving up. I'll write a plan where I'll build habits in a small manner. Thanks for the insight!"
getdisciplined,fe6aodn,t1_fe5m8iv,1578885607.0,"It is raw to say it, it's very crude but so true.

I'll listen to the podcast, thanks for the advice!"

getdisciplined,fe6abea,t1_fe4ytom,1578885345.0,"I know asking these questions make a lot of sense but they don't change the dynamic, i know what i do wrong, i kinda know what i have to do to change that, but i can't find the discipline to do it.
It has become such an habit to not do anything that i don't know how to pass it"
