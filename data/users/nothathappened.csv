Hair roots, heavy foundation, the too dark lipstick, those ridiculous eyebrows...just, damn. It’s sad. I hope she has a friend that can tell her this isn’t working for her."
EntitledBitch,ffcffur,t1_ffccer8,1579798307.0,Right!! She’s a ho! Nothing wrong with being a ho as long as said ho doesn’t try to manipulate people into believing that they aren’t a ho-that makes them a liar. No one likes liars. She got what she deserved.

Notice he wasn’t scared when he was stepping up to someone he deemed weaker, less threatening. He didn’t care that he probably scared the older man a bit. Kid deserved to be put in his place."

AmItheAsshole,feu301o,t3_eqlbl1,1579382658.0,"NTA-of course. Your husband will hopefully come to understand that. There’s a big difference in being in the room while your daughter gives birth and being in the room while your daughter-in-law gives birth. I do believe that they had discussed it and the conversation was probably something like, “she won’t even notice I’m there if she’s pushing.” Obviously this stunt cost both of them to miss the birth. I saw that you worked it out with your MiL but I would sit with both of them. Hubby has only himself and his no to blame."
