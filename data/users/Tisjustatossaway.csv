I stopped being a Republican when W got the nomination. I didn't vote for Trump or Hillary. My vote didn't really matter, but I do feel third parties need to be seen. 

To all the people that want something different, so much that they voted for Obama, who upset them because of his business as usual attitude, they didn't vote for Hillary for that reason and they won't vote for Biden.

Ya rich people that think they achieved all of that, all on their own and need more, have a mental illness and you should not worship them. They're bad for you.

So many better products were ran over because MS paid companies to not do business with those people. Computing would be way ahead if not for Bill and MS. That is what we get with a society that rewards sociopathic behavior. 

Well we would not have a guy with  $100 Billion while families went hungry and children getting an education ranked 36th in the world.

politics,feb3zgy,t1_feazpej,1578955236.0,"Why would any person need a million to do what they passionately believe in? Bill didn't make a real difference to get rich, he was already rich enough before he even started. He was passionate. By the time he had a million, the passion was replaced by greed. 

Greed isn't inherent in human nature. It is inherent in the Western, Capitalistic, Individualistic society. No decent person needs money to do the right thing. No decent person is trying to be a billionaire. They stumble their way there by passionately pursing their dreams, but most decent people are going to know that long before they get there, they don't need more. 

Of course Bezos, what is he really worth? How many millions of shares of Amazon? Close to 80 million at $1891/share. I know he won't just go and dump them on the market, but if so, maybe the first million are worth $1891. The price would go down quick from there. What is Amazon really worth? How much of that worth did Bezos create? Maybe a share or 10's worth. 

So Amazon is estimated to be worth almost a Trillion dollars. Bezos is maybe 6% owner. Is that really worth treating most of your employees like crap for? Is that really someone we want to enable to go further? 

No, humanity would be in a better place if we encouraged people to stop being so greedy. To value people over worthless money, whose value is propped up by bombs, guns, and our mercenary military.  You can't take it with you when you die. And people might think better of you if you gave more of it away while you were alive. Gates is sure trying to buy himself out of being a horrible person. He is lucky that Balmer and Ellison sort of overshadowed him for being the biggest asshole in the industry."

The real question has to be, did they get married to someone really quickly?  Or did they date for year or two. 

I mean I'm on my second marriage, 1st lasted 15 somewhat awful years. I knew I wasn't perfect, I knew I had issues, I got therapy and everyday I strive to do better. But the main reason we are still happy after 6 years, is that we both know we aren't stuck here. That we aren't going to spend a lot of miserable years trying to make it work. When things suck, we talk about it and strive to do better. Still, I may be divorced in 5 years. Being happy and relationships working, when everything is going well, is almost child's play. When financially struggling, dealing with mental illness or depression, job loss, or death in the family that is the strain that makes relationships feel like real work."
politics,feagckq,t1_feaeiew,1578948391.0,"Sure thing. Of course, we once did a heck of a lot more taxing, and had less gambling on the markets. Maybe coincidence. Taxing has become complex, because it seems everyone with money paid for exceptions for themselves. I think we can get a lot more honest tax revising than what Trump has done. A simple progressive tax plan, up to 93%, would produce a lot of good in many ways. 

An obvious one, if you can't fatten your wallet a lot with that 21st million, why not reinvest it into the long term future of your company? Then maybe you would not have companies slashing their R&D, and making flimsier versions of their product, to spend more on marketing and executive bonuses.

I feel strongly that walking out into an uncertain environment where there may be 1-4, potentially armed, intruders, because you think that is somehow safer than laying low for a few minutes, isn't very bright. Maybe you have cameras. Maybe you know how many, how armed and where they are.  Most of them will bolt if they hear you, but not all. But I would convict you of murder, if I was on a jury and you hunted down unarmed burglars, in your home, took them by surprise and murdered them. 


Defending yourself, in my opinion, doesn't happen as they run away from you. That is premeditated murder and if you feel death is a fine punishment for burglary, I think I'd like to see people with this belief hang for taking another person's life in cold blood. 

You are right, actions have consequences and murdering people even if you are dumb enough to think you have the right to, should have consequences, too. Now, most likely this situation won't ever happen to anyone on this thread. They may come back to a burgled house, though.

The difference she has made is massively positive,  what kind of person would focus on the perceived negativity of it?

I mean to each their own and their own line. Just as they get to decide for themselves, I get to decide how I feel about their decision. 

Why would some jerk claim my feelings about how inappropriate their behavior is, isn't warranted? 

Still, disowning a kid, isn't about saving yourself, it is largely and almost exclusively a tactic of awful people trying to control their kids behavior, even when it has 0 affect upon them."

pcmasterrace,fd6hnni,t1_fd5kif2,1578191166.0,"Ya and somehow I lived many decades with no need for Windows or that Store. So much crap in Windows 10 and it is as bad as the rest of Microsoft's stuff with the updates. Oh they updated a few files, forget differentials or patching, let's make it a new install. There goes my data cap for this month. 

The new Photo app takes an eternity to load and is useless. I swear they made a bunch of half functional apps to replace slightly ok ones, just to make the Store have a use. Your other comment caused me terrors from remembering that flaming pile of crap that is Movies and TV. Wait 4 lifetimes for it launch or download VLC on ADSL... VLC is faster. 

 And I have to upgrade just to be able to reset an account's password. 

I just run Linux w/ a bunch of virtual machines on it, and it works so much better than Windows ever has."

He was missing for 16 hours. We didn't realize he had left so early until I checked the cameras. I found in him down in a deep and steep ravine. I thought he was dead, I really don't know how he could get down there without breaking his neck, but when I came up on him, he weakly lifted his head. With great difficulty, I hauled him out. Half way up the hill to the house, I set in down, he turned and tried to head back down to the ravine. I think I stole his chance to go die away from us. A week later he lay, breathing with great labor. I took him to the vet and he didn't come home. I am certain he knew. I don't know why he would want to die on his own, but I am pretty sure that was his desire. Anecdotal for sure, but with cats this was common."
