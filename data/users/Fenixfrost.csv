My go to dinner is arepas (they're essentially Hispanic fried sandwiches, but you can oven bake them too for a healthier option), you can get a bag of the mix for like a few bucks, a bag of the mix makes about 20+ arepas.  Add some butter then other kind of sandwich meat you like to it and it averages to be less than a dollar per meal.  Always my go to cheap dinner and EXTREMELY tasty to boot.  Two arepas is a pretty full meal.  If you ever decide to try it, try it with some pastrami...of all things...tried it this week and it is out of this world delicious.

My go to lunch I cook a turkey vegetable egg noodle soup, but I **despise** the texture of vegetables so I use a blender to blend the vegetables into the soup (it's insanely delicious).  Cost around $20.00 to make a gloriously massive pot, it creates \~25 bowls of soup.  I put most in the freezer, bring 5 bowls to work a week.  $20.00 for an entire month of lunch meals covered at work, saves me a LOT of money.

Also I was given an air fryer for Christmas recently, I'm getting a good amount of value just throwing cheap frozen foods in like chicken wings, fish, cheesesticks in there and getting meals for the cheap.  One bag of frozen wings last me like...3-4 meals, easy to cook, cheap, healthier.  Win win win.

Further inspection shows you created this profile just to make this post.  Now why would you do that, would your post history reveal you're possibly anti-LGBT comments?  I mean, why would someone create an account JUST to post here if they did in fact feel as though they were NOT the asshole...?  Just way too many inconsistencies here.
