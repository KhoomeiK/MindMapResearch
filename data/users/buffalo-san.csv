college,ffazfa7,t3_eslihf,1579748048.0,Sounds less like a problem with freshmen and more like jealousy of people who're enjoying life. News flash: adults giggle and talk to each other too
ProRevenge,ff5ayvu,t3_erkemp,1579585694.0,"You had me until the ""recording bear"" stuff, topped off by how rare it is for someone to have down syndrome and MS. Not cool to make up stories like this, not cool at all."

uglyduckling,fe6jil6,t1_fe5pik3,1578892932.0,"Step number one was exercise. I never played any sports outside of elementary school and was severely out of shape. I hired a personal trainer for a couple weeks who showed me how to properly lift weights and also forced me to get up and go because I didn't want to waste his time. After about a month people who didn't know I had been working out started making comments about how much better I was looking.

Step number two was starting to socialize. I had a core group of a couple friends from middle school who I was really close with, but as the years went on our lives went in different directions and we couldn't see each other nearly as much. To make things worse they didn't go to my high school so I basically isolated myself, especially sophomore-senior year. College started and with the mood boost I had from working out I decided I'd start faking confidence until it became real. Suffice to say that despite having a 40 minute commute to campus and living alone in apartment the amount of friends I have pretty much quadrupled in my first semester of college and now I actually feel uncomfortable being alone for extended periods of time.

Quitting/severely cutting back on gaming was a huge part of it too, I think. It was an easy way to escape reality and I feel sad about all the years of my childhood I wasted playing games. I used to be a pretty big MMO nerd, and while my interactions with people in them definitely helped me grow I think it was a huge detriment to my personal development overall. Nowadays I just don't have time to play games, I'm almost never at my apartment and it's just not really fun to me anymore sans the occasional Minecraft sesh with old friends who live far away.

I know what I'm saying is all easier said than done but I promise you that all you have to do is start and form good habits to make a real difference. I know how hard starting is, it took me more than five years to work up the willpower to do so. Don't feel bad when change doesn't come in a week or a month, you have to keep at it and I promise if you do you'll see results."
socialskills,fdu88o1,t3_emyae5,1578729295.0,Imo it's when A. you hang out with them on a regular basis (or did at some point in your life in the case of old friends) and B. when you're comfortable being yourself without (practically) any limitations around them
