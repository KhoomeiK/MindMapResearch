PenmanshipPorn,fer3obj,t3_eqbiw6,1579349427.0,This made me laugh way harder than I should have.
facepalm,femn31h,t1_femh7xj,1579263275.0,"Thanks! And to be fair my first comment was pretty vague on my thinking there, so I totally see how that comment could look like ""Just give this psycho free reign to torment victims!"""
facepalm,femh3i8,t1_femg9rc,1579255197.0,"Obviously not given free reign or power and heavily supervised, but actually being exposed to these people and situations can help build empathy and understanding. Most people are ignorant, they're not willfully hateful. Especially considering this is a 15 yr old that is probably just spouting the same bullshit hes heard from others, then yeah, I do think it can be extremely beneficial. Do you really think keeping him away from those experiences or people who have been through it will help create empathy? It's going to further isolate him in his beliefs.

Edit: let's be real, this kid isnt ""pro-rape"" but hes probably heard it tossed around incel forums and that's why hes repeating it. He doesnt know what it's like to rape someone violently and if he does hes far too young to have enough of those experiences to cement that stance. The best thing you can do for that type of person is expose them to reality to give them a more balanced perspective"

DoctorStrange,fels4vo,t3_ephhqq,1579229585.0,Why is she not wearing pants?
doctorwho,fe6wl14,t1_fe6v4yd,1578906621.0,"Stubborn, very family and community centered, smart and tactical when it comes to issues with the doctor, she's just held back by the fact that everything is alien. She wants to be strong to care for others but doesn't feel 100% confident in her abilities, both as a companion and as a police officer as she's young and still learning. Despite that, she is an excellent investigator and takes initiative. She's not scared off by alien things but also doesn't have the same childlike wonder as other companions. She tries to look at it logically but still has a bit of childish delight which gets drawn out by the doctor. Yaz wants to be the grown up in the room, the one in control, who is dependable and can defend her friends, family, and community, which is why she tries to put on a bit of a serious face at times. This obviously comes from a place of compassion as she cares about everyone around her, asking if they're okay, checking in with people, etc. Her relationship with Ryan is interesting because she does care about him, as she has a big heart, but because she tries so hard to keep her shit together, she gets frustrated that Ryan totally does not. Ryan barely has any of his shit together and it frustrates Yaz, but as an ""older sister"" type she will of course help him do up his jacket and tie up his shoes, but call him an idiot the whole way. 

You do love DW, right? Because a lot of people seem to watch the show through a veil of hate, and it keeps you from seeing what's right in front of you."
doctorwho,fe6uei7,t3_entlsn,1578905446.0,Yaz and Ryan are great. Y'all just salty about change.
onguardforthee,fe6srfb,t1_fe6s76j,1578903668.0,"Yeah... I live in Calgary and it's about as conservative as you can get. Yet it's when I visited Vancouver when I actually heard people voicing pro-Trump opinions and really racist remarks in public. I was a little flabbergasted tbh. Not that we dont get that here, but you see it more in the form of Soldiers of Odin and other organizations."

 I take mine to work every day and everyone loves them. Almost everyone I work with notices them and wants to try them out. I normally just say they're expensive, but one guy was really interested in the pens and wanted to know the price so I told him how much my TWSBI Eco cost (my most expensive pen aside from my Lamy Al Star), and it totally scared him off. I told him that was nothing and what some of the more next level or grail pens were worth lol"
fountainpens,fdx8lxy,t1_fdwwptb,1578766370.0,Go for it! Those pens and inks are too beautiful to stay hidden away. :)
fountainpens,fdwvmj7,t1_fdwr8un,1578762776.0,"u/FirekeeperAnnwyl is correct, they used it feed up. And totally on the money, feed up is not a bad thing if you know what you’re doing. I’m still learning about FPs and I’ve experimented with feed up writing, but I can totally see how a noobie combining a wrong angle with too much force could end up bending a nib. 

I wouldn’t worry too much about taking your pens to school, but it may depend on how respectful the people at your school are. You may introduce people to a new hobby! Just keep a close eye on your your pens at school and supervise anyone borrowing one, and you should be fine. ;)

I now realize I wrote “pen” upside down instead of “nib.” No wonder there was confusion lol"
fountainpens,fdw9fpv,t3_en5870,1578756408.0,"I have not had an issue with letting people use my pens so far. Though most people I know are pretty respectful, and they're usually okay with me giving some info on it, since they're already interested. The only issue I had was when someone tried to write with my pen upside down. I managed to stop them though."
