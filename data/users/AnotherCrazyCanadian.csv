abbotsford,ffec6uc,t1_ffeazgf,1579842792.0,"Very good, glad to hear you guys are gonna get to stick it to em soon!"
vancouver,ffczjpt,t1_ffcyl6b,1579810481.0,That's where it came from.
Edmonton,ffcsl4l,t1_ffclzq7,1579806404.0,"Well I mean the machines do cost them to operate, so I get why they do."
Edmonton,ffa1hln,t1_ff9u8t6,1579725988.0,"Nobody cares to learn about their backstory, and that's EVERYTHING when it comes to homelessness. Too many people (myself previously) assume it's laziness and ""I worked hard to get here, they didn't so they deserve it"" completely unaware of the 100's of factors that were out of their control and puts them at a great disadvantage."
Edmonton,ffa16dt,t1_ff9wked,1579725807.0,"You're missing the point. There's obviously going to be freeloaders because humans are lazy by nature. But where I was wrong is thinking that 95% of them live like that. Yes, plenty do, and those people will just as soon as rob people instead of work for a living, but so, so many have just fallen on hard times and need a hand to recover.  Taking away the compassion and support so many people need to break the cycle doesn't fix homelessness like people imagine, it just pushes them further to the brink. If the world treats you like filth, I guarantee you you're going to live to spite the world instead of trying to integrate into it again. Don't let the bad apples spoil the bunch."
Edmonton,ff9i017,t1_ff98m20,1579713434.0,"I used to think all homeless were just freeloading bums, and if you take away the soup kitchens and drug sites they'll be forced to get better. That couldn't have been farther from the truth and I'm so glad people have taught me what's really going on and why they need the help.

Edit: For those of you that hold your stance regardless, go volunteer for a soup kitchen for a day and learn about them. Go try to bitch about all of them when you get back and see if you still carry the same tune."
abbotsford,ff9dnta,t1_ff7wuzc,1579710736.0,"That's a bummer, but I'm not surprised. The moment taxis lose their monopoly, that's the moment they'll never have it back so they're doing all they can to stop it, like they have everywhere else. Is there an ETA on when uber will be available?"
abbotsford,ff7sx8q,t3_erxisp,1579657579.0,What about catching the west coast express then catching a bus from mission?
abbotsford,ff7susa,t1_ff6lcb7,1579657531.0,"Wait, you guys don't have uber?"
YouShouldKnow,ff4bn7y,t3_ere17n,1579559826.0,There's ads at gas stations?
holdmyfeedingtube,ff3xolq,t1_ff3wsfi,1579551119.0,"I figured he would have been, but the interviews I saw ( a long time ago) I thought he was asked and he said something like there's nothing major. I'm probably thinking of Steve-O,'s interviews."
holdmyfeedingtube,ff2jnyz,t1_ff2jds5,1579509173.0,"Oof, for real? I didn't know he was in constant pain like that in the interviews I saw."

personalfinance,feltrs6,t1_fele1cs,1579230736.0,I'm just trying to give a ballpark on what I think is a reasonable amount to spend. I learn better when I see numbers.
vancouver,fekf7wa,t3_epkld1,1579198792.0,"Edmontonian here,  completely agree with this. Too many idiots thinking we'll get the 80's back and global warming ain't shit."
personalfinance,feiyt23,t1_feiuubg,1579151050.0,"Ooof, eating out is one of the biggest expenses out there. I only ever do it with coupons and even then I make sure it's under $7 a meal."
Latexadvice,fefrpp1,t1_feff7o7,1579063241.0,"Exactly that, you can make a circular incision but you'll want to put a ring of rubber around and inside that incision."
trees,fecpq1t,t1_febw8bo,1578980198.0,"You should know that a form of latex is called chlorinated latex, a simple modification that I believe is known to destroy/cover 91% of the proteins, which in those proteins are the ones most people react too."
vancouver,feazb2i,t3_eobagf,1578953811.0,I myself took a bus down to Seattle last summer and loved the experience. It's easy enough to get around via bus and you don't have to deal with traffic. Though it was pretty packed on the bus.
hmmm,fdxiqrs,t1_fdx8434,1578769103.0,"I've been in places where I've seen these in public, and kids have absolutely zero care about them. Everyone worries waaaaay too much about fetishes in public, and by extension sex. It's not supposed to ever have been something that's shamed and people need to grow up and stop behaving like children."

vancouver,fdwzkn3,t3_en39xq,1578763795.0,"Every single one of the 20 survivors of the golden gate bridge have gone on the record to say the moment they went over, they let go of the bar, they felt nothing but pure regret. I'm very glad to see you aren't one of them and you're getting the help you need!"

YouShouldKnow,fdwulaz,t1_fdum3th,1578762436.0,"It's definitely the most powerful medicine I've tried. You might also want to look into lions mane mushroom caps, they've been well known to boost mood, energy, and cognition, and they've absolutely done what they've promised for me!"
Petioles,fdwohbz,t3_en8s8w,1578760857.0,"It definitely does for me. I notice that my words slur and my attention span is reduced as is my ability to focus. Smoking vs vaping definitely increases these side effects, so I only vape every other night if I'm working the next day."
MMJ,fdwn0kb,t3_en92h1,1578760322.0,"If it's the same as GSC, then I absolutely recommend it wholeheartedly. Girl scout cookies was my first medical strain, helped me out so much with anxiety and related symptoms."
YouShouldKnow,fdqwhc6,t3_emqvvk,1578675844.0,"Have you considered taking a small dose of psilocybin? It's been well documented to outright cure depression in so many folk, and it's helped me out tremendously as well."

Latexadvice,fdkexfu,t1_fdk7xx4,1578502425.0,They have a secondary site with a bunch of sales constantly on called latex Express I believe
MMJ,fdif0dc,t1_fdi850r,1578441412.0,"Lol, yes he is. Weeds been the love drug for decades."
IWantToLearn,fdh91rm,t1_fdgzoki,1578418015.0,"I feel dreams are more like an exaggeration of specific fears and emotions rather than actually ever feeling like real life. There's no combating the issues in dreams and it doesn't make sense, but the part of your brain that is responsible for that is shut off."
Petioles,fdh8o0h,t1_fdh7hx4,1578417783.0,"I believe with CBD for it to actually be as effective as people say, you'd have to consume so much that you could never afford to do it. I find it does help quell my anxiety a bit but it's only like putting a lid on a boiling pot instead of turning down the heat."
vancouver,fdg3lkc,t1_fdfwzlj,1578378725.0,"So I've heard. I personally really enjoy the rain but I haven't had long spells without the sun, so it'll be interesting to see what it's like out there. I've been planning to go in winter for a week so I can see how my expectations match, plus flights are only like $100."
vancouver,fdf0hpk,t1_fde4k7h,1578350543.0,"Ah, gotcha. I'm not a local (Edmonton) but I get the lack of sun. Sorry to hear of your blues."
AskReddit,fdf0dvh,t3_ekt5n3,1578350477.0,Alright.....keep going....

Psychonaut,fdb31u1,t1_fdau5u2,1578253210.0,The general consensus on aqueducts in cities is not positive as they tend to be terrible eyesores. Seattle's been saying that for decades and people are glad they got rid of theirs. They helped increase the longevity and access to business and parks in SF to this very day.
Psychonaut,fda5377,t3_ekeicl,1578241798.0,What are you doing to make a change? Don't tell the people to rise up if you're not willing to act yourself.
Psychonaut,fda4zm0,t1_fda4q2t,1578241752.0,They did quite a bit actually. One of the less known examples was preventing the building of major highways through San Francisco.

Petioles,fd4rtsa,t3_ejxlzd,1578170471.0,I find the first 3-4 days is when I crave it (usually out of boredom) but after that I tend to forget. I only toke once a day and not every day either though.

vancouver,fcxtgkk,t3_ejenh0,1578070193.0,I'm hoping to make it out there because I love the rain and how fresh it makes things. 4 months might be too much but compared to smelly winter car exhaust snowscapes here I'm sure I can do it

Latexadvice,fcwg42b,t3_ej8t3j,1578024734.0,Absolutely go right to a catsuit instead of something small like underwear. Everyone I've met who's tried small stuff is usually missing the full experience. Latex catfish is good for cheap starter stuff so you can get experience with it.
WorkOnline,fcw0rfo,t1_fcvj5rj,1578014488.0,What exactly do you do on there?
personalfinance,fcv95ok,t1_fcv8ovb,1577997238.0,You can make it. When you do you'll be glad you did. That first interview feels great.

Petioles,fcinggq,t3_egwmxw,1577665518.0,"I definitely work on the reward system, but I also remind myself that less now will give me a better buzz later, reducing tolerance buildup. None before nine, not every night."
MMJ,fc7sn5y,t3_egn97k,1577517611.0,"Hey buddy, sorry if it's not specific to you guys, but in canada there's mail order services for stuff online. Not technically legal here but easy and consistent enough to get ahold of"
