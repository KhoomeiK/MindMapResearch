The WHO recently barred Taiwan, one of the nations that has confirmed coronavirus cases, from it's meeting due to pressure from China. The Red Cross regular siphons more than half of its donations to enrich themselves. The United Nation's screw-ups are too many to list, and I don't think anybody need any convincing that it is a corrupt and feckless organization. What sort of organization are you going to set up that would be immune to political machinations and corruption?

Firearms,ffcjjfs,t1_ffcbrp7,1579800811.0,"That's because ""conservative"" is an overly broad category and does not represent the voting blocks in US politics. Traditionally, the Republican voting block has consisted of Evangelical Christians, Pro-lifers, pro-military people, gun rights people and big business people. These are the people we typically consider ""conservative"". On the other hand, the Democrats had a coalition of the black community, the gay community, women, unions, environmentalists, under-30s and socialists. The Catholics and Hispanics, as socially conservative but economically liberal groups, are the swing voters in between (this is a gross simplification, but it approximates the picture enough for our purposes). The Democrats have a bigger coalition, but the Republican coalition is more cohesive. While working mothers don't like paying for college loans, and black Americans aren't all LGBT allies, pro-lifers aren't interested in defunding the marine corps, and the big business people don't really care about guns. When the democrats can field a charismatic candidate like Obama or Bill Clinton that can smooth over the differences, they win, otherwise the Republicans take the pot. 

In the past election, the US political system went offline. Pro-lifers hate Trump for being a card-carrying democrat who donated to pro-choice organizations; national security people hate him because he's insulting military families; pro-gunners like us are in the air, between disillusionment and Trump's bump stock ban; but unions like Trump for his protectionist policies and he managed to drum up a new faction of populists. On the other hand, the gay community is fracturing after achieving their major goal of legalized gay marriage, the black community isn't showing up at the polls for a selection of rich, old, white candidates, and although the Hispanics hate Trump, the ones that are legal and can vote aren't as down on him as the pollsters make him seen. The millennial vote, previously firmly Democrat due to their young age and far left economic policy, is swinging towards populist as they grow older and bitter from economic disillusionment, and the Democratic establishment reject Bernie Sanders. 

This chaos is healthy. The world is changing and the political system must change with it. For the gun community the important thing is to capture the widest acceptance among both groups so that gun rights become a bipartisan issue. It is far more advantageous for us to be sitting in the centre where politicians need to prove themselves to us with legislation, rather than betting our horse on one side who can use us as a vote bank."

anime,ff7eksq,t1_ff6rpvp,1579647742.0,"In my mind, this is how I've always pictured it: in the last episode the guys who were doing the investigation after the war ending up finding out that Tanya is still alive. They travel a homestead in the Middle of Nowhere, Midwestern USA. Are you sure this is where she is? That's what the source says. The place looks lived in, but it's all quiet. They knock, no answer. They walk inside the door. Suddenly a farmhand in a wide hat appears behind them, pointing a shotgun into the back.

""Need something, gentlemen?"" 

The shotgun was Mary Sue's. The person under the hat brim is no other than Tanya herself. They talk tensely for a bit. Tanya von Degurechaff? Never heard've'em, sir. But then Victoriya appears carrying pails of milk and asks,

""Major, what's wrong?"" 

Tanya sighs, ""stop calling me that, we're not in the imperial army anymore.""

Next scene, they're inside the farm house. It is cozy, small but well-kept. Tanya is at the table opposite to two reporter, really enjoying her coffee with fresh milk. Victoriya is in the background busying with the kettle and cookies. Tanya starts reminiscing. It's the last battle. The Empire was being overwhelmed on all sides by the Allied counterattack. It's the Hundred Day Campaign. Mary Sue and Tanya were duking it out in another abandoned church on the Rhine with maximum animation budget. She's holding the line to let her battalion retreat. Victoriya was supposed to lead them. It was a hard fight. Mary Sue has been pumped full of Being X's powers. Tanya gets pummeled so badly her submachine gun breaks into two from a bare hand punch by Mary. The initials carved into the stock flashes before her eyes as a splinter. Mary pauses, her humanity temporarily overtaking holy fervor. Suddenly she is thrown sideways into the altar. It's Victoriya, she's back to save her major. She wrestles with Mary, the fight is getting uglier. Tanya stands up calmly. She grabs Mary's discarded shotgun. The Type 95 necklace glows, but she rips it off and channels a simple magic spell instead. It hits Mary square in the chest when she is sitting over Victoriya ready to kill her. Mary's necklace break, the crazy leaves her eyes as the jewel shatters. She faints on top of Victoriya. 

Back in the farmhouse, the reporters are stunned. They were so enraptured they couldn't write anything down. A few exchanged quips about the fate of the empire and how Tanya never wanted power, just to survive. The reporters leave. 

Tanya sinks deep into her coffee as Victoriya munches happily on the cookies, sitting opposite to her. There was more to that tale. When Mary collapsed, time had stopped like it had so many times before. Tanya racks the shotgun and spins around, ready to shoot the first thing that moves, but Being X had inhabited Victoriya this time. He congratulated her. Despite his best efforts, Tanya remains firmly unkillable. He admits defeat, wants to send Tanya back to her previous life. She briefly sees her old body in a coma. The bed side is empty. She sees another image. It's her battalion, they're all flying back towards her. They know they were ordered to retreat, but they're not leaving their beloved officer behind. She asks Being X what will happen to her battalion after; it's not pretty. Neither are things great for Mary. The scene fades to black. 

She's back in the farmhouse. There's a knock on the door. It's Weiss. He's inviting the Degurechaffs to a party, a weekend gathering with all the old squad, whom Tanya had managed to save by hijacking a plane and fleeing to the Midwest. Her organization skills got them fake identities in a faraway village after the war. They live happily. Mary's at the party too. She's forgiven Tanya. Tanya picks up a rustic beer mug. They drink to old times.

Geopolitically this is an back-assward exercise, especially for the country whose traditional role in Europe is as the Franco-Prussian Army Highway. 

Those nukes did nothing. If Belgium didn't talk about it most people would barely remember. By removing them they're explicitly  denying the protection of the largest, best equipped army with the most force projection in the world, in favour of signalling friendship to the EU, an institution whose allied army is only now being proposed, and an institution whose good graces the Belgians are already in by hosting the European parliament.

The PRC tried to invade ROC held islands, including Kinmen, since 1949. Kinmen was the turning point of the Chinese civil war that ensured that the KMT would survive on Taiwan. Their strategic objective has not changed in 70 years. 

> but now we're seeing the ramp up in production of aircraft carriers and other technologies that are explicitly for force projection

The aircraft carriers are a joke. The one they bought from Ukraine is an 80's era *Kuznetsov* class carrier. They're gas turbine powered and carry about a quarter the number of planes on the US *Nimitz* class carriers. And lo and behold when they built their own carrier they built another *Kuznetsov*. Even if they built another 20 they wouldn't be able to invade the US mainland, and if they were thinking of invading the First Island Chain, they wouldn't need aircraft carriers since each island is already an unsinkable aircraft carrier. The aircraft carriers are white elephants. 

>Or alternatively, maybe they DO have a contingency where they just shellack the entire island with PLARF until they're sure there's no resistance.

Short of going nuclear there isn't enough metal in China to build enough missiles to deliver the amount of payload needed to ensure zero resistance. If they went nuclear then they should expect to be surrounded by nukes on every side, as Japan, Korea, the Philippines and Vietnam take that as signals to up their own deterrence, not to mention the world might end if the US responds with their own nukes. 

The invasion of Taiwan is simply a logistics issue that the PLA is not equipped to deal with, and won't be equipped to deal with for another decade or so. That is a long time to spend building up your forces, especially when your economy is reliant on your biggest enemy keeping your trade lanes open. Military professionals talk logistics while military gawkers don't, which is why the general population is so scared of China when the actual planners aren't."
worldnews,ff3iwsa,t1_ff3gchx,1579542011.0,"Uh-huh. At Normandy the allies dropped two divisions of paratroopers behind enemy lines. At that time, Allied air command had 1200+ C-47 troop transports, and would send 3-400 planes at a time to transport a regiment. They also sent about 4000 in gliders. These paratroopers suffered about 50% casualties, out of which more than half were ""missing"", which almost certainly meant they were taken out of action before they could group up on the LZ. Keeping in mind that the Allies had had air, naval and informational superiority over the area for about two years before they landed, and the paratroopers were proceeded by an amphibious landing at the same time so most German troops were otherwise occupied. The area around Normandy was also mostly countryside, with friendly populations inhabiting it, filled with resistance members who were activated en masse during the invasion. 

In comparison, the PLAAF has 149 transports of all sizes on hand. They can carry about 10 times as many troops, but are just about as vulnerable to anti-air elements as their predecessors. Keeping in mind that even .50 cal machine guns can make things difficult for transport planes, the PLA has less than two weeks to achieve air superiority. They will also be parachuting into an island that is almost entirely jungle or urban jungle, full of hostile civilians who are unlikely to help them if they end up off course. If they don't launch a simultaneous invasion of Normandy scale, they will be faced with the entire Taiwanese reserve of several million men. They must also be supplied constantly with ammunition by air, until they can secure a port. If they lose air or naval superiority at any time they'll run out of ammunition in about 45 minutes.
