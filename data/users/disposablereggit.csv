I've heard about how supermodels are some of the most insecure people on the planet. I know it feels like everyone but you has it figured out, but we're all just bumbling around in the dark. 

I don't know much about relationships, but what I do feel pretty confident about is that people are attracted to health more than anything else. If you eat well and exercise yada yada I think you get a kind of glow about you that attracts people.  The same goes for mental health. 

I was talking to two girls the other night, and one of them just asked me, ""are you happy?"" And it was kind of a shocking question to me, and honestly it kind of bothers me. But she could tell I wasn't a happy person, and it's kind of hard to see yourself happy with someone who isn't. 

So you're good, man. Just take deep breaths. Do what you can for your mental and physical health and know you're not alone. That's all I can say."

I'm just thinking, it's one thing to say ""ok, there's 500 billion WOW currencies, and currently 100 WOW currency sells for one US dollar, so that means all of the WOW currency is worth 5 billion dollars.""

But really because of the nature of videogame, where games are replaced every year with new technology and players lose interest, currency it's not going to hold its value the same way something tangible would.

So over the lifespan of WOW there's not going to be that much money in transaction happening.
