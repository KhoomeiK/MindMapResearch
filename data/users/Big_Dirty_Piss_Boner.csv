Maybe the names. For some reasons Americans always mess up Sweden and Switzerland."

Nope. Americans live in their own bubble. They get an extremely tiny bit of intercontinental news. You could watch a news channel for hours and forget that the rest of the world exists."

Europe is bigger than the US though?!"
dashcamgifs,fgti2pp,t1_fgtfsgy,1581104776.0,"Yeah we have that too. Less than 60cm overall length is a pistol. 

But there are no legal implications that come with that. We have no „short barreled rifles“. So there is no reason to pretend that a 7"" barrel AR15 is a ""pistol"" and that the stock is actually just a ""brace"". 

As long as pistol and rifle are both semi auto they fall into the same category and the same rules apply."

Some dialects in Austria use „Grundbirne“, literally ""ground pear"". With thick dialect its pronounced „Grumpan“."

Firearms,fgsz7sy,t1_fgsf1w0,1581095725.0,I don‘t get this at all. You don‘t even need a firearms license in many EU countries. Any 18 year old could walk into a gun shop in Austria and buy a rifle or shotgun.
dashcamgifs,fgsydwk,t1_fgsxlu9,1581095223.0,"Smaller bullet diameter doesn‘t mean that the cartridge can‘t be more powerful. The .308 cartridge is shouldered and 51mm long with a case diameter of 12mm. The .380 is 17mm long with a case diameter of 9.5mm. 

.308 (Win) is a rifle cartridge. Its much more powerful than .380 (ACP). The .308 has roughly 15 times more energy. 

Thats why the American naming system is seriously flawed."
dashcamgifs,fgswyjm,t1_fgsu93h,1581094378.0,So a rifle thats called pistol because of strange American laws? :D

AskReddit,fgovews,t1_fgou1p4,1580988387.0,"I‘d be interested what kind of tests they use. A test that detects methamphetamin but not amphetamine?

There are tests that only react to secondary or primary amines but who needs a test like that? That would only make sense if you explicitly wanted to test for meth/mdma/methylone."

There is no hard evidence, but people naturally don't trust China. 

China just really likes to lie to look better. For example, they claim 60 deaths per year by influenza. The USA has 12,000 – 61,000 per year."
