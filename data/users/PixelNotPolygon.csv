If you want SF to have a chance of being represented in the leaders debate for the big parties you better vote for them and convince all your friends and family to vote for them."

ireland,fewyndy,t1_fevuan3,1579421505.0,"What I don't understand about PRSTV is when you hear news reports that a particular candidate has got enough votes to win a seat and that the rest of his/her votes will be transferred, how does that transfer happen? Is it literally all the remaining uncounted votes that that person got which gets transferred? In which case how is that representative of all the 2nd choice transfers available out of everyone who voted for that candidate? For example, if counting is taking place then it is probably is done by ballot box, so what's likely to happen is that transfers from that candidate will be skewed towards a particular polling station of uncounted ballots. Let's say an FG candidate won and the make-up of that candidate's total transfers is 80% FF 20% LAB, but the FG candidate wins without the votes from the fifth and final polling station being counted and the transfer proportion of that final polling station among everyone who voted for this FG candidate is 60% FF and 40% LAB - how is it fair that the transfers from that FG candidate reflect that final polling station and not the totality of everyone who voted for that FG candidate?"
