Also, don't you think this timing is a little odd, to say the least. A conversation that took place 1 year ago and 3 weeks before the caucasus, when Warren is slipping in the polls, this comes out? I call bullshit. Someone said something above about Sanders supporters weaponizing this... Warren's campaign weaponized this. Just a few days ago I told a bunch of folks that Warren was my 2nd choice and that I'd happily vote for her in the General. Now... yeah, I'll still vote for her, but only because she's not Trump.

Oil. The Iranians wanted to nationalize their oil production, AS THEY SHOULD because those resources belong to the Iranian people, not U.S. and U.K. oil businesses.
