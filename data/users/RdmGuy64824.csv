Assistance,fffdfvm,t3_esd8vd,1579881530.0,"I lost my fiancee 6.5 years ago, and also posted on reddit a little while later.  We didn't have children, but were less than a week out from getting married, so it was a proper kick to the ass.

A few tips I discovered going through the loss:

* After the dust settles, start writing to her.  Our brains become intertwined and reliant on each other.  You will have a backlog of shit you want to tell her about.  So write to her and let her know your thoughts, updates on things you have gone through, whatever has happened since, etc.  This is a recommended technique for dealing with grief.  I'm sure it would help your children as well.  I found it to be extremely beneficial.  It's basically tricking your brain into having some closure.

* Check out a local grief support group.  I attended one for several weeks, and I weirdly found solace in hearing other people's stories.  Especially people who were in worse situations, it made me realize that my situation could have been worse, and that made me feel a little less bad.

* Consider a therapist.  A therapist can be a great tool, as they basically just give recommendations on things you may have already considered.  They are able to isolate good ideas from the noise in your head, and can help you maintain focus.

* Figure out how to control your thoughts if you haven't already.  Learning the basics of meditation can be really powerful at controlling the flow of shit running through your mind.

* Maintain whatever hobbies or interests you had previously.  You have kids, so no idea how much free time you have, but starting a new project or something can help keep your mind busy.

* Don't be afraid to move on when you are ready.  We are both lucky in the sense that our losses were partners (we didn't lose a child, thankfully).  The final step in me healing was starting to date.  It's amazing how much even talking to someone on the phone can help.  All of those connections in your brain that were wired with your partner can be rewired.  Dating gets you motivated to start living again, as it really motivates you to get/stay in shape and take care of yourself.

Grief comes in waves, at the very beginning the waves are so high you won't be sure that you can make it over. Over time the waves will become smaller and smaller, and things will become more manageable.  Eventually the waves will be so small that they will serve as little reminders, and you may even appreciate them.

Once you make it through this you will have a new perspective on life, and will gain experience on how to deal with grief and hard situations."

> Criticism from some scientists centered on the fact that while publications often appeared in the popular press about Koko, scientific publications with substantial data were fewer in number.[41][42][43] Other researchers argued that Koko did not understand the meaning behind what she was doing and learned to complete the signs simply because the researchers rewarded her for doing so (indicating that her actions were the product of operant conditioning).[44][45] Another concern that has been raised about Koko's ability to express coherent thoughts through signs is that interpretation of the gorilla's conversation was left to the handler, who may have seen improbable concatenations of signs as meaningful. For example, when Koko signed ""sad"" there was no way to tell whether she meant it with the connotation of ""How sad"". Following Patterson's initial publications in 1978, a series of critical evaluations of her reports of signing behavior in great apes argued that video evidence suggested that Koko was simply being prompted by her trainers' unconscious cues to display specific signs, in what is commonly called the Clever Hans effect.[46][47][48][49][39][50]

> Criticism from some scientists centered on the fact that while publications often appeared in the popular press about Koko, scientific publications with substantial data were fewer in number.[41][42][43] Other researchers argued that Koko did not understand the meaning behind what she was doing and learned to complete the signs simply because the researchers rewarded her for doing so (indicating that her actions were the product of operant conditioning).[44][45] Another concern that has been raised about Koko's ability to express coherent thoughts through signs is that interpretation of the gorilla's conversation was left to the handler, who may have seen improbable concatenations of signs as meaningful. For example, when Koko signed ""sad"" there was no way to tell whether she meant it with the connotation of ""How sad"". Following Patterson's initial publications in 1978, a series of critical evaluations of her reports of signing behavior in great apes argued that video evidence suggested that Koko was simply being prompted by her trainers' unconscious cues to display specific signs, in what is commonly called the Clever Hans effect.[46][47][48][49][39][50]
