I did Belisarius the Last Roman:

Have you ever heard the tragedy of Belisarius the Last Roman? I thought not. It’s not a story your teacher would tell you. It’s a Roman Story. Belisarius was the main general of Emperor Justinian I, so great a general that he reconquered Italy, North Africa, Illyricum, and some of Iberia for the Empire. His display of Roman values during Antiquity at their best places him as the best contender for the title of “Last Roman.” Being the “Last Roman” is a pathway to military abilities some consider unnatural. He became so powerful that Justinian was afraid of losing power in favor of his general. Fortunately for Justinian, Belisarius was always loyal to him. Ironic. Belisarius walked the path many trod to become the Augustus before him, yet he did not do so himself. "
