raspberry_pi,ff5rlg8,t3_erlsu9,1579607515.0," So  here's my issue, everything was working fine up until I started using  ngrok and it started receiving requests.   I have the aluminum heat sink  case and dual fans. Fans were quiet as a mouse, then all of a sudden  they just started getting faster and faster until I became afraid for my  life and pulled the plug. The fans themselves are plugged into the 5v  and the Ground pins, with no program controlling them. They have no way  of detecting temperature, and the pi itself isn't on a surface that  could cause it to short circuit. It's happily sitting there with a power  supply (official pi4 supply), ethernet and a usb stick running ngrok,  apache2 and mysql. What could have caused the fans to suddenly  exponentially increase their speed?  The pi itself continued to be  responsive and temperature didn't change in the 30 seconds before I  pulled the plug, it stayed at a steady 46c.

Is this an issue for the ghostbusters?"
