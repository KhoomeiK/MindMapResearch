DebateReligion,feiiui5,t1_feigych,1579139537.0,"Grew up Catholic and knew a lot of Lutherans it came up more than a few times. I can't imagine my friends and neighbors were the only people who misunderstood this. If all those people didn't understand the theology of the religion they professed to believe does the theology matter? What difference does the opinion of a small group of scholars make if thousands of lay people get it completely wrong? They're the ones out there living their lives according to what they mistakenly think is true. 

Then regardless if any bad at all is infiitely worse than a lifetime of mostly harmless actions can ever make up for why does faith have to enter into it? You were questioning me on which god is more rational does a god who gives a single flying fuck if you believe in him sound rational to you?

DebateAnAtheist,feigoo1,t3_epaz5k,1579138111.0,"I feel like I was born halfway there. I always disliked going to church even when I firmly believed it was the right thing to do and went every week of my own volition. I never experienced any type of spiritual ""connection with God"" or heard him talking to me or whatever. I spent my childhood asking if all the Bible stories really happened. 

There were two big things that got the ball rolling. One was being told that there was zero evidence the Exodus happened at all. By then I'd accepted that the stories probably had some exaggerations to them but the idea that nothing existed to confirm that it wasn't just completely made up blew my mind. I started questioning everything in the Bible. 

About that same time the second major Catholic pedophilia scandal happened (about 2002 or so). The first time I was able to justify it as a few bad priests with the second one it was clear to me that it was a much bigger problem than they'd said and many people in the Church hierarchy knew about it. I didn't want to be Catholic anymore

I started looking for another Church. During that process I sincerely considered the possibility of there not being a god at all for the first time. The idea stuck, it grew and eventually I decided it was more likely than any of the religions I'd looked into."

DebateReligion,feibh9x,t1_fei8vn5,1579134611.0,"I have never encountered a god described by a major religion that seemed reasonable to me. If there were one I'd think its most likely attitude towards which religion you follow to be complete apathy as it makes no difference whatsoever. 

However, in my experience, when the average idiot is describing salvation by faith alone they do in fact mean ""god saves the people who believe in Jesus full stop"". I'd never call it intelligent but I don't find it significantly more silly than caring about which religion you follow at all."
DebateReligion,fei7uyl,t1_fei7iha,1579132233.0,Honestly I don't see why the numerous lay people's belief that just picking the right team is enough to score salvation is any less valid than your insistence that more than that is required.
