abusiverelationships,fcwn8t0,t3_eiulif,1578030483.0,"Hey there OP, firstly all I want to say is I’m so sorry that you’re going through this because you don’t deserve it at all.I am so proud of you for leaving your Ex and holding on to life. I know it sounds stupid but you still have more of your life to live and the first step for that is leaving your ex which you already did! Im sorry that she’s lying about your relationship with her which shows how manipulative she is. I’m so proud that you started getting help and moving away from her. One day sit with your new friends and tell them about what happened after clearing your head. Take some leave and go somewhere with your best friend or someone closest to you. If you can’t tell them type it out and show it to them. Not being able to express yourself is an effect of her abusing you and your first step for moving forward is leaving her and that’s done :)) I’m always here if you need to talk and you’re defined not alone 💜💛❤️
P.s.- If your spelling is bad I think I’m gonna fail my English exam"
abusiverelationships,fcwmdtc,t3_eiy67n,1578029720.0,"Hey OP, your girlfriend is petrified and that is actually understandable because it must have been a horrible experience for her. Give her some time and make great memories with her so the past won’t affect the future anymore. It’s so nice to see that you’re visiting subs in order to attain more insight and that displays how good your character is. Also lastly prioritise yourself at times as well and don’t be afraid to express your opinion about anything. Keep being a good person and you’re not alone 💛💜❤️"
abusiverelationships,fcwm2et,t3_ej2wkk,1578029443.0,"Hey there OP first thing your ex is a complete piece of shit and screaming at him or lashing out at him is exactly what he deserves. Leave his old friend because he doesn’t sound too great either, sending pics of your private conversation with him. I’m so proud of you because you’re strong building yourself up after your ex. Keep on going! I’d suggest to block your ex because he’s going to take every opportunity he can to downplay his abuse and his texts aren’t going to help you move on I’m glad people are starting to realise who he really is. Keep your head high because it’s not in the cards for him to accept what he did to you soon. You’re not alone and I’m always here if you need to talk 💛💜❤️"
abusiverelationships,fcwllx2,t3_ej494w,1578029059.0,Hey OP just want to say that I’m really proud of you for doing great after leaving him! The connection between you guys is always going to be there but your success without him around definitely defeats that. You are absolutely making the right choice 💛🧡💜
abusiverelationships,fcwlft4,t3_ej4dtl,1578028915.0,"Hey OP you’re definitely right it’s completely ok for you to be moving on. Actually it’s really good. I’m so proud of you for finally leaving him, he sounds terrible and sounds like he’s still trying to control you in some type of aspect but glad you’re not letting that get to you too much!! Have fun with your date this weekend and be whoever you want to be with him without your ex weighing you down 💛🧡💜"
abusiverelationships,fcwl9pv,t3_ej4ntb,1578028772.0,Yay OP I’m so proud of you! She doesn’t deserve you. Glad you’re eating and just enjoying and you’re absolutely right about 2020 being your year ❤️🧡💛
abusiverelationships,fcwl36k,t1_fcwjroa,1578028617.0,Don’t worry about it just glad I helped and glad that you’re staying so strong 💛🧡❤️💜
abusiverelationships,fcwklnd,t3_ej8t2i,1578028209.0,"First of all, OP I’d like to say that you are insanely strong for having to go through this ❤️💛💜.Secondly I’d like to add that you do not sound like a band person at all and I suggest if these thoughts keep occurring, go to a therapist and receive medication for anxiety. Thirdly I’d like to mention that your friends don’t seem very nice since they have it out for you so I suggest after some time, leaving them. I’m so sorry about your boyfriend history it sounds awful and you definitely got the rotten eggs. Hey at least now that you’ve tried the worst you get the best right? My best friend had a boyfriend who treated her terribly and made himself the victim in every scenario and it took her a while but she left him. With the right kind of support and help, she built a life without him and now she is absolutely flourishing. I suggest removing yourself out of this toxic company and relying on your family or a therapist for help and support. Take some time and clear your head. Finally, I’m always here to talk you’re not alone 💛❤️💜"
abusiverelationships,fcwjo8k,t3_ej9l91,1578027448.0,"Hey OP, I’m glad that he stays in the past tense because he sounds really manipulative and controlling of you. He keeps turning the blame on you when he’s the one to blame which proves he will never be loyal. Missing him is completely normal no need to worry because you might cling on to the better parts of the relationship or have a bond with him. I had a friend exactly like this and she broke up with her boyfriend. It took a lot for her to do that and she kept regretting it but now she’s happier than ever and learnt to build a life without him. Stay strong OP and I’m always here to talk because you’re not alone 💜💛❤️"
abusiverelationships,fcwjdsb,t3_ejafw1,1578027214.0,"Hey there OP, I will undoubtedly pray for you and I’m so proud that you’re finally ending things with him.

nofriends,fcmq1ry,t3_ehiz4t,1577786570.0,Hey there OP I have gone through having no friends before but now that’s changed. I’d suggest moving somewhere new where no one knows you and join some support groups or go to a therapist to make what ever personality you want. Good luck and I’m always here if you wanna talk to so you’re not alone :)) 💜💛💜
socialanxiety,fcmpo9v,t3_ehttlc,1577786036.0,Yeah definitely there are a lot of people who are going through so much and life’s just not fair at all at this point :( . I’m so proud of you that you think of people and empathise with them which clearly displays how valuable of a person you are :)) You are definitely not a failure and berating yourself for going through something that is not weird at all will only make it worse. I’d suggest going to a therapist or a support group as it will increase your confidence while allowing you to interact with like minded people :) baby steps

socialanxiety,fcmmdma,t1_fcmlyo9,1577781440.0,Ah yes I understand so hard. What I did is that I started taking baby steps like texting first or giving an opinion in a group chat. It takes a lot to overcome that initial fear but then it becomes better and easier to progress from there :))
socialanxiety,fcmm49r,t3_ehzvbp,1577781094.0,Oof I get you. If you want you can start to take tiny steps like texting in a group chat or texting someone first with like a meme or something and kinda progress from there :))

socialanxiety,fcmll4b,t3_ehswzv,1577780405.0,"Hey OP I wanna let you know that I'm sorry for what you're going through and yes this has happened to me. I have distanced myself numerous amount of times and felt incredibly guilty about all the drama or pain I'm causing. What I did was tell them about my anxiety (thankfully they understood) and I took a few days oft figure myself out without the pressure or obligation of doing anything. After I cleared my head, I was able to join some support groups online and in real life where I understood that it was ok to feel like this and how to stop going in a downward spiral. A therapist is also highly recommended and if you're ever feeling alone, I'm here to talk and discord has many servers for anxiety and depression where people are available 24/7. Good luck!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
socialanxiety,fcmlbtb,t3_ehzvbp,1577780076.0,"Hello there. I have a success story and it started with me moving to a different school where no one knew me and I could create my own personality. I'd say first develop your personality by looking at common interests to a person your age group and join a few clubs or social anxiety support groups so you're around like minded people. Then ask you talk more, confidence increases and slowly you'll feel better. I have faith in you OP and I'm always here to talk. You are never alone ❤️❤️❤️❤️"

socialanxiety,fcml2pn,t3_ehvzaz,1577779755.0,"hey OP I'm really sorry to know that's what your going through. I would definitely tell your old friends why you isolated yourself and if they don't understand move on because everything has a reason. I would join a club or a gym or something like that so you have an opportunity to socialise and create your own identity. Start off with slowly increasing the number of people you hang out with an eventually you'll get there! I believe in you, you aren't alone and I'm always down to talk if you want. Good luck!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
socialanxiety,fcmkv7s,t3_ehuux7,1577779490.0,"Yes I moved to a new school tho. I had really bad anxiety and was very quiet and kept to myself.
