A shirt can be either Small, Medium, or Large and (independently) 50/50 polycotton or 100% cotton. The two systems don't interact so much, they describe two different aspects.

Likewise, your blood groups describe different things. Each is representative of a surface element on your red cells. If you're type B, that means you have galactose (a sugar) bound to your red cell membranes. Type AB people have that as well, plus another carbohydrate called GalNac. 

The +/- part is a different system. It describes whether or not you have the Rh antigens on your cell membranes. There are a few of these, it's a group of proteins rather than carbohydrate. 

In the case of a lot of red cell antigens, they are important parts if the membrane that perform a function. Causing an immune reaction is secondary to their purpose. I believe, so far as we know, the ABO antigens are just there for cell to cell recognition."
