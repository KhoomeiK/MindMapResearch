cats,ffiyo0w,t3_etwhnb,1579985966.0,"I personally would be amazed and thrilled if someone found a cat I'd lost. Hell, it's been several years and I still hope for something like that to happen to me. So you should definitely make that happen for them if you can."
writing,ffik6of,t1_ffiizpj,1579975827.0,"Well, I assumed they did it based on the quality of the writing, not by the subject matter or style."
writing,ffifbul,t3_etteaf,1579972513.0,"Wow. I knew it was bad, but I had no idea it was this bad. Do publishers really judge books by personal taste?"
FanFiction,fffxv4i,t3_etej9w,1579894179.0,"I listen to music. Certain songs for certain scenes, and since I'm writing for the MCU I usually have Immigrant Song on repeat during battle scenes. :p For sad scenes, I listen to sad songs, and so on. And sometimes when I get stuck I watch CinemaSins or Screen Rant's Pitch Meetings if I need to go over a certain scene without watching the whole movie. :p"
movies,fff9wg5,t3_etbqi0,1579879279.0,"Yeah, that's how they trick you. They did something similar with Birdman."
FanFiction,ffefdus,t1_ffef185,1579845907.0,"I mean, it does make sense, but for some reason it just sounds weird to me."
cats,ffee6ir,t3_et6109,1579844689.0,Omg our cats do that too. They're so weird.
FanFiction,ffdnt48,t3_et1aes,1579824827.0,"My main fandom is the MCU, and I realized today that this thing has literally consumed half my life. Iron Man was released when I was 12. Now I'm 24. But even though I've been a fan for a long time, I've only recently started writing fanfiction for it. Mostly because I didn't like how certain things played out during the last few movies."
writing,ffd5dwe,t1_ffd35wd,1579813750.0,That's actually what I want to do lol. I want to make a book for each of them and then this one with the multiple pov's will be the last of the series.
writing,ffd2zys,t1_ffd1t2m,1579812410.0,There are 6-8 main characters that I'll be switching between. I still haven't decided about two of them.
cats,ffd06al,t3_esyp1m,1579810828.0,Go to the vet. See if he has a microchip.
writing,ffczycg,t1_ffcze25,1579810707.0,That was a book too? I thought it was just the movie.
writing,ffczqjj,t1_ffcz1ox,1579810586.0,"Yeah, I actually plan on making it a series, but I'm kind of writing them all at the same time. So only the last book will have the pov switching thing."
writing,ffcz9x1,t1_ffcyris,1579810329.0,"Yeah, the characters do interact with each other a lot. So it's not like a bunch of individual stories."
writing,ffcyuis,t1_ffcyfpw,1579810092.0,"I guess I should've mentioned that it won't be every chapter, but I will be switching it very often."
cats,ffaptno,t3_eslct0,1579741664.0,Do you think maybe the cat had been abused before he got to the shelter? That could be why he's so aggressive.
FanFiction,ff9ju9w,t3_erwzl8,1579714534.0,"When people add apostraphies after every single word that ends in the letter S when they're not trying to make it a possessive. Like, ""What are your favorite book's."" Or, ""I love dog's.""

Sometimes it honestly feels like I'm the only one who ever paid attention in English, and it pisses me off to no end."
FanFiction,ff9brym,t1_ff9bd67,1579709361.0,"lol yeah, I wasn't planning on doing that. I just wanted to add the title so people could have a better idea of the scene."
FanFiction,ff63di8,t1_ff5k64v,1579618120.0,Thanks. I hope I can pull it off.
FanFiction,ff4e4hq,t1_ff4b1hh,1579561448.0,"Okay, so this is going to be canon compliant. In the sense that none of the stuff we see on screen will change. Instead, it's going to deal with Loki trying to escape Niflheim (Hel, where Odin imprisoned Hela, is apparently a specific region within that realm). So I wanted the story to take place there, and maybe actually have him escape when the canon part of the story ends."
FanFiction,ff3ysze,t1_ff3wna9,1579551818.0,Well I'm glad someone's interested at least. :p
FanFiction,ff3yjsm,t1_ff3ybdr,1579551655.0,"That's what I wanted to do, yeah. Dig deeper into a character that, in my opinion, did not get explored enough."
FanFiction,ff3wfg8,t1_ff3w104,1579550329.0,"Well the fandom is the MCU, and said character would be Loki. So there would be a lot of filling in the blanks and things like that on my part."
FanFiction,ff3o7ac,t1_ff3lvl6,1579545262.0,That's what I'm worried about too. How to make it feel fresh while still using the canon dialogue and stuff.
writing,ff3j8sz,t1_ff3iysh,1579542216.0,I meant what is American Gods about.
writing,ff35xqg,t1_ff2msvu,1579534459.0,What's that about?
FanFiction,ff35twk,t1_ff2mjvq,1579534383.0,Have you seen Infinity War and Endgame? (Because in order to talk about it I have to spoil some stuff.)
writing,ff1rqc6,t3_er47bh,1579484708.0,I take issue with that last part - writing IS my joy. And I write more than I read because I can never seem to find a book I like. It's like I'll start reading and then realize I'm not interested - so I move on to the next book and it's the same thing. I think that's why I had more fun reading when I was younger. Books geared toward younger kids get straight to the point. They don't mess around with the boring stuff.
Art,ff0razf,t3_er32qt,1579471568.0,"I think the most useless art lesson ever was when the teacher made us study a color wheel and how the colors related to each other.

As if we already couldn't see that.

This was in middle school, btw."
fanart,ff0gl6q,t3_er2cbu,1579468661.0,Dude. You did all that with a bunch of tiny little dots? That's amazing!
cosplay,fezh4m3,t3_eqzr7l,1579457282.0,Ooh. What material are you using?
FanFiction,feyq8v8,t3_eqrus0,1579449226.0,"I'm doing an au fic where 2012 Loki from Endgame travels to the future and gets the Infinity Stones for himself.

I'm also working on a canon compliant story that's also from Loki's perspective."
FanFiction,feyokox,t1_fexg7kn,1579448353.0,"That makes perfect sense, actually. Even in life, Loki was never really one to show his true emotions (except during the times you described). So my problem now is just, how does that sort of denial affect his actions? Would he even realize he's in denial? Or would he know it but just not express it?"
FanFiction,feyknpf,t1_fexql4p,1579446858.0,What comic is this from?
FanFiction,feuncml,t1_feujmwz,1579388201.0,"Well this involves Norse mythology, where they either go to Valhalla or Hel (like Hell, but one L), and people believed they were physical places that even living people could find. So in the myths, it is possible to escape."
FanFiction,feu2637,t1_fetzgjo,1579382394.0,"Well, you should. They're awesome.

But since you haven't seen it, I won't spoil anything for you. :p"
FanFiction,fetz5za,t1_fetswhk,1579381484.0,"Okay, so before I say anything else, have you seen Infinity War?"
FanFiction,fetqo6r,t1_fetpxi6,1579378475.0,"There wasn't, but the person I'm talking about here is Loki, who I feel wouldn't just sit back and accept things. I feel like he would still try to use his powers to influence things - which is what my story is about. I just don't know how he might do that, or if he would be traumatized at all or just, really angry."
FanFiction,fetq19i,t1_feton71,1579378224.0,That's actually a really cool idea. Maybe you could make it into a full story.
FanFiction,fetpbl1,t1_fetotql,1579377950.0,"Well, have you seen Infinity War?"
CharacterDevelopment,fetnd4c,t1_fetka7z,1579377167.0,"I didn't realize that was such a common trope. But I do like your idea of them using her for blood, so they don't have to keep killing people."
CharacterDevelopment,fes1eez,t1_feqe4s4,1579360440.0,Well her main reason is to make sure nobody figures out what they are and starts hunting them.
writing,feplva0,t3_eqc57u,1579323928.0,Dude. You really need to work on your summary writing.
harrypotter,feor9dw,t3_eq8dnw,1579304359.0,Nope.
FanFiction,feomd1d,t1_feoljva,1579302094.0,"I get it if it's part of the canon, and yeah I can see how it might help to vent if something like that actually happened to a person - but there are so many. It makes me worry. Like - do people actually like this stuff? And why?"
CharacterDevelopment,feol0xk,t1_feojuss,1579301598.0,"She still lives with them, yeah. But she always has to be careful about opening doors and windows and stuff (because of sunlight). And she can't really have friends over because of all the weirdness."
CharacterDevelopment,feojohj,t1_feojljr,1579301052.0,"Oh, it's not an inherited thing. The rest of her family was bitten by other vampires - she wasn't."

FanFiction,feogm5g,t1_feoebnu,1579299908.0,That's normal? Really?
FanFiction,fenm5gk,t3_eq0b1g,1579287642.0,"I'm new to fanfiction, and when I discovered the rape/incest tags it almost made me want to quit altogether.

FanFiction,fenlwvc,t1_fen7jze,1579287494.0,"Uh.

What?"
cats,femm9cl,t3_epzfyr,1579262325.0,Also he's adopted.
CharacterDevelopment,fem8rna,t1_fem0wi7,1579243921.0,"Yeah, no. He's not going to be perfect, and he definitely has his flaws. He's not going to be like Superman or anything."
CharacterDevelopment,fem0dhz,t1_felzc5c,1579235734.0,"Well, I could tell you, but that would spoil a big part of the story. ;)"
CharacterDevelopment,felz0n3,t1_felysxv,1579234603.0,What do you mean?
CharacterDevelopment,felypft,t1_felyl6s,1579234355.0,Actually he's the opposite. He even has a wife and kids.

Marvel,fekrf8c,t1_fekbxkw,1579206054.0,"I mean, I'd like to think so too, but, how?"
FanFiction,fek5b4c,t1_fek03f8,1579192918.0,Cool. So what do you want to use to share your stuff? Like email or google docs or something?
cats,fejzi0w,t3_epkxvr,1579189363.0,lol my sister's cat does the same thing but for butter. :p
FanFiction,fejz175,t3_epjjgt,1579189071.0,Oh yeah. And I don't even outline. I just kind of have the plan in my head. Still surprises me though.
FanFiction,fejwhcz,t1_fejhd6w,1579187442.0,Sure. What fandom are you writing for?
FanFiction,fej7nai,t1_fej7g4w,1579160334.0,"So like, Superman?"

FanFiction,fej4cbk,t3_epeb8p,1579156413.0,"Fandoms: I'm mostly familiar with the MCU, Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts, and The 100. I am NOT familiar with most anime, though I have seen One Punch Man and Death Note in full, so I could beta for those too.

Preferred Genre: Anything but romance. Sorry.

Subjects I won't tackle: Pedophilia, rape/incest, etc. I'm sorry if it's a vital part of the story or even canon. I just can't.

Type of beta: I can be a soundboard and a grammar check.

Word count: I have no minimum. My max would have to be around 100k.

One-off or ongoing: I can do both.

Time constraints: I'm a pretty fast reader, so I should be able to get to you within a reasonable amount of time. Probably a few days or a week for longer stories though.

What I'd like in exchange: Nothing. I'm just doing this for fun."
CharacterDevelopment,feiv7ag,t1_feitdmo,1579148100.0,That's what I was thinking too.
CharacterDevelopment,feisjkr,t1_feirqxt,1579146104.0,I didn't think of that. But for some reason I feel like a hyphenated name would only make the character seem pretentious.
CharacterDevelopment,feirscg,t1_feirbk9,1579145570.0,"The ""resolute protector"" definitely fits his character more. Ugh. It sucks because his name was going to be William Vincent (Vincent being the middle name), but then I realized I like the first name Vincent too. Now I can't decide."

writing,fehv7f1,t1_fehuedz,1579124522.0,"That's true, yeah. They could assume that someone was staging the whole thing to look that way - then they find out it's actually a vampire. Could be a cool little twist."
writing,fehsqti,t1_fehsh6y,1579123131.0,"Well that's the thing: it actually is a vampire, but, you know, humans investigating it would want to think it's something else, right?"
