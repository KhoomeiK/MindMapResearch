All the best to you!"
DecidingToBeBetter,ff8u3cf,t3_esal49,1579696122.0,"There is only 1 answer to that final question: a big fat YES. I loved reading your whole story because you're getting outside of your comfort zone and that's what necessary to become better. Doing something that makes you afraid is exactly the kind of thing you need to take on in your life! So congratulations on being asked and with taking on that challenge. 

Obviously, other people see something in you and you deserve to be running for that position. Otherwise, it wouldn't have happened. You seem like a very honest and genuine person who truly cares and works for what he wants. To me, all of those are super important characteristics in life and they should not be valued lightly. Don't underestimate yourself so easily and have a little faith. 

Even if you don't win this election, it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. You'll have learnt an extra lesson. And as long as you keep getting outside of your comfort zone and risking to fail, you'll keep growing. Not winning is not a problem. Not giving it your all and not learning from it, is. 

I wish you the best of luck! Try to enjoy and learn from the whole experience!"
DecidingToBeBetter,ff8tqbv,t3_esaoc2,1579695749.0,"I definitely feel you on this one. You have to realize that the people who really love you, want to protect you. They don't know what will make you truly happy or fulfilled and it's hard for them to see you try something difficult. It's one our natural instincts.

Chasing your dreams is difficult and it comes with hardships. However, that's no reason not to chase them. In fact, it's the only thing which will make you feel truly alive and fulfilled. People who tell you that you're young and should enjoy life might not have found their own purpose/chased their own dreams. Follow advice from people who have succeeded in chasing their dreams. Their advice is to work for it every single day. 

So go ahead and fight for what you believe in. It might not be easy but it's definitely worth it. I'm not even successful in what I'm doing but I'm chasing my dreams. And I can tell you, it feels better than anything! 

Hope this helps!!"
DecidingToBeBetter,feyntri,t1_feylszf,1579448070.0,Did you read Atomic Habits and implement those tips?
DecidingToBeBetter,fexmu9a,t3_equz2p,1579433415.0,"I don't think your post is pretentious. You're just being honest and that's great. Let me try to give you some advice! 

A lot of people are just content with the way they are living their lives. They might feel like their job isn't perfect but they don't truly care. They don't really think about a deeper purpose or sense of fulfillment and that's completely fine. 

However, some people are NOT content with that kind of life without real meaning/purpose. Just like me, you're in that category of people. You can't just make that itchy feeling go away by ignoring it because as you said, one day it might come back and it will hit you hard in the face. 

So that means there is only 1 option: work at it. Find yourself and your discipline. In finding those, you will find meaning and purpose. It might take a month, a year or ten years. It's not about the end result but about being on the path towards fulfilment. You have to realize that it takes time and effort and a lot of boring work. 

I think you should not think about 'should I pursue something meaningful in my life?' because the answer is yes. Instead, think about how to do it. 

To me, the only way to move forward from where you are right now is trying different things. Try what you think is meaningful. Do social work. Stop your bad habits and create good ones. It's going to be tough and you are going to have days in which you might feel like giving up but once you're on that path, you will find your peace of mind. 

I wish you the best of luck and if you have any questions for implementing good habits or whatever, let me know!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fexl2aq,t3_equw9q,1579432741.0,Best of luck! You can DM me :)
getdisciplined,fethjdh,t1_fest2y0,1579375546.0,"Okay good luck with working further on it! Also remember, nobody starts doing something and is an expert in it right away.

productivity,fes4752,t3_eqh71i,1579361229.0,"Let me try to offer you some FIXES. 

It's a bit unclear to me what the exact problem with those emails is. You mention first that you might be spending too much time trying to make it perfect but then you say you're underestimating the value of it? Which side do you think you're leaning to? 

Aside from that, what about starting your day with these little tasks? I have no idea what kind of projects you're currently working on, but if you feel like you need to complete these tasks quickly, then you might want to put this as a first priority of the day."
getdisciplined,fes3n3t,t3_eqgihl,1579361038.0,"Everyone has their own journey in life. It's not because yours is going less smoothly than others that it's less of a success. You learn a lot while going through these kind of experiences. 

Are you into books? If so, I really recommend you listen to the audioversion of ""Can't hurt me"" from David Goggins. If you open an Audible account, you can listen to it for free. He offers a perspective of hope with practical tips that you can use. The man himself has suffered more than anyone and has come out on the other side.

Let me know if that is helpful or not!"

selfimprovement,ferky8w,t1_ferff77,1579355249.0,"Personally, my go-to's are ""The School of Greatness"" by Lewis Howes, who talks about so many interesting topics! Whether it be healing, loving yourself/others, business, sports,... He has great speakers and the way he goes about it just awesome. 

Then on the other hand, there is the Joe Rogan podcast. I don't like every episode but there are definitely a couple of interesting ones! For example, the one with Matthew Walker about sleep is a must watch!

Hope you'll like these."
selfimprovement,ferko0v,t1_fergror,1579355133.0,"This is a very good one indeed! Linked to that is using a gratitude jar. Each day/week, you put in a note with something you were greatful for.

DecidingToBeBetter,feqvyu2,t3_eqedc0,1579346726.0,"Seems like you passed the test, if you ask me. The hurt might stay for a long time, but you're walking in the right direction. You'll be tested more often and you might not always pass the test, but that's fine. That's part of life. 

Thanks for sharing your story and best of luck!"
productivity,fepryot,t3_eqc6ho,1579329250.0,"The number 1 trick for getting more productive is getting yourself in the right state of mind. I believe most of us have some kind of 'trick' that makes us want to do something productive, whether that being music, reading something or self-talk. Experiment with that and you will find it is much easier to get out of that feeling of being stuck. 

The 2nd one, I would say, is eliminating distractions. If you know you're going to be on your phone or computer while you have to study/work, just leave it somewhere else. You might think about it often at the beginning but that will subside. Just make it harder to fall into those distractions/bad patterns."
crossfit,feprq3k,t3_eqapzy,1579329024.0,"Great progress, thanks for sharing. As others have mentioned, your elbow rotation has improved greatly already. It seems to me that your wrist flexibility could be improved as well? It seems like your wrists sometimes cause you to not go immediately into that front rack position. I'm not sure if you've noticed/experienced that yourself and maybe already worked on it but it might be relevant.

Good luck with your next goal!"
getdisciplined,fepq7pq,t3_eqc3qd,1579327634.0,"To me, it seems like you've improved your situation quite a bit already and you should be proud of that. You dare to accept that there are working points and that's definitely a first step! 

I think it is important to think about why you are getting those activity-associated anxiety attacks. For example, if you want to cook a basic meal, what makes you anxious? What do you think could go terribly wrong? The same holds for writing. Are you afraid your writing is not going to be good enough?"
crossfit,fepm5os,t1_fenur1q,1579324154.0,Ok sounds like you know your priorities then! Good luck!
getdisciplined,fenqnab,t1_fen0g7a,1579289388.0,"I like the description. However, interest is not something that just stays. You have to fight to stay interested. Whenever you have days that suck, you'll have to keep pushing anyways. This is with everything in life.

You talk about not having anything new to do so maybe you could start exploring. Think about what you used to like and shortly engage in that activity? You might find the joy in it again. 

My last point was about the fact that you should build willpower and discipline. You say that you want to perform extremely well but why is that? And if that's really what you want, then you need to work for it, whether you like it or not. 

Getting something that you want is not always enjoyable. 

Let me know if this is clear and helpful."
crossfit,fenpwp4,t1_fenc5jh,1579289168.0,"So basically last year, your engine was running at 100% combining CF and cycling or CF and running and now you want to combine the 3 + do extra crossfit work?

I don't want to discourage you of getting all that training in because I believe it is possible, it's just a matter of how. The only way I see it possible is to prioritize well. You can't hit CF hard 5 times, cycle 2 times and run 4 times and expect to recover like a beast. It's just not going to happen. 

A feasible example would be: 
 
Monday: Light crossfit training + running longer distance 
Tuesday: cycling interval training
Wednesday: recovery run
Thursday: Decent crossfit training + low intensity cycling
Friday: running intervals
Saturday: good crossfit training
Sunday: rest day

I mean, this is just an example from the top of my head which is going to reaaally push your recovery to the extremes (of course depending on your current fitness level). And this is 3x crossfit, 2x cycling and 3x running. 4/5x crossfit is going to be hard without reducing your cycling/running, I guess."
DecidingToBeBetter,fencclk,t3_eq2wxn,1579281653.0,"To me, it seems like there are 2 reasons to travel: 

1) because you like it and it gives you satisfaction

2) because you get outside your comfort zone and can grow as a person (but this depends on the kind of holiday)

You're saying that you don't get much satisfaction from traveling. Do you feel like it gets you outside of your comfort zone? If not, then the choice is easy: don't travel. 

Just to give my personal perspective, I've been on a student exchange for 4 months to Singapore and 4 months to India. I went to India because it made me uncomfortable. Now that I'm back and friends are talking about traveling, I don't care at all. I don't have the need for it so why would I do it? 

It seems like you have made up your mind and you're just looking for confirmation/validation. Trust your instincts and do what is good for you in the long run and what makes you happy and fulfilled. If that is something else than traveling, that is perfectly fine!"
crossfit,fenbt3p,t1_fen2515,1579281322.0,"So basically you want to do the same as you did last year when you had to scale back because the volume was too much? Considering that your overall fitness has improved from last year, you might be able to bear higher volume. Also make sure to focus on recovery as that is also a key factor in the amount of volume you can take. 

Apart from that, like others have mentioned, talk it over with your coaches and they should adapt your crossfit trainings based on the volume of cycling and running."
DecidingToBeBetter,fen092r,t3_eq1jw6,1579274057.0,"Well, what kind of person do you want to be? Probably not a lazy one, right?

What kind of person are you being right now by not getting up and doing the things you have to do?

What do you have to do in order to be the kind of person that you want to be? Most likely just get up and do those things. Live becomes easy once you start doing the things you should be doing.

I hope this will make you realize that it's all about being honest with yourself and doing what you believe makes you a good person."
productivity,fen0155,t3_eq07w7,1579273910.0,"I like the concept but have some concerns about it. It seems like the most important tasks will hereby stay on the background instead of putting them first?

getdisciplined,femzs98,t3_eq1fb6,1579273745.0,"I have got two tips for you: 

1) Be excited to study. You're combining work and study, why is that? What are you studying for? See the value and start enjoying that work. 

2) Make it harder to play the computer or watch the TV. For example, plug out those devices every time you're done and then when you come home, you might choose the easier option of studying over plugging those damn cabels in! 

Hope these help."
getdisciplined,femwdzy,t3_eq0wz1,1579271355.0,"what u/fedornuthugger has said is definitely true. I would add to that that you should try and find that curiosity again. You said you lost interest for almost anything so why is that? I can imagine there are still subjects/areas in life that you like to know more about? Find out what those are and make the connection to your current subjects!

If that doesn't work, then see it as a learning school. For whatever you will do in life after this, discipline will be useful. Use this period as a time in which you experiment with different methods that you can use later in life.

Good luck!"
crossfit,femw0tp,t3_eq0qo3,1579271088.0,"Sound like cool events! 

First of all, how did that training go last year? It seems like you are taking on similar challenges to last year, except for the fact that you want to train for Crossfit twice as much as you did last year?

I believe it is definitely possible to still train Crossfit 3-5 days a week while you're training for your cycling and half marathon. Most likely, you'll have to include cycling and running in your Crossfit training and also scale back the strength work."

Stoicism,femuw41,t3_eq0k53,1579270247.0,"I think you already got a couple of good answers. I can share 1 more point of view which is that of 'Amor Fati'. You might have heard of it already but Nietzsche has said ""Not merely to bear what is necessary... but to love it."" 

Battling an injury for already 3 years myself, I have come to implement this message. Whenever you think of injury as something negative, realize 2 things: 

1) It is part of the sport that you love and therefore you have chosen for this. Own the good and the bad. 

2) Learn the lesson from the injury. Use it as fuel and as an opportunity to become better. Injury shows you a point of weakness so transform that point of weakness and turn it into a strength. Don't let this opportunity go to waste. 

These 2 steps are not completely in line with stoicism, but can definitely help you as an athlete!"
selfimprovement,femtsk7,t3_eq0j77,1579269387.0,"I think it is a very relevant question because we all sometimes feel like we're not living up to our full potential. However, the only thing that really matters is: are you trying right now? Whatever you might have done wrong in the past, none of that really matters today. What have you done today to make your existence a success?   


And this is completely subjective. Everyone can define a successful existence differently. The standard is not what society sets but what you set for yourself. In the end, we can only judge ourselves based on our own actions. I'd rather do the thing I love every day and go down swinging than not trying and complying to other people's forms of success.

selfimprovement,fem94ss,t3_epvbqi,1579244338.0,"It is okay to think about the things you want to do in the future. However, every time you start think about those things, remind yourself of this simple fact: you only have now and what you do right now is all that matters.

Thinking about life is very important, but if we are not acting in accordance with what we think, then what value does the thinking even have? 

Therefore, every time you realize that you want to do a lot or have a lot to do, realize that you will only get there by getting to work right now. And then put in that work.

I hope this helps you!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fekg0m2,t3_epn6vy,1579199266.0,"First of all, it is important to be not too hard on yourself. You realize that you have done something which was not true to yourself and have thereby set the first step. To get over that self hate, the best thing to do is practise self love. Not the kind of self love where you just say to yourself that you love yourself, but implementing routines that make you love yourself. 

Think about the kind of person you want to be and start being that person. 1 day at a time. Learn to forgive yourself for past mistakes and accept that you can only control what you do right now. We all make mistakes and we all have to live with those.
