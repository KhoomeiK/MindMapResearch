GetMotivated,fcnpj27,t1_fcnkj2v,1577815996.0,"That's basically it in a nutshell. My philosophy was and still is to replace cig cravings with anything that isn't worse for me than smoking said cig. If candy or a walk works, super, if it takes a bowl of herb fine. Just stay the course."

searchandrescue,fc0ndul,t3_efcytc,1577295172.0,"Happened two counties over from me. They're really just lucky that the weather cleared enough to get assets up in the air. They had 30 some miles to make it through hip deep snow to walk themselves out to Delores. They possibly could have made it, but quite possibly not. Especially with the slide risks in the area. The family got really lucky everything lined up for them.

Looks like the sheriff's office handled it all. My county wasn't summoned for assistance."
