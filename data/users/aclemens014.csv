Got some Directional Konics, but realizing they would likely be bad for learning Jibbing, etc....

Would a basic All mountain twin like the Ross Smash 7 be a good starting point? Small airs, small jibs and some piste as well. East coast groomers and glades.

Also have an option for Honey Badgers, but worried they may be too park focused for me right now

Im saying theres a difference in the right to DO something and the right to not be taken advantage of. Yes, I have no idea how to quantify WHO decides what, but that doesn't invalidate the idea.

As a former smoker of 15 years, I feel I have seen both sides. I was a fool to think I enjoyed smoking.

I don't understand why so many American's get all up in arms about differentiating ""freedom"" with ""taking advantage of people"". No one is trying to take your freedoms away... observers think its sad and sickening to see a restaurant get famous for giving morbidly obese people food that will help to kill them for free. That not freedom, its marketing."
todayilearned,fdh5kds,t1_fdh37r4,1578415854.0,"You've got the freedom to take it however you want.

But it wasn't.

There's a difference between having the ability to eat a variety of foods and offering free 2000+ calorie meals to people clearly with an addiction to food. Its really unfortunate to see it backed up. 

Just give free cigarettes to kids, as long they know the repercussions its all in the name of freedom right?"
