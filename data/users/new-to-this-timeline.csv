Grandfather is suffering dementia that is getting worse, especially since grandma has been in physical therapy rehab recovering from an injury. He hasn’t been violent to grand kid before this incident but has always been a selfish hard ass. 

OP had been home all day and grandpa didn’t mention the printer until just before OP had to work. The car belongs to OP and is in OP’s name, Gpaw only helped to pay a little. He doesn’t have claim to the car. 

Gpaw was hitting and clawing to get the keys away from OP while they were trying to leave. A neighbor came to help. OP plans to move out when Gmaw is back at 100%.

Advice,fem7wir,t3_epw305,1579242960.0,"Most people with mouth herpes get them this same way, usually innocent activities. Luckily, people will typically get only a few breakouts in their whole life. The older you get the less frequent they usually become. 

A breakout usually lasts about 10 days and starts with a tingle feeling in or on the lip. Abreeva is the best go to medicine. As soon as you feel a tingle on your lip, apply it immediately. Avoid kisssing and sharing cups during breakouts. 

It isn’t all that life ending. Even though it feels like you’ve been tainted and everyone will think you’re a diseased leper.  Trust me, most people have it and no one really cares. Just keep your lips moisturized and healthy and breakouts should be minimal."

OP didn’t even know bro had come out to dad, had to find out from dad later. Bro had already left and OP couldn’t get in touch with him for days. When they finally talked, OP asked why bro didn’t tell him about being gay first. Bro said he wanted to stick it to dad for being a homophobic jerk. 

Bro doesn’t come back into OP’s life until there is money involved. My guess is that if the bro gets any money from OP, they will be gone again. There is no relationship to cultivate here. Bro has resentment from having to be raised by a homophobe and OP has resentment for bro not wanting to at least keep in touch."
