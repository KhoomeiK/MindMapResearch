spikes,ffd2h8h,t3_esyj93,1579812114.0,"24 lands seems like way too few, especially with how color intensive this list is. I'd go up to at least 25 but and wonder if 26is probably what this deck wants.

todayilearned,ff7cbnv,t1_ff537pj,1579646229.0,I think you're assuming we're saying that these people *want* to go to jail but that's not necessarily what's being discussed.

todayilearned,ff3mclo,t1_ff3hlas,1579544120.0,"That's just not true though...very few actually *like* jail but there is a very large subset of people that look at it as not a very big deal. I work at an inpatient substance use treatment center with a large percentage being medicaid clients and many of them just sort of  understand that it comes with the territory.

That doesn't mean that they dont try to avoid it if they can of course."
magicTCG,fezzij1,t1_fezdbhs,1579463561.0,Planeswalker decks are hardly part of the set but I guess technically your correct. They're designed to never see play in constructed and obviously cant be played in draft so they're part of the set in name only.
magicTCG,fezaj19,t1_feypf9p,1579455366.0,And to be fair...good mana rocks from the first few years of magic have a general tendency to be expensive.

You're crafting quite the straw man there in assuming that the above statement means I'm saying ""all women are fuckdolls"". If anything you're argument is minimizing the agency of women because you're essentially saying that they cant make a choice without it being influenced by the ""big powerful man"" in front of them(why are you assuming it's the man in power anyway?)

Edit: also your original statement didnt say anything about the person being directly under the person in power."

I usually come here to have a laugh at the nonsense or try to inject some reason only to get downvoted. As a huge fan of the game, this sub is hardly representative of me or my views towards it. I can't be the only one."

ModernMagic,fe8t9iz,t1_fe8ft3g,1578930589.0,Make it target and you have a possible card. Who wants a card that literally cant be interacted with outside of discard in magic?

magicTCG,fdhbupg,t1_fdh4ucb,1578419596.0,"Control decks are non existent because they would get run over by aggro. The amount of built in card advantage that agressive decks in current standard have means theres no way to keep answering everything.
