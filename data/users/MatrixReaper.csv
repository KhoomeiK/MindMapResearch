On my way in, I see an elderly lady gets out of her truck and I hold the entrance to the restaurant for her. She thanks me and praises me, saying that “my mom raised me right” and “not many people do that nowadays.” I smiled awkwardly and said thanks. She then tells me to get in front of her in line, which I reluctantly do. After a few seconds, I went to tell her thank you and she disappeared. 

Like, out of thin air disappeared. She wasn’t behind me at all. Looked all over the store from where I was standing and she wasn’t around. I was about to start asking people but decided not to.

Told me dad the story and, frankly, he’s the only person who believes me. So this means 1. I am schizophrenic or was EXTREMELY TIRED as I was working closing. 2. She was an angel."

Last year I changed my PSN name to Kachienkov. I saw the date on how long I kept the name. I had the name for 10 years. I had a weird flurry of memories from games I played on the PS3. Infamous 1 and 2, COD: BO1 and MW3, The Orange Box, Bioshock:Infinite, and a lot others. It was good to go back."
