It seems to be discussing how men take from men. There's a top comment in there right now about wearing dresses when it's hot.

A story for my own part which I think describes what that sub is about:

I'm going to have a baby in a few weeks and the hospital may not let me stay with my partner or child if they have to stay overnight. It appears that a historical lack of demand of fathers to be equal in the parenting process has resulted in an infrastructure and set of rules that aren't adequate for a generation of men who actually want to be present and equal in the parenting. This is a problem caused by decades of gender roles being so heavily defined by the man not wanting to be a part of the early parenting."

ukpolitics,ffbn0c7,t1_ffbltqi,1579773497.0,"You said that fiscal responsibility had not been implemented ten years before. This is implying that this was the cause of the economic downturn. Now you're saying it was because the private sector couldn't complete with the public sector. 

 In reality, the fiscal spending of the UK was perfectly sustainable and continues to remain perfectly sustainable. What **actually** happened was that the banks were deregulated and they were allowed to hand out credit beyond the collateral that they held which created a dam that was waiting to burst. They didn't need to keep selling subprime mortgages but they did because in the free market only one thing matters: getting as much wealth into the pockets of shareholders as quickly as possible. 

 The idea that a government must always run a surplus is complete and utter nonsense predicated on the idea that a government spending is the same as a balance sheet. Suggesting Venezuela as an equivalent is disingenuous and I hope you're aware of that: their credit rating has sat somewhere in the BB region in recent years and was recently cut. We're also not advocating for a full command economy, just government spending to help the poorest in society and to correct market inefficiencies in natural monopolies. These things can be shown to be a net positive to economic growth - especially putting money into the hands of the poorest.

We live in FPTP. This system creates a 'vote for the lesser evil' scenario. I will always vote against the worst option - the Tories - and this means I will vote Lib Dem if I have to. Personally, I consider myself a socialist and would rather a socialist be within government but the reality is that I have to vote for whatever will be the *least* harmful rather than the *best good*.

And just because we didn't follow a centrist program under Corbyn doesn't make us tribal - it meant that within the democracy of the party, a left wing candidate was chosen and some chose to leave as the party's return to the left didn't go down well.

ukpolitics,fdzm7qb,t1_fdxw8cu,1578791608.0,"I stand by the inability to have a party draw hard lines on Brexit was a major reason why the vote shares were so different. Labour contains people of both stripes and losing the vote of either tips the party into a terrible position.

As we saw, losing leavers meant losing the north but losing remainers was losing the bulk. The compromise of a second ref just didn't cut it but I still fail to see how there could have been another policy with a party that was so split; Brexit wasn't a plan of Labour, it was drawn up by the Tories and that side of the spectrum and Labour had to be dragged into an argument that it never wanted to have.

As for Corbyn's leadership, I stand by it is no where near as bad as people claim it was. It was a position that I think any one fails to look strong in when you can't pick sides on a decisive issue like Brexit. From there, it sprialled into looking weak on all issues - things like Corbyn supporting the IRA was just total bullshit that spread through misinformation about his *lifelong* commitment to the anti-war movement. Once people had made up their minds that he was unelectable, it was self-fulfilling and he was unelectable. I suppose my opinion should be taken with a view of uncertainty since I will stand by the Corbyn platform as fitting my ideological view for government fairly closely.

But a lot of this also suggests that this idea that Labour won't be electable in five years is to be taken with some salt. If Labour put someone to the top of the party that doesn't have the baggage around them through years of being on the fringe of a party and Brexit goes as terribly as it should, Labour are perfectly electable on a left wing platform. Brexit will no longer be an issue itself since people will not be calling in large enough numbers to rejoin the EU for it to be a serious policy position for Labour to take and it should therefore be 'over'.

ukpolitics,fdlbz4c,t1_fdl1oyb,1578520771.0,"My lord, you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Drugs and sex work can absolutely stimulate an economy. What do you think pub trade does? Just because you consider it an immoral good, doesn't mean consumption can't stimulate an economy and it doesn't mean it can't be produced by your local family pub, see? Sex work is also pointlessly illegal but that's a whole other thing - got any stats on that poor people are even more likely to use sex workers? 

The multiplier effect is absolutely true and can be shown to be true through plenty of real world examples.  It's also stronger an effect through consumption than it is through investment. 

Besides, there's probably a fucking reason why poorer people turn to drink quicker than richer people and that's because their lives relatively suck and so they look for an escape.

And you are not at all accounting for lag in the change to employment figures. Labour rates are not fluid and it's not easy to suddenly increase or decrease the amount of labour being used. This gives time for the multiplier effect to work and to facilitate demand for goods and therefore labour.

You're being disingenuous to suddenly say we should whack up minimum wage to those figures. This is **not** what is being a suggest, we're suggesting raising minimum wage at manageable increments. You can literally go look at figures from when Labour introduced minimum wage to prove that it doesn't not create less jobs.

You need to understand that an economy is incredibly complex and some areas of an economy, if changed or regulated, can change other parts of an economy.

And 'us Socialists' are arguing that there's a decrease in the required labour to operate capital and that's **why** capital must be more fairly shared because its output will only go to those with the capital who need less and less labour.

Where on earth do you get your information from? You clearly have no idea about **basic** economic theory, I'm not talking fucking Socialist shit here, I'm talking genuine, middle of the road, consensus economics backed by genuine statistics in both the real world and in complex models.

But forget it, I'm not even going to bother any further with someone who accuses the poor of being immoral by the virtue of their actions which, as you state, correlate with being poor. That's not bloody magic. Make people less poor, reduce rates of drug *abuse*. Then I suppose you've likely never looked into sensible drug policy either given your spouting of absolute nonsense."
ukpolitics,fdktnqp,t1_fdkpa8w,1578510921.0,"Supply and demand is more complicated than looking at a single market. Effects in one market are felt in other markets - you can regulate and change one market so that it has a net positive effect on another.

An important aspect before anything else is understanding two key things: marginal propensity to spend and the multiplier effect.

The marginal propensity to spend says that the chance that someone spends when given an increase in income is non-linearly correlated with income. E.g. Give a homeless person a pound, they'll spend it straight away but give you or I a pound and we'll stick in our pockets. Now expand that to minimum wage vs national average vs high income.

The multiplier effect is where a given amount, say x, spent in an economy actually results in GDP growing by M where M > x. This is because when you spend, the money you spend can be spent **again**, the faster the money moves around the economy (the velocity), the larger M is in a given period. 

From this, we can say that spending is good. We can also say that those most likely to spend are the poorest. Ergo, an increase in minimum wage has a larger effect on the economy than the initial increase.

Increases in spending increases demand for goods and services, this means that supply will increase to meet that demand. When supply of a good increases, the demand for capital and labour increases - this further increases wages and reduces unemployment. So increases wages might appear to show a negative on the balance sheet as costs increase but it can increase the revenue side of the balance sheet as the workers demand more of the product that they are creating.

The above effects are similar to why quantitative easing works despite inflation (if done right) and is also why there's drops in VAT during times of downturn despite that seemingly decreasing tax revenue - because the overall effect of increased demand may be greater than the drop in tax itself. Especially since VAT is a regressive tax.

It's also the same reason trickle down economics doesn't work, when you decrease tax of the richest, they are less likely to spend the new disposable income they have than if you were to tax it and put it into the pockets of the poorest who are likely to spend it."
ukpolitics,fdklklc,t1_fdki9a8,1578506065.0,"Command vs free market economics are both perfectly explainable. The reality is that the free market doesn't serve people equally and rarely works since markets do not have the complete competition required. 

I actually studied economics at uni so whilst I am **certainly** no expert, I know enough to suggest why your claims about minimum wage are total and utter bullshit that are easily disproved. Literally Economics of Labour 101.

I support socialism in part because of an unsustainable rise of automation which eliminates the L part of output. If all the capital is owned by only a few actors with no drive to ensure the poorest in society are protected, society fails. I am **not** calling for overthrows of government but a gradual move towards a socialist society (such as the Fabion society intends). 

Reaching instantly for an instance of socialism that is not working is no different from me reaching for any number of developing world countries where capitalism is totally failing.

They will almost always spend the money and, as a result of the multiplier effect, increase consumption at a rate faster than savings would increase investment through the employer retaining the money or paying it to someone who already earns more, this in turn creates more demand for labour.

You can go even further to suggest that further increases in demand for labour pushes the cost of labour up (and therefore wages)."

The market is made up of schools as employers (demand side) and teachers as employees (supply side).

If a bloc of agents work together or an agent is particularly large, then they have increased market control and they change the equilibrium point for pay and benefits through their actions. 

In the case of teachers, they have a very, very large employer and a range of smaller employers. In order to offset the size of the employer and their market power, teachers unionised and then collectively bargained for their pay. This sets the minimum pay a teacher in this country can get in **both** the private and public markets since anyone in the private market earning less would simply move to the public market - the private and public market are therefore competing and comprise one singular, large market.

It is possible to describe then as distinct markets but they're not in reality because of the ease at which you can move between the two."
