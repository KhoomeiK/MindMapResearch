And with some luck, she'll think about getting help once independent people confirm Johnny's version."
videos,fgs6i3r,t1_fgs0o2y,1581073947.0,"That's an important detail, I think. She sounds like a classic borderline personality who constantly oscillates between dependence on the partner and the fear of being dominated (and finally abandoned) by the partner. This cycle only works via ""closeness"". Keeping the other person in the conflict until you're satisfied with the new ""balance of power"" you created. Then you begin building them up again, until they become too powerful in your head. 

So it was right to avoid this. You can't win an ""argument"" with such a person anyway. She needs help.  

Well done, Johnny."
videos,fgs63h9,t1_fgs0jfx,1581073408.0,"I agree. But I fear she'll do it to her next partner anyway. 

Don't get me wrong, I am far from being an expert - just a former victim. But the way she subtly put him under pressure, the way she remembers things (very instinctively, very vaguely --> ""I thought I was gonna die"" vs. his ""You threw object XY at my nose"") ... and the way she seeks the verbal conflict and tries to keep him in that conflict... that feels like a borderline personality to me (Borderliners often seek closeness in conflict, only to push their partner away and then comfort him or her again. Like a constant pendulum movement). Unfortunately no judge can cure something like that. Only a doctor. 

Nevertheless, it often takes a warning shot to realize that you need help. So maybe a court can wake her up in some way."
videos,fgrybh7,t3_f05a17,1581062465.0,"Man, above all else: This is fucking heartbreaking. 

Johnny sounds exhausted and still cares about her well-being. She, on the other hand, puts pressure on him, gaslights him. Anyone who's been in an abusive relationship knows that type of conversation all too well. It gives me goosebumps. 

Poor guy."
todayilearned,fgiltri,t1_fgfw613,1580825303.0,"Actually, towards the end of the war the Nazis hurried to carry out as many murders on political ""rivals"" as possible, with Anne Frank, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and many many priests, SPD politicians and former unionists among the victims.

In most cases there were a few days, sometimes only hours, between ""sentencing"" and execution."

I have nothing but love for this man."

Well, here I am, living in cologne for 8 years now. It's absolutely great and full of lovely people.
