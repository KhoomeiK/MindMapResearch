WTF,fdoso2n,t1_fdom2n8,1578611994.0,"I dunno they look pretty real to me. I'm going to go with the lack of uniformity in color and shape. I just like that it says ""Happy Moments"" on the bottom there."
WTF,fdorb4z,t1_fdopqq2,1578611139.0,really? in 25 years? Man I have seen so much sick shit. This was nothing more than watching some gay porn.

I know most people don't do this, but she did not demonstrate dexterity in that finger. I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure she has either extremely limited dexterity or none at all in that finger. Most people with extra digits do not have mobility in those digits."
WTF,fdmzvxl,t1_fdmcg55,1578572842.0,"Would you like me to show you a picture of  my index and middle fingers crossed and both bent? Because I can very much bend both fingers while crossed.

She was showing dexterity of her fingers, why else would she skip the first one?"
WTF,fdk1hfv,t3_elrd1x,1578493715.0,The first finger doesn't bend.

videos,fdgrxgx,t1_fdfvbxm,1578406764.0,How many ex-girl/friends  have you put into porn?
WTF,fdgq1o5,t3_ekjsiu,1578405310.0,"This is cool, but doesn't belong in this sub at all. I think our mods have vanished."

news,fde1vba,t1_fdcuihj,1578329302.0,What about all the poisoning that was happening to tourists there about a year ago?
AskReddit,fdchwuj,t1_fdcgtq4,1578275316.0,I highly doubt it.
AskReddit,fdchvdy,t1_fdcgotj,1578275287.0,THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING MY PAIN!
AskReddit,fdchuc3,t1_fdcg0kg,1578275267.0,"Energy spent with keeping the kid(s) busy is what I'm talking to, not bed time issues."
AskReddit,fdchs6i,t1_fdcfgq9,1578275224.0,"More going for having the energy at the end of the day. Not so much about the nosiness of the kid(s). Especially with young ones, it takes a lot out of you. I'm curious how couples do it, if at all, that often."
WTF,fcyfj1w,t1_fcyczp0,1578079328.0,Actually it looks quite healthy.
WTF,fcyfc0r,t3_ejilf7,1578079214.0,I would call that several attempts actually.

technology,fcxnbmp,t1_fcxmcud,1578067027.0,"Agree with this point. Technical debt will accumulate as the code base grows. It is not a matter or responsibility to prevent it, it is unavoidable. Refactoring is something that should happen with lengthy sprints of new feature code. One nice-to-have, if the sprint allows for it, is to set one day towards the end of the sprint for technical debt and or refactoring after bug fixing."
science,fcug2f7,t1_fcud67m,1577980105.0,"He never said felt like, he said he'd argue that.. "" I'd argue wait until at least 25 ""

Also the brain stops developing at 25.. so it's an important point."
science,fcu9zio,t1_fcu9sm1,1577976072.0,"That's not exactly how reddit comments work. Not all comments apply to the root topic, opinions and discussions branch off of those and become new sub topics for discussion.  If I'm wrong, sorry, I've been doing reddit wrong for 9 years.."
science,fcu9k9q,t1_fcu7dfu,1577975769.0,Actually we're discussing a comment which is stating that it's better to wait until after 25 years.
science,fcu6w7x,t1_fcu6c3x,1577973994.0,In some regards they both go hand in hand.

WTF,fco5e6t,t1_fco3x9x,1577824404.0,"dude, it's soft for WTF, that's all i'm saying. I've been subbed since like 2011 and it used to be great. Every so often it used to get a ""bringing WTF back to it's roots post"" with something that would probably make most new subscribers sick to their stomach. I like browsing fucked up shit and since /r/watchpeopledie and others got banned there aren't many places for gore and deformities and serious WTF-ness. I don't think I'm a sick person, I've just been so desensitized. And with all the happy bottles of sunshine in my social media -- I need something a little negative to balance it out.

And BTW I don't think responses are quality controlled so much, I think it's google a result for you and says the first thing it returns.. or some other Amazon proprietary search algorithm."
WTF,fco466n,t1_fcmns88,1577823743.0,People don't lose this ability to procreate because of looks. There are other nose-less or blind people who will happily fuck him.

WTF,fco355g,t1_fco1gvs,1577823184.0,because this sub has gotten so SOFT.
IAmA,fco1n4c,t1_fco160t,1577822451.0,"Interesting, and it makes sense that other senses would fill in (this mesh) to paint a picture of reality to the brain. There are other fringe science-y things that could point to a soul, something like remote viewing."
WTF,fco0qt8,t1_fco0cen,1577822009.0,Haha I thought you made a typo. The tires\* are probably pretty durable to high heat on emergency vehicles.
IAmA,fco0hpw,t1_fco06xx,1577821876.0,"I know you were making a joke, I was asking an honest question. Sure quite a few different psychedelics will get you into an OBE, but the science behind it is really not fully understood. It makes one question many things about life and consciousness."
WTF,fcnzfy5,t1_fcnx8w0,1577821356.0,"The tired? I imagine many elderly and disabled people if not transported by help, will fall victims to the fire."
IAmA,fcnyxi5,t1_fcnoh7z,1577821110.0,"Well there are a few documented cases of such out of body experiences. In fact few studies have been done using EMF and the brain to induce this type of occurrence. It really makes you think about the 'soul' and how consciousness is not tied to the body. Very fascinating stuff -- things we haven't been able to really understand, much which deserves more attention."
WTF,fcnq0ww,t1_fcmikpy,1577816269.0,that's the point. Are you one of those contributors who only posts mildly wtf imagery?
