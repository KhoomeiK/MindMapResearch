AskReddit,fejydnc,t1_fegff52,1579188659.0,Us trans people aren't cisphobic since we hate judging people by their gender identity anyway. We're just using satire to show cis people how bullshit their transphobic opinions are.

selfhelp,fe9sir6,t3_eo6d4n,1578941080.0,"So I’ve been meditating and what all the teachers universally say is that you are not your identities. If your sense of self worth comes from being smart, you will falter in front of difficulty. If your sense of identity revolves around wanting to become a physicist, you will lose all hope when you can’t be a physicist anymore for a million possible reasons. 

I second the other comment that you can revive your passion. But what I think might be the underlying issue is that your self identity and self worth are entirely dependent on you becoming a great physicist. 

You can’t fully control whether you become a physicist. Even if you do become one, you can’t fully control the grants you will get, and you will never know if all of your papers later turn out to be false. 

So stop basing your identity and self worth on something that you can’t control and start focusing on what you can: learning more about physics right now, today. Do that every day and you may become a physicist. Maybe even a good one. But you may not, and that’s okay."
GetStudying,fe8wnjo,t1_fe49itu,1578931903.0,"Teach to a doll, your mom while she's pretending to listen to you. It doesn't matter. In IB HL Biology I'd make an outline of the entire two-year curriculum which kind of acts like the front page of flash cards. The difference is that I never made the back side of flash cards; it's a waste of time. I taught the whole curriculum to thin air many a times and this helped me retain enough information to take biology courses in university."

* Schedule every minute of the day, including rest and entertainment. 
* Find places in campus that you won't be distracted - especially by peers - for studying during the day; have fun during the evenings. No, your dorm isn't a study room. 
* Write essays in three days: research, draft, edit. 
* Active recall trumps passive review for both understanding concepts and memorization. This means explaining out loud, without looking at notes, everything that you need to know. 
* Passive methods like highlighting or re-reading textbook and notes are complete waste of time. 
* Set actionable study goals. e.g. ""I will do active recall on chapter 3 of organic chemistry from 9 am to 10 am tomorrow at this library"" instead of vaguely stating ""I will study (never use the word ""study"") tomorrow."" Since active recall is efficient but very mentally taxing, plan short study sessions with breaks in-between. 
* For skill-based courses like math and physics, solving questions that are similar to exam questions is the most efficient active form of learning. 

EDIT: Previous comment got removed. I suggest checking out Cal Newport's old blog archives."

Even if you have reasons to believe you’re not depressed, I’d still suggest you talk to a professional to exclude it from possible root causes of your demotivation. It’s also possible you are persistently depressed, which is a lower level of depression that persists longer instead of being episodic like major depression."

getdisciplined,fd5fop1,t1_fczls71,1578177186.0,"Even more than that, I recently picked up a strategy from Atomic Habits to constantly ask myself, “what would the ideal me do *right now*?” This strategy has worked wonders for me, because I stopped delegating self-improvement to my future self. Instead, I started imagining that there’s this ideal self that’s always advising me from over my shoulders *right now* like a mentor or a best friend.

Example: “What would my ideal self do right now?”

“She would confront her social anxiety and go to that social event regardless of her fears.”"

If Tweeter is important for work, treat is as work and keep it as work. As for Instagram, you can delete the app and use a desktop app to upload photos if you must insist on keeping it in your life. However, as someone who’s quit IG with zero regrets, I recommend getting rid of it entirely."

getdisciplined,fd59xxp,t3_ek1xp3,1578175539.0,"I recently learned to respect sleep a lot, and oh boy has it improved my mood, energy levels, and makes depression a lot easier to manage. I’ve slept from 9 to 6 (9 hours allow for some buffer time and still get 8+ hours of sleep) for a month now with a few days of slip offs. 

The biggest thing is to respect sleep a lot. I’ll say no to evening appointments. I turn off all digital devices at 8 pm and grab a paper book. I tone down my lights (except a reading lamp) and just chill for an hour, reading, and then fall asleep easily. The few days I slipped last month, I always didn’t turn off my devices. 

Other things I did: I set a lot of alarms on my phone AND got a physical alarm clock. Makes it impossible to not hear it at 6 am. I have a simple morning routine so that I don’t think about what to do after getting up, it’s almost muscle memory. I walk a lot more. I’ve been walking for at least an hour every day, which means I’m tired and ready to sleep.

Last thing is a mindset change. I used to think all the time, “I’ll improve myself tomorrow.” I’ve picked up a tip to think instead, “what would the ideal version of me do RIGHT NOW?” And I know that she would go to bed at 9, so I go to bed at 9 so as not to disappoint my *current* self."
