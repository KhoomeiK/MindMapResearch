BirdsArentReal,feucays,t3_eqmcd3,1579385226.0,Listen very carefully: they are going to take you.
menwritingwomen,feu2475,t1_fetvo2g,1579382380.0,I wouldn’t make assumptions about people like that. I’m ugly as sin and visibly disabled. I also grew up poor. I totally get having a grudge about these things as you grow up but I also have gotten to a point of self acceptance that I don’t see these things as negative at all. I don’t think everyone who grows up like that is required to be bitter about it.
menwritingwomen,fesg2hs,t1_fesesjd,1579364813.0,But it also assumes that little girls will 100% carry around a grudge for being “ugly” as a kid as if that’s what matters when you’re magical. Idk something still feels shitty. Maybe I’m reading too far.

todayilearned,fd6pxs4,t1_fd6oj6d,1578194291.0,"Clearly your treatment has gone well and I congratulate you on that. I never said him running away was treatment but that it might be because his treatment hasn’t progressed far enough. But like you said, I haven’t experienced this. Regardless, I’m tapping out. Have a good one!"
todayilearned,fd6ab5u,t1_fd6660l,1578187929.0,Pretty condescending of you to act like it’s such a quick and easy thing to treat. I teach students with OCD. It’s hell for them. You don’t know what types of treatment this guy might already be in.

insanepeoplefacebook,fczdm69,t1_fcz7v5t,1578098827.0,"So the power you (and I) hold is in the way society perceives you versus a black person. You have the privilege of not being as likely to be followed in a store. You have the privilege of being considered more “hirable.” You have the privilege of not having your personal flaws attributed to your race. That’s what’s meant by the term “whites privilege.” 
Of course, many other white people may have more privilege than you, but you still hold some power that black people don’t."
insanepeoplefacebook,fczasc0,t3_ejodtl,1578097156.0,What’s insane about this? I’ve heard stories of women donating their breast milk after losing a baby and a lot of mothers are extremely grateful.
insanepeoplefacebook,fcypqrj,t1_fcym8tb,1578084583.0,I feel like that’s more insane. An infant can’t express a desire for a piercing. At least a 10 year old can.
insaneparents,fcy9ycw,t3_ejjj5q,1578076863.0,"Yeah what conversations are you having with your older siblings? Like venting about your parents?
Edit: I’m not saying this justified your parents. The opposite actually. I’d get it in this case."

aww,fbygzbz,t1_fby9o8p,1577216649.0,"I think dogs can certainly understand their importance. I have a service dog. He’s a Bernese Mountain Dog and he’s not independently very bright. But he’s well trained and emotionally intelligent. One task he does for me is interrupting when I scratch my arms or legs too much. He will paw to stop me. And if I ignore him and keep scratching, he gets very upset and will do whatever it takes to stop me. I only ever taught him to stop me when I scratch. He realized the reason and picked up the rest."
