dogs,ff6v7km,t3_erz4wm,1579635562.0,"Orion (my oversize Pom due to Spitz recessives), goes out first thing.  Then he has to check out the neighborhood at about 11 AM, again at 4-5 PM, and at 9 PM before bedtime. He KNOWS the time on the DVR and will insist that I get ready to go out at 8:50 PM.

No potty in the house and he's 9.  I guess it depends on the dog."

dogs,fdskp3q,t3_en04ou,1578704407.0,"Well, I used to live to a nice family that had a 2-year-old german shep dog.  My service dog, Orion, and the shep would run up and down the fence all the time.  But there was an old gate in the fence, so with their permission, I opened it one day.

Presto! Both dogs perfectly calm played with no issues.  I used to play fetch with the two of them.  When one was out he'd go to the other's door and knock to see if his friend could come out.  For the few days I was nervous and supervised, but they got along so well that everything was cool.  During parties, both dogs were invited.  You just have to confirm by close supervision that that is what they want."
dogs,fcooec6,t3_ei3g81,1577837323.0,"Well, my PTSD dog, Orion, turns 9 on the 2nd of January.  He picked me out of the litter when he was 2 DAYS old, and is a purebred Pomeranian from responsible in-home breeders. They allowed me two hours per day with him even while his eyes were closed. By 5 days, he knew his name and came when called,  By 10 days I had taught hin sit, stay, and shake.  We started the SA training early and he can not wait to get ready to go to work when his vest magically appears.  To this day we LOVE Dairy Queen, Dog Parks, and long walks together in all conditions except.  He is also Off-Leash licensed, and we have flown coast to coast together, taken Amtrak from Chicago to Seattle and back, and go everywhere together.  I am in a wheelchair now and he adapted to that just perfectly.  Never messes, but has a habit of washing his face in the water dish which means fresh water 3 times per day, lol.  HE decides when he wants to go out to play fetch (brings her ball-of-the-day to me and sets it net to me and gives a loud sneeze for my attention.

I don't know what I would do without my puppers."
