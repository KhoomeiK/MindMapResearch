I know the economy is good, unemployment is low, but it almost feels like people are just staying put, for various reasons.  Lots of turmoil, and the last thing anyone wants right now is a new job that could be worse.  I also think the demand for IT workers, just the sheer number the market wants, continues to increase.  This shortage will continue, and I think MSPs would be smart to go back to pipelining people like big companies do with interns from local universities.  I know this isn't instant, but I think if we, the people operating in the industry, want to deal with this issue that isn't going away, we need to keep looking at ways to increase the number of candidates available.

You can increase salary, but it takes time for the market to adjust and increase salaries, and that doesn't solve the shortage issue."

High quality pedals will do more for your times and comfort than anything else, they should be the first upgrade, and it's generally a reasonable upgrade even if you go mid to high end, compared to DD wheels and such.

I think after that, once you feel like you want more again, you go for either a high end Thrustmaster base or a Fanatec belt driven wheel base.  If your budget is bigger, you can go for a direct drive.  If you don't mind a lot of tinkering and random cables hanging off, you can go the DD kit route."

hsp,feyuf2r,t3_eqsrb0,1579450651.0,"I'm just guessing, but most of this stuff is probably just a manifestation of the things that people were hard on us about when we were younger.  For me, it was a family that didn't tolerate mistakes, so for me, it was a deep seated desire to never admit fault, or that I made a mistake.  It caused me, like my father, to have an excuse or answer for everything.  It has taken me a good number of years of my adult life to really feel like I'm on top of it, but it's been a work in progress for all the years I've been aware of it, which was probably 25-42?"
kayakfishing,fetm2fl,t3_eqjqul,1579376800.0,"I can relate a bit.  I live in the Raleigh, NC area and am not a morning person.  If there is a topwater bite anywhere around here, it's in the AM, because I've had no luck at any of the big lakes or a lot of the smaller ones with topwater at sunset.  I never hear stuff hitting the top around here either.  You see tons of bugs on the water surface, and nothing goes after them, so it doesn't really match up with what you see in videos of places like Florida."

My guess is they tested the ghost car method and it was easily abusable by people using it selectively.  I know the idea of a network cut button seems extreme, but think about our hobby and how some people get around competition.  Look at the thousands of dollars spent on rigs, and I think you have to look at all ways a system can be abused."

I'm a huge HAM fan, and it's funny because I used to hate Marc Marquez, but damn, he's one of the greatest of all time, and had a hell of a year.  Also,  his further honing of his ability to ""save"" a bike after it has fallen over, is something that is redefining the sport."
