Parenting,fffsg2c,t3_et5db6,1579890802.0,Do yourself a favor and go the nuclear route. Call up your pediatrician's nurse line and tell them you've been battling an infestation. You've tried the conventional methods and it's not hacking it. They will call in a prescription grade shampoo you can pick up at the pharmacy. We did this after battling for a month and it worked so well.

relationship_advice,ffci7qe,t3_esutbr,1579800009.0,"This is so messed up on so many levels. He says since you dont make the money you dont get a say in this? How about the fact that you're half of the parenting team and you *most certainly do* get a say because this affects your child. What if he has to care for the boy at any point without you? Are you expected to never leave the child in his care?

On another note, if he wants to go down that road and play the ""I make the money I'm the man of the house"" bull line then tell him to start paying for childcare and you will go back to work. What will he say then?

Aside from my outrage at the absolute ridiculousness and narcissism of this man, this is the language of the addict. Its finding every possible way to excuse his use, his behavior, and the subjugation of your dissent. This is where you have to put *your* foot down. He goes into rehab or you take the kid and go. Ultimatums aren't healthy, but they aren't used in healthy relationships. And this is certainly not one. 

Think of this, you take your child out in public and he smells like that stuff. Or think about when he learns to speak! That filter that he shouldn't talk about certain things doesnt engage for several more years. And someone calls CPS. Kids have been taken away for so much less and in a state where it's not legal, those consequences will be harsh. 

You have to be proactive about this and get ahead of it. You cant bury your head in the sand and hope shit doesnt hit the fan. This is no longer about you and not wanting to deal with your partners shitty behavior. This is about your son and his well being."

UpliftingNews,ff8w8y6,t1_ff8pu0z,1579698169.0,"While I get that the anti-hunting sentiment is good, it's not practical. Humans have drastically changed the way nature flows and balances itself through our land development and modernization. So, it falls back to us to regulate what we threw off in the first place. 

It's like the Smokey Bear Effect. Forest fires used to occur naturally as a way to clear the dead underbrush and make way for new growth. But, obviously this cant occur near populated areas and small forest fires are quickly put out before they can serve their purpose. This leads to larger, uncontrolled fires later. So we have to do control burns to keep the damage at a minimum. 

Oh and dont even get me started on the feral pigs down here. They are downright vicious. Those bad boys can grow massive, have lots of piglets, and will gore you without a second thought. They aren't good for the land either. So, the more tags the better!"

So in order to accomplish this, you need a plan. Do *you* want to go back to work? *Can* he handle all three kids and their schedules while maintaining the house?

He needs to take off for 2 weeks and handle your routine: TO YOUR STANDARDS WITHOUT HELP.

If he can do this and still wants to jump then proceed. 

Then he needs to plan a soft entry. You need to go back to school and he needs to pick up the slack. Since it's so much *fun* for him, this shouldn't be an issue. When you have completed a program that could land you a job that will yield a livable salary you can transition, but not before. 

Repeat: Do NOT sacrifice your family's stability because housework is more ""fun"" for him than his job."

TwoXChromosomes,feppi2j,t3_eq9fd6,1579326996.0,"I dislike it as well. ""Female"" should be used when sex/gender is relevant. First female spacewalk, female patient, female attendance numbers...in those examples the being female is important to context. And in each instant it's used as a descriptor. It does not take place as a subject of a sentence. The only example I can think of to get a pass is medical terminology. Even then, ""Female, 50, cardiac case"" is just shortened from ""Patient is a 50 year old female exhibiting cardiac symptoms."" 

Men using ""female"" to replace ""woman"" is dehumanizing and a passive aggressive power play."

Swapping these things over is a lot more streamlined than it used to be.

At my job, it takes a pay cycle to get DD started because of the pre-note. My husband's job started right on cue when they swapped from paper checks to DD.

I wish they had taught me it was okay to say no, and how to do it and not feel such immense guilt afterwards. Women and girls are so often taught, indirectly, that if we cant fix, accommodate, care for, or manage everything thrown at us that somehow we are defective or less savvy as a woman.
