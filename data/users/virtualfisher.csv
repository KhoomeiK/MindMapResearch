They never picked up the poop so it would just get buried under new layers of snow. Come spring the entire place was coated in piles of defrosted dog shit. So gross.

HumansBeingBros,ff8qsn0,t1_ff8h9is,1579692256.0,Statistically Jehovahs witnesses have the lowest household income of any faith group in America. And they actively discourage higher education meaning their kids are more likely to be in situations like this.

atheism,ff85m3q,t3_ery1ay,1579666636.0,"Hell as a fiery eternal pit is metaphorical. Anytime you are away from the presence of God that is it’s own hell. We ask if there’s such a thing as ‘free will’ without considering what we want to be free from / free to do. We hate limitations but without them our potential cannot be focused consistently enough to achieve our best. And with too much choice it becomes impossible to be satisfied with our decisions because of FOMO.

I’m not a Christian. But I think that many issues people end up losing their faith over, are not insurmountable or contradictory enough to justify atheism."
unpopularopinion,ff83xhh,t3_erx2x0,1579665334.0,The Christian church was never like other religions. It was also an empire / the global superpower. And cardinals were literally called ‘princes’. We have de-fanged the beast which is why we can now claim that other religions are more barbaric. But do not forget what the church really was and how much terror it brought upon mankind.

So I named my fear of failure ‘Wylie’ after Wylie coyote’- because he can run through the air and only falls when he realizes and looks down.
