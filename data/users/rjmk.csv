selfimprovement,fed02q7,t1_fecxgy1,1578991956.0,"Because there is constant immediate physical stimulus in his job. 

Part of adhd is a deficiency in executive function. Those tasks that normal people take for granted are difficult for people with ADHD because for some reason their (our) brain doesn't structure information/plans AND execute the same way. Plus all the other noise  and distractions going on on top of that. So when there's immediate things to deal with, it's easy to flow. But when you have to order and accomplish things when you get home, especially doing things that aren't necessarily stimulating, it is much more difficult.

I am a bartender which is a great job for someone with ADHD. There is always something immediate to do, I can juggle a bunch of things at once, etc. It turns my ADHD into a strength. If I was to sit in an office all day on a computer? I can't imagine it. 

That's another reason kids with ADHD love video games. It is constant, immediate stimulus. Homework on the other hand is daunting, impossible, confusing frustrating... You can spend hours going in circles, and when you finally think you're finished your parent/teacher will come along and say you did most of it incorrectly. Not only do you feel bad about yourself because you weren't good enough, but you also feel like you tried- and just like every other time you failed. 

Which would you want to do? The one that makes you feel aweful or the one that atleast can make you feel like you accomplished something, and can tomorrow?

I know OP never mentioned video games, but I think it shows a relavent example of how an ADHD brain behaves. And I'm just sharing my thoughts and experiences, im not a psychologist so take what I say with a grain of salt."

taijiquan,fc6zt2n,t3_egiryx,1577493746.0,"No. 

If you are looking at martial arts, Tai chi is the least efficient and least productive for fitness, energy and self defense. 

There is no cosmological energy that you can channel, the snake oil Tai chi ""masters"" videos of them sending opponents flying with minimal effort is 100% fake. Check out Xi Xiaodong and what is going on in martial arts in China. The Tai chi masters basically use the iron bound respect that the Chinese have for elders or ""masters"" as a shield to hide behind not actually being of any martial art ability. Xi infamously wiped the floor with a tai chi masters using basic mma, and has been shunned in China. 

I love Tai chi. It's relaxing, and the meditative aspects make me feel good for sure. 

But for actual energy, you need to increase endurance. Tai chi does not offer anything in terms of endurance, the flow is not a substitute for running, strength training, ju jitsu, boxing, swimming etc."

If anything pua is the dis/ingenuous one, because honestly pussy isn't worth that much effort. but learning game will help all aspects of your life, and I don't have to rehash the benefits of improving yourself (better career, working out, etc. ) . Game will also help you avoid a 3/4 year aweful relationship waste of time. Models does a good job of explaining this. 

I'd also recommend reading sun tzus art of war, Machiavelli s the prince, book of the five rings, meditations by Marcus aurelious, senecas letters to a stoic (or whatever it's called). Basically read philosophy. It'll help you create a sort of ""Creed"" to live by. Stoicism is honestly one of the best tools most people don't know about. Machiavelli will help you see the world as it is, and obtain the dark triad traits. Asian philosophy is partly pragmatic and partly stoic, and holds up better than Greek philosophy.

seduction,fbwft2i,t1_fbv7c3j,1577148787.0,"I'm kind of not understanding what you mean exactly, so pardon if I mistake it. 

Some people weren't born with that intangible ""thing"" that some guys have that helped them understand how the world works. If that's what you call energy. So they have to learn. It isn't ingenouus/disingenuous/whatever to understand a weakness, set a goal, and work towards it especially when it comes to relationships with people. 

Mark Manson's ""Models"" opened my eyes a bit to the psychology behind where ""game"" comes from. In short, it comes down to childhood developmental experiences and your relationship with your parents, or rather how your parents showed you the world by general example. 

Normally this sounds psuedo psychological especially coming from a guy (the author) with no degree, but I thought about my relationship with my parents through the lens of ""how did they interact with the world, and what did I learn from them about it"". 

So I know I'm not being clear, but for example my father never really behaved in a ""masculine"" way. He was/is a great provider, extremely smart, and is a man, but he was never a ""man's man"" so to speak. He would avoid conflict and discouraged any physical conflict type of behavior. Never taught me to fight, I never saw him stand up for himself all that much, and would see his one or two make friends once or twice a year. He's the guy that pays sticker price for a car. He can afford it yes, but doesn't try to do the very best for himself. He is a super smart  lawyer.... at a nonprofit. It's a fantastically Noble job, but he could have played better cards.

So the difference is A few of my friends dad's would regularly go out with their pack of buddies, drink beer, smoke cigars and talk about women/tell stories of their youth. They showed their sons the power of a male bond with other males. Comroderie. Competition. Working together to get things done. 

The difference in turn led to those friends having a much easier time forming social bonds and exhibiting masculine behaviors that while at the surface might seem unatractive, are VERY attractive to woman as it excited them. 

Then I had friends whose dad's where not present, or parents divorced, etc. They were raised by women, and we're taught how to be men by woman, which is to be closer to a ""white knight""/gentleman/doormat. This showed as they grew up as it was much harder for them to actually know how to get girls to like them, as well as guys. Example: Their dads never taught them how to dress to impress woman, instead woman dressed them to look like their cute little boys. In general, they never were taught to be/pursue attractiveness. Their notion of attractive was in relation to the woman and what they can do for her, more so than the woman to the man and why the man should choose him.

My dad never really taught me any of that, and he was always at work till late at night. When he came home he would drink a six pack and do the crossword every single night (assuming my brother and I weren't in trouble and our homework was done). Most of my parental interactions where with my mother, and she was kinda weird all the time.

So now I'm grown up, have a hard time making male friends as my father never showed me how, I've had to learn through exhaustive and dissapointing trial and error with girls. I've been in multiple friendzones, worse yet I've come to expect it etc etc etc, but honestly it's fine. I'm learning. I read books, subreddits, try to improve mystyle, focus on myself which in turn attracts girls, I mimick male behaviors I've seen previously. 

I've sought to teach myself, because I wanted to make myself a better person- not morally, but as a MAN. And I think that is a pursuit that is in no way false, because it's not just about getting good with girls. It's about ATTRACTING attractive girls/people. And to do that you need to pursue the best possible version of yourself. It's not anyone's fault they're weak with game, but everyone has the ability to improve.
