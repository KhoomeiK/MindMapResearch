depression,fez16rp,t3_eqsxda,1579452952.0,"Well how about think of yourself as an invincible superhero. I take risks, sky dive, cliff jump, throw myself into situations no one else will themselves because I’m not really scared of death. And turned out I kind of started like some stuff. You kind of have a freedom of fear in a sense.... that’s the way I see it. Kinda rad."
Parenting,feyzjb6,t3_eqycrr,1579452415.0,Take a day off and let the nanny do her thing! You taking a step back and regrouping is necessary. None of this makes you a bad mom. No one can function properly on exhaustion. There’s a reason on airplanes you put your mask on first.... otherwise you’re not available to be there. Take care of you!
depression,feyxetv,t3_eqvoyp,1579451605.0,"You can be strong, you can get through this I promise! You may not be motivated but just do it anyway. One option you have a second chance and the other you don’t. I’ve been there, I get it. I’m so glad I lived this life and I promise you will too"
depression,feyvbwe,t3_eqx9o4,1579450978.0,"I’m sorry that must feel so lonely. There had to be some kind of online community or resources of some sort for you. Keep looking! It really helps to talk to other people in similar situations and of course especially a therapist/counselor if you can get access. And you be as sensitive as you are! There’s nothing wrong with feeling emotions.
  Maybe find some books that will help navigate and understand the emotions so you can work through them. Hope support finds you! In the mean time stay as strong as you can and if you feel something, you feel it. Don’t let people shame you."

depression,feyhcan,t1_fexrz2o,1579445573.0,"I met a woman who had a death sentence at 54, I was doing her hair because she couldn’t lift her arms and I was having a particularly bad depression day where I didn’t know how I could possibly work. Told her she put my problems in perspective. She turned around and grabbed my arm and said “don’t ever weigh other people’s problems, the emotion hits us all strongly no matter why it’s there. Your feelings are real and you’re allowed to feel.” She passed away weeks later. She was a harsh reality. That was ten years ago and I’m so thankful she inspired me to be a better understanding person. Long story long; even when it sucks, it’s a purposeful life and can be worth so much"
depression,fey74n9,t3_equ4u8,1579441623.0,"I’m right there with you. Sucks when you sink back in because at some point you probably felt like you were moving forward and the funks (that’s what I like to use... gives it less power) were a thing of the past.

I’m there right now too. I know whet will make me feel better but the motivation is just not there. And the “why even try?” Questions are running circles in my brain. So lost is pretty damn accurate.

But at least it seems like we both know it’ll come back eventually.... hang in there"
depression,fey4yha,t3_eqqxoo,1579440842.0,"It’s crazy how bleak things can seem until they aren’t. In a matter of one day something can happen that makes you extremely important that even you notice it. I remind myself of that every time I hit my slumps where your light feels so dim and distant. 

And I’m feelin it today as well. You aren’t alone. 

Today might not be our day, tomorrow will probably be shitty too, but we got this!! There always seems to be a turn around"
depression,fey0pls,t3_equ5g2,1579439215.0,"I’m the same! I used to just freeze an wonder what was wrong with me but I realized as an emotional empath there were several things that happened to my mind when others express strong emotions
1) “holy sh*t I thought I was the only emotional one” (hence the shock)
2) because you understand emotions and IMO healthily express them, you take a second to process and understand their true emotion and relate to it which also takes an awkward pause
3) you subconsciously know when you’re emotional you need a certain response and care enough to be at a loss of what to do

Once I’ve realized that I could consciously react instead of totally going mute and why I would get so stone cold is I empathetically knew when I have a heavy emotion I need someone level headed to know how to handle it. And I believe that’s what your probably trying to do.

So now I just ask “do you want to cry, do you want me to just stfu and hug you or make you laugh? Take you somewhere safe where you can talk it out? Etc?” Just ask what they need. Because you understand so you’ll be the person that helps the most

Sociopaths know how to manipulate and conform btw.... so you’re far from that ;)"
depression,fexuxuj,t3_eqpqzk,1579436902.0,"It helps me a LOT. It pretty much goes hand in hand for me. My issue in the past with depression/exercise is people telling you you “should be” getting out of bed and coming to the gym/yoga class/ blah blah. That just made me sink further in my bed and call myself a loser because I wasn’t doing it and therefore making it 10x harder to get out of bed because I was even more depressed... ya’ll get it..the vicious cycle...
My key was finding something I liked to do that was mine. Running was my way of blasting music, getting outdoors and tuning out the world. I just zone into it and the release is everything! It’s no cure by far. But even if I walked a half mile I’m just proud of myself for getting out of bed and I focus on that. And if the motivation hits after some endorphins start flowing and what ever mood I’m in kicks in I just go...
   I know people do this with swimming, solo sports etc. gyms are not the answer. Too many comparisons, people staring, douchey trainers etc. Find what inspires you!"
depression,fexu5r4,t1_fexiubz,1579436286.0,Get out of the douche gyms and find something you could possibly like as far as an active solo sport? I know I get to comparing and feeling failure all the time. I just put my headphones on and find a trail and mentally disappear.
