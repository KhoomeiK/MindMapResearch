Incredibly wrong. The Senate is the way smaller states are incentivized to participate. The electoral college was designed to give slave states with smaller voting populations more weight based on their total population so they would join and stay in the Union. It was also designed to (attempt to) prevent a demagogue from taking office, as the Framers wanted the electors to have the final say and didn't think the masses were educated enough.
