todayilearned,ffq1537,t1_ffq0mi2,1580114695.0,"this argument only carries water if you believe all tax is theft. Tax has existed for as long as civilisation has existed. The idea of property ownership is intrinsically linked to the concept of taxation. Rule of law and property only exist via the state and the state only exists via taxation.

funnily enough tax has, throughout history, more often been used by the wealthy to extract wealth from the peasantry than the other way around. 

The industrial revolution made wealth extraction via capitalism so insanely effective that tax was no longer needed for this purpose. Instead tax has been needed to support the infrastructure of capitalism. Education is part of this infrastructure. The American economy doesn’t work without trained and educated workers.

I agree that there is a fairness issue with the concept of forgiving debt, but there is also a fairness issue with the concept of free education for everyone while all who came before suffer under debt. If the state is going to pay for the education of my children, why can it not pay for my own education retrospectively?

Telling all of Canberra that the woden hospital is getting upgrades = people thinking an old hospital is being modernised. You have to go into the detail to explain that “no it’ll add this many beds and it’ll decrease wait times by x amount etc etc.”

But telling gungahlin residents specifically that they’ll be getting their own hospital makes them feel like they’re getting a whole new woden or Calvary just for themselves. It also makes people immediately assume the new hospital will add a “whole hospital” worth of capacity to the health system. You don’t have to count beds because voters minds think of a hospital as a unit of measurement in itself.

You always want your political opponent to be reliant on a technocratic answer in the face of what *sounds like* a bigger investment. It’s much harder for labor to explain why their plan is better policy. Voters just think “yeah well you would say that”.

And by locating the hospital in Gungahlin they’d really wedge Labor. Labor needs to hold three seats in Gunners. The Libs promising a hospital gives them a real shot at taking the swing seat. And Labor can’t make big promises in gungahlin to counter this, because the Southside electorates are already pissed at a perceived over-investment in gungahlin to their expense. But this won’t hurt the Libs, because they can also claim that a gungahlin hospital will take pressure off the woden hospital (and reduce traffic to/from the hospital) so will be an effective investment in woden. The big ticket item in woden is stage 2 of light rail anyway so woden hospital upgrades get lost in the debate anyway.

They could repurpose money being spent on the Canberra Hospital expansion for different Health infrastructure (for example, a brand new hospital in Gungahlin).

They could promise tax changes that have minimal impact on short term revenue. For example, they could stall the transition away from stamp duty, which would give them a “lower rates” policy which isn’t as blunt as their current “rates freeze”. Tbh though, I don’t think you win state/territory elections on tax policy. The states/territories have a vertical fiscal imbalance that means they always outspend their tax take, the commonwealth has the opposite, taxing far more than it directly spends.

It won’t work. The Liberals not only need to have a clear policy on the future of Light Rail in Canberra, they need an acceptable rationale for their change in opinion. People won’t buy it if you spend almost a decade saying a policy is a carastrophic threat to Canberrans and then turn around and say it’s fine now and you’re committed to expanding it.

If I was the Liberals I would accept the success of Light Rail, accept that the party was wrong on the issue in the past, and commit to progress on a future network not dissimilar to the one the Government is working towards. Then they can focus on developing a point of difference elsewhere.

So when a guy like this sees young men doing ballet, all he sees is the concept of masculinity, which is the basis of his identity, being undermined. He sees his role in society being delegitimised and therefore destabilised.

If he had a well rounded identity, that was based on a broader sense of self (family or cultural identity, identity within a family structure (eg, parenthood), professional identity, strong community and social networks, etc) then he might be more open to having one of his pillars challenged.

This is the same as when people go crazy over some persons decision not to have kids (parenthood is central to their identity and they see the social capital of that role being challenged), or racism (a persons race is central to their identity and they see the social context of their race changing), or almost any political extremism.

WatchPeopleDieInside,felg47s,t1_fek1nu0,1579221369.0,"The narratives around migration are all politically motivated in my opinion. 

Occam’s razor dictates that any migrant is motivated to migrate because the rewards outweighs the risks, or because the risks of remaining in their home country outweigh the risks of migrating.

Disputing what those risks are is kind of meaningless. The fact is that we can’t come to some sort of absolute moral position on what does and does not constitute a “legitimate” reason to migrate. I know we can defer to international law but at the end of the day that is too blunt an instrument and is easily exploited in practice.

There is no limit to the number of people who want a better life. Countries which are socially and economically stable will always attract migrants and countries which are socially and economically unstable will always exist to provide a source of migrants.

Some people take the view that we should just accept this and open all borders. This assumes that it is not possible for migration itself to be socially and economically destabilising to a country. I am not sure this is true. I think what some fail to realise is that social and economic instability is not felt evenly throughout a countries population. The instability felt by the poor is not necessarily felt by the rich. 

A lot of people look at the different views on migration within a country and glibly explain that this is a result of poor education among the lower classes. I think this is certainly a significant factor, but I also think that the lower classes are inherently averse to threats of social and economic instability in a way that the upper classes aren’t. There is a legitimate reason for anxiety of destabilisation among the poor, and that anxiety can be misdirected and lead to racial tensions. But ultimately the cause of the anxiety is the destabilising effect of *any* rapid change in population. The “other” who is causing this change is just most easily identified by race. Obviously this isn’t the only explanation for racism or xenophobia, but in the context of people’s views on immigration specifically, I think it is an overlooked factor."

This image uses extreme examples of unjust laws to make a blanket argument that massively oversimplifies the relationship between laws and morality.

I do not believe in objective morality. If you believe in the separation of church and state, then you must also believe that there is no external morality a society can defer to when making its laws. For that reason, any truly secular state cannot claim morality is anything but a subjective assessment of a situation made by an individual or group. Subjective morality cannot be a basis for a system of law, which must operate on the basis of some level of objectivity.

Therefore laws are justified on the basis that they are in the *best interest* of society and exist within a legal framework that is also in the best interest of society.

So on what basis can an individual determine a law to be *wrong*? In a secular society, one cannot claim a law is *wrong* on the basis of that laws morality. Because in a secular society law is not justified on moral grounds. If you want to argue that a law is wrong, you must argue that it is not in the best interest of society *or* that it contravenes broader legal principles that are necessary for societies best interests to be maintained.

He is explicitly saying he does not agree with the nazis, but that as a politically ambitious person he very likely would have joined the dominant political party of his time despite their flaws. 

It’s not a great look either way, because he is essentially saying that he is a careerist whose political ideology is secondary to his personal ambition, but he is not saying that the nazis were correct. Tbh, this careerist mentality is common among all parties, especially at the youth level. At least this dickhead has the self-awareness to acknowledge it."

You would still need elected administrators.

You would also need an elected opposition of some kind to act as spokespeople *against* the administration and also to be the “administration-in-waiting”. All of these people would be members of a sort of non-voting legislature.

Then for votes you could have an online platform that you have to log in to. You would have a live feed of the legislature.

australia,fdsm1n0,t1_fdrovgs,1578704952.0,"I would imagine the fires are changing some voters minds, but I don’t think they are necessarily doing so in the way your question frames it.

I think that, for voters who are already broadly sympathetic to the climate message, the fires are elevating that issue in their minds. There may be many voters who have always believed climate action is important but who may not have thought it was *more* important than, say, the economy or taxes or healthcare. I am sure that at least some of those voters would now rate climate as more influential on their decision come election time. Unfortunately, I don’t think this alone would have swung the election enough to change the outcome. I think it would push Labor votes to the Greens and possibly some inner city Lib votes to Labor/Greens but not enough to change seats. 

I think there are another class of voter who do not identify the fires directly with climate change, but who would be influenced by the Prime Ministers woeful handling of the crisis. I think these voters are far more likely to be swinging voters. I think this tarnishing of the Prime Ministers personal brand would be far more likely to influence results in marginal seats and effect the ultimate outcome of a hypothetical election.

Then we’ve got the rural and regional voters most directly effected by the fires. I think community anger at the government would be very high in these communities. These communities are pretty diverse, but I think the general trend would be an increase in protest votes against the government. Depending on the electorate, this could help the Labor vote or help elect rural independents and minor parties like shooters, fishers and farmers.

Overall, the 2019 election was actually pretty close, and a big part of the Liberals victory was down to Scott Morrison’s very strong campaigning ability. I think the damage to his brand and the general community anger against the handling of such a significant crisis would have a greater impact on election results than climate anxiety. I think this effect could be strong enough to swing seats and allow labor to win a hypothetical election if it were held today. 

I think the next few opinion polls will be very telling."

My problem is that feeding our desire to feel politically active needs to be balanced against a realistic strategy to achieve actual outcomes.

Unfortunately, I believe this and many similar protests are doing more to help the protesters feel good than they are to win the hearts and minds of the public.

Think of it this way.

It is a fundamentally flawed argument. Having my beliefs reflected by parliamentarians might make me feel good but it doesn’t necessarily mean that my beliefs will be enacted through legislation or governance. A government can only hold one position on any given issue. A parliamentary majority can only hold one position on any given issue. In any policy debate, there is only one real “winner”- the policy that gets enacted by the government. 

It doesn’t matter if there is one winner and one loser, or if there is one winner and 50 losers. There is still just one winner. There is no benefit to a system that circulates more failed ideas through the parliament. The only position that yields outcomes is the governments position.

Policy work generally isn’t done by MPs, it’s done by government. We don’t need to elect people on the basis of their skill as policy drafters. Government has resources for that work outside the parliament.

The main impact of a minority coalition partner is the concessions they can win in return for their support of the government. The only other impact they really have is their decisions as Ministers or the decision to withdraw support from a government mid-term and force an election.

australia,fdml88w,t1_fdmjwfv,1578554132.0,"It doesn’t matter how diverse the parliamentary debate is. Parliamentary debate is theatre. It’s a place for political grandstanding and empty rhetoric. Ultimately, the parliament can only make one decision on a piece of legislation- yes or no. If you have 2 parties or 50, ultimately they have to come to a majority position.

The thing is, we actually have a relatively pluralistic senate already. No single party has had a majority in the senate for over a decade. 

Ultimately, there are still only two sides to most issues. How often do the Greens and the Libs team up to vote against Labor? Very very rarely. 

Sure, the Greens will vote against Labor and the Coalition on occasion, but this is meaningless. Ultimately parties tend to stick to their side of the “spectrum”. The centre is still the centre, most parties fall on one side of the other. It’s still a binary.

The people who most exemplify your ideal of a pluralistic parliament are people like Jacqui Lambie, Pauline Hanson, and Clive Palmer. They’re wildcards, won over by horse trading and political opportunism. 

The only reason they matter as a “crossbench” is because they are untethered to any rational political ideology. They’re not reflecting any particular constituency in how they vote, they’re just enacting their personal ideology and political self interest.

This way of thinking is basically an appeal to some sort of natural democratic order that has never existed. Ancient Rome had formalised political factions. 

This idea that somehow you can have a system which simultaneously represents the full diversity of community opinion is a farce. Ultimately, democracy is a system of majority rule. The minority view is irrelevant in all democratic systems. 
 
There is nothing inherently wrong with two-party dominance within democracy. It allows voters to have a clear understanding of their choice at an election. 

In multi-party systems, the parties elected compromise to reach a majority position. It is still majority rule, but the majority position is decided by political parties negotiating, rather than being directly endorsed by voters. This represents a less direct relationship between the voter and the decisions ultimately taken by government. 

Parties cannot clearly promise to deliver a full suite of policies. Parties can list their positions, but it is much harder for voters to understand the parties priorities in a negotiation. For example, two parties may make an equal promise on climate action, but one of those parties may be willing to sell out that policy in exchange for concessions elsewhere. Voters cannot easily hold parties to account under such a system.

In a system where parties tend to hold absolute majority, they are fully accountable for their promises. There is a single point of accountability.

A big part of the reason people don’t like major parties is because they don’t like the political compromises those parties have to make to win government. Those are the same compromises minor parties would have to make to negotiate coalitions in a pluralistic system. The difference is that a two party systems lets voters know what those compromises will be before voting, rather than afterwards."
