I remember there being a post from r/Teenagers complaining how their dad was an engineer or something where knowing complicated math was necessary and learned a formula from him. Teacher didn't understand it despite the answer being right and tried to argue that it was a lucky guess or something that he got the right answer from it. The formula the teacher was teaching was longer and required extra work for the same answer.

So yeah.. TL;DR teachers don't know everything and just parrot from a book like they teach you to do."
