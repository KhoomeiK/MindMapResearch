ADHD,ffyndni,t3_evs07s,1580350541.0,Oh I thought this was a depression thing. Seems like there are a lot of overlapping symptoms.
AskReddit,ffymy9c,t3_evqtcc,1580350254.0,Is anybody actually happy? I thought that was a myth that capitalism uses to keep us working.
depression,ffybg83,t1_ffy8vb7,1580342452.0,"I do invest. I kind of have hobbies but actually doing them takes motivation and energy I dont have. Also they feel pointless, I dont get enjoyment out of them like I used to."
mbti,ffx9kas,t1_ffwxsw8,1580320591.0,"No one is 100% in the dead middle. Therefore whichever side they lean to most is what they are. Most people I've seem claiming to be ambiverts are people who prefer to spend most of their time alone but are really chatty with people they're close to and enjoy being around their friends. That's just introversion. Most introverts enjoy being around and are talkative with their friends with the exception of the more extreme introverts. 

For example, I enjoy doing things with my friends and can occasionally be the loudest in the group if there arent strangers around, but I have to space it out to give myself time to recharge."
IncelExit,ffsislf,t1_ffs9b9l,1580182721.0,"I'm not saying it's their fault, I'm saying that evil and cowardly people take advantage of those who are too trusting, or people who dont have the strength or confidence to stand up for themselves. That's not on them, it's usually a result of poor childhoods. 

I think it's more demeaning that you think women consciously CHOSE to be with abusers. If you want to learn more about how women get stuck in abusive relationships, there are plenty of resources out there for you to learn more."
IncelExit,ffs91sc,t1_ffs620j,1580176118.0,"And something to remember is that guys like that know which girls to go for. They go for vulnerable, insecure girls who never saw the abuse coming."

AskMen,fekia7s,t1_fejcxxs,1579200615.0,"People complain about how everyone of one gender or the other is toxic/trash without realizing they're not being picky enough and settling with the first thing that comes along, which will get you into trouble 9 times out of 10.

AmItheAsshole,fedsss9,t3_eojuzh,1579019129.0,"ESH. For some reason I get the feeling that the ""bullying"" wasnt really that bad. We dont have the full story, and I think literally celebrating the death of anyone other than a dictator or something is pretty assholeish behaviour. Whether you did it in private or not. 

Also is no one else questioning how this teenager ""died in his sleep""? I think there is something more to it. I dont really like to post theories I can't back up though."

BrainFog,fdxsva5,t3_enbh5v,1578772532.0,"To be clear, ""brain fog"" is not a medical condition, or even a medical term. It is a description that people use to describe a feeling, whereas confusion is used in medical contexts. 

Confusion is when you are disoriented, like cant remember things, mix up facts, etc. 

Brain fog, as people talk about here, is the feeling that you cant think straight, cant focus. As a result you can have confusing moments."

IncelExit,fdwa6uk,t1_fdw5vw1,1578756642.0,Theres a YouTube channel called Charisma on Command that specifically focuses on teaching men how to be social and charismatic. It's pretty useful from what I've seen.
AskWomen,fdw8btx,t3_emxwr1,1578756104.0,"I was asked to a dance but he never actually interacted with me at the dance or after. I realized years later it had probably been a dare and he didnt actually like me.  Didnt affect me too much because I didnt think it was based on my looks, more like boys just daring each other to ask out a random girl. And I didnt even like him anyways so my feelings weren't too hurt, I was just confused at the time."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdso6zg,t3_emw8wp,1578705788.0,"I personally dont see anything wrong with this tweet. It's not calling for legalization, of saying offending is okay. It is affirming to people who struggle with this that simply having the attraction does not make them a bad person. 

My problem with calling all pedophiles monsters and disgusting is that non offending pedophiles cant reach out to anyone for fear of being judged/ outed /reported even when they havent done anything wrong. As a result these people dont get the help they need."

AmItheAsshole,fd67bm3,t1_fd2ca4i,1578186582.0,"Ah yes, the selfish girlfriend who wanted to be included in her bf birthday. Very manipulative of her to express disappointment at being entirely left out. What a drama queen. Love to see these trigger words.

Would it have really taken that much effort to take 10 minutes here and there to chat with her/ do beach activities? I dont think it's that much to ask. No matter the day or circumstance, if you invite someone along and never interact with them, that's shitty.

Edit: YTA for how you responded to somone expressing disappointment. It's not like she even went overboard about it. She said she was mad, and when someone made a rude comment she understandably went quiet."
