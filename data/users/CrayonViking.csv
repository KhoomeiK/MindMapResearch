I hear you. I STILL watch TNG when I am cleaning house and stuff. But the reality is, and this is the point of the Picard show too, is that those times have passed. Different world now. Different fictional Trek universe now too.

Trek always like to mirror current day events and environment. And today is far more complicated than that the 80's and 90's was. 

Sucks. I loved the slower more thoughtful approach of TNG. But a show like that doesn't capture an audience now, and if there is no audience, there is no money. No money, no show. :/"

Now I happily pay CBS at it's current price model. But if it raised it even a few dollars, I'd bail. For me, the current price point is perfect. I won't be paying NBC tho. Not enough shows that I like.

Also I like Star Trek and I am glad to pay for it to keep it on the air with current special effects and current budget. I am a die-hard TNG fan, but I really like Star Trek: Discovery. Not the main character so much, but in season two, Captain Pike. He's easily my fav captain after Picard.

Hey I'm all for boycotting what you wanna boycott. But like it or not, their business model is the future.

I personally think the small fee is cheap and provides me value because I watch more than one show on cbs. If I didn't, I'd sail the pirate seas to get it.

I'm always torn on these types of stories. The ceo has stockholders, employees, etc to think about. And anything new IS a gamble. And many CEO's have lost their jobs taking a gamble on a new idea and it failing. And many companies have went out of business betting their money on something new and upcoming.

What surprises me tho, is how many people do that commute. WTF?!

Gas, wear-and-tear, accident probability, and time. Imma need 6 figures for that kinda of drama."
television,fe5bj6y,t1_fe4lrq7,1578867331.0,Right?! Do we even have mods that mod this sub anymore? Half of the posts here are from interns/lower level staffers and marketing companies or from someone looking for a job at one of those marketing companies. Annoying af.
celebnsfw,fe5b8jk,t1_fe4cgn7,1578867273.0,No wax. But trimmed! :)
television,fe595c0,t1_fe4t2uq,1578866720.0,"So you just happen to like the show so much, you decide to make and/or post videos that recap the first season!? When most of the fans who watch the show already know what happened the first season?!

Because that really sounds like a company that has been tasked to bring new viewers to a show that just happened to have recently start streaming on a different service.

And you may not get paid the big bucks but you work and/or volunteer for a company that's promoting this show, don't you?"
todayilearned,fe589w1,t1_fe43d72,1578866517.0,"Because this isn't fucking wikipedia and when we express an opinion we don't don't have to search for sources. Are you fucking new here or are you just salty because I don't let people catch a break just because they would rather do drugs than work.

But hey, be the change you wanna see, brah.

Starting w your very next paycheck, give half of it away to all the fucking beggers you see. Do that every paycheck for the next 6 months. The come back here and tell us how many of those people used your money to buy more fucking drugs.

I stand by what I said. My ""source"" is my experience from my last job where I worked with the homeless for 8 months and got to know them. Sure some of them suffered from mental illness, but the vast majority were men and women who hated rules and couldn't stand the idea of actually getting a job to get out of their situation.

Dude most of the people I was working with wouldn't even stay in the shelter because they was a no-smoking rule there.

Who the fuck would rather sleep on the streets than give up smoking for a little bit to stay in a warm bed?! I know you WANT to believe people are good and all are willing to work. They aren't. 

Maybe your area is different. I doubt it.

So yeah, I stand by what I say. Most homeless people are that way because they are lazy and choose drugs over working."
television,fe4eqyo,t3_enpzzk,1578858492.0,This fucking sub is being overtaken by paid marketing people hyping up The Expanse. Stop. Just fucking stop.
television,fe440wn,t1_fe2vo1o,1578855610.0,"And the fucking ""OMG the Jeopardy ratings are higher than ever!!"" posts all over this sub ever day aren't?!"
television,fe41uov,t3_ennmub,1578854990.0,"Even this sub, which seems to put up a fucking ""Jeopardy ratings"" post every fucking day, sorta ignores this show because they think it's on an old people's network. Yet they obsess about Jeopardy!!

Fucking autism in this sub... LMAO

But ya, I agree w OP that Evil is a great show!"
BigBrother,fe40x7n,t1_fe391qw,1578854692.0,This!

Drug use is a fucking choice, brah."
