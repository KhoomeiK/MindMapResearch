tarot,ffd8go1,t3_estcxx,1579815464.0,"Female here but interested in gender issues. I heard an interesting podcast about how to read for your queer clients that talks a lot about gender. I’m an idiot when it comes to linking but the podcast is called Tarto Bytes, and the Episode is Queering the Tarot with Cassandra Snow.  She talks among other things about a gay male client who described a reading with a lot of fem cards as applying to his partner. Since then I have considered that a king or queen in a reading could be referring to those traits in either gender."
