todayilearned,fcrkdvg,t1_fcr7o20,1577902962.0,"Well, that's also not correct. Not only is ""strategic initiative"" a pretty vague term, but  in the fighting around moscow, the USSR was making attacks on the germans, especially in the winter and spring, where the axis supply lines were too strung out to provide much of anything, whilst the russians were used to it. Hitler himself called the Wehr's armaments a ""Schönwetterbewaffnung"" (nice weather weapons) in his recording discussing how they messed up attacking russia from the get-go due to faulty intelligence. 

 Several of the battles that are poorly publicized were offenses by the soviet union before kursk. These were poorly publicized because the german sidee wanted to keep the myth alive that the soviets were still as incompetent as the rushed and poorly supplied winter war, and the soviet side didn't because those offensives usually resulted in a voluntary retreat because the rest of the line had to fall back, and after order 227 that was not something army propaganda could allow. 

But after the fall of the Soviet Union about 25 years ago, the military archives provided a lot of material to show what happened on the soviet side, instead of just german commander war diaries which claimed the soviet untermensche only won because of superior numbers."

>We are a EU-based Arma 3 community with a desire to grow. In our operations we rely on planning, communication, teamwork and deployment of adapted military tactics. While we enjoy more realistic aspects of the game, it is important that this does not compromise the gameplay experience. As such, we do not adhere to any military structure in terms of ranks etc. as all members are considered equal.

>Our passion comes from challenging missions where we have to fight for a victory, never losing track of player experience. We do not want an easy victory where it is impossible to fail. We want challenging and immersive scenarios with reactive and responsive AI. In order to achieve this, our mission makers utilize a custom mission framework and various scripts in addition to the standard assets.


## About our operations


* Dedicated server for main operations, training grounds available during non-mission hours.
* Two weekly premade operations, set in modern day or cold war-era.
* Wednesdays 19:00 CET (GMT+1) or CEST (Summer Time, GMT+2).
* Saturdays 20:00 CET (GMT+1) or CEST (Summer Time, GMT+2).
* Units we play as includes (but is not limited to) US Army, US Marines, Tier 1 Operators, British Armed Forces, Bundeswehr and Russian Armed Forces.
* We play mainly as infantry, with additional helo and/or IFV support.


## What we are looking for


>Emotionally mature and teamwork-oriented players who are willing to learn and improve. It doesn't matter if you are a battle hardened veteran or completely new to ARMA, everyone is equally welcome.


## About trainings we offer


>Every new member will receive mentoring to ensure his smooth transition into our unit. In addition we provide voluntary specialist trainings for certain combat roles such as: marksman / sniper, combat medic, heavy weapons specialist and helicopter pilots. If you want to improve or learn these roles, we offer you many opportunities to do so though training days and mentoring.


## Requirements


* You are at least 18 years old and you are able to respect and understand others in the unit, and give and take criticism for personal learning. We give everyone a chance to show what they are made of.
* TeamSpeak 3 Client
* A working microphone
* Legal copy of ARMA 3 (also, while not required, we strongly recommend the APEX DLC)
* Weekly attendance. However, as real life always comes first, not everyone can always make this. In this case, just post a Leave of Absence so that we know and can plan the operations accordingly.


## About mods


>We, like many other units out there, use a collection of mods to improve and expand the base game. Some of these mods have been further customized to better suit our needs. Size of the modset is currently around 40 GB, and we use Arma3Sync to distribute and keep it synced.


## How to join


>Fill an **[application](http://www.7th-ranger.com/armarecruitment)** on our website. Once a Recruiter has reviewed it, he will contact you through Steam and invite you to our Teamspeak to have a chat. If we are what you are looking for and vice versa, you will get further access to all the needed resources to be able to join our operations.

And at that point the germans were already desperate for a win. But the soviets managed to fool the germans into pretty much only bombing fake airfields near kursk, keeping the real ones intact, and were able to withdraw 9/10 of all the troops around kursk _without the germans noticing_. The Soviet ability for camouflage was noted to be significantly above average by the Germans.

Sure, the codes being cracked helped, but kursk was a really obvious target, so the defenses there were made regardless. It was also (from a hindsight perspective)  a completely unwinnable war for the axis at that point- the front was just too broad and the logistics too hard half of the year (winter, followed by the even worse spring mud).

Also,Kursk wasn't the greatest defeat the germans suffered on that front. Some of the battles near moscow had a bodycount for the germans higher then stalingrad, which in itself had a casualty count even higher then kursk. Even Leningrad was more pivotal, sapping german resources for years, whilst keeping moscow from being surrounded.

TL;DR dont just reurgitate the propaganda fed to you."
