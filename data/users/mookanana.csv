PhoenixPoint,ff4887x,t3_erhlo1,1579557674.0,"yes. i'd like to emphasize on the armor and enemy turn time. enemy armor makes most weapons useless, basically, in order for you to make use of a deimos assault rifle, you have to bring shredding weapons. might as well just go snipers and heavies to counter armor with big numbers, or simply use armor penetration, which they promptly nerfed because 'too many people were using them'. why can't they nerf enemy armor because 'too many enemy units have too much armor?' bad design choice imo.

some people say bring acid weapons to counter armor. i don't mind playing the counter armor game, but then i don't want to wait one hour each map just simply waiting for the enemy to complete their turn. they seriously need to look into skipping or speeding up enemy animations. the QOL in this game is really bad. another example is no option to dismiss troops u don't want, u gotta suicide them. spotting enemies is another shitty system, on late game maps there are so many enemies that you can't even move an inch without stopping to spot another enemy, and this happens like 8 times u try to move your soldier to a square that's 3 tiles away. it's fucking annoying. to top it off, it subtracts your action points so much that you sometimes can't even reach the tile you wanted to get to."
