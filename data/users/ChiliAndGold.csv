My mechanic once had a dog that got found 12 years after her disappearence. Though she was a mutt and of no value to anyone, so I guess that makes the situation quite different. Though one never knows. 

I wish just the best of luck and destiny."
AskReddit,fgi9111,t1_fgfwywp,1580811975.0,"This made me think so so so  much. I'm getting close to my 30s and I've been together with my husband for 9 years now. The reason we don't have kids yet was my restless search for a job. We're European so it's not like I have to get 3 jobs at once and care about healthcare or anything.   
But because we never had much money, I've never seen much of the world. 

And now we come to the place where we actually really want to have at least one kid, because I think we actually would make a pair of decent parents. But I'm gonna miss my time being alone so much. I love just leaving the house, with music in my ears and no need to be home early. Or just take a nap on the couch after getting home from work. 

I have two nieces and a nephew. I spend as much time with them as I can. But god am I happy whenever I can just give them back to their mum and dad! Especially the younges one is one hell of an energy bomb! I think a kid like that would kill me slowly over the years."

gaming,fgi6mjb,t3_eyhqf0,1580808263.0,"I'm actually impressed if they put any children into it at all. It's something I wondered a lot in games like Sleeping Dog, RDR2, GTA, and so on. There aren't even any kids! And I guess we all know why."

Scares me to think how I would react. I know I wouldn't be hostile, god no. But I had my first boyfriend when I was 19 and I'm still married to him... So I can't even talk about break ups or really young love.   
I hope I will handle it as great as you did and that my children will be happy, whenever love first finds them"
