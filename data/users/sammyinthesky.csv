Go inside, throw my pants away. Order new pants on amazon prime, wait 2 days in the bathroom stall while concerned employees sneak me food scraps and water. Get my package, put on new pants. Go home and tell everyone that I went on a 2 day coke bender to avoid any embarrassment."

relationship_advice,fegrm1d,t3_ep355z,1579100913.0,"You are young. There is a big difference in maturity between 18 and 26. Huge difference. He is probably worried people will get the wrong idea....which is probably actually the right idea. I was in a relationship same ages, I was 18 he 26...at the time seemed right. I ended up spending 6 years with someone who didn't care about me at all. And after it all...I realized how young I was then. When I turned 26, I realized how much older and mature I was than at 18...and realized no reasonable 26 YO male should be interested in a girl still In high school. 
Remember....its not that 8 years difference is bad thing. Its a bad thing because your brain is still devoloping and his already has. You'll find someone more suitable, keep ur chin up!"
