I want a game where you start in a vault with a radiation leak where residents are slowly ghoulifying and you leave to search for a cure which you never find but over the course of the game you develop ghoul traits like Rad resistance and tougher skin.  You get increasingly ugly and people are less inclined to cooperate with you but eventually ghouls stop attacking on sight and you can eat and drink anything.  The big choice could be between embracing an irradiated ghoul future where people will be tough but go mad after a couple of decades, or you fight against it to purify your community and remain fragile but human."

australia,ffwgox1,t1_ffwe66b,1580300377.0,hazard reduction burns weren't an option this year anyway because the weather was so much hotter and drier than it should be that any deliberately lit fire had the potential to run out of control.
australia,ffwgapd,t1_ffwdohz,1580299964.0,"i'm pretty sure that's a legal requirement on rural properties, or at least it was at my parents place.  They were required to have a reliable firefighting pump and a water tank in order to build outside of a town water supply.  I'm surprised australian homes aren't legally required to have automatic sprinklers at each corner of the roof by now."

startrek,ffvw992,t1_ffvu7cc,1580275169.0,The filler trash episodes are vital to the show's charm though.  If it wasn't a little bit cheap and silly from time to time it would lose a big part of it's personality.
XFiles,ffvvwrr,t3_evcfcz,1580274856.0,"The show would have bombed if they hadn't made Scully respectable, but I could still see it being a fun show with Pam.  She's got a lot of charisma.  I've been meaning to watch Baywatch Nights one of these days because when X Files and Buffy and Charmed blew up they tried to make a Baywatch crossover where David Hasselhoff was a life saver during the day but stayed up all night solving supernatural mysteries.  It sounds like it's probably hilarious garbage.  Only ran for two seasons I think."

That's why Australia has most of it's feral species.  We have feral deer and pigs and rabbits and foxes because some fool English hunter missed shooting at them.  There's invasive species of fish that were introduced just because they'd be fun to catch and other species that were introduced just for use as bait.  We also have several species that are extinct thanks to hunting.  Hunters served their purpose until agriculture, refrigeration, and transport were developed but for the past couple of centuries they've done more harm than good."

I don't want to argue about this as if I totally believe it was a hit by the way, it's just that as easily as I can believe it was a random murder I can just as easily believe that whoever arranged the initial meeting also slipped a homeless kid a hundred bucks to kill the guy who showed up for it."

My wife's 04 Camry lost the rear window and the only undamaged panels are the passenger side doors that were facing away from the hail.
