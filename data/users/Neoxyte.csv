CallOfDutyMobile,ffme9aa,t1_ffl4pnn,1580053255.0,If you can't get above elite than the problem is you not the randoms. You should be able to carry any game at that rank. Check your loadouts. Use better scorestreak and have loadouts for domination and snd.
CallOfDutyMobile,ffmdrup,t1_ffkasuy,1580053084.0,Yeah really. You can rank up to master even if you lose more games than you win. You can lose 2-3 games and make all the points back with 1 win.
legaladvice,fflaw84,t3_eu5g6v,1580037295.0,Worst case scenario just ask to get the checks cancelled because you did not receive them. They can issue a new check on the next payroll. I would also suggest getting direct deposit. If you can't get a normal free bank account with no fees then look into apps like Chime.
legaladvice,ffl4o6g,t3_eu4w6f,1580034737.0,It can be statutory rape and even normal rape if what you say is true. If you really want to pursue this then you should contact the police. I also recommend seeing a doctor asap to make sure you are not pregnant or have an infection/ serious disease).

worldnews,ffi9pfl,t1_ffi42vg,1579968673.0,North Korea is definitely capable of handling an epidemic. They are at a distinct advantage where inter country travel is only for authorized individuals. This allows them to quarantine more efficiently as they already have tight checkpoints within provinces and surrounding the Pyongyang area.

Before the digital age, it was common to bring books to read while resting at shelter. The problem is books are heavy. So tearing the pages for fire fuel is a great way to reduce weight and make good use of waste."

2007scape,fer7pid,t1_fepm8f9,1579350866.0,It's one of those accounts that try to get as many downvoted as possible. There is a subreddit where they compete against each other for most downvotes.

worldnews,feqbm35,t1_feq1rtv,1579339842.0,The misconception about Japanese suicide is probably due to the prevelance of suicide in Japanese art exports like video games (i.e. final fantasy 6 opera scene) or animation (Japanese anime is full of suicidal ideations).
CallOfDutyMobile,feq7adz,t1_fepa1ib,1579338523.0,This is not a good idea because it will link it to the fake email and if you forget the fake email you will lose your account if your phone is reset or something. Facebook is always a backup but just don't risk it.
CallOfDutyMobile,feq7533,t3_eqanv6,1579338468.0,This only works for Gmail. I don't think this works for other email providers like outlook or Yahoo. But then again who still uses anything except Gmail lol .
CallOfDutyMobile,feq6xdg,t1_feprtns,1579338385.0,Look at the new events in game. You can get tickets from completion milestones in the event. You can also get tickets by referring new people to the game using the new refer feature.
CallOfDutyMobile,feq6ss5,t1_fepgwkw,1579338336.0,Yeah me and most of my friends got this on the first crate. I think the first crate is rigged to get a weapon (a shitty one though) on purpose so people won't think that it's a bad crate in general.

mildlyinfuriating,fepvhsv,t1_fepp0y1,1579332781.0,"Cellophane is what you use for stuff like cling wrap and other wrapping material for packaging. You can't replace plastics with cellophane because the material isn't strong enough. Milk jugs, soda bottles, water bottles etc can not be made from cellophane."

CallOfDutyMobile,fepoagm,t1_fepfffg,1579325929.0,If the servers were having issues then everyone would be dcing or lagging on your team and the enemy team. And even then if the servers are having issues why are you playing ranked? The new system is great and finally punishes dcers and quitters appropriately.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fepnux2,t1_feow12j,1579325553.0,only 3?
CallOfDutyMobile,fep7rpl,t1_fenujjw,1579314039.0,It's not fair to your teammates if you dc constantly due to network issues. This is a good system. If your connection is bad then ranked isn't for you.
CallOfDutyMobile,fep7pll,t1_fenb0kz,1579314002.0,If you don't have 20 minutes for a match of S+D then you don't have time for ranked. Assume all ranked matches will be s+d. It's not fair to your teammates otherwise.

CallOfDutyMobile,fekr5w4,t3_epku4g,1579205902.0,when you're 1 xp away from ranking up.
CallOfDutyMobile,fejls04,t1_fej79us,1579179202.0,No wonder. I've been camping areas where there is usually no one there (the windmills) and bots sometimes come out of no where.

CallOfDutyMobile,fefucpi,t1_fedz0x0,1579065473.0,How would the balancing work in terms of offense / defense? First to 3 implies 5 total games which means there would be a team with an unfair advantage for each map. It should be first to 4 (six total games) with alternative offence and defense on each round.
CallOfDutyMobile,fefu8s4,t1_fefnh0s,1579065372.0,"When this happens, use smoke and start rushing hard. Even a well timed frag can help unless they have heavy trophy machines out."
CallOfDutyMobile,fefu72c,t1_fedgk2g,1579065329.0,"No, it's to gate content so people have a reason to keep checking updates. These maps barely take up space. It also helps with queue times in ranked modes."
CallOfDutyMobile,fefu472,t1_fef76uc,1579065261.0,Now everyone is going to be master and the people that actually worked for master are going to be stuck with a bunch of noobs. There is no disproportionate point loss at pro ranks and lower. You can still gain levels if you lose 2 games for every 1 win. Now it's going to be even easier.

WatchPeopleDieInside,fefnw4o,t1_fefig8a,1579060460.0,Just because there was no physical pain does not mean that there was no emotional or psychological damage. Believing you are about to die can be traumatizing for anyone.
