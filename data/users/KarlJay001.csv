I'll give you an example of how life works, I'll use an analogy.  When I was 15, I saw a dream car that a classmate had.  It was a first gen Toyota Celica and a co-worker had one too, I thought it was the greatest thing.  I've had 3 of them.  Then I saw the 280ZX and I thought it was the greatest thing... I've also had 3 of them.

I've done the same thing with motorcycles, trucks and muscle cars.  We do this with smart phones too.  The iPhone 4S was amazing, then the 6S was amazing, the the X was amazing...

This is life.  When I started a business I thought it was the greatest thing, then I became an employee and thought it was the greatest thing at some of the companies.

One other option, but a board and replace the board.

A 10 year old board for an iMac can't be very expensive.  Here's a $40 one that might even be an upgrade compared to yours:

learnprogramming,ffqiq7i,t1_ffqf2uu,1580135715.0,"I've been in tech longer than you're been alive.  I'll tell you something that happened to me that was devastating.

I became a true expert in a number of languages and platforms over the years.  Back in the day, I used an xBase/DOS platform and I was one of the best in the world at it.  Then the job market changed.  Windows pushed out DOS and Microsoft products ruled.

After getting a BS degree in MIS, after about 10 years experience, I couldn't even get a job.

It's all about supply/demand.  Tech changes quickly.

I found a company that was using the old tech stack and got a job there.  It was the WORST job I ever had in my entire life.

When you say ""depressing dead end job""... go into debt with college loans, spend 10 years mastering a tech stack and THEN get a depressing dead end job...  that's even worse.

If I had stuck with fixing cars (I'm very skilled at fixing cars), I would have had steady work and the demand has always been there.  Plumbing, roofing, etc... demand is there... it doesn't change like tech does.

For the last 10 years, I study very hard iOS dev (iPhone programming) and now I find that I'm way past the average age and they keep changing the stack... it was Objective-C, then it was Swift 1, then it changed a lot with Swift 3, now Swift 5 and soon Swift 6.  They want cross platform (react native and Flutter).

When a new tech stack comes out, you don't know if it'll be around in 3 years.  Look at the job listings, they all want 3~5 years paid professional experience... Very hard for a fresh grad to get in the door."
iOSProgramming,ffqf47r,t3_eumsg2,1580132727.0,"This would be a lot more useful if you gave us some more details:

1. how many jobs did you apply for?

3. how far did you get in the interview process?
4. were you given test like Leetcode and how well did you do on them?
5. where were these jobs, were they in a tech hub like Silicon Valley, Austin, Seattle, NY?
6. were the internships with big name companies that we'd know?
7. do you have a CS or related degree?
8. did you put out any live apps?

Flutter/RN and others have been the source of frustration for the industry for a while.  Being able to have cross platform code is a business person's dream, but native has always won in the eyes of the consumer.

IDK if they've closed the gap or even getting closer between the two in terms of the product produced.

One problem is that I don't think everything is covered in cross platform tools and you never know how long they'll be around.

The other issue is that we control part of the job market.  If we all refused to do Flutter, then they'll have no programmers and it'll die off, but some will do it and get the jobs.  It makes it hard for us when we don't know if we should study Swift or Flutter, it makes it hard for the companies because they want cost effective solutions.

the 2019 MacBook Air still weighs less than Pro; at 1.25kg compared to 1.37kg.  That's 0.2645547 lbs... are you really going to notice that much extra weight?

The other issue is that would only be a concern when you're actually carrying it.  If you have it in a backpack, would you really be able to tell that 1/4 lb difference?

When I got mine, I was more concerned with the processor cores and screen size.  Even if it's a whole pound more, it's not like I wouldn't get used to the weight and I'm not carrying it for many hours a day.

It was such a mess that the customers started cancelling their memberships.  They would wait in line, see a shorter line and  would have to ask for their card to switch to the shorter line.  They would get home and realize they have the wrong card.  The membership dept was flooded with a big box of card that they had to sort out and give back to the right person.

-----------------------------------
Now on to the advice:

1. look at the job market and see what they are asking for.

2. specialize in something, some branch of programming.

3. don't just base things on what's popular now, find something you ENJOY doing because you'll be doing a LOT of it before you really have value in the market.

4. look at the true VALUE that you bring to the game, don't just come in with ""what's the least work I'll have to do in order to get the biggest paycheck?"" 

5. understand that Leetcode has very little to do with the work that a programmer does.  No real programmer would ever put rushed code into production.  Production code needs to be vetted before it's release.  (don't use Windows Vista as a guide).

6. learn how to produce code that now only works, but is ""production grade"", meaning you put the right bits in the right spots (MVC, MVVM, Viper, etc...)  Understand that this is for you and others to find the code that needs to be examined when they are looking to change things.

7. when you look at the ""top 10"" list for databases, languages, etc..  remember, everyone else is looking at the same thing.  Back in the DotCom days, there was a ""everyone should learn Java"" thing going around.  It was a joke because the more people that know Java, the less value it has.  When you apply for a job, and EVERYONE has Java on the resume, how do you stand out?  Understand a bit about supply/demand.  I'm not saying to study COBOL or to pick the most unpopular language/platform thinking that nobody else is there, so I'll have the advantage...  Just understand that the bar is raised and what is MOST COMMON is not going to be enough to stand out.  It sucks, but you'll likely have to know a few of these, so it's just more work for everyone in order to stand out."

This happens, it happened to me more than once.  Tech changes, stacks change, priorities change.  It's up to her to change to the new direction of the company or find something that works better for her.

From what you say, you're the one in charge, you're the one that is going to get into trouble because of anything going wrong.  You're already at risk because you're wasting company time dealing with things that aren't productive.

1. Pull her off ANYTHING critical

2. Have her work on something that's a branch off of the main project and remove merge rights

3. STOP WASTING YOUR TIME dealing with things that only slow down the progress...  YOU'LL be blamed and there is a school of thought that YOU ARE THE LEAD and you are the one that is paid to deal with this...  STOP LETTING HER WASTE YOUR TIME.

4. Try to reason with her... say ""Ok, you win... switch everything back to the way it was before... let me know when you're ready to go live..."" ...""Dump all the changes we've done in the last two years and start all over from where you left off two years ago..."" then walk away.

5. If need be, make up a project for her to work on, AKA ""busy work"".

Clearly there is a problem here, without seeing both sides, it sounds like she just lost all her value.  The company made changes, she's wasn't a part of that and she will have to adapt or leave or the company will have to go back to the old code and start the last 2 years over again.

Clearly the company isn't going to erase the last 2 years and start over... So that leaves two choices.

I'd give her some time off, maybe a few weeks, then have her come back (IF she want's to)... don't have her come back to the IT dept, have her come back to HR and have a ""very formal sit down"" with witnesses.  Explain that the direction of the company has changed and her old skills aren't needed any more.  If she retrains for the stack, she's more than welcome to re-apply.

Basic business law, I knew I lost the client, so I went to court and won.

Dealing with the boss is key, however, the boss won't always have time for you, so you have to draw a line somewhere.  Basically, I like to do the work asked for unless it's going to cost more.  If it's specs included in the project, there's no reason to involved the boss.

Remember that there's a system in place where the boss deals with higher level things and the ""worker bees"" deal with the lower level things.  If you're taking up the bosses time for all the lover level things that a ""worker bee"" should be able to handle, it won't go over as well.

For many years I've put food on the table by making business software.  I really don't care what language it's written in as long as things are stable and I'm able to get things done.

The time used to learn a new language or learn a version upgrade and fix all the code is time that I'm not adding features to a product.

Years ago when KickStarter make their Swift code public, we all looked at it and there were parts I couldn't read because they went so damn far from the base of what Swift was.

I get into the product that the code makes MUCH more than I get into what fancy syntax I can create.  I look at the time I have to sit there and figure out crap that doesn't make a better product in the eyes of the customer.

I sold custom business software back in the DotCom days and I know what it takes to get a business customer to write a check...  They never ask about syntax, they ask about the features the software has.

I'll spend the time learning all the ""upgrades"" to the language, I'll spend the time to make a Swift 4 project work with Swift 5 just because I really don't have much choice, but I'll always know that these things don't sell software.  I could sell app written in ObjC, Java, C# or Swift 1."

iOSProgramming,ffaf2io,t1_ffacpsr,1579734213.0,"This is an important point.  You MUST look at the value that the customer will be getting.  It isn't that you CAN build an app, it's that what you build has value in the eyes of someone else and that the value is competitive with others.

Jumping into a mature (10 year old) market and thinking you'll be competitive in a short period of time is a true long shot.

IF you had industry background, where you had specialized knowledge of something that could be exploited, that would be different.

When I was in college, I had a 35 hr/week job that more than covered my needs.  I started a side business and worked the job at night and weekends.  I had income and time to master the skill.

What would be better is if the job were programming, THAT would have been a LOT better because then you're not only covering your needs, you're getting paid to learn.

""Paid to learn"" is the best option, but here's the deal... EVERYONE want's to be paid to learn.  More so in tech, being paid to learn in tech is a dream and it's more difficult because of the nature of tech.

Tech is the kind of thing where you can REALLY screw things up.  I worked at a number of startups and some failed because of bad decisions concerning code and tech stack."
iOSProgramming,ffaeezn,t1_ffa57y2,1579733696.0,"I always wondered how other programmers viewed Swift.  IMO, I never really thought it was that easy of a language.  Maybe it has to do with coming from C/C++/C# and you get things burned into your way of thinking.

I started out on Android 10 years ago and switch because of the security of iOS vs Android because I was focusing on business apps."
iOSProgramming,ffae2jl,t1_ffaawvx,1579733420.0,"This will always be a concern.  10 years ago, I started iOS dev and bought an iPodTouch for about $300.  It stopped at iOS 6.1 and I was REALLY pissed because it was a $300 32GB toy that wasn't doing what I bought it for and iOS 7 was a big upgrade.

Here's the deal, the people that buy used MBPs aren't all devs and so IF it were to become outdated in a year, you can still sell it.

If you pay $500, in a year, it might be $400.  At worst, it'll still run Catalina and do the level of video editing, music editing, browsing, etc... it once did.  So someone will see value in it.

The other thing is if you do the math on the investment, going with something in the 2012 range is VERY close in specs to the 2015.  It's not really the CPU (assuming both i7 quad core) it's more the GPU and it's ability to support whatever Apple moves to.

When Apple moved to Metal, my PC hackintosh card didn't make the cut, but once a card makes the cut, it's good.

The odds of Apple moving to something past Metal (IMO) is slim for a while.  IMO, Metal was a big upgrade.  It's like 32bit to 64bit or non-Retina to Retina.  Apple isn't likely to dump Retina or dump 64bit for 128bit any time soon.

$600 for a 2015 vs 2012 isn't a lot more money.  If it's a 15"" with 16GB, then you're right there in the same price range and that $600 looks like a pretty good deal.

Are you able to get a 2015 15"" 16GB RAM MBP for $600 ??  If so, I'd probably grab it.  Mine was $150 less with less ram and a few dings, so that looks like a deal.  Plus I had to pay sales tax.

Remember, not everyone buying a macbook is a dev, music and video people LOVE mac.  It'll have resale value for a while.

-------------------

One other note: Apple tends to keep the ""Pro"" series going, the ""Pro"" is designed for hard work and people pay a price for it, Apple does tend to respect that a bit more."
augmentedreality,ffabfub,t1_ffa6850,1579731621.0,"One of the things I was looking for was working until Swift 5 came out and I never learned how to update the code on GitHub.

This is one example of recording a video where you have AR items inside the video that you record to disk.

https://github.com/svhawks/SceneKitVideoRecorder

This is an example of using ARKit to see things like a hand and respond to the hand with an animation:

https://medium.com/ar-tips-and-tricks/free-open-source-arkit-super-starter-project-dc020248c360

Here's the problems:

1. the first one is an older version of Swift and I don't know how to upgrade to it to Swift 5.  I asked and people down voted instead of actually telling me how to upgrade.  The code is there, I just only see the header files, not anything written in Swift, so I never did an upgrade before.

2. the second one is large and give a memory related crash on my 2GB RAM iPhone.  So I was hoping for a lean solution to creating high quality graphics and recording them to disk.

Several examples suggest replaykit, but other say it crashes.  The first link worked before and I just need to figure out how to recompile to Swift 5.

Some of the people were pretty rude when I asked a simple question about how to upgrade the code.

Do you happen to know how to upgrade the code in the first link so that it runs on Swift 5?

The other concern is the RAM usage on the 2nd link.  It's too much of a memory hog and I've never leaned out an iPhone app to get it to use less RAM so I really don't know where to start.  It crashes on the 3rd picture scan, but works on the others.

It seems similar to yours in that it see a picture and responds, but this one responds with an AR graphic instead of playing a video.

Reddit is really hit-miss for getting any kind of help, they choose to downvote instead of actually telling me how to compile the GitHub source for use with Swift 5."

It's a ""whatever they have at the time"" deal.  I did a lot of research on these and the break point seems to be 2012.  I got a mis-packaged deal where it was supposed to be a non-retina 2012, but they shipped a Retina mid-2012 instead.

The Retina MBP doesn't have removable RAM so you're stuck with whatever it has, but 8G is working great.

Note: the 15"" has a Quad Core i7, I really recommend the Quad Core i7 15' Retina over other specs because of hyper-threading.

They did performance tests and the difference from 2012 to a few gens later, wasn't much.  So you get:

Retina

Quad Core i7

15"" screen

Better keyboard

2nd display card for external monitors

SSD built in.

You can upgrade the SSD and the card slot can be use for a microSD card with/adapter so you can use that microSD as a backup drive.

Maybe that would be the argument for the web app, why would they pick one and not the other.

I'd group people together, find out who they're suing and get a group together.

Basically it's a game of economics.  If you make every single case cost 100X what it would cost otherwise and make every single case take decades, then they start to see that there's not gain for them.

It fully supports all the latest everything.  You can get cheaper if you don't need the Retina and maybe the 13"".  You can even get a MB with a broken display and a working main part and it'll work with an external monitor.

Someone just posted on MBP where he removed the display from a MBP and hooked it up to an monitor and it works.  So a 2012 MB with a broken monitor should be maybe $200

IMO, the 15"" Retina quad core is very usable because you have 4 cores and hyper threading makes it really usable, the screen is 15.x"" so it's near the same as the new 16"" and the display is great.

As far as time goes, it's really an issue of how skilled you are now as a programmer and how much time you spend on this.  Another issue is quality of tutorials/books.

Do you think that just MAYBE there's a reason that after more than 10 years and several million apps published, that NOBODY made one of these apps?

Competition is always good?  How naive is that?  It's called a race to the bottom.  Apple claims to have 20 million devs, most users download ZERO apps per month.  It's called spam.

If you only want to be on one app store, ok but most of the money is made on iOS not Android.  Android users really don't like to buy things, they like to get them for free.

Most people that made an app, would have been MUCH better of flipping burgers.  That's just the reality of it.

When's the last time you paid for an app?  Most of the money goes for games.  Even IF this idea caught on, there would be 100's of clones before the week is done.

People expect apps to be free, they don't want to pay and they hate apps so they block them.  Go ahead and invest your time/money into building this app, then see how much you end up earning.

Prove me wrong, show some stats where AVERAGE apps earn some real money.  Android has over 2 million apps,  Find 10 ranked below 1 million and see how many downloads they get.  See how much money the rake in.  Now remember that you'd have to beat 1 million other apps just to get to the point where you have 1 million apps doing better than you.

iOSProgramming,ff8fzrb,t3_es36sz,1579676814.0,"1 year to a $200K/yr average isn't so easy.  The truth is that you're going into a very, very competitive environment.  The mobile market place is 10 years old now and it's moved along very quickly.

$100/hr is a US rate and a mid-upper range of pay.  Generally, you take the going rate and 1.5 to 2.0X it to find a rate.  Meaning that you pay your own taxes and expenses so a job that would pay $80K/yr would need to be paid at $120~$160/hr.  So $100/hr is more a US rate for on site dev with fair experience depending on where in the US.

So you'd have to know what you're doing because the difference is that you're not really being paid to learn, you're being paid because you already know (not exactly, but close).

One of the biggest problems with software dev is that you can give the same job to 100 devs and get 100 VERY different outcomes.

I'm actually thinking about doing a YouTube series on this because I've supported myself for 10 years doing this and know a lot of the pitfalls.

I'll give you a preview of one area I'll cover if I go forward with the series:  It's about having a very specialized line of apps that can be modified to meet the customers needs.  Example: back in the day, I was a dealer for an accounting software package that came with the source code so that it could be modified to meet the customers specific needs.  This was a proven product (still sold today), and the customers knew they were getting a solid solution that worked.  The only risk was the mods that you'd do to it, so the risk was fairly low.

One of the key things to understand is the risk that a customer is going to take, as well as the costs.  Full, true custom software is NOT cheap, that's why most don't do it.  Even larger companies have to justify the costs and the risks.

I'm thinking about doing a series on this in order to get a YouTube channel going and I think there's some interest in people going full indie.  It would be mobile focused."

He had no clue what he was doing and locked things down so that he wouldn't lose his job.

He was actually slowing things down on purpose so that he could get the president to invest in a new tech stack that he wanted experience in.  He would write the code so that it would slow things down and then tell the owners that we needed new equipment to make it work faster.

It kinda worked, we got all new servers, but he didn't know how to set them up.

Basically he was using the company to get paid to learn a whole new stack so that he could have a great career, but he just didn't understand the basics of programming.  Screwing up the date and not knowing how to fix it is entry level CS stuff.
