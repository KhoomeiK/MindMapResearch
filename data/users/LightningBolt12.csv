Doesn’t make you sound like any less of an obnoxious elitist lecturing people about stuff they already know. When I see a post and feel the way you do about this one, I downvote and move on because nobody needs to hear me announce it because my opinion isn’t as important as you think yours is."

trees,ff76g0f,t3_ersoms,1579642050.0,"If you’re in a legal state, find carts labeled “Live Resin” or “LR”. Live resin extracts have terp/cannabinoid profiles much more similar to those of the flower they’re made from."
trees,ff763qx,t1_ff6rrbo,1579641861.0,"Like the other guy said, it’s a big machine that grinds it really fine. It’s also different in that it’s gonna have more stems and leaves in it. When you buy an eighth, you usually break it down to fit in the grinder teeth and pull a stem out of the middle of the nug. When you put it in a commercial grinder, you just put that whole nug in there and the stem gets ground with it. And them using bud as good as you buy in prerolls is unlikely. Usually what goes in there is some mix of untrimmed flower and trim that’s the byproduct of trimming flower for sale in jars. I don’t know the exact composition of OP’s joint material. For all I know it’s all well trimmed top shelf bud."
trees,ff759e7,t1_ff6lz3g,1579641386.0,"Almost all prerolls are packed with bottom of the bag shake. Everybody who smokes them knows this and you aren’t the first person to tell them. You’re a guy who smokes Blue Moon lecturing people who smoke Coors Light about how much better Blue Moon tastes.

EDIT: Shockingly, the negative opinion that couldn’t possibly lead to any thoughtful discussion didn’t lead to any thoughtful discussion."
PublicFreakout,ff3ql1b,t1_ff3mmc5,1579546719.0,"It’s not actually that dangerous. Slamming is illegal because it can lead to one in a thousand freak accidents that can ruin a kid’s life, not so much because every slam is actually super dangerous. If you get slammed like this and then stand up, you probably weren’t hurt. If the thing happened that we were worried about happening when slams were banned, he wouldn’t get up. 

Basically it’s illegal, and there was a tiny chance of it being very bad, but it’s not all that common that people get seriously injured even when somebody fails to follow the rules."

unpopularopinion,feiuw54,t1_feifrmi,1579147860.0,"Man, it’s just so weird to me that people have this experience because mine varies so wildly. I’m a daily smoker. On weekends I’m often baked from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed. One month a year I quit cold turkey and the only problem I ever really have with that is getting bored."
magicTCG,fehrr1a,t1_fehqzld,1579122572.0,"Lol okay. They could put a $50 bill in there and you’d bitch about how it’s folded. 

It’s an extra thing to collect. I like that. You don’t have to like every product WotC makes."
magicTCG,fehpbh9,t1_fehp73m,1579121173.0,Okay? I like that. Lots of people like that. Sorry this one doesn’t excite you. I’m sure lots of things WotC does are great for you.
magicTCG,fehbb27,t1_feh5em4,1579113025.0,But it’s a cool promo version.
Spokane,fe0a09m,t3_enj5yg,1578807317.0,Green Nugget on Francis and Lovely Buds on Sprague are my go-to places. Satori at the Y probably has the best selection but I can’t stand the bud tenders there.

Cringetopia,fdntv7d,t1_fdntos0,1578592727.0,Lol you’re welcome to believe whatever you want about my sexual habits. Still a little strange that you’re so interested in how I have sex though. What is it about other people having sex that bothers you so much?
Cringetopia,fdntmu4,t1_fdnthbq,1578592593.0,Why are you so interested in what other people do in the bedroom? How sure are you that if I watched you have sex I wouldn’t think something you did was weird?
Cringetopia,fdnt0ib,t1_fdnsnbh,1578592238.0,"There’s a victim in child murder. There is no victim in consensual fetish play.

facepalm,fdnpcuc,t1_fdnmf21,1578590369.0,"Wrong on multiple counts. My “bone stock 2000 mustang” is [the Millennium Falcon, a 1995 Mustang GT with a cool air intake, automatic shift kit, aftermarket diff, shaved handles, body kit, and scissor doors.](https://i.imgur.com/orxiAGZ.jpg) It’s nothing crazy, but it’s a very fun daily driver, and it’s not bone stock. It was some teenager’s toy before it belonged to me, and before that it was very badly crashed and rebuilt.

Second, I work days now. I did good work, interviewed for an office job in my company, and now I work hours that I love. I also don’t generally hotbox the car *before* work. I save that for after, because my job needs me to use my brain. 

Third, not Alaska. This thing is actually usually parked one month a year for the snow I get where I do live, so I can’t imagine living in a place that gets much more. It’s really, really terrible in snow."

I do this as much as possible to people who park like this.

Edit to reply to edit: “I couldn’t tell what you meant, so I chose the one where you’re wrong” is a creative way of saying “I’m just trying to start a fight.” Go fuck yourself, asshole."

nfl,fddzzft,t1_fddwad3,1578328054.0,"He seems to have a sort on unconscious competence. Like, when Marshawn gives a really simple answer, it’s because even he can’t explain the magic.

trees,fd3s522,t1_fczcsbh,1578161215.0,"I’ve heard enough different accounts of this from enough Cali people I think some places are just weed deserts down there for whatever reason. It’s the same up in WA. Where I live in the Spokane/CDA metro, we have 20-30 dispensaries and about 600,000 people, but my hometown is about 300,000 with easy access to 2 dispensaries. If I want a quarter worth of prerolls in one package, I can get that (not for this cheap tho) but in the Tri Cities, if Nirvana and Green2Go don’t carry what you want, have a fun drive."
magicTCG,fcupe19,t1_fcu5utp,1577985837.0,Which is usually the same thing as being annoying and pedantic.
magicTCG,fcup6aa,t3_eizjvm,1577985714.0,"Depends what you need and what your LGS stocks. You can buy assorted dice online by the pound, but your LGS may also have a bulk bucket of dice. One of the places I go has bulk buckets to use at the tables that you can buy from if you find dice you like. If you need a matching Chessex set, your LGS probably has that for about the same as Amazon. 

A matching set of 36 d6 from Chessex can get a little expensive for what the product actually is, so if you just need some dice to use for counters, I would probably try and find a store with a bucket, shove your hand in there, and buy whatever you happen to grab."
science,fcuh9fz,t1_fcucczk,1577980921.0,"It’s different in the US. Our dispensaries are plentiful in many places and you can’t put weed in the mail like they do in Canada. You’re certainly never going to eliminate the black market, there are lots of gardeners out there, but where I live the “black market” consists of high schoolers and my coworkers occasionally having a couple of extra ounces from a home grow. The only reason to be moving pounds in Washington is if you’re moving them to Idaho."

GlobalOffensive,fck9f7w,t1_fck8xbw,1577720134.0,Then the test was pointless because that’s a stupid question. Sounds like Valve cares about the entire player experience rather than the single tiny facet that the most invested players are being loud about.
GlobalOffensive,fck774l,t1_fck71qr,1577718503.0,And what I’m telling you is that neither chef has access to what they need to make a decent meal anyway because the stove has 300 ping so it’s not really important who’s a better cook lol
GlobalOffensive,fck64a5,t1_fck5zp7,1577717660.0,So as long as you ignore all of the variables that matter more to real-world gameplay you *might* be able to tell a difference?
GlobalOffensive,fck3zd6,t1_fck3dvk,1577715906.0,My point is that it’s impossible to design an experiment where players play a normal game and then make an educated guess at the tickrate without having that judgment be clouded by a million other factors that matter much more to their gameplay experience.
GlobalOffensive,fck2g3i,t1_fck0b74,1577714566.0,But doesn’t that just kind of perfectly illuminate the issue? Everybody just thinks 128=good and 64=bad when in reality there are complicating factors that matter way more and make it impossible to tell the difference.
nfl,fcjzi5y,t1_fcjkglf,1577711684.0,"Lol by “MASSIVE” what you mean is the type of holding that’s mild, incidental, and happens on literally every play."
nfl,fcj9aaa,t1_fcj8v6d,1577680466.0,So they get the delay of game and it’s somehow their fault when the refs blatantly keep them from fixing that fuck up and that’s somehow on the Seahawks? Lol dude okay
nfl,fcj8txv,t3_ehh2zf,1577680169.0,I can’t believe that no call. That was absurd.

nfl,fcirsxy,t3_ehehpj,1577668299.0,Honestly these last few weeks have really felt like the Seahawks has kind of fallen apart and this probably isn’t our year. It feels like these next couple of games are just gonna be fun.
nfl,fc48woh,t1_fc48gce,1577409811.0,Honestly they’re both possibilities. We’ll see.
modernwarfare,fc3ohr4,t1_fc2uto5,1577394661.0,The was a guy on YouTube who only knifed.
nfl,fc3dke2,t1_fc2y33p,1577387431.0,I think this could potentially look like a really good version of Marshawn. When he was with us the season always seemed a few games too long for him and he’d always have some wear and tear issue down the stretch. This is kind of a perfect opportunity to go out there and really exert himself when it matters having not played a whole season with some nagging back injury.
FuckYouKaren,fc30945,t1_fc2mawc,1577378502.0,They aren’t familiar with how soccer reffing works. Not every youth sport has such a robust system for getting people into refereeing at a young age.
nfl,fc0hr8n,t1_fbzwnzg,1577291115.0,Gets the people *goin’*!
magicTCG,fbvoczf,t1_fbvo6zj,1577133718.0,"Yeah, that just doesn’t have anything to do with the rest of the discussion. Fetches being expensive isn’t new. Modern being a rotating format is new."
