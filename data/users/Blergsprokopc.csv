YouShouldKnow,ffv1swa,t1_ffv0g4k,1580253721.0,"They were all born here, the parents/grandparent had immigrated. They were being sent out of the U.S. to marry someone of the same ethnic group and then eventually brought their husband and children back to the U.S. with them once they had turned 18. As for how to combat it, that's tough. Unless you put a ban on all minors leaving the country (which you obviously cant), I dont see any enforceable option, or rather none I would be willing to entertain. Having worked as a teacher, the biggest thing that I have noticed is education. But for the parents as well as the children. The more the girls know, the less complacent they are to listen to a parent tell them to marry young and stay home. To settle. And educate the parents that educated girls are more of an asset than uneducated ones. Just as good as boys. Any ideas?"
YouShouldKnow,ffv00mx,t1_ffutoxq,1580252618.0,"I have three friends I grew up with, in the United States, that were taken back overseas for arranged marriages. None of them had any idea it was going to happen. We got out of school for summer break, and they never came back in the fall. Two of them moved back two and three years later. Married. With multiple babies. Both so depressed I am surprised they didnt waste away. What they thought was going to be a vacation to see family, a normal yearly trip for them, turned into marrying strangers. No more school, no more studying and homework. No more pizza with friends, no more fun. No more future. It happens in towns and cities even in the U.S., maybe even in yours."

This is the one I bought, size 30. It fits a 6 foot tall teenage boy, so it should fit your fur baby just fine. My pup is about 75 lbs, I cant remember her measurements off the top of my head, but shes tall and deep chested with a long back. This also fits my 110 lb lab. So I use it on both of them.  I highly recommend this coat. I use it in snow/rain/cold. And it's easy to get on and off."
dogs,ffufatr,t1_ffuc1v3,1580240747.0,"I can second this. I have an also oddly long dog with a very deep chest and had a terrible time finding a coat for her. Horse blanket style for the win, it's even a little too long which is nice bc it keeps the rain off her legs. Let me see if I can find it in my Amazon history (I bought it a couple years ago) and if I can, I'll message it to you."

dogs,ff0a1qv,t3_er09c4,1579466787.0,"I have 4 dogs. The last two were adult rescues, one was 2, the other 4 when I adopted them. One came from a Korean meat farm and had no socialization when I got him. He wasnt neutered, he marked in the house, he tried to hump my females, and he wasnt house broken because he had lived his entire life in a cage. A very short time later, I cannot imagine life without him and he is the biggest love bug I have ever met. It takes a little work, granted, but the reward is well worth it. Keep in mind the 2 week shut down that is common with rescues, dont get discouraged, and bring that sweet boy home!"
ChoosingBeggars,ff03c0i,t1_fezwgq8,1579464761.0,"If it was a sample dress, like one for people to try on in the store, or she bought it at a trunk sale, it will be dingy. Size 8 is generally the normal sample size in most bridal shops, so my guess is she bought it at a sample sale when the bridal store got new sample dresses in. That would explain why she got such a good deal on it."
