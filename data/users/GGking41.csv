I don‚Äôt know why people are twisting something good he is doing into this
Even if he did only do it for the vegan bucks, one less brand of cosmetics using animal products and testing should be great.... giving those who buy cruelty free more choice should be seen as great!
Unfortunately this is the impression many people (even vegans) have of many vegans- that theyre so judgemental about what everyone else does that it makes people embarrassed to say theyre vegan and hinders the conversation and movement.... because no matter what you do or what steps you take, in those eyes, youre never doing enough."

AskCulinary,feingdn,t1_fehqf8p,1579142635.0,"Ive been mass downvoted before for asking a question that wasnt offensive in any what that i truly wanted an answer to.... it just starts with one person not liking it and the once youre in the negative it gets traction and keeps diving...

AnimalsBeingBros,fdto1by,t1_fdsv28b,1578719564.0,"Start watching the youtube channel birdtricks 
They trained david copperfields birds and breakdown animal training science into things the average person can learn and use
I don‚Äôt have a bird but always watch their videos because the birds they have are just unreal and its amazing how the work they do can improve a birds life and owners relationships witch their birds.
I promise you‚Äôll get something useful from their training videos ti help with your bird and will also really enjoy the videos if youre a bird lover

They even take their birds for free flight... they fly them in a desert or other location and the birds come back and land on their shoulders... its amazing to watch"

Going to the police gives you evidence to support the small claims suit.  So go make a report basicallt detailing what youve said here and showing the text msgs.

To file small claims, just google ‚Äòsmall claims+your province‚Äô and it will show you exactly what to do and the costs involved.  You dont need a lawyer.  Theres a small fee to file but you can include that /ask for that to be reimbursed."
