anime,ffa1m7e,t1_ff99kol,1579726063.0,"One Pace is a fan adaptation that takes the anime and cuts into something way better paced and without fillers. I think most episodes of the anime have been adapted, but there are some that you will have to watch original (they haven't been adapted mostly because the original was fine, it only started getting bad midway through). Also, the first 5-10 episodes are not good representative of what's to come, it starts like a sunday morning cartoon aimed at 10 year olds and suddenly it's the most epic adventure in existence."

SuddenlyGay,ff6mnra,t1_ff6evv9,1579630455.0,"Jumping to conclusions much? You can honestly believe that you can satisfy a woman without licking her. Also most mysogynysts take pride of how great of men they are which includes ""rocking the world of the women they fuck"". It's depressing how every cloud takes the shape of racists and sexists in the eyes of your kind."
SuddenlyGay,ff6m5u5,t3_erv2kr,1579630150.0,"I'm not saying that pussy eating is gay, but just because an act is between a man and a woman it doesn't make it not-gay by any means. Have you heard about pegging? Have you heard about cuckold play where the woman ""forces"" her partner to suck the dick of her lover or eat his cum out of her. Pretty fucking gay. 

Reddit upvotes bad arguments just because they are against stupid opinions way too often. It's annoying."
facepalm,ff65rtm,t1_ff645jd,1579619805.0,"Sounds like some people can't think of a solid argument but can't accept that they are wrong either, so they'd rather make personal attacks in the form of ""jokes""."
anime,ff5hzze,t1_ff4ia1r,1579593754.0,You made a post where you are expressing regret that you watched the most popular shonen in existence and are amazed that someone else is regretting watching the second most popular shonen? You'd think that experience would teach you to not expect everyone to like the same thing.
anime,ff5huju,t1_ff506kr,1579593556.0,I'm honestly surprised that so many people watch it as they do. The source material was by a different person and even the original mangaka was starting to exhaust his creativity at the end. It would've taken a miracle for boruto to turn out better than an adequate fanfic.

facepalm,ff3s8sc,t1_ff3qw0m,1579547736.0,"I think you've witnessed someone pretty fucked up and are making a pretty shallow generalization. I don't think any appreciable percent of mysogynysts, let alone people using the word ""female"", have trouble using the word ""woman"". Why would they? Even if you genuinely hate women, you'd use the word as a slur, like Reddit uses ""old white man"" for instance. What you are saying doesn't really make sense."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff3i93q,t1_ff39lc5,1579541606.0,"Go fucking vote for Yang ffs, not only he's young but he's also focused on the problems that are coming. We knew about climate change, racism, sexism and all the other issues Bernie is talking about for decades. Props to him for voicing them out for the longest time, but the fact that he was right then should be a proof that we should be looking for someone with an eye towards the future. We are shitting on boomers for knowing about all these stuff and are doing nothing but we also know that automation is coming and very few are talking about it. Our generation could end up being just as bad in the eyes of those that are coming."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff3hu5a,t1_ff37mkf,1579541352.0,I wish people were as accepting of these arguments when it came to mysogyny in videogames. Cognitive dissonance like this is helping fill up the trump's ranks. USA deserves senile idiots like Trump and Biden.

pcgaming,ff2iwj6,t1_fezqgaz,1579508147.0,"There's a lot of reasons why this would work and a lot why it wouldn't. Exclusivity isn't the only reason to use a console, by far. I can write about 10 things on the subject and each will take a good paragraph but i think it will be better to focus on one. Xbox is already doing this, with no sign of reverting and they have reverted bad decisions before so we know they are not stubborn. If Sony follows suit it would probably mean that they know it worked for xbox."

anime,ff282ev,t3_eqy2g0,1579496518.0,"My favorites in order

Your lie in April

Oregairu

High score girl

Your name

Boarding school Juliet

Girls in their savage season

Ao-chan can't study (don't be fooled by the first episode, it starts like it will be a self aware echi trash but it turns into a pretty cute love story about two people that are way out of their depth)

This list does not contain monogatari despite the series having two of the most interesting love stories ever told, it's just that they are a small part of a much bigger story so watching it for the romance alone doesn't make sense."

Supernatural, echi, harem - monogatari series


Harem - go-toubun no hanayome

I'm assuming here that you've watched konosuba because most people have

For harem a really different example is oregairu, it's doing everything backwards but it's the second best anime that can have that tag assign to it after monogatari in my book."
NoStupidQuestions,ff25xww,t3_er1vm8,1579494725.0,We don't get spam calls in eu so there's no need to be suspicious of unknown numbers. How that shit is legal in the US is beyond me.
facepalm,ff250ed,t1_ff207il,1579493981.0,"When you are talking about an individual there's usually no need to use ""female"" because you can make a judgement call if ""girl"" or ""woman"" would be more appropriate. When you are talking about something that's about people from all ages ""female"" is really useful. Also labeling people based on their choice of a single word that isn't even a slur is far more telling about one's character than using the word."
Futurology,feyq2od,t3_eqjv4b,1579449126.0,"Steven Hawking set out to prove that time travel is impossible. He eventually gave up and said it's probably possible but you'd need the energy of a supernova. So, that, for one. For something more likely - creating elements. Some elements are only possible to be generated inside the gravity of a star, so you'd need a lot of power to start just getting any material you want. Then you have entertainment - videogames. Imagine a simulation that has an entire galaxy's worth of stuff in it. How much power would you need for that? And those are the things we can envision. I'm pretty sure we'd never be at a point where we say ""no matter how much more power i have i can't think of anything else to do"""

A game designer's main job isn't to explain why his design is fun but to explain why it would sell well. ""Well, this game had this and this and people bought it, so we obviously have to do the same""."
