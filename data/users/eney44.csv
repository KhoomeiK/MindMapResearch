cats,ffb4hpd,t3_esno83,1579751565.0,I have had cats who free feed and never get fat. I've had cats who will eat until they pop. Good luck
cats,ff86jw8,t3_es6j0h,1579667405.0,There are natural laundry softeners you can try for static clothing. Best bet is a humidifier because it helps your skin and breathing. Anything you put on your cat's fur but just make it grumpy because it would have to clean it off.
cats,ff21gd5,t3_er6ky6,1579491238.0,Have you tried raw meat? I have one cat that loves raw chicken and raw beef. I feed her cat food to but it seems to keep the hairballs down. Sorry I don't know the food in the UK
cats,ff218cl,t3_er6mxy,1579491074.0,Isn't that how all the serial killers start? They abused animals first?
cats,ff20zwa,t3_er6rqx,1579490904.0,"I don't think it's mean but if it has to be on a leash, I agree a harness is better. My friend puts her cat out on a harness everyday in the backyard. It loves it."
cats,ff209ah,t3_er6y42,1579490367.0,Oh no! I will say a prayer for you that you find your kitty.
cats,ff1zumc,t3_eqrfxm,1579490074.0,"Yup, it's probably already escaped and multiplied.  I've heard that once you open the package it's non-returnable."
cats,fewbx4k,t3_eqrfxm,1579408128.0,"DON'T do it!! It's a cat lady starter kit! Once you open it , next thing you know, you'll have seven of them."
cats,fewb7of,t3_eqrovw,1579407853.0,"Oh gosh, so sorry. That happened to one of  mine years ago and still tears my heart up. Lucky cat though for having a loving owner. Many do not."
cats,felwe9v,t3_epukyi,1579232609.0,"I think probably the smell of the dye. The only cure is to get fish, chicken, or Miller Moth  dye.    :) 
Hopefully better in a couple days."
cats,felw0m3,t3_epumo9,1579232338.0,Wow that's tough. It almost sounds like he got fixed late with the way he treats the females. If you give him a lot of food  does he get full and calm down?
cats,fe91dgz,t3_eo65kd,1578933153.0,Make sure they do not put the kitten encargo where that it will freeze to death.
cats,fe910n9,t3_eo68zm,1578933021.0,Is it fenced? When I had a yard with a fence I didn't have an issue she would just stay in our yard. I had dogs on two out of three sides. They barked and she got to where she just ignored them. If she wants to jump the fence that's another issue.
cats,fe6g226,t3_enycpj,1578889808.0,"I love that, he's so pretty."
cats,fe6fiyn,t3_enz2q5,1578889360.0,Smart Cat!
cats,fdthyhq,t3_en1aft,1578717018.0,It's cute as a button
cats,fdtgtii,t3_en1xtb,1578716553.0,Oh no! Your cat is turning into a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Is it make like a dinosaur day?
cats,fdtfvct,t3_en2l2n,1578716164.0,"Sometimes they like to do that. I would not. I don't know how bad it is for them but does not seem right. Google the ingredients in see how dangerous they are.My husband couldn't get my cat to quit licking him on the face.  One day he finally just turned, licked her back on the face and it stopped!"
cats,fdiztp4,t3_ell32m,1578454867.0,"My cat loves this video. Not sure if I should get her a TV, or the bathtub full of tissue paper."
ChoosingBeggars,fcjb6yo,t1_fcj4kvh,1577681920.0,That's how she got the bad tat with a bonus bastard child- weird.
cats,fcj9lnm,t3_ehh4rm,1577680694.0,Go to a vet quickly. May be a bad virus in your group there.
cats,fcj97w8,t3_ehg8yz,1577680419.0,"Wow, looks like you were the best owner ever.  Glad your cat was well loved."
cats,fcj91n5,t3_ehg98t,1577680301.0,"One cat I have growls at me when I do her nails. The other could care less.  I would start doing them right away so they get used to it. They are all different. The sooner you gently push her away the better. They are smart, they learn."
cats,fcj8i93,t3_ehge1r,1577679951.0,How wide are they? I bought some for an old cat I had but they were aflimsy mess.  I think building them yourself is a much better idea and shows how much you love him.
cats,fcj7xwd,t3_ehgi1k,1577679531.0,I would gently discourage the licking. One of my cats took a while to stop this. The other never started. Beautiful kitten. Have fun.
cats,fcj73hs,t3_ehgs5j,1577678905.0,It's a hair ball. Give it a couple Temptations brand hairball control treats. Buy them at the grocery store.My cats like those better than the tubes of hairball fix at the pet store.  They are cheap & less mess.
cats,fbzm59b,t3_efc7cb,1577251421.0,Syria because she was a refugee the same time as the people. Thought she was dead on the road. She was just dehydrated and only few weeks old.
