nashville,ffcrz24,t1_ffa6i07,1579806040.0,"> as much as addiction can be considered a choice

I think that is a misconception.

Addiction to the point of homelessness is often self-medicating for a very severe mental illness - Bipolar Disorder (which I have), Borderline Personality Disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD, just to name a few. It's not a choice to want to escape the severity of the symptoms, especially suicidal thoughts and hallucinations/delusions.

These people could be saved from their situation with greater access to healthcare, particularly psychiatric medication and behavioral therapy, but they don't access it primarily because they don't have the money nor the mental capacity to get help.

I'm a strong believer in universal health coverage. While it wouldn't 100% solve street homelessness (I'm not sure there is such a solution), it would drastically reduce and prevent street homelessness.

I'd also be for the legalization of medical heroin, [as was done in Switzerland to solve their opioid crisis.](https://transformdrugs.org/heroin-assisted-treatment-in-switzerland-successfully-regulating-the-supply-and-use-of-a-high-risk-injectable-drug/) In a safe space, under the supervision of doctors, and given clean drugs, people could use and wean off heroin safely. I think that would be huge for our opioid crisis if we focused on practical solutions rather than shame and punishment."

Most of the camping is RV based but I’m sure they have plenty of room for tent camping as well. Not sure where it’s at on the grounds because I’ve always gone with family that lives in the area. You can set up next to your car with a tent and EZ-up I believe. There is no “tent only” section. It’s a pretty small park and not much walking is involved. 

It’s a family-oriented festival, not much for partying. You can bring a cooler with alcohol but I wouldn’t bring a lot of party favors with you because it’s not really that kind of vibe. There is no search on your way in though so take that for what it’s worth.

In the back of the park there are some hiking trails, the longest one is about a mile loop. There is also a disc golf course but I think parking covers most of it.
