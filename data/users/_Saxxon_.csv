ukraine,fel91s0,t1_feiyb6w,1579216708.0,"The best defense of the Soviets is such magnificent ineptitude that they took food out of the hands of starving farmers. Not a good look. Whether it was intentionally perpetrated or not, you'd have to be an awfully dense state official to not see the natural course things would take for a historically problematic area to the Soviet authorities."

wholesomegreentext,fdobee8,t1_fdng0gt,1578602137.0,"He said he was given a purpose. And he was. Can't say it was a good one. Sadly our society doesn't offer many good alternatives for cooperative action in which one is truly needed, short of selling your body for the sake of the military industrial complex."

Can't wait to live in the timeline where having the wrong opinions can get me thrown in a mental facility thanks to the caring overwatch of my state assigned mental health official."

WA_guns,fdhhukh,t1_fdhc4c7,1578422962.0,"I think trying to be seen as 'reasonable' has been twisted into being pliable and given us the nice and soft slippery slope we've all been on a while now. Acting crazy is a good way to get labeled dangerous and disarmed sure, but even being reasonable seems to heading the same way at a slower and more palatable pace, just one regulation at a time. I don't think there is any way to gain anti-gunners respect, in their eyes you're crazy for wanting one period. You're just staying out of view, and hoping they don't come to take your rights through the democratic process in your lifetime."

tinyhouse,fcip6r0,t3_ehcn0b,1577666546.0,"This sounds like exactly the sort of thing I'd want to be a part of. Currently living down closer by DC for work unfortunately. I have a vintage Airstream I've been renovating and planning to live out of but have been struggling to find a place I could keep it in Maryland, and I'd especially love to be located on someones farm, after growing up on one they suit me better than urban life. I really miss being able to help out with animals and farm chores oddly enough haha. I'm just not sure if the commute to work would be doable at all for me.

Edit: Either way, feel free to contact me, I'd love to know more!"

todayilearned,fbyuv86,t1_fby9gpy,1577226959.0,If you believe that you haven't looked very closely at their history. After the fall of the Mongol Tatar yoke Moscow was strong enough to stand on its own two legs and the Russians started pushing eastward. It resembles America's 'manifest destiny' surprisingly closely. Even today they're doing what they can to resettle more ethnic Western Russians into the East.
todayilearned,fbx1fcl,t1_fbwz4hl,1577165679.0,"Yeah, Soviets did the exact same thing with all of their natives but shipped them east rather than west like the Americans."

todayilearned,fbwyjwa,t1_fbwjsm5,1577163017.0,"The Russian empire had been attempting to exterminate Ukrainian language and culture for centuries prior. It has always been a problem area in resisting Russian bases of power. Soviet policy was certainly an extension of that. No one is saying they engineered a famine, thats a consequence of environment and crop failures, but when you actively ship food out of the breadbasket of a nation to the point that the region producing the bulk of the food is starving, it's not a far off conclusion that the consequences are intentional. Matter of fact it pretty closely mirrors the actions of the British in intentionally exacerbating the great potato famine to the misfortune of the Irish."
