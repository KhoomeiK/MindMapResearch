It's dangerous for young children because the honey gets ingested and then it can multiply because babies don't have sufficiently strong stomach acid to kill off the spores.

I imagine a relatively immune system that is enough to destroy any spores you'd come in contact with from honey to an open wound since the spores aren't exactly permeating the stuff to begin with.  It's a precaution you take with babies because their babies and it doesn't take much of anything to kill them because they're small."

Which would dilute MC's connection to Lilith so substantially that it'd be the near equivalent of two people getting together that share common lineage with Genghis Khan.  It's pretty negligible.
