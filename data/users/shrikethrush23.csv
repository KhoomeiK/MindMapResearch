Besides that, you have to come to a place, someday, where you see yourself as you first and as a woman second. I used to pass as cis and went stealth and it fucked up my sense of who I was and made me hyperaware of my body at all times. Learning to practice radical self acceptance and be bold in my non-passing trans butch womanhood and own my contradictions took 3 years of hrt, the love of a fantastic queer woman, and a couple stints of professional therapy, as well as ditching most of my extended family to varying degrees, and surviving several periods of unemployment.

You'll get to a better place. 🖤"

butchlesbians,ff8sfzf,t3_erk5tq,1579694308.0,"The women in my family have short hair and men have long hair. I grew up watching my mom neatly braid my dad's butt length hair every morning before he would go to his blue collar job.

I used to sport a pixie cut before my wife came into the picture, and one thing she loves is long hair. I style it with old-fashioned Groom & Clean from drugstore and pull it back tightly into what I call my wolf tail. From the front I always give myself a really sharp, clean right part. When my hair is down I get called young miss, but when I have it styled like this I get read as male, so mission accomplished.

Having a vaguely native background affects my view on this, but I think correctly cut and worn long hair can be masculine. Example: Travolta in Pulp Fiction."

I told him I wanted to be a woman in a suit when I got married, not a man in a dress. And that kinda screwed the lightbulb in for him.

Being a butch isn't about how others see me. It's about being able to accept my own body and feel comfortable in it. It's about wanting be a human and dealt with on my own terms rather than being an object you can stick a style number on.

My wife is pansexual and gives her read of a dudes attractiveness though, which factors into her approving them as a play partner for me/us."

I always feel like women wish I was a bigger person so they could feel small and stuff, or I get seen as a woman with the wrong part, but in the moment I just really seen and understood in this visceral way, like I was something special and good instead of my usual feeling of being an inadequate mixup.

It's expensive as hell but now I actually look like a guy instead of a femboy who has stolen his boyfriends clothes.

If you have a slim or curvy body, take a look at the women's section of places that sell workwear!

Women who are built like bricks should try out the men's section too.

butchlesbians,fck7p4p,t1_fci3r0g,1577718884.0,"It started with me asking her to initiate sometimes . . . Which she did . . But every time she tried to initiate I was either basically asleep or not in the mood. Then there were times she would go down on me but she didn't know what to do so it took immense mental effort for me to get there. Once I grabbed her hand, put it in my mouth, and showed her how to use her tongue like I was teaching Helen Keller about water she got the idea, but then her libido dropped because her insurance stopped covering her SSRI. 


The conversation has basically settled into where are now, which is that it's on me to set a mood by cleaning the house and making her feel special, get her in the mood and top her, then I get to be pleasured.

The latest development is me teaching her to run her hands over my body and be sensual, not just go straight for the crotch.

What sucks is that if I put on makeup and lacey shit she is at my throat *pronto*. But when I act and present myself comfortably (masc) she is clueless what to do.

It's like because she's pan and has never had a girlfriend before her wiring only works with the feminine-acting person on bottom."

When she has tried to top, it hasn't worked well. She is a perfectionist and getting me to feel good is hard.

I think a lot of femmes just don't know how to go about fucking their butch. Try still sorta being in charge when you bottom, giving her instructions and feedback and telling her how good she is making you feel and that she's hot, etc.

We have gotten to the point where she feels comfortable ""fucking back"", where as long as I initiate she is comfy switching a little in the middle of the sesh."

malefashionadvice,fc5muxt,t3_eg12m0,1577461743.0,"I would need photos in clear, natural light to give specifics, but I have general advice for you.

I am a person with mixed sex characteristics (intersex). I have identified and lived as both a man and a woman, and my personal sense of style has been the foundation of me feeling good about myself.

I think the first thing you should do, if you want be a masculine man with an androgynous aura, is to pay attention to the way you move. Men and women move differently.

The way you dress needs to correspond with the way you move and the way your body is shaped. Before you get into brand and tone and fabric, you have to drop the idea of being androgynous for a photoshoot where you can pick which muscle groups you have active.

Get into martial arts. Learn to be aware of your positioning, how you step. Look at yourself a lot. Look at the way you smile, all the ways you smile, how you move your eyes.

I present as a man, but my movement and expressions tell a different story because I was raised to be a woman.

Wanting to be a macho dude and be perceived as androgynous will require you to become a master of seeing. Much of what determines how you are seen is invisible. Two men can wear the same suit, and one with be seen as *man in a suit* and the other will be seen *a man* because the second man is very comfortable and the suit itself loses primacy to the body its form describes."

BDSMAdvice,fc5emw4,t3_eg0x4t,1577455324.0,"Huh. As a Dominant, if you came to me and told me you want to be completely overwhelmed and fucked senseless, I would just take that under advisement.

I'm also a sub, and I've been in a similar scenario to what you describe. It's a fuzzy memory - I wasn't really there, and it was a primal scene that I hadn't expected to lose and be ravished in - but I think I would be able to use that memory and an assortment of toys and rope to simulate the experience.

You might try suspension. Part of intense group stuff is your frame of reference shifting from external to mostly internal and relative to your partners. Use that plus blindfolding and earplugs/earphones to leave you with just touch and taste, add some toys that can do their job hands free, and you should get there with one human."
notliketheothergirls,fc1l1h6,t1_fc1k400,1577321949.0,"I'm working on that, unlearning parts of female socialixation and making gnc friends and guy friends and working on my voice etc.

I tried being a guy for 2 years in college but . . I dunno I just got treated as a trans guy e.g. Guy LiteTM and ended up dating a trans dude which was actually really helpful. He was 5'0 and feminine but still Seemed Like A Dude and that helped me identify there that there is *something else* beyond presentation that affects how others treat you.

I have been learning to take up space, speak with a willingness to argue, and also like . . relax and kinda give less of a fuck about constantly trying to be what others want me to be.

I am pretty solid in my identity as bigender at this point and I have noticed that people have been initially defaulting to addressing me as male now but they still correct themselves and then treat me as a woman after hearing someone else adress me as female or seeing me interact with a woman (women tend to, uh, treat me like a friendly dog.)"

The fact that you are shy about this is very cute and feminine! Blush it up! It's normal for girls to be shy about their parts. There are some girls who only want it in the dark or blindfolded or only if they can wear assless panties so they can hide their strapless. Which is fine!

You don't have to get over this to stop feeling bad about it. I'm not over my wife commenting on how dainty my body is while I'm balls deep, or how my tall trans girl partners wishing I was bigger and broader so they could feel small. You bet I have shame!

*But my body is my body and I am who I am.* You're a woman with a strapless a petite person like me would need two hands to handle. That is who you are. And you can just as feminine about that as anything else. You get to decide how to approach this thing.

Yes, this requires mental strength and spoons and validating support. But this is a path you can take."
