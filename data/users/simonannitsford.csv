books,fd4hm1v,t3_ejwden,1578167523.0,"I was always reading as a kid, especially from 9 or 10 when the books I could understand were way more interesting than kids books (they'd be called young adult books now). I read even more as an adult, but now with the advent of Kindle, etc., I read even more (I'm 55 btw). Lifelong sci-fi and horror fan, and latterly (last 15 years or so) historical fiction. A good book is like watching a hi-def film for me."

cats,fcppz4u,t3_ei7ums,1577869626.0,"We've been a multi cat family for all the time my wife and I have been together (we both had cats when we met), and currently have 6. My advice is to remember, in the nicest possible way, that she's a cat, and a pet, not a small furry person."
cats,fcmqjqj,t3_ehtaum,1577787274.0,"Being a multi cat family for may years, I've finally figured out that cats don't necessarily want to be in or out, they just want to be ABLE to go in or out."
