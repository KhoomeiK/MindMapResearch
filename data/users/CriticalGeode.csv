AskReddit,ffvpzlk,t1_ffvpqrf,1580270067.0,">Well. There are a few texts that explain both my position about god and the why I believe.


>For ""why I believe"": ""My Religion"" of Miguel de Unamuno. It has like 3 pages so if you don't read it is cuz you don't wanna, that's on u.


>For ""what I believe in""(or how is what I believe in): ""Septem Sermones ad Mortuos"" of Carl Gustav Jung. It is short too, 13 pages. But its dense as fuck. I don't know how is it called in English.

>I'll try to explain it here tho:

>First of all: using the concept of a Deity (not God as the Catholics show him) as a kind of creator/being that transcends all, there is actually *no need of proof* that god exists, but to understand that *everything is ""God""*. If a Deity created all, all is within the Deity, everything would fall in the Deity. As a Latin phrase says: ""vocatus atque non vocatus deus aderit"" (call it or not, God is there). From that being said: the proof of a deity is right here. The sun above us, the water we drink, the air we breathe, the emptiness of the space. I don't need a proof because *I am a proof*. This argument is based on what I said at the beginning: Concept of a Deity that transcends all. At the same time: since this deity transcends all, it can't fall in the ""good or bad"" duality. Hence there is no ""Devil"". Devil is what we call to what goes against our nature, to what opposes to our existence, or what goes against our (physical) rules.
(I really recommend to read the Jung's text before asking why I say this)

>Secondly: What you ask: ""How do you believe in a being you can't physically see?"". Well... how do you believe in your conscience if you can't see it? How do you know that everything you see/feel isn't just an invention of your brain? (And if only seeing is what you ask, why do blind people believe in the reality?)

>Its cuz believing is an *act of faith*. I don't believe in ""god"" because of a logical reason, but that *I want him to exist*. *I want god to exist* (in Spanish it also would be ""I like him to exist"" or ""Quiero que exista""). That is the beginning of all. I believe that everything I see/feel is real because I want it to exist too. Based on what I want/like I create my way to think about reality. There is no logical explanation to why I believe in him. The logic is an attempt to explain it, but the reason isn't logical, it essence is not logical. Yet, I don't blindly believe. For me, the proofs of the existence of god are as ridiculous as the proofs that he doesn't. If god exists, then my life is an endless search for him. An endless attempt to find him. In the past I would spend hours thinking about how god works. I hope to never stop seeking. And if anyone ever tries to convince me of why he doesn't exist, I'll laugh, because at the same way, I don't know if he exist.
*I just want him to*. (""My religion"" of Miguel de Unamuno)"
