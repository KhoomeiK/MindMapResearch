I don't believe I can properly express how much I disagree with your shitty representation of Americans, but I'll give it a shot.

We are one of the most charitable countries in the world by many metrics. We have our problems, but this isn't one of them.  The US is largely pro-vaccine and most Americans rejected for what passes for Conservatism in the US, last election.

There were shortcomings with how specific administrations react to natural disasters in the  US, but that's not all Americans like you're saying. People were signing up to give a room to families during Katrina. FFS, we just lost 3 firemen who volunteered to go Australia to help them out.

Americans largely want to help the needy. This is why Bernie Sanders is leading in Iowa and why people wanted him in 2016. This is why some people want Warren, or Yang as well.

Support the troops, but not the cause is fine. Keep in mind our military is 100% volunteer and the war you see on the television is not the war they experience boots on the ground. It's about saving innocent lives, and making sure your brothers leave the same way they arrived. Yourself as well.
