Seconding saving it but realistically OP seems at least static and effectively retired. The real question is what they want to do besides having an emergency fund and savings.

vegan,fdx8xd6,t1_fdwmoky,1578766425.0,"I mean by some metric almost everything is selfish. It just comes down to how much so and how society judges it.

Everyone picks their battles and a life with little or no resource consumption is less enjoyable. Everyone makes their own decision and is limited by outside factors.

Heck using the electricity to be online right now is selfish (even if ""green"" there are still costs). You just make your personal decisions and also try to reconcile them with others."
