I‚Äôm currently living in Saint-Petersburg, I do have some things that I don‚Äôt like there but mostly it‚Äôs just great, I have everything here, all the food that I could think about, parks and squares, a little bit of public zones (even tho it‚Äôs really not much compared to Europe) and a lot more ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù things. I‚Äôm not saying that outside Moscow and Saint-Petersburg is a wonderland, it‚Äôs just not and it‚Äôs mostly garbage, but not everything here is shit like you are saying, you are not even living there so anything you‚Äôve said means nothing at all. And what was that about Stalin? Stop using your dumb pseudo-psychology shit, it just makes you look like an idiot. Every decent human being knows that Stalin is worse than Hitler. I don‚Äôt even want to talk about any politics, I‚Äôm just talking about life inside my city that is in Russia"
