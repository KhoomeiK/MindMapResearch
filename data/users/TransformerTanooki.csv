funny,ffdfxzz,t3_esymjp,1579820053.0,I have done something extremely similar except with a 5 lb weight a puley attached the the rafter in the garage. The weight would lay flat and be attached to the cable with a hook. I stood on the weight and managed to make it up to the rafter. Now I was about 12 at the time when this happened. And I lost my Ballance fell backwards and landed on my back on the ground just in time to see that weight drop on my head right above my eye. This all was going down at a friend's house at about 3 am Friend goes grabs his mom they get a hold of my dad he'll be there in the morning because it's not to bad even though I have a gash on my head. Don't remember if there was bleeding or not. So I get bandaged up and go lay down and my friend introduces me to [Strange Brew](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oMI23JJUpGE). Damn good movie. Bought a copy soon after on VHS and I still have it. So dad comes and gets me in the morning and then we go to the doctor and he glued my head back together. Said I couldn't go swimming. Didn't listen though. But all turned out fine and I don't even have a scar anymore.
