BipolarReddit,ffdfiw4,t3_et0poj,1579819803.0,"It's kept me pretty sane for the past 3 years, but I can't tell you much because I haven't tried all the other ones."
BipolarReddit,ffdf95f,t1_ffdc8im,1579819640.0,I felt like the hypothetical fetus was more important than my overall health and I had no say in the matter. My Bipolar I is so bad I spent three years trying to fix one full blown mania and psychosis episode. I would chose my overall sanity over a fetus every time.
BipolarReddit,ffd0tst,t1_ffbjpnq,1579811189.0,I rather not go back because I felt like she didn't care about my well-being. The doc even suggested tampering me off all my meds if I was preganant. I chose the clinic because they accepted Medicaid patients but I didn't realized they worked for a larger Catholic hospital network. I do realize I have to see a pdoc soon once my scripts run out.
BipolarReddit,fctkdyd,t3_eieyol,1577946430.0,"For the longest time I had the symptoms of major depression since high school. In between these pouts of depression were weird moments of productivity and high energy. My close friends would joke that I was on drugs in high school (I was a clean teenager).

Years latter...after getting high with a one-night stand I wondered what good would an anti-depressant do for me? I went to a doctor and she gave me some anti-depressants. Then one day still on anti-depressants I woke up and it was so AMAZING. Then I got voices and strange thoughts in my head. But I was doing so good at life. I had ironed all my jeans and dress pants. I had the energy to exercise. I was being so productive at work. There was a moment of realization that I might die, while in the mist of editing my plan. Thank goodness I drove myself to the hospital and admitted myself to the ER."
BipolarReddit,fctiudz,t3_eisy1p,1577944774.0,"It's not a good idea to experiment with your medications on your own. I see that you are having bad side effects from the drugs and that is a good reason to change your medication around. Go to your doctor or a new doctor and introduce the idea of tapering off your drugs. If you are not careful, you can relapse and end up in the hospital with another increase to your medication. And that regardless if you have a strong support group."
depression,fct3lgk,t3_eiqkvo,1577931990.0,I spent several years all over the place with no direction. I got a wake up call when I ended up in the hospital one night. Don't be me.
depression,fct2qoi,t3_eiirtk,1577931349.0,"You have a huge variety of skill set and hobbies, regardless if you suck at them. If they make you happy then do it. If you don't right now, put to the side and come back to it when you can."
depression,fct27vw,t3_eiqud7,1577930967.0,Hey there don't be too hard yourself. Do you have any plans for this new decade? Computer games you want play? Movies you are looking for?
depression,fct1nbp,t3_eioypk,1577930549.0,"Thank you for sharing. People who give you advice care about you, even if they don't seem to help. You have to be the one who finds out what works, be it medication or lifestyle changes (hobbies, diet, change of thought)."
depression,fct0d81,t3_eikk9a,1577929613.0,"I advise you change your relationship with pain. There is pain which is the physical sensation of distress that happens as the result of something. Suffering is the story you tell yourself about the pain. I urge you to consider that, “pain is inevitable; suffering is optional. Which means if you distinguish between pain and suffering, change is possible. Maybe the next time you feel pain acknowledge it and be consciously aware on how it affects your thoughts. 
The quote: “life gives you pain to make you stronger”, fails to consider that pain can cause a chain reaction that perpetrates negative feelings  and more pain. This will not make you stronger or resilient, so let me call BS on this controversial quote."
depression,fccygad,t3_egwv1r,1577604155.0,"I think it was the best when my ex broke up with me. He had severe depression to the point he wasn't showering regularly and would occasionally avoid my texts for days. I think he sought help and he's been with gf for 2+ years. It still pains me to this day and triggers my depression when I think about it. It was probably really difficult for her to break up with you. I don't want to be a mood killer but dating someone with depression is really hard if you don't have the experience or tools to deal with it.

I would advise you get help first before committing in a serious relationship."
depression,fccwkgz,t3_eh08dm,1577603513.0,I stay up all night to avoid waking up and facing another new day
depression,fccvln6,t3_egz2kx,1577603176.0,"Even though it's sarcasm, it's good to be able to find humor in this situation"
depression,fccv9ca,t3_eh2g5i,1577603055.0,"I never thought as a kid I was going to have multiple addictions, end up in a psychiatric ward, drop out of college and be on several medications. Shit happens. But it's not good to dwell on the past."
depression,fccu3wb,t3_eh28p1,1577602654.0,Friends and family care and will listen to a point. It's not your fault but it's just not healthy to pour all your emotions and problems on a single person. That's why I am stressing you seek out a therapist. They are trained professionals who know how to handle conversations and provide worthy feedback.
depression,fccrmun,t3_eh15k7,1577601821.0,As someone who has depression and friends who have depression sometimes it's not healthy to lay down your emotions and problems on friends and families. Sometimes other people problems can weight someone down. Instead speak with a therapist because they are trained to handle these issues. If you can't then seek out free group therapy sessions from hospitals or local NAMI chapters.
depression,fccoxi8,t3_eh1hgi,1577600922.0,"I want to give you a virtual hug and tell you to stop listening to that voice in your head telling you these terrible things. We are our worst critic which can be a good or bad thing. Right now it's bad.

I have PCOS too. I'm fat and hairy XD. I also have a lot of health problems because I didn't take good care of myself when I was younger. I thought I was going to die alone and didn't deserve nice things like a significant other as well. So I let myself go and entered a lot of bad relationships. 

I spent a lot of time single, and took that time to learn how to love myself. And when you are ready you will find someone who cares deeply for you as you do for them. Be careful because it's not healthy to rely on someone for your own self-worth.

Start accepting your imperfections because no one is perfect. Then start giving genuine compliments to others, and you will find that act of kindness will build your confidence up."
depression,fccjglt,t3_eh170w,1577599097.0,Live so you can give the middle finger to depression.
depression,fccie33,t3_egz2ss,1577598739.0,On bad days I get out the bed because I'm angry that depression is back to f$%k with me. I take a shower and I'll brush my teeth as my way to give them the middle finger. Depression grows stronger the more power and control you give it.
depression,fccgzm1,t3_egz4nv,1577598278.0,"Yes, because sometimes I hate myself and I don't deserve nice things. Other times it's a bright shining thing that makes me smile."
depression,fccghli,t3_egzqgq,1577598122.0,I did this to myself once when I wasn't myself and felt disconnected from my body. I hurt myself so I could feel grounded and acknowledge I was real. I'm glad you had the ability to stop yourself from going too far in the act.
depression,fccf1kk,t3_egxcz7,1577597651.0,"I have had major depressive disorder since I was a teenager. On my third year in college I dropped out because I was turning into an agoraphobic, had daily crying fits and had weekly panic attacks. I cannot tell you the multiple times I've broken in tears at doctor offices, grocery stores, friend's houses, on the phone, and in parking lots. But I sought out help and it's the best thing I ever did. It was a hard road because I went through multiple doctors and a handful of therapists. I still get miserable and worst during the holiday season but I'm so much better than when I first started. Though I still shop for groceries at midnight to avoid people XD."
ADHD,emf9w0d,t3_bk1h1a,1556903604.0,"I got off my ADHD meds for several weeks because of health insurance problems. It was really bad, because my anxiety, depression, and ocd came back. That was partly because of withdrawal and because the meds help with self-control and emotional regulation. At week two, I was still feeling terrible. It began to get better around the end of week 3, but my problems were still there just less severe. But by that time my insurance issue got resolved."
