It's not a straw man at all. I'm literally just copying his argument to (1) show that it can be applied to any change and (2) to show that it's really not that great of an argument.

If I go buy a pizza and a day later they're giving out free slices, don't you think it would be selfish of me to go back and ask for a refund? Just because something is free now doesn't mean that anyone who paid for that thing in the past should be compensated. It just doesn't work like that. And if I demanded that no one gets free pizza unless I'm repaid for mine I would be seen as incredibly selfish and immature.

I think you're forgetting just how bad Bush and republicans like him are about it. Trump's not at that level when it comes to evangelical pandering. I'm not saying he didn't need their support to win and I'm not saying he doesn't pander to them at all. He did need their support and he does pander to them from time to time. However, he didn't completely dedicate his campaign to religion the way Bush did. His brand wasn't ""the Christian candidate"". Trump's brand was ""the nationalist candidate"". What really determined his victory wasn't the evangelicals. They would have voted for the republican regardless. What tipped the election in his favor was the rise of the alt-right, which was a younger, *less religious* and more racist branch of the republican party. Trump has a massive chunk of supporters who hated everything about Bush, the Jews, and their ""globalist agenda"". The typical Bush-era republican worshiped Bush and loved the Jews and all things Israel.

&#x200B;

> The only thing I can think of that maybe you feel like he’s less religious because he acts like a cunt on Twitter, otherwise no idea 

His behavior is another thing that is far less religious than a normal republican, but that's not all I'm talking about. I'm talking about the fact that he didn't completely direct his message specifically to evangelicals. Hell, I know multiple atheists who voted for Trump and I don't think there was any way they would have voted for a republican running a Bush-style campaign. The alt-right was a new brand of conservatism that relied far more on nationalism than religion. It's a branch of conservatism that a non-religious person could get behind. They needed to be nationalistic and racist, but not religious."

JoeRogan,ffeg9gk,t1_ffedgh8,1579846839.0,"True, but I think he only chose Pence as his VP because he wanted a more establishment running mate, and the large majority of the establishment republicans were the religious extremists like Pence or Cruz (Although, I hear he almost chose Chris Christie which would have been a much less religious choice).

&#x200B;

Choosing Pence might have helped secure the Evangelical vote, but let's be honest, most of those people were voting red no matter what. Both major parties have groups that vote for them almost universally. In order to win you have to focus on getting votes from people who would normally vote for the other party or just stay home (which is why I think Bernie needs to be the nominee). Trump was able to do that with his alt-right supporters. It was like he started a new brand of conservatism and all of a sudden people like Milo Yiannopoulos and Candace Owens (who were not even politically active before the rise of Trump) were the new faces the right. A whole new generation of younger, less religious conservatives appeared out of seemingly nowhere, and I think that's what really tipped the election in Trump's favor. If Cruz were the nominee he would have ran a typical evangelical-based campaign, the alt-right movement would not have taken off nearly as strongly as it did, and Hillary might just be in the White House.

&#x200B;

I agree that Trump couldn't have won without his evangelical support, but what I'm saying is that he didn't spend the majority of his campaign pandering to them and telling them that Christianity was under threat. He might bring up Christianity from time to time but it's never been front and center. He focuses his campaign much more on immigration, the ""threat"" of left wing politics, and ""making America great again""."

&#x200B;

Republicans like Bush ran campaigns that painted themselves as the only option for Christians. He used fear to make evangelicals feel as if Christianity was under threat and that he was the only ones who could stop it.  It was to the point where many of his supporters didn't view other Christians as ""true Christians"" if they voted against him. Trump also used fear, but his campaign relied more on scaring people that immigrants were taking over and portraying Trump as the only candidate willing to keep them out. Bush-like republicans try to send a message of ""I'm the only choice for real Christians"", whereas Trump-like republicans try to send a message of ""I'm the only choice for real Americans"".

The number one thing I was referring to when I said he's moved the party away from religion is his alt-right support. Maybe I'm wrong, but I've never really viewed the alt-right as religious.

I mean, when I think of Bush-era republicans I think of Evangelicals who have been brainwashed to love the Jews, but when I think of Trump-era republicans I think of racist alt-righters who have been brainwashed to hate the Jews. What's up with that? I really don't think Trump's alt-right supporters were big fans of Bush. They probably think he and the Jews are responsible for 9/11 lol."

AskAnthropology,fcaydm1,t1_fcasvsm,1577579058.0,"Good points, but I should rephrase what mean a little bit. I generally don't consider two populations to be the same species unless they reproduce with each other *in the wild*. Tigers and lions have the capability of reproducing with each other, but it has never happened without human intervention. We might as well say they ""can't"" reproduce with each other due to allopatric speciation. Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans did reproduce quite often.

Personally, I would be fine with labeling these as subspecies. It doesn't mean we have to change their names and it doesn't mean we have to talk about them any differently than we do now. When I talk about Neanderthals I almost always specify that I'm talking about Neanderthals. Just because I consider them a member of our species doesn't mean I have to talk about them any differently. They are still a distinct group that deserve their own name.

>We should not even mention other domains, that routinely exchange genetic material between each other, even across kingdom boundaries.

Now this is where I totally 100% agree with you. The biological species concept certainly has it's limitations. I just wasn't thinking about all of that when I commented because we're talking about anthropology so I was more referring to how I define ""species"" when it comes to sexually reproducing organisms. The only limitation I mentioned was with fossils because that's the biggest limitation of the bio-species concept when it comes to animals, but there are more limitations when you try to apply it to *all* life. The biological species concept starts to fall apart when we talk about lifeforms that do not reproduce sexually. A different concept of species is needed for asexual lifeforms and lifeforms that exchange genetic material through conjugation.
