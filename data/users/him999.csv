It obviously varied vastly from shipwright to shipwright and port to Port. Not all shipwrights would have direct access to all materials in their area and thus production cost could be much higher. I don't know where my numbers fall in the cheap - expensive range."

WTF,fejgvts,t1_fej74o4,1579173669.0,"People have full on blacked out and ended up in entirely different states. My SO accidentally took 2 in a night and wanted to go home to her hometown. I had to physically block her from leaving the house and get her to lay down to sleep. She could barely keep her balance while trying to stand up. Ambien and the likes are very dangerous if not taken properly.

Edit: to add, we live 1300 miles from her hometown."
lockpicking,feiehg8,t1_fei8ux8,1579136629.0,"The short answer is it would be a very small chance. 

The dispute would be well documented by the bank and the card issuer (visa, amex, master card, discover). The business wouldn't have much of a leg to stand on if the card issuer found that the business should refund a customer their money. The business (and merchant bank) has a fair opportunity to provide evidence of receipt and evidence that the customer is not entitled to a refund. If they fail to do so the merchant bank will refund the customer their money. If they do respond and provide the proper documentation that proves the customer is not entitled to a refund the customer will of course not receive a refund. 

The worst that could happen is you are refunded the money by the card issuer, they investigate and find you are not entitled to a refund after the fact and they take their money back. This could be due to new evidence showing you aren't entitled and so forth. If you cancelled the card in the meantime the issuer could possibly come after you for their money as you are now in debt to them.

Most companies would never put you in a situation like this though if your product arrived broken. Usually they would replace the product and file a claim with the shipping company if insurance was on the package."
lancaster,fehrmqc,t3_ep5ugy,1579122504.0,"T mobile has great service in the area. I do lose connectivity in some buildings while my SO (Verizon) does not. Conversely, this happens to her in other buildings and not me. I will say, T mobile is GREAT in urban settings but it does not have nearly as good of rural coverage as Verizon by any means. My SO is from a small town in the mid west in the middle of bumble fuck nowhere and Verizon and US Cellular are the only two reliable networks in the area. If I get about 30 miles away from the interstate at any given place in Iowa I lose coverage on T-Mobile.

I would take a gander at Speedtest.net's coverage maps. They give you a decent overview of expected coverage (your milage may vary)."
mildlyinteresting,fefoc0p,t3_eou3j2,1579060758.0,My city still has some of the old hitch posts around.

AskReddit,fd42dqf,t1_fd3635k,1578163731.0,"If you became an electrician or plumber in pretty much any market you will be in high demand. We have a deficit of both (more so carpenters). They are both solid careers and if you play it right you can definitely start your own company pretty successfully. I know a few people who have made a LOT of money off of the two paths. 

Obviously the bubble may burst at some point but we will always need them. That market will never disappear. I think an emerging market may eventually be electricians who specialize in home automation and tech (imo idk of any in my area)."
movies,fd40y7m,t3_ejw22q,1578163385.0,"My favorite part of this movie is that the trailers portrayed a completely different movie in my head. It gave very little away. I never thought half the shit that happened in that movie was going to happen going into it. The US is so hell-bent on spoiling our movies before we get to watch them.

The trailer gave me just enough to say ""what the fuck is going on?"" But not enough to figure any of it out. No relationships were established, no real character traits established. Everything was left to be developed during the movie."

funny,fc3wems,t1_fc3kazg,1577400354.0,"Pearl River Bridge Golden Label superior light soy sauce is really good imo and is usually found in any Asian grocer (at least in my area this is true). (This is my go to for general cooking as it is versatile)

 Best US made soy sauce imo is Blue Grass soy sauce. It is made in Kentucky with 100% US grown soy, red wheat, limestone and spring water. It is fermented in bourbon barrels to give it a fairly unique taste and smell. It is aromatic as well due to being aged 1 year minimum in the barrel. 

Another amazing one you can find in an asian market is San-J Tamari Gluten Free soy sauce. It isn't intentionally made gluten free as a marketing tactic, they just don't use wheat like most soy sauce companies do. It is rich and flavorful due to the larger amount of soy beans. It allows the food flavors to shine through a bit more IMO.

Kishibori shoyu is also wonderful. It is made in 100 year old barrels in a traditional manner. I haven't found it on shelves in the US but you can order it online. Best used raw but you can still cook with it if needed. It's more on the mild side. It also contains no preservatives, additives, or alcohol. Just good, traditional soy sauce."
