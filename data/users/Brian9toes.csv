     If your able to break it down and transport yourself then this should cut your cost by 35% or so. Let a professional set it up!"

billiards,fe3h5gg,t1_fe3f4b4,1578849217.0,What are they asking for it? Usually nonames are a dead giveaway! Gonna cost you 500 to move and set up unless your familiar with disassembly and assembly of pool tables!
billiards,fe38eek,t1_fe3487c,1578846901.0,They use a honeycomb cardboard they use instead of slate in a lot of cheaper pool tables! I forget what they call it
billiards,fe35u6s,t3_enjw31,1578846202.0,Did you check to see if it’s real slate? The way it is in garage it looks like they carried it out in one piece. This makes me think that isn’t slate! If I am wrong someone will correct me!
billiards,fe2djqr,t3_enjw31,1578837213.0,I wouldn’t mess with that unless they they were giving it away! Skeptical if that’s even slate under there!
