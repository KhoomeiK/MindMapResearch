That, or they do it for internet points. That's where most of the hate for EA came from, people realizing the ""updoots"" and gold (edit: thank you, kind stranger!).you could get from it."
StarWarsBattlefront,fel24h5,t1_fekqk63,1579212407.0,"Yet still the most worked-on era since launch.
That also doesn't dispel the fact that there are plenty of heroes already existing that need work, as well as other more important fixes.

This community seems more fixated on ""new"" content than the actual playability of the game"

I have to ask, have you ever looked into the facts that build these conspiracies before dismissing them as ""neo-nazi rhetoric"", because the majority of people I've talked to with a similar opinion have been so pre-programmed by modern society and media as to associate any criticism of Jews, their religion, or their state with swastikas & tiny moustaches, they do just that."

Not everyone has to ""flip-flop"" from one conspiracy to the next, especially if it's a conspiracy they firmly believe in.

Tons of people are obsessed with JFK or 9/11 or Epstein, how is this any different?"

In short, you can't pick and choose which cultures you want to police based on where they live or how they look...

And some may argue that being in the U.S. makes them have to honor our culture, but it clearly doesn't. America is full of people who could care less about American culture, and are often quite misogynistic themselves."
