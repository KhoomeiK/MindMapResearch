So no breeding. More to OPs question tho, calico isn’t a breed, it’s a genetic mutation of fur pattern and color"

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff4i2xy,t3_erl15e,1579564138.0,"I’ll never be a parent out of choice but I still couldn’t imagine doing shit like this to my own kids. Forget about the idea of making a regular ass family moment into some cheap ~viral reaction video~ for a second and it’s just a jerk turning an exciting moment for his daughter into him yelling at her making her feel stupid on camera for being a thoughtless kid who made a mistake. Maybe if dad wasn’t so busy looking through the lens he could have participated in the situation enough to realize what was about to happen with her shaking it around. But no, make this terrible memory for her instead! Great job everyone"
