dankmemes,fctd8fl,t1_fctcaij,1577939594.0,"Yes but it only holds true in an economy for growth exceeds the workforce, currently, we get about 4% a year of immigration while our economy only grows 2%. That's just not enough. If we get our economy up to 4% which last year it did becaues of trump (i don't support him but the economy is the only thing I approve of that he does and how he handles very hostile foreign govts like N Korea) then I support larger Immigration. If It were up to me, I'd allow no more than half of the percentage of growth in immigrants, so 1% immigration a year basically of our population which we have 1.18 million immigrants turn US citizens last year which is good but we had 6+ million get green cards to live and work here which is not good. This is all not accounting for outsourcing jobs which is a big thing although international companies do outsource to the US but at a much lower rate. I think if we only allow 1.5 million immigrants in each year we'd be in a really good spot. With all the extra tax from the ~4 million jobs we could go and help the countries that are sending us so many immigrants. The banana repulics are a prime example. Honduras has a GDP of 22 Billion, or ~3,000 per capita. If we spend just 50 billion in foreign aid  every year for 3 years (which is a lot i know) where we build up infrastructure and support a different administration, not only would it lift the country out of poverty, in 10 years they can pay it back plus interest PLUS, the relations between the US and Honduras would basically be super tight in the future cause we would be the countries and culture's saving grace. Like how the French Helped the Americans in the revolutionary war, we'd be the same just as long as a dictator doesn't take over in 10 years after we'd be internationally speaking best friends."

dankmemes,fctd8fl,t1_fctcaij,1577939594.0,"Yes but it only holds true in an economy for growth exceeds the workforce, currently, we get about 4% a year of immigration while our economy only grows 2%. That's just not enough. If we get our economy up to 4% which last year it did becaues of trump (i don't support him but the economy is the only thing I approve of that he does and how he handles very hostile foreign govts like N Korea) then I support larger Immigration. If It were up to me, I'd allow no more than half of the percentage of growth in immigrants, so 1% immigration a year basically of our population which we have 1.18 million immigrants turn US citizens last year which is good but we had 6+ million get green cards to live and work here which is not good. This is all not accounting for outsourcing jobs which is a big thing although international companies do outsource to the US but at a much lower rate. I think if we only allow 1.5 million immigrants in each year we'd be in a really good spot. With all the extra tax from the ~4 million jobs we could go and help the countries that are sending us so many immigrants. The banana repulics are a prime example. Honduras has a GDP of 22 Billion, or ~3,000 per capita. If we spend just 50 billion in foreign aid  every year for 3 years (which is a lot i know) where we build up infrastructure and support a different administration, not only would it lift the country out of poverty, in 10 years they can pay it back plus interest PLUS, the relations between the US and Honduras would basically be super tight in the future cause we would be the countries and culture's saving grace. Like how the French Helped the Americans in the revolutionary war, we'd be the same just as long as a dictator doesn't take over in 10 years after we'd be internationally speaking best friends."

So, in terms of short term, no 69% is not good, but white people do 82%, if a surgeon has an 82% success rate, they still probably aren't that good of a surgeon.
