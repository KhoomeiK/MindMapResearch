I saw him on a club tour about 6 months ago, and I've noticed the name on a lot of random festival lineups

the typical club tour shows are quite a bit different than the elaborate multimedia experiences many have seen on the internet (look up [Alexandra Palace](https://fourtet.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-alexandra-palace-london-8th-and-9th-may-2019) [show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxV8ys_N_TA) right now if you don't know what I'm talking about)

No lights, screens, lasers, etc. Just him on a standard table with a couple of desk lights and some ferns. I'm not even kidding, the stage setup was literally a couple potted plants at each side of the table. At a few strategic moment he'd grab his desk lights and turn them upwards and outwards toward the crowd instead of pointed down at the decks. that is it. He didn't even use the actual stage (and this is a venue that holds like 1000-1200+ people), they setup his DJ table right on the floor IN FRONT of the stage. it was ultra-low-key and super bass heavy, not like the dreamy ethereal stuff he brings for the festivals"
nottheonion,ffdde9i,t1_ffd9zxp,1579818527.0,"haha that reminds me of a story. 

I used to work in medical records at a clinic. As a local ""partner"" clinic, we could access records at the local hospital remotely from our clinic, so we could check on our patients that had been admitted or in the ER. When we import those records into a patient's chart at our own clinic, the pages must be exported from the host system like you are printing to a virtual printer, and thus they are marked with ""Printed by"" and the initials of the Med Recs employee who did the export/import. 

Well one day, someone (100% it was our idiotic bird-brained nurses) accidentally printed some patient records on prescription paper in one of the doctor's offices. I got a half dozen urgent msgs from our IT dept and Clinic Operations Manager absolutely freaking out at me for unauthorized access to prescription paper and chastising me for unauthorized access to a a printer in a doctor's personal office and asking me why I did this and how I got access and all that. 

They are fucking idiots and even after explained the whole thing and why my initials were on the pages they still had to do a big investigation and made a huge thing about it. I know it says ""printed by night_owl"" but that doesn't mean I actually printed those pages and they thought I was just stupid and fucked up and refused to admit it.


My boss came and talked to me and was like, ""This is very serious, you need to take this investigation seriously"" even afterward and they got upset that I wasn't concerned at all. I was like ""I told you what happened, I didn't do anything wrong you are looking in the wrong direction""  and they still insisted on interrogating me. I was completely confident that I did nothing wrong and actually remained completely calm and dismissed their concerns and that seemed to make them even more upset that I wasn't taking their investigation seriously. I was like, ""again, your 'investigation' is a pointless waste of time and I know what happened and I've already explained it repeatedly in detail, I can even demonstrate for you what I mean if you'll come to my desk for a minute"" but they didn't even really bother to check out my story,  they managed to interview staff and worked backwards and eventually came to the same conclusion. Then my boss was like ""good news they've cleared you, you are not in trouble.""

 If he had reacted violently, the only story would have been that a violent homophobic black man (and muscular former pro athlete no less) who was given the gift of a hollywood career, threw it all way because he couldn't resist his violent tendencies and beat up an innocent wealthy white man just because he was gay and flirted with him.

They'd have treated him like a snarling pit bull and the pile-on probably would have come from all sides and left him out to dry—the racists on the right get their ignorant racist myths validated, and the progressives would have turned their back on him in droves because of the homophobic allegations.

nottheonion,ffdaaoz,t1_ffc9i7k,1579816532.0,"I worked at a non-profit where something similar went down.

I was not privy to all the backroom negotiation and backstabbing that went down, but for some reason, there was clearly some commotion and bad feelings. 

Basically one of our upper mgmt announced a (relatively young, early) retirement for later in the year, then un-retired and went a very long vacation. Then she came back and immediately retired on short notice. 

I got the impression that she had just tried to hoard some PTO in the last couple years and wanted to cash it out to the max of the organizations policy. But nobody had ever done it as a sort ""runway"" for early retirement so HR tried to change the rules to stop her after-the-fact, even though she had already done everything by the book and all the paperwork was already completed.  


The end result was that it just delayed finding her replacement by months since she was still technically employed they couldn't post her position for her or hire a recruiter, and this organization was already notorious for taking months to fill even ordinary entry-level position because such a byzantine HR structure (and being a not-for-profit the funding decisions require months of  committees and board meetings to approve anything more than $100). Also, her dept had to operate leaderless for several months—fortunately she was a good mgr and her staff were well prepared to handle things. 

But basically it was a case, ""Hey you can't do that! you are abusing the system""

""this is precisely how the system was designed. by you""

""grumble grumble well we didn't think you'd actually use it like that""

""but there is nothing that says I can't""

""well not if i have anything to say about it""



Ultimately, the HR dept wasted thousands of dollars of the orgs money trying to keep one person from setting herself up with a nice severance package when she retired, even though she'd worked and sacrificed for years to get herself in that position with careful planning.


postscript: it worked out for her in the end. her husband already retired and got into BBQ/smoking as a hobby so they decided to start a small part-time business together doing BBQ catering and afood truck and they are making great money and seem happier than ever and the only problem they have is selling out of food faster than they can cook it."

- 35. Aren’t the non-woven polypropylene bags sold as reusable bags by many retailers as much of a problem as the lightweight throwaway bags they’re replacing?

>No. Once these bags have been reused a couple dozen times their impact is less than that of the many more lightweight plastic bags they’ve replaced. They carry from two to three times as much as typical throwaway plastic bags. The lightweight bags often need to be doubled for strength. That’s not a problem for the reusable bags. 

That is from [City of Bellingham's site](https://www.cob.org/services/environment/Pages/plastic-bag-ban-faq.aspx#4) about their ban on plastic bags that went into effect in 2012.

I live in Bellingham now a lot of people from ""the county"" (i.e. everywhere else in Whatcom County except Bham) complain about it all the time, but I think the effect has been significant and very visible. By visible, I mean that I strongly believe that it has had a very significant impact on litter. I feel like it makes me hyper-aware of white plastic bags I see littered everywhere in other cities because I'm not used to seeing them around my home town very much. 

But it may be the biggest effect it has had is on people's habits. I notice so many people simply use less bags overall, even in situations that are exempt from the ban (like carryout food). They aren't subbing a reusable plastic bag for a disposable plastic bag for the small purchases that routinely get thrown into a plastic bag or two at the grocery or convenience story. they are choosing to <gasp> simply carry a few things in their hands or throw them in a purse or satchel or backpack or cross-body bag or whatever. 
 

Also from the FAQ:

- 34. What is the purpose or end result of this legislation?

>The fundamental goal is to reduce the use of throw-away plastic products, particularly lightweight plastic bags, which are a litter problem and escape into our waterways and oceans where they are harmful to animals and may enter the food chain as they degrade into smaller and smaller – but still plastic – pieces. Paper is organic and does not present similar problems. But reducing waste means cutting down on the use of paper bags, too. That’s why the City urges all retailers to encourage their customers to shop with reusable bags.

So I think it works and I don't think the shaky pessimistic math justifies the wastefulness it is just rationalizing"

""I don't remember seeing a bunch of TV ads"" is not necessarily ""poorly advertised"" I think OP was more looking for films where the marketing and the final product didn't quite line up, the book didn't match the cover so to speak.

- **Fight Club** - I think the people who put together the trailers and ads didn't get it at all, a big woosh. as if it was *actually* a movie about fighting clubs

- **Idiocracy** looked idiotic and stale, but was actually quite insightful and prophetic. The characters are dumb, but the movie isn't. 

- **Bongwater** was marketed as a typical stoner/drug dealing shenanigans comedy, but was actually a very poignant and thoughtful character study of disaffected and wayward young adults in transitional periods of their lives. Drugs don't really play that heavily into the story except that the protagonist sells weed so there are a lot of running drug jokes and it explains why he spends so much sitting on his couch but it is not Pineapple Express.  It had a great ensemble cast and interesting quirky characters. It was funny and thoughtful. The romance angle is not corny, it is realistic and frustrating. The characters all felt like flawed and tangible three-dimensional people that come from the real world. I think the marketing dept only read the title. I guess maybe people were fed up with angsty and verbose GenX slackers after films like Reality Bites and SFW and Clerks.

- **The Princess Bride** - I remember I wouldn't watch this when I was a kid, I thought it was cheesy movie for little girls. Only little girls watch movies about princesses getting rescued by and subsequently getting married to the men in tights who rescued them. The only thing that seemed cool was that Andre The Giant was in it but that wasn't enough.

For starters, it is simply the concept of hospitality. If I invite someone over for a dinner I'm not gonna be like ""make sure to clean up after yourselves before you go!""  But it depends. Casual dinner with good friends, getting take-out or something like that it is norm to help out in the kitchen and wash your own plate and utensils at least. 

That said, I have zero expectation for cleanup, except that maybe you should use some sense and put what you didn't eat in the trash bin and don't clog up the sink with a pile of dirty dishes covered in uneaten food. I don't know why people think that is a good idea. You pile in some plates and then the sink cannot even be used for cleaning until you take them back out so you might as well just leave then on the counter next to the sink instead of IN the sink. But I digress...

Second of all, I'm worried people are gonna fuck up my shit. Stay away from my well-seasoned cast iron pans, thank you. Don't put that really expensive wood-handled chef's knife to soak tip-down in a metal mixing bowl you fucking dolt. No, that hardwood cutting board will get ruined in the dishwasher and it doesn't even fit so stop trying to wedge it in there please. And then half the time I have to go back and re-do everything while they leave with a self-satisfied smile.

Third, there is typically not really much room for people helping with dishes. I've only got one sink. More than 2 people in the kitchen and we are just bumping into each and in each other's way constantly it is stupid and inefficient and a waste of time. So having one helper is nice when you have a lot of dishes but anyone else I'm telling them to have another drink and get out of my kitchen"

BELLINGHAM, Wash. -- As a progressive-minded city nestled where the Cascade mountains reach the sea, Bellingham, Wash., has long been looking to scale back its contribution to climate change. In recent years, city leaders have converted the streetlights to low-power LEDs, provided bikes for city employees and made plans to halt the burning of sewage solids.

But while the efforts so far have lowered the city's emissions, none have come close to erasing its carbon footprint. Now, Bellingham is looking to do something that no other city has yet attempted: adopt a ban on all residential heating by natural gas.

The ambitious plan set for consideration by the City Council in the coming weeks had already prompted vigorous debate over how much one small city should try to do to avert climate catastrophe, at a time when the federal government was putting less emphasis on halting the trajectory of rising temperatures.

""What we've got here is a conversation that is taking place in living rooms, in board rooms, in City Councils around the country,"" said Michael Lilliquist, a Bellingham council member. ""What is the proportionate threat? What is the proportionate response?""

Natural gas has long been embraced as a cleaner alternative to coal-fired electricity. Years ago, power companies began phasing out coal, and natural gas emerged as the nation's leading source of electricity. But natural gas offers its own troubling contribution of greenhouse gases -- including methane leaks from natural gas infrastructure -- and its production has begun to clash with environmental goals that now include not only cleaning up pollution, but also slowing the rise in global temperatures.

In places like the Northwest, which benefits from a robust network of hydro-powered electricity, the move to detach from natural gas may be within reach -- but at a cost.

Bellingham has become a growing destination for those looking to escape Seattle's growth and cost while still wanting a similar base of progressive politics and environmental activism. It is a destination for outdoor enthusiasts who backpack the wilderness of the northern Cascades and kayak along the barnacled shores of the San Juan Islands.

Yet the move to phase out natural gas is not without opponents, even here.

The business community has mobilized to fight the plan and to establish a $1 million campaign to tout natural gas, especially as Seattle, 85 miles south, also begins discussions about its reliance on the fossil fuel.

Berkeley and Beyond

Along with other cities around the world, Bellingham adopted its first climate action plan more than a decade ago. Since then, the city has reported a substantial drop in emissions -- eliminating more than two-thirds of the government's greenhouse gas contributions compared to the year 2000.

Mr. Lilliquist said the city's plans had put it on a path to carbon neutrality -- zero net emissions -- by 2050. While those plans may have seemed ambitious at the time, the unfolding global climate crisis has prompted city leaders since then to try to move the timeline up to 2035 or even 2030.

Last year, Berkeley, Calif., became the first city in the country to ban natural gas in newly constructed low-rise residential buildings. Dozens of other cities passed or proposed similar bans, including Seattle, where an increasing number of new homes have adopted electric heat. Proponents there argued that a ban on natural gas in new construction would lower the city's emissions by an estimated 12 percent over the coming three decades. The City Council had not yet acted on the measure.

Bellingham is talking about going even further: banning natural gas heating not only in new construction but also in existing homes and businesses.

The city's climate task force explored a number of ambitious targets, including requiring conversions to electric heating when people purchased existing homes, said Dr. Charles Barnhart, a task force member and an assistant professor of environmental sciences at Bellingham's Western Washington University, which has one of the nation's oldest environmental colleges. It also explored requiring transitions on all structures as soon as 2030.

In the end, the task force scaled back a bit. Natural gas cooking appliances would still be allowed, but owners of homes and commercial buildings would be required to convert to electric heat-pump technology -- or something equivalent -- by 2040, with the possibility that the city could accelerate that to 2035. The measure under consideration would require electric heat conversions earlier than that when replacing heating systems.

""This is about going to where we didn't go before,"" Mr. Lilliquist said. ""We've grabbed the less controversial and low-hanging fruit. This fruit is higher on the tree.""

It is unclear whether the proposal has enough votes to clear the City Council. Mr. Lilliquist said he would first seek a series of meetings to get feedback from the public.

Opponents have questioned the value of focusing on home heating systems instead of other alternatives for reducing emissions.

Todd Myers, who focuses on environmental issues at the conservative Washington Policy Center, said the city could get much more climate improvement by investing in things like planting trees and capturing methane gas at landfills.

""They are saying we are going to bypass all the low-hanging fruit and climb to the very top of the tree,"" Mr. Myers said.

A $1 Million Campaign

Bellingham's task force found that the average cost of installing an electric heat pump system was about $6,200 to $13,100 more than a gas furnace.

Ronald Scott Colson, a financial adviser who lives outside of Bellingham, said he had been converting to electric heat to fulfill his commitment to migrating the planet away from fossil fuels.

Mr. Colson said he had spent about $28,000 to install a forced-air heat pump system in 2018. He is looking to spend about $8,000 to change the heating for his home's hot water to heat pump technology. With human life on Earth at risk, Mr. Colson said, the globe needs catalysts for significant change.

""You've got to have a place where people step up and say, 'Let's show the world we can do it,""' Mr. Colson said.

But Mr. Colson also acknowledged that such a conversion might be a heavy burden for those who did not have as much income. Without federal tax credits or other ways to offset the cost for lower-income people, he wondered if a local mandate might have negative impacts.

Mary Kay Robinson, a real-estate agent who works with the local chamber of commerce, said that instead of a natural gas ban, she would like to see the city expand a program that helped people assess their properties for energy efficiency improvements and offered incentives to make needed changes. She said a mandate to convert home heating systems could create housing affordability challenges.

""What does that do other than we get bragging rights, but we're burdening people who can't afford this?"" Ms. Robinson said.

The energy industry has also stepped up efforts. A Northwest coalition has been organizing a $1 million public-relations campaign to promote the benefits of natural gas, with a focus on its reliability. One graphic produced by businesses including Cascade Natural Gas, the provider in Bellingham, suggested that a full conversion from natural gas to electricity, including solar panels, could cost a typical homeowner as much as $82,750, something Mr. Lilliquist labeled propaganda intended to frighten people.

Still, Mr. Lilliquist said that as council members considered the conversion proposals in the coming weeks, they would have a discussion about incentives or other ways to mitigate costs, which he said would almost surely be less exorbitant than the industry's claims.

""The real number may be one-tenth that cost, but that's still a lot of money for most households,"" he added.

The Green Frog has new owners and is now called the Firefly and still does similar stuff, but more versatile music and DJs and general entertainment. The Makeshift still does cheap shows, same as ever. Alternative Library has on and off but I think they are homeless now?  There are sporadic shows elsewhere like Tha Outlet on Cornwall put on by local promoters and artists (Metanoia, Milk + Honey, etc) for house and bass music too but not really reliably outside of the buffalo or festie crowd. We got Thundercat to come back but the best venue they could find was the Bham Golf and Country Club lol.  It is really sad these days. If it wasn't for Craig and the guys at the Buffalo really stepping up their game and being aggressive about trying to bring in bigger acts this town would be so fucking stale right now. 


The Mt Baker Theater is still run by old people who only cater to the other old people on the board of directors so they only book artists for people over the age of 60 and under the age 13. About once a year they permit someone good to enter the building when they are approached by bigger promoters who pay cash to rent the building, so basically the same as it has been for 20+ years."
LetsTalkMusic,fcwn1zj,t1_fcwl3cw,1578030310.0,"I never thought of it that way but I guess it does have a little bit of a Elton John vibe, at least on the slow and ballady side of John's catalog.

I guess if put to the question I'd say Elton was pretty steadily straight pop music with and rock and roll influences and forays into rock and roll at times —I mean you'd be a fool to say ""Crocodile Rock"" is not a rock song lol, but something like ""Daniel"" you'd be a fool to say it rocks. Sees like his albums typically only have a couple tracks that would really be considered ""rock"" in a vacuum but that's just my take, I'm not a student of his entire catalog"

Your complaints are easily mitigated, and always have since the app was first created, and I think it would be a shame if you discouraged people from using a great app that I've found to improve my life just because you can't be bothered to actually look at the setting before complaining about it on the internet"

comics,fcv6kif,t1_fcuocpw,1577995696.0,"It is so highly customizable that is really should work for everyone's preferences. Your complaint is probably one of the main issues they sought to conquer a long time ago, and I think they did. it has options to disable temporarily (like for an hour or two), when using specific apps, when using fullscreen apps, etc.
 

You can tailor it to follow the sunrise/sunset (based on your location), or whatever schedule you are on (which was fucking amazing for me when I was working graveyard shift), so you can also just have it disabled during the hours that you would normally be doing color-sensitive work.

I love it. So whenever I'm gaming or watching a movie or editing photos it automatically turns itself off, and does a gentle fade so it doesn't shock your eyes and you don't even notice it going on and off."
SeattleWA,fcv4xke,t1_fcuvmms,1577994729.0,"> Republican state senator Steve O’Ban calls it the CARE act “...to allow for the appointment of a Court Appointed Resource Executor (CARE) officer for certain individuals who are incapable of caring for themselves as a result of a mental health disorder or substance abuse disorder.”

maybe i'm just being cynical (or maybe I'm just not naive either?) but this seems like a typical republican approach to solving a problem:

- a cheesy euphemistic acronym in the title, one that typically states the precise opposte of the actual intent (CARE Act, eh? what is it exactly that we care about in this case?  property or people?)

- tough talk about solving crime and homelessness at the same time, although of course there is...

- no accountability, or funding, or any type of plan for how this will actually work in the real world

- when this inevitably fails to make a significant dent in the issue they can just blame dems and say it is another example of the government wasting hard-earned taxpayer money on leeches who bleed the rest of us dry and demand tax cuts and/or privatization"
