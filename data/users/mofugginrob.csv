I download games to my friend's Switch from my account. Friend can now play those games any time from their account on their Switch (without even being online, I believe).

I add dry hops to the serving keg before I transfer to it. If you want to take your beer off the hops after a few days/week/whatever, you can just transfer to another keg again.

I mostly only use the floating dip tubes in the kegs I'm fermenting in, so I only have a few of those. I just use regular dip tubes in most of my serving kegs. I have a plate filter too, though. So I don't have to worry about sediment in my serving kegs.

The Tilt Hydrometer is a bit expensive, but it is very useful.

I only mentioned the Fermzilla because it can basically function as a keg, but with more space. With it, I can do a full 5 gallons and have a full serving keg instead of 4 gallons. The only problem is that it's huge and barely fits in my kegerator."
Homebrewing,ff9wp17,t3_esguvx,1579723151.0,"A few things that may help you out...

You may want to look into spunding to carbonate. Putting a spunding valve on your gas in post while your beer is fermenting and setting it to \~15 PSI (will vary depending on the style you're going for) will carbonate the beer with the CO2 that is naturally produced by the fermentation process. The only problem is that this isn't great for Belgian style beers that rely on phenols and esters for their character because fermenting under pressure suppresses them.

I use a check valve on a ball lock fitting instead of a blow-off tube if I'm making a beer that I don't want to spund.

&#x200B;

There are hop filters (basically just a stainless mesh tube) that are much better than using hop socks. I've gotten them as low as $6 each, so they can be had at decent prices. I tie mine to the keg lid with a piece of silicon tubing.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if you're using them, but there are floating ball dip tubes that are basically a stainless float ball attached to a piece of silicon tubing which replaces a normal dip tube. This will let you draw the beer from the top of the keg, which makes transferring to your serving keg a little easier, plus you'll know when it's time to cut off the transfer when it starts clogging and gets really foamy.

&#x200B;

You seem to be doing just fine, but those are some suggestions that might make some things a little easier. A lot of beer making is style-dependent, so advice can vary depending on how other people make their beers.

&#x200B;

I mostly ferment in kegs, myself, and have been for a while, so there may be a thing or two I might forget since it's so automatic to me now.

&#x200B;

Oh, and I ended up buying a Tilt Hydrometer. It will tell you the gravity from inside the fermentation vessel, so you'll have a good idea of when your gravity is stable and fermentation is complete. I also bought a Fermzilla. People seem to hate them, but I haven't had any problems with mine."

Gravity readings are simple. They have beer dispensing guns you can hook up to the post. I just use one of those.

For dry hopping, I use a hop filter. They're stainless mesh tubes basically made for that. I sanitize an empty keg, attach the filter to the keg lid, then purge the keg with CO2. Now you've got a purged, empty keg with your hops in it, waiting for transfer."

You need headspace, so you likely won't get the full x gallons of your keg, but I preferred closed transfers and losing a bit of beer for the convenience. I use a Fermzilla for fermenting now, which gives me a full 5 gallons with plenty of headspace.

You definitely want 2 kegs (or more lol) if you're going to ferment in the keg. Otherwise you're dealing with both krausen debris at the top and yeast sediment at the bottom. I use a floating ball dip tube in the fermenting keg and transfer to another keg to help deal with that. It's pretty obvious when the debris starts coming through in the transfer.


It's actually pretty simple to ferment in kegs, and with a beer gun, you can even bottle pretty simply if you need to use the keg again sooner rather than later."
