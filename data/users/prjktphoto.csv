synthesizers,ffhnxhg,t1_ffg21wq,1579944556.0,"I have everything on my desk (limited space)

I raised the monitor shelf on my Ikea desk as high as it would go while still letting me fit my monitor, got a couple of monitor riser shelves from my local office supplies store and placed all my synths on those - Skulpt, Craft 2.0, Volca Nina’s and MicroKorg.

Underneath one of the risers I attached my Presonus ADAT converter with heavy duty mounting tape, with just enough room underneath for my Mbox 2 Pro and Beatstep when put away.

Underneath the other riser is my NI M32 keyboard when it’s not in use, and my Scarlett 18i8 fits sideways just to the side.

I have no room for anything else unless I put it on the top shelf.

cyberpunkgame,ffh8a8l,t1_ffgcxhp,1579925954.0,"That’s one positive to consoles.

Fixed hardware, maybe a revision or two, and fixed OS designed purely for gaming, and they’re around for a few years at least, so by the end of their run, devs REALLY know their way around the architecture and how to optimise.

Whereas on a PC, variables are almost infinite, have to support at least 3-4 generations of GPUs from at least two manufacturers, and within those generations you’ve got multiple models, and then each end-manufacturer of those models make their cards different to each other... and that’s just the GPU, let alone CPU, chipset, storage controllers, peripherals and controllers, and unrelated hardware/software that may or may not cause issues with other programs, all on one of several multi-purpose OS’s.

Tbh after writing all that up, I’m not even sure why I bothered sticking with PC over consoles... oh that’s right, cost, performance, aspect ratio and I can use my PC for other things.

The last two written by Kevin J Anderson and his Herbert’s son... well they ended the story, but I don’t quite like how - obviously they went off the notes they found after Herbert’s death, but they lost the plot a little on the side stories, and referred too much to events and characters from the “prequel” cash grabs, that just kept coming and to be honest, are trash."
