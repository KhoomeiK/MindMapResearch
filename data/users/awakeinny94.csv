Speak to a therapist if you can. If you can’t, sit down with your dad and boyfriend and map out a plan on how to respond to some of her requests. When to say no and how to say it. If there is a family counselor at the hospital ask to speak to him/her and come up with a plan together. Having a plan sort of helps. You don’t have to cut off all communication but mapping out a plan together will help."

I grew up poor and could never visualize making a decision that would have me living broke. Fast forward to my late twenties. I was miserable, hardly sleeping in spite of my great career and comfortable pay. I passed on a huge career move that would have secured me for life, resettled in a different city so I could pursue what I love. I earn nothing but sleep like a rock. The fear of being poor is not enough of a driving factor for everyone. It certainly isnâ€™t for me."
