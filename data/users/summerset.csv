From Rivermont, go all the way down Elmwood Avenue, it dead ends right into this place. 
Here’s an article on it:

On one hand, you don’t want to start a whole debate with everyone who says that, and on the other you want them to stop saying it because it’s bullshit.

I wish there was some concise reply to make your position known, and also to shut them up without any hurt feelings."

Does your fam know you are an atheist? If so, I would hope you could find other ways to spend time with them instead of church.  Not judging, but I hate seeing any atheist perpetuating the nonsense of religion.  
Again, not judging, I don’t know your situation or anything about your family, I’m just curious."
