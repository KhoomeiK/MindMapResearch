canadacordcutters,ff9hnr4,t3_esc8vi,1579713224.0,"Firstly, don't buy the official Amazon adapter, which is Ethernet only. For about the same price you can buy a [third party adapter](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B078MNW25Q/) that will also give you a couple of USB2 ports and one USB power port. I have that one and it works perfectly at 100mbps, which is way more than you need for full 4K streaming. With the $2 coupon applied it only costs $16.80 CDN right now. There are other slightly higher-priced adapters from other vendors which offer three full USB2 ports in addition to the Ethernet connection.

Second, these Ethernet adapters are 10/100 speed (which is more than fast enough) but you can pay more and get a gigabit Ethernet adapter instead, although the USB2 port connection used on the Firestick will limit the maximum speed to 450-480mbps. That said, gigabit is overkill, I stress again that 10/100 is plenty fast enough for the most demanding 4K streaming.

You can actually get faster burst speeds with Firestick WiFi than with even a gigabit wired connection, but I find that there is just too much latency for responsive operation. I find the direct 10/100 connection to my Firestick makes navigation snappier and Kodi in particular is much more pleasant to use."

Everybody I've seen complaining about this problem are using older 5.1 receivers with SPDIF inputs, not HDMI. AFAIK this issue doesn't affect more modern 7.1 receivers, which by definition don't use SPDIF connections (SPDIF doesn't have the required bandwidth so it's limited to compressed 5.1 audio).

Regarding the ESN, I found where to enter it in the Netflix Addon, but I'm not sure which one to use for this. I have several ESNs that are registered with Netflix... my 2011 vintage Sammy TV, a Sony Smart Bluray player, the Firestick 4K, etc... should I be cloning one of these?

**UPDATE:** I cloned the ESN from the default Netflix app on my Firestick 4K, and it seemed to work for about ten minutes, but then it started throwing error messages again, although this time about connection errors, so I don't know if it is solved or not. After a couple more tries it started working again, so it might have just been an unrelated connection glitch.
