CasualConversation,ff8vpm2,t1_ff8k425,1579697685.0,"I’m a millennial and my first computer was completely DOS based. I specifically remember getting windows but still had to manually boot it. 

I’ve had a record player, a cassette player, a CD player, and iPods/iPhones. I got rid of my landline less than a year ago. (But that’s mostly because they work with the power out and Florida being struck by hurricanes is a thing.) 

My first car had only a radio until I replaced it. My current car still has a tape player. 

The invention of ebooks has been life changing for me because I’m a voracious reader. 

Cell phones became a common thing during our life time. 

Millennials remember because we experienced both. We grew up without the technology and learned to adapt to it. 

It bugs me when older folks are like back in my day...bitch it was almost identical when I was a kid. You aren’t special. Stop using “it was so different when you were younger.”We learned and adapted. It isn’t our fault you didn’t or wouldn’t."
WrestlemaniaPlans,ff8geto,t1_f9vdfwu,1579677324.0,"Busch Gardens is cool and the easiest to get to. If you want to go, they will be doing their food and wine festival at the time. 

Daytona is over 3+ hours away by car. Kennedy Space Center and Cocoa Beach is 2.5 hours by car. Disney is 45 minutes with no traffic up to 1.5 hours with traffic. Universal/islands of adventure, and seaworld are also 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. 

There is no way to get to any of these places besides Busch Gardens without a car. Public transportation in Florida sucks in general and there is no links between counties. 

Events happening in the parks around your visit to Florida.

Busch Gardens - Food and Wine Festival (Saturdays and Sundays only)

Daytona - no events

Magic Kingdom - Disney villains after dark (select nights)

Epcot - Flower and Garden festival

Disney Hollywood Studios - new Star Wars Land

Animal Kingdom - new Pandora land

Universal - Mardi Gras (ends April 2nd)

Islands of Adventure - no events

SeaWorld - seven seas food festival/concerts (Fridays - Sundays only) 

Kennedy Space center - Meet astronaut Marcos Pontes (April 1-7) and Meet an astronaut J.O. Creighton (April 8-13)

April 9 - tour of Space Shuttle Atlantis with Launch Director Mike Leinbach, who gave the final “go” for the launch of 37 space shuttle missions, including the final flight of Atlantis STS-135.

Maybe because dates aren’t exact and depend on weather, SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch a Crew Dragon spacecraft on its first test flight with astronauts on-board to the International Space Station and SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will launch the U.S. Air Force’s third third-generation navigation satellite for the Global Positioning System.

tumblr,ff78g91,t1_ff74618,1579643179.0,"Only as far as how my parents survived when I played the holy trinity of “oh god so awful for the first few years” of instruments. (Violin/viola, flute/piccolo, and clarinet) 

The flute/piccolo thing is because I had to either practice outside or put my dogs outside for me to practice inside. It hurt their ears. And I’m not hurting any dog no matter how annoying their owners are. 

It’s really easy to make a trombone annoying, so that easily wins for my brother’s instruments.

My mom only played piano and clarinet so her choice would be easy too. 

And well my dad has no musical ability at all. What so ever. I guess he could attempt to try to make one our instruments go, but I’m not sure he would be willing to put in the effort when he could just sing Bob Dylan songs worse than Bob Dylan."

I worked 20 years in public service and taught every person I saw the laws and how to identify fake service dogs. I also taught every lyft and Uber driver the laws too, and normally gave them cards to help them remember. 

The problem with fake service dogs is the only person who can determine a fake service dog is a judge. They are also (I’m pretty sure) the ones who can ask more than the 2 questions. 

Question # 1, is that a service dog?

Question #2, what tasks do they preform? 

Fake service dog handlers will normally flub the second question. 

Where when I’m asked I start rattling off the many many tasks my dog can do. (Like alerting to anxiety and panic, grounding me multiple ways, bringing me out of a flashback, getting trusted help if he can’t help me out of my mental state, alerting to doorbells and knocks, standing between me and a trigger, reminding me to take my medicines, and bracing for multiple reasons.) 

An emotional support dog can’t do most if not all that crap. And the only two animals covered as service animals by the ADA are dogs and miniature horse (which can only be used for blind people.) 

Oh and if someone comes in with one of those cards that say the dog is a service dog, 99% of them aren’t. Because real service dog partners know there is no agency that registers service animals."

Take the couch cushion off as many couches that it takes to cover the area you want the fort and lay them down. 

Next position the chairs on each corner of the cushion pile. 

Before placing the blankets get out either Christmas lights or a lamp that uses batteries. Next get an extension cord and run it into the soon to be fort and position your lights where you want them.

Now the hard part. Collect as many clothes pins as you can find. Grab your lightest blankets and/or sheets. Take the largest blanket and put it over the top of the fort. This will be the base for all the other blankets. Next start draping the sides using the clothes pins to connect the side blankets to the main blanket. It gets a little tricky but just keep going until you get the right balance so the main blanket is taut in the middle and the three side blankets still cover all the way to the floor. If you have extra clothes pins you can make a towel door way but it’s very optional. 

Lastly collect as many pillows as you want, the mobile device you want, and its charge cord. Go into the fort and lay everything out to be as comfortable as possible.

She will lay on the backs of any furniture, climb onto your shoulder, will ignore you when you want to cuddle but wakes you up at 1am by walking up you because she wants pets NOW, thinks anything yours is now hers, lays across anything you pay too much attention to including books tablets or laptops, trained the groomer to cut her while she was on his shoulder, oh and actively seeks revenge when pissed. 

If I go away for a night (and leave her with my brother who makes her shortbread cookies mind you) I have to appease her the second I get back with a new toy just she won’t revenge poo on my bed. 

I left for a week once and my father watched her and when I came back, she had trained *him*. If she wanted out back, she stood by that door and barked once. If she wanted a car ride, she stood by the door to the garage and barked once. If she wanted a walk, front door, same thing. If she wanted to sit on the back of the couch and look out the window, she went to him barked once and led him to where she wanted to lay and stared at him until he opened the curtains. Similar thing if she wanted a treat. 

Thankfully she never over eats and we just leave food down for her, but if it is out more than a day or two, she stands right next to it barks once and makes you change out the food to unstale food.

Other fun things, she fucking learned how to spell multiple words. She LOVES lo mein, so we stopped saying the word in her presence because she wouldn’t stop barking til she got some if she heard the word. First we spelled it out, after a few times she figured that out, back to the barking. Next we just called it getting some Chinese, few times same reaction. So we tried tried spelling that, same response. We ended up having to change how we referred to it each time we say it to get her not to do it. BTW, same with ice cream. 

She hates getting wet and won’t go out in the rain unless she is under shelter. So we think fine, we’ll just wait til it stops. Well her majesty will glare at you if she has to step on wet grass. Btw I live in Florida, so rain is common, and so are hurricanes, tropical storms, and tropical depressions. It’s a fun situation with the last three.

SquaredCircle,fdd6jwj,t1_fdcvvlp,1578297013.0,"Your argument is valid theory. Mix the really fucking bad CTE that had been getting worse over time, with all the other things from stress, to depression, to drugs, to steroids, and it’s not a pretty picture. Yes there were two innocent victims (one completely and utterly innocent in his kid), but it is possible that it he wasn’t just a horrible asshole but a very very sick man that also had a lot of things in and out of his control that factored in to it. If he had lived (and the medical science of CTE had any way of pre-death identification), I’m guessing he could very well have a solid defensive of not guilt do to insanity. 

But in the end we will never know, because we weren’t there, and everyone who was is dead. It’s all speculation at this point. You could be right, Hayman could be right, or the answer could lie somewhere in the middle. We are also trying to find rational reasons behind irrational actions, and a lot of time there just isn’t any. Almost any theory at this point could be a valid one, but that’s because we will never truly know."

SquaredCircle,fdcnuzw,t1_fdcabe8,1578279565.0,"I’ll go with your argument for a minute. 

By all accounts (both Jericho and Nancy’s sister) he didn’t start getting really weird until about a year and a half before the deaths. (So generously 2005) And that weekend he had definitely had a psychotic break with reality. 

But there is a long history going back to at least 1996 of fights, bullying, and hazing. 

CTE can cause paranoia, social instability, impulsive behavior, and violent outbursts. But it also can take up to 10 years to even see the first symptoms. If we use the earliest dates of violence, and an 8-10 year time to develop, we get 1086-1988. Which would be when he was with Stampede.  The first time he used the diving headbutt was in 1985. To sadly add to your point, 8-10 years before the 2003 and 2005 things would place him directly in ECW which he was in from 1994-1995. 

CTE presents like Alzheimer’s which I can personally vouch also causes personality changes. Its entirely possible the violence was caused by the CTE. Mix in stress, drugs, alcohol, steroids, and going from a slowly to a rapidly deteriorating brain? 

I can’t disprove your argument"
SquaredCircle,fdca0d9,t3_ekhu0q,1578270054.0,"The thing is yes his brain looked like an 85 year old Alzheimer’s patient, yes there were 10 time the amount of steroids in his body than should be, but it doesn’t matter. 

CTE, mental illness, steroids, together, separate or in any combination did not cause or excuse what he did. 

They didn’t help the situation for damn sure, but he was already known to be violent. 

In 2003 his wife filed for divorce. When she did she also asked for a restraining order. To quote, he “lost his temper and threatened to strike the petitioner [Nancy] and cause extensive damage to the home and personal belongings of the parties, including furniture.”

The deciding factor here wasn’t the steroids, it wasn’t the CTE, and it wasn’t mental illness. It was that he was a violent man. 

Take a violent man and add brain damage, steroids, and mental illness, and you get something horrible. 

His violence got out of control and he killed his wife. Then the brain damage and mental illness made him think there was no way out and he deliberately killed his kid then himself. 

He was a violent man and his wife had an extremely violent death. But then the next day he drugged his kid and then killed him. Then before he took his own life he texted people “The dogs are in the enclosed pool area. Garage side door is open,” 

His life and maybe if you squint his son’s life were taken because of the CTE, the mental illness, and the steroids. But it all started because he was a piece of shit who was violent towards his wife."
