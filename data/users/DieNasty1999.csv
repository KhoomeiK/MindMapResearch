aww,fds7gjt,t1_fdnvoj9,1578696076.0,No one is stopping anybody to flushing their toilets or taking a bath .... The point is not to miss-use water. I hope people in the West understand the importance of water before it runs out.
aww,fds6xof,t1_fdnpvwy,1578695733.0,"I live in India , in a city called Mumbai (in the suburbs to be exact) . In my locality water come through taps once per week for an hour. And for the rest of the week we have to buy our water for venders . So I don't like to see people wasting water... Virtue signal some might say. And on the point of flushing toilets, we have local toilet (a bunch of toilet in a place), coz v don't have personal toilet due to lack of water. It's hard for me to see people wasting water which is such an essential part of your life. 
Sorry if I am being preachy ..."
