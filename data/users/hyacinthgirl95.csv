LoveNikki,ff5s9la,t1_ff5raz7,1579608300.0,"That is very valid. I didn’t know it had become such a mocking trend. I do respect individuals who are uncomfortable with violent imagery, I was just trying to express the importance of creative freedom. We just got the beautiful Mucha collab. His art is very much about beautiful women in luxurious settings, which to some people in the past might have deemed vulgar. Many might have found the post disturbing but what was the context? Suicide is not murder. And it’s not an insult. The person who created the original post (from what i’ve read) was not mocking the subject. Why should their creativity be censored if they did nothing wrong within context. Premature death is not an insult. Nor is it unnatural. It happens. It’s the real world. Starry Corridor is a place for self expression. And it wasn’t intended as a negative space for the players like you and me. It also doesn’t force players to click on every post. You decide what you want to see. You can select a post and select a kind comment to leave. I also never said suicide isn’t serious, it is. But what one person considers art may differ to what you consider art. And that doesn't negate yours or their opinion. It just differentiates your specific taste. Idk. Love Nikki has shown it makes questionable decisions every now and then in the game idk🤷🏻‍♀️"
LoveNikki,ff5rds5,t1_ff5qvxq,1579607260.0,"I disagree. And if the game rules decided it was not to be allowed, then why is it possible to create these posts. It’s dangerous to police creativity. Creative freedom is the ability to create anything you want as long as you’re expressing yourself. I understand why it disturbed you and many others (me as well especially considering we couldn’t speak to the user and voice out concern for them). But since we aren’t able to comment on stranger’s posts then there is no room for critiquing the creator. Just discussion of the problem that is perceived by a love nikki user. All we can do is report a user, there is no opportunity to discuss the issue with the person who created the post. LN has a lot of things that it needs to fix and improve. I also enjoy the ability to discuss on here 😌. Have a nice day 😇"
LoveNikki,ff5ot69,t1_ff31gtw,1579603763.0,Excellent! I’d love it if they implemented this feature. 🖤😍
LoveNikki,ff5oom9,t3_ercgw4,1579603575.0,"Listen I know where you’re coming from, and what you mean. But who’s to decide what is inappropriate and what isn’t. Sadly suicide is a reality, but so is murder. And what happened to Lunar, she was killed in a dress up game. We can’t police what people might deem creative. I’m sorry that it disturbed you but it can still be perceived as a creative piece. Anyway one of my favorite songs/poems is Strange Fruit performed by Billie Holiday. It’s a song about slavery and lynching. Many people wanted and tried to have that piece of historical art destroyed. It is disturbing but it’s truth and a reality to people. Anyway I think people should be allowed to create posts as long as they don’t insult individuals. And suicide is not an insult. It’s death. And although unpleasant, it’s still not an insult to you or anyone else. 🧐starry corridor is a place where players are free to express themselves creatively, in whatever form they decide."

euphoria,fep0cz9,t1_felij3y,1579309315.0,"I don't watch the show for the nudity but for the story, can't relate. why are you so obsessed with close up vaginas? how would that be relevant to the plot? it's not a show about porn, it's a show about teenagers and their occasional drug use and sexcapades. if you want that explicit shit watch french films dude. also the actual vagina is hard to see in women. what you see is the mons pubis. beneath that fatty tissue is the clitoris, followed by the urethra, and then hidden behind or beside the labia is the vaginal opening. That's the vagina. That dark hole. That's what you want to see from a mainstream show?? dude. The penis just hangs out in front of the man's body. which is why it's more openly seen on camera from a distance. If you want to see the vagina, the cameraman literally has to zoom in in-between the actor's legs and then shine a bright light. After what GOT did to the actresses on set, I doubt they'll show anything like that. Maybe this show isn't for you and your specific interests."

GilmoreGirls,fe82b3m,t1_fe7xdxj,1578921653.0,"There a multiple instance where Jess bullies Rory and he does it when she’s still in a relationship with Dean. They were both attracted to one another but Rory was nice to Jess the moment she met him. Jess obviously was rude and standoffish because that was his personality trait due to his whole ‘me vs the world’ outlook on life. He still bullied her, not relentlessly but enough for the viewer to notice. Tristan also bullied her with his “Mary” nickname. She told him multiple times not to call her that and he still did it anyway. Dean was nice from the beginning, Logan was nice too just in a very arrogant rich white boy kind of way. Logan definitely teased her in a friendly and flirty way."
LosAngeles,fe813rz,t1_fe7ikf4,1578921202.0,"Basically imagine a world where being white is the “ideal”. You change your religion to appease your white neighbors, stop speaking your mother tongue, change your surname to a more acceptable one, and yet you are still an “other”. But in your head, you are not other like the “others”. You’re different because you’re trying to assimilate. In fact you’ve so successfully assimilated that when you move into a white neighborhood, your neighbors don’t all move away, in fact they let you attend their churches, invite you over for bbqs, hell they even hire you at their offices. And yes, white people have a lot to do with the racism between minority groups. It’s a difficult concept to understand when you’re not a minority, hell it’s difficult to realize when you are a minority, because a white majority society has made it so."
LosAngeles,fe7yzn9,t1_fe7ieo7,1578920658.0,"I think a life is worth more than possessions. You can always rebuild your business, sure it’s difficult but at least it’s still possible. You can never bring people back from the dead. That’s a life lost, a future, a family mourning for their daughter/sister/cousin. This is why hate is still so prominent in society today. We value things that belong to us more than the life of a fellow human being. She was child and they killed her for a bottle of orange juice. Let that sink in."
LosAngeles,fe7xqug,t1_fe69t3p,1578920332.0,"I will add that the poor girl had put the juice in her bag before she paid for it, which is why she was being accused of stealing it in the first place. I hate to think that this small detail created the misunderstanding that cost her her life 💔 but why shoot a young woman for 2 dollars, i’ll never understand. At that point you let her leave and just refuse to let her shop there again. So many ways to solve the problem."

ariheads,fdzdu4f,t1_fdxy21p,1578789312.0,"Hi Taylor 😅 y’all stress too much. Let’s be honest. The industry is not about helping the world or people. It’s not about bringing people together. It’s to make bank. Yes these people get to do what they like, making music, but it’s especially about money. It’s why so many artists don’t release music for years. Get trapped in horrible and unfair contracts. If you don’t sell music, or you don’t have enough followers, or views. You don’t get signed, even if you’re oh so talented. It’s why bands break up. Why a good amount of musicians die young. Ariana is lucky. One of the luckiest artists in the planet right now. She is aware of the toxic culture the music world has. It’s why she works with her best friends. It’s why her mom is almost always with her despite Ariana being 26 years old. Scooter Braun is dangerous and successful because he is really smart and good at his job. Justin Bieber was overworked because he was a teenage heartthrob. But teenage heartthrobs grow up and they lose their allure and popularity. Female artists have longer careers because instead of continuously attracting fans with their looks, they attract them with relatability. But social media has been killing this facade of relatability amongst artists and fans. Justin Bieber has gotten himself in so much trouble, all on his own. Male artists have the pressure of sustaining fans not just with talent but with attraction. Anyway Scooter is dangerous for the same reasons Taylor, Ariana, and Justin are dangerous. Their connections, money, and influence over millions of people around the world. If Justin wants to keep selling records by the high thousands, he’s gotta have some one like Scooter on his corner, unrelenting and connected in the world of the famous and elite. Taylor Swift is also powerful, and she displays that, with her famous friends, her wealth, her music sales. I imagine Scooter buying her album masters must have been devastating for her: emotionally but most importantly financially. Don’t feel too sorry for these people, wealth separates them from the rest of us, the 99%. Anyway don’t stress, they’re not worth it. If Ariana releases music tomorrow i’m not gonna worry about whether she’s resting or taking care of herself, she doesn’t care if i eat or not. That’s the danger of celebrity: the illusion that they care about us makes us care about them. Peace out and just enjoy the music ✌🏻🎤 money takes away the need for accountability."
AskMen,fdq2aip,t3_emh6y3,1578651354.0,"I’m a short young woman, 5 feet less than 100 lbs, and 18 years old at the time. And I was visiting my sister at college. So i wasn’t completely aware of my surroundings in the city. Went outside for a walk at around 9 pm. It was really dark except for the street lamps. And then I see a young asian woman walking towards me carrying groceries. She motions to me and I say hello. And when she gets near me she asks if i can walk with her because there was a man following her, he was a creepy homeless man (which is too commonplace at this university). I quickly put my arm around her and tell her I’d be happy to. I’d never been as brave as I was that day. I turn to the man walking behind us and stare him down giving him the meanest look I can make. He turns a corner and disappears. And i ask if she wants me to walk her all the way home (for some bizarre reason i was not afraid for myself lol) she declines thanks me and i watch her walk away. I wait and stay put outside my sister’s place turning multiple times to see if the creepy homeless guy had come back. I go back inside when i see her go inside a gate further up the street. I’m still happy I decided to go for a walk that night, there was no one else in the street at the time. I can’t imagine what would have happened if she hadn’t spotted me and asked for my help. It takes a lot of courage to ask for help when you’re scared 💙"

movies,fcvjb8c,t1_fcv1mcb,1578003303.0,"It wasn’t an interpretation since the source material is clear. And it was the end goal. Maybe not for Louisa M Alcott, but many readers desired and expected Jo to marry at the end of the story. Louisa had her marry but not to who the readers wanted her to be paired up with. The only reason Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy is its ending. Without it it wouldn’t be considered a true tragedy. The point of Little Women was to highlight the relationship between young girls, as well as the transition from childhood to adulthood. It wasn’t for Jo to marry at the end, but that is the ending. Greta just wanted to honor LMA by incorporating an alternative to Jo’s ending. But in doing so, the story loses its fairytale-like ending. And this is coming from some one who always hated the Jo and Friedrich pairing."

movies,fcsrdi9,t1_fcrjn5g,1577923175.0,"Yes she matures in the book. And becomes a very intelligent, refined and kind young woman. Jo was not entirely good either, very rebellious and stubborn. All girls have their faults, even Beth (too shy to function). And they all have human traits that we can relate to. Jo fans are really just fans of the book, she’s the main protagonist. I don’t want Jo to marry a rich boy or to live in a big house. She marries a poor man and inherits a big house which she turns into a school. Adult Amy is perfectly good, it’s 12 year old Amy that is a brat, she grows out of it. In fact Amy is the most pragmatic of the sisters, a trait I highly value."
movies,fcralnm,t1_fcl0m4s,1577899174.0,"Is Romeo and Juliet still Romeo and Juliet without their deaths in the ending? Without their families feuding? You give Greta too much freedom as an adaptor of a novel and instead she becomes a storyteller. She’s telling her own story. Why name it Little Women? Why have Jo in the film at all? There is creative freedom but also a necessary faithfulness to tell a story that’s been told before in a fresher and more modern way. Does this version vilify marriage? It certainly seems to. Greta clearly had a vision, she told her story successfully, but from my perspective, she sacrificed vital roles in the novel to twist the story to fulfill her ending. Also the irony of the copyrighting scene. Greta was able to mold the story to suit her vision. Copyright prevents that. 👀🤙🏻"
movies,fcqya3b,t1_fcnscn8,1577894025.0,"Also want to add here that Amy from Little Women is similar to briony from atonement, the annoying spoiled meddling and bratty little sister.

movies,fcqxccx,t1_fcmk23f,1577893640.0,"I thought it was confusing to follow. What is very disappointing as well is how wonderfully classic storybook the 1994 film version is and how modern this film felt, it no longer seemed like a story but a biopic. The 1994 film manages to transport you to a different time and place. I grew up watching that film and understood it well. And this version definitely feels like no one can “grow up” watching it because of the confusing timeline, little 6-12 year old kids are not going to be able to follow the story being presented. And using the same actress to play a 12 year old was very bizarre. I was disturbed when she was explaining the lemon trading, it looked like a mentally challenged woman talking nonsense. Also little kids don’t focus on color grading to understand the plot, only film enthusiasts and cinephiles do. I appreciate the experimental method Gerwig employed, but i was disappointed. The actress that plays Jo was fantastic tho. Her energy was palpable and believable. And i also liked that Jo had two different alternate endings. That was very cool 👍🏻Also another disappointment was how Gerwig didn’t focus on the importance of the novel jo had written. I think that is why Amy is seen as a more likable character. She’s the quintessential annoying little sister. Her burning the novel is devastating. And I feel like the viewer would not understand just how important it was."
movies,fcqtdlo,t1_fcqsowq,1577891905.0,My only complaint. Amy did not look 12. She looked like a fully developed woman. It was so stark to see her behave like a little girl when she looked like a grown girl.
