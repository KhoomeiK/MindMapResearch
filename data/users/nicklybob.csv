depression,ffxreab,t3_evsoai,1580330926.0,"Fight him. Challenge him. After years of fighting my parents started to not be misunderstanding punishing assholes. Now it’s been 10 years and they at least have depression in their vocabulary and have seen me be self-abusive/suicidal enough times to get that I have mental problems. Maybe not worth it, but if I have to live like this for the rest of my parents’ lives then they’re gonna have to get it. What are they gonna do, punish me more? Be sad to death? Hasn’t happened yet."

Guess what, I only turned out thinking it's not okay to make mistakes and now have a self-harming breakdown any time I have a perceived failure because I don't know how to be okay with mistakes. And now she regrets it."

Guilt,ff95oyo,t1_ff8564b,1579705449.0,I have a diary I've been keeping up most days for 11+ years but that doesn't provide me with a response to what I say. Sometimes I crave others' response too much.
dysthymia,ff53syh,t3_eroalq,1579579451.0,"Breakdowns are a hard and misunderstood thing. If only it were so easy that you just instantly get immobilized to the point of hospitalization or something. My breakdown lasted a year or a year and a half. It consisted of me very slowly losing function to the point of being so scared and lacking motivation from depression that I wouldn't eat or leave the house, even though during this time I had to go to school and work (I was fired for no reason during that time but also in general had temporary jobs so employment was never secure), and requiring meds to have a chance of appearing to function normally (took a while to find those meds though I'm glad it didn't take longer). Time makes me feel less like absolute bottom but I'm like 2-3 years in and still trying to heal in terms of world perspective, probably will never stop being incredibly bitter and cynical and regain confidence due to bad experiences during this time."
depression,ff4teqe,t3_ern9qc,1579572006.0,"Write one sentence to summarize whatever notes or text your looking at. Just do it and then come back here or take a break.

I feel like I just barely graduated because towards the end of my degree I developed severe anxiety with physical symptoms because of a stressful part-time retail job in a sketchy location (loss of appetite and diarrhea whenever I ate, racing heart, easily triggered hyperventilating, butterflies in my stomach, clammy hands) to go with my already chronic depression and social anxiety disorder, and I feel like I lay in bed all the time I wasn’t at work (I missed at least half my classes). But I remember forcing myself to take notes on one slide at a time, many times not getting through the whole PowerPoint presentation that made up a lecture. I also remember forcing myself to complete one page of the practice exams we were provided before midterms and finals. I definitely didn’t get through all the PowerPoints and practice exams, but I got through more than half and got at least 50% on all my courses, which is really all I needed to pass the course, if that helps put things into perspective."

depression,ff3tnlu,t3_erfx66,1579548606.0,Me too. I've always overreacted to every little failure because my brain screams so loudly that I'm a failure over and over that I have to hurt myself. How will I do life if I can't handle performing poorly at work for example.
SuicideWatch,ff3tgjl,t3_erh9s5,1579548485.0,"Nope. This is something I tell myself, that if I ever kill myself and then get to decide to come back as a ghost or not, I have to decide to not come back. Because then I'm 100% sure I want to leave this world behind."

depression,ff3mc81,t3_ergpl8,1579544114.0,"I think the meaning can be found in what things you want to do, whether it’s big aspirations like “What career path do you want to take?” “Where do you want to travel?” “What amount of money do you want to have for retirement?” or little things like “what do you want to eat next?” or “What show do you want to watch?” However I’m rolling around at the emotional bottom where I hardly get pleasure from eating and sleeping let alone doing things and it’s a struggle to pass the day and I feel like a living dead person who’s just not physically dead yet...

depression,feemefd,t3_eoq8rq,1579036698.0,"Me too. Early twenties and have a defeatist attitude people say I’m too young to have. I settle for mediocrity because everything I’ve tried has failed, or as an anxious depressive I get too intimidated and feel inferior right away and get out. My parents aren’t happy I stopped trying but fuck em I’m a disappointment anyways"
depression,feeluvo,t3_eoqyqp,1579036382.0,"23 too, never been in a relationship, I have social anxiety and am generally extremely uncomfortable around people, but everyone around me is getting in relationships and that makes me feel alone. I don’t love myself enough or like others enough to get an SO, and it’s not like I do anything besides go to work so no one will find me. I feel alone too and I hate it."
SuicideWatch,feehs23,t1_fedhq2y,1579034014.0,"I think about that all the time. There’s nothing I want out of life because nothing feels good. Ive wanted things in the past and either they failed or I stopped wanting them because they became meaningless. I’ve accepted that my brain is incapable of pleasure, that my brain structure is like that now. I’ve read about a therapy where you try doing everything and try to re-train your brain to experience pleasure... but I’ve yet to come across a therapist who knows how to treat anhedonia."
SuicideWatch,feckseo,t3_eoc598,1578976343.0,"Yeah. I'm waiting till my parents die and then there's no way in hell I'm sticking around. It was so hard to accept I have to wait decades for this because my suicide will break them, but I've seen their reaction to my suicidal acts and also have had nightmares about people killing themselves and read about those bereaved by suicide, so I won't do it to them."
depression,fe5xsui,t3_enwi4j,1578877330.0,What's wrong with being on it forever? My doctor said it'd be okay. I took a few years to find a combo of meds that helps a bit and I never want to go off it. I think for me having a 200-pound weight of sadness and anger and being scared of everything in the long term is worse than being on a bunch of meds and being just moderately sad and scared all the time.
depression,fe5c4il,t3_enqxec,1578867563.0,"Yeah. My mom is like ""oh just use your will to stop hurting yourself so you don't hurt us, have a strong will"" and I tell her she's made of shit and rainbows and I want to hurt myself because I like to and I hate myself completely and I continue being incredibly bitter and despicable."

SuicideWatch,fe54aj8,t3_enr98n,1578865490.0,I need my meds. I better never be separated from them again. For years my parents were opposed to me taking meds but eventually I could get them myself so fuck them. I tried a bunch of things for like 7 years and now I'm on a combo that helps my current problems (which have gotten worse over the years). Basically it takes away the crippling anxiety and depression and anger and bodily pains. I still don't feel positive emotion but I'm suffering less. I feel like a robot actually. I don't do anything and don't want anything and sleep a lot and exist just because I'm not dead yet.
depression,fe534l1,t3_ent8ud,1578865222.0,I don't experience that but no one commented and I feel like commenting so.... I don't trust any time I feel better anymore. My brain's too fucked up. Oh well. But if you find relief in those rare hours you feel better then good for you.
SuicideWatch,fe51ge6,t3_enss05,1578864797.0,"Get yourself to a safe place and wait it out. I know I sound cold saying that and you feel like you have to die and it feels horrible and you have no hope but I hope you won't feel like this every second of forever. Maybe that safe place is the hospital, or maybe just a public place where you won't act out like a mall or park or public transit. Good luck."
SuicideWatch,fe4zomf,t3_enq8y6,1578864281.0,"I think it'd be bad if you're selectively intelligent towards being aware and philosophical and analytical about things, but pessimistic and unable to experience/conceptualize positive emotion."

SuicideWatch,fdfhmmi,t1_fdf86up,1578361900.0,What if you have anhedonia so enjoying stressless pleasure is impossible and you just feel bored and numb with no artificial stimulation (drugs/meds or something) and you just stay like that forever no matter how little stress you have
depression,fd52146,t3_ek2fne,1578173476.0,"I despise how people just throw around words like depressed, anxious, OCD, wanting to die, etc. I think people like that just haven’t been through enough or seen enough shit to know the meaning of what they’re saying. (I want to think I’m better than them for having more perspective but actually I’m envious and feel inferior that I can’t have the naive enjoyment and ease of life they do). 

Holding in emotions always seems to backfire for me. Besides causing outbursts and self harm, it’s made me an angry person no one wants to be around and now I get psychosomatic chest and back pain. I don’t know what the best way to not hold in emotions is but talking here helps me a bit."
depression,fd4z3ba,t3_ek2hvi,1578172599.0,"That’s bullshit. I boast of chronic severe mental illness (no I hate being like this) and nothing bad has ever happened to me, no history of trauma, no family history of mental illness and addictions, no reason anyone can think of that I got depression and anxiety. Therapists are always confused by me but the general consensus is something just went wrong biologically and treatment is hard because there’s no cause to address."

depression,fczs7qc,t3_ejq316,1578107726.0,"You’re at work. That’s something. That’s something you still have left to lose (the job itself and the motivation to physically be at a job) that depression hasn’t taken yet. But I get that it might feel like you’re dragging your dead body around, doing things meaninglessly, and that feeling could go on for a long time."
depression,fczrmgo,t3_ejq3q3,1578107441.0,"I think I relate. Everything sucks. There’s nothing good about anything, or if there is it’s meaningless anyways. I think I have learned helplessness and I settle for mediocrity (life experiences, careers) because everything’s shit anyways, or at least I’m only capable of feeling as such."
depression,fcyng5x,t3_ejh6zp,1578083327.0,Things going to shit sucks. Failing sucks. Being at the bottom after all that is horrible. I'm there too and I can't get out.
depression,fcxs4s8,t3_dxk3np,1578069636.0,Yes. Ow. Mirtazipine made it less bad until it stopped working. Any aroused emotion (they're all negative because I'm not capable of feeling positive emotions / don't remember how to) triggers it.
depression,fcvee0z,t1_fcu8rci,1578000352.0,"Not OP nor denying OP’s strength but I’m not here after 10 years of depression because I’m strong. I’m just here because it’s hard to die and then 10 years passed. What is giving in, spontaneously dying? Succeeding suicide (which is fricken hard)? I’ve already lost everything and all energy and aspirations to depression. It’s a hard life for us but strength is irrelevant, we just are here."
depression,fcoyuki,t3_eiccyo,1577845388.0,"I feel damn near bottom and I want to answer but I'm scared to say the wrong thing too... There's nothing you can do to help and they know that. They probably feel guilty if they give it a moment of thought that there's someone like you who cares, at least I do. It's really a dire place to be emotionally, they feel bad and they make others feel bad and there's no way about it. I guess understanding that would be a place to start. And then using that to... decrease the overall suffering? Like, decrease your own suffering over it, because I'd guess they don't want you to suffer or to make anyone suffer any more than they already do. It's a really hopeless place to be... hopelessness causes reckless lifestyle choices like addictions and suicide attempts and that messed up stuff. But there's probably nothing you can say to give them hope. For me the only hope I have is starting to see therapists and starting meds, like actually doing treatment-related things, although it would be beyond anything expected of you to actually get them treatment... I guess what helps is when I tell my friends/family I'm starting treatment, and then they encourage me and don't tell me to stop talking about my problems like I expect them to, even if I'm repeating myself... It's takes energy to find a therapist alone, and I guess if you really wanted to get them treatment you could give them contact information for therapists or specific numbers to hotlines instead of just like sending links to those self-help websites or something vague... I'd say be there to listen all the time, but if they're really that bad for years and years it's gonna take a toll on you and they know that and you'll feel that. Like, I want my friends to tell me to stop talking about my problems at this point if it gets too much, but do it gently and don't just tell them to stop and end it there, tell them they can come back another time and they're not turned away... sorry for the rant..."
depression,fcfj1ju,t1_fccjoau,1577630520.0,Me too. I hate the aftermath! I hate having to deal with hospitals and therapists and sad parents. That's the part that makes me dislike thinking about past attempts
