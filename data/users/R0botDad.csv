office,fdouxjd,t1_fdotme5,1578613444.0,"We were in a company wide meeting , and our head of marketing is showing off these new shirts we have to wear when we attend work conventions.  She says as she holds up a visibly tiny and small shirt, ""these are our new work shirts for conventions, etc"" and said coworker shouts aloud , ""oh is that one for \_\_\_(my name)\_\_\_ !?"" and laughs.  The head of marketing, says confused, ""umm..no this one is too small"". He then looks around the room laughing and everyone turns and stares at me.  (again, Im 6'0 , 230 ish lbs , probably more TBH) and it was just humiliating to hear and experience.  It obviously wouldnt be my shirt, as its was the head of marketings shirt, (she has tiny stature and is like 5'1 and super skinny, thus why she held up her small shirt to show off) am i wrong to think that was inappropriate of my coworker to do ?"

He not only heard the comment as well, but agreed with me that it was inappropriate, and went to our CEO about the incident.  The CEO and VP came back and told me to go to our outsourced HR company.  I have a meeting with him tomorrow.  Thank you for comments"

bipolar,fdoffft,t1_fdnya4w,1578604072.0,"Lamictal was a double edged sword for me personally.  It took away all of my anxiety.  As in, literally it made me feel incredible.  However, it also made me dramatically more irritable, and aggressive.  My wife says the person I was on Lamictal almost drove us to a divorce."
