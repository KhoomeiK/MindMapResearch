AskReddit,ff4b1mb,t1_ff48qsb,1579559446.0,"People suck, man. I don’t know why becoming audibly irate in public has become somewhat normalized, but it needs to stop. So few people stop to think what the other person’s situation is and only think of their own selfish needs. It’s such a shame that being kind seems to be a rarity these days"
infp,ff3tdje,t3_ergqdt,1579548433.0,"I don’t even initiate small talk. I don’t think I’m able to, beyond “how are you?” If I need to talk to someone for help or what have you, then I do, but it’s really rare that I can just say whatever to whomever"

infp,ff2di53,t1_ff1duxx,1579501732.0,"The only issue is that we have to depend on others to really pursue a career that we like. We have to depend on them to hire us or to buy what we’re selling or to just facilitate our ability to make money to afford living. I’m facing this issue right now. I graduated from college last spring and I’ve been looking for a job, but it’s difficult because I’m not normal. I don’t want to pretend to be something I’m not to earn a living. That isn’t living. I had to pretend all through school and I’m tired. I may have a job soon, but I still have to depend on others to see my potential before I’m hired. I’m not going to try to stifle myself anymore, though. If it’s meant to be then it’s meant to be and they won’t mind that I’m so different."

infp,ff2c9lj,t3_er75f4,1579500446.0,"I would consider myself more spiritual than anything. I hate religion in terms of humanity’s embodiment of it, but not the concept of a God or gods. It’s nice to have something to believe in, especially when there’s no proven reason why we’re all here. I like to keep an open mind about it all, but I prefer to believe that there’s some mystical force in the Universe dictating our ultimate destinies"
infp,ff2bxuv,t1_ff2a7at,1579500116.0,I loved late night band bus rides when everyone stopped talking and all you heard was the hum of the wheels on the road

socialanxiety,fench75,t3_eq1sv5,1579281733.0,"You just have to find a way to stop caring. After so many times, it doesn’t hurt as much. Ultimately, we’re the ones who control our happiness and I’m not going to let other people walk all over me. I know, easier said than done, but we’ve got to try"
AskReddit,fenc5t1,t1_fena2mk,1579281536.0,"Sick people have a way of finding other sick people. You’d be surprised how easy it is. They probably had code words and, of course, money helps a lot"

pics,fehh21v,t1_fegh00h,1579116380.0,I don’t mine seeing stuff like this. It reminds me that we’re all human. Most of us go through stuff like this and sometimes we need a little connection to help us cope and understand. It’s better to be raw and real than to pretend that your life is all sunshine and roses when you’re dying on the inside.
Showerthoughts,fehg9ia,t3_ep1n1n,1579115919.0,"I thought the latter part was referencing seeing your child’s life decline from crime or addiction and the disappointment associated with it, but then I realized that it’s your child dying before you. I guess it could go either way"

infp,fdtfioz,t3_emx3w1,1578716024.0,"It depends. College taught me a lot of things about myself and what I do and don't want in life, but you can learn that anywhere. Is your desired career path dependent upon a college degree? If so, perhaps it is worth it. But if you're happier not in college and you're happy with what you're doing in life, then don't go next semester. Do what you want for a while and see if college is something that you feel is absolutely necessary for your next steps in life."
infp,fdteetc,t3_emt7w5,1578715572.0,I want that too. Someone I can go on road trips with and visit little shops just to look at knickknacks. It's been so long since I've had this with people other than my family. Maybe you should reach out to those old friends. They might miss having your weirdness around too.

AskReddit,fdmkybj,t1_fdm80ac,1578553816.0,"I didn't think that so many people went through this in their 20s. Everyone I know seems to be thriving, but maybe they're just showing off for social media."

AskReddit,fdmd3nw,t1_fdm2o9u,1578546054.0,That's how it was for me. I didn't realize how sheltered I was compared to everyone else until recently.
infp,fdm8uqp,t3_em1lq3,1578542686.0,"We're not typical people. There's nothing wrong with that. You didn't fit into that environment because it's the antithesis of what you stand for as a human. It's their loss, not yours. Maybe use this time to find a path that gives you meaning in spite of your occupation. I believe that there's reason in everything and maybe this is the Universe's way of telling you that you don't need to be there anymore and that you need to do something that caters to you. What's ""normal"" isn't always better. Remember that. Our empathy makes us unique and a valuable asset in this cruel world, and there are many people and animals and living beings around us that need people like us to understand them."
socialanxiety,fdm7rnp,t1_fdls79b,1578541892.0,"I don't mind being social if I can be myself. If I have to watch what I say and walk on eggshells, then I become reticent. Also, people seem to want us to talk when we have absolutely no reason to."
aww,fdlgq7t,t3_elwqid,1578523655.0,"I volunteer at a cat rescue and there are so many cats who don't get adopted. People mostly want kittens, unfortunately, even though a lot of the cats are really sweet."

infp,fcvrjqx,t3_ej62qk,1578008486.0,"That’s true. Society wants us to live a certain way, to work ourselves to the bone and to fear authority. It destroys the child within us while we’re still children, and we either succumb to the destruction or learn to find that inner child again. It’s a shame that we can’t live freely without being admonished by those who have no bearing on how we live our lives."
AskReddit,fcv1yet,t1_fcupa1o,1577992962.0,"I don’t understand how anybody could “need” so much money that they sacrifice their personal lives, mental health, and the needs of others and themselves. That’s not really living, in my opinion, but to each his own."
AskReddit,fcv1bgw,t1_fcu1sgw,1577992600.0,"I live in a rural, cotton farming area, and the families that farm are well off. One of them has over $3 million in assets and their child was able to purchase a nice home at the age of 22."
AskReddit,fcv0014,t1_fcucfu5,1577991876.0,"I did a trial shift at a bakery because I like baking, but working at a bakery and baking at home are completely different experiences. Having to serve paying customers just removes the joy, in my opinion."

That’s why I pushed away the friends I had and why I hate small talk and try to avoid people that I know in public spaces. I don’t want to talk to fill the void or have awkward encounters of the third kind every time I speak to someone about something baseless."

I get what you mean about driving hurting the environment, but you gotta get your kicks somehow. If you get an electric car, you can drive around all night with arguably less of an effect on the environment, so it’s a win-win"
infp,fc1w9ya,t3_efo8kv,1577331669.0,"I stopped posting on Facebook and the like years ago. I figured that no one really cared about what I posted anyhow. I generally just use social media to see what the people I care about are up to and to see funny memes. I try to avoid lingering too long on these sites, though, because I tend to compare myself to others despite the fact that I’ve always been different from them."
infp,fbcqmax,t3_ecapo9,1576730779.0,One of the few people I thought I could trust turned out to be just like everybody else. This is why I choose to be alone most of the time.
