shittymoviedetails,ffahbm4,t1_ffab281,1579735740.0,"I wouldn't describe the first one as looking bad by any means, just primitive.  Back then, I was still sometimes disabling my desktop wallpaper to free up RAM. It was also either that year or the year before where one of my friends in school mentioned to me that he'd been trying out playing CS using some new control scheme he'd heard about: Using WASD instead of arrow keys.

So many things we take for granted today simply didn't exist back then, and that they were able to even make the movie at all was an accomplishment in itself. Now, though?  Everything I'd need to render the same sort of graphics is a standard part of Blender, with the concepts themselves having been created and refined long ago.

Ask me to make some shot-for-shot rerenders of scenes from Incredibles one using only a copy of Blender 2.8, and despite my lack of artistic talent I could probably pull it off without breaking a sweat.  Ask me to do it with my choice of top of the line computers and software from 2004, and I don't know if I'd be able to pull it off."

CrazyIdeas,ff3qi9d,t1_ff20co2,1579546673.0,"A Zootopia: Special Victims Unit show actually sounds like it'd be especially horrifying.  Some furry porn can be severely fucked up, even by furry standards, and the idea of a show treating pictures like that as if they're crimes that actually happened and need to be investigated could easily make for some serious psychological horror.

At the same time though, it could be pretty hilarious, too.  Looking for traces of semen everywhere wouldn't be effectivee, you'd instead need to deal with looking for trails of semen, and watching you don't get confused where it intersects with all the other trails and puddles.  Instead of busting out a UV lamp everywhere, they'd probably just end up ignoring them entirely since it's already a given that pretty much everything is already absolutely drenched in semen."

Showerthoughts,ff3onik,t1_ff2s5az,1579545543.0,"My driver's ed teacher actually made a really great point about this, though.  The purpose of the thin line of paint isn't to rely on that trust, it's there to act as a replacement for it.  As long as you know you're on your side of this line, and everyone on the other end of it is staying on their side, you can simply ignore everything happening over there as not a threat to you.

As soon as you see a shape crossing over that barrier though, or something getting ready to approach it, all bets are off. You're back to working out their intentions, path, timing, how that might interfere with your own, etc, and trust becomes a huge part of how fast you're willing to go.

It's not that we trust the line to keep us safe.  It's that it's much, much easier to trust that we can see that traffic on either side of the line won't interfere.  The line is just a quick mental shortcut that makes it much easier for us to zip right past someone who we can't possibly trust at these speeds."

Games,ff1t5k4,t1_ff01ang,1579485607.0,"Streaming as a general concept could be done pretty amazingly.

Buy your games on Steam/Origin/Epic/whatever as you normally would, install them on your awesome streamed PC with an amazing connection, and enjoy it without worrying what'll happen to all the games you own if suddenly the service shuts down some day.
