AskReddit,ffdke96,t3_esse9d,1579822740.0,"Super upbeat happy friendly fellow I met during freshman orientation in college. Every time I saw him for the next four years he had a friendly greeting, remembered my name, even though we had nothing in common. I never even knew what his major was, but he could always brighten your day."
FurnitureMaking,ffc5wvn,t1_ffbj337,1579792276.0,I do something similar. The sled doesn’t need to be super rigid as long as you have a dead flat surface to set the sled on while you attach and shim the workpiece. A flat planer bed will take it from there.

Cooking,felr02u,t3_ept881,1579228816.0,"Sounds like accumulated mineral deposits, like from hard water. Maybe look into using CLR lime and scale remover? This is just an idea to do some research on, I have not done this myself. 
EDIT: that calphalon,if it’s aluminum, might not be true baked enamel, but something more like, I dunno, powder coating. Definitely research before trying my half-assed advice."
Cooking,felqoo9,t3_eptdzd,1579228600.0,Lamb burgers are actually really good. There was a place in my college town that served them.
Cooking,felqacd,t3_epm9g3,1579228326.0,"IMO learning your water stone skills is hands down the best way to sharpen a knife. I’m lazy, though, and years ago I bought a worksharp brand belt sharpener for about $70. It has an angle guide to keep you in line. It also does scissors and pocket knives. You can get a great edge in little time but it can be aggressive in removing steel if you aren’t careful. This is fine for the $50 Henkel I’ve had for 30 years, but if I had a really nice $200 knife, or a Japanese blade, I’d buckle down and learn the skill."

Carpentry,fehaq94,t1_fegi1hz,1579112681.0,"Looked at the kreg just now. I think I like it better than the kind like mine with multiple hole patterns drilled into it. With just one set of adjustable bushings, you really can't drill the wrong pair of holes. I have to put tape over the holes i'm not using, which is an extra step."
Carpentry,fefqo32,t1_fefne20,1579062440.0,"They have plexi jigs with all standard spacings drilled into them. Edge offset is adjustable, so then the only measurement you have to make is center on a drawer or height on a door. Well worth <20 bucks even if you only use it on one job.   Mine is very similar to the Drill rite drawer pull jig you can find on amazon."

nathanforyou,fdfjkgx,t3_ek1w21,1578363207.0,"What infuriates me is the shitty tools in his hands. Rusted out sledge and a lousy rusted out axe that probably hasn’t seen a sharp edge ever. Fucking yellow fiberglass handles with zero style. This dude needs to pay a visit to  r/handtools or some such similar and learn how to up his tool game. He has muscles but I doubt he works for a living. He’s a pretty cute gym rat, though."

mildlyinteresting,fckoopo,t1_fcgpfb7,1577729887.0,No doubt. I once watched a simple suburban bank get demo’d. Most of the bank was down and gone in a day. The reinforced concrete vault took another week.

JustBootThings,fc4dzi0,t1_fc3z55x,1577413915.0,"Buddy of mine explained it in a really depressing/meaningful way. You didn’t just affect the enemy who’s life you just ended. Even if he was a genuine bad guy, he had parents, children, family, friends, and you just hurt all of them. Little to no chance these are all bad people. You probably just hurt normal people, good people, too. Maybe the job had to be done, but thinking about it that way isn’t fun."

Construction,fc4cgy0,t1_fc485fj,1577412671.0,"Have you seen the language creeping into CD’s from certain architects and engineers that basically says “regardless of what these drawings show, GC is responsible for obeying local codes?” I’m seeing this from out of town/out of state consultants on commercial refurbishing when the consultant visits the job site at most once or twice ever and has little feel for as-built conditions."

I’ve had clients LOVE an extra, I’ve had other entitled clients act almost as if I was giving the extra out of guilt for how bad I must have screwed them on the original contract, and it was pretty much a negative for me."
Carpentry,fc39qan,t3_efwid7,1577384878.0,God this sucks. You only find out after it’s hung when it’s easier to fix than tear out and lose a day. I think manufacturers know this.
