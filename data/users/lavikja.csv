OpenChristian,femd67g,t3_epnfwz,1579249457.0,"I’ve always leaned towards believing in God, even when I was a child and my dad was an Atheist who believed that when you died that was it. My mother believed in the “other side” which I don’t actually even comprehend what that even means. That’s besides the point, though, even as a small child, I prayed a lot because my childhood was rough and I wanted something to save me from it. 

Eventually, Jesus did save me from it. My parents divorced and my mum left, which opened up my dad’s thinking and he became a Christian a few months afterwards after reading the bible a lot and finally finding a church that worked for him. 

I am still a Christian today. I’ve had my doubts, I’ve cried, I’ve even mourned for God when I went through a crisis of believing He wasn’t real. But Jesus reminded me He was and He loves me. 

The reason I am still a better person is because Jesus makes me a better person. Whenever I find myself being angry, judgemental, insecure, upset (all things I extremely loathe about myself), Jesus literally pops into my head and reminds me to be a better person. I am not perfect at all, extremely far from it, but He makes me a better person and the end result is that I feel happier when I am less angry and less bitter. 

I find my well-being improves extremely when I read a bit of the bible every day and say my prayers often. I also just speak to God (silently) all day long about everything and make jokes with Him. 

I couldn’t do this without Him."

Christian,fej87qu,t3_epcnl0,1579161078.0,"Everyone has a type of church they feel more comfortable worshipping in. That’s probably why there are so many different Christian denominations out there. 

My dad pressured me for a long time to go his Church. A Pentecostal church. The people were generally nice, but I didn’t enjoy the type of worship, the extreme boisterous nature of the individuals there. It just personally made me uncomfortable.

However, my dad loves it and so do many others. That church just doesn’t fit me. I also had a couple of bad experiences in that church that gave me extreme anxiety and I stopped going to church for two years because of it. My dad would also makes comments after that, “I hope you become to know Jesus.” Like because I wasn’t attending Church I didn’t know Jesus and I didn’t have a relationship with Him.

This always upset me because I felt like he was saying I wasn’t really a Christian. Which is the impression I’m getting about Jane and the things she is saying similarly to you. 

Only you and God knows what your relationship with God is like. Not Jane. Not your coworkers. Not your family. And only you know which Church’s will work for you and make you feel comfortable. Consider going Church shopping and when the topic arises from your coworkers, just tell them you found somewhere that makes you feel like you are in the presence God and you love the worship style. Just be honest and polite. Maybe even invite them to the service with you provided you want them there.

If they get pushy or mad, just tell them you know what your best interests are and you are able to make this decision for yourself. 

May God guise you in the right direction."

offmychest,feer4x6,t1_fedcxac,1579039439.0,"Okay, well I’m glad you talk to some people about it.

I just had a thought, though, that I wanted to share with you, maybe you already know this or think it’s invalid, but some people have disorders or mental illnesses that give them a predisposition to respond in certain ways. 

Like, when I look back on my mother, she overshared everything in her life. She probably would have told her mailman her deepest secrets and she used to ring all her friends to announce when I had some kind of infection that no one needed to know about. She did it with every single thing that ever occurred, as well as exaggerating stories and lying compulsively.

As her child, this pissed me right off and I still hold a lot of resentment to her for spilling every personal detail of my life and making up lies now. However, when I reflect upon her behaviour, I realise she must have had an array of mental illnesses. 

She was also an alcoholic and drug addict, so I would probably assume that maybe some brain damage could have occurred during her lifetime that made her behaviour even more irrational.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not sharing this to make anyone feel sorry for me or excuse people’s shitty behaviour. My point of this comment is that some people over share and play the blame game with every wrong scenario in their life because they are suffering and mentally ill. They might not even know that. And it’s just a contributing factor to consider.

People should seek treatment, yes. And not everything behaves in this manner, no. But some people do, so rather than harbouring resentment, perhaps figure out some reasoning. Maybe they behave that way because they have some kind of illness or personality disorder that makes them more inclined to behave that way. Maybe deep down they don’t even want to behave that way, but when they are caught up in that moment, they are blinded.

There are more mental illnesses out there than depression and anxiety. There are ones that majorly affect people’s personalities, their realities and their ability to think and behave rationally. 

But I also encourage people, regardless, to seek some kind of help that doesn’t burden others. Talking to friends and family about big things is healthy, but it can also drag them down if it happens every day. So talking to a therapist is always a better option, plus they have the education to actually help you. If that doesn’t work, finding self resources like journaling or meditation, maybe even prayer if you’re religious can be very self-healing. (This last paragraph is less for OP and more for anyone else who is reading my comment, but also to OP if it helps them in any way)."

I really appreciate the offer, that’s so kind, but I have already ordered a new rosary from Amazon. I also have one in my car that (forgive me for my ignorance) I didn’t actually know it was a rosary. It had been travelling with me for over two years on my car’s rear view and when I was looking at it a few weeks ago, I realised it was a rosary. It was like a light bulb moment. While I’ve been trying to learn the prayers, I realised that the first large bead after the cross is missing, which is why I ordered a new one, so that one can stay in my car and I can pray my new one when it comes. I will use my older one in the meantime and just use the chain as the first bead."

That’s a nice way of explaining it and I’m sure to many people, they would understand, but I doubt my dad would. He’s very hard headed, obsessed with the end times and Revelation. 

He’s extremely scrutinising of any Catholic Church and/or tradition. Even when I said I was going to an Anglican Church and explained their background as having split from the Roman Catholic Church, he was still wary since many Anglicans still uphold similar traditions and styles of worship.

Covetfashion,fds8fiz,t3_emwbrg,1578696715.0,"I think my biggest pet peeve relates to your number ten. I’m not blaming players for this completely, but I hate the culture of only certain hair colours and styles being favoured. 

I see people posting their looks, asking for feedback and 9/10, there is someone saying that hairstyle doesn’t score well or the hair is too dark. Or it’s dyed and people prefer “natural” colours. 

People dye their hair in real life. People have different coloured hair that isn’t dark blonde or light brown in real life. I get that these colours are really pretty, but I wish people didn’t see a model with their hair a certain way and think, “Oh, it’s not one of the ten most liked hairstyles, so we don’t like it.”

Another pet peeve I have about this is a little bit mean, but I just want to get it off my chest lol. There is someone in my FH who uses the same shade of brown and extremely similar make up for every challenge and she is level 70+. She has all these options, but every single one of her dolls look the same. Tan, golden brown hair, light make up. 

Even when the challenge calls for someone dark skinned or a real life person who has a different colour of hair, she won’t change it. I just don’t get it because she has so many hairs and make ups and she doesn’t utilise any of them, even when it calls for it."

Of course, there are untrustworthy influences sent our way in life in attempt to harm us, but another thing to accept is that we are only human. We are not perfect and we can be afflicted with many different kind of sicknesses.

I know this is hard to hear and you may not even have any kind of disorder and I am not a doctor, so don’t take my word for it, but there is no shame in seeing a doctor to discuss what you are going through. 

I do pray for you for, though, that whatever you are experiencing, God will heal you. He doesn’t want you to suffer or feel scared. 

God gave us intelligent minds that people have put to use through many kinds of medicines and other kinds of support (like counselling). Something may be troubling you and hindering you in your prayers, there is no shame in seeking help. God wants us to seek help through Him and through the people he has blessed to work and help others. 

God bless you. Jesus loves you. No one wants you to feel scared or have your relationship with God suffer. God isn’t mad at you, He only wants what is best for you. Keep your faith in Him."

offmychest,fcvxu9o,t3_ej6dce,1578012563.0,"Your instructor won’t feel like you’ve wasted his time, especially if they are so patient and wonderful like you say. 

Have you done a simulated test with your instructor? If you haven’t, you should ask to, it’s basically a checklist of all the things you will do in your driving test. They run through it with you in almost the same way the person giving the test will, except it’s a practice test, so it’s okay if you mess something up.

Also, I suggest making a list of the things you feel really confident doing while driving, if you are good at changing lanes and sticking to the speed limit at all times, write that as a win and congratulate yourself. If you struggle with parallel parking, write that down as something you aren’t confident in and try to identify what part gets you stuck, is it the judging the front of your car to make sure it’s in the right position before you turn it in or is it that you aren’t confident checking your mirror and understanding the space around your car. (These are just examples).

So, identify those and come up with solutions as to how you can improve those areas. For me, I had a bad habit of still reversing the car before getting it into the correct position to parallel park which resulted in me always being too far away from the curb.

When you do more practice, think about those weak areas a little bit extra and remind yourself to try to correct them.

If you don’t pass your test, it’s okay. Think about your friends and family, if they failed something the first time, would you laugh at them or feel annoyed? Unlikely if you are nice person. They will probably just encourage you to try again and that’s fine, you don’t have to pass everything you do on the first try even if others think you should.

As for feeling anxious, that’s normal to a degree. It’s very common to feel anxious when a deadline is approaching, especially if people are watching you perform that task. You could consider taking some anxiety relaxing natural medicine if possible, pharmacies usually sell them over the counter. Even travel sickness medicine can help anxiety sometimes. Also, just breathe and tell yourself that you can do this, you’ve practiced and just stay very alert. Every time you feel your mind wandering to how anxious you are, try to focus it back in the moment, so you can do the task efficiently. 

But most importantly, give yourself the permission to be imperfect. You might not pass the first time, but that’s fine. Try again. It’s okay to make mistakes.

A healthy amount of anxiety while driving every now and then is good. If you are always extremely relaxed and just making decisions on the road without a care, then it shows you don’t care about people’s lives. However, having healthy amounts of anxiety like, “This person is way too close to me on this windy road” or, “I probably should have slowed down on that orange light because I had the time to, I’ll correct that next time it happens” shows that you care about being a safe driver. 

Even when you get your full license, you will still make mistakes. You might even one day have an accident. That’s the risk of driving, no one is a perfect driver. Even your instructor has gone over the speed limit or changed lanes when they shouldn’t have, maybe they have even scratched their car against a fence. Everyone makes mistakes. People aren’t perfect.

Recognising your flaws and improving upon them will make you a better and more confident driver.

Good luck. Just take some pressure of yourself 👍"
