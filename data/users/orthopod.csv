Using weight guidelines work for the average baby, who is expected to be at that weight after 2 years of age.  Your baby, if much larger and heavier, is an outlier.

Infants have disproportionately large heads and weak neck muscles that can not adequately protect against flexion/distraction injuries in a typical head on crash.  Thus they need to face backwards with their head supported until their neck muscle strength, and bones reach sufficient strength.
