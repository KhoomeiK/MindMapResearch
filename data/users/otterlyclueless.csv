Also, the points are awarded for the thought behind it as well. So an evil deed done for a good cause is less of a penalty or a good deed done for the wrong reasons (wanting points for doing good) actually makes you lose points.

Every culture views things differently so now you have to adopt the culture of where you are at or risk losing points for your different values and beliefs."

TheMonkeysPaw,ff9sufs,t1_ff9sfgc,1579720502.0,"The electoral college is not the issue. The issue is the cap on votes overall and per state and the other issue people have with it, is an inherent feature built in to prevent what those same people want. No single state or a few cities should control the whole election process. Which is what would happen if it were to go away. It's designed for equal vote per area not per person as there are too many people crammed into very few areas in some states.
