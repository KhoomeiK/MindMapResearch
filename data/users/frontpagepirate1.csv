AskReddit,ffezql3,t3_eta2y3,1579871585.0,"They wanted to get rid of me for budget cuts but my boss kept me. But in the end the job didn't work out. It was a mix of factors. Their side was i wasn't paying close enough attention to detail, I wasn't proactively seeking out work to do when it was slow. 

And from my point of view, the way they did things was so backwards and needlessly complex that it made the amount of attention to detail required too high. And the times where I tried to find work for myself, they would often shoot me down because they had a future plan for that task that would never come to fruition. Or I would try to modernize a process and spend a bunch of time getting that working only to be told after I'd done everything that it was all pointless because they wouldn't be changing. 

At one point the boss told me in the same conversation that I wasn't seeking enough opportunities to change things but also that they were very possessive of how things were and didn't like when things changed....

I felt cold in my extremities so I put on my flannel PJs but no luck, I was still cold. I crawled into bed under the covers but nothing, still cold. Even when my wife came to bed she commented that my nose felt cold. 

I started shivering and I felt like I was going to die. Then I felt like I was dying. Then I felt like I was dead.  I woke up the next day of course but I've never felt so much dread in all my life.

AskReddit,ffc6htg,t3_esucyz,1579792665.0,"There are certain barriers to entry that tend to favor left wing people. First you have to know about reddit and that alone filters out a great number of people who don't use such platforms. Then after you find out about it, you have to go to it, and once you go to it you have to want to make an account and eventually start posting on it.

So already you've filtered out a huge swath of the overall population that wouldn't do any of that. The remainder are most likely left leaning since they're tech savy enough to create an account and start posting. And tech savy people are usually left leaning.

Which isn't to say that there aren't tech savy right leaning people. But as soon as you get to reddit and see that it has a left wing slant then most people will be put off on using reddit and they'll go to other platforms. Or they're surpressed by the left leaning people who are using reddit. Which ends up in a feedback loop where reddit is more and more left leaning which pushes more and more right leaning people of the site."
BrandNewSentence,ffc5249,t1_ffbx8h0,1579791703.0,"My theory is that at a young age women are perceived by guys as having some kind of otherworldly significance because of their power to reject them. Then the pressure of the possibility of rejection builds up and leads ultimately to rejection or if it doesn't lead to rejection it leads to the guy putting too much pressure on the relationship since he doesn't know how to handle it. In the long run this pushes the girl away because who wants to deal with that kind of pressure all the time?

After a feedback loop of such situations it's easy to fall back on the notion that it's the women's fault because self reflection is hard for a lot of people and it's a lot easier to blame your problems on others, when in reality it's their own self esteem issues and the sheer amount of pressure they put on the relationship to succeed if one does start.

(of course this doesn't include those who legitimately had significant others who were abusive... always have to put this disclaimer in)

What they need to realize is that girls are people like them, yeah some are different in personality but so are other guys. Society doesn't help either with the weird messages we put out like ""Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus"" or ""What do women want? Who knows? They're such a mystery"". No they aren't, they want food, shelter, companionship and entertainment.

Yeah maybe the choice of type of food, shelter, companionship or entertainment, might differ, along with the priority level they place, but fundamentally it's all the same. And the idea that ""There's someone out there for everyone"" or ""Everyone deserves happiness"" that builds a sense of entitlement. Plenty of people go through life never finding anyone, and even if you believe the notion that everyone deserves happiness (which isn't true) that doesn't mean that you'll always get what you deserve because the world doesn't work that way.

By the time these guys are older they already have such a misplaced notion of the significance of a having a woman in their lives they put her on a pedestal and never want to let her go for fear of being rejected again and being seen as a failure which leads to an unhealthy level of obsession.

All of this is of course exacerbated by the fact that people tend to not even know enough about themselves to know what they really want out of someone else which adds confusion to the mix and leads people to just say and do what they think the other person wants them to do.

I mean thinking back to the time of T.V. there were only so many times you could watch the same Law and Order episodes before you started to go crazy. So socializing was a way of alleviating boredom. However over time it's harder and harder to be bored because we're flooded with options. So people rarely get bored to the point that they think ""Oh hey lets go hang out with \[Friend 1\]"". 

So if you have people that are already introverted like me for example, I no longer feel the need to go socialize as much as I would have. I'll just binge watch some show on Netflix, then switch youtube, maybe play a game, then go get some food, come back and rinse repeat.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fegia6e,t3_eouglc,1579093628.0,"I don't know man. After Jennifer Lawrence confessed that she wanted to ask Seth Meyers out, Nicole Kidman confessed that the wanted to go out with Jimmy Fallon, Olivia Wilde married Jason Sudeikis, Scarlet Johanson is dating Colin Jost, and Pete Davidson has been with Ariana Grande and Kate Beckinsale, I'm starting to think that being funny might actually be a decent character trait that girls are attracted to."
wow,fegfy1z,t3_eoy0pi,1579091448.0,"430 shaman and I didn't run into any issues. Someone told me in advance that they were having trouble with it so I just made sure to CC more. Like if I ran into 3 mobs, I'd CC/interupt the caster while DPSing everything else down. As mentioned in another comment here, the mobs seem to enjoy putting stacking debuffs on players so if you aren't watching those you'll die a lot for sure. Just don't chain pull, kill a group and watch for the debuff to fade before you move on. 

I'm a big fan of this tbh, it makes me actually pay attention to what's going on rather than straight chain pulling the whole zone. I hope they do more of it."
wow,fegfj1a,t3_ep0z48,1579091037.0,"I kept seeing people complain that they were reusing zones but I really enjoyed seeing the old zones again. Sometimes you forget that the rest of the world is even there when you barely if ever have to interact with it. It makes it feel more like... you know... an actual world. 

I don't want them to be just constantly adding new land masses every patch/expansion. We'll run out of ocean after long enough."

facepalm,fedlx1k,t1_fedl7r3,1579014758.0,Based on the number of people criticizing these people as if it were real in the comments... no.
wow,fedlsrl,t3_eombvu,1579014679.0,You get AP from doing pretty much anything in the game and at this point the amount gained is at the point where getting AP isn't hard. And doing the unlock quest for Naz Jatar gets you a solid bump in neck level. But if you want to do stuff there are things you'll need to do to be able to do stuff that's just... you know... how everything in the world works including classic so I don't really know what your objective here is. But the neck grind isn't that bad really.

wow,fedcyw6,t1_fed3o38,1579007989.0,Yeah the legendary system sounded sweet but it ended up being really annoying trying to balance tier sets vs legendary pieces and being under powered if you didn't get the legendary you needed. Yeah they changed it later on to where you could buy the legendary you wanted but there were just too many systems stacked on each other to be fun.

wow,fedc0bs,t1_fedbkuo,1579007128.0,Don't you already need to have a high level character to unlock a DH? So a beginner wouldn't really be able to play one.
wow,fedbk3v,t1_fed9h1v,1579006710.0,I'd say the main story with Sylvanas was bad but the Jaina and Rastakan stories were pretty sweet.
wow,fedbgs5,t3_eokk9r,1579006626.0,"I liked BFA just fine. I liked the Jaina and Rastakan storylines. Bwonsamdi is a cool character, they basically had a lot of cool characters and plotlines that actually made me feel feelings which was nice. They also had some interesting plot reveals that make me curious about what's going to happen in the future.

We got a lot of cutscenes and cinematics, which I enjoyed.

I liked the raids

Warfronts were alright. Still felt like they put them out to test them for some future implementation rather than as a full fledged feature but I still had fun with them.

Island Expeditions were alright. They didn't wow me at all but I began to enjoy them as we learned more about them.

Overall I give the expansion like a 6.5/10. Wasn't the best, wasn't the worst. Had its good points and bad points. But I mean following Legion this expansion has to do a whole lot of setting up for whatever is going to come next so it's unsurprising to me that this one wouldn't seem as epic."
