Gun control works for the most part in places like Canada and Australia because it’s national law. Here we have states and cities that pass very strict gun control but it doesn’t work because states next door have lax gun laws so firearms easily flood in.

Until the law changes, there’s going to be a need in my opinion for people to exercise their lawful right to own and carry firearms. Because the chances of someone busting into your home or church or school with a gun is higher here than in places where guns aren’t readily available.

If no one there had been armed and they’d waited for the police to arrive, how many would be dead? Look at the body count in the previous Texas church shooting. Look at the Miami club shooting where it took police three fucking hours to breach the club, by which time the shooter had combed back over his victims to shoot them again just to make sure they weren’t playing dead, and many had bled to death.

It can be a serious complication for people undergoing certain cancer treatments, e.g. those that affect bone marrow, not just people taking T supplements.

An AE isn’t necessarily cause by the vaccine. If there are more AE in the control group for example, that helps to rule out the vaccine as the causaul agent. If people only knew the rigors that vaccines have to go through in order to be approved. 

No vaccine is perfect, in terms of efficacy and absence of  AEs (though some, like the recently approved ebola vax, seem to nearly be). 

But when you have something like the seasonal flu vaccine that’s been formulated and tested for over 50 years, that generally has high efficacy (>60%) and low serious adverse reactions (0.01:100), what more do you want?
