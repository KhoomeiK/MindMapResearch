Most birds are like this - walk by without paying attention to them, and they're like ""alright the human's just passing by, no need for us to even move"". But stand and *look at them*, and they get tense. And then if you try to take something out, or try to take a picture, they GTFO. So I don't know how to show them that I'm trying to bribe them specifically.

City pigeons are an exception - they're just very bread-oriented I guess - and seagulls also will not move and will try to assert dominance over humans instead. 

Oh and it doesn't help that I have dogs (who I don't allow to chase birds, but still), and that I once saved some baby rabbits from a local hooded crow, so Idk they might just consider me a narc now."

science,ff9hzo2,t1_ff9glo0,1579713427.0,">Weirdly enough the media supports body positivity even though it’s reckless to society.

Hell no, body positivity literally *saves lives*. Being body positive and against fat-shaming is not the same as propagating unhealthy eating. We can say ""no, you're not gross, and you can love yourself the way you are"" and also say ""it would be best for you to eat more veggies and whole foods and be active every day, so that you get healthier and feel better"" - and *there is no contradiction there*.

No fat person ever has been fat because some media now says it's okay, or because they don't get bullied enough by their peers. Fatness is ultimately an issue of self control and mental health. You don't fix those problems by introducing more stress into the situation."
AskReddit,ff93ct4,t1_ff8q4j5,1579703842.0,"Yeah ""keep asking questions"" is incomplete advice. What you really need to do is **ask a question** about something about the person that genuinely interests you (even a little), then **react** appropriately to the reply you get, and **riff off** that reply with your own thoughts or experiences on the matter (without going into a monologue about yourself, keep it short and leave them wanting for more), and ask your partner a **follow-up question** or leave a pause there if you anticipate they're gonna ask you something. The process should be infinitely repeatable as long as your partner actually wants to talk to you.

When it comes to starting conversations, I usually just begin with an observation or a joke based on the situation or the environment we're both in. Sharing positive emotions is a powerful move as well, but complaining about something will also unite people. And don't worry about silent moments, they're totally alright to have."

Either way, it's just a recommendation from strangers on the Internet. Obviously nobody here is making OP break up with her boyfriend, we can't do that. But a lot of the time people in bad relationships could actually use a wake up call, which is why I'm refusing to tone down my reaction in case he isn't actually *that* bad."

I think they're intentionally trying to do absurd and silly ""bad humor"" that the show is known for, but it's easy to make it too silly and just too bad to be good. And some people simply don't appreciate silliness at all.

If you watch SNL, they have an amazing writing team and so many talents there, and the show is once a week not four days a week, but they still often end up with a lot of sketches that are... well... the kind that make me think ""I hope at least the cast had fun."" Yet these talented professionals clearly thought or hoped it was gonna be funny. It just shows how hard writing comedy is. SNL obviously end up with lots of great sketches as well, just like Conan's show does. 

And notice how good stand-up comedians usually don't have a lot of new material all the time, even when they're just extremely funny people in real life and great at improv? It's because writing comedy is harder."
