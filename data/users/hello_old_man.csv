LAClippers,fdbz749,t1_fdbz1ta,1578264139.0,def improving on the midrange this season. Zu also showing signs of improvement on the midrange
LAClippers,fdbynyr,t1_fdbyc5g,1578263954.0,"Agreed, but you gotta give him credit for he does dominate in the paint with 2-3 guys in the paint quite often. But varying outlet passes from time to time can create a better shot."
LAClippers,fdbyftp,t3_ekildz,1578263833.0,"Damn, Lou. You gotta open your eyes a bit more to not make those careless passes. Gotta clean that shit up with the turnovers."
LAClippers,fdby9uw,t1_fdbxj9o,1578263747.0,"Def helps with Clipper droughts, very timely indeed."
LAClippers,fdby4j2,t1_fdbxfyz,1578263668.0,"Agreed, he does need to work on the defensive end though. He gets into foul trouble pretty early in the game. And if he can stay consistent with his early 3's, it will help tremendously to get the Clips rolling with momentum."
LAClippers,fdbxaz6,t1_fdbx5tl,1578263391.0,"I'm going to vouch for Green. He helps a lot on the rebounding end, he fights for those boards, and spreads the floor with his solid 3's. Very dependable player."
LAClippers,fdbwx41,t1_fdbvxv7,1578263171.0,"I do agree that Moe is better defensively, but Morris is at least above average on the defensive end, and he would allow for more options offensively. Overall, I think he's the better player, he has the grit and fits in with the Clippers style of play. 
But, I do have a lot of respect for Moe's impact with Clips."
LAClippers,fdbvkk8,t1_fdbv1v5,1578262660.0,"Well, imo I think he would make an impact in the playoffs, and that's all we need right now, to focus on the championship this season. We can figure out deets for next season later, I'm sure we'd be still fine without his presence next season."
LAClippers,fdbustl,t3_ekildz,1578262301.0,"Let's recruit Nash, I bet he still got it!"

LAClippers,fdbtw8n,t3_ekildz,1578262041.0,PG HEATING UP!!
LAClippers,fd5redk,t1_fd5lg2s,1578180640.0,"Agreed.

fucking turnovers, I think they all are at a career high in turnovers. Careless passes, don't know how to fucking communicate. Unnecessary ISO from Kawhi. George taking too much threes. Lou making some wild passes thinking every team member is an elite receiver like Trez."
LAClippers,fd5q5ta,t1_fd5kfdr,1578180227.0,"Tyus Jones, Jalen Brunson, or the popular opinon of D. Rose. 

Harkless, 2Pat, McGruder, Walton Jr would be necessary candidates to make the trade worth it. I don't know who would even want Rome, but he needs to go. He has his moments, but they're very rare, def a detriment to the team overall."
LAClippers,fd5p7no,t1_fd5mllv,1578179913.0,"Agreed, PnR every time gets predictable and easy to catch on. I mean I know it works because Lou and Trez play it so fluidly, but damn Doc, vary that shit up a bit. He's very old school fundamentals. I mean it's tried and true, but he got no fresh ideas."
LAClippers,fd5ocuf,t1_fd5khce,1578179644.0,"Agreed, he's their emotional leader and has the respect of everyone on the team, always putting in the effort every game. 

Kawhi needs to lower his ego down a few notches and learn to express positive communication with the team. I know he's a reserved and prefers to keep a low profile, and he has this thick wall that makes it hard for ppl to approach him. He needs to open up, even just a little bit helps."
LAClippers,fd5moc5,t1_fd5mdzk,1578179128.0,"Yeh, true. I agree with that."
LAClippers,fd5mep5,t1_fd5m3wa,1578179046.0,He don't play B2B games.
LAClippers,fd5m42v,t1_fd5lfk6,1578178951.0,"I think we'll have Pat back in the line-up. With Trez and Pat energy, Knicks don't got a chance. 

*knock on wood"
LAClippers,fd5kfvt,t3_ek3ulm,1578178501.0,"Shitty lost of morale with their 3pt onslaught.

well, at least tmwr we got the Knicks beat tmwr. They can take out their frustration on them to gain some confidence back."
LAClippers,fd5ilks,t1_fd5hg6l,1578177970.0,"THey really need to work on their chemistry, need to be more vocal with each other and learn to respect each other's game. There's no trust and comararaderie. It's an ego thing."
LAClippers,fd5hjab,t1_fd5gf2g,1578177717.0,we need McGruder on him
LAClippers,fd5h3bf,t1_fd5gbcr,1578177575.0,"Could be the effects of his injury taking its toll. At times, he doesn't hustle as hard as he did before imo."
LAClippers,fd5fxx2,t1_fd5f2bc,1578177252.0,"OKC is looking pretty good right now, and he's a solid sixth man for them. But, I agree Schroder would be a great addition. I just think we need to trade Jerome, I mean he does have his moments, but for the most part he's more of a detriment to the team."
LAClippers,fd5dr61,t1_fd5c1ch,1578176651.0,"If we could somehow work out a trade for Tyus Jones who has I think the top assist turnover ratio, that would be great. That or Jalen Brunson, or D Rose would be pretty ideal as well."
LAClippers,fcoy8vy,t1_fcm2uo0,1577844898.0,"SGA ain't better than PG right now in his career, but it's not a stretch to say he will be just as good or has the potential to be better than PG. SGA is doing better overall than PG did in his first two years.

bipolar,fcfwon6,t1_fcfpmeu,1577634408.0,"Interesting. So these panic attacks can occur at any time while you are in your manic phase? Say, just at home on your own, just as you can have one while you are out in public?

Do you get cold sweats during these panic attacks? And do you see visible hallucination of fire or frigid colors when it gets bad?

That sounds really aggravating to experience. Have you been able to find a way to alleviate the intensity? i.e. slow, deep breaths/ directing your mind towards something positive 

My anxiety filled panic attacks occur during what I think is my depressive state - overly self-conscious of how ""capable"" I am perceived by others. Usually during this time, my cognitive mind malfunctions and I'm unable to sometimes form a cohesive sentence. While attempting to listen to another,  just even comprehending the words of simple sentences become scattered in my mind and I put extreme pressure to focus, but my mind drifts away which then initiates my panic mode, in which I get cold sweats and attempt to remove myself from any social contact and negative thoughts inundate my mind growing rapidly into a path towards a ""bad place""."
bipolar,fcfom55,t1_fcfkue3,1577632307.0,"Do you feel those hot panic attacks after you exert actions of what you consider to be your personal mania due to thoughts of how you are perceived? (while you are in confrontation with another individuals(s) then..you overcome those feelings of feelings of being judged and then you continue on with your manic, confident self ?

I have not experienced tactile hallucinations, could you elaborate an example of what you experience during this? I don't know how you feel, but it must be quite taxing to your state of mind. 

I myself, am diagnosed with Bipolar II btw."
bipolar,fcfk0p2,t3_eh5jez,1577630721.0,"A beautifully rendered painting - from my personal absorption of your your art, I resonate with your feelings, well, at least to a certain degree in accordance to my perspective. I yearn for those ""bubbly"" excitable thoughts that race through my mind, wanting to ride that free-feeling wave of joy, but often get abruptly interrupted with thoughts of guilt disrupting my joyous thoughts wiping out the flow of hope - then I plunge into a pit of despair that seems unescapable, feeling that I deserve being below the grasp of hope. 

Time passes, then a random thought will arise, usually triggered by a fond, positive memory, or a thought of what I can potentially be. These thoughts fill my mind that sparks a movement towards hope. 

Though, the thing is, this process repeats itself, over and over and over again. It frustrates my state of mind to experience the downs and ups of my overall state of mind. It chips at my motivation to do better. 

But, here I am, yearning for that balance that can easily tip one way in a flash, just as easily able to tip the other way. 

Your art resonates with my feelings, at least my interpretation of it. Thank you for sharing your emotions. 

Sending thoughts of love towards your state of mind."

LAClippers,fc21un4,t1_fc20vjq,1577337100.0,"I'm not mad about it. 

Bulls, we had no Lou, no Kawhi, and Lavine was hot. They're 10th in the East, but they currently are not too far away from making playoffs. 

OKC - defeating the Clips would make it their fourth 15 pt comeback within the span of a week, so they can play phenomenal with pressure. And they got one of the all time greatest Clips in CP3. also, no Kawhi 

HOU - if Doc just challenged that call before Lou went off and got ejected, we would have had Lou in the 4th quarter to do what he does best in the 4th. 

we're at a good place right now considering the games Kawhi has missed."
