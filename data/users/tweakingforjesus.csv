As I pointed out they continued to invest $ in the US when they get near 0 interest.  And while I agree nothing should be hidden in the budget, it is important to recognize that the government is not a business and is should not be treated like one for the reasons outlined in my earlier post.

1. No one is saying that military spending should be completely cut.  Why would you even think that when I mentioned was that it should be considered as *part* of the problem along with the domestic entitlement items you mentioned?  You are making an absurd argument.

2. It is not in the constitution that the military shall consume 22% of the federal budget.  We both know that is a silly argument against reducing its budget.

3. But it does exist for now.  Use it while it lasts then change as conditions require.

And when that government controls the world's reserve currency, all bets are off. Other countries were lending us their money even when they received near zero interest because the only thing worse would be keeping it in their own currency.  How many businesses do you know that can say that?

> Thomas Sowell has pointed out that the major debt drivers are Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. All left wing programs.

But not the military that consumes a quarter of the budget?  Remember we learned in the last post that $ is fungible.  You can't complain that some spending causes the deficit but other spending doesn't. If you want to reduce the deficit, you need to identify priorities and makes cuts in areas that aren't.  Or increase income by removing last year's tax cuts for the wealthy.  But you can't point at just domestic entitlement spending and say that's the problem."

Cutting the deficit is the key to cutting the debt.  You were complaining about spending.  This is about spending.  If you can't understand this simple point, there is no reason to continue.

> Clinton didn’t support the budget cuts, it was Gingrich who dragged him along.

Hey, the data shows what the data shows.  

> Clinton’s budget surplus was false, because it didn’t factor in the continued growth of unfunded liabilities

No.  The surplus is there.  The math is simple.  $ in - $ out = surplus/deficit.  Unfunded liabilities will be included when they are realized.  Funny you don't mention this when Obama brought all of Bush's off-the-books spending into the budget 2009-2010.

> Reagan’s continued growth of of the deficit was not only from expanding the military, but to get the military to end the Cold War, the Democrat ran Congress required added domestic spending.

So the money that Reagan spent was covered by the budget, but the money spent by the evil democrats was not covered?  We could say the democrats spent within the budget but Reagan overspent with funding the military.  $ is fungible.  And besides, the Soviet Union would have fallen apart anyway.  Very little Reagan did changed that one way or another.

> Spending originates in the House and the only time that 
Conservative leadership (versus the RINO political insiders who retire to cush lobbying jobs) was in power and running the financial show was Gingrich. See point 2.

And spending has to be approved by the Senate and signed by the president.  Remember the government shutdowns of recent years due to not having a budget?  Those were caused by the President refusing to agree to certain budget spending items, not Congress.
