Varathane stain and polyurethane, 3 coats each I believe. As far as fake wood, I'd imagine not well. Natural wood is porous so the stain soaks in."

Just a little sensitive to this stuff after going crazy in a hospital from a drug allergy. That poor womans coochie and shitty tits are all over the internet.

iamatotalpieceofshit,ffe4sn9,t3_et2mwo,1579836700.0,"I'm pretty sure chewing them would kill them quite fast, as opposed to snakes swallowing them whole, or raptors ripping them apart. There's nothing happening here that nature's already done. As far as actually enjoying the chewy, crunchy, meat gushers...its all cultural. I'm sure that many cultures would rather eat monkey brains than try to stomach easy cheese."
intermittentfasting,ffdh61w,t3_eszsc0,1579820771.0,You are correct. Diabetics can go into uncontrollable ketosis (ketoacidosis) when they dont get enough insulin. My wife's breath has a sweet salami smell when she gets too high of blood sugar.
