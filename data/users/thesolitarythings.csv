Futurology,fe6tojf,t1_fe1myw4,1578904988.0,"Why would you measure the net flow of money in or out of a business by way of the quantity of jobs being created or cut? That's just inflammatory speak that doesn't actually portray the flow of economy in or out of a store. 

In the more realistic scenario that walmart is cutting 50 cashier jobs that pay 15k a year and replacing them with 5 operator jobs that pay 40k a year and 5 IT guys or maintenance people that are being paid 60k a year, you're only seeing a net loss of 50k average salary in the new system. And I included some pretty generous esitmates for the average cashier who is LIKELY only being making 8-12k yearly salary (it's walmart)."

One of the most painful things one has to deal with when one is depressed, is apathy from others and feeling like there's no one who cares to listen. At this time i'm in a much better place and it's partly due to being able to have conversations like this with you and others that made it possible. Please know that if you ever need the same that you shouldn't hesitate to shoot me a message :)"

SuicideWatch,fcdfsis,t1_fcbdoke,1577609615.0,"I thought that some things were unfixable because I had been that way for as long as I could remember. My tendencies and emotional reactions to certain situations were unchanging even if I could train myself to channel the emotions in certain ways. Ultimately the things I detest most about myself are those very tendencies reactions which I think made me a lesser person. 

I still feel the same way, and lack feelings of self worth because of it. In the past, these feelings used to be so strong that I felt a deep need to kill myself, but now I think these feelings are counteracted by the love I have for those around me, and a revulsion to burdening them with my death, so I stick around.

Sometimes things don't work out, in that you can try your best but that doesn't always lead to the desired outcome."
SuicideWatch,fc772u0,t1_f9zdrw9,1577499283.0,"Sorry for how late this reply is. But to answer your question, I grew up in an abusive household and developed dysthemia at a very young age due to trauma that happened when I was a child. During much of my adolescence I idealized suicide as a means of escape from the abuse. My dysthemia was diagnosed but went untreated and gradually worsened from suicide idealation to major depression and PTSD. As soon as I was old enough, I cut ties with my family and traveled across the country to attend university. 

At university I was faced with the harsh reality that even though I had escaped the abuse, a lot of it had left a deep impression on my personality and psyche and I felt that I was unfixable. My boyfriend at the time did so much to encourage me to get better so I made some money and got treatment. After several years I still hadnt found a treatment that worked for my general depression (although the PTSD was effectively dealt with yay!) and this lack of progress was disheartening. Most days I was too tired to keep trying (hello depression) to fix myself and this ultimately led to me neglecting myself and my boyfriend. I had stopped showering, eating, talking to anyone, attending classes or appointments. I alternated between ignoring my boyfriend and telling him I wanted to kill myself. Eventually I broke up with him because I had too much respect for him and the relationship to keep treating him that way. At this point, I had (or thought) I had no one left that I cared about. And that was exactly what I wanted.

Now usually my suicidal thoughts come at night and I sleep on it and in the morning I feel a bit better. But one day I woke up and just felt the same way as I did when I fell asleep the previous night and I knew that was it. I was satisfied that I made a decent effort that I felt was fair to myself, to get better. And I know as well as anyone that sometimes things just don't work out. And that was ok. I hope this gives some insight into how someone struggling with depression might feel before making that choice."
SuicideWatch,fc76qjw,t1_f9zqfsa,1577499026.0,"I figured I'd put it out there that shortly after meeting my ex, I changed my mind about suicide, and this time I'm confident that it's for good. I'm just a stranger but I hope that if my comment did linger in the back of your mind you could let it go. Thanks for the concern."
