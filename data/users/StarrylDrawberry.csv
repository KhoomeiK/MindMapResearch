That's a prime directive at this point and it's not changing. Also I'm not just going to do it because the authorities say it's ok or whatever you're trying to say here. It's still a case of the stronger individual hurting the weaker individual. The one exception I will make would be if my child were in danger. Then all bets are off. It's my duty to protect them and that's gonna happen.
