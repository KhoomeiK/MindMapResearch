I never assume the worst... The more negative you think, the more negative you are. Not how I choose to go through life."

Definitely move on to the other two books. They were amazing."

Lost our first dog, a golden, and our second dog, a vizsla, to lymphoma. It sucks."

Had a Vizsla that we lost at almost 9 because of lymphoma. It’s hard when they don’t live out their natural life span."

scifi,fd4r4nd,t3_ejtnmv,1578170263.0,"Because SyFy is a part of the NBC/Universal/Comcast Family, it is free or very cheap for them to show movies from their library. That’s why you sometimes see movies on that have no relation what-so-ever to science fiction. 

I’ll never forget one of the reasons SciFi (at the time) said they cancelled Farscape. They said they wanted to attract more female viewers. I think Farscape probably attracted more females than just about any other scifi show ever. We sent them bras to show how many women were watching. Don’t remember how many they got, but we did ask them to donate them to a women’s shelter..."

IfIFitsISits,fd4jdfl,t1_fcycsrv,1578168027.0,"We have no idea. We assume she was swept up in a feral colony and spayed. The shelter we got her from had no record of how they even got her. 

Harley is a 7.5 pound treasure. She picked my husband by just crawling in his lap, laying down and not leaving. She’s sweet and loving and friendly to all. Helps that we have 2 large dogs which keeps them on their toes. 

The tabby is a 12 pound male named Boomer. He’s mine. He makes “booms” and is afraid of booms. He’s sweet also, but is not as demanding for attention as Harley. And they get along."

I lost my cat Callie to a jaw tumor several years ago. It was really making it hard for her to eat and finally she had so much muscle loss from not eating enough that I had to let her go. Other than that, the worst things were drooling and bad breath/drool. She was still happy and friendly until the end. 

Even sadder, we lost our other cat exactly a month earlier to sudden kidney failure. 

When she was only a couple of years old she had a growth in her mouth in the same area. Vet removed it and she lived for years, so we were lucky. 

I hope you have lots of good memories with Snickers."

FuckImOld,fbmd70o,t3_edr5ah,1576982022.0,"I highly recommend yoga. I’m 57 and started yoga 1 1/2 years ago. I HATE exercise. Yoga is the first thing I don’t hate as it keeps your mind as busy as your body. 

I have a lot less aches and pains, less headaches, I sleep better and even got motivated to diet and lost 30 lbs in the last 7 months. 

I will not exercise at home, so I pay the monthly fee and schedule 3 classes a week. I go to the studio and do it. I enjoy the communal time because I work at home and spend a lot of time alone. 

Try it. You may like it. There’s lots of it on YouTube. ."
