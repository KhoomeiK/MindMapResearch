2.

socialanxiety,feg0q06,t3_eotrd2,1579071989.0,"Best analogy I've ever seen. It's not like I *don't* value any social interaction, just my battery drains faster, but tops off faster - a quick few minute chat is enough to keep me from going crazy, but if it drags on too long and/or too many people, I get all anxious"

Anxiety,feg00l7,t3_eowhom,1579071180.0,"One way is to just listen in to others talking, like in a public space I guess - don't be a creep and eavesdrope on 'private' conversations, but if people are talking about stuff you're interested in, join in! That's how I found my friends (vidya games)"

raisedbynarcissists,fefzfa7,t1_fedbyem,1579070513.0,"I'm paying a little less than market value for rent, I guess it's a CBA of ""keeping my mental health"" vs ""saving lots of money every month"", it sucks"

""Our fax machine won't work! Fix it! Fix it!""  
\>checks our switch, I can see the ATA (analog telephone adapter, its basically a digital to analog converter, take in Ethernet, pass over analog telephone signal) online. If I can see that, and if I make a call and can see the port ring, the issue is usually with wiring or the machine itself.  


The problem was THEY DIDNT FUCKING HAVE A TELEPHONE CABLE PLUGGED INTO THE FAX MACHINE FROM THE ATA, like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCCKKKKKKKKKK  


And they're like ""do they send phone cables with faxes?"" no karen, buy yourself a fucking phone cable and plug it in yourself, a monkey can do it"

CruciblePlaybook,fee4pn6,t3_eolc0s,1579026345.0,"Freelance feels like a dice roll, either carry, get carried, or stomped. I guess it forces you to get guud and learn 2 carry but if you don't immediately click and get in a groove with the others your kinda fucked"
socialanxiety,fecxyf7,t1_feco5ad,1578989172.0,I've been bamboozled!
AskReddit,fecw89r,t1_fecvj7y,1578987090.0,"How does one make peace with that, while trying to keep this vicious monster at bay? I feel I spend a good third of the day running a gauntlet against the demons and monsters and villains causing this horrible feedback loop that feeds and feeds itself to a insurmountable peak During the work day I'm good about putting a lid on all of it, but as soon as I'm on lunch and when I'm out of work I just breakdown and the monster takes over - sadboi hours.  


I get the chain needs to break - in order to feel self worth you have to look around, and know thyself, but I don't know *how* to break the chain."
AskReddit,fecvkaz,t1_fecvdxa,1578986331.0,"I compare myself, similar situation, to Jonas from the Giver when they're starting to get 'feelings', good and bad, for the first time.
