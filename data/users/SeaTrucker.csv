personalfinance,ffd4q6o,t1_ffctv7p,1579813381.0,"I've seen /r/ChildFree and it honestly makes me a little sad. Not because there's healthy happy adults in stable relationships who don't want kids, but because of how cynical and negative the posts are. If you don't want children that's fine, if you want to be a stay at home mother straight out of a 1950s sitcom, that's fine too. One of the greatest achievements of classical feminism was allowing women the choice of whether to be homemakers and stay at home mothers, or workers in the labor force. That subreddit can be downright toxic at worst, and pedantic and patronizing at best. The entire sub is ""hurr durr, kids are dumb, parents are dumb. Look at me I'm going to bars and concerts every weekend I'm interesting."" You can still have a decent and meaningful life with and without kids. My nextdoor neighbors as a kid were a very pleasant catholic family with 4 children. The mother was a bank teller and organized a cooking and wine tasting club and consistently helped run the local food pantry. The father was an engineer and ran a small wood working business and ran all sorts of half marathons and 5ks. 

Another one of my neighbors was an admiral in the navy who didn't have kids til he married into a family with step children. Nice guy. Donated a lot. Active in the community. Helped me find my love for electronics.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think that all children are angels. I flew back on a 14 hour flight from saipan with two other stops before finally stopping in Dallas where my plane was grounded. I had been up for 36 hours. Since my flight wouldn't be til later in the day, I pulled my blanket off of my backpack and laid out to sleep. I had some mother ask me if her kids could use my blanket because they were cold and needed to sleep. I refused. Lady got pissed. Later I pulled out my laptop and watched a movie and played some games with a controller. Mom asked if they could play too because iPad was dead. I refused. Kids got mad, and constantly bothered me. Did I want to throttle one of the little shits? Yes. But I don't hate all kids. The entire sub of /r/ChildFree wants a few things, mainly to have their lifestyle choice not be admonished, and to have child free spaces for them in the community. But in the same vein, they repeatedly mock and loathe women who desire to be nothing other than mothers and express disgust in places that seek to accommodate them.

Honestly basing your life around not having kids is probably worse than basing your life around being a parent. At least with being a parent you can rationalize that due to the large time and financial drain required. They seek meaning in what little they can, because their life is basically just work and home life. With not having kids you have more financial freedom and time to base your life off of anything else. 

/r/Childfree to me is a place that is full of negativity due to the fact that they want to tear down and bash people who have a different lifestyle than them in order to justify and get reaffirmation of their own lifestyle choices. Often because they don't get it from their coworkers, friends, family, etc.

If it's any consolation I don't have any children myself and I tend to equally disapprove of parents or non parents who live exceedingly consumerist lifestyles. I choose to not have kids at the moment because my lifestyle is impractical in regards to maintaining relationships and child rearing. I'm out of the country 6 to 8 months a year and can be without internet or cell connection for weeks. 

I'm not advising you to have children, I'm not trying to ""bingo"" you. I'd rather you not have children due to the fact that you obviously don't want them and like most people, I'd much rather see a child with a loving caring parent than with a parent who obviously resents them or doesn't want them. 

All I'm trying to say, is don't admonish others simply for wanting something you don't, and live for more than some new shinies and yourself, don't work for the sake of working. In the end it doesn't matter how many hours you worked or how many performance metrics you hit. Live a happy and fulfilling life.

Have a wonderful day."
personalfinance,ffctlos,t1_ffcsucd,1579806997.0,"If you don't want to have children, that's fine. Not everyone is the best fit to have children, and children can get in the way of your goals in life. But to not have children and only pursue money? That's a shallow pathetic existence and probably the end result of a consumerist culture. 

Like jeez, start a charity, become an author or artist, get into fitness and a sport, start community outreach projects, become an activist, go green, volunteer. Anything  besides chasing the latest trend. Money is temporary. Aim to pursue something worth more than money."

todayilearned,feko05s,t1_fekmim4,1579204029.0,"Bro. I was of age to vote in the 2016 election.

Hell I've worked a few different political campaigns myself. Not at the presidential level however. I've encountered racist attitudes in both parties, racist comments from campaign staff, everything from block walking crews to regional directors. Candidate wise I've never heard anything bad from the candidates I've worked with myself. Although the Governor whose campaign I worked was a massive dick in person.

Do I like Trump? Not at all. As a veteran I despise that he hasn't withdrawn us from the middle east and is basically selling the US armed forces to Saudi Arabia. As a gun owner his 2A record sickens me. 

But to call Trump a fascist is deceitful at worst and disingenuous at best. It'd be like calling Hillary Clinton a socialist when she's clearly just another Neocon, or calling Elizabeth Warren a commie."

Edit: neither party gives a shit about the average person and their wellbeing. Literally every single politician is beholden to their interest groups. ""Hurr durr but /u/SeaTrucker muh both sides are the same XD"". I'm not saying both sides are the same. I'm just saying that both sides really only give a shit about their corporate interests. If Republicans are really the party of big business and the rich then why do most corporate donations go to democratic candidates and most donations made by the rich go to democratic candidates? Politics in the United states are basically at the point where they are designed to continue the status quo and keep the Economic system running.
