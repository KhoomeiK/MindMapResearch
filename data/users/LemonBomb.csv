antiMLM,fffm1xb,t1_fff1x3t,1579886878.0,The worst thing you can do for your children’s future is have them before you have your education/job/means to take care of them. Kids are not a dog or a handbag to get on a whim. Guarantee if this same person had too many dogs and couldn’t take care of them people would be up in arms but when it’s actual humans suddenly nobody gives a shit.
