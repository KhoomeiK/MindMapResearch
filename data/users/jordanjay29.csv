B5 is a little harder due to the era, long-form fiction was so new that the season 1 shows are more episodic, and the seasons are the full 20+ episode orders that have only really tapered off in the last 10 years.

You're talking about several hours of surgery (assuming no complications), and then days in the hospital being closely monitored for the organ's productivity, then pretty intensive post-release care for the first few months. It seems plausible that we would still have restrictions on patients who make poor candidates for organs because of their own abusive choices. Plus, a lot of these patients have been under a doctor's care for a while as their native organ fails, and getting/staying clean would just be something a good physician would advise on. A pattern of disregarding their doctor's advice so flagrantly makes them a pretty unlikely candidate even now, since post-transplant care requires daily diligence on the part of the patient, even if we wind up with perfect organs that require no immunosuppressants (and I pray we do!) someday, I still think the drug addict is going to be pretty far down the priority list to spend the money on their organ and hospital care just to see them waste it."

Largely agreed. Ender's Game is something that's just so hard to do in a live-action medium. 

First you have the character aging throughout the story (because it literally takes place over the course of 6 years), so either you age up the character as the movie did (which works but murders the timeline of the story), cast several actors to serve as the main character in various points of the story (which doesn't often work well as viewers lack a consistent persona to connect with), or you film it over years which requires enough content and patience and sheer luck with actors' schedules to make it all work (tricky for a movie, plausible for a TV show, both are extremely expensive). 

Then you have the controversial parts of the books. OSC does not shy away from childhood rudeness and the multitudes of taboos violated by the Battle School's children when they're not under supervision. It's realistic, and other unsupervised children stories use the same elements (like Lord of the Flies), but veers into uncomfortable territory for viewers and filmmakers alike. Child nudity, depictions of genitals, bloodthirsty violence (and the trifecta all in one scene with the infamous shower fight). It really doesn't translate well to the screen, not even in an animated form. 

Even if people could be mature enough to simply not watch what they dislike, I doubt our society could handle a faithful adaptation of Ender's Game. It dances along several lines that most films won't cross, and that plus the author's personal views (as OSC is known for being very anti-LGBT+) makes any adaptation a target for complaints and boycotts.

This is basically why every anime-to-live-action movie fails (for various reasons, but this truly lies at the crux of most of them), and why it's terrifying to see live action versions of my favorite anim(e/ated) shows being worked on. 

Please stop, people. Let us enjoy the animation. If people can't figure out that animated shows aren't just for children, then that's *their* loss, but a horrible live action version is a loss for *us all!*"

Yeah, even if you didn't believe the whole ""Iraq is harboring al-Qaeda"" rhetoric, the fearmongering over Iraq having nukes (which is pretty laughable in retrospect, what with all the public intelligence released over Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs to show how nuclear development actually happens) was plenty to engage the American march to war.

Oh lord, this is why I've struggled hard to avoid newly released video games now. I can't enjoy the game because shortly after it's out, someone has beaten it and is griping about end-game content. 

End-game content? Who the fuck cares, I'm still on level 4! 

It just makes me lose motivation for a while and then I usually don't come back to it, or if I do it's years later. 

I love the patient gamers approach now for this, I can ignore the game on release and hear about all the complaints and praise as mere background noise. It filters out and then becomes a distant memory, so by the time I'm ready to play it, I don't care anymore. The strong feelings are gone, and I can just enjoy the game."

I caught the Sherlockian vibe as well, and I think it actually frustrates me more than placates me. I only figured it out Treason as well, so I'll have to see how it works out if/when I read another book. 

I do enjoy Thrawn's more well-roundedness in the new books. I think it's partly because we see him rise through the ranks and deal with those struggles, rather than simply being one of the few remaining authorities of the Empire, and a very unique one at that. Showing *how and why* someone so unique managed to get where he is despite the deck stacked against him is a very fulfilling story. 

Overall, it's a good construct. But I feel like Zahn's characterization errs on the magical side when he writes Thrawn, and when others do it Thrawn seems much more understandable. I dunno, that may just be me."

This is a tactic that Democrats need to adopt, and I keep trying to convince my own family of it. Support the ""radical"" candidates, and you'll get some sanity in government when they inevitably ""meet in the middle"" with the opposition. No, it won't actually be too far left for your comfort, the talk on the campaign trail is almost always too fanatical to survive actual political reality of our government. But what does come out will usually be something that will improve everyone's lives, given enough time.

Under the old officially-licensed model, most of that was S-Canon, though some of the newer stuff was C-Canon. Which meant it wasn't PURE canon, some elements could contradict and be fine, which allowed for artistic license. T-Canon was the TV shows, which were only not the pinnacle of canon just because they weren't movies. The two trilogies were the highest level of canon, anything that contradicted them was wrong, but anything that made it into them was forever enshrined in holy canonization. It stepped down from there, T-Canon was usually the best canonization (especially post-2005) that a book or comic book element could hope for, which was still pretty well enshrined. C-Canon was more like ""soft"" canon, it existed but it could be overwritten by later authors and many debates existed over which elements were *real* or *too-unStar-Wars-y*. S-Canon is the older stuff, like many of the sourcebooks and some of the books before TPM, which weren't really scrutinized as much for continuity or were left to play in the post-OT sandbox before Lucas decided to create the PT (even the Thrawn trilogy has elements of this, Joruus C'baoth in particular).

Disney's new canon wipes away the tiers. The books are supposed to be on the same level as the movies, the comics on the same level of the video games, the movies on the same level as the TV shows, etc. So if something is introduced into, say, a TV show or book, then it is true for the universe in the movies as well. 

Or tl;dr: Disney's new canon says ""I have spoken"" regardless of medium.

I agree with you about wiping away the old Legends canon. There was a lot of that I enjoyed. I respect (in the broader sense, as their execution of it sucked) the need to wipe or overwrite the old canon in order to have the freedom to play in a sandbox set so close to the OT (as even the most *linear* C-Canon stories went well beyond the 30 year mark past ROTJ, not to mention the stuff that jumped a century or more). I don't agree with their decision to wipe away a lot of the ancient Old Republic, Prequel/Rise of the Empire era material though, as none of that would have interfered with their new stories. So I do agree that it was a hamfisted method to give them a clean slate. There are a lot of stories set before ROTJ that I'm going to miss, especially those set before TPM. 

Overall, I'm definitely disappointed. And as much as I like their new system of canon equality, I think it's going to eventually lead to more problems and errors in continuity than they expect. After a decade or two of officially licensed works, they'll find enough inconsistencies to rekindle the debates of yore once again."

Disney's new canon includes all previous movies, the running TV shows as of their takeover (so Clone Wars, Rebels and beyond), and any books, comics and video games published after their purchase. So we no longer have the situation where professional fans are *hoping* for canonization, what they create under the Disney Star Wars label ***is*** canon. 

The old Legends material is canon now only in the hearts and minds of fans who accept it. Which is still a significant group, but one whose material will not grow moving forward."
