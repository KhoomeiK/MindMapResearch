I only use it about once a month. It says peeling solution, but I've never actually had my skin peel from it and I have very dry skin. Just be careful if you're using any sort of retinol. I use prescription retinA (tretinoin) now and only leave it on for a few min if I absolutely feel like I need to use it. I've never experienced any actually burning while not on tret.

Also, can anyone tell me if there's a cheaper/similar dupe, or products with similar ingredients.

30PlusSkinCare,fdo8l29,t3_emduaa,1578600762.0,"I haven't had much flaking since starting tret. Make sure you're using tret on dry skin, or rather not wet? My skin is usually damp from product but not wet from water if that makes sense. My routine is:

Oil cleanse with marula oil

Foam cleanse with either holika holika aloe or klairs rich moist

Sometimes CeraVe hydrating cleanser

TO hyaluronic acid

Acwell licorice toner

CosRx snail mucin 96 essence

TO buffet

Tret (pm) 0.05%

Neogen anti wrinkle cream (more like a gel)

Either Kiehls ultra facial cream (am) or Clinique dramatically different lotion (pm)

At night, I'll add a layer of Vaseline or aquaphor

If I'm feeling extra dry, I'll use a little Eucerin roughness relief or intensive repair lotion before Vaseline. Both are pretty heavy though. 

I have very dry, dehydrated skin that is not sensitive. Basically I've been looking for/using products that restore the moisture barrier - urea, ceramides, etc. I'm still pretty new to skincare, but so far I've had minimal flaking. If I start flaking, I'll skip tret that night. 

Good luck!"
