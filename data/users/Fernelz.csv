The truth is that yuumi is an amazing support but she isn't a solo carry champ. In other words she requires her teammates to know how to carry in order to be the most useful. 

This is what makes her so strong in pro play. This also means she's not the best for solo que climbing but as long as your playing a champ you enjoy you'll do better so have at it I say. 

As far as ranked goes don't stress you're rank itself. Imo ranked isn't about climbing and being the best, it's about playing seriously and learning/improving by playing against opponents that are also taking it serious. If your only there to climb you won't have fun trust me, also limiting yourself to just a few games a day helps (well it did for me)"

That being said I can't say as to how good the tracking on quest is myself. I do know it's inside out tracking which isn't the best but it's cheaper than outside in so I understand the decision they made with that and respect them for getting it down well enough for beat saber.

I do admit that psvr tracking leaves something to be desired sometimes but imo that's mostly dependant on how the game developers decided to handle with PlayStations iffy decisions. And it is in this that beat saber far outshines other games. The devs that made the psvr port did really well. (Though there was that one update that every port messed up the tracking a bit)"
