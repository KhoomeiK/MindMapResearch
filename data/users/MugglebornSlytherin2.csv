depression,fdfuusk,t3_el62w3,1578370819.0,"Needing help doesn't make you weak or pathetic or a burden. I'm 28 years old and I need help, it's ok to not be ok and it's ok to get help. You are vaild and you are not alone in it. You need to reach out for help and take the hands offered to you. Life is tough and hard and it can seem like there's nothing good about it that there's no reason to it or to your existence. And maybe there isn't a grand reason or purpose to our existences, maybe we just exist because we do. That's ok, you are loved, you will be loved and you deserve to be loved. You are not alone at all in your feelings and it's ok to need help, even at your young age. I think a lot of people forget that kids have feelings and can be depressed it sucks, but if your school guidance counselor is listening then let them help you."

cats,fdflhmu,t3_el4rjw,1578364469.0,It might be sensitive paws. Try switching to a softer litter like sand or paper. Or if she's showing other signs like frequent bathroom trips or gnawing at het rear you should consider going to the vet. Keep an eye out for any concering symptoms and it wouldn't hurt to call the vet for a consult most won't charge you for a phone call.
aww,fdfl93o,t3_el4rug,1578364313.0,"Time and patience, also try to make sure there's somewhere that they both can get to without the other following. Be sure to give them equal amounts of attention. Other than that just let them get use to each other."

cats,fdfexe3,t3_el3uz8,1578360097.0,Make sure she's getting water and take her to the vet as soon as possible. If money is an issue there are many places that will help. Please take her to the vet as soon as you can many vets even have emergency hours.
