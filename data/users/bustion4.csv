You are sooooo smart."
Seaofthieves,fdl01vl,t1_fdkza4p,1578514649.0,"Well, maybe not everyone, but at least you are.

Generated loot behaves different to players loot.
For example, generated loot on islands dissapear as soon as everyone leave the island (if everyone dies or sail far away).

Another example, generated explosives inside forts can't explode until the fort door has been opened. This means that the system has some relation between the fort and the items generated. Witch means that the could make just it never despawn. It is extremly easy to do.

As I said, if the fort is active, the loot shouldn't dissapear. Or if you want to make it dissapear, fort should also stop so players would know that there is a timer. Keep the fort active while you remove the loot without a reason can't be a feature except if developers are just idiots.
