natureismetal,fenj7eh,t3_eq1qm6,1579285847.0,"So, here comes the tragic part. This is actually how they kill hippos. If a hippo is alone on land, they eventually get it. They chew on the spine just in front of the back legs on the back until they eventually get through it. This can take a while as the hippo has very thick skin. The lions work in teams taking turns chewing that spot until they finally get to the spine and sever the cord. This causes the hippo to stop as it can't move its hind legs anymore. Then they eat it from ass to mouth. (takes a while)

Here's a clip:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS1rU5SAskU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS1rU5SAskU)

About 1:40 in is when the spinal cord is finally severed and the hippo's rear legs collapse.

This usually happens when a watering hole dries up and the hippo is forced to move to another one, or when a male is pushed out of his watering hole by the head patriarch that doesn't want him around anymore. A lion would have to be crazy to take on a hippo in the water, but they are somewhat vulnerable out of it."
todayilearned,feni7l0,t1_fengp03,1579285237.0,"It's not like the Unabomber's ideas were never thought of before either. I think everyone realizes that modern society and humanity make a weird mix. Think about the sheer consumption of mind altering substances worldwide (alcohol, weed, cigarettes, opioids, hallucinogens, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety meds, etc...) It could probably be measured in tons per day. If our society was so wonderful, people using these substances would be outliers. 

I don't think the solution is to go back to the stone ages. Progress is here, we can't reverse it. I think the real solution is to change humanity... at a DNA level. We need to make better people that psychologically can function well in a large pro-social environment without the need for all these drugs. In 100 years, we will probably be editing every single zygote to have these characteristics."

todayilearned,fenhf23,t1_fenfc6c,1579284747.0,"The problem is that people don't think like a collective. So, you can't have a government that works like one. Sure, the university students with french poetry degrees all think we could live in a giant commune, but it doesn't work and it hasn't worked. We simply have too much personal ambition as a species. Someone will always find a way to have a little more than someone else. This is why every time they have a socialist or communist government, you end up with even worse class disparities than you do in capitalist societies when those economic systems were designed to stop this from happening. 

In other words, you can't fix greed. We can't inoculate people from it. We can't remove it. We can educate it down to a manageable amount, but we have to have an economic system that harnesses it in a productive way. That is capitalism. Someone in Sweden could create a new idea, make a new product, find a better, more efficient way to run a business (i.e. IKEA), and they and their family will personally benefit from this. 

This was the point of a democratic government where everyone gets one vote. That way, you don't have a tyranny of the minority, but the problem is that this got buried under disproportionate representation (i.e. a vote in Nevada is worth thousands of votes in California and infinite votes compared to a vote in Puerto Rico or Guam, yet they are all American citizens), and the incredible power of lobbyists."

therewasanattempt,fen737v,t1_fen3yyk,1579278409.0,"Agreed, but it's human nature to strive for an identity. We want a ""tribe"". It's why in America, most people identify was one of their ancestor's home countries most of the time. How often do you hear someone say ""Oh yeah I'm Native American, see I got a tattoo for it"" (When they are like 1/16th Cherokee and don't even know one word of the language) or ""I'm German"" (when they had a German grandparent and never once even visited the country). It goes beyond that, people identify with being goth, punk, biker, etc... as a way of being part of a people because it makes them feel like they belong. Race is just another way people do that. I agree, skin color is just how much melanin your body produces. We might as well sort people by how much saliva they create or bacterial percentages in their poop, but you can readily see skin color.  So, we use it. Lots of black people identify with ""being black"" as a sense of community for themselves, and this leads to certain social prescriptions. (i.e. pursuing and avoiding certain career paths, sports, behavioral characteristics). This was essentially what Chris Rock was talking about in his most famous comedic sketch. Anyone saying that one race is smarter or more capable or really different than the other is just an asshole and they are incorrect, but the ""identity"" of it is quite different."

The point was that there are a disproportionately fewer black firemen and programmers. There are also disproportionately fewer black hockey players. The software industry is about as meritocracy as an industry gets. Demand is voracious for new people, and the companies are almost progressive to a fault. I would venture to say that they would probably hire a black engineer partly because he's black and it makes the hiring manager look better, yet they are extremely rare. In the case of hockey, any coach is going to hire the best players he can find. They want to win. 

The point was that just because you see an industry with a certain demographic doesn't automatically make it racist or sexist. There are strong cultural influences that push people towards or away from career paths early in life."

I mean if you only met to hook up, yeah bring it up. But if you are actually trying to date someone, it's best to avoid talking about specifics. 

Imagine if a woman told you on the first date that she had a super shallow vagina (happened to me once, couldn't even get more than 3 inches in). It would be all you thought about and prevent emotional intimacy. 

If you are going to say anything about it, mention it when you have the STD testing talk which is right before things are about to get busy. For example, I have delayed ejaculation. So I'll bring that up so they don't think I'm not enjoying myself or something is wrong because it's taking like 25 min for me to finish.

Economics,fdxc4yh,t1_fdwwfe3,1578767310.0,"Your premise is that consumers are evenly distributed, and this is completely false. An 45 year old adult spends a LOT more money than a 20 year old adult because they simply have more money. You drink more expensive drinks, you eat at more expensive restaurants, etc... 

At certain ages in your life, you need certain resources more than you will at any other time. 

For example, at 8 years old, you need grade school. You'll need a lot less grade school at 28 (like none, hopefully, maybe some in your case). If there are TONS of 8 year olds, you are going to be packed into a more crowded class and have less time with the teachers. So, you have a disadvantage. 

At 16, you get a job at a fast food restaurant or mowing lawns. The kind of job that mostly 16 year olds go for. Most of your customers are much older than you. You aren't mowing the lawns of 16 year old home owners.

At 18 years old, you need to apply to college. The student capacity of each college doesn't change that much from year to year. Therefore, you will have an easier time getting into college in a small generation than in a large one. 

At 23, you are looking for that entry level job. Once again, there are usually only so many of those to go around, and it's easier to get one with less competition. Once again, the customers of that business are typically older people. 

I'm not the only one that studied this. Sociologists have studies this for year. Baby boomers had it rough, and millennials have it rough. Real rough. The challenges were different, but the overall issue was just competition. It's like trying to date a girl on a Navy vessel. I was Gen Y. Life was much easier. Colleges had lots of slots. Entry level positions were plentiful. Scholarships were less sought after, but my generation had no chance to make any changes in society which baby boomers and millennials did are are doing."
Economics,fdwtq9p,t1_fdwrh8u,1578762256.0,"John Oliver did a segment on this. Manufacturing does suffer, but jobs are created in many other categories. I mean, look at two data points. #1 we have never had as much automation as we do today. #2 we have never had as many people employed as we do today. (And the participation rate is close to as high as it gets)

If your hypothesis was correct that automation was destroying employment, these two data points wouldn't co-exist. Automation DOES destroy factory jobs, but we have created more jobs than we destroyed."
Economics,fdwn2rs,t1_fdwdjir,1578760346.0,"There are not fewer people in the workforce. Your information is wrong. Unemployment is extremely low. In fact, because of population size increases, there are more people working now than ever in history. 

You meant, there are fewer people working in manufacturing, and then you are correct. But we have new jobs that didn't exist 50 years ago. Nobody was an app developer back then. The growth of technology has made as many jobs as it has destroyed."
options,fdwdr28,t3_en265g,1578757642.0,"Options are essentially gambling. There's no real difference. If you believe in a company, buy its stock. Sure, the price might temporarily go down, but, if you are right, the company will eventually succeed. Options are trading on short term volatility of investor sentiment of a stock valuation. Also, they all lose theta value over time. Most people lose money doing it."
Economics,fdwbyqb,t1_fdw2fai,1578757161.0,"No, you wouldn't. Explain how you came up with that arbitrary association. A company will pay as little as it can get away with to fill a position. That's just how it works. When companies increase wages for a position, it's because they want to attract and retain more talent for it. 

Why do you think software engineers can get a six figure job after a couple of years of experience and a four year degree while architects have to go to grad school and are lucky to break six figures after 10 years. We just need a lot more software engineers. So companies pay more to get them."
Economics,fdwb34i,t1_fdw70kz,1578756942.0,"Just about every single economist agrees with me. If you are 18 years old, it's easier to get into college when fewer people are applying. When you are 23, it's easier to get an entry level job when there are fewer people applying for it. This means your life gets on track sooner and you have more mentorship. 

Just saying I'm wrong without any facts or logic to back it up is exactly what is wrong with the internet trolls."
investing,fdwa93z,t3_en40n7,1578756665.0,"So, if you are thinking of trading the stock because you know an acquisition is about to take place, just don't. If it does moon because of the transaction (which honestly, there's no way to know in advance), you are now guilty of insider trading."

Economics,fdw2i7x,t3_en72cy,1578754355.0,"This is a known issue. If you could choose to be born in a big pop generation (boomers, millennials) or a small pop generation (gen X, gen Y, greatest generation), you want the small one. More openings in jobs at your level, more openings in college, more resources in general to help you get going. Boomers had to struggle. It's probably why they are such greedy shitheads now. Millennials are struggling. Remember, boomers wanted to overthrow capitalism too because it was just too difficult when they were your age."
Economics,fdw1glk,t1_fdvza9i,1578754111.0,Wages are entirely based (like everything else) on supply and demand. Boomers are a HUGE block of the population. GenX and GenY are tiny in comparison.
