&#x200B;

its the same rule as spies, you cant disguise yourself as the enemy to then shoot them from the back

&#x200B;

from the wikipedia article

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\_Greif#cite\_ref-18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Greif#cite_ref-18)

&#x200B;

"" Skorzeny's postwar trial set a precedent clarifying article 4 of the [Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Convention): as the German soldiers removed the Allied uniforms before engaging in combat, they were not to be considered [*francs-tireurs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francs-tireurs).  "" (shooters/militants)

"" After World War II, Skorzeny was tried as a war criminal at the [Dachau Trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachau_Trials)  in 1947 for allegedly violating the laws of war during the Battle of  the Bulge. He and nine officers of the Panzerbrigade 150 were charged  with improperly using U.S. uniforms ""by entering into combat disguised  therewith and treacherously firing upon and killing members of the [armed forces of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_forces_of_the_United_States)."" ""

&#x200B;

essentially, its the same rule as spies

actually, I am having a bit of a hard time finding concise proof of this (it may sound vague at the moment, )

&#x200B;

dont take my word for it for a few more minutes, I must re-search my ww2 history to get you specifics, but e4ssentially, if I recall correctly,

no uniform= spies (rule de guerre, essentially subterfuge) (legal)

wearing enemy uniform= (ruse de guerre) (legal)

wearing enemy uniform TO COMMIT -PERFIDY ( [perfidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy)is a form of [deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception) in which one side promises to act in [good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) ) - : NOT ""ruse de guerre"" - illegal

Please find everything you think you -can- do to protect yourself about the things you are paranoid about, do what you think keeps you safe, and try to reach some level of peace with the world

We all live with an uncomfortably large number of things we cant control, and wether through malice, monetary incentives, or plain ignorance, people can make us think things are actually worse than they are

(Consider aswell, I am a person, I can be wrong about this, I could also be making a critical mistake in the ""try not to worry, carry a big stick, and smell the artificiall roses while you can"" mentality, but I spent a shit ton of my life worrying about things that, the minute the fears came to be proven true or not, I realized everything I was tought to fear and be cautious about was 100% utter and irrefutable bullshit... Imagine if you spent ALL of your childhood denied of buying anything EVER online because your parents feared the internet... Or giving any sort of cc card online)

You mention you are already paranoid about big tech

Well, what CAN you do about it? Find it, and then do it, if you truly worry, find the source of the worry and do everythinf you can to at least mitigate it, and if you cant, please remeber there are rhings in life (more often than not) we cannot control

how do you keep your chicken burgers juicy? do you have any reccomendations as to what to add to them to make them healthier?
