Forgotten_Realms,ffjjzf2,t3_etf8nb,1579999952.0,"OK. It seems my idea interested some people around here,a so here are some of the tribes. 

The Many-Arrows Tribe: That's known to all. Obould and everything. But the Obould I paint isn't the Chosen of Grummush he could have been. My Campaign advanced 26 years after 1372, and in 1373, Obould tried his invasion. After failing, he's now an elder orc who controls 1/5 of the Spine's orcs. He's a monarch more than a tribal chief. Every conquered tribe becomes a Many-Arrows. Thus, this gives birth to orc clans, as in Durkheim's view of tribal systems of power. In the Many-Arrows ""main"" tribe, the custom is that only proven warriors can take multiple wives and have as many children as possible. They are strictly patrilieal regarding children, and also impose this rule on conquered tribes. They used to kidnap Alustriel's subjects as slaves, but a peace treaty with him ensured the freedom of said slaves. Instead, they enslave hill giants, goblins, trolls and other stuff. They ARE capable of making iron and bronze, but doesn't know how to smelt steel. After the treaty with the Silver Marches, they trade ore, pelts and rare minerals for human-made (the dwarves and elves refused to sell them anything) steel, wine, beer, silk, linen and other items that they can't grow in the mountains. The Many-Arrows are constantly at war with all the other creatures in the area, but they are leaving the Uthgardt alone, at least the Uthgardt who have agreements with Alustriel. Even King Emerus War-Crown sees the reason behind keeping Obould as an ally. Recently, the tribe began to accept arcane conjurers born among them. Some even make it to Silverymoon to study as sorcerers. Few return and those who return beat the shit out of warriors and make themselves cozy with wives and positions of power. Still, they lack the magical finesse of elves or humans. Slowly, some are embracing Mystra as a patron deity, and some warriors even make a bizarre cult of what they call ""The Many Blades"", a syncretism of Grummush and Garagos. Some others are still conservative and cling to the weakened clergy of Grummush for guidance.

The Uzgabûl: Those are fanatic Grummush worshippers. They broke off with the Many-Arrows seeing them as weak in abandoning the orcish way of life. They can make medium-quality bronze and bad quality iron. Their numbers are among 2k to 3k orcs. Their Elders, who are warriors or druids of Grummush are the only ones who can have females and thus, children. The Uzgabûl are taller than the average orc and live for war. They go down the mountains and are a constant pest for the Argent Legion for their incursions on the immediate southern regions of the Spine. Normally the hardened Helm paladins and knights who face them do not take prisoners. Their last big incursion was a failed attempt of 600 orcs of pillaging Quarevarr during the autumn, when the grains arrived, but they tried a pincer movement. A group went through northern Moonwood and got ravaged by the Black Blood metamorphs and the other was crushed by the joint effort of a small force of dwarven heavy infantry aided by human and gnomish arquebusiers alongside a cavalry charge of the Knights of Helm, human light huszárs and elven mounted archers. 400 survived and came back to the mountains. They refuse to use cloth, only wearing pelts, pillaged armour, or nothing at all, entering a frenzied state by consuming rage-inducing narcotics.

The Uurushnna: The name means ""Shadow"" in orcish, but the other tribes call them ""Gimbrig"" (dwarves) or ""Shahri"" (females for reproduction). The Uurushenna can't make good iron or bronze, and they are smaller than other orcs, thus the name. They grow to 1,80m or 1,90m, small by orcish patterns. Those are matrilineal and females chose their partners, still warriors of repute. Their way of warfare is more subtle. As they can't go hand to hand easily with bigger orcs, they have a close relation with Yurtrus and Shargaas. They are very skilled at making small useful bows and crossbows with poisoned tips. Those orcs prefer to sneak attack and ambush caravans to take weapons and armour and their strong poisons help them. They are very cunning and employ traps. They hate goblins, which they skin alive and use their skins as trophies. They use certain contents of goblin feces alongside crushed minerals and insects to make their poisons. Every blade of theirs can kill you in a painful way. Only their druids know how to make their poisons and enhancing mixtures which can kill a hill giant in an hour if aimed at the right body parts. So far, researchers from Silverymoon were unable to discover the components of their concoctions as it seems those were a gift from Yurtrus to the tribe himself. The Uurushunna DO capture human females to use as sex slaves, thus the tribe have a high number of half-orcs among their ranks. Other tribes tried time and time again to erradicate them but were always met with massive casualties. The ""filthy goblins"", as called by other orcs, can make horrible traps that ensure that enemies will be hindered while met with long range attacks by the ""goblins"". They tend to camouflage themselves with dirt, mud or foliage when in forests. Also, their caves also have gold veins. They trade gold ore with Zhents, Luskani or other smugglers for Dirt Dust, a weaker version of the gnomish Smoke Powder, developed by alchemists trying to discover the secret of the Lantani gunpowder. While they can't make small firearms, the Uurushnna make wooden or stone dangerously primitive cannons which they load with skin or pelt sacks filled with pieces of lead or boulders. 

Well, those are some of the tribes I fleshed out. Also, those are brief descriptions of them, as I have more of it on my notes. If they picked your interest, please, do tell me, and if you want more, I'm eager to share."
Forgotten_Realms,ffhq455,t1_ffho8yy,1579947922.0,"Indeed. It's something I find amusing even on the ""civilized"" and let me call them from now on CR, Complex Races as in Complex Societies, as anthropology refers to nowadays. 

Humans are the only fleshed out ones in the Realms, as Luiren is the Shire. They don't talk much about elven customs, for example. We know about their history as if in a chronicle, the crown wars, Cormanthor, Evereska, but not tradition. 

Dwarves are another CR that are irritatingly bad described. Duergar are better explained than Shield Dwarves. I tend to see Dwarves as a collectivist society as in more than one family live in the same house or chambers, if we are talking about their fortresses, and their children know their parents and come back to them at the end of the day, but are raised with the other children, devoid of a notion of social class. That means that the son of the best glass artisan of the fortress was raised alongside the son of a simple ore miner. Dwarves loosen up alongside other dwarves as they are related in some manner. They ALL train in military maneuvers, which means that all dwarves can defend the collective. But there are social classes and a rigid social structure, even if the king fights side by side with a simple iron smelter."

AskReddit,fffwlkd,t3_et8871,1579893392.0,"Strigoi or other undead in general. We do have legends regarding them from China to Europe and then to the americas. Undead are always something interesting to think through an anthropological perspective. First, because they are something else. If my long dead great-grandfather rose from the grave, I'd be afraid as fuck even though I didn't fear him when he lived. Second because they keep being present somehow. We leave them offerings for their afterlife well-being or because we fear their wrath in case they are forgotten. Third, for a very curious and funny personal reason. I once had a girlfriend whose parents vehemently believed I'd turn into a strigoi after death unless I made some specific ritual, first because mine is an old family of voivodes and most of them were particularly cruel and second because I was born with my unbiblical chord around my neck in a number of turns. This supposedly are signs that I will become a vampire after death. Always found that anecdote funny and entertaining."

They didn't invade Poland and murdered its officers? They didn't send political dissidents to gulags? The war started because both sides were made out of cunts. Humanity is formed entirely by cunts.

WhiteWolfRPG,fern93c,t3_eqgelt,1579356041.0,"So, I'm a conservative fuck that won't even touch V5 like it's the pox. BUT there are some things I can help you with. 

1. Fuck the shield 90% of the time. It isolates you, and that's felt by the players. So, you could organize the notes on paperclips on the shield, and rise it when you need them. But that's not practical, because some player will always have to go around you to go to the bathroom, bring more beer from the fridge and so on, and could accidentally see your notes. 

2. A notebook is a good idea. One with canson paper or at least without margins, so that you can divide it like you wish. I normally reserve a page for details, like events that happened, psychological torture I'm imposing on a player, as that's horror after all, factions and so on. The other page is reserved for NPCs, like ""John Doe, Caitiff, 14th, Independent, guy who accidentally stumbled upon some info about the plans of some politician (reference it to page 1), connected the dots and know it was the Brujah primigen using his pawns to take the Sabbat's turf in the X neighbourhood"". Don't care to divide those NPCs into their factions, as you'll invent more anyway, so it'll become a mess. Just remember how to navigate your mess. You keep the notebook around, even doodle on it if you wish. After all, you don't do most of the talking. 

3. Write your notes using a comfortable pen. I use those Mistubishi gel pens. Feels like the pen is sliding through the paper. Very very pleasurable. 

4. Take real life tours around the city. Feel its aura. Feel its essence. See its tramps dancing the dance of life begging money while salaryman in pressed suits ignore them. Enter the churches. Visit the more unsavory areas of the city. Imagine how each area would be under whose control. How each faction would administrate its turf. Go to the hospital. Sit on street corners, smoke and listen to conversations. Put all that interests you in your notebook. 

5. Don't let your players see your notes, and never talk about subjects they don't yet know. Like how the X Primigen ended up being embraced. Leave it to dialogues with NPCs. 

6. Don't get too drunk. But be ready to try to act as everyone, from the cold hearted killer to the women begging not to die. If you feel your acting will sound ridiculous on some part, it's okay. Describe with all details what's happening. Force your players to interact with the scenario. 

7. Have A4 paper sheets ready if you need to drawn a house blueprint, or something.

worldbuilding,fdj0f4c,t3_ele2ip,1578455278.0,"I have the Un un-Da, the Un he-Ek and the Un he-Gure, for example. Un meaning ""clay"", which is the same word for ""men"" in my universe.

The Un un-Da are the ""Men clay-Words"". The high nobility. They are lettered men and serve the Unuruhe-karat, the Not-Clay-but-spear-clay from the Sky, the god-emperor of the City-State with literate affairs. They can't touch weapons and are prohibited of having contact with the Shurup, the ""Impures"", that is, peasants and the Flying Monks, which are a militarist religion. They basically live their entire lives inside the Citadel of the city, amongst themselves and the Royal Family and the branches of the royal family, all of which take up arms since childhood, excluding the females. 
The Un he-Ek, the Men of the Spears are a highly militarized high-nobility. Theirs primary weapons are bows, spears and bronze swords (this universe is in the late bronze age), and they fight mounted. They can interact with the lower castes, but still, as ""Clay"", they can't interact with the monks, unless it's the case of war or armed conflict. 
The last class are the lower nobility. ""Men of the water"". They control the peasants acess to the riverbed, thus deciding who is and who isn't going to grow crops. They also act as merchants, slave traders, etc. They can't interact with the clergy, but naturally can interact with peasants. 
The Flying Monks, or Fek-herat, ""Sacredness of the Sky"", are chosen by their own prophets among every class, including the royal one. If a prophet sees a royal baby or a peasant one in his meditative dreams, they will take the child away from the mother and raise them among the clergy. No child ever knows their origin and their names matter no more. They are trained in short and long spears, staffs, daggers, swords, bows, use of war elephants (but never horses, as those are seen as sons of the earth, not the sky), wooden, bronze-covered or wicker shields, and all sort of weapon, including the sword whip, their most terrifying weapon. They also tend the dead, and are the only ones allowed to touch them and prepare them through the Six Elements in order to go back into the cycle. Peasants are rarely seen as having souls, so their burials aren't as elaborate, even though there are exceptions if a prophet decides so. Most monks live in a vote of silence. They can talk to any social class, but not touch them unless necessary. 
The Utaf-jir, or ""life soldiers"", are the elite of the secular army. They are a force of slave soldiers born into this professions through generations. They make the heavy infantry of the royal army. They CAN speak to the monks, but aren't allowed to speak to the nobles unless the nobles talk to them.
Those are just some of the social classes in this little world of mine and taboos that govern each one of them. Hope It's useful."

AskReddit,fdh085f,t3_el9xhw,1578412528.0,"Three stories, all happened while fishing in Brazil.

1. I was sailing in Guanabara Bay, in the Jururuba region to fish, many years ago. I've been sailing since I was six, so this must have happened when. I was nine or ten. I was preparing the pole, using small shrimp as bait, all alone. Suddenly, something bumps my boat. I look at it. It's a corpse, floating upwards. Don't think the guy was murdered. Looked like he was drunk, decided to go for a swim and drowned. Anyway, I sailed away from there and had nightmares for some weeks.
2. I was sailing in Guanabara Bay, but far away from the first point, on the other side of the bay. Literally found a DEAD COW floating. No idea where it came from. 
3. Again in Brazil, but in the Pantanal region, which means ""Great Swamp"", literally. Alligators, big fucking constrictors that can eat small children and use the rivers to swim around, mosquitoes the size of a marble ball, all that stuff. I was there with a brazilian friend, this crazy dutch old man and two locals. The dutch and the locals were drinking like animals and we were on these two old beaten up boats moved with gasoline, I think. That was like, six years ago. Well, I was in a boat with the dutch and one local and my friend was with the other local on the other boat. They were driking so much of the local booze that I was kind of getting worried that something would happen, you know that ""oh shit, oh shit, oh shit"" sensation. Well, the local in my boat was a bit less crazy than the other and it was so hot that I have no idea how were they able to drink that much in so little time. I speak portuguese very well, as I spent much of my childhood in Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina states before returning to Hungary. The dutch, on the other hand, spoke a weird mix of spanish, english, portuguese and hand gestures that somehow made it posible for him to communicate with those two guys. Or drunks somehow are telepaths, I don't know. 
It was 1300 hours and the sun was scorching as fuck. Well, what happened next is that the dutch and the local on the other boat had the marvellous idea of going into the water to prove they were real men, or something like this. Well, me and the not-so-drunk local grabbed the dutch dude while my friend grabbed his own drunk by the shirt. A fight ensues and as I was in the army, I was able to put the dutch on a chokehold while I lost my pole. The guy grabbed a fishing knife, but the local grabbed his hand first. My friend wasn't so lucky. His boat nearly capsized and his local threw himself into the water, and had a wound. Turns out he was eaten by piranhas. Alive. Just in front of us. While I was bouncing my head on the boat as the drunken dutch fought. In the end, I was able to put him unconscious, lose a pole, hear a dude be eaten alive and not catch anything on that day. Never fished again after this."
