EngineeringStudents,fd39ztr,t3_ejxnfh,1578156203.0,"Nothing bad can come from going to the interview, I would suggest going to the interview atleast. Then you can try to also figure out what exactly you would be doing if they would give you an offer there. You can then later decide if you get the offer from SpaceX what you want to do.

I hade this situation when I was about to start to work, I already had accepted a position at a fairly good company and was invited to an interview with my dream employer. I ended up getting the position at my dream employer and quit the other position before I started and haven't regretted it a second.

But listen to what other people say, don't go just for the name but also for what you want to do. However it might be easier to get hired if you had an internship at the place and they where happy with you.

I suggest that you go to the interview, nothing bad can come out of that. If they offer you the internship, decide then what you want to do. If they don't you atleast got more interview experience."

IKEA,f74etlf,t3_dub9d8,1573401434.0,"Ah the good old norwegian invention the cheese slicer. Best way of slicing a block of cheese. On a more serious note, you find them on Amazon by searching for ""cheese slicer"". I really like this one: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gastromax-Cheese-Slicer-Black-Colour/dp/B00DZH6XS8/ref=mp_s_a_1_20?keywords=Cheese+slicer&qid=1573401319&sr=8-20 since it works very well on soft and harder cheeses, even though it's not the most astetic looking one."
