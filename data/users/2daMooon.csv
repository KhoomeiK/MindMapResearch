It’s impossible to ensure that there will always be more younger kids than the old people they are paying for. Even if you could it’s not solving a problem; it is passing it on to the future and making it bigger.

Stop at T = 5 and turn around to see the light from your travels coming towards you and drive back to it, you would then be at T > 5.

I think you’ve got things backwards. Using anything human and not constant, like comfort range, to define the measurement scale is what the imperial system would come up with,  is metric.  

In fact, it is how the 5280 feet per mile BS started. 5 human feet to a pace, a thousand paces to the mile. 

Removeing subjectivity and picking something that was as close to a constant as they’ve got at the time is where metric came from. 

So sure, the comfort range for humans doesn’t use clean numbers. But neither does the comfortable weight of a human (Kg), the range a human can walk in a day (Km) or the amount a human should drink in a day (L) end up with clean numbers so I don’t see why you are expecting it to and calling it “imperial” when it doesn’t."

I know it is tough, but forget the actual numbers being used in C because you are use to F and of course they will feel weird. Just how anyone used to C will find F numbers weird. Take a step back and think like an outsider.

Now that you've forgotten the numbers, think from a ""what am I going to wear today perspective?"" which differs drastically depending if it is raining or if it is snowing. Negative C means you have to plan for snow/ice, Positive C means you have to plan for rain. That is handy. 

After that 10C chunks generally mean you should change your attire:

> -50 C - Human Popsicle

> -40 C - Don't go outside 

> -30 C - Don't go outside with any skin visible

> -20 C - Multilayered clothing in each part of body

> -10 C - Some multilayering but single layers can work

> 0 C - Warm jackets, but ditch your layers

> 10 C - Ditch those jackets

> 20 C - Ditch those sweaters

> 30 C - Ditch those pants.

> 40 C - Ditch everything.

> 50 C - Dead in a ditch

NoStupidQuestions,fdzfqo2,t1_fdwhl94,1578789786.0,"Simple way to think is they are blank slates while adults  are filled slates with tons of baggage from life on them. Where you think based on your many experiences (“I’ve tried brocolli 100 times and each time it is bad, so I hate brocolli”), they have literally no experience with brocolli and won’t even know if it as food. 

Now, if the first time you introduce broccoli to them, and all the times they’ve seen you eat it before, you make a disgusting face or say you hate it or don’t like it, or won’t eat it, etc. That is the only experience they have with it and so naturally they won’t try it or hate it (even if it tastes good when they tried it). 

Whereas if you suck it up and hide your hatred for brocolli until they’ve actually tried it and made up their own mind about it, then you get much more success with them liking it. 

Basically if they don’t know something is bad/wrong, let them decide on their own (or even influence them to the “decision” you want) instead of telling them before they’ve even had a chance to experience it.

As for the red dot, it should be a really bright, concise dot in the middle of a large circle of nothing. It doesn't matter that it is bright, you aren't looking for faint things with it. You are looking for bright stars or objects nearby where your target is located.

As I said, you don't use the red dot to find the actual target you are looking for, you use it to get into the right area and then you look through the scope to fine tune based on what you see when you do.

So for your original target, M42 The Orion Nebula, you would first have to align your red dot in the daylight to something far away, so that when you look through the red dot, the dot is directly on your target (lets say the top of far streetlight) and when you look through the telescope the top of the same streetlight is exactly centered. 

Then, wait until it gets dark and for Orion to be up, find his belt with your eyes only, then find his ""sword"" (line of seemingly glowing stars between his belt and his feet) with your eyes only. The middle stars of that sword are your target. 

Now take your scope, put your 20mm eyepiece in the scope but look through the red dot and place the red dot on the middle star of his ""sword"". 

When you look through the scope next, you should immediately see something faint [like this](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4ypygTBVxA/XDpVpZZQjuI/AAAAAAAAUQo/k9TvjiliPpQ1IdG313P1rvpujfZonba2wCLcBGAs/s1600/m42-sketch.jpg).

If you don't, try moving the scope around in a circle from the central point of where you were pointing. If still nothing, make sure your red dot is pointed at the right spot still. If still nothing, make sure your scope works. If still nothing after that I would probably google a picture of it and list the scope on craigslist because this might not be for you. ;)"

They are MASSIVE in the sky and even is poor ambient light conditions you can see M42 with just your eyes. However you are NOT an experienced telescope user and so you should listen to the steps people are telling you since you can't skip the practice that turns you from a noob to someone experienced. My best flow for finding a new object is Eyes -> Binoculars -> Finderscope/Red Dot -> Telescope with wide angle (20mm) eyepeice and always be checking your app in between.

- If your holoscope hasn't been zero'd since you ""took it apart"" then it isn't zero'd and is useless. Zero it during the day with the furthest object you can see. If it moves when mounted, it is useless. Fix that.

- The brightness of the red dot shouldn't matter, as you don't find the object with it. You find a couple nearby stars so you know you are ""in the neighborhood"" and then you go into the scope with the 20mm to get the rest of the way there.

- You overpaid for what you got, free shipping or not, but that is the least of your worries now.

If you want to learn how to use a telescope, listen to the people and change what you are doing. If not, keep doing what you are doing now."

In this case they’ve done the math and decided that giving the clothes away to the needy means that the needy will be wearing their clothes which will devalue their brand and impact their ability to sell to their target market enough to make it not worth it.
telescopes,fdng401,t3_ema8qd,1578585073.0,"Though it sounds like there are a lot bigger issues you need to work through, many other have already touched on those. I will add one thing that really helped me back when I was starting out: when looking through the scope and wanting to move in a specific direction don’t think about it as moving the scope towards what you want to see, think about it as your hands pushing/pulling the image through the eyepiece. 

This way, if the direction you want to go is UP, instead of moving the scope UP, and having the image go DOWN, you ""grab"" a star in the viewfinder and “pull it down” thereby making the view in the scope go UP. 

It sounds confusing but thinking this way gets your brain on the same page as your hands and it becomes very easy to manage."
