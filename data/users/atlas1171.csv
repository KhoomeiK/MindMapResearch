Conservative,ffd128o,t1_ffcc4uo,1579811318.0,There's an argument to be made that the interstate pact for the national popular vote is unconstitutional.  That argument happens to have one thing really going for it: it's correct.

That said, if you won't be able to find happiness in this (or any) committed relationship unless/until you have explored more casual dating and playtime, then you ought to consider telling your boyfriend that you need time and space to explore yourself."

If you removed the ""naruto"" elements from those games, it would still be a great fighting game.  But with this game, if you remove the DBZ, you're left with a lackluster RPG"

Games,ff3kjr3,t1_ff3aefd,1579543009.0,"I'd add that it's a great DBZ game, but a mediocre/just ok RPG.  People who aren't fans of the manga/anime probably won't find this game all that enjoyable.

Combat is visually stimulating and enjoyable, but the ""free-roam"" parts lack variety.  My biggest complaint is the sheer volume of cutscenes and skippable moments, just because they break up the gameplay A LOT.  That said, it's a blast watching one of my favorite anime's while ALSO playing it."

Conservative,felagnz,t3_epmcmm,1579217613.0,"The reality is: the president cannot order the withholding of funds for policy reasons where those funds have been appropriated by Congress.  Whether or not this rises to an impeachable offense is, obviously, a question for our elected representatives in Congress to decide.

EDIT: history would suggest that it takes something exceptionally serious to warrant removal of POTUS. [See here](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Impeachment/)"

NeutralPolitics,fdsnw38,t1_fdsf61v,1578705666.0,"It'd be clearer if I used the term ""direct"" or ""pure"" democracy.  I acknowledge that the definition of ""democracy"" has broadened to include ""representative government,"" even though that's not truly the meaning of the term.  The point I was making is that the US is a federal republic; so yes, there's sub-national governments holding power that cannot be clawed back by the federal government (federalism), but the Constitution also requires a government in which a scheme of representation takes place (republic).  

From Federalist 10: ""A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for (the dangers of factions) which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.""

NeutralPolitics,fdrno13,t3_emszmj,1578687092.0,"This is a difficult question to answer.  The Constitution creates a framework of governance, [federal republicanism](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic). It sets out the powers reserved to the federal government (legislative (Art I), executive (Art II), and judiciary (Art III), the relationship between the states and the feds in relation to the states[](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic) (Art IV).  See [here](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript).  It cannot be stated enough times that the US is not a democracy, it is a federal republic.  The Constitution explicitly requires that the federal government guarantee to each state in the union a ""republican form of government.""  See [here](https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/4/essays/128/guarantee-clause).  That clause is oft-forgotten and not really enforced, but as a starting point it is worth considering.

The difficulty in answering your questions comes in interpreting the provisions of the Constitution in the context of specific/concrete examples of ecnomic and social ""interventions"" (as you call them).  Nothing in the Constitution says ""thou shalt not have a social democracy like in Scandinavia"" etc. etc.  However, certain ""social democratic"" policies may well conflict with certain Constitutional provisions (e.g. the full ""democratization"" of the economy, a proposal Bernie Sanders has floated, would likely run afoul of several provisions). See, e.g., [here](https://ij.org/ll/june-2000-volume-9-number-3/how-the-constitution-protects-economic-liberty-part-three/).

I myself do not support many of the ""social democrat"" policy proposals.  However, the Constitution provides a mechanism such that a generally popular policy or idea has the potential of becoming an amendment through Art V.  See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States#Article_Five).  Briefly, I think a good amount of Sanders' ideas could be implemented in one form or another, but realizing his goal of ""democratic socialism"" for the US likely requires amending the Constitution to give the federal government more explicit intervention-type powers."

todayilearned,fdem3cz,t1_fdekxv0,1578341910.0,So the fact that Hoover visited Nazi Germany and lambasted their persecution of Jews and came to the conclusion that Hitler was insane doesn't lead you to believe that he wouldn't have readily allied the US with the Nazis?  That's setting aside the fact that Hoover was very unpopular and had 0% chance of winning a presidential election after 1932.

James had no interest in a reboot absent the original cast, and this new one is no different. They can't claim to have brought back the original cast when one of the most important OG cast members is deceased."
NeutralPolitics,fbyt64x,t1_faelom7,1577225656.0,"Article 1.  Can you explain what ""abuse of office"" means, and how is it an abuse of power to condition a WH visit on announcing and/or opening corruption investigations into foreign matters?  Is it merely because those investigations might impact or involve a potential rival political candidate and his family?  Assuming, for the sake of argument, that there was corruption re the Bidens, Burisma, etc. etc., would that have any impact on this article one way or the other?

Article 2.  The White House has asserted executive privilege as the grounds for not complying with the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry.  See [here](https://www.brookings.edu/research/all-the-presidents-privileges/), first paragraph (the article continues to make its own argument on this issue. 

The claim of privilege in this context is being litigated and has not been conclusively determined:  

> using the delays built into judicial processes to forestall a controlling decision until information sought is no longer politically useful or subpoenas have lapsed with the seating of a new Congress. Thus, D.C District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s late November ruling—that Donald McGahn must testify despite the claim that he is immune from Congressional subpoena—although not stayed beyond seven days by Judge Jackson, has been temporarily stayed by the D.C. Circuit Court until January 3, when it will hear a motion not on the merits but with respect to a further stay pending appeal. Unless a further stay is denied, which seems unlikely, or the appeal process is rapidly expedited, it will be some months before a circuit court decision is handed down. If that decision goes against McGahn, a further appeal to the Supreme Court, with an accompanying stay, is almost certain, and a decision by the High Court before the end of its current term is not guaranteed. Thus, without ever breaking the law or resisting a final court ruling, McGahn is likely to be able to keep what he knows to himself until long after what he could disclose could have figured in impeachment proceedings and perhaps even past the 2020 election.

As such, how can this article be factually or legally supported at this stage?"
