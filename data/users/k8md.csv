WitchesVsPatriarchy,fel2y63,t3_epj709,1579212920.0,I made monster soup to keep monsters from getting me while I slept and put out frisbees full of water for wolves

Temple,fct7j1y,t3_eip9bp,1577934938.0,Owl Breakfast and Lunch has some good things. I second the Yummy Pho suggestion as well.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fcfvpc7,t3_egzx8f,1577634194.0,"Got Chinese take out and they gave me a fork instead of chopsticks. It was fried rice though so that’s probably for the better, I’m not great at eating rice with chopsticks."
LeopardsAteMyFace,fc4vtxq,t1_fc2h0mt,1577430493.0,"The video is from Snapchat, which has ads between clips. You saw the person recording skipping the ads, not subliminal advertising.

But I agree with you, that girl is a moron. Jury is still out on the guy for me."
wholesomememes,fc3k646,t1_fc33elg,1577391586.0,"The comic originated on Deviant Art by a user named sortimid. You can find it by googling “debimbofication” if you want. I’ll copy and paste what they said:

> Anonymous commission.

> Haven't drawn the opposite process before...!

> DISCLAIMER: Many people are understandably upset about this image. It was never my intention to make a sexist proclamation but it seems that, inadvertently, I have done just that.

> I firmly believe women should be free to look and act any way they want. I've maintained this position in the image's comments from the moment it was posted. This image is not a statement, it's meant to satisfy a client's kink. I honestly did not expect an audience outside the transformation porn community. If I have offended you, I apologize.

Edit to add: its unfortunate that this art has been used by incels/mgtow to degrade women. I feel bad for the artist that their work has been construed in this way."

wholesomememes,fc2ysc4,t1_fc29e98,1577377550.0,"The [original comic](https://www.deviantart.com/sortimid/art/CMSN-De-bimbofication-662468751) was never intended to shit on women of any kind, the author says so. It’s fetish porn. (It also has nothing to do w race)"
SkincareAddiction,fc2aysp,t3_efqlyb,1577349467.0,"Leave it alone! Wash yourself normally, moisturize if you want, but what works for me with scabs after popping ingrown hairs is leaving it alone and letting it heal! You obsessing over it is making it worse. It’s normal to have blemishes like this, just let them heal."
