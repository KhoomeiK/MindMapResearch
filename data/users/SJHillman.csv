My guess is that it's one or all of several things.

First, the ones who do this often get too pissed at the vendor (even though it's not the vendor's fault) or the vendor gets pissed at them quickly and one fires the other, leading to the client doing a lot of vendor hopping. It's only the ones who do it infrequently that stick around, leading to confirmation bias.

Second, because they likewise hear infrequently from you, they feel you're not doing ""your job"" even if you don't have any sort of proactive maintenance contract. So when something breaks, it must be because you screwed up.

Third, it's a bit of ""if you meet an asshole in the morning"" syndrome. They're assholes to everyone, so everyone is an asshole right back to them. This leads them to believe that everyone else is just an asshole, so they only call when they absolutely need to."

This relied on a particular alignment of the planets in which to get that gravitational slingshot boost. Such an alignment of the planets only occurs once every 175 years. In a lot of ways, it was a happy coincidence that occurred right around the time we had both the technology and the public interest to take advantage of it."

NoStupidQuestions,ff5vjr8,t1_ff560me,1579611712.0,"There's a pretty good range of both mole and blue whale weights. If we apply some averages and rounding, a blue whale weighs roughly 2 million times as much as a mole. So if a mole of moles is about half the mass of our Moon (per xkcd), 2 million times that would be a million lunar masses.

To put it in perspective, one lunar mass is a little over 1% of the Earth's mass. So 1 million lunar masses would be as massive as 10,000 Earth's, or a bit over 30 Jupiters. That places it well within the range of brown dwarf sizes (13-75 Jupiter masses), or about 2/5ths the size of the smallest star.

Of course, mass is the easy one to figure out. Volume would be much harder to get. In general, objects don't get a whole lot bigger than Jupiter unless there's some force pushing out from the inside like a star's fusion because gravity keeps them compacted, so it will probably be roughly the size of a fairly large gas giant, only far more dense."
NoStupidQuestions,ff5udg9,t3_erp7tk,1579610568.0,"One other consideration is what the pool is made of. Many personal in-ground pools (the kind most houses have) and some above-ground pools have a vinyl liner than a dog's claws could damage when climbing out. This generally wouldn't apply to pools with concrete or tile sides. But dog hair can also clog a pool filter pretty good.

Certain chemicals also taste good to dogs, which might entice them to drink til they get sick. My parents use Baquacil instead of chlorine, which our dogs would lick off the concrete because they loved the taste."
