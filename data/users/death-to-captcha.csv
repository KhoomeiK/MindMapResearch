knitting,ff860u7,t3_erpyts,1579666969.0,"If the first swatch comes out alright, I wouldn't bother with a second, myself. Getting all fussed about having it match the first is probably what's throwing off your tension.

Also, look at your other projects. Unless you're the Flash, I highly doubt you knit fast enough to complete an entire project in one day, barring small and simple things like baby hats. You'll probably see that your tension is fairly consistent despite the multiple days of work.

So, knit that first swatch in your desired yarn (make sure it's big enough), and treat it like you intend to treat the FO when you wash and block it. Hang blocked swatch with some weight attached to see how much it will stretch in a sweater (easiest way is to put the rest of the yarn in a bag and pin that bag to the bottom of the swatch in a few places). Let hang for like a day to mimic the effect of wearing a sweater all day. Measure your gauge. 

Is the gauge correct? Awesome, go knit that sweater. Too loose and you hate the fabric now? Go down in needle size, try again. Too tight and you hate the fabric? Go up in size, try again. Too loose or too tight but you like the fabric? Determine how much math you're willing to do to have an FO that fits.

And, yeah, for the most part your gauge is gonna vary a little from day to day, but it mostly isn't going to change so much that washing won't even it out. (Things like extreme stress may cause you to knit significantly tighter, or drinking can make you knit much looser, so I wouldn't work on something large and gauge critical like a sweater in those circumstances. Otherwise, though, your tension is what it is, assuming you have a consistent knitting style.)"
knitting,ff8525a,t3_ertso7,1579666199.0,"Try different knitting positions. Like, put something between your lap and the project like a pillow to help support the project closer to the needles. Also consider resting your arms on something to add further support and reduce the range of motion a bit.

Pick a good spot to sit and knit. Ideally your chair should provide adequate support for your core and back, and location should have good lighting so you aren't hunching over your project or holding it up closer to your face.

You mentioned hyperfocus being an issue. If something like a timer going off is sufficient to pull you out of that state, set a timer for 10-15 minutes before you start knitting, and then put it somewhere where you can hear it, but have to put the knitting down and get up to turn it off. Or, if you live with someone, ask them to stop you after that amount of time. Take a break for at least as long as you have been knitting to stand up and do something that requires different motions. Eventually you can build back up to longer periods of knitting, but I still recommend at least 15 minutes break per hour of knitting, based on personal experience. (Many ADHD people I know also find visual motivation helpful to do certain tasks, like sticker charts. So maybe try making a sticker chart of every time you remember to take a break during knitting. Can be as simple as small notebook you get up to put a sticker in when you take the break, and eventually you kinda train your brain to include stopping to add the sticker into your routine.)"

knitting,fem4q1w,t1_feg641u,1579239691.0,"...Swatching would actually probably help you figure out the pattern better. More on that in a bit.

**Some general fit notes:** It looks to me like you aren't knitting the foot long enough before you start the toe decreases. 

For the average foot, you should start the toe decreases once the sock covers your pinky toe. (If doing toe up, you should stop the toe increases once the cap of the toe covers the first four toes.)

If you want to keep going with the flap heel, I think your flap is fine, but it's hard to tell because of how its being pulled down. (If you have a high instep, you actually want a longer flap, but I don't think that's your issue here.)

I saw your comment about how you haven't seen a sock pattern with increases in the foot. There's a reason for that. The reason is: You don't have to decrease back down to your original stitch count after the heel turn. If it's too tight around the instep for you, you may want to decrease fewer stitches in the gusset. Sock patterns assume you have an average foot, where decreasing back to your original stitch count is what needs to be done to fit. Some people have wider feet than their ankles, though, and so need to keep some of the stitches picked up from the flap for a better fit.

**More technical info on sock fit** (warning: lots of maths and parentheses ahead)

A sock should have ~10-15% negative ease. So you should really just measure your foot.

*For a top down heel flap sock:* You'll need length of foot, length of toes from tip of pinky to tip of big toe, circumference around the ball of your foot, and circumference around leg where you want the cuff to be.

Take those numbers, and the gauge you get knitting in the round.

For the circumferences, multiply your measurements by your stitches per inch/centimeter. Then multiply that by 0.9 for 10% negative ease, and round down to get an even number stitch count that works for whatever stitch pattern you use. (Eg. My foot measures 8"" around at the ball. If I knit a sock at 9st/in, I get 72 stitches for a sock exactly the size of my foot. If I want 10% negative ease, I should use 65 stitches - though I actually do 64 because it's a multiple of 4 for the 2x2 ribbing I do part of my cuff in, and fits perfectly fine. I specify even number because, well, heel flaps are worked over half your stitch count, and if you're grafting the toe you need an equal number of stitches on both halves of the sock.)

Cast on however many you need for your leg. Knit to heel. Flap length should be the height of your heel, which is difficult to measure. But if you put a measuring tape along the back of your heel, starting even with the bottom of your ankle bone and ending about halfway through the curve of your heel, you should end up with a pretty close number. You don't wanna measure to the floor because the heel turn will add some height. Standard flap is a square, though, and works for most people, so just knit the flap until you can fold it evenly on the diagonal. 

For the foot length, you need your row gauge. The tricky part here is that the heel flap takes up part of the length of the foot, and it is a somewhat variable amount of length. 

So first you need to figure out how much space the flap takes up. A standard flap knit across half the stitches will be ¼th of your circumference in foot length. (So for my 64st sock, it will take up 16st of length, or ~1.77"". I'm gonna round that to 1.75"", though, because it makes the math easier, and a hundredth of an inch is really nothing in the grand scheme of things.)

So, take that, subtract it from your total length, and you'll have the length you'll actually be knitting once you complete the heel turn and start picking up stitches along the flap. (For my foot, which is 9"" long, this means that I have 7.25"" of foot to knit, inclusive of gusset and toe decreases.)

Take your row gauge and multiply it by that number. You aren't aiming for negative ease here - or, at least, I don't, and all my socks fit perfectly - so that's it. This is however many rounds you can knit before you close the toe. (In my case, assuming 13rd/in, I should knit 94.25 rounds. Can't do a quarter height round, lol, so either round down to 94 or round up to 95.)

I unfortunately can't give a specific marker on the foot for where to end the gusset decreases, but I personally aim for a 2"" long gusset, leaving me with 5.25"" of foot between end of gusset and finished sock.

If you measure from tip of pinky toe to tip of big toe - measure this flat on the ground; may be easiest to stand on a piece of paper, mark the toe tips, then extend the lines out so you can measure the space between - you'll know how much of the foot length should be decreases. (In my case, I should start decreasing with 1.5"" left to knit - or after 3.75"" plain stockinette for the foot. So I should knit 48.75 rounds for my foot between gusset and toe at my above gauge... or 49, since, again, can't do a fractional height round.)

And checking against some completed socks I have knit to that gauge (which, honestly, is kind of my default sock gauge - given an average wool/nylon fingering weight sock yarn and a set of US 1 dpns, I will almost always hit that gauge)... those sample numbers I calculated above are almost dead on to my actual socks, which I mostly knit by trying them on as I go. 

(Usual foot length between decrease sets is 48-50 rounds. Toes are all 1.5"" from start of decreases - so 20 rounds. Heels clock in at just under 1.75"" of the length of my foot... but I do slip stitch heels, which have a tighter gauge than stockinette. Gussets are 26 rounds. Add gusset, toe, and foot rounds together and I get 94-96 rounds for the foot.)

So. Yeah. Since trying them on as you knit doesn't seem to be working for you, try swatching and then doing math from there."
knitting,feltalm,t1_fehuj8w,1579230399.0,"Oooh, okay, if you knit English, you should try a supported knitting style if you really want to speed up. You don't need to invest in fancy equipment to try it out - just get a set of long straight needles.

Try holding the right needle under your armpit, or sticking the end in a front jeans/trouser pocket. The idea here is that some other part of your body is holding the right needle, so your hand is free to just wrap the yarn.

Knitting in the round is a little trickier for anything bigger than a hat. You need *long* dpns - like, 12""+ - to use a supported style, though with shorter ones you can use a pencil grip. [Here's a video showing what I mean, because the motion is very hard to describe in text.](https://youtu.be/8o00ux6zPiE)

Oh, and if you use a supported style, you definitely need metal needles, because any other material will snap. The pencil grip method works fine with any material, though, so long as you don't have a ridiculously tight tension.

Beyond that, though, work on minimising wasted movement. Even if a supported style doesn't work for you... are you releasing the right needle every time you wrap the yarn? Try practising tensioning it over your finger in such a way that you can just flick the yarn over the needle tip without letting go of your needle. Once you get that down, work on flicking it into place as you're putting the needle in to make the stitch.

Continental isn't the be all, end all of speedy knitting. Many knitters are quite fast using the English method.

And, finally, it's all practise. The more you knit, the faster you'll get, because your muscles will instinctively know what to do. So it is worth working on maximising efficiency of movement."
knitting,fel19m3,t3_epjkmj,1579211887.0,"How much negative ease do you have in your socks? Elastic can help, but honestly, in my experience the key to a sock that won't slip around is having 10-15% negative ease. (Like, my foot is 8"" around. My socks are typically ~6.8"" around.) And I loathe ribbing, so I only do about an inch or two on the cuffs.

The only socks I've knit thus far that slip too much for work are the trio that clock in at over 7"" around. So check how much negative ease you have, and maybe try making a slightly smaller sock. (Easiest way would be to take out a few stitches.)"
instantpot,feij1e0,t3_ep9j5a,1579139663.0,"Honestly, I don't bother with the Instant Pot for softboiled eggs. Too much hassle.

If you don't need to have the entire dozen done all at once (mainly because I can't guarantee this works for batches larger than four - I'm but one man, who can only eat so many eggs):

1. Take saucepan just big enough to hold all your eggs. Make sure it's one you have a lid for.

2. Fill with an inch of water. (Your eggs will not be completely submerged with this method, and honestly I'm fairly certain that's why it works so well.)

3. Bring to a boil over medium heat (about a 5 on an electric range).

4. Once water is boiling, carefully put eggs in the pan. (I use tongs for this.)

5. Put lid on the pan and boil for six minutes.

6. As soon as the timer is done, remove the eggs from the pot and either put them under cold running water or in a cold water bath. (Or even an ice bath, but if you peel the eggs quickly you don't need ice, in my experience. And I used to work as a cook - I've peeled a *lot* of eggs.) Peel as soon as the eggs are cool enough for you to handle.

Less an art form, imho, and more a science. But, anyways, I eat softboiled eggs almost every day and this is the method I use, so I can vouch for the consistency of the results."

AskReddit,fe3rf9d,t1_fe3m87w,1578852097.0,"So, quick question for ya: How's your career going? Getting lots of promotions? Feel like you're a valued employee?

I ask because, honestly, 90% of the time when I meet a guy like you, in one breath they talk about how they hate ""small talk"" at work and aren't there to make friends... and in the next they're kvetching about how someone who isn't as good a worker as they are got promoted, but they haven't been. Or how the manager cracked down on them for an honest mistake or accident or rule infraction... but they let this other guy slide for doing something similar.

Now, maybe you're one of the lucky people who works somewhere that these aren't issues. But as someone who had to learn this the hard way... Humans are social animals. We pack bond. We will pack bond with just about anything.

And things go a lot smoother at work if you actually small talk with your coworkers. That's why the 'bad' workers get promotions, or special consideration when they fuck up, or management pulling strings to help them out. Because they're likeable. They're seen as part of the group, as a good person and therefore by extension a good and valuable employee.

Yeah, a lot of workplaces have performance metrics, but when it comes down to it? Unless there's a computer system that automatically writes people up or fires them for failing to perform to said metrics? The vast majority of supervisors are gonna be way more forgiving when the guy who chit-chats with them about banalities like how their weekend went is below standard one month, than they are if the guy who very clearly dislikes talking anything but work has an off month.

knitting,fdzyf77,t1_fdz9jar,1578798845.0,"Based on the direction of the twist, and assuming this was knit in the round:

You're knitting through the 'back' leg. Fix this by knitting into the leg of the stitch closest to your working needle, which - based on the direction your stitches are twisted - should be the one that's actually in front of the holding needle.

(At least, that's my best guess based on some quick swatching.)

As to why your mitten is wonky, it's because the stitches are twisted. You can see how the columns kind of spiral around the mitten, yes? That's called 'bias'. The shape of the stitches cause the fabric to pull in one direction, which distorts the shape of the finished item.

You can't permanently change the shape of an acrylic/mostly acrylic knit without applying some heat (so, steam blocking) but soaking and letting dry in the desired shape will help redistribute the yarn more evenly along the rows. In other words, it'll even out those oddly sized stitches. (And you don't need to get fancy here either. Just wash and dry the finished project like you intend to going forward. A simple wash and dry does wonders for making knits look more even regardless of fibre content.)

Also, if you try one method of blocking and find it doesn't work, you can always try another. (Just be careful with steam blocking, so you don't inadvertently melt the acrylic.)"
knitting,fdzsxb9,t1_fdzpw2b,1578795042.0,"Hokay, so. **In general:** It doesn't really matter which way you wrap the yarn around your needle, so long as you work into the *correct leg of the stitch*. Purling the standard way sets you up correctly to work your next row the way the vast majority of knitting tutorials explain how to work the stitches.

The important part, insofar as making sure your stitches aren't twisted, is to work into the *leading* leg of the stitch - aka the one closest to your working needle. If your stitches ain't twisted regardless of which direction you wrap your yarn, you're already doing this.

**Should you continue as you are:** So long as you keep in mind your decreases will be backwards if you're working them on a row/round after a purl row? Yeah, you're fine. It's called combined knitting, and it's a very common style.

**Would it screw up a project to change in the middle of it:** This is gonna be a hard *maybe*. Purling clockwise uses less yarn than purling anticlockwise. If you use significantly more yarn wrapping anticlockwise, you'll have a visibly looser tension on your purl rows that will not block out. However, you may not have a noticeable change in tension (the characteristics of the yarn also affect this - minor changes in tension are far more visible with cotton than with wool, for example).

I personally wouldn't deliberately switch directions in the middle of a project, but it won't befucken your project unless your tension is wildly different. (I specify deliberately because I've done it accidentally.)"

(Short in quotes because I prefer 7-8"" DPNs for socks, which are not short at all, but compared to my 16"" long Addis...)"

You won't have any tails to weave in and your new skein will be securely joined to the old one. The only con of this method is that the section where the join is may be a little bulkier than the surrounding area, but I don't think it will be overly noticeable in this part of the pattern. 

Otherwise I would personally just tink back to the start of the row and join the new skein there. While it's definitely *possible* to do a regular join and weave in the ends securely, if you're not confident in your skills, it would probably be worth the peace of mind to do either of these methods, so you know you won't get a giant hole in the middle of your lacework."

Don't fucking open packaging of shit you haven't bought."
mildlyinfuriating,fd6khcg,t3_ejytgg,1578192376.0,"...I do this, but that's because I find the motion of the wipers to be very distracting.

This is also why I make sure my windshield is well coated in Rain-X, because I have no intentions of crashing because I either can't see because of rain, or I got distracted by constant ""swipe swipe swipe""."
knitting,fcntjbx,t1_fcnsive,1577818128.0,"Easiest method would be to just use the new yarn to start knitting at the beginning of a row. So if you ran out partway through your last row, carefully unknit to the beginning of the row, then simply begin the row with your new yarn, leaving a tail about 8-10"" long to weave in later."
