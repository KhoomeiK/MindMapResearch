Guildwars2,feie8cp,t1_feglk5k,1579136456.0,"Not Bobby's problem, but ANet could afford to be a bit more forthcoming with what's being worked on (preferably without hard dates) at this point. We're technically two episodes in, and the claims of ""expansion-level content"" are entirely unsupported as of now. It's good to hear the hyperbolic claims that GW2 is in maintenance mode being shut down (there's nothing to be excited about working on in a maintenance-mode game :P) but some more substance would probably help."
Guildwars2,fegrpj6,t1_fegkfi0,1579100978.0,">even if it means some minor degree of redundancy with other weapons

It almost never does, though. Video gaming just seems to hate polearms overall, except *maybe* quarterstaves, and even those are rare (Aion Chanters and GW2 Daredevils/Revenants have them, otherwise staves are just magic foci)... so strangely the spear would in almost every case be a totally new addition with no redundancy."
MMORPG,fdt4esq,t1_fdmzpos,1578711774.0,"The massive proliferation of peripheral web platforms in general aren't healthy for MMOs. Discord attacks community and socialization, Twitch attacks design and marketing, Fandom/other user-friendly wiki platforms promote stable metas and destroy the sense of individual discovery and experimentation, etc... Alas, that's the world we live in."
MMORPG,fdt3wuc,t1_fdosvb4,1578711589.0,"Supposedly? If it was just ""supposedly"" then we would still be getting new, interesting, and innovative titles from AAA studios (besides Amazon) and crowdfunded MMOs other than perhaps Star Citizen just wouldn't be necessary for anything but super niche concepts. Publishers aren't without blame here."
MMORPG,fdszori,t1_fdq59zt,1578710035.0,This tends to be a combination between a terrible player culture (which in turn is partly due to people being tired of clueless button-mashers) and bad design decisions from developers. No group is without fault in this one.
MMORPG,fdsz82n,t1_fdqj3qf,1578709865.0,">Players choose 4. You know why?  Because regardless of balance, players will ALWAYS come up with the best builds

Nah, it's because they've been leeching out the gear and skill designs that allow for actual class diversity. There was always a meta, but AFAIK we're at a new low when it comes to the number of classes that are viable *at all*. They nerfed self-healing for no good reason, they essentially deleted Songcraft as a damage tree, and so on and so forth, and this is the result."
MMORPG,fdsyiew,t1_fdqarc3,1578709598.0,"That's not even a 'meta' problem, that's a bad design problem. For some inexplicable reason they've been draining things like the original Critical Discord out of the game, which allowed interesting combinations of classes to be highly playable if not optimal. (yes, you can still charm/ode for damage, I do it, but it's tangibly weak compared to a tree that has actual damage skills)  
They also removed the gear that allowed any chance for meaningful hybridization between damage types or etc."

todayilearned,fcxypyu,t1_fcxuxmh,1578072356.0,Big ISPs depend on *big* static infrastructure. There is physically no way to compete as a startup (unless you go to LEO satellite constellations but that's another argument to be had elsewhere)... Cars are much more scalable.
todayilearned,fcukuzu,t1_fcu3i7x,1577983252.0,">ugly and near-impossible for people to speak

Ugly sure, but near-impossible? It's got some funky phonemes for an English-speaker, but I don't see anything particularly impossible in there."

Guildwars2,fc1ctld,t3_edi0xh,1577314929.0,"It's probably another experiment. If it works the way they want it to, it becomes a long-term part of what GW2 is as a game. If it doesn't, it goes the way of Sun's Refuge."
