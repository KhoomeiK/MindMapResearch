Any poor person should have more experience getting shafted while expecting nothing with something like this. 

I dont buy something at the dollar general and get butthurt when it's trash that doesnt make any sense."

todayilearned,ff3upta,t1_ff3ubh2,1579549263.0,"It's unfair because if she tried the to race in the men's race shes be slower than the slowest man. Shes possibly gaining an advantage by sprinting to a stronger group of cyclists and benefitting from their draft when this wouldnt exist If it was a standalone race

Shes competing in the women's race. If there were no men ahead would this be a story? Female cyclist sprints in the first 10km and then falls to 74th after gassing herself."
todayilearned,ff3tj68,t1_ff3sx0p,1579548529.0,The problem is racing is done in packs. So anyone can gas themselves to get ahead early but the race is 123km for the women so it's a long road and catching the draft of the faster men is pretty unfair. Especially when the men's race is 200km so they're going to go slower to start with.
