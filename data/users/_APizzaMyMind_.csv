oddlyterrifying,fdu526s,t3_emz5e7,1578727679.0,How do they get such pristine moulds to their faces without having the snow just stick to them or melt? Does it have to be slightly frozen crunchier snow instead of really soft powder?

books,fdpjfxh,t1_fdne89e,1578630270.0,"I definitely agree with it feeling hollow and run of the mill. That would’ve been interesting! I definitely wanted to see more of them discovering the truth of the world and maybe more of their internal conflict with what they’re reading and trying to distinguish between the truth/and what else they’ve been taught? Because imagine learning one thing and being taught that all of these things are completely forbidden and then suddenly being allowed to read and learn the truths of the world? Your whole foundation of everything you know is being shaken entirely, and I didn’t really get that feeling from the characters"

curlyhair,fcof96z,t1_fcnzf7y,1577830812.0,I don’t either. I think mine is like this because of wind though? Or even like getting dressed or drying it? I just started using a microfibre towel and it’s getting better on the top layer! Try that!
curlyhair,fcof35q,t1_fco4623,1577830697.0,Oh no this is a personal attack right here
books,fcktchi,t1_fckpfjf,1577732753.0,"This is really interesting actually, I didn’t even think about the “wrap it up, crush Gilead, don’t give society ideas” mindset going into it. Obviously it was released in a time of a lot of political upset and protests for women’s rights but in a way I think even if that was her intention in writing the book, it takes away from the purpose of THT because it is supposed to be a cautionary tale of what could happen even in our world. I think that by writing a new one she’s forcing the story in one way, which almost invalidates the experiences and discomfort and growth in the first book."
books,fcksu9v,t1_fckec1m,1577732440.0,"*spoilers* This is exactly how I feel! I thought it was too predictable because from the first chapter of Daisy I knew from a mile away that they were going to make the connection that she was Baby Nicole. And so it all felt really forced and like there were too many connections between the characters. Part of what I love about her writing is that she leaves enough details out of the story and still effectively gets the point across, especially with ambiguity. I would have been fine with the plot if it was told in a different way, because I absolutely love in some of her other works (Oryx and Crake, and even a little bit in THT) where she tells the story of the past and the present simultaneously. I don’t think Testaments had as deep of an effect as she intended by having all of the testaments from people who knew and worked together in the same time frame. There was not a whole lot of variation in the time period covered by the book, and I think it would have felt more multidimensional if the stories and recollections also included more recent reflections, such as Agnes and Nicole telling their recollections in light of recent events. That could’ve shed some light on the turmoil and political atmosphere when and after Gilead falls, and I think that could’ve been more effective, instead of just “they did it, May Day was successful and Gilead falls, The End” 

I don’t know if I’m making any sense here, I hope you get what I’m trying to say!"

books,fcjoi5z,t1_fc79nsf,1577696671.0,"In high school English we did an “independent novel study” and a friend of mine and I read Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol and they were so unbelievably painful to get through. Dickens writing is really convoluted and he seems to write 3 whole paragraphs without using any punctuation! (Seriously dude, a sentence that spans 5 lines of text without a pause?!)"

bulletjournal,fccvdu5,t3_egwlgl,1577603100.0,"I went to a Welcome to Nightvale live show this year and I made a whole themed spread with art of many characters, but I absolutely adore the minimalism behind it! So good!

bulletjournal,fccv189,t3_egx687,1577602976.0,"I hate committing to one single theme because I have so many ideas that I wanna create so I either make a completely new theme each week (seriously, this term I had cacti one week, fish the next, then cells, then camping). I am aiming this year to keep them at least semi consistent with an overarching theme or quote for the month but able to have some creative space with it. I was thing of doing a “reach new heights” cover page and then have each week of the month be things like paper airplanes, outer space, hot air balloons, etc. That way I can still have my creativity in making each week my own (and not feeling stuck in a theme) but it still holds some consistency! 

Another way you could do it, is stick to one layout of a spread for each month, and draw different themes onto them before switching up the style the next month? Make it your own and have fun with it!"

Don’t worry about super intricate designs if that’s not what you’re feeling, but also don’t feel like you have to make it super minimalistic. I chose to do a different theme each week, and play around with layouts to find what works for me! Also, I like to leave a couple pages blank here and there and dedicate them to “doodle pages” to give me some creative space to de stress, collect my thoughts, or expand my grocery lists and the like! Hope this helps!"
