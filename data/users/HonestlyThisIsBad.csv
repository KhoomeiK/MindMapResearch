Justrolledintotheshop,ffjw0lr,t1_ffiwrvi,1580008482.0,The guy already told to what really happened. You just want to be a degenerate to people who haven't done shit to you.

2007scape,ffikbqb,t1_ffigq0q,1579975923.0,Not recognizing it as shitty when you're an adult makes him a shithead.
dndmemes,ffhyn3f,t1_ffgelia,1579959457.0,Being a sarcastic twit instead of coming up with a meaningful reply leads me to believe that's actually the case
dndmemes,ffgb0mp,t1_fff7rdy,1579902289.0,"If it's spoken, yes. A symbol could be complex enough to convey the same message."
dndmemes,ffga11n,t1_ffg49jc,1579901685.0,Starting a business is expensive and all sorts of hijinks can happen within the city they choose. Plus adventuring for a rug that really ties the room together.
dndmemes,ffg9jt2,t1_ffg4jkm,1579901388.0,"Bernie is the only solution currently on the table because no other candidates have campaigned on bringing the US up to the first world's standards of how to treat its citizens. You're being a centrist that balks at progress because it discomforts you and you're trying to pin it on a ""cult of personality"" instead."
dndmemes,ffg9aos,t1_ffff35g,1579901233.0,"You're on a meme subreddit, buddy. Popular memes will be seen a lot. Are you fucking lost?"

They'll still beg."
specializedtools,ff8yku3,t1_ff7wktf,1579700189.0,Not to mention he's had plenty of sponsored content without notifying viewers of it. Disgusting tactic.
Whatcouldgowrong,ff7unta,t1_ff7ko6b,1579658778.0,It's publicly available information. Seek what you will.
Whatcouldgowrong,ff7k9m4,t1_ff6cytt,1579651540.0,"That's some projection, friend."
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6cuoc,t1_ff49skb,1579624421.0,Billionaires don't pay income taxes. At best they pay some sales taxes. They up stealing exponentially more money from the government than any number of people abusing welfare.
dndmemes,ff2vlw3,t1_ff2uopl,1579525866.0,"Those are intentional metagamed mechanics to prevent abuse, which is a separate discussion than knowing when magic is affecting you during casting."
Whatcouldgowrong,ff2urn7,t1_ff2nmqn,1579524968.0,"They don't pay as much since their income isn't taxable, but they still pay more than billionaires."
PrequelMemes,ff2lnhl,t1_ff1pkvc,1579512005.0,They all have similar levels of mystery compared to TFA's cliffhanger. Moving the goalposts won't help you. Accept that you are wrong and continue with your life.
Whatcouldgowrong,ff2lir0,t1_ff1jdou,1579511810.0,Sucking unfathomable amounts of money from the economy to hoard for yourself and pay zero taxes on is not contributing to society. The unemployed and those on welfare still pay taxes. It's very simple logic to follow if you don't have your head up capitalism's ass.
PrequelMemes,ff1ip3s,t1_fet9bua,1579479840.0,"Inception, Back to the Future series, The Dark Knight, Gone Girl, LotR series, Dawn of the Dead, Empire Strikes Back, The Thing, the original Italian Job. I could keep going, but I think you get the point. You need to brush up on basic cinema."
Whatcouldgowrong,ff1hjnz,t1_ff1flt1,1579479330.0,"The people not actively contributing to society are those that don't pay their taxes. Looking at you, billionaires."

PrequelMemes,feq8oc4,t1_fek2jsj,1579338920.0,Cliffhangers exist in some of the best movies to date. What the fuck are you talking about?
television,feo5doq,t1_feo1a4b,1579295391.0,Blaming victims instead of the corporate entities profiting off them is a time old tradition here in America. Why should you stop now? Next you're gonna say it's my use of plastic straws killing the ocean.
niceguys,fekxy7e,t1_fekpssg,1579209908.0,You're not sorry or considerate. You just spew garbage replies and ignore what everyone says because self-reflection is too difficult for you. Grow the fuck up.
progun,fejkz1r,t1_fejknnz,1579178416.0,"Oh yes, a joke about stupidity. Bust out a yo mama joke next to really round out your argument."

politics,fejkugr,t1_fegsjoq,1579178287.0,"So are our infrastructure, election system, and lack of socialized medicine compared to the rest of the first world. We're not anywhere close to playing on an even playing field compared to Europe."
PrequelMemes,fejkovw,t1_fe62t4i,1579178131.0,"Lucas also calls lightsabers laserswords and is directly responsible for the prequels' major flaws, so let's not use him as any sort of reputable source of film making.

Do you have a different source on which to build your argument?"
progun,fejke4j,t1_fe9jqrn,1579177824.0,"Please continue the classic ""no you"" defense that every grade schooler knows so well."
deadbydaylight,fegqmm7,t1_fegqcor,1579100238.0,The balance was only bad because Square Enix was forcing the small dev team to work on monetizable content instead of the game itself. It was a mismanaged shitshow.
politics,fegcgql,t1_fegcc4n,1579087575.0,"Guns aren't really the issue so much as rampant poverty, mental illness, and underfunded government agencies."
politics,fegca65,t1_fegbuqk,1579087344.0,"The best part is we already pay 2x more now than we'd need to for socialized medicine. He'd be bringing home far more, realistically."
politics,fegc5oj,t1_feg1egx,1579087184.0,A tax hike would be a drop in the bucket. We already pay 2x what everyone with socialized medicine does.
progun,fe8smly,t1_fe5hwai,1578930196.0,"Considering how rarely you must self-reflect, I don't have much hope for you. Try it sometime. It's a lot easier on the mind than deflection."
progun,fe5gwpx,t1_fdt4qs3,1578869289.0,Don't try to be an intellectual if you can only comprehend stereotypes instead of using critical thinking skills.
progun,fe5gccw,t1_fdspx29,1578869132.0,"So you die to a melee weapon instead of a firearm. Congratulations, you still have rampant street crime."
PrequelMemes,fe5g0ek,t1_fdsgctt,1578868997.0,"TFA's success relied on the film after it to mature its story arcs and bring a lot of things to light. This is an extremely common tactic in the fantasy genre that has proven success. TLJ tossed away those arcs and tried to develop its own worse ones. This left the last movie to get things back on track and obviously an overly convoluted plot resulted because they had to cram two movies into one.

The sequels are a shitsbow primarily because of TLJ being such a dumpster fire. There still are other issues but it's easy to see where the weak link is."
PrequelMemes,fdsaadk,t1_fdrjr98,1578697976.0,TLJ will go down like The Phantom Menace. They share very weak plots and stupid gags. There were some fun moments in both but they were a complete mess.
PrequelMemes,fds99df,t1_fdr2hul,1578697290.0,You get all that petty internet power whilst wading through the worst refuse people on this planet can post to the site. You must be powerhungry to deal with all the bullshit the position comes with.
progun,fds82id,t1_fdrffdb,1578696476.0,"Removing guns from the law abiding public doesn't remove guns from criminals. Your argument is flawed. Criminals will always have access to firearms or other deadly weapons. The root cause of street crime is poverty, not access to firearms."
dank_meme,fdrrjzb,t1_fdrid9k,1578688665.0,"Idk, ask the country whose corrupt politicians are actively keeping it the only first world country without nationalized healthcare. Might be a clue."
StardewValley,fdqciqj,t1_fdp1wqc,1578662973.0,"I wholeheartedly agree. The amount of micro you have to do at the beginning because the game lacks substance is especially frustrating. Padding a game with fluff is some mobile game bs and I expected better.

That being said, I still really like the game and have modded it to solve most of my gripes."
gatesopencomeonin,fdblnm7,t1_fd4btff,1578258565.0,"Truths are our current understanding of reality. Currently, science is on the side of people who experience gender dysphoria receiving help transitioning and embracing what they identify as. Official, sanctioned pyschological treatments are not to be discounted as treating misguided feelings just because you don't agree with them. Have some compassion for other people."
gatesopencomeonin,fd481io,t1_fd3x613,1578165231.0,"The truth isn't consistent in all scenarios. Science is literally about testing facts and as a result there are many things we as a society have come to understand are no longer as we believed them in the past.

You are delusional if you think that your opinions count as fact."

TwoXChromosomes,fcs4orp,t1_fcrwypt,1577911422.0,"Capital punishment doesn't do any good for society. Prison time and, if possible, rehabilitation does."
YouShouldKnow,fcrtcg4,t1_fcremym,1577906347.0,"I'm just talking about what's public knowledge. They absolutely get kickbacks worth millions and it's all brushed under the rug. We'll never know exactly how much they accept in bribes. Politics attract people who like power and money, as show by how they continually give themselves raises but fight funding for 9/11 survivors."
YouShouldKnow,fcrs701,t1_fcrelp8,1577905908.0,Lobbying is extremely dominated by corporations rallying against public interests and they will find workarounds for whatever limitations you put in place to limit their donations. Getting money out of politics and keeping politicians accountable for corruption is the only way to root it out.
YouShouldKnow,fcrrnte,t1_fcrekm7,1577905697.0,"Then they'll promise more lucrative jobs and under the table bribes. More steps, same corruption. Take the hint and just remove money from politics."
YouShouldKnow,fcrdh55,t1_fcr584q,1577900354.0,"Some do, some don't. It depends on whose interests they looked after and how well they did it."
YouShouldKnow,fcrdbdl,t1_fcr47ht,1577900296.0,"So corporations just create charities to do their bidding, which is something that already occurs. That's just corruption with extra steps."
YouShouldKnow,fcr1hlc,t1_fcr0b8n,1577895392.0,Lobbying is most definitely the problem because it puts money into politics that doesn't need to be there. It only exists to protect corporations. It's bad enough that politicians get six figure jobs after they get out of politics if they vote the right way for a corporation.
Wellthatsucks,fcqy57j,t1_fcpq9h2,1577893970.0,Calling me a piece of shit doesn't make it seem like you meant the original post as a joke. I think you're just toxic.
SequelMemes,fcqxyjr,t1_fcpnkqf,1577893888.0,EA doesn't get a pass for criminal behavior just because it got kicked in the ass once and pretended to care after a year and a half. They'll continue to implement predatory lootboxes in their other titles.
SequelMemes,fcqweb4,t1_fcpmil1,1577893230.0,The problem is that $3 per hour is pricy compared to any non-AAA game and all online games. I need a better reason than the Star Wars IP to justify an unwise purchase.
Wellthatsucks,fcpo3fl,t1_fcphm03,1577868483.0,"Yes, please inflict bodily harm on your child. Surely it was the beatings they missed out on that had the effect of irresponsibility and not the fucking lessons on responsibility, you psycho."
SequelMemes,fcploa6,t1_fcpj3al,1577867029.0,"Aaand it's insanely overpriced. A 20 hour game for 60 bucks? Give me a break. No wonder the indie market has been flourishing.

Oh are we so forgetting that Battlefront 2 was so morally corrupt that multiple countries have examined EA's penchant for getting kids hooked on gambling? BF2 literally got a country to ban lootboxes. Fuck yeah EA should lose their Star Wars license."
awfuleverything,fcodlwr,t1_fco8v7w,1577829654.0,Saying something is a net positive for society generally means you're trying to ignore rampant problems that should be addressed but you're unwilling to try because it's not bad enough yet. I'm sure a lot of people had similar thoughts of net positives in Germany in the 1930s.
The10thDentist,fcocaq9,t1_fchi9cg,1577828743.0," As the other reply said, a group game is not bad just because you had a bad group. The distinction is important."
The10thDentist,fch8bzy,t1_fcgqzdz,1577648167.0,"Groups are hit and miss, the ruleset is static."
HistoryMemes,fcgd3vu,t1_fcg0ps7,1577638798.0,"Even ordinary people who weren't Nazis would betray each other to them just to stay alive. It's real easy to pretend things are black and white when you're not suffering under the regime that killed over 6 million people for the crime of existing and actively set people against one another just to kill more.

Taking context into consideration isn't being a Nazi apologist."
TheMandalorianTV,fc8482q,t1_fc80s6z,1577526511.0,Mando hated droids from the start. It was made very clear.
TheMandalorianTV,fc845gn,t1_fc7kz3q,1577526465.0,IG showed immense compassion and bravery. IG's values and decision making are very similar to Mando's so it stands to reason he'd quickly start liking it.
suspiciouslyspecific,fc21n5l,t1_fc1ze9v,1577336880.0,"When you're so far up your political party's ass that you attribute all perceived failures by a group of incredibly diverse people as the other party's fault and push against progress.

Look more than surface level before you speak."
