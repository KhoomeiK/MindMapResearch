Instead of releasing a new model every year, work on improving specific parts and releasing them as replacements. Prices should be far lower, given that they aren't building an entirely new vehicle around that one small part like the current auto market.

It would be pretty easy with an electric car, too, so long as one knows how to work with high voltage gear. Almost no fluid lines to deal with, no engine with all the complicated pipes and hoses and lines...

But then I'm of a utilitarian mindset and think that a 1960's-era Jeep CJ that I can fix with nothing more than two wrenches and a hammer is the pinnacle of human achievement.

With the right pilot that thing could soak damage all day and tear anything smaller than Assault-class mechs to pieces at any range. It quickly became the 'Lord of War'.

A Cyclops-Z I was lucky to salvage up was fitted with an X-1 ECM suite and some vicious SRM6s.

A Rifleman 1N made its way into my stable and was refitted to be host to only a pair of UAC/5s and plenty of ammo.

After several multi-kill missions in a row where it took zero damage, I renamed it the 'Pegahmagabow', for [Francis Pegahmagabow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Pegahmagabow), a First Nations soldier and the top sniper of any nation in WW1.
