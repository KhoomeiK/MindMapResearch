NTA. I understand going shopping and giving input to the bride, but they sound ridiculously overbearing. 

When I went dress shopping, my mom, sister, MIL and friend gave me suggestions but they let me take the lead. My mom would suggest a dress and then be like, ""But only try it on if YOU like it!"" We ran into a girl I knew from hs who was also trying on dresses. Her mother was being awful to her, going, ""I don't know, I hate this one"" as she tried on a dress she very clearly loved. My classmate was like, ""I really like this, though, Mom"" and her mom was rolling her eyes and being rude and my mom piped up, ""Well, ***I*** think it's beautiful on you and you're the one who has to wear it."" Her mom was shooting us daggers with her eyes but I thought my mom was such a champ for doing that. I hope she wound up with the dress she liked and didn't cave in to her mom.

Bottom line, you're the bride, it's your dress, if they can't be nice about it, I wouldn't discuss it any more. They need to be happy for you that you found a dress you love."

Typical of my dad; he was the same with people, always trying to help someone, and he felt like this poor dog had a horrible start in life (we rescued him from a hoarder situation, it was terrible) and couldn't help being the way he was. Having that dog in our home was miserable. No amount of vet visits or behaviorists helped (and they all recommended euthanizing him). We couldn't have guests over, he had a room to himself that we weren't allowed to enter, he was unpredictable (you never knew when he would bite, there were no warning signs and it would come out of nowhere). As an adult, I think that was a miserable existence for a dog and the kind thing would have been to put him down (surrounded by the family — we loved him despite his major issues). And it made us miserable too. Not worth it. Poor dog was just broken beyond repair, mentally. I don't fault my dad for his kindness but I would make a different choice now that I'm an adult. In retrospect it seems cruel that we allowed this poor miserable creature to live like that. He wanted love and affection but we were all too afraid of him to give it.

I say that as someone who loves my dog to a ridiculous degree and would do anything for her and spare no expense. But keeping a dog around that can't ... be a dog, run around, be near people ... that is just prolonging the poor creature's misery. And ruining your own home life in the process. How does this animal's life bring any happiness to anyone? Including itself? We put down dogs when they are sick and in pain but allow that kind of suffering to just go on and on.

Dogs don't understand punishment. They understand positive reinforcement. Work with her (see the videos I suggested in my other comment) and praise/reward her for any progress she makes. Punishing her later is counterproductive and she doesn't know why you're mad. Bring her kibble or low-cal treats on the walks to reward her as you go (and whatever she eats on the walk should be taken out of her meal later so she's not getting too much).

dogs,ffjf2y7,t3_etnpmm,1579996905.0,"> we aren’t over-feeding her at all!

A dog would not be 20 pounds overweight if it wasn't overfed. Same principal as with people: Diet has way more to do with weight than exercise. Bottom line, she's getting too many calories. Yes, she needs to be walked, but that's not the heart of the weight issue.

> After these frustrating walks I’ll make her go to her cage and scold her and my parents will do the same. She’ll apologize (come crawling out to our feet) every time, but the next walk is never any better.

Dogs don't ""apologize."" Using the crate as punishment is bad for the dog and counter productive. She doesn't know why you're making her go in there, she can only tell that you're mad. Dogs don't think that way (""I was bad on my walk so now I'm being punished""). But she sees you're mad so she acts frightened/apologetic. She's not connecting the crating with what just happened. Again, dogs don't work that way.

The only way this gets better is with practice and positive reinforcement. Bring a low-cal/high value treat on the walk and reward her periodically for focusing on you and walking nicely. And if you don't want her to hate her crate, you need to stop using it as discipline, or you'll wind up with another behavior issue on your hands.

This is still ... lying. It worked out for you, but in some cases, it very much doesn't work out. If you want a certain dog and it's not allowed in your apartment building, then you should consider whether you want to live there. Is that always practical and easy? No. But life isn't fair, and neither are rules and if you move into a place knowing the rules, you should follow them and be honest about it.

""Because it helped me adopt my dog"" doesn't make it any less unethical. Edit: Not to mention, what happens if you lie about a dog's breed to get your landlord to allow it, then they find out you lied? Or they get complaints about it? Now you're in a situation where you could either have to move or rehome the dog. Again, this kind of dishonesty is what causes dogs to wind up in a revolving door of homes/getting repeatedly returned to a shelter. Which doesn't do the dog a damn bit of good and could result in a dog getting returned too many times and being euthanized. Dishonesty is never a good tactic if you claim you're wanting to ""rescue"" dogs. Regardless of your opinion on breed restrictions, that's reality."
dogs,ffiti7y,t1_ffham9x,1579982329.0,"> irrational anti-pit bias

You can call it ""irrational"" all you want, but many people aren't comfortable with a pit in their home. If I go to a shelter and say I'm open to a variety of breeds but I do not want a pit or a pit mix, and they lie and tell me a pit mix is a lab mix or (vague terrier) mix and I wind up with a dog that is expressly not what I am comfortable with, that is a problem. It's unethical and in many cases dangerous (and not good for the humans OR the dog, and in many cases it's why you wind up with people not being equipped to handle the dog they adopted). So whether it bothers you or not is irrelevant.  

This is the reason I've grown to distrust my local rescues so much. The blatant lying. 

People should be able to adopt a dog knowing all available facts. I know shelters can't always know everything about a dog's history but intentionally misleading people is unethical and should be illegal. It does so much harm to the ""adopt, don't shop"" cause because it makes people not trust rescues.

If you don't want a poodle and I lie to you and tell you a dog isn't a poodle mix, you're cool with that? The consequences aren't as potentially dangerous, but do you really not agree that you should be able to decide what kind of dog you want? And not be lied to? What makes you think it's OK not to give potential adopters all the info they need to make an informed decision about an animal they are bringing into their home? If someone doesn't want a herding breed and you tell them a border collie mix is something else, you're nothing but a liar. I don't get why there should be an exception for the poor, put-upon pitbull and why pet owners shouldn't be able make those choices for themselves."

And OK with misleading people and trying to ""trick"" people into adopting dogs without all the facts? People should be able to make decisions about any animal they might adopt with all the facts, regardless of whether you think their feelings are valid (because whether you think they're valid is irrelevant). What benefit comes of adopting a dog out to someone based on a lie? It's not good for the dog, and it's not good for the person. Or is it all a numbers game (get the most dogs possible adopted/get the most funding possible), regardless of ethics or the possible consequences? Or whether you're matching people with the right dog for them? This is how you wind up with dogs getting ""rescued"" by someone who is not equipped to deal with said dog. And this is how people and dogs get hurt, and dogs wind up being returned to shelters multiple times.

This is why I ultimately gave up (permanently) on adopting. Because of people like you and shelters like yours, I don't trust rescues and shelters anymore, and it's so sad to me. I used to volunteer for one. It was wonderful. But it's changed, and now I see the way they lie to people, don't tell them about bite histories or reactivity, etc. And it's why dogs bounce from home to home and keep getting returned to shelters. You do the ""adopt, don't shop"" lobby zero good by misleading potential adopters. It casts the entire rescue industry in a bad light.

She's our second golden and the energy level of our last one went down slightly after she turned 3 or 4 but she stayed pretty spry and playful into old age (which was awesome). It's winter and snowy and slushy, which our pup loves, so we still do outdoor play sessions but it's more frequent when it's nice out, since we're lucky enough to have a fenced yard. Training sessions are also hugely helpful in getting her energy out — just 5-10 minute sessions where I break out the treats and work with her. She LOVES training. She's so smart so I think of her as our little show-off. 

Energy levels vary by dog but for ours, as long as we get in a vigorous play session, a walk and then some things to keep her mind busy (puzzle toys, a training session, etc) during the day, it's manageable.

She's not perfectly obedient at all times, especially when she's very excited or in a new environment. But she's not going to attack another dog or a person. Guaranteed. There's a difference between not being a ""saint"" and being an actual threat to other people and other dogs."

It's the same case for the people I manage. So I do regular check-ins with them to make sure things are getting done and getting done correctly. That's kind of the point of being a manager. Did you do this? You're firing him without knowing what the issue was or having conversations about this? That's poor (and very lazy) management. (Side note: I'm not saying you should have given him ""chances"" to save his job. But good managers don't let a major issue like this go unaddressed for months on end, it's a waste of time and money if you're letting a lazy employee be paid for months and months without addressing the problem)"
