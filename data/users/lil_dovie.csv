90DayFiance,ff9vk2u,t1_ff9vb3k,1579722437.0,"Probably, but I was rooting for him and hoped it was true."
90DayFiance,ff9vix0,t1_ff9v2m8,1579722415.0,That’s what I was thinking.  Maybe he reminder her if that and she kicked him out of the shed?
90DayFiance,ff9vh87,t1_ff9u3c5,1579722384.0,Ratings!
90DayFiance,ff9vdx7,t3_esfv3s,1579722323.0,But she craves STABILITY.
90DayFiance,ff9pe4v,t1_ff9p6px,1579717953.0,"Yeah, but it would be nice if he did break away from her insanity.  Unless she really looked into how or why she is how she is and is actively working on herself, otherwise, he’s stuck with her as she is if he stays."
90DayFiance,ff9p98g,t3_esfv3s,1579717853.0,She could be pregnant and he could still end it.  Single moms are everywhere.

That’s the kind of nature-loving weirdo I am!"

90DayFiance,fezxkve,t1_fezvscm,1579463006.0,Maybe she SHOULDN’T wear a bra.  Maybe that’s the voodoo?
RedditLaqueristas,feu64un,t3_eqf4v5,1579383457.0,In my opinion dark colors on short nails look good!
rareinsults,feoo9bu,t3_eq20qc,1579302932.0,This beast should be the LAST person to mock anyone with cleft palates.  Joaquin Phoenix probably had plastic surgery to correct it and looks great; she had plastic surgery to look better but ended up looking like Morlock.
AlAnon,feg1vpl,t1_fefsye9,1579073329.0,"Thanks again for your comment.  It was clear to me because I feel the same way: love is never wasted. If anything it takes courage to have the capacity to love  even after heartache.

This thread has helped feel less alone.  For that, I’m so very grateful!"
AlAnon,fefqyw3,t1_feffsp9,1579062667.0,"I totally got what you meant.  And I agree.  The fact that we can give love, in spite of having been hurt before means we have a heart.  And you’re right: I shouldn’t regret loving him; maybe some of my decisions to overlook some things he’s done, but not the fact that I have loved him.  

I guess I meant I felt dumb for going against  my gut feeling that he might still relapse.  And it’s mainly because he doesn’t believe he has a drinking problem even though I argue with him and say he does have a problem since he seems to binge every time.  So for me to believe him when he said he was done with drinking and here we are four weeks later/ it had me feeling like I was duped again.

And that’s the painful part: knowing there will probably be some relapses."
90DayFiance,fefql2o,t1_fef79tu,1579062380.0,"Me too- that’s why I had to ask’ 😊
I’m like “Is Tania Jewish?”"
AlAnon,fees8xc,t1_feeldku,1579040111.0,Thank you.  Guess it hurts more than I realized.
AlAnon,feeidj8,t1_fedoyp5,1579034360.0,"
Thank you.


Yeah.  The worst part is he really did try this time and I really did believe  he wouldn’t relapse for a long time.  But now I wonder if he was secretly drinking and just kept it under control while I was at work and would just sleep it off.  And now I realize he probably did.  So it was all a sham.

Feel dumb for thinking he might actually quit this time."
90DayFiance,feehzwr,t1_fedvgwz,1579034142.0,"Yep! Ok, yes, she is totally a SJW.  Thanks for clarifying!"
90DayFiance,feehx6r,t1_fedorg0,1579034098.0,"OH!  Ok, thanks for clarifying!"
90DayFiance,feehvcs,t1_fedngyy,1579034069.0, I guess he didn’t want her to keep crying.

90DayFiance,fedo700,t1_feditz4,1579016246.0,The yard. Or what she might call: her living room..
90DayFiance,fedo1zy,t1_feb2qqn,1579016159.0,"In this case, yes 😂"
90DayFiance,fedny80,t1_feail6v,1579016092.0,Probably call him a toxic male too.

AlAnon,fedn1zg,t1_fed7tbs,1579015515.0,Thank you.  There’s a lot of soul searching and detaching to do now.  And wondering why I chose to stay with my husband when I saw how destructive this behavior was when my dad did it.  It’s deatructive no matter who does it.
AlAnon,fedmuoe,t1_fede90j,1579015381.0,"Thank you.  This is surely our motto, isn’t it?"
90DayFiance,fedmsui,t1_fedg82a,1579015349.0,"Exactly- I think at first he was begging her to reconsider but at the airport, he was just like “let me make sure I get my ticket” and he was just going through the motions, sounding  robotic."
AlAnon,fedmo43,t1_fedl4xb,1579015261.0,"Thank you!  Yes, this is the part my Q doesn’t understand.  He thinks it’s “not a big deal”.  Which is fine- I can’t be worried about what he thinks- he clearly doesn’t worry about what I think.  So it’s back to survival mode and looking out for my best interest and seeking support other than his."
90DayFiance,fed2g1l,t1_fed185c,1578995390.0,"He did too, before he left the hotel."
90DayFiance,fed2esh,t1_fecpz23,1578995338.0,He packed it the same way when he was leaving the hotel.  Just balled-up articles of clothing.  I hope he has an ironing board at home.
90DayFiance,fed2c9u,t1_fecmn6r,1578995232.0,Hold him and rock him to sleep?
90DayFiance,fed2bk5,t1_fecka5o,1578995203.0,It was the only thing that wasn’t falling apart.
90DayFiance,fed2a3d,t1_fecq1ld,1578995139.0,Nope.  Pretty sure A LOT of us feel the same way.  I just think she was too attached to the outcome to see that this guy didn’t have much to offer and unwilling to be truthful with his family.  She just wanted him to be The One so badly that she overlooked A LOT.

90DayFiance,fec2v1p,t3_eo95ai,1578965858.0,So glad Sarah was willing to get to know Juliana!  I know this can be hard especially if there are  some cultural differences but she has smart kids who would let her know if Juliana wasn’t good around them.  I hope it works out!

90DayFiance,fcm85jx,t3_ehvgmj,1577766781.0,I love that she’s upfront but not in a mean spirited way.     I also love how level-headed she is.   And  how she isn’t taking sides but can see where a little help would go a long way towards making a situation better.  She knows what empathy is.   Anny is lucky to have her around!
HumansBeingBros,fckxi08,t1_fcksc8v,1577735305.0,"Agree.  The world can be a scary place for kids and it’s nice to let a kiddo see that there are nice strangers.  And the man knew a short  interaction like this was ok because mom and dad were nearby.

And who could resist a cute well-behaved little kid with a shopping cart?"
90DayFiance,fcktqmn,t1_fcjxfax,1577732994.0,"“Flat affect” describes Mursel fairly well and I would add that there might even be some childhood trauma, maybe some kind of abuse that might explain his child-like ways.

90DayFiance,fcjjbfz,t1_fcjdm4y,1577689828.0,"I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe he’s never flown before and didn’t understand he had to get his own luggage?   But more than likely it had to do with some type of intellectual challenge unfortunately.  

Also, Anna didn’t seem to find it odd that he seems off in some way and I’m willing to bet it’s because she has young boys and Mursel just seems familiar in that sense mentally, if that makes sense."
