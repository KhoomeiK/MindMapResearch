I think it is valid data, because for some/many of the participants their emotional state is reflective of their level of optimism and hopes for a better life based on the real underlying data they deal with everyday. If things were going well for many, the results would have been different. No need to discredit their feelings and this survey because they it doesn't include a full economic analysis of every participant and their demographic. Feelings matter as they influence decisions and behaviors."

selfimprovement,fe5d5nu,t3_entlcw,1578867920.0,"I don't know what this may offer you but I am going share it anyway, take what you can and/or disregard what is not helpful to you. I have the same tendencies, to find something other than what I need to do just to let the day pass. For me, I imagined the things I needed to do as being more difficult than they actually were, and believing that somehow they would become easier if I did them later, which is truly a deception.

I had to think back through my life and recognize all of the things that I've already accomplished - finishing school, starting a career etc. and realize that each of these things were much more difficult and I was able complete those tasks with time and effort. I then realized the things that I have to do need to be treated in the same way. One day at a time, one effort at a time, and eventually the internal resistance will fade away and the ability to focus becomes stronger and stronger.

You are much more powerful than you can ever imagine, and you are much more capable than what you may believe at this time. Just remember to tell yourself, that the satisfaction of completing a task is a much better feeling than the disappointment from not completing the task. I hope this helps you in some way. You can do it."

explainlikeimfive,fdpmgw2,t3_emm1qr,1578632804.0,"Cold weather causes water molecules to slow down to the point where they can freeze at 32 degrees or below. The state change from liquid to solid is pretty uniform when the fresh water has no, or few contaminants. As such all of the water molecules will eventually freeze based on conditions at the time. They all behave the same since they have no other molecules affecting their state change.

Adding salt to the water, changes the molecular balance of the water which makes it harder for it to freeze. The water molecules are now interacting with the salt molecules that behave differently and the salt makes it more difficult for the water molecules to behave consistently -  depending on the amount of salt present. This is why salty waters like oceans don't freeze entirely solid, there may be ice on the surface and in patches -but they don't freeze completely solid - tides help too..That's about all I remember from the DOT materials I had years ago. I hope it is correct."

The background needs another color or some kind of dark accent, or shadow, as do the bubbles in the letters. They are so pale against that hulk green, circling them in black or highlighting them with a contrasting color or even a deeper shade of the same color would ad some much needed depth. If it were my piece I would let it sit for a bit and then revisit it another day to add some pop. Of course, just my opinion you don't have to give it any credence."
