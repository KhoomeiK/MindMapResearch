relationships,ffdygfw,t1_ffduli1,1579832058.0,I found this to be the best strategy to stop people asking when we are going to have kids. Looking someone straight in the eye and saying “Are you curious if we are having unprotected sex?!” is enough to ensure that auntie will never ask that question again.
dogs,ff9lhf6,t1_ff8w6jb,1579715502.0,"Go with the Dremel! Not the one made for dog nails either because it won’t have enough power when your dog is grown and has big dog nails. I’ve got a Dremel 7700 that I picked up for $25 at Walmart. At first we just turned it on hear her feet and gave her a treat. Slowly we worked up to actually grinding the nail. Now, I grind a nail, feed one cookie, and repeat until all nails are trimmed. 

For puppy shampoo I used Earthbath Naturals. It’s got a thin consistency and rinses super easily.   I use other shampoos on her now, but I still buy the Earthbath deodorizing spray to freshen her up before therapy visits."
dogs,ff8vi6x,t3_es6wjv,1579697495.0,"Weekly is probably fine as long as you are using a good puppy shampoo and conditioner and rising incredibly well. 

I’ve got an Old English Sheepdog. I knew she would eventually be a massive ball of fur so having her be comfortable with grooming was extremely important. As a puppy she got bathed every other week, brushed at least every other day, and we started acclimating her to the nail grinder starting at 8 weeks. She’s 2 now and an absolute champ when it comes to grooming. She’s even calm when I pluck her ears.

One thing to consider, if you are going to have her professionally groomed eventually you need to go ahead and get her used to strangers grooming now. The grooming table itself can be frightening so I started putting the puppy up on the kitchen table to simulate the experience. I do nearly all of her grooming because I’d go broke paying a professional, but I don’t regret that extra early exposure."
AmItheAsshole,ff6gpc6,t1_ff5ndjq,1579626819.0,"I put up a fence two years ago. One of my neighbors is still salty about it. In my case the neighbors are older and have lived in the same homes for 40+ years and hate change. Even though my next door neighbors on either side have fences that go all the way to the property line, my fence was a bridge too far. I later found out part of the reason was that when neighbor lady was younger the previous owner of my house let her keep a small vegetable patch on the back corner of our lot. Even though she physically cannot access that corner anymore due to the steep incline, she thought of it as “her yard”.  I shut that shit down hard."

loseit,fegmtwz,t3_eowi3i,1579097509.0,"I’ve lost over 100lbs through eating less. No matter how many times I explained that I was just tracking my calories people questioned me. Was I doing keto? Weight watchers? Did I go vegan? Was i only eating cabbage soup?!? I just don’t think that most people can comprehend that you can lose a substantial amount of weight from simply counting calories and trying to eat a bit healthier. The fact that there is no magic or secret really bums people out. So many people have convinced themselves that weight loss is impossible without magic or some secret diet that the idea that eating better and less is the path to weight loss seems inconceivable.

Just stay strong."
dogs,fedva1h,t3_eolqbc,1579020636.0,Winnie seems to like her gym class! As part of her fitness class we are working on targeting. I’m trying to teach her right from left by calling her feet 1 and 2 and honestly it’s been harder than it should be.

dogs,fec9ouj,t1_feb6q4r,1578969149.0,"Thank you! 

Tonight was our first class of the full 5 week fitpaws session and it was so much better than the workshop! The people who registered for the full class were overall much friendlier. All the other dogs compete in flyball, but I really like watching them workout because it’s impressive to see an athletic dog workout. Winnie moves slow and is a good sport so the instructor used her to demonstrate some exercise sequences for the class. It made me feel like we weren’t just ruining elite practice. Plus, one of the collies is also trying to lose a little weight so my dog isn’t the only one working on her figure."
dogs,fea4tok,t1_fe9u4rl,1578944395.0,"I’m never sure exactly where I fall on the Crazy Dog Person scale. I run an Instagram for Winnie and I devote all my free time to her, but I’m so much less committed to my dog than the hardcore dog sports people. It’s just a sucky place to be because I feel like I’m failing my dog even though I know intellectually that she has a great life."
dogs,fea35f9,t1_fe9ochr,1578943880.0,"The grey area is so hard! I love doing dog stuff, but I only do it at the level that is fun for me. I could go crazy with it, but with my other commitments I don’t have the time to devote to be competitive so I only participate in stuff that feels fun. It’s made it hard to make dog space friends because everyone else is so serious. I always just feel so bad in dog space because I’m not super committed."
dogs,fe9n9w7,t3_eo4le6,1578939678.0,"Our training center is opening a Fit Gym for the dogs. On Friday they held a workshop that I attended with Winnie. I’ve never felt more like a fraud in dog space because everyone else was a Serious Dog Person. Everyone else was seriously competitive in sports so everyone looked at me like I had 3 heads when I did my introduction of “This is Winnie. Her primary job is to make people happy so she works as a therapy dog. I’m interested in fitness because I don’t want her to get fat.” 

On the upside she did shine at her job of making people happy. All the humans had huge smiles on their faces while Winnie performed her workout in the ring. What she lacks in athleticism she makes up for in muppet style."
dogs,fdrj41a,t1_fdofj6c,1578685190.0,"Heck, people take it personally when I call my own dogs fat. (They aren’t actually fat, but both are overall big for their breeds. If I didn’t monitor their food like a hawk they’d both balloon in size.)"
dogs,fdri4h9,t3_emj1j8,1578684827.0,"I keep my full coated OES in a martingale. She wears it full time, but I probably remove it every other day when I brush her. I’ve never had an issue with her getting matted or having hair get stuck on the collar."

fatlogic,fd9zg4g,t1_fd9kvnh,1578239887.0,"My depression has gotten much easier to manage since losing weight. When I was 100+ lbs heavier everything took so much energy and I felt so exhausted all the time that performing basic tasks felt incredibly difficult. This would cause me to spiral because I’d feel sad and useless because I couldn’t do normal things easily and I would attribute that to the fact I was a failure of a human being and restart the self loathing cycle. Simply being able to clean the house, run my errands, and walk the dog without being exhausted made me feel so much more capable. It’s really helped change my perception of myself from abject failure to mildly competent adult."
dogs,fckvbya,t1_fckhquj,1577733983.0,"This was also my experience. In my early 20s, I pretty much provided my dog the bare minimum of care because I was too depressed to manage anything more. I tried to make up for it in the next decade of her life, but I’ll always feel guilty I couldn’t give her more. 

Now that I’m well medicated and much more stable, my relationship with dogs feels more therapeutic. My depressive episodes are much less severe now so the dogs are great for keeping me engaged and on a schedule which keeps me
from spiraling. Overall, the dogs make me happy, but if I could go back in time I wouldn’t subject my dog to life with me at my lowest."
dogs,fa1e9au,t1_fa1842l,1575768702.0,My mom’s incredibly cute little yorkie killed a mouse over Thanksgiving. People were horrified that a froo froo purse dog could do such a thing. They seemed real incredulous that yorkies we’re actually bred for this exact purpose.
