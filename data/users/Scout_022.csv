AskReddit,fdtxgqd,t1_fdsm8wr,1578723805.0,"try this link, click on the missing pieces tab. you have to know what piece it is though.

https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/replacementparts

you need to either know what the number of the piece is, or have a pretty good description of it. you can find the part number by looking in the instructions. at the end they have a parts list with pictures of the parts and their numbers. 

if you lost the instructions, you can find those here: https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions"

I'm pretty sure this is why they are so expensive. making that many tiny pieces, out of melted plastic while maintaining insane levels of consistency doesn't come cheap from an engineering perspective."

AskReddit,fdrcxex,t1_fdrbt2b,1578682682.0,"The lunar lander is a great set! I have one too. I actually botched it’s construction early on but didn’t figure it out until the last step. You know how there ls uprights in the bottom part that connect to the top part? Well I put the bottom together wrong and they were 90 degrees off. So when I went to put the top on the bottom the door didn’t line up with the ladder!

Luckily I didn’t have to take it too far apart to fix it."

AskReddit,fdqsvhg,t1_fdqhzt3,1578674159.0,"I've bought many many legos sets over the years and I've NEVER once had a set that had missing pieces. you always end up with extra pieces, but never has there been a missing piece. 

that's an incredible level of accuracy if you think about how many lego sets they put out.

edit: wow, missing lego pieces is really provocitive! really gets the people talking!"
