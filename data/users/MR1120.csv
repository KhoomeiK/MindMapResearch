Couple that with the loss of the personal exemption, and it represents a significant swing for a lot of taxpayers. Primarily, in the middle class: Taxpayers who own a home, have 1-3 kids, and some, but not a ton of, charitable contributions.

Pre-TCJA, a MFJ family with two dependents would get an exemption of $4000 per member of the household, plus either the standard (then $12700) or itemized deduction. At minimum, that was $28700 in income that was not taxed, using the standard deduction. Say they had $9000 in mortgage interest, $2500 in property tax, $4000 in state taxes, and another $2000 in charitable contributions. That's $17500 in itemized deductions. Now, their non-taxed income goes from $28700 to $33500, between the itemized deductions and personal exemptions.

Under the TCJA, the personal exemption goes away and the standard deduction doubles. Their $17500 in itemized deductions are irrelevant in the face of a $24400 standard deduction. However, that's all the get off the top untaxed. They drop from a total of $33500 in non-taxed income to $24400. A family of 3 roughly breaks even; a family of 4 or more takes a hit; a couple with no kids probably would come out ahead.

Considering the average household in the US is 2.52 people, more people that not did come out ahead, but not nearly as many as the GOP promised. Couple that with the gifts of tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations, and the demonstrable lack of reinvestment of those savings, again, despite GOP promises, and the TCJA was overall a bad deal for anyone who isn't already a millionare."
