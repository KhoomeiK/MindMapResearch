books,ffh9xyn,t3_etfp3z,1579927414.0,I also just started a re-read of The Stand. China; yeah... sigh.
space,ffgrzz9,t1_ffgqz8n,1579913563.0,"I agree with you; I know of this already, so we're ""on the same side,"" and you STILL managed to come across as a hostile dick to me. I wonder who you think you'll be informing of your rightness? Who will listen to you? Go fuck yourself, ass."

Think about how he is acting, and then read that quote again slowly."
rva,ff23hm2,t3_er7ifd,1579492786.0,A post like this makes me think you are a big enough dick to bring it back up.

NetflixBestOf,fdnvzim,t3_emarbu,1578593967.0,I am sure Reddit will love it.

7daystodie,fcza68i,t3_ejlmye,1578096789.0,"I am also playing on Navesgane. I don't know if the location(s) of ore; or in this case, shale,, are randomized, but there is a gas station near the river that runs north/south, and if you are facing the front of the station, look to the right hand side. You should see some shale surface rocks there, and beneath them is a huge, huge wealth of shale in my game. Again, it may not be the same on other maps, but I'd be interested to hear if you find the same thing on your map."

relationship_advice,fcceqr5,t1_fcbx4vo,1577597552.0,"Enjoy your 14.50 burger if you find it worth that, good for you. One can get their hands on a two or three dollar burger in the states and not even pay a tip. And speaking of strange, you don't have to be so hostile while showing your ignorance. It costs exactly nothing to be kind."
relationship_advice,fcbwght,t1_fcbvoxc,1577591729.0,"Take it easy Ace. Its quite simple. TIPS = To Insure Proper Service; used to be given up front. Slowly migrated to after the service so one could pay for what they got. If I do a good job for you, you pay me well. If I didn't, you can tell me so as well. It is up to you. The argument goes that if the owner had to pay me a wage themselves, YOU would be paying about 22 dollars for a burger. Might be a bit complicated for you I guess."

facepalm,fc7d5oa,t1_fc6vf67,1577503948.0,"It's old-fashioned; the notion, yes. It was a poor attempt at wit, yes. He had no idea she had suffered this loss. And, she is on Tinder. Add all this up and she comes across as the one with the attitude; as if she didn't expect to be hit on, ON TINDER."
