JustNoSO,fdd4ryd,t1_fcyxdlp,1578294771.0,You should be a personal life coach. Your way with words makes everything so succinct and obvious in a way that encourages others to a more positive path.

relationship_advice,fd0oj26,t1_fczbweb,1578121645.0,He says he’s sorry and that he doesn’t want me to feel that way. Then he tells me how much he loves me and that I’m his favorite person in the world. Then we might have the once a month sex (which makes me feel like I’m guilting him into it). But nothing else changes.
