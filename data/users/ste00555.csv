Constantly dwelling on the negative problems doesnt help anyone really. In saying that youre still allowed to post how your feeling and look for support, but why not look at the positives people are having with their disorder ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Just a thought"

bipolar,fctvmyr,t3_eitkiq,1577961859.0,"A pet can do wonders. However in my experience id stick with a traditional pet such as cat or dog. These ones last a long time and just work better with humans tbh. My dog at only 1.5 years old can tell when i need a cuddle or when we can run atound and play for hours. He is great emotional support and even helps me leave the house if im super anxious, i just bring him with. If im depressed and forget to feed him or if i manic and forget as well then he barks and reminds me at the same time every day. So helpful routine wise. Thats just my experience but i believe a pet will build u routine and even help u get outside in the sun on a rough day"

bipolar,fctnt3u,t1_fctnkqj,1577950613.0,They are very protective dogs as well but have good instincts and can tell if someone isnt a good soul imo so i guess he could tell you were a good egg and thats why he went with u
