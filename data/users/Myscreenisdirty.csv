AskReddit,ff4dlnu,t3_erl7fb,1579561100.0," We joke, but K-pop is an extremely disgusting industry. It exploits  artists even more so than American music industries. I remember watching  a documentary about the contracts they make people follow, and have  camps for like 8 year olds to see who they can manipulate into being a  star. And the music itself is pretty much brainwashing people into being  happy with their mundane, shitty lives. Fuck K-pop, and fuck the keebs  who worship it."
