I can't imagine it would be too much fun as a one night stand, etc. I can totally see myself having a panic attack during sex if it's with someone I don't know very well. But high sex with your SO? Best thing in the world.

I started low, then worked my way up. Now I can take a full gummy or two and just ride. It's fucking awesome. To repeat what others have said though, your results may vary."
