but for the ford in 2018, the laptime they were doing wasnt much faster, but they were doing it every single lap, i dont have twiter anymore but DHH used to post average 50 lap averages from every car, and i guarantee if you look at the 50 lap average best lap, ford would have been 1-2 in that department.

i had the timesheets for the overall laptimes so i was mistaken on the ford. but if you look at the timesheet you will notice ford had 6 of the top 8 fastest times. and you will also notice that they lapped the field in under 12 hours. when the final restart went, corvette was right on the bumper back on the lead lap with 6 hours to go, the vette finished almost 2 laps down. they were by far the best car without a doubt. they were without a doubt the fastest car int the field.

but going off again, why is it that the caddie, and just them, were the only ones to run the same in qually as in race. even marshall pruett thought it was fishy on the podcast asking graham goodwin if he thought it was down to the turbo cars having an advantage in qually, which graham said he didnt."

ford lapped the field within 12 hours.

ford did a 1:42.7 in the race, what are you talking about?

you didnt know imsa made the roar qually sessions required to go flat out? that was the entire point, thats why they added the incentive of garage selection so teams wouldnt sandbag. it was written in the announcement of the session.

acura sandbagged as well, they were called out by imsa on it because at the 2019 roar session they ran the cars with half a tank of gas to slow it down.

YES, losing 1 tenth from qualifying is sandbagging. acura who sandbagged, still lost a significant amount of time. going from being nowhere in qualifying to the fastest car on track is hiding pace. but they ran there fastest lap at night in the race after they made a front nose change to one with no diveplanes to suit the car temperatures better.

the series has bop, its not like mazda could make their car any quicker for qualifying except low fuel new tires. something that tends to make you faster, except when you run a cadillac. where your car goes the exact same speed."
USCR,fen9tyj,t1_fen80sv,1579280097.0,"imsa isnt dumb, thats why the bop has been spot on for every race right? ford gt's in 2018 were well balanced werent they. they should have obviously been no way in the third year of the ford that they couldnt still hide pace before the race right? yet race day they were a second faster than the field and had the field a lap down before the halfway mark. but imsa isnt that dumb, no way they could have sandbagged.

cadillac hid the pace of the car in 2019, they had the fastest car for the 2019 race, didnt show it till the race. they didnt show pace at the roar test where imsa required them to go as fast as they could. they didnt show the pace. yet come race time they suddenly go from the 3rd fastest manufactuer to the fastest.

EDIT: car 10 fastest top speed at roar = 192.9

qualifying pace is always faster than race pace, ALWAYS. the 10 car went as fast in the race than in qualifying. not one other prototype in the field managed that, but all 3  factory backed caddies did...."
USCR,fem3m8s,t1_fem2j2b,1579238640.0,"1. you ALWAYS run fastest on low fuel and new tires, strange the caddie only had a 1 tenth difference while EVERY single car in the field lost a second and a half from qualifying times. if you dont think that is sandbagging, i doubt you would believe evidence apart from actual sandbags in the car.
2. the point was a flat out car was slower than a caddie that wasnt.
3. me going to 2017 showed again, they hid pace.
4. in 2018 they didnt migrate to the front. they were 1-2-3-4 before a single tire went.
5. im using the point they always sandbag daytona as evidence as them sandbagging now."
USCR,fem14gp,t1_felxhtp,1579236375.0,"you clearly missed the point, mazda lost 1.5 seconds from qualifying fastest lap and acura lost 1.4. cadillac didnt lose any pace at all, and were clearly the best car by the time the night showed up and cadillacs just left everyone in the dust. yet, they were nowhere in the roar sessions and qualifying sessions. they missed pole by 8 tenths of a second, but put the fastest race lap in by a good margin.

2018 they were 1-2-3-4  within the first hour and didnt have to push the car as everyone else had tire explosions, the acura's lost because of mechanical faults, they were going flat out for the last 10 hours and were stills lower than the caddies.

and in 2017, the fastest lap they ran, from testing or qualifying was in the race. after they were slowed down from the roar."

2018 all of the caddies qualified in the top 7 with both the 31 and 90 having problems in the qualifying session. within an hour they were 1-2-3-4.
