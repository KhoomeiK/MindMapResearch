depression,fepfzgw,t1_fepezlt,1579319541.0,"Then leave your life and do something else. Insanity is making the same decisions and expecting different results.  Right now you are just insane. So be sane and make different choices. Or stay an NPC, doesn't matter to me either way."
depression,fepdssn,t3_eq1xd4,1579318033.0,Lame. You are the only sperm that made it out of 300 million. You have servived life all this time. You are the morning and the evening star in your world and you choose to be an NPC?  In your world you are a god. You decide your limits. Better yet decide there are no limits. Wake up. Choose to be awesome and stop making excuses for your choices. Next time you want to do something instead of saying you can't ask yourself how. Keep asking till you figure it out. Fuk you only live once!
depression,fee72ti,t1_fe4emum,1579027745.0,"Thank you for this prospective. I alawys say you never know what you said or didn't say that ruined your kids childhood/life. Even with the best of intentions you never fully know the effect you have had on life till they are grown and get the chance to reflect.  It's difficult because I can already see her noticing little things. Me and her father are friends still just not very affectionate anymore. I know there will never be a good time to split up.  I also am not willing to sacrifice my happiness to stay in a unhappy relationship. I only have one life, this is not lost on me. I pray for the guidance to inflict the least amount of harm on her in this situation. By maintaining a good relationship with her dad. Trying to find a place in our current neighborhood. It's not easy but I'm working on it. If I were to stay it would have to be baised on forgiveness and falling back in love with him. But at this point I don't know how to love him. So for now I'm focused on my exit strategy."
depression,fe3t0wy,t1_fe2kt15,1578852626.0,"I said to you what I wish someone had said to me 6 years ago. I'm now stuck contemplating staying in my current situation when my feelings for him are gone from years of heartbreak and dissapointment. Because my daughter loves her father soooo much. And really, I keep thinking I could do this for her.  I loved him once maybe I could love him again.  (Trust me I hear how pathetic this sentence is.)  I really did not understand at the time how difficult the machanics of splitting up is when children are evnolved. I love her so much the last thing I want to intentionally do is break her heart. 

You will find someone to love you the way you deserve. For now focus on being the type of person someone who deserves you is. Love yourself. Continue to grow and elevate. And like a moth to a flame he will find you.

Maybe my daughter's dad does change when all is said and done but I gave him my twenties and now I'm giving him my thirties    and at this point I feel a little stuck but ultimately I'm looking toward an exit plan. I'm happy for you, that you got out of that situation. I know it's not easy mentally even without kids. You got this!"
