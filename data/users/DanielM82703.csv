learnmath,fdtkez8,t1_fdsc207,1578718034.0,"Well, we know from euler e^ix = cos(x) + i*sin(x). In this case, it's helpful to think about complex numbers as vectors. Starting with x=0, we have a unit vector starting at the origin and ending on the point (1,0i). If you work with the formula enough, it's relatively easy to see that when you smoothly increase x=0 to x=2pi, the tips of these vectors trace a unit circle! So what happens when we start at x=0 and then stop at x=pi? We trace the top half of the unit circle, and we end on the point (-1,0i). This is the intuition behind e^i*pi, and it's easy to verify by plugging in x=pi to eulers formula."

Using the derivative of a function, you can express the actual function itself as a sum of powers of x (x^2, x^3, x^5, etc) multiplied by some constants. Sine, Cosine, and Tan all have these taylor series expansions, meaning that we can numerically approximate those values using an infinite series. Each term you add makes the approximate value closer and closer to the actual value, meaning we can calculate trig values of weird angles like sin(31.6°) or tan(4.02374) that don't necessarily have closed forms."
