mazda,ffh7hzs,t3_etisbl,1579925293.0,"Welcome to the club :}

I've gone through about five Miatas (they always kept going even when I sold them!) since I started driving and they never fail to make me happy lol

But the new Mazda 3. Woooowwwwww. It was the first time I ever actually thought about buying an automatic car. Adaptive cruise control in crawling traffic is the shit"
mazda,ff9kslb,t3_es6003,1579715096.0,"Honestly I fell in love with the Mazda lineup. Rock that car hard, and idk if you're into this, but you can get a slightly louder exhaust to enhance your driving experience and you can't go wrong with LED everything, if it's not already (interior, license plates, etc).

My Miata is my dream car. I know I get smoked by a LOT of cars. But nothing better than going to the twisties and keeping up with a Corvette and beating a Porsche. The ultimate under dog. :}"
mazda,ff9kkb4,t1_ff8m6cs,1579714961.0,Bro my Miata is my dream car. I know I get smoked by a LOT of cars. But nothing better than going to the twisties and keeping up with a Corvette and beating a Porsche. The ultimate under dog. :}

It kind of creates this warm feeling in your heart that encourages you to help others. :}"

[Here's a whole page](https://activate.mozilla.community/?utm_source=www.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=contribute&utm_content=contribute-page) that lists some of the ways you can contribute to Mozilla. Some of the easy ones are of course doing common voice and helping in the support forum.

Eventually when I get better at coding, I'll definitely contribute my front end skills :}"
codereview,fe6mpes,t3_enoodn,1578896195.0,"You might wanna delete your console.logs and the UI is absolutely messed up for the play button on FireFox. I'm able to spam the play button and make the timer run extremely fast.

  
I also am unable to see your github page for the project as your link doesn't point to the project's repository."
learnprogramming,fe6mifl,t1_fe6jjw8,1578895978.0,"Honestly it feels like a full time job in and of itself haha, but I just finished the first section, web development 101.

I have all the programming finished for that last project, I just need to decorate it with CSS now :}

I was stuck on two things so far for weeks at one point, literally. I absolutely cannot move on comfortably without fixing every problem I come across in the main curriculum. But I pushed through it! And having [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/) (works with JS, Ruby & more!) REALLY helped me when I got stuck on a coding problem.

Honestly I've run into some ridiculous shit I don't think I'll ever understand, but at some points they actually tell  you that it's okay to not understand. The point of it is to familiarize yourself  with the documentation and problem solving."
cars,fe6m8q3,t1_fdzmreg,1578895689.0,"I hugged my old miata after I beat a newer Porsche (they literally all look the same to me, couldn't tell which model lol) in the canyons and even took a video of her lmao  


Nothing like man & machine bonding :}"
learnprogramming,fe6i34r,t1_fe5ukrv,1578891584.0,"Hey bro, I know you're trying to push yourself to code by giving yourself a deadline, but don't ever be discouraged if you don't land a job by the end of the year. Strive for consistency and discipline! Good luck :}

Btw I set a goal for myself as well last year, to be employed within a year, on June 16, 2020! Life got in the way (so probably won't happen), but I keep hacking at The Odin Project at least every few days!!!

I don't mean to sound like a shill but it's an open source, free curriculum for learning web development!"
