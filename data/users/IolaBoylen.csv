educationalgifs,ffvq2ys,t1_ffviqau,1580270136.0,"A few years ago, I started having some mild tooth pain on vacation. On the way home, I had a layover in Toronto, and the tooth pain turned up to a 6 or a 7. Then on my flight back to Pittsburgh, as soon as we started to descend, the pressure made it feel like my tooth was going to explode out of my face. It was a Saturday night and I suffered through Sunday until Monday morning. Thankfully I was able to see the dentist that morning. I would have been beside myself if he’d wanted me to take antibiotics for a week first - I just wanted the pain to stop! He drilled into my tooth and removed the roots, and then I went back the next week for him to finish the root canal. The most painful part was paying for everything LOL. And the doc told me I only had a “mild abscess.” Would hate to know what a severe abscess feels like."

bulletjournal,ffm7ko3,t1_ffm4tah,1580049822.0,"It’s really beautiful! I felt like I spent so much time prepping my bullet journal - time that I could have been spending doing items on my “to do” list. So it became more of a burden than an enjoyable hobby. But lately I’ve been thinking that I want to get back into painting or drawing. 

Btw, I’m very impressed with your watercolor skills!"

bulletjournal,ffm44ku,t3_eu4mlv,1580048091.0,Wait did you paint this??? It’s beautiful. I gave up on my bullet journal but I love to look at others’ work. Maybe one day I’ll get back into it . . .
