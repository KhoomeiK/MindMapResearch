It's literally been a problem throughout U.S. history. The genius of the American system is that it requires broad consensus to make changes, so it is slow to react to temporary political winds.

The drawback of the American system is that when it does change, those changes can be so colossally slow that the U.S. keeps laws in place long after a broad consensus no longer supports them. This causes social unrest as a small minority can stop a broadly popular change in the law."
AskHistory,ffnh1lw,t3_eu9eqy,1580065865.0,"Nothing. The British, in fact, at various times proposed this and Tory-leaning American politicians occasionally advocated that the Americans should take up the offer.

But that's not the ""representation"" most American politicians were talking about. They had state, er, colonial legislatures, and for them, that's the representative body they believed should have taxing power. More specifically, they believed that that body should be co-equal with Parliament on tax issues, so either body could veto the other if they proposed a tax, and neither body could pass a tax without approval of the other.

Several of the colonies had a legitimate gripe because their colonial charters (that is, the precursor to the state constitutions) explicitly gave their colonial legislature the sole power to tax their citizens. And Parliament had agreed to and signed those charters. If British Parliament wanted to tax the locals, they had to get the colonial legislature to agree. This was the reason that American politicians were against the idea of representation in Parliament. Not only would their votes be drown out by the superior voting power of British-based MPs, but they would be giving up legal power they *already* had. If they were willing to roll over on this provision in their charters, then the rest of the charters wouldn't be worth a whole lot just as soon as Parliament had a problem with any of the rest of it.

Of course, not every charter was written the same way. Some of the colonies didn't have the tax power written in their charter. Those colonies actually didn't overwhelmingly get involved in the Revolution due to the tax issue. It was only when Parliament completely suspended Massachusetts' charter and put them under marshal law that most of the other colonies freaked out. If it could happen there over that, it could happen anywhere over anything.

Massachusetts was primarily the colony that had the tax argument. They were being taxed over the French and Indian War in a violation of their colonial charter over a war they hadn't been much involved in, and only at the request of Parliament. That war was mostly Virginia's deal. Some of the other colonies did offer support, particularly Pennsylvania, being one of the other colonies that had local tax power. But even then, the issue didn't amount to a call for a revolution until Parliament made it clear that the colonial charters were only voluntary on Parliament's part and they could violate them at any time for any reason.

When it became clear that the Americans weren't going to back down, during the Second Continental Congress, Parliament tried again to offer the olive branch of allowing local representation for taxation issues. A better motto probably would have been ""No taxation except from our local representation"". But by that time, it was too little, too late. There wasn't anything stopping a new Parliament from reneging on the deal, and if that happened they'd be back in the same place. The American colonies had no ability to sue in the British court system so all they could do was write a letter to Parliament saying, ""Pretty please would you actually respect the law as it's written?"" They'd been trying that for 15 years already and all it had gotten was Parliament to revoke Massachusetts' rule of law with the message: ""Parliament *is* the law. Any of you other colonies try the same thing, then you'll be next."""

That assumes the Reds were interested in signing him to a one-year deal, and at $18 million. The Reds signing Ozuna at all only ever made sense if they could then turn around and trade away some kind of package of one or more of Senzel, Aquino, Winker, Ervin, and/or Vanmeter in return for some other piece(s) they need. That's a lot harder to justify if Ozuna is just a rental, because the trade for any of those other guys was always going to be for another rental. Now you've got multiple holes to fill come 2021 and a lot less trade bait to work with in case you can't plug all those holes with free agents. 

Signing Ozuna to a one-year deal effectively would mean the Reds would be all-in on 2020, with a single year window. They would need to rebuild again in 2021. You'd lose Ozuna, Bauer, and whoever you traded your other outfielders for (probably a rental SS)."

movies,fewmtls,t1_fewf1ed,1579415040.0,"There is a niche audience for VHS, but definitely not for the videophile/audiophile crowd concerned with fidelity.

There is an even smaller niche audience for film collectors, like on 16mm, 35mm, and 70mm film. If it actually could turn a profit, distributing a film for the home market on newly-printed 35mm or 70mm actually would be comparable to new reprints of vinyl, because it's an analog format that really can hold its own against Blu-Ray and streaming and even 4K, as long as it's kept clean and hasn't been played to death. 

The problem is, making a film print is incredibly expensive and the equipment tends to be very noisy. Maybe someone could overcome those obstacles, but there's not enough of a home market for it to find out. The collectors are happy collecting vintage copies, which is expensive enough as it is.

The interviewer, Charlie Gibson, had given her ample opportunity to cite some relevant foreign policy experience that would back up McCain's claim. Instead of either pivoting to something somewhat relevant like most experienced politicians would, or saving face by saying something more general about, ""As a governor I have done XYZ, and the U.S. has to be careful when dealing with Russia"" she doubled down. She cited some things she thought Russia was doing wrong and then claimed she somehow had more insight into this since Alaska was so close to Russia geographically. Gibson offered her the opportunity to explain and she couldn't offer any details.

The relevant portion of the transcript:

> PALIN: ...We have got to keep our eyes on Russia, under the leadership there. I think it was unfortunate. That manifestation that we saw with that invasion of Georgia shows us some steps backwards that Russia has recently taken away from the race toward a more democratic nation with democratic ideals.

>
> PALIN: **They're our next door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska.**

The full quote, I think, is actually stupider than the SNL joke about it, because she makes the claim that being neighbors of Russia gives her particular insight into Russia's recent actions, and she's asked quite directly to explain this insight, and her answer is, ""Being neighbors gives me insight into being neighbors and you can see Russia from Alaska.""

She actually did slightly better on the follow-up question, but the damage was already done. It was pretty obvious she had no actual direct experience dealing with Russia that she could cite, but instead of answering the question in generalities she doubled down on a dumb claim, and SNL made fun of her for it.

AskHistorians,feb2f57,t1_fe9krl0,1578954841.0,"Right, I get all that. My question is: what separated the National Republicans/Whigs ideologically from the Federalists? And same with the Jeffersonians and the later Jackson-allied Democratic Party? Why aren't they just considered continuations of the earlier parties, after a brief (less than a decade long) period of dormancy, after Monroe (and to some extent) Madison governed as Democratic-Republican who would sometimes moderate?

For instance, the Federalists supported federal funding to build the national road. They supported the establishment of the national bank. And Whigs supported ""internal improvements"" of building roads and canals. And they wanted to keep/re-establish the national bank. Considering those ideologies appear so similar, then what else about the parties separates Whigs from Federalists?

On the flipside, the Jeffersonians opposed funding of infrastructure by the federal government, such as for the national road, and some even thought it was unconstitutional. They opposed the national bank. The Jacksonian Democrats also opposed the ""internal improvements"" programs, and opposed the national bank. So if not for those ideologies, what separates Jeffersonian Republicans from Jacksonian Democrats?

Or am I completely off-base in my interpretation of these bloc's ideologies?

I do understand that the Federalists essentially collapsed after the Hartford Convention. But why aren't the National Republicans/Whigs just considered a resurrection of that previous party, after spending several years in the weeds, since their ideology appears so similar? What separates John Quincy Adams ideologically from John Adams?

And same on the other side. What separates Andrew Jackson and the Democrats ideologically from the Jeffersonians? Jackson was a strong supporter of Jeffersonian politics before his presidency - why is his considered a new party rather than a continuation of Jefferson's Republicans under a new name?

Or am I misunderstanding? Maybe historians *do* consider the Second Party System to be a resurrections of the previous parties under John Adams/Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson/James Madison, but they are conveniently split into the First Party System and Second Party System because there was a period under Monroe and (late in his term) under Madison of moderate government that embraced some ideas of both parties?

todayilearned,fdok2fe,t1_fdlzbqu,1578606727.0,"No, they did not. They were not light rail. They were heavy rail. They were single cars made for tracks with curves and turns that couldn't accommodate more than a single car. And being heavy rail, they were very, very slow. They were essentially just buses on train tracks, but much slower. Top speeds were usually 10-20 mph in cities, due to their inability to stop very quickly, and due to the curves in the track. With all the stops on the route, they often effectively went less than 10mph.

Outside the city center, they were faster, but still not fast. In the late stages of the heavy rail era, in the 50s and 60s, some of those could top out around 60mph, but those were basically confined to a couple of metro areas that still had them. Most cities that had the historic streetcar systems topped out around 35-45mph.

This is why they were replaced by buses. Buses were much faster, could provide more frequent service, didn't require the same kind of infrastructure, didn't bring the system to a halt when they broke down, could drop people off curbside (the original streetcar tracks were mostly built in the middle of the street), and on and on.

Light rail as we understand it today, with high capacities and high speeds, didn't exist until the mid-1960s, and really didn't become a thing much of anywhere until the 1970s. The streetcars back before WWII were all heavy rail, and horribly slow. Like, when there was mechanical trouble, people just walked because it was faster since they only went about 8mph anyway."

todayilearned,fdm555k,t1_fdlz2eu,1578540036.0,"I think that depends on what you call ""anomalous"". For instance, while Budapest continued to have trams from before WWII and after, for several decades, they were deprecating tram lines in need of repair and instead using buses. None of the current tram track lines in Budapest was build before 1975.

In Bern, where war damage wasn't really an issue, there were 15 different tram lines operating in 1935 at its peak, but all but one of those had been put out of commission by 1973. They started replacing some of these immediately after WWII, but all of that second generation were eventually considered old and inadequate. That new network had shrunk down to 9 lines in 1974, with the remainder of city's mass transit network supplemented by bus service. The city's network currently consists of 5 lines, all of which have been built since 1987. 

Basically, the same thing happened in the U.S., except there was a much greater emphasis on suburbanization in the post-war era, which made the buses a much more attractive option, since commuter rail is a different beast from city rail and would require much more infrastructure outlay. So there was no popular nor political will in most cities to dump money into completely upgrading an urban rail network fewer and fewer people would be riding. The cities were going to have to deal with commuter auto traffic anyway, and it's easier to run buses to the new, growing suburban town than it is to build a commuter rail to that town, only to find that some other suburb is the new, growing place to be. It makes a whole lot more sense for U.S. municipalities to try to build rail networks now, when people are returning to urban areas, than it did in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, when so many people were leaving cities."
todayilearned,fdm2ngc,t1_fdlrpoi,1578538348.0,"Yeah, it pretty much reaffirms what I wrote. You can see from the pictures on the page that the streetcars were all single-car trains, not much bigger than buses. They also provided less frequent service than buses, since buses don't have the same limits as trains do as far as number of units per line.

The Yellow Car downtown also ran an an unusually narrow gauge of track, which necessitated narrower streetcars, which also limited passengers.

And long before any conspiracy started in the 1940s, the L.A. streetcars were being replaced by buses. From that Wikipedia article:

> ""By 1920, when most of the company's holdings had been developed, their major income source began to deplete. Many rural passenger lines were unprofitable, with losses offset by revenue generated from passenger lines in populated corridors and from freight operations. The least-used Red Car lines were converted to cheaper bus routes as early as 1925.""

If you happen to peruse the L.A. Times newspaper archives of the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, there are regular articles about Pacific Electric replacing streetcar lines with buses because the streetcar lines had become unprofitable and the equipment was old. They did continue to upgrade a few of the profitable lines, and kept them operational until the early 1960s, but this is only true of a few lines. Most had already been replaced by the onset of WWII. For instance, service on the 2, 10, A, and K lines, and most of the 9, D, and U lines were all suspended between March and September 1941, the L.A. Railway Corp. having already begun the planning and purchasing for this conversion to buses back in 1938."
todayilearned,fdlqi15,t1_fdlmsb2,1578530077.0,"Yeah, exactly. Reddit has it in their head that the streetcars that were pulled out were like the trams in Portland or Amsterdam. They were not. They were single cars on tracks in the middle of the street built in the 1800s that could not handle more than single cars because of the sharp turns. They had lower capacity than buses of the time, and top speeds of around 10-20 mph. They were inferior to buses in pretty much every way.

Modern light rail trams didn't come about until the 1960s and 70s. Even in cities that have extensive modern light rail, like Amsterdam, had pulled out nearly all their historic heavy rail between the 1930s and 50s. Amsterdam operated almost entirely on buses from the 50s through 70s before starting to build the newer, high capacity, higher speed trams. And even the 1970s version are pretty substandard, in comparison today. When the streetcar companies were going bankrupt in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, light rail streetcar tech was still decades away from being possible."
todayilearned,fdlpx4w,t1_fdlmj3x,1578529682.0,"Early 20th century streetcars didn't run on right-of-way, either, which was one of the problems. Most of the tracks were laid out in the 19th century when there was no or next-to-no automobile traffic, so they put the tracks in the middle of the street, furthest away from the sidewalks. They impeded all other traffic and needed to be ripped out. That's why the streetcar companies were converting to buses decades before GM or any other ""conspiracy"" got involved.

They also didn't have high capacity. Streetcars weren't like modern light rail. They were heavy rail. They were single cars that didn't hold any more passengers than buses. The tracks were designed for single cars in the 1800s and the tracks had rarely been upgraded since. Multi-car trains couldn't maneuver the tracks without the tracks being rebuilt, especially in downtown areas.

They were in desperate need of upgrades, not just the trains themselves but the tracks and the power stations. Streetcar infrastructure is massively more expensive than bus infrastructure - building and maintaining tracks, often with the need of expanding roadways so that other traffic can go around them or have their own dedicated lanes. And any time there's a problem, and a train breaks down, it brings the whole line if not system to a halt. And they are not adaptable to where people live. They can't be rerouted easily like a bus when a new neighborhood starts to become populated.

Oh, and these historic heavy rail streetcars didn't have hydraulic breaks, and had top speeds of around 15-20 mph, because they were so bad at stopping. It takes a while to speed up and to stop, so between stops, the trains couldn't get very fast since the stops need to be relatively close together for the train to be convenient. 

Literally, everything about them needed to be replaced at tremendous cost, but most of their disadvantages could be overcome with much cheaper buses. Buses don't require tracks, they could hold more people at that time, they could provide more frequent service, they were easily replaceable when one bus broke down and didn't bring the system to a halt, they could drop off passengers curbside instead of in the middle of the street (because that's where the tracks were mostly built), they were faster, and they were climate-controlled.

The streetcar companies were going bankrupt left and right starting in the 1920s, and often ended up being sold to the city. The city would then often put it to a vote by the public on whether to improve them or not and the public almost always voted no, instead opting for buses.

Even in Europe, the same thing happened though a lot of that was through force (tracks and infrastructure being destroyed during WWII). The tram-style ""streetcars"" with multiple cars, higher top speeds, right of way, etc., didn't really come about until the 1960s and 70s. Even in Amsterdam, which is famous for their trams, only two lines (and not even the full lines) date from before the 1960s. They ripped all the historic, heavy rail streetcar lines out in the 30s, 40s, and 50s and replaced them with buses. They then started to rebuild the rail system with modern tech in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. In the interim, buses were the vastly superior technology.

I do agree that modern light rail streetcars are a better option than buses, but buses are far and away a better option than the historic heavy rail streetcars that were dismantled virtually everywhere. If you want to get a taste of what historic streetcars were like, try commuting on the 10-mph streetcar in New Orleans, which use those heavy rail monstrosities with capacities no larger than buses. It was unique in that it was built with right-of-way, unlike pretty much every other one, which is why it's still there. But even that was only true of the couple of lines that still exist. New Orleans ripped out all the other lines that didn't have right-of-way and replaced them with buses, just like everywhere else."

Someone asked what non-carbonated lemonade is referred to in non-North American Anglophile countries. You copy-pasted the Wiki info. I replied to say that this is interesting, but that it is a somewhat recent phenomenon, that ""lemonade"" was initially a non-carbonated drink in the English language everywhere, and the carbonated definition came later.

You then responded that non-carbonated lemonade could be fermented, which would give it fizz. I replied this is true, but that it is irrelevant because that's historically not how the English language word *lemonade* was used. Instead of refuting this with a reasoned argument, or accepting it as fact, you got upset, and started a series of ""nuh uh"" posts.

> Why, for instance, do you keep harping on about the UK and OED?

The OED is the most thorough etymological dictionary of the English language. I'm not sure if you are familiar with the OED, but the whole point of the project is to track down the earliest usage of every word in the English language, and every definition that each word later takes on. Thus, you can look at it and find the very first instance of every definition of every English word in print. This allows you to pinpoint where the splits in meaning came into use, and where the new meanings arose, since every definition of a word will have multiple examples of each and every definition, beginning with the very earliest instance of that definition.

This makes the OED invaluable when researching the usage of words in the English language, and the OED points to ""lemonade"" as being a non-carbonated, non-fermented drink, until shortly before its 1908 volume. Up until that point, whenever a ""lemonade"" contained bubbles, the English language qualified it in some way with a description (""potable lemonade"", ""aerated lemonade"", ""sparkling lemonade"", etc.) Thus, based on the evidence presented in the OED, I pointed out that the word ""lemonade"" alone would not have referred to a fermented nor carbonated drink before the late 1800s, unless it was qualified with a description (""aerated lemonade"", ""effervescent lemonade"", ""fermented lemonade"", ""lemon wine"", etc.) as a fizzy variation on the drink.

> Do you think Lemonade was invented in the UK and didn't exist prior to your dates? It seems so.

I am trying to establish when the definitional split between North American English and non-North American English occurred. I didn't mean to imply anything about how long the drink had been around before that time, just about what the word ""lemonade"" meant in the English language.

> So here is some information to chew on...

Ah! Your first attempt at actually trying to find a factual basis for your argument. Well done. 

The post, though, uses as its source some website called mobile-cuisine.com, which uses as *its* source the Wikipedia article about lemonade. Unfortunately for them, the Wiki article does not say that. In fact, the source that Wiki (at least now) relies on is *Soft Drinks: Their Origins and History* by Colin Emmins which has this to say on page 7 of the book (the whole book is linked on lemonade's Wiki entry):

> ""The earliest English reference to lemonade dates from the publication in 1663 of *The Parson’s Wedding*, described by a
friend of Samuel Pepys as ‘an obscene, loose play’, which had been first performed some years earlier. The drink seems to have come to England from Italy via France. Such lemonade was made from **freshly squeezed** lemons, sweetened with sugar or honey and diluted with water to make a **still** soft drink. In this guise lemonade continued through the years that followed, **prepared, sold and consumed on the
premises** rather than bottled to take away.""

""Still"" means non-carbonated, non-fermented, and being ""prepared"" on premises with ""freshly-squeezed lemons"" would mean that the original English meaning of *lemonade* was of a non-fizzy drink, regardless of what drink was being served in France in 1630. (Note that 1663's *The Parson's Wedding* is what the OED also gives as *lemonade*'s first appearance in print in the English language, concurring with Emmins.)

But maybe Emmins is wrong? 

Probably not. According to the landmark academic history book *Oranges* by John McPhee, the date of 1630 in Paris of lemonade's introduction is correct, though the author provides no recipe or detail of what the drink consisted of at that time. *Much Depends on Dinner: The Extraordinary History and Mythology, Allure and Obsessions, Perils and Taboos of an Ordinary Meal* by Margaret Visser agrees with the date, giving the recipe as ""lemon juice sugared and diluted in water"".

*A History of the Food of Paris: From Roast Mammoth to Steak Frites* by Jim Chevallier concurs with the other writers on the 1630 Paris date, but states on page 161 that it was some time after 1649 that a recipe actually appeared: ""La Varenne provided recipes for making *limonade* using jasmine, orange, and other flowers, or simply lemons or oranges with sugar and water"". Again, no mention of ""sparkling water"".

Most authoritatively would be the *Trésor de la Langue Française*, the French language equivalent of the OED, which gives every definition of every word in the French language, and that definition's first appearance in print in the language.

Like the OED, they give two separate definitions for *limonade*. The first definition is: ""Drink made of lemon or lemon juice, water and sugar"". (At least, according to Google Translate. The original French is: ""Boisson faite de jus de limon ou de citron, d'eau et de sucre"".) They say that this definition dates to 1640, under the alternate spelling *limonnade*: ""refreshing drink made from lemon or lemon juice"" (""boisson rafraîchissante faite à partir de jus de citron ou de limon"").

As in the English language, it's only under a second definition that it got its fizzy meaning: ""Refreshing drink made of water saturated with carbonic acid, slightly sweet, flavored with syrup or lemon essence"" (""Boisson rafraîchissante faite d'eau saturée d'acide carbonique, légèrement sucrée, parfumée avec du sirop ou de l'essence de citron""). However, this definition only dates to 1804 in the French language. Before this time, according to the TLFi, this variation was referred to as *limonade gazeuse* (""gas lemonade"") while the non-fizzy lemonade was referred to by the original name, or else as *limonade absolut* if the distinction needed to be made.

In fact, the HowStuffWorks/Mobile-Cuisine assertion is an anachronism, *unless* it was fermented. Carbonated (i.e., sparkling) water, wasn't invented until 1662 by Christopher Merret, but it wasn't until 1781 that it became commercially viable, building on the experiments and publications of Joseph Priestley in 1767 and 1772. So any kind of fizzy lemonade would have had to have been fermented in 1630, and not artificially carbonated, which means that ""sparkling water"" by itself could not have been an ingredient. Only a fermented lemon water could have been, and none of the pre-1800s French sources make any mention of fermentation.

Your source actually alludes to why the lemonade drink would not have been fermented at that time. According to Visser, among others, the *limonadiers* formed their own guild in Paris in 1676 because the existing guild of alcohol street vendors would not let them join, so they had to start their own. It could be inferred that if they were serving alcohol, they would have been welcome to join.

> But wait. There's more...

This is a better point, and this is true, though it does not refute my argument. According to Emmins' *Soft Drinks: Their Origins and History*:

> ""The earliest reference trade historians have so far found to effervescent lemonade is in 1833""

All this says is that an artificially fizzy version of lemonade didn't exist until 1833. And there is no mention before that, that the English word ""lemonade"" referred to a fermented drink. Thus, before 1833, lemonade was a non-fizzy drink. Thereafter, it was qualified with a description, such as ""effervescent lemonade"", etc. It took many decades before a drink could be called ""lemonade"", plain and simple, anywhere in the Anglosphere and be understood to mean a fizzy drink. From the preserved evidence, it seems that this had occurred around about the 1880s, though it never caught on in North American English. 

Thus, in other English dialects, there appear to have been three distinct phases: 

1) Before about 1833, ""lemonade"" was a non-fermented, non-fizzy drink. 

2) From about 1833 until about the 1880s, ""lemonade"" could mean either a fizzy or a non-fizzy drink, however, it was the fizzy drink that tended to need qualification, such as ""effervescent lemonade"", ""aerated lemonade"", ""fermented lemonade"", etc. 

3) From about the 1880s on, the flip began to occur, where unqualified ""lemonade"" was fizzy, while a non-fizzy version would need further qualification, as ""still lemonade"", ""soft lemonade"", ""virgin lemonade"", ""cloudy lemonade"", ""old fashioned lemonade"", etc. This flip was not complete by the time of the 1908 OED volume covering lemonade, where the fizzy definition was said to only ""now"" be coming into use. Therefore, based on contemporary usage, the flip can be inferred to have been completed sometime after 1908.

Thank you for actually providing some sources this time. They weren't exactly academic, but better than nothing, and provide a jumping off point to research where they got their information from. It seems the first assertion was likely a ""jump to conclusions"" fallacy, since there is no proof that the water in 1630 was ""sparkling"" (impossible without fermentation in 1630), but it does shed light on how the drink came to the English language, and the second shows when fizzy lemonade first appeared in the Anglosphere (1833)."
todayilearned,fdd0y2l,t1_fdcpiov,1578290475.0,"> You're giving short stories and poetry as 'evidence' to prove what exactly?

As contemporary contextual evidence before 1880, representing the context in which the word ""lemonade"" was used at that time in the U.K. I already gave the definition as it appears in the *Oxford English Dictionary* in 1908, which gives the same meaning as the contextual evidence does. 

If you want to know what the difference between contextual evidence is versus lexical meaning, refer to the article ""Lexical Meaning Versus Contextual Evidence in Dictionary Articles"" by Rufus H. Gouws, published in 1987 in *Dictionaries: Journal of the Dictionary Society of North America*, the journal of the Dictionary Society of North America.

If you are concerned with further lexical evidence, you can refer to *Chambers' Etymological Dictionary of the English Language*, first published in the U.K. in 1872, which gives the definition of ""lemonade"" as: ""a drink made of lemon-juice, water, and sugar"". The second edition of the *Chambers* dictionary, published in 1900, gave the same definition, verbatim.

You can also refer to James Stormont's *Etymological and Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language*, published in Edinburgh and London in 1881, which gives the definition of ""lemonade"" as: ""a sweetened water flavoured with lemon-juice"".

Neither implies fermentation. Contextual evidence in other sources implies just the opposite, that it was not fermented, such as in contemporary recipes. And the 1908 OED makes clear that ""lemonade"" referring to a fizzy drink was a recent innovation in the language.

Compare to the definitions of the word ""cider"" in the OED, in Chamber's Dictionary, and in Stormont's Dictionary, all of which mention that ""cider"" can be ""fermented"" or ""intoxicating"" but not necessarily. Cider is ""the expressed juice of apples, either before or after fermentation"". There's no such qualification with lemonade, and the recipes of the time for making lemonade make it clear that it could not be fermented if following the instructions on how to make the drink.

Thus, when the OED makes a point of defining ""lemonade"" as recently (as of its 1908 edition) coming to refer to an aerated drink in British English, separate from the main definition where it is defined without reference to fizz or fermentation, it can reasonably be concluded that the non-fermented, non-""aerated"" version is what ""lemonade"" had historically referred to, until recently before 1908. If it were not, they would have said so, as they did with their definition of ""cider"". 

And if you want further information, and are interested in what the definition of an ""-ade"" drink itself is, the OED has the answer to that too. According to the 1st edition of the OED, *-ade* is the French version of the English suffix *-ate* as in ""*acetate, mandate, syndicate*"". The suffix *-ade* has several definitions, and the third they give is:

> ""The product of an action, and, by extension, that of any process or raw material; as in *arcade, colonnade, masquerade, lemonade, marmalade, pomade*.""

In other words, lemonade is a product of an action (in this case, juicing lemons) on a raw material (in this case, lemons), but it doesn't have any further specific meaning than that. It could be fermented, it could not be, since *-ade* doesn't imply either. For that, you'd want to refer to the OED's definition of *lemonade* itself, which, again, gives a separate definition from the main definition, where the fizzy version was a recent (as of 1908) innovation in British English.

> And you have the audacity to slam me for linking you to a recipe?

A 21st century recipe is irrelevant to the context of the word as to how it was used in the Anglosphere outside of North America before 1880. Several 19th century recipes say explicitly that the drink is ready for consumption immediately after preparing it, or after the boiling water has cooled down. No recipe mentions waiting for it to ferment. In fact, at least one source says that the reason it is a good summer drink is that once it's made, the acetic acid naturally cools it down, so even on warm days, it's colder than most other drinks even without storage in a cool space. This, again, would imply that fermentation is not associated with the drink.

>> Guiltless of faintest fizz.

> What do you think this means? Faintest fizz?

You're missing what ""guiltless"" means here. It is ""not guilty"" of even the ""faintest fizz"". It is ""innocent of even the faintest fizz"". The line means that it is absent of fizz. 

> You think that throwing out sources and attempting to interpret them to fit makes a coherent argument.

I'm interpreting them using a plain meaning of the context. I have already reproduced the Oxford English Dictionary definition in both its 1908 version in the first edition, and its (still ongoing and online) in its third edition. I have also reproduced the definition in the Chamber's dictionary, and in Stormont's Dictionary. I have given many sources to affirm its usage before 1880.

An 1818 cookbook published in London (*A New System of Domestic Cookery* by Maria Eliza Rundell) gives a lemonade recipe for ""Lemonade to be made a day before wanted."" The reason it takes a day is that the recipe suggests dissolving the lemons in ""three quarts of hot, not boiling water, and cover it over for three or four hours"". Considering there was no refrigeration in 1818, the lemonade would come back to room temperature by the following day. In any case, one day isn't long enough to ferment a drink.

An 1854 cookbook published in London (*Plain Family Recipes; or, Cottage Cookery*) gives a similar recipe: ""When the sugar is melted, the lemonade is ready."" Again, not enough time to ferment the drink.

An 1856 *Traveler's Library* published in London (by Longman, Brown, Green, and Longman) noted the difference between lemonade in Brazil versus the lemonade in England. In Brazil, the waiters served ""effervescing lemonade"" with ""prepatory fizz"". But, the London writer lamented that it did not quench one's thirst like English lemonade did: 

> ""Unfortunately, though your mouth may water, your throat is dry as ever, and I had to make up for the loss of real lemonade as I best could.""

An 1868 cookbook published in London (*Wholesome Fare; or, The doctor and the Cook* by E.S. Dixon) gives another recipe for lemonade that shows it is ready for consumption long before it would have been fermented. It says to put sliced lemons and sugar in a jar, pour boiling water into the jar, and ""let them stand covered until cold"". Then it is ready. A second recipe on the same page is for lemon syrup, ""for making Lemonade immediately"", which ""makes a refreshing draught without the least delay"". 

An 1871 cookbook published in London (*Beeton's Dictionary of Practical Recipes and Every-Day Information* by Samuel Orchart Beeton) gives separate recipes for ""lemonade"" and ""effervescent lemonade"", neither alcoholic, one which is fizzy and one which is not.

During the second half of the 1800s, the temperance movement was growing in both the U.K. and in North America. The November 5, 1870, edition of London's *The Temperance Record* gives further insight in a short story called ""Little Teachers"":

>

An 1885 poem entitled ""Heroin of the Gutter"" published in an issue of London's *Argosy* magazine that year implied that proper lemonade was not fermented:

> ""The Neapolitan, whose trade
>
> Plies brisk on days like this,
>
> Poured the unwilling lemonade
>
> Guiltless of faintest fizz.""

Taken just these sources together, and there are many more, a reasonable conclusion to make is that ""lemonade"" was understood in the U.K. at the time not to be a fizzy, nor fermented drink.

todayilearned,fdcgvcy,t1_fcz9tdy,1578274581.0,"> Why? Alcohol was not mentioned before this and was irrelevant.

You mentioned fermentation. A popular reason to ferment drinks is to make them alcoholic. To perform a thorough search to see if ""lemonade"" was used to refer to fermented drinks back in the 1800s, I searched for both ""fermentation"" and variants on the word, as well as ""alcohol"" and its variants, in case one keyword but not the other appeared in the search results. If I searched for ""fermentation"" but not ""alcoholic"", I may have missed some instances of ""lemonade"" being a fermented drink, but not including ""ferment"" or its variants in the relevant text.

> My assumptions? The fact that fermentation breaks down molecules such as glucose anaerobically and can add a fizz which can vary hugely is not an assumption, it is fact. But in your world things are black and white. Fizz or no fizz. Just because you cant find a source doesnt mean people havent been making a lemon and sugar based drink with a fizz before the 1880s. It's a natural process.

Again, you are making an assumption. I never said that lemonade could not, nor was not, consumed in a fermented or fizzy form. But the evidence I did find was that, when it was consumed this way, it was differentiated from the non-fermented drink, and instead referred to as ""effervescent lemonade"", ""lemon wine"", ""portable lemonade"", and ""potable lemonade"". In all cases, the sources don't necessarily say that it's alcoholic (some say it is, some say it isn't), but in all cases, they are distinguishing it from the non-fermented, or non-fizzy, version of ""lemonade"". The OED in 1908 very specifically separated a fizzy definition coming into recent use with an original non-fizzy version. 

You are making an assumption that just because lemonade *can* become fermented, therefore, writers did not make a distinction between the fermented and non-fermented versions. This is a faulty assumption, since writers of the era clearly referred to the fermented version by a qualified name, i.e., ""effervescent lemonade"", ""portable lemonade"", ""potable lemonade"", and ""lemon wine"". There would be no reason to make the distinction if ""lemonade"" were generally understood to include the fizzy version, but it is not. On the contrary, there is no evidence of definitions such as ""non-potable lemonade"" or ""still lemonade"", or ""flat lemonade"", etc., in that era, indicating ""lemonade"" was generally understood to mean a non-fizzy drink.

politics,fcyh036,t1_fcy87h1,1578079967.0,"Bush was the most cynical president in the history of the presidency. He didn't care about Hispanics. He was just smart enough to recognize their growing numbers in the US and whoever they aligned with politically would have immense electoral power for most of the rest of the century.

He gambled on courting them through a shared racism against Muslims--Hispanics tend to be devout Catholics, after all. If the gamble worked, and Iraq had been a success, he could have courted some Hispanic Republican candidates for office, and his political capital would have allowed the modest immigration reform bill. His thought was, he would make the Democrats look unpatriotic, the Hispanic vote would align with the Republicans, and the Republicans would control politics for decades. 

Of course, this was doomed to fail because his justification in Iraq was flimsy, at best, and people derided it before the war even started. He didn't care, had no strategy, and he totally fucked over the party. The party doubled down on white nationalism and grievance instead, and have instead lost the Hispanic vote for the foreseeable future.

Any kind of ""compassion"" he had for Hispanic people was always rooted in a cynical play for power, not from any real attempt at bettering the community.

Maybe you can give him Africa, but I still don't see how that absolves him of anything, nor does it necessarily mean he wasn't personally racist.

He may have found it to be a cheap and easy way to score some political points in the African-American community, without having to actually challenge Republican orthodoxy on things like criminal justice, the war on drugs, income inequality, etc. While there's no doubt that he did do well in Africa on eradicating AIDS, it's small consolation on pretty much the entirety of the rest of his legacy, which is absolute shit."

Reading comprehension. I never said it did. My response on this matter explicitly stated:

> There is no reference in the definition to it being a fermented **nor** alcoholic drink.

You're trying to reframe the argument that I ever said that fermentation meant only ~~fermentation~~ alcoholic, when if you read carefully, I did not. But I tried to be diligent in searching for historic sources, so I searched for both. 

> Now, your grumbling about sources.

What do you mean ""now""? My very first response referenced both the 1st and 3rd editions of the OED, and when you pulled out some blog post, I gave a further source of an 1887 book on Google Books. There are several others on Google Books from the 1800s I could have linked to, but didn't think it necessary since the point was already proven. You can do the same search yourself and come to the same conclusion.

I was pointing to actual sources from the beginning. It wasn't something I ever backtracked on, bud.

> Oh fuck me, you found the Lemonade Bible?

Ad hominem. If you have a problem with the source, you can search Google Books yourself, but you'll find that there are no sources before the ~1880s that refer to lemonade as either fermented **or** alcoholic. 

Again, as pointed to in my first post, the OED gives about a half dozen instances of lemonade in print between 1664 and 1867, all of which refer to a non-fizzy drink. The 1908 first edition of the OED goes out of its way to say that lemonade being a fizzy drink had only recently come into use. Do you have a source that contradicts the statement made in the OED?

> Look, I've spent enough time on this. I was merely pointing out that these lemonade drinks can be flat (like tea), have a natural fizz due to the sugars being broken down (the same way drinks like Kefir do, yet nobody says those are fizzy or carbonated and kefir been around for thousands of years, it's also not alcoholic), or can be carbonated like soda/pop. You, like so many others on reddit, just want a petty argument. Good bye.

And yet you have provided no proof of this. I was curious about your assumption so I took  10 minutes to actually look it up and found that there is no evidence for it. I'm willing to be proven wrong, but all you've done is prioritized your feelings and assumptions over facts. Just because you found a 21st century blog post for a fizzy lemonade recipe doesn't mean that that's how the word was used in the 19th century or before. I thought maybe it was, but looking through actual sources, all signs point to that not being the case before the ~1880s. 

Sorry you got your feelings hurt, but you are not the first nor will you be the last to spread misinformation based on faulty assumptions because you can't be bothered to do a little bit of research into historical sources. You came to a conclusion, and once that conclusion was challenged, you decided to resort to sarcasm instead of a logical, reasoned argument, or further research to attempt to prove my argument wrong.

Again, I am willing to have my mind changed based on new evidence, but all you've said is ""nuh uh"" without actually pointing to any source that says ""lemonade"" meant a fizzy drink before the 1880s. I've given you a couple, (the 1887 source and the 1908 OED) and if you want to peruse the OED or Google Books yourself, you will find several more. 

Sorry if you think ""research over assumptions"" is petty, but I find the spread of misinformation to be a real problem on the internet, and do what I can to combat it. Even with something as trivial as lemonade, considering it takes minimal effort to actually do a little research to see if those assumptions have any factual basis. In this case, your assumptions appear that they don't."

They practiced religious tolerance from the beginning. There were a few hiccups along the way (the governor Peter Stuyvesant tried to remove some Jewish settlers, but was ordered by his superiors to let them stay), but well before the English took over, there were openly practicing Jews, Muslims, and Christians in the colony and this continued throughout the English period. 

The first Dutch fort in New York predates Plymouth in New England by several years (in 1617, iirc) though the first permanent settlers didn't arrive until a few years after (in 1626).

Pennsylvania, too, had more than a hundred years of religious tolerance before the Constitution was signed. So did Delaware, being part of the Dutch colony from 1655, and then being part of Pennsylvania from the 1680s before splitting off on its own.

The Southern colonies were fairly open to religious tolerance as well, though some did have Anglicanism as an official state religion. It was only in New England that religious affiliation wasn't very open, but even there, it had started to break down by the end of the 1600s, and on some places, like Vermont and Rhode Island, it was fairly open.

todayilearned,fcup3mt,t1_fcufz4t,1577985673.0,"Sure, though that the 1908 OED made a distinction between lemonade and an ""aerated lemonade"",  it would seem that the non-carbonated beverage was what ""lemonade"" originally referred to, otherwise, they wouldn't have described it as ""now"" coming into use to refer to the fizzy drink. There is no reference in the definition to it being a fermented nor alcoholic drink.

For instance, [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA264&dq=Lemonade) is an 1887 book published in London about beverages, and the passage where lemonade is mentioned starts off that the section contains ""a few words"" about ""simple unfermented drinks"". The section following is titled ""Fermented Drinks"" but there is no mention of lemonade from there on out.

Perusing 19th century publications published in England and the UK on Google Books, and searching for ""lemonade"" in conjunction with ""ferment"", ""fermented"", ""alcohol"", or"" alcoholic"", it seems that this version was often qualified as ""potable lemonade"", ""portable lemonade"", or even ""lemon wine"" rather than ""lemonade"" alone. 

Non-alcoholic fizzy, or carbonated, lemonade regularly appears as ""effervescent lemonade"" or ""aerated lemonade"". ""Lemonade"" as a fizzy drink without further explanation doesn't appear until the 1880s, though there are recipes dating to the 1850s that give a suggestion of adding carbonated water to make the lemonade ""effervesce"".

While it was probably in colloquial usage before it showed up in books, it does seem that ""lemonade"" to refer specifically to a fizzy drink didn't come into common usage in British English and other non-North American dialects until the second half of the 1800s. By then, the term had been in use for 200 years, and likely always referring to the (now) ""American style""  of lemonade."
todayilearned,fcucrw1,t1_fcu0pr6,1577977932.0,"Interesting, but it seems this is a somewhat recent phenomenon. According to the Oxford English Dictionary's entry for ""lemonade"", it is defined as:

>  A drink made of lemon-juice and water, sweetened with sugar.
>
> *In England now very commonly applied to ‘aerated lemonade’, which consists of water impregnated with carbonic acid with the addition of lemon-juice and sugar.*

They don't define when ""now"" started, but the term ""lemonade"" dates to 1664 and all the examples they give of the word through 1867 indicate it as a non-carbonated beverage. And that 1867 example is from a book called *Cradle Lands* by Mary Elizabeth Herbert and published in London. But the ""now"" caveat has been in the OED since the first edition was published in 1908, so this split between American English and British English appears to probably have become common sometime in the late 1800s.

So it seems ""lemonade"" was a non-carbonated beverage everywhere in the Anglosphere for at least 200 years before some countries started using it as the name of the carbonated drink in the past ~125 years or so, meaning the American/Canadian usage of the word is the original usage and more historic."

I agree that this does set it apart from It's A Wonderful Life, and Miracle On 34th Street, but those movies were 30+ years old by then and Hollywood had done next to nothing with those tropes since. There were fantasy animation films, like Frosty and Rudolph and the Grinch, but the only one that featured human characters as the main character (Santa aside) that became a classic in that era was A Charlie Brown Christmas, which is famously depressing. 

I agree that the things you mentioned *became* tropes, but Hollywood had moved away from those tropes for thirty years at that point, and they really became much bigger tropes in the late 80s and after.

What really set A Christmas Story apart at the time was that it *was* filled with the Christmas spirit, and not as disappointing as the typical Christmas fare of the time featuring human characters, like Charlie Brown, ""The Homecoming"", ""The House Without A Christmas Tree"", ""The Christmas Mining Disaster in Caufield, U.S.A."", etc.

What ""fancy people having fancy holidays with lavish settings"" Christmas movies were around in 1983? About the only Christmas movie Hollywood had produced for theaters in the thirty years before A Christmas Story came out was the 1970 musical ""Scrooge"" with Albert Finney. 

Most of the feature length Christmas films being produced by Hollywood at the time was made-for-TV, which included several other films set during the Depression featuring poor families, often much poorer than the Christmas Story family (including ""The Waltons"" pilot film, ""An American Christmas Carol"", ""A Christmas  To Remember"", ""A Christmas Memory"", and ""It Happened One Christmas""). Or else, they were contemporary family dramas starring middle class families struggling through the holiday season (like ""The Gathering"", ""The House Without A Christmas Tree"",  ""Home For the Holidays"" starring Sally Field, and ""A Christmas Without Snow"").

The main difference between ""A Christmas Story"" and the other Christmas films coming out around the same time wasn't ""fancy people"" celebrating ""fancy holidays"". It was that it was a light-hearted comedy, rather than the middle-class and lower-class dramas of the time, many which took place in the same era as A Christmas Story did.

Hollywood was also creating made-for-TV Christmas shorts, and many of those became cultural touchstones (like ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and the Rankin-Bass specials) while many more did not (like Yogi Bear's Christmas, or the Pink Panther Christmas). In any case, those were uniformly fantasy/comedy/children's fare, not ""fancy people"" celebrating ""fancy holidays""."

And make the House more proportional while you're at it. Or, do it U.K. or Canada style, where the upper house is responsible for next to nothing, rather than worry too hard about how representative it is of people vs. states.
