if none of those things are palatable for you, you also have the ability to splinter off and play as you see fit with your own format rules.

it's either that or use a card pool that isn't optimized for c/edh.  c/edh uses edh card pools to determine their own play--so either house/lgs/mtgo-rule it out, or start a new format so as not to be constrained by the format that, as a rule, doesn't use flash the way c/edh uses flash."

edh isn't a sanctioned format--there are no lists from which to pull aggregate data.  the whole argument is that since flash isn't a problem at casual tables, nobody will notice its banning--but that's paradoxical if you consider that YOU want it banned in the exact same format.

you have the options in front of you.  either c/edh can split into its own format or it can abide by the banlist that has sway of the fucking stars on it.  it's a 10 mana SORCERY.  you think flash should have the same respect as that nonsense?  it's not even on the same planet.  you're playing pool at a checkers table and upset that *everyone else is doing it wrong*.

there either needs to be an acceptance of the banlist by the c/edh community or they need to splinter off into their own rules--all the while rule 0 exists to circumvent this exact issue.

EDH,ffagrlg,t1_ffagg6r,1579735377.0,"that's not even remotely true.

slippery slope doesn't work here, so don't go yelling that we should just ban everything or nothing.  c/edh is supposed to be a format, by the defniition of this post, as an extension of edh--meaning that it must obey the rules of edh if it's not willing to incorporate its own banlist, and as it stands, edh is healthy.

i could chooose to start my own format, using the same rules as edh, but it woudn't be fair of me to also claim that the edh banlist needs adjusted to suit my whims because one group has a speicific proclivity for building 'artifact only decks'."
