socialskills,femtyct,t1_femrwo2,1579269516.0,"Thank you! I think as we do these things to stay true to ourselves we develop trust in ourselves. The trust I’ve gained in myself since learning how to say no has been the most beautiful form of self-love I never knew existed. 

Like I know I won’t put myself in a situation where I disrespect myself. I know I can stand up for myself. And that is very comforting and has helped my anxiety significantly decrease."
socialskills,femsysf,t3_epxfx2,1579268726.0,"I think you’re in a normal spot that will definitely get easier as you get older and have some more experience with people. 

The better you get at not focusing on what others do, the happier you’ll be. Stop worrying about others, and dive deep into the things you enjoy. As you follow your true passions, people will naturally be drawn to you that you’re compatible with. Like a magnet. 

One tip is to learn to be more assertive. Learn to stop apologizing. Don’t look down. It’s okay if people think you come off as rude or a bitch. You don’t need everyone’s approval. I used to struggle with people-pleasing, overly apologetic, didn’t want to be a bother to anyone. But let me tell you life is so much more liberating being the “bitch” and giving confident “no’s” and not apologizing for uncomfortable silences. Ironically, the more I am like this, the more my anxiety melts away. Standing up for yourself will give you confidence. Be unapologetically YOU. Practice walking with good posture and your eyes up. Practice sitting straight up. Those “power postures” really do have an effect on your view of yourself. Eventually these will bring up your confidence and help you feel safe with yourself and trust yourself.

You may think you’re “strange”, but think how much happier you’d be if you could be strange with other strange people who love you for it, than pretending not to be strange with with people you won over while trying hard not to be strange.

And it’s all practice! Social skills and confidence are just skills that improve the more you practice. Be easy on yourself :) Trust the timing of your life.  Allow for yourself to learn and for things to unfold naturally."
socialskills,femrd0y,t3_epz3ha,1579267399.0,"To your point of saying no: It’s liberating learning how to say no. I’ve come to terms that it’s okay if some people think I’m a bitch. That used to bother me, but now it doesn’t matter because I’m putting myself in the best situations for me. I think it can take a while learning how to be comfortable with the silence to follow a “no” and not apologize. I think we’re used to making up for awkward, uncomfortable silences. But it’s okay to look someone in the eyes and say “no” and not do anything to apologize for the silence to follow. 

As a woman in learning how to deal with men this has been especially liberating. Someone recently asked me for my phone number and I just looked at them and said “no” and didn’t say anything else. Didn’t apologize. I think it made them flustered a little bit, they probably weren’t expecting that but I don’t care, I didn’t want them to have my number haha."
socialskills,femqnwh,t3_epzwpl,1579266785.0,"I like the theory in “The Tipping Point” by Malcolm Gladwell; he says some people are “connectors” in the 6 degrees of separation. Meaning that we each have a few people in our lives that seem to have the most connections. I certainly have a friend like that, she is so social and outgoing that she seems to be connected to everyone, so when she makes asks on social media, she is always flooded with answers and resources. Definitely a benefit for her. It indirectly can benefit me, because if I ask her a question, I have some access to the resources she has access to as well. For example I asked her to let me know if she hears of any rooms for rent in the future, because of the way she is connected she hears about more openings than any of my other friends or me. 

If you want more connections, networking and resources, you need to be in more places to make those connections. Go to office hours if you prefer 1:1. Go to the writing center. Go to the clubs each of your classes offers for that subject. Volunteer and show up early or stay late to talk with the professor or the other odd students who are unsure what to do as well. These will build up if you take the time. Even if you are an introvert and prefer 1 on 1, you can still do this. And along the way you’ll make friends with people who are “connectors” as well."
antidiet,fek9oph,t1_fejzir6,1579195516.0,Thank you for your reply! I’ll look more into intuitive eating. That’s the direction I want to head in. Good for you for figuring out a good spot for you to be in!
antidiet,fejxuo3,t3_eokbfu,1579188325.0,"Was tracking and measuring ever beneficial to you? This is my first lurk in this sub, seeing if there's any information here for me because I'm a little lost. I have a sweets addiction so my intuitive eating feels against me. I am also highly obsessive and territorial with food. I'm not interested in strict dieting, but I'm curious about tracking atm just so I can understand food better. My hopes are that I can shift to more conscious intuitive eating, to generally know what healthier choices look like.

How did you begin to get where you are?

edit: if my question is really not what this sub is about, my bad. I'm just browsing and trying to find some new perspectives and answers."
IWantToLearn,feh7axn,t3_eozzld,1579110640.0,"Tim Ferriss recommends recording yourself talk and listening to it. Maybe this isn’t quite what you mean in terms of help with articulation, but maybe if you hear yourself speak you can get some ideas."
coldshowers,fee239i,t1_fee0fdu,1579024792.0,I like that last sentence. New perspective.
datingoverthirty,fe8fuif,t3_env27f,1578925710.0,"Good for you and I think it’s overall harmless. It’s okay to give things a try and think, okay, next time I’ll try something different. We’re all learning how to be!

In this thread there’s two types of people, the ones who say it was okay and the ones who don’t. So with that guy you also had a 50/50 chance of him being down with the comment or not. But that’s all the fun of putting yourself out there! Stakes were low, you had absolutely nothing to lose. So what if you said something where you think, ah I shouldn’t have said that. You never know when the chances and circumstances will work in your favor. 

What’s important is you listened to your gut. I like to think we are magnets and we attract people into our lives who really vibe with what we’re doing and who we are. So if you won someone’s affection because of a dorky comment you decided to make, you were genuine, and that person will be attracted to who you really are. And that’s beautiful. So move on from this and keep listening to your gut!"

1200isplenty,fe6rt29,t3_ensd58,1578902371.0,"You could look into intermittent fasting, and eat all of your calories in an 8 hour window of the day (or start with 10-12hr window) and fast for the rest. The app Zero has a fasting timer that’s been really good at keeping me accountable.

coldshowers,fdvn5x0,t1_fdju93q,1578749313.0,"I just started this week and what makes me feel like I can't last long is my lungs like go into shock, and I can't breathe. I have a tiny shower so not being able to breathe makes me feel claustrophobic. I'm going to try breathing exercises before and really focus on controlling my breath, so I would advise that."
coldshowers,fdvm5ft,t3_elkb75,1578748905.0,"Noob here, I've only done 3 ""cold showers"" (15 seconds cold at the end of my shower is barely all I can stand).

Are you turning the water on the complete coldest setting? Are you doing any prior breathing exercises?

I think I am going to try some breathing exercises beforehand. My shower is small, and when I turn on the cold, it gets really hard to breathe and I can't stand the claustrophobia of not being able to breathe in my tiny shower. 

Any thoughts for a beginner in the first week?"
getdisciplined,fdvif03,t3_emx1qs,1578747729.0,"This isn't really advice to offer, rather my experience in finding a new type of self-love for myself that I never knew existed. When I was in my early 20s I had really bad social anxiety and anxiety in general. I also really struggled with anxiety with men as I was starting to understand the world a little better. In all of these situations, I was never confident in saying no to things I was uncomfortable with, never knew how to get myself out of an uncomfortable situation, and also didn't know how to read situations to not get myself in uncomfortable situations in the first place.

It's taken a few years and practice in standing up for myself in situations that made me uncomfortable. I am currently solo traveling and I had the realization recently, that I can take myself anywhere, and trust that I will be okay. I trust myself. That right there is the self-love that I didn't know could exist. It's like I know I can go anywhere, be anywhere, be with anyone, and I am held in a secure, safe hug from myself. I am safe in myself. I've learned how to stand up for myself and speak up for myself. I don't let people treat me poorly. So I never need to worry. I trust myself that if things get weird for me, I know how to get myself out.

I don't have those social or general anxieties anymore. I actually didn't know how bad my anxiety was until I was anxiety-free. At the time I didn't think I was an anxious person. A lot of this just took some time, maturation, understanding how the world works a bit better. But knowing I can always trust myself and be safe with myself is the most comforting thing I've experienced with my mind.

Maybe this doesn't really apply to you at all, but I just wanted to share because it's been on my mind lately, and is a different angle to look at self-love with. And if you do relate, I'd be happy to elaborate more."

getdisciplined,fcx2jr4,t3_dy9xea,1578048390.0,"I thought this post was excellent and really resonated with some of my personal issues. I think it's important to develop a system that works for you. I don't know why people are knocking the system you've developed for yourself. 

I'm starting to realize I really lack in having my own system that I can stick to, particularly right now. Lately it's really shown because I'm in an environment where I don't have many responsibilities during the week, and I've noticed I get really obsessive about food during those times. Turns into lots of negative feedback loops. So I'm trying to develop my own strict system right now. I particularly like how you frame ""rituals""."

NonZeroDay,fck3h48,t3_eheiiz,1577715469.0,"I was just journaling about this same problem this morning. On my “free” days I get stuck and then nothing happens. 

These are some things I was pondering after reading some other threads:
 
Success compounds success. Feedback loops play a role in your day. So I think the more positive things you can do early on in your day will be a positive feedback loop to make more small accomplishments, and now you have some momentum to go forward. Having a solid morning routine might help kick start this, #1 being Make Your Bed. I too often get caught in negative feedback loops on my days off and get nothing done. 

I also seem to be more successful when I’ve planned my day out the night before. Make a list. And for example, if I want to go to the gym after breakfast, then lay out my workout clothes the night before. In the morning get right into my gym clothes when I wake up and have breakfast. Then since I’m already in my clothes, I feel ready to go. 

Hopefully one idea resonates with you. It’s probably all about finding the bit of advice that really makes sense for you and you feel ready to respond to."
LandscapeArchitecture,fch6tcw,t3_ds0ki8,1577647785.0,"I was just looking into this for Germany! After a quick search, they have international landscape architecture programs, 1,500 euros a year, 1.5 year program. I am really new to all of this and have been doing quick searches, but I am definitely going to dig deeper into this option. No way am I doing an expensive Master's in the US."
solotravel,fc5lctd,t1_fc5kc12,1577460674.0,"Maybe start with looking into the Hangout feature on Couchsurfing! I've only used it a bit so I'm not an expert, but I think for example you could make a group like ""going to visit X today, can offer 3 seats"" if you wanted to take some travelers somewhere. But I think there are a lot of ways you could participate in meeting up with travelers without actually hosting them. Maybe you could have some over for dinner or something or visit one of your best-kept secrets. I'm pretty new to it so I'm not sure, but I think there could be a lot of ways to go about it. 

I met a traveler recently who did the most clever thing. He had his birthday while traveling, and he made a Hangouts event for his bday and invited a ton of random people, and told people to meet at some bar. He brought name tags and pens, so everyone wrote their name and where they are from. He said that like 20 people showed up throughout the night (people he's never met), and they ended up bar hoping and stayed out until like 4 am. Sounded so fun haha."
solotravel,fc5k8se,t3_efxlli,1577459853.0,"Just an idea, if you plan on using Couchsurfing during your travels, maybe on your day (?) off, you could host some travelers, or use Couchsurfing Hangouts in your town to meet up with people. This could help you build your profile from reviews so that you might be accepted more easily when you go to make your own stay requests. Also maybe from the people you meet you will make some connections, and will have people to visit when the time does come for you to travel! If you do meet some interesting people, they might even have some advice for you on places to visit that will help you out on your future travels!

And as someone else mentioned, maybe during your down time at work, you can focus on learning a language! I am currently loving the YouTube channel ""Why Not Spanish"" to help me learn Spanish. Good luck and hang in there!"
