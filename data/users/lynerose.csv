AskReddit,fe0gxs0,t3_eng8y5,1578813272.0,"Double protection, he wears a condom and she is either on a form of medical birth control (make sure it's been  least a week on the medication) or get a none medical like a sponge or foam, these can be found in the same aisle as the condoms.  This will give you both peace of mind down the road.    

Sex should NOT hurt.  If it hurts stop, the myth of the hymen needing to be ripped is crap.  If she isn't ready then yes its gonna hurt, move slow allow for the vaginal walls to expand and relax.  This one is probably gonna be the hardest because all you want to do is go for it.  Your partner will appreciate the care you take.

Finally after sex when you just want to pass out you still need to clean up.  It's important to go pee after sex especially for women this helps remove the risk of UTIs.  A warm wash cloth to clean up any spills will also help.  Not the sexiest thing to think about but practical and healthy.

One more note have fun. Laugh when you mess up putting on the condom first time, bump noses, or you elbow the other ones head while switching positions.  It happens, this is real life not a porn where it's all scripted so just enjoy eachother. This really is one of the greatest ways to connect to someone you love."

The diamonds amounts seem small but they add up.  

Other ways - Once a week your daily long on will give you 50 to 150 diamonds - voting in the Starry Corridor will give diamonds, honor points, gold, or star coins every 10 votes.  You get 30 votes and they do recharge but slowly.  You will get diamonds for participating in Stylist arena and Competition.  

Have fun and good luck!"

Both junior college and the university I attended made it clear that any student could call the campus police and be escorted to their car or dorm.

legaladvice,fcpoqr8,t3_eig17o,1577868869.0,"In regards to how he got the photo or knows about it,  if your phone is part of a family plan he could have parental controls in place so that any photo you take sends a copy to him, same with chats.  The creepier ideas the guy you were talking to sent it to him or your dad has at least one camera in your room to monitor you.   

No matter what your dad has more to lose in this situation than you.  Posession of child porn, extortion, if he has sent that photo anywhere it distribution of child porn.  He is counting on your shame and fear to keep you silent and obedient.  You did something you regret not something shameful.  The shame is on him for attempting to weaponize it against you."

You can add chicken to the stew and put it all in a crockpot so less fuss with your heavy school work load. I ate a lot of it in college.  And good luck in Nursing!!"
