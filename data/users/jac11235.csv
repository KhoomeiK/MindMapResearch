LateStageCapitalism,ff8bik9,t1_ff89xvi,1579671898.0,"It literally couldn’t matter less what homeless people behave like. The whole point of this thread and the tweet is that homelessness is a systemic problem that is not even addressed, let alone has a hope of being fixed by policies that just make life more difficult for the homeless like forced bussing or those spike things or being kicked out of the subway. The bottom line is if you have a problem with homeless people you have to do something about homelessness, not the homeless themselves."

1) something doesn’t have to be a law in your jurisdiction for you to make a moral judgment on it. For example, it’s pretty widely accepted that people shouldn’t have to have their personal data, which was collected incidentally to doing business with Walmart, sold without their consent. Just because Alabama hasn’t codified this into law yet doesn’t mean I can’t say it’s wrong to do so. 

2) companies can be held accountable for doing legal but immoral things. It’s way past time to stop with this, “well they’re a corporation and making money is what they are supposed to do so you can’t fault them for using your data for profit.” Yes I can fault them and I do. Walmart’s motivation for profit does not exclude them from the obligation to act morally in the society that allows them to exist and I can totally crap on them for choosing profit over doing the right thing, especially if another huge company is doing the right thing."

When the US was founded it was much more similar to the European Union (that is a loose collection of mostly sovereign states that share a strong economic bond) than to a single nation and the senate was expressly designed to appease the smaller of those sovereign states that they wouldn’t be overrun by the larger ones. It was a way to get them to join the union, the interests of the citizens of those states never really came into the picture.

Even if that was the original intent, it doesn’t work that way in practice. In fact the electoral college has created a system where the smallest states get almost no political considerations where as a couple of the swing states that dominate the political landscape are very populous. Florida for instance has 20 million people and is the third largest state, even more people than New York, which is commonly thrown around as one of those giants who will totally silence all those poor rural voters and the electoral college is what makes politicians favor Floridian voters over those rural peeps or even a populous but non swing state like California or Texas. 


https://theweek.com/articles-amp/840362/electoral-college-doesnt-benefit-small-states-what-does-even-dumber


And lastly, why should less populous states be weighted more? What about being a rural area means your individual vote should matter more than anyone else’s? Why in the good gosh golly should I care 4 times more what a Wisconsinite has to say than a Californian? Why should the interests of the small states matter so much that it is worth cutting the vote of another American in half or worse?"
