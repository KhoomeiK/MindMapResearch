bipolar,ffkzagf,t1_ffj2udz,1580031896.0,Sigh.. Where I come from there is no such thing as a therapist skilled in bipolar disorder.
bipolar,ffkyr0v,t3_eu3fqp,1580031555.0,"Wow, that sounds serious. I don't think we are the right people to tell you what is what. Would be better for you to consult your psychologist."
bipolar,ffky8jb,t3_eu16xy,1580031180.0,"Hate is a pretty strong word. Hmm.. Maybe we may come off as inconsiderate or apathetic, making us less likeable. Anyway, to answer your question: no, I don't feel that way. I do feel very misunderstood tho."
bipolar,ffkglot,t3_etgakc,1580022424.0,"Unpopular opinion: I feel sorry for him. For us, depression and suicide is somewhat common. For him, a healthy person, to experience depression and suicidal tendencies, he must have been in a very dark place.

Buttttt... Him being an ass to you is unacceptable. I think we don't really have a choice: we have to cherry pick the people in our lives."
bipolar,ffj0p9u,t1_ffh6qs2,1579987446.0,Lol.. Sounds familiar
bipolar,ffgux65,t1_fffbxk0,1579915694.0,All the best.
bipolar,fff4i4e,t1_fff2964,1579875484.0,"Good. It is not easy, but keep it up. It'll pay off!"
bipolar,fff1km4,t3_eta1bj,1579873173.0,Really? Hmm.. Maybe parts of Reddit are not too wholesome. Stay away from the subreddits that are toxic. And please don't kill yourself. I mean go ahead and feel lousy and what not but no killing okay? The only thing you can kill is time.
bipolar,fff0q61,t3_et7vfl,1579872463.0,"Are you tracking your moods? You can use a mood tracking app for it. If you can consistently track your mood, you will be able to see a pattern in the charts. You can have your doctor look at the charts / data too."
bipolar,ffez3sb,t3_et7si3,1579871000.0,"Woot! Welcome to da parteh! Pro tip: If you start feeling better, DO NOT believe yourself when you tell yourself you don't need medication anymore. Let your doctor make that decision.

Edit: Another pro tip: Community support a.k.a r/bipolar is a real game changer. Plenty of good folks here."
bipolar,ffey9l0,t3_et9zas,1579870203.0,You made me smile. Thanks!
family,ffexpb8,t1_ffe7p5q,1579869651.0,"Really? I'll check that out. Communication promoting questions, that's a first for me. Thanks."
bipolar,ffctgbc,t3_esqhrr,1579806910.0,Did you manage to get an alternative? Hope you are alright.
family,ffcrgdb,t1_ffc13yh,1579805731.0,"I see where you are coming from. It is a viable solution, but not at this point in time due to my own finances. Thanks anyway."
family,ffcpvci,t1_ffc0wsd,1579804699.0,That's a good idea. Thanks.
bipolar,ffb52p9,t3_esik2z,1579752006.0,"Glad to hear you are feeling better. I'd say our backgrounds are all too similar. Trauma, abuse, bad relationships, ruminations, poor health, type 2 bipolar, insomnia since childhood. Basically everything you wrote, except for hallucinations. Even how you feel after you started Lamictal is the same as my own experience since I started taking Lithium. Unfortunately I am getting terrible side effects so I will have to change my meds. Ah well.. Can't win em all I say."
bipolar,ff4fayu,t1_ff49ppq,1579562236.0,Ooh la la. Paint me like one of your French girls.
bipolar,ff4ezcw,t1_ff2w2f3,1579562020.0,"True. I guess it's a rite of passage then. That said, welcome to the bipolar club. It's unpleasant, but at least you are not alone."
bipolar,ff2wg5n,t3_ercnm1,1579526732.0,"A bag of chips, a rocking song and about five hours? Yeah, sounds about right."
bipolar,ff2vvdm,t3_er14q5,1579526140.0,I like how your post sounds like what I'd write during mania.
bipolar,ff2vm0z,t3_erblpu,1579525869.0,Spill away! And good job on the sobriety.
bipolar,ff2us7l,t1_ff2sjoy,1579524986.0,"Just wanted to add, weed and alcohol are depressants. The bane of every bipolar person. I too learned this the hard way. I really think pdocs need to start giving their new patients a heads up."
bipolar,feviud5,t1_fes8mxn,1579397923.0,"Yes, I have so much to be grateful for in this forum. Guess I ought to extend it beyond the forums. I should try. Thanks!"
bipolar,fevhriv,t1_fev2mxx,1579397619.0,"Thanks for the kind words.

Actually, I have come to conclude that those who are not bipolar will never understand it. The same way we will never understand cancer or autism, and I pray the need to understand either will never arise. 

Ah well, just my two cents. You have a great night too!"
bipolar,fevgewi,t1_feuddsh,1579397064.0,Glad to help. All the best with the meds yeah!
bipolar,fevf80a,t1_fes9kal,1579396703.0,"I will this keep this in mind because personally there is room for growth in those two departments. Thanks!

I grew up with minimal guidance from my parents. Your kids sure are fortunate to have you for a parent."
bipolar,fes4814,t1_fes0619,1579361238.0,You are welcome.
FinalFantasyXII,fdty6qk,t1_fdt871z,1578724164.0,"Not sure about that, I get all my games from Steam and a handful from GoG. I guess if you want your money to go entirely towards SE, your best bet is to buy from SE directly. No idea if the SE store has seasonal discounts like Steam tho."
bipolar,fdsp49a,t3_emwy5u,1578706124.0,Congrats!
FinalFantasyXII,fdsckyn,t1_fdqlecc,1578699529.0,"Glad to help. 

Anyway, you sound pretty sincere about wanting to support the gaming industry despite your income. The Steam sales is a great way to do that. I bought FFXII TZA at 50% off. Just food for thought."
FinalFantasyXII,fdq7i9b,t3_emmukp,1578658143.0,"Try [this](https://youtu.be/5Fb1v9lE5p8)? Worked for me on Steam, not sure if it matters."
bipolar,fdpp7jv,t3_emc0k5,1578635366.0,"Some days I feel a shroud of self-doubt and beat myself up for being bipolar. Today is one of those days, and reading your post really put things into perspective for me. Thanks."
bipolar,fdphofj,t1_fdpg37r,1578628901.0,Mucking up makes us human. All the best!
bipolar,fdpfin8,t3_emioyi,1578627292.0,Thanks for sharing. It's a good reminder for all of us.
bipolar,fdkev30,t1_fdkelle,1578502384.0,"Wow, kudos to you. Definitely a good thing. Keep it up!"
bipolar,fdk92wx,t1_fdk1w6v,1578498853.0,"I like that you can LOL at the end of your story. The last time I LOL-ed at a story like that I was berated for it.

We are? Hmm.. I'll take your word for it. That'll keep my hopes up for another 5 years."
bipolar,fdjtmel,t1_fdjq1kg,1578487062.0,"This subreddit is my support network. I have given up on trying to explain myself to people who are not bipolar. Even my healthcare providers are unable to empathise. I guess it is a very personal experience. Anyway, I'm glad that your brother knows. One is better than none, I say!"
bipolar,fdjoa3c,t1_fdjnulz,1578480603.0,"Thanks for the positive vibes. I do feel like I was a tad pessimistic by accident. Anyway, that sheer will you mentioned, is enough to move mountains. I know that for a fact :)"
sociology,fdfyam8,t3_ei8yr6,1578373615.0,"You can self study any subject under the sun, but as per top commenter, self study is not a substitute for formal education. I guess there is no harm in self study if you understand that at the end of the day you are a layman.

I'm a layman myself, and have just recently taken an interest in sociology. Out of curiosity, why do you want to study sociology?"
bipolar,fdfuaq4,t1_fdfstx1,1578370400.0,"That's good to hear. Also, keep an eye out for possible hiccups like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/ekwp8v/is_it_possible_to_beat_this/) where you feel better and think that you don't need medication."
bipolar,fdfrizr,t3_el59ic,1578368447.0,"Speaking from experience, bipolar anxiety/depression/mania cannot be rationalised. Your best bet is probably finding the right medication, right dosage, and right frequency of intake. Then again, bipolar is different for everyone due to the differences in environment, culture, healthcare, etc. Whatever it is, I hope you find something that works for you."
psychology,fdfp25z,t3_el4jdk,1578366810.0,"Didn't read the article in its entirety, but I reckon an exception to this is journalling on a phone first thing in the morning (with notifications from social platforms turned off)."
FinalFantasyVII,fa9osqq,t1_fa9i1pl,1575883824.0,"Shucks, was hoping there'd be a way to win GP from betting on Chocobos on disc 1. Guess it's just not practical."
