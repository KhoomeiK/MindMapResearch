udub,fexn6s1,t3_eqtrt6,1579433572.0,"I mean logically speaking its very expensive but its standard among UW’s peer institutions. Every big public university housing price is near that of UW. I definitely think its way more expensive then it has to be but its kinda wrong to compare prices of square feet. After all you get much more amenities at UW then apartments (have u seen the mill and stuff? They legit have hundred of thousand of dollars in machines). And the biggest thing is this, the buildings are all on campus on prime time land. UW is having a crunch in land and its kind of hard to really expand the campus outward due to cost as well as increasing distance travel for students. So using the land that is close to the center of uw classes is pretty expensive which makes it reasonable for UW to charge a high fee. I definitely agree that prices are expensive, but this is pretty universal amongst many other institutions. This might not be reliable but with a quick search “Students at public schools can expect to pay an average of $8,887.” I think the issue lies behind the sheer amount of work study and jobs HFS commits to, the new buildings ofc, and the sheer amount of amenities you kind of take for granted (although some is through SAF and other funding). I think more people should actually go to the meetings and see whats going on cuz i assume most of us including me don’t have a clue. If i trust HFS to be faithful, as a nonprofit I would assume the high prices must be caused by something. What that something is, i don’t know."
college,fexcujt,t1_feqzzbi,1579428821.0,Some professors like mine are absolutely not allowed to receive cash value of ... and more. Mine restricts to $35 and i think if he follows the rule he will end up giving it to the university. If not then its okay but i would double check.

udub,fek82pw,t1_fek3m7s,1579194563.0,"Uw system is very weird. I learned im actually in the perfect sweet spot of financial aid where my efc aligns perfectly to maximize all grants. They didn’t even offer me any lons this year, only grants. They offer grant aid on a stepped level where a certain threshold u get this much grant aid from what it appears."
udub,fejasw3,t1_fej8zz9,1579164621.0,"Its actually because the sheer amount of training and work study HFS commits money to which causes prices to be expensive. I don’t think the fact that the university owns it as a non profit is bad, because the government is hands off outside of restaurant regulations and rules + funding UW tuition."
udub,fej987z,t3_epei1i,1579162419.0,In resident and on campus? Expect small loans at 24k efc and COA at ~27k. Fin aid will be capped off till total amount of resources (EFC+fin aid) = COA. Double check net cost estomator as its very accurate to data for this year’s fin aid 2019-2020.
udub,fej95k3,t1_fej7g9d,1579162319.0,"EFC = 54,000. You still got financial aid? Hm im smell some exaggeration or some straight bullshit because the EFC is actually well representative of how much people can pay imo. Either you were OOS and that’s your fault, or you’re just dumb. Because either you fucked your own fasfa without double checking it which btw is used in EVERY SINGLE US universities (other they use a optional collegeboard’s system CSS profile IN addition to the fasfa) (CSS aims towards specifically finding out how much NON federal aid they should give you via extra information). All federal loans, grants are determined solely by your EFC. For millions it has worked fine and the complaint about the cost should be vented towards the rising cost of universities instead of the well designed system to calculate expected contribution. If people had issue then GO to the fin aid office like they exist for. Complaining about your supposed wronged EFC and not doing anything despite from what you claim to make it as a government robbing system is bs. All i hear is the complaint of someone who is angry from making so much money. Hint: a quick look at a EFC income chart proves your overexaggeration (or alternaticely a net cost estimate or a efc estimate by uw, the government, or any other university) shows that most people dont have ultra high efcs at 75k. In fact, most of people with families income of 75k have efc of 10k which while still expensive, is relatively affordable considering the investment in education. So to finish it off, it really sucks to be rich enough to have a efc of 54k, the equivalence of $220,000 income for one child. I too wish I was suffering from success because your well determined cost helps support those who dont even have a EFC above $0 in the first place."
udub,feg940e,t3_ep062w,1579082976.0,"If you absolutely don’t believe you can pass calculus and you prefer other non calc needed majors then why not? Go for something you enjoy studying and dont lose a limb in calc for it. But if you still are hopeful for a calc required major then its up to u tbh to put in the effort and get the help needed. Math isnt for everyone obviously, however to some degree the resources available should help at least get you over a passing standard."
udub,feg3v8p,t3_eoza0b,1579075736.0,Nobody knows tbh. No point in asking people who arent on the admission committee
udub,fe6kcss,t3_enygcb,1578893750.0,"I feel like for the most part its actually very open and non elitist. I mean most of the students here come from a diverse array of backgrounds. There are so many resources open for people at stake of disadvantages. Its just that most people don’t know or use them. I guess the only thing is the small glee of flex with CS, engineering, premed, and basicaly all the stem majors. However, in reality i think many of the people in competitive majors are genuinely good people, just as i expect of most people here. Although if you touch a sore spot about the ranking or major yeah you’ll get flexed on but its definitely gotta be the pride of being inside some of the best affordable programs (at least to residents) here. Its just a bit unfortunate that the system does tend to cater towards those of higher socioeconomic status (better highschools + resources) with the new ramped up DTC/DA system. But i guess if its a partial sacrifice uw is willing to make then oof."

udub,fdf2r7x,t3_el1l58,1578351981.0,"Maybe same controversial opinion but I don’t think so because you can think of it as a property. For many people it would help if u weren’t in the class as they actually want to learn it compared to you who isnt attending lectures. However, at the same time no matter how you use it, you are the rightful owner paying tuition (which funds the class you are taking) and are entitled to take the class the way you want to since you are after all rightfully registered for it.  Because somebody wants the class so badly does not mean u should feel the obligatory guilt of not maximizing your learning/performance to the best you can. If this was the case then the more extreme thought would be that people who are all below 3.0s should be replaced by students who were waitlisted but denied (due to space restraints) who could potentially perform better. Its kinda far stretched but should these stufents feel guilty because they arent doing as good as other students? No thats dumb af. So while i dont think u should feel bad if its a pre req or something important, u should if you aint learning anything and absolutely dont need it. Then it would prop the question why are you even in the class in the first place which i would assume to be for no reason then or at the very best, a small one. Im open to any other thoughts"

udub,fcwviq6,t1_fcw0dc6,1578039365.0,"UW changed their fin aid system a lot this year, i think this year particularly they had boundless grant aid to give. You can estimate how much you would have gotten based on the actual 2019 year by using uw’s fin aid estimate. It changes each year but try it to get a feel of the ballpark"

college,fcq3syo,t3_ei89ft,1577878113.0,"Here’s my take on it. You’re discouraged by a stain on your academic record that isnt actually all the scary as most people think. Freshmen year gpas matter, don’t get me wrong but people overestimate how much it matters. Freshmen year is seen more as acclimating every student to the college life, nobody is equal and people come from different backgrounds and deal with different issues. Not everyone does as happily as everyone wants to do, schools understand that and while its seen like a stain to discourage unproductive academic behavior, in reality, schools are very receptive of students who can resurrect sophomore year with high gpa and academic achievements. Your culmative gpa might take a fat hit but If you can get into your major (some schools like mine are based on competitive major applications), your acceptance to graduate school will focus more on your major gpa (afterall graduate school is for your major) and your research experience. Now the biggest issue is getting research experience, its harder with a lower gpa but if ur interested in graduate school, start now. Once u get the first position the other positions begin to line up easier."

udub,fch45wi,t1_fcg7ew6,1577647118.0,"Do you not know what impacted molars are LOL. If you dont catch them early and they erupt sideways they will hurt and destroy your teeth. Plus if they erupt in the wrong way they can just straight up lead to pure tooth decay because a partial eruption in the jawline that’s too far away can make it hard to brush and a sweet spot for plaque and food to accumulate. Bless my denist for recommending me I should check it out, fucking antidentist andy vs 8 years of education lmaooooooooooooo. Also my insurance covered most of it and it wasnt even a big procedure surprise surprise lel. Enjoy your dentures im out"
udub,fccu9wm,t1_fccmju4,1577602709.0,"People who brush with automatic toothbrushes and floss daily still succumb to cavities. Good insurance usually covers most of the cost for getting a good dental cleaning so just do it. Plus its so common to get dental cleanings that most of the time you wont need anything because of the dental cleanings themselves. I wouldn’t have known I had four impacted molars I need to remove without my daily checkups and thanks to that, my entire row of teeth aren’t messed up. Do people not realize sometimes your toothbrush just cant get all the plaque out from under your gums and teeth? 8 years of studying how to keep your teeth clean vs antidentist andy lmaoooooooo. Pull up the signs at george washington statue with your anti dentist posters."
college,fc4hub2,t3_eg2jks,1577417088.0,"Be honest with you parents. Lay out your case that sports isnt your focus in life. You are focusing on your future workplace and career when you graduate and being in sports is a detriment to your future. The time spent can be better used excelling even further academically or joining clubs, doing research, internships that are meaningful to your future that you would actually enjoy (and definitely in reach). You’re exceptionally hardworking and a great student to be succeeding this well but as always, something that is always an overreach can turn catastrophic in no time. If you were to burn out, not only would your future career be at risk but I assume since you dont intend to continue into your sport as a pro player that path would fail too since its notoriously hard, time-consuming, and often low paying (for most people). If it’s not something you’re focusing on I would honestly be blunt with your parents. It’s life and while how you break it out and make your case differs per situation, its obvious in some way or shape your parents have to accept that. Best of wishes"
