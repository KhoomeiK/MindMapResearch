AdviceAnimals,fdd1kjw,t1_fdd0xr7,1578291144.0,"Im a server. My entire family works in restaurants. 

The businesses wouldnt be able to retain the best servers by paying the wage vs tipping culture. The best servers in a restaurant make $30ish an hour. The worst $10-14 an hour. Because most good servers make their best money from regulars who are above average tippers. Table loves server A, orders $20 in food and tips $10 direct to server. Switch to no tipping and its $25 for food, no tip. The restaurant as a whole (server/restaurant loses $5) and guess who loses most? The server. 

If you go to a restaurant and the person make you feel like they wish you werent there would it be a good situatuon? Or they dont smile, dont try to clarify, or do anything proactive. You dont mind that? If I'm out with people and enjoying a meal a shitty server always affects our meal. Because an hourly server is hoping no one comes in cause they get paid same for 1 or 4 tables. 

But serving means that if a boss is a dick, its super easy to find another and make cash (tips) the next day instead of waiting for paychecks. Our own built in defense is ability to leave and make cash next day at different place. 

Servers love tips. I've never met a person who wished for a ""hourly wage"" as a server unless it was $20+ which isnt feasible. And it means hiring gets harder. When starting pay is $20ish an hour, you cant afford to hire anyone who cant instantly produce."
AdviceAnimals,fdd0y7r,t1_fdd0q8z,1578290479.0,"When I say performance its really three fold. Bad service, generally decent service, great service. An example is my table wanting to try xyz but settling on ABC. What do I do? I get them an order of xyz on the house since they wanted to try it. Don't charge for it of course. 

When a server does that, or similar, I feel gets 20-30% more than I tip most servers. Same with bartenders who take the time to make a fresh bloody mary for me."
AdviceAnimals,fdd0lvh,t1_fdd0dd1,1578290101.0,"Well yes. Because a server doesnt know what tip they get till after service. So stiffing a server wont affect their performance until next time they remember you. Tell a server I plan to tip you 30% vs. I plan to tip you 0% at beginning of the meal and tell me about their performance. Maybe highest tips, but the three biggest earners at my restaurant are 2 guys (me included) and 1 lady in her 50s. Yes pretty girls prob do better, but it all averages out."

AdviceAnimals,fdd02w8,t1_fdcylk9,1578289572.0,"Thats what I find so weird. It's better for servers, its better for restaurants, its actually better for customers. The tipping culture is an overall good thing. Did the server do a good job, tip good. If they did bad, tip bad, if they did really well, tip well. It really is that easy. 

Because the truth is servers (I am one) really love tipping culture. Without it I'd simply go back to sales or promotions. Because paid via restaurant as hourly wage will reduce server income by half. That means the best leave and it will become people who will take the minimum wage possible. 

Race to the bottom."

AdviceAnimals,fdczjjy,t1_fdcva3m,1578289056.0,Whats the difference between putting it in your hands or simply adding 20% to all prices. Its not like they are going to remove tipping and keep same prices. The question is do you want your server to do a great job or just do their job. Tips allow for performance based pay so instead of doing simply whats required to not get fired most servers go above and beyond in an attempt to get 20%+.
