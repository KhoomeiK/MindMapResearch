1. This one wasn't me personally, it was my boss, but a woman had bedazzled her own vagina at home. As one can imagine this got hideously infected, so she came to the pharmacy to see what she could put on it. Drops pants and undies right in my boss's face, putting him way closer to that disgusting infected (but very shiny) mess than anyone should ever be.
2. Guy that came in with pinkeye and proceeded to touch everything and got offended, saying that I was infringing on his rights when I was disinfecting everything. Normally I at least try to give patients a little dignity but we had other customers to serve and if everyone got pinkeye from this guy it would have looked really bad on us.
3. I had a woman who refused to believe that she didn't have refills on her medicines. I explained to her that the last person to prescribe those medicines was a doctor from the local hospital upon discharge, and that he wouldn't refill them. I advised her to call her PCP for an appointment to discuss the medications and they would likely call them in for her. Well, she decided that I, personally, was withholding her life-saving medications from her and started calling me various invectives and very impolite names. She is no longer allowed to speak with technicians.
4. Had a woman call in because she talked to 'that girl' who said that she would put the patient's meds out for delivery. I said it didn't look like that had been done but I would take care of it and mark it a priority so our driver would take it out first thing, given she had been told it would go out that night. I severely doubt anyone actually talked to her. But she wouldn't let me off the phone - she kept trying to get me to throw one of my other female techs under the bus, trying to get me to give her names, and I told her something along the lines of ""ma'am, I am not going to aid you in trying to witch hunt one of my colleagues!"" and she hung up on me. Worst part? She's a relative of an employee of the pharmacy...

pharmacy,fe001fi,t3_engkpw,1578799825.0,"Yes!! I haven't worked with a whole bunch of systems but Pioneer is absolutely my favorite.

Let's see here, tips and tricks:

* Learn the keyboard shortcuts, they will save your freaking life.
* Learn what each prescription color background means (green=fillable, blue=oh hold, yellow=too early to fill, etc.).
* Take the time to familiarize yourself with all the information presented to you on the patient's profile. There is a LOT of information in a lot of little boxes and I know some of my coworkers got overwhelmed by everything that got thrown in their face when they looked up a patient.
* When you pull up a profile (which shows scripts), there's a further button you can click on to access the patient's demographics, insurance info, etc., and there are tons of fields to put notes in, and you can change color/size/highlight which can be important for patients who have caregivers, are always delivery, need brand only meds, are troublemakers. The notes will come up through the fill process and can be incredibly helpful reminders on what needs done with medications.
* There's also buttons to add notes, highlights, and markings to the image of your script, which I love for making extra bold notes about earliest fill days on CIIs.

Honestly, it's a great system, but it can be complex at times. Don't try to learn every function in one day. Take notes, write down how to access certain functions, keep 'em around until they become second nature. I've never used computerRx so I don't know how many of the same functions it might have, so I hope I haven't given you any redundant information. Hope this helps a little!"

pharmacy,fcr1b70,t1_fcq4e2z,1577895309.0,"You know, with two comments questioning that, I'm starting to think that perhaps it's a local thing? Every GP I've been to refuses to diagnose flu without at least the rapid test. I've personally gone through three or so GPs before settling at where I am now (retirement, career changes, utter incompetency) and all of them would get out all those rapid swab tests if I went in with certain symptoms. Maybe for the insurance payment? Not sure, but this has been a consistent practice at local offices."
aww,fcpbcdz,t3_eiedb5,1577857030.0,Oh what a sweet little guy! I feel like a huge meanie for giggling at his wobbles. I love there at the end where he flops because of his legs and he just has that 'I absolutely meant to do that on purpose' face. What a wonderful kitty.
cats,fcp8p03,t3_eie0al,1577854229.0,"Okay, hopefully some of this advice might help.

1. Cats don't like their food, water, and litter right in the same place. I would encourage you to set the food and water outside the bathroom so he kind of has to leave his 'territory' to get to them.

2. Try not to be around his bowls when he's eating because he might be resource-defensive.

3. Learn how to approach him and what his body language means. Jackson Galaxy has tons of wonderful educational material on learning how to understand your kitty.

4. Does he have toys? He might have excess energy pent up and not much to release it with. I would recommend a wand toy, because you can interact with him without getting too close and making him skittish.

5. I have not used the product myself, but Feliway diffusers are supposed to be super good at lowering feline anxiety and aggression and their stress levels.

6. Get established with a vet in your community and take him for a checkup. When you have a vet-pet-owner relationship, you have more access to professional advice and treatment as needed. Especially if he isn't neutered, that can increase aggression too.

I hope some of this helps you and your little guy develop a better relationship!"
pharmacy,fcp0cpv,t1_fcoy29u,1577846614.0,"[There absolutely are tests](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/testing.htm) that need to be done to diagnose actual influenza. If you don't do one of those tests, you can't say with certainty that a patient has influenza.

And yes, prescribers will order Tamiflu for family members so they don't get sick, but that would accompany a prescription for the family member that actually has influenza.

None of what you said is relevant to the actual topic at hand, meaning *dentists prescribing Tamiflu*. Dentists don't possess those diagnostic tests in their office nor is it within their purview to provide a script for an antiviral drug for a non-dental reason."
cats,fcolctd,t3_ei7ums,1577835135.0,"What a lovely little girl! Precious enough to steal my heart for sure. There's nothing quite like the first time you hold your kitten and bring them home and see this tiny creature start to carve out her place in your home. I'll never forget how in awe I was when I brought my first kitten home, she was a little bitty ginger thing who loved to scream her head off.

There's a lot of great advice in the comments and I'm not sure I have anything really to add in that department - everything I would say has already been said. Good luck with your little lady!"
cats,fcok4rn,t1_fcoj68e,1577834251.0,Thank you!

pharmacy,fco6pt4,t1_fco2m3l,1577825125.0,"I mean, it makes sense for the dentist to be on call, and if it's an oral injury being treated I obviously have no problem with the dentist writing the scripts. It's just to me it seems highly unrealistic that an ER would call their on-call dentist for influenza (as the OP proposed) or a patient with chest/abdominal bruising (as in my encounter)."
pharmacy,fco6j4w,t1_fco47hj,1577825025.0,"I understand that. Why would the dentist on call be called in to look at a patient with bruises to the chest, abdomen, and arms? Pretty sure he wouldn't. So the dentist writing scripts in the situation I encountered was pretty unrealistic, and they wouldn't get the on-call dentist to write Tamiflu either."
pharmacy,fcnne3t,t3_ei610l,1577814782.0,"Well, first I would call that dentist and ask them what test they were using to diagnose influenza, which is really out of their scope of practice. I would ask them why they didn't simply recommend the patient go to an urgent care facility or their GP, where it falls under their purview to test and prescribe drugs for influenza.

I probably would not fill it without an MD having written it. I might call the patient's GP to let them know what happened and see if they would be willing to give me a verbal provided the patient made an appointment with them.

We had a dentist try to prescribe narcotics supposedly from the emergency room a couple weeks ago and we absolutely refused to fill them because they weren't from any kind of dental work or surgery. The patient had gotten bruised up from a car accident. I don't know why they had a dentist in the ER or why that dentist decided to write for narcotics but come on, dude, that's not your job."

AmItheAsshole,fchg6bs,t3_ehakfe,1577650198.0,"NAH. Honestly, when I first started reading your post, it was like reading off a list of my own issues, so I absolutely understand how you feel. The ambiguity of having clusters of symptoms but no real diagnosis is enough to make you sink deep into depression. I'm currently recovering from a diagnostic surgery and when they told me in the hospital that the surgeon didn't find anything, I cried.

However, I get the shock/concern from people who don't have chronic illness. I was excited when they said I probably had endometriosis because it would answer so many questions. Then I didn't have it, and now I'm just confused and frustrated and grasping at straws again. People who don't live life chronically ill don't typically understand why we would say ""I have all the symptoms of lupus, I wish I had been diagnosed with it."" I would probably try to limit those comments out loud, or explain you're not looking to contract something, you just wish that you could put a name to all your jumbled symptoms because then you can start to fight it. You can't fight it if you don't know what it is."

Neither of my cats liked anyone else until I showed them each cat's own 'language' of greeting and interacting. He might just throw off the wrong signals with his body language.

aww,fcpbcdz,t3_eiedb5,1577857030.0,Oh what a sweet little guy! I feel like a huge meanie for giggling at his wobbles. I love there at the end where he flops because of his legs and he just has that 'I absolutely meant to do that on purpose' face. What a wonderful kitty.
cats,fcp8p03,t3_eie0al,1577854229.0,"Okay, hopefully some of this advice might help.

1. Cats don't like their food, water, and litter right in the same place. I would encourage you to set the food and water outside the bathroom so he kind of has to leave his 'territory' to get to them.

2. Try not to be around his bowls when he's eating because he might be resource-defensive.

3. Learn how to approach him and what his body language means. Jackson Galaxy has tons of wonderful educational material on learning how to understand your kitty.

4. Does he have toys? He might have excess energy pent up and not much to release it with. I would recommend a wand toy, because you can interact with him without getting too close and making him skittish.

5. I have not used the product myself, but Feliway diffusers are supposed to be super good at lowering feline anxiety and aggression and their stress levels.

6. Get established with a vet in your community and take him for a checkup. When you have a vet-pet-owner relationship, you have more access to professional advice and treatment as needed. Especially if he isn't neutered, that can increase aggression too.

I hope some of this helps you and your little guy develop a better relationship!"
pharmacy,fcp0cpv,t1_fcoy29u,1577846614.0,"[There absolutely are tests](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/testing.htm) that need to be done to diagnose actual influenza. If you don't do one of those tests, you can't say with certainty that a patient has influenza.

And yes, prescribers will order Tamiflu for family members so they don't get sick, but that would accompany a prescription for the family member that actually has influenza.

None of what you said is relevant to the actual topic at hand, meaning *dentists prescribing Tamiflu*. Dentists don't possess those diagnostic tests in their office nor is it within their purview to provide a script for an antiviral drug for a non-dental reason."
cats,fcolctd,t3_ei7ums,1577835135.0,"What a lovely little girl! Precious enough to steal my heart for sure. There's nothing quite like the first time you hold your kitten and bring them home and see this tiny creature start to carve out her place in your home. I'll never forget how in awe I was when I brought my first kitten home, she was a little bitty ginger thing who loved to scream her head off.

There's a lot of great advice in the comments and I'm not sure I have anything really to add in that department - everything I would say has already been said. Good luck with your little lady!"

pharmacy,fco6pt4,t1_fco2m3l,1577825125.0,"I mean, it makes sense for the dentist to be on call, and if it's an oral injury being treated I obviously have no problem with the dentist writing the scripts. It's just to me it seems highly unrealistic that an ER would call their on-call dentist for influenza (as the OP proposed) or a patient with chest/abdominal bruising (as in my encounter)."
pharmacy,fco6j4w,t1_fco47hj,1577825025.0,"I understand that. Why would the dentist on call be called in to look at a patient with bruises to the chest, abdomen, and arms? Pretty sure he wouldn't. So the dentist writing scripts in the situation I encountered was pretty unrealistic, and they wouldn't get the on-call dentist to write Tamiflu either."
pharmacy,fcnne3t,t3_ei610l,1577814782.0,"Well, first I would call that dentist and ask them what test they were using to diagnose influenza, which is really out of their scope of practice. I would ask them why they didn't simply recommend the patient go to an urgent care facility or their GP, where it falls under their purview to test and prescribe drugs for influenza.

I probably would not fill it without an MD having written it. I might call the patient's GP to let them know what happened and see if they would be willing to give me a verbal provided the patient made an appointment with them.

We had a dentist try to prescribe narcotics supposedly from the emergency room a couple weeks ago and we absolutely refused to fill them because they weren't from any kind of dental work or surgery. The patient had gotten bruised up from a car accident. I don't know why they had a dentist in the ER or why that dentist decided to write for narcotics but come on, dude, that's not your job."

Just because your coworkers have different ideas about gift-giving doesn't make you wrong. When I was preparing for the SAT, I got a textbook and a review game as presents from my parents too.

If your son is grateful for the gift and happy to have something to study from to improve his score, that's all that matters. Maybe double check with him that he's not disappointed if you're really worried, but from what you describe everything seems fine."

AmItheAsshole,fchg6bs,t3_ehakfe,1577650198.0,"NAH. Honestly, when I first started reading your post, it was like reading off a list of my own issues, so I absolutely understand how you feel. The ambiguity of having clusters of symptoms but no real diagnosis is enough to make you sink deep into depression. I'm currently recovering from a diagnostic surgery and when they told me in the hospital that the surgeon didn't find anything, I cried.

However, I get the shock/concern from people who don't have chronic illness. I was excited when they said I probably had endometriosis because it would answer so many questions. Then I didn't have it, and now I'm just confused and frustrated and grasping at straws again. People who don't live life chronically ill don't typically understand why we would say ""I have all the symptoms of lupus, I wish I had been diagnosed with it."" I would probably try to limit those comments out loud, or explain you're not looking to contract something, you just wish that you could put a name to all your jumbled symptoms because then you can start to fight it. You can't fight it if you don't know what it is."

cats,fc9g5jg,t1_fc8qkaj,1577552191.0,"Aw, poor hubs and poor kitties!

My grandmother had to have a physical therapist come to the house for a few weeks, and Kettle was just nonchalantly climbing all over my gram and the therapist and the therapist's bag.

Maybe if you let him/encourage him to feed them, have playtime with them, maybe scoop some poop... check out what Jackson Galaxy says about approaching cats. Neither of my cats liked anyone else until I showed them each cat's own 'language' of greeting and interacting. He might just throw off the wrong signals with his body language.

As for dogs, it kind of depends on the dog's size and personality as much as on the cat's. Never personally introduced a dog into a house where cats were already established, so I don't have experience there!"

We've gotten our pharmacists big thermal mugs with their names on them so they don't worry about their coffee getting cold - or which cup belongs to which! Also got them each a flavor of a more 'gourmet' coffee. That was last year, I'm not sure if anyone did anything this year.

I've joked about buying a nice big box of red sharpies for one of my RpHs since he likes to 'relocate' mine down to the pharmacist counter.

It makes me really happy to hear about other good RpH-tech relationships out there! A lot of us seem like we really just tolerate each other when in reality I think my PIC is probably the coolest person I've ever met and I love all our pharmacists.

Merry Christmas, may the ibuprofen serve you well!"
