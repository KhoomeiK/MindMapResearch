Had it out once with this dude on a flight that kept sticking his foot through the arm rest. Had a needle as part of a sewing kit in my bag, and started poking the base of his heel as if something were in the armrest stabbing him. After three pokes, he decided it was better to keep his foot in his own row."

facepalm,ff4if0q,t1_ff454um,1579564365.0,"Yea, i agree with that. I think there should be a mandatory waiting period of 2 years or so before you can apply for college. Or require 2 years of internship at a company in the desired profession. Just to get basics down and allow people to see first hand what they are going to be paying for. The same goes for between BS and grad school. 

I just sat through a National Acadamy of Science (NAS) review of my org, and was amazed at how dumb the NAS PhDs were. You could tell they had gone straight from school to teaching, cuz they were making mistakes that anyone with a month of OJT in industry would never had made. They were supposed to be experts on the topics.

Frankly, i think the stupifying of the millenial gen will screw us all for the decades to come in a lot of ways."
facepalm,ff43f1t,t1_fewm5vo,1579554684.0,"Lol, dude. When i was a machinist, i earned more after 1 year than just about any liberal arts degree did after 5 years out of school. I dont think a lot of people understand how valued actual skilled labour is. Particularly today. When i finished college, a lot of the kids i had gone to school with 6 year prior were still living with their parents. 

I think the big problem is that teachers and parents never promoted these jobs or look down on them cuz they didnt know any better, for most of the kids i knew. The only reason i knew about it was cuz my neighbor was a tool and die maker for years."

facepalm,few85wo,t1_few3jyp,1579406752.0,"Not really, the only value of debt is to build credit. However, a credit card or small car loan over a few years gets you into the 800s without much effort. If you pay it right.

Also, i worked as a machinist and mechanic after high school. So the difference in what i would have had to pay in interest from the college debt is far more than the difference in my current pay verse the six years. That is accounting for expected raises on the high end, from entry level engineering.

Did the math. Saved myself over 30k in the difference, and living it up now debt free."
facepalm,fevyfp3,t1_fevr5lu,1579403138.0,"I worked for six year right out of school to build up the cash for a 4 year engineering degree i just completed and came out with no debt. It can be done easily today, but you have to have the dedication to save the cash. It is a real pain to not go out every weekend, but can be done.

Plus, you are 20 too. Go have some adventures of your own. Best recommendation is to stay single until you are 25 or so, and just enjoy life. Date a bit. Make new friends.

The girls only liked them if the guys gave them attention. Lots of orbiters came and went from the group over the years. Sounds like that might be the case here.

I recommend you find some more friends. Become a part of 3 or 4 friend groups. It will allow you to maintain perspective on your relationships. Prevent you from becoming depended.

It sounds like you are very weak compared to what your sister is pushing you to do, but that isnt something to be ashamed of. Especially if you are trying to improve. Start with the basics to get your body into routine of working out. Approach this from the stand point that you are teaching your muscles how to funcyion in a new way. It will take time

I would find a friend that cares about you from ghe stand point of concern about your health to go with you to keep you motivated.

interestingasfuck,fc97bk7,t1_fc8v82h,1577548184.0,"The vast majority goes to research at national labs, universities, and businesses. A fair portion goes to contractors for manufacturing or services. However, it covers all sorts of things that make their way into the civilian world. Such as medical, environmental, and materials research (and a bunch more). Though planes, tanks, bombs, troop training and so on are very expensive, they are a drop in the bucket to what is spent on industry (not just military industrial) applications and development. For example, where do you think the majority of funding came for wind and solar research? DOD put more into it that than the DOE or any other group. It all comes from the same military budget.

Wanna talk about the medical field? Where do you think all the money for development of prostetics, medicine, and drug advancement comes from. People like to pretend that some PhD or company just came up with all this stuff without getting that money from somewhere.

So this main post implying most or a lot of it is wasted on war, and could be put toward health care for all is idiotic when you actually take the time to see where the money goes. Now if someone is sad cuz we spent 70k to take out just a guy (which is rare btw), when we could have told Johnny to walk his ass over there and shoot the guy with a $1 dollar bullet. Well that doesn't account for all the costs it takes to get Johnny over there in the first place, and gear him up cuz he is usually hoofing up a hill or across open ground where his chances of getting shot are very high. Just about everyone shot or taken out is a ""Bad Guy"", and they are not living on a dollar a day as some put it. They are killing and robbing the people that do live on a dollar a day and keeping them poor so they can keep raping them. 

American isnt the smartest country when it comes to prosecuting wars, and sure suck when it comes to getting the endgame played out. However, no one else is going in there and helping these people. Politically, both sides just take turns being pro war, so anyone thinking it is one side or the other is just retarded.

Now if you wanna argue war is pointless and if we didn't go there, they wouldn't come here. I would recommend you travel to Turkey or Sweden. OR, take a trip to Minneapolis, Minnisota, where we have caught over a hundred trying to join ISIS over the last 5 years...  Most terror groups are in it for the long game, creating cells where they think it will play out the best. Many dont like to come here until they shore up think over there, sure. But they do come here. Bosten for example not too long ago. US and NATO allies spend all that money 1, cuz they are greedy and want the resources there, but 2 so people here can live without having to worry about being attack here by that shit and can be more productive.

metallurgy,fc8qqsd,t3_egprps,1577540286.0,"Alright, so a lot here to cover, but i will keep short. When you combine two metals, the ""phase"" or ""microstructure"" you see can depend on the pecentages (usually in weight percent) of the two metals you are using. Phase diagrams are useful for determining the phase you have, and can be found online with a google search. 

You can then take this phase of the material (or just to composition) to places like matweb.com and look up general ranges of properties for that composition. 

From there, you can narrow down what it is or could be base on some of the mechnical properties the company you looked at posted (guessing B means Rockwell B), and find the material on matweb.com that best matches your hardness. Also, google a conversion chart from hrb to other hardness methods for conversions. If the company stated some information on how the processed the material, that should help you narrow down the specific material and what its properties are. Most companies list a specific name of the alloy, which can indicate the process they used to make it.

Otherwise, you can go to ""google scholar"" and try hunting for info on the material there.

If you want to learn about this topic in depth, (cuz this bit i wrote is just skimming it) i would look into getting a copy of Calister. It is a very very good book for learning about metallurgy, and other material science fields. Or if you want to go all out AMS handbooks can give you years of information to learn from. Plus they are pretty easy to reference. MIT has a free online set of classes you can google on this as well."
relationships,fc0butb,t3_efggyd,1577286278.0,"Best thing to do is not take a side. It will only cause problems for you. When they presure you on it, just throw your hands in the air dramatically and tell them this is between your parents to figure out. You csn note how it isnt the responsibility of children to take sides in their parents break up.

That should put either side on the backfoot and get them to back off you."

interestingasfuck,fc97bk7,t1_fc8v82h,1577548184.0,"The vast majority goes to research at national labs, universities, and businesses. A fair portion goes to contractors for manufacturing or services. However, it covers all sorts of things that make their way into the civilian world. Such as medical, environmental, and materials research (and a bunch more). Though planes, tanks, bombs, troop training and so on are very expensive, they are a drop in the bucket to what is spent on industry (not just military industrial) applications and development. For example, where do you think the majority of funding came for wind and solar research? DOD put more into it that than the DOE or any other group. It all comes from the same military budget.

Wanna talk about the medical field? Where do you think all the money for development of prostetics, medicine, and drug advancement comes from. People like to pretend that some PhD or company just came up with all this stuff without getting that money from somewhere.

So this main post implying most or a lot of it is wasted on war, and could be put toward health care for all is idiotic when you actually take the time to see where the money goes. Now if someone is sad cuz we spent 70k to take out just a guy (which is rare btw), when we could have told Johnny to walk his ass over there and shoot the guy with a $1 dollar bullet. Well that doesn't account for all the costs it takes to get Johnny over there in the first place, and gear him up cuz he is usually hoofing up a hill or across open ground where his chances of getting shot are very high. Just about everyone shot or taken out is a ""Bad Guy"", and they are not living on a dollar a day as some put it. They are killing and robbing the people that do live on a dollar a day and keeping them poor so they can keep raping them. 

American isnt the smartest country when it comes to prosecuting wars, and sure suck when it comes to getting the endgame played out. However, no one else is going in there and helping these people. Politically, both sides just take turns being pro war, so anyone thinking it is one side or the other is just retarded.

Now if you wanna argue war is pointless and if we didn't go there, they wouldn't come here. I would recommend you travel to Turkey or Sweden. OR, take a trip to Minneapolis, Minnisota, where we have caught over a hundred trying to join ISIS over the last 5 years...  Most terror groups are in it for the long game, creating cells where they think it will play out the best. Many dont like to come here until they shore up think over there, sure. But they do come here. Bosten for example not too long ago. US and NATO allies spend all that money 1, cuz they are greedy and want the resources there, but 2 so people here can live without having to worry about being attack here by that shit and can be more productive.

This shit isnt rocket science."

You only have this sense of morality, cuz you sit on all the death and destruction you ancestors commited. Like everyone else. 

If you wanna break the cycle, go start a charity. Cuz there is no political, cultural, or religious group that doesnt partake in some form of interferance or disruption..."

metallurgy,fc8qqsd,t3_egprps,1577540286.0,"Alright, so a lot here to cover, but i will keep short. When you combine two metals, the ""phase"" or ""microstructure"" you see can depend on the pecentages (usually in weight percent) of the two metals you are using. Phase diagrams are useful for determining the phase you have, and can be found online with a google search. 

You can then take this phase of the material (or just to composition) to places like matweb.com and look up general ranges of properties for that composition. 

From there, you can narrow down what it is or could be base on some of the mechnical properties the company you looked at posted (guessing B means Rockwell B), and find the material on matweb.com that best matches your hardness. Also, google a conversion chart from hrb to other hardness methods for conversions. If the company stated some information on how the processed the material, that should help you narrow down the specific material and what its properties are. Most companies list a specific name of the alloy, which can indicate the process they used to make it.

Otherwise, you can go to ""google scholar"" and try hunting for info on the material there.

If you want to learn about this topic in depth, (cuz this bit i wrote is just skimming it) i would look into getting a copy of Calister. It is a very very good book for learning about metallurgy, and other material science fields. Or if you want to go all out AMS handbooks can give you years of information to learn from. Plus they are pretty easy to reference. MIT has a free online set of classes you can google on this as well."
relationships,fc0butb,t3_efggyd,1577286278.0,"Best thing to do is not take a side. It will only cause problems for you. When they presure you on it, just throw your hands in the air dramatically and tell them this is between your parents to figure out. You csn note how it isnt the responsibility of children to take sides in their parents break up.

That should put either side on the backfoot and get them to back off you."
