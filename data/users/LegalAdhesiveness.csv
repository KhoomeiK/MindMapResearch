He even had the audacity to yell at me for hitting his dog while it had my dog in its mouth.

This is why I think an outright ban is safer, you shouldn't need to take special precautions because someone else wants to own a stupid breed that CAN be driven into a frenzy."

What happens when the dog aggression turns on and it lunges out of your grip? This is the problem with pit owners.

unpopularopinion,fenkxxy,t3_eq1e57,1579286901.0,"Dogs that act aggressively and hurt people are often a result of passive ownership and babying, not being maltreated into aggression. A dog that is beaten/feels threatened will not bite/attack unless it's absolutely cornered, they're not like people to hold a grudge. A dog that knows it can get its own way with humans in the household is more likely to try and dominate strangers too, which results in violence."

If you want to know the history way back I'd reccomend reading about the different breeds (they would have been types back then rather than breeds like we have today) went into creating baiting dogs, like the alaunt, bullenbeisser, and old terrier types. When pit nutters say they were bred from bulldogs it conjures an image of the fat harmless Old English bulldogs that we have today and not the athletic baiting dogs bulldogs used to be."
