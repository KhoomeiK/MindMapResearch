rhythmheaven,fdcem7g,t3_ekknci,1578273009.0,"I’ve been thinking about this for a while now. I would actually prefer that the next rhythm heaven has only old games, but only if it had all of them. So many games from tengoku and ds are really good and in desperate need of a remake, but haven’t seen the light of day in over a decade. And the possibilities for remixes too, if they had every game in the series then you would only be able to imagine what they could do. There could even be a custom remix editor."

rhythmheaven,fcu54yq,t3_eit2ca,1577972789.0,"Headphones. They block out the noise of you clicking the button, so having to hit the button slightly earlier won’t throw you off. When you’re using earbuds though, be sure to plug it into the Wii somehow. If you’re using a Wii U, then use the gamepad. Not only can you plug headphones directly into it, but it also has slightly less display lag (somehow). Oh, and you can point the Wii remote at the camera instead of a sensor bar."

A joke is all that it is, and if you don’t want to believe that and admit defeat, that’s up to you. Until then, try listening to the other side instead of assuming that you’re always going to be right. Some things can be backed away from, and nobody’s going to follow you around and call you a coward over it.

Oh, and really make sure that you read over what I said a couple times and make sure that you really understand it, since I know you’re going to breeze right past the point."
