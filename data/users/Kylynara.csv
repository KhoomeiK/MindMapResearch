babywearing,feklqyv,t3_epm4my,1579202682.0,"Woven wraps give you a lot of flexibility.  They provide a LOT of support  for tiny newborns.  For the first year or so you'll be wearing baby for hours and hours every day.  Having options to wear the easiest way for the task at hand, to change where the pressure points are, or even deal with wearing while receiving from an injury is extremely helpful.  

Soft Structured Carriers (buckles) generally require inserts to properly support tiny newborns, and generally just don't support as much. They also always put pressure on the same spots and don't have as much flexibility.

Wearing slows down gradually between 1-4 as they prefer their own feet, learn to listen well enough to be allowed that freedom in more places, build up muscles to use their feet for longer periods of time.

I found I still wrapped most the time we were out of the house up to age 2.  About 18mos.-2 years is where I found myself using the buckles   more and more when wearing, because it tended to be a lot more wear across the parking lot, then put him in the cart seat or let him down to play on the playground equipment.  Or he'd walk a bit, then get tired and want held and buckles were easy to wear around my waist when not in use.  But comfy enough that I could wear him through afternoon naps on long outing days.

Another factor to consider about 18 months-2.5 years is when kids are big enough for toddler size soft structured carriers (varies by carrier brand and kid size).

If you are trying to not buy many carriers, my reccomendation would be a base -2 wrap and toddler buckles later on."

It's a bit like complaining that you can't order a BigMac at an Italian Restaurant.  That's just not what they do.

Locks of Love makes wigs for kids with alopecia (permanent baldness), not cancer*.  The wigs they make are extra high-end wigs that can we worn while swimming, playing sports, etc.  They're important to those kids to prevent teasing and bullying, and the resultant mental health issues from growing up dealing with that constantly.  Kids with cancer generally aren't energetic enough to do those things much, and cancer largely garners sympathy not teasing even amount kids.  It's like buying a new Ferrari to teach your kid to drive, too much for the task at hand.  You can do it, but don't expect anyone else to foot the bill.

In addition to all that they are on a sliding fee scale, because there's a lot of costs to make them besides the hair, and families of kids with alopecia aren't inherently financially devistated by medical costs.

On top of all this, they don't hide any of this info or misrepresent themselves at all on their own website.  The backlash all seems to because people made the wrong assumptions, or were told wrong by people unassociated with Locks of Love and are mad about being wrong.

You are celebrating that the bullying has ceased and that you can be certain it won't start up again.  You are celebrating privately.  You didn't even tell your sister you were celebrating or happy or anything.  You did fairly innocuous actions that only someone who knows you well would even recognize as celebrating.  So I don't think it's fair for her to get mad at you for it, but it would have been more diplomatic if you could have made sure your sister didn't see you.

I don't think it's fair to object to your sister being bully's sister's friend, unless his sister or your sister have taken part in the bullying.  Him bullying you is out of their control.

relationships,fdnxpe8,t3_emb0gt,1578594967.0,"I don't think I can really explain how much pregnancy changes your own view of your body and your attractiveness.  It's not just gaining the weight (though that's no small part), your body proportions are changing too, and it's happening really fast and your internals feel different too.  On top of all that, you don't know what the end result will be or how soon you'll get there (baby takes 9 mo., but that's just when the changes start reversing, the end point of getting back to not pregnant body is much less clear.)

Beyond that she's probably having parenting worries, made less rational by hormones. And probably suddenly is wondering how to counteract the objectifying message behind daddy's tattoo.  There really is a feeling that you need to have parenting figured out by the time baby arrives.  In practice, I don't think most parents feel like they have parenting figured out even once ""baby"" moves out."

The contract better say how long it lasts (either by # of months/weeks or by a total number of hours, shoot for it to come out close to your $100/hr. contract rate), how many hours per week max you will do for them, and what specific type of tasks are included (so you don't end up with busy work to ensure you hit the maximum every week).  You might also include a way for you to buy down that max time.

Otherwise you are going to find all your ""free time"" taken up with their work for the next few years while they the process of clearing that debt.  In the end the only way you will escape is by paying it yourself and having done all that work as a volunteer."

May I suggest you send that religious advisor a fruit basket or gift card equivalent to a dinner out or some such along with a note of thanks.  He did right by her and you and made it very clear that his expression of her wishes was based on her wishes and not his own biases, so you could make this decision with peace."
Sims4,fdjyiv3,t1_fdjpgpc,1578491450.0,"A lot of this is lack of vocabulary.  She said nuggets, but she meant specifically the nuggets shaped like dinosaurs or specifically the nuggets from McDonald's or she meant fish sticks and they look a lot like nuggets and her mind brought up the wrong word/she didn't know the right one.

Also possible she changed her mind.  They do that a lot at that age."

AmItheAsshole,fdgu7tr,t3_el32ez,1578408441.0,"YTA.  You couldn't manage to make something yourself.  You left the parenting all to your wife.  You couldn't follow simple instructions on what meals were okay to take.  She's grieving and you took a treasured momento she had plans for and destroyed it, then got pissed off she was upset about it.

On top of all this, your defense is that you're lazy? You are so completely the asshole here."

AmItheAsshole,fdgqblz,t1_fdfoxt5,1578405523.0,"I'm guessing daughter's version will likely include that OP cheated on her mom with the fiancee.  Not because OP did, but because the daughter's mom believes that to be true and has told daughter that and daughter believes Mom.

That would go a long way towards explaining the hostility and calling her a homewrecker.  Mom believed OP was cheating before the divorce and could easily be the type of person who doesn't let facts get in the way of their beliefs."

AmItheAsshole,fdcsd2l,t1_fdcas38,1578282938.0,"I would argue that you would even be okay to ask that she at least not wear black.  Traditionally it's rude for women to wear black to a wedding because it's a mourning color and it implies that you wish the wedding wasn't happening.  (Men's suits/tuxes are frequently black and that's fine, but a man wearing a black shirt or pocket square or similar would also have been viewed as insulting.)"
