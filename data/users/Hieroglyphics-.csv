gamedev,ffef36z,t1_ffeek1b,1579845605.0,"That's a fairly inaccurate statement. Some devs fit the bill. But most game devs value criticism. Gives them an idea of what they need to work on. And a good developer will take that feedback and implement it.

Gamers demand everything be catered to them with no regard for anyone else. And if you don't cater to them, they make it loudly known how personally attacked they feel. Cant go through an article on a new release without droves of ""ugh, another game in X genre, I guess the developer doesn't want me to buy the game."" They don't offer solutions or allow for compromise, they just complain constantly.

As a gamer with only a passing interest in gamedev, I can safely say that quite a few other gamers are obnoxious in the way they interact with developers."
Unity2D,ffe556m,t3_esv13v,1579836959.0,Amazing work!
gamedev,ffe4p2e,t3_esto2v,1579836625.0,"Gamers are without a doubt the most entitled group of people I've seen. Anything they see as a downside with a game, they seem to take as a personal attack on everything they stand for. And they are extremely vocal when their poor feelings are hurt. It's such a ridiculous thing to watch.

Oh, but don't you dare say anything negative about games they enjoy. They can spew shit but can't take it in return."
bloodborne,ffdwbb9,t3_esxgun,1579830529.0,I love it! Thanks for sharing.
bloodborne,ffcj0hr,t3_esq11a,1579800494.0,"I'm playing through for the first time now and I've gotta say, this is definitely my favorite game in the Soulsborne series. I don't know how well a sequel would do with the story since I haven't quite finished the game yet, but I can say I would love to see more in this setting."
bloodborne,ff5i9l4,t1_ff30g8d,1579594110.0,"I just bought a PS4 Slim 1TB bundle with The Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn, and God of War. Already had Bloodborne as I played occasionally on my roommate's PS4. Also picked up Spider-Man and Shadow of the Colossus (and Sekiro, but that isn't an exclusive) on a sweet deal from someone on OfferUp. Oh, and Uncharted from PS+. Needless to say, I am set for quite some time with some amazing games.

Currently splitting time between Bloodborne (my new favorite in the Soulsborne series) and Horizon Zero Dawn. HZD is such an amazing game! I really wasn't expecting it to be nearly as much fun as it is."
