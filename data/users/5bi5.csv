When I was very young Sears had a fashion show in the mall for kids.  I got a whole free outfit for being in it--probably the most stylish I ever was in 1990.  Got my ears peirced at the Claires when I was 7.  Saw 'The Little Mermaid' in the theater. Once when I was in middle school I volunteered to help with the city-wide garden fair, held in the mall, and we got to play on the escalators after-hours.  And we thought *that* was empty and spooky.

I loved the teal and pink glitter christmas decorations.  At christmas they transformed the fountain area into a perfect glittery fairy land.

My favorite stores were Walden Books, World of Science, and Claires.  Spencers once I became old and 'worldly'.  I have a memory of a candy shop too--and the popcorn shop was awesome.

Eventually they took out all the trees growing recessed into the floor.  Maybe they'd gotten too big, or the root systems were causing problems.  Replaced them with trees in pots.  It wasn't the same. The book stores closed early.  B Daltons lasted longer than Walden's.  It never got a chance for a Hot Topic--you had to go to Summit Mall I think for that.  The JC Penny went from a normal store to an outlet and then all the discount places started moving in.

The last time I was there was to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the theater there...I think the rest of the mall was gone except for the Target.  Must have been 2009ish. 

I moved out of Akron 10 years go, but I visit often since most of my family still lives in the old neighborhood. My nephew wanted Long John Silvers for his birthday this year, so we had to fight against the Amazon contruction craziness to get to Romig Road.  It was so sad."

Flipping,fdcq0mq,t3_ekhpd1,1578281154.0,"All of the above. My bread and butter is wholesale items, but if I see some cool junk or a good deal I pick it up.  I also do some handmade stuff so I feel like an artist and not just someone who sells shit.  A lot of items can be bought as components for super-cheap and a few minutes and a bit of glue turns $3 into $30."
awfuleverything,fdcp8zt,t1_fdci3ix,1578280586.0,I sold a Princess Di bear for $2.50 a while back...and people say you can't make money on beanies.

awfuleverything,fdcovlp,t1_fdck2wj,1578280313.0,"NOW is the best time to sell Ninja Turtles, not in 70 years.  The kids who played with them are now adults feeling nostalgic.  (I know--I just bought a Barbie from 1986 cuz I missed her.)  In 70 years no one will know what they are. Lots of 100 yr old items are completely worthless because no one alive today has an emotional connection to them.  

Also, plastic degrades.  A lot of plastic items from the 50s to 70s are melting, becoming brittle, ect.  The condition of a mint plastic toy might not stay that way, even under ideal conditions.

AmItheAsshole,fd6dfo0,t1_fd51e5e,1578189279.0,My grandfather was a William Williams.  I tried to look up his obituary once and I had a hard time because there were a few dozen of them.  Apparently it's a common 'funny' name.
Flipping,fd4tcg9,t3_ejuwiz,1578170884.0,Sold an item on the 31st.  Buyer messaged me on the 2nd that they'd pay the next day.  Never got paid. It was a more expensive item that had been listed for a few months too so I was excited to get it gone.
aspergirls,fczoe6j,t3_eja3tc,1578105653.0,I just turned the online selling into a full-time job.  I love it.  Now I source most of my products from online wholesalers and rarely leave the house.
