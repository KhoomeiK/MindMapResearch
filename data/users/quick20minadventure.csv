CitiesSkylines,ffa8kqu,t1_ffa3gfy,1579729986.0,">Why a launcher? Because every other game Paradox makes or publishes had its own launcher. Each team had to independently make their own launcher for their game. It was incredibly inefficient. With one, unified launcher the developers can spend their time working on the game instead of the launcher. With one, unified launcher its much easier for them to roll out an update or information change to the singular launcher rather than 10 different launchers. Why do they need a launcher at all? I'm not a coder, so I don't know specifically, but mods and certain settings need to be activated BEFORE the game boots, so a launcher allows you to change settings around.

This is you defending launcher for optimization and performance reasons.

This is the first time I've seen such toxicity in this sub. If you say that you can't disagree with someone's opinion without insulting them, you need help. Anyway. that's why I'm reporting you for breaking rule 1.

Unified launcher sounds great if you ignore that steam is already a really great unified launcher by itself. You don't need another. This is redundant adware and bloatware that serves no purpose for user. There are literally thousands of games that use steam to update and maintain the game without exclusive second launcher.

CitiesSkylines,feeultx,t1_feetl7c,1579041555.0,"Oh IRL logic is always welcome. One of the most fun part about CSL is how realistic it is. Speed difference on curvature or slope of the road is most definitely important part of it, although CSL doesn't reflect that very accurately. Biffa puts roundabout everywhere and I don't think they're that good of an solution for most of the people. In the video, 4-stack has more vehicles per minute than Pinavia, but Pinavia has just 2 levels while 4 stack has 4 levels. I think a smooth slope is more important, but it's asking too much for CSL to reflect that.

Another issue is that conflict free interchanges are just not the bottleneck. Vehicles getting into correct lane before and after the junction is the bottleneck. I've actually tried this out in game and it makes sense that traffic would slow down because people want to change lanes while it wouldn't slow down at interchange when they just need to follow the lane and not worry about merging or changing lane. Almost all interchange allow you to move at 90%+ of the speed limit comfortably, and it'll simply result in shorter distance between cars.

I have put a lot of thought into this 4 way problem in city and it looks like I'm ready to announce my brainchild hoping that it doesn't get trashed because someone else did it like 40 years ago or it's 200 meters from someone's house.

CitiesSkylines,feddlcx,t1_fedbk0b,1579008534.0,"I don't think curvature of road slows speed smoothly in CSL. It's quantized and most interchange don't slow down the speed.

Exactly like wavelength of EM wave changes in a different medium. You can check this yourself. I have personally tested this a lot for interchange i posted and published.

Roundabouts are said to be more efficient than normal 4 way 4 phase traffic signal. If they jam, they'll put signals on entry/exit and it's a mess only to be improved by flyovers or full on interchange.

CitiesSkylines,fdo1con,t1_fdnvqrb,1578597077.0,"First of all, I totally understand why you did it. It's fine, but somewhat unnecessarily increases the distance a vehicle has to travel. That's not a problem because people don't complain about long routes in CSL, but in real life it should be avoidable.  


As for suggestions, number of lanes in roundabout is not decreasing when one of them exits on right side, inside the roundabout, also, ramps for going straight from north or south are unnecessary, they will be able to utilize the roundabout's outer most lane for that.  


If i were to edit the road types, I'd do the following. I'm assuming that you want one lane to go straight, right and left each. Two one-lane ramps bypassing the roundabout would be deleted and two-lane road would enter from outer side and one-lane ramp would exit the roundabout from outer side.  
From here, roundabout would have 4 lanes in a small segment between two lanes joining in from outer side and one lane leaving from inner side. That will convert into 3 lane highway after 1 lane leaves from inner side. It'll reduce to two lanes when one more lane leaves from outer side. Then two lanes would be joined by 2 lanes coming from outer side and convert into 4 lane road. This will repeat one more time and you have entire roundabout where no one needs to change lane.  


If you want to have two lanes going straight, you can just not delete the bypassing ramps, but then you'd have to increase the road it's splitting from. It'd be 3 lanes splitting into 1 ramp bypassing the roundabout and 2 lanes entering the roundabout.  


I hope whatever I wrote makes sense and is comprehensible instead of complete non-sense. I was limiting my abstract lane mathematics and ability to keep count of what I thought."
CitiesSkylines,fdnv282,t3_em82wt,1578593427.0,"You have awkward lane mathematics. You can go straight with 2 routes for North and south and you need to go a full circle in that roundabout for right turn(LHD) and you're taking 3 levels anyway.

This is working, but I would say it's inefficient and it will cause issues if you overload it.

If you don't care about maximum efficiency or minimum size and just want a functioning, good looking interchange, this is as great as it gets. Put it on workshop."
