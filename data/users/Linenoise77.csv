In most cases NY Tax will  be withheld from your paycheck. At tax time you file with NY state, then tell NJ ""I paid NY state XYZ"" and they credit you that towards your NJ taxes.

Now, the rub is, if you pay NY more than you owe NJ, you do not see that cash back. If you paid less than NJ owes, you still owe NJ the dough.

The tax rates for most people are similar enough that, when i was doing it, it was usually under a hundred bucks one way or another every year, however there are some income brackets on the low and high ends, and a few weird donut holes, where the difference is more significant.

Had blockbuster wanted to enter that market, they certainly had the resources to do so on their own (which they ultimately did).

What made netflix what it was was when they first offered streaming, they had the built in customer base from their mail order service.

newjersey,fey35nt,t3_eqiexx,1579440156.0,"And here is where i get downvoted to hell....ok....deep breath....

As a landlord (and i'm a chill one), while i fully encourage you to know your rights (and am required to give you a packet explaining them), keep in mind if you are going to be the person who waves that packet back at me over every nonsense thing, don't expect me to cut you any slack either, like when it comes to renewing your lease, your security deposit, etc. 

And if you start talking about stuff like that before you even sign a lease, guess what, i'm not going to rent to you. 

The laws in NJ are VERY tenant friendly (which i generally agree with), but that means if there is an issue, you will have no problem finding someone to take your case on contingency, and if i want to take you to court, i'm out a giant pile of money for a lawyer, and a process that will take months, at best. Even for something cut and dry as, ""hey, your honor, the dude isn't paying his rent and won't leave""

I don't make ANYTHING on my property that we rent. Yes, at the end of the day, in X years, i'll own a property that my tenants paid most of the note on, via rent, but i'm not swimming in dough over it, and i'm tossing cash into it each year. 

Now that said, the tenant who is very reasonable, and asks for permission for stuff that they don't technically need to, just because they want to keep me in the loop, or handles minor things that i'm technically on the hook for, is worth their weight in gold (and i always credit any cost, and if it took more than a few minutes, will credit them for their time too).

One bad tenant or having to spend a few months finding a good one to replace a previous good one can blow up my numbers for a year or two easy. So that means if you are a good one, i'll do everything i can to make sure you don't want to leave when the lease comes up. 

So, be informed of your rights, just don't be a dick about them and then complain that you are having a hard time finding a place, or your rent gets jacked every year because i'm running over or paying for someone else to handle trivial stuff at 3am on a saturday because i'm worried about out you suing me.

And no, i'm not going to try and scam you on your security deposit, because the penalties for doing so are insane, and you will win, unless you literally burn down half the house and don't tell me until the lease ends."

newjersey,fehtbvj,t1_feh7dzv,1579123460.0,"I'm not an expert in this. Just someone who went through the mortgage process very recently.

The Urban areas have higher limits because the cost of living is higher, and they want to encourage ownership from higher income people in those areas for obvious reasons, especially with the 5 year requirement.

To be fair, look at bergen, which has an income limit of 100ish, but a max value of a home at 650k. If you are making 100k and buy a home at 650k, unless your downpayment is literally half the house, well, you made a pretty big mistake.

and if you are camping on 300k+, 10k shouldn't be a moving factor in your decision, especially if it affects the strength of your offer.

also, while the site doesn't do a good job of it, i'd expect that the rule applies to HOUSEHOLD income, meaning if you have someone else who you will be using to apply for your mortgage with and they will be on the note, or you are married, their income would be factored in as well.

Like i said, i'm not that familiar with the program, i saw it when we were looking and it didn't apply to us, so moved on, but i have to think there are some things in place for people trying to game 10k. (not saying you are)."
newjersey,feh60yq,t3_eor1ae,1579109877.0,"The income limits vary by county. Since what they are calculating it against looks like the areas gross income, i'd wager they take the same for you, and the numbers look a little on the lower side.

Also recognize in a hot market, going through that program is going to potentially scare some sellers with closing complications. Its already tough enough in some places with a straight up traditional mortgage and everything ready to go and 20% down to compete with them. Dragging a state program into the mix for part of the down payment is going to scare some people (longer time to close, bigger chance of it falling apart at the table, etc).

I know 10k is 10k, but in the grand scheme of things in buying a house, its something you need to look at the bigger picture on.

Now, if you are going after a house that has languished on the market for 6 months, isn't in a hot area, etc, that can change things."

The thing is, you can't just go get yourself a truck and gear and some day laborers. You need to be licensed in the places you work, and they frequently have a limit or requirements as to who they will allow to run a company. Which means you need to work the political end of things to get approved to even try and run your business. These guys are usually well supported by the existing landscape businesses, to limit competition.

Then once you manage to do that, you now need to break into the market. Most people who would shell out the cash have a landscaper already. So you either need to really undercut them in price if you are trying to pull customers away. Even if someone has a shitty landscaper, they just aren't going to google ""landscaper"". They will ask their neighbor or whomever they know in town who has one they think does a good job.
