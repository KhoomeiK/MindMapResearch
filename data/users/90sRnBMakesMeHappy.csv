She's openly racist, obese yet calls out other people on their weight, openly favorites one of her grandchildren over the other ones, is a narcissist. She also created fights between my dad and I. Her own son disowned her due to her just being a shit mom. Her other daughter didn't talk to her for 10 years, too. I don't consider her anything but the second woman my dad married. 

She's the fucking worst. But I also learned how to not be a shitty human being after seeing how she was."

If he's equally as interested, awesome! It sound like an emotional connection, maybe it's the way he makes you feel or how he holds himself that makes him so irresistible to you. 

It took me a year after working with someone to then develop these feelings. So now I am just taking my time getting to know him, will plan to them ask him out for coffee."

Take a new class you are into, or take up a new exercise class, or look at Facebook Events for something that interests you. Do them alone, and find others who are on your wavelength. Make other friends, so you don't have to rely on them for social things."

I was in 4th grade, and fell in worship with The Big Hurt and Black Jack McDowell. I also had a Big Hurt poster and was in his fan club, lol I am a Sox nerd through and through. My dad didn't try to mold me. I just loved growing up watching games in Comiskey, seeing the Big Hurt hit a moonshot.
