PCOS,ffadpzd,t1_ff9yief,1579733152.0,My guy doesn't care. Likes me for who I am. He doesn't even really notice it... Plus he's hairy and insecure about how hairy he is so that helps I'm sure. Find a guy that lets you be yourself no matter what and you won't worry.

Hypothyroidism,fe050qg,t1_fe04vce,1578803233.0,That's what I was wondering if weight changes affect the dosage you need. Thanks.
Hypothyroidism,fe04xbb,t1_fe04qwj,1578803169.0,I hope things improve for you! My Dr is pretty decent regarding thyroid stuff.

Hypothyroidism,fdxgos1,t3_enbb5h,1578768512.0,"My last check was in September 2019 to see if the change in dose brought my number up into ""normal"" range.

I had labs yesterday because I've been having terrible mental acuity problems and severe fatigue again. My doctor won't change anything because I'm in what they consider the normal range, which I understand. 

I have lost 50 pounds over the past year and half, does that cause your tsh levels to change like this?

Does anyone else have test results that change like this all the time?"

gallbladders,fdkq7mm,t3_elwk9o,1578508873.0,"They'll do an ultrasound and maybe a hida scan. Both of those just require you to lay still. 

Recovery varies, most people resume normal life within a few days.

No you won't have to completely change your diet. But you'll have to test it out, see what you can handle and what your body doesn't like. I really didn't change my diet at all.

I was scared of surgery too, but I had the worst attack I'd ever had and that made me decide to get that thing out! If you need surgery it will be better in the long run. It can get septic and cause a lot of pain. Surgery really isn't bad. They'll put you under and you won't realize anything until you are waking up in recovery. Obviously there will be pain but they give you meds for that."
