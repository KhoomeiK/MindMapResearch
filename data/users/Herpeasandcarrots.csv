I'll be 46 in a few days and most of my coworkers think I'm still in my early 30's, even those that are in their 20's and early 30's.  I don't think I look that young so when someone guesses I'm 15 years younger than I am, I always ask them why.  The two most common answers are, ""you don't talk down to us like most older people,"" and ""you still have fun and are open to new ideas.""  You have no idea how happy those responses make me every time I hear them.  I'm not that old yet, but I think that those to things are the secret to a long and happy life."

Then I bought an old farm with about 20 plum  trees in the front yard and got a few hives of honey bees.  The plums were the first major bloom of spring and I was blown away by how active they were and suddenly I didn't miss the snow.

I wasn't very good at it but I would get a donation per day for around $100.  There were other people on my team who would spend an hour or so, get $1 from 300-500 people and blow my numbers out of the water.  It was depressing.

The cooks felt so bad for me that I couldn't have cheese that they ended up completely covering the pizza in shrimp.  It probably had a kilo of shrimp.  It was awesome.

The first few times we tried to throw together something but the woman was ""a trained cook"" and she always complained about the food.  So then we just started pouring drinks.  Lots of drinks.  I used to brew so we literally had a pantry full of alcohol.  At one point I had over 70 cases of beer, mead and cider stacked up.  I saved the ones that were drinkable but not great to offer to this couple.  They kept coming.  I would end up just cracking slightly off beer after slightly off beer and drinking them one after another as fast as I could.  Sometimes they would sit in our kitchen for hours.  It was fascinating.  Oh, I forget, we don't snack.  I'm not sure why, but neither my wife or I are snacky people.  So we don't have snacks on hand.  So no nuts, no chips, no nothing.

The subtleties of interpersonal interactions are lost on me because I never learned them as a child.  I'm 45 and I have at least learned which people seem to be happy to see me so I keep interacting with them while I avoid the people who seem to avoid me.  It works pretty well, but I do struggle with the whole food and drink thing at a gathering.  I think the problem is I have a lot of friends who are catering professionals and they don't like to eat other people's food and have carefully crafted the food and drink for the evening and they think additions will mess it up so I have gotten used to repaying them for their hospitality by helping with other things (helping with physical labor at their business when they need it, etc).
