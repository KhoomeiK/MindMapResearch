AmItheAsshole,ffioobe,t1_ffhw5x0,1579978913.0,"Her mother is one of those people with brown, leathery skin who is going to have problems in the (probably near) future but still doesn’t do anything about it. She’s definitely not an example to go by. So I’m up against teenager who thinks she knows best, bad influence mother, and dad who won’t push the matter."
AmItheAsshole,ffiofml,t1_ffhy66y,1579978749.0,Guyra is the highest point in Australia and the UV levels are dangerously high as there just isn’t as much atmosphere to filter it even a little so occurrences of skin cancers are incredibly high there and the period between 12 and 2 is the worst time of day for it. We’re only about 35km from there and only slightly down hill so not much better.
AmItheAsshole,ffhrlfn,t1_ffhr78m,1579950232.0,Her mother is a prime example of this. Of course pointing that out would make me the arsehole.
BeAmazed,ffhnvgd,t1_ffhk9j5,1579944473.0,"Leaf hits water, movement of plant not strong enough to break surface tension. Human moves water, breaks surface tension, the force from that makes the plant wobble around until put back in water (an object in motion will stay in motion until acted upon by another force). Repeat.

I just hope that someone who cares about you would do the same thing."
AmItheAsshole,ffhky2f,t1_ffhjlxi,1579940114.0,I can assure you that the most she does in terms of skin care is wipe her face over with those cleanser towelette things. She flat our refuses to wear hats or sunglasses too.

It’s inoperable and I just have to watch him to make sure he’s not in pain. Hoping yours is a similar case to Charlie’s and he still has a chance to have a few more years with you.
