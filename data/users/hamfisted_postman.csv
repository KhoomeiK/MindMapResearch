Sexual consent is a big one. Although similar to how  intoxication on other substances can also create false consent it had been my experience that people high on MDMA will go along with pleasurable experiences despite it being something they wouldn't consent to while sober. 

Also, it was common to make party friends who are your best friend while high and strangers when sober. MDMA creates a sense of joy and connectedness that wouldn't otherwise exist. People might offer to repay you if you buy them a tab or pay for a cab.

aspergers,fdhkan6,t1_fdhk75y,1578424449.0,Thank you. I appreciate your fairness.
aspergers,fdhjzlf,t1_fdhj5eb,1578424264.0,"I respect your decision but you should then remove or lock my comment and the following conversation. It is not fair to me to be not allowed to defend my viewpoint. I will be more careful in future. 

My intent was never malicious. It was admittedly ill-timed and did not appropriately respect the feelings of the original poster."
aspergers,fdhj3gb,t1_fdhixj5,1578423719.0,"I agree. I was under the impression that this was an acceptable word in that community. That they were comfortable being called ladyboy. 

I could be wrong of course and I was primarily looking for clarification."
aspergers,fdhgeic,t1_fdhf5b4,1578422088.0,"Ok. I don't agree but that doesn't mean you're wrong. 

Everything you say is true. I did insinuate that she was speaking like an incel. She's far from actually being classified as one and I've been clear about that fact in my other responses. 

Her response to the stress of a break up is normal, expected and valid. 

I pointed out something I saw. I don't believe I'm wrong. 

As far as how men should talk to each other, you all seem comfortable talking to me the way I spoke to her and I welcome it. I won't be bullied into backing down but I'm willing to admit that my approach may have been too cold. 

Men need to call each other out for bad behaviour. Someone knew Epstein and Weinstein were doing what they were doing but they stayed silent. Most men have a friend, coworker or acquaintance who treats women in a way they wouldn't stand for their wife, sister or mother to be treated but they stay silent. That silence needs to end and my statement about this person's words is part of that.

You don't have to agree with me and it's clear you don't but if a man had posted this I would have said the same thing. In fact, I have."
aspergers,fdhf7bo,t1_fdhevdx,1578421372.0,"I didn't mean a term that they used amongst themselves, I meant it's the term that they want to be used. 

I could be wrong of course but whenever I've watched a doc about that community they've always called themselves Ladyboys and didn't seem to mind that others did as well. 

This is obviously an important issue for you. I don't mean any offense. The only way to eliminate hurtful language is to stop using it and I actively work to do that."
aspergers,fdheqnr,t1_fdhctlz,1578421092.0,"Isn't ""ladyboy"" the term that Thai transgender people use for themselves?"
aspergers,fdhb3j5,t1_fdhaunl,1578419198.0,That's not a bad idea but at this point I may have lost that opportunity.
