NotTimAndEric,feyhsof,t1_fewguvl,1579445766.0,Is that why I see so many weird people rapping for Trump now?
doggrooming,few1dn5,t1_feujou6,1579404082.0,"Jesus christ, that is so awful. I hate it when people let their dogs stay fat. It's not cute. It's hard on the dog. Don't do it."
doggrooming,few0zym,t3_eq9pt7,1579403934.0,Haha. Is this one of those chunks that sits while you groom them and you just gotta flop them around? I have a few of those.

dogpictures,femeglt,t1_fekoe4n,1579251264.0,"That arguement is hardly accurate, as studies have shown that most conditions will effect any unhealthy dog. There are some conditions that are hereditary in purebreds, however, a good breeder would know to avoid it and breed away from it. It is also easier to manage the predictable problems that can occur with poor breeding. The problem lies in bad breeding. I have nothing against mutts, all of my dogs have been rescues. My point is that people who spent money on a fake breed are foolish. People who sell mixed breeds are usually just greedy and making money off animals, or out of their league trying to create their own breed, going about it incorrectly. Not to mention, the best breeding candidates are usually not sold to people who would use them in a mixed breed program, meaning most cross breeds come from less healthy purebred dogs."

BreakUps,fej1ohp,t1_fej0ajl,1579153680.0,"Mine was more, ""it's basically the same but with some role reversal,"" and that just seemed unhealthy. Plus it was just weird for me. He didn't get it though and it made me very upset. At the end of the day I lost some friends, which hurt but it's better to just let it go at the end of the day."
DogAdvice,feiwvm9,t3_eoflq1,1579149426.0,"Well dude, have you called your vet yet? 90% of the questions on this sub can be answered by a vet call. Would you let your child walk around with torn knees or would youcall their doctors office? Call you vet, don't ask the internet."
DogAdvice,feiwkq9,t3_eoiy3j,1579149183.0,This isn't a stupid question. Most people ask questions on here that make me question why they even have an animal.
DogAdvice,feiwduc,t1_fegwvop,1579149029.0,People need to stop breeding their fucking dogs and leave it to the professionals.
DogAdvice,feiw236,t1_fei947g,1579148769.0,"Saving money? Go to a clinic, it's really not that expensive. And if your dog has gone into heat they are old ebough."
