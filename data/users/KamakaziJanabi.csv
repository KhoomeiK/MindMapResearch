I'm a book reader so its pretty easy for me to separate the mediums, book is where you'll get the good writing, show is where you get the awesome visuals and set pieces. Comes down to you really and what you want out of it. Can guarantee some awesome visuals, space ship battles and a sci fi story that's pretty original (too me at least)."
