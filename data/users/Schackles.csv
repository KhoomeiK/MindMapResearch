HeroWarsApp,ff6ri7y,t1_ff6rbwl,1579633361.0,"I do have Celeste, and she’s almost powered up to the max team level, but I have difficulty using her on a team. I guess I don’t really understand her mechanics, and she tends to die pretty quickly."

bipolar,fdkkutf,t3_elszmo,1578505667.0,"I ‘m type 2 and am on 400 of lamictal in the morning and 100 of seroquel at night. If I forget to take my seroquel, I’m waking up multiple times at night, but other than that, I don’t have too many side effects. I upped my dose of lamictal from 350 about two months ago, and once it kicked in, it was like a switch flipped over night. I can now tell a difference before and after I take my morning meds, in a positive way. I haven’t been manic or depressed in over a month, while before I was rapidly cycling, and having very high highs and very low lows. I’ve been able to take a step back, see life through a non-emotional perspective, and am ready to start reclaiming who I am. In other words, I think it’s a good combo."
wtwave,fdjyexh,t3_elgznu,1578491363.0,Watching the mini-map is what really did it for me.
bipolar,fdhuh64,t1_fdhu0rv,1578430366.0,Just start writing. Who cares if it’s any “good.” Don’t even think about it and put words on the paper and it’ll start to flow out. (i.e. salami sandwich basketball bushes on a purple fire truck)
HeroWarsApp,fdh9mmg,t1_fdgxlxb,1578418363.0,Thank you!

bipolar,fcrbbqc,t3_eick59,1577899483.0,This made me cry. I’m so happy you guys are here and so supportive!
bipolar,fckp2ux,t3_ehph24,1577730126.0,"I stopped drinking about 3 weeks ago.  The first week was very difficult, but as each day goes by, it gets easier and easier. I feel a little more human every day.  Going out has been a pretty big adaptation (especially with the holidays), but I’ve already found that if I immediately get myself an n/a drink when I walk in the door, it makes it so much easier to keep on rolling sober."
bipolar,fck7ddu,t1_fcj7hmz,1577718636.0,"This just happened to me two weeks ago. After four days of the pharmacy dragging their feet, I finally got a refill. During the few days that I missed my doses though, I slowly felt like I was eating a bowl of cocaine frosted methy-o’s for breakfast. I agree, totally check out the pharmacy and see if they can give you a few pills to make sure you don’t miss any doses."
GamePhysics,fcfurwm,t3_eh1jam,1577633924.0,"I remember getting Skyrim for Christmas and being super excited to play it. Because I was excited, so was my dad, so he wanted to watch me play.

Opening scene? The horse and cart are at a 90 degree angle to the road, it gets stuck, and the dialogue won’t advance. My dad and I just started laughing at the WTF moment, and I rebooted.

That was my very first Bethesda experience."
pathofexile,fc5xdyx,t1_fc5stsp,1577467894.0,"Thanks, but that doesn’t really answer my question."
bipolar,fbxyy4g,t3_ef0dcd,1577204070.0,"I think I feel more of a double life between different people. There are a few people with whom I feel I can truly be myself, and there are others for whom I “put on a good show.”  It’s exhausting to keep up appearances with the majority of people, but when with the select few who understand and don’t judge, no matter what I’m like, it feels absolutely euphoric."
tumblr,fbt6urm,t3_ee90pb,1577069890.0,"When I was younger, I had downloaded a bunch of space ghost clips, and this was by far my favorite. My other one was Brak saying “Space Ghost, I think I’m pregnant.”"
