Literally anything is capable of being perverted in the wrong hands -- and you don't see people applying that logic nearly as much anywhere else outside of politics, so it would be wholly hypocritical as well.

books,fcwmje5,t3_eixln2,1578029856.0,"Highly disagree. I think it's good to expose yourself to different things, even if you don't like it. Heck, *especially* if you don't like it. I'll never forgot the first time my school made us read books like ""Lord of the Flies"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", and ""Catcher in the Rye"". I hated everything about them. The characters, the story, the dry writing style, and afterwards I felt so depressed I almost felt like hanging myself in a deserted barn where no one would ever find me. God forbid you should read any of Tolstoy's works at a tender age like we did.

&#x200B;

But if there's one thing any of these terribly depressing and (often) rather boring books taught me, it was the importance of why we be exposed to things we don't necessarily like or want to read. I think the key is to simply balance it out with things you *do* like,  so that you can remember why reading is fun -- as well as important."
