intermittentfasting,fdsmlyj,t1_fdsldhk,1578705187.0,"Personal goal: 1800 calories with 120g+ protein. 

Daily Diet usually involves the following:  Bag of Frozen Mixed Veggies, Okios Greek Yogurt(mixed with frozen berries), Light cheese sticks, 1/3rd cup of oats mixed with protein powder and PBFIT2(powdered peanut butter), Chicken/Steak/Salmon(usually chicken breast), Pure Protein Bar, Rice Crackers, sardines/tuna (not too much tuna) 

Sorry if the formatting is bad. I usually just mix and match any of that stuff around the week to reach my daily 1800cal, not just eat all of that in one day.  My brain stops being hungry normally around 6 pm after fasting for so long so I try to get in my 1800 calories before then. 

I will always eat after 6 if I didn‚Äôt make it in time because I don‚Äôt want to starve myself."
