puppy101,ffe1fjb,t3_esqtja,1579834212.0,"My 8 week old lab likes to take his favorite toys for a swim in his water bowl. We adopted him a week ago and we first bought him a few toys (a pack of chew toys, a rope, and a stuffed raccoon) thinking it would be enough to start him off. We have now tripled the amount of toys he originally had simply so we can have a couple in rotation at all times while the others are drying."
aww,ff3f9qo,t1_ff2ixi6,1579539869.0,He’s super soft! 10/10 would recommend pets
aww,ff3f7of,t1_ff2iqan,1579539837.0,It’s impossible really :)
aww,ff3f261,t1_ff2hzoh,1579539750.0,He’s a boy :)
aww,ff3ezd9,t1_ff2yzn6,1579539706.0,"I’m lucky enough to have 3 shelters within an hour’s drive from my home. I’ve been consistently watching all 3 of those shelters websites until I saw a puppy or dog that I was interested in. I saw him on one of the websites Thursday and went to meet him Friday. I adopted him in the spot :) My advice is to see what shelters are local to you and watch their pages like a hawk. The cuter the pet, the quicker he or she will be adopted, so when you see one you like, go visit ASAP."

aww,ff29mq7,t1_ff285z1,1579497907.0,"We got him a crate his first day home lol. We’ve been talking getting him a friend in a few months or so, but we wanna get him a little more trained first."
aww,ff27x8d,t1_ff27fo4,1579496394.0,"Thank you :) yes, this was his first day in our house. Since then he has become quite the little tornado. I love him to bits and pieces though :)"
aww,ff27spq,t1_ff2789c,1579496286.0,The shelter had him listed as a Labrador/Retriever/Shepard mix. My boyfriend and I want to do a DNA test on him so we can find out exactly what he is.
puppy101,ff27kj2,t1_ff2785e,1579496088.0,"We did that as well, but it wasn’t enough unfortunately. He was surrendered to the shelter with all of his litter mates and they had 2 puppies in each crate. We’ve only had him a few days so we think he’s just lonely at night. The clock and heating pad seem to be doing the trick though :)"
aww,ff25pw8,t1_ff256s9,1579494544.0,He really was! I love him already :)

offmychest,fe5zchs,t3_enrwa2,1578878306.0,I think everyone has moments of this simply because it’s impossible to know exactly how someone feels. The best you can do is be kind and hope that the people in your life will return that same kindness. Hope this helps.
offmychest,fe3bfbm,t1_fe1yt27,1578847736.0,"If this happens to you in a public place in the future, loudly call him out. If other people are around he’s not going to keep following you after you make a big scene. I listen to a true crime podcast (Crime Junkies) and their motto is, “Be weird, be rude, stay alive”. It basically means that sometimes we’re too polite or too afraid to be rude to strangers who are sketchy and that’s how a lot of young women end up in dangerous or life threatening situations. If someone is making you feel uncomfortable you have EVERY right to be rude or “weird” to make sure you feel safe. You might end up being rude to someone who has no malicious intentions, but at the end of the day I think it’s more important to feel safe than to be right about that kind of thing. It could save your life one day."

TrueCrimeDiscussion,fd786se,t1_fd5erye,1578200699.0,"That hasn’t been confirmed by police. That theory is going around because she is a recovering addict, but neither the media or police have mentioned whether drugs were even involved in her death."
