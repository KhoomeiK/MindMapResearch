I like to feed my hermit crabs cooked egg, meat, fruit, etc. But that goes bad fast. If I'm leaving over the weekend I stick to freeze dried shrimp, spirulina powder, worm castings, and the like.

The most important thing is to make sure their habitat is set up correctly. Deep water pools, Instant Ocean (or similar product) salt solution, 6"" mostly-sand substrate, 80 degrees/80% humidity, sealed tank, lots of climbing structures. Really, once you have that, they can be left alone for up to a week without any issues (obviously, start with smaller time periods and check on how your setup does when left alone first!)

It looks like the substrate isn't well mixed and the eco earth is on the bottom. Combined with the misting, you could be setting yourself up for disaster here. The eco earth on the bottom gets flooded, bacteria set in, the sand on the top seems perfectly fine... until a hermit crab buries itself to molt.

Each crab should have several appropriate and shells of the right size. With 5 crabs, I wouldn't be comfortable with fewer than 10 shells. They're really picky and you have no idea which one they'll identify as the ""good"" shell and potentially start fighting over. Make sure there are LOTS of options.

You might luck out and find some good stuff at Michaels, but if you really want to make sure, Naples Sea Shell Company is sort of the Cadillac of hermit crab shells: [http://naplesseashellcompany.com/hermit\_crab\_shells.html](http://naplesseashellcompany.com/hermit_crab_shells.html) Make sure to measure your hermit crabs and get the right size for them.

The tank is definitely on the small side for 5 crabs, particularly because they don't have any climbing stuff. It's all just flat. Craft mesh, sticks/wood from your backyard, junk around your house -- just avoid metal. How do you plan to attach two 20 gallon tanks together? 

I wouldn't bother boiling unless you suspect something might contain insects/mites or some potentially toxic residue (in which case you would scrub, not boil anyway). Hermit crabs are wild creatures. You should concentrate on fostering a *healthy equilibrium of microorganisms* rather than eliminating them. You cannot eliminate them. 

I get a little white fluffy mold in my tank sometimes. It's fine. Just replace and wash stuff as you go, introduce springtails, investigate if you get a big mold bloom for no apparent reason (mold can be useful!). A little mold will not kill a crab."
hermitcrabs,fffrtav,t3_et2yds,1579890412.0,"I'd sink the water dishes into the substrate so that the crabs can access them more easily. Also, remove the rocks so that they're able to submerge.

Here's a comment I wrote to a post a few weeks ago which lays out plan for the cheapest possible hermit crab setup that will keep crabs happy and healthy indefinitely: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hermitcrabs/comments/eie3a7/on\_a\_budget\_basic\_info/fcuv13n/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hermitcrabs/comments/eie3a7/on_a_budget_basic_info/fcuv13n/) 

Unfortunately, it's still about $100 for everything!"
hermitcrabs,fffq345,t3_et31uu,1579889344.0,"Eco earth alone goes ""bad"" much faster than sand/mostly sand. It rots, harbors bacteria, and needs to be replaced. Sand is also a lot cheaper -- 50 pound bag is $5 at the Home Depot near my house! While the eco earth will hold its shape, sand is also just more robust in this regard. It can handle other crabs walking on it, items on top of it, and still support tunnels underneath. Less likely to collapse.

Honestly though, it's probably not the biggest deal in the world, as long as it's deep enough. Sometimes people latch onto ideas in this sub (like 5:1 sand:eco-earth) as gospel, and fear that any who stray will doom their crabs. If you want eco-earth, or one side sand and one side eco-earth, or whatever -- you do you!"

The best thing I ever did was get a glass lid and use reflective bubble insulation to seal up/insulate the back part of it (where the cords go) and sides of the tank. The humidity is super super stable and easy to adjust when I want to.

The increased heat, from the insulation, brings the humidity up naturally. Warm air holds more moisture than cold air.

The insulation also allows me to have high heat and humidity without getting condensation on the sides of the tank -- even when the ambient room temperature is cooler. 

Spraying and using a fogger is can flood your substrate and cause bacterial blooms. Avoid it if at all possible.

Also experiment with turning the bubblers off and/or adjusting the type and speed of bubbler (use a different/finer grained air stone). What can happen is you're bringing air from the outside into the tank.
