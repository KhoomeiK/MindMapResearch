I hope you treat yourself well, thats the trick to BP, in my opinion"
bipolar,ff7fx51,t3_es2vi8,1579648630.0,"For me, it's knowing I'm over confident in my abilities, or that I see myself losing focus during conversation or tedious tasks. Those are more subtle and require more evaluation. The more obvious ones are irratability, or feeling hypersexual for no good reason, or not stopping when you know you should (alcohol/weed)

These are just my examples, I don't know what would trigger you outside of this post"
bipolar,ff4xgc8,t1_ff4uxgh,1579574779.0,"I had a psych but never a therapist MediCal doesn't cover tharapists; and there are no groups where I live. In my area of California, employers have the right to your medical records, for as long as it does not pretain to physical injury or temorary illness, which is why I lie on applications if they do not perform a background check on me. The problem I run into more often than not is the job being temp only, or I simply do not qualify. I volunteer as much as I can to network, and I've even looked into my own business, which is a rocky start when you have nothing.

I wish it was as simple as trying more. I've been in and out of all kinds of work for 4+ years and it's draining. 6 months is a milestone I wish I could even reach at any job, but since the part time entry level jobs don't exist, I'm stuck volunteering and setting up an Open mic for a humbling 20 dollars a week.

It's frustrating seeing places with Now Hiring signs, only to have an asterisk followed by ""Manager"" or something of the sort that automatically disqualifys me from applying. Looks like if you have bipolar and you live in a city where every employer can find out, you're never moving up. Ever.

I guess life really isn't fair, even if you can prove you're the hardest worker, ambitious, or maybe you try your very best. You could Apply at jobs all day around here, and if you don't speak 2 languages or have any mental instability, then you're f'kd. Apparantly, Nothing will ever come your way when you have nothing but a wifi connection at walmart on a government phone."

love,fecg0ra,t3_eofh18,1578973025.0,"Learning to Unlove someone for the 3rd time should be evident that love isn't and never will be for you. I learned that one the hard way. So now I know for next time, except there will never be a next time because love never works. ðŸ˜¢ðŸ’”"

relationships,fdnv1cm,t1_fd3zjmd,1578593412.0,"Update: I confronted her aboutbthis and she ended up confessing she was starting to see someone, I hung up the phone and started playing Grid 2019, as thats far more entertaining"
anarchocapitalism,fd7pb1s,t3_dwhxy0,1578207988.0,"Ive seen quite the opposite affect. You see the white nationalist type rationalise their world view, then theyll become socdems, libertarians, ancaps, or agorists

Some do fall in the marx-mao rabbit hole, sadly"

relationships,fd3vezb,t3_ejzysz,1578161974.0,"My good friend is in the same exact situation but they are a year older. He tells me all the time about how frustrating it is to be made fun of by her friends, even though its her denying the experience. Even though its her body and choice, it's your choice to even put up with her choice in the first place. Don't necassarily give her an ultimatum but you do need to talk to her about this. If she gets upset or resentful then you should break up with her. If she gives a more sensible/rational response then I guess just deal with it until shes ready. The relationship is about the 2 of you, not her needs and not your needs. It's what both of you want and need. It's a compromise. At this stage in the game, it can't be ""my way or the highway"". But if it is, the highway will be the better option. 

As a disclaimer Im nonreligious so I do not understand the sentiment behind religious abstenince but I do respect it."

bipolar,dyy00ru,t3_8j1ka9,1526271883.0,"On my first trip to Canada I got pulled aside to secondary because it was my first time. I had already been up for 50 hours and I had heavy bags. I sat in secondary for roughly 4 hours. Phone dead, slight hallucinations, heart rabidly pounding. Then I get questioned. Everything from here on was a blur. All I remember after that was tumbling to the ground with no feeling in my arms, no breath, and a hatred for everything aroumd me. I wanted to die and I was terrified at the same time. That got detained and thrown in a remand centre for 2 days and a psych assessment (forcefully given by the Canadian government and I had to pay for it)"
