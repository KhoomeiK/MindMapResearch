The problem with China is that the average citizen rejects western medical science, they reject Germ Theory, they reject modern standards of hygiene and instead choose Traditional Chinese Medicine over it. Which is, for the most part, pseudo-scientific naturopathy. 

China is doggedly sticking with TCM and their disgusting ""wet markets"" which are breeding grounds for animal viruses. This is why China frequently produces viral epidemics. 

It's not about race, it's about the Chinese being pig headed about maintaining a few dangerous backward cultural practices.

Take a look at the ""wet markets"" footage and tell me isn't a biohazard catastrophy: https://youtu.be/VLp8CHeKQkI

TCM is why the Chinese want rhino horns, shark fins, bear gall bladder bile, tiger penises, and a variety of other body parts which have no medicinal properties whatsoever.

When Europeans landed in the Americas no one had any idea about germs, viruses and bacteria. So there was a built-in excuse. Whereas now we all know about germ theory.

Choosing to believe in (most aspects of)TCM over medical science is akin to believing the earth is flat or that vaccines cause autism. We should be highly critical of these ass backward beliefs as they affect the whole world."
