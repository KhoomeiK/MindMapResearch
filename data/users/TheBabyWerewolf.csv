instantkarma,fetpxax,t1_fetnizz,1579378182.0,Getting a professional training is the right thing. And honestly these problems are not ALWAYS the owners fault (of course there is abuse cases). It's really common for the breed in general. You're not an asshole at all

dogs,fek2gai,t3_epi99u,1579191188.0,"It kinda sounds like a lot of the problems come from the owners (You, or your parents). First off, dogs need a reliable and structured home. Which it sounds like isn't the case here. Dogs thrive with with routine. And you'll never get a regular routine with your dog living with your parents. 2nd there needs to be a proper introduction process when bringing a new dog into the home. How would you feel if you came home and some random guy had moved in? And 3rd, adult dogs are going to correct puppies. But it is the owners responsibility to step in when it's an over-correction. I'd say you need to re educate yourself on being a responsible dog owner, and possibly look into a behaviorist."

AmItheAsshole,fdnq8g8,t3_ema2lf,1578590779.0,"YTA! 

It's pretty clear that you are extremely controlling. 

Hopefully the poor girl never let's you back into her life."

dogs,fcm1ngt,t3_ehv3qs,1577761894.0,"I am a supervisor at a doggy daycare.  Dogs don't always act like they do at home as they do at daycare.  Daycare is not for every dog. But there was totally poor management of the play group. Handlers should totally be looking out for this sorta thing. I would suggest looking for a facility that offers tours, ask a ton of questions."
dogs,fburtoa,t3_eemtcp,1577119352.0,It sounds like you're not ready for a dog.
