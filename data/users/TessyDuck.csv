You are free to hate whoever you want, but society at large has the right to call you out for being a piece of shit. Hate should be marginalized, and society will continue to progress forward and beyond the necessity for people like you."

slaythespire,ff2cv5e,t1_ff2721p,1579501061.0,"I thought the same thing too, but I still think it is overall a net benefit most of the time. But the fun of the game is that no matter how good a relic or card is, there is a situation where taking it can be bad for you."
slaythespire,ff2cnx1,t1_ff27tqq,1579500853.0,"Having Well Laid Plans or Pyramid to retain it for when you need it helps, or a Liquid Memories to grab it when you need it. Most times though a hallway fight shouldn't last long enough to matter, and boss fights you have to pick the time to use it a little more depending on what else is going on with your deck. What Ascension do you play on? Because low ascension's, wrath form tends to be a bit worse to pick, because enemies and bosses aren't as punishing and there are easier alternatives to mitigate damage."
slaythespire,feuh0nh,t1_feub7d8,1579386501.0,"Skip is always an option, and often times the best option. Even a great card can make your deck worse if it doesn't fit your deck, or if you have to many copies of it already. Also try to prioritize removing Strikes when you get the chance. The more you play the more you'll learn what cards you should be taking based on what kinds of fights you expect to take."

slaythespire,fetvi1g,t1_fets07z,1579380485.0,"Sounds like your deck is inconsistent and bloated with unnecessary cards tbh. Bad draws are always a possibility, but if you are consistently losing because you can't block Automoton's damage, it definitely sounds like you either are not picking up enough sources of damage mitigation, have a deck that is larger than it needs to be so has inconsistent draws, or both."

If she isn't being a partner to you and isn't willing to be, you need to seriously look at getting a divorce attorney on retainer. I'm honestly not sure what she expects from you. You presumably have no control over the market. Does she want you to work an extra job so she can faff about? I know she is taking care of the house, but sounds like your kids are all older, so presumably there isn't as much work there. But just based on the info given, NTA."

Do you also belittle your husband over other minor mistakes? Stuff like that sticks with a person, I have an ex who did this and I still remember all the times she insulted me over trivial things. You don't call your partner stupid. You should have a conversation where you apologize for your reaction, and ask him to be more mindful in the future.

It'd be different if he was a decent dad who was making an effort and came to you asking to claim your son on taxes because he was in a financial bind, or even to ask for some of the refund.

That tax refund is meat to compensate lower/mid income families, and if you need it for you and your son I don't see why you would think you would be an asshole in this situation."

AmItheAsshole,fc6yidv,t3_eggu7q,1577492787.0,"NAH. Everyone has their own love language. You need to approach this situation carefully though, you don't want his daughter to feel rejected. I think you are going to have to learn to accept how his daughter wants to show affection with you. It sounds like she really loves you and enjoys spending time with you. But if you feel like you are getting over whelmed, you should also be able to have your own time, or time where it is just you and your SO. That's something you and your partner will have to discuss and work out with each other. Also, her sleeping habits don't sound terribly healthy. That's its own issue that would need to be worked on, but a kid shouldn't need to be cuddled or rocked to sleep at that age. All of this is easier said than done, but I think you need to have an honest discussion with your SO and go from there. You are going to be a part of this child's life if you get married, so you have to make your relationship with his daughter work. You could always go for a consultation with a therapist who can help you guys come to resolution. Therapy doesn't always have to be for extreme issues."
