I like Dr Greger but he does seem to be clearly biased to me. As you mentioned, there are ways to say that things like milk are good for you, as well as bad. Well, Dr. Greger will show everything that shows vegetables/soy is good, but rarely if ever show anything that shows milk is good, for instance.

He also is the one who led me to this confusion. See, he says that olive oil is bad and shows that fatty meals, high in monounsaturated fat (for instance) like olive oil can clog your arteries up and cause heart pain after just one meal. Ok, fine. So he doesn't recommend olive oil. But avocados, which have pretty much the same fat profile as olive oil, are fine. That doesn't make sense to me - you can't warn against one thing, then say another thing that's very similar is great for your health.

I do not recommend Greger’s website for any nutritional information/advice."")

[Olive oil is good for you](https://theskepticalcardiologist.com/2015/08/04/the-incredibly-bad-science-behind-dr-esselstyns-plant-based-diet/) and Dr. Mcdougall's advice (someone who seems quite highly regarded on subs like this) is [bad science](https://theskepticalcardiologist.com/2015/08/04/the-incredibly-bad-science-behind-dr-esselstyns-plant-based-diet/)

He is saying it’s the cholesterol count or number of particles because a high count (assuming total amount is the same) means they are small and a low count means they are large. But small and large are both atherogenic and reducing both is ideal. Furthermore there is no evidence that shifting particle size reverse atherosclerosis but we know reducing LDL can.

There's a very real chance I'm being dumb here, but I will persist in the hopes of learning something. You are characterising what he said as though he thinks the size of LDL particles and how much cholesterol they hold, the LDL-C, is what matters. Akin to saying that bullet size matters, not the total amount of them. But what he specifically said is:

>Recent studies show that LDL particle number is the problem

LDL particle number, or LDL-P, refers to the number of particles and not their size, right? So he's saying the opposite - that it is the number of them, the number of bullets if you will, and not their size or concentration (LDL-C) that matters. He didn't even mention size. Unless I'm missing something, which again is likely, it seems he has actually agreed with you. 

I'm just having a really hard time getting my head around this, part of it may be the terminology, as LDL is often used on its own to mean LDL-C. Bluntly, what do you think matters most - the amount of cholesterol that each LDL particle carries on average, or the amount of LDL particles that exist in total?

It's all so confusing to me as if you go to a site like nutritionfacts.org (obviously has a pro-plant based diet agenda but the doctor seems genuinely concerned for public health and focused on evidence to me) you'll find endless studies and analysis on why saturated fat is harmful. Then I can easily go to some other site promoting keto diets or whatever that says completely the opposite. Based on what you've read, what do you think is the healthiest diet?"
nutrition,fe0rj48,t1_fe0c977,1578817768.0,"The problem for me is that both sides argue that it's not conflicted and has been settled, with folks who support high fat or keto diets etc often saying that the organisations supporting the current low-fat ideas are outdated and their views based on old lies paid for by sugar companies, or otherwise sponsored by grain companies etc. Both sides seem to make some very convincing arguments. Did you see those meta analyses? Of all the ones we have available in the last decade, most seem to say there's no connection, is it really fair to just bat them all away as propaganda?

Examine.com has a pretty good reputation around here I think. A good, in-depth site that is seen as unbiased and unsponsored. [Here's their article on saturated fat](https://examine.com/nutrition/is-saturated-fat-bad-for-you/)

>There is not enough evidence to directly link saturated fat with positive or negative effects on heart health. Compared to monounsaturated fat (MUFAs) and omega-6 polyunsaturated fat (n-6 PUFAs), saturated fat (SFAs) does increase several risk factors for heart disease. However, compared to n-6 PUFAs only, SFAs also reduce some risk factors. In other words, eating more MUFAs appears to have the most favorable effect on risk factors for heart disease overall, whereas SFAs and n-6 PUFAs are on relatively equal footing."

If animals were so much more efficient than us at creating life, wouldn't it make more sense for us to just abolish all farms and instead of livestock farmers and such, instead just have legions of hunters to hunt all the naturally-produced animals for meat?

Boris has made a few token statements so far (just like Theresa May did after getting in, just like all the promises about lowering immigration and building starter homes in the past that didn't happen) and these statements are notable why?
