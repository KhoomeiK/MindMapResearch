Ninjago,fffb8zf,t3_et64rs,1579880145.0,"She’s voiced maya, and Edna in the past. But Edna isn’t Jays real mom. I doubt it’ll be her...specially because of Scott. In the short Jay called him brother in one of the shorts. However! Jays real mom in season 7 was already played by Kelly. 

So I’ve dropped it down to it either being Maya, or Coles mom

My theory: Jillian will be playing Maya and Coles mom in a flash back of the old ninja."
Ninjago,fffax1c,t1_ffeikxl,1579879930.0,"Nope she’s speaking for season 12 which is obviously a Jay season so I expect the flash back will show the old ninja. Jillian Michaels player Maya and Kelly played Jays mom previously. So it’s dropped down to Maya or Coles mom. Although it’s not totally impossible for
Jillian to play both Maya AND Coles mom."
Ninjago,fffaonr,t1_ffew9wt,1579879784.0,The trailer is soon. So I expect if the trailers to be out soon then the episodes will follow at least a month later.
