minnesota,ff9lbt7,t3_ery9ps,1579715410.0,"99% of the people on my Friend's list are former classmates, co-workers, and family. Out of them, I know most are friends with their neighbors and regularly have cookouts, campfires, and drinks at each other's houses. Others have joined workout programs, running, or bike riding groups and do events with the other members and have become friends that way as well. I just moved to a new development and am friendly with my neighbors, but no parties yet."

minnesota,ff9knab,t1_ff9auug,1579715009.0,"The biggest difference with the Catholic Church is that all archdioceses are connected and fall under Rome. Moving a problem priest to a new location is easy, but the parishoners hear rumors about the ""new"" priest's last parish and ask around. There's a hierarchy that has long protected those priests and they should be held accountable. Protestant churches are more independent, so firing a pastor is easy and quiet."

minnesota,ff9jh97,t3_es592k,1579714321.0,"Mall of America's Entertainment District on the 4th Floor was awesome back in the late 90s. You could club hop up there without having to pay multiple cover charges. Then, Bloomington instituted a smoking ban. People stopped going there to party on the weekends and it completely died off. It might have survived if the State had a smoking ban first."
