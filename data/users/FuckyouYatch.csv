**First what the cue ball will do after you hit it.. and that comprehends 3 rules:**

30-degree rule:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgKD-nqKTlQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgKD-nqKTlQ)

tangent line or 90-degree rule:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_3NnmvKAIXU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3NnmvKAIXU)

3 times the angle rule:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37OKxcHCEC8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37OKxcHCEC8)

A good drill for this is the wagon wheel so you test if you really can predict where the cueball is going to end:

**Second is when you should draw, follow or stun. And that comes with experience and learning to know which side to play, also a shit ton of speed control.**

That is called pattern play and here are some videos about it, I would also recommend buying Tor Lowrey pattern puzzle book since I think that has helped me a lot to understand more and control my speed.

**First what the cue ball will do after you hit it.. and that comprehends 3 rules:**

30-degree rule:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgKD-nqKTlQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgKD-nqKTlQ)

tangent line or 90-degree rule:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_3NnmvKAIXU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3NnmvKAIXU)

3 times the angle rule:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37OKxcHCEC8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37OKxcHCEC8)

A good drill for this is the wagon wheel so you test if you really can predict where the cueball is going to end:

**Second is when you should draw, follow or stun. And that comes with experience and learning to know which side to play, also a shit ton of speed control.**

That is called pattern play and here are some videos about it, I would also recommend buying Tor Lowrey pattern puzzle book since I think that has helped me a lot to understand more and control my speed.

 It is better to try to do a stop shot on this straight in shots to find any failures in your stroke or aiming. Your cueball going to the left or right after the shot means you are not hitting the object ball dead center. So if in any of these you tried to hit center on the OB you are definitely not achieving it. 

Now you aim and think where you want to hit the object ball, then you shot and stayed down on the shot, are you seeing that you are in fact hitting where you intended to hit?

&#x200B;

I would suggest trying to find your dominant eye or vision center because that might be messing with your alignment.

Get also some hole reinforcement stickers and place the OB and the CB on a straight shot at a relatively short distance, then on the same straight line keep putting the CB a little farther over and over and try to do a stop shot, if the cueball is left spinning or is going in another direction perpendicular to that straight line to the pocket means that you are not hitting dead center on the OB"
