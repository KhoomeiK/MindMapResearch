We figured out that instead of just ignoring when the other had one, wed make a large of a fuzz about it as possible. Which made you irritaded and angry. 

Thing is, if your body is dumping a shit ton of adrenaline into your system, being angry channels it in another was, and you forget the undescribable sense of dread much faster than if you try to internalize it while worrying about if someone notices it, the shame, etc. 

This evoled into a mindset of ""panic attack? Well do ypur worse brain you stupid fuck""
