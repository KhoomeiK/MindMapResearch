I thought, everything would be better if I just lost 60 pounds. But I was more than 60 pounds smaller for quite some time and hated my body just the same. It rarely is about the real situation, more about your state of mind about it. Maybe the same thing happens with depression. No matter your situation, you find stuff to feel bad about, and to feel guilty, and jealous and everything. Rich people become depressed, poor people become depressed. Happy families don‚Äôt cure depression, bad families do not have to induce it. No matter the situation, feelings are valid and real. Especially when focussing on people that have it worse, guilt can start to destroy the mind even more. I just think that no matter your situation, best in the world, or worst, you can feel like shit, and you can feel like ending it all. But everyone can get better, and everyone deserves the help they need (though many people do not have access..).

Sometimes other adults would say I had to do sth ‚Äúbecause they said so‚Äù, which led to me losing a lot of respect for them, while simultaniously connecting following the rule with how much respect I had for that person. If my mother had used this sentence once, I might have been confused but would have followed, because I knew she‚Äôd explain it later and there was some reason she couldn‚Äôt do so at the time. If a random adult had used it, I would probably follow the rule on the outside but do anything to annoy and disobey them, just out of spite.

AspiePartners,fe7ntts,t3_entug5,1578917179.0,"In the beginning of our relationship, it was like that with me and my partner. I was in your girlfriends position. I don‚Äôt really get what certain facial expressions mean, and I used to always think it was my fault, because it seemed better to apologize one (or 100) times too often than not enough. But that meant I already always felt like a burden to him, which in his eyes I was not at all. So when he said anything criticising of me, even in the slightest, it felt like I was not worth anything. He felt pretty much exactly like you describe you are feeling. For us, talking, discussing and lots of explaining was the answer. We talked about how we generally feel, we talked about what we mean with certain facial expressions, we talked about how we feel when feeling down, out of it, stuff like that. Plus, and I am sure that helped, I got medication against depression and anxiety prescribed. That medication has slightly stabilized my mood, which helped a lot. Oh, and something very important for me was that he started to always warn me. He won‚Äôt just casually mention I did something to annoy him, or hurt him, or whatever, he first says there‚Äôs something he wants to tell me, but it might hurt my feelings. Then I can brace myself, take a mental step back from my feelings and look at the situation more objectively. With all this, we are now frequently talking about issues I thought I would never be able to articulate. And I‚Äôm more self aware now, too, (therapy is a great source of help, too!) so I can tell him when I feel particularly vulnerable, sad, anxious, depressed,... and he‚Äôs starting to do so, too (because he has some moods where he can happen to say quite some hurtful stuff, but I can now manage those moods easily when prepared). 

So tldr: I was your girlfriend in that situation, and therapy, medication, but mostly lots of talking, explaining and working together helped me and my partner. But we both love to be philosophical and analytical about many topics, that‚Äôs what made it the best tool for us I think."
