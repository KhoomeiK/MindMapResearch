college,ffprf0i,t3_eu6v9a,1580103031.0,"Honestly I find college easier. I was in five/six APs and a DE my junior and senior years, and while HS wasn't particularly hard, college is easier, with caveats. Time management is MUCH more important, and professors don't care enough to extend deadlines unless you make the effort to get to know them and get involved in the class. They're more than willing to fail people here, so keep that in mind/"

Militaryfaq,ffowc90,t3_eueybu,1580082554.0,"There are non-tabbed infantry PLs, so you'll still get a platoon. Officers usually get DNRd if they fail a school, so don't fucking fail."

They wouldn't really be accepted, at least until that individual could prove themselves, and even then, they'd still be distrusted."
