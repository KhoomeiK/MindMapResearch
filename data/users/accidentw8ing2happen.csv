chess,fgl8p3f,t1_fgkyumm,1580886029.0,"In theory yes, a 100 point difference means that 64% of wins will go to the higher ranked player, it doesn't matter if they are 1400-1500 or 2700-2800.

For what it's worth, for me once I recognized it, it became so much easier to fight the tendancy to continue the cycle."
