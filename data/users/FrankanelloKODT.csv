You just have to grind a little to get gems, learn the stages and compete in the leagues. I’ve unlocked over 80% of both clubs and balls without spending massive amounts of money.

Sound like OP is just impatient"

GolfBattle,felvae8,t1_felsmwp,1579231813.0,"Agree, the 750 gold chests are far more worth it, and chances are youâ€™ll get 4 VIP things you didnâ€™t have before for 750 gems. Iâ€™ve had a lot of VIP chests (lots of grinding the leagues), just opened one the other day when they were on special and STILL got 4 things I didnâ€™t already have"

Then everyone knows you drive an auto."
FinalFantasyVIII,fdtg353,t1_fdr863d,1578716255.0,Thanks for the tip! Unfortunately Iâ€™m in New Zealand so is a bit far to go
FinalFantasyVIII,fdpuyba,t1_fdoqj83,1578641541.0,Iâ€™d love to see it played live; the videos Iâ€™ve seen look epic!
FinalFantasy7,fdpusc4,t1_fdptd8c,1578641342.0,I whistle that tune too! Tifaâ€™s theme in Advent Children is beautiful
FinalFantasy7,fdpghhv,t1_fdpfmh9,1578628005.0,"I think [Fight On](https://open.spotify.com/track/31151IsCwesiijMUVo6BJy?si=tT83_m8bTOeLbRgrXsZ7Ag) is some of the best boss battle music ever made.
OWA is just a classic, hey!"

FinalFantasyVIII,fdp9mo2,t1_fdovthi,1578623227.0,It gets you pondering the battles to come. Good choice
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp9km5,t1_fdow20j,1578623188.0,Blue Fields is my FF8 default song in my head when I first think of the game. Nice choice
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp97ss,t1_fdp93xh,1578622959.0,"Hahah cool; I think itâ€™s called shuffle or boogie

*boingbanoingbanoingbanoing*   lol"
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp939c,t1_fdp7i8i,1578622875.0,"Very nice; I had literally JUST finished listening to the Distant Worlds FH theme, very nice indeed.

Of the distant worlds pieces, one winged angel takes the throne for me; such a beautiful, powerful piece of music"
Morrowind,fdp66zw,t1_fdoyomq,1578620935.0,"Unless you have the sight, or youâ€™ve spoken to someone prior, I think everyone gets wrecked in that first hideout. I love how humbling that first experience is before you realize that you. Ainâ€™t. Shit."
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp53dt,t1_fdp4uhw,1578620194.0,"Bahahahaha that was good!

That tune always make me wanna move!!"
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp1mbx,t1_fdowk5k,1578617844.0,I love your selections; Ami and Balamb Garden are great and breezy is simple and effective. Reminds me of the coastal breeze.
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp1ivj,t1_fdow4uz,1578617780.0,"Very nice, good choice"
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp1a2r,t1_fdosohe,1578617617.0,Nice; slow start then BAM action time!
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp16ex,t1_fdorx2h,1578617548.0,"Roses and wine is a nice piece; Iâ€™m going to try and learn some of these though Iâ€™m not much a pianist, I may be able to learn a version on guitar"
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp13s9,t1_fdopqw3,1578617499.0,"Right on.

I havenâ€™t  played dissidia yet but yeah I agree with the intro, great way to open a game"
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp0z3r,t1_fdoql18,1578617412.0,This one is significant for me because when the demo came out displaying the intro it gave me chills seeing the (at the time) pinnacle of console graphics at play. Coupled with a brilliant piece of music I KNEW this game was gonna be awesome. Was not disappointed
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp0s68,t1_fdou8qu,1578617283.0,"Awesome story behind your choice; Those tense moments are amplified with the right music backing it. I appreciate hearing everybodyâ€™s thought on their memorable tunes, thanks for the suggestion!"
FinalFantasyVIII,fdp05ed,t1_fdozl7k,1578616862.0,Yeah thatâ€™s a good one; the Brothers quest.
Morrowind,fdoqfns,t3_emgju8,1578610536.0,"Ah yes, weâ€™ve been expecting you"
FinalFantasyVIII,fdop5qw,t1_fdooyxe,1578609761.0,I love your explanation. Itâ€™s amazing how much a good score can enhance visual content.
FinalFantasyVIII,fdop1ku,t1_fdooegz,1578609692.0,"I agree, many good tunes! I also like the FH theme, martial law and Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec; the battle in DELING CITY had the coolest FMV I had seen in a game up to that point

EDIT: changed Galbadia with Deling City"
FinalFantasyVIII,fdon9zn,t1_fdomfio,1578608624.0,"Thanks for the suggestion, Iâ€™ve edited the Original post. Why did you choose Compression of time?"
gifs,fdom2vm,t3_emdngg,1578607910.0,Best of luck guys; we in NZ are sending good vibes to you while you help out our cousins over the ditch
FinalFantasyVIII,fdolux4,t1_fdolj7f,1578607779.0,Nice; I went about 15years in between game plays; but if I heard this song it would remind me of Laguna swinging through the air doing his limit
FinalFantasyVIII,fdoksl2,t3_emcdqs,1578607146.0,"Perhaps if you want something as close to the original, then the original PS version is it.
I found the platinum version didnâ€™t work on PS2; it kept freezing in the garden battle FMV where troops abseil down the garden.

I like the remastered version; I just donâ€™t use the enc-none/3x/battle support modes as the game is easy enough as it is."

Really wished more ppl played fpp; tpp is not my cuppa tea but I hate 7min load times for a game more"
wholesomememes,fdm0dvr,t1_fdlx7q8,1578536822.0,Can relate; the blood runs too hot. Itâ€™s good for a little while as my wife runs a bit cold so I get 5-10mins of awesome cuddles before I start overheating both of us
wholesomememes,fdlhl62,t3_elx9wc,1578524184.0,Aaaaaand then off to play video games
FinalFantasyVIII,fdge61v,t1_fdg9yw0,1578392535.0,"Ok so [this link](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323446.php)  has the normal 6ft range slightly below 84kg. In saying that though; â€œnormalâ€ for someone 6ft 10 (like Ward) would be much bigger than the â€œnormalâ€ weight for someone 6ft 4 (84kg/185lb), and given Ward is supposed to be really strong and have lots of muscle then he would probably weigh much more then 185lb"
FinalFantasyVIII,fdfwpfx,t3_ekxz0z,1578372271.0,"Either they are very short, or they need a feed.
IIRC healthy weight for a 6ft male is around 80kg (in NZ)


Ok so Ward is supposedly 6ft10in and only weighs 84kg (185lb). Sounds a little off to me.
