TheRightCantMeme,ffgvxtc,t1_ffgv18r,1579916433.0,"Yea, the same side who voted against the 13th, the civil rights bill, started all 3 major parts of the KKK group, and were also all the same political party of the confederacy.

That same side. Let it sink in. Or not, you'll think all those were Republican ideas. When they were all started and are still run by Democrats. The entire reason there is a focus on firearms isn't because of mass shootings, or the violence. It is because firearm ownership of minorities has raised and neared that of whites. And it makes the actual democrats afraid."
TheRightCantMeme,ffgtd0f,t1_ffgsoqk,1579914555.0," Yes, let us focus on 0.0000000219% deaths a day in the US. Instead of real rights, problems like medical industry, insurance abuse, police violence.

But yea, you're right. That 0.0000000219% of deaths is far more important than the 1 in 10 chance your doctor fucks with your life because he didn't check your records. 26* deaths a year in mass shootings, and up to 440,000 a year in our medical system. So glad we aren't ignoring a real problem.

You're 100% right, those 948 people are far more important than the upwards of 17 million killed by medical staff in the same time frame. Lets focus on the real problem, ""mass shootings"". Not our medical industry."
TheRightCantMeme,ffgsib6,t1_fff6b55,1579913929.0,"How about we compare mass shooting deaths to medical malpractice.

1 in 10 people in the US suffer from medical malpractice. 250,000 to 440,000 a year die to these errors. The number of people who die in a mass shooting a year in the US. 25.6 average since 1982. Or 1 in 12,339,622.

Glad we are focusing on the real topic of mass shootings though."
TheRightCantMeme,ffgs7ip,t1_ffff7vm,1579913715.0,"Since 82,  948 have died in ""mass killings"". Meanwhile, 1,938\* have died to lightning strikes in the US in that same time."
worldpolitics,ffgpfua,t3_etaeuz,1579911728.0,"Hilarious considering, Dems were all confederates, dems voted against 13th, voted against civil rights. And continue to vote gun control because minorities have started to catch up in firearm ownership as whites.

Most racist group out right now are people pretending to not be racist. Democrats. Hell the KKK was made by Democrats and is still run by them."
science,ffeff9z,t3_eswz5j,1579845948.0,"Have some actual statistics.

0.000000350% people killed by rifles in US a day (out of 327 million)

0.0000384% Struck by lightning a day

0.0000000219% chance of dying in a mass shooting a day

0.00079% of being a death in a mass shooting if you live to be 100 years old.
