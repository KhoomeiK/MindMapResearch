borderlands3,fetljxk,t1_fepvjyv,1579376620.0,They actually put it as a keyframe too. When he fired his finger was on the trigger.
EscapefromTarkov,feped2n,t1_fepdo0b,1579318415.0,"Man, I feel kind of bad now."
EscapefromTarkov,fepbwxe,t3_eqaya1,1579316759.0,"Still pretty new, but heard that having ears was nice to have. And sure enough, gave this poor guy away."
facepalm,femtlk1,t1_femrrn3,1579269234.0,"Most of the time, especially with the Navy you have control over what your initial job is, if you can cross to a new rate (that's open) and also what commands you get to go to. It's not 100% every time for the commands part. But usually based on where you finish in the school for your job decides what order you get to pick the command list from.

Also you take a test prior to signing your contract, they list what you qualify for and you pick it. A lot of people just sign it so they can get it over with and end up in a rating/mos they fucking hate. Within my class for AT, out of both Navy and Marine side and a class of around 20 I was the only one with prior electrical experience."
facepalm,femrcsh,t1_femprq8,1579267393.0,"I was an electronics tech for search and rescue helicopters (AT-O). Not every job in the military is ""pewpew I'ma kill innocent civilians"" ya little shit."
facepalm,felmoaa,t1_felb5vk,1579225839.0,"That makes it a double win for anyone in the military. School plus housing gets paid for, AND you don't have to take those stupid prereq tests. You're just allowed in after a placement test to see if you need some remedial coursework.  


As a note, If I took full benefits and went to my local university I'd get 81,000 covered for school for 3 years and around another 70,000 covered for housing in that time. No loan."
politics,feivnd6,t1_feiv9it,1579148455.0,"Are you okay with the left bombing a power facility, or an armed group of masked thugs beating the shit out of media, and protesters because they don't like their opinion.

&#x200B;

If so, you're the problem."
politics,feiuueh,t1_feitspm,1579147823.0,"The militia is planning to storm because of the massive amounts of incorrect information being spewed about their hobby/past time. How would you feel if you spent several thousand of dollars on something you enjoyed. And the government wants to take it away because of extreme exaggerations related to it, and people who have not even the simplest form of understanding it.

It's actually quite fucking hilarious, considering if you held other things up to these standards, cars would be banned, alcohol would be banned, and freedom of speech sure as fuck would be banned. Not to mention a plethora of other activities that involve higher death rates. Hell lets make ladders illegal, Since there are 300+ deaths a year by those. Only 100 shy of rifles. Let's ban assault ladders!!"
politics,feisrz8,t1_feisgx5,1579146269.0,"Do you honestly know how many people a year are killed with ""assault rifles"" in the entire US. less than 500. More people die by fucking being beaten to death with fists. 500, and there are over 10 million estimated AR-15s (which is what you're afraid of). And over 300,000,000 firearms total, and 500 people a year died by the ""assault"" weapon you cry yourself to sleep over."
Virginia,feis4iv,t1_feir0lq,1579145806.0,"May sound barbaric, but with all the shit they get away with in courts. Maybe capital punishment and death penalties will get things right. Because slaps on the wrist and letting them go without any actual jail time because of connections and financials sure hasn't worked for our country for the past 60 years."
worldnews,fdur2hn,t1_fduq563,1578737661.0,"The only original report was them covering their ass. And everyone already knew what they had done, And yea. I guess a bomber would just appear from a civilian airbase, flying in the wrong direction."
furry_irl,fdug73s,t3_en3i7c,1578732493.0,"A weird thing is when your best friend doesn't like that side, but his best friend who is a eh friend to you has no problem with it."
worldnews,fduesk7,t1_fdudyxr,1578732047.0,"It was confirmed as soon as it happened. And the comment about the plane was ""wouldn't target civilians "" Learn to read dipshit."
worldnews,fdu6yov,t1_fdu5xo8,1578728666.0,"Put it down like a plane full of civilians. And then blame someones mum for it, since ya know she probably killed millions right?"
worldnews,fdu5rwa,t1_fdu4wtn,1578728055.0,"Again, recent fuck ups on a completely different platform. And yes, it's still libel, You even admit it in your own damn sentence. ""they blamed them because it's believable""."
MurderedByWords,fdu4xc6,t1_fdrql10,1578727613.0,"They told you that because they were making money on it. Same reason why all the trades in high school, and basic trade schools vanished. They turned them into certifications that cost hundreds to thousands of dollars and require a yearly or bi-yearly renewal. It's literally them profiting off shit they got for free."
worldnews,fdu4do4,t1_fdu3hon,1578727328.0,"On a completely different aircraft. That is the entire point. A 737-800 and a 737-MAX, the 737-800 that was shot down has been flying since 1998, over 22 years ago for it's first flight. The 737-MAX launched in 2016. That's why there is a shit storm around it.

Again, trying to pit the problems of the MAX for a 800 class crash is stupid. And entirely like what I stated. Fucking with their stocks on a well known and well received platform as a scapegoat is fucked up and how you destroy a company completely."
worldnews,fdu33jr,t1_fdu2lpq,1578726673.0,That's like claiming someone is a child rapists when they are being charged for j-walking.
worldnews,fdplk8y,t1_fdjdiqa,1578632017.0,"No, the over 170 passengers that have been confirmed to have been shotdown by Iran. But you won't admit it now despite it being fact."
worldnews,fdkt289,t1_fdjsylc,1578510565.0,"If you understood even the basic concepts of war you would get that ""innocent"" people don't stay innocent for long. One looses their loved one they attack back, another looses theirs. Back and forth leading to only one real option.

Either kill everyone on the other side, or your entire side gets killed. Simple literal fact."
news,fdjcvxb,t1_fdj9azb,1578465665.0,"Hey, maybe you'll be the next target."
worldnews,fdjbywh,t1_fdjb97e,1578464728.0,"Right, guess that plane that went down was full of military personnel."
worldnews,fdjaur9,t1_fdj7z9x,1578463623.0,"It means, they will kill you just because you're an American. They always had that intention, doesn't matter who is in charge, or who you voted for. You are a target. Dipshit."
worldnews,fdj4dmp,t1_fdipggt,1578458126.0,"They won't care if you support Trump, Putin or a tiger on a box of cereal when they decide to attack you personally. But you're too damn stupid to understand what their attack actually means."
PoliticalHumor,fdira1q,t1_fdgsl9b,1578449271.0,Or the pathetic Left.
worldpolitics,fdir5tw,t1_fdhyeec,1578449197.0,"Yea, that's kind of how it works? What do you go to work and not get paid? I know that's a left idea and you're probably all for it. But come the fuck on."
worldpolitics,fdiqzzf,t1_fdiptvv,1578449092.0,"The people who join to play soccer aren't putting their lives on the line, giving a shiny piece of metal and a piece of paper to someone who does is kind of the least they could fucking do."
thecyclegame,fdbzfvj,t1_fd920t4,1578264265.0,The ASP Flechette Gun. I have it setup to do more PvP damage.

thecyclegame,fcpokye,t3_eigb18,1577868775.0,There is just something fun about watching a player and then taking their work and loot.
thecyclegame,fcewe3h,t1_fcesbn3,1577624338.0,"Ship was called in with like 6 minutes left, which was already weird. So either there was an enemy stuck in the walls somewhere, or the entire match was bugged out."
thecyclegame,fcepmvq,t3_eh5fho,1577622630.0,"Not sure what happened. Everything was clear, but no ship showed at extract. Ended up just being an all out fight at the end."
