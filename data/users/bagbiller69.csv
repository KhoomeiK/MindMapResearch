bridezillas,fglkal6,t3_ez4vpi,1580901903.0,"Homegirl sounds like a clinical narcissist. The overwhelming obsession with herself, the lack of awareness, the sense of superiority but also I sense she thinks everyone is out to get her? 
Sounds incredibly toxic. I’m so sorry you had to deal with her at your wedding. At the end of the day, it totally makes sense that you keep her around for old time’s sake, but keep your own worth in mind. Misery loves company, and your friend is clearly obsessed with remaining sad and miserable. It’s already impacted you for so long as you’ve held your tongue. You certainly would be justified if you chose to confront her on her passive aggression and establish boundaries prior to the wedding. Your mental health is worth the temporary discomfort of confrontation."

Advice,ffp8fhq,t3_eugh1h,1580088807.0,"I’m so sorry to hear you’re feeling down and out! I know how you feel and it’s not fun :( I’ve come to realize the hospitality industry can be really profitable if you are in the right area. Cities such as Austin, Denver and Phoenix are where you can easily make a career in hospitality because they are popular tourist hubs with reasonable costs of living. I know this wasn’t exactly one of your options, but White Lodging, Four Seasons and Kimpton have super strong career paths and are very present in these metroplexes. You could totally land a full time gig and be able to afford an apartment/basic luxuries working in these areas (and probably others but I can only speak to these cuties). 

On the other hand, the corporate party/wedding industry is the place to be. I work at a very popular wedding related company and certainly attest to what a grind it is to start an event business, but if you are committed to networking and doing your research to be efficient and competitive in a very saturated market, you can be full time within a year. It’s scary at first but I would recommend perhaps getting a job as a server at a nice restaurant in a business class area, where you can get to know regulars who could connect you with potential clients. It’s also (depending on where you live) reasonable to make a living waiting tables at night and working on your business during the day. 

All that said, again I’m so sorry to hear you’re in a funk. It’s never fun to feel like your degree isn’t performing the way you expected, but you got this!! Feel free to hit me up if you want someone to bounce ideas off of"

ExpectationVsReality,ffjqtas,t1_ffjkdt5,1580004563.0,"That’s good to hear. I mean his brash lack of professionalism is definitely those most noteworthy part of experience. But from a review standpoint, you would have been more than justified in leaving a negative review even if he agreed to refund you and apologized profusely. If the job of the salon is to give you dope ass hair, and they give you bAd hair, then they did not succeed. You paid them for one thing. It’s totally fair to warn others that their time, effort and hair could be better treated elsewhere based on your experience."
ExpectationVsReality,ffjj7dd,t1_ffjhzzn,1579999436.0,"Reviews are designed to inform other potential customers about what their experience may be like. It’s word of mouth, not a business transaction. Technically him refunding her the money could be perceived as a bribe, which doesn’t exactly sound like an honest businessman trying to rectify a job poorly done. 

That said, him refunding her the money doesn’t change the fact that he did an awful job, had to be convinced to take responsibility, embarrassed her in front of other clients and would have probably never refunded her had she not threatened his businesses reputation. 

If you had a horrible experience at a business, wouldn’t you warn others?"

Never once looked back on school and thought “wow, that relationship wasn’t a giant distraction from growing myself.” I’m 22 now and feel like I was 15 years old like 6 months ago. I shit you not, these years it is disproportionately crucial for you to focus on yourself. Indulge yourself when the time comes, but if someone wants to fuck around and leave you high and dry, Irish exit. You don’t have to block them or even tell them necessarily, just allow them to show their true colors in their time. If they’re worth it at this age, they won’t keep you guessing."
