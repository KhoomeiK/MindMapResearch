I think in the meantime you could try wwoof-ing (Wordwide Opportunities on Organic Farms) to give you experience in growing food and living off land from people who know how before setting out on your own."

GetMotivated,ffbm5fq,t3_esm9dg,1579772173.0,"Nah. I definitely have things that I regret doing that are part of my character now, that I have to explain. 

Sometimes I hate that I'm an honest person it seems so much easier because other people get to clear their slate and let things go and I just have to be buried in regrets.

I don't get to have forgiveness for what I did even if I didn't know it was wrong at the time.

Anxiety,ff4rchr,t3_ercttk,1579570586.0,"Be careful. Meeting strangers from online is still a risky proposition. Hopefully you're still telling people where you're going and when to expect you back when meeting someone new at least.

But also, I hope it is motivating you to get out and just do things just for yourself.

I'm just saying this because I have lost focus this way as well."

I just like salt, pepper, garlic powder, shred. cheddar, pickapeppa sauce, couple generous tablespoons of mayo and a dash of ranch.

My mom has ""her"" traditional recipe for holiday mac and cheese that gets brought out so I never bring that. (I'll eat hers but I find it bland. It is very popular with little kids though.)
