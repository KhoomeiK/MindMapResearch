SkincareAddiction,fdyzgve,t1_fdxg9q1,1578785159.0,"Not op.

Night: Wash face > toner > TO Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA (good for hyperpygmentation. Works best together with TO Azeliac acid). Let it dry, apply TO azeliac acid after and moisturizer.

Morning: Wash face > toner > TO Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA >  TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% > moisturizer > sunscreen.

For acne skincare, buy TO salicylic acid,  TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% and chemical peeling TO AHA/BHA solution (use only 1-2 times a week)."

SkincareAddiction,fcw8mv6,t1_fcvppoy,1578019658.0,"Facial wash, toner, TO salicylic acid and Niacinimide 10% + Zinc 1% for acne, a good moisturizer and sunscreen!

TO 30% AHA 2% BHA 1-2 times a week. (Warning! You will feel a burning sensation if you use it on active acne scars / scars in general. Absolutely HELL but will only last for a couple minutes). Wash it off after 10 minutes, dont let it over dry on your face for too long. You dont need 2x bottles of TO 30% AHA 2% BHA lmao it will probably last you more than a year. Read the package carefully.

Edit: TO salicylic acid is spot treatment. Use it on active acnes and then Niacinimide to calm the redness (can use all over the face). Btw, Vitamin C serum counter Niacinimide. So, never use Vitamin C and Niacinimide together.

My top 3 fast and effective acne treatment products TO 30% AHA 2% BHA, TO salicylic azid and Niacinimide+zinc. Do this skincare routine for like 1-2 weeks and see a fast results."
