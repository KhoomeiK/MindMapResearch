While I’m at it—yes my above line is immature but really the only thing worth my time typing to you specifically that represents the uncalled for nature of your comment, like holy shit, that just hurt like hell because of how untrue it is and how you just proclaimed your unworthy prophetic dickheadedness—for those whose reading comprehension and objective interpretation of someone’s written word allows them to understand, my differentiation of the diagnoses is simply for organization. 

When a developmental ped or clinical psychologist is evaluating a child, or when anyone who is formally working with the child, there are labels such as asperger’s vs autism that allows for an immediate judgement on what to expect, what to predict and how to approach further evaluation and/or treatment/therapy. Typically, aspergers is designated with similar attributes as autism, but defining factors such as cognitive and/or language delay are what set 2 individuals apart. Although some argue there is no difference, officially, per our clinical psych AND developmental ped, there is autism and there is aspergers and the distinction is helpful in categorizing for evaluation and study purposes, as well as organization for treatment, because they 100% are treated differently according to the doctors and therapists we work with in our state. 

Some Google tips: if you google “is aspergers the same as autism?” You will get results likely related to them being the same. If you Google “the difference in Aspergers and autism” you also will get confounding results. There are doctors who do not agree with the DSM in terms of the 2 disorders. According to ours, the argument is still being made to revert the change made in the 5th edition."
