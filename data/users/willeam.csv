mentalhealth,fdwehbr,t3_en6r3s,1578757871.0,"Do you know that mental health is not merely the absence of mental illnesses? People misunderstand the definition of mental health.

Let me share with you and please share with others the new definition of mental health.

Mental health is a dynamic state of internal equilibrium which enables individuals to use their abilities in harmony with universal values of society. 

Basic cognitive and social skills; ability to recognize, express and modulate one's own emotions, as well as empathize with others; flexibility and ability to cope with adverse life events and function in social roles; and harmonious relationship between body and mind represent important components of mental health which contribute, to varying degrees, to the state of internal equilibrium.

Unfortunately people with certain mental illnesses shy away from people, unable to empathize, dysfunctional, unmotivated etc.

On the other hand, we need to acquire many living skills which we might not care like communication skills, empathy, problem-solving etc.

In addition you can use cognitive ability as you learn from CBT to manage your thoughts.

Do you know how to manage the negative emotions? If not, wouldn't it got worse?

The thing is that we have to learn to maintain mental health in response to mental disorder or stress.

Although stress is not a mental illness but it could affect the state of internal equilibrium when one could not cope with adversity or challenges.

I think that mental health is part of self growth. Mental illnesses affect self esteem and life but our skills could help us to response effectively to them.

Even so called normal people are criticized by others. But we should respond to the negative reaction or comments. They are the ones who need to change their attitudes and behavior due to their own ignorance of mental health.

Maybe they themselves have mental issues. We could live up to the challenges of life when we have the right skillset and attitude."

Although CBT and medication are the common treatment for it, the time has come for a solution that meets the needs of younger patients who live apps that brings solution into their cellphones.

Depending on the country, treatment cost is different for current treatment but it is still costly nonetheless.

Research has shown that mobile app for treating depression is workable ranging from eCBT to mindfulness to journaling. But the adoption is still low. It is similar to the early days of e-commerce.

So now is the best time to build niche in mental health using apps and then cast the net wiser over time.

Why I think my sound wave technology could change the face of treatment for depression: voice related behavior is becoming a trend; think of Amazon Alexa, just say what you want.

Secondly using sound wave as an adjunct therapy could become the standard of treatment like medicinal AI in the near future. Watch these developments closely if you want to build the next Unicorn.

So why you might consider working with me? I have unique technology that could build a blue market and it could scale very quickly as more and more people discover that they could treat themselves using just their own voice through the app and it is a growing trend I believe.

depression,fdttsu3,t1_fdti97t,1578722088.0,"According to one study: These results suggest that excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with current and lifetime depressive, but not anxiety disorders. Clinically, this highlights the need to take into account the possible bidirectional relationship between depressive disorders and excessive sleepiness when assessing mental health issues in patients with EDS.

So we should make sure we have good enough sleep. Perhaps EDS is co risk factor for depression. Why? 

E.g. EDS is also associated with obesity/diabetes independent of whether sleep-disordered breathing is present. Obese people are also prone to depression.

So it could be due to EDS plus negative self esteem leading to higher risk of Depression for people with metabolic factors like diabetes.

So it is better to reduce any co-risk factors for depression like lack of sleep due to sleep deprivation. 

But when we have EDS, we have to check if we have depression even if it is mild or subclinical depression.

So prevention is better than cure. IF it is due to generic factor, it is still important to reduce any risk factors. Maybe your diet lacks potassium.

mentalhealth,fcq9sl4,t3_ei5tc3,1577881749.0,"Getting treatment matters but no one talks about prevention. How? Self awareness about negative thoughts-emotions connection.

If you keep thinking negatively, you would feel sad and down, right? Maybe for weeks. If you don't know what to do about the rumination, then you're doomed.

One way is to reframe how you see a situation. Let's say you lose a job, you could keep thinking how bad your boss and government are and keep blaming everyone.

What's the consequence? You might have moderate depression and stop looking for new jobs or opportunities. You lose motivation and hope.

On the other hand you could reframe the situation as an opportunity to seek greener pasture. You could think: it is a chance for me to change career or job. Losing the job is a done deal. The past is past. I am so ready for the future.

You got it. We react to what happened most of the time. Reframing is a response to what has happened. It's a skill we could learn and master.

The other thing that I use for myself is voice therapy that modulates my negative emotions. After the short therapy using my own voice and listen to the modulated voice, I feel good regardless of the negative thoughts/memories which we cannot erase.

This prevents any chance of rumination.

Reframing is cognitive and voice modulation is affective. This combination of cognitive-affective skills are working well for me.

Sadly we might have inadequate skills for good mental health that we never learn in schools or anyone.

Prevention is better than cure. Of course cure you must regardless of how long you have been depressed.

Think of it as mental habits that are destructive if you like. After all childhood trauma could lead to many mental issues.
