mentalhealth,ffasjje,t1_ff4jk8l,1579743491.0,"I know it sucks. You have to address the psychological distress, or it could be a symptom of a bigger condition (such as somatisation, which I have)."
EA_NHL,ff93kj2,t1_ff8z9hp,1579703994.0,"Actually, only my last goal was in PP. And it wasn’t like he started pulling his goalie or playing stupid. I guess ice tilt helped me a bit."
nihilism,ff93fys,t3_es2isw,1579703905.0,"Thanks, because it means my devastating mental illness doesn’t matter"
EA_NHL,ff5lbr6,t1_f5zarkw,1579598457.0,"I got such a situation now in one of my games and it ended up being an automatic goal as you say. This should have been implemented years ago already, in my opinion, but I’m happy they finally did it."
mentalhealth,ff3gdfj,t1_ff3d00z,1579540484.0,"There’s no point. I’ve tried various anti-depressants and even Ketamine which goes through your arm, and nothing’s worked. Medicine can’t cure mental health conditions, sadly."
mentalhealth,ff2oaq9,t3_er56ob,1579516100.0,It’s a response to psychological stress. The brain shuts down to disengage from the world and protect you from stimulation. It’s essentially a ”Stop! Calm down!” message.
nihilism,ff1003g,t1_ff0xi66,1579473918.0,Interesting in a way because what exactly is white? We experience the world differently through our senses.
nihilism,ff0z1aq,t1_ff0wh9e,1579473691.0,"To be certain is to blindly accept a story. It’s to have faith in something. Certainty, in the literal sense, to me is ridiculous."
nihilism,fextrqq,t1_fes1vmm,1579436024.0,Meaning - The biggest dogmatic lie in human society.
mentalhealth,fesw6mw,t1_fesjxqm,1579369640.0,It’s easier to push issues away or make them seem less complex or easier to deal with.
mentalillness,feoec5d,t3_eq58ab,1579299001.0,It’s a weird experience. I can’t even find my self. Feel just awfully generally confused about my mental state.
nihilism,femhyx7,t1_fem7pw1,1579256522.0,"Science is not knowledge if you require knowledge to be infallibly true. Science is a working model to understand the external world, but any scientific models are vulnerable to potential future falsification from new data. Science is based on a limited amount of data that is at best probable evidence in favour of a theory or model, but it can’t provide absolute certainty about things."
nihilism,fek8e4m,t1_fek7uij,1579194750.0,Not exactly. He said ”I neither know nor think that I know.”
nihilism,fejw6qb,t1_fejj37z,1579187253.0,I know nothing more than a dead person.
nihilism,fejio6z,t1_fejienl,1579175940.0,I know nothing about reality.
nihilism,fejek8l,t1_fej0l1u,1579170278.0,I know nothing besides this statement.
EA_NHL,fehssda,t3_ep2iwe,1579123155.0,It should only be available to the most skilled players.
nihilism,feh5d8p,t1_feh3gar,1579109480.0,That’s moral relativism.
pics,feay1vu,t3_eo7hqh,1578953400.0,I just felt like stoppin’.
SuicideWatch,fe8m3n1,t3_eo0v3v,1578927777.0,"I’m fucked with my somatic illness, which leaves me paralysed by fatigue, numbed out and overwhelmed with other physical symptoms. I wish I could just die to escape this mess. There’s no way it’s going to get better. I’ve been like this for many years and the symptoms go up and down in intensity. I feel guilty because my parents treat me as though it’s not really an issue and merely blame my autism. The only thing keeping me from doing it is that it would hurt my parents."
EA_NHL,fe4l2ab,t3_en9jxq,1578860459.0,The million dollar question though: Did you end up winning?
EA_NHL,fdyx9pv,t1_fdwsevu,1578784493.0,That’s what you get for not being serious until the horn sounds :)
EA_NHL,fdqr9th,t1_fdqe1k3,1578673177.0,EA in a nutshell
SuicideWatch,fdn3jy6,t1_fdn1057,1578576248.0,"Somatoform disorder. Basically you have medically unexplainable physical symptoms such as fatigue, tingling, numbness and vision problems."
nihilism,fdlt18g,t1_fdlmsh2,1578531805.0,Are you implying that everything is meaningless or that it contradicts this?
nihilism,fdlctpe,t1_fdlatb5,1578521284.0,I hate being questioned and confronted so much and aggressively. I just want to be on my own.
SuicideWatch,fdl9rqy,t1_fdkth8x,1578519469.0,My extreme somatic mental health condition. I feel destroyed and broken beyond hope.
SuicideWatch,fdl3gky,t1_fdh7s1b,1578516410.0,"I have anxiety myself. It takes advantage of the fact that you can’t really be sure of anything, leading to excessive or ridiculous self-doubt. To me it feels like my vision is hazy and dull and my hearing is amplified to feel unbearable."
mentalillness,fdjww2f,t1_fdiasku,1578490094.0,Fuck society. Hate my parents because they just don’t understand.
nihilism,fdjuack,t1_fdj2z23,1578487715.0,Bet you can also use the blank Unicode character for the same effect
nihilism,fdju5wj,t3_elng0e,1578487596.0,"This is the actual content of the Nihilism article on Uncyclopedia. The whole page is literally black, so you can’t do anything. Even better, the page is full protected so only administrators can edit it."
SuicideWatch,fdhd68i,t1_fdhcdt9,1578420256.0,"I know, society’s attitude to mental illness is ridiculous and horrible."
SuicideWatch,fdhc3xf,t1_fdh7s1b,1578419731.0,Life is not fair is it? Some people unexpectedly develop these mental illnesses. It’s not an even playing field.
SuicideWatch,fdhbjdr,t3_elbqdq,1578419427.0,Life is a meaningless void anyway. There is no inherent meaning in life. It is just a concept invented by humans.
SuicideWatch,fdh7hnu,t3_elbqdq,1578417045.0,My somatic illness leaves me confused and fatigued. Hate it.
nihilism,fdfa8mk,t1_fde4y6w,1578356945.0,That our lives carry some sort of inherent meaning outside of death.
WC3,fddlwz0,t1_fddcpz2,1578317225.0,*hope :D
nihilism,fdbyfah,t3_ekgu1q,1578263826.0,"I guess there may be objective meaning inherent to our existences, but meaning is still a useless concept as it’s relative. You can always strive for more. There’s no ultimate goal, and we all die in the end so this life is for nothing anyway."
nihilism,fdby7fz,t3_ekgu1q,1578263711.0,"I feel so controlled by my parents, like they’re my policemen. They question me when I can’t help the physical effects of my illness."
SuicideWatch,fdah69i,t1_fd176cn,1578246092.0,"Humans are nothing but highly developed animals. We still disagree, fight, kill, war, make mistakes etc. We think we are so intelligent and know so much but in reality we are nothing special. There’s a lot more we don’t know than we actually know. We actually know very little."
SuicideWatch,fda7q5t,t1_fd9lujb,1578242713.0,"Especially address the fundamental problems that’s causing you to see everything in black. Having a mental illness is not a weakness, it’s not a weakness for it to severely disrupt your life, and it’s not a weakness to be feeling suicidal because of your situation. We don’t take our lives because we don’t want to live, we do it because we suffer severely and see no way out."
SuicideWatch,fda75e8,t1_fd9bxlx,1578242532.0,"How is it gonna help me? From my knowledge, there is scientific disagreement over the nature of the condition or if it’s even a proper medical condition. There’s also no cure. Not sure how it’d make any difference either if it’s a mental health condition, since it’s ”your fault” and you’re just as weak."
Assistance,fd69kaj,t1_fd68ipc,1578187605.0,"Anyways, it frustrates me as I know what those comments said."
Assistance,fd62c6m,t1_fd5xc0m,1578184585.0,Perhaps the engines have a harder time searching through replies to comments on posts?
SuicideWatch,fd5l7r2,t1_fd176cn,1578178690.0,I’m meant to rot in the ground. Wanna take over my brain and body and see if you can fix it? No problem because my somatic condition is bad beyond hope. You’ll get it for free.
SuicideWatch,fd2ypmv,t1_fd176cn,1578153040.0,"Let’s face it, we’re only here because of a statistical certainty. Life is just a temporary break from death. Nothing truly matters because the end result is the same regardless of what we do."
nihilism,fd24ok5,t1_fd1fc4t,1578141640.0,"You’re right in that regard. However, we may choose what our ultimate goals are. Knowing that nothing matters makes you brave enough to follow your heart and makes it easier for you to settle on your values since no value is preferable to anything else."
mentalillness,fcsv2xx,t1_fcsub1t,1577925854.0,"Well, I’ve talked to my doctor about my symptoms and he seems to have accepted somatisation disorder, so I don’t see what use I could have out of contacting him again."
nhl,fcs00dj,t1_f9vspjt,1577909230.0,"Most of his records will never be beaten, not because of the lack of emerging new amazing players, but because of the nature of the sport at his time. Today it is impossible to record a 200-point season."
nihilism,fcl3614,t1_fbu9h0y,1577738799.0,"Right? Just look at how many things we don’t know, even about formal systems we invented such as mathematics."
nihilism,fcl1uz2,t3_eh0ebk,1577737989.0,"No belief is provably accurate, as they all rely on faith of some sort. So while we may happen to have knowledge, we (as limited beings) can’t ever be 100% certain we’ve understood and mapped them down correctly. We have to assume some basic things to guide ourselves through this (confusing) world."
dpdr,fck5cgu,t3_ehkgm4,1577717042.0,"Sounds like depression. Dp/dr is feelings of unreality, i.e. the strange feeling that nothing is real."
SuicideWatch,fchmp13,t3_eh59rn,1577651905.0,"Plus, psychiatry works under the assumption that it’s your fault or a mindset issue. Activity replacement money is on a level such that you should get to work soon. We are somehow supposed to suddenly get over our illnesses by forcing us into work."
SuicideWatch,fc8puw3,t3_egjajx,1577539811.0,"I suffer from a chronic mental illness that leaves me fatigued to the point of being unable to work or study. It gives me anxiety to know that I’m supposed to be trained into work in the near future. I can only ponder about the meaninglessness of life and the impossibility of knowing anything for sure; that is, the ridiculous nature of life. To me, life just feels like an empty coincidental void."
nihilism,fc07cl0,t3_efcwak,1577281671.0,"Nihilism is the only rational way of looking at the world. We are only here because of a statistical certainty. Nothing actually matters. Life just is what it is. It is much harder to argue against nihilism than to argue for it. It’s not merely bittermess, it’s an observation about the nature of reality."
nihilism,fbvdxiw,t1_fbtuydq,1577129420.0,"It wouldn’t even have mattered anything if Gretzky had scored 400 points per season and totalled 5000 points. I’m not at all trying to take back Gretzky’s greatness, but nothing truly matters."
