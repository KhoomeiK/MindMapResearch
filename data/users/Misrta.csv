SuicideWatch,ffiu3c7,t1_ffit75a,1579982751.0,No.
SuicideWatch,ffiu11i,t1_ffitq6h,1579982707.0,I’m literally awake most nights.
SuicideWatch,ffiswpv,t1_ffisit9,1579981900.0,Feels like my skin is buzzing everywhere.
SuicideWatch,ffirf90,t1_ffipk7j,1579980835.0,"How are you suffering? For me it’s fatigue, numbness and tingling."
SuicideWatch,ffiqdyf,t1_ffipk7j,1579980109.0,The society’s perception of and attitude to mental illnesses reinforces the fact that truth is a social construct and not an objective truth. One aspect of the absurdity of life anyway.
SuicideWatch,ffip8qv,t1_ffi6h8w,1579979307.0,"And if you can’t cure yourself, you’re weak-minded."
SuicideWatch,ffio7si,t1_ffincsk,1579978602.0,"Exactly. Why is suicide such a big deal for relatives when you have very legitimate reasons (devastating mental illness) to die? There was recently a Swedish man who helped his sick ME wife die, and was tried and sentenced in court for assisted suicide. I feel like a failure because my parents don’t accept the reality of my condition."
SuicideWatch,ffimx5y,t1_ffim4gu,1579977717.0,I don’t know. Probably anxiety involved. It’s not merely being a little nervous or anxious because you’ve done something wrong and need to own up to it. I was too young to remember when it happened. I have no idea how I ended up here.
SuicideWatch,ffilyt4,t1_ffi6h8w,1579977057.0,Why are people forcing us to live? Why should we have to put up with the absurdity of our painful mental illnesses when we have no hope? We were born broken so we might as well die. It’s no different from say an abortion.
SuicideWatch,ffilh2i,t1_ffiiu8v,1579976714.0,"I’m not a doctor but it’s situations of severe mental distress that can end you up in this seat. There’s a genetic factor involved but the brain basically ”shuts down” to reduce stimulation, like a ”break from reality”."
SuicideWatch,ffihs1p,t1_fficdpl,1579974181.0,"No, I’ve tried ADs and even Ketamine injection but none turned out to be successful. This is a mental health condition, like ME. Yes, it’s triggered by psychological factors. I can’t break this deadlock. My body is constantly at the bottom of the ocean. It’s constantly trying to get up, but failing."
nihilism,ffi1oc3,t1_ffhw5u3,1579962428.0,Life is life. Nananana... True. Life is just what it is. Nothing special.
autism,ffhtmnd,t1_ffhsm3h,1579953289.0,"My mother still seems to think he’s valuable for all the money he makes, I think that’s why she’s holding on to him. I mean, if I were here it’s obvious he isn’t going to change. Like, he won’t even admit he’s fat, claiming it’s muscle mass."
autism,ffhn3kp,t1_ffhmhy6,1579943301.0,I wanted to get this posted somewhere. Where do you think I should have posted this? I’m in no way trying to generalise here.
AskReddit,ffhmcu6,t3_etkqrx,1579942175.0,Fix all mental illness
nihilism,ffg2jx2,t1_ffg1qcb,1579897076.0,"To be honest, I hate being around my parents, dancing on to their values and beliefs. People fool themselves by thinking things matter."
mentalhealth,ffasjje,t1_ff4jk8l,1579743491.0,"I know it sucks. You have to address the psychological distress, or it could be a symptom of a bigger condition (such as somatisation, which I have)."
EA_NHL,ff93kj2,t1_ff8z9hp,1579703994.0,"Actually, only my last goal was in PP. And it wasn’t like he started pulling his goalie or playing stupid. I guess ice tilt helped me a bit."
nihilism,ff93fys,t3_es2isw,1579703905.0,"Thanks, because it means my devastating mental illness doesn’t matter"
EA_NHL,ff5lbr6,t1_f5zarkw,1579598457.0,"I got such a situation now in one of my games and it ended up being an automatic goal as you say. This should have been implemented years ago already, in my opinion, but I’m happy they finally did it."
mentalhealth,ff3gdfj,t1_ff3d00z,1579540484.0,"There’s no point. I’ve tried various anti-depressants and even Ketamine which goes through your arm, and nothing’s worked. Medicine can’t cure mental health conditions, sadly."
mentalhealth,ff2oaq9,t3_er56ob,1579516100.0,It’s a response to psychological stress. The brain shuts down to disengage from the world and protect you from stimulation. It’s essentially a ”Stop! Calm down!” message.
nihilism,ff1003g,t1_ff0xi66,1579473918.0,Interesting in a way because what exactly is white? We experience the world differently through our senses.
nihilism,ff0z1aq,t1_ff0wh9e,1579473691.0,"To be certain is to blindly accept a story. It’s to have faith in something. Certainty, in the literal sense, to me is ridiculous."

mentalhealth,fesw6mw,t1_fesjxqm,1579369640.0,It’s easier to push issues away or make them seem less complex or easier to deal with.
mentalillness,feoec5d,t3_eq58ab,1579299001.0,It’s a weird experience. I can’t even find my self. Feel just awfully generally confused about my mental state.
nihilism,femhyx7,t1_fem7pw1,1579256522.0,"Science is not knowledge if you require knowledge to be infallibly true. Science is a working model to understand the external world, but any scientific models are vulnerable to potential future falsification from new data. Science is based on a limited amount of data that is at best probable evidence in favour of a theory or model, but it can’t provide absolute certainty about things."

nihilism,feh5d8p,t1_feh3gar,1579109480.0,That’s moral relativism.

SuicideWatch,fe8m3n1,t3_eo0v3v,1578927777.0,"I’m fucked with my somatic illness, which leaves me paralysed by fatigue, numbed out and overwhelmed with other physical symptoms. I wish I could just die to escape this mess. There’s no way it’s going to get better. I’ve been like this for many years and the symptoms go up and down in intensity. I feel guilty because my parents treat me as though it’s not really an issue and merely blame my autism. The only thing keeping me from doing it is that it would hurt my parents."

We have to assume some basic things to guide ourselves through this (confusing) world."
dpdr,fck5cgu,t3_ehkgm4,1577717042.0,"Sounds like depression. Dp/dr is feelings of unreality, i.e. the strange feeling that nothing is real."
SuicideWatch,fchmp13,t3_eh59rn,1577651905.0,"Plus, psychiatry works under the assumption that itâ€™s your fault or a mindset issue. Activity replacement money is on a level such that you should get to work soon. We are somehow supposed to suddenly get over our illnesses by forcing us into work."
SuicideWatch,fc8puw3,t3_egjajx,1577539811.0,"I suffer from a chronic mental illness that leaves me fatigued to the point of being unable to work or study. It gives me anxiety to know that Iâ€™m supposed to be trained into work in the near future. I can only ponder about the meaninglessness of life and the impossibility of knowing anything for sure; that is, the ridiculous nature of life. To me, life just feels like an empty coincidental void."
nihilism,fc07cl0,t3_efcwak,1577281671.0,"Nihilism is the only rational way of looking at the world. We are only here because of a statistical certainty. Nothing actually matters. Life just is what it is. It is much harder to argue against nihilism than to argue for it. Itâ€™s not merely bittermess, itâ€™s an observation about the nature of reality."
nihilism,fbvdxiw,t1_fbtuydq,1577129420.0,"It wouldnâ€™t even have mattered anything if Gretzky had scored 400 points per season and totalled 5000 points. Iâ€™m not at all trying to take back Gretzkyâ€™s greatness, but nothing truly matters."
