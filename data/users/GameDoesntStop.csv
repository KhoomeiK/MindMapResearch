**More detail**:  he bought the option (actually he bought many different options, but all with the same idea) to sell X number of Tesla shares at $Y/share at or before future date Z.  The person(s) who sold him that option got his initial $10,000 and was banking on Tesla not going up that much.  If the stock hadn’t reached the agreed upon price by that date, he’d have had nothing and the seller(s) would’ve pocketed his initial money.

**Example**:  Stock is trading at $10.  You think stock will be higher than $12 in a month, so you pay $1 per share for the option to buy at $12 in a month (or anytime before).  

In a month if it is trading at $15 a share, you can exercise that option, buy shares from the seller at $12 a share, and immediately sell them on the market for $15 (or keep them).

If in a month it is still anywhere below $12, the option is pointless, and you wasted $1 a share buying that option.  The seller profits in this case."
