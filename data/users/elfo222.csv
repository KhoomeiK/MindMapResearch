cableporn,ff3ia2y,t1_ff35rlj,1579541623.0,"I was taught at a previous job not to install them, and in my current role I've removed the few we had in place. Personally I see no benefit to them, it's easy to cable things up with a bit of velcro and have it look just as good if not better. They seem like they must absolutely destroy airflow as well. That being said I was still on the fence about them till two weekends ago. I had a routine firmware upgrade go sideways and had to re-patch a critical server into a different switch that was 20' further away. The equipment I was re-patching was formerly buried behind a cable arm and completely inaccessible. Look at the servers in this photo; I can't imagine having had to dig around trying to get a cable into one of the servers in the middle while a critical system was down. Serviceability is the name of the game as far as I'm concerned, and while cable arms make maintaining the servers themselves easier they make everything far more difficult."

HistoricHomes,fc660vj,t3_eg50s3,1577473074.0,What kind of information are you looking for? Windows like that are fairly common in houses of that era. It looks like that window is in fairly good condition. You may be able to find a manufacturers mark in one of the corners or on the frame. They were typically ordered from a catalog. You can find a collection scanned of catalogs from the Association for Preservation Technology International [here](https://archive.org/details/catalogs?and%5B0%5D=Stained+glass&sin).
