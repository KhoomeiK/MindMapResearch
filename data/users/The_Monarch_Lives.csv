explainlikeimfive,ffh86ej,t1_ffgkgbk,1579925865.0,"There is a plan/process for the US to shut down traffic as well, not just authoritarian regimes. There are certain events theorized that could require a shut down, such as a wide spread terrorist attack that utilizes the internet somehow, etc. I believe the law was signed under either the Bush or Obama admins. 

The process to shut down the internet for a country isnt really as complicated as one would think. Going off of my memory from some research i did for a college paper several years ago, there were at the time only about 5 to 10 hubs in the US that would need to accessed and shut down to cripple the internet for the country. This number is likely a good deal larger now, but would still be manageable. The ISPs themselves would not have a choice in the matter as they would be in violation of the law if they didnt comply and already subject to law enforcement and governmental agency  reps on site to ensure the proper handling of shutting down and restoring access."

Police on anecdotal evidence are very trigger happy in high stress situation. Funding for training is critically low in most areas, accurate statistics nation wide dont exist as the law that requires local law enforcement to report officer involved shootings is not enforced and has no consequences in the wording to inventivise reporting.  On the whole it seems the poorer the area, the more likely there is to be an officer involved shooting. indicating economic factors and then you can add racial bias, whether concious or unconcious to the mix."

Pay attention next time you are trying to remember a quote or line of some sort, you will often mouth the words silently as you are remembering. Its sumilar to how most people subvocalize when they are reading(which stopping that is one of the key steps of speeding up reading, just a bonus trivia)"
news,fcvyrxr,t1_fcvxl36,1578013177.0,"Yep. Some of us look around and see whats happening around them and say, ok i now know what to do and not do and stay on the straight and narrow all their lives. Some say nah, that wont happen to me, get in trouble and then say nope not for me and and go straigh. And some just never understand that the last part of staying out of trouble is not doing things that got you in trouble in the first place. Its someone elses fault their in trouble and in and out of jail all their lives."
news,fcvwcqp,t1_fcvnxy0,1578011584.0,"Its not being affluent, its growing up free of consequences for ones actions. Known people all my life like this, they dont grow out of it if they havent by a young age. Any consequences they run into are someone else's fault. 

Its not my fault i was out after curfew and got pulled over with drugs in the car.

Its not my fault i didnt report for my regular probation appointment because i was coming off a three day speed high and slept through it.

Its not my fault the cop stuck his arm in the window and got hung up and dragged for 100 yards when they tried to arrest me during a drug bust.

All this in just the last few years from a now 50 year old man."
news,fcvvcr0,t1_fcvl87q,1578010941.0,"I hate the affluenza term when used in relation to guys like this. I know it was the term his lawyer used as part of a defence strategy and he is from an affluent family, but coming from poverty myself ive seen family members and other aquaintences that exhibit the same behaviour and attitude toward consequences as this guy. Though i will note the prediction of probation being worse long term for this guy than an initial extended jail term was  spot on. I have a family member that strongly reminds me of the guy, and he is constantly in trouble and going back to jail because he cant live within the constraints of probation. No matter how 
relatively lenient those restrictions can be at times. This guy is in his fifties now and lives like hes still late teens. Also a thief that doesn't think hes stealing really, just thinks hes entitled to things.  

Sorry, recently had some trouble with him and still ticked off and felt the need to unload after seeing something like this."

AskReddit,fcthctz,t3_einagg,1577943312.0,"There was a superman elseworlds comic where in the far future a group of humans was granted supermans powers, but since human physiology cant handle all his powers, each member of the group was given one specific power each but with drawbacks. The superstrength recipient basically lived like a fully paralyzed person because anything he tried to do was massively magnified. Closing a door basically destroyed the building etc. Heat vision dude had to stay near a window to bleed off the energy periodically or blow a whole through the ceiling. Cant remember the others."
Showerthoughts,fca0acf,t3_egjzj6,1577560880.0,"Reminds me of a scene in one of the Star Wars Wraith Squadron novels.  Sqaud plays a joke on one of the superstitious new recruits and tells him a sneeze by one of the other squad members wasnt an accident but him training to load projectiles into his nose and sneeze them out as a last resort weapon if needed. Cant recall which book, Iron Fist i think, but it was hilarious."
movies,fc5fwgo,t1_fc38f39,1577456431.0,"No dialogue during that scene and could be interpreted a number of ways, including as an object lesson in letting someone get to close in his line of work.  

Not everything fits the theory of course, but its still an interest8ng one that at least up to the current movies hadnt been completely ruled out as possible."
movies,fc35ubt,t1_fc2z3f2,1577382178.0,My favorite part of that fan theory is that it still plays with the theory that James Bond is a code name rather than one single person and is passed down through various Agents 007. You just have to ignore the recent movies direct references to Bonds childhood using that name and it works for all the previous movies.
