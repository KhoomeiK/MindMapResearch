I thought he was a master manipulator who was smart but appearing dumb to rally his base, incite his opponents, and control the conversation. 

Now...I think he's a self centered imbecile that's never been told no in his life. He has the emotional maturity of 5 year old and the though process of a 6th grade boy.

He's an embarrassment to himself, the office, and our entire form of government. 

He's exposed how broken everything is.

I don't think he ran to win either. I think he ran to promote his brand and work side deals with people. He ran to take advantage of campaign finance laws that allow him to do a cash grab with little to no recourse. He said whatever it took to stay in the spot lights, get more donors, and keep his brand in the news.

Then he accidentally won. Fucking idiots bought it. The backlash and pent up frustration and racism of the American right just exploded into this clown accidentally winning the presidency.

Now that he's in the job he's doing what he does best. Lies and promotes himself and makes deals that are only in his best interest. It's all short-sighted and all very self interested. He doesn't give two shits about anyone else."
