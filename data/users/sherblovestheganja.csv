However, if you’re already asking reddit if you should leave him it sounds like you’ve already made up your mind and are just looking for validation to your desire of looking for someone else to spend your life with. Nothing wrong with either side, I’m just a dog on the Internet and this is my interpretation of your situation."

There’s the take time for yourself and then there’s the no point in waiting since I felt so out of place with her for a while. I suppose since I don’t know how to begin a new relationship the time to myself is the better choice. I just feel lonely. I miss having someone to talk to throughout the day"

Bring food or if your school has a cafeteria utilize any cost efficient meal plan. Make sure you bring your notes to study off of and if you can afford one, invest in a nice laptop that will last you 3-4 years for $700+."
college,fdhj0cj,t3_elcmhp,1578423666.0,"Both school and work fulltime for me. A strict schedule in which you adhere to like a bible is a necessity. Also, nightclasses, nightclasses, nightclasses. I don’t sleep, I barely have a social life, and I’m fueled by my crippling depression, anxiety, and coffee. Life is great."
