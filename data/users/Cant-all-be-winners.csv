socialanxiety,fg74f8k,t1_fg71q1p,1580583747.0,I get that. But I’ve changed a lot over the years so I wouldn’t be surprised if I wasn’t recognized.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fg6sip1,t1_fg68shv,1580575877.0,"Thats because the number of fat cells in your body never changes naturally. They just expand and contract. So if a person has more fat cells on their hips, when they gain weight it shows there more.

TheChurchOfRogers,fg51gw4,t3_ewlt3t,1580515960.0,"I distinctly remember watching this episode when I was a kid. From that point on I would watch the show hoping for a how it’s made segment.
  
Years later when I found How It’s Made, I was elated."

gaming,ffv5wj0,t1_ffu9baw,1580256429.0,Technically it’s an initialism. Not an acronym. An acronym is when the letters spell a word and you say that word. Like SCUBA or NATO. It’s an initialism when you say the letters. Like FBI or DVD.
gaming,ffsd5eu,t1_ffsclym,1580178860.0,My apologies. I thought it was kind of self explanatory. I’ll throw in an edit.
gaming,ffscxky,t1_ffscgp7,1580178717.0,Their games (RDR especially) have gotten more and more in depth while creating vast worlds full of different characters and special weapons to find and upgrade. But their games have this reputation for being totally badass (which they are) without the stigma that a chunk of the general public tends to attach to RPGs.
assholedesign,ffi8k4o,t1_ffhob59,1579967866.0,I love you.
lightsabers,ff9tu00,t1_ff9qfb0,1579721140.0,"I’ve looked at their stuff, and it’s beautiful, but it all seems pretty finished. I’m looking for something that I can build around, as opposed to a complete component."

boston,fep1dj7,t3_eq17ti,1579309959.0,"In college (art school) for a class we were supposed to come up with a character and come to class and stay in character the whole time while we took a field trip to a karaoke place.
  
Other than mine, the only “character” I remember was one kid that had one of those children’s keyboard toys and was being all kinds of annoying with it.
  
My character, however, was a masked Luchador. I had on a blazer and tie, and a bright orange Mexican wrestler mask. I also spoke in a loud obnoxious voice (with an accent that was probably more than a little racially insensitive).
  
So we all set out on the Green line to Park Street. It wasn’t rush hour, but there were plenty of people just trying to mind their own business. 
  
The kid with the keyboard found some poor older gentleman and started playing some terrible improvised song and asking him what he thought. The guy just kind of smiled and nodded.
  
That’s when I came in and started chastising the kid for bothering the guy. So there I am, in full costume, complete with championship belt. I proceed to very loudly and obnoxiously say to the kid, “Leave that poor man alone! You’re being very loud and obnoxious. These people are just trying to go about their day, and you’re bothering them with your silly nonsense. Show some respect and stop being so silly.”
  
15 years later and I’m still proud of myself for that ad lib."
HumansBeingBros,feos8zm,t1_feofp2q,1579304710.0,My ex and her entire family would always be done eating while I still had half my food left. Her grandmother has also choked on her food on more than a few occasions. Coincidence? I think not.

GreenBayPackers,feaeb58,t1_fe8wji9,1578947596.0,"I'm a Packer fan born and raised in Boston. 

My mom grew up in Green Bay, but never cared about football until I started showing an interest (I had friends that were into it). One year while we were visiting my grandmother, just as something to do to entertain an 8 year old in Wisconsin, she took me on a tour of Lambeau and to the Packer Hall of Fame. Seeing all that history and early dominance must have had an effect on me. And this was just as Favre was hitting his stride. I was a full on cheesehead by the time they beat the Pats in the Super Bowl a few years later.

I tend to think of Pats fans as the ""new money"" of football fans. They've had it so good for such a long stretch, and they don't all really know quite how to act. There's going to be a generation of fans that have no idea what to do with themselves if/when they fall into a significant slump."
boston,fdsm4z6,t1_fdr7atl,1578704990.0,"I’m thinking it has something to do with Harvard being a major bus hub. The number of people that would have to be bussed from Kendall to Central then on to Harvard would be far greater than the number of people that stay on the train past Harvard.

medizzy,fcwh4tu,t1_fcvz5zk,1578025485.0,"Interesting. 

What I remember of the experiments the Mythbusters did, they used poles. One sharp and one blunt. They had a bunch of water balloons in some kind of container, and they poked the bars through it. The blunt one pushed through the balloons, but the sharp one caught and punctured a bunch of them. I would think something similar might apply here."
