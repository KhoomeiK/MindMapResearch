In that case all you really need to confirm is that the tokens weren't transferred to the voter within the same transaction as casting the vote.

AskReddit,ff7swgz,t1_ff7chgr,1579657564.0,"My father-in-law used to do this to all of my wife's friends. Back in high school they had a rule that before she could ride with a teenage driver, they had to meet them first. Inevitably he'd pull something like ""I just want you to know that I love my daughter very much, and I'm not afraid to go back to jail.""

The first time I met him we were just friends and going to see a play with a group of friends. I pulled into the driveway kind of crooked and went to the door to get her and meet him (I'd heard about their rule in advance). He was nowhere to be found in the house, so we decided we needed to go so we didn't miss the show and that I'd meet with him after. We get back to the driveway and he's leaning on my car. He says ""Son, who taught you how to park?"" I sheepishly informed him that my dad did, to which he replied ""alright, well, at least you locked your doors. Have a good time.""

About a year later I was picking her up for our first actual date, I was terrified. If he gave someone who was just a friend that kind of trouble, what was he going to do to a new boyfriend? Turns out - nothing. He was perfectly friendly and pulled no shenanigans. 

Fifteen years later we've been married for a decade, have two kids, and my father-in-law is one of my favorite people in the world. He's got a strange sense of humor, but he's incredibly reliable and helpful to a fault."

You can check that the maker has the assets before attempting to fill the order (also check that they have set the necessary allowances for the trade). 

If at some point in the future the maker has the assets to complete the order, it can be filled.

Compared to losing my keys forever? Meh.

I actually wrote an [article on this topic](https://blog.openrelay.xyz/contract-account-recovery/) about two years ago, though there have certainly been some advancements in the thinking since then. The idea leans on smart contracts for recovery, rather than just splitting up the seed into a bunch of parts and giving it to people. That would mean replacing a guardian when they pass away / become estranged is just a matter of submitting a transaction - not necessarily a huge headache.

And executing a recovery isn't just an ""if you die"" scenario, it's ""if you've lost your keys."" I had a friend experience a house fire recently, and there's a good chance she would have lost her crypto keys if she'd had any at the time. With a contract wallet you could have a different scenario for a will than an account recovery, allowing you to define who gets what in the event of your death. Maybe you give your lawyer the key to execute the will portion of your smart contract, and maybe have a timelock where you can cancel it if you're actually still alive and your lawyer is breaching their fiduciary responsibilities."

Charging ports aren't just for charging. USB-C can even shove pretty high resolution video through the same port. Maybe that's all we'll ever need, but I doubt it. Someone will come up with a new exciting use case that pushes the limits of the existing charging port, and I don't think the law ought to get in the way.

My worry here is that a government enforced standard will inhibit progress. If we had standardized in the early 2000s I doubt that the charging port would also do data. In later half of that decade it might have done data, but not at a high enough bandwidth to stream video. USB c is pretty robust, but I don't want to say it's the end-all-be-all of charging technology.

When we're in a bull market for crypto, lots of people will want to leverage their collateralizable assets to get more exposure. That means they'll generate DAI, but the demand for DAI won't necessarily keep up. Increasing the stability fee and the DSR makes generating DAI more costly (lowering supply) and makes holding DAI more beneficial (increasing demand), and keeps the price near the peg.

Conversely, when there's a bear market for crypto lots of people will want to leave their positions of being exposed to more volatile assets, and will look to hold DAI instead (or burn DAI to close their leveraged positions). This creates a lot of demand for DAI at the same time the supply is contracting. Lowering both stability fees and the DSR decreases the cost of generating DAI (increasing supply) and makes holding DAI less beneficial (decreasing demand) to help keep the price near the peg.

Normally the damage is already done, and the OP either has to report their family member or suck up the cost. In this case there's been no damage yet, so it's either report the family member or *risk* a cost at some point in the future.

I imagine the sister in this case is thinking ""It'll be fine. I'll make my payments on time and I won't burn the place down, so my brother will never actually be on the hook for anything."" And there's a reasonably good chance it actually plays out that way (of course, someone who will commit identity theft probably isn't the best candidate for keeping up with rent and not burning down apartments).

If the OP's SO hadn't gotten the e-mail from Discover, he'd be blissfully unaware of the situation of being guarantor on the lease. If his sister makes her payments on time and doesn't damage the property, she moves out in a year or two and he remains blissfully unaware. If his sister falls behind or burns the place down, only then does he even become aware, and only then does he have to accuse his sister of identity theft to avoid being on the hook himself.

I'm curious how much the OP getting an e-mail from discover actually changes his situation. Does not reporting his sister for identity theft now leave him on the hook as kind of an implicit consent? Or could he accuse his sister of identity theft only when there's going to be an actual cost to him?"

My state set a similar rule a few years ago and I wasn't especially concerned about it because it is in scope of the 10th amendment and my state's constitution. My problem isn't with access to tobacco, it's with creeping federal authority.

A century ago when the federal government wanted to ban the sale of alcohol, they needed a [constitutional amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xviii) to do it. We all know that amendment was soon repealed. In the 1980s when congress wanted to set the drinking age to 21, they knew they didn't have the constitutional authority to do so directly, so they [bribed the states to do it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act) for them (a precedent I'm still not fond of, but it was [upheld by the court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_v._Dole)). Today when they want to raise the smoking age to 21, they simply sneak a provision into an unrelated spending bill.

Again, I've no particular attachment to this subject matter. I'm not personally impacted by this law, as I'm well past 21 and have zero interest in consuming tobacco. My issue is with the creeping scope of federal authority.

I would be surprised if there's not a constitutionality challenge to this new legislation. I don't think Discount Tobacco City & Lottery, Inc. v.

Aside from the fact that it only dealt with advertising and warning labels, it was a 6th circuit decision and did not go to the Supreme Court.

MakerDAO,fdl4tet,t1_fdl06ex,1578517052.0,"I disagree that setting prices is a minor edge case. Money has three main functions:

* Store of value
* Unit of account
* Medium of exchange

DAI is really the first decentralized cryptocurrency to tick all of these boxes.

Volatile assets can be used as a medium of exchange, but don't make for great stores of value or units of account. Your proposal addresses how DAI can still be a good store of value even while it goes along with the dollar's ride for significant inflation. But unit of account is still an important function of money. 

>  If you were concerned about DAI inflation, you could negotiate a contract to be paid in ETH.

That's a bizarre argument. I want a stable unit of account. The point of DAI is to provide stability backed by the volatility of other assets. It's unlikely that ETH will ever be a stable unit of account, especially in the scenario where even USD isn't stable. 6 months ago ETH was $291. If I'd set up a six month contract then I'd be getting half of what I signed on for now. 6 months before that ETH was $150, so somebody who'd signed a six month contract then would have been paying twice what they'd signed up for.

Originally DAI was going to be pegged to SDR. The reason it wasn't is that the dollar was determined to be just as stable, while easier to establish prices against. If the dollar ceases to be a stable asset, it would be a huge win for DAI to be able to provide a greater level of stability.

Now, MakerDAO synthetics may prove an interesting option. If they're set up such that any volatility in the dollar can be offset by the DSR, and they give you a stable unit of account that's probably fine. But having something that serves as a stable unit of account is important for any long term deal making."

I think restoring patients incentive and ability to know about price and shop around would help a ton with the out-of-whack pricing on medical care.

I think emergency medical care is different. If the government is going to pass a law that commits me to pay for a service I was incapable of agreeing to, I think there's an obligation to place some kind of reasonable limit on what I can be charged without agreeing to it. There's no way a market can set reasonable prices when one party can unilaterally decide to provide someone with a service and dictate what the recipient has to pay."
changemyview,fdj1wek,t1_fdht4oe,1578456310.0,"The problem is that emergency medical care isn't a functional market. When you get in a car crash and some witness calls an ambulance that takes you to a hospital where a life saving procedure is performed, you didn't really have any choices in the matter. You couldn't select an alternative service provider - you probably couldn't even determine the price prior to receiving the service.

I'm absolutely a markets guy. If we're talking about the price of generators in a hurricane disaster area, I'm right there with you that price gouging isn't a thing. High prices encourage people to bring more generators into the area, and prices make sure that generators get to the people who will get the most value out of them rather than just the first people who get to them.

But with emergency medical care there's very little choice on the part of customer, and often services are rendered without their input. Under any other circumstances, we wouldn't hold someone responsible for payment for services performed without their consent or while they were incapacitated, but it's often not possible to get their consent in those circumstances, so there's legal exceptions for those circumstances. If there's a time where price gouging can be a real thing, it's when emergency services are bring provided without your consent but you're still legally on the hook for the bill."

From where I sit (in the middle of the country, surrounded by conservatives) the public image, and certainly what gets represented in reddit conversations, is a ridiculous caricature of the beliefs held by the people I know. Don't get me wrong, I've run into some wackjobs who pretty well resemble the caricature, but even most of the conservative folks I know grimace and back away slowly when those folks start into their rants. But those are the people who get attention, and judging from what I can see on Reddit, most of the coastal liberals seem to think that's what conservatives look like.

Personally I identify as a libertarian, and align with conservatives on a handful of issues. I tend to be very careful about what subs I express my political views on. I can have some good conversations on /r/Libertarian, /r/austrian_economics, and usually here on CMV. But if the conversation on /r/technology, /r/askreddit, /r/worldnews, etc. starts to veer towards politics I tend to stay out of it because I know I'm just going to get shouted down, downvoted, and analogized to that caricature I mentioned earlier.

I don't know that there's an answer for what Reddit ought to do as a platform. I don't think giving a louder voice to certain ideas is necessarily constructive. But as a community, I think it would be valuable if people were more open to civil conversation rather than demonizing people they disagree with. In general I think this is important from both sides, but in recent years I've certainly felt that folks on the left have been more guilty of misrepresenting opposing ideas than folks on the right (my reddit account goes back to 2007, and there was certainly a time I would have said folks on the right were more guilty of this, so I don't think it's a personal bias)."

* He married her, which certainly doesn't back up the idea that he was going to leave her to raise the kid on her own.
* We don't know that he knew it was illegal, or that he was pressuring her to keep his parentage a secret.
* We don't know that they weren't using protection. No birth control method available is infallible. 

Additionally, I specifically said there's room for a consequence short of being listed as a sex offender for the rest of his life. Given that he married her and seems to be raising the child, he incurred most of the same consequences she did, plus being labeled as a sex offender makes it harder for him to support her and the child. It strikes me that the sex offender registry makes everyone in this situation worse off. Again, that's not to say that the guy shouldn't have some consequences, but they don't need to be consequences that follow him the rest of his life.

Personally, I was in a relationship with a 15 year old when I was 18. We'd been good friends since I was 16 and she was 14, and started dating when she was 15 and I was 17. Now, we made responsible choices and didn't do anything that could have put me on the sex offender registry, but I'm sympathetic to the temptations we faced at that age, and I don't think someone who made poorer choices than I did is inherently a predator. Fifteen years later I'm 32, she's 30, we're happily married with two kids.

If the guy in this story were a mature adult I'd mostly agree, but an eighteen year old barely crossed the legal line for adulthood (we don't let them drink, as of the last couple of weeks we don't let them smoke), and they certainly haven't reached full maturity, so treating an 18 year old in a relationship with a 15 year old the same as we would a 32 year old just seems misguided."

The thing I thought was really clever about our solutions was being able to wipe the disk, but then appear to boot normally to avoid arousing suspicion.

If you want to look at a destructive wipe of the LUKS header, it was [these few lines](https://bitbucket.org/ausiv4/tedd/src/5313c34d8340c7dca9d96f87c3960992e7bdc0be/scripts/initrd.py#lines-41) in my old project. One thing I'd warn you about today that applies to todays SSDs that wasn't a problem with the HDDs over a decade ago is wear leveling. Back then a wipe of the sectors you were targeting meant they were gone - with SSDs they use wear leveling, which may mean your random junk gets written to some other section of the drive and that section gets assigned to the sectors you tried to write, meanwhile the data you wanted to overwrite is still physically on the disk. I'm not sure if there's a good way around this given wear leveling.

Another idea with BusKill would be to store the key (or part of the key) on the USB device. For example, maybe the key to decrypt the volume is `HMAC(file_on_usb_key + user_password)`. So as soon as they've run off with the laptop they no longer have a necessary component to make it boot."

I'd still advocate for a paper trail - the last few times I've voted the machine has physically printed out a ballot for me to review before I left. I'd like to see the ballots made public for anyone to tally themselves, with paper ballots available for audit in case there are questions about the ballot data itself. 

And Condorcet could still be tallied manually if needed, it would just be a fairly tedious process as each ballot must be tallied against each head-to-head election, and the number of head-to-head elections grows rapidly with the number of candidates on the ballot. It would be pretty trivial to hand tally for the number of candidates currently on a general election ballot, but part of the idea is to get rid of the primary system and the party system and let people vote for their preferred candidates all at once, and if you had 20 candidate on the ballot you'd have 190 races to tally.

Now, if there were contention around two or three candidates, with the other 17 candidates on the ballot not in contention for whatever reason, you'd only need to manually tally the races in contention, which is back to a reasonably scoped exercise.

If we were currently voting on paper systems with humans tallying the results I'd probably agree with you and advocate for IRV, which is a ranked choice system that can be manually tallied almost as easily as FPTP.

This was around 2008 - 2009, when the first court cases were going through regarding whether or not law enforcement could force you to decrypt a device (at the time we were thinking laptops, but now it would be very relevant to phones). Some friends and I who worked in a security research lab at the university were talking about ways to solve the problem, and the concept of duress passwords came up. Our goal was that you ought to have one password you could put into decrypt your hard drive and access your laptop, and a separate password that would wipe any potentially sensitive information on your laptop, but still appear to boot normally.

The system we came up with was pretty clever. We used a plaintext partition containing the operating system, then used aufs to mount the encrypted volume over the plaintext volume. Anything you wrote to the system went into the encrypted volume. At boot time, if you entered the access password it would decrypt the hard drive, mount it over the OS volume, and boot normally. If you entered the duress password it would overwrite the LUKS header with random junk, initialize a new LUKS volume, format it with XFS (because XFS had the fastest formatting speeds - generally not the first metric you use to evaluate a filesystem), mount it over the OS volume, and boot normally. At a glance, it looked like a totally normal Linux system, but all of your secrets were irrecoverably destroyed (this made backups pretty important). In practice there were a few ways you could identify a system that had been wiped with the duress password, but you had to know what you were looking for to distinguish that from a fresh install.

If anyone wants to play with it, I put the code for the installer [on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ausiv4/tedd/src/default/) (because it was ages ago and I wasn't convinced Github had won yet). The installer worked for Ubuntu 8.10 - and I actually ran my laptop with it for a year or two. It's been unmaintained for ages, but it was a fun project."

Libertarian,fcuq2fj,t1_fcuk651,1577986212.0,"So, I'm a huge voting system nerd, and feel obliged to clarify a few things here.

First, ""Ranked Choice"" is an ambiguous term. It describes what voters do at the polls - rank their preferences - but not how the votes get counted. Instant Runoff is one method of tallying ranked choice votes, and while it's one of the simplest, it's still got some problems.

In your scenario above, imagine that Candidate A is on the radical right, Candidate B is a moderate, and Candidate C is on the radical left. Say you have 40% of the population who picks Candidate A for #1 with candidate B as #2, 40% who picks Candidate C for #1 with candidate B as #2, and 20% who picks candidate B for #1 with a mix of A and B for #2. Candidate B gets eliminated, their votes get split among Candidate A and Candidate C, and one of A and C comes out ahead. In this scenario, 60% of the population would have preferred candidate B to the candidate who won, but candidate B got eliminated in the first round because they weren't enough peoples' first choice. This can still lead to a need for strategic voting in a lesser-of-several-evils scenario.

A better solution is the Condorcet method. You take everyone's ballots and create simulated head-to-head races between every pairing of candidates. Using the example above, you get three races: AvB, AvC, and BvC. In AvB, anyone who ranks A higher than B counts as vote for A, while anyone who ranks B higher than A counts as a vote for B. So the outcome with the above numbers are:

* AvB: A - 40%, B - 60% - B wins
* AvC: A - ~50%, C - ~50% - Winner depends on how many people who preferred B picked A vs C. We'll say A wins.
* BvC: B - 60%, C - 40% - B wins

So we had 3 head-to-head races, and B won the majority of them, so B wins. 

At the polls, Condorcet is ranked choice, just like instant run-off voting. But the way everything gets tallied ensures that you'll never see a candidate win when the majority of the population would have preferred a specific alternative candidate. This is harder to tally, of course, but with modern computers it's very manageable, and it eliminates strategic voting pretty much entirely - everyone expresses their preference, and the most preferred candidate will win."

Who's operating the Bradley? If it's the US military, it's a US citizen inside that Bradley.

Back in 2008, there were a bunch of people on the left swearing up and down that Bush was going to refuse to step aside if Obama won the presidency. In 2016, a bunch of people on the right swore up and down that Obama wouldn't step aside if Trump won the presidency. I knew that could never happen for two reasons: 

1. The US Citizenry is armed
2. The military is comprised of US citizens

Neither of these factors are sufficient by themselves. If you have an armed citizenry taking on a well supplied military, the military can just stomp them. And if you have a military comprised of citizens of the country they're charged with taking over, they might do it if the citizenry is relatively defenseless, making a military takeover a fairly safe proposition from the standpoint of a solider. But put those two factors together, and it's a different story.

If the US population weren't armed, soldiers could march down the streets, show off their force, shoot a few people who are throwing rocks at them, and you have a military takeover. That doesn't mean the soldiers like it, but they'll follow orders they don't like when it seems like the safest move.

As soon as you arm the population, the soldiers are now trying to support a government they don't really approve of while getting shot at by people they actually agree with more than the people who are giving them orders. Soldiers start to mutiny, and take the heavy firepower with them. Now you have a proper civil war.

And tying it back into my earlier examples: Bush and Obama both knew this. Even if they wanted to try to hold their office past the end of their terms (which I'm not at all convinced was the case), they would have realized that attempting to hold their office through military force would lead to a civil war, and that would be enough to keep them from trying it. There are certainly people out there who think Trump is a loose cannon, so maybe he'll try it when his term is up. But even then, I doubt his attempt would get past the generals giving the orders to the troops. The generals would recognize the futility and danger of attempting to keep him in office past the end of his term, and wouldn't pass the orders on to the troops. 

Meanwhile, just this year we have an example of a president refusing to step aside in a country without an armed populace. Venezuela banned private ownership of firearms in 2012. In January of this year Maduro, with the support of the military, refused to leave office after a disputed election, and functionally retains control of the government."

It's always struck me as weird that the smaller, nicer bottle is cheaper per liter, but I don't object."

People act like the Republicans are one homogeneous group, but the people supporting Trump's policies are different individuals than the people supporting evangelical policies. Evangelicals may not be renouncing Trump loudly, because they have nothing to gain for it, but they're not his fervent supporters either."

changemyview,fc8wit1,t3_egqws7,1577543176.0,"At least as long as I've been following politics (~20 years), the GOP has been comprised of three factions with similar, but not always aligned interests.

The first group is the religious right, interested in pushing their morality through government policy.

The second group is fiscal conservatives, with interests in reining in government spending, leaving more power to the states and individuals than the federal government. 

The third group are neoconservatives, who tend support more interventionist foreign policy and a top down model to stimulating the economy.

These three groups had some overlap, but are fairly distinct groups. You might be an atheist, but if you're a fiscal conservative you're not going to find a home with the Democrats. These three groups have a tension among them, but they also pay each other a certain amount of lipservice for political reasons. 

The thing about all three of these groups of ~~democrats~~republicans is that their values certainly aren't going to be represented by the democrats, and they aren't big enough to fork off their own party, so trying not to lose too much favor with the Republicans seems like the best way to keep some relevance and policy influence. 

Trump doesn't really fit into any of these models - the old pre-Trump cores of each of these groups resisted him until it became clear it was politically untenable to continue to do so. But he pushes enough buttons with the base of each of these groups that he got wide enough support to become president.

My guess is that most of the people who were strongly aligned with the evangelical side of the republican party are kind of holding their nose at Trump, but some of the people who paid them lip service because it was politically expedient were happy with the direction Trump started to take things. Similarly, the evangelicals are paying the politically expedient amount of lipservice to Trump so they can still get some of what they want."

If miners don't upgrade you get a chain split, followed by a bunch of chaos determining who's right, and a massive reorg that lots of apps aren't built to handle. Obviously it's better for everyone to upgrade in advance, but miners can wreak a lot more havoc if they don't."
