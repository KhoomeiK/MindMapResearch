But this limits generalizability: where you get a large Imagenet-style classification dataset relevant to your domain? And it looks like you don't really need to.

More specifically: I think we're at the point where a few hobbyists or researchers on a <$10k budget can create for most games an AI which will beat the average human player, and with <$10m, can beat most pros and possibly be superhuman.

Although of course there are still games where a workable solution is far from obvious: like _Magic_, how do you handle all the possible sub-games and rule changes and card variants? But a turn-based board game like _Civ_ - unless it's changed an awful lot since _Civ II_ - I think should be pretty much beatable."

> We leverage these large-scale engineering contributions to answer a key scientific question arising in embodied navigation. Mishkin et al. (2019) benchmarked classical (mapping + planning) and learning-based methods for agents with RGB-D and GPS+Compass sensors on PointGoal Navigation (Anderson et al., 2018a) (`PointGoalNav`), see Fig. 1, and showed that classical methods outperform learning-based. However, they trained for ‘only’ 5 million steps of experience. Savvaet al. (2019) then scaled this training to 75 million steps and found that this trend *reverses*–learning-based outperforms classical, *even in unseen environments*! However, even with an order of magnitude more experience (75M vs 5M), they found that learning had not yet saturated. This begs the question–what are the fundamental limits of learnability in `PointGoalNav`? Is this task entirely learnable? We answer this question affirmatively via an ‘existence proof’.

Which may be something you want (along the lines of [preference learning](https://www.gwern.net/GPT-2-preference-learning)), but is not necessarily 'accurate'. Or you might train a GAN to create the equivalent of adversarial examples for humans: faces that look really face-like but actually do not correctly represent the full distribution of all human faces, since it omits people with really weird faces who you can hardly believe are real (but really are real)."
