Tbh I didn’t know there was a random drop system as most games (that I know of) have none, that’s probably why many new players buy weapons and cosmetics (rarer drops but still obtainable) from the store thinking that is the only way to get them, heck they may not even know about trading."

RandomActsOfTf2,fbyqlvh,t3_ef5yc1,1577223736.0,"Let me tell you about an irl friend who joined me in TF2 and has been in my life for over five years now. I’ll call him Alex since there are so many Alex’s and such, I met him in high school where we joined the video game club, it was there we played COD and such (my first FPS game ever actually) and it was there that a friend of ours told us about steam and the free to play options everyone liked. That day, I went home, installed steam, and booted up TF2 since it was free. It took a few weeks to get used to it on my crappy acer laptop and to get him to play it with me that it wasn’t until recently that we played more often and with each other. Through playing with him, I found out just how fucking cursed TF2 can be, before I had played rather seriously (especially in quick play days, remember those?) but nowadays, I play for either the hilarity or just to hang out with friends. Who are all on a couple of discord servers including my own but that’s a whole group of friends. Since I hardly see him face to face despite us living in the same city on the same island (we live on Oahu), it’s nice to talk to him and just chill in a match of 2fort with him, beats finding him irl since we’re both always busy during the day or broke af (mainly due to the game lol) and usually either he gifts me stuff or I gift him stuff. Recently his birthday passed and to make it up to him, I gifted him slime rancher since it was on his wishlist after I bought a $20 steam card, now we can play that game together too since I got it free as a promotion. Now I’m gifting him my extra horror holiday sniper rifle and a strange head hedge after I transfer the points over to my other strange hat.
