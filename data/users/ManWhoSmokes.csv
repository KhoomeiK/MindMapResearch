todayilearned,fd3ke5m,t1_fd37c73,1578159102.0,"They do put them in larger stalls,  not usually,  but I've seen it.  Also, why do you care if someone accidentally sees your child's genitals, unless they are being creepy about it, most people are not pedophiles,  and even if they were you could do something. Also, my kids junk was not out in the open, you would really have to be invading someone's personal space most of the time to see a child's genitals while on a changing table. Just saying. Also are you ok with young boys and men seeing it? You mentioned ""old men"" specifically,probably the group that cares the least to see a babies vagaina."

todayilearned,fd3gri5,t1_fd2w70k,1578158215.0,"That definitely falls into his 40+ category. I would argue 40 hours is too much. Especially when 40 hours with a required hour lunch is so common. Then commute time. Being gone up to 10 or 11 hours a day is hard, kids go to bed early. So if a patent leaves at 8 or 8:30 to be at work by 9, then leaves work at 6pm and get home around 6:30 - 7 , that's not much time to spend with a child leftover. Especially everyday most people would be tired after all of that."

Preschool they don't ""avoid"" me, but at the park and in other kid places,  my guess is women and their husbands are ok with them hanging out with other women while the father is at work, but fraternizing with other men is not.

Probably not a good sign, but I think it's just corrosion on bearings or somethjng."
