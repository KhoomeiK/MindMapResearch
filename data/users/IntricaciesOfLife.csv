Onision,ff6yws5,t1_ff6yer5,1579637742.0,"Literally same. Whenever my cat accidentally bumps his head or I bump into him, I’m beside myself. 

It takes a special kind of monster to record their suffering child after she’s just fallen out of a window. It’s insane. It’s beyond comprehension. I can’t wait until he gets what he deserves. Those babies need a good home. They need love and care."
Onision,ff6yp8y,t1_ff6ol9p,1579637619.0,"Exactly. My cat is my world. His happiness matters so much to me. Sometimes in the winter I’ll accidentally shock him (static) because of the lack of humidity, and even that kills me!!! I don’t understand monsters like Onision. He’s sick."
Onision,ff52qki,t1_ff51sh3,1579578627.0,"Yup. This is the stuff we know, the things that are out in the open. I can’t imagine the stuff behind closed doors. It scares me."
Onision,ff508f4,t1_ff4wzcf,1579576755.0,"Obviously different, but I’m a cat mom (not sure if I want kids), but my cat means the world to me. I cannot fathom anything bad happening to my baby and I care for him more than anything. 

I can’t imagine being an actual PARENT and having something like that happen. When my cat gives me a scare (chewing something he’s not supposed to, throwing up), I lose my damn mind. Imagine a child?! Going through that?! 

A normal person would react like you do, in a loving, fearful, nothing-else-matters kinda way. They would be in agony. They would be blaming themself. They would be thinking the worst, fearing the worst, and unable to cope. 

They would NOT film it. They would NOT try to escape blame; that would be the furthest thing from their mind. Besides the guilt, they wouldn’t care about any legal issues in that moment, or any blame. It’s their CHILD, for the love of GOD! 

James/Greg is not normal. James/Greg is not sane. He is a narcissist. He is a sociopath. The fact that he could sit there and tweet sexual things in the waiting room disgusts me to a point I can’t even describe. 

This man needs to be locked up. Kai needs to be locked up. 

His babies need to be in a safe home. His animals need to be in a safe home. This needs to happen."
AskWomen,ff04d2j,t3_eqxs0f,1579465073.0,"She recognized that I’m different and have my own priorities. I grew up as an Orthodox Jew, but I decided that I was better off modern Orthodox (wearing pants, not covering hair after marriage, dating for a few years and marrying at a normal age), etc. 

She never tried to change me; she recognized that not everyone is meant to be extremely religious and that what I’m doing right now is still pretty strict and she’s proud of me for it. This gave me the freedom to have the life I want while holding onto some “faith” (still trying to figure out exactly what that entails.) 

Also, I’m a staunch Bernie supporter, and she leans more to the middle, but she always makes an effort to talk about exciting news involving Bernie. It’s pretty sweet. 

Overall, she cares about me and tries to show it as much as possible."
