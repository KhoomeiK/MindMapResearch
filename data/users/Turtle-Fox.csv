&#x200B;

If I just kick her out without reporting her, she might just plagiarize in the next group and not learn her lesson. She's going to get caught eventually, so it's really in her interest to learn the lesson now when we're in entry level classes and not later.

Honestly, I don't give a shit if you're cheating on your own. You get caught, you get punished. When you're affecting others (and being generally uncooperative and abrasive), then its not cool. Especially since I said multiple times if she needed help, I'd help them.

DMAcademy,fgtafwf,t1_fgt6nn7,1581101648.0,"> A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Perception checks, RAW

If you're using a torch, it's going to see you either way. The situation hasn't changed now that you're without torch, except now you can actually try to be stealthy. A large portion of cave dwellers only have Darkvision, too, so chances are they'll just not notice each other if anything. Basically, there's still no incentive to use a torch, since using a torch just makes it impossible to stealth. Plus, torches only go up to 40 ft.

A player without Darkvision *has* to use a light source, so Darkvision has the advantage here.

You have brightness, just not color. You can tell a dark red object from a bright red object. [Just looking at this example ](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2615/3082/articles/shutterstock_399613873.jpg?v=1529686110) you can see there's plenty of detail shown without shadows. The most that would impart is disadvantage on Perception checks, but that doesn't stack in 5e anyways."
DMAcademy,fgt4top,t1_fgsip62,1581099066.0,"- Dim light only gives disadvantage on Perception checks, RAW

- 60' in a dungeon is plenty, unless you add a ton of huge rooms or corridors. Most dungeons and caves are pretty tight quarters, though. Plus, 60 ft is beyond most monsters movement capacity, so they'd need to be ranged with darkvision (or greater) of more than 60 ft.

- Only shapes is a stretch. It's seeing in monochrome. Night vision is monochrome and you can definitely make out complex details.

- Dim lighting doesn't give disadvantage on attack rolls, only not being able to see a creature at all


The only big disadvantage to going it in the dark with dark vision is disadvantage on Perception checks to see things."

You can do either! If there's something you think would be more interesting if you changed it, do that. The nice thing about working with such a developed setting is that a lot of the lore is there already so you can pull on it with ease, but also that you can change it just as easily. If you really want to get into the lore, I'd recommend reading through the Sword Coast Adventures Guide.

Pirates (using the Bandit statblock) would work fine. You could also use Sahuagin, but statted as Merfolk so they aren't as lethal.

DMAcademy,fewmgqs,t1_fevsomv,1579414652.0,"Storm Kings Thunder is one of the better modules published, but really I think it should be based on what you're looking for in a campaign. To start with, I'd suggest Lost Mines of Phandelver (comes with starter set) or Dragon of Icespire Peak (comes with essentials kit). Both available standalone on DnDbeyond as well. 

Lost Mines is my personal favorite, with an overarching story about saving an employer from a mysterious villain, in the process saving the town of Phandalin and delving into an ancient ruin. 

Dragon of Icespire Peak is more open-ended, with the progression being through a quest board. There's not as much of a big bad here, but it gets you to level 7 and then you can buy the full set to get to level 14. 

You can also pick up one of hardcover modules. Hoard of the Dragon Queen is good albeit a bit railroady and needs some tweaking. I wouldn't recommend Curse of Strahd if you're looking for a classic DnD experience but it is something new."

Mario Maker 2 also has sold 3.93 million copies as of September, so that's not even including the holiday sales.

It doesn't matter if every owner of a system buys your game if there's only 1000 owners, which is why 3rd parties are actually bringing games to the switch: there's finally a userbase to sell games to.
