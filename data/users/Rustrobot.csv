amazonprime,ff8osf4,t3_es1qbm,1579689384.0,Shit I was hoping for a solution coming here. I have found a workaround. Even if it’s a bit inconvenient. The iOS apps let you download for offline viewing. That still works.

Music,feded9y,t3_eokrbs,1579009191.0,"The B-52’s to me are a prime example of my tastes evolving. When I was young I really didn’t care for them. They felt too pop and fluff. I was into hard rock, grunge and metal. But now in my late 30s The B-52’s somehow feel way more hardcore than a lot of the stuff I used to listen to. Especially Rock Lobster which slaps so fucking hard."

Wellthatsucks,feddv7e,t1_feddehy,1579008764.0,I’ve never seen a wolf spider in real life. I’m from Chicago and New York where you don’t see big spiders. I live in Sydney now and huntsman are so common it’s mundane. This looks pretty close to a huntsman but I’m not 100% on that. If you’re confident I might side with you. Are there any spider experts in the house that can weigh in?
books,fedd706,t3_eokho3,1579008189.0,I would check out Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie.

keyhouse,fed2u15,t3_eogrza,1578995973.0,"From my understanding they burn through the first graphic novel in the pilot right? What else didn’t you like about it? I guess what I’m getting at, is this a problem of it feeling dated? It’s 9 years old now. Or are there problems that are beyond the time it was made?"
Futurology,fecxnrh,t1_fec495b,1578988802.0,I’m basically a carnivore. I will happily switch over to meat alternatives once they’re prevalent and good enough. A lot of this has to do with marketing. Which I feel is already changing with things like the impossible burger. It’s only a matter of time. It may even take a generation or two but I have no doubt it’ll happen.
television,fec1nwc,t1_fe317o6,1578965349.0,Yeah I’ve loved the show but it seems like a lot to wrap up with one 30 minute episode left. I’m guessing they’re going to leave some stuff unanswered.
television,fec0yum,t1_fe5vkia,1578965036.0,It wasn’t *bad*.... it was just so painfully mediocre.
television,fec03nm,t1_febs6i6,1578964796.0,"The show actually got considerably better after that. After letting go of the baggage Brody brought it found a new voice. Not sure how this season will go. It’s now a bit long in the tooth and in danger of repeating itself too much.

Edit: didn’t know this was the final season. That’s good actually."
television,febyxli,t1_fe7vacw,1578964463.0,Yeah seeing it out of context I can understand why you feel this way. All I can say it makes perfect sense for the character when watching the show.
television,feby9zq,t3_eo0r6b,1578964214.0,Penny Dreadful is strangely the most accurate representation of Frankenstein’s Monster I’ve ever seen put to screen.
television,febwks0,t1_fea8ys7,1578963533.0,Season 3 was great right up until the last 3 episodes or so when it abruptly took a left turn to end everything. So obviously a last minute thing. Which is a shame because it was *such* a good show. Just left a sour aftertaste.

keyhouse,fdt5h3g,t1_fdsrslq,1578712166.0,Well Kinsey in particular was very much of the era. Unless they were going to set it in the 2000s she was always going to have to be updated. I’ll admit that her look has less edge though (at least in comparison to the first graphic novel).
movies,fdse268,t1_fdsc1z5,1578700549.0,Well It’s currently in pre-production at FX. It’s already been mostly cast. But they did just changed show runners a little while back. So while we’re closer to seeing it than ever... who the fuck really knows?

movies,fdiiz5a,t1_fdiik20,1578443974.0,TV is a different animal. There’s a brand guideline she has to adhere to. The style of the show has been set. She’s just adding an entry to that. Here she has more of a blank canvas to make what she will of it. It’ll be a clearer depiction of her taste. I think TV is a good primer though.
movies,fdif1ab,t1_fdgpp1s,1578441429.0,"Nope, you’ve done about a good a job as is humanly possible. I might only bring up that they’re actually different in tone. This is largely due to the film being more focused, but the book feels more like a fever dream."
movies,fdieigw,t3_eljy66,1578441094.0,"I mean, I love King. She’s a powerhouse of a performer and this cast looks really solid. But like anyone with their directorial debut we’ll just have to wait and see what comes of it. Colour me intrigued though."

television,fdeww18,t1_fdeb8bh,1578348298.0,"I mean, regardless of what anyone thinks of the series or the new trilogy, I don't think anyone will argue the new films are wildly successful from a production point of view.
