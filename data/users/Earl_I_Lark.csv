However, I vividly remember the day he put the hole through the wall because he did it with a .303 rifle. He stood at a slight angle to the wall - so he wouldn’t be killed by the ricochet he said. My mother was unconvinced and made all of us go to the barn which was far from the house. With each shot my mom would give a little scream and I’d be sure he had shot himself or her. But he didn’t. He made a rough hole through the wall and completed his protect - whatever it was.

Fat and docile, big and dumb

They look so stupid, they aren't much fun

Cows aren't fun

They eat to grow, grow to die

Die to be et at the hamburger fry

Cows well done

Nobody thunk it, nobody knew

No one imagined the great cow guru

Cows are one

He hid in the forest, read books with great zeal

He loved Che Guevera, a revolutionary veal

Cow Tse Tongue

He spoke about justice, but nobody stirred

He felt like an outcast, alone in the herd

Cow doldrums

He mooed we must fight, escape or we'll die

Cows gathered around, cause the steaks were so high

Bad cow pun

But then he was captured, stuffed into a crate

Loaded onto a truck, where he rode to his fate

Cows are bummed

He was a scrawny calf, who looked rather woozy

No one suspected he was packing an Uzi

Cows with guns

They came with a needle to stick in his thigh

He kicked for the groin, he pissed in their eye

Cow well hung

Knocked over a tractor and ran for the door

Six gallons of gas flowed out on the floor

Run cows run!

He picked up a bullhorn and jumped up on the hay

We are free roving bovines, we run free today

We will fight for bovine freedom 

And hold our large heads high 

We will run free with the Buffalo, or die

Cows with guns

They crashed the gate in a great stampede

Tipped over a milk truck, torched all the feed

Cows have fun

Sixty police cars were piled in a heap

Covered in cow pies, covered up deep

Much cow dung

Black smoke rising, darkening the day

Twelve burning McDonalds, have it your way

We will fight for bovine freedom 

And hold our large heads high 

We will run free with the Buffalo, or die

Cows with guns

The President said ""enough is enough

These uppity cattle, its time to get tough""

Cow dung flung

The newspapers gloated, folks sighed with relief

Tomorrow at noon, they would all be ground beef

Cows on buns

The cows were surrounded, they waited and prayed

They mooed their last moos, 

they chewed their last hay

Cows outgunned

The order was given to turn cows to whoppers

Enforced by the might of ten thousand coppers

But on the horizon surrounding the shoppers

Came the deafening roar of chickens in choppers

We will fight for bovine freedom 

And [E]hold our large heads high 

We will run free with the Buffalo, or die

Cows with guns

Walk the dog. Just walking with you can create a bond. If he’s a dog that likes to walk, that will make him happy which he may transfer to you
Use a very quiet voice with the dog. Some dogs are sensitive to loud or over excited voices. It puts them off. Talking in a low voice will make the dog need to get closer to you to listen. 
Sit facing slightly away from the dog and don’t look at him. Let him come to you and don’t make a big deal of it when he does. 
Be calm and don’t worry if it takes time. The dog can sense your mood from my experience and they like calm."

Once you are out there, drive into Halls Harbour for lobster ( they also have a website). It’s not usually beach weather in late May but they could stop at Blomidon (known for agates and amethysts). If they are interested in fossils, Blue Beach, just outside Hantsport is known for fossils ( it’s a shale beach).
