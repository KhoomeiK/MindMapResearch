BollyBlindsNGossip,fcwn4eq,t1_fcwln60,1578030370.0,"I would like to say again that I do not support Shukla. A person who cannot control his temper will most likely not succeed in life. But Asim Riaz is a dick too. His sole purpose is to eliminate Shukla from the show by inciting him and making him raise his hand.
Also, Shukla should have been eliminated when he first raised his hand but nothing happened. Then again, these are the show’s rules. If they can bring back Rashmi and Devoleena then they can decide who to eliminate or not. 
I stand very much with what Vikas had to say about Shukla and how he saw things in the house. Everyone jumps at him and he is also no less. He is no doubt an egoistic and narcissistic person but unlike Asim and Rashmi I don’t see evil designs in his game plan. Pushing is not allowed and yes he should have been eliminated earlier from the show. 
Having said that, I think he,Rashmi and Sana might be the three finalists ( if he is not thrown out by then). Lets see who wins"
BollyBlindsNGossip,fcwjnvk,t1_fcwd14d,1578027441.0,"Lol, most of the things in your paragraph are assumptions based on things you have heard from here and there. One genius in this group earlier said that Shukla said today to Asim that he would kill him and dump his body in a dumpster. Another genius proclaimed that it clearly shows that Shukla is cocaine addict and is being supplied cocaine in the house thats why he breathes so deeply and has roid rage. You guys are just believing everything outside of the show and nothing whats in it. BTW Asim today did say bad about Shukla’s late father but again some genius proclaimed how Shukla poked Asim which started the fight today.
Your answer is of a person who is clearly on one side and hates the other so you clearly will believe any/every thing said against that side. I on the other hand am neutral. Whoever wins, IDGAF, i wont get a single rupee out of the prize money and I knew none of these contestants before I saw them.
Yes, Shukla called him a cry baby and the next words out of Asim’s mouth were expletives that were muted. Its a reality tv show dude, crybaby is perfectly acceptable and I believe the best way to rattle your opponent. If you behave like a loser and complain that your basket will fall off then I believe Crybaby is the perfect response but abusing someone’s dead father is not. 
But talks like Colors is biased, Salman is biased, Tv industry is biased only beg the question that if everyone is biased and you are correct then maybe you need to re-analyze once more."
BollyBlindsNGossip,fcwiulq,t1_fcwceh7,1578026796.0,"I dont know. I dont think anyone is deserving this year enough to win the show but thats the same story every year. Sehnaaz is gud but I doubt if she has that much of a fan following. If Siddharth can keep his temper down then he is a very good candidate, but I doubt that will happen. Asim used to good and it looked for a time that he was doing excellent with his leadership qualities but he lies through his teeth and has same temper issues as Sid. I think if Rashmi continues to cry and somehow wins the audience over in the final few weeks, then she might actually win the show"

BollyBlindsNGossip,fcw84b3,t1_fcvmhb9,1578019321.0,You are right. But this sub here is retarded. It looks like we are watching a totally different show. The guys here cant understand that when Asim’s mike is mute that means he is abusing with something really bad but the entire sub here seems to be a bunch of retards.The guys here believe that Colors is protecting Shukla and company while everyone else is a God/goddess inside the house though Colors seem to be showing only their bad side on TV

BollyBlindsNGossip,fcwn4eq,t1_fcwln60,1578030370.0,"I would like to say again that I do not support Shukla. A person who cannot control his temper will most likely not succeed in life. But Asim Riaz is a dick too. His sole purpose is to eliminate Shukla from the show by inciting him and making him raise his hand.
Also, Shukla should have been eliminated when he first raised his hand but nothing happened. Then again, these are the showâ€™s rules. If they can bring back Rashmi and Devoleena then they can decide who to eliminate or not. 
I stand very much with what Vikas had to say about Shukla and how he saw things in the house. Everyone jumps at him and he is also no less. He is no doubt an egoistic and narcissistic person but unlike Asim and Rashmi I donâ€™t see evil designs in his game plan. Pushing is not allowed and yes he should have been eliminated earlier from the show. 
Having said that, I think he,Rashmi and Sana might be the three finalists ( if he is not thrown out by then). Lets see who wins"
BollyBlindsNGossip,fcwjnvk,t1_fcwd14d,1578027441.0,"Lol, most of the things in your paragraph are assumptions based on things you have heard from here and there. One genius in this group earlier said that Shukla said today to Asim that he would kill him and dump his body in a dumpster. Another genius proclaimed that it clearly shows that Shukla is cocaine addict and is being supplied cocaine in the house thats why he breathes so deeply and has roid rage. You guys are just believing everything outside of the show and nothing whats in it. BTW Asim today did say bad about Shuklaâ€™s late father but again some genius proclaimed how Shukla poked Asim which started the fight today.
Your answer is of a person who is clearly on one side and hates the other so you clearly will believe any/every thing said against that side. I on the other hand am neutral. Whoever wins, IDGAF, i wont get a single rupee out of the prize money and I knew none of these contestants before I saw them.
Yes, Shukla called him a cry baby and the next words out of Asimâ€™s mouth were expletives that were muted. Its a reality tv show dude, crybaby is perfectly acceptable and I believe the best way to rattle your opponent. If you behave like a loser and complain that your basket will fall off then I believe Crybaby is the perfect response but abusing someoneâ€™s dead father is not. 
But talks like Colors is biased, Salman is biased, Tv industry is biased only beg the question that if everyone is biased and you are correct then maybe you need to re-analyze once more."
BollyBlindsNGossip,fcwiulq,t1_fcwceh7,1578026796.0,"I dont know. I dont think anyone is deserving this year enough to win the show but thats the same story every year. Sehnaaz is gud but I doubt if she has that much of a fan following. If Siddharth can keep his temper down then he is a very good candidate, but I doubt that will happen. Asim used to good and it looked for a time that he was doing excellent with his leadership qualities but he lies through his teeth and has same temper issues as Sid. I think if Rashmi continues to cry and somehow wins the audience over in the final few weeks, then she might actually win the show"

BollyBlindsNGossip,fcw84b3,t1_fcvmhb9,1578019321.0,You are right. But this sub here is retarded. It looks like we are watching a totally different show. The guys here cant understand that when Asimâ€™s mike is mute that means he is abusing with something really bad but the entire sub here seems to be a bunch of retards.The guys here believe that Colors is protecting Shukla and company while everyone else is a God/goddess inside the house though Colors seem to be showing only their bad side on TV
