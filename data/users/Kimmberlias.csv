dogs,fcw6n59,t3_ei3g81,1578018363.0,"In May 2013, my then sister in law was babysitting a sharpei X pitbull, and it turns out she was pregnant and had 4 male puppies! My ex and I went to see them when they were just a couple days old, and since I had been going on and on about wanting to get a puppy he decided would take one of them. His sister was totally okay with that, even though he choose the one they wanted :p 

Fast forward to when he was 7 weeks old, we were trying to setup brining him home, and the actual owner told us that we would need to give her $250 for him instead of the agreed $100 otherwise he was going to go to another home. We def weren't having that and decided to give her the extra. So she dropped him off, and he was such a cutie!

[Here's him stealing hay from my giant bunny](https://i.imgur.com/9OGP6gO.gif)

Zero was my first dog, aside from a family dog I walked a bit and fed when I was younger. I definitely messed up sometimes, but he was so amazing. 

I had just gone on summer break for college, so was able to spend 4 months not working (ex was able to pay bills, and I had savings), and focused on training our new boy. 

That fall though one day I noticed that he wasn't/couldn't open his mouth, not even for treats, so I grabbed him and took him to the vet. I'm so thankful the vet I got put with for this was the one to take care of us was available cause she was amazing. She thought it was 
Masticatory muscle myositis but without the $500 blood test we couldn't be for sure, and at that point I couldnt afford it. She said it was the same treatment (Prednisone) either way, so we got him on a low dose and watched him, thankfully his jaw started moving like normal after just a couple doses, so we were able to wean him off of them. 

At the time I lived near a big Green space in my city, so would take him out there to let him run a bit more. One day, I had him off leash, and he saw a flock of geese take off, and started to chase them towards a main enough road! (Still a ways away, but I was panicking) so I yelled the only command he knew 100%, which was ""sit"". And omg he did! He totally stopped chasing them and sat down, and looked at me! I ran over, gave him so many treats, and put his leash back on. Fortunately he was pretty good off leash, even if I maybe shouldn't have had him off as often as I did/some places. Another time in the same area, I had him off, but I saw a dog coming towards us, so I watched a bit more. Then I realized there was no owner around. Was it a stray? Lost? Then it dawned on me that it was actually a coywolf, and it was still heading towards us. I threw so many treats onto the ground in front of Zero to make sure he stayed while I got his leash on, and I started backing away, while watching. Zero didn't even notice though 😅 

Camping trips, swimming, and playing in the snow were my favourite things to do with Zero, aside from [cuddling](https://i.imgur.com/5JQE3D1.jpg). 

We lived in a very dog friendly apartment, so he had lots of puppy friends to play with, and it was incredible having so many like minded dog owners to hang out with. 

Unfortunately we moved out of the apartment, and so did most of our buddies, so we really didn't get to have many doggie play dates anymore, but he was around 3 when the happened, so at least he wasn't quite as hyper as he used to be. 

August 2017

I was walking him, and realized he was holding his [mouth open...](https://imgur.com/a/IjAxDlz) so I called the vet and brought him in. 
This time I didn't care, that blood test was happening. Saw the same vet because she had already seen him for sort of this issue. He didn't seem to be in pain, but he really couldn't close his mouth. He couldn't even drink water properly :( went back to being on Prednisone, a higher dose this time. He started getting better in the sense that he could close his mouth and eat and drink again, but he started losing [all of his muscle.](https://imgur.com/a/yuw1uwU). It was also at this time that my ex and I officially broke up, and he moved out. We were together for 7 years, and engaged for 5, so it was a big change, but good. 

Winter 2017 

Zero was losing fur, and getting scabs from slipping on the ice outside (very rough winter that year), so he started wearing t-shirts to protect his thin skin, and keep him warmer, and I used the back clip on his harness and held him up when we went outside. 

In January 2018 I took him to his last appointment. We had been going monthly from August to check his blood due to the Prednisone. He was doing okay in that regard, but I knew those were going to be his last days. When I first went in the vet said he looked good, but I shook my head and she looked closed and noticed the lumps in his neck. His lymph nodes were huge, and she suggest that he might have had lymphoma, and asked if I wanted to think about chemo, but I didn't. Nor could I afford it if I wanted to (gonna get insurance with my next pup). Zero lived his last moment in peace while I sat on the floor in a nice quiet room with him and pet him. My mom was with us as she had driven us to the appointment (I always walked him before that), and I'm so thankful. 

My heart has been broken ever since, and I'm sure that he's going to send me the exact right pup that I need in my life this year ❤️ I always told myself I wouldnt get another puppy, but I need one again now. 

This decade was full of amazing and horrible moments with Zero, but I wouldn't change it for the world. It hurts me so much that he left this world so soon, but I'm blessed he was in my life at all. 

I love you boy-o
