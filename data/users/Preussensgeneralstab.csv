The core concept of ""Blitzkrieg"" was to have a fast war to minimize the supplies needed. But Russia had to much resistance and is so large that not only were the supply lines slow, but also the Germans didn't have many supplies to begin with and those were quickly exhausted.

""But Muh! If they had taken Moscow"" is a dumb argument. We're talking about Russia, not Poland or France. The Russians would've continued fighting until everyone who could fight was dead. If Stalin or anyone from the Communist Party was alive, the war would still go on."
HistoryPorn,fgfhbqr,t1_fgfa46j,1580738738.0,"It actually was going very well at the beginning.

Here, their king, RAMses the 4th Ruled. He, who was chosen from their god, ChromeÈ: The god of Creation with an infinite hunger for memories. 

From the remaining scriptures, archeologists and Historians translated how the god chose the King:

""ChromeÈ, the god who is driven mad from hunger, chooses only one to be King. One who can end his hunger. One with incredible speed, elegance and purity. He chose RAMses the one. From there, his descendants inherited the ability to end our Creators hunger. And so shall the people of these lands pay him back of what he has given us.""

Not much is known about this strange civilization, except their excellent skill of making tools from Silicon. And the downfall of this once prosperous civilization is unclear. But scientists theorize that a virus of unknown origin may have infected the Asus-folk's livestock: an extinct species of goat named currently ""SSD"".
