Imagine a small boy, if we let him loose he’d do anything he wanted and cause lots of trouble. We don’t want to scold him but we do anyway cause we know it will be good for him to learn these things in the long run.

Definitely no skipping school and homework, and all the basics like showering and cleaning his room is a must. Hard rule of no computer till that’s at least done. Don’t keep junk food in the house, replace it with fruits or something. If he has to find food in the night it’s fruits or nothing.

Most important here is to sit him down 1 day and talk about it CALMLY, do not just barge into his room and start raising your voice. If you catch him in the middle of raid or wtv you will not get the message across and both parties will be angry. Arrange a time before hand, don’t treat him like a kid, treat him like an adult, if he wants to make the decision to play WoW all day fine but he still lives under your roof with your food your house etc, so there’s rules to follow no matter what."

The fact is you rely heavily on healers to baby you or your raid overall to be overgeared so you can dps freely.

Unfortunately most guilds have what you have on week 1-4, where there isn’t enough healers or tanks in raid etc and everyone has to cut back or play safe.

philosophy,fdtiixm,t1_fds0jud,1578717252.0,"The reason I mention all these questions that have no answer is to challenge the definition of an “ethnical vegan”, in fact because there are all these unanswered questions there is no true definition for what it is, so someone calling themselves one is doesn’t make sense if everyone version is different.

About your question, omnivorous meal or vegan meal, there are a lot of factors at play here that need consideration to determine which is the moral choice. Where were the crops grown and how, how were the animals grown and how. If it’s kangaroo meat, (kangaroo is considered a pest in Australia), then you are actually doing good for the ecosystem. If a cow died of old age, might as well eat it. 

More generally the vegan meal would be more moral, but it doesn’t take into account the health risks of a pure vegan diet for a long period of time (10 years+) especially for kids. Would you withhold meat from a growing child? Can they grow properly on a vegan diet? Answer is it was never tested so we don’t know. 

What I will say is, our bodies biologically were never meant to digest large amounts of plant based food. If you compare our intestines and stomach it’s more akin to a carnivorous animal.

 Facts : Cows and giraffes have multiple stomachs. Rabbits re-eat their poop, and elephants have looong intestines. All of this is for extra time to break down plant matter.
Lions have a large/small intestine of 1/6m, pretty much the same as humans. 

We don’t have all the answers but based on that alone it seems to me our bodies are bad at digesting plant matter. You can make your own conclusions."
philosophy,fdqccjj,t1_fdo1h58,1578662827.0,"To begin with the word ethical is is very up to interpretation, where do you draw the line on this? 

So an animal farm is no good? Well okay you only can have a certain number of cows so they live happily, is that ethical? But wait you still slaughter them in the end, so that’s unethical so you can’t have farms at all and you must let all of them be wild? 
Even if we did nothing, the animals in the wild die. Is it unethical to find these already dead animals and harvest their skin and flesh? Is this meat and skin ethical to eat and use to make goods? Or should we have let them go decompose back to the earth?

Can’t test new drugs on mice? Well if there was a new disease spreading, it sounds pretty unethical if you let a disease go on and on with no cure cause you can’t test your cure on any animal. Our breakthroughs in the last 6 decades or so come from testing on lab mice. Social sciences also use mice, primates etc to study behavioural patterns. To get good results on any study you definitely need to monitor everything properly like their diet and health etc. Even that is keeping them caged so that’s unethical? 

Zoos mostly take in animals from the wild that were hurt/lost etc and care for them properly. So the animals shows in the zoo I’d say are unethical sure, but is the whole zoo is unethical? A lot of them actually focus on conserving the animals more than just having them there to make a profit. Although they do sell zoo tickets, it goes back to fund the zoo. The act itself of keeping animals in a zoo is unethical?

Is keeping a pet ethical? You can call it a companion but it’s the same thing, that’s a change in wording used by media to remove the negative stigma of calling it a pet. (The also changes gambling to the gaming industry). So okay adopting a pet is ethical, but then you should also neuter it? Nothing gives you the right to remove their sexual organs. So that their kids don’t have bad lives? But then that’s not up to us to decide, if you want to be ethical you should just adopt all their children they give birth too?

I’m not totally against “ethical venganism”, but it doesn’t sound to me that there’s a proper set of rules and everyone has their own version of “ethical veganism”. If the “ethical vegans” themselves can’t decide on definitive rules then things how can you expect more people to get onboard?"

gaming,fdgcivg,t1_fdfsaxd,1578390122.0,"On normal you can pretty much blast though the main quest and listen to the stories and dialogue. It’s chill and you don’t have to do much combat wise.

On the hardest you need to usually read about the monster you are facing (at least once) so that you understand their weaknesses. A water hag might be weak to fire for example. Mobs do a lot of damage so it becomes more important to do extra quests to get gold to upgrade your gear/consumables. I personally play this mode cause it’s very immersive to read about the monsters and explore the world.

Medium is just in the middle of those. Difficulty can be changed any time."

classicwow,fdd6fgt,t1_fdd3v3y,1578296854.0,"It is. Yes some premades can do 8 mins wins, but if you have only like a 20 man premade, winning is not a thing since there’s still 20 members random. The best strategy in this case is to kill all lieuts and commanders for roughly 2k honor in 15 mins alliance side. 

If you add up the time, 1 hr is roughly 8k honor whereas if you try to win by defending and counter attacking etc you can easily stretch 1 game to 45mins -1 hr winning with 5k honor.

In pugs alliance side definitely losing while killing commanders is best. Only full alliance premades pull off winning fast"
science,fdd2td3,t1_fdd2kaq,1578292500.0,"Yes and in that there is a play of power going on in the same sexes. Like men will show off to each other their new car or house etc whereas women will show off how much more glamorous they are to other women to tell others that they are the alpha male/female around here.

Girls actually play very mean games especially in high school or college times vs other girls compared to guys who try to let their achievements speak for themselves."
classicwow,fdd2c2i,t3_ekpa7u,1578291976.0,"What I’ll say is, BWL is easy anyway so does it matter if some dudes are r14? And I say some dudes cause inevitably only the very very very minority will reach r14.

On the flip side there would even be no reason to do pvp(except for fun) if the rewards was only after naxx. 

What I will say though is AV is cancerous because of the gameplay of it. I don’t get how it should be more honor for losing fast than winning, it just creates a situation where to actually grind honor you purposely lose fast or rush through the map. Also the meta is not about skill and doesn’t reward skill in any way. It’s about hours played. The top tankers all afk through the night and stuff to max their honor. 

Tldr; the gameplay is cancerous, the rewards not necessarily"
Overwatch,fdd1kma,t3_ekd1pt,1578291146.0,"To all saying just donate, I am going to be “that guy” and say that people don’t care about what happens to others, in general. Yes it’s sad but that’s just how it is. If you read about a car accident you just go “that’s terrible”, but you forget about it the next day. A lot of people will not willingly donate if not given an incentive. In fact you can attract many more people who wouldn’t have donated in the first place by doing it, generating overall more money.

It comes back to the psychology of intent vs result. If the result is good does it matter the intent? What we should be actually pushing for is Blizzards cut. If they do 100% it’d be great, don’t let them get away with 25% of it only going to the donation."

science,fdd0i8z,t3_ekmj1w,1578289992.0,"I feel like this kind of study was done before where they found out women dress more for other women than for men. Basically to be on top of the hierarchy they dress better not only to attract a mate but to push other women below them on the hierarchy who would be their competitors.

Men also have hierarchies but they’re usually based on their job rank or earnings whereas women’s is more based on appearance so guys don’t really dress up to show up other guys."

I heard ESO and Star Wars mmo have really good stories, you can play those just for the stories and they’re generally gonna be very chill experiences gameplay wise.. there are good RO pservers around too.

In general no matter the game there will be a point where you get “done” with it if you go at it 16 hours a day"

explainlikeimfive,fd5n1nj,t3_ejv5sf,1578179249.0,"The answer is you only realise in Dota because you need below 80 ping to even function properly in the game. Something like 100 will severely hinder gameplay. Same with stuff like CSGO, OW and etc competitive game. 

In games like UL, Hearthstone, MMOs like WoW and FFXIV having 100-200 ping is not detrimental to the game experience. MHW is a purely pve game, so the way the game calculates the latency is different. They can always let your actions through as a player(even though you are the one who is lagging) and let the monsters suffer. 

In a pvp game this is reversed to usually hurt the lagger instead where the laggers shots/actions will be delayed."

MMORPG,fczpkzu,t1_fcz2e0f,1578106338.0,Normally you do a trailer 1 year before release and a full gameplay thing like 6 months before and that’s when you start the preorders. It’s fine if they wanna stagger the news to keep the hype buzz but it’s getting to the point where it’s either too early and the game is not even done or they changed too much and can’t get it done
