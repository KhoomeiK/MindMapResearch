myfriendwantstoknow,ff8kgby,t3_es2yjr,1579682760.0,"First of all, you’re not polyamorous if it’s not mutual between both people. If your primary partner doesn’t agree to polyamory/ isn’t aware you’re claiming to be polyamorous - then you’re not polyamorous. You’re blatantly cheating on your partner. That makes you a bitch and a slut. There is no female empowerment ideology here because a strong woman shouldn’t put down others to lift herself up. 

Second, to ghost someone all you have to do is block their number, unfriend them on FB, and unfollow them on IG. Ghosting is cutting someone out of your life, cold turkey. They should have no way of contacting you through any venue."

* The building is known as the Adelphi Wharf 1. The building is an actual, residential apartment building, which means non-competitors live in the same building as production."
