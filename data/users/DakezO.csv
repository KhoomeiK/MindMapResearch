nfl,ffi17th,t1_ffh6bd7,1579962005.0,That'll be Miami Dolphins legend Tom Brady to you.
nfl,ffguort,t1_ffgrvsf,1579915524.0,Are we setting a breakpoint on eras? Because I'd thin Chuck Bednarik could have an argument made for him (homer I know but still).

philadelphia,ffdula7,t1_ffdczbq,1579829307.0,"The Westboro baptists at military funerals ruling comes to mind, but to counter that: the Larry Flint case was ruled not protected speech, so the courts have gone both ways.

Given the majority is conservative judges, though, I would see them ruling in favor of it being a violation of free speech if the mummers were forced to court to keep their blackface."
predaddit,ffb2nch,t3_esl95o,1579750245.0,"First, same as others: Congrats!!!

Second: you will be tired, and hungry, and frustrated through a lot of this, and the moment that little kiddo looks up at you for the first time, you will know that not only was all of that worth it, but you'd go through all of that again to make sure they're happy.

Third: you will know a new level of love and joy holding that baby. I cant really describe it other than I know now that I found a meaning in life far greater than what I thought I could. My daughter is everything, and all I can think about is playing with her, and getting her to giggle, and wanting to hear her say dog or hi or mama or dada again. 

It sounds like you have an amazing support structure around you, which is so so vital. The next 9 months are going to be hectic and crazy and...honestly? At times unbelievably slow too. You're going to find out things about your relationship that will amaze you and bring you closer together (my wife and I once had a pickle buffet at 4 am while watching monty python.)

And at the end of all of that, you're going to have this little person who will amaze you every day with the things they do.

Man I want to go wake my daughter up to play blocks right now. 

Congrats man, it truly is an amazingly wonderful journey you're embarking on!"

funny,ff832s8,t1_ff7qk5i,1579664690.0,Probably not. A name like that lends itself to a more open lifestyle I imagine.

nfl,fdf95f3,t1_fdf6oqh,1578356209.0,That's what I've been trying to tell this guy.
nfl,fddhwzs,t1_fdctm2g,1578312989.0,"He grabs his facemask and uses his head to tackle him. When there is literally no reason to at all. He has Foles dead to rights and chooses to grab him by the face mask to tackle. It actually is riskier to facemask him than to wrap tackle him because of he misses the facemask, Foles makes a play.

Rather than tackle him appropriately.

If you dont think that's dirty as fuck then you won't think anything is dirty, and it makes sense why you're defending a scumbag like Clowney. I guess you'd defend Burfict as well then."

nfl,fct18g3,t1_fcsxipn,1577930249.0,"Depends on if they were even across all the games or not. Realistically, if he had one td to one int matching every game(he does) then hes not helping or hurting (technically). Theres running TDs to account for too.

Then it really is on the Bucs defense to make sure the other team doesnt score at that point.

To be clear, he isnt making things easy either."
