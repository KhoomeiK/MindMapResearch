Irrelevant.  You could have been wearing a burlap sack or full plate armor; the results would have been the same regardless.

Uhhh......Scared.  Very, very scared.

Because this is the reaction I was fearing most.  Also, how does one go about explaining something they barely comprehend in the first place?

I'm sure the millions of partners beaten, raped and killed as a result of domestic violence will be greatly relieved to hear this.

If their lives are ruined, then that will be the direct consequence of *their* criminality and immorality, and *not* my testament to same.

 Any God that would blame me for this isn't worth worshiping.  But you are right about one thing.  I do need to give myself permission to move on, which is the very definition of forgiveness.
