First thing to try is to apply some grease and thread the pedal in from the inside (opposite the damaged threads). As the pedal bolt approaches the damaged threads, it should re-tap them, boom, you're good as new.

If the pedal can't bite deeply enough to get to the damaged threads, you can buy a bolt of \*exactly\* the same size as the pedal (do a little Googling, it should be a 9/16 fine, but, note that there are left-hand and right-hand threads, one for one side, one for the other) and do the same thing.

I think it's important, though, to consider the two-prong aspect of the purpose of incarceration: one, as you point out, is a punishment intended to deter future and other wrongdoing. In this case, incarceration often fails substance abusers, and, sometimes, makes the problem worse.

The other aspect, though, protection of society, by its nature, does not consider what is best for the wrongdoer.

Couple of things, though: make sure you're not using a soft saddle cover.
