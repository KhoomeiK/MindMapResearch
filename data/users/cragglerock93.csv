MapPorn,ffj2475,t1_ffilf0h,1579988471.0,"I think you're right. Reddit in general is way too quick to look for a spooky conspiracy theory or some companies or lobbyists pulling the strings. I don't deny that those things happen (of course they do), but sometimes things just happen organically because of rapidly changing technology and culture. People used to do much more laborious jobs and housework, and had less access to cars - those changes in the past 50 years are probably more good than bad (most people want cars, and in general would rather have an office job than hard grafting in a mine or a factory), but obesity is just an unfortunate side effect of those changing lifestyles."
MapPorn,ffj1oxe,t1_ffitlcw,1579988166.0,"I don't think so.

I get that Greece is only one country and could theoretically be an outlier, but I reckon if you were to plot countries or states by obesity rate (or average BMI) and plot that against tobacco consumption (or smoking rate) then you wouldn't find a correlation.  

  

Can't speak for other countries, but in the UK smoking and obesity are both disproportionately concentrated among poorer people. I don't think smokers are on average any less fat than non-smokers."

I'm not at all trying to paint obesity as anything other than a bad thing, but surely as more people get overweight/obese, the ""stigma"" becomes less and less, and so your employment prospects don't actually get worse? It's not being overweight that's looked down on, it's being overweight relative to ""normal"" that's looked down on. And what is considered ""normal"" has shifted a huge amount in the past couple of decades, with people that are now moderately overweight considered healthy, while people that are of a healthy BMI are considered underweight by many people."
