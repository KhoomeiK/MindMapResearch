gamedev,fes1nkb,t3_eqfqy5,1579360526.0,"It depends on the studio. But these days - OpenGL is not as cross platform as it used to be (with Apple dropping support on iOS and OSX). So in general, if you are writing a cross platform engine, you will have rendering paths for OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX and possibly Metal, depending on your targets. So is OpenGL worth learning? Yes - the API's have their differences, but the underlying concepts are very similar. I mean, you are ultimately using the different API's to control the same hardware.

As for the big two engines - Unreal is not the best engine to be learning graphics programming in. There is no directly accessible shader language (or at least you have to jump through hoops to use it), and the built in material tools are more aimed at artists or technical artists. Make no mistake, it is an awesome engine though. Unity is probably better suited to learning shaders / graphics - because of the nature of it's scriptable rendering pipeline and the ease of creating shaders in the engine.

But here is my advice. Learn what you enjoy. If you really want to learn OpenGL - go for it. Write lots of code, make some demos, learn your math. Once you feel you understand the graphics pipeline well... you can start a new API if you want. But when you eventually go in for a job interview - if you have some cool, game related demos written in OpenGL - and they are using DirectX - that may not be the negative mark you might think. API's can be learned - when you learn OpenGL - you aren't really learning OpenGL. You are learning graphics programming. Make graphics programming your priority - not the API."

Libertarian,fcpheni,t1_fcpgx54,1577864176.0,"BTW - what the fuck are you guys fighting against? Most people are just saying you need to have a few more sensible regulations... it's not going to stop the problem, you've dug the hole too deep for that, but it might save a few lives every year.

Are you so scared that you'll fail those regulations? Are you part of the mentally incompetent population the NRA lobbied to give gun rights to?"
Libertarian,fcph7oz,t1_fcpgx54,1577863915.0,"And yet mass shootings in he USA are bad enough that they eclipse, each year, the number of gun deaths i've had in my country in the last twenty years.  

It's strange that in a country with the worst medical health system of the western world you'd push for more ways to hurt yourself."
Libertarian,fcpgsde,t1_fcp0ucw,1577863355.0,"So the FBI recorded 19 incidences where an armed civilian stopped a mass shooting in a five year period... There were 40+ mass shootings in 2019 alone... In almost all of those cases people were still killed. It didn't stop the body count, it just stopped it being worse.

But even with these good guys with guns... with these successful killing of mass shooters... The problem is getting worse. The number of people dying in mass shootings is rising, not falling.

If good guys with guns was the answer, deaths should be being trending down, not increasing."
Libertarian,fcpehnx,t1_fcpb36p,1577860515.0,"Your maths sucks. Your lifetime odds of dying from a mass shooting in the USA is around 1 in 11,000, and your lifetime odds of being killed from a gun related assault is 1 in 315... That's horrific. 

But your misunderstanding is probably why you don't seem to be as concerned as you should be.

EDIT: you have a higher chance of dying from gun violence than dying in a car crash in the USA! Shit..."
Libertarian,fcp8nub,t1_fcp77k4,1577854195.0,"You're not convincing anyone, you're gun death rate is so off the charts compared to any other western country that whatever you think you're doing, is not working. Unless you are actively TRYING to increase gun deaths. You know how many mass shootings we had to prevent in my country in the last year? NONE.

Edit: also. You had 10,000 deaths, for 330,000,000 odd people... So I had 3... For a country with close to 1/3rd the population of your country. You have an incredibly high chance of being shot by someone compared to me.

Also - the US is the only country I've been held up by gunpoint in. So yeah... Fuck that."
Libertarian,fcozder,t1_fcmss1x,1577845814.0,"Yeah - that was exactly my point. If a police officer whose job it is to use a weapon responsibly can't deliver under the extreme pressure of a fire fight, what chance does the average civilian have? What are you guys fighting for? Safety? Or simply the right to wield a deadly firearm? I'm genuinely confused."
Libertarian,fcowbnx,t1_fcmgejb,1577843349.0,"Well... a quick bit of research over the mass shootings in recent times shows it was police or their own hand that ended the shooting. Plus, you completely ignore the fact that even a shooting that has been stopped by that lone skilled civilian gunman, has had some fatalities before it is stopped.  It's like when Christians claim god saved that one passenger in the plane crash and forget the other two hundred dead souls. 

The fantasy of some hard nose armed civilian coming to the rescue is just not a thing. Even police panic and make bad decisions in a fire fight. Why aim for that as the baseline. I have zero chance of dying by gun fire in my country. I'm fucking terrified when I hear a car backfire in the US. What a shitty way to live."
