weddingplanning,ff6wol8,t3_ery07r,1579636432.0,"I’m paying my florist around $750 for one bridal bouquet, 7 corsages, 20 boutonnières and one Mary bouquet. My 12 bridesmaids will be having DIY faux bouquets and the centerpieces are non-floral. I’m in Chicagoland."
weddingplanning,ff6wixe,t3_eryzc8,1579636340.0,Do what you want for the ceremony! It’s the most important part!!!
aldi,ff6w2lv,t1_ff5yf2d,1579636072.0,"Same. For me, it’s for two people."
NintendoSwitch,ff5apa2,t1_ff5am83,1579585431.0,Thanks! I will look into all three.
weddingplanning,ff5a4mc,t1_ff59zpn,1579584880.0,Thank you! I’ll be in my ceremony heels (about 2”) until after the first/special dances and then I want to switch. I’ll look into these!
NintendoSwitch,ff5a1jg,t1_ff59wvu,1579584799.0,"I’ve barely played anything in my whole life! I enjoy things like racing and building. I’m a Sims on PC girl, ultimately. 

Neither of us is much into puzzle-type stuff. He’s into sports games, I am bored by that. I like horror-themed things but he doesn’t. 

Co-op is good, competition is good, too. We’re looking for something we can enjoy playing together. 


Thank you for the questions!"
NintendoSwitch,ff59mj7,t3_erbtto,1579584409.0,"My fiancé and I are not gamers in the Zelda/quest/games to “beat” sense. We’re more like Mario people, and kinda barely that, but I was gifted a Switch some time ago and want to get more into it. 

I have Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Breath of the Wild.

What might be good for for us, in terms of 2-player games? I was thinking of 1-2 Switch but it doesn’t feel like enough bang for the buck, in a way? We’re open to all sorts of recommendations, though we’re not really puzzle people. Maybe something board gamey? But excitement is good, too. I’m just overwhelmed when I try to Google such lists.

Animal Crossing looks cute but is it for adults at all?

Thanks so much!"

crafts,fe02wlh,t3_en89e3,1578801725.0,This is /r/toptalent material right here.
CrossStitch,fe00d1g,t3_eni61a,1578800039.0,"For me, it depends on the piece. For instance, I’m working on a sampler with 26 different designs, one for each letter. I’m working them one letter at a time, but each letter contains multiple colors. I finish all of one color within that letter, then do the next, etc. I backstitch and move on to the next letter. So it’s like 26 mini projects. 

When I do one project that is more of a whole, I’d simply stitch one color at a time.

But it all kind of depends on the project sometimes, generally speaking."

AskReddit,fcwdv72,t3_eixc75,1578023143.0,"I had never had a boyfriend. I was 31. I came across him on OKCupid when I was, I swear, right on the brink of deactivating. I was swiping around one last time, that kind of thing. 

I have been in love with Brendan Fraser since I was 12, and this fellow looks like him. I thought he was too good looking to ever reply to me. I ‘starred’ him and it told me we mutually liked each other! I messaged him immediately. 

That was April 5, 2018. On April 6 we started messaging on OKCupid and took it to text. We set our first date for April 11. Until then, we texted nonstop, and on April 9 we talked on the phone for the first time. On April 10 we talked for the second time. 

April 11 was our first date. April 13 was our second. By April 19 we had been on our sixth. 

April 29 was the loss of my virginity and “I love you.” (And “I love you too.”)

Fast forward... April 11, 2019 we celebrated a year and on April 13, 2019, he put a ring on it. On June 13, 2020, we’ll be married!"

- Laurie was completely miscast. Timothee Chalamet looks 12 years old. 

- We didn’t see enough of Jo/Friedrich to care much when he emerges in Concord. 

- Florence Pugh is a favorite of mine lately and she was EXCELLENT as older Amy but weirdly miscast/wrong for young Amy. 

- The non-linearity of the Jo home/Beth dying time of the movie were not to the film’s benefit."
