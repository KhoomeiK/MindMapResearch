Find a door that's easy to open, open it as quietly and slowly as you can (I'd only advise doing this if you have a key). Put pillows under your covers, make sure neighbours don't see you (wear black ideally, and if it's cold take a coat). Once outside take the safest route to your destination, stay in well lit areas where people might be, don't walk through creepy/rough areas where they could be criminals or other dangers (depends on your area) especially if you are a smaller guy or a girl.

Begbie loved fights, he'd fight friends, strangers, even beat up girls for having sub-par sex. Then there was Dick, dick wasn't violent, dick was, well, a dick. He didn't hit anyone but he knew how to use people and was the least friendly of the two (to me) he's have sex with girls before seducing the one that you'd been talking to. Dick was arguably the most popular kid in school, Begbie, thanks to his reputation for violence and mysoginy, was not. Both were nasty and sociopathic.

Funny thing is, years later I learned Begbie had a fucked up familly and an abusive, usually absent father. He was dirt poor and had a shit life, but he got it together after taking psychedelics. He's now from what I can tell a new, nice person and has been for years. As for dick, he hasn't changed from what I know. He still lives the good life due to being from an upper class familly and he never apologied to me, unlike Begbie.

In it's mildest form (this is how it is for me) it's discomfort at excessive noise or exhaustion from social interaction. I think many people can relate, excessive noise, like hearing a vacuum cleaner can trigger discomfort. A bright light when trying to sleep can be annoying. In severe autism, I can't say for sure since such people may not be able to communicate, but I imagine certain stimuli can be almost unbearable, like being extremely hungover, sleep deprived or ill, you can't stand all light and sound to the point of physical illness or pain. Basically, it's a more sensitive brain that can't block things out being bombarded by certain stimuli that others can usually just ignore.

Any neurotoxicity induced receptor damage will repair itself over time. 5HTP/Serotonin will encourage more receptors, but what you should do if you want fast repair is encourage BDNF by taking antidepressants (EDIT: certain SSRIS like Sertraline that encourage neurogenesis), and/or by eating/taking things that are good for your brain such as sources of omega 3. Don't expect immediate results though, and don't think you can start taking MDMA again, you need months, ideally years to heal. Avoid alcohol, that will damage your brain more than the MDMA. If you take 5HTP/ Antidepressants obviously font take MDMA unless it's been at least  a week without them, serotonin syndrome is not fun, I've been there and probably have some Brain damage from it.

Reminds me of Apu. The simpsons is (or was) a comedy show.

Super politically correct people wouldn't dare touch on the fact alot of shops are south asian owned, or that they have alot of kids, or whatever, they may even tell themselves it's a false racist belief that most their corner shops are run by Pakistani families,  or that an Indian accent can sound funny.

Where I live I have seen heroin needles left on the street, and people have been pricked, and the woods bear my house are full of people's old stuff they dump down the hill/ bury from the deprived neighbourhood up there. As for plants, I've notice the area of my garden my butts land grows slightly slower than the rest, so they have a point there, but we're talking about pavements here I think, not gardens."
unpopularopinion,fewklh0,t1_feuwtme,1579412755.0,"(Edit) I'm rarely in the city so I don't think much about it. Suppose next time I'm smoking in public I'll try not to drop any. At work we have proper ashtrays in the smoking shelter and I use those, but I've never seen any in the city. As for pocketing them, I suck at putting them out fully and have got some painful burns. I don't bin them because it's a fire hazard, when Mr taxman (private tax enforcer) caught me I went to bin it, he said I couldn't as it was a fire hazard. Not sure about the legality of binning it here."

unpopularopinion,feuwtme,t3_eqnofr,1579390740.0,"As a smoker, can I just say I don't do this when I can help it. Not easy though. Public ashtrays are uncommon and you can't put a ciggarette in a bin or your pocket. I still try because:

1) it's just a good thing to do

 2) if I don't I risk being fined over £100 by gov't-hired private corporations who patrol the city and (As much as legally possible) pretend to be police

Not an unpopular opinion, as a smoker I'm aware I'm being judged and that many people hate smokers, some as much as smokers hate smoking. Unfourtunatley, being hated does not
 discourage addiction, would you believe!

 Love and understanding, and feeling valued, however, does."

OCD,feufvbq,t1_feuc9vq,1579386100.0,"This is why I hate shoes indoors, nothing disgusts me more than dog crap. Luckily where I live In the UK it's a custom to take off shoes as/before you enter a house, but I hear in other places like America they don't do this. Dog mess is full of germs, it's fine of you touch some and wash your hands well, but if you touch any areas stuff can enter the body you might get ill, and sometimes seriously. My rule is that if you can smell it on something, it isn't clean, it's a bitch to get off things though (punintended).
Feet in general disgust me. I can't see other people's feet (socks are worst) and it disgusts me when people have their feet up near me. I have to sit in a position so my knee blocks my view of them usually. Sometimes I have to leave the room."

They act tough but if you don't give them power you see the thing behind them is really just a pussy, and can only feed off your misery. Don't feed the wrong wolf, that's how you change thoughts."
OCD,feu2chn,t3_eqkzfn,1579382432.0,"If a homeless person with HIV and Rabies spat on something, after 30 minutes that spit would be safe to touch, probably safe to eat. Bacteria and viruses don't live long outside the body, not the dangerous ones at least. You have an immune system. You are covered in and full of potentially deadly bacteria and viruses, everyone is, but that's good. You're full of good bacteria and viruses too, that fight the bad ones, and your main immune system fights them also. We did not evolve to this point just to be vunrable to bacteria and viruses. We are very good at fighting them off, and they suck at even living. To stop the thoughts, let them happen. Touch something, like a surface, or drink from a mug that isn't fully clean. You may feel ill, this is a placebo effect. You'll feel better and will realise doing this is safe. Do it more and more untill you're ok with it, and you will stop thinking about what might be on things. Remember, the easiest way to avoid getting ill is regular exposure to germs. Sure, you could lock yourself away in a disinfected house for the rest of your life, but then one day you get food poisoning, or a cold, and die. I have contamination fears too, but I'm able to control them, and know they don't make sense. Push your boundaries, you'll get a rush out of it and will recover over as little as a few weeks. There are 2 versions of you in the future. One is ill, maybe dying, the other is happy and healthy. Guess what? The first version is the one obsessed with being clean, the healthy one is the one who has an active immune system."
