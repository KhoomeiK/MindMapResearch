bipolar,ffbvhd1,t3_esr54w,1579784135.0,That's super cool! How did you do it?
boomershumor,ff5xx2c,t3_erprdi,1579613859.0,Big dick good. But wife bad.
badwomensanatomy,ff4nww8,t3_erfooe,1579568198.0,I'm googling how to download ejaculations.
dankmemes,ff43jga,t1_ff3nrx0,1579554759.0,Someone finally speaks the truth!
muacjdiscussion,ff1t99i,t1_ff12of0,1579485671.0,Thanks a lot! I might get a mini in Sephora and try it!
muacjdiscussion,ff1t5e7,t1_ff1178l,1579485604.0,"They sell it in El Corte Ingl√©s, just in case you come back, and the brand has a ""natural vibe"" to it. I live in a small city 1h in train from Madrid btw!"
muacjdiscussion,ff0czmv,t1_ff0b49z,1579467706.0,"It's called Etnia, check it out! Do you recommend to splurge in the hourglass one? I'm more of the noticiable highlighter kind of girl, but I guess I could use it to set my base? I go light on base products"
muacjdiscussion,fezw588,t1_fezpkku,1579462431.0,There's a Spanish brand that has one highlighter really similar though more intense. But yeah I haven't found anything similar.
MorbidReality,fevqmwp,t1_feukd63,1579400337.0,This is amazing. There's no other word to describe it. You know when a song shatters you and you don't want to listen to it but somehow you end up listening to it on repeat. Well this is my jam.
badwomensanatomy,fevnl0f,t3_eqhr9c,1579399393.0,"I'm really tiny and also have the uterus in a weird position, I don't remember the name of the condition, but it's relatively weird. And if the man is big and pounds hard, it touches the cervix and man, it's painful and I get dizzy and even nauseous..."
badwomensanatomy,fevmo0m,t1_feukmka,1579399158.0,I legit vomited.
bipolar2,feson7j,t1_fesjf50,1579367468.0,Aw man that sucks. I'm going to try and get my hands on senna infusions and miralax. Thanks a lot!
trashy,fena8ku,t1_femvs30,1579280346.0,Underrated comment.
bipolar2,femh9jd,t1_fem39az,1579255451.0,This is so very helpful! Thanks a lot!! I don't know why but sometimes I forget to stay hydrated. I'll set up an alarm to try and drink more water. Thanks a lot for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
bipolar2,felf42z,t1_feleoj1,1579220692.0,"I guess it depends on the person. Medication is a lottery (a bad one lol) I'll try to be patient, maybe it will be better with time! Thanks for replying"
trashy,feldl5h,t1_feldfia,1579219677.0,"I' obviously did not say that, but ok. I just think it would be wiser to create another kind of facilities just to avoid us people that have been abused from triggering PTSD. And there's no need to get passive aggressive, specially because I did not said anything wrong, I was talking about sensitive personal issues in order to make a point, and I did not say that I'd rather pedos be loose and committing crimes. 

Edit: typo"
bipolar,feldirw,t3_epoic0,1579219633.0,I sometimes bought the same clothing twice because I could not remember purchasing it before... But that plushie is horrifying (no offense)
Cringetopia,felcgef,t1_fekpl7r,1579218921.0,Satire
bipolar2,felalzm,t1_fel9vy2,1579217708.0,I'm useless with that kind of stuff but I'll probably post some pics about decluttering my makeup stash or tidying up my closet. Hope no one judges me because I have an offensive amount of stuff due to impulsive shopping (one of the impulses medication hasn't stopped üò≠)
trashy,felacq1,t1_fekowg0,1579217542.0,"I get it. Bipolar type 2, BPD features or BPD (no consensus) and anorexia nerviosa. I recognize mental illness too. However, I've been committed and I wouldn't want that person to be near me in the ward, tbh. I'm pretty tolerant but I won't tolerate being mocked about being abused because I'm cis (as I've been abused) , or be near a person that fantasizes with molesting children."
Cringetopia,fekzd41,t1_fekpchn,1579210758.0,The thing is that is not prostitution it's human trafficking. Not sex work.
Cringetopia,fekzaan,t1_fek1cfa,1579210711.0,"Thanks for your wisdom ""PrincessFuckFace2You"""
Cringetopia,fekz4k4,t1_fek8b4r,1579210614.0,"Yeah but that's the thing, sex work is work, human trafficking and slavery is not work."
bipolar2,feky09a,t3_epo835,1579209942.0,So cool! Great job. You motivate me

Beware."
UnconventionalMakeup,fe5xs9z,t1_fdzfynw,1578877320.0,"Thanks! It's unfair because they refused to bring it to sephora Spain while they have on the US site. And I can only get it from the UK site of abh, and it's like 70 pounds which is like 80 euros plus shipping! I snagged the vol. 2 for 52 euros. Anyway, sorry for the rant! Your look is so cool keep up"
boomershumor,fe30bbg,t3_ennjqm,1578844740.0,Nagging wife bad
bingbongtheorem,fe2olkp,t1_fdzran3,1578841244.0,I kinda want to try it. I like kids' food.

UnconventionalMakeup,fdyl789,t3_enbijj,1578780989.0,It's great!!! What eyeshadow palette(s) did you use??
bipolar2,fdxvdth,t3_en9wsn,1578773319.0,I was triggered too. I mean I loved the film so much but at that scene I was crying and shaking and I didn't realize until later. I was distraught for several days. (also bipolar type 2)
memes,fdp4jqi,t3_em2tz6,1578619831.0,Still better than most of my dates.
Cringetopia,fdp4fyd,t1_fdozc14,1578619759.0,I actually like pregnate.

bipolar,fdi9m5g,t3_elhoym,1578438212.0,All the time.
boomershumor,fdi7fxa,t3_elhbwm,1578437079.0,I don't get it?
sfx,fdgtqiu,t3_el5an0,1578408095.0,Omg that's perfect. Where did u get the tee though?
bipolar,fddpymo,t1_fddpvjr,1578320834.0,I'm 26 going on 27 and I honestly remember few things about my past and the ones I remember are pretty specific so I don't have a clue about why
bipolar,fddnanz,t3_ekrlsg,1578318519.0,I can't remember most of my childhood and teenage years. Then there's some years (like 2014 or so) that they are mostly blank. I can't understand it.
shortscarystories,fd9jpmk,t1_fczqmlu,1578234290.0,"Bpd sucks, I have that besides bipolar and man, I had to fight my way to the accurate diagnosis. However it only acts up when I'm severely manic or the meds don't work so basically I have a really mild version. Though I have enormous problems when I get obsessed about someone. So I don't do relationships and have no close feiendships. My mom is my support system. Which is more than enough for even though she is unable to understand me sometimes. And I get that. I hope you're feeling better now and you got your diagnosis. Side effects are truly horrible and I'm still fighting and recovering from anorexia nerviosa. So I'm careful with the ones that make gain weight and appetite increase or appetite loss. I don't know what a lifetime worth of pills can do to my brain and my body, let alone an underweight person, but I'm truly glad I'm feeling somewhat stable and not even similar to the point I was last year. I mean I was committed because it was a life or death matter. Good like with everything kind redditor, I'm just a pm away if you need anything. And sorry for the late and reply!"
shortscarystories,fczm4jd,t3_ejiago,1578104226.0,"Fuck this scared me more than most of the stories. I have bipolar type 2 and I have a lot of side effects that I are awful. 
Not to mention I've been misdiagnosed since 19 years old (I'm 26) so I tried a bunch of pills on the past"
bipolar2,fcxnxay,t3_ejeqaq,1578067416.0,Yes. At least it shatters me. But I can't seem to achieve complete sobriety...
trashy,fctmr0s,t1_fctk3gb,1577949262.0,It's honestly what bothered the most about this pic.
horror,fcl8zq9,t1_fcjuzwj,1577742408.0,"I know that's not gonna change your opinion of the film at all, but the actual case it is based on is one of the most famous paranormal cases in Spain and in that sense the film is spot on."
horror,fcl7y5o,t3_ehjc4t,1577741756.0,Deadgirl. Just fucking unnecessary. Vile and gross.
BadMUAs,fc93gxe,t1_fc92qqo,1577546414.0,"The eyeshadow could look flattering if the pic was with her eyes open, but that doesn't change the overuse of bronzer and contour and the weird contrast with the eye area. This is coming from someone who does like dramatic looks. I feel this look in particular could look good hadn't they messed up with the weird contour and bronzer"
BadMUAs,fc935l1,t1_fc92no8,1577546268.0,"No, I like dramatic looks. But the contour and bronzer looks really bad, especially the contrast with the eyes area"
BadMUAs,fc91o7c,t1_fc91h6b,1577545591.0,I don't think the eyeshadow is very flattering tbh.
