- [Handheld zucchini spiralizer](https://c.lpcdn.co/img/p/5ae31255acd443e8bc1e1253fc9a843b.jpg)  to make veggie noodles. The simple one, not the one with a hand crank.  Veggie noodles can be really good, and I don’t have the knife skills to do this. I just keep it in my colander. 

- (Guilty pleasure) The [half-onion container](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/98/eb/79/98eb796b61147dedcdde3e74016164f2--food-storage-kitchen-storage.jpg)  that looks like an onion. I only use a fraction of an onion for most dishes I make. This reminds me to finish using the onion, takes up less room than most of my glass containers, and prevents odors. The con is that it’s not easy to stack, but it’s the perfect proportion for an onion.

Actually, given the budget and magnitude of effects/stunts in the movie, you could do two eps on Waterworld: The movie was terrible,  but epic, and the stunt show is very, very popular.

If we had a more progressive healthcare system, like most of the first world, we’d have a population that understood how to utilize PCPs and Urgent Care resources – not relying on ambulances and ERs. 

Also, while I’m on my soapbox, privatized ambulance services in this country are a well-known joke.
