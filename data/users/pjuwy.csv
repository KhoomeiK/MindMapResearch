heartbreak,fdgdeql,t3_el563m,1578391444.0,"First, something to give the context: My girlfriend of 10 years broke up with me because of my depression and anxiety. She did it in the worst possible way making my state even worse. 

Now, the thing is that I fell bed that I am not with her anymore, but not because of her, but because of everything we used to do. When I was with her I had my safe heaven, and now I dont have anything, especially when my friends are away, when its night, when I dont work... I think you get the point. 

And I did move on, I am looking forward to meet someone new, to fall in love again. However, every now and then I get those sleepless nights when I cant think about anything else but her and how I miss everything I had with her."
