news,ffemyva,t1_ffe72es,1579855148.0,"Man this is all straight out of the storm front playbook. 
It’s like 101! At least pivot from their advice a little bit.
“When faced with an argument you can’t win, accuse them of something”

“Extremely paranoid”... so, uh, what exactly am I paranoid about? 

Paranoia implies that I’m worried/obsessed/concentrated on something that is made up, or not happening, or make believe.
Everything I’ve talked about it objective, everything in that last post is all objective stuff that has happened and is readily available with very basic google skills.

To call that rant insane is really subjective, and really depends on which side you support. Looking at the votes up and down, it sure looks like my rant (I’ll admit it was certainly a rant) doesn’t look insane to anyone who doesn’t put their lips to Trumps ass every day.

As for “this shit is not healthy for you”, that’s just laughable, but dang I really appreciate that you care. I’m lucky to have a great job in tech, with great benefits. But i Dont even want to think about if I didn’t have health benefits and how much trouble I’d be in. Good thing Trump gutted Obamacare, the biggest and most worthwhile step that we had towards the single payer healthcare that THE REST OF THE FIRST WORLD HAS (and a lot of the “shit hole countries” as Trump would say have it too). Even with health insurance, any really serious diagnosis would financially destroy most everyone, but sure would benefit those share holders of the HMO’s Trump is best buddies with.

And finally, as for me “becoming radicalized”... I shutter to think about myself being added to the long list of domestic terrorists, and the shame that I’d be one of the only liberal terrorists on that list that is almost exclusively filled with conservative Trump supporters who have been radicalized and driven their car into protests, taken guns into pizza places and shot it up, shot up handfuls of other places and killed SO many innocent Americans in the name of Trump.

Just right now I’m listening to the most recent Pro Publica podcast about the Trump inauguration committee and how the Trumps charged the committee $175,000 a day, 4 days for $700,000.... according to government auditors that is 10 times higher than the going rate for any other similar space. Of course, Ivanka Trump directly instructed Tom Barrack (Chairman of the Inaugural Committee) that the Trump Washington is the only place that will
Be considered and it WILL be booked. And who answered the email for Barrack regarding the rate and the booking of the space? Well wouldn’t you know it?! Ivanka Trump was in charge of handling that booking for the hotel! And she quoted him $175,000 a day, as I said, 10x the cost of other similar rated hotels during the same week.
So he hadn’t even taken office yet, and he’s already started swindling the government for all that they could. 

But i doubt you respond to this. And if you do, you don’t address any of the items i discuss about Trump. You won’t talk about his inaugural committee spent their 100 million, (double the budget for the 2nd most expensive inauguration committee, Bushes, who had 50 million, and whose committee chief said Trumps 100 million budget was “fucking insane!” And wanted to know where the money went).

You won’t talk about that. You won’t talk about why they won’t let witnesses testify at the impeachment. You won’t talk about why trump refuses to let any of his people testify. You won’t talk about why he won’t release his tax returns and keeps coming up with new reasons why. You won’t talk about his non stop lies. You won’t talk about his proven daily lies and why we should trust him when he shows us daily that he lies to our face about things that are easy to proven false.

You’ll attack me. You’ll accuse me of this and that. And feign concern. You’ll do anything you can to not talk about the facts and the things I brought up. But hey. That’s how it goes when you talk to Trumpers. You accuse me of non sense (check my history, I rarely ever talk about Trump or politics, but your storm front directives tell you to pivot and accuse me of things instead of talking about the subject, so oh well).

Either way, bring on your bullshit."

Taking someone addicted to heroin who gets caught with it for the third time and throwing them in prison with true hardened criminals for a few years means when they come out they no longer have any chance to find a good job, and the rest of their life will be a huge struggle just to get by. What are the chances this person will stay clean, and will stay on the right side of the law??

I’d say it’s slim to none. Now what if we offered comprehensive rehab for that person, life skills, job training, behavior therapy, and when they got out they weren’t branded as a convicted felon ensuring that they only have access to jobs that are really hurting for untrained people?

news,ffdzjtn,t1_ffckmm4,1579832851.0,"If you are going to compare Trumps open flouting of the law and blatant disregard for checks and balances to Obama’s mistakes and (rare) controversies and missteps, there’s no point continuing this.

I don’t have enough room in this post to list all the shit Trump has done. Completely done away with all the norms and standards set before him, like releasing his tax returns (excuse after excuse after excuse), not putting his business in a blind trust (remember that joke of a presser with all the stacks of fucking paper! Holy shit what a joke that apparently you fell for) his total swindle of the election committee holding it at his own hotel that he jacked up the rates for, his seemingly third residence on the golf course, his second residence being the White House and his first residence is Mar-A-Lago where he charges crazy rates to secret service for the rooms that are required for his security so they now stay at a motel off site and his willingness to do top secret stuff in the open in front of guests (many Kant reports). His endless carousel of a cabinet where every member is fired via tweet and then inevitably tells the world what a fucking nut job he is.

It’s incomparable. Comparing him to Obama with a straight face is proof enough to me that you aren’t worth arguing with because you’re too far down the rabbit hole. Comparing him to Bush with a straight face too. Even comparing him to Reagan or Nixon with a straight Face is the same. It’s not that he’s Republican. There’s a dozen republicans I’d take in a heartbeat over him. It’s that he’s so far and away the most corrupt president we’ve ever had, and that’s including the William McKinleys, and the Andrew Johnson’s too.

The point of my original post was talking about Obama’s faults and fuckups, and contrasting those with Trumps to show that they are so much worse than Obama’s. Had 44 done any one of the dozens of things Trump has done then you can guarantee that the Democrats would be hounding him about them. There’s polls and state to back it up that democrats don’t like certain things and will lash out against them, whether it’s done by a democrat or a republican. But conservatives don’t care about the issue, only who does it. If Barry did it, they’d be up in arms, but if Trump did it, it would be a-ok! It was even a Fox News poll too.
Before you ask, no I’m not going go get the source and send it to you. You will likely not read it, and if you do, either you won’t address it or you will spin it.

Never before has a president had so much opposition from so Many places. The CIA hates him, the NSA and the FBI. The joint chiefs. 95% of his cabinet will hit a point that their conscious will not allow them to continue in the face of such outright incompetence and corruption, and either resign or defy him and get fired, in which case they all go public with their disdain. Members of his own party created the Never Trump movement. Everyone he has done business with in the past have nothing but bad things to say about his shady dealings. He lies to the nation every single day, often about such inconsequential things that are so easy to prove wrong. But every day people like you swallow the bullshit he is pedaling and you smile and swallow it down and ask for more.

I wonder if their is a newsletter that goes out with talking points and the most recent one introduced the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and told you all to start pushing it, because I had never heard it before 2 weeks ago and now it’s everywhere.
If def exists though! It exists because after 3 years of him constantly lying through his bullshjf fake saccharine smile, all of his supporters have yet to make any kind of realization that he is fucking Americans in the ass for his own profit. Look at the stats revolving his tax cut! It sure did help out the 1% and it sure did help out the biggest American businesses, but the majority of Americans sure didn’t benefit from it. But I’m sure all those CEO’s are just waiting for the right time to take all the money they saved in taxes and give everyone a raise. I’m SURE it coming. Just like that carrier plant he loved talking about how he was going to save it, and all those jobs. I seen to remember the CEO getting a ton of money and tax cuts to keep the plant open, and he even said it will stay open while they build the new automated plant, but those jobs will he gone soon enough.

So yeah, people do have Trump Derangemeht Syndrome, it’s like Idiocracy when you look from left to right and see people cheering as they are getting fucked. And see republican senators terrified of letting any witnesses testify before Congress, even though they won’t shut up about how there is nothing there. And how Trump refuses to let anyone from the Whitehouse testify, but still, there’s “nothing there”, but under no circumstances will they testify. Because that would be too easy, right? It would be too easy to let them all testify under oath and prove all the slimy democrats wrong. Just like to would be too easy to release his tax returns and show that there’s nothing there at all and it’s all on the up and up. And how he’s not actually running his business at all, he’s totally divorced from his company, but it would be too easy to actually put it in a blind trust.

We just have to take his work for it. The PROVEN (I can’t stress enough how much this is proven, and objective, and factual) most dishonest president that has lied every single day in one way or the other (proven lies that are clearly not true).., we just have to take his word for it.

So yeah, I have TDS, that you people are so dense that you’re still smiling and nodding and don’t care at all to see who the man behind the curtain is. And don’t want the truth at all.

But history is on my side. And he will go down in history as the biggest disaster to hit our democracy, and in time everyone who voted for him will either deny they ever did out of embarrassment, or have some excuse as to why they fell for it."

Tell me again, how many Americans died with Kling-On death grip versus Mandolorian Disintegration? 

Don’t have the numbers? Maybe cause the numbers don’t exist and no one knows, just like Mexican cartels and Saudi terrorism.

One thing we do know. The Saudis have supported terrorism for decades. And the Saudi’s are currently committing genocide in Yemen. And the weapons sold to cartels are small caliber rifles and pistols and shotguns used in small skirmishes man to man. And the weapons sold to the Saudi’s are billions of dollars worth of high grade mass casualty weapons capable of destroying city blocks and killing people by the bus full.
And the point of selling to the Mexican Cartels is to gather info so we can stop them for good at the higher levels. The point of selling the Saudi’s is... wait what was the point of selling to the Saudi’s again???!!!

These are necessary comparisons to drive home the fact that fast and furious was manufactured controversy by republicans and not actually something that either side was worried about. The fact that the weapons sale to the Saudi’s has way more worrying outcomes, but no one is really making a fuss out of it, shows that F&F looking for something to fuss over, with nothing really of substance being there.

news,ff72zs4,t1_ff5w6a0,1579640093.0,"In some ways. Similar to JFK being a conspiracy theory.

Yes it happened. Yes the Arizona ATF set up for legal gun sellers to sell to people with Cartel connections who couldn’t normally get guns.
These guns were bugged and being tracked, and so after they were smuggled across the southern border they were then sold to drug cartels.

This info gave the ATF a big picture about how cartels were getting their guns, and who was involved.

It’s the same idea of local police allowing drug addicts to make drug buys, while wearing a wire, so they can go after the bigger dealers; who would actually make a difference when taken down.

But it becomes a conspiracy and nothing burger when republicans get ahold of it and turn it into
this giant fake controversy because they’re so desperate to have something they can clutch their pearls about.

Especially nowadays when Trumps new scandal every week looks even more ridiculous when you compare it to Obama’s jaw dropping scandals like “Wearing a tan suit”, “Using Dijon mustard” and “being born black”."
news,ff71bjt,t1_ff5kvtl,1579639152.0,"Not denying that *something* happened.

The Arizona ATF had licensed gun sellers sell to illegal straw buyers, who would in turn sell them to drug cartels. The whole time these weapons were being tracked, with the goal being that you could learn more about how the cartels were getting their hands on US weapons. Through this process and investigation, you can see how this operation works, how they acquire the guns, what kind of players are involved and at what level, how they get funneled down south, and then get distributed.
You also get info on what cartels are currently buying and who the major players within the organization are.
It’s the same concept as letting drug addicts continue to make drug buys while wired up, so you can get to the higher level guys, who actually matter.
It’s a common tactic, used by many governments around the world.

To be honest, it’s really a toss up about “who is worse?” And “between the two, who would you rather NOT have a gun” between Mexican Cartels and Saudi Arabia. Considering we’re selling weapons to both. 
Yes, Mexican drug cartels are terribly violent and commit heinous acts with these weapons, but right now Saudi’s are committing genocide in Yemen, using weapons Trump sold them as part of the big arms deal Trump wouldn’t shut up about.

So, yes Fast and Furious happened, and yes it was poorly planned and executed, but it’s also a fairly common tactic, and the idea to get the access to higher ups was a decent one.
It was basically another nothing burger, as members of the right tried as hard as they could to conjure up a scandal that would be worthwhile, but consistently failed.
Since Obama almost never did anything illegal, or scandalous, and was very reserved with his words, they had controversies to go on and so they had create these mountains out of nothing.
I’m not someone who refuses to criticize Obama, either. I had such high hopes for him, and while he did accomplish some things I’m very happy about (Obamacare being one, even though it was totally bastardized by Congressional Republicans, and a couple POS’s from his own party), he did some things that were very disappointing:
-Not fully holding the bankers accountable for the 2008 Financial Crisis
-Expanded Drone Strike
-Involvement in Libya at all
-Response to Syrian Civil War
-Lack of accountability for CIA Torture Program
-Response to Edward Snowden
-Response to Chelsea/Bradley Manning
-Failed and Misguided attempts to work with Republicans and “play ball” and end partisan “one-ups-manship” that just ended with them continuing to be total pieces of shit even when he wouldn’t badmouth them or point fingers at them for the sorry state they left the country in after Bush.

All those things are worth criticism, but Republicans try so hard for these grand conspiracy nothing burgers like Benghazi and Fast and Furious instead. And when you have Repubs screaming about Hilary’s emails, while at the same time Trump and his kids (who are Sr Advisers to the Pres) use unsecured iphones, and Ivanka uses and unsecured email server, it’s so fucking hypocritical and full of projection.

That’s just one example, but if I had the time, for every knock on Obama that Republicans scream about, I can provide at least 1 (most of the time I can provide 3-5) examples of Trump doing either the exact same thing, OR, more often, something SOOO MUCH WORSE AND BLATANTLY ILLEGAL.

Let’s remember, on top of all of that stuff, Trump started his presidency he refusing to step away from his own business or put the company into a blind trust, even for 4 years. And also, his refusal to release tax returns, coming up with excuse after excuse why he can’t do it.
The only people in the world who believe his bullshit are his every day American supporters, cause you know he, and his cabinet/family knows it’s all bullshit and don’t believe it even though they nod along with him."

I’m lucky enough to have a job where I can check reddit, and my phone while there, but some people don’t. It hasn’t been a week, or even a day. 2 blues after the guy comments, and hasn’t provided sources and “erhmagerddd!!”

But here ya go, I did a 5 second google and found this, the second return.


https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/brettedkins/2016/12/13/trump-benefited-from-overwhelmingly-negative-tone-of-election-news-coverage-study-finds/amp/

One thing I do want to point out is that the top return was a similar, different study, although THAT study showed that Trump actually received more negative coverage than Clinton did.

So it’s safe to say that despite their being multiple (at least 2, the top 2 google results) on the issue, nothing is decided since they disagree with each other. As I said, I only looked at 2 articles, but it’s worth noting that one study included Fox News in their study and one did not. I think it’s a big mistake to not include Fox News’ coverage in their aggregate, considering a big portion of the country get their news exclusively from Fox News. 

Whereas liberal leanings Americans have a couple choices where they go get news that is either non partisan or left leaning (some try harder than others. And some are blatantly left leaning) it’s pretty widely accepted that their is only one place on American on cable TV to get news that is conservative leanings, and that is a Fox News. And so, any study that doesn’t include Fox News in their calculus of which canid aye recieved what kind of coverage, is very incomplete if they don’t include the place that most republicans rely upon for cable news.

So, Bruh, the fuck? There’s your source. It exists. Multiple exist. In 2020, where there’s a fucking academic study for everything, even things that are so fundamentally and scientifically wrong (like the fact that global warming exists. Even if you think it’s a normal cycle of warming and cooling, denying that we are undeniably in a state of unprecedented warming that is at the very least being assisted by fossil fuels) than why wouldn’t there be a study into something so relevant as the total negative/positive coverage of on candidate versus the other in the 2016 election?

But, congrats, OP didn’t respond immediately with his sources of the phantom study. You won!!!

politics,feie8mv,t1_fei8y8a,1579136462.0,"I mean, do you object to all that? Did you think critically about it? Or did you just perceive it as a Trump diss and blindly lash out?
Which part do you object to? That Trump was Shit on by CNN, but consistently given screen time uninterrupted? Is that not true?
When you look at the collective big picture, is it that Hilary received more bad coverage on the aggregate? When you figure that Fox News was decidedly against Hilary and not airing positive prices about her, and factor that for the most part CNN and MSNBC were anti trump but trying (if only ay the surface level) to try and appear fair and balanced, I think it’s reasonable to assume that the coverage might end up with Hilary having a small edge in terms of more negative coverage.
If MSNBC and CNN are airing 65 percent bad coverage versus 35 just coverage, versus 55 percent good coverage of Hilary and 45 percent bad coverage (don’t forget the stories about her emails, and the fbi investigation which got substantial air time throughout the campaign), and also include Fox News airing likely 90/10 good coverage to bad coverage for Trump, and the inverse for Hilary, 90 bad coverage versus 10 good, then it’s reasonable that Hilary would have the edge for bad coverage.

She had some bad stories pop up during the campaign that got substantial coverage. Iv
Mentioned 2 big ones, but have left out other big stories like the whole Pizzagate non sense, and
Podesta emails, and other nothing burgees that Fox News ran with, and CNN and MSNBC also covered extensively in an effort to be perceived as non partisan. Trump also had tons, and tons, (and tons, and tons, and god damn near non stop) bad stories pop up, cause he couldn’t shut
Up or get out of his own way, and because he’s been that way his whole life and so there’s a lifetime of bad videos and audio clips and stories just waiting to be released...

But the Fox News reality of being blatantly partisan in every single way besides their slogan, means flag their coverage is overwhelmingly bad for one candidate and good for another, and swing the total amount of coverage for a candidate into the “Bad” area.

 But, please, let me know what part of that you disagree with. I tried to do my best to present it fairly and transparently, 

It’s unfortunate, but I’ve had enough conversations with Trump supporters on Reddit that hoping for the bare minimum in civil discourse, (that each side argues in good faith, acknowledging facts and reality while still supporting one side or the other) almost feels like a lost cause.

So in a couple years when it has has spiraled out of control and we are at war with Russia, Iran, Syria, and a handful of other countries, and Israel is wiped off the map, and we have a handful of new 9/11’s and pearl harbors to “never forget”, you can say “this was worth it because of Benghazi.”"

I guess keep in mind reading any further that I’m a “left winger”, but my take on it is:
Regardless of whether what the right is saying is true, or the what the left is saying is true regarding this guy and what he has done and who he supports, the real question is, should we have attacked him?
He isn’t some leader of a state-less militia or organization. He is the leader of a bona fide, official wing of the Iranian military. And even if he is actively supporting our enemies, are we prepared to assassinate the general of a wing of the Iranian military?

And when you boil it down even further: Are we prepared to go to war with Iran?
Because we just assassinated the leader of the QUD force of the Revolutionary guard.
It’s the same as if Iran assassinated the Chief of Naval Operations, or the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Had that happened, we would not issue statements, or just launch an isolated proportional missile response... we would declare war, and we would attack.

And I fear that currently they are preparing to do the same, and in hours, nor days, we will formally be at war with Iran. 

And do not be mistaken, this is not the same as war with Afghanistan, or even war with Iraq. Iran is so far ahead of either of them in their capabilities. And Iran can shut down the straight of Hormuz, where an immense amount of our shipping goes through, which will lead to immediate fiscal repercussions for us in the very short term.

I am no fan of Donald Trump. Truth be told there is not a person on this planet I dislike more. Even serial killers and openly evil people I dislike less because while they may have killed and tortured dozens, Donald Trump will do so much more damage and kill so many more before he is through. But all that aside, I am just so worried that this was just an attempt to shift focus away from his impeachment. It’s a proven tactic of his when faced with scandal to do something drastic (see banning Trans people in military, or a dozen other acts of his). Except this time it wasn’t forcing patriotic citizens out of their careers, it was him starting a war that will have such widespread, catastrophic consequences for all of us that will be felt for the rest of my lifetime for certain. And knowing his personal MO on national security, and military matters, (does not read briefings, does not listen to military experts, insists he knows more than them, and does not see 2 moves ahead, let alone 3 or 4 moves ahead to try and understand and predict the repercussions of his actions), I am terrified that he just heard that they found the leader of the QUD, and saw an opportunity to kill this guy and to own the news cycle, not listening to experts or understanding that this won’t just own the news cycle, this is an act of war that will lead to so much carnage and so much pain for so many across the world.

I am terrified. You should be too. And not just for Americans and Iranians, but for the rest of the world. This could be how WW3 starts, and this guy could be our very own Franz Ferdinand."

They are talking about after a couple years of non use.

Also, no one is BUYING a used 2k treadmill cause there are so many ones available for $50 or for free!
There are responses on here of people saying they do the same thing.
I just looked on Craigslist and saw “I bought my wife the bow flex tread climber for 2k and she said it was too hard and now I I’ll let it go for $300 plus delivery, $200 if you pick it up.”

There’s a thread full of people disagreeing with you. There’s craigslist ads all over the country disagreeing with you, but you keep on doing you.

I know you would rather junk it and waste $1950 instead of getting $50 for it, but not everyone else is as ridiculous as you.
Other people try selling it for $1900 cause “it was bought for 2k, and only used once!”. Then after a few months it drops to $1500. And then $1000.
And maybe it stays at $1000 for over a year, but you realize NO ONE IS BUYING IT, BECAUSE PEOPLE BUY TONS OF THESE MACHINES AT NEW YEARS AND THEY DONT GET USED.

And then eventually you have to move, or your wife gets sick of looking at it and says “either you get rid of it this weekend or I’m paying someone to come take it away”, and so you finally break down and post “$200 OBO MUST PICK UP THIS WEEKEND. MUST GO!” And some guy says “$50 and I’ll come get it right now” and you say “fine.”

And that’s how a $2000 piece of equipment is sold for $50.
It’s because so many stupid people buy it for New Years or a fitness kick, and never use it, then spend years trying to sell it, but NO ONE BUYS THIS STUFF USED. And so eventually you just don’t care and just want that 15 sq feet of your house it’s occupying back.

I have no idea how you’re denying this happens when everyone here is like “yup, I did this”. But you still say “nope, NO ONE WOULD DO THIS!”

Do this, go on Craigslist and find treadmills for $750, or $1000, and write down the description.
Then come back 3 months later and see how Many are:
1-Still there, same price
2-Still there, Lower price

Then come back a year later and see if you can spot a piece of equipment that was $1000 a year ago, now listed as “Free, must go” cause after a year, no one sold it.

Also; to your whole “if they can’t sell it, they’d just junk it instead”
What happens if they don’t have a truck, or a way of getting it to the dump?
Then they need to hire someone to pick it up, and are therefore paying someone else to pick it up, and paying the dump to take it... when instead they could just list it as “Free, come pick up”

And again, that’s how you get 2k exercise equipment for free or $50.

This isn’t rocket science. It’s human nature. You can deny it happens, in spite of all the stories about it happening."
videos,fcs76i3,t1_fcs20np,1577912393.0,"You think that, but after a few years of no one buying it, that “few hundred bucks” becomes $50 and eventually becomes “just come pick it up out of my living room and it’s free”"
newtothenavy,fbv5e4f,t1_fbslglq,1577125749.0,"Just throwing in some extra info to what you said about everyone uniting against a leader.

I was out on cruise with an AE2, as an AT3. We were a small Det, if only 35 guys, and we’d been together a while, so everyone was on last names.

That AE2 was not liked, and as the lowest ranking guy on cruise (the only 3rd class), he decided I couldn’t call him by his last name, I had to address him as AE2, or Petty Officer. 
Roger that, shipmate. You can be AE2, I don’t care.
The next day in the shop all the firsts decided AE2 has to call then by their titles too, so if he wants me to call him AE2, then he better be prepared to call everyone else by their titles too.

Don’t shit down the chain without an umbrella."
