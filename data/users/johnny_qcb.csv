TumblrInAction,ffav1vz,t1_ffamrfh,1579745155.0,"I did keto for a while with not working out, and I lost a lot of weight. It definitely works, but the biggest downfall of it is it's not sustainable unless you have an iron will. It's EXTREMELY restrictive, and I definitely couldn't stick to it. It did teach me some better habits and made me way more cognizant of how much sugar is in EVERYTHING. I'm not keto at this point, but I'm definitely making better choices."
AskReddit,ffau63s,t3_esi1iu,1579744568.0,"I worked at Movie Gallery (same company owned Hollywood Video) while I was finishing up college in 2008. It was in a small, non tech-savvy town, so we had pretty decent traffic up until it died. I think the biggest red flag to me was their last ditch effort to capitalize on some kind of monthly subscription plan by starting something called ""PowerPlay"". It was very similar to the plan blockbuster had but it was WAY more convoluted and expensive. I don't remember the full details, but they had an unlimited plan that was like $40 a month which let you rent an unlimited amount of movies and games and keep them for as long as you wanted, which sounds great, but the kicker was you could only have ONE thing checked out at a time, which was super inconvenient. They had lower tiers of the plan, but they worked off of some kind of points system which was so arbitrary and nonsensical.

I remember like a month before we closed, the district manager came in and made me an assistant manager (although I never did get a raise before the store went under), and he was talking to me about getting me into a store manager development training program. As a 21 year old kid who loved movies and games and genuinely enjoyed his job, I was getting pretty excited about it honestly. Then a month later it was done. I remember being kinda sad, but I went out to eat that night with a couple buddies I made working there, and we ended up getting drunk and having an awesome time reminiscing. One of my coworkers and I would ALWAYS put on Lost DVDs in the store while we were working, and SO many people would stop and watch it for several minutes and ask us really enthusiastically, ""Hey, what IS this movie?!"", and we'd proceed to show them the season 1 Lost DVDs. So many people would end up renting it. I wonder how many people in the end that we turned on to Lost. Still friends with that coworker to this day."
