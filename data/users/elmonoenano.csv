That said, the biggest impact is if this is behavior we want to normalize. The GWOT has caused all sorts of negative actions that we object. The Chinese justify the Uighur camps as a measure to prevent terrorism. Burma used terrorism as a justification for the Rohingya genocide. India used it as a justification for its new citizenship law and its actions in Kashmir. So, will we have people making drone strikes on leadership in political disputes from no on?

dancarlin,fdrmj5k,t3_emnolj,1578686635.0,"It needs to be pointed out that this is more likely under the 2002 AUMF than the 2001 AUMF. There's also pretty big questions about what definition of imminence is being used, whether this was a preventative or preemptive strike, and if it can be labeled as a targeted killing or not. These terms all have very specific legal definitions in the national security legal space. Until you make an assessment about those terms it's hard to say whether it's legal or not. If this was done under the 2001 AUMF I think it's probably illegal, but under the 2002 AUMF it's an open question. If it's a preventative strike it's probably illegal. If it's a preemptive strike it's probably legal. To determine if it's preventative or preemptive you have to know if a threat was imminent. This stuff is really complicated. That works in the president's favor b/c how many of you already tuned me out.    


Lawfare Blog had a good post on the legal factors to look at for this attack. IMO, it was illegal b/c Soleimani is not an operational agent so his death wouldn't impact an operational mission. But so what. If no one in congress does anything, and Mitch McConnell will see to that, then it will become a precedent in future natsec decision making.

dancarlin,fdrlc8g,t1_fdq6eck,1578686201.0,The administration hasn't released an legal justification so far as I know but I think this most likely falls under the 2002 AUMF. Some of the issues of interpretation and scope overlap but I don't think this is applicable to this situation.
dancarlin,fdrl2v0,t1_fdq3x4s,1578686057.0,"I don't 100% agree with this statement. I think a few congressmen and senators have tried to limit war powers and a few more have done it intermittently. But those efforts amount to nothing. But guys like Sanders and sometimes Ron Paul or Jeff Merkely do occasionally bring up a bill or something that goes nowhere. Pelosi's current action is more a political stunt in my opinion, but with no consequences b/c it won't go anywhere in the Senate.  


But, with that pretty small quibble out of the way, You're dead on about congress absenting themselves from their appropriations respsonsiblities. Pro Publica has had a number of stories on problems in the Navy and Marines that shows the military leadership's desire for new toys leads them to neglect sailors and marines and put their lives in danger. There's a decent bit of evidence that SOF are overworked and suffering some erosion of ethics due to their constant non-stop use in the GWOT.  


The most damning thing that backs up your point is that there were 0 hearings about misuse of the funds, lack of strategic goals or vision, and lack of plan or goal for the GWOT in Afghanistan and Iraq before the last appropriations bill even though the WaPo had just released a huge story about the failures in Afghanistan.  The fact that they've pawned off SIGAR instead of making it a special congressional committee is evidence that they no longer take their responsibility seriously.  


The SIGAR thing really bothers me the most b/c during WWII, Truman used his position as committee chairman into wartime waste and fraud to propel his national image and it lead pretty directly to his presidency. The fact that no congressman wants to either do the work or risk a serious look at misappropriations says something pretty important about American society overall."

dancarlin,fcyp5l1,t3_ejkih6,1578084260.0,"No, for a whole bunch of reasons, no complex network of treaties, no similar military strength, no network of allies, no history of consequential global conflict since the 1400s, no separatist groups that can use it for their benefit, no will for open conflict in either the US population or Iranian population and especially not the Iranian government.   


The last time Iran and the US got into an open conflict was in the late 80s. The US basically wiped out the Iranian Navy in a morning and killed an airplane full of Iranian civilians. Iran, maybe, shot down one helicopter. The lesson Iran learned is that they can get a lot more done through proxies and secondary attacks.  


The US mine sweeping fleet is currently, and very publicly, suffering from equipment and training lapses the severely hinder its effectiveness. A low cost, low conflict opportunity for Iran is to release a lot of mines in the Straight of Hormuz. Iraq is a shit show and the US and Iraqi government has very little support so Iran can continue arming proxies and encouraging their attacks on the US. The US has basically dropped its pants in Syria and Iran has lots of proxy power there. There's also the possibility of increased missile attacks on Saudis and Isrealis, hostage taking by Hezbollah in Lebanon, and as Iran showed in Argentina and through assassinations of Kurds in Europe, they can create a lot of nuisance attacks that are hard to attribute back to them. Some mix of this stuff is the most likely outcome b/c the US has isolated itself from its allies so it would make it very hard for the US to strike back.

The current problem is that there's a lot of chatter by people who don't know what they're talking about in the media. People are just learning Soleimani's name and then commenting like their opinion matters. Almost all the current takes out there are bad. They're ignorant of the history, of Iran's point of view, and are trying to wedge the last two weeks activity into some overarching Putin/military industrial complex narrative that isn't how Iran or the US operates."

I understand this is a different situation b/c the President is impeached, this escalates tensions with a nation state and not with a group that doesn't have national associations, but I would assume similar things have happened in Yemen and have definitely happened with unrecognized state actors in Somalia."

I live by one of, if not the, largest independent book stores in the country and it's about a 2 hour drive from where Dan lives and he hasn't done a book signing or talk there. It's kind of nuts b/c he would pack the place and easily sell 20 or 30 copies. I know they'd love to have him. There's also some popular book stores in Seattle and the bay area. You would think his publisher would pay for at least a mini book tour on a couple of weekends. A round trip train ticket from Eugene to Seattle is only like $100. Considering how few books it takes to get on a best sellers list and what he could sell between Portland, Seattle, Eugene, and San Francisco/Oakland/Berkeley I'm kind of surprised. He could have easily had a best seller."

I read a bunch of stuff I wasn't thrilled with and finished in early December and just vegged. I started Postwar at the end of January and it was the best thing I'd read in over a year and I way would have rather read that than half the books I had read the year before. It was the same thing with the Evans's book.

philosophy,fcqa3d9,t1_fcon9e2,1577881919.0,"I think it ties into the argument between Christopher Browning and Daniel Goldhagen. I'm more on the Browning side. There's been some new work on the Rwandan genocide that found the reach of the propaganda radio addresses was pretty limited and that things like social pressure and norms and a sort of ""boiling frog"" effect are more relevant to predicting who would participate in a genocide. I don't really buy into a special wave of anti-semitism as being very important to the holocaust. Groups like Jehovah's Witnesses suffered elimination at a higher percentage rate than Jewish people did and I think those kinds of weird secondary groups that were the target of animus but weren't central to the propaganda of the reich throw a wrench in the theory that anti-semitism played an outsize role in German/Ukranian/Polish/Romanian/et al society than in other countries."
philosophy,fcolcfm,t1_fcnzakr,1577835128.0,"I don't 100% agree with you but your dead on with Eichmann's antisemitism. He bought in hook, line and sinker. People do make a fundamental error when reading Arendt's work on the Eichmann trial. She wasn't a journalist. What she did was use the trial as a means of supporting her already existing theory about the nature of evil. So, her impressions of what happened there weren't open minded and objective. 

That doesn't mean they were bad or wrong, but you have to read it understanding she had an agenda and look at other sources. You see a similar problem with the psychologists who interviewed Eichmann. Initially they said he was very normal, but his actions were so evil they had to revise their findings to fit the narrative to recognize the evil they were encountering.

Deborah Lipstadt has a book about the Eichmann trial that tries to address some of that, but has it's own biases. I think by reading the two books you get a more nuanced picture.  


One thing about Eichmann was that he probably very much did see himself as a good guy. He was a hard worker carrying out the law and doing a good job of it. He just lacked or was unwilling to use his moral imagination to examine whether the law was immoral and then think about what obligation that placed on him."
scifi,fcm9j09,t3_ehwi5t,1577767899.0,"I enjoy both shows and I'm not trying to drag the Mandalorian but it does feel kind of substanceless. I liked the last episode and wish there was more of that tension throughout the season. But it seems like next season will be more of the same.  


I kind of wonder if anyone would still be talking about the Mandalorian if you could binge it. I watched the Witcher in two days and will rewatch it again at least once. If the Mandalorian had been available all at once I probably would have watched it in one night and maybe talked about it for a couple days and I think that would have been it. I was out of town last week and saw the last episode yesterday and it already feels kind of hazy.  But I've been talking up the Witcher and answering my friends questions about it pretty much continuously since it came out. 

I think a big part of that is I care about how Geralt relates to Ciri, Yen, Triss, and Jaskier. I'm looking foward to seeing him with them next season and to new relationships with Vesemir or Craite or Cahir.  There aren't really any relationships like that in the Mandalorian. He's got the kid but there's not much there, especially if you compare it to something like Lone Wolf and Cub.  I don't know how sustainable that will be."
