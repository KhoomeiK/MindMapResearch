SeattleWA,fgkijze,t3_ez0hqh,1580866377.0,"Within the city it seems reasonable that they are allowed to drive in the far left lanes because of left lane merging ramps and just merging traffic in general.

Once you get out of the city the only time a semi is in the left lane is to pass slower traffic. 

Try not to complain about semi drivers. Everything you own was probably hauled by a semi driver. They work hard and dangerous jobs to feed us greedy and rude people who don’t take the time of day to be thankful someone’s doing that job."

You can’t tell from this video if there is an underlying ice layer anywhere in this slab. The snow moving could be an indicator though.

All I’m saying this this could be from other things rather than the snow melting."
FreezingFuckingCold,fg6l5gh,t1_fg4zmdt,1580570853.0,"That’s not true. The snow could have become to heavy to hold itself up and there might have been an ice layer under all that slab.

It just sucks for everyone involved and it is not fair to the dog what so ever. It’s the owners responsibility to protect the pup.. and when dogs aren’t leashes so many bad things can happen."

Seattle,fg1wbwn,t3_ewfp0s,1580434181.0,"Hi, I kind of work with insulation a little. 

Depending on where you are in south Seattle you will be getting a lot of airplane noise from the King Co. and SeaTac airports. Without insulation in your home you will be able to hear a lot of the air traffic. But good thing you have newish, double pain windows which will help some. 

Is heating electric? Gas? Oil? Depending on what you use, it could cost you more in the long run to not have proper insulation. You could try renting a thermal gun and aim it at the walls to get a good idea where colder temperatures are leaking through.

The good news is that it’s pretty easy (I don’t know if this is the right word maybe accessible?) to install insulation, especially since you don’t have any to remove."
Seattle,ffub3rs,t3_ev9jkj,1580238253.0,"Why do you care how other people use their wipers? Like how does it affect you personally?

Do you just like shitting on other people to make you feel better about yourself? Like I don’t understand how this can even be a “rant”. You’re just being judgmental.

Real talk, although it might only seem like a light sprinkle, the rain is coming down dense and fast. I’ve found that the rain type we get couple with drive faster than a snail paced speed makes it so I have to use my wipers more than I anticipate.

Also, the rain can be heavy in one area and light in another. Sometimes I’ll have to use a high speed for my wipers then drive into an area where they aren’t need. But because I’m paying more attention to the road than my wipers I forget to turn them down right away."
