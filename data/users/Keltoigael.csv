MonsterHunterWorld,ffisw0f,t3_etqpya,1579981885.0,Your line art and coloring are amazing. You should be doing artwork for studios.
launchbox,ffiqul9,t3_etoa2a,1579980432.0,"Hyperspin and LaunchBox are to vastly different Frontends. LaunchBox is easy to configure, constantly updated and has new features added yearly. Hyperspin has been in a frozen state for years, clunky and a pain to setup even if using RocketLauncher which is just as complicated. What you get is a patched together and stringed mess. If general emulation and the need for a frontend which is easy to handle and to configure you can get by on the free license just fine. If you want more features and access to BigBox then you should get premium. It really is not up to the devs to inform you directly of a price increase, the post is on the forums. McDonald's doesn't email you to tell you your BigMac went up 50 cents."

Sadly he can never prove his accusations. If this has happened twice already you would have thought it would maybe be best to not let the dog roam freely or supervise it better. Again this is awful but I think he could have prevented this.
