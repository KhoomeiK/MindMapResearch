debunking that Bernie said the DNC is rigged claim. And a CNN story of Warren repeating the [claim](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/02/politics/elizabeth-warren-dnc-rigged/index.html).

Sorry for edits, formatting."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,ff9bo4j,t1_ff95e8l,1579709290.0,"Please find those examples. My google search didn’t yield anything on reputable website sources. But what you describe is dirty campaigning, not vitriol. That is every campaign just with a modern flair. And to be fair it took Facebook and others a long time to admit the extent of Russian interference. 

He didn’t make fun or accusations about her person, or behavior outside the political realm, which she is certainly a part of, and plays the game very well. Like when people complain about her voice/looks/personality or accuse her of things that have nothing to do with actual politics, like alleged murders or facilitating a pedophile ring, or blaming her for her husband’s actions. I don’t expect there to be a lack of political attacks, that’s politics. 

One would hope he would source his material better, but I couldn’t find anything on what you posted, and I too don’t really have the time for an exhaustive search. So I’ll just agree to disagree."

bipolar,ff7quyk,t1_ff7qgkj,1579656143.0,Please go to the hospital. You’re sounding increasingly delusional and possibly violent towards the people who probably care about you.
bipolar2,ff7qhsp,t3_es481d,1579655891.0,Eventually that all changes and we get diagnosed. I was right there with you a few months ago after getting diagnosed at 37.

Some prescribers will do almost anything to make sure you take your meds. Insurance being mandatory for care is one of the biggest scams this country has bought into, and we suffer because of it."

Edit to add: downvoting me while politely asking for an example? Why not just back up what you’re saying. I mean, he has criticized her experience because they ran against each other and he certainly has more experience in government, but it wouldn’t qualify as vitriol, just campaigning. She did pretty much the exact same thing. https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/06/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-qualified/index.html"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,ff7kvau,t3_es3ge4,1579651959.0,It was several years and I’d even hear it at yoga! It was the chant of the mid 90’s.

bipolar,ff7e8cz,t1_ff7bm0w,1579647515.0,"You don’t seem to be getting much positive feedback on others approach to drinking, which isn’t super surprising. Lots of comorbidity between mental illness and addiction. My doctors don’t agree with your doctors, and I too trust them, so I don’t mix drinking and medication. But please, keep us updated on your relationship with alcohol. It is good to see another perspective."

This sounds like intrusive thoughts, I get those too. It can get better, and you’re doing what you can. I just want you to know you’re not alone."
bipolar,ff774qo,t1_ff753v4,1579642439.0,I second this. It’s really quick to up the dosage and to see if it could possibly work. It took a couple of months for me to show improvement at 600 mg Er.  It seems to be working now.
bipolar,ff76kzu,t3_es0qfp,1579642127.0,Are you on meds? Seeing a therapist?
bipolar,ff6wql5,t1_ff6nea0,1579636464.0,"Well, that middle section will decrease if you stop drinking completely. That’s a lot of calories even if it’s only two drinks. I’ve never personally seen a bipolar person do well with alcohol, myself included. Just be honest with your doctors if your relationship with alcohol becomes something other than what you describe. If it changes in any way. I do have a friend whose mania was last triggered by alcohol and meds, the really unfun kind that would in other circumstances have lead to hospitalization. So just be aware, it can get bad."
bipolar,ff6lg6t,t3_erxnmu,1579629716.0,"Did you tell them how you used to drink? Because it sounds problematic that you were heavily self medicating and now everyone is cool with your drinking. Or maybe just harm reduction. I think you can always find someone to validate drinking if you try hard enough, but if your doctors say it’s okay (what was that conversation like?) I guess they know best. But if you can’t stick to your two drinks a week, keep them updated. Lots of meds can fuck with your liver. And alcohol definitely does. You might want to go to r/askpsychiatry and see if this is normal for psychiatric professionals to say its okay to drink on your specific med combo. They’ll know better than us if this is going to be okay for you."
bipolar2,ff6kg7z,t3_erxtjz,1579629111.0,"Vraylar gave me all of the side effects and only temporary relief before the hypomania set in. Lithium kind of works for me, but I get the occasional side effects like muscle spasms. I’m on a low dose of 600 mg ER.

bipolar,ff4c2mb,t3_erks6a,1579560098.0,Drink a ton of water and take your vitamins. It can prevent some side effects like muscle spasms. It’s been the best drug I’ve tried so far.
bipolar,ff3ugqn,t3_erh4fr,1579549107.0,"I quit lamictal because it made me weepy! I’m not able to deal with most meds, so it wasn’t a huge surprise. It was definitely not worth continuing to try. And that’s just one med of many. I’m on lithium now. It’s better for me."

bipolar,ff3jsqq,t3_erghua,1579542556.0,I couldn’t stay awake very long past my dosage; day time use sounds like something you’d do during a severe manic episode. When in doubt ask your pharmacist.
bipolar2,ff3ji3v,t3_ergifz,1579542374.0,"Yes, you can say “I think I’d like to try sticking with/dropping certain meds” and you just take that for a long time. (Vraylar is still pretty new so lots of doctors are trying it. It didn’t work for me, too many side effects. )It might take some time to get to that place. First it’s best to not be on a super low or high, then you can reasonably ask to just chill with what you have and see if it’s really working or if you were having medication interactions. I’m literally in this place with my treatment right now. Took a year of med trials (plus all of the previous attempts at meds) and finding a decent psych np."
bipolar2,ff3ij44,t1_ff3i5tq,1579541777.0,Agreed! I prefer people who take responsibility for their behavior.

bipolar2,ff38yhp,t1_ff30aoi,1579536494.0,Not sure where you got it hasn’t happened to me.  But one has a much greater chance of it not happening if one is and acts like an adult. And No is a word you can use as an adult that doesn’t carry any weight as a child. OP is a child and is acting like one.

They were done December 24th and I do a saline spray about 4 times a day, including after I rinse it in the shower for about five minutes after I wash my hair. Frankly, the upper lobes I got done are giving me more trouble because I chose diamond ends and they catch on stuff. I’m wondering if it’s just typical when the first jewelry is something besides a ring, because complaints are frequent on here regarding those who have irritation and barbells of any variety."

This was before plastic piercings were used to keep holes open, we used fishing line back in the day. Not ideal."
bipolar2,ff1vugs,t3_er6eji,1579487333.0,Nope. Meds are a crapshoot.
piercing,ff1brxq,t1_ff1b61x,1579477246.0,I had it for about a year and a half. If you want a short experience you can avoid screwing up your teeth by being careful. But long term I assume it’s inevitable because accidents happen.

Now I can almost eat normal portions, but only one big meal like you describe a day. Keep trying, you can overcome it! Even if you have to eat your big meal after you take your meds in the evening. That really helped me, eating later. And dense caloric snacks. Zofran helped too, in addition to taking my psychiatric meds."

bipolar,fezai19,t1_fez8ipg,1579455357.0,"I did. It took about a week for the worst side effects to go away. A few still linger about a week and a half later. The rash is very slow at going away. But they aren’t permanent, which I was scared was happening when things got bad."
bipolar,fez66ow,t1_feyxyhb,1579454190.0,"My side effects were constant tremors, complete loss of fine motor skills (typing, writing, driving, holding things tightly, etc), a rash, and my hypomania symptoms. Right before I went to the ER I started vomiting as well. That ramped up over the course of two weeks about two weeks into the drug, starting with a mixed episode that turned into the hypomania. The tremors were very slight about two weeks in. Then the other stuff started like four weeks in.  So yeah, right on time. Sorry that’s probably confusing."
