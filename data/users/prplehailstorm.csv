Honestly, it was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. We played car games and listen to music and time just flew by without my thinking about smoking. 

Addiction tells us that smoking is this cool and fun activity and tricks us into thinking life is boring without it. The truth is, it’s not. I can sit through a movie at the theater without getting antsy. I can go out and enjoy what I’m doing without needing to run outside and smoke. I have a ton more money now and I don’t have to pick smoking over having money to do things. I have a lot more fun now that I quit smoking. you just need to push through it and you will realize you’re not giving up this fun awesome thing. Smoking doesn’t bring any value to your life, the addiction just tells you it does. You’re in an annoying stage right now but it gets a shit ton better. 

Just take it one day and one trigger at a time. I’m a year and a half without smoking and I can go weeks without it even crossing my mind that I was ever a smoker at all and I smoked for 8 years. You will get there, just stick with it."
