I would just use this to supplement my regular diet. I would eat normally and get enough protein, then at the end of the day take one of these to get myself up to 3.5k calories."

PlasticSurgery,ff4cnb3,t1_ff48nqo,1579560482.0,"You don't even know if she is a teenager... This girl asked a question and wanted an answer and instead of giving her the answer she asked for you think she should receive emotional support instead. How about you treat her with a little bit of respect, and not like she's some damaged person that you need to help? And apparently based off a single paragraph of text you know for a fact that surgery is not what's best for her.

I don't know what's best for this girl, but I'm also not going to treat her like she's beneath me and needs to be saved. People like you are the reason this girl feels like less than she is.

And attraction is inherently subjective. But there is a rough shared understanding of attraction which is more or less universal."

PlasticSurgery,ff41qci,t1_ff3z8za,1579553641.0,"Yeah, it's ridiculous every single person who posts here is perfect/beautiful and should see a therapist lol.

I'm not a surgeon but I think rhinoplasty would definitely work for you. With your nose shape, a surgeon should definitely be able to thin out the bridge and ""cut down"" your tip.

This is just some random picture I found on google but see what the surgeon was able to do with this girl's bridge & bulbous tip.

While your nose isn't exactly like this I don't see why they couldn't do the same for you.

Although I should say as someone who has gotten a nose job you get this idea of what you want your nose to look like but your best bet is to just find a good surgeon with a feel for aesthetics. Surgeons know how to make noses look better, and if you find a good one you generally won't need to tell him/her anything, he'll just know what you want."
PlasticSurgery,ff3yr16,t1_ff3x3hm,1579551784.0,"If you look through my post history I'm one of the few people on this subreddit who always gives an honest opinion (I've called posters on this subreddit ugly before).  You're a 5-6/10, not ugly by any means. If people really have called you ugly, they were probably just being mean or these pictures don't represent the way you look.

That being said if your looking to improve the way look I think a nose job and maybe something for your chin/jawline, fillers potentially, would do wonders. You really wouldn't need that much to get into that 7+/10 range.

Also in terms of a non-surgical route to improvement. With your face, you could easily be a 7+/10 without surgery if you hit the gym."

You are unattractive, but it's not hopeless you have a lot of potential, it's just not manifested. Style changes, and working out likely won't get you to where to want to be on there own. I think a nosejob alone would do wonders for you, your nose is the centerpiece of your face and making some small changes there can potentially change the entire way you look."
