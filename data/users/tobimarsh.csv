todayilearned,feloh8e,t1_felfeg6,1579227075.0,"Lost a grandparent to Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and we were told ""To reduce the already very low risk of CJD transmission from one person to another, people should never donate blood, tissues, or organs if they have suspected or confirmed CJD, or if they are at increased risk because of a family history of the disease, a dura mater graft, or other factor."" So no you're wrong."

speedrun,fd50kjv,t1_fd3o7wu,1578172973.0,One thing I noticed no one has said I'll add is that the donation messages are pretty annoying for the most part. I get that it certainly results in them getting more/larger donations and changing it would be a stupid decision to stop or severely cut back on the amount read on stream but it's the reason I went from having it on the entire week when home even just for background noise to me tuning it for maybe 1-2 runs I particularly want to see at most a year.
