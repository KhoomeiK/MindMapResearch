technology,ffi0zty,t1_ffh0bnq,1579961799.0,"Ultimately it's a power thing. You can use it to to crush protests by easily finding and arresting protest leaders (like the guy that founded the hong Kong medic group that got arrested recently), you can use it to ""illegally"" surveil your political rivals (laws dont apply to the people that manage them, idk why but that just seems to be the case), there are probably more uses that I just can't think of right now as far as the cameras and microphones everywhere. The DNA can be used for pharma purposes, that sounds like it could be a good thing but realistically it will ultimately just be another way to financially suppress the population by overcharging on pharmaceuticals. Then if you combine DNA and surveillance you can get real holocausty real fast. Using DNA and surveillance to find ""undesirables."" Protesters, medically deficient individuals, homosexuals, racial enemies, religious enemies, etc. Even political enemies."

AskMen,ffc23vm,t1_ffayic8,1579789611.0,"That's probably not realistic for the majority of people. Not because people are purposely insensitive or oversensitive, but because people are highly variable. So I think having the decorum to handle people that may not have the same emotional stability as you is what matters most. Dont get upset when people are insensitive because they may not mean to be, and the same goes for those that are hypersensitive. I think that sense of decorum says more about the person than anything, but you'll never have it 100% refined because like I said, people are variable, they will catch you by surprise. 

Essentially I'm trying to say, sensitivity doesnt matter because it's variable, it's the other party's tact in how they handle the situation that matters."

Other political and theological beliefs aren't as relevant as how programmed you are to do what America needs you to do. I'm not trying to insult you or anything though so i hope you dont take that the wrong way.

As far as the channels to be a whistleblower, I'm sure he had some he could take, I'm just giving some potential points that may have influenced his decision to not take them. I'm not using them to excuse what he did, I just try to keep a level playing field. 

I dont attribute the condition our country is to him, we have a lot of bigger problems than some dude in a basement watching us jerk it to make sure we're not terrorists. That has more to do with 1) how gullible the average person is 2) how ignorant the average person is and 3) how greedy the average person is. Russians interfering with our election has nothing to do with Snowden, our consumerism that has lead to a point of no return started before Snowden was pubescent, and how fucked our current government is has nothing to do with Snowden and everything to do with ignorant leaders. And I think all of the paranoia is more because of the political correctness movement. You can be a white guy wishing a black woman a nice day and somehow be a racist and misogynist (obviously a gross exaggeration to prove a point). The polarization is back to ignorance, being a zealot does no one any good.

Now, I will say he did make people less trusting of their government, but again is that a good thing or bad thing? If you ask the government? Then it's bad. But if you could go back and ask our founding fathers, or russia it would be a good thing. I think distrusting your government is probably a smart thing. Unless you're a soldier, then your job isn't to trust, or to doubt, just to do."

See you either are, or were, a member of the government, so obviously you would lean more heavily towards him being a traitor that destabilizes. You're not wrong with your point of view. This is just an example of why there is more than one supreme court justice. It all depends on interpretation. And yeah, Snowden didnt go through the correct channels, but as just a contractor he may or may not have known, or had available to him, the opportunity to legally be a whistleblower. I'm not a government worker, so I dont view him as a traitor, nor do view him as a revolutionary. A spy is more appropriate sure, but he wasnt spying for an enemy. Unless you're calling your countrymen your enemy. I think Snowden was an idiot. He merely confirmed what most Americans believed, and what you'd have to be daft to not believe. In exchange for mere confirmation he ruined his life as an american citizen."
worldnews,fed690s,t1_fed4ifx,1579000903.0,"You know what amuses me about your entire argument? The origin. It started with talking about Snowden being a traitor or a revolutionary, and yet it has devolved into him breaking the law which was never really a question. A traitor and a revolutionary are both essentially illegal things to be (some exceptions but I wont get into all of those). Snowdens choice to go to Russia was logical if he valued his own life. Discussing the legality of moving to russia after obtaining his security clearances and all of the sensitive knowledge he has is kind of irrelevant when the other option is really bad times in prison, possibly getting epsteined. Again though, this is all off topic, the original point was is Snowden a revolutionary or a traitor? The legality was never up for debate. He broke the law, but does being a traitor to the government mean he should be branded a traitor to the people. Ultimately depends on the narrative you're trying to spin. Do you want people to keep whistleblowing in efforts to make citizens more informed, and potentially make their lives better, or do you want to be able to acquire information from everyone with zero resistance so you can better control your citizens? If yes to the first one then you'll call him a revolutionary, if yes to the second one then hes a traitor."

GetMotivated,fcph3uj,t1_fco9uz7,1577863770.0,"Start off by acknowledging that you dont require a will to live. You dont have to be determined. You dont have to put one step in front of the other. There's nothing you have to do. There is nothing wrong with stopping and taking a look around. What do you hate about your life, what do you dislike, what is just an inconvenience? What items of those categories is reasonable to resolve? Hate your job? Reasonable. Dislike the condition your body is in? Reasonable. Inconvenienced by the crippling loneliness of being single or in a one sided relationship? Reasonable. You dont need the will to live for any of that. A simple plan and a bunch of fuck-it resolves most of that.

Just sit still for a second. Stop wallowing in what you wish your life was like, acknowledge it for what it is. Everyone's so caught up in what tomorrow brings. Idk. Theres a whole lot I can say, but someone determined to wallow in self pity can always blow my statements away as a guideline that doesnt fit everything. You dont need to be determined to live better, you just need to not be determined to keep living a shitty life."

So. tEcHnIcAlLy its science fiction. X-Men is technically sci-fi. It's what would happen if the human genome had that ability to mutate and grant super powers."

Ive only seen people in China ignoring each other because -if I recall correctly- something involving being held liable, possibly bullshit but I admittedly didnt put any effort into finding out if it was true. But I try to think through issues like that because blind judgement, and blind nationalism only benefits others. Sometimes I'll slip and use sweeping generalizations when I normally dont mean to. Boy does that misunderstanding get people angry lol"
worldnews,fcn1gbw,t1_fclghro,1577800523.0,"Yeah, just looking around ones home you can see that it's only the loud obnoxious people that get attention, which is why I said I know theres a lot of good ones out there, I'm just not exposed to them. So everytime I hear about more fucked up shit chinese people do it's the knee jerk reaction to say ""fuck chinese people"" and with how often I hear it that reaction is taking longer for me to set aside and look at reality. I'd love to hear some positive stories about mainlanders."

Then the whole hunting endangered animals for medieval boner pills. I feel bad cause they have a massive population so I'm sure a bunch of them are decent people, but I'm just less able to give them the benefit of the doubt. They treat each other like shit to it's ridiculous."
