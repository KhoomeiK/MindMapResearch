I don't know if someone who sees things as very black and white is going to want to be a friend after you break up with him.  But I also suspect that that quality will make someone an inflexible partner and also someone unlikely to take a job form income rather than wait for the perfect one to come along."

She's just odd and ""off"" and whatever she is looking for it's not specifically a movie partner.  You ARE looking for a movie partner and it's fine to say ""I'm sorry things didn't work out.  I was looking pretty specifically for someone to go see a movie.  I hope you find what you're looking for"".  And then you move on.

It won't hurt you to be cautious and it won't hurt either of you if you go see your movie on your own and don't take her up on an offer for dinner."

You could use them on a spinach salad.  They sound like they might be good over rice.

And my stepmother likes to hollow zucchini and fill with sausage and roast.  Serve that with a little light tomato sauce.

Maybe as a roulade in a flattened chicken breast with mushrooms.   Or in a pasta bake.  Heck share them with anyone else you know that eats meat."

TwoXChromosomes,ffg3tju,t3_etfw2l,1579897856.0,"So you were naive and trusting and took the word of your neighbor as a valid reference which in many cases it would be.

You also read the positive reviews online and had a friend standing by.

None of this suggests you're stupid, you just haven't experienced anything like this before.  Now you know and you won't do it again.

I'd also try and figure out what can be done so other women don't wind up in a similar situation with this guy.  At the very least tell your experience on the review site."
TwoXChromosomes,ffg2ulo,t1_ffegqe9,1579897258.0,"You certainly could ask those women too.  But when you said ""decided not to"" that is also a choice they had the right to make.

Which is different from being forced/coerced into to having or not having an abortion by others.  

A woman who makes an active decision of her own free will will probably regret either decision much less than someone who is not actually given a choice."

This is what I think; he is not handing his own emotional life well.  He doesn't want to have to handle anyone else's issues too.  He also wants to maybe date others, he isn't really ready to date others, he wants certain things about you and maybe doesn't want to be alone, he doesn't want other things about you.

Frankly I think this kind of situation calls for YOU having an orgasm before he even starts on his.

Where you take it is ten steps back and in a different direction.  Crush or not this person doesn't want to be your friend."

But you're basing this on a total lack of information so you may be trying to dose your relationship with something that could instead send it into a coma from which it will never return.

TwoXChromosomes,ffcz39z,t3_est4es,1579810226.0,"You're mixing up several things

Being broke, being frugal and being stingy with others.

Someone broke doesn't have two pennies but if they did they might share one with people they care about.

Someone frugal may have suffered hardship and so their fear makes them cautious with money since they don't want to starve or their family to starve.

Someone stingy with others has neither of those issues but clearly shows that they spend money on what they value and you may not be one of the things they value.

I'm pretty sure you broke as you are wouldn't buy a sandwich and sit eating it in front of your date without offering any (I know I wouldn't).  But there are people who would.  And sometimes that shows you how they will treat you in general.

So while I find gold diggers awful and wouldn't want to hang out with them I'd also have issues with someone who lets you know they own three homes but wouldn't ever consider treating a date or a friend to a cup of coffee.  They are letting you know what their priority is and it's not you."

So ask yourself this, what if your husband is yelling over you because he actually does not want to hear you?   What if there is a part of him that wants to shut down any conversation about your needs because he doesn't want you to have needs?  What he is doing is very effectively derailing any conversation you want to have that says ""I need something"".  

The counselor actually said your husband was ""ignoring the 80% of what was going on that didn’t support his behaviors/statements"".  How better to do that then shout down and derail a conversation that doesn't support his behaviors, statements and personal desires?

I don't know what made him that way but you can't fix him.  Maybe if he chose to change for his own reasons he could do that but it doesn't sound like he wants to.

So the situation is basically is that he does whatever he wants to do and you are along for the ride.  Can you live with that?  Do you want to live with that?"

TwoXChromosomes,ffcz39z,t3_est4es,1579810226.0,"You're mixing up several things

Being broke, being frugal and being stingy with others.

Someone broke doesn't have two pennies but if they did they might share one with people they care about.

Someone frugal may have suffered hardship and so their fear makes them cautious with money since they don't want to starve or their family to starve.

Someone stingy with others has neither of those issues but clearly shows that they spend money on what they value and you may not be one of the things they value.

I'm pretty sure you broke as you are wouldn't buy a sandwich and sit eating it in front of your date without offering any (I know I wouldn't).  But there are people who would.  And sometimes that shows you how they will treat you in general.

So while I find gold diggers awful and wouldn't want to hang out with them I'd also have issues with someone who lets you know they own three homes but wouldn't ever consider treating a date or a friend to a cup of coffee.  They are letting you know what their priority is and it's not you."

So ask yourself this, what if your husband is yelling over you because he actually does not want to hear you?   What if there is a part of him that wants to shut down any conversation about your needs because he doesn't want you to have needs?  What he is doing is very effectively derailing any conversation you want to have that says ""I need something"".  

The counselor actually said your husband was ""ignoring the 80% of what was going on that didnâ€™t support his behaviors/statements"".  How better to do that then shout down and derail a conversation that doesn't support his behaviors, statements and personal desires?

I don't know what made him that way but you can't fix him.  Maybe if he chose to change for his own reasons he could do that but it doesn't sound like he wants to.

The polite thing for a guy to do is hide that from you really hard so he can have his thoughts and you're not bothered by them.  It sounds like your boyfriend has tried to do that. 

Him masturbating to whatever he masturbated to has nothing to do with his feelings for you.

As for the flirting, that's worse though from how it sounds it's in the past and he didn't pursue it further than flirting.

What I'm getting from your post is that both of you may have met a little young and while he does care about you he also is trying to ""have"" other women in tiny bits and pieces that won't damage your relationship.

If you're feeling really freaked out and mistrustful it didn't work out that way.  So what you need to ask yourself is if you want to boot him out to go and get his life experiences or if you want to stay with him and see if there is a way of creating more trust between the two of you. 

As for the not ""finishing"" (orgasm?). Some guys really feel inadequate when they can't make a woman come.  It's an ego thing.  If he's willing then teach him how and make him do what you need no matter how long it takes.  He may be grateful for that.  Try and see."
