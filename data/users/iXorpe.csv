PlayStationPlus,fdrgmsn,t1_fdr0p0h,1578684221.0,Ok but if thats the case why did I try before and it was locked when I downloaded it? I’m pretty certain that I had PS Plus on the other account then too. I find it kinda strange tbh

They’re so good at intentionally wasting time using their voice, that sometimes, I don’t even notice!

bjj,fdbmhev,t1_fd8unqh,1578258789.0,"You’re right to think that I haven’t really trained. I’ve literally done one lesson and some rolling with some random untrained people in my own time or whatever. YouTube black belt. Honestly though I sort of want to kind of understand a formula to jiu jitsu if you know what I mean. I don’t want to be learning moves without knowing why stuff works.

I do plan on starting training sometime in the future but I actually believe that if I do go in with some sort of idea of fundamental concepts and some understanding of physics and how shit works then it’ll make me learn a lot faster. I want it to be so that when I’m getting a technique explained to me, I know the concepts and I know what’s required to achieve xyz so I can be in a place where I can guess the next step in a move without having ever seen it. Maybe it’s stupid of me but even if it doesn’t help me in BJJ at least it’s knowledge ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"

Like are you using the quickmenu which you get by holding down the PS Button? Also did you know that if you double tap the PS button it’ll quickly take you to the screen you were previously on so if you want you can keep switching back and forth to trophies or friends or whatever else you’d like"

I could have swooooorn that id heard people use it as an insult here in the UK because before I’d found the meaning out I was so sure that it was a word used to insult people.
