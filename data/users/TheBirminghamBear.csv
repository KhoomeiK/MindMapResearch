A big part of the problem is that the public doesn't understand how science works, but also that science doesn't understand how the public works.

The public wants cold, hard, binary realities.  ""This product is good.""  ""This stuff is bad."" 

Science knows it never works like that.  People's wildly different biochemistry, coupled with contextual information and cross-reactions, means it's *impossible* to say ""X works"" and ""Y doesn't.""

On top of that, it's also hard to argue that our scientific infrastucture hasn't let us down.  in the US, the FDA along with pharma companies have not been operating in the people's interest in a long time.  LIfe-saving meds are not pursued for reasons of profitability and market viability, and people see that. 

So while people's behavior is frustrating, science also has a responsibility to be communicative, less insular, and we need our government and our public institutions to be more transparent and public facing."

TheExpanse,ffo7x09,t1_ffnwuxw,1580074981.0,"No; Holden was raised by eight parents (four couples, one couple being two gay men) who combined their genes due to reproduction restrictions on earth so that one child (Holden) could be 1/8th parts each parent.

One mother, the one in the show, was the mother that carried him to term after being implanted with IVF fertilized egg, and she always feels especially attached to Holden because of this. 

These families were *not* Poly.  They're monogomous; they had Holden due to legal restrictions and because combined, they had a large chunk of farm land that they needed one heir to bequeath their property to, or else risk it being gobbled up by corporation or the government, and not all four families could each have their own child because of Earth's overpopulation.

So this was represented accurately in the show.  There are later seasons where he talks to his family on vid and even goes to visit them.  There are also other comments made that, while rare, this is not unheard of and there are other collections of families on Earth that have done similar arrangements for similar reasons.

In contrast, Pa's family is a collection of men and women, all of whom are married to one another and who sleep with one another polyamorously and who think of themselves as a single family unit that will occasionally bring in other men and women to the fold.

politics,ffnvzk7,t3_eucjsq,1580071487.0,"Also, it fucking isn't.  It just isn't.  This is not a stance a person can take; it's a fact.  

It's the *very fundamental reason* why impeachment is not a criminal trial.  Because sometimes people are elected to a job they can't do.  Not because they commit crime, but because they're an idiot.  Or compromised.  Or a narcissistic asshole. 

Imagine if you're a pilot who just can't fly.  You're just shit at it and if you keep doing it a lot of people are going to die.  Does the airline have to wait until you, for unrelated reasons, rob a fucking bank before they can get rid of you? 

Of course not.  All they need is the evidence of you being shit at flying a plane, for them to say, ""Jeff, get the fuck out of the plane.  You're a shit pilot and you're fired.""

It confounds reason why someone would believe we'd have to wait until the President was a criminal to impeach him for being a fucking idiot.

Now, Trump *is* a criminal, and he ought to be impeached for reasons both due to his criminality *and* his egregious incompetence, so it's really a moot point anyway, but, this isn't a fucking debate. 

Impeachment is a process to get rid of someone not fit for the job.  It was tailor-made for Donald Trump.  He rode a wave of populism to get to a position so far beyond his competency and skill set that it is a tragedy that 60 million people cannot comprehend this fact."

In reality, winning an election is the *beginning* of a President's very long and high-stakes job of actually running the country.  A President *should* be under constant scrutiny and *should* face harsh penalties for egregious abuses of power that result in a lack of safety for Americans.  

But what white males love most of all is being entitled to the best things in life without needing to actually earn any of it.  And once they have it, pretending as though they obtained it with hard work and intelligence alone.

IWantToLearn,ffi7wam,t3_etq45g,1579967396.0,"The first thing I will note is that there is a fundamental problem with the story you're telling about yourself.  If you *enjoy* your work and achieving success, you are *enjoying life*.  There's no template for exactly how a person should enjoy life.  Some people are satisfied with whatever work gets them by and a large social circle and rich family life.  Others are more happy throwing themselves into their work and have a much smaller circle of people around them. 

There is no *right* or *wrong* way to enjoy life.  So dispel yourself of that notion.  People inflict endless pain on themselves by believing that there's something wrong with them for living life differently than most people do, and believing that makes them wrong or bad, despite them enjoying their life, and trying to cram themselves into a template that they do not fit inside.

But, if you feel like you're missing out, or you feel you want to expand your world, good!  This is a fine and noble goal.  And something the brain is well-adapted to do.

The secret to enjoying something is not that mysterious.  As numerous studies have shown, passion and genius are much less innate than they are *learned*. 

I want to take one thing in particular that you've said and really break it down, because I don't think you're fully aware of what's happening here:

>I am not able just to sit down on Friday evening and enjoy a conversation, company of people, a glass of tasty wine or some slow walk in the park. Not any more.

Now, here's what I'm guessing *actually* happens.  You come off a week of work, head spinning and buzzing with ideas and To-Dos, etc., and briefly dip your toe in a social outing before becoming impatient, and then bowing out and telling yourself you ""can't enjoy this"", and go back to letting your work dominate your attention and brainspace. 

But of *course* you can't enjoy it.  For one, did you actually give it your full attention?  Did you actually try, or did you just abandon the entire effort the moment you felt uncomfortable?  Were you *present* in that moment, or did you make the *effort* to be present, or did you merely ruminate and wallow at how unpleasant the moment was, before giving up? 

For everything in life, there is a discomfort barrier.  A space of time in which the brain is bored and uncomfortable with a situation or action.  The key to enjoying something, *anything*, is to *challenge* this barrier and *push through it*.  Sometimes that requires many sessions of focus and attention and conscious effort.  Most people never do this. 

Take the student who believes they're ""bad at math"".  Typically, for one reason or another, they have a bad experience with math, and then internalize that as part of their identity.  From there forward, whenever they encounter math, they feel that this discomfort is inevitable because of course it is, they aren't ""math people."" 

But this is bullshit.  A lie.  The brain is a nearly infinitely plastic organ.  True, some people are naturally better at one thing or another, but nearly *anyone* can become *anything* they want to be with the proper intent, focus, practice and repetition. 

It may sound paradoxical, that you need to practice having fun, but it's more than that.  People have *fun* by *paying attention to the fine details of something*.  An average person goes to wine tasting and just tastes... wine.  But a professional wine taster explores the many subtle flavors, scents, tastes, and all the nuance therein.  In those details comes the pleasure, the expansive inner world.  But you don't get there without practice, repetition, immersion, and attention. 

If you want to enjoy a walk in the park, a conversation with a friend, you need to pay attention to these things.  *Really* pay attention.  Slip into the flow that you find yourself in when you're pursuing a goal or something else you enjoy.  That will require discomfort, initially.  Your brain will recoil and reject this, because it has been trained to orient itself toward your other goals.  You must be patient, but firm.  

And most importantly, you need to realize there's no such thing as being ""a type of person.""  People are products of their environments.  You have lived in an environment of goals and work; and so you have come to enjoy and thrive there.  If you are to thrive in a new environment, you must understand that it will take time and discomfort to adapt, but you *will* adapt, because it is what the brain does."

IWantToLearn,ffgoksv,t1_fff77ir,1579911119.0,"Yep!  This, OP.  If you listen to nothing else, this.  

No one cares what you *say*, and that's why they don't care what the presentation is *on.*  What matters to people is what you make them *feel*, and that's a lot more than the content of your words.

So, a few helpful tips: if you're using PowerPoint, *POWERPOINT IS NOT A NOTE TOOL ITS A PRESENTATION AID TOOL*.  Keep slides brief, colorful (dark background and light font works best), and use it only to punctuate what YOU are saying.

Choose something you're passionate about.  If you have freedom to choose, make it something you really like.  The sort of thing you could talk about for hours with someone in a private room.  The sort of thing that sets your mind racing when you start thinking about it.  Bring that passion in; it is invaluable. 

Be *dynamic*.  Have you ever looked at plotline of a narrative?  It goes up and down - highs and lows.  That keeps people intrigued.  Use humor, but sparingly.  Be dramatic - make profound points, but also, sparingly.  Build up to each.  Structure your presentation.  You have a timeframe - map it out, minute by minute.  Seriously, map it out. 

People hate facts and love stories.  A presentation is *always* a story, even when people think it isn't.  Be a storyteller.  Have a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Having rising action, have a climax.  Human beings instinctually gravitate towards this structure.  That's why its successful.  Stories are how we define ourselves, and so, they're how we relate to others, too. 

*Use your body*.  A great deal of what we communicate is done non-verbally.  You don't want to run around the stage like a madman, but pace a little.  When you're making a point, *lean in* to the audience, just a little.  Punctuate words with hand gestures.  Use your body to tell the story.

*Use your voice*.  The kiss of death in a presentation is monotone.  Speak softly when building drama, speak loudly and dynamically when building climax.

This is actually a pretty classic test - sometimes people will give people intentionally boring topics or open-ended presentation topics, and have them present on it.  The point of it is to see whether a person has the skill to *create* interest and narrative around *anything*, regardless of what it is."

HumansBeingBros,ffedm4y,t1_ffecebj,1579844135.0,"This is why religious arguments about the creation myth and gods image and all that shit are so silly.

Humans, like everything else, are designed specifically as sacks of meat equipped with either incubators or DNA pistols and are designed to live only long enough to successfully use those objects before shriveling up and having the courtesy to die and leave nutrients for the next batch of meat sacks. 

We *could* have been built to endure centuries.  Or even see near-biological immortality.  That's certainly within the realm of possibility even in the biological world, for a deity.  We *could* be durable, self-contained angelic figures that don't die because a mean little sack of digestive enzymes pops like a balloon and eats us from the inside out.  Or any of the myriad horrific and undignified diseases that predate upon the old.

But we *weren't* made that way.  Because we weren't made.  Because like everything else in existence, we're sacks of protein affixed with organs that help us orient towards nutrients and potential mates.  Created in the forge of countless iterations of gradual change imposed in the pressure cooker of environment.
 
Consciousness is merely an accidental emergent property of competitively advantageous intelligence.  Smarter meat sacks use better tools and grow bigger, better-fed, and more dangerous tribes of meat sacks, therefore giving rise to even more intelligent meat sacks.

Then we started to write shit down and utilize external memory, and wham, suddenly, civilization.  We weren't *meant* to realize we exist because we aren't *meant* to do anything, except make more meat sacks.  That's why our hyperintelligent brains have a big giant firewall between the conscious parts of the brain, and the entire rest of the brain doing all the orienting-us-towards-potential-mates shit while distracting us with shiny objects and dopamine.

But we're still meat sacks with incubators and DNA pistols.  The only meaning is the meaning we create.  The only *external* meaning that reality holds is that we are meat sacks.  There's no bearded gentleman in the sky orchestrating wonderful, rich and profound lives for us.  Just meat.  Meat that is desperately driving you forward towards shooting your seed or fertilizing your egg, while it battles every day against the neverending hordes of bacteria and viruses and treacherous betrayals of its own biology until it can't battle anymore and drops dead.

And despite our vast collective intellect, we still make *most* of our decisions based on the primitive whims of the limbic system, which drives us towards those most primitive of goals.  Most human beings on the planet fall for the brain's simplest and most elegant trick of concealing it's own existence from itself, to better assist the meat sack in fulfilling its primary objective without getting distracted by all those pesky nagging sensations like existential horror and the paradoxical nature of questioning one's own existence.

EDIT:  And I should also add, since this thread is about respect to Dr Szarewski, that *this* is the reason why scientists are one of mankind's most tragically underappreciated heroes. 

Think about Alzheimers.  In reality, a logical consequence of a chemo-electric data storange and processing system.  Strip the wires, degrade the signal, lose processing power and lose data.  Biologically, this is a normal and predictable risk. 

But in the context of God, in the context of sentience?  You could probably rationalize a lot of diseases in the context of God, but what sort of fucked up creator is going to design a species with a disease that slowly strips someone of their *identity* right in front of their loved ones?  We *are* the story of our lives, and that makes degenerative brain diseases one of the most horrific and undignified diseases we have.  What sort of God is going to base his entire system of judgment on the measure of a person's faith, and then chuck in a few grenades that will literally rob a person of that specific capacity a decade before claiming their life? 

But, while the rest of the world is out starting wars and arguing over who has the best Bearded Sky Man, people like Dr Szarewski work, almost *always* underpaid and underappreciated, to *actually eradicate diseases like this from existence*.

They will never get as much fame, money or appreciation as the con men and war criminals we choose to deify, and their work will always be tragically misunderstood by most of the people it helps save, but they keep doing it.  

That's the real triumph.  Scientists are meat sacks that somehow manage to overcome horrors of sentience to dedicate their lives to forever enhancing and bettering their entire species, and it is only through their work that we've made it this far, despite humankind's constant efforts to kill itself off."

How, in *what possible way*, is the average person's life *better*?  It's absolutely preposterous to assert anyone's life is better. 

We're on the verge of a new middle east war that doesn't need to happen.  The Department of Education is breaking the law to deny loan relief to countless students.  Consumer protections have been ripped back.  The entire island of PUerto Rico - *American Citizens* - have been denied aid for *years*.  We're paying thousands more per year in this idiot's pointless tariffs.  Farmers are being devastated.  California and Australia are on fire as America abdicates any duty to rein in climate change.

So, once again, the only way the ""average joe"" believes life is better now is if they're mainlining conservative propaganda."

No they don't.  Not by any measure possible.  The world is on fire, tariffs are costing the average American an extraordinary amount of money, international relationships are desperately low, voter restriction is escalating, foreign powers have unprecedented access into our national infrastructures, and the list goes on. 

You are exemplifying precisely the sort of profoundly ignorant and myopic Trump voter I'm talking about if you just walk out your front door and say, ""welp, this looks about the same as it did four years ago,"" and consider that ""swimmingly"" merely because you can't comprehend the stakes or fathom threats beyond two feet in front of your eyes."

It's all fake.  The average Trump voter has absolutely no capacity to understand what's being robbed from him by this administration.  His life has remained static, and he's interpreting that as the economy ""booming."""
GetMotivated,feukfse,t1_fetstfn,1579387351.0,"Of course college is not the universal answer. The calculus isn't about sacrificing to go to college for college's sake; it's about making use of your time and working toward something valuable.  About not prioritizing leisure now over leisure + accomplishments later in life. 

That sacrifice may very well be going to work a trade while your peers go off to college and wrack up debt while being uncertain about what they'll do with their lives, working hard labor in your early twenties to master a valuable skill that can feed you and your family for the rest of your life.

If you don't want to spend 6 years in Medical school because you're going to follow your passion photographing wild animals in Africa, that's awesome. 

But if you don't want to do it because it sounds like a lot of work and you want to just hang around and work an unfulfilling job, people need to understand they will probably come to regret that choice when they get to that age anyway, and have much less to show for it than if they put in the work.

Time is the most precious of all resources.  It's the only truly finite resource.  Money can always be made, stuff can always be rebought.  But time goes one way, always, never returns to us, never comes back.

Meanwhile, the President of the United States hired goons and thugs to stalk and consider *assassinating* a US Ambassador to personally benefit him and his lifelong struggle with following the law, and all because Trump is continually attempting to get foreign countries to hijack our election systems in exactly the same way they did in 2016 when he won despite a crippling loss of the popular vote.

This is *historically* corrupt. What we're witnessing is a historically rare event.  A betrayal and treason of truly proposterous magnitudes that will be the center of study and research and contemplation for centuries to come.

Do you know why world news journals cover the fire in Australia, and not the shit I took this morning?  Because the former is of massive and grave consequence to the world, and the other is shit. 

But our media is no longer intelligently filtering content based on true import.  Instead, they're slaving themselves to clicks and profit.  High school gossip enrages and intrigues, and so they continue to ignore literal treason by our highest executives in favor of utter bullshit. 

Journalism and news isn't supposed to be ""just a job"".  It's not supposed to be something people do to rake in the profit.  It's an essential component of our society.  Without accurate and fair reporting, society will degenerate in exactly the manner we're watching it do so.
