RingFitAdventure,ff8fwgu,t1_ff6zts7,1579676703.0,"I hyper extend too! I started using actual knee supports or KT tape when I know I'm going to be walking a ton when going outside.  I just started the game and haven't needed them yet, but I'm sure I'll be wearing them soon.

Knee braces you can buy on Amazon work well but sometimes the velcro can get itchy when you sweat. The KT Tape is good, but it is 1 time use and you need to really apply it well for it to work. Wearing the knee braces have helped me get through a lot long amusement park lines, retail jobs, and walking around conventions. If you wanna just try, but not invest a bunch, it you could look at getting an ace bandage and knee support wrapping techniques."
