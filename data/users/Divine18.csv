Even then it happens that USCIS may send you a letter that you didn’t hand in X (even though you did - happened to us. We were able to hand all of it in at a local branch and the guy receiving it checked off a list - but then it’s easier and quicker to hand it in again vs fighting them)"

namenerds,ff6tz3m,t3_eryih7,1579634835.0,"I can somewhat relate. While we’re not an interracial couple, I’m german and my husband is american. I took his last name not really thinking because, well I wanted to share my husbands last name. But I’m not happy. 

I had a very german last name it included an umlaut (“Ü”). My first name is nearly impossible for any English speaker to pronounce correctly. My husband still doesn’t after 8 years. Granted he’s gotten very close and carefully tries to every day. But he also never learned german. 

Growing up I didn’t like my name much, because it was short, boring and very traditional. I always wanted a different one. But eventually got over this. 

So now I’m living in America, my first name is pronounced the English way everyday, my last name is English/British and it feels a little like I’ve lost my connection to home. I don’t bother correcting people on how to pronounce my first name because it’s completely different from what an English speaker expects when seeing the letters. I act like it doesn’t bother me. But I just want my name to be pronounced correctly. Without having to go through a 20 minute discussion how “no I’m not american, I may be white enough to scare a ghost, but I’m german. My name is pronounced like this. Oh why did I move here? Yeah, yeah it’s been an adventure. No I don’t plan to stay here forever.” /sigh"

I’m not dressing like visual Kei anymore but now I’m just a jeans and wide tshirt girl. The only reason my hair is long is because I color it crazy colors but never really do much other than a pony tail or leaving it open. 

My 4.5 year old is a total princess. Dresses, skirts, wants to try make up and nail polish. She started dancing at 3 and loves her stage make up and outfits and now she also wants to do cheerleading. If she can’t wear a dress or AT LEAST a skirt, because we live where the air hurts your face, I have a tantrum in the mornings. The compromise is fleece lined leggings under the skirt/dress and stuff the dress in your snow pants. If it’s not pink or glittery or gold or poofy she’s not interested. Like I said. Total princess. Oh and the most fun quirk about her? 

She adores Halloween and everything creepy. The creepier the book/tv show the better. She painted a skeleton spider glitter pink. Her favorite TV show is the curious creations of Christine McConnell on Netflix. 

I love my quirky princess lol. I can’t stop giggling  when she looks all sweet and preppy and starts talking about how bugs help decompose a human body to random people. Or how to make black widow looking chocolates (watch the tv show I mentioned. She’ll show you how)

It takes a while to learn that people, who we see as “elders/grown adults”, whom we were taught to respect, can intentionally try to hurt you because they still see you as inferior/a child. It’s a shock, especially if you’ve grown up with respectful adults. 

You stayed respectful. You showed more class in your pinkie than she has in her whole body.

babyloss,feiv5o6,t3_ep2lxv,1579148065.0,"I’m so sorry. We lost our daughter at 23 weeks and made the choice to cremate her. 

We had a small memorial service on base (dh was military at the time and the little chapel was a beautiful Spanish/missionary style chapel and they were so compassionate and happy to help). 

We didn’t do much. We had a photo of her, taken by the NILMDTS photographer (who we invited), framed by 2 bouquets of our favorite colors (one saying beloved sister and one beloved daughter). By the altar.  

The chaplain met with us and we talked about what was important for us. He was very understanding with me, I was unreasonably scared of having a sermon about how “this is a good thing because she didn’t suffer now”. Instead he talked about a parents love. 

We also had sent him links to music we wanted included, since none of us wanted to have to sing. And we felt those were more fitting. I’ll check my emails and I can edit the post for the list of songs. But beware they are emotionally raw and specifically about the loss of a child. 

Because we were military we were torn on even doing something since it was just us and our 20 month old daughter. Closest family was 18 hours away. Yet my mom and grandma made the flight and came to be there. But the chaplain apparently sent out the info and everyone from DH’s squadron, who wanted to go, got time off.

Edit to add songs:

Selah - I will carry you

Gerrit Hofsink - Still

Lily Alan - something’s not right

Rufus Wainright - Hallelujah (technically not a song about child loss but we both liked it)"
babyloss,feitouo,t3_epbv0a,1579146939.0,"I’m sorry for your loss. 

I lost my little girl January 2017, we just celebrated her third birthday. 

I promise you, you will get through this. I promise, you will never forget your baby. I promise, you can find ways to keep his memory alive and if you have kids in the future, tell them about their older brother. Tell them their angel brother watches over them and keeps them safe. 

I know the world feels cruel, unfair and uncaring. It didn’t stop and wait for you to heal the baby sized hole in your heart. 

I can tell you, grief is hard. It’s a bitch, if I’m being honest. One steps forward and 3 steps back. There is NO guideline how to grief. You don’t have to be done crying by 3 weeks. You don’t have to be done doing shit at any point. The only thing you have to do is put one foot in front of the other. No matter how slowly. 

Even then, if you’re feeling better, you will see/touch/hear or smell something and it comes crashing back. I highly recommend you read this comment on grief.

And my favorite quote about grief. It helps me feel like my grief is ok 

>Grief, I’ve learned, is really just love. It’s all the love you want to give, but cannot. All that unspent love gathers up in the corners of your eyes, the lump in your throat, and in that hollow part of your chest. Grief is just love with no place to go. -Jamie Anderson"

Like others said, you’re perfectly reasonable and any sane/respectful grandparent should be able to understand the situation and have no issues with it. 

Now for us it’s always been tricky. My family stays over at our place generally and my in laws are banned from staying over. The simple reason is, my family can behave itself and be considerate houseguests. My in laws can not. I’m simply the incubator for the grand baby, and to clean and cook for them. 

My point is, even if you had the space, you are in no way obligated to host anyone. Don’t be afraid to hurt anyone’s feelings. Their feelings are not your responsibility. 

However. Please, strongly consider not having overnight guests that close after delivery, no matter how considerate they are. Let them get a hotel.

The only thing wraps are amazing for is when you’re like a bajillion weeks pregnant, everything hurts and you can wrap them around your hips and under the belly to support the weight of the belly and counteract the pain when your pelvis starts getting loose.

I’ve done the same self finding gig. It was my best decision after two messy relationships. I learned a lot about myself, what I want and where I want to be. And I had fun. I went out with friends. Got my grades in uni up. Made it a point to life my best life because the two assholes I dated before made me feel like I’m less than. And were ticked off they had to pay movie tickets for dates, if they wanted to see a movie and I clearly told them I’m a broke college student. I’d love to go but I can’t pay. (FYI I didn’t date them at the same time. Just seemed to pick the same asshole type twice in a row) 

That was years ago. Now Im happily married to an amazing guy for almost 7 years. It just happened. I wasn’t out looking for someone. But we met. Talked, clicked and it just naturally developed into a relationship. We’ve been through hell and back and there’s no one I’d have rather had by my side. 

So go out, life your best life so everyone who doubted you gets green of envy. The best way to have some “revenge” on them is to be happy and not care about them.

YouShouldKnow,fdjczyt,t1_fdjcb42,1578465786.0,"I believe they are. The thing about oil diffusers is that they do just that. Diffuse the oil into the air so they can breath it in. 

Wax melts from my understanding are ok since it’s just the smell and not the actual oil. Even then I keep away from the big no no scents like peppermint and lavender. However if you have a spot they keep peeing in, spray some vinegar on there followed by orange. They absolutely hate that. (And is they’re assholes like mine, find a different spot to protest pee on - however they won’t pee in that first spot anymore lol)"
YouShouldKnow,fdjcr7x,t1_fdj8yhb,1578465530.0,"It depends. If you’re diffusing the oil you release tiny particles into the air that can cause breathing problems. Peppermint is a huge no no in that regard 

Lavender is so bad for cats, if you were to use it in a cleaned, simply them walking over it they absorb it through their paws and it’s bad. I’m not so sure on the diffusing part though. 

There’s a website with pet poison hotline or something that lists it all"

If they have any trouble with the hospital they should get in touch with patient advocates. It’s hard to stand up for yourself when this happens, but it’ll help either change policies in the future. Or if it was miscommunication it’ll hopefully lead to the hospital learning to communicate better."

Or when he deployed they were pissy that they weren’t entitled to any information about him. Or that the few hours he got to skype, he spent with me. His wife. 

Now I see them and my SIL post all these fucking tactless memes about ww3 (dead soldier caskets etc it makes my blood boil - those are actual people who died, not memes!!!) and whatnot. How they’d gladly sacrifice american life’s and all that bullshit. 

And I’m sitting home, worried sick that they’ll call him back into service because he’s in the inactive reserves. Even though he has a 100% disability rating. Thankfully we cut contact with them.

You can use a brush to brush it on. It’s also often used to top sand cakes. It’ll run down a little because it takes a while to dry fully. But it’s super yummy. 

My mom would make a vanilla sand cake for our birthdays, add the lemon icing and then let us just dump sprinkles on there. You couldn’t find a more traditional german birthday cake. 

FYI cakes in Germany usually don’t have buttercream layers at all. They’re dry and either coated with couverture chocolate or this icing."

When we were talking about who gets to be in the room for any, at that point still HYPOTHETICAL, children! I thought her still yo be a reasonable and normal person at the time (we had just been married a couple months and it was my second time meeting her in person because we lived in Germany at the time and they in the US). 

Well she got silent, grabbed her purse (including the only cars car keys) and ran away for 3 fucking days. While stranding us in a hospital 3 hours from their home, calling FIL every hour or more to yell at him?!?!? No body respects her etc blablabla she should just kill herself right now because no one cares anyways. 

Yep. She threatened to kill herself to get her way! 

Fil got released AMA and we took him home, where she eventually came back to... 

Dh asked me not to loose my shit on her, I wish I did. She only got worse. Jokes on her oldest kiddo was born in Germany, with my husband and my mom there, DS was born in the US but we cut contact during the pregnancy because she tried shit again and now I’m almost 30 weeks and they don’t even know I’m pregnant. That’s what her behavior got her. Grandkids she doesn’t get to be in touch with, because she lost that privilege."

sewing,fco2skl,t3_ei2ahn,1577823000.0,"I agree with everyone else here. Sewing is really easy. The more complicated part will be drafting a pattern. Though I recommend not drafting your own, find a few patterns, where like pattern A has the perfect top part and pattern B is the skirt and combine them. 

The easiest route would be via PDF patterns, that means you can just print it whenever needed and don’t need to worry about cutting into a paper pattern. 

There’s a ton of PDF pattern makers out there. They usually always also have Facebook support groups where you can ask questions and get tips. 

Learning how to sew is as simple as looking up some YouTube videos. Get some scraps of fabric, like old thrift store sweaters/skirts/bed sheets. Draw straight lines and just follow the line, then squiggles, simply to learn how to guide your needle. Go slow at the beginning. Some machines have a switch where you can set the max speed. Slow and steady wins the race. 

Also grab some wine and a seamripper in preparation of the inevitable when things go wrong and you start cussing out your machine. Things will go wrong. Even if you do things the same as always. Then I usually get wine, my seam ripper and put my machine on a timeout until the next day. I also have a rule never to start sewing past 1am (if cutting the pattern and kids bedtime pushing delays happen) because then things definitely go wrong lol. 

When you’ve got a pattern and you want to try it, don’t use your nice fabric first. Get some old bed sheets from goodwill or so and try it out first. Just make sure you get stretchy fabric if the pattern asks for it or woven if the pattern asks for it 

And always read your pattern instructions at least twice BEFORE cutting the pattern. 

Some great pdf pattern designers for adults are: Patterns for Pirates, made for mermaids (the owners of those two are actually sisters), pattern emporium, striped swallow designs and I Love European patterns, they’re in german but once you’ve got the hang of understanding a pattern (give it 3 months of constant sewing it’s simple and all very logical), just follow the photo instructions. The website makerist.de has tons of patterns and almost every quarter they do a €2 sale meaning some of the designers put their patterns on sale for €2 a pop instead of the average ~$10. There’s even a Facebook group dedicated to help understanding german/international patterns (international knit sew alongs)."
