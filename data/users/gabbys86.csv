Just wanted to vent on the internet. Even that's not a good place apparently.
Thanks."
depression,fdyxc52,t3_encztz,1578784518.0,"For me it's more ""No feelings, apathy, go, do, survive"" method if I can call it that. In better times I even go to the gym. It is detachment. I do not have motivation oh no! I long for getting back home and staying up all night doing nothing because I feel like I used up all my time on 'living' so I have to make-up for ""lost time"" of doing nothing and letting myself feel - feel Bad. 

I do not recommend it but again who can recommend any type of being depressed. It's just different - also hard, and feels like you're playing a game with yourself and also the world. I think I/WE should get some type of award for putting up with all this."
Showerthoughts,fdypwlx,t3_en7gsm,1578782387.0,"Well and then, sometime in this modern world someone was like NO you need 5! Make Time for it and make thinking about what's healthy to eat 5 times a day - a priority, and everyone was like THAT SOUNDS GREAT"
depression,fdyngqv,t3_en7336,1578781704.0,"Oh yea signing up for this post. I don't remember when I wasn't depressed, it's ""happy, free days"" that I enjoy as a price for... idk staying alive? But They're weird for me. Like ""out of character"" for me. The seeming ""comfort"" of the emptiness and everyday sadness are what's 'natural'. I guess it's staying in this 'comfort zone' for so long that causes us(?) to get a bit addicted to our depression."
depression,fdsdyqp,t3_emrpqy,1578700484.0,HAppy! Birthday! I can relate to being alone on birthdays it does not feel good. Well here's an internet community for You. Always there :)
depression,fdfjoew,t1_fdfh8l7,1578363282.0,"Are You like me just searching for answers or already seeing someone? 

I'm not like you, but I really hope You find a way that works for You - to make U feel Better"
depression,fdfj48g,t3_el1q99,1578362903.0,"My god I do not click at every topic here but THIS. Required a lot of courage and I'm so proud and also intimidated by that... I haven't even told my friends or family how I feel. And You're doing amazing! It must have been so hard I can't imagine.

I'm so Proud of You even if I don't know You, and inspired too. I hope that there will only good things come from this!"
aromantic,fa1eop4,t3_e7dzrg,1575768862.0,"It's all good hon, You're allowed to want all the things. Also I spend some of my evenings making out with guys that I will never see again because that's 'safer' for me than getting in any relationship friendly or romantic. Just Want what you want and if along the way you figure out how to satisfy your needs that's the best way."
