Battery life is decent. Depends on what I’m doing. If it’s just note-taking, I can stretch it out for about six-eight hours. Thermals are alright. In Skyrim, I typically get temps in the mid-70s, occasionally spiking into the 80s, but I did repaste with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut.

If you’re getting the gen 2 and you’re in the US, go to r/ThinkPad’s wiki and find the discount codes for Lenovo’s site. Use the Tickets at Work link. Password is TXTATWORK. Save you a few hundred dollars. Just don’t custom order from Lenovo because you’re probably not going to see your laptop for a month or two. One other reason I ordered a refurb from eBay.

It's just to give you an idea of graphics power, as I don't run SolidWorks. Display is pretty good and it comes with a nice privacy shutter for the webcam. Keyboard's also excellent.

Even if it’s a one in a million chance, surely it’s more economical to build a shitload of hyperspace ramming missiles instead of destroyer fleets. That actually could have been interesting to explore the ramifications. Space Cold War where it’s no longer possible for two sides to wage full-scale war on each other."

If you're carrying it around and want lighter weight, then get the GS75. Your GPU will be a lower clocked version for the 2070 and 2080 models, but it should still run games fine. (The 2060 model is a full-powered version, which performs nearly as well as the Max-Q 2080.) If you're just going to leave it at your desk, then get the GE75. It's a bit heavier, though still okay for a 17"" laptop, but it has a full-powered GPU on all models and the thicker chassis allows MSI to put in a better cooler solution. You'll get more gaming performance out of the GE75."
