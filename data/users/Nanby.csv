Where the next two normal or equally weird?"
AusFinance,ff704kb,t1_ff5twgt,1579638453.0,They could also look for a ground-floor apartment that has a courtyard. They're less common though.
leanfire,ff6zh0u,t1_ff6hj9t,1579638071.0,"I'd rather be a part-time teacher than a substitute.  You'd still be your own classes. Behaviour management would be much easier than being a sub. You do have to grade/report etc, but that'd be a lot easier if you taught half as many classes as usual."
weddingplanning,ff124kq,t3_er3b8d,1579474451.0,"The top one! The lace is much more delicate, which suits you more. I also love the back of the top one - it makes your waist look much slimmer than the bottom, and looks very classy."
legaladvice,ff0vku5,t3_er26tz,1579472724.0,"From a quality of life perspective, you need to get a new GP. A lawyer may be able to help with the other stuff, but you need to look after yourself and go to a new GP."
weddingplanning,feul0k0,t1_fen9uvx,1579387550.0,"A lot of people send out save the dates 12 to 18 months in advance (in my area). So it's totally plausible someone has been in a relationship for over a year, and still won't be invited as someone's significant other."
TrueOffMyChest,feoiu5p,t1_feneydh,1579300784.0,"I think blinking attracts attention more, but they're harder for our eyes to track the distance, speed, etc of them.  I think there was a study that said that cyclists feel safer with blinking lights. (Cbf to find a link sorry)"
financialindependence,feo714x,t3_eq5ulg,1579295935.0,"Not that extreme, but I lived in employer-supplied housing for 6 years. The rent was $100/month for a decent 2 bedroom unit. That allowed me to save a fair chunk. Alas, it wasn't forever."
leanfire,fem1w0z,t3_epucp6,1579237054.0,I don't think that counts.  Otherwise every teacher would be leanFIREd haha.
weddingplanning,felcitw,t3_epr036,1579218966.0,"I'd personally hate to attend an outdoor summer wedding in Queensland. Unless it was Toowoomba or something. I think everyone would feel very uncomfortable in fancy clothes while outside, in the sun, at 3pm in the afternoon."
weddingplanning,felc8kw,t1_feki6dy,1579218780.0,"I like the idea of setting one location (one particular bar) that's close by for people who want to kick on. I've been to a wedding where's we wanted to continue to hang out, but it was too hard to pick or organise other people to meet us there too."
natureismetal,fei3jxr,t1_fehkw70,1579129499.0,Wrong Corella.
natureismetal,fei3haq,t1_fehdh15,1579129453.0,It's Corella Creek.
natureismetal,fei3b5y,t1_fehla4h,1579129345.0,It *is* Australia?
AusFinance,fefqfse,t3_eotrgv,1579062268.0,"Thanks for this advice. I read it (only briefly mentioned) in a Money magazine article. I've made an appointment for tomorrow, actually!"
AskReddit,fe4uupv,t1_fe0kyfu,1578863019.0,"Because it builds intimacy. Those touches aren't necessarily sexual, but they're building love between the two of you. This means that when one of you does initiate sex, the building blocks of intimacy are already there."
AmItheAsshole,fe14i60,t1_fdzpifv,1578822407.0,"I know you go way downvoted, but I agree with you. If the bride is throwing an extra party on top of her wedding, then she should pay for it."
relationships,fe0alcq,t1_fe0ad86,1578807861.0,"It's not pearl clutching, it's just describing differences in how people live. Some people don't drink at all, some not much, and some drink regularly. If OP & his wife are at different ends of the scale, then it's obviously not going to work out."
relationships,fe09z85,t1_fdye08s,1578807293.0,"I like this approach! It's much more positive than the others. If the co-workers don't get the hint and keep asking, then perhaps go to the other comments (""I don't want to talk about it. Thank you."") and then go grey rock."
AusFinance,fe08u7t,t1_fdzu2d1,1578806259.0,"If you had a spinal cord injury and ended up as a quad or paraplegic, you'd get a TPD payout. But your comment stands."
AusFinance,fdsapsq,t1_fdp3b02,1578698268.0,I love my Bonds undies. Do they count as luxury?

relationships,fdoxhiu,t1_fdovqyj,1578615120.0,Do people really do that? It sounds way easier to have a 2 minute shower than to wash with a cloth.
relationships,fdoshz7,t1_fdnn55j,1578611887.0,How do you wash your stinky bits without having a shower?
fiaustralia,fdoqv7c,t1_fdn5fzr,1578610857.0,"Well, the police protection is warranted."
legaladvice,fdkwxnk,t1_fdkvj2n,1578512857.0,I think that advice is often given because some people struggle to *not* reply and leave her on read if she starts spamming him with bulk messages.
AmItheAsshole,fdjmsk2,t1_fdiksgg,1578478471.0,That's really fucking brutal. I'm so sorry :(
AusFinance,fdjhun8,t1_fdj5qdh,1578471492.0,Would OP be better off selling some of their shares to lower their mortgage? Or just keep all their shares & Have a larger mortgage?
AusFinance,fdidapi,t1_fdgmpg8,1578440303.0,"In QLD, our new payrise start next week. After 8 years, a normal teacher who hasn't been promoted or jumped through any hoops will be on $100k. If you can prove you're a valuable teacher etc, that pay can go up to $120k."
weddingplanning,fdf18oj,t3_el0zyg,1578351017.0,"I have no problems with non-Saturday weddings. I have had to travel for every single wedding that I've ever been to, so taking an extra day off work is seriously no biggie. If I'm going away on a holiday anyway, then I normally like to make it worthwhile anyway and take as much time off work as possible."
weddingplanning,fddayv0,t3_ekp1tz,1578303293.0,"""Wishing wells"" are very common in my area (and nooo one has registries). So the invite says something like, ""There will be a wishing well at the reception."" Or something simple."

AmItheAsshole,fd0gp2w,t1_fczhnd2,1578118532.0,Why can't the bride have 1 more bridesmaid? (What's the difference between having 7 bridesmaids or having 8?) OP is NTA.
AmItheAsshole,fcxehbk,t1_fcwiuai,1578060789.0,Emma-lee?
AusLegal,fcvymsl,t1_fcvy8vm,1578013084.0,"Thanks for your insight! So it's been less than 12 months, so that can be perfectly normal. All my injuries have been stable for the last few months, so no on-going costs."
dataisbeautiful,fcvsnv2,t3_ej3e43,1578009210.0,How long have you and your partner been together? Do you live together or have kids?
dataisbeautiful,fcvsjpt,t3_ej6c6k,1578009137.0,That clear progress is awesome to see!
todayilearned,fcvr9ud,t1_fcv1lx8,1578008308.0,I'd call it a plaster.
todayilearned,fcvr8wp,t1_fcu8ovm,1578008292.0,They're all very American examples.

todayilearned,fcu1vso,t1_fcu1o5m,1577969821.0,Lemon juice. We don't drink uncarbonated versions.
AusFinance,fcu03md,t1_fcsxvy6,1577967814.0,Hmmm.. well you mention he has super (HostPlus) so I'd be surprised if he has no insurance at all.
AusFinance,fcu01u1,t1_fcsxt83,1577967756.0,"He still needs something in am emergency fund, in my opinion. For those crazy things you don't expect.  But perhaps for him, since he has other safety nets (your parents) and low expenses, then maybe his EF can be lower then expected. That being said, I'd get nervous if it dropped too low. So perhaps you only have ~$2k to invest for him."
relationships,fctlbuj,t1_fct5ll0,1577947526.0,I agree with you on the first few points. But OP doesn't need to desexualise herself or  fart in front of them to make herself less date-worthy. But your first few points are worth taking on board.
leanfire,fctktlo,t1_fctikzc,1577946924.0,"Me too. I had a huge depressive episode earlier in the year, and my budget lines for food went through the roof. As well as paying so much more for convenience stuff, because I didn't have the mental space to deal with it."

weddingplanning,fcow981,t3_ehw01w,1577843297.0,I'd find it weird. I think of it as a church song / song of worship. And then dancing with your Dad to it makes it sound like you're worshipping your Dad as a God? But if you're not religious and no one at the wedding is... then you do you.
AusFinance,fcoq6c7,t1_fcmygat,1577838623.0,Hot damn. That's a lot.

AmItheAsshole,fcmqeof,t3_ei0hup,1577787075.0,"NTA. As others have pointed out, don't muck around with preeclampsia.  But perhaps there's others things you can do for your wife. 

Bring in some 2 player board games. Or take her for a walk to the hospital cafe. Or pack a picnic and take her to a nice courtyard or something around the hospital grounds (if allowed). Or organise for a friend to visit each day. Being in hospital for an extended period *suuucks*, and you're going to have to be her main source of entertainment for awhile."
AmItheAsshole,fcmq7k6,t1_fcmo74c,1577786795.0,Ok so YTA. It'd be different if you were funnelling the money into investments... But you're spending it on other shit? Which was exactly what your ex-husband was doing?

relationships,fcjrjf5,t3_ehk4oo,1577701042.0,It's nice that you're giving her closure (or are you giving yourself closure?). But don't be offended or too pushy if she doesn't reply or want to get back with you.
relationships,fcjrfti,t3_ehkagy,1577700893.0,"If you enjoy them, then fuck what other people think. Gaming and exercising are both perfectly normal activities.

I mentioned it to my mum once (early-60s) and she'd never heard of it either. So I assume it's genetic - the shape of our anatomy etc means we're less likely to get a UTI.
