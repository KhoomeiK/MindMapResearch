Now, i feel like the story is the strongest part but at the expense of the loot and innovative gameplay which is an issue as youtube lore channels are alot cheaper than unfufilling season passes."
todayilearned,fff2k6t,t1_fff1uja,1579873974.0,"It makes you have so much more respect for Davies when you see what a job he did not only rebooting the show but delivering those first four seasons at the level they were. Yeah there were shaky episodes but on the budget he had at BBC  they produced some quality sci-fi and I would have him back in a heart beat at the helm.

I enjoy the prequels myself, whatever the criticisms I have to rate Lucas for trying to branch out and increase the scope of his universe rather than play it safe. However, I feel like with the original trilogy if he had someone else directing then a few of the more questionable elements may have been left out or watered down."
todayilearned,fff19me,t1_fff0c4a,1579872921.0,The most disappointing thing is every fan was rejoicing when he took over due to some of the episodes he wrote in the first four seasons. Someone on reddit summed it up perfectly for me the other day by comparing  Moffat to George Lucas like they are great creators but need someone to reign them in at times otherwise you end up with the prequels.
todayilearned,ffex1xd,t1_ffesz6v,1579868992.0,"Definately disagree that season 5 was when Doctor Who got solid, the Davies era was the pinnacle of story telling and their over arching plot lines were so much stronger which is why their finales always had such a better pay off. It was when Moffat took over that alot of the story lines got convoluted and became almost complex for the sake of it like the whole Silence. 

Also, season 5 gave us the power ranger versions of the Daleks for that reason alone the whole season is abomination just for that decision."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffc65fu,t1_ffc2ttb,1579792437.0,"I always thought Star Trek was optimistic until you start looking past the surface.

television,ffbmsrd,t1_ffbj57f,1579773171.0,"There were alot of articles last year that basically said it was better financially for Netflix to cancel.a show around season 2 or 3 due to the terms of financing shows in order to attract studios to work with them. It had something to do with the bonuses they offered which would increase per season and would be into the millions by season 3 or 4. So, if the data doesn't show sustained numbers and people signing up to watch Netflix just cut their losses as they assume audiences have already moved on to the next big hit. 

It is why Netflix, plus the other streaming services, are focusing heavily on in house development of shows where they have much more control over the finances and making shows that are sustainable in the long run."

I get the doctor is a jackass but a constant theme is her proclaiming her gender as some sort of trump card over her previous incarnations. I just don't think it is the right message for a show that has always been progressive since it was rebooted, so just seems a moot aspect to bash us over the head with."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ff5s18l,t1_ff5przc,1579608034.0,"This is literally how the original Nazis worked, not all of  Germany woke up one day and was like let's go vote for the radical right when they had one of the most Liberal governments in the world at that point. You only have to look at the polling figures for 1928 to see how minor the National Socialist part was in German politics. However, what did lure people in was offering them food, a faux job in the S. A etc. during the great depression which provided a sense of belonging and providing a common enemy in communism, then Judaism, to manipulate people into seeing the party as the saviours of Germany. Its extremist ideology 101 to lure people in by providing a sense of belonging or community coupled with an enemy to scape goat whether that is Westerners, Capitalists or a different ethnicity"
LeopardsAteMyFace,ff3ajmp,t1_ff38hmj,1579537437.0,"Firstly that's a headline from the daily  Mail that is right wing paper it be sort of like me taking Fox news as the bias outlet for American news. But I don't get how that is racist her mother is from Compton I could understand if they weren't and they just picked the only African American area they heard from a random rap song. 

They did the same thing to Kate not with that headline but detailing every aspect of her growing up, her family life etc. to the point we all know she had a poster of William on her wall which had accusations she was targeted him. There was also alot more issues with deciding whether Kate was right without blue blood to marry William causing their relationship to break down until Wills basically chose her and made his family accept it. Whereas the general consensus on Megan was how glorious it would be for the Royal family to modernise and they married pretty quickly in terms of royal weddings. Even Piers Morgan to begin with spoke about her in a positive light."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ff38m54,t1_ff376ns,1579536269.0,"The letter bit is totally wrong but if it turns out Harry was throwing out insults and making threats then they are just as heinous as one another in my eyes.

I have sympathy for certain people harassed by the media but not for the royals whose whole position is partly reliant upon media coverage as a means to create a sense of intrigue and enforce their position. Also, I would have cared if they didn't play the race card as like I can give countless examples of Royals being dragged through the press for their behaviour whether it was valid or not. 

Furthermore, it is not like there was not smoke without fire as there were rumbles about Megan clashing with staff and other members of the royals over protocol. Then there is clear footage of her using Prince Harry to solicit work which contradicts protocol."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ff35rgt,t1_ff34wtk,1579534337.0,"I wouldn't care if I asked for that attention by getting into show business then marrying into one of the most prominent families in the world. It's like asking if I feel sorry for a person who climbs into a tiger enclosure and then gets mauled, you knew the risks of getting into the lion den that is the Royal family there is even a netflix series on it now. 

Also, why is it the rags to the blame when they write something negative about the couple but they are prepared to sell an interview on the royals who subsidised the couple for the last how many years. 

Finally, when they had a decent relationship until recently, put her through private education and seems to have intact relationships with his other children that doesn't scream total arsehole parent coming from someone who felt relieved when their dad passed."

LeopardsAteMyFace,ff2uxui,t1_ff2u35b,1579525158.0,"Obviously paying for your child's private education and the acting classes is considered doing nothing for your child, sorry Megan's dad how could you that negligent evil father. 

Also, on that note if the royals whole heartedly rejected her then why has Charles been using his own money to finance their wedding and subsidise Harry's allowance to ensure he can afford the life style."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ff2up0z,t1_ff267zs,1579524887.0,"It isn't racism that is just the easy approach to make Megan look a victim, every news reporter in this country brown nosed Megan when it was first announced and how it would be a godsend for the Royal family. The issue arose when Megan realised how little influence her and Harry will ever have in that royal circle as even George has more authority from a technical standpoint than Harry now.

At the end of the day regardless of your race or position if you seem to intefer with royal protocol then you are asking for a certain section of the press to attack you. Ask Princess Margaret the Queens actual sister was it racism when the press followed her on holiday and posted pictures of her with a younger man or the countless other stories about her scandals. Or Prince Philip himself how he was rejected initially by most the establishment in Britain owing to his status despite being a decorated British naval officer, member of a royal House etc."

TopMindsOfReddit,fed37ir,t1_fecibwb,1578996533.0,I have no issue with anyone teaching anything but you can do this in a way that is not preaching a certain political theory whether that is right or left and just being unbiased. This is not an attack on the whole of the left or even every member of the left who came from a middle class to upper class background. My issue is with those members on the left who are from an affluent background and dogmatic in their approach to political theory to such an extent that they will argue with you about the realities of working class life despite never living it.
TopMindsOfReddit,fed27w0,t1_feceb9y,1578995051.0,"That there is an elitist segment of the left that has always existed that are the intellectuals who spent their time in the educational sphere and was able to spend their whole time engaging in intellectual discourse due to their affluent position. Whatever way you present they are member of an elite class  and is normally reflected by their views differing greatly to the working class socialist movements who were more pragmatic rather than dogmatic to political theories. 

The best example of this is in Russia, the Socialist Russian party had a populist movement amongst the peasantry, the largest body of workers in a Russia, due to their agrarian socialist policies. However, the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks ousted them from sharing power to pursue Marxism despite the revolution not complying in anyway to his theory. So, you ended up with the dictatorship of the Proletariat which is literally a segment of the left who was an elite that treated the working class the same as a capitalistic government by exploiting them and not improving their quality of life."

I am taking nothing from the left or defending the right, just disputing the idea that there is no such thing as an elitist left.
