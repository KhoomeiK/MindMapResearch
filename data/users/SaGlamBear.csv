sanantonio,ffddizh,t3_eszuh3,1579818607.0,"Shavano Park has worse traffic to get to from anywhere in the city. You have to fight I-10 or 1604 traffic and if you’re especially unlucky, DeZavala traffic.  You will have access to a lot newer apartments in Shavano Park whereas the apartments in Alamo Heights are much older (but they’re charming and the neighborhoods are a lot more walkable). 

If y’all are intending on flying a lot, alamo heights is much closer to the airport.  If you like creature comforts like Costco, and malls, and Super WalMart’s Shavano Park is better."
history,ffd9023,t1_ffbu766,1579815774.0,That’s actually quite interesting. So thou/thee was the informal and you was the formal and everyone just started to use You as the formal?

HealthInsurance,ffbg4um,t3_esnvq1,1579763800.0,"Both have the same deductible but the difference lies in the plan design. The HDHP plan only pays preventive services like annual check ups and certain maintenance medications at 100% and everything
Else requires you to meet your 6550 deductible.  

Whereas on the other plan, doctors’ visits are covered at $40 for primary care and $60 for specialists, on the HDHP plan you will have the pay the full cost (between $100-$300+) if you want to see a doctor for anything.  Moreover, on plan B your drugs are either a  $20, $50 or $75 copay. On the HDHP plan (plan A) they are again, the full cost up the deductible and then covered at 70% until you reach your out of pocket maximum. 

Consider plan A as a safeguard against a large medical emergency but not really conventional medical insurance the way we’ve traditionally known it. 

A question I would ask is, does your employer contribute towards an HSA account?"
