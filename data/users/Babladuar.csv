No-hands ball games have been around about as long as people could make balls that didn't hurt to kick.

By that logic, swimming and running should have been the most popular sports in the world and athletes like usain bolt and michael phelps should have earn more than ronaldo and messi.

I know it isn't perfect and there are rooms for correction but is it to hard to understand that football is actually interesting for the rest of us and popular because it is fun and enjoyable, not just because everybody can played it?

After all of those midfield carrying he did for months and this is your reply?

Do you watch our match? He's the only one that can get the ball, pass it somewhere that isn't backward/sideways and more press resistance than any of our player bar pogba. The problem is he can't carry a midfield alone and his partner that isn't mctominay and pogba are fucking deadwood at best."
