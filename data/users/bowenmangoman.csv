ausents,ffhhnpd,t1_ffhhdj3,1579935666.0,Your not going to be using or incorporating native soil if you dont have to. It's really the fact that it stands out like nothing else and that the working conditions are miserable during grow season or you have to drop dosh on a greenhouse. The other reasons you listed aswell as this  keep alot of non  professional's and pros out of outdoor growing in Aus.
ausents,ffheog3,t1_ffh61y2,1579932138.0,It's not that the land isnt economical to grow on. It's that unless you have a greenhouse or something like  the green is just unnatural and easy to spot from land or air plus the smell doesnt easily blend in when there is no florals around and can drift kilometers on some grows.

If your intrested in long term health or athletic performance dont listen to what these guys say. This is a aesthetics forum mainly not a performance enhancement one. Alot of the guys on here will tell you what will make you look good. Not what is sustainable long term, healthy or good for your performance."
ufc,ffen0am,t3_esyayj,1579855204.0,Umm no. The ufc doesnt need more weight mens weight classes. It needs a women's 155 and a womens 170 or a male and female  openweight/ 265+ for men and 170+ for women before anything else.
PEDs,ffempso,t3_et7jw7,1579854785.0,I'd mix with mk677 and do proper pct. With cycles its not so much how much you gain its how much you can preserve after pct and the new plato it gives you to build off and/or up to.
brisbane,ffeaaac,t1_ffdwpx7,1579841088.0,"Yeah west end has been no good since the mid to late 80s.

MuayThai,ffbyfgf,t1_ffby21q,1579786740.0,Yeah they work well off thai style low and mid kicks as a double up or a trow off for the next combo. They also work well off a quick jab or post if you can gain your oppennt respect for either strike and land the opposite one.

PEDs,ff8wrh9,t1_ff8w9ws,1579698631.0,"Ostarine is ment to be used with mk677 in short burst at the start and during a 2 plus year mk677 cycle. The Russians designed this compound during the cold war. They used it on soliders, Labours, and teen athletes. It was seen as a gentler cheaper shelf stable alternative to the standard test/dbol gh epo cycles of the time. It had other theorized uses when the pattern was sold to a Jewish company based in America. The Super computers of the time ran test on human model on compounds. If they showed desirable models they where synthesized after further investigation of the series.

PEDs,ff8w2qn,t1_ff8vmae,1579698014.0,So nurses and pharmacists opions dont mean Jack shit? It wasn't designed for that. It was just one of the trails run on the compound. Millions of people have also died from illegal steroid use. It sits at around 30 thousand death a year in the states alone. Your talking to a industrial pharmacist. I'm telling you. You have no idea of the origins or history of these substances. Alot of these substances where designed with specific classified uses in mind. I suggest you shut up on topics you know nothing about.
PEDs,ff8vf2y,t1_ff8uwlu,1579697414.0,Fair enough. These compounds where designed with tailored made uses in mind. I dont feel like giving a history lesson on ostarine but its ment to be used with another anabolic compounds and a growth hormone secertors. Test in its isolated state is designed to be used in tandame with hgh and other compounds  for sustained performance enhancement. If you choose to use these compounds with aesthetics in mind at all. In my medical opion you are setting yourself up for a bad time at best and a heart attack or stroke at worst.
PEDs,ff8usqf,t1_ff8unm6,1579696816.0,"Because at mk677 startdard doses that equate to about 2-4 iu of hgh a day for 3 months can cause alot of anabolic type effects but way gentler. It still stimulates t production just in a gentler way without alot of the drawbacks of straight t, anabolics or sarms"
PEDs,ff8l83t,t3_es8z42,1579683925.0,Have you tried mk677 yet? I allways advise people to try a course of hgh type compounds or hgh before true anabolic agents. Or atleast fold hgh into your first cycle. Yes doses around 5-15mg will be good to start on. Remeber start low and work up. It's very common for people to set themselfs up for massive injuries after finishing there first cycle.

If you can get you leg and hips uo there are triangles and armbars too. An thats just 2 options from one defence. You can also just trap the arm/hand and sisscor/waiter sweep which is another defence.
bjj,fepwuu3,t3_eqazuo,1579333772.0,Think about it for a second. They are giving you a arm and applying downward pressure.

The whole gsp debate is stupid and so in analysis of fights that are never going to happen.

The key to mk677 is to not stop taking it. You can also run small mk2887 cycles if you find it hard to push thru platues but it should be avoided.
MMA,fe6gpho,t1_fe6fcmh,1578890367.0,Just no. It would either be a jab fest wrestle fuck by gsp or a knockout by rob. I agree if Rob could neutralize the jab but kicks or takedowns is the only way he or anyone else would be able to do that.
todayilearned,fe5ittf,t1_fe5ijt9,1578870018.0,I'd imagine people are leaving claymores unattended in Africa which goes against un charter. Claymores are really effective if you use them like motion activated land mines which your not susposed to do.
judo,fe5hpb2,t3_enthsk,1578869543.0,Yeah that sounds werid. As a person with that old grumpy judo attitude. I'd say i dont care. Athletes sleep with each other all the time big woop. There all grown adults hopefully. They are perusing an athletic passion. the same stuff happens in touch footbal/ mixed volleyball eg its just a part of training in a male female envrioment. I'm not condoning it. It's not the type of thing you'd want out in the open and if it comes to that someone is better off moving . The problem is you have a bunch of women in your club who will do that to the next  guy that comes along and some guy who is taking advantage of loose women. It's a 50/50 situation that everyone would be better off sorting out like civil humans instead of exiling someone.
todayilearned,fe5ejs9,t1_fe5dezk,1578868434.0,what i said pertained to ships. I could only think of a few situations when docking or transferring loads in dodgy ports where they would come in handy. Even then if prefer a ir scope or night vision. Claymores are only really useful for holding up a postion you think will get stormed or plating on rat runs. Claymores arent cheap especially motion activated ones  and c4 does a much better job 90 percent of the time. It would be better to plant charges in a tree line in conical shapes in alternating patterns  and just have some watch the tree line. That way you turn the tree line into a Insta kill zone. An can control what sequence and what charges you set off.
todayilearned,fe5c8g6,t1_fe5950z,1578867605.0,Yeah no. Fires and breaches are to much of a risk for that. No to mention the shockwaves of setting off explosive in confined spaces would probably disable the person who laided it. Seeing as  most claymores are set on watched points. You cant just leave a claymore an not watch it or be aware of its position. A smart enemy would use your own claymore against you.

Just let it rest up and heal and if you have any implants get them removed or ask for bio degradable implants. Go to the best surgeons and be strict with your pt. Stay on the mats and help with coaching and keep fitness up as much as you can. Human growth hormone and some anabolic agents can aid in recovery too.

There is a reason infantry is a sausage fest. An if i was a women in the field i wouldn't feel safe just being a women with threats of rape ect.  Male servicemen sexually assault and rape each other all the time i feel sorry for any female in infantry or going into it. In fact I feel sorry for allmost everyone in infantry who doesnt love it to death.

Id be complaining about being a grunt before I would sexism lol. I'm sorry to tell you but unless you 6 foot and built like a rugby player with rocks in your head.  you are a stupid bitch for being a grunt."

Catholicism,fdu3mao,t1_fdtfaq9,1578726938.0,Because people hijack Christianity for there own agendas. Just like how hitler tried to hijack an intertwine Nordic and Christian faiths for his own purposes.  so are other racial extermists for theres. You have groups of people trying to infuse African paganism into Christianity the same way hitler did Nordic paganism.
