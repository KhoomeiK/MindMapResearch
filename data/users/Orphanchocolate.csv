triplej,ffjk184,t1_ffjjzzz,1579999985.0,Love Fame Tragedy not charting was a bit stiff too considering the play he got
triplej,ffjjzzz,t3_etohwc,1579999962.0,Ruby Fields and Hobo Johnson both not charting in the hundo was a bit stiff to me. I figure they were near the mark so I'm more or less expecting them to be in the low 120's
AFL,ffjiljx,t3_etmlwu,1579999033.0,"The continued incompetent handling of the women's competition is frustrating as all hell to witness, it's not that hard to fixture the season fairly and also, shocking idea I know, result in the players being appropriately compensated for their time as professional athletes. 

How on earth Port hasn't gotten a team yet is also frustrating, the strong community building done by the club would result in a juggernaut of a team that finally affects the crows' list substantially. The showdowns would be monumental events and the Erin Phillips question would be fun to see play out. Also while I'm on it, when is the league B&F getting named the Erin Phillips medal? She deserves it surely."
TheAmazingRace,ffjbyv0,t1_ffhikjo,1579995093.0,"They did it with Survivor, Kaoh Rong filmed before Cambodia but because of a gimmick where fans chose the cast Cambodia aired first. This is just CBS blatantly not knowing what to do with the season I think."
triplej,ffhwjjw,t3_etof6j,1579957088.0,Such a great fucking countdown this year. I couldn't be happier with how everything shook out.

triplej,ffh3uyo,t3_etjox5,1579922386.0,This has been a banging early countdown. I hope that means we've got some Q U A L I T Y further along
AFL,ffh3t2l,t3_etjkl2,1579922347.0,Fucking hell injuries aren't fair
triplej,ffef2sn,t3_et2ntg,1579845593.0,Got a work party so I'm gonna be on my best behaviour while talking absolute shit about the countdown online. It'll be a fun dichotomy
triplej,ffdbvtx,t3_est1ry,1579817571.0,"See I'd love that and all, it's a good LAV to take out the #1 after all, but I'm not convinced tunas is going to be indicative this year. The data is massively skewed and way smaller than previous years, with the mythical 3 million votes this year I think it's at best a top 5. This has been fun but I just don't see it happening."
ThriftStoreHauls,ff8rm38,t3_es2vj8,1579693312.0,OPULENCE darling
AFL,ff8kdz7,t1_ff8hmsp,1579682665.0,Hi daddy Trumpu hope the widdle impeachy weachy isn't getting you too down uWu
CrappyDesign,ff7n8x8,t3_es21o6,1579653605.0,I think the idea is the time it takes to divert and kill the dude will result in the other 5 getting off of the tracks but it is *very* badly conveyed.
triplej,ff5daoa,t1_ff5anb5,1579588112.0,"Yeah I'm a fan of Ruel personally, I'm just commenting on how Instagram is the sort of platform his fanbase (Typically younger, typically female) would be using and so pulling data from there has the bias we see in the tunas data. Especially with such a small number of respondents for Tunas this year (23,000 less than the biggest year 2017) the skew is huge especially for more niche songs like Ludens which at one point was in the top 10."
funhaus,ff49gbp,t3_erdlm5,1579558443.0,This is a great idea for a series. They should do the Little Britain game. It was... something. Ooh and the Evil Dead game and the Home Alone games. I might collect bad licensed games
triplej,ff2riai,t3_erash4,1579520882.0,"I feel like Illy will crash out with Then What and end up at 100. 

The Ruel overepresentation from Tunas will be shown as a skewed dataset as he logs maybe 2 in the 100. EDIT: 2 songs not at #2 

Dance Monkey's vocal contingent against it will prove fruitless as Tones becomes the first solo female artist to win the countdown. With Billie Eilish in second. Though to be perfectly honest either of them could win and I'd be so fucking stoked.

The chats will cop a top 10 thanks to their near universal charm also known as how the Rubens and Ocean Alley won. 

Sofi Tukker with Purple Hat as well as MEDUZA with Piece of Your Heart will be the highest placing clubbing-est songs not by Flume anyway.

Juice won't be top 10. I'd even hazard a guess it's as low as 20.

Flume will top 5 again because it's Flume.

Hobo Johnson has a good chance at being the number 100 song but could somehow pull off a top 40 appearance out of nowhere. Typical Story is just that sort of song.

Denzel will place 8th or 9th. I don't see it having enough momentum to cancel out the mainstream voters. I doubt an LAV will ever take out the countdown unless one gets the endorsement Alex Lahey's did and is also clearly the best one of the year.

Jellyfish will undeservedly crash out of the top 20. Benee will also drop another few places from her Tunas. 

Bury a friend will shoot up from its Tunas place as will Everything I wanted I do think they will cannibalise some of Bad Guy's votes though in the process. 

Ludens will unfortunately drop a good 20 places from its Tunas as well. (Of all of my predictions I want to be wrong about this one the most)

Ruby Fields should come in around the 70's. Trouble while being an better song in my opinion doesn't get the public going like Dinosaurs did.

ONEFOUR might come out of nowhere and make it in given how much the backlash to venues being intimidated out of hosting them resonates with the core J's audience."

AFL,ff1hova,t3_eqvyfo,1579479397.0,This is some exciting stuff it's not just telling crows fans what they want to hear and it's not a senseless beat up. Massive breath of fresh air in the media climate of today
SpoiledSurvivor,fepwqcp,t1_fepuhyh,1579333656.0,"In the black and white montage they'll play Genre Bear fucking around and falling off, Courtney doing the devil horns and then finally the hugomatic 2000^tm getting voted out as some sort of lesson to always pay attention"

AFL,fep0esg,t1_fep00j9,1579309347.0,And? That doesn't change the fact the government has been completely fucking useless this entire time. I've personally witnessed a handful of people acting as if the rains solve everything but it doesn't. Murdoch media propaganda in full swing
offmychest,feo0of1,t3_eq0mo8,1579293561.0,"So I was given a bit of perspective here a while ago. Entry level doesn't mean first job to a lot of companies, it means the first stop in their company. This is why they have x years experience in the requirements because that's what they want."
AFL,fem7t0x,t3_epghw4,1579242858.0,"The biggest thing would be the fact that the media is so overstaffed with so little news that they would immediately become the poster child for years to come. This means not only do they have their on field performance to worry about they also have to be a role model, an exemplary citizen, an LGBTQIA+ representative AND the acceptable version of gay for a lot of people. This means no fuck ups, no dissenting opinions and more importantly for someone in this industry: No legacy beyond being the gay one. 

That doesn't even mention the fact that timing of announcement would be ripe for attacks from nuffies. If you say it before the end of your career it's ""Trying to hold onto some relevancy before getting delisted"" if you say it at the start of your career it's ""Trying to stand out by playing the gay card"" even coming out after your career is over is a net negative because it immediately recontextualises you and everything you worked for and achieved. All those rumours, all the disparaging comments, everything comes back to the fore and it's not just at you. People are fucked up and can and will track down anybody you were publicly associated with, perhaps dated while on your journey towards figuring out your true identity, and they will be attacked and harassed as bad if not worse. 

It might only be 1-2% of a fanbase that's otherwise wholly positive (Though as we saw from the Mouncey situation that number would be much higher in reality) but it's enough to deter all but the absolute maddest. The existence of that person does not make others weaker or lesser comparatively I must say, just some people are up for making that splash and others aren't. 

I think someone will come out one day but I would be surprised if it came from the guys who are maturing now. I grew up during the same time and played representative sport at the same time as them and any inkling of homosexuality was a weakness to be exploited. I don't know how universal this experience is for everyone who played representative sport but my experience was that if you were even .002% lesser than someone else you weren't selected. These metrics that are only maybe a fifth related to game skill stack up eventually and the weird, the effeminate, the people earmarked for members of the LGBTQIA+ community (Fuck I wish they used that instead of what I would hear), the people that don't fit in get weeded out unless they are the absolute best and nobody can top them. 

I hope it's a positive but I'm not optimistic. Not yet anyway."
AFL,fem6qhb,t1_felr2iv,1579241724.0,Genuinely I can't think of anybody at least on reddit in the crows area that were deadset on getting Grundy. The only people I ever saw advocating were fans of Victorian clubs. Like it makes no sense. At all.

AFL,fe7gwkq,t3_eo1srq,1578914378.0,Having pieces like this are important. The transition from anything of note whether that be representative sport or fame by way of internet or television can be debilitating.

adelaidefc,fdjva08,t1_fct3zg9,1578488655.0,"After such a [Meh](https://youtu.be/V1y5ZrSKdVw) season in 2019 you would be forgiven for thinking the Crows are a sinking ship and ordering a Gold Coast membership because at least the league gives them draft breaks. 

[The Fact they send the same pens in the membership packs aside](https://i.imgur.com/WPSYtnq.jpg) Don't ask why I know that.

In 2020 the crows are poised to be the ""Surprise"" to only the Vic media. Anybody worth their salt who's been following the club knows there's a bristling undercurrent of youth ready to take over the reigns from the veterans on the list and now under the care of new coach Matty Nicks, a new leadership group and the freedom to have a go without the constant outside pressure the club was subjected to the minute the 2017 grand final finished. It's a new decade and with it comes new faces and very possibly new success. Safe to say there's some optimism now that it's likely many of the fairweather fans have disappeared for the time being. 

With the debut **(FINALLY)** of Pride of the Yellow, Blue and Red, Ned 'The Legs' McHenry, the Holy Order of the Number 25 is similarly excited. This young man can and will tear up the scene with his blazing speed and tactful skills. If you're looking for a rising star contender from this squad it'll be this man. 

The fixture starts amazingly well with Sydney, Port, Brisbane and Richmond all in the first 4 weeks. This group can and possibly will be put through the wringer but staying strong and believing in the club is what's going to matter for fans. Other fixtures of note include Round 7 against Hugh Greenwood and the Gold Coast Suns, Rounds 10-12 against the turncoat Edward Betts (Assuming he actually plays more than 2 games out of the twos), the unfortunate gentle giant Sauce and the suddenly going to be rated fairly because he plays for a Victorian team Alex Keath before rounding out the home and away against serial scapegoat [Josh Jenkins](https://www.reddit.com/r/adelaidefc/comments/874imx/despite_the_disappointment_i_think_we_can_all/) Jokes aside Jenkins was the light in the darkness for a good couple of years and will compliment Geelong very nicely. I like to think I've matured since that post. 

Doubleups are: Port, Richmond, Melbourne, The Planes and The Saints. 

Will this be a premiership year? Almost certainly not. Will this be a big year? Absolutely but in a different way than most would think ""Big"" means. This is the year the Nicks era begins and the players buying into it will define the next few years in its wake."
