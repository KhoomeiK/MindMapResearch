If you just don’t like a certain skin color that’s fine, don’t go out of your way to act racist or attack someone. 

But on an national level we should keep certain races, cultures, religions out so to main status quo, order, identity and culture.

Tribalism is natural and that can branch into racism but it still depends... 

Like in Brazil and Singapore, there’s so much variation and diversity but people still coexist. 

But the catch is they all identity as Brazilian or Singaporean. 

Most countries won’t be like them so it’s best to stay near homogenous will slight immigration."

I specify some tiny amount of mixing is fine, but to have the most diversity it’s important to always keep purity. 

Also don’t you think it would mess with identity? 

And how bout racism? Wouldn’t it be more prevalent when you have people to be racist against? 

Also statistics have shown marriages work out 10% better than interracial ones. 

From 41% for homogenous go 31% for interracial.

And do understand it’s actually an tactic to have offspring in another country to take hold of its political system and people. 

And when we have a minority in a country there will often be complaints and whining about oppression and stuff, if they never existed there won’t be any oppression and neither would their be any constant whining, 

It’s called tribalism, we need a group to associate with and the color of our skin is one of them. 

Oh and the world was never majority white actually, Europe is quite the tiny place compare to other continents. 

Now onto the refugees...

Ever heard of grooming gangs? How bout No Go Zones? 

Where Muslims literally don’t allow police, nor citizens of a country to go there when it’s literally their own country. 

And did you know most refugees are just men? Not even mother’s or children but just men? And people who just want jobs in another country but claim as refugee to get there?

How bout the fact that refugees take resources and don’t do much for the native population yet because of PC culture and SJWs they might even have political power over the country and area? 

How bout Paris and London being trashed? 

Don’t you think they need a little more respect and culture?

It causes people to become more racist and xenophobic which is already happening to Europe

The culture can either mix, or one will just disappear, but this can really cause an problems when your culture is massively influenced in such an short time by another culture because the people brought their culture with them instead of integrating. 

Diversity doesn’t equal unity either. 

Unity is unity.

A homogenous society has very similar cultural and identity. 

You can’t be an racist when there aren’t other people to discriminate against, and I didn’t mean to make it sound like racism should be encouraged either. 

You can’t be pecking others when your identity and beliefs are pretty similar.

But assuming you step out of line, unless your culture promotes “pecking” others for every little thing then there’s something wrong with the culture or people and not because of an homogenous group or country. 

Also I’m pretty sure tourism are allowed in most countries, the people usually don’t start pecking you for being a tourist. Things only start happening when you want to integrate into the society where you aren’t welcome. 

And what you commented also proved that humans are tribalistic, not just beyond race. 

Influence is weird, because if you pick up other people culture and integrate it into your own that’s fine. 

But let’s say there’s an whole new wave of immigrant from else where, and eventually the cultures start mixing now the dilution of lets say Culture A is very significant.
