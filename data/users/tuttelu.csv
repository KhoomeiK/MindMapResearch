Always when I come home from school or anything else, I’m so fucking anxious and terrified that I’ll find my dog lying dead :( she’s 13 and have a bad heart. Maybe that’s why idk. Anyways, I hope you don’t end it when your dog dies:( happy new year, wish you all the best and a better mental health year"
depression,fcog0bc,t3_ei30zb,1577831331.0,"aww I’ve felt like this before, I totally forgot how happiness felt, I was always in this bubble were i felt like I wasn’t present at all. It was comfortable and I didn’t want to get out of this bubble. my sadness was were I felt comfortable because it was the only thing I knew. happiness felt strange and not-real. but I got better and I actually ended up being comfortable, when I was happy! I know you can do it!!!<3 happy new year, I wish all of you a better year!<3"
