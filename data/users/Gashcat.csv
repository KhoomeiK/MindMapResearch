news,ff83br1,t1_ff7s5vj,1579664875.0,"I take all the plastic bags i can get my hands on.  I need a place to put my plastic oj bottle, my 6 pack of individual puddings, my pasta with the superfluous plastic window, my meat sitting on styrofoam wrapped in plastic, and my fresh vegetables that I used a plastic bag from the roll to keep safe.

Yeah, fuck plastic bag bans until we actually make some real god damn change."

AdviceAnimals,fe65qfs,t1_fe65fl0,1578882393.0,Yay!  More people making shit money.  I haven’t been talking about employment.   It isn’t about employment.  It’s about real opportunity.  Those jobs will never have real opportunity to advance through the different class systems so long as they keep hiking minimum wage.  They will always be on the bottom.
AdviceAnimals,fe62wto,t1_fe61u28,1578880574.0,"All of that, all of any argument you have, is based on a critical flaw: that minimum wage increases actually result in more money for those making minimum wage.  They do not.  They have not, and will not."
AdviceAnimals,fe60g1a,t1_fe5zpud,1578879014.0,"If that’s the case, then they can go find a different job.  Or in your fantasy world are we all assigned a specific job at birth?  Nobody is forcing them to stay at a job they feel doesn’t pay them enough."
AdviceAnimals,fe5zcgs,t1_fe5yq28,1578878306.0,"What part of anything I have said means i look down on the job they do?  That is your own invention.  I'm just looking for a system in which the market decides what pay people receive.

And, your desire to pay everyone a wage that allows them to ""live"" IS the thing that is preventing them to make money based on their own merit.  Businesses are put in a catch 22 where they must pay asshole sniffers and then can't pay good employees.  I've lived it.  It sucks. 

Also, ""entitled"" is the keyword in your argument."
AdviceAnimals,fe5ynog,t1_fe5y5ac,1578877875.0,"Keeping them propped up with minimum wage isn't helping them learn anything of value.  And, more importantly, it is the jobs that pay well to stupid people that are the first to go as minimum wages go up."
AdviceAnimals,fe5yd86,t1_fe5y47m,1578877687.0,"On the other hand, I have infinite hope in people's ability to find a career in which they can earn an income based on their own merit.  You, conversely, think people need your help to simply live."

AdviceAnimals,fe5x0gv,t1_fe5v6uy,1578876837.0,"Awwww... that's cute.  So simple isn't it!  Somebody should just put you in charge cuz you got it all figured out.  It don't work like that or it would work like that.  The fact is as soon as companies have to pay more to their employees, they find ways to pay them less.  This isn't theory or wisecracking, I have lived this life.

Higher minimum wage means less hours, no benefits, shitty quality of life all around.  And worst of all, it means that no matter how long you have been there or how good you are at your job, you will never make more than minimum wage because your company is paying so much more to asshole sniffers than they deserve to make.

Here is the truth:  I have confidence in me (and everybody) and I think that I can find a job that I can excel at and thus make good money at.  Those who push for higher minimum wage are the opposite.  They think that the only way people will make more money is if they government  mandates it."
AdviceAnimals,fe5ug7m,t1_fe5tb3p,1578875201.0,"With enough time, you will realize that most of the people you work with are asshole sniffers of one type or another.  Simple truth is that for everybody making minimum wage that is actually working hard and trying to do a good job, there are a dozen asshole sniffers... and I would prefer those who work hard get what they deserve.

If you think they deserve money, then you can find a way to give it to them.  Don't take it out of my pocket by making it law.  I think that money should go to deserving workers, not asshole sniffers. 

And yeah, I have never scratched my ass at work and touched something other people put food in."
AdviceAnimals,fe5pqcv,t1_fe5phmc,1578872734.0,"That opinion will change with life experience.  He is literally taking money from you.  And, if he can make that same amount after getting canned for this stupid shit by going somewhere else, he learns nothing from it either."
AdviceAnimals,fe5gs4y,t1_fe489hf,1578869218.0,"A minimum wage freeze is more likely to result in qualified, deserving workers getting ahead.  

Where is the video of the Walmart guy scratching his ass and sniffing it before collecting carts?  Remember, he makes the same as people working hard and putting in the time in large part due to increasing minimum wage.  

What we need is a system that allows deserving workers the opportunity to have meaningful wage increases through time and training at a job, not a minimum wage increase.  Fluidity through income classes, not a propped up lower class."

worldnews,fdkd7pm,t1_fdk70yo,1578501398.0,Isn’t it against the Geneva convention to pretend to be injured and then attack opponents who are coming to your aid?  This seems like it would be in that same ballpark.

Stores are full of single use plasitcs and worrying about bags and regarding others as necessary is fucking stupid.  Make a new one for 2020!"
