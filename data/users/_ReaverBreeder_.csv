It's dangerous for the dude to be in the girls toilet, he'll get in more trouble than a girl in a guys room.

Source: been there, done that lol

Just make sure you trust the guy to protect you should anything go down.

Also, make sure you've got ample toilets so you're not taking up a toilet that is desperately needed."

Tinder is brutal for men; all dating sites are. They are so damn easy for us chicks, we get so many matches and messages that anyone who just says, 'hey,' doesn't get far. 

Race doesn't bother me, a toxic personality does. A superficial personality does. A non existent personality does.

Don't give up, dude. My ex is Asian/Indian from Fiji and it hasn't stopped him from hooking up!

You may have to lower your standards though.

Good luck! ðŸ’•"
