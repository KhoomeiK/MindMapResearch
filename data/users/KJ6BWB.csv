The pipe is probably hotter than the surrounding roof because the pipe carries air from the warm parts of your house. The roof is insulated by the attic and the plywood of the roof.

So the pipe warms the snow around it which melts into water, flows slightly away, refreezes, then is an ice dam that blocks further snow melt from running farther and instead of refreezing the mini lake backs up under the shingles and probably runs down that pipe.

About the only thing you can do is to install some heat lines on the roof and turn them on whenever you have snow up there.

> In his book On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, King speaks on his writing speed. He would set a daily goal of about 2,000 words. This would add up to about 180,000 words in three months of writing

HomeImprovement,feppy1c,t1_fep0te3,1579327393.0,So you spent a day loading one rolloff with 1/4 of the overall load. It took 5 more so 2 more than could have been necessary. So how much were you paid? And how much do they cost? We're comparing what it cost the company for three more days of your labor (including company matching for FICA) with two more rolloffs. Surely 1.5 days of your time is more than a single rolloff? Sounds like the company made the right decision there.
