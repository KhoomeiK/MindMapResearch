Advice,fgyplcb,t3_f0rzqk,1581185592.0,This was 100% me in high school. See if your area has a local community college that you can take some selective classes at. It's what really helped me!

AskDID,fgusz6v,t3_f0kd9i,1581128728.0,"First of all,you can't diagnose DID at age 3.

Second, kids are highly creative but lack vocabulary to explain themselves so she may sound crazy but she's probably just clever. 

Third, anyone who is a special ed teacher knows how to adapt their teaching for complicated situations....... They have no business ""diagnosing"" or labeling kids with disorders. Tell her to frickin educate herself."

DID,fgo4s5s,t1_fgo1p53,1580959773.0,"This is such an awesome response and exactly what I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong. I am not anti meds. Drugs can certainly help with overall symptoms (as you mentioned) but can't fix your DID. 

But I think what it comes down to is: you need to find someone who is 

A. An expert in THEIR field 
B. Expertise (or experience and willingness to research) THEIR field (i.e. DID and variants). 

Only then can you really get the fields to work together."

beer,fgnrnig,t3_ezj0si,1580951387.0,"Ok so the best thing you can have at any party is what we call ""bagel dogs."" They aren't bagels. They're more like pretzels. We call them bagels because real good bagels are boiled not baked. I digress.. 

Go to a store that has fresh pizza dough. We use Harris Teeter. Get fresh pizza dough and those little cocktail dogs, eggs, and an aluminum baking pan (cleaning the pan is a bitch). 

Take small pieces of the dough and wrap the dogs. Boil in water with baking soda for about 1 minute. Put on pan. (grease the pan, btw). Brush with egg yolk. Top with salt and rosemary (put both in a morter/pestle) 

Bake at 415 until Golden. 

In the meantime follow this recipe for beer cheese.
