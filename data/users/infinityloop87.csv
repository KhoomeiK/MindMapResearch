A girlfriend won't help unless you can better your relationship with yourself. I'm not sure if the loneliness comes from an expectation that I should be more social or something that I actually want. I'm a bit of an introvert and that's fine, absolutely fine. Some embrace it, proudly. You're craving intimacy maybe? With or without the relationship?"

It's comforting to know that these feels are shared by many, although at the same time, it's a horrible knowing that feelings of loneliness impact so many of us uh! I think I might have high-functioning depression, or persistent depressive disorder. I've made an appointment with the doc early next year so I'm hoping I'll be referred otherwise I'll go private. My behaviour isn't fair on others and I can't keep churning out the same shite and not go deep on trying to sort myself out. 

Yes, the job is brilliant - I'm the same as you!! Can fire into a heavy techno set at any time of day and it brings me happiness. Clubbing can be a great release. I can easily go clubbing solo which I have done when I've been moving around, but loneliness can hit here too at times. I think working from home alone has probably not done my mental health much good, but then again, I've carried these feelings with me through all work places, although I have made friends through it. 

I hope you manage to grab a more peaceful, positive and nurturing state of mind next year, seek the people out and have time alone that is healthy rather than a choice you'd rather not be making. xx"

This year took a real dip. I cried for the vast majority of the day. Living in Barcelona with a birthday at the end of April it was a gorgeous day, I had friends asking what I was doing and I felt miserable. I'm seeking help in the year because another birthday is not far off and I'd say it could be the same. 

I hope you manage to seek help and find relief today. Happy Birthday - do as you please but don't let these feelings continue onto another birthday. xxx"
