French,ffbbhto,t3_esjzl2,1579758549.0,"For years I thought about learning French because it seemed interesting, I've been to several French-speaking parts of the world, my mom spoke it, and it's a close part of my family's history. But I've been told multiple times that it's useless to learn so I never really started until recently.

If you're interested in the field of Cybersecurity learning French is actually really important and can open many doors, not just in that field but in other ways as well. Cultural, social, and it can also give you insight into a different culture, as well as make you gain a different perspective and more understanding of the human condition, as it is with all languages.

But the French-speaking world is huge and you're really missing out by not making an effort to learn, there are so many opportunities I didn't even know existed until recently."

SampleSize,ff8dxup,t1_ff8asnr,1579674452.0,"I see, all the people I know in their late 20s and early 30s say they feel like a teenager all the time and they do have more in common with one than someone in their late 30s. 18-late 30s is a broad age group, and although it's enough to span an entire generation it's not fit for the form and certain age groups within that do tend to have different things in common. Maybe a better way to group age would be 18-25, then late 20s-early 30s, mid-30s to late 30s. But still, I know several mid-30s who think people in their late 30s act super old. I say 18-25 because that's the weird transition years where everyone seems to be on a different stage of life; some people are having kids and getting married, others are CEOs, others are already working, the majority are in college, and others choose not to go to college."
SampleSize,ff7vte0,t1_ff7uex9,1579659554.0,"True, college-aged people would be around 19-22 by now. But although teenagers nowadays are going through some 'real-world' issues, those are not necessarily the same set of issues that adults are going through right now. Yes, they both are equally important, but the fact is that they're just not the same. Maybe you do identify with the older age group when it comes to certain issues, maybe the majority, and I'm not saying that your experiences are average or the same as other teenagers' (because you're an individual and everyone's are different), but on average, teenagers now deal with a common set of issues that adults of a certain age group simply can't relate to and vice versa."
SampleSize,ff7qzhc,t3_erx9jz,1579656231.0,"People 18+ wouldn't be in the same age group as someone 13-17, there's just too much of an experience difference. People in my age group (18-late 30s) would have very different life experiences, hobbies, and likenesses in general simply because we were raised in a totally different culture and have had more real-life experience than someone who's still in K-12. If your goal is to target the younger demographic, I'd suggest that a better age range be preteens-late teens up to age 16 or 17, which is high school age. This would exclude  college-aged working adults and for a good reason, because if you were to gather statistics, those in the end of your current age range (adults aged 18-21) would skew the data to be more representative of the slightly older demographic (18-30s), although your target is the younger one.

For example, people in the age range around 13-17 would all have similar life experiences which are mainly school, gossip, and college applications, but people aged 18-22 are going through a  whole different set of real-world issues, such as college, career, marriage, and debt, which definitely could impact their outlook on the world and results of this form."

todayilearned,ff27o3p,t1_ff26xxc,1579496175.0,"My dad was out of medical school around then, my parents have an age gap so they waited a while to have me, and I've always felt I only got to experience things just before they were starting to going away due to this. Anyways, they're both pretty stubborn about technology and it took a lot of convincing to get to them to cancel it!"

I miss recording a ringtone every couple of weeks and setting it to something really bizzarre. Nowadays I have the Big Blue F-Zero theme on my android and it's pretty fun whenever people try to guess what it is and how I did it, but it would be a lot more fun if more people were doing it. Honestly, the flip phone era was pretty fun while it lasted and it just felt different, I can't explain other than more wild, new, exciting, and happier."
