- try replacing your beaters with ""low volume"" ones. roland has their own branded ones or there's some that have tennis ball looking beaters. 

- try using a beater-less option like a roland KT-10 or triggera krigg, or alternatively ontrigger, pedal trigger, kickblaster (these can be used with a beater as well or without)

i have a 10 year old roland mesh kit, it still works as well as the day i bought it. meanwhile you can't swing a cat in any space of the internet where edrums are discussed without finding people complaining about their alesis components breaking, often when they're *new*. 

that TD-1DMK is going to come with the same snare as you have now, all 3 of the cymbals on it are going to be CY-5s (your hi hat is a CY-5, you should have CY-8s for your other two cymbals), a worse kick pad, and a far crappier bare bones module. 

the only thing it has going over your kit is the toms are mesh (small 6 inch PDX-6s though, smaller still when you factor in the plastic ring). roland doesn't really update tom or cymbal pads that often. hell, they're still using those rubber PD-8 toms, CY-8 cymbals, CY-5, and PDX6/8s on the different variations of the brand new TD-17!  

so what is it you're really looking to improve on your TD-4? if you're using VST already then you're not worried about improving the sounds (which those alesis modules probably wouldn't do anyway) and the kick pads on the alesis aren't likely to be any quieter than what you have already. 

if you're just looking to go all mesh just watch ebay for some PD-85s (i've seen them as cheap as ~$40 CAD before), PDX-6s, PDX-8s, or one of the larger (more expensive) other roland pads if you want a larger snare or whatever.  or find some cheap acoustic shells, buy some mesh heads and some side mounted ddrum redshot triggers and make your own. you may also want to get a 3 zone like CY-12R or larger."

they change the menu often but I would just trust that whatever is there is amazing. Last time I was there, I literally ate half of the menu as it was everything I love rolled into one place.. sui mai, doubles, beef.. etc. I love many different types of cuisine and that's what I love about Belmont.. they really do a bit of everything and do it well.

FYI, as someone who’s been to the Belmont many times, the only things that truly stand out are their charcuterie boards and their Trinidad doubles. Some of their more interesting dishes in terms of flavour combinations have been removed, and I’ve found their quality to have gone downhill over the past 2 years. The kitchen staff has changed quite a bit there which likely has to do with it.

But their charcuterie is to die for, so I still go just for that.

Chez Lucien is never quiet. Not exactly downtown, but not far away either.

Métropolitain during Hill Hour is also pretty fun and definitely boisterous.

Whalesbone on Bank (the original) with its communal seating is also boisterous, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Doubly so if you make friendly with the bartender and ask to see their LP collection - lots of good old Santana if you're into that.

We went twice to Two six Ate and really, really disappointed each time. It was just greasy pub like food each time - it wasn't great. We do love that type of Atmosphere! Union has some great food, i loved the chicken hearts and fried Chicken! We also really like Prohibition house a few doors down - great patio.

I can see that happening. I will say that two six ate’s specials are usually very good. Their pasta of the night has been nearly as good as Supply and Demand’s IMO, but not as good as Town’s.

We haven’t tried prohibition public house together yet, but my partner goes there for work events and has never been impressed. I’d imagine that during regular service, their menu would be more inspired and service better.

P.s. we went to Fairouz the other weekend and it was simply not great. You know when you go to an expensive-ish culturally themed restaurant here in Ottawa and expect delightful twists (e.g., Town’s take on Italian)? Fairouz was really uninspired and bland for what we were expecting. Proteins were like Play Food+Wine without the service. In the same vein, everything was cooked perfectly.

in terms of moving it, the easiest is going to be something like the TD-4KP but it's going to have shitty rubber pads and low end cymbals.

>  Fri, Jan 10

> Brendan Gallagher didn't practice on Friday and he's being evaluated for headaches.

> Advice: The Canadiens want to determine if the headaches are related to the concussion he just returned from on Thursday night or if they are because of an illness. He logged 17:19 of ice time against Edmonton after missing four games with a concussion."

how have you found the triggering with the trigger placed on top there? have you used it for much double bass?"
