overlord,fgkmstw,t1_fgjyix6,1580869136.0,You and me both brother. Cg is fine as long as it doesn’t look like shite but in my opinion overlord deserves better I remember reading the light novel and god the anime doesn’t do any of it justice
overlord,fgjhope,t1_fgiiqy7,1580844264.0,Let’s hope the animation quality isn’t shit. I would love animation on the level of hellsing ultimate and feels only right to be on par with the light novel

entertainment,fgfoikh,t1_fgfluf7,1580744020.0,I’d recommend the manga over the anime in all honesty the anime cuts outs out a lot doesn’t make it bad tho the anime is good. But if you want the darkest version it’s the light novel the manga is in between and the anime probably the lightest the choice is ultimately up to you
entertainment,fgflr3v,t1_fgcht9z,1580742111.0,Yeah it pretty sad when you realize how all bad that way of thinking is. I only understood it when I watched Rising of the shield hero where the mc is falsely accused of rape. The accuser she was a piece of work and rightfully renamed bitch later in the story is comparable to Amber
entertainment,fgfj549,t1_fgagxw5,1580740166.0,This is a byproduct of the metoo movement which means believe women or get called a number of things. It never helps when the media jumps on having people think you’re guilty without evidence and I’m honestly surprised this even came out and it was covered at all. Hopefully Depp get some justice

shieldbro,fgf1rf1,t1_fgezyoo,1580719724.0,It’s something I’m very use to seeing in gaming media where you see similar things like example they’ll take points off for the mc being a white male doesn’t matter about how good their character it’s just a no for them. I wish these publications would keep a stricter leash because it’s an unhealthy way to gain clicks off hate and ultimately unsustainable. The saying exists for a reason go woke go broke

AnimalsBeingJerks,fgek62s,t3_extv0z,1580701483.0,How many scratching posts do you have. I keep a few around the house. If you do have them probably just means you need to commit to playing with your cat overlords
memes,fgefwmt,t1_fgedjvr,1580698633.0,From what I’ve learned in life is it’s not that easy sadly. My mom was the victim of verbal and physical abuse as a kid so she grew accustomed to it. It took me years to understand my dad was verbally abusive and she just stuck with him. In other words it’s very hard to leave a situation when you’re use to it. Also saw this happen to my older brother his girlfriend was verbally abusive towards him lucky he got out of it but only because she left him.
shieldbro,fgao4h7,t1_fga5a9r,1580653552.0,Those people aren’t journalists in all honesty and it’s political preaching most the time. All these people really want is to preach and make shit for clicks. I believe a lot of these sites will die out eventually it’ll just be awhile till they can’t make anymore money
shieldbro,fgam9e3,t1_fg9tspc,1580652920.0,Yeah because when he thinks about it just reminds him of bitch and her betrayal
shieldbro,fgalga8,t3_exkta6,1580652625.0,I really hope that site dies. if there’s one thing I hate in media today is it’s more about their political opinions than the entertainment or actually being a journalist it’s just them shoving their politics down our throats.

memes,fg6geet,t1_fg65nf6,1580567235.0,Stadia is hated because it’s half baked product with a really poor price model aka you’re paying full price separately for games you are essentially renting with a very small library. Project xCloud is still in beta and offers 90 games to stadia’s I think 22 and out of that nothing worth using stadia over just buying hardware or getting into xbox’s library

Gundam,ffztnhc,t1_ffzqnlv,1580392560.0,I wish they at least gave the “villains” more character what we got was pretty brand villains and what rustal did after the final fight left me kinda confused and made me question what was the point of all the death. I’m all for neither side being right kinda what I like about the universal century but rustal just goes in and fixes shit
Gundam,ffyztgd,t1_ffyua7x,1580359509.0,Let’s compare season 1 and 2. Season 1 had an end goal get to earth and finish the job. Season 2 on the other hand felt like it was all over the place till like half way where shit just goes downhill. I felt for sure IBO didn’t build up to it’s ending properly. Where 00 we still had that underlying goal of eliminating war throughout it’s run. But my point a story need focus and goal from the start is always nice

I think it’s a 1.5 second delay on the shock he should be stopping a lot of loops while having the pressure needed to kick people off gens with ease. I’m still very new to the game but I’m confident doc will be a lot better at higher ranks but I would love people to explain things to me more precisely
deadbydaylight,ff8vvjg,t3_es93xv,1579697835.0,Now to harp extra loudly to the devs about how fast gens get done. Killers with a lot of map pressure you’re gonna see a lot more now effectively killing off ones with little to no map pressure
