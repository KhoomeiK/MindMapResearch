Dogtraining,ffb4bvy,t3_esnis4,1579751445.0,"My puppy HATED the crate. I decided to stop pushing it after a few weeks. Instead, I tethered her to my nightstand at night so she slept near me on the floor. During the day when I’m gone, I gate her in my kitchen. (She gets breaks from me, my husband or a dog walker during the day.) I’ve kept the crate in the kitchen and she uses it to nap. 

 This is my first dog, so I’m not an expert. We tried all the advice, but decided that crate training wasn’t critical for us and found other options for our lifestyle."
dogs,ff88cbb,t3_es6yn1,1579668935.0,I would definitely have your dog checked out by a vet to rule out a medical issue. I’d also talk to the vet about advice and next steps.
Goldendoodles,ff4tf3i,t3_ermv6w,1579572013.0,She looks great! My doodle has a grooming appointment in a few days and I love it when her fur is cropped short.
Dogtraining,fecgj5m,t3_eoefeu,1578973378.0, Could you reach out to some training organizations for advice? Maybe a group that trains guide dogs could use your skills or advise you on a path to take.
puppy101,fecg1gu,t3_eoesdr,1578973038.0,You’re awesome! It’s great that you recognized your feeling of frustration and decided not to direct it at your pup. I went through frequent “had it up to here” moments with my pup. But now she’s 9 months and those moments of frustration have become rare. Stick it out and things will get better with time. Cheers!
dogs,fe5zyn9,t3_enwxj0,1578878699.0,Yessss! I’ve been thinking the same thing!

puppy101,fdrmf80,t3_emw4dh,1578686574.0,"1. Dogs are social creatures, so your pup may prefer to be in someone's company vs. alone most of the time. As your dog gets older, it will probably be less ""demanding"" when around others, but may still follow you around. 

2. For leaving a pup alone, start with small time periods (seconds, then minutes, etc) of alone time. For my dog, I hid treats around her space before I left (starting with a few seconds) and built from there. Be calm when you leave and return....don't make those into big moments. 

3. A harness, treats and age helped our pup walk on a (usually) loose leash. I carry treats with me and have her walk on my left side. I regularly hold a treat out, so she learns to stay close for those. 

For pulling: I gradually slow my pace the harder she pulls....eventually stopping. That seems to click with her. Some training instructions tell you to stop the instant they start pulling, but that never seemed to sink in with my pup. (Although she's my first dog and I'm no expert!)"
dogs,fdj1zq6,t3_elmrg3,1578456377.0,I’m so sorry that you lost your friend. He was a beautiful dog.
GoldendoodleOwners,fdcukwm,t3_eko517,1578284741.0,"I’d ask the breeder what the pup has been eating and start on that. When you see the vet for the first time, find out if you should continue on that food or gradually switch. For treats, think about getting some puppy Kongs, filling them with yummy stuff and freezing them. My fave is a mix of plain yogurt and PB or plain pumpkin. 

Congratulations! You will have so much fun!"

puppy101,fd0ddpr,t3_ejoltq,1578117229.0,"Learning to go on walks is a big deal. When we first got our pup, a walk of just a few yards up the sidewalk was challenging. Getting around the block took 30-45 minutes when she was 2-3 months old. She was learning about all the sounds and smells and getting used to being on a leash.  Longer walks will come with time."
dogs,fd0bcvp,t3_ejpgyt,1578116413.0,I’m very sorry. Saying goodbye is so painful. I don’t have good advice other than to check out the r/petloss community.
puppy101,fbyaf8x,t3_ef4c7u,1577212011.0,I mix kibble with plain yogurt.
