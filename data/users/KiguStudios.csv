Often what ends up as the most upvoted, there's really not that much to say about it (dog video is a very good example) and it creates a lull. Next episode I'll be way more selective about what I'm covering. Do you have a channel too? Would love to see your stuff if so. Thx again."

youtubers,fetebmc,t3_eqkjr6,1579374527.0,"Hey!

I really enjoyed your video, dude! I think you've made a brave move, heading off somewhere unfamiliar. Moving to different places / countries has always been the most enriching thing in my life to date. 

I agree, your audio could use a little help... pick up a decent shotgun mic with directional sound or perhaps a lav mic to attach to your shirt. I really recommend for all kit queries that you hit up b and h photo video in their live chat (the world's most famous ""gear"" store in NYC). I never buy kit without consulting them first. They are insanely knowledgable with great recommendations. 

I really enjoyed your little theatrical moments (playing characters), so i'd definitely develop them! Always a good thing to add some humor to a video wherever appropriate!

Best of luck with your video making and in Cali.

Hasta luego from Spain!"
youtubers,fetd0nf,t3_eqk0r8,1579374053.0,"Hey! Great video, and what a dog you have! 

I think you've got a super natural presence on camera, which is hard to learn... so it's probably just who you are! Don't worry too much about the swearing in the early days. When you become monetised it should probably be bleeped, just sayin. It'll cost you some money.

I think your sound is fine and the lighting is fine too. Obv its cool that you now have a mic, but the main thing is i can hear you clearly and you're in focus. Stick to that and you're in business ;)

Best of luck with your next vid!"
