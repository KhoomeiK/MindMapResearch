TalesFromYourServer,ffckmvg,t1_ffcjopf,1579801475.0,"Where I worked the entrees are about $30. A $200 order is a dinner for 5 with an app, two salads, and two desserts. It takes maybe 5 minutes to grab everything and pack it up. The customer interaction takes another 5 minutes. 5% on $200 is $10 for roughly 10 minutes of work. I felt like that's fair compensation when I was doing togo orders. 

I guess if you want to go by percentage, I would do 10% on smaller orders and 5% on bigger ones. When you take care of a table for 5 you have to bring all of their food out, all of their drinks, prebus, refill, etc. With a togo order for 5 it's a one time effort."
personalfinance,ffcjx4e,t1_ffcivm9,1579801040.0,"You can read a lot about it on /r/financialindependence. The basic math is if you can live off $40K a year, you can retire as soon as you have $1 million. If you want to live off $80K, then $2 million. 

With a $200K income, you can pay off all your debt in 2-3 year. Save another $100K a year for the next 10-12 years. Throw in expected market growth and you're close to $1.5-2 million. 

You can move to a low cost of living area when you retire. There are plenty of nice cities in the midwest where your money does more. Having a kid and wanting to provide a college education for the kid throws off the math a bit. Being frugal even when you make 6 figures help.

The cost of the restaurant matters too. I have no issue tipping $10 on $10 at Dennys if the server is fantastic. I don't exactly want to tip $50 on $50 at a place that's featured in restaurant week. $15-20 tip is still a great tip in this situation."

When do you hope to retire? Do the math from that point of view. You can make educated guesses on returns. Do the math.
