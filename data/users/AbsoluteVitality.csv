nutrition,fdkh46b,t3_eluhbn,1578503753.0,"IT can be overdone, but it is difficult and costly to over eat fruit.

For example a half a pound of blueberries and a glass of water is less calories than 12 oz coca cola.

Normally you would drink that coke with a burger and fries. Coming close to 1500 cals or so.

Eating a 1/2 pound of blue berries your gonna feel pretty full / tired of eating the same thing."
