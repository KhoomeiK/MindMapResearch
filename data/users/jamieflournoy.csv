Municipal governments don't have lots of extra money to build things that aren't actually needed yet.

Also, preventing problems doesn't get you re-elected as surely as solving giant problems that everybody agrees need to be solved does. It's very hard for an elected government to do a good job *proactively*, because they have to persuade people to pay taxes for something that hasn't gone wrong yet.

Also, there's the waste question, meaning that if you predict something will be needed and then spend a lot of money on it and it turns out not to be needed, kiss your political career goodbye.

The part that's actually caused by bad government is the thing that is built that was useful, but mysteriously goes 10x over budget and the money is mysteriously hard to account for once it's gone. #stadium

(Rich countries and rich municipalities are an exception to this because they can afford to build prestige projects that aren't actually necessary, because it makes people happier than the amount of unhappiness that comes from paying taxes.)

tl;dr: Government is reactive because taxpayers are stingy. It's not the gubmint's fault."

AskReddit,fc11axl,t1_fc008mv,1577305410.0,"White families in the U.S. moved out to the suburbs just as the civil rights movement was causing them to have to send their kids to school that were becoming racially integrated.

Whites hated the idea of living near black families, hated the idea of their children going to school with black kids, and hated the idea that their taxes might be used to pay for something that might benefit black people.

Implementing de jure segregation in a world where explicit racism was illegal resulted in laws that segregated housing by economic class and job opportunities by distance, with employers relocating to be closer to white workers. (See the book ""The Color of Law"" for examples of how municipalities found legal means to discriminate despite federal laws against explicit racism, and some means that were ruled explicitly racist and thus unconstitutional only after years of being in force and harming black communities.)

The legacy of this is the ongoing ""my taxes shouldn't benefit lazy, uneducated, uncultured thugs and junkies"" conservative political stance, which sounds like classism but was (and largely still is) a racist dog whistle.

That's why conservatives fight against transit. To them, it's socialism, and the thing that's worst about socialism to them is that their taxes might benefit ""The Wrong Sort of People"", upon whom those expenditures are wasted. (Also, *using* transit  themselves would cause them to be physically near The Wrong Sort of People, which is something that terrifies and disgusts them.)"
AskReddit,fc0zyi2,t1_fc0h0sh,1577304319.0,"That was followed by suburbanization, though. You could get to city and town centers by rail, and in many cases still can (but with a shitty schedule and unappealing ticket prices), but vast numbers of people moved out to the suburbs and were not followed by rail transportation or even much bus coverage.

That suburbanization flow is reversing, with more middle class folks moving into town. So now instead of transit being a thing that people think of as a thing thatonly poor people use, it may become seem as more of a twee thing that only city hipsters and yuppies use, with poor folks forced to take long but rides or to drive crappy cars from way out in the burbs to where the jobs are."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fbycdkk,t1_fbxpgum,1577213376.0,">it’s just a fact that renting is much cheaper both in the short and long-run. 

It's not a fact; it's a prediction. I've read Freakonomics, and I just read the article you linked to, and they don't support what you're claiming here. Even one historical example of someone making more money by buying a house then they would have by renting that house proves that not to be true.

A calculation of predicted ROI by buying vs renting includes a lot of variables that are predictions of future market conditions: your future wages, future wages of the general population, future similar house prices in your area, future Fed interest-rate decisions, future housing construction, future natural disasters, future tax rates, and on and on. There's almost none of that that is under your control. You have to guess at all of those future values and then make your bet, and your results may or may not match other people's results, or historical averages.

(The CNBC article you linked to talks about whether it's a good decision to rent or buy *on average*, in certain cities, right now. By definition, that they are saying that their claim only holds true *if* future market behavior matches historical average market behavior.)

As a result, it's impossible to say that renting or buying is always the right decision. No one can know that. No one can even say that it's definitely going to turn out to be the right decision to rent or buy a single property at a single time. You can only say that it's the best choice you can make based on the information you have and the *assumptions that you are making*, and your appetite for risk."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fby65h0,t1_fbxsu8r,1577209035.0,">once everything is said and done, you will have more money owning a similar property than renting it

That's only true if certain assumptions continue to be true about the relationship between rents, mortgage rates, housing prices, and wages.

If housing prices go up, and rents track with that, then buying a house can be a better decision.

However, there are combinations of values that you can plug into the buy vs rent ROI calculation that make buying turn out to be a worse decision, and usually those values are things are predictions of future market behavior, meaning you cannot control them.

As just one example, a whole lot of people bought houses in the early 2000s and then lost everything a few years later when house prices suddenly dropped.

Granted, real estate bubbles don't burst every year, but the way that a huge number of people wound up in financial ruin at the same time was by assuming that buying a house was always better than renting."

No, it isn't. It's only throwing away money *if* house prices go up *and* you have to pay market-rate rent *and* that rent rises as quickly as or more quickly than house prices. That is not always the case.

There are rent vs. buy calculators for a reason."
