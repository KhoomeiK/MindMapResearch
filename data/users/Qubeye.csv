funny,feo9ua5,t3_epywxx,1579297138.0,"For all the people asking why it isn't called ""False Positive"" and ""False Negative"" instead of Type I/II, it's because the picture is actually wrong.

In statistics, Type I and Type II errors have to do with interpreting the data set incorrectly. Example:

Normal Value of Thing is 5, let's say.

You collect a huge number of values of Special Group. Your results vary from 2 to 20. You do a bunch of math, and find that your mean is 9.

Now is where Type I and Type II errors come into play.

If you work the numbers and you use the wrong Standard Deviation, you could either conclude that this is still ""normal"", or that it is ""abnormal.""

If it's abnormal (let's say 95% of your Special Group falls between 6-12), and you capture *too much* data in your math (like you went even further and captured 99% of your data), you will conclude that it *is* normal, when it is *not* normal. You accept the null hypothesis (""This group is not unusual"") when you should *not*. That is a Type II error.

Now, on the *other* hand, let's say that it is normal (95% of your Special Group falls between 4 and 12 this time). If you capture *too little* data (you only capture 90% instead of 95%), you come to the conclusion that the range is 7-10, outside of your ""norm"" of 5, therefor you reject the null hypothesis, which is also wrong. This is a Type I error.

There are lots of other ways to come to a Type I/II error, but this is a very broad explanation.

politics,fe4g0k0,t1_fe2oekg,1578858907.0,"An economist friend of mine explained it like this:

The idea of low employment creating wage-demand from employees doesn't exist because migration is extremely easy now. Not migration as in moving from one country to another, or state to state, or even city to city. We simply have so many people that even if only 1% of the population is unemployed, there's a very high chance that *low wage jobs* can simply ""find someone else."" Therefor, low employment *only* benefits highly specialized jobs, in theory.

The problem with *that* is because higher-paying industries tend to be high-profit, high-margin, it might ultimately be cheaper to simply move the whole company than to pay higher wages to a particular group. The company chooses their employees, instead of employees choosing their company.

I'm paraphrasing slightly, but pretty much we have so many people in the world that it's not hard to find someone else to flip burgers on the low end, and it's easier to ship your entire company to India on the high end."

Literally adding them without subtracting them at the end. If a jobs report says +20,000 jobs, and there were 40,000 temp jobs added for one month, that's a *loss* of 20,000 fucking jobs in the economy, but they won't say that."
