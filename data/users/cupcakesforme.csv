AmItheAsshole,ff5ye7q,t3_erq0il,1579614260.0,NTA. Maybe try going to the state police. This is absolutely ridiculous that the local police won't do anything. Good lord. Best of luck to you

AmItheAsshole,ff50d2n,t3_erijgn,1579576849.0,NTA. Your sister is rude and acting like she is entitled. You asked them for help canceling YOUR wedding. I say call first thing and get your money back
cats,ff22wkr,t3_er3s9y,1579492336.0,Love and light around you both. It's so difficult for us pet parents. I lost my kitty 9 months ago. She was also born in 2006 . Thinking of you
Genealogy,fepg5gu,t1_fepg1ht,1579319661.0,I'm gonna ask my mom 🤷🏻‍♀️ as far as we both know she is full blooded sisters
Genealogy,fepf0mb,t1_fepefmc,1579318864.0,This particular aunt is not the mother of said cousin. The aunt that did the DNA is my mother's half sister so her DNA makes sense to me but my cousins does not. I wonder if it's possible for her to not be a full blooded sibling of my mom 🤔🤔

AmItheAsshole,fejkph5,t3_ep7g5h,1579178148.0,Oi. Ok so NTA . If she wants a short veil she can get one. I'm totally with you on this. It's not like you can sew it back together. Stand your ground  and don't let her ruin this piece of family history.
AmItheAsshole,fegh5yc,t3_eorgy9,1579092612.0,NTA. He sounds like a huge turd. Please pass along my deepest condolences to your sister. I can't even imagine what she is going through. I would definitely call him on his awful behavior
