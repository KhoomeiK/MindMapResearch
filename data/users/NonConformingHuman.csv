How close are you to an age where you can move out?
Do you financially depend on them?
Have you ever brought the topic up in conversation to the extent that you could feel out where they stood?

Do you have any other support elements in your life in case  they take it badly?

In any case I would sit them both down and let them know you have something serious to chat about, tell them firmly and lovingly that you have decided to transition and that you would like them to use different pronouns and your new name_____Do not give them any impression that you are unsure.

Offer them reading materials or suggest that they check out sub-reddits on the topic.

Then allow them time to process this new information, they may act weird for a few weeks....

AgeGap,fcl13ik,t3_ehmcq1,1577737520.0,"-Being widowed young - Yes this is likely given that women usually live longer

- Social acceptance- given the 35 and 56 I doubt this will be a huge issue, I would not worry so much.

- Family acceptance- Tell them in a joyful manner that you met someone special and do not make a deal out of the age difference at all, how will they even know to make it ac ward if you do not draw attention to it?

- Health disparity and starting a family  - The first point I want to make here is having a baby when a relationship is just starting no matter the ages of the two people involved can be difficult and present a whole new set of challenges.

Make sure you both want a kid equally, and discuss ahead of time how having one will change the dynamics of your relationship.

If you have a kid more or less right away ( while you still can ) when the kid is 10 your man will be 70 so playing catch in the backyard and going on light hikes will be just fine, but being a football tackling coach and long steep hikes will likely be out.
