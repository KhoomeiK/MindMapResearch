cats,fepgdwi,t1_fepdeyt,1579319829.0,Thank you!
cats,fepgdaa,t1_fepe9ui,1579319817.0,"Thank you! It’s only one of them, which is confusing to me. I just wipe down the one with a washcloth and send him on his way."
AmItheAsshole,feb2uj3,t3_eo2gpg,1578954952.0,"While I did opt in for law enforcement, it was not for criminals to be caught. It was actually so genealogists could help solve John/Jane Doe cases.

For instance, the case of Pillar Point Doe. They were targeted for being possibly transgender and were beaten, strangled, and stabbed. Because of people opting in, they were identified this year (name hasn’t been released). Because of the opt ins, this poor kid isn’t buried in an unknown plot any longer and are going home to their family. That is why I opted in."
AmItheAsshole,fe88k1w,t3_eo2gpg,1578923730.0,"NTA. You’re 24! 

Also, there’s this website called GEDMatch that lets you upload your DNA and can compare it to other companies like Ancestry. And if you opt in, you can help law enforcement solve cold cases."
college,fe68cyi,t1_fe685rj,1578884019.0,It’s really hard. Hats off to you for being able to do it too.

college,fdf72ze,t3_ektstk,1578354817.0,"I have really bad social anxiety so I did not think I was going to make it. Well, I just completed my first semester with mostly A’s, met a lot of great friends, and am friends with a few professors. I kicked anxiety’s ass!"

cats,fco8gh2,t1_fcnq41a,1577826096.0,"She’s doing okay. The baby has his own room rn and she just sits outside it and looks at him (I left it open until she hissed at him). 

I’m being very cautious though."
AskReddit,fcm31st,t1_fcm2i5k,1577762941.0,Yes! I love hearing that one. I have a really old vinyl and hearing Billie Jean by Michael Jackson is an experience that i highly recommend.
AskReddit,fcm2fza,t1_fclp41j,1577762483.0,I love Queen! What is your favorite song to listen to on vinyl?

AmItheAsshole,fcm21bi,t3_ehmsme,1577762178.0,"NTA. 

That is YOUR child. Your parents did not want him and gave him to you. Your family needs to shut tf up.

However, I do believe you should tell him. It is going to be hard, for sure, so you may need to look into counseling for both of you. 

Much love to you and your family."
cats,fclx99q,t1_fcltce5,1577758703.0,"Thank you! Enzo (the baby) is in an extra bedroom and Dip (older one) has free run of the house. She sat outside the bedroom door for a while, got bored, wanted food, and is now asleep."
cats,fclx6qi,t1_fcluo9q,1577758653.0,The kitten is pretty chill. He’s not needy. Dip is very playful for a nine year old cat too.
cats,fclx4np,t1_fcluud9,1577758614.0,I wish! Catnip doesn’t really affect Dip.
cats,fclx3d6,t1_fcluudy,1577758589.0,"Dip (older one) did see the new kitten and hissed at him and meowed but no batting. The kitten was in a carrier. Right now, the kitten is sleeping in an empty bedroom and Dip is sleeping in the living room. 

I rubbed a towel on the kitten and put it in the living area for Dip to smell on."
