SelfAwarewolves,fgfgy0p,t3_ey21dk,1580738431.0,"Um. Hello? Do you know how antisocial Americans have gotten? Would be nice to just group up and roomy-up with some people on a minimum wage job, but nobody gives a fuck. Plus the $7 “living wage” hasn’t been changed much in the last decades while the cost of living has skyrocketed. Sanders idea of a “living” wage is to create a standard wage that could support the basic needs of the common American. Who wouldn’t be behind that? The idea is good. The economic and financial implications would need to be straightened out. In the future there will be more stuff like this unfortunately cause eventually automation and AI will take over. UbIs would need to take in effect so people could atleast be sustained. View it how you want. I for one support some form of ideas like the one is presented, “living wage” now, UBIs in the future (Andrew Yangs main campaign is to try and buy Americans with a free $1000 a month, which is a good idea once you hear his approach, however; it’s too soon)."

It’s another thing that I know she would fucking love and I want to go hard in that. Imagine fucking her in her ass and having that sweet pink pussy just staring at you as you play and finger it seems super fun. Can’t explain it my dude. However eating ass is kinda nasty. The slut I find that wants me to do that can find someone else. I won’t do that. I won’t eat shit. My idea of eating ass is literally biting the butt cheeks and that......IS FUCKING GREAT!!!!

Games,ffc9n36,t1_ffbd30r,1579794689.0,"Hahaha fragile. I am actually dreading the Little Mermaid level. In KH2 it was absolute hell. the singing and dancing from Sora to beat a level was too much. If I was a Heartless I would attempt to kill everyone for the sake of making them shut up for just a second. I call it 15 years cause pretty much those were mini side games that were important to the story but in the end mini side games. It was a drawn out release. Kept saying it is coming out, oh wait no it not, it’s coming out NOW! Wait no it not. It’s like it was just yanking our chain and for fucks sake I am not a dog. You yank my fucking chain enough times and I’ll want to kill you. This game seriously pissed me off. Now I am a lot older and to be honest the only reason I actually really like KH was because of the other characters not actually associated with Disney. The Disney characters were more like a light filler in between worlds, excluding Donald, Mickey and Goofy. If I do play ( probably, most likely) I will be dreading seeing how gay Sora became and how even lamer the Disney characters really are. I do not like the Disney part of it. But I do see it’s purpose. KH2 became fun till like almost midway through the game. So I expect the same thing from KH3. Fuck I am gonna go buy it but I am not gonna be happy about it. To me it took way to long. Assholes giving us Nintendo DS games for the story like a fucking joke. Here’s KH on DS you dicksuckers! Get it? No. Okay. I’m sure they had their reasons but it seriously pissed me off. That’s why it was insulting. That’s why I will play KH in complete anger. It’s my reason and your not changing my mind.
