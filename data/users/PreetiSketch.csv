apexlegends,fff1i9w,t3_et8dt8,1579873120.0,Maybe it's a mask? It looks similar to his face.
SmallYTChannel,ffeme0e,t1_ffembev,1579854330.0,It's great!! You should continue to use it!
SmallYTChannel,ffelnyd,t3_et5gcy,1579853348.0,"I've got to say that I really like your intro and outro. Especially the outro. It's very clever and hilarious to watch!! Others have mentioned the audio lol so I won't do that. Maybe you could add some graphics here and there to emphasise something you or your friends are saying. If there's a funny moment or any other emotion you could exaggerate it using graphics which could add more interest to your video.

Besides that you've done a great job! Good luck for your future videos!"
apexlegends,ff8rohg,t1_ff8rjvm,1579693393.0,No problem and thank you!! Im glad you like it lol. I'll for sure make more. Just need to think of a good way to draw it!!
apexlegends,ff8rdrl,t1_ff8o7b0,1579693018.0,Lol I might try and come up with something!
apexlegends,ff8qoft,t1_ff8qeab,1579692100.0,"This is what Respawn said on Twitter. So I believe this includes the rewards. 

""We are aware of an issue causing Challenges to not properly display. While we have a server patch planned to go live early next week to fix the issue, note that your progress is still counting and rewards earned through the Event Challenges will be awarded retroactively."""
apexlegends,ff8nqi0,t3_es9o9m,1579687795.0,They are still be tracked. You can see your challenges in game. They're on the left side when you press the map. We should get the rewards once the bug is fixed I believe.
apexlegends,ff8nnem,t3_es9wcy,1579687664.0,The Devs said we'll get them once the bug is fixed. The points you've been getting still count. You just can't see the track yet.
WattsonMains,ff7kv5a,t3_eryqao,1579651956.0,"""Quantum Lazer Mechanics"" according to the Devs!"
apexlegends,ff71q08,t1_ff70shs,1579639381.0,Oh I really hope they make one for her!
apexlegends,ff6w7nq,t1_ff6vdqe,1579636155.0,I wouldn't get it on both!! That's too much money. I only play on PS4 and since you pretty much have them all on there maybe it's worth getting it on console. But I guess it depends on which one you play more on too.
apexlegends,ff6pfsf,t1_ff6p921,1579632131.0,Lol we only live once so why not!!
apexlegends,ff6otbo,t1_ff6omdx,1579631758.0,I have all Wattson's skins including exclusives besides her orange legendary. I can't remember the name lol. But it's Wattson. So I couldn't help myself!! But after looking at this skin. It's probably my favourite so far.
apexlegends,ff6okkk,t1_ff6ofrg,1579631610.0,And absolutely you should!! It's so pretty and shiny. It's worth it (meanwhile my bank is crying in the background..).
apexlegends,ff6jweh,t1_ff6jnyw,1579628774.0,We've played a lot of games together and since we're long distance it really does help!! We haven't tried diamond yet and to be honest I'm kind of.scared to lol. I'm pretty sure players there are on a completely different level to Platinum. But thank you!!  I'm glad you like the art too!!
apexlegends,ff6j6it,t1_ff6is9f,1579628337.0,Thank you!! I have a huion tablet too but I use Photoshop. I used to use the Wacom Intuos and it didn't have a screen but my current one does as it's so much nicer.
apexlegends,ff6415a,t3_erv0tk,1579618588.0,I really like this! The little ski pass is a nice touch lol.
apexlegends,ff5yf6z,t1_ff5ydvn,1579614282.0,No problem! I'm glad I could help.
apexlegends,ff5xrt2,t3_eruouz,1579613731.0,I have the same problem. I believe Respawn said that the challenges still count towards getting the rewards. We can't see it because of some weird bug but once they fix it we should get them!
apexlegends,ff5x64d,t1_ff5wkyp,1579613215.0,That's slightly morbid lol. But I do like your idea! Seeing Arthur in game and actually having a use than just being an accessory in the character selection screen would be cool.
apexlegends,ff5watc,t3_ertyr4,1579612407.0,Don't kill Arthur :(
GirlGamers,ff5vrdm,t3_ertrlp,1579611908.0,"Hi everyone!

I hope you're all having a wonderful day. I'm Preeti and I run a gaming YouTube channel. Apex Legends and Monster Hunter World is what I'm currently focusing on as well as making speedpaint videos. 

In most recent video I actually tried to combine a speedpaint with gameplay. I'm not sure if it works but it sure did take a while to make but it was also fun too lol. 

We actually managed to reach Diamond in Apex so I combined that with a Wattson fanart I drew. 

https://youtu.be/k6xGwn6tIE8

I'd appreciate it if you decided to take a look. Thank you!"
apexlegends,ff5le7o,t3_ers4x1,1579598562.0,Lool you made me laugh. I like it.
apexlegends,ff3yngd,t1_ff3ya4h,1579551721.0,Oh it could be! She did have a twitch prime skin before though so I would have thought they'd go through all legends before repeating legends.
apexlegends,ff3vph9,t1_ff3vf84,1579549882.0,I looked at all the skins she currently has and it wasn't there. So I thought maybe it was a new one. But it's possible it could just be part of a new batch of items that might be added to the loot pool lol.
apexlegends,ff2zndt,t1_ff2ypdz,1579529670.0,"I noticed that too. Especially with Wattson and if you crouch, her interception pylon takes up a lot of the screen. Sometimes the weapons on legends backs get in the way when you're aiming too."
apexlegends,ff2xa0t,t3_erd4qo,1579527547.0,"I actually liked the third person game mode. Typically third person point of views in games are my favourite since you can see the character. Like you, I like that you can see the skins. I have so many Wattson skins and actually being able to see how they look in game is really cool to see. Although, I wish the new one was in the store before this game mode so I could have used that skin. But, I liked that we could see the way the legends move and interact with things too.


As you said, the game mode wasn't perfect. The legends felt heavy to move initially but I kind of got of got used to it I guess. I felt like with some of the weapons you couldn't aim properly too. It was like you were directly shooting at an enemy but they weren't taking any damage. Also, how the camera changed to first person when a teammate ran through you got quite annoying. Especially when you're in a tight spot and trying to shoot enemies."
apexlegends,fexfp9d,t3_equfhp,1579430232.0,Respawn said that all the challenges you complete for the event are still adding up. So once they fix it you'll get your rewards.
WattsonMains,fewwi0v,t1_fevu4r9,1579420571.0,Loool thank you!! We haven't really played ranked much and decided very late in the season to try and get to diamond. But I'm so glad we managed to do it!
apexlegends,feww3cx,t1_fewdxlx,1579420394.0,It really is! It brings you so much closer together too.
apexlegends,fev7z5e,t1_fev6jvd,1579394277.0,Lol the whole team was down and my teammates were still alive so if I did die from doing that it would have been ok I guess. But they had a gold knock down so I thought why not attempt to finish with a finisher!
apexlegends,fernusa,t1_fermscy,1579356268.0,Damn it I forgot about that. That's the mode I'm most looking forward to too!!
apexlegends,feqq089,t3_eqeisq,1579344704.0,So pretty!! We just need this skin in the store so much sooner lol.
aww,feovucm,t1_feorymt,1579306511.0,No problem!!
aww,feorwmr,t1_feon1ul,1579304593.0,I haven't given anyone an award before. You're the first! Thank you for your kind words too. That's so nice of you and such a beautiful thing to think of. Thank you so much and I hope you have a wonderful weekend too.
aww,fenvguw,t1_fenpg6k,1579291518.0,Oh you just made me tear up. Both of my dogs passed away within the past 3 years. I had them for 10 years too. It really does hurt to lose them and people who've never had pets don't understand and you're so right. I'm so sorry for your loss though. They'll forever be in our hearts! RIP beauties.
NewTubers,fenqipa,t3_eq1p8v,1579289312.0,"Hi, I really appreciate you doing this and I'd really like your feedback. 

I run a gaming channel which focuses on Apex Legends and Monster Hunter World currently. My videos show my gameplay but also news related to the games. 

I'd consider this video below to be my best so far. I found it very fun to make and also the footage, I think personally, is more entertaining. It was easier to add other effects to add more interest too, I guess.

The video is gameplay of Apex Legends where I played with my coworkers. One of which isn't much of a gamer but the other is.

Thank you again! It's very kind of you to take the time to do this!"
apexlegends,fef1gfz,t1_feez070,1579045938.0,No I believe it's not out yet. It should be out in the store but we'll have to wait until next week when the store rotates. So long :(
WattsonMains,fedmx6y,t1_fedhy4z,1579015426.0,Ah no!! Papa's proud of all Wattson mains. I appreciate the thought though lol! Thank you.
WattsonMains,fed4qsq,t3_eoj39h,1578998786.0,Papa would be proud of you
apexlegends,fed3nbr,t1_fed3arc,1578997180.0,Oh my bad. I miss read what you said. I believe it's the Voidwalker skin you're thinking of.
apexlegends,fed2wlp,t1_fed1v6u,1578996080.0,"I don't think it's Wraith but it's strange that she wasn't in the trailer at all. I'm pretty certain that is Wattson though because of the frame and the pose. 

The skin itself looks like the new one in the trailer, just with her face covered in the banner. In the trailer it shows her face. It's kind of strange lol."
apexlegends,fed0sp3,t1_fed0ipd,1578992961.0,I can't exactly rotate the camera in the trailer. I just wanted to point something out that some people might be interested in. As a Wattson main I am. I'm sorry you aren't.
apexlegends,fed0gxe,t1_fed0em0,1578992502.0,That's now it is in the trailer. There's not much I can do about the picture. You can tell it's Wattson from the pose and also that's one of her frames.
apexlegends,fecyz8n,t1_fecyy6r,1578990496.0,I think it was! I just never noticed lol.
apexlegends,fecywk8,t3_eoiikc,1578990399.0,Oh nice catch! I didn't know that!
apexlegends,feaiq8r,t1_feag9l5,1578949316.0,Gold rush duos!
apexlegends,feai96h,t3_eo9hs2,1578949096.0,Oh this is so nice!! You've done an awesome job!
apexlegends,fea9i5b,t3_eo99dg,1578945954.0,"I main Wattson and using her abilities can be quite tough. Remember she is primarily a defensive legend but you can make her more offensive.

Use her fences! If you think the chances of someone coming from a certain area is unlikely, I would still block it off. You can never be sure and you'll know if someone shoots your fence down or walks through it so it's helpful to know their position. Using them to block doors and tunnels is effective. But you can use them anywhere. 

One thing I like to do is put a fence through Wraith portals. If there is an enemy Wraith, it's super helpful and gives you the advantage if their team goes through it. You can also use it to block off the end of a Wraith's portal who's on your squad. It's a good way to set up a trap too. 

For her ultimate, put it behind cover if you can! Also you can use it as cover if an enemy comes close. I believe it has 150 health so it could save you if you needed the extra damage absorption! It also charges up your fences in seconds and recharges your shield. It's always good to keep ultimate accelerates on you too. Especially late game. Using one will charge up your ultimate immediately.

I too am still learning to use her more effectively. Also trying to actually make use of her fences more lol. Sorry for the long comment! I thought I'd say a few things lol. Good luck and have fun maining her!"

apexlegends,fcyapyt,t3_eje913,1578077267.0,Personally I'd say the person who dibbed. To be honest I hate when people take it when you have dibbed something. It seems disrespectful and the ability to dib is there for a reason.

My channel is gaming focused. On Apex Legends and Monster Hunter World currently. I do draw everything for my channel and also have done a speedpaint video previously. I have intended to do more but infrequently due to my channel being mainly gaming focused.

Currently, it's not easy to tell what your channel is about so new viewers watching probably won't know what to expect from you or why they should sub in the first place. This is just my thoughts though!! Lol you might think different. But either way, you made a great attempt. Merry Christmas!"
