YAlit,feeqkem,t3_eopr93,1579039104.0,i'd love for a tv adaptation of the folk of the air trilogy! the setting is so vivid and i think the costuming especially would be very cool to see on the screen.
college,fedqc39,t3_eomjwv,1579017594.0,"i study a few days before tests, doing practice problems or going through pertinent vocab terms. generally i split up my time depending on whatever test comes first, but if there's something i think i need to study more i'll allocate more time for that subject. my study habits were a mess when i graduated high school so i've been trying to build them up lately and hopefully they improve! i am not human, but i'm also not allowed to tell you what i am."
college,fe5yyfi,t1_fe5vqqo,1578878062.0,i have a scholarship that covers my tuition but i have to pay almost 9k in room&board because for our first year my cohort is required to stay in the most expensive dorms on campus
college,fe5uqgh,t1_fe5uhvy,1578875387.0,yeah the amount of money college costs is crazy here not only does tuition/room&board cost an excessive amount of money but they find ways to squeeze even more from us whether it be through the textbooks or through things like having to pay for graduation
college,fe5u62k,t1_fe5u3ry,1578875016.0,america lol where else ?
books,fcwb4h4,t3_ej2thj,1578021320.0,i read between the world and me by ta-nehisi coates! it was the perfect way to start off the year. his prose is so evocative; i cried more than once while reading it
books,fcm87bp,t3_ehv22w,1577766820.0,ready player one; the whole book is built on cultural references and 99.99% of them went way over my head. it was an ok read but i think i missed out on the majority of the enjoyment in relation to that book.
YAlit,fclh36g,t3_ehsouz,1577747637.0,give it a shot you may just be surprised
college,fck1rz5,t3_ehjah8,1577713961.0,yeah lol i miss having a structured schedule and while it's been great being able to do nothing except read all day being around my family is a special slow torture
YAlit,fcirp2u,t3_ehcpnt,1577668227.0,"her writing is incredibly juvenile (constant repetition, way too many uses of 'male' or 'mate,'  too much growling and/or purring) and all the sex scenes between her characters where their orgasms cause distant planets to implode is beyond annoying. i've definitely read fanfic with much better diction"
books,fc7qqr9,t3_eghb08,1577516241.0,i once found half a postcard in one of my books; i think the picture might have been of the swiss alps? i can't remember exactly but it was really cool! and i love the atmosphere of libraries in general it's so nice being surrounded by fellow avid readers

goodreads,fc5qss0,t3_egcoa4,1577463930.0,sounds fun let's do it
books,fc5o0zs,t1_fc4utwr,1577462394.0,"honestly for me it was actually logging every book i read, but i love gr because it allows you to track your progress and update it with any thoughts/notes you have -- which you can do on ereaders, but i mainly read physical books. it's also great when i want to find more books (not that i need to add any more to my tbr but) because of all of the list functions and the ""if you like this, you may also like these"" section"
goodreads,fc2a5i0,t1_fc29v0d,1577348082.0,i just checked and i'm pretty sure on desktop you'll have to go to view shelf and click the x next to the book that you want to remove
goodreads,fc29tgj,t3_efspvt,1577347538.0,"are you on desktop or mobile? if you're on mobile, click on the shelf button and at the very bottom (underneath all your shelf options) there should be an option to remove the book from all your shelves. i'd have to check desktop since i don't usually use it."
goodreads,fc21uqj,t1_fc21h23,1577337102.0,thank you!
books,fc0svf7,t3_efjepy,1577298890.0,a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
books,fc0rtec,t3_efe5j4,1577298119.0,"2019 was the first year i properly utilized goodreads; i set my reading challenge pretty low because i expected to be too busy to read due to college but in the back of my mind i wanted to hit 100 and i did! i read pretty much non-stop this year and found some of my favorite books ([the song of achilles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11250317), [aristotle and dante discover the secrets of the universe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12000020), [red, white, & royal blue](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41150487) -- i'm sure you can see a theme here -- [a ladder to the sky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40400269), [more happy than not](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19542841)). all in all it's been a pretty great year for me reading-wise, and here's to a similarly successful 2020!"
