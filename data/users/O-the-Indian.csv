The probability is with every fan base. When you take all the “fans” of any group, most of them have never actively participate in the group themselves and just watch because it’s popular.

There are tons of people on this sub that try to avoid spoilers, so they rely on the tags. I think only spoilers from parts 5 and up should be tagged, yes even part 5. Imo part 5 is the most spoilable part with its twists."
