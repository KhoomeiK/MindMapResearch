if you MUST be dishonest with your parents - tell them you need to see a doctor for a rash or something. i wouldn't keep it quiet but i can understand.

when i was diagnosed with depression at 15 it hurt my parents but specifically my mom because she had dealt with it at that point for 30 years and didn't want it to happen to me. it is extremely distressful."
depression,fdmmuvs,t1_fdmm3kz,1578556039.0,"It should be, but this website itself is a hivemind echo chamber where questions aren't allowed.

I made a post here that got like 2k upvotes about my experience with the suicide hotline. I said basically to not call them if you are merely having suicidal thoughts, only if you are in immediate danger and need emergency services because they will call the police. They deleted it.

Everyone except for literally 2 or 3 people agreed, I didn't discourage calling hotlines, just not the national suicide hotline, and I made the disclaimer that you should contact Good Samaritans instead. It wasn't fucked up at all, just talked about how a call to the suicide hotline fucked my life up because I got hospitalized when I was not a threat to myself.

Ironically enough, the top comment on that thread was about how it's all about liability. Which is probably why the mods delete this stuff. Liability."
depression,fdmmkwz,t3_em6g27,1578555710.0,"seems like anhedonia, although anhedonia is a main symptom of depression and may be depression. could be something else though, i'm not really well educated with diagnoses

you don't have to be gloomy to be depressed, i have months where i think about killing myself every day and i cry and my heart hurts, but also months where i just don't care, like i can't even feel good or bad things

please go see someone and take immediate action. i have severe depression and it ruined my life and you sound like you have potential, so kill it before it lays eggs. when it's bad, it is really, really bad.

as for your friend... it's hard. my friend is going through heroin withdrawals - or trying to - currently, and it's so hard to help him when he's in agony and i'm not strong. like i don't think i can help him honestly... it sounds selfish but you can be there and focus on yourself at the same time, just don't let him/her drain you. if you can only save yourself, you know... you are not a bad person if you can't handle it.

i wish you the best and hope this is just a slump, and nothing serious"
depression,fdmmal8,t3_em6com,1578555376.0,"to me it is, and i don't say this to be negative, but it just feels like purgatory. like nothing is fucking happening. 

honestly the way it feels to me and i am not moping around or exaggerating when i say this, it's really how i feel, is that you could stick me in prison for a day and give me a ticket to disneyland and i would feel the same both days. like whatever the fuck's happening just does not matter. sex, school, the gym, video games, drugs. just pointless. unless it is anxiety inducing, in which case i'm fucked.

it sounds like you may have ""anhedonia"" but may not be depressed. i'm not a professional so i'm not sure how you could have such a severe case of a main symptom of depression while not having depression but it might be possible. 

i am wishing the best for you, and that this is a slump you can get over."
depression,fdmlqse,t3_em6b7c,1578554739.0,"I myself think that I'm the exception to recovery and that I will commit suicide, but I wouldn't want to say that someone could be like that and create an echo chamber of negative shit here. I just think they don't want things to go south."
depression,fdml85i,t1_fdmjmsp,1578554128.0,"Yeah this is me.

Do you have any drive? My problem is that I want to do things but just can't. Go to the gym, don't give a fuck. Go to class, don't give a fuck. Watch a movie, don't give a fuck. I tried to get into routines of these things but there was just something holding me back.

Like I have something that just prevents me from doing things even though I know I want to and need to do them, and it's not laziness. Do you have that issue?"
depression,fdmkmw2,t3_em40kf,1578553451.0,"I've gotten out of a 4 and a half year relationship with a girl, I'm 20, so it's like a quarter of my life, hurts a lot. I've been feeling a very distinct lack of touch.

I had lunch with one of my best friends today, I've known her for the same amount of time, she's single. We talked about this. I told her about how I would just want to ""Netflix and Chill"" with a woman but like... literally that's it... but you can't just do that with girl friends.

Of course I would love to do that with her, but no way would I ask. I want to hug her for more than one second but that's... 

Man I just want to lay on someone's lap and watch Death Note, no flirting, no touching, no fucking, can we just normalize this already?"
depression,fdmjhij,t3_em5w9m,1578552167.0,"Can you describe your mental state?

Right now it seems like you're upset. Does it feel like you have energy to do anything?"
