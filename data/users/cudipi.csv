trees,ffgl2iy,t3_eqn33q,1579908708.0,Hell yeah! I finally cashed mine in after about a year and it honestly felt like a second Christmas
MurderedByWords,ffcwpto,t1_ffctt50,1579808856.0,"Lol ok pud. You’re not worth debating because, based on your response and profile, you’re an incel or mgtow due to your girlfriend cheating on you and somehow think all women (or as incels put it, females) are awful creatures. You’re pretty gross, and I hope you get therapy. It’s adorable you think anyone will take you seriously but judging by the amount of downvotes you have throughout the site (yikes btw) no one does take you seriously.

Have a better day dude."
MurderedByWords,ffbtaqa,t1_ffbjjmv,1579781963.0,"Wow dude. I’m not even unpacking that one.

*: lol I figured you were an incel and holy shit your profile is full of gold “will I die if I drink while taking seven Xanax” lmfao you fucking noodle."
MurderedByWords,ffaups3,t1_ffan6rm,1579744927.0,"I know, which is why I don't use it anymore, among other reasons. Just because that site is worse doesn't mean this one's not bad."
MurderedByWords,ff9zuzy,t1_ff9z7hm,1579725034.0,"Sorry, it’s used for overweight women’s clothing so therefore it’s a commonplace word for big women. Men don’t have to worry about it at all because clothing sizes up to 56 inch waist are easily available in most department stores with no fluffy name for bigger sizes. For reference, a 56 inch waist is a size 24-26 in women’s or 3-4x. If men are bigger than that, they have big and tall stores which is about the equivalent to the word plus."
MurderedByWords,ff9ypwu,t1_ff9xydw,1579724367.0,"The article, and users in this thread, frames it as women insisting they be called gentler names because they can’t handle ridicule like men can when that is completely a non-issue. Clothing companies come up with these names, and therefore the term becomes commonplace in society. The article is shit, but because it shits on two demographics that Reddit loves to attack anyway, it’s eaten up as if it’s true."
MurderedByWords,ff9uhsp,t1_ff9s3si,1579721644.0,"There are literally plus size stores for that purpose. Big and tall stores don’t just cater to fat men so the name can be ambiguous. Also, most department stores cater to men up to a size 56 waist (3x) and no fluffy words are used to describe them while most women’s departments in the same stores are labeled as plus for the exact same measurements and I don’t see any women bent out of shape for it. If anything they’re thankful that at least their sizes are being sold and they don’t have to resort to men’s clothing. Plus, it’s a gentle descriptor added by the companies themselves, not women demanding this. I honestly have no idea what point you meant to make because it doesn’t hold water when you think about why things are this way.

Edit: also if you think plus is gentle but big isn’t then I have news for you buddy"
MurderedByWords,ff9jdxm,t1_ff98abv,1579714265.0,"It’s shitting on fat people, women in particular, which is prime meat for reddit to sink their teeth into and ridicule. This thread is an example of that."
MurderedByWords,ff9j5dm,t1_ff98gpe,1579714122.0,"Or it’s a label given by clothing companies that you all are putting far more importance on than it actually is.

*as I said in a previous comment- I mean downvote me cool but where the fuck else have you seen plus size labeling and where do you think it started. It’s like you all lose brain cells when you get a chance to pick on people you view as lesser."
MurderedByWords,ff9c1dq,t3_esa4sn,1579709538.0,"As I’ve seen my whole life, the only reason we even say it is because that’s what we’re labeled by clothing companies.

walmart,ff99j24,t3_es6kqw,1579707945.0,"Our SM told us that the dc won’t be sending trucks anymore unless they’re 100% full. Day stock is coming week 8, at least to our store, so I suppose it had something to do with that"

walmart,fen5410,t3_eq16hm,1579277168.0,Fuck that’s how it feels here. We’re all talking about which ones we’ll be putting in for and it honestly feels like the hunger games. I have associates talking about how they’re so excited because they think they’ll be a team lead and then I think about all of the people even i’m up against and can’t help but feel bad.
walmart,fen4qew,t3_epn30m,1579276929.0,"I’m so burnt out from the holidays and carrying my apparel DMs on my back. I have taken care of every single department due to DMs just deciding they don’t want to do anything because they receive no backlash or coaching. 


But if I don’t get their stuff done? I get yelled at. I’m treated as the head of the area and I’m not even an ASM because I don’t want the hours. If I do go to management about it I get told I’m not being a team player and I’m just so fucking over it. I finally have today to work in my own area after 4 months and I have no motivation at all. 


I’m sick of working my ass off taking care of everyone’s areas and trying to “make it right” just for it to fall off and redo it all again because the DMs refuse to maintain anything. 

I’m actively looking for other jobs so hopefully this won’t last too much longer because my body and my mental health cannot take it."
walmart,felpkt7,t3_eptnbh,1579227831.0,"The team lead test is so easy and is the exact same as the DM test. It asks you what you are likely to do in given scenarios and answer it from Walmart’s standpoint, not your own experiences. 

It also has you figure percentages in one question so make sure you remember how to do that (employee completes x amount of tasks out of x, which employee completed the highest percentage of tasks)"
politics,fel5bb9,t1_fek22vf,1579214378.0,Because they think that’s what liberals do. The GOP believes the same of democrats/anyone remotely progressive and this is their interpretation. Fucking idiots.

Please fucking do."
raisedbynarcissists,fehpc11,t3_eoxo6n,1579121182.0,I feel this. Any relationship I have ever had has been too long but it’s because I was too afraid to lose that validation because i didn’t have it anywhere else.  If someone gives me attention or affection I am hooked instantly and it’s sad.
Letterkenny,feex6di,t1_feeeqh9,1579043156.0,I say this at my job when some complain about when we work in teams and it honestly gets people on board to help
BlackPeopleTwitter,feekhv7,t1_feebmv3,1579035586.0,"It’s like everyone in this thread is going out of their way to deflect from the fact that a lot of people do this and it is a societal issue. If it weren’t we wouldn’t have so many movies/tv shows playing on the trope of

“I was a nerd in high school so now so I’m going to lie about what I do so those who peaked won’t make fun of me” 

People judge you whether or not they admit it out loud."
