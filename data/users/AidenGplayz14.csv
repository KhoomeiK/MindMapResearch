AskReddit,fecvsl8,t3_eodtd1,1578986591.0,"I only saw one, my best friend

He heard that he has autism but i don't care. But he was almost going instant depresion. So he didn't do anything for school and only got bad grades, which made him more deprest.

I was busy with school and therefore could not go to his house to help him with it. But when i did went there, 3 months later, he had knifes and crazy lighters and much cuts in his arm, but not deep. As if he wanted to die, but didn't want to die at the same time. 
He skipt school and now goes to a school for special needs kids where they learn nothing and he needs to go to a place to be entertaint. When i heard about that i began coming every week to help him with that, he now knows he f*ckt up his life and can't go back because he had done nothing to learn for 2 years and knew nothing. Only play games. He now relies on his parents to help him, and they do. They make sure he has fun, he can get games and sometimes that he gets money to go out and do something with his life.

I am supportive, his parents are suportive, almost everyone he knows is supportive for him but he still thinks he can't turn his life around and i feel really bad for him."
