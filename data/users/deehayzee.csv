relationships,fdrzggq,t3_emp7md,1578692012.0,"I have seen girls literally start to lose their minds on account of MIL's that are only a fraction of this intense, as it relates to power struggle over their man/son.  Not even exaggerating.  Even if he was ever to grow up, move out and get a job (and don't count on that if he's already 31), his mom is not going to ever go away.  And in my observations, women like this don't take kindly to having their man child taken from them by another woman.  If you make it that far, prepare for her to turn up the heat.  And when that happens, prepare for him to have very little ability to identify his mom playing the role of helpless victim.  And even if he does ultimately pick you and choose to distance himself from his mom, prepare for him to fold a few times first, returning him right back in a position directly under her thumb before being able to have the eyes to see he's being manipulated.   And even if you make it that far, you will almost definitely still have to deal with her in some capacity as often as holidays come around.  I know love makes you do crazy things but the path of least resistance here is definitely to choose one of the other 4 billion men in the world."

MaliciousCompliance,fdo9uka,t1_fdo4933,1578601380.0,"I'm not certain, but that still doesn't seem enforceable.   For the most part, this legalese seems to surround how the property can be built upon, demolished or zoned.  For example, they could create a covenant that says the covenantees are never to build a structure between the existing structure and property line.  Or, they could say the fence between the two properties must never be taken down and always maintained.  Or, they could say the property, which might currently zoned residential, must never be rezoned for commercial use.  I find it very hard to believe they could enforce a covenant like ""no alcohol shall be exchanged for money"" any more than they could enforce ""no one shall enter the building wearing the color purple"".  In other words, you can make a covenant to prohibit what the covenantee can or cannot physically do *to* the property (including rezoning), but it's very unlikely they can prohibit how they use it, so long as the manner by which it is being used is within the law.

Regardless though, it makes a funny tradition so why not..."
facepalm,fdnq4io,t3_em95u3,1578590728.0,"My first car was a POS jeep wrangler that I drove sans doors all summer.  If someone parked like this, I'd purposely center myself in the space so that they could not open their doors, and if they did, the first point of contact would be a massive steel step up bar that could only cause damage to their car and not mine.  I'd crawl out and feel like I'd done my part to make the world a better place.

It occurred to me later in life that perhaps their poor parking job was a trickle down effect of a person who was poorly parked on their other side, who had left prior to my arrival.  If that was the case, I do feel bad that they got caught in the crossfire.  Nevertheless, I broke the cycle."

I would actually go so far as to say, even if you had *video evidence*, the valet company still wouldn't acknowledge fault until you got police involved and they were forced to respond with pressure of legal action.  And even then, I would prepare myself for incredibly disappointing justice.  Without quantifiable damage to the car, my guess is that the only enforceable damages would be a check for mileage @ \~$0.55/mile.  Your best bet is to just self park at all costs."

CHIBears,fdew8pj,t1_fdduqpp,1578347900.0,"My gosh, this is so spot on.  I feel like I have kicking PTSD.  In the years leading up to 2018, I honestly started to feel like kickers in the NFL had almost outskilled what the creators of football had intended-- the same way that the creators of basketball didn't anticipate modern day NBA players when they set the rim height (and later the three point line).  In 2018 it felt like crossing center field guaranteed you 3 points as long as you held on to the ball.  Now I can't even relax during a PAT.  And it's the same for all teams.  Maybe I got too used to Robbie Gould.  Maybe it's because they moved back the PAT and those aren't as automatic as they used to be.  Maybe it's the same bias that makes you realize how many Jeep Wranglers are on the road after you start driving one yourself.  Honestly though, I just think the double doink broke me.

pics,fdeouqy,t1_fdeh07c,1578343531.0,"You paint with a very broad brush.  I mean this in the nicest way possible-- I think you should consider the following:

1. Elections are far more multidimensional than just climate change.  Even climate change isn't as binary as ""believing"" or ""denying"".  Yes, some people deny it's happening at all, but of the people who agree it's a problem, not everyone is in agreement on how to mitigate it and not everyone is in agreement on where it lies on the priority list.
2. Voter turnout, even in 2016, was better for people over 44 than under 44, and it was considerably better for people over 65 (baby boomers) than for people under 29.  This isn't your fault, but I mention it only because the excuse that baby boomers have time and the ""movers and shakers"" are too busy just isn't true.  The government has made it impossible for time to be an excuse as it relates to voting.  Older people simply make voting more of a priority than younger people.
3. Everyone thinks they're sane.  It's not a good habit to assume people who disagree with you are insane by default, even when it comes to climate change."

The issue in the McDentist case seems to be that they called it McDentist and not McDonalds Dentistry.  The restaurant chain definitely has an established history of adding “Mc” before words as an extension of their brands, such that anyone who hears “McDentist” immediately thinks of McDonald’s.  The same case could be (and probably has been) made by Apple with adding “i “ before words.  Maybe McDonald’s would have an issue with McDonald’s Accounting too, but they’d have a harder case to make than they did with McDentist."
