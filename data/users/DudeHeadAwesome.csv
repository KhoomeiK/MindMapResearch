AskReddit,ffdcdql,t3_esi1iu,1579817891.0,"Husband worked Kmart when closing. When it was announced the store jacked the prices up and put everything on sale. Staff started leaving real quick and he ended up being forced to be a janitor and walked out. 

But before he left he was working the electronics department, he and coworkers hid the good stuff so when the store hit 90% off they bought a few laptops and TVs for pennies."
