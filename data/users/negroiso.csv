I’m mid 20’s, finally without roommates and all. I decide to hit up that kinda web site. Match with this amazingly hot Hispanic mom. Perfect skin, perfect height at 5’2” or so to my 6’1”. She was all of maybe 95 pounds or so. We talk once or twice, somehow she agrees to come over.

She brings a bottle of wine I never had tried before, to this day I still drink it. I always remember her too. 

So, here’s the thing. Banging hot mid 40’s mom, like some beautifully fake tits, skin tight all over. We’re about to Netflix and chill, she’s poured a couple glasses of wine, and I’m just like “whatcha wanna watch” thinking what can I put on while I pound this into the ground. 

We browse through and I pick Forest Gump, hoping that I get to fucking her by the time the mom bangs the teacher. 

Well, we started messing around, she loved her tits being sucked and just kinda pulled them out. She sips her wine and I’m just over like a kid in a candy store sucking these titties.

By this point I’m rock hard. I’m trying to finger her and she somewhat is reluctant but eventually she just is like “you want this?” I’m like well fuck yeah! She says we can stay in the living room so we get naked and I’m over here just taking my pumps, stopping to play with some titties. About the part of the movie before it reveals Forest Gumps kid, she’s on the rug, facing me away from the Tv, looks up and sees the scene where he’s about to ask if his son is “like him”.

She just starts bawling. Like I’m humping her like a rabbit and she starts dead ass crying. I stop, but like a gentlemen keep my throbbing hot member in her. I ask what’s wrong. And she tells me that her son was special needs but had recently passed. I was like oh fuck, so I say “well maybe we should stop then” she says no, so of course I start getting at it again. The whole time tears just down her face and she’s feeling all over my chest while I’m pumping it. I stop again by this time the credits are rolling. She’s asking if I can finish. So I go 100mph to finish this up, she just like gets up. Gets dressed and heads out. 

Never saw her again. I still miss that lady."

About 8 months dropped 60 lbs. literally just eating less. I did a little cardio and workouts the first few weeks, sadly haven’t had mental motivation to do more from personal things.

However. It’s a testament that we are programmed incorrectly by those before us to “clear the plate” or eat all the carbs. Now I don’t even crave fast food, when I do eat it, I feel like shit so I avoid it. Dining out, I am now physically programmed to eat slower, and in turn eat less. While there’s still a lot left on my plate I still ate way more than I shsould have but I’m not clearing that plate out.

Retrain your eyes and stomach to what full is and it changes your life.

I won’t say I stuck to it every day. I got my shame cubbies in my kitchen with my sugar and carbs. But that’s literally like 1-2 days out of the week.

Also, small changes make a big difference. Park farthest from your office as you can, it’s easy calories and In the morning will get you woke up with that brisk walk, I walk around our kitchen table at work while my food heats up. Thats 3-5 minutes twice a day."

However I took a non traditional route, I felt I had to prove my worth by early to come in and staying late. Soon you realize you’re the idiot and everyone else funnels all the work to you and get the credit.

There’s a guy at my job like that now, like will not leave until 5pm and gets there at 7am. My boss is one of the most chill and doesn’t clock watch or even care what time or if you even show up. Your best asset to the company after you’ve proved a good candidate is availability. He still stays. Boss on most days is like “it’s quiet, get outta here at 2pm” my man, still there at 5pm.

I talked with him since he’s mid to late 50’s. I explained that boss an was genuine and you’re not getting browny points by just sitting here surfing the web till 5pm. He’s gone at noon and unless there’s a major fire, he presume you’re working or finishing up something to get to your life and family.

Leading up to this job, I found the less I did, or appeared to do, the more people presumed I was busy. I eventually delegated all my work out and just stick to reddit all day. Now I’m paid well, work for a great boss and I times out of ten when we get cut loose I don’t have that inner monologue saying “omg stay to show how good you are” and I head out. If the boss texts or something needs to be done at 10pm me and my counterpart have it covered."

I do like Microsoft pushing the platform to be agnostic, and more, well if you play our game we don’t care where ya did it. Obviously they just mean on PC or Xbox, since they got your money presumably for licensing the game and the OS/hardware for both, it’s silly for them not to.

It looks as if Sony is loosening up and saying, wellllll additional sales wouldn’t be bad, so let’s not spend tooo much money porting just to try and gauge the actual interests.

No doubt, from a business perspective is it a gamble still. If you do it in-house, you’re eating up development cycles on probably a ton of new IP to go back and get this past project working. If you send it out, you might get Warner Brothers level of Batman fuckups that to this day that game is jank. You ruin the brand, ip and future income on either platform.

While I hope for The Coalition level of attention to detail, benchmarking and goddamn amazing streamlining god code. I think we’re gonna be lucky to get an Fov slider and the ability to disable mouse smoothing.

Probably along the lines of Neir’s release where we just straight get a “compile for PC” exe with console assets and bugs and call it a day, then some benevolent genius graces us with a hack/patch that fixes all the things. We so hungry for good stories/titles that we take it anyway.

funny,fe8ujmc,t1_fe5s7fx,1578931103.0,"I think it’s because most shows today are just interns who become doctors. MASH also talked about many people having established practices back home before they were drafted, meaning they would have been older as well. I didn’t feel like they were out of age for their skill and experience. Throughout the show you hear them talk about years of X or Y experience in a certain procedure. 

Even as I get older now I’m like man those guys are young haha. I think at 36 I’m about the average age now on the show and I feel as if even in my own career field, while I have vast knowledge there’s still so much to learn and be trained on."

funny,fe4r1za,t1_fe4oxyq,1578861970.0,"I’m an 80’s baby too. I just recall mash being the theme song I had to go to bed to on weekends when we stayed at our grandparents. It came on at midnight after the 10pm news. I would be fast asleep anyway. As soon as the first strum came on I was out out. Wasn’t until 2009 I watched the entire series in my 20’s and realized what a great piece of television it is. In sadness because we are still dealing with a lot of the same issues locally and abroad. The show also had me thinking about my job or life too in a lot of episodes. They hit me hard with the finale and with Col. Blake. When those episodes hit, I had to take a breather. 

However, I love the 4077, the cast and writing was good, and to me, you felt like not only an observer but somebody part of the deployment. Even if you never had a voice.

It amazes me now that in 10, 100 and possibly 200 years people might be able to enjoy mash because of digital storage and being able to store things almost indefinitely. I mean it’s also scary sure, but wouldn’t it be baller if we could hear or watch a play from Shakespeare, hear Leonardo De Vinci’s audio notes or even have that solid proof that Edison was an asshole.

A lot of people say that Abraham Lincoln had a higher pitched voice than is portrayed in most recreations of him, and a downside of technology is the guy who recorded the Hindenburg disaster was said to of had a deep radio voice but the only recording that made it was recorded at the incorrect speed or on the wrong medium or something which gives him that distinctive tone.

I could be over thinking all the things too."

I just don’t watch TV or the things she is in. It blew my mind as well that she was 55. I forget so much that stars of my younger days age just like we do. I also forget about the amount of time passed. By the time a movie makes it to theaters it’s probably been 2-4 years since they filmed, by the time it hits BluRay or steaming another year. So almost 5 -m6 years since they set foot. Then add a series like Harry Potter or something to the mix, and if you’re late to the party as in me, I waited till all the movies were out to enjoy, then I’m like “where is Daniel Radcliffe now?’ Like oh maaan! I mean not to that extend because that cast is still younger than me, but blows my mind like the cast of MASH or something I still turn on almost daily then I see they passed or looking like my gramps in a nursing home. I just close that tab and transport back to the 4077."
