## Enjoying Your Camping Trip

Each year, thousands of people throughout the United States choose to spend their vacations camping in the great outdoors. Depending on an individual's sense of adventure, there are various types of camping to choose from, including log cabin camping, recreational vehicle camping, and tent camping. ***Of these, tent camping involves ""roughing it"" the most, and with proper planning the experience can be gratifying.*** Even with the best planning, however, tent camping can be an extremely frustrating experience due to uncontrolled factors such as **bad weather**, **wildlife encounters**, and **equipment failures**.

Nothing can dampen the excited anticipation of camping more than a **dark, rainy day**. Even the most adventurous campers can lose some of their enthusiasm on the drive to the campsite if the skies are dreary and damp. After reaching their destination, campers must then ""set up camp"" in the downpour. This includes keeping the inside of the tent dry and free from mud, getting the sleeping bags situated dryly, and protecting food from the downpour. If the sleeping bags happen to get wet, the cold also becomes a major factor. A sleeping bag usually provides warmth on a camping trip; a wet sleeping bag provides none. Combining wind with rain can cause frigid temperatures, causing any outside activities to be delayed. Even inside the tent problems may arise due to heavy winds. More than a few campers have had their tents blown down because of the wind, which once again begins the frustrating task of ""setting up camp"" in the downpour. It is wise to check the weather forecast before embarking on camping trips; however, mother nature is often unpredictable and there is no guarantee bad weather will be eluded.

Another problem likely to be faced during a camping trip is run-ins with **wildlife**, which can range from mildly annoying to dangerous. Minor inconveniences include mosquitoes and ants. The swarming of mosquitoes can literally drive annoyed campers indoors. If an effective repellant is not used, the camper can spend an interminable night scratching, which will only worsen the itch. Ants do not usually attack campers, but keeping them out of the food can be quite an inconvenience. Extreme care must be taken not to leave food out before or after meals. If food is stored inside the tent, the tent must never be left open. In addition to swarming the food, ants inside a tent can crawl into sleeping bags and clothing. Although these insects cause minor discomfort, some wildlife encounters are potentially dangerous. There are many poisonous snakes in the United States, such as the water moccasin and the diamond-back rattlesnake. When hiking in the woods, the camper must be careful where he steps. Also, the tent must never be left open. Snakes, searching for either shade from the sun or shelter from the rain, can enter a tent. An encounter between an unwary camper and a surprised snake can prove to be fatal. Run-ins can range from unpleasant to dangerous, but the camper must realize that they are sometimes inevitable.

Perhaps the least serious camping troubles are **equipment failures**; these troubles often plague families camping for the first time. They arrive at the campsite at night and haphazardly set up their nine-person tent. They then settle down for a peaceful night's rest. Sometime during the night the family is awakened by a huge crash. The tent has fallen down. Sleepily, they awake and proceed to set up the tent in the rain. In the morning, everyone emerges from the tent, except for two. Their sleeping bag zippers have gotten caught. Finally, after fifteen minutes of struggling, they free themselves, only to realize another problem. Each family member's sleeping bag has been touching the sides of the tent. A tent is only waterproof if the sides are not touched. The sleeping bags and clothing are all drenched. Totally disillusioned with the ""vacation,"" the frustrated family packs up immediately and drives home. Equipment failures may not seem very serious, but after campers encounter bad weather and annoying pests or wild animals, these failures can end any remaining hope for a peaceful vacation.

These three types of camping troubles can strike campers almost anywhere. Until some brilliant scientist invents a weather machine to **control bad weather** or a **kind of wildlife repellant**, unlucky campers will continue to shake their fists in frustration. More than likely, e**quipment will continue to malfunction**. Even so, camping continues to be a favorite pastime of people all across the United States. ***If you want camping to be a happy experience for you***, learn to laugh at leaky tents, bad weather, and bugs, or you will find yourself frustrated and unhappy.

Before recommending you to follow the top comments and report the person, there needs to be a little bit of background information you need to consider.

**How close are you to your friends at the party?** 

Would they be understanding of what happens in case this goes public (maybe the cop might try to shame you within the circle of friends after being reprimanded/punished.) It may be a good thing to cut off any bad friends that do not agree with you on reporting the cop to infernal affairs. But it really depends on YOU. There are plenty of other people in the world that can easily be your friends, make sure you pick good ones. 

**How willing are you to move from your place?**

If things really go sour, are you willing to take the leap and escape it. Usually a personality of entitlement this cop has, could come with other packages. You may not have seen it as violence, but it clearly was very violent. So you have to ask yourself, what is he willing to do if he just gets off with a warning? Could he severely harass and stalk you? He's a stranger, and probably willing to just drop this and move on.

&#x200B;

tl;dr. You should definitely report him, but don't sacrifice yourself for social justice (as my mom always said, not everyone needs to be a hero.) Please consider what you truly want, and if you can take the leap of faith. If this is truly making you feel humiliated, cry, neglected and is destroying your life anyways. Heck yeah then, report him to internal affairs.

If you were planning on starting school WHILE being homeless, I want to let you know that it is both unreal (in America, where tuition ranges from $200 per credit to $3000 per credit) and unhealthy. You should focus on picking up jobs and working where you can. Education is not necessary to find jobs, it only helps narrow does a specific focus into your future career. Most schools advise that you spend 2x the amount of class times to study, you need to calculate that into your lifestyle as well. Remember, job hunting IS a job of its own. So if you are constantly looking for work whatever jobs you can find, it sounds like you are doing so much extra.
