Elementary school (K-5th grade) in the US is not taken seriously at all. It's more like a daycare. I remember distinctively that we only learned like 1-2 new concepts in math every year from 1st grade to 5th grade and being impatient that the first 80% of a textbook was a repeat of the last 80% of last year's book.

Advanced reading programs exist, but they're 100% voluntary. If your parents don't sign you up for it, you're stuck reading short stories instead of novels throughout the school year. My reading skills were worse than average, being an immigrant (constantly needed the teacher to read words for me during class readings), but my parents signed me up for an optional book-reading contest and I brute forced my way through scores of optional picture books until I was able to read a chapter book within a year and became one of the best readers in my class. Was it fun? No. Was the payoff worth it? Yes. 

Same thing with physical education. There were students who were clearly out of shape and obese at such a young age but were given ""Satisfactory"" grades in physical education.

Younger students aren't pushed hard enough. There's no possible way that Americans are just dumber than the rest of the world. Students are just not challenged at all unless their parents pressure them at home.

""Real"" education doesn't begin until the end of 5th grade when you take an exam to determine whether you should be placed in the ""gifted and talented"" (fast) track or the ""default"" (slow) track. The slow track is more of the same thing, pretty much setting students up for failure later in life just to make them feel like they're doing well today.
