The main thing I see in my own use is that I didn't think of weed like alcohol or any other mind altering substance in a similar class. People tout weed, they love it, it can do NO wrong. I bought into that heavily and didn't even notice that I didn't get high anymore (when I first started smoking I had an oz in my drawer from a friend that lasted me A YEAR, and I still threw a lot of it away) but once I got into the community it's easy to make it sound normal to be high all the time.

I want to make it to moderation, I stopped drinking soda a few months back (an extremely bad habit for me) and I haven't even thought about it except in a rum and coke lol. I want to get there with weed, id like to have the fun I did have ( I never experienced the anxiety that people empathize with, not discounting just saying) so I really don't have a lot of negatives about it until I thought it wasn't like other drugs.

I'm on day 3, I feel mostly fine now and I'm experiencing a lot that I didn't get to when I was high all the time, so there is definitely positives to both in my mind, but one is a very dangerous slope I will agree."

British media allege six errors on the part of the aircrew:[16]


Gus Kohntopp, identified as POPOV36[18]
The pilots asked the Forward Air Controller (""Manila Hotel"") if friendly forces were around the Iraqi vehicles – not to the west.

Neither pilot gave the precise grid references for the Household Cavalry patrol to double check its identity.

The pilots convinced themselves that the orange identification panels were in fact orange rocket launchers.

POPOV36 decided to attack, saying he is ""rolling in"" without permission from the Forward Air Controller.

POPOV35 asked for artillery to fire a marker round into the target area to clear up confusion, but POPOV36 attacked without waiting for it.

POPOV36 strafed the column for a second time, but still doubted its identity.

The audio track includes debate over the identity of the targets and the order, from the FAC, to disengage identifying a likely ""blue-on-blue"" incident. The audio track also includes notification of one death and several injuries with the order to return to base.[19] Subsequent audio indicates the pilots crying and their frustration.

A statement released by the Oxfordshire coroner's office later confirmed that Walker was of the view that, being in the public domain, the video could now be presented as evidence without the approval of the US government, and that the inquest would resume on 12 March 2007.[20]

On 6 February 2007 the Sun named POPOV36 as Colonel Gus Kohntopp, a commercial pilot for Southwest Airlines and member of the Idaho Air National Guard.[21][22][23] The British inquest was set to resume on 12 March 2007. As of 9 February 2007, Kohntopp was reported to be, ""in hiding.""[24] He had previously been ""hailed as [a] hero"" by his neighbors in Boise, Idaho.[25]"

This works great for people who don't belong, not so much for the delivery drivers who ignore the 4 signs on my yard saying to not come in because of dog."

The owner asks us to charge it too so some attendants act like they know what's up only to look like an idiot trying to find the plug.

He proceeded to put on the best senile old man sketch I've ever seen, they like to make sure you aren't biased/related/etc to any of the parties involved so he kept claiming to know people only to get names blatantly wrong. Finally after they stopped asking him questions he fell asleep on the stand and got excused  like 10 minutes later lol."
