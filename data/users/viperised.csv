To leave the hand there is to consent in herself to flirt, to engage herself. To withdraw it is to break the troubled and unstable harmony which gives the hour its charm. The aim is to postpone the moment of decision as long as possible. We know what happens next; the young  woman leaves her hand there, but she does not notice that she is leaving it...the hand rests inert between the warm  hands of her companion — neither consenting nor resisting  — a thing."" - *Jean-Paul Sartre*"

>people who were so horribly abused during ww2 and before it are now acting just like their oppressors did back then.

To claim that Israel's treatment of the Palestinians is akin to the Nazi treatment of Jews is simply wrong on a massive scale. It's factually wrong. Since the first Intifada around 10,000 Palestinians have been killed, about 300 a year. In the six years of WW2, the Nazis on average killed 300 Jews every two hours. I don't have any skin in this game, but I'm just correcting a massive inaccuracy."

todayilearned,fclq1yx,t1_fclk8ka,1577753698.0,"This is [categorically untrue](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/21664/economics/nhs-spending-cuts/). The per capita cost of patients has risen significantly over the last few decades, since people are living longer but not concomitantly healthier, and are much more expensive to provide for. Government spending on the NHS has not kept pace with this increase in costs in many respects but to claim that per capita spending is lower than when the NHS was founded is totally wrong, misleading, and doesn't pass the common-sense test."
