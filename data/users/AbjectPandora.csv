In my brother's sophomore or junior year of hs, a guy in his gym class kept socking my brother with a gym lock held between his knuckles (think brass knuckles but with a gym lock). He'd come home everyday covered in bruises and scared about fighing back because our school had a no tolerance policy (basically everyone involved gets into a lot of trouble, even if you defend yourself). Our mom told him that if the other guy starts up again, that he better end it. The next day comes around and what do you know? My mom (who also works at the school), gets called down by the school resource officer and told that my brother got caught fighting. 

My ma goes to Dean's office and finds my brother with a dean and his counselor. Apparently, the kid had gone after by brother again and having had enough, my brother throws the kid into a particularly strong choke hold and wouldn't let up until the RO showed up.

My dog heard something else and flipped her shit.

My mother and I are similar to how you and your mother are. If my ma and I are goofing around or if I show her something stupid and it makes her laugh, she'll swat at my arms, legs, or my rear end.

With babies, however, it is very difficult since they don't really look like anything, but since it's an evolutionary trait for babies to look like their fathers (so that the father knows it's his baby and won't endanger it), the artist can base the features more on the father and then see what adjustments they can take."

memes,fdjxn88,t3_elohe1,1578490736.0,"I've always thought those neural spindles were to make a connection to another living thing. For instance, when Jake links with the Dire Horse or the Banshee, he's able to tell them where to go and how to run/fly without having to verbally tell or guide them to do so. Or similarly, when Jake and the other Na'vi connect to the Tree of Souls, and the similar smaller ones around the area, it's their way of physically connecting to the presence they worship and to connect with their loved ones who have died. 

In the case of using the neural spindles to mate, I don't see how that would be a thing. It's not made clear if Jake and Neytiri bond via the spindles, (if they even can since connecting that way to another person could be too much for ones brain to handle) or the ole fashioned way. In the film, Grace says that Neytiri and Tsu'tey become a mated pair and that is echoed by Neytiri when she and Jake are ""mated before Eywa"". If they are able to use the spindles to connect to one another, perhaps it's like the ultimate form of being able to completely understand **everything** about their partner. 

The Na'vi are very humanoid beings, with some obvious differences, but the fact that both the males and females wear loincloths indicates that they must have some kind of genitalia. Otherwise what would be the point? 

Besides all that, it was supposed to be a family film and editing in genitals probably wasn't at the top of the list for the art people to add in (or appropriate). That and the fact that the actors were in tight motion capture suits."

So, if one partner were to attempt oral sex on a strap-on, the woman wearing it could be able to feel what's going on to some extent because of the movement on the other end. So, it's plausible that the end inside the other partner could be moved in a way to stimulate a sensitive spot along her vaginal walls.

Fallout,fch4kql,t3_ef90hr,1577647255.0,"To be honest, I don't use any legendary armor or weapons in Fo4 because my regular weapons and armor are already more powerful and higher leveled (if that makes sense) than the legendary stuff I find. And the upgrades for them aren't really worth wasting materials on, either.

If I do find legendary stuff, I just have my companions use/hold on to it and then store it in it's respective workbench."
Fallout,fch1o85,t3_eguszb,1577646398.0,"I romanced Piper for my first (main) playthrough pretty much as soon as I met her. Now that I've completed one faction ending, I'm going to go through the other ones and work my way through romancing all the characters. 

Next up on my list are Cait, MacCready, Curie, and Danse."

If not, he has no reason to try to run into her home."

ARK,fc0eyme,t3_efeijz,1577289067.0,"My cousin (he's 8) and I spent an hour planning out our Adventure to find Raptor Claus two days ago. I'll never forget the excited look on his face when Raptor Claus appeared and started dropping gifts or when he realized that the loot was good. 

I'll also never forget the look on his face when 25 minutes later, the game crashed and rolled back to 20 or so minutes before Raptor Claus appeared.
