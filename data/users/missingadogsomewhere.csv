The best way to do this is keep the one(s) you’re very bonded with and rehome the rest. And work on training, since I wonder what the actual issue is with why she wants them gone... makes me think there’s issues. Maybe there’s just too many though.

You don’t care that she has a gaping hole in her uterus, you don’t care that she’s likely just endured the most physically taxing and likely the most painful part of her life so far, you don’t care that she’s almost certainly exhausted and feeling extremely vulnerable. You just wanted to pull your “gotcha” moment and didn’t care about her enough to make sure she’s relaxed right after fucking giving birth. I don’t care about the name, but it’s almost sinister to wait until she’s at her most vulnerable and weakest moment to try to one up her.

Plus the edits. Seems like you don’t understand that it’s a bit more than just the name that makes you an asshole. It also seems you only want to hear comments validating you."

Surrogacy is a nice option though. If he was serious about he his gf.

Though at the moment he’s being very cruel trying to pressure her specifically into having kids with him. It’s one thing to want bio kids. It’s another to not care if the child has a life threatening defect, and that your gf/potential wife would likely have a serious risk to her own life while pregnant as well. He’s being selfish even if the core desire is not bad."
AmItheAsshole,ff7t50m,t3_es1lw1,1579657728.0,"YTA for expecting a child from her... 

It’s not like the condition exists in a vacuum. Her sister died from the same thing...? Pregnancy is hardly safe. Chances are she has a high likelihood of dying if she got pregnant.

Your gf could die and you’re trying to convince her to make a baby for your sake. Wtf. Forget about the kid. Your gf could die. Women should not put their lives at risk to make babies.

And it’s selfish to want to make a baby with a serious defect that could kill it, yes. That’s incredibly selfish.

It’s not wrong to want a bio kid. But you shouldn’t pressure her and expect it from her... if you want a bio kid more than your gf then break up. Don’t try to argue or force her into risking her OWN life. And you shouldn’t care more about the idea of having a child than the actual child’s health. That’s fucked up."

Essentially he used her as a broodmare to have his kids. It was all a lie. It’s one of the worst things you can do to a woman imo... lie to her for decades just so you’ll have someone to have a kid with.

If he was struggling, he could have pretended to be straight. While being single. Treating women like their lives are meaningless and like they’re just natural collateral damage to you discovering yourself is evil. Just evil.

relationship_advice,ff73a34,t3_erydy1,1579640258.0,"Contact your parents. Ask for help getting there. If possible move out when he’s not home, as physical abuse can easily start in a high tension situation like that. Doesn’t matter if he’s never hit you before. And yes, you’d be doing a really really good thing by taking the dog and I’m very happy you said that.

If possible record him having an angry outburst and use that to get full custody — look up recording laws though to see if you’re in a one or two party consent state. Though he may not want custody because a kid will frustrate him more than a dog.

Get out now before you give birth. I think it’ll make things easier on you. Both legally and emotionally.

You have to leave. And never ever date anyone with anger issues again. They are just a nightmare to live with. 

There is nothing you can do to change him. You sound reasonable, it’s not your fault he’s doing this. There is no special way you can talk to him, he’ll get angry no matter what. Even if he doesn’t get angry now when you approach him... he’ll just have another outburst later."
relationship_advice,ff6xxvo,t1_ff5znzw,1579637174.0,"Their first bit of advice was definitely sexist :/ so they kinda suck for that.

However otherwise I think gave pretty good advice — at least if you apply it to EVERYONE and not just men.

Fixing the stopper in the sink will likely cost no money at all and be pretty easy. The likelihood of costing himself 500$ by trying... I mean it’s 0 to none.

I think trying things out instead of being self defeating is a really good quality. Again for all people, not just men. In the age of google, most problems require just a bit of research. If something is extremely important, yes call a professional! But a sink stopper? Likely it can be fixed at home by oneself with no money spent. Might as well try! I think people assume things are harder than they are, sometimes. Which is also maybe why OP says he can only cook 4 things — trying can be scary and no one likes to make bad food. So he sticks to what he knows.

Everyone can stand to be a little bit more handy with small things. This also extends to OP’s wife — she could fix the sink, if she believed in herself too. Believing I could do things if I just tried a little bit kind of changed my life. Suddenly I was doing all sorts of things that really only required 5 mins of google, but before seemed insurmountable because i just believed I didn’t have the skills to learn something that turned out to be relatively simple."
relationship_advice,ff6wmd8,t1_ff5rxnw,1579636396.0,"On this note, your worst enemy is yourself :) I like to talk about this stuff, because I had this mentality too (that I’m just not wired to learn this stuff, I’m bad, what if I make it worse).

There is this phenomenon that if you believe you’re bad at math. You’ll be bad at math. But if you open your mind and accept that maybe you CAN learn, suddenly it’s not that hard.

You just take it step by step. I believe the sink is actually very easy to fix so that’s a perfect way to start. Digest one piece of new information at a time, and honestly you can learn anything. The key is to not overwhelm yourself and frustrate yourself. One piece at a time.

This mindset is also useful for things like cooking. There are two pieces that I touched on. Which are, explicitly: 1) believe it isn’t as hard as you think. 2) one step at a time. Which means maybe you don’t understand a word. So you have to go and look up the definition and fully understand that word before you can go back and try what you want to do. Work slowly and you’ll be able to do anything.

There are lots of things in life I thought I couldn’t do. I thought I couldn’t be good with technology. Or cars. Thought I couldn’t cook. Then slowly I decided... why couldn’t I be good at these things? There is a lot I don’t know, which is fine. But when I come to a specific issue, I just decide it’s probably not that hard. I then do a little research and digest one piece at a time.

That we need to be professionals to do certain things, and that professionalism is out of our reach unless we’ve had years of training, is one of the biggest lies we grow up with. Yes, important/dire stuff should be left to professionals. But so many smaller things we can do ourselves if we just have a bit of confidence. And access to google of course.

Ps your wife also likely suffers from this self defeating mentality. :/ like she might think because she’s female she can’t/isn’t supposed to be handy. I’m female so I also grew up believing this. Then I just kind of stopped caring. I built a chicken coop by myself even though I at first believed it would be too complicated and when I was a kid I would have thought it was men who were supposed to do that stuff. Nah, I did a pretty good job.

Here is one more example from real life. Just two days ago my idiot puppy chewed through her SECOND harness. I was upset that I’d have to buy a third. Then I realized — I kept the first harness. Why not just use the whole unchewed strap from the first (which was broken in a different spot) to repair the second? Literally all it takes it a few stitches. And why can’t I do that? It’s not that hard. So I’ll fix it myself instead of spending a few more bucks. And all it took was me believing in myself, which helped me think outside the box and realize it was even fixable in the first place."

I just can’t quite wrap my head around how selfish it is to expect someone to SLEEP the way you want. You are human. You deserve to be comfy and he shouldn’t be so obsessed with your appearance only. You get a jacket he doesn’t like? Okay no wearing that either and you should be cold for his sake, too...

Also he knew what you were wearing. He deliberately touched your boxers and left to make you feel bad. That’s so... grossly manipulative. There is no denying that he purposefully touched your boxers and then made a show of leaving to SHAME you and scare you into never doing it again, because if you do he’ll walk out on you.

I’m glad you already decided to break up most likely. I just wanted to outline how he is a really skeezy guy in general. He not only demands you do what he wants, several times, but he has no qualms about setting you up to feel like garbage in an attempt to manipulate you into doing what he wants.

Eating healthy foods isn’t the same as eating too much. He’s eating too much. There might be some fluid. But that he stopped running but is likely eating the same as if he used to do that, that’s the most likely cause of at least most of the weight gain.

He needs to adjust his portion sizes if he is overweight now. That’s it. He doesn’t need to exercise.

I’m sorry I don’t have better advice. But this is a real phenomenon. People need to not keep eating at their old demands when they become bedridden. They have different caloric needs then. That’s all.

When you don’t exercise you need less calories. So if you want to maintain your weight you eat less calories than before. Healthy foods can have plenty of calories."

Slightly off topic but it’s really no surprise that so many older marriages had dead bedrooms. Men were taught that their wives owed them sex. Women were taught that sex wasn’t supposed to be for them too, just for their husbands. Of course in an environment like that, women will stop wanting sex.

I feel like people neglect to realize that you can enjoy sex, but hate it and lose interest in it when someone treats you like a sex dispenser and nothing else. I don’t think dead bedrooms are nearly as common in mutually respectful relationships where there is actual love. Instead of like this one, where her husband is a useless fuckwit who can’t even bother to use a condom to maybe, idk, prevent a LIFE THREATENING condition? If he cares more about pleasure than her literal life? Then I mean... likely their bedroom will stay dead forever, you can’t really recover from knowing your husband is so selfish he’ll happily fuck without bc knowing you could die if you get pregnant again.

I think if I were in this situation, it wouldn’t matter if he did a 180. I’d never want to fuck someone like this again. Sex drives absolutely can be destroyed by a selfish partner and sometimes they never recover. But they could hypothetically recover with a new partner.

Yes tricking someone into having sex with a whole different person is rape.

>	In Norwalk, California, on February 20, 2009, Julio Morales sneaked into a sleeping 18-year-old woman’s darkened bedroom after he saw her boyfriend leave. The woman said she awoke to the sensation of someone having sex with her and assumed it was her boyfriend. When a ray of light hit Morales’s face, and the woman saw he was not her boyfriend, she fought back and Morales fled. The woman called her boyfriend, who then called the police. Julio Morales was convicted of rape under two concepts. He was guilty of rape because he began having sex with the woman while she was still asleep and, therefore, unable to consent. He was also guilty of rape-by-fraud because he had impersonated the woman’s boyfriend in order to gain her consent.

Do you REALLY think there is nothing wrong with this? That a woman consenting to sex with one person = she’s consenting to any random person? I found your “prove me wrong” extremely obnoxious and antagonistic so I don’t have a lot of hope that you’ll see what is obviously rape as rape even when people literally get convicted of rape for this. It seems likely you honestly believe that consenting to one person means consenting to all and it’s okay to rape so long as you have the lights off first, or so long as someone’s only reason for rejecting you is money or status — then it’s okay to rape away."
