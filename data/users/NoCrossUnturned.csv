2. The Wire

3. Breaking Bad

The Sopranos is my absolute #1, but I could swap The Wire with Breaking Bad depending on the day. But I would have no problem with someone having them in any other order."
wholesomememes,fewy1xp,t3_eqr2n2,1579421250.0,I'm 26 and feel like my childlike excitement towards seeing various animals has only gotten stronger with age.
Metal,fetrpbr,t1_feq448n,1579379097.0,"As a whole? Probably. But Metallica’s first three albums are untouchable, I would say Rust in Peace is the only Megadeth album that gets as much play from me as them. But Metallica definitely had a steeper decline and put out some awful albums."

AdviceAnimals,fe9vs3w,t1_fe9mjo0,1578941848.0,"I never even thought about that, but it makes perfect sense. A cremated human body would produce a large amount of ash."
LivestreamFail,fe1jsl0,t1_fdy48up,1578827427.0,"Most of the subreddit is composed of kids worshipping streamers and discussing their drama, are you really surprised?"
hiphopheads,fdynhii,t1_fdwwd7f,1578781711.0,"Extremely underrated, he has some CLASSIC albums that don’t get mentioned enough. Ghetty Green and Mista Don’t Play are on regular rotation for me."

halo,fdpy5da,t3_emju9d,1578645548.0,"A lot of people didn't like reach when it came out (myself included). I gave Reach a chance on PC because I want to play the other games when they come out and I haven't touched a halo since Reach. Reach's multiplayer is as bad as I remember, but I still enjoyed it for a few days. The bad aspects of the game are just too glaring to ignore any more and I am taking a break until the games I enjoy come out."

LivestreamFail,fd1f3zm,t1_fd0e7tv,1578130680.0,Most subreddits have really gone to shit over the last few years. Even the frontpage has gotten much worse.
