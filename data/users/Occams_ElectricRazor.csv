investing,ff7m3lg,t3_erts1i,1579652814.0,"I'd like an objective opinion on this idea I have. 

I'm a 33 year old physician who is going to finish training at the end of July. I've signed a contract for my first grown up job.

I have a few current investment goals. Once I start my job, my employer maxes out my 401k, so that's taken care of.

As far as my part, I'm planning on maxing my 457b (I'll be working for a private nonprofit), backdooring my Roth, etc. All in all, 50% of my take home pay is going to either student loans or savings/investment. My loans will be paid off within 4 years with this plan.

I don't want to get into specific numbers because I don't want to sound like I'm bragging. I also haven't done a full valuation of the company and situation...I'm earmarking about 15% of my take home pay as cash on hand for investment into my father's and aunts/uncles business. They've established a self storage business that is growing pretty well, and I'd like to be able to help them, but also make some money off of it. Basically I'm willing to be a silent partner in exchange for minimum equity in the company (it's how they're planning on retiring, so I don't want to take too much). I'll basically loan to them at 0% in exchange for a small % of the company (something like 1-2% for a 50k loan).  They seem very interested (partly because the 0% and partly because they want me to be involved with them). 

To me, this seems like a safe way to get a small percentage of their growing company, help them out, and not cripple them by taking too much of it. I also don't want to disturb what they're already doing well.

Thanks in advance for any advice, even criticisms."

If a vehicle is invoiced at 55k, MSRP of 72, and you give discounts to list at 62, that should be the price listed.
