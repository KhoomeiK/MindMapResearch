He noped out and moved to London, where he was regularly discriminated against for his Irish roots, but was genuinely one of the nicest, most open guys you’d hope to meet, he preached long and hard for worker and union rights, and was one of the few old guys during my childhood (outside of my direct family) who was super supportive of the black and Asian families in our area during the late 80’s and early 90’s, when the NF and C18 were victimising their communities.

If not on a diplomatic list would one still be covered by immunity..? Also, within a allied nation with close military and intelligence ties, what would be the purpose of hiding intelligence officers amongst the diplomatic corps? I would assume that there are agents from CIA and NSA seconded to work directly with British military at GCHQ and Intelligence in London. Genuine questions by the way, not trying to be obtuse."
