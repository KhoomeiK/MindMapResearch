financialindependence,fdtctt6,t3_emo08n,1578714939.0,"Some things I have been doing:
I am replacing my $4 drink I get with a homemade substitute. Been making sure I invest a little more at the grocery store on food I’ll look forward to eating. My cousin lives with my family at my house so I save on child care and we pool resources. 
I put myself on “spending fasts” for a few days and try to go without spending any money unless it’s absolutely necessary. 
Instead of taking the more expensive shorter commute I plan for the bus which is less than $4 each way (it’s far) and actually using that time to get work done so it’s “worth it”"

science,fdnmb6d,t1_fdnlynf,1578588771.0,"So a lot of what I do right now is goal planning. I also am undergoing treatment for ADHD which contributed a lot to my impostor syndrome. A major theme is confidence and strengthening it by achieving goals regularly. 
As far as confidence training, I went through a group called “Black on the Job” which is not specific to STEM. I did one on one coaching over the phone and they sent me a plan but the most helpful part was identifying the problems and what I need to do to solve it and what the consequence might be if I choose not to. 
I hope this helps and I would like it if anyone else could add their sources/methods because this is something I am actively working on."
science,fdngjtg,t3_em9t4e,1578585338.0,"I am 30 and in the last year of my PhD and I invested in confidence training and other methods of empowerment and it has been major in overcoming impostor syndrome. Being multiracial, low income female from an extremely diverse high school and going to to a highly ranked undergrad institution in New England I wasn’t prepared for the culture shock. 
Most of the time it wasn’t someone else making me feel like I didn’t belong. Sometimes I would assume ill intentions as a result of the insecurities I developed over time. 
For the most part I think the only real answer is awareness and support in order to end the cycle where we are losing brilliant minds in science just because of a sense of inadequacy."
chemistry,fdneuyi,t3_em424d,1578584311.0,"I do protein expression and purification for crystallography (which is basically like voodoo) and I always tell people that what I do is more like cooking. There’s a lot of room for changes and you get a similar result. On the other hand, synthesis labs I have worked in have been more like baking. You have a specific recipe and things have to be measured with good accuracy or you end up with poor results."

facepalm,fdi0l3v,t3_elchqg,1578433594.0,"Most of these replies are written by pseudo scientists that fail to recognize that even a small change in chemical structure can yield major differences. 

This is illustrated in any elementary chemistry course through the synthesis of aspirin from oil of wintergreen. So stop trying to compare adderall or Ritalin to meth. They are not the same.

edited to add: Desoxyn is meth but it is rarely prescribed and is distinct from adderall and methylphenidate (ritalin)"

MurderedByWords,fdgm3xa,t1_fdgidnb,1578401920.0,"I feel this way too. There is a culture of callousness as you call it and there are many people who get off on saying the most evil things just for a reaction. But it’s like reflex and they somehow convince themselves that this is a legitimate way to go about life. For example when an immigrant child is brought up and their hardships, some asshole will say “oh well their parents shouldn’t have come here” JUST for the simple fact that they know it’s an inflammatory comment

I have been watching this for a while and I am still trying to figure out how we fix this. It’s horrible that we have a large group of people in the world who literally go every single day trying to find new levels of “callousness”. And it somehow tends to land on white men more often than anyone and I can’t figure out why that is because I know there is more to it than just simple privilege. It’s a hardened culture of coldness that is fostered at a young age, that somehow shifts into a whole political perspective with time. Maybe it’s violent culture or maybe it’s conditioning but all I know is that it is extremely toxic and doesn’t actually have to do with personal opinion or freedom of speech. 

Sorry for the long winded response but I’ve been trying to wrap my mind around this for over a decade now"
MadeMeSmile,fdgl8xs,t1_fdgbq5d,1578401101.0,You have never dealt with a true narcissist. Your mind has never been under the type of control where leaving is the last thing you want to do no matter how much it hurts. And I’m happy you’ve never experienced this because it’s awful
MadeMeSmile,fdg1mys,t1_fdfuv4h,1578376720.0,Grey rock method. Never give a narcissist emotion. If you become as boring as a grey rock they will move on.  They need emotional people in order to play out their manipulations

Not trying to defend violence or crime but rather dissecting things for the good and not just tossing out everything because of certain negative aspects. Because life is never really cut and dry like that
