GreenBayPackers,ffg3wlc,t1_fffnw09,1579897909.0,Did you see Jackson? Laughable.
todayilearned,fezrz9w,t3_eqwbzo,1579460889.0,I wonder if that would flip for cultures who read from right to left instead of left to right.

nfl,fe5wflc,t1_fe5veqh,1578876465.0,With how our offense has been able to move the ball - a lost fumble might as well be a touchdown.
nfl,fe5vcnx,t3_env82r,1578875780.0,Call stands. At least this makes up for the bullshit call on the fumble.

At my job the manager and one member of the team interview prospective employees, and for the managers it’s the department head and a member of the business team for the respective stream that does the interview."
army,fd43jmq,t1_fd0637u,1578164070.0,"I was deployed in the same vicinity of some SF, within the past 24 months. They still preferred no doors, in favor of more guns. Sounds blunt, but they used some vehicles similar to what the general forces use, but no doors, a push bar, and 4 more guns.  M2 on top, 4 x .240 on the doors."
todayilearned,fcsansq,t1_fcs0shi,1577913868.0,I’m pretty sure they have to buy them. Hitting those benchmarks just *allows* you to buy one.

Even if you dumped that into 1 month Treasury bonds, at a measly 1.56% (the rate as if 12/27), that’s still a fairly hefty income.
