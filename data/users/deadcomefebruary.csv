askscience,fgy9262,t1_fgxxe8h,1581180760.0,"It's theoretically possible, if you got it on every single square inch of your skin. I would think if that were to happen though, if you still ate a large excess of calories, you would still store visceral fat (fat around your organs) which I'm pretty sure we can't liposuction. Yet. Essentially you would be making yourself extremely unhealthy as well as MAJORLY throwing off your hormone balances."

AskReddit,fgvf2p8,t1_fgv3ipo,1581147590.0,"Ugh. I did early morning too, and I was already struggling with ptsd/cutting/depression/anxiety at that age.

Throw in ALWAYS being in advanced schools/classes with hours of homework and all the sleep deprivation that comes with it AND an abusive stepfather who would punish me for missing seminary AND no social life...high school was living hell for me."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fgv4enz,t1_fgsfw5f,1581136820.0,"Lol yes. There's a bit more to it, but in short, you're correct.

Essentially, we believe that God is the father of our spirits (as in, who WE are, without the body). He does have a body, a solid one you can touch, but it exists on a higher plane of being--he radiates with so much power that if it were possible to see him with our mortal eyes, we'd probably be incinerated.

God once was human, just like we are (this is where some religions like to call mormons blashphemers). He transcended and gained power by being both just and merciful, basically so full of goodness, knowledge, and light that the elements themselves are bound and even want to obey him. So that's our quick explanation of our understanding of God.

This applies to us in that, if we follow certain steps, and become as pure/honest/true/good/light as he is we will also be able to have his same power. The steps that the mormon religion outline include: faith on Jesus Christ, baptism by immersion, repentance+sacrament, holy marriage in the temple (this is why mormons are so against gay marriage so much of the time--according to mormon belief, men and women balance each other, we have a heavenly mother who is married to God/heavenly father, and in order to be spiritual parents as they are we must also be in a partnership with a man and woman), and just in general living a good life and seeking holiness.

Also, if you do manage to get that far (lol I definitely wont) you would probably end up creating hundreds, thousands, millions of earths/planets over time as the universe is ever expanding, and as an omnipotent and immortal god, what else are you gonna do for all of eternity except expand the family?

It's actually pretty interesting when you delve into the science behind it rather than just calling everything an unknowable and incomprehensible miracle, imo."

pics,fgv3ia0,t1_fgtxamd,1581136091.0,"Yup. I used to drink all through the week then once I knew I would have two days off I would try to wean off...then spend the next 2 days laying in bed almost hallucinating, not sleeping, shaking, vomiting bile, sweating through the hot and cold flashes, having waking dreams that I couldn't always differentiate from reality...alcohol is pretty horrid"
pics,fgv3dj7,t1_fgu09ns,1581135984.0,"Yup. They suck. I should've been dead multiple times by now and I'm lucky I've never had a seizure with them. At least twice I've gone to the hospital with a BAC of .4+ and one time I went with a BAC of .575. That is around 1.4× the LETHAL limit.

Still wanna drink tho :/"

I totally know how hard it is to fall asleep sober btw. Dilute your stash so you dont drink it as quickly and can wean off a little bit, then brace yourself for a hard three days. While you can still hold down food, eat high fat, high protein foods with plenty of electrolytes (sodium, magnesium, potassium). Magnesium supplements will help you sleep better, also. 

Just remember, eventually your body won't keep up with your alcoholism, and you can't spend every day drinking all day. Eventually you WILL have to detox, even if you only stay sober for a day after you're done."
