NoStupidQuestions,ffenyo8,t3_et6cfh,1579856612.0,"You could be suffering from work burnout. I haven't found any good method to get rid of it however, I would recommend doing something out of the ordinary. If you're an extrovert maybe spend time with friends if you have one or go to a local group/ club in your hometown. If you're an introvert I don't know what they do.... just do something different and fun if you think work burnout is the case."

I suppose I might be more into dark humor than the average joe. But I do see a lot of upvotes on the occasional Futurama Suicide Booth memes. I have a lot of thinking to do... but, your idea about making a situation less realistic given the way in which it's presented (animated). Seems to make sense."
Vent,ffd65um,t3_esz51c,1579814180.0,"I've actually researched it a bit and right now they're having a manual labor shortage. They're also looking to hire computer programmers, chiropractors, chefs, pretty much anything under the sun in the near future because they have a low birth rate at the moment and a high population of elderly that's expected to increase. That being said it is hard as hell to get points towards getting a full life time residency in the country matter of fact it's ranked number two in the world as far as how hard it is to emigrate they're fully or in fact get citizenship. Although it's feasibly impossible now one of the best strategies towards getting full citizenship there would have been to start in your early 20s and go to a high-ranking university if you want to live there for the rest of your life. That being said if you are a native English speaker you can go over there to teach Japanese students (on a temporary work visa) English they will recoup your expenses however they recommend a saved up amount of $5,000 just in case you get into trouble. As far as getting a fair maiden and I am going to give my very very honest opinion it sounds like you live too much in anime and fantasize far too much....kind of like a teen boy. No one around your dating age wants to date someone who lives in a delusional fantasy world where they're always looking towards the future and not enjoying today. Also given the work ethic you described it sounds like you expect things to just fall in your lap rather than reaching out and going for it. Having a real life companion takes hard work and taking risks and most importantly if you have standards for someone you would like to meet and date you need to meet those same standards as well otherwise relationships just fall apart. I know what I'm saying is harsh but, it needs to be said."
PlayTemtem,ffbskdf,t3_esotrp,1579781150.0,"Great analogy totally agree. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw all the winding paths. I've gotten every Pokemon game since Sapphire (with exception to Sword and Shield.) I have to say the last time I felt like exploring the landscape was Black and White and it was more like a mah feeling with that generation. However, with Temtem's 3D environments long winding paths with hills, sandy beaches that are so far in my journey used sparingly, piers that are far out over the water with many different paths, even every home has fun characters you can talk to, not to mention the stunning visuals, and sometimes even a path that just leads to future content or dead ends with items. I feel like exploring every little nook and cranny it's absolutely great. The Temtem Team did a remarkable job.:)"
Vent,ffbqx37,t1_ffbq8jo,1579779164.0,"That doesn't mean you can't be happy that you had some good times as well in the relationship. But, cutting an emotionally unstable person who constantly yo-yos you around out of your life is a very good thing. Especially if you have no obligations to deal with them whatsoever. What he did to you was cruel wrong and way out of line. I know I sound like a babbling fool right now. But, I got out of a toxic narcissistic relationship last year and if I could save someone else the time and hassle of dealing with a toxic relationship I will do my best. Just about the only thing I regret is not ending the relationship as soon as I got the gut feeling something was wrong. I'm all ears if you want to vent some more go ahead it's good for you. :) good luck OP in the end the choice is up to you."
Vent,ffbq8jo,t1_ffbq1wj,1579778268.0,He hurt you once he'll hurt you again. Someone like that in your life is not worth it. Think of all the evil and despicable things he has done to you and think of how much effort you put into the relationship that he did not. Remember why you blocked him the first time and remember why you want him out of your life now. Sometimes life is more beautiful enjoyable and lovely without certain people in it. Don't let him make you cry again you got this. (My recommendation still keep him out of your life.) Also don't let him confuse you and play this I've changed crap. Or it's not as bad as it seems. Your emotions are valid and real. Also remember sometimes gaslighting can also be a thing as well. You got this you're beautiful you're worth it.

I've made an effort to make friends with people in a small group I have that meets once a week. Yet my anxiety causes me to talk in a way that always sounds like I'm second-guessing myself. This is basically what that 2 month looks like for me. I know I could go out on my own but, all the free things like the public library is a 45-minute walk away don't even get me started on the bus schedule it's so bad. For me to just sit there and read books. I'm working on getting a job but those take weeks to get and college is about to start soon.

iamatotalpieceofshit,feyah0j,t1_fey5w7e,1579442992.0,NP perhaps I was a bit harsh in my words too. We both have different life experiences and different opinions.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fexytc5,t1_fextrdt,1579438473.0,"I understand your argument.. but, it's not someone's responsibility to drown with someone else. Believe me this viewpoint hurts me as well I have Asperger's and a lot of people don't want to hang out with me because of that. But if they force themselves to stay with me when they don't want to I see how miserable everyone else is. Your depression may be livable with and I'm so glad you found a partner to support you in your time of need. But, I would rather see people be happy then even give me a chance. For that man he didn't sign up to be committed to her he's free that's what boyfriend and girlfriend means you always have a foot out the door. Once he marries her then he has a responsibility to work things out but until that happens he's a free bird so is she. Society should be a little selfish and help themselves and get enough resources to stay afloat before they decide to help with others otherwise everyone drowns. Whether it be with sorrow, finances, or anything under the sun. He has every right to leave and as far as I'm concerned and mental facilities don't just keep you locked down without any proof of further harm. They're only allowed to keep you for 24-hours (don't know if they're in America but that's a law here in the US) without admission of suicide or any proof and they have to let you go. She was probably too much for him to handle. That is my true thoughts on the matter. I still think ghosting her was a dick move however, I have a feeling if he got all the way to a week before the wedding. Then she got put into a mental facility my best guess is she tried to kill herself and he didn't want someone who committed suicide on a regular basis to even be in his life and yes someone committing suicide in your life is very scary and mentally damaging more then likely requiring therapy to get over. I've had to run away from people taking advantage of my mental state, and for some ghosting was the only option after so many messages of them trying to get back into my life any way they can me being vague and them keep on pressing on. Sorry it's a long reply I just kind of get mad at people who say you're trapped in a cage because that person has mental illness and, they like you so go be with that person forever no take backs. I've had far too many moms make their kids miserable by saying hey go hang out with the weird kid and forcing them too. That weird kid was me. It's just a butthole move for people to do that let us be lonely in peace and, may the people around us be happy."
Vent,femkuxr,t3_epxz8q,1579260606.0,It's okay take a deep breath.. that sounds absolutely rough and horrible. My advice to you is once they block you on every app you want to keep them blocked on every app and get them out of your life completely. Don't take that abusive crap anymore because you are worth more than that. If a person does that to you in your life and they send you on a rollercoaster of emotions. Get off as quickly as you can because they'll just repeat the same patterns over and over again. Side note (your ex sounds exactly like a narcissist and the bad kind of narcissist.) You got this OP get that man out of your life.
iamatotalpieceofshit,femk2gq,t3_ept48v,1579259552.0,"Her partner does not owe her anything. If it was too much of a strain on him to be with a depressed person. Then it's okay for him to walk away it's not like she's a dependent on him or anything like a child would be. Her partner  didn't do anything bad such as gaslighting, physical emotional abuse, or dragging her into the depression through threats. No one owes anyone anything not even loyalty. It's a cold world I know but, I have seen too many people trapped in abusive relationships because they think they owe their partner something or they think can save them. The only thing that was bad on his part was the fact that he ghosted during their  engagement and he didn't give her closure ( I'm willing to bet she exaggerated or she did something so horrible he didn't want to come back.) Other than that he has every right to leave just as she has every right to leave at any time for any reason. That's just the way the cookie crumbles sad but true."

myfriendwantstoknow,fe15fvp,t3_endoui,1578822677.0,"I have Asperger's too I am 21 years old and just started learning how to drive this year. I never thought I would be able to because I get scared and mix up my left and right. What helped me out was a specially-designed class for Aspergers drivers. Believe me they have them out there you just got to look. They sent me through an entire bootcamp of learning how to hydroplane and weave and dodge cones (I would recommend going to the DMV and getting a permit first to boost your confidence as the classes are a big investment in time and money.) But, the first step to learning how to drive seriously is go-karting and riding your bike around town. Go-karting is the best option cuz you learn what it feels like to be behind the wheel. Biking is for coordination balance  and getting the feel  a freely moving a vehicle. There are also special exercises you can do to help you get more coordinated. I wish you the best of luck.
PS: sorry for not answering the initial question. Just letting you know there's hope yet you'll be able to drive."

Vent,fdukovb,t3_en4wnr,1578734413.0,"I live around LA I have been chased by some of them from the bus stop. They also don't bathe which makes the bus very smelly. One of them even begged my family for money while we were sitting down at McDonald's to eat. In this part of the world they're even closing down parks to the public so they can set up there camping tents. There's is a camp site  by a local petting zoo in a park we went to just today and, we could hear one them screaming at the top of their lungs (we did not stay long.) The place was completely abandoned because of their presents. It's kind of weird to see a bunch of unclean adults playing on playground equipment with no kids in site (not to mention most of us are trapped in small apartments in LA.) There's also one more incident I had when a hobo came on my school campus and I was alone in the bathroom with that particular lady who was enjoying their time way too much (won't go into too much details about that because it's not safe for work.) Not to mention lots of local shop owners have to pick up the slack the city does not end up sweeping up after the hobos anything from fecal matter to chip bag leave behind to open up their business to for the day to get paying customers. I'm just one of millions who live around this stuff everyday. Where you live you probably only have like a couple hobos but over here we have over 300,000. After a while of being hit with the stuff day after day after day you start to get fed up and resent the homeless people who take over your park."

Me and all my nerd friends experienced too. But, I will tell you one thing if you want to make friends you got to learn to look for common interests. I know it may be hard especially to find someone who you can relate to you and hold  your interest and theirs for that reason. However, you can try to bend a bit and pick up some popular interests of your age group. Another bit of advice I can give to you is to learn humility and not to think too highly of yourself. It goes a long way just sit back relax and listen to people (my problem might relate to you) and to find intelligence in what others are saying. Try to acknowledge and understand that other people know what they're doing. PS. Sometimes people don't but it will come back to bite you in the butt if you say anyting in that case you need to evaluate risk vs reward. As you get older people will start to be more accommodating towards differences you will too it will get easier.
