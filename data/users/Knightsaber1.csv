TooAfraidToAsk,ffz91y4,t3_evm6ks,1580367860.0,Definitely. Family gatherings do it to me every time.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffz8z90,t3_evn2te,1580367772.0,"I think it’s just slang in that sense. Gay men use it a lot, too, especially if they’re younger than their partners. Of course, they all have to be okay with the nickname rather than creeped out."
Sims4,ffz8nc6,t3_ew134w,1580367421.0,I see he’s thinking of joining the Tech Guru career path. He should be a real hit at GeekCon.
TooAfraidToAsk,ffz8hww,t1_ffz53xd,1580367286.0,"Pretty much this reason, I think. The nerdier something is, the more likely it is to develop a boy’s club atmosphere that sends women packing at the first, “tits or GTFO”."
Sims4,ffyis83,t1_ffxtz81,1580347420.0,Those damn Peepings would sure get a “shock”.
Sims4,ffvgwzp,t1_ffuoljj,1580263847.0,"It drives me nuts how Sim life is so much easier than real life.  In Sim life, the economy never factors into anything, and a Liberal Arts degree can actually lead to a lucrative career path."
Sims4,ffux384,t3_ev5dlt,1580250996.0,"That’s awesome. I’m going to try that one, too."
Sims4,ffuwz4x,t3_ev8g7r,1580250933.0,Use the couch if there’s bed-related trauma. That’s what I do for bed monsters.
Sims4,ffuwqn2,t3_ev6hi9,1580250801.0,Be sure to put his urn/headstone in a nice place of honor for his contributions.
Sims4,ffuw6tc,t3_et5na9,1580250493.0,"Seriously, though, you could probably change her hair in CAS to make her look more on the dad’s side. The toddler hair options have some adorable varieties,"
arresteddevelopment,ffnl4a6,t1_ffkur85,1580067447.0,“WHITE POWER!” “I am white!”
arresteddevelopment,ffjqc1p,t3_eu0656,1580004248.0,I don’t know what I expected.
Sims4,ffjcgsj,t3_etv4rw,1579995383.0,"I’m always pretty particular about diversity when I’m playing. Not for wokeness reasons, but because I just like the variety."
Sims4,ffjc6cz,t3_etv8s6,1579995216.0,"Well, those sore muscles need... oh wait."
Sims4,ffihddb,t3_etr9bm,1579973907.0,"It’s too bad so many people find that attractive. I prefer a really nice balance with the muscle and fat sliders, with no extremes for either one."
