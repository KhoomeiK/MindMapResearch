Also, the concept of how many people completely avoid Nissan due to the CVT issues that might otherwise consider purchasing them. 

And adapting an existing transmission is significantly cheaper than staring from scratch. Unless they're sitting on a stockpile of a million of these, they can write down the R&D costs at this point.

These companies keep creating new models at the low end that aren't really that different from each other. 

Personally, I think Subaru has it right - the Crosstrek is just a lifted Impreza hatch. Then you have the Forester that's larger and more powerful for mid sized. Then full sized is the Ascent. Maybe add in a single subcompact hatch that's like the Yaris and call it a day.

The whole point of taxing these ski homes is to use that tax money to build affordable housing. In addition, it dissuades people from buying property and sitting on it. If anything, it might actually lower the prices of these homes/condos because people who would buy a say a $500k condo for occasional use might not want to pay the additional $5,000 in taxes. This then leads to more owners selling their condos, creating more supply, which reduces the pricing.

Denver,fecnded,t1_feclqjz,1578978258.0,"That's the point. These taxes would only be for secondary homes. The extra tax revenue would then go to locals.

This. Unless you happen to live in bofoo land, I can't see the need for these services to even exist. I'm on the edge of the Denver metro and still have 5 restaurants within a half mile, and probably 20 if I expand that out to 3 miles.

To be fair though, the NA's were around for 7 years, the NB's were around for 7 years and the NCs were around for 10 years. So 5 model years for the ND is more than expected. I'd assume we'd see a NE come 2022-2025. 

Part of the issue with the Miata is so much of the love comes from the NA and NB's, mostly due to price and reliability. You can easily pick up a clean example for under $4k. For an enthusiast, $4k is pretty much Fuck Yes money for a fun, reliable sports car. Meanwhile, a 2019 retails for what, close to $26-28k? That's harder to justify as a weekend car unless you're more well off."
