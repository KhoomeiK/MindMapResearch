I attempted yesterday, beginning of the month and last year, nothing has never worked for me. Im currently trying and trying to OD on tylenol and ibuprofen and it’s not even working. but just know I’m not really here to give you shitty sympathy. just know committing isn’t even worth it."

depression,fe0b1lh,t3_en5e2r,1578808288.0,"people who do that really pushes me over to the edge, just because you made a bad grade on your test doesn’t mean your depressed, just because your crush rejected you doesn’t mean your depressed, just because this and that doesn’t mean anything. people are actually out there suffering from depression and other very serious problems and some people thinks it’s a joke.."
depression,fe0asuc,t3_enho05,1578808058.0,"same, from people perspective I seem all happy like life was great to me. but no, I’m just some sad piece of shit breathing for no reason. I guess you can call me a good actor."
SuicideWatch,fe0airz,t3_engilp,1578807793.0,"people don’t think they matter. it’s multiple people commit suiciding almost everyday, and you think they’re gonna look at this and say “oh yeah thanks! I’m no longer depressed!!” it doesn’t work like that. even I’m depressed myself, and guess what? I don’t fucking matter, so your 2 letter sentence didn’t help."

I believe we were born from a some type of animal on earth and we evolved more and more throughout the years."
SuicideWatch,fe09m78,t3_eni396,1578806959.0,"my father and my mother are in the picture, it’s just my father doesn’t treat me very well. but either way I still love him, and me being depressed and emotionally drained all the time, wanting to kill myself knowing it’ll probably hurt my parents hurts me even more."
SuicideWatch,fdyfg60,t3_enakk8,1578779187.0,"yes, I think “when are you going to die? tomorrow? today? just when?”"
SuicideWatch,fdya11h,t3_encj7y,1578777625.0,"I feel the same way as you, my insecurities are so bad looking into the mirror hurts me so bad. and people claim “oh you’re so pretty” or “you look cute” when I’m actually not. that hurt me even more when they compliment me."
SuicideWatch,fdy7unb,t3_enc7tm,1578776958.0,"same, I feel like dying would be a better option. so I could live a new life, that’s better than the life I’m living right now."

SuicideWatch,fdqe44g,t1_fdqdna8,1578664272.0,"I have anxiety because I have a very low self esteem & I’m a insecure person, I became insecure because my father would always insult me calling me disgusting names and telling me i should’ve been aborted. it really broke me honestly."
