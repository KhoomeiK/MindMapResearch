aww,ffen0rw,t1_ffbvpb1,1579855224.0,Haha -- exactly. You've said it perfectly--and they know how to get everyone around him to do his bidding. I think the other pets do whatever he wants all because he opens all the doors for them whenever they want.  They just boop the door or swipe it once and he's Johnny-on-the-spot opening any door they want open.
aww,ffemrlb,t1_ffbx884,1579854858.0,He's a Rhodesian. I think there are some gentler herding dogs. We found German Shepherds to be great with kids. They're gentle and see themselves as their self-appointed guardians of the kids--always supervised.

He recognizes several variations of the word ""WALK"", so you can't say it in English, spell it, or use pig-latin without him getting excited, grabbing his leash, dropping it at your feet , then looking at you and looking at the door, repeatedly.

If you don't hurry up, he will then go get your shoes or your hat and bark, as if to say ""get the hell up so I can go for my W-A-L-K!"".

But I don't care if it is just to create interest and drive ratings, suggesting that she MIGHT have been a ""street walker"" for all they know is downright disrespectful.

The fact that Robert and his brother have 12 kids between them with so many different women suggests that THEY are the ones with with the issue. It's their shame that makes them turn the tables to accuse Anny of being a hooker, in a feeble attempt to level the playing field. Robin is great but her brothers suck.

Anny needs to make them realize that she knows that they would never be ok with having a street-walker as Bryson's mother so they are insulting her for no reason. Anny should not be signing on for this kind of disrespect. I'm glad she stands up for herself even though she IS on her own. Robert needs to be put in check every time he tries to put Anny down.

PS: Street walkers may not be in the position to be the best moms they can be but they are usually victims--which makes Robert's comments about Anny even more offensive now that I think of it."

AmItheAsshole,fetust2,t3_eqh8mh,1579380237.0,"OP, you can arrange to pay for the casket by purchasing it wholesale on your own and NOT through the funeral home. Google ""caskets"" and you'll see what local and other options are available. Pick 2-3 companies to talk with and go with the one you feel most comfortable with who can meet your needs. Line it up asap.

 Go with your parents to the funeral home to see what the minimal cost of a funeral would be and have them give you a cost that includes the casket and have the costs itemized. Once they quote you a price, get the parents to agree to cover the rest of the cost. Subtract the cost of the casket from the funeral home quote and find out the address to the location where the casket has to be shipped.

Take a final look at the quote to make sure the casket cost quoted has been removed and that the family will cover whatever is left. Then have the casket company chosen ship the one you want to the funeral home.  Some can do it overnight even if they're not local. They're usually very nice and it will be much less expensive. 

Don't let the parents choose which casket to buy--or give them some specific choices that fall within the price range you want to pay. You get to be in control and you can keep the peace with the parents. Good  luck."

 in the long run. I wonder about whether cafeterias should be replaced with grazing stations that let kids make their own sandwiches and salads  instead of serving up flavorless pre-cooked dishes that are destined for the garbage bin.

Using your idea that eating something is usually better than eating nothing, kids might find it easier to tolerate a meal they put together out of ingredients they like (including condiments and sauces for flavor) even if it means eating the same thing everyday.  Concoction competitions might make it fun and might help with planning the necessary ingredients to provide based on what the kids themselves have chosen.

Still, I can't pretend to have the best solution that will solve this problem (particularly since a well-meaning First Lady couldn't fix it).
