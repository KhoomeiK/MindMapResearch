wholesomebpt,ffj7fe8,t1_ffj25ub,1579992271.0,"Sometimes I feel like the website tends to show its age overall a lot of the time and I feel like at this point I really need to be less and less on here. 

To be 16 again and edgy and not caring about anything else but my opinion. Ahhh"
wholesomebpt,ffj785v,t1_ffj5m56,1579992132.0,LOL Getting attacked in real life. Get real. It’s not like you guys even say some shit that’s worth saying. Then you end it with mongoloid lmaoooooooooo. Yeah dude surely people will respect your edgy ass opinion now. Go back to your fucking trash of a sub.
wholesomebpt,ffj70o4,t1_ffizs58,1579991986.0,"You know there’s literally 10 comments under yours saying the same shit. Do you guys not bother checking before posting your dumb ass take? I’m not religious, but I remember when I was 15 and this edgy about god. Once you get older you realize sometimes we gotta live with others and meet in the middle. So what if he believes in god? You think all doctors are atheist and nurses as well? Religion is still a thing man even for those that see through the thin veil bs. 

It’s not hard to understand some people need a motivation to get through life and have a purpose.  God is that for some and not for others."
