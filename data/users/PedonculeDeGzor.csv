And yeah, you would be in the right if you reported him, but you didn't complain to him, you didn't miss anything because of this, you only lost 20 minutes sitting in a bus driving around a probably nice scenery.

You on the other hand (and your family to an extent) are also TA because you basically favoritised your other children over your daughter while she might already feel separated from the others by the fact that they are not blood related. The best option would have been to give up on the vacation completely, and sadly lose the money.

The problem is that this situation has been created by your ex, but now that you have failed your daughter, she won't support you against her mother in this, and in her eyes you're probably the one and only responsible of this.

You're making a very good point. I agree that if they are able to create some sideboardable snow hate, astrolabe won't need a ban. But right now, I think it's problematic and we will probably not see snow related cards before long (possibly not before MH2)"
