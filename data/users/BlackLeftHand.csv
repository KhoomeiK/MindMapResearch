I am about to go drink a black coffee to take the edge off, and I hate black coffee, but this is killing me."

I hate that fucking thing."
AmItheAsshole,ffm6tsx,t1_ffknd2q,1580049518.0,"Ouch, that's tough.  I hate the crying too, I feel stupid crying when I'm furious because I feel like it makes me look weak or like I'm being manipulative.  I've always kind of wished I could just get mad and then be done, but it looks like that isn't the way to go either."
AmItheAsshole,ffiyl1b,t1_ffir9fu,1579985905.0,"I too cry for ALL the reasons.  Most recently, at the trailer for the new Ghostbusters movie.  I don't even know, but I know you understand.

That said, I'm the first one to tell my husband I'm crying because (dumb reason), and to please ignore that and focus on the conversation at hand.  I can't imagine using my easy tears to get what I want, that's sociopath stuff!"
