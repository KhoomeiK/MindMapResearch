SandersForPresident,fffuwy2,t3_etcsjy,1579892331.0,"We learned in psych 101 of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Basically stated that people strive to achieve a certain set of goals for happiness with the each step being required before they can move on to the next.

The first thing people need to be happy are their physical needs like sleep and food, then comes saftey which os achieves with money and security in your life.  Without the proper funds to be able to survive, people can never focus on the next steps of self actualization, self esteem, and love.

For a country that brags aboit being the ""greatest"" we like to shoot ourselves in the foot alot. A truly great nation would realize that by providing for its denizens and sexuring thier futures is an investment in themselves and humanity as a whole."
