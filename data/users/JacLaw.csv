Soups, noodles, skimmed milk and non fat or low fat yoghurt, cereal and I can't remember what else.

Stuff that's easy to make and doesn't involve a lot of standing around, always have a glass of water before you eat, trim the visible fat off meat, don't eat the skin on chicken etc. Try to have some chopped or grated raw veggies and frozen grapes to snack on.

You might have a screen recorder app on your device as well.

Maybe it's time to stop taking his shit. My father was an abusive a hole, among other things, I gave up trying to have a relationship with him when I realised that by taking his calls and listening to his shitty comments and abusive language I was complicit in my own abuse.

I stopped enabling him and stuck up for myself. You need to do the same, while he may have the right to speak to his own children when they are minors, that right becomes a privilege when they are old enough to choose.

It doesn't matter if he's calling to speak to you, younger siblings or your grandchildren. As the adult you have a legal and moral obligation to protect those children from abuse, no matter what form that takes.  To protect them its important that you lay down the new rules and stick to them. Message him before he calls and tell him that raising his voice, name calling, bullying and his other antics won't be tolerated any longer. When he calls remind him that this is to be a pleasant call home or whatever, as doon as he starts his shit tell him if he says one more bad thing you'll hang up. And you have to hang up, it's more important than you realise.

Do you want those kids growing up seeing behaviour like that going unchecked. Do you want them to grow up acting like him and treating their children like that? How eoukd you feel seeing your grandchildren subjected to that kind of shit? Never mind recording him, you have to put a stop to his abusive shit."
