They can be affected by gravity and can have gravitational feilds and those things play out on their own in real time.

You fix that by shooting the power mad lunatics or at least limiting their legal protection. Developed nations don't have those issues because we at least pretend to keep our cops on a short leash and enforce some degree of honor. Something like this is the only way to get the US cops to see sense. Once their death rates start climbing as a result of these draconian laws, then maybe they will see the benefit of working with the legal system to protect their community. Honestly, at this point it should just be open season on cops. You wear gang colors, expect to get treated like a gang member. Plenty of good cops would make great firemen or teachers."

If the US had a reasonably justice system that was able to handle corrupt cops then all would be well, but we don't so now we have this. Some cops are absolutely going to get killed as a result of this law, but I'd rather they die that some innocent civilians which is what is happening right now. Maybe after a few years of dead cops, they will realise they actually need to police themselves."

But isn't that the point of dressing up? Your friends shouldn't give two shits how you dress or act; and to use an overused sentiment, they won't if they really are your friends. And plenty of women wish they could date their gay best friend, turns out it's pretty great having a partner into the same stuff as them (i.e. beauty and fasion). As for women thinking you're gay, they will know if you are into them, in my experience they know before I do. I wouldn't worry about it, worst case scenario they try to set you up with their gay friend."
