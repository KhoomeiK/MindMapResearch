A guy often becomes infinitely more attractive by being interesting or funny, so don’t underestimate the power of striking up a conversation."

AskReddit,ff2iit9,t1_ff0wf9q,1579507649.0,"Maybe this is a cultural thing, but I would be pretty put off if I was asked for my number in the very first sentence. I understand that the message here is usually “I want to have sex with you and I’m not interested in anything else”, but sheesh, at least ask my name first. Feels like I’m being chosen from a shelf in the supermarket."

It’s also a good idea to have a testable hypothesis."

todayilearned,feoqaq4,t1_feoljsj,1579303871.0,"Seriously. “Semmelweis could offer no acceptable scientific explanation for his findings, and some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and mocked him for it. In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Semmelweis supposedly suffered a nervous breakdown and was treacherously committed to an asylum by his colleague. He died a mere 14 days later, at the age of 47, after being beaten by the guards, from a gangrenous wound on his right hand which might have been caused by the beating.” - Wiki"

AskReddit,feg9xwb,t1_feg7avb,1579084156.0,"That was my view the first time I went through this, in my late teens. But over the years I’ve come to realise - true or not (and I usually don’t think it is true - it’s just an insidious lie depression tells you, and depression isn’t anyones default setting), it’s just not a useful way to view the world. So I flipped it - if everything is so meaningless and fleeting, why not just stop taking everything so seriously, and just try enjoy things while/when I can? Not that depression allows you to enjoy much, but anhedonia is part of the illness - and that’s the part of depression I railed against. I wanted to enjoy things again, anything.

I think as we get older, this crushing sense that there HAS TO be some meaning to it all, that we’re here “for a reason” sets in and if we don’t figure out that reason and work to improve things, it was all for nothing and we’ve failed. But it’s already all for nothing, there is no failing! So try embrace the void I guess. It’s not easy, but few things are and it’s something to focus on while your body tries to rebuild your strength."
AskReddit,feg5cui,t3_eoz05j,1579077668.0,"Honestly, sometimes you just have to wait it out. I’ve had at least two very dark periods in my life, but the second time it happened (and for no apparent reason) I sorta realised what was happening and just tried to help myself get through it as best I could. I tried to eat and sleep better (or as well as I could on any given day) and attempted to get out of the house when I could, but didn’t force myself or blame myself if I couldn’t do something. Basically I treated it like an illness. You wouldn’t feel bad for staying in bed and not going to a party if you had the flu, so it was pointless beating myself up. 

That said - it didn’t work most days. The healthy food still tasted like ashes, still couldn’t sleep/slept too much, I still felt worthless and guilty for not being able to do things, everything still felt pointless - *but* I was able to realise that that *wasn’t me*, those were “depressed thoughts” my brain was feeding me. I knew I hadn’t always felt that way and started looking forward to a time when I’d feel better. I clung to that idea like a life raft. Every time I’d think about something grim/how shit things were, I’d also include the thought - and I can’t wait until things get better. Again, I’m not saying this was easy or a solution to anything, just that it helped me weather the storm. Four years on now and I’m feeling like I’m finally back to myself. Depression will trick you into thinking you can “finally see clearly”, that your cynicism and thinking the worst about everything is somehow beneficial, that other people are idiots for believing in anything or being happy, and like you’re the only one who knows this “secret” that everything’s shit and pointless."
