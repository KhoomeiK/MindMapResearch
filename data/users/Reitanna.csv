what about my post did you not understand? why are you telling me sex and gender are two different things after what i wrote? did you not read passed the first sentence?

no, this ""traps are transgender"" thing is new. the REAL definition is that traps are feminine framed guys (male or female, doesn't matter because i already showed in my post that obviously a female can be born a man, seriously, did you even read) who dress like girls so that they appear to be girls. they crossdress. trans women who dress like girls are NOT crossdressers! if a trans woman dresses like a guy, she is crossdressing, making her a REVERSE trap, and i've known many girls, all female, who were reverse traps. i've also met real traps online who hate that people don't know the real definition. when drag queens go by ""she"" or ""her,"" it's because their crossdressing side is an alter ego with her own name and personality, haven't you seen rupal's drag race? there are also masculine men who crossdress rugularly, but are not traps because they still look manly enough, but like anyone else, don't care about what people think and wear what they want. what you're saying is that a male who is a woman, who dresses like a girl, isn't a girl? doesn't matter if she's pre-op or post-op, it doesn't matter if she chooses not to get a sex change, SHE IS A WOMAN, and dressing like a girl makes her just like any female girl who dress like girls! how hard is that to understand? like i said, the ONLY time a trap is transgender is when a trans man (a female who is a man) dresses like a girl, because he is crossdressing, and because he's female, will naturally have a feminine frame, unless he was born a more masculine female, then he is just a crossdresser and not a trap. how the hell can you not understand that? i made it obvious that i know the difference between sex and gender, but YOU seem not to. ""transgender"" shouldn't even exist. it makes them sound like they're different from the rest of us. no. a male who is a woman is a woman, and a female who is a man is a man. period. they should be called men and women like the rest of us... unless of course they don't identify with the two ""main"" (for lack of a better word) genders. i've seen people who identify as ""they/them,"" and even people who identify as an ""it."" so i think you should reread my post VERY SLOOOOOOOOWLY, and then truly ask yourself if you understand the concept of gender at all, because if you claim traps are transgender women, you are just saying trans women are just gay men trying to trick men into having sex with them, and that's WRONG. i also expect an apology for not reading my post properly and trying to explain something i've been perfectly aware of for MANY years."

AskReddit,fem3908,t3_epkaux,1579238296.0,"well, this isn't really that big, but it's the only thing i can think of. i've been banned by a website, but they won't actually tell me what i did wrong. my ticket is being handled by one admin who is making sure i don't get a chance to talk to anyone else on the staff. i even have proof that i didn't do anything wrong, but they kept giving me this bull, ""you've been told not to upload inappropriate content."" they won't tell me what i uploaded that was inappropriate. the best part is that, when someone uploads something inappropriate, the staff takes it down and gives you a chance to dispute it, and you can ask what was wrong about it so that you know that it's not allowed (some of the rules aren't the clearest, and sometimes they contradict their own rules). this person banned me before i had a chance to dispute it, which is the system that prevents users from being banned as soon as the upload is taken down in case of misunderstandings, which i've had before.

this isn't the first time, though. the staff on this site has done this so many times to so many people, there are users collecting people's stories and screenshots from tickets. they've been like this for years, but i never thought i'd get banned and NOT told why. i believe it's a personal attack, and this person just wanted to take everything away from me to satisfy their own pettiness.

edit: wait, i DO have a bigger one. i was physically abused by my mother as a child, and when i was a teenager, she'd beat the shit out of me, and whether i tried to defend myself or not, she'd call the police on ME. one time she did this, my arm was freely bleeding from her digging her nails into it, and i showed the stupid cop, but he just asked if i was pregnant or something, like i was some kind of hooligan. i was in a goth phase, but i was only rebellious in my clothing, i didn't do drugs and my grades were very high. i was extremely well behaved. i kept trying to tell the cop what she did to my arm, but i was sent to my room. i overheard the cop telling her that she was allowed to hit me as long as it was with an open hand. i have NEVER trusted the police since then, and that was over ten years ago. and to be clear, i'm a weak little white girl, so racism had nothing to do with this one. i still have the scars from that wound."
aww,fem2g8w,t3_eptiib,1579237556.0,"i didn't have the volume on, so i don't know what was said, but watching it in silence made this just plain creepy."
Petscop,fem28hv,t1_fem0omk,1579237361.0,wow. what a let down. i truly don't understand how anyone is satisfied with the supposed ending. it's not logical.
Petscop,fem24ce,t1_fem1v2x,1579237260.0,um... what?
Petscop,fem0hgx,t1_felzsg3,1579235828.0,"whatever post you're talking about, i never saw it"
AskReddit,fem0fdr,t3_epn15l,1579235779.0,i stand there confused because i don't have anything to cause any of those people to raid my apartment.
socialanxiety,fem08zq,t3_epigcp,1579235632.0,yes. i have absolutely no friends in person where i live. it drives me nuts.
Vent,fem05yt,t3_eprhhq,1579235560.0,"it's like saying, ""yeah, my father raped me, but he's my father, so i still love him.""

one of my uncles is a child molester, and last time i visited that side on my family, he was in jail for the THIRD TIME for molesting children. my grandparents on that side are rich, and they kept bailing him out despite the fact that the family is huge and is mostly all children. i wanted to shake my grandmother and say, ""YOUR SON IS A PEDOPHILE!! STOP ALLOWING HIM TO KEEP DOING IT!! YOU'RE NOT OBLIGATED TO LOVE HIM!!"" then again, that woman is absolutely insane..."
