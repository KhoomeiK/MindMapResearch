I only made it modular because my 3d printer struggles with bigger pieces.  That said I think it looks nice and makes it easier to reorder.

I didn't provide a common gnd/VCC,  and I should just chain them.  Less wires.

The mounting faces are 2mm thick, 3mm around the edge, they flex a bit.  Any longer and they would need to be thicker.

I have a small OLED screen which shows the last changed value.  Not shown here 

Watch out for log pots, I need to replace some of mine.   Grrr banggood."
