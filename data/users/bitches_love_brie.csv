Don't get me wrong, I can't fucking stand most of the dopers I deal with. But that's because they can't figure out how to use without disturbing others, and consequently, getting the police called. Using your drug of choice is your issue. If you want to get high, do it in the privacy of your or your friend's house. Don't OD, and don't call me to tell me that there's someone in your attic talking to you. If you have a substance abuse problem, you need treatment just as badly as the lawyer who is an alcoholic. No better, no worse in my opinion. It's your issue. But those aren't the ones I deal with, obviously. 

I believe that places that offer needle exchange should do it on the condition that the user needs to participate in some kind of treatment. Whether that's meetings, or whatever, I don't care. If you're only providing the means to continue the habit, that seems a little closer to enabling rather than harm reduction. 

Also, most agencies don't have any type of quota and most, if not all states in the US, specifically ban quotas. Some agencies still do it, don't get me wrong. But it's a hell of a lot simpler to write a speeding ticket than it is to arrest a drug user. Even if I was trying to meet a quota, actively seeking out people that might be high, dopesick, homeless, and will definitely have a bunch of property to deal with is not something I'd be doing. That's my own selfish reason, on top of it being a pretty shitty thing to do.

So, being the dutiful civil servant I am, I contact him. He explained that he didn't have any more, proudly claiming that he smoked at his friends house *just* before driving home.

Hey weed smokers! You shouldn't drive after smoking weed! You don't get to excitedly claim that it has all these benefits while ignoring that it also has scientifically proven effects on your driving ability, reaction time, and decision making. Yes, weed can be enjoyable to use recreationally and maybe it even has some positive health benefits. Great! But you still have to use it responsibly, otherwise you're part of the problem."

Generally speaking, the car needs to stay running due to the multiple electronic systems that are all running while the car is in service. If I shut the car off, I only get about 5 minutes before my computer and gos shut down. After ten, the radio turns off automatically. 

That said, our cars have a feature called Safe Stop. When activated by toggle switch, I can take the keys out and the engine runs, keeping all my stuff turned on. Without the key, the car automatically shuts off if the brake or accelerator are pressed (which you'd need to do to shift it out of Park). 

It's not an expensive feature. Why it isn't standard equipment on police vehicles I'll never understand. Even if it costs $100 per car, it's still cheaper to outfit the entire fleet than to replace an entire cruiser..."

Whatcouldgowrong,ffbf2f0,t1_ffbdjtv,1579762509.0,"An automatic AK-47 would need a blank firing adapter in order to function with blanks. Basically, it's a plug that attaches to the end of the barrel in order to force high-pressure gas back into the gun (simulating what happens when you're using bullets) and allowing it to cycle. 

So yes, the barrel would be plugged and would make it relatively safe, for being an AK-47. You still shouldn't shoot it at people, just in case, but yes it's pretty safe. 

People have been killed by blank rounds. Usually, that because there's an obstruction of some kind inside the barrel that is forced out at high speed when the blank is fired, effectively making it a bullet."

Don't get me wrong, I can't fucking stand most of the dopers I deal with. But that's because they can't figure out how to use without disturbing others, and consequently, getting the police called. Using your drug of choice is your issue. If you want to get high, do it in the privacy of your or your friend's house. Don't OD, and don't call me to tell me that there's someone in your attic talking to you. If you have a substance abuse problem, you need treatment just as badly as the lawyer who is an alcoholic. No better, no worse in my opinion. It's your issue. But those aren't the ones I deal with, obviously. 

I believe that places that offer needle exchange should do it on the condition that the user needs to participate in some kind of treatment. Whether that's meetings, or whatever, I don't care. If you're only providing the means to continue the habit, that seems a little closer to enabling rather than harm reduction. 

Also, most agencies don't have any type of quota and most, if not all states in the US, specifically ban quotas. Some agencies still do it, don't get me wrong. But it's a hell of a lot simpler to write a speeding ticket than it is to arrest a drug user. Even if I was trying to meet a quota, actively seeking out people that might be high, dopesick, homeless, and will definitely have a bunch of property to deal with is not something I'd be doing. That's my own selfish reason, on top of it being a pretty shitty thing to do.

That said, our cars have a feature called Safe Stop. When activated by toggle switch, I can take the keys out and the engine runs, keeping all my stuff turned on. Without the key, the car automatically shuts off if the brake or accelerator are pressed (which you'd need to do to shift it out of Park).
