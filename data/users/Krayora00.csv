NoStupidQuestions,fewlo33,t1_fet9fgh,1579413810.0,People from Asia loves American university. You sound just like every other foreigner. Trying to be the cool kid by hating on America. Open up a ranked list of universities and tell me how many American universities are in the top 10. Even 15. I’ll wait.
NoStupidQuestions,fewlgkv,t1_fesyjzi,1579413599.0,"All of the Ivy Leagues are some of the best schools in the world. Almost all of them make top 10 in any university ranking list. Most Ivy League kids end up in Wall Street making millions or going the politics route. Don’t forget about UC Berkeley and Stanford as well. Those schools are pretty much direct pipelines to jobs at Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Google, etc. So many people from Asia would die to attend American universities. If you look at universities ranking, America has 8 universities in the top 10."
NoStupidQuestions,fewl5ng,t1_fes5ar4,1579413294.0,"So many people in Asia know top American schools like the Ivy Leagues. Stanford is also one of the most prestigious school in the world. Most of the students in Asia would rather attend an American school than a UK school. Also, I see SO MANY international kids at the UC schools like UCLA and UC Berkeley. USC as well."

FinancialCareers,fektqqr,t1_fekt488,1579207418.0,"Networking is definitely important. Knowing the right person can give you a leg up when it comes to getting a job. I’ve had friends who had subpar grades but were able to land a full time position at banks and companies because they knew someone from the inside. However, you definitely don’t have to be popular to learn how to network. It’s a skill that anyone can pick up. You might not be good at it at first but with enough practice you’ll be a master in no time. That’s not to say that networking is the only way to get a good job. If your grades are good, have experience and you can interview well then you’ll have a strong chance of landing a job too."

college,fe08m54,t3_enj55m,1578806055.0,"I feel this too. Honestly, I feel like time is going by faster as I grow older. It’s kinda scary. For those of you who are about to start college or are still in college, really try to embrace and have fun in college. I know it sounds cheesy, but this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet other people your age, learn what you’re interested in, and trying out new things that you never thought you would ever do. The real world is whole other monster. Once you enter that world, not everyone will be your age and it’s so much harder to make friends. Plus, it’s a lot harder to try new things when you’re working 9-5..."

USC also has its own private shuttle from Union to the campus that takes about 10 mins according to their website.

csuf,fdid4mt,t1_fdi3ciq,1578440190.0,"Most top tier UCs will provide better opportunities for their students compared to a cal state. They have more funding. I agree with you that it all depends on the persons major as well. However, if you’re a stem major then going to a UC will be a better move. On the other hand, those who are interested in business will thrive better at csuf unless they were accepted to UCB/UCLA/UCI. May I ask what you’re majoring in?"
csuf,fdg3rt1,t1_fdfrt28,1578378909.0,"You really can’t compare csuf to schools like UCLA, UCB, UCI, UCSD, UCSB, and UC Davis. Ucla is definitely not the same as csuf...The only thing I can see making csuf shine is their accounting program. Even then, you can get a better accounting deal at schools like uci or UCLA for accounting plus a better social life. Maybe it’s just me but when I visited csuf to hang with my friends, I found the campus to be a very commuter centric school. There were definitely some parts that looked great, though.

Edit: I’d expect to get downvoted at a csuf subreddit lol"
csuf,fdewdhu,t1_fddbxi2,1578347980.0,"UCs are definitely harder than csuf. The only UCs I can see as comparable to csuf is ucr and UC Merced. Also, the price tag for UCs is pretty reasonable. They have resources that CSUs don’t."
