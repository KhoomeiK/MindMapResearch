worldofgothic,ff90pz2,t3_es0yha,1579701896.0,sekiro combat is extremely difficult and unforgiving for those that are timing and reaction challenged. I think it would be too much for many people used to the typical eurojank combat.
AskMenOver30,ff5t924,t3_erstkz,1579609387.0,"About 10 years ago I was at a large family gather hosted by my parents who were in their 70s. 2 generations of kids. We were all very comfortable with each other. Issues in past but that had been long since resolved. I remember thinking this can't possibly last. It did not. My father died a couple of years later. My mother never really recovered and she died about 2 years ago.

We are all pretty much going to die. There will not be any miracle cures. Our bodies will start breaking down as we age and the things that break or change will be much slower to recover if ever they do. This all sounds horrible and negative but it is the natural progression of life. Science will not save us. It may be a delay in the inevitable but death will happen anyway. 

""Memento Mori""

You may find it useful to meditate on your own upcoming death. Just to learn to be able to process it. For your dad, talk to him about death and see how he feels. As much as you have to process it, he has or will have to process it in the exact same way. The most we can ever hope for is to live a decent life. If your dad is 70+ and has family that cares for him, I'd say that's a pretty decent life."

The same will apply when inserting the bag. the insert probably pushes locking pins aside from the top and the bag allowing both plates to be pulled out.

DarkSoulsHelp,fdnqh56,t3_emc2jw,1578590891.0,"DS1 had a fantastic interconnected world. DS2 does not, except for the DLC which is also fantastic. DS3 goes back to the interconnected model. DS2 also changed the rolling mechanics. depending on armor and builds you may get different iframes and roll for different lengths. maybe not an issue for PvE but could be frustrating for PvP. DS2 also added some mechanics. petrified enemies which require branches to move past. all regular enemies  stop spawning after 9 kills or so, unless you join a covenant of champions for high difficulty solo play. also a soul memory matchmaking scheme which can make coop pvp difficult. DS3 reverted these changes. Still DS2 is very worth playing IMO"

Reincarnation,fdftnyp,t3_el32l2,1578369932.0,"The seth books by jane roberts have interesting discussions on this.   
The basic idea is that ""we"" create entirely the reality we experience.   
We ""share"" this with others who are interested in experiencing much the same. 
This has nothing to do with the physical mind, it has a completely different and separate role and desires.  
Rather this is through the movement of consciousness and the way it exists in different layers of personality, many of which are in our sub/unconscious.  
Our death is the last significant thing we will do on this earth.   
It can be viewed as a final commentary."
darksouls,fdf8ed0,t1_fdexdn1,1578355698.0,"To be fair, the DS2 DLC levels were fantastic.

True, there are some different paths to be found but for the most part they did away with the shortcuts that made DS1 give lots of great aha moments. And I... am one of the people that loved DS2. Oh, and they also botched SL and dodging but those are other issues."
Reincarnation,fdf31fk,t3_ekrn1t,1578352163.0,"the general idea is that everything we experience is an interaction if intelligent information. This includes people, things, ideas, particles, everything. consciousness is the continual change of how we experience different information. ideas are just as alive as anything else. They use people to champion them and make them stronger. physical form is only one way that ideas enter this world. there are an infinite number of other ways. you are an energy pattern. everything is an energy pattern. going ""physical"" is a change of form. so this all sounds nonsensical but its a complex topic. On other levels everything here is a dream. If someone asked about the things in your dreams you may answer that it is all a creation of your mind. In the same way the physical can be viewed as a creation of a mind. just not our physical mind."
