analog,fem4kj1,t3_epw4l2,1579239544.0,So I recently acquired this puppy and half of my roll was scratched. I read a few forums and consulted a few people and came down to three things: 1. The rolls where the film goes over are worth (if so any suggestions to clean it?) 2. There are burrs on my film back (not sure how to look for those) 3. Was advancing my film too quickly when going from one exposure to the next. Any feedback would be amazing as I love shooting medium format (this is my first camera) and don’t want to have to photoshop / lose my images to streaks / scratches. Thank you!!
