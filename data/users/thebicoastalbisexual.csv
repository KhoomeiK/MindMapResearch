lyftdrivers,fgk9uis,t1_fgk6t65,1580860637.0,I roll down the front windows the second I see a pax is smoking. Nauseating smell.

lyftdrivers,fgg3jxx,t3_ey5gc7,1580753486.0,4 star them every time they don’t tip. They probably won’t start tipping but at least their rating will go down and you won’t be taking pax out of a small market.
FreeCompliments,fgg35mq,t3_ey6kpx,1580753246.0,You’re gorgeous!

Assistance,fgabmmi,t3_exijgs,1580649265.0,$27 to go towards a new pair of shoes would be so helpful! I’ve been wearing mine for 4 years and the sole is about 45% detached on my right shoe. Was going to buy new ones but I had to pay $98 for my Economics book.

When you are financially able, you can give your future children the best advantages in life. I hope one day you see that you did a very selfless thing and you can be proud of your choice."
AskReddit,fg8jwpu,t3_exc0k6,1580621826.0,"I don’t know, but finding out the lie that my mom and step dad let me believe my biological dad r*ped me as a toddler after nearly 30 years was pretty devastating. Just so fucked up to let me think that."
lyftdrivers,fg7vzqe,t3_exde7c,1580602874.0,"I never talk to them unless they initiate a conversation. Usually get good tip ratios.

Sometimes people tip for a quiet, noninvasive ride.
Sometimes people tip because of connecting through conversation.

Just depends on the person."
