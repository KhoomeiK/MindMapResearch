Games,ff5g5xo,t1_ff45nfw,1579591428.0,It’s for the better. Ubi games were reviewing poorly and all doing the same routines in every game. The delay was for some innovation.

xboxone,fduxm5z,t1_fdqjmpv,1578740613.0,"I always thought Ubisoft was the best world makers. 

Their open world games are ALWAYS so big and beautiful. 

I feel like if Ubisoft built the open world, and Rockstar filled it/did everything else, it would be the greatest game ever. 

When it comes to making a big beautiful open world, Ubisoft KILLS it. As mentioned before though..usually they just make it big as possible which eventually starts to bring diminishing returns when the world gets too big to fill."

Do you have any credible sources for this? If he was on meth all the time, I feel like it would be more commonly acknowledged. 

Again, not saying you’re wrong, but to just blurt it out like it’s fact, is it actually true?"

You and anyone below who agreed with you are bat shit insane.

The only way things will get better is if people rebel and murder everybody in charge?

Your answer to today’s problems is another civil war? Give me a break.

And if it ever did come to that, people like you would be last in line to come out from behind their computers to fight.  The people in this thread are insane."

I’d say a good 20% of my words, maybe even more, are spelled wrong and I don’t care because I can just hit the space bar and it will fix itself.

When I finally type on a computer after texting so much, it’s pretty much jarring at first, because I can’t just hastily spell everything out and let the software clean it up for me lol."

pcmasterrace,fcuopcf,t1_fcumgrb,1577985453.0,"This is beyond true and me and my buddy just had this conversation the other day!

MMO’s ALWAYS have guilds that solely dedicate their time to helping people out.

And if you don’t want to join a guild for whatever reason, usually if you put in Trade/Area/World chat that you have a question or need help, 99 times out of 100 someone will either send you what you need (within reason) or come help you.

I used to see it constantly in WoW and see it all the time in ESO."

I mean..hell if I know..but I’d imagine on land where water isn’t a problem, the lion would be able to easily take the croc. Due to its size, power, and speed.

The croc has power, but mostly in its jaws (those stubby arms can’t do much can they?) and it only has speed in water, right? 

I don’t know, this is just my guess! Lol"
