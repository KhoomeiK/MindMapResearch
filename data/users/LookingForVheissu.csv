I’m against refusing to care for the people we lock up, I’m against refusing clothing, bathing, and food.

Keep reading if you’d like a larger list of all the reasons this is god damned ridiculous. Don’t separate kids. Don’t lock people in cages. We have so many humane ways of treating this situation, but we resort to treating people like dogs. 

> By early June 2018, it emerged that the policy did not include measures to reunite the families that it had separated. This created a child migration crisis.

>Since June 2018, despite the official end of the separation policy, hundreds of additional children have been separated from their parents. In March 2019, the government reported that since that time, 245 children had been removed from their families, in some cases without clear documentation undertaken to track them in order to reunite them with their parents.

> In June 2019, a group of attorneys who are involved with the Flores settlement visited a Border Patrol center in Clint, Texas. The children told the lawyers that meals consisted of instant oatmeal, a cookie and sweetened drink for breakfast, instant noodles for lunch, and a heated frozen burrito and a cookie for dinner. They said they had not had a clean change of clothing or a bath for weeks. There were no adult caretakers, ten- and fourteen-year-old girls were taking care of the younger ones.

> In the past, most migrants illegally crossing the border came almost entirely from Mexico; however, the current influx now includes greater numbers of women and children fleeing violence, gang recruitment, and sexual trafficking in the Northern Triangle of Central America countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Rather than illegally crossing into the US, they are presenting themselves at the border hoping to claim asylum, which they were legally entitled to do under certain circumstances. The Trump administration claims the family separation policy is directed at those migrants who illegally cross the U.S. border but they have decided to charge everyone crossing the border with illegal entry. They also charge asylum seekers in criminal court rather than waiting to see if they qualify for asylum.

> Children's mental health has had a strong correlation with forced parent–child separation and parental loss which has led to potential traumatic events (PTEs). Research has found that ""forced parent–child separation and parental loss are PTEs with adverse effects on child mental health and academic functioning"". Reports show that children who have experienced PTEs from parent deportation have been more prone to being diagnosed with PTSD. 

> The costs of separating migrant children from their parents and keeping them in ""tent cities"" are higher than keeping them with their parents in detention centers. It costs $775 per person per night to house the children when they are separated but $256 per person per night when they are held in permanent HHS facilities and $298 per person per night to keep the children with their parents in ICE detention centers.

> To handle the large amount of immigration charges brought by the Trump administration, federal prosecutors had to divert resources from other crime cases. The head of the Justice Department's major crimes unit in San Diego diverted staff from drug smuggling cases. Drug smuggling cases were also increasingly pursued in state courts rather than federal courts, as federal prosecutor were increasingly preoccupied with pursuing charges against illegal border crossings. In October 2018, USA Today reported that federal drug-trafficking prosecutions on the Southern border plummeted, as prosecutorial resources were diverted to the family separation policy.

>It was reported in June 2018, that the Trump administration plans to pay Texas non-profit Southwest Key Programs Inc. more than $458 million in the fiscal year of 2018 to care for immigrant children detained crossing the US border illegally.

>In July 2018, it was reported that HHS had diverted at least $40 million from its health programs to care for and reunify migrant children, and that the HHS was preparing to shift more than $200 million from other HHS accounts. In September 2018, it was reported that the Trump administration planned to shift more than $260 million from HHS programs, including those on cancer research and HIV/AIDS research, to cover the costs associated with detaining children and delaying releasing them to adults."

In the new Trek movies had themes running through them that are similar to the original Trek movies. Kirk growing up too fast. Spock having a loss of purpose. Multi racial relationships that demonstrate how separate values can come together and find a middle ground. 

The core of the stories of Star Trek are still there. Hope and idealism drive both the Abramsverse and Discovery. The crew of Discovery, Pike, Admiral Cornwell, Spock all made cases for the idealism if the Federation and fought to keep it alive even when it was easier to take the more violent route. 

And they already had space battles and humanity as the enemy with DS9, none of these things are new. Section 31, the Maquis, and the Dominion all had space battles and humans as the enemies. This isn’t *new,* just better effects.

movies,ff39use,t1_ff2xx6j,1579537070.0,"They do care about the heart of Star Trek. One of the visions of DS9 was that the Federation isnâ€™t always the good guy, and they played that up in Discovery. In the new Trek movies had themes running through them that are similar to the original Trek movies. Kirk growing up too fast. Spock having a loss of purpose. Multi racial relationships that demonstrate how separate values can come together and find a middle ground. 

The core of the stories of Star Trek are still there. Hope and idealism drive both the Abramsverse and Discovery. The crew of Discovery, Pike, Admiral Cornwell, Spock all made cases for the idealism if the Federation and fought to keep it alive even when it was easier to take the more violent route. 

And they already had space battles and humanity as the enemy with DS9, none of these things are new. Section 31, the Maquis, and the Dominion all had space battles and humans as the enemies. This isnâ€™t *new,* just better effects.

movies,ff2ukuu,t1_ff2pc34,1579524758.0,"Iâ€™ll refer to a couple points specifically, then generally. 

>1.	â Terminator is nothing but constant reboots that muck with the timeline; itâ€™s a confusing mess

If you head over to r/Terminator everyone now enjoys the sequels that arenâ€™t Dark Fate. Which is odd because thematically itâ€™s the most consistent with the first two films. â€œItâ€™s in your nature to destroy yourselves,â€ Uncle Bob said in the second film, and it stands true. 

It follows a single characterâ€™s arch with a logical trend. Sarah Connor started out young and untested, a maiden. She had her entire future ahead of her and still held hope. In T2 she was the mother. She had purpose and again, hope. In Dark Fate she was a crone. She won the war but lost everything. Her sole purpose of raising John was lost to her, and she had no purpose except revenge, and she earned that back. 

Itâ€™s not the greatest in the franchise, but reading about the â€œSJW agendaâ€ in a series of film thatâ€™s always been about a female protagonist is weird. Reading how this ruins T2 with the twist opening is ridiculous and diminishing that the story has been about Sarah more than John, even though John WAS a protagonist. 

>2.	â Star Wars final trilogy was approached without much of a plan beyond â€œno one will understand who Anakin is so make all new stuffâ€, and â€œletâ€™s make like a thousand Death Stars!â€

Just like in the successful EU books? Or EU video games? War engines have been a theme throughout Star Wars. Why are we surprised they continued?

>3.	â And Star Trek is being twisted further and further away from being about humanity at its best facing aliens that represent our darkest tendencies in complex moral delimmas into â€œspace pew pewâ€

I feel as though you didnâ€™t even watch the movies. They are no more action packed than Wrath of Khan, which is often regarded as one of the best. And to dismiss the humanity is to ignore Spockâ€™s plight through the entire series which gains spotlight through his relationship with Uhura. Or Kirkâ€™s growth from reckless youth to starting to age. Or how the Federation isnâ€™t faultless, which was a theme through DS9. 

>We dont hate the franchises we love. We donâ€™t like the way theyâ€™re being managed. Thatâ€™s not an audience problem, itâ€™s a Hollywood problem. 

Itâ€™s not though. These movies have all been successful to various degrees. Theyâ€™re a fans who donâ€™t like the newest entries problem. 

>Marvel is doing everything right. Theyâ€™re sticking true to their characters and delivering on what people are expecting. There is a way to do this stuff well.

Theyâ€™re still new in the grand scheme of things though. Thatâ€™s like saying DCU will never get it right. There isnâ€™t been enough time for Marvel reboot. 

I understand that there is emotion and sentimentality to originals, but retelling stories is a tradition as old as mankind. I see no reason it should stop, and many of these are not just Hollywood cash grabs. No one complains that the original Dracula was remade. Or that Beowulf has been told a hundred times. Or that James Bond has been recast how many times now? Or that Spider-Man is now on his third version (or maybe itâ€™s just because we *love* what marvel has done we forgive them?)? Or that Star Trek has had, what, five shows that all radically changed the direction of The Federation and redefined what it means to be a Star Trek show between 1960 and 2000? Or should we stop using concepts like Cinderella, Snow White, Beowulf? 

These are all a part of story telling. Telling. Retelling. Modernizing. Romanticizing source material. Itâ€™s not Hollywoodâ€™s fault, even if they are profiting off of it."

The Peacekeepers were a sort of mercenary group.
