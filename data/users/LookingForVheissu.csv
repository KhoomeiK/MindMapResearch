In the new Trek movies had themes running through them that are similar to the original Trek movies. Kirk growing up too fast. Spock having a loss of purpose. Multi racial relationships that demonstrate how separate values can come together and find a middle ground. 

The core of the stories of Star Trek are still there. Hope and idealism drive both the Abramsverse and Discovery. The crew of Discovery, Pike, Admiral Cornwell, Spock all made cases for the idealism if the Federation and fought to keep it alive even when it was easier to take the more violent route. 

And they already had space battles and humanity as the enemy with DS9, none of these things are new. Section 31, the Maquis, and the Dominion all had space battles and humans as the enemies. This isn’t *new,* just better effects.

movies,ff2ukuu,t1_ff2pc34,1579524758.0,"I’ll refer to a couple points specifically, then generally. 

>1.	⁠Terminator is nothing but constant reboots that muck with the timeline; it’s a confusing mess

If you head over to r/Terminator everyone now enjoys the sequels that aren’t Dark Fate. Which is odd because thematically it’s the most consistent with the first two films. “It’s in your nature to destroy yourselves,” Uncle Bob said in the second film, and it stands true. 

It follows a single character’s arch with a logical trend. Sarah Connor started out young and untested, a maiden. She had her entire future ahead of her and still held hope. In T2 she was the mother. She had purpose and again, hope. In Dark Fate she was a crone. She won the war but lost everything. Her sole purpose of raising John was lost to her, and she had no purpose except revenge, and she earned that back. 

It’s not the greatest in the franchise, but reading about the “SJW agenda” in a series of film that’s always been about a female protagonist is weird. Reading how this ruins T2 with the twist opening is ridiculous and diminishing that the story has been about Sarah more than John, even though John WAS a protagonist. 

>2.	⁠Star Wars final trilogy was approached without much of a plan beyond “no one will understand who Anakin is so make all new stuff”, and “let’s make like a thousand Death Stars!”

Just like in the successful EU books? Or EU video games? War engines have been a theme throughout Star Wars. Why are we surprised they continued?

>3.	⁠And Star Trek is being twisted further and further away from being about humanity at its best facing aliens that represent our darkest tendencies in complex moral delimmas into “space pew pew”

I feel as though you didn’t even watch the movies. They are no more action packed than Wrath of Khan, which is often regarded as one of the best. And to dismiss the humanity is to ignore Spock’s plight through the entire series which gains spotlight through his relationship with Uhura. Or Kirk’s growth from reckless youth to starting to age. Or how the Federation isn’t faultless, which was a theme through DS9. 

>We dont hate the franchises we love. We don’t like the way they’re being managed. That’s not an audience problem, it’s a Hollywood problem. 

It’s not though. These movies have all been successful to various degrees. They’re a fans who don’t like the newest entries problem. 

>Marvel is doing everything right. They’re sticking true to their characters and delivering on what people are expecting. There is a way to do this stuff well.

They’re still new in the grand scheme of things though. That’s like saying DCU will never get it right. There isn’t been enough time for Marvel reboot. 

I understand that there is emotion and sentimentality to originals, but retelling stories is a tradition as old as mankind. I see no reason it should stop, and many of these are not just Hollywood cash grabs. No one complains that the original Dracula was remade. Or that Beowulf has been told a hundred times. Or that James Bond has been recast how many times now? Or that Spider-Man is now on his third version (or maybe it’s just because we *love* what marvel has done we forgive them?)? Or that Star Trek has had, what, five shows that all radically changed the direction of The Federation and redefined what it means to be a Star Trek show between 1960 and 2000? Or should we stop using concepts like Cinderella, Snow White, Beowulf? 

These are all a part of story telling. Telling. Retelling. Modernizing. Romanticizing source material. It’s not Hollywood’s fault, even if they are profiting off of it."
