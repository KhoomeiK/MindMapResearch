3Dprinting,feu4m1m,t3_eqc19y,1579383047.0,A few other things you might want to check. Calibrate your extruder and also make sure it isn't skipping.
IAmA,feu31rp,t1_fesxxpm,1579382676.0,Walmart will also deliver!
3Dprinting,feu0cia,t1_feogrsz,1579381856.0,Accidentally purchased a roll of petg. Does that require the fan to be off? I haven't tried using it yet.
3Dprinting,fesx1ba,t1_fesu2ul,1579369805.0,Thanks. I was looking for the spiral file and thought it was a separate thingiverse thing. I have printed the normal one and want to try and print it as big as I can with the spiral version.

tmobile,fenas4h,t1_fen6v1w,1579280684.0,"Weird. I only get 2 messages a month. One saying that my bill is available, the amount, and the date the autopay is scheduled for. Then I get another one on the due date saying the payment was processed and that my balance is now 0. I'll get a promotional text once in a while but those come from a separate number."
tmobile,fen4h7a,t3_eq209j,1579276769.0,Did you get an alert saying your payment was processed as normal. I always get a text every month when my automatic payment goes through.
mildlyinteresting,fen3l4u,t1_fen2e0s,1579276209.0,No. Hard cider is more like carbonated alcoholic apple juice. Then we have something called sparking cider which is basically just carbonated apple juice. The distinction is that apples cider is not filtered like apple juice.
mildlyinteresting,femwg4s,t1_femlxxf,1579271398.0,I'm not talking about the alcoholic drink. That would be called hard cider here. I drink that as well. But I'm referring to just plain non-alcoholic apple cider.
mildlyinteresting,feltwd5,t1_felpwo0,1579230826.0,Is that not how it's traditionally drunk?
pitbulls,fel9pmg,t1_fel3my6,1579217132.0,"Comparing buying a dog from a breeder and having your own biological child are nowhere near comparable at all. If people stop buying from breeders then breeders will have to stop breeding as it's no longer profitable. As long as people are buying, they will keep breeding. The thing is you have to do your research and buy from a reputable breeder, not a backyard breeder."
MadeMeSmile,fel82yh,t1_fel7jri,1579216091.0,"You can choose to pick your up curbside as well and there is no extra fee. You pay what you would have paid in store. Sometimes even less. If you choose to allow substitutions if we're out of an item and we substitute your item for something of higher price, Walmart pays the difference."
mildlyinteresting,fel770a,t1_fel6mhc,1579215534.0,I'm sorry but I just can't imagine myself sipping a cup of hot water. I'm absolutely all about some hot apple cider though.
MadeMeSmile,fel6xu7,t1_fel5by6,1579215375.0,Walmart offers unlimited grocery delivery each month for a small monthly free. I believe it's 12.99 now. I find it much better than other services like instacart because they don't increase the price of their groceries for the service and there is no additional fees outside of a delivery fee. You just have to purchase a minimum of $35 of groceries.
Wellthatsucks,fekzkjb,t1_feko2z9,1579210882.0,Person like that probably doesn't have insurance info to give.
Frugal,fekjcux,t3_epdqga,1579201258.0,Did you dye the soles as well? They look darker.

3Dprinting,fec6479,t1_febyqpx,1578967261.0,When I'm worried about adhesion with small pieces I use hairspray. I can't tell if the blue is tape or not but I wouldn't use that either.
3Dprinting,febhy9l,t1_fe9y3s4,1578958990.0,The roll even says 3mm. If your printer wasn't meant to take 3mm filament you may just be out of luck.
3Dprinting,fea9br9,t3_eo82qe,1578945894.0,Looks like your bed is just a bit too high. Lower it just a bit.
3Dprinting,fea45jk,t1_fe8bdo0,1578944166.0,Surely you meant .16 layer height?
3Dprinting,fe92hki,t3_enz1gn,1578933444.0,Maybe try with a clean bed. A can see thick layers of gunk on it.

3Dprinting,fdzfpgr,t3_enfsnh,1578789773.0,Looks more like you're slightly to close to the bed. Level again. Also clean your bed with some isopropyl alcohol to make sure there's no finger smudges on it or anything.
3Dprinting,fdze0yh,t3_enfbo0,1578789369.0,I didn't know creality had their own resin printer. How is it?
3Dprinting,fdz7cr0,t1_fdxpkoh,1578787406.0,Unless he had the silent steppers. All I hear is the fan and it would actually help put me to sleep.
