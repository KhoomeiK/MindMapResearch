Discussion is great. But you didn't do anything like discussing my question. You basically just said ""no""."
halifax,fffav9m,t1_fff6yq0,1579879899.0,That was my point :)
halifax,ffes38n,t3_et0l9h,1579862820.0,Doesn't he have first-hand experience in what is being discussed? Why wouldn't people want to hear that perspective?
halifax,ffes18h,t1_ffe6h8a,1579862739.0,Really? Where are all the cigarette ads in that case?
halifax,fferte5,t1_ffecyyf,1579862415.0,"I almost did. I ended up agreeing with much of what they were saying, but that was a hell of a way to present it.

Edit: in fact, the well said rest of the comment is the only reason I didn't downvote for the unnecessary meanness."
halifax,fferqcv,t1_ffedd0z,1579862291.0,Alcoholism and gambling addictions have ruined so very many lives. It does feel wrong to me that a government is encouraging things that *can* be very harmful.
halifax,ffergsk,t1_ffe2l8v,1579861892.0,"Gee, I wonder why there might be such a difference

halifax,ffd9ndf,t1_ffd8a6p,1579816150.0,"Yes, intent is the key word. 10 years ago, I wouldn't have accused anyone of intentionally spreading misinformation. But it's not 10 years ago.

Also, I think (and could be wrong) the doctor was found to have committed fraud. So if that's the case, no, he wasn't spreading information he believed to be true. The people who initially believed his study were. The people who STILL believe it are being wilfully ignorant which requires intent.

Edit: and I think 10 years ago is being generous tbh"
halifax,ffcjj8n,t1_ffci89p,1579800808.0,"It could be tricky to work out the law (edit: as there are many things we don't know are right or wrong).

But no, saying you can't intentionally spread lies is not a slippery slope (imo)."
halifax,ffcih2b,t1_ffc79kx,1579800167.0,"Crossing guard jumped in front of them from outta nowhere and staring at their phone

/s"
halifax,ffci6e7,t1_ffcbv7f,1579799986.0,"So if we have laws for hate speech, maybe we should have laws against spreading harmful misinformation that HAS BEEN proven to be wrong. (I'm only talking about the ""vaccines cause autism"" angle. I don't know about other anit-vax claims)"
halifax,ffc1tw9,t1_ffbz3if,1579789403.0,"I guess. I can't see how it's not obvious. But that's okay. I don't understand everyone and far from everyone understands me (more like no one).

edit: I fully deserve the downvotes in other parts of the conversation. But they don't make sense to me for this one. Thanks assholes."
halifax,ffc1pkq,t1_ffbz4eq,1579789314.0,"Thank you! Just by seeing her picture, it's not the incident I was thinking of. I've emailed the links to myself because I can't watch the video right now."
halifax,ffbz1wr,t1_ffbyf5d,1579787253.0,"Ah, gotcha."
halifax,ffbz0y2,t1_ffby0ve,1579787231.0,Lol
halifax,ffbu9kf,t1_ffbu3w8,1579782952.0,"Ah, middle is in quotes. Sorry!"
halifax,ffbu90o,t1_ffb2mry,1579782937.0,Thanks for the link. Sorry I replied before reading it. I've noticed people on the news mentioning these different ideas of the seasons.
halifax,ffbu6u4,t1_ffbu3w8,1579782874.0,"So it's not the middle of winter at all?

It was pretty cold! Brrr"
halifax,ffbu3vj,t1_ffb75jt,1579782790.0,"I guess I want some downvotes too, because I agree. Seeing this headline earlier actually pissed me off. Like no shit someone had to clean up her apartment and no shit that's extremely sad.

Edit: typo caused ""earlier"" to say ""easier"""
