You look like you're great at English. Did you know there are many websites online where you can teach people in Asia to speak English? You can make 15$-20$ an hour. 

You do not need to know any Asian languages, and you do not need to have a degree in English.

In Vietnam it costs 300$/month for a 2 bedroom apartment. If you're making 15$-20$ an hour teaching English in Vietnam, you only have to work like 20 hours a month to pay your rent. I've been really hopeless before in my country, and I looked into these things. It's very possible for you to do something like this.

If you don't have a computer, go to a local library or an opendoor school, or find a friend who has a computer you can work off of."
