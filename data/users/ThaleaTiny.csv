They suffocate your natural nails, so when you finally remove them, your nails are very thin and prone to splitting, tearing, and breaking, until all new growth can come in.

The fumes from the powdered acrylic mixed with something else can be really strong when they're being applied. I think acetone is used in the process of shaping.

You have to go back around every two weeks, depending on how fast your nails grow, to have your polish removed and have new acrylic mixture filled in at the roots, and brushed out over the length. The hardened and acrylic is filled and dremeled to get the best shape -- which results in you and everybody else breathing the stuff in.

They can be done to look very natural and are nearly impossible to break or tear off. Once the plastic artificial tip has completely grown out, you have to soaked your fingertips in acetone, removing them periodically so the stylist can snip and file  aggressively at them to remove all traces of plastic and acrylic. 

Then she washes them and starts all over, with a new plastic tip, all new acrylic, polish, and designs.

To be honest, I would have them on now, except I had mine removed so I could play guitar again. I've felt like my hands are unsightly ever since, with my nails clipped as short as possible.

Lucille Ball supposedly paid a large sum of money to have her home decorated and wallpapered, only to freak out and pay to have the new wallpaper removed and replaced when she discovered it had birds in the pattern.

Yours is an interesting story. Perhaps the spiritual presences surrounding you all overcame the birds with confusion, or with a compulsion to try to get to you.
